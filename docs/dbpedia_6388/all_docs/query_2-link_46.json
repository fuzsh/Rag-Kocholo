        "text": "This article is written by Arunkumar Deshmukh, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog. This article is meant to be posted in atulsongaday.me. If this article appears in other sites without the knowledge and consent of the web administrator of atulsongaday.me, then it is piracy of the copyright content of atulsongaday.me and is a punishable offence under the existing laws.\n\nBlog Day :\n\n4104 Post No. : 15255 Movie Count :\n\n4192\n\nToday’s song is from film ‘Gokul Ka Raja’ (1954). This is the first song of this film to be discussed here. I am surprised how this film was not featured on the blog so far, because songs of this film have been on You Tube for quite some time. May be, because the entire team of this mythological film was from Marathi film industry and the names of producer, director, MD, or the cast were not familiar to the most people. It is because this was a bilingual film, made first in Marathi as ‘Gokulcha Raja’ (गोकुळचा राजा) way back in 1950 and the Hindi version was released only in 1954.\n\nMade by Yashodhan Chitra, Bombay for producers Nana Bapat and Haribhau Guruji, the film was directed by a well known Marathi Director – Bal Gajbar. He had earlier directed another bilingual Hindi-Marathi film ‘Sandesh’ (1952) and before that yet another bilingual ‘Mere Laal’ (1948) (माझं बाळ in Marathi). Bal Gajbar had directed few Kannada films too, like ‘Vichitra Prapancha’ (1955). Before becoming a director, he was an art director with V Shantaram’s Rajkamal Kala Mandir.\n\nAll songs of the film were written by YN Joshi. The Music Director was Shridhar Parsekar – a name very few people will remember. I wrote about him first time in my series “Less Known Composers”, on 17-12-2012, seven years ago. Not much was known about him then. In January 2017, Sadanand Kamath ji wrote on him. In last nearly 3 years, some new information has become available on him, so his bio data is now updated further. As the new sources give new information, the history keeps on updating itself. This is a regular process of nature.\n\nHindi film music is like an ocean. As many rivers merge into the ocean at various stages, regional music from various parts of India is assimilated in HFM (Hindi Film Music).\n\nInitially it was the Marathi stage/natya sangeet and Parsee Theatre which influenced HFM. In the East, it was Robindra Sangeet and Nazrul Geeti made the basis of film songs. In the Lahore centre it was the Punjabi style after ‘Khazanchi’ (1941).\n\nAfter Partition and polarisation of film production language wise, it was BOMBAY, which became the centre for HFM and it was a wonderful mixture of music specialties from all over the country. There were many successful Music Directors in India. I remember a famous quotation – “Behind every successful man there is a woman.”\n\nCan you tell me,who is behind every successful Music Director ? I am sure many of us do not have the answer.\n\nThe answer is THE ARRANGER.\n\nNow, who is this arranger? Some have a vague idea, some may even think, he is the person who arranges song recordings and the musicians.\n\nAn arranger is the SOUL of film music. Once the composer conceives the tune for a song, he tells it to the arranger, who immediately makes its notations (writing music or Swar Lipi), which a properly schooled musician can read and play. Arranger also decides the instruments and their placements in the song. Most of the arrangers in the Film Industry were from Goa, where traditionally Jazz music was very popular.\n\nA typical Goan likes to live life – ‘sushegaat’– which loosely means ‘araam se‘ or a carefree life. Their philosophy is eat, drink and be merry. This merry part includes Music.\n\nGoa has given many musicians to India. Lata/Asha are from Mangeshi – Goa, though the family had shifted to Kolhapur, MDs Dattaram (Wadkar) and N Datta (Datta Naik), Singers Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Shobha Mudgal, Hema Sardesai, Prabhakar Karekar, Remo Fernandez, Lorna are from Goa. (The list is only indicative, not exhaustive).\n\nMost Arrangers were from Goa —-\n\nAnthony Gonsalves from Majorda, Goa. He worked for Naushad,OP Nayyar and LP. The famous song “My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves” is a tribute by LP to him. He had taught Pyaarelal so many things including notations.\n\nChic Chocolate aka Anthony Vaz from Aldona, Goa. He worked for C Ramchandra mainly.\n\nChris Perry worked for Khayyam, RD Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, and Laxmikant Pyaarelal.\n\nFrank Fernando – Anil Biswas, Kishore Kumar, Roshan, C Ramchandra.\n\nSebastian D’Souza from Bicholim, Goa – worked for Shanker Jaikishen from 1952 to 1975, and also OP Nayyar.\n\nMost of the players of western instruments in the orchestras were from Goa.\n\nFrom this crop of musicians from Goa, there was one outstanding musician – SHRIDHAR PARSEKAR, who was a singer, a famous violin player, composer of many Marathi songs/films/dramas and few Hindi films. He was an expert in playing almost 10 different instruments.\n\nSHRIDHAR PARSEKAR was born in 1920 in Goa. From the childhood he was a lover of music and learnt classical music, first from his uncle Parshuram Buwa Parsekar and he was trained by him in playing various instruments like harmonium, jaltarang, tabla and violin. He was a disciple of Gajanan Buwa Joshi a noted musician. He operated a vand in Bardez, Goa and played violin, clarinet, harmonium and many other instruments. He was a genius and soon became famous for playing violin.\n\nHe came to Bombay and continued learning music here under many well known gurus, like Khadeem Hussain Khan, Natthan Khan and Anwar Hussain. Soon he was performing in stage shows doing jugalbandis with stars of the day like Ravi Shanker, Vilayat Khan and Akbar Ali Khan. Kishen Maharaj was very pleased with him. For some time he joined AIR Bombay as a musician and got friendly with Ustad Alla Rakha who also worked in AIR. RG Ramnathkar, who got him the AIR job, also taught him many Raaga/Raaginis. Parsekar worked at AIR for 6 years.\n\nLater he worked as asst. to Music Director Annasaheb Mainkar and then started as MD for Marathi Films and stage dramas. His music in dramas like ‘Bhakta Damaji’, ‘Paisa Bolto Ahe’, ‘Kuber’ and ‘Kanyadaan’ was very popular. He also recorded many bhavgeets and natyageets from reputed singers in Marathi. HMV and Odeon published his records. Singers like Jyotsna Bhole, Saraswati Rane, Hirabai Badodekar, Vatsala Kumthekar and Master Krishnarao Chonkar also sang for him. One of his songs- “Vithal Vithal Gajari, Awaghi Dum Dumali Pandhari” ( “विठ्ठल विठ्ठल गजरी, अवघी दुमदुमली पंढरी” ) from ‘Bhakta Damaji’ is so popular that it is sold even today.\n\nWith Marathi films, recording of private songs, stage shows with prominent musicians, Shridhar had every happiness with him. He had a bungalow, cars, bank balance, name, fame and plenty of demand. He wrote a book on music – ‘Swar Ninad‘.\n\nAnd then it happened !\n\nHe became an alcoholic. Normally, a person becomes alcoholic when he is unsuccessful. But this was an opposite case. While on the top of success he became an alcoholic. He used to drink day and night.\n\nOnce there was a jugalbandi programme with Ustad Vilayat Khan. Shridhar came fully drunk to the theatre. Vilayat Khan scolded him and left the show. Such things kept on happening, leading to his downfall. He stopped getting work and all his wealth, house, cars etc. was sold for liquor. His condition was such that he would play violin on streets and earn money. Lata Mangeshkar has narrated an incident, which I read in a book ‘From Noorjehan to Lata’ by Isak Mujawar. The book says…\n\n“One day Lata’s car stopped in the traffic. Out of curiosity she peeped out to see what happened. There was a person in tattered clothes playing a violin beautifully and people had gathered to listen to him. Some people gave him alms. She asked the driver if he knew that person. The driver replied that it was Parsekar Buwa. She got down, went to Parsekar and told him to come with her. She will look after him now. On this, Parsekar replied that her father had asked him to look after their family, which he could not do, so why should she look after him. If she wanted to help, just give some money. She gave him 50 rupees and he almost ran away from there – probably to the wine shop !“\n\nFinally Shridhar Parsekar died of liver cirrhosis on 10-9-1964 ! He was only 44 years old !! Such a brilliant artist wasted by alcohol. So sad ! Pt Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan had personally met his family after his death, so much was the respect for his talent !!\n\nIn addition to 7 Marathi films, Shridhar Parsekar gave music to five Hindi films – ‘Nagad Narayan’ (1943), ‘Mahakavi Kalidas’ (1944), ‘Meri Amanat’ (1947), ‘Andhon Ka Sahara’ (1948) and ‘Gokul Ka Raja’ (1954). He composed 45 songs in these films. He sang 5 songs in 2 films, ‘Andhon Ka Sahara’ and ‘Gokul Ka Raja. Many famous singers sang for him, like, Minakshi, Khan Mastana, Rajkumari, Master Krishnarao, Mohantara, Vinodini Dikshit etc.\n\n(Information from these sources also used herein- Marathi Chitrapat Sangeetkar Kosh, Marathi Cinema in Retrospect by Sanjit Narwekar, Purvasurinche Soor by Dr. Suresh Chandvankar and the book ‘Kalatmak Gomantak’ – Kala Academy, Panji – 1972) .\n\nThe cast of the film consisted of Dwarakanath, Ratnamala, Chandrakant, Gauri, Hanumanta, Angre etc.\n\nI do not know anything about actor Dwarakanath. Never heard of his name before or after this film ever. Actor Chandrakant was Chandrakant Mandhare (real name Gopal) – the elder brother of the more popular brother Suryakant. These two brothers ruled the Marathi cinema from the late 40s to the 60s.\n\nGauri was originally Tanibai Dawari, who was active in Prabhat from the silent era. She became famous because of her role of Awali – the shrew wife of Sant Tukaram in that film in 1936. I have recently written in details about her, only last month. As far as the heroine Ratnamala is concerned, how many of us really know anything about this actress. It is surprising that a very lovely and beautiful actress, who was heroine of about 20 films in the 40s and has about 300 films to her credit, remains practically unknown. She was the heroine with Saraswati Cinetone, Prabhat Film Company, Sagar, Ranjit, Prakash Pictures etc. – all well known banners. She was in films for 50+ years and was a famous name in Marathi films of Dada Kondke.\n\nIts a great pity that hardly any or no information about her is available in books, encyclopedias, wiki or on internet. When all sources of information come to a dead end, I turn to Harish Raghuwanshi ji of Surat and I am never disappointed. Here, I provide a short bio-data of Ratnamala, based principally on the articles given by Harish ji. Thanks, Harish ji.\n\nShe was born as Kamal Bhivandkar on 22-6-1923 in Bombay. Her father was Auditor of Central Bank, Bombay. She was good looking and could sing well. From the age of 14 years, she went on the stage of several Ganesh Melas prevalent in those times. She earned 5-10 rupees per performance. Due to family’s financial problems, she started looking for work. She was proficient in Marathi, Gujarati, English and Urdu languages. In 1938, she was picked up by Dada Torne of Sarswati Cinetone, Poona, who cast her as Heroine in Marathi film ‘Bhagwa Zenda’. Seeing her performance, she was taken by Prabhat Film Company for the Marathi version of their film ‘Das Baje’ (1942). Torne had renamed her as Ratnamala.\n\nVijay Bhatt of Prakash Pictures offered her a role in film ‘Bharat Milap’ (1942), when Kusum Deshpande selected for the role of Bharat’s wife fell ill. Seeing her performance, she was selected as a heroine for film ‘Station Master’ (1942). Here too the original heroine Jyoti fell ill. Then came ‘Panghat’ (1943), ‘Police’ (1944), ‘Kavita’ (1944) etc. She acted in many mythological films also. Some of her well known films were ‘Dholak’, ‘Maya Bazaar’, ‘Sasural’, ‘Bhabhi Ki Chudiyan’, ‘Faulad’, ‘Woh kaun thi’, ‘Nishaan’, ‘Bahu Beti’, ‘Mera Saayaa’, ‘Raaz’, ‘Saraswati Chandra’, ‘Brahmachari’, ‘Upahaar’, ‘Seeta aur Geeta’, ‘Nastik’ etc.\n\nShe acted in 130 Hindi films and many more Marathi films. Later she did side roles. She became famous as mother of Dada Kondke in 11 of his films. She was called ‘Aaye’ (आये ) in the Marathi films of Kondke.\n\nRatnamala was married to Raja Pandir, producer director of Marathi films, when she was very young. As Ratnamala became successful and Raja became a failure, their marriage came on rocks. She had one son – Jaikumar, who had also acted in one film. Unfortunately, he died suddenly in an accident. Ratnamala lived in her own bungalow in Andheri, Bombay, along with her foster son – Ramesh. Ratnamala died of heart attack on 23rd January 1989.\n\nToday’s song is the first song sung by Shridhar Parsekar that is being presented. One can easily make out from his clear voice, impeccable pronunciations and the classical singing style that the singer is trained in classical music and is a knowledgeable person. With this song the film ‘Gokul Ka Raja’ and singer Shridhar Parsekar are making their debut on this Blog.\n\nSong – Mangal Prabhat Jaage Surya Kiran Sang (Gokul Ka Raja) (1954) Singer – Sridhar Parsekar, Lyrics – YN Joshi, MD – Sridhar Parsekar\n\nLyrics\n\njaa..aa..aa..aage ae ae ae\n\njaage ae ae ae\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\nsurya kiran sang\n\ngokul mein rang\n\nsurya kiran sang\n\ngokul mein rang\n\nnavjeevan anuraage\n\njaage\n\nnavjeevan anuraage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\ngo dhan amrit varsha karta..aa..aa\n\naaaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa\n\ngo dhan amrit varsha karta\n\nsukh saurabh gokul mein jharta\n\nsukh saurabh gokul mein jharta\n\nbaal gopal\n\nbaal gopal charaayen gaayen\n\nmadhu murli jiya laage\n\nlaage\n\nmadhu murli jiya laage\n\nlaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\nsurya kiran sang\n\ngokul mein rang\n\nnavjeevan anuraage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\nmangal prabhat jaage\n\njaage\n\njaa..aa..aa..aage\n\n———————————————————\n\nHindi script lyrics (Provided by Sudhir)\n\n———————————————————\n\nजा॰॰आ॰॰आ॰॰आ॰॰आगे ए ए ए\n\nजागे ए ए ए\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nसूर्य किरण संग\n\nगोकुल में रंग\n\nसूर्य किरण संग\n\nगोकुल में रंग\n\nनवजीवन अनुरागे\n\nजागे\n\nनवजीवन अनुरागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nगो धन अमृत वर्षा करता॰॰आ॰॰आ\n\nआsss आsss आsss आsss\n\nगो धन अमृत वर्षा करता\n\nसुख सौरभ गोकुल में झरता\n\nसुख सौरभ गोकुल में झरता\n\nबाल गोपाल\n\nबाल गोपाल चराएं गाएँ\n\nमधु मुरली जिया लागे\n\nलागे\n\nमधु मुरली जिया लागे\n\nलागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nसूर्य किरण संग\n\nगोकुल में रंग\n\nनवजीवन अनुरागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nमंगल प्रभात जागे\n\nजागे\n\nजा॰॰आ॰॰आ॰॰आ॰॰आगे\n\nThis article is written by Raja, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog.

If this article appears in sites like lyricstrans.com and ibollywoodsongs.com etc then it is piracy of the copyright content of atulsongaday.me and is a punishable offence under the existing laws.\n\nBlog Day :\n\n4104 Post No. : 15254 Movie Count :\n\n4191\n\nFirst of all, my apologies for my infrequent appearances here. Even calling it a cameo is unfair to a cameo, because, to be honest, it is not even that. It is more like, a “blink and you miss” situation.\n\nAnyway, here I am today, back with a post. The occasion is the Remembrance Day of someone very special to the Hindi film industry, and also to me. He has millions of fans around the world and is easily one of the legends of the industry.\n\nI am talking about Kishore Kumar, of course.\n\nI’ve written about Kishore Kumar many times in the past. And yet, when Avinash ji requested me to write a post for this occasion, I immediately agreed. Such is my love for Kishore Kumar that even if I repeat myself and bore my readers in the process 🙂 , I could not bring myself to say no. 🙂\n\nThe problem then was to get the required writing mood back. What they say about writing is very true. If you don’t write for an extended period of time, you gradually lose the ability to do so. That is why many writers practise their writing everyday, by writing at least a minimum number of words.\n\nWhen I wrote to Avinash ji saying “Mere thoughts gather nahin ho rahe. I have lost the ability to write”, he replied “Aap Kishore Kumar ke gaane suniye aur din bhar sunte rahiye. Thoughts will come, I am sure.” 🙂\n\nSo I did listen to a few songs – predictably songs of ‘my’ era. “Khizaan Ke Phool”, “Jeevan Se Bhari Teri Aankhen”, “Teri Duniya Se”, “Hum Bewafa Hargiz Na The”, “O Mere Dil Ke Chain”, “Ye Shaam Mastaani” and a few others.\n\nI think that might have helped a bit, because here I am.\n\nAnyway, coming to Kishore Kumar.\n\nThe years just roll by – it is already 32 years since he left us.\n\nHe was just 58 at the time – far too young to go.\n\nBut like they say, it is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.\n\nAnd Kishore Kumar had plenty of life in his years.\n\nNo one will dispute that Kishore Kumar was the No.1 all-rounder in the industry. There have been a few others who have had multiple skills. Manoj Kumar was actor, writer, director, producer. Mehmood was also quite an all-rounder.\n\nBut Kishore was in a league of his own, because in each of his roles, he left a mark. Of course he is best-known as a singer, but even today many remember his acting, especially in comedy roles like in ‘Dilli Ka Thug’, ‘Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi’, ‘Half Ticket’ and many other films.\n\nBut there was so much more to Kishore Kumar than just comedy. And probably to prove this point, he produced and directed films like ‘Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein’ (1964) and ‘Door Ka Raahi’ (1971). I was stunned when I saw both these films – they have tremendous depth and philosophy, uncommon for the times.\n\nHis versatility was not limited to singing, acting, producing and directing though. Kishore Kumar also composed music, for some of his films. Like the two films mentioned above, whose songs are quite popular to this day. As are the songs of ‘Jhumroo’ (1961).\n\nThis is why I call Kishore Kumar the Gary Sobers of the Hindi film industry. 🙂 He could take on any role, and make a success of it.\n\nBut beyond even his multifarious talents, there was Kishore the person. And even as a person, he is quite an inspiration for me. His attitude towards life is something I can only admire.\n\nThose who worked with Kishore Kumar, especially Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, vouch for his ability to enliven a recording session with his sense of humour, his cracking a joke or pulling someone’s leg. Some people are like this – never a dull moment with them around.\n\nIt is not as if Kishore didn’t have low moments, or tough times. Everyone has these – Kishore was no exception. But he never let this affect his professionalism. He was very clear about himself, his philosophy towards life – and he never allowed others to define it for him.\n\nLike he said “Duniya samajhti hai main paagal hoon….main samajhta hoon duniya paagal hai”.\n\nI think, whatever his conflicts with the world might have been, especially later in his life, he was at peace with himself. And that is most important for a human being. Like he told Lata Mangeshkar in an interview in the fag end of his career “I am quite happy”. He expressed a desire to run away from it all, and go to a place which was calling out to him.\n\nToday, on his Remembrance Day, I feel Kishore Kumar found that place and left us in order to go there.\n\nAnd left us with SUCH a treasure of songs and memories that we are indebted to him for life.\n\nSo thank you, thank you, thank you, Kishore Kumar for what you have given us. Speaking purely for myself, as someone who has been part of my life from my very early years, when I listened repeatedly to songs like “Mere Sapnon Ki Raani” and “Ye Shaam Mastaani” on the radio, your impact on my life cannot be described.\n\nNow onto the song for today.\n\nIt is a totally new song for me. In fact I have never even heard of the film. Details, including lyrics of the song, have been sent to me by Avinash ji.\n\nThis is what he says :\n\n“Zindagi Jeene Ke Liye-1984’ was directed by K.S. Sethumadhavan for ‘Tirupati Chitra Mandir, Bombay’. It was produced by Hastimal.\n\nIt had Rakhi Gulzar, Suresh Oberoi, Vijay Arora, Manmohan Krishan, CS Dubey, Krishan Dhawan, Shobhha Khote, Birbal Raj, Raj Kishore, Rakesh Roshan, Tina Munim, Master Rinku, Shah Chaturvedi, Raghvaiyya, Santosh Kumar, Lata Kashmiri, Dolphin and others. Deepa and Ramu make a guest appearance in this movie.\n\nThis movie was passed by Censor Board on 06.06.1984. However, the movie was re-certified by Censor on 15.12.1987 with a UA certificate (as mentioned in HFGK).\n\nThe movie has total seven songs, including the three-part song being presented today (as per HFGK Vol-VI 1981-1985) composed by Rajesh Roshan. HFGK mentions Rajesh Roshan as the lyricist for this movie and the same is mentioned on the vinyl cover of this movie available on online sources, which I guess is correct. (myswar.co also mentions the same). Asha Bhonsle, Kishore Kumar, Pankaj Udhas and Yesudas had given their voices to the songs in this movie.”\n\nThis film, ‘Zindagi Jeene Ke Liye’ (1984), makes its debut entry on this blog today.\n\nThe song itself is amazing.

This was the maiden venture of Sanskar Chitra, Bombay, of owner Moolraj Kapadiya, who was also the producer of this movie. The film was directed by his close relative-Jamnadas Kapadiya, for whom this was his only film as a director. The film was made in Gujarati and Hindi simultaneously. The story, screenplay and songs for the Gujarati version were by Kavi Prabhulal Dwivedi and for Hindi version it was S P Tripathi, who wrote all the 12 songs of the film. While HFGK mentions name of Dwivedi as the Lyricist, according to Girdharilal Vishwakarma ji, the famous Music Historian and Record collector, the records of the songs of Hindi version carry the name of Tripathi. The Music Director of this film was Master Mohan Junior.\n\nIn the history of Hindi Cinema, besides the biggest problem of Same name artistes causing confusion, there were many other smaller, but irritating unsolved mysteries like…\n\n1. Who sang the song ” Dilli se aaya bhai Tingu” in film Ek thi ladki-49 ?\n\n2. Who was the artiste who sang on screen,” Hawa mein udta jaaye” from film Barsat-49 ?\n\n3. Who were the composers ” Vasant Ramchandra” ?\n\n4. Are they one person or two – Shyam ji Ghanashyam ji and Hemant Kedar ?\n\n5. Who said ” Yahoo” in film Junglee-64 song ?\n\n6. Who sang ” Leke pehla pehla pyar’ on screen ?\n\n7. Why composers Jaidev and C Ramchandra gave music in different names ?\n\n8. Whose voice is in the ” Mehboob production” ‘s logo ?\n\n9. Who was the artiste in Prabhat’s logo ?\n\n10. What happened to actresses Latika and Mrudula ? etc.etc.\n\nI have listed only a few here, but there are many more such riddles,puzzles and unsolved (as yet) mysteries in Hindi cinema world.\n\nSince the time I started writing on old films, I tried relentlessly to get the right answers, with proofs,for some of these riddles. I was successful in solving some mysteries too. As far as the Same name artiste’s confusions are concerned, I had dug out information on 50 such artistes and published this in my book. From time to time even my articles here also contained them. Presently, I have information on another 20 such same name artistes with me, which will be published in my next book,after adding few more pairs.\n\nOne mystery connected with today’s film is about its Music Director – Master Mohan Junior. As per a note in HFGK,under the film “Daana paani”-53, it was composer Madan Mohan, who gave music in this name. There was no reason to doubt this claim as it came from HFGK, but one day…..\n\nOne day in 2012, I received a query from Shri Girdharilal Vishwakarma ji, asking about Mohan Junior, who, according to him was a different person. He wanted to know if I had some information.\n\nI had no such information. I was actually floored with this query. After receiving this query, I immediately got in touch with Madan Mohan’s son Sanjeev Kohli ji and daughter Sangeeta Gupta ji and asked them this question. Sanjeev ji promptly responded saying that in all probabilities, Mohan Junior was a different person and that is why they have not included film Dana Pani-53 in Madan ji’s filmography.\n\nThen I contacted Harish Raghuwanshi ji of Surat. We did a hard work and then found out that Mohan Junior indeed was different. He was a Gujarati Music Director. Further Harish ji found that one Dr. Vipin Kikani had done his Ph.D. on ” Gujarati stage and its artistes” and that he had written about Mohan Junior in his book. Harish ji got the book, translated the relevant portion in Hindi, made its PDF and sent it to me with his Gujarati Filmography.\n\nBy now, the mystery was almost solved, but still, to get a first person confirmation, I requested Girdharilal ji to talk to Madhubala Jhaveri,because she had sung some songs for Mohan Junior. He did it immediately and Madhubala ji confirmed that Mohan Junior was a Gujarati person and he was NOT Madan Mohan.\n\nAt last, it was conclusively proved that Master Mohan Junior was not a pseudo name for Madan Mohan but he was a different person. Here is his full information…….\n\nMaster Mohan Junior was born in 1908 in a Bhurji Rajpoot family at Masuda, near Ajmer. When he was 5 year old, the great Plague epidemic killed all members of his family and he became an orphan. His cousin sister took him to Idar and he grew up there. He had inherited the singing ability of his father.When he was 13 year old, Raghunath-his brother in law- sent him to ” Morvi Subodh Arya Natak Mandali “, in 1921. Later he also worked with Imperial,Laxmikant Natak Mandali and Arya Naitik drama company from 1926 to 1930. His brother in law was quite attached to him.\n\nHe started with Gujarat Kala Mandir as a Music Composer from 1930 onwards. His attempts to become an actor failed in 1932. He was now owner of the company Arya Natak Mandali, in which Ramlal was a Music composer. His music became famous with many famous dramas.Raskavi Raghunath Brahmabhat has praised his music capabilities.\n\nHe gave music to 6 Gujarati films, namely- Ajamil-48, Vadilon naa vaanke-48, Bhakta Pooran-49, Vevishat-49, Choodi Chaandlo-50 and Bhakta Narsaiyo-52. He also gave music to 2 Hindi films- Ajamil-48 and Daana Paani-53.\n\nEven after all clarification about Mohan Junior, still 2 questions remained –\n\n1.Why did Begum Akhtar say that Madan Mohan gave music. The answer to that is-she was right, that Gazal (in film Dana Pani-53) was composed by Madan mohan and it was used in the film. It was concluded therefore that the entire film music was given by Madan Mohan. I think HFGK went overboard in this.\n\n2.Why that composer called himself Junior, because in 48, and 49 Madan Mohan was not a composer as yet. He debuted with Aankhe-50. I found out that during that period there was yet another Mohan-a Mohan Sharma, a Music director for Jai Hind-1949(unreleased) and Chocolate-1950.\n\nMay be to distinguish himself,he called himself as Mohan Junior.\n\nSanjeev Kohli ji has also now agreed that he must be a different person. However Sanjeev ji has requested me NOT to quote his name elsewhere in this connection.,as he does not want any controversy now. so let us keep him out of this.\n\nAlthough all this search for truth took place back in 2012- 7 years ago, I have recounted all this now, only to stress the difficulties one faces in breaking an old myth or decoding a mystery. Further, all this was never brought before readers any time. Additionally Mohan Junior’s bio data is published first time here.\n\nFilm Ajamil was also made in silent era in 1922 by Kohinoor film company, Bombay. Kanjibhai Rathod had directed it. Next, it was made in 1934 as a Talkie, by Saroj Movietone. It’s director was Abdul Rehman Kabuli, about whom I just wrote in my previous post. The role of Ajamil was done by Ashraf khan – who himself became a Sufi Saint in his later life.\n\nThe story of Ajamil has been taken from the 6th chapter of Bhagwat Puran. It stresses the value of Naam smaran or Jaap and how it can make a Saint out of a bad man. The story of Ajamil is…\n\nAjamila was once a very noble Brahmin, performing his duties and prescribed rituals most sincerely and was also a good husband, good son and good father. Once when he was in the forest to gather the fuel-wood for his rituals, he fell for a woman, heart and soul. Actually the woman was one of very low morals. From that time onwards he lived with her, abandoned his family and his own parents. He got ten children by her, made a living and supported this large family by blackmailing rich people, by cheating, fraud and gambling. He was particularly fond of the youngest child, Narayana, by name. The attachment to the child was so pronounced that whether he was eating, drinking, relaxing or working, he would always want Narayana to be by his side and partake of his food or participate in his enjoyment. When finally the call from Yama, the God of Death, came, it came suddenly and in his agony he called his child to his side and cried: O Narayana. He called aloud with great fear.\n\nThe messengers of Yama who almost got him in their noose suddenly found from within his heart four well-clad beautiful angel-like figures, each with four hands, preventing the messengers of Yama from discharging their duty. An intense conversation ensued between the messengers of Yama on the one side and the messengers of Narayana – because that is what they were – on the other side. They asked: You are the emissaries of Dharma-raja; then you should know what dharma is and what rules apply for punishment. The messengers of Yama replied: (VI – 1 -40 to 68):\n\nWhat is declared by the Vedas is dharma. What is prohibited by Vedas is adharma. The one God who has created this entire world and who has allotted the different duties to varnas and ashramas is Lord Narayana. He has ordained that our Lord Yama take the lives of people when their time is over and punish them according to sins committed by them. There are several witnesses to whatever a man does in his life.\n\nThey are the Sun, Agni the Fire-God, Space, the Wind-God, Animals, the Moon, the God of SandhyA the twilight, Day, Night, the eight quarters, Water, Earth, Time and the God of Dharma, who is Yama himself. Nothing can be hidden from any of these. . We are doing our duty ordained by our boss.\n\nBack came a pretty long rejoinder from the messengers of Vishnu: Your Master who must show to the world what right action is, has sent messengers like you who do not seem to know the rules! This Ajamila, though he has forgotten his real divine nature, has pronounced the four-syllabled name of God Narayana at the time of death and by that very action has done the Prayaschitta – प्रायश्चित्त (repentance act) for all his sins.\n\nA thief of gold, a drinker of wine, a betrayer of a friend, a killer of a brahmin, one who commits adultery with the wife of his Guru, a killer of a woman or of a king, or of a cow or of his father — all these worst sinners have been declared to be absolved by the recitation of God’s name because by that very act he becomes God’s protege and deserves to be under His care.\n\nAfter all this explanation by the messengers of Vishnu the messengers of Yama felt overpowered and they went back to their overlord. In the meantime Ajamila came back to his senses and remembered all the conversation that went on in the presence of his subtle body between the messengers. He was about to say something, when the messengers of Vishnu also disappeared. It was quite a while before he could take stock of the situation.\n\nHere he was. alive and kicking, by the mercy of God Narayana, whose name he had just taken on the point of death, not in remembrance of the Lord but in passionate affection of his child. If this single act of the utterance of a four-syllable word Narayana can make such a difference to life after death, what larger worlds of fullness and majesty he may not conquer by really leading a noble life of Dharma in the memory of the Lord? — so thought Ajamila. And that very moment he renounced everything to which he was attached, went to Benares and engaged himself in austerities and meditation and in due time reached the abode of the Lord.

It is presented annually at the National Film Awards ceremony by the Directorate of Film Festivals, an organisation set up by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The recipient is honoured for their “outstanding contribution to the growth and development of Indian cinema” and is selected by a committee consisting of eminent personalities from the Indian film industry. The award comprises a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ?1,000,000 (US$14,000). Presented first in 1969, the award was introduced by the Government of India to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke’s contribution to Indian cinema. Phalke (1870–1944), who is popularly known as and often regarded as “the father of Indian cinema”, was an Indian filmmaker who directed India’s first full-length feature film, Raja Harishchandra.\n\nThe first recipient of the award was actress Devika Rani, who was honoured at the 17th National Film Awards held in 1969. As of 2017, there have been 49 awardees. Among those, actor Prithviraj Kapoor (1971) and actor Vinod Khanna (2017) are the only posthumous recipients. Raj Kapoor accepted the award on behalf of his father Prithviraj Kapoor at the 19th National Film Awards in 1971 and was himself a recipient in 1987 at the 35th National Film Awards ceremony. Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy (1974) and Bommireddy Nagi Reddy (1986); Raj Kapoor (1987) and Shashi Kapoor (2014); Lata Mangeshkar (1989) and Asha Bhosle (2000) along with B. R. Chopra (1998) and Yash Chopra (2001) are the siblings who have won the award.\n\nNote:- all of the above information I have extracted from Wikipedia and apologize for any wrong information therein.\n\nOctober 11th 1942 was the date when Teji Bachchan- wife of Shri. Harivansh Rai Bachchan gave India the Shahenshah of Bollywood. He goes by the name Shri. Amitabh Bachchan. Anyone who has even the faintest knowledge about Indian movies -anywhere in the world- would have heard about this actor. He may have not been India’s first mega-superstar, that title will always be associated with Rajesh Khanna. The reason I have used the term Mega-Superstar for Rajesh Khanna is because Dilip Kumar- Dev Anand-Raj Kapoor were equally big stars of their generation and the trio were inspiration for the next set of actors like Manoj Kumar, Dharmendra, Rajendra Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Jeetendra, Amitabh Bachchan etc. The popularity and fan-following that Rajesh Khanna achieved was much more than what the trio of the 50s and 60s may have experienced collectively. Amitabh Bachchan had a long journey to reach the level of popularity that was Rajesh Khanna’s; but even at the height of his superstardom one has never heard of girls writing letters to Amitabh with blood, or throwing themselves at his car or trying to commit suicide at the news of his marriage to Jaya Bhaduri etc.\n\nWhat Amitabh experienced was a different kind of affection from his fans. There were people who prayed for his life in 1982 when he had an accident during the shoot of “Coolie”. There are accounts of people walking barefoot from far-flung places to the hospital where AB was admitted and battling for life after the accident; people offering prayers at various places of worship cutting across religious differences. AB has always thanked his fans for all the love they showered on him during that period. In fact, he always greets them on Sunday evenings (whenever he is in Mumbai i.e.) for which there is a huge crowd of fans waiting outside his Mumbai residence.\n\nHe may have been dubbed the angry-young-man in the early phase of his career but he was equally adept at emotional, romantic or comic roles. “Mahaan” (1983) had him in three roles where we had him as an emotional father/ husband, serious-faced inspector and comic stage artist. The turn of the century saw him change his style and take on a variety of roles and characters- strict father who will not accept his son marrying against his wishes (Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham), strict principal who wanted all his students to adhere to the ‘parampara’ ‘pratishtha’ etc laid down by the college (Mohabbatein), friendly-indulgent father to Akshay Kumar (“Ek Rishtaa: the bond of love” and “Waqt: the race against time”) etc. etc. etc. We saw him as a rustic near-bumbling cop in “Bunty Aur Babli”; aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl in “Black”; these successful experiments have seen him through 50 years in an industry which has many talented actors but no one has been given epithets like “Shahenshah of Bollywood”, “Big B” or “Star Of The Millennium”. He continues his reign over the hearts of his fans in spite of the next generation and the one after it giving movies that gross over 100 crores per film. He still gets author backed roles that befit his age and many-a-times is the central character of the story as in “Baghban” and “Baabul”. His detractors may feel that he is the most off-key (besura) singer (and I believe he agrees that he is mostly off-key) but the songs that he has sung (from the first full song “mere pass aao mere doston”) have been well received by his die-hard fans-yours truly included. 🙂\n\nComing back to the opening para of this post- here is the connection- Amitabh Bachchan is the recipient of this prestigious award for this year. He joins an august list of personalities who have had a major influence on the Indian film industry beginning from Devika Rani who is acknowledged as the first lady of Indian cinema.\n\nThis is the latest feather in AB’s cap in addition to the Padma awards – Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan; 4 National Awards for best actor and 15 Filmfare awards and numerous other awards from various national and international organisations.\n\nToday he turns 77 and I am confused as to which is an appropriate song that should go with this post- I have a big collection to choose from- the blog has about 20 songs which have had Amitabh Bachchan in the recording room as a singer or uttering a few words with the main singer.\n\nToday’s song is from the BR films produced 2006 release “Baabul”. It had AB play an indulgent and friendly father to Salman Khan and a loving father-in-law to Rani Mukherjee. The movie had a simple story of the loving father-in-law, fighting the opposition from his own wife and other family members, against his decision of getting his son’s widow remarried. The song comes at the fag end of the movie. It was on my list of songs under consideration for this post. What clinched the matter in its favour is that the song has two versions to it. The version in the movie is in the voice of Amitabh Bachchan and the album version is in Jagjit Singh’s voice. And only this morning I saw a message on our WhatsApp group that yesterday was Jagjit Singh’s anniversary.\n\nSo, we wish our Big B a long and healthy life and lots more years of entertaining us along with remembering Jagjit Singh and his smooth voice.\n\nVideo (Amitabh Bachchan voice)\n\nAudio\n\nSong-Kehta hai baabul o meri bitiya (Baabul)(2006) Singer-Amitabh Bachchan/ Jagjit Singh, Lyrics-Sameer, MD-Aadesh Srivastava\n\nLyrics\n\nkehta hai baabul o meri bitiya\n\ntu toh hai mere jigar ki chitthiya\n\nkehta hai baabul o meri bitiya\n\ntu toh hai mere jigar ki chitthiya\n\ndaakiya koyi jab aayega\n\ntujhko churaa ke le jaayega\n\nkatega kaise lamha tere bina bata\n\njiyunga kaise tanha tere bina bata\n\nkatega kaise lamha tere bina bata aa aa\n\njiyuga kaise tanha tere bina bata\n\ntu suhaagan rahe sang saajan rahe raat din\n\niss khushi ke liye har sitam main uthha loonga aa\n\ntere jaane kaa gham mujhko hoga magar laadli\n\nleke iss dard ko main sada muskuraaoonga\n\nbaabul toh dil se de raha duaa yahi\n\nkhushi ke saaye mein ho zindagi teri\n\nbaabul toh dil se de raha duaa yahi ee\n\nkhushi ke saaye mein ho zindagi teri\n\nwaqt ke saath zakhm yeh bhar jayega\n\npal guzar jayega tu meri baat maan le ae\n\nyaadon ke aasre umr kat’ti nahin\n\nhai haqeeqat yahi abb too jaan le ae ae\n\nsamundaron ka paani koyi naa pi saka\n\nakela khaara jeevan koyi naa jee saka aa\n\nsamundaron ka paani koyi naa pi saka\n\nakela khaara jeevan koyi naa jee saka\n\nkehta hai baabul o meri bitiya\n\ntu toh hai mere jigar ki chitthiya\n\ndaakiya koyi jab aayega\n\ntujh ko churaa ke le jaayega\n\nkatega kaise lamha tere bina bata\n\njiyunga kaise tanha tere bina bata\n\nkatega kaise lamha tere bina bata\n\njiyunga kaise tanha tere bina bata\n\nThis article is written by nahm, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a regular contributor to this blog.This article is meant to be posted in atulsongaday.me.

His given name is Inquilab Srivastava, as per Wikipedia. This is a surprise for me and surely for many people, as a never heard fact. Also has the distinction of acting as the hero in the film ‘Inquilab’ not named after him :-). His father did name him after the slogan of freedom movement “Inquilab Zindabad”. I have never heard of anyone named ‘inquilab’, but have a friend named ‘Kranti’ which is the same thing with change in language only.\n\nSo, on 11.10.2019, he is celebrating 77th birthday as the most celebrated star actor and film personality. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shree in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, “Knight of the Legion of Honour”, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond. As per Wikipedia page again, he has won 15 filmfare awards, the most nominated actor with 41 nominations so far and still counting.\n\nHis achievements include 4 national awards and Dada Saheb Phalke award for “Lifetime Achievement”.\n\nLuckily, I had the lyrics of this song from the film “Shaan” (1980) ready to present as the birthday celebration post. I said in my reply to Peevecie’s Mom’s comments on this post that BEST buses is a topic of another post. I had this song in mind, most of which is picturized on a BEST double decker bus. “BEST” was formerly Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport, now it is renamed as ‘Brihan Mumbai Electricity Supply and Transport”. My father has been saying this to us right from the beginning that though BEST’s face are the buses which have been the more reliable lifeline of Bombay since almost a century now, its main business and source of income is the electricity supply to the city areas.\n\nIf I have to write about the BEST than the story has to start with my father. It is in family folklore that my father had after completing engineering had the option of coming to Mumbai (than Bombay) or to go to Lucknow to join the Railways. This was in the early 60’s, and Bombay was a known place of people in the family, who used to visit it for business purposes also. Also my mother’s ‘Maternal uncle’ had studied in Grant Medical College in the 40’s and everyone was familiar with the city. There was a job in hand in Lucknow, which is an unknown place, nobody in the family had ever been and far away from Belgaum. The family was in favour of Bombay as my father’s sister was already staying here at Kalyan. The decision was left to my father’s youngest sister, who voted in favour of Bambai. So he came to Bombay and joined BEST as a “foreman” trainee. There is a lot more I want to write about my father’s journey (most of it is related to BEST), but will save it for another post. Sometimes I do wonder, if he had gone to Lucknow instead of coming to Mumbai, how different the things would have turned out. I envy the people who have spent their formative years in Lucknow(met a few in my working life), their diction of Urdu language. Some of them, though convent educated did speak a fluent form of spoken khari boli which is closer in diction and grammar to the Urdu that our teachers taught us, compared to my own, the so called Urdu medium product, with our typical bambaiyya dialect. More of the royal ‘aap’ and ‘hum’ in the conversations of people of my generations who spent years in Lucknow, or thereabouts, even as far as some northern cities of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nWill go back to Amitabh Bachchan for now. The first movie I am aware of watching in the theatre is “Do aur do Paanch”, with a similar star cast of Amitabh, Shashi Kapoor and Parween Babi, similar to ‘Shaan’ I mean. Incidently both these films were released in the same year. But we all saw “Do aur do paanch” at Belgaum during summer vacations, whereas “Shaan” was seen in Mumbai. Thereafter, Amitabh Bachchan movies were seen regularly, with the whole family. The movies of before 1980 are all seen on TV, but the movies after 1980, including “Silsila”, “Kaalia”, “Namak Halaal”, ‘Naseeb”,”KhudgarzKhuddaar”, “bemisaal”, ‘Laawaris” etc. I remember watching in theatre.\n\nMy personal favorite Amitabh films are not the comic or multistarrers, but his solo films like ‘Zanjeer’, ‘Bemisaal”, ‘Kaalia”, “Abhimaan” ‘Anand’ etc. Among the films of the new millennia, I have seen a few, but missed most of them. He is without doubt the longest running superstar of the hindi film industry.\n\nSo here in this song there are four singers, Kishore Kumar for Amitabh Bachchan, Mohammed Rafi for Shashi Kapoor, Asha Bhosle for Parveen Babi and Usha Mangeshkar for Bindiya Goswami. Anand Bakshi is the lyricist and is composed by R. D. Burman.\n\nThe film is ‘Shaan’(1980), also mentioned in para 4 above.\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\nSong-Jaanu meri jaan main tere qurbaan (Shaan)(1980) Singers-Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, Asha Bhosle, Usha Mangeshkar, Lyrics-Anand Bakshi, MD-R D Burman\n\nAsha Bhoonsle + Usha Mangeshkar\n\nAll\n\nLyrics\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\narrey main tera tu meri\n\njaanu saara hindustaan\n\nmain tera tu meri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\narrey main tera tu meri\n\njaane saara hindustaan\n\nmain tera tu meri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\nnazron se na tol mujhe\n\ndil se kaam le\n\ntu jis ki wo tere bin\n\nkyon kisi ka naam le\n\narre nazron se na tol mujhe\n\ndil se kaam le\n\ntu jis ki wo tere bin\n\nkyun kisi ka naam le\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\nO Jaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\narrey main tera tu meri\n\njaane saara hindustaan\n\nmain tera tu meri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\nha aha ha haan haan ha\n\nhey ae ae\n\nae ae aaaaa\n\nae ae ae\n\noo ooo oooooo\n\nchhoti si ik baat bani\n\nbaat se daastaan\n\nbhool ke sab baaten hans de\n\nhai yahi pyaar ki shaan\n\nchhoti si ik baat bani\n\nbaat se daastaan\n\nbhool ke sab baaten hans de\n\nhai yahi pyaar ki shaan\n\njaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\no jaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\ntu mera main teri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\ntu mera\n\nmain teri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\narrey Jaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\nJaanu meri jaan\n\nmain tere qurbaan\n\nHoy main tera tu meri\n\njaane saara hindustaan\n\ntu meraa main teri\n\njaane saaraa hindustaan\n\n————————————-\n\nDevnagri script lyrics (Provided by nahm)\n\n————————————-\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nअरे मैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nमैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nअरे मैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nमैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nनज़रों से न तोल मुझे\n\nदिल से काम ले\n\nतू जिस की वो तेरे बिन\n\nक्यूँ किसी का नाम ले\n\nनज़रों से न तोल मुझे\n\nदिल से काम ले\n\nतू जिस की वो तेरे बिन\n\nक्यूँ किसी का नाम ले\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nअरे मैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nमैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nहा हा हा ह आहा हा\n\nहे ए ए\n\nहो हो हो हो\n\nओ ओ ओ ओ\n\nछोटी सी इक बात बनी\n\nबात से दास्तां\n\nभूल के सब बाते हंस दे\n\nहै यही प्यार की शान\n\nछोटी सी इक बात बनी\n\nबात से दास्तां\n\nभूल के सब बातें हंस दे\n\nहै यही प्यार की शान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nतू मेरा मैं तेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nतू मेरा\n\nमैं तेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nजानु मेरी जान\n\nमैं तेरे क़ुरबान\n\nहो मैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nमैं तेरा तू मेरी\n\nजाने सारा हिंदुस्तान\n\nThis article is written by Avinash Scrapwala, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a regular contributor to this blog.This article is meant to be posted in atulsongaday.me.

Bhalla, Polsan, Renuka, Keshav Rana, Abhimanyu Sharma, Jankidas, Master Raju, Pahalwan, Habib, Mac Mohan, Maqbool, Bam Lahiri, Abhimanyu Sharma, Master Rajoo and many others.\n\nFaryal, Asha Potdar, Shyam Kumar, Satyendra Kappu make a friendly appearance in this movie.\n\nThe movie also introduced a sheep ‘Kaptaan’.\n\nStory of this movie was written by K.B. Pathak. Dialogues were written by Wajahat Mirza. Wajahat Mirza also shared the screenplay writing K.B. Pathak and Sultan Ahmed. Editing of this movie was done by M.S. Shinde.\n\nLata Mangeshkar, Mohd Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhonsle, Usha Khanna and Mukri gave their voices to the songs in this movie.\n\nThis movie was passed by Censor Board on 23.10.1973.\n\nHFGK Vol-V (1971-1980) listed six songs on the movie page for this movie, it was however corrected in the addenda that the first song in the list, is actually only few lines of the first song in the movie ‘ek chhokariya beech bajariya’ , and thus reducing the total number of songs of this movie to five.\n\nThis song ‘ek chhokariya beech bajariya’ was presented on the blog by our Respected Arun ji and he also had mentioned in brief about this movie and its story. (Wherein only one correction is required that the villain Balwant (Shatrughan Sinha) is not arrested b the police in the end of this movie, but he gets killed during the encounter with Heera (Sunil Dutt) and the Police).\n\nI have vague memories of watching this movie either with my Father or my Uncle. And I must be around five or six years old then. After that I have never watched this movie again.\n\nBut I always have the nostalgia with me for the song ‘main tujhse milne aayi mandir jaane ke bahaane’ from this movie. I remember this song was very popular then and was frequently played on loud speakers. (however, none of the songs from this movie made it to the annual list of ‘Binaca Geetmala’ of that year). Other than this song the nostalgia related with this movie that I always carried was ‘the daaku, the horses and the guns and the ‘khandahars’ 🙂\n\nOther than the two songs mentioned above the other song which one can remember after listening to it is ‘Jai Ambe Jagdambe Maa Jai Ambe Jagdambe’ which was also heard, may be during ‘Durga Pooja’ festivals only.\n\nAnd these three songs mentioned above are the three songs from this movie which have been posted in the blog so far.\n\nOne can find the today’s song also heard on radio in those days, but I think it was not much popular and forgotten easily thereafter. However this can remind us of the many this type of songs in other movies 😊\n\nMusic for this movie was composed by Kalyanji-Anandji, while two lyricists wrote the songs for this movie, Indeewar three songs and Anjaan two songs.\n\nToday’s song is written by Anjaan and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. On screen it is performed by Asha Parekh.\n\nAsha Parekh recently celebrated her 77th birth anniversary on this 2nd October. (She was born on 2nd October 1942). We belatedly wish her a very healthy and peaceful life ahead.\n\nThis song happens to be a song in the ‘villain’s den’ where Asha Parekh and her Father Kanhaiyyalal are hostages after Balwant (Shatrughan Sinha) has abducted them. And he forces Asha Devi (Asha Parekh) to dance in his den …\n\n‘le baandh le ye ghunghroo… aur aisaa naach ke aaj saari sabhaa mein aag lag jaaye’\n\nNaach …\n\nAnd that is why this song …\n\nLet us now enjoy this song sung by Lata Mangeshkar and composed by Kalyanji-Anandji.\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\nSong-Aaj naachoon aise ke aag lag jaaye (Heera)(1973) Singer-Lata, Lyrics-Anjaan, MD-Kalyanji Anandji\n\nLyrics\n\naaj naachoon aise ke aag lag jaaye\n\naaj naachoon aise ke aag lag jaaye\n\naag lage aisi ke bujhne naa paaye ae\n\nbujhne naa paaye\n\naaj naachoon aise ke aag lag jaaye\n\naaj naachoon aise ke aag lag jaaye\n\naag lage aisi ke bujhne naa paaye ae\n\nbujhne naa paaye\n\nO deewaane tu sun\n\nmeri paayal ki dhun\n\niski jhankaar mein maut ka raag hai\n\nho koi sangedil\n\nkhaaq mein jaaye mil\n\naaj ghunghroo ke bolon mein wo aag hai\n\njaa re jaa aa\n\njaa re jaa\n\njaa re jaa aa\n\nmujhe aise tu dekhen kyun\n\naankh jo milaaun to aag lag jaaye\n\naankh jo milaaun to aag lag jaaye ae\n\naag lage aisi ke bujhne naa paaye ae\n\nbujhne naa paaye\n\nkar naa ghaayal mujhe\n\nrang degaa tujhe\n\nhar lahu ka jo katraa giregaa yahaan\n\nzulm itnaa na kar\n\nyoon naa hadd se guzar\n\ntu agar hai zameen to koi aasmaan\n\njaa re jaa aa\n\njaa re jaa\n\njaa re jaa aa\n\ndekho mujhko na chhoona yoon\n\nhaath naa lagaa tu\n\nke aag lag jaaye\n\nhaath naa lagaa tu\n\nke aag lag jaaye ae\n\naag lage aisi ke bujhne na paaye ae\n\nbujhne na paaye …\n\n———————————————–\n\nDevnagri Script lyrics (Provided by Avinash Scrapwala)\n\n———————————————–\n\nआज नाचूँ ऐसे के आग लग जाए\n\nआज नाचूँ ऐसे के आग लग जाए\n\nआग लगे ऐसी के बुझने ना पाए ए\n\nबुझने ना पाए\n\nआज नाचूँ ऐसे के आग लग जाए\n\nआज नाचूँ ऐसे के आग लग जाए\n\nआग लगे ऐसी के बुझने ना पाए ए\n\nबुझने ना पाए\n\nओ दिवाने तू सुन\n\nमेरी पायल की धुन\n\nइसकी झंकार में मौत का राग है\n\nहो कोई संगदिल\n\nखाक में जाए मिल\n\nआज घुंघरू के बोलों में वो आग है\n\nजा रे जा आ\n\nजा रे जा\n\nजा रे जा आ\n\nमुझे ऐसे तू देखें क्यूँ\n\nआँख जो मिलाऊं तो आग लग जाए\n\nआँख जो मिलाऊं तो आग लग जाए ए\n\nआग लगे ऐसी के बुझने ना पाए ए\n\nबुझने ना पाए\n\nकर ना घायल मुझे\n\nरंग देगा तुझे\n\nहर लहू का जो कतरा गिरेगा यहाँ\n\nज़ुल्म इतना ना कर\n\nयूं ना हद से गुज़र\n\nतू अगर है ज़मीन तो कोई आसमान\n\nजा रे जा आ\n\nजा रे जा\n\nजा रे जा आ\n\nदेखो मुझको ना छूना यूं\n\nहाथ ना लगा तू के आग लग जाए\n\nहाथ ना लगा तू के आग लग जाए ए\n\nआग लगे ऐसी के बुझने ना पाए ए\n\nबुझने ना पाए … … …\n\nThis article is written by Peevesie’s mom, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a regular contributor to this blog.This article is meant to be posted in atulsongaday.me.

Movies essentially remakes of popular and successful Telugu, Tamil and Kannada movies. Movies with nearly same formula- one hero and two heroines, both ladies loving the hero equally with the hero behaving courteously with one and loving the other passionately. To add further twist, the heroines will be sisters (as in Tohfa), childhood best friends (as in Raaste Pyar Ke), or meet accidentally and become good friends (as in Maang Bharo Sajna and Asha Jyoti).\n\nAll the movies would have good songs which used to be popular in the 80s and 90s but may have been forgotten since. The most important aspect of these movies used to be that one of the heroines would sacrifice her love or never reveal her love so that the other can lead a happy life with her partner/ husband etc. The hero in most of these South-made movies was Jeetendra and the heroines were mostly Rekha, Reena Roy, Shabana Azmi, Moushumi Chatterjee, Jaya Prada or Sridevi. Taking note of the success of Jeetendra in these movies Rajesh Khanna also acted in a few South-made movies.\n\nAsha Jyoti was one of them. The movie had five songs with Anuradha Paudwal, Asha Bhonsle and Kishore Kumar as playback singers. Anjaan was the lyricist and Laxmi Pyare were the music directors. One song has been posted from the movie. In that post Atulji has speculated about the status of the relations between the main cast. I have seen this movie a long time back and here is the story of the movie, hope that it clears all speculations. 🙂\n\nAsha Jyoti (1984) had Rajesh Khanna, Reena Roy and Rekha as the main cast. The film was directed by Dasari Narayana Rao, who had also directed Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar with Khanna in the lead role and music was given by Laxmikant Pyarelal. The film is remake of Telugu Movie Srivari Muchatlu (1981).\n\nRamesh Chander (Om Shivpuri), a businessman, asks his son Deepak (Rajesh Khanna), a musician, if he would marry his childhood friend Asha (Rekha), but Deepak keeps declining this idea. Deepak falls in love with one of his fans named Jyoti (Reena Roy), a dancer, and he informs his parents by telegram that he has chosen a girl. Deepak promises to pay off the debts owed by Jyoti’s father. But when Deepak reaches his home in Bombay (now Mumbai), he finds that Ramesh has committed suicide due to bankruptcy. Ramesh expresses his last wish that his second wife and her daughter be taken care of. Deepak is delayed in Bombay and is unable to return to Kashmir.\n\nIn Kashmir, Jyoti’s creditor asks her father for money, but Jyoti expresses her inability to pay, so the creditor warns Jyoti’s father she will be in grave trouble. When Deepak does arrive at Jyoti’s house, her father lies, saying that he has married her off to the creditor. Deepak is heartbroken and returns home.\n\nSeth Badri Prasad (Madan Puri), a rich man and childhood friend of Ramesh, bails Deepak out from bankruptcy and gets Ramesh’s creditors to not to file suit against Deepak and to auction the bungalow that he would buy. Deepak feels indebted to Prasad. Badri Prasad had been forcing his friend Ramesh Chander to ask Deepak to marry Asha, daughter of Badri Prasad. After Deepak returns to Bombay, his mother suggests to him that he should now get settled in his life and bring some happiness in his life and so he marries Asha. During the wedding, Deepak observes a woman similar to Jyoti. Deepak searches for the Jyoti lookalike and finds the woman was actually Jyoti.\n\nNow Deepak knows that Jyoti was not married to Hukumchand (Roopesh Kumar) and that her father had lied to him. Jyoti had come to Bombay in search of Deepak and tells him that she is the mother of Deepak’s child. Deepak decides to end his marriage with Asha and to tell Asha the truth, but Jyoti insists that Asha would not be able to remarry as society might discard her. Jyoti asks Deepak to act as if they had never met and be a loyal husband of Asha, so that Jyoti can take care of Deepak’s child.\n\nLater, Jyoti becomes a popular dance teacher in her city. Asha decides to learn dancing form Jyoti and they become close friends. Asha discloses that her husband is not loving her and he does not even come close to her. Jyoti visits Asha’s home and learns that Asha is none other than Deepak’s wife. Jyoti tells Deepak to be a true husband to Asha and give Asha the pleasures of married life.\n\nAsha learns that Jyoti and Deepak were lovers before her marriage to Deepak and suspects they are having an affair. Asha found that Deepak and Jyoti are well-wishers of Asha, are innocent and victims of the unpredictable nature of fate. After coming to know the truth, Asha and Jyoti decide to sacrifice their respective lives to let the other live a nice happy married life with Deepak.\n\nSitting through the movie was not a pain. I loved the way the ladies (over) dressed in silk sarees and had extra long hair plaited in the traditional South Indian Style complete with a garden full of flowers on their hair and heavy jewellery. There was a time in my life when I yearned to have hair like my idol -Rekha- sported in these movies. These movies also showed that Rekha was an artist who followed all instructions of the choreographer and enacted the semi-classical dances that were there in the movie, as can be seen in the song of this movie that is already posted. She also had large eyes that conveyed a variety of emotions.\n\nToday’s song comes towards the end of the movie where we have Asha dressing up Jyoti as a bride and trying to rectify the wrong that fate has delivered on Deepak and his Jyoti (the movies in this genre excelled in naming their characters). We also see that Deepak and Jyoti are not comfortable with this turn of events but Asha prevails on them and we have this Asha Bhonsle play backed song.\n\nI am sure the readers have guessed why I chose a song that has the “oh! so beautiful!” Rekha for today’s post. Yes, she turns a year older today and it has become a compulsion for me that write atleast a small post to wish her.\n\nWish you a very happy birthday Rekhaji.\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\nSong-Aayi pehli milan ki wo raat (Asha Jyoti)(1984) Singer-Asha Bhonsle, Lyrics-Anjaan, MD-Laxmikant Pyarelal\n\nLyrics\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\nkya kya huyi re piya ke sang baat\n\nkya kya huyi re piya ke sang baat\n\nsawere humen batlaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\nho o o\n\nkitne saawan pyaase tarse\n\ntabhi suhaagan raat aati hai\n\naati hai toh\n\npyaar se mann ka kora aanchal bhar jaati hai\n\nkora aanchal bhar jaati hai ae\n\npyaase mann pe huyi kya barsaat\n\nsawere humen batlaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\ntan se tan ka milan nahin yeh\n\ntan se tan ka milan nahin yeh\n\nyeh hai do saanson ka sangam\n\napne jiya ko bas mein rakhna\n\ndil ki dhadkan jaaye na thham\n\nkaisi hoti hai\n\nkaisi hoti hai pehli mulaakaat\n\nsawere humen batlaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\nmadhur milan ki iss bela mein\n\ntan mann jeewan kar de arpan\n\nmadhur milan ki iss bela mein\n\ntan mann jeewan kar de arpan\n\npyaar se saajan ka mann jeete\n\nwahi dulhan hai yahaan suhaagan\n\no o o o\n\nkiski jeet huyi re kiski maat\n\nsawere hume batlaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana\n\nkya kya huyi re piya ke sang baat\n\nkya kya huyi re piya ke sang baat\n\nsawere humen batlaana\n\naayi pehli milan ki woh raat\n\nsajan se na sharmaana"
