        "text": "Today is the birth centenary of the ‘King of the Ghazal’, the inimitable Talat Mahmood. Talat was born on February 24, 1924 in Lucknow, and it was in Lucknow itself that he obtained his initial training in music: at the Marris College of Music, where he learnt classical Hindustani music from Pandit SCR Bhatt. By the age of sixteen, Talat was singing the ghazals of Urdu’s foremost poets for All India Radio Lucknow, and was soon taken on by HMV as well. His first introduction to cinema came through the film industry in Calcutta, where he not only sang songs (under the name ‘Tapan Kumar’), but also acted in several films. In 1949, at the age of twenty-five, Talat moved to Bombay, and the rest, of course, is history: he went on to become one of Hindi cinema’s most distinctive voices, and his songs—romantic, filled with pathos, tender, soulful—still live on.\n\nI have done a Talat Mahmood song list earlier as well: fourteen years ago, on the occasion of what would have been his 86th birthday. But a centenary is a different matter, and it wouldn’t do, I thought, to let this opportunity pass without a tribute to Talat. Therefore, this list, of ten solos that Talat sang for ten different composers. Besides my usual criteria (that the song should be from a pre-1970s Hindi film that I’ve seen), I imposed two more restrictions on myself:\n\n1. No composer should be repeated in this list\n\n2. The songs in this list should not overlap with the ones on my earlier Talat list\n\nIn no particular order, therefore:\n\n1. Shaam-e-gham ki kasam (Footpath, 1953): With Khayyam. For me, one of the most exquisitely beautiful songs there is in Hindi cinema. The loneliness, the sense of waiting that shines through this song is not just embodied in the lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri’s, in collaboration with Ali Sardar Jafri), but equally in Khayyam’s music and in Talat’s voice. There is a controlled sort of impatience to his singing, a very good mirror of Dilip Kumar’s acting: a man aching for the woman he awaits, but trying to calm himself, trying to keep a hold on his emotions even though they slip through now and then in his words.\n\n2. Main teri nazar ka suroor hoon (Jahanara, 1964): With Madan Mohan. If Talat was the singer most associated with the ghazal, Madan Mohan was the composer most associated with the genre (it is a different matter that the definition of a ghazal has nothing to do with its music, and is all about the lyrics and their rhyming pattern). Madan Mohan composed some memorable songs for Talat, a clutch of them in Jahanara, where Bharat Bhushan, as the doomed lover Mirza Changezi, got to lip-sync to gems like Phir wohi shaam, Main teri nazar ka suroor hoon, Teri aankh ke aansoo pee jaaoon, and Ae sanam aaj yeh kasam khaayein.\n\nTalat’s voice fits Bharat Bhushan’s character and his situation very well indeed: the man who has dared to love where there is no hope. A lover proud of his love and as certain as he can be that his love is returned. That tremor in the voice which Talat was so known for is pronounced here, and perfect for the song.\n\n3. Yeh hawa yeh raat yeh chaandni (Sangdil, 1952): With Sajjad Hussain. The irascible Sajjad Hussain, though his career stretched over more than three decades, and who was undeniably talented (more so than many other contemporaries), ended up composing for very few films. He also was critical, to the point of being rude, of many whom he worked with, and bestowed epithets on them with gay abandon: poor Talat found himself dubbed ‘Galat’ Mahmood! Despite that, though, one of Talat’s finest songs was composed by Sajjad Hussain. A stunningly romantic song, a wooing of a woman who is utterly oblivious of the effect she has on her lovelorn admirer.\n\n4. Koi nahin mera is duniya mein (Daag, 1952): With Shankar-Jaikishan. Talat’s voice was the perfect fit for Dilip Kumar, as can be seen from the songs on this list: all the way from pathos to romance to angst, Talat lent his voice to the actor in a way that came across as completely natural. Dilip Kumar’s speaking voice and Talat’s singing voice, especially when one considers Dilip’s controlled, level acting, match superbly. Daag, its songs composed by the prolific duo of Shankar-Jaikishan, gave Talat several immortal songs: Hum dard ke maaron ka itna sa fasaana hai, Ae mere dil kahin aur chal, and this sad, lonely song among them. The pain in Koi nahin mera is duniya mein is palpable, and yet both Talat and Dilip (who, by the way, were good friends) do not go over the top, never get melodramatic or hammy.\n\n5. Aansoo samajhke kyon mujhe aankh se tumne (Chhaaya, 1961): With Salil Chowdhury. Was Salil Chowdhury’s straddling of Bengali and Hindi cinema, the ease with which he composed for both languages (and took tunes successfully across the border) a reason why Talat had a good equation with him? Talat, after all, had been ‘Tapan Kumar’ in Bengal, and had worked—not just sung, but also acted—in some successful Bengali films. Whatever the case may be, a shared love for and comfort with Bengali or not, the point is that they worked well together: for instance, with songs like Aha rim-jhim ke yeh pyaare-pyaare geet liye, Raat ne kya-kya khwaab dikhaaye, and Itna na mujhse tu pyaar badha, the last-named from Chhaaya. Also from Chhaaya was this beautiful song, which Talat sings for Sunil Dutt: gently pleading, dignified in the way he talks about being spurned.\n\n6. Zindagi denewaale sun teri duniya se dil bhar gaya (Dil-e-Naadaan, 1953): With Ghulam Mohammad. Talat worked in several films in the Hindi film industry, but his success rate as an actor was none too good, even if the films themselves were entertaining (Lala Rukh) or at least fairly good (Sone ki Chidiya). One thing, however, marked most of the films Talat acted in: they also featured songs sung by him, and those included some very good songs: Pyaar pas bas toh nahin; Pyaas kuchh aur bhi bhadka di; Raahi matwaale; Raat ne kya-kya khwaab dikhaaye…. and this, a woeful, despairing cry to an Almighty who seems to have turned away.\n\nI have to admit that after watching a certain episode of Jaspal Bhatti’s hilarious TV show Flop Show, which featured this song as the cry of a patient at a government hospital, I now cannot listen to Zindagi denewaale sun without grinning.\n\nBut yes, despite that: what a touching rendition of despair.\n\n7. Tasveer banaata hoon tasveer nahin banti (Baradari, 1955): With Nashad. There is an apocryphal story going around on the net that Naushad (not Nashad, who is the composer of Tasveer banaata hoon) disapproved of Talat’s smoking, and therefore shifted his allegiance from Talat to Rafi. While it sounds sensational, the truth might have been that Rafi was far more versatile than Talat: as Naushad himself remarked in an interview, the gentle, dignified style of Talat was suited to a certain type of song; he couldn’t do the sort of singing that Rafi could manage for actors like (say) Shammi Kapoor. That boisterousness, the madcap uninhibited style of Rafi or Kishore was not Talat’s.\n\nThis was more like Talat: sombre, grave, romantic—emotions the highly underrated Nashad was able to depict beautifully in his music, and Talat was able to render perfectly. Tasveer banaata hoon tasveer nahin banti is one of those classic songs that is more heard than seen. A prince, smitten with a village girl he’s only briefly glimpsed, yearns for her, to the extent of giving up everything, from sleep to composure.\n\n8. Bechain nazar betaab jigar (Yasmin, 1955): With C Ramachandra. I have a confession to make. Years ago, well before I began writing this blog and got to know something about Hindi cinema, one of my absolutely favourite Talat duets was a song composed by C Ramachandra: the wonderfully romantic Kitna haseen hai mausam, from Azaad. It wasn’t till much later that I discovered the truth (and even later before I was actually convinced): that wasn’t Talat singing that song, it was C Ramachandra himself.\n\nIf you go by that old adage about imitation being the sincerest of flattery, it’s likely that C Ramachandra admired Talat a good deal. Enough, at least, to compose some good songs for the singer. Bechain nazar betaab jigar, from Yasmin, is one I especially like: there’s a sort of joyfulness to it that is fairly rare in Talat’s songs.\n\n9. Jaayein toh jaayein kahaan (Taxi Driver, 1955): With SD Burman. I have always thought it a serious travesty of justice that SD Burman only won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director twice in what was a long and exemplary career in Hindi cinema. With his talent, and with the brilliantly versatile, melodious compositions he created, Burman Da deserved many more wins.\n\nHowever. At least he did win the award for this song. Jaayein toh jaayein kahaan, a hallmark song of woe and loneliness, was sung in two versions, by Lata Mangeshkar and by Talat Mahmood. Talat’s version, lip-synced by Dev Anand’s character as he sits by the seashore, grappling with all the worries that surround him, is the version that won SD Burman the Filmfare award. The silken softness of Talat’s voice really brings to life the emotion of the lyrics, the sense of being bereft and all alone.\n\n10. Sab kuchh lutaake hosh mein aaye (Ek Saal, 1957): With Ravi. And, to end this list, a song that I like so much, it’s appeared in several lists on this blog over the years. Like Jaayein toh jaayein kahaan, Sab kuchh lutaake hosh mein aaye too appears in two versions in the film: a male version sung by Talat and a female version sung by Lata. Ashok Kumar’s character, a conman who has his eye on a terminally ill heiress (played by Madhubala), sets out to woo her with the objective of nabbing all her wealth—but ends up, willy-nilly, falling in love with her. Here, in Talat’s gloriously mellifluous voice—the voice of conscience, literally—he faces up to the truth, to the reprehensibility of what he’s done. A gorgeous song, and one that I think couldn’t have been sung better by any other singer.\n\nAnd, because there were so many great songs that Talat sang for so many composers, a bonus song: Chal ud jaa re panchhi (Bhabhi, 1957): With Chitragupt. Through this song, I also wanted to draw attention to the fact that Talat sang a lot of non-film songs too; plenty of ghazals, for instance. Chal ud jaa re panchhi, is of course a film song; but in the film, the playback for this song was by Mohammad Rafi, not Talat."
