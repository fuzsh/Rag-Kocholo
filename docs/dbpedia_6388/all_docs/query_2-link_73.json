He happened to be one out of the famous quartet of heroes of that golden age, along with Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and the evergreen Ashok Kumar. More than his core acting abilities, Dev Anand was remembered more for his sheer handsomeness and an unbroken style of delivering dialogues with subtle and sudden modulations, and a fascination for nodding while delivering. Yet he had hit films to his credit, one after the other, in the 100 plus films that he had acted in, most of which had him as the central male protagonist.\n\nLike most of his famous contemporaries, Dev Anand also came from Punjab, and having completed his graduation in English Literature, he moved over to Mumbai for a job in the early 1940s. This seems to have been a happy coincidence for him, as his older brother Chetan, who was already in Mumbai and an active member of the Indian People's Theater Association (IPTA), encouraged Dev into the performing arts. Dev himself was also inspired by seeing films and nursed a desire to emulate famous actors of his time like Ashok Kumar. His own break came in the 1946 movie “Hum Ek Hain” produced by Prabhat films, whose production team was won over by his handsome looks and were confident of his making the grade in a film career. As luck would have it, during the making of the film he struck up a friendship with the famous Guru Dutt who also went on to become one of the renowned producer director and actors of the period.\n\nThis association resulted in so many hit films over the next 10 years, starting with the 1951 film, “Baazi”, which incidentally was the very second film of Dev’s own production House Nav Ketan. This film was directed by Guru Dutt, and its tremendous success propelled Dev onto the front lines of Hindi cinema. This was followed in 1952 by “Jaal”, which like Baazi was another big musical hit. Even though Guru Dutt himself got busy as an actor, the Dev Anand – Guru Dutt co-operation continued through director Raj Khosla, who was Guru Dutt’s chief assistant and whom he seems to have specially earmarked for Dev’s films, like “CID” (1956) and “Kala Paani” in 1958.\n\nLike Dev’s association with Guru Dutt, his working together with the singing star Surayya in late 1940s also raised a lot of ripples, for its perceived romantic overtones, the duo having worked in seven films, one after the other between 1948 and 1951, including hits like “Afsar” (1950) and ending with “Do Sitare” . Likewise, Ashok Kumar too had a hand in boosting the career of Dev, after the latter had become typified as an actresses’ hero in the 40s. It was in “Ziddi”(1948) that Ashok Kumar, with his Bombay Talkies’ connections, selected Dev to be the hero, and it worked wonderfully well with the film becoming a overnight hit. This film also marked the beginning of Kishore Kumar becoming the singing voice of Dev Anand, an association that lasted till the legendary singer’s death.\n\nTo recount the life of a legend like Dev Anand, is not easy, and one can hardly do justice to his entire career, studded as it was with so many hits. The films from a more serious genre that would obviously remain in people’s minds would be “Guide” in 1968 based on R.K. Narayan’s famous novel; and the earlier “Hum Dono” in 1961, and “Kala Pani” in both of which he has given sensitive portrayals. On the lighter and romantic side were “CID” in 1956 and “Jewel Thief” in 1968 both being crime thrillers and “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” in 1971 which saw Dev in his directorial debut.\n\nDuring a long career, as long as his, it was natural to have to his name a string of awards and honours, but more than any of these would be his inimitable style that would remain in the minds and hearts of his fans for years to come.\n\n...\n\nFor Danny Denzongpa the voyage to the glittering world of films from distant Gangtok in Sikkim, where he was born and had his preliminary education, was quite eventful. In fact his entry into a film career was in many ways a matter of unexpected coincidence. Finishing college from Darjeeling, West Bengal, he made it to the prestigious Armed Forces Medical College in Pune, for he had always dreamed, like many from his region, to join the Indian Army. This desire was perhaps fuelled by his bagging the Best Cadet Award from West Bengal, and in being selected for the annual Republic Day parade in New Delhi. However, once in Pune, he switched over to the Film Institute instead of the Armed Forces College. That is when Tshering Phintso Denzongpa of Gangtok became the future “Danny” Denzongpa of the Mumbai film world. He had decided to change his name to a simpler sounding \"Danny\" as he realized that his original name would have been difficult to be pronounced once he entered films.\n\nDanny’s film career due to its sheer length of 44 years and 200 plus films cannot be accommodated in a brief profile of his, but the high points of his career and sheer variety of his roles can be discussed, as well as the vicissitudes of his career. Although he had to manage with B-grade movies on his entry in 1971, just 2 years into his career, he drew attention for the role of crippled husband, emoting his frustrations, in “Dhundh” During the entire 70s he displayed his versatility, making a clear mark for himself in the industry. In fact, he portrayed as much of positive roles as he did villainous ones, narrowly missing the role of Gabbar Singh in “Sholay” due to a mix up of shooting dates. In 1978 a major landmark came in his career for his role in “Devata” (1978) which saw him get substantial roles after that including big budget ones. However, in the beginning of the 1980s he suddenly lost interest in films, being type cast in villainous roles with the same setting over and over again.\n\nThis spell was broken briefly when he directed the Rajesh Khanna starrer “Phir Wohi Raat” for N.N. Sippy in 1980, but although he went on getting any number of roles he wanted, most of them were not to his liking, as they seemed to be carbon copies of similar roles he had done previously. In between, however, there was something more satisfying for him when he made an international appearance in “Seven Years in Tibet”, co-starring with the redoubtable Brad Pitt. Danny, however, reduced his appearances at the turn of the century and between 2003 and 2009 starred in only 10 movies, with very few appearances thereafter. Any profile of Danny would be incomplete without the mention that he was not only an accomplished singer for Nepali songs, but has sung alongside Lata, Asha and Mohd Rafi in Hindi films too.\n\n...\n\nShah Rukh Khan or also known as SRK is a prominent Indian film actor, television personality and producer.
