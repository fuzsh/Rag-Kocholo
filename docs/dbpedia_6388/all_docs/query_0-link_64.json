        "text": "This book could not have been put together without the support of numerous individuals and institutions. In addition to the exemplary set of contributors who agreed to submit original manuscripts to this volume, there are others to be thanked. To begin with, the Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois remains an extremely generous supporter of all my endeavors. Under the leadership of both Clifford Christians and Paula Treichler, ICR provided the resources necessary to carry out this project. Outstanding assistance from Marie Claire Leger, Robert Sloane, Diem-my Bui, Susan Harewood, and Liz Perea was indispensable. A fellowship from the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities (IPRH) provided the space and the forum to begin to write the salsa project. The Centre of Latin American Studies at the University of Cambridge, England provided a home during my sabbatical year when I commissioned and put together the bulk of this volume. I am intellectually indebted to Denis McQuail whose introductory volumes to communications theory remain, for me, the most accessible and comprehensive available in our interdiscipline. The breadth and depth of this volume speaks to the wonderful education and collaborations I have had from and with many colleagues in our ﬁeld. Finally, Cameron McCarthy’s continuing advice, help, and encouragement helped make this a better book. If I do not mention my three children, Rhiannon, Tobin, and Ailín, one or all of them would be eternally cross with me. All shortcomings, of course, are purely my own. Here i share this book. hope everyone can enjoy\n\nToday, arguably more than at any time in the past, media are the key players in contributing to what defines reality for the citizens of Europe and beyond.
