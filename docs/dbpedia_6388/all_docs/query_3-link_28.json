        "text": "Just a river separates Gadiara from Geonkhali, the first in Howrah district, the second in Purba Medinipur. When we say ‘a river’, however, we actually mean three. Because three rivers – Hooghly, Rupnarayan, and Damodar – meet here, at two different points, and then flow on toward the sea as the Hooghly.\n\nA fisherman’s tale\n\nGadiara is fairly close to Kolkata, as you can imagine, a mere 85 km or so. And a very fine destination it is, too. The river is broad and brimming with clean, flowing water. The riverbank is lined with beautiful trees which offer ample shade should you wish to merely sit beneath them and stare at the churning waters. For the activity-oriented tourist, there’s always a boat ride down the Hooghly. And you can actually see three differently coloured streams as the three rivers meet and merge. Before you get into that boat, however, you should know that owing to the confluence of the three rivers, the currents here are particularly strong. Moreover, the occasional waves created by larger vessels will quite literally rock the boat, so your boat ride could well turn into an adventure.\n\nSailing through\n\nFor history enthusiasts, a visit to the old fort built by Robert Clive is a must visit, as is the old lighthouse. To be fair, however, almost nothing remains of Clive’s Fort Mornington apart from a few brick walls, thanks to riverine erosion.\n\nA ferry will take you across the river to Geonkhali, once again a charming destination which granta you access to Mahishadal Rajbari, and the ancient city of Tamralipta (Tamluk), though the palace, too, is more or less in ruins. One other attraction is the ancient Bargabheema Temple.\n\nThe solitary sailor\n\nHow to get there\n\nPlenty of options from Kolkata. Once train services resume post the Covid-19 lockdown, you can catch a train to Bagnan, and travel onward by bus. Or you could take a bus from Kolkata itself. And if you have your own conveyance, nothing like a road trip all the way to Nurpur, from where a launch will take you around Gadiara and Geonkhali.\n\nRoopmanjari Tourism Property, Gadiara\n\nWhere to stay\n\nShould you wish to spend more than a day, and we would heartily recommend a weekend trip, there’s the riverside Roopmanjari Tourism Property (earlier Rupnarayan Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. For bookings and other details, contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nAradhana (1969)\n\nIn November 2019, actors Dev and Paoli Dam were in Darjeeling, shooting for their Bengali film ‘Sanjhbati’, which eventually had a world television premiere in October 2020, amidst the Covid pandemic. As delighted locals and tourists thronged the shooting spot at Darjeeling Chowrasta, it was heard that actors Rajat Kapoor and Mumtaz Sorcar were also shooting at nearby Takdah Cantonment, in Rangli Rangliot CD block of Darjeeling Sadar subdivision. Incidentally, Takdah (sometimes spelt as Tukda or Tukdah) is rapidly gaining in popularity as a tourist destination. What’s more, Takdah also hosted a shoot with actors Taapsee Pannu and Ravi Mohan in November 2019.\n\nKanchenjungha (1962)\n\nOur point is that Darjeeling, a highly popular shooting destination for Bollywood and Tollywood alike for decades, seems to be making a comeback on the silver screen. ‘Comeback’, because the political agitation in the hills had been keeping film crews away, a fear that the West Bengal Tourism Department has been working hard to alleviate. Thankfully, the department’s efforts seem to be paying off, as more and more film crews scout in and around Darjeeling for suitable locations.\n\nSagina Mahato (1970)\n\nWith the return of the tinsel town brigade, Darjeeling could once again become popular on the film tourism map, too. As many who have been to Darjeeling over the years will testify, it used to be customary for tourist guides to take their charges around the various popular shooting locations in town. And there were many of these on display, considering that among the earliest Bollywood productions to be shot in Darjeeling was Barsaat (1949). After a brief lull, there was a positive deluge in the 1960s, with Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai (1961), Kanchenjungha (1962), Professor (1962), Hariyali Aur Raasta (1962), China Town (1962), Aye Din Bahaar Ke (1966), Hamraaz (1967), Baharon Ki Manzil (1968), Jhuk Gaya Asmaan (1968), Mahal (1969), and Aradhana (1969).\n\nSanjhbati (2019)\n\nAlso read : Kagey, the village with a view\n\nIn the 1970s, the most notable Hindi film to be shot in Darjeeling was Tapan Sinha’s Sagina Mahato (1970), remade in Hindi as Sagina (1974), though a major part of both films was shot in Kurseong, near Darjeeling. Then there was Amitabh Bachchan’s Do Anjaane (1976), and Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh (1979), an adaptation of the Bengali hit Deya Neya. Lahu Ke Do Rang (1979) was entirely shot in Darjeeling.\n\nKahaani 2 (2016)\n\nThe 1980s and 90s were relatively idle, with the occasional Barsaat Ki Ek Raat/ Anusandhan (1982) and Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992). But the 2000s and 2010s saw a revival, with such large-scale productions as Mr and Mrs Iyer (2002), Main Hoon Na (2004), Parineeta (2005), Via Darjeeling (2008), Barfi (2012), Kahaani 2 (2016), and Jagga Jasoos (2016). And that’s just Bollywood. We haven’t touched Tollywood simply because the list is too long! Had the Covid pandemic not thrown a spanner in the works, it is quite possible that 2020 would have seen quite a bit of shooting in Darjeeling, too.\n\nBarfi (2012)\n\nNow that we have put all this in a nutshell for you, all that you have to do is make that trip and see it all for yourselves. By air, you can fly from Kolkata to Bagdogra and complete the rest of the journey by road. By train, the easiest way to get to Darjeeling is to board a train at Howrah or Sealdah, alight at New Jalpaiguri, and go on by road. Or you could simply drive all the way from Kolkata, covering a distance of 617 km, which would take approximately 20 hours, with adequate stops along the way.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation runs the beautiful Meghbalika Tourism Property (formerly Darjeeling Tourist Lodge) which offers excellent accommodation at extremely reasonable rates. You need to get in touch with WBTDCL for reservations and clarifications, and here’s how you can do that:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach\n\nOne of West Bengal’s most popular tourist destinations, Digha in Purba Medinipur is indeed the Brighton of the east, for those who have heard of the famed English beach resort. There are several reasons behind the enduring popularity of Digha, but the principal factor is probably its accessibility from Kolkata, mostly by road, but also by rail.\n\nThe invigorating sea breeze, a walk along the beach at New Digha, browsing around the shops at old Digha, and snacking on fried fish on the promenade… all of it while staying at Dighali Tourism Property I (formerly Digha Tourist Lodge) run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, along with its sister property, Dighali Tourism Property II.\n\nThose with first hand experience will know that the seaside is particularly beautiful in the monsoons, and Dighali Tourism Property I is a mere five-minute walk from the beach. So, provided it isn’t raining too hard, you can slip out for a walk any time.\n\nOriginally known as Beerkul during the time of Governor-General Warren Hastings (1772-85), Digha was ‘discovered’ by the British in the late 18th century, and Hastings himself described it as the ‘Brighton of the East’ in one of his letters to his wife.\n\nEnglish businessman John Frank Smith reportedly began living here in 1923, and his writings provided further exposure to what was originally a seaside village. In the 1950s, Smith convinced West Bengal Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop Digha as a beach resort. Today, an old church can still be seen near the Old Digha Main gate.\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is located close to most of Digha’s other principal attractions too, and offers 28 AC rooms, ranging from standard double rooms to second-floor suites. These suites offer a fantastic view of the sea, though the ground-floor rooms look out onto the casuarina plantations which line the beach, impeding a direct view of the sea. All rooms have private balconies, as well as all modern amenities. There is also an expansive green lawn decorated with lovely flowers and seasonal plants, with a play area for children. The property’s multi-cuisine restaurant looks out onto the beachfront.\n\nTake in the beach at New Digha (2 km), and its Science Centre set up by the National Council of Science Museums. Also nearby is the fascinating Marine Aquarium and Research Centre, established in 1989 with the objective of displaying the marine biodiversity of the region and making people aware of its importance, as well as conducting research activities.\n\nYet another popular destination is the Chandaneswar Shiva Temple about 8 km away, close to the border with Odisha, and the Jagannath Deul at Dihibahiri about an hour and 15 minutes by road, where you can see the beautiful 16th-century shrine to the deity built by king Bhimsen Mahapatra of Odisha.\n\nDigha can also be your base for day trips to nearby seaside locations like Shankarpur (15 km), Tajpur (19 km), and Mandarmani (30 km).\n\nDighali Tourism Property I is 182 km southwest of Kolkata by road, with the journey taking about five hours. There are government and private buses leaving at frequent intervals from various points in Kolkata, including the Dharmatala bus terminus. You may also drive down in your own or a hired vehicle.\n\nFor those wishing to make a train journey, there are a number of options from Howrah, including the Digha Duronto Express. The journey takes about three hours, and Dighali Tourism Property I is literally just 15 minutes from Digha railway station.\n\nIts colonial past is certainly not the only heritage that Bengal boasts of\n\nHeritage is about a sense of pride in one’s past, heritage is about aesthetics, heritage is about linking past to present. However, heritage can also be a prime revenue earner, thanks to heritage tourism. Indeed, there are states in India, and countries around the world, for whom heritage tourism is among the top revenue earners. And West Bengal’s diverse heritage makes it a prime candidate for this brand of tourism, both domestic and international.\n\nTo begin with, while the colonial heritage of Kolkata is frequently in focus, this is among the most recent chapters in the state’s history. The ancient and medieval heritage of Bengal lies in its districts, predating the British and other Europeans by centuries. In many areas of Bankura, for instance, evidence has been found of human habitation dating back to the Chalcolithic (Copper) and Mesolithic (Middle Stone) ages. Taken together, this means approximately between 8,000 and 3,000 years before Christ. That apart, there are at least three former capital cities of Bengal in three districts outside Kolkata – Murshidabad, Malda, and Nadia, ruled over by Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim monarchs during various eras.\n\nGiven this long and varied history, it would be a pity if you were to confine your travels to only a few areas. We thought of picking out some of the state’s top heritage destinations from the pre-colonial era and compiling a list to start you off:\n\nMALDA\n\nRenowned for its mangos, Malda was once known as Gour, the capital of Bengal, founded by King Shashanka in the 7th century AD. Today, the ruins of Gour are still seen in Malda district. Gour became known as Lakhnauti during the Sena dynasty, and gradually became synonymous with Bengal and Bengalis, until it was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1204. In fact, ancient Gour and Pandua (Pundravardhana) are the two cities which formed the capital of Bengal in ancient and medieval ages and today they are equidistant, north and south, from modern day English Bazar.\n\nYou will also see remnants of Islamic architecture, dating between the 14th and 17th centuries, in Gour and neighbouring Adina. That apart, Pandua boasts the third largest concentration of ancient Muslim monuments in Bengal. Its landmarks include the Jami Masjid (1566) and the magnificent Nimasari tower across the river. The Malda Museum has a great collection of the region’s architectural and anthropological specimens. And then you have Baroduari or Boro Sona Mosque, Dakhil Darwaza, the 26-metre high Firoze Minar, Lukochuri Gate, Chika Mosque, and Kadam Rasul Mosque. In Pandua you will find the Kutubshahi Mosque and Eklakhi Mausoleum. And at Jagjibanpur (36 km from Malda town) are more ancient ruins, including that of a Buddhist monastery. Easily accessible from Kolkata by road and rail, Malda also offers excellent accommodation in the form of Amrapali Tourism Property (formerly Malda Tourist Lodge). For bookings, contact +91 97330 08792 or tourismmalda@kcbetasite\n\nMURSHIDABAD\n\nIf you were to draw up a list of the architectural wonders of Bengal, Murshidabad district would probably top it. Remember, we are talking about a former capital of Bengal, before the British founded Calcutta and made it the capital. The story goes that Robert Clive, the man behind the East India Company’s takeover of India, was wonderstruck by the sheer richness of Murshidabad city, and exclaimed that he had never seen any city as grand, even in Europe.\n\nThere is so much to see that one trip may not be enough. Among the most notable attractions are Hazarduari (literally, thousand doors) Palace, built in 1837 by British architect Duncan McLeod for Najib Humayun Jah, a descendant of Mir Jafar. Also on your must visit list should be Katra Mosque, the final resting place of Nawab Murshid Quli Khan.\n\nBe sure to drop in at Kathgola Palace, the ancestral home of the enormously wealthy Jagat Seth family, once known as ‘bankers to the world’. Neither can you miss Moti Jheel palace (where Siraj imprisoned his aunt Mehrunnisa for her links to the British), Nasipur Palace (built by Raja Kirtichand Bahadur, a businessman from Panipat who earned notoriety as a tax collector for the British), and Khosh Bagh (containing the graves of Nawab Alivardi Khan, his mother, Siraj-ud-Daulah, and his wife Lutfannessa). And your trip would be incomplete without a visit to Kashimbazar, and the royal palace of Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandy. Further north is Kashimbazar Chhoto Rajbari, and ten Shiva temples near Katiganga. There are several other attractions such as Medina Masjid, Nizamat Imambara (possibly India’s largest), and Jafraganj Cemetery. Visitors to Murshidabad can use Bohor Tourism Property in Baharampur as their base to get around.\n\nBANKURA\n\nMost people tend to equate Bishnupur with Bankura, perhaps with good reason, but there is just so much more to see across this large and fascinating district. On the one hand, of course, there are the terracotta temples of Bishnupur, instantly recognisable for their distinctive and completely unique architectural style. Then there is the Bishnupur Museum, the repository of many of the district’s most interesting historical artefacts, with an entire gallery dedicated to the Bishnupur gharana, the only Indian classical music tradition born in Bengal.\n\nBut Bankura is also perhaps the most ancient part of Bengal, thanks to such locations as Susunia Hill, an ancient geographical formation located between Bankura and Purulia. Part of the Eastern Ghats, the hill is 10 km north-east of Chhatna, which is 13 km from Bankura town. Set amidst a spectacular landscape of lavish greenery and red soil, Susunia Hill rises to a height of approximately 1200 feet. It is popular for its archaeological artefacts, such as the mysterious plant and animal fossils scattered here and there, or the occasional discovery of ancient tools, and the ‘oldest’ rock inscription of West Bengal.\n\nBankura is once again easy to access by road and rail from Kolkata, and Bishnupur Tourism Property (earlier Bishnupur Tourist Lodge) is an excellent place to stay.\n\nSince we don’t wish to spoil all the surprises for you, we have offered mere glimpses into the wondrous heritage of Bengal. The rest, you will see for yourself. For bookings and all relevant information, do contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd\n\nDG Block, Sector-II, Salt Lake\n\nKolkata 700091\n\nPhone: (033) 2358 5189, Fax: 2359 8292\n\nIn ancient times, the region that constitutes Birbhum now, was part of Rarh region (land of red and laterite soil) and a fringe area was in Vajrabhoomi (land of the thunderbolt), which was the eastern part of Chhotanagpur Plateau. It was in 1798 when the British formally set up Birbhum (‘Bir’ meaning brave and ‘Bhum’ which means land), the land of the brave. ‘Bir’ in Santhali means forest, so this could have been derived from Santhali language as well since the Santhal tribes have been living in this tract since pre-historic times.\n\nAbout 25 km from Siuri, is a small hamlet Kochuighata, home to Mahali tribe. Locals identify the village as Mouli Para. The Mahalis originally hailed from Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh but relocated to Bengal and since then, have been living there for generations. The word ‘Mahali’ is derived from the Santhali word, ‘Maad’ (bamboo). In India, basket weaving is an ancient art. Indigenous communities developed special shapes and patterns of baskets based on their local traditions, needs and techniques.\n\nThe Mahalis are artisans and craftsmen who have been excelling in bamboo craft. They have been weaving bamboo baskets and other household items including items like mats, kulo, Jhanpi etc. Their conical baskets are used for carrying and square or round bottomed ones for storage. The jhanpi is a traditional sun-shade that continues to be the most well-known of bamboo items. Kulo is a bamboo tray used for separating chaff from grain and also used in almost all traditional Bengali festivals and occasions from wedding to pujo, from rice ceremony to Jamai sasthi. The Mahalis are equally adept at making stunning and innovative bamboo craft items.\n\nThere are sub-classes among the Mahalis based on their area of specialization and include Banshpada Mahali, Patar Mahali, Ghashi Mahali, Salyunki Mahali, Tanti Mahali, Munda Mahali, Oraon Mahali and Kol Mahali. Although their mother tongue is Mahali, which is very similar to Santhali, they are apt at adapting the local language and speak fluently in Sadri, Mundari and Bengali. Although the Mahalis celebrate their specific tribal rituals and festivals that include offering prayers to Borpahari and Manasa Devi, they are Hindus. Through generations, the Mahalis have relocated to different parts of the country over generations and have been flexible to changes, blending with the local culture, rituals and language.\n\nAs you enter the Mouli Para locality in Kochuighata, you will see both males and females are preoccupied dabbling with bamboo. The production of cane and bamboo articles involves the cutting of whole stems with a hack saw and slicing them into splits of various sizes using a bill hook or dao. Men usually handle this. The bamboo is then sliced longitudinally along the length of the densely packed fibres. Some are seen heating the cane on a slow fire for flexibility.\n\nThe craftsmen make objects in two different forms: some coil bamboo and cane for baskets and some weave painstakingly for mats. In coiled basketry, the foundation of the basket is built first by coiling a cane round a central core. It is built up spirally and gradually the width is increased until the desired height is attained. The coils are joined together by sewing strips which can be attached in two ways: each stitch passed over the new portion of the foundation coil. Thus coil material is sewn with the strips and a basket is made. Even the kids hover around their parents and playfully get their early training from the experts.\n\nThere are about 10 to 15 families, engaged in this craft. The Mahalis work in the agricultural sector for sustenance and hold on to their traditional craft. Phoolrani Mahali, an expert bamboo craftsperson says, “People admire and praise the bamboo products made by us. People from the cities also appreciate our craftsmanship. We make bamboo items not just as a means of livelihood but also because we love the craft. It gives us a feeling of fulfilment because we are keeping alive an ancient indigenous craft form through our work.”\n\nLeading artisans are making diversified products which are marked by finesse and have good market. The craft has huge potential as it is eco-friendly, presentable, relatively cheap and light weight. However, due to lack of supply of raw material and easy availability of substitutes like plastic, the demand for bamboo products in the national and international market is quite low.\n\nIn a tropical country like ours, summer really isn’t the season for travel, or so says conventional wisdom. However, the advantage of living in a state like West Bengal is that you really need not travel very far away from home to find a destination of your choice – whether it is the seaside, or mountains, or forests, or places of archaeological and historical interest, or even places of religious interest.\n\nWith summer almost upon us, we thought it would be a good idea to present you with 10 of the state’s topmost summer destinations, in no particular order, but split up into two articles. So here are the first five:\n\nKurseong\n\nNot many perhaps know this, but Kurseong is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal. It became an independent municipality in 1879, and did not become a subdivision until 1890, when Darjeeling was formed as a separate district. Today, Kurseong town and municipality remain part of Darjeeling district, and the town also functions as the headquarters of Kurseong subdivision.\n\nBlessed with pleasant weather throughout the year, Kurseong is 34 km from Siliguri, connected both by road and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The nearest airport is Bagdogra and the nearest major railway station is New Jalpaiguri, about 45 km away. Nestled among the lower Himalayas and famed for schools such as Goethals, Kurseong offers plenty by way of natural beauty, particularly its waterfalls or ‘kholas’. That apart, it is close to such world renowned tea gardens as Makaibari and Castleton, which are important names on West Bengal’s tea tourism trail.\n\nFor Bengalis, Kurseong is also memorable as the town where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was interned by the British in the late 1930s. The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Museum and NSC Bose Institute of Asiatic Studies were later set up in a house belonging to Netaji’s elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in the Giddhapahar area. The museum displays priceless artifacts related to Netaji’s life, including photocopies of letters between Netaji and his future wife, Emilie Schenkel, rare photographs of the Indian National Army (INA), and other memorabilia.\n\nSet amidst the blue hills, Roudra Chhaya Tourism Property (earlier Kurseong Tourist Lodge) operated by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd (WBTDCL) is an excellent accommodation option when you visit.\n\nMirik\n\nWay back in 1969, the state tourism department began the process of acquiring 335 acres of land from Thurbo tea estate, adjacent to Mirik. In 1974, when Siddhartha Shankar Ray was chief minister of West Bengal, work began on developing this land into a tourist spot, to include Mirik’s famous lake, which is its principal tourist attraction. The complex around the lake was inaugurated by Ray’s successor as chief minister, Jyoti Basu, in April 1979. Tourism in the area has flourished ever since, thanks in large measure to Mirik’s lovely climate, natural beauty, and easy accessibility.\n\nThe centre of attraction as we said, is Sumendu Lake, surrounded by a garden named Savitri Pushpaudyan (named after Savitri Thapa, an INA martyr) on one side and pine trees on the other, linked together by a footbridge called Indreni Pool (named after Indreni Thapa, another INA). The nearly 3.5 km-long road which encircles the lake and is perfect for long walks, and offers a view of Mt Kanchenjunga on the horizon. Also on offer are boating and horse riding.\n\nThe highest point in Mirik is Boker Monastery, at an altitude of about 5,800 ft. The lake is Mirik’s lowest point, at about 4,900 ft. Mirik is 52 km from Siliguri city and about an equal distance from Darjeeling town. Bagdogra airport is also about 52 km away, and New Jalpaiguri adjacent to Siliguri is the nearest major railway station. A rudimentary bus service also operates from Mirik to Siliguri and Darjeeling, or there are plenty of shared cabs available for those so inclined.\n\nDarjeeling\n\nNot much can be said about Darjeeling that has not been said already. Suffice it to say that it has remained an eternal favourite with every category of tourist as both a summer and winter destination. Not for nothing has it earned the sobriquet, ‘Queen of the Hills’, and not for nothing are tourism and tea the two economic pillars of the area. The name ‘Darjeeling’ comes from the Tibetan words ‘dorje’ (thunderbolt) and ‘ling’ (place or land), meaning ‘land of the thunderbolt’, and Darjeeling’s long and chequered history is linked to that of Sikkim, the British East India Company, Nepal, and Bhutan.\n\nAs early as 1860, Darjeeling had already become an important tourist destination, and remains among the few locations in eastern India to draw large numbers of foreign tourists. In fact, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway has long been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, only the second railway in the world to be thus honoured, and has been the subject of an award-winning BBC documentary.\n\nIn the 1980s and 2000s, the tourism industry was rocked by political instability in the region, but matters have improved since 2012. According to a survey published in December 2015, Darjeeling is the third most Googled travel destination in India.\n\nIt has also long been a popular filming destination for Bollywood and Bengali cinema. Satyajit Ray shot his film Kanchenjunga (1962) here, and his Feluda story Darjeeling Jomjomat was also set in the town. Big-budget Bollywood movies such as Aradhana (1969), Main Hoon Na (2004), Parineeta (2005) and Barfi! (2012) have also been filmed here.\n\nThe West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation runs the beautiful Meghbalika Tourism Property (formerly Darjeeling Tourist Lodge) which offers excellent accommodation at extremely reasonable rates.\n\nKalimpong\n\nKalimpong is a town, municipality, and the headquarters of Kalimpong district. The district region falls under the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, and has become a popular tourist destination owing to its temperate climate, beautiful environment, and proximity to other popular tourist destinations in the region.\n\nOne of Kalimpong’s claims to fame is horticulture, which produces a wide array of absolutely stunning orchids. Its nurseries export Himalayan grown flower bulbs, tubers and rhizomes, all of which contribute to Kalimpong’s economy. The Tibetan Buddhist monastery Zang Dhok Palri Phodang, another tourist attraction, houses a number of rare Tibetan Buddhist scriptures.\n\nKalimpong’s town centre sits on a ridge connecting two hills, Deolo Hill and Durpin Hill, at an altitude of about 4,000 ft. Deolo or Delo, the highest point in Kalimpong, has an altitude of about 5,591 ft, and is worthy of a trip in itself. Mt Kanchenjunga, the world’s third highest peak at 28,169 ft, is clearly visible from Kalimpong, provided the clouds aren’t in the way.\n\nPedong\n\nPedong lies 20 km east of Kalimpong on the way to Lava at an altitude of roughly 4,0oo ft. The town, which is located on a ridge, commands a spectacular view of Mt Kanchenjunga and other Himalayan mountains. Pedong is also historically important as it lies on the ancient Silk Road, which connects India to Lhasa via the Jelepla Pass.\n\nNear Pedong are the ruins of Damsang Gadi, a historical fort built in 1690 by the Lepchas. After the Anglo-Bhutan War of 1864, the fort fell into disuse and decay. Damsang fort is the only fort in the entire district of Darjeeling, and was home to Gyabo Achuk, the last Lepcha king.\n\nAnother attraction here is Cross Hill, featuring a cross erected by Fr. Augustine Desgodins in memory of evangelists who had gone missing in Tibet, in the hope that someday they may return. Cross Hill offers a superb view of the mountains facing it, as well as the borders of Tibet and China.\n\nAlso of interest is the Sangchen Dorjee Monastery, one of the oldest in the Pedong-Kalimpong region, built during Bhutanese rule in the early 1700s. It has now become the centre of Shabdrung Rimpoche (known as the ‘Dharma Raja’ of Bhutan). The monastery is an important pilgrimage for the Bhutanese and other followers of the Drukpa Khargu Buddhist tradition.\n\nVillages near Pedong include Sakyong, Kasyong, Dalep, Kagey, Upper Menchu and Lower Menchu.\n\nFor visitors to both Pedong and Kalimpong, the WBTDCL’s Hilltop Tourism Property (earlier Hill Top Tourist Lodge) offers excellent accommodation.\n\nFor booking and other details of all the above locations, do contact\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189\n\nEmail: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: https://www.wbtdcl.com/\n\nKurseong is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal\n\nKurseong, whether in the sun or in the rains, is an experience worth writing a book about, as anyone who has been there will tell you. And your visit will only be made more memorable by a stay at the poetically named Roudra Chhaya Tourism Property (formerly Kurseong Tourist Lodge), run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDCL). The already beautiful property is made even more attractive by its restaurant, which offers a clear view of the world’s third highest peak, Mount Kanchenjunga. As a bonus, the restaurant serves the gorgeously flavoured and world renowned Makaibari tea along with another of its specialties, mouthwatering momos.\n\nNot many perhaps know this, but Kurseong is one of the oldest municipalities in West Bengal. It became an independent municipality in 1879, and did not become a subdivision until 1890, when Darjeeling was formed as a separate district. Today, Kurseong town and municipality remain part of Darjeeling district, and the town also functions as the headquarters of Kurseong subdivision.\n\nBlessed with pleasant weather throughout the year, Kurseong is 34 km from Siliguri, connected both by road and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, or the famous toy train. The nearest airport is Bagdogra and the nearest major railway station is New Jalpaiguri. Nestled among the lower Himalayas and famed for schools such as Goethals, Kurseong offers plenty of natural beauty, particularly its waterfalls or ‘kholas’. That apart, it is close to such world renowned tea gardens as Makaibari and Castleton, which are important names on West Bengal’s tea tourism trail.\n\nFor Bengalis, Kurseong is also memorable as the town where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was interned by the British in the late 1930s. The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Museum and NSC Bose Institute of Asiatic Studies were later set up in a house belonging to Netaji’s elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose in the Giddhapahar area. The museum displays priceless artefacts related to Netaji’s life, including photocopies of letters between Netaji and his future wife, Emilie Schenkel, rare photographs of the Indian National Army (INA), and other memorabilia.\n\nIn order to truly enjoy all of this, you must stay at Roudra Chhaya Tourism Property for a few days, if only to enhance your Kurseong experience with the Makaibari tea and momos. In fact, so popular has the wooden-floored restaurant become that its 40 seats are quite often occupied by guests not even staying at the property. With a floor area of 57 sq m, it is open for service from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm, and at a per head cost of only Rs 300, offers delicious fare at extremely reasonable rates.\n\nKurseong is 53 km from New Jalpaiguri junction, from where plenty of cars/jeeps are available. You can also travel from Darjeeling on the toy train, available twice a day. For those wishing to fly, the nearest airport to Kurseong is Bagdogra, about 40 km away.\n\nFor bookings and more details, do contact:\n\nWest Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nUdayachal Tourist Lodge\n\nDG Block (1st floor), Sec II, Salt Lake, Kolkata – 700091\n\nPhone: 033 2358 5189 Email: visitwestbengal@yahoo.co.in, mdwbtdc@gmail.com, dgmrwbtdc@gmail.com\n\nThe line opened between Siliguri and Kurseong in August 1880\n\nThere are quite a few landmark years in the history of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR). The first of these is 1878, when Franklin Prestage proposed a narrow gauge (610 mm) hill tramway to Darjeeling from the recently built Northern Bengal Railway terminus in Siliguri. The idea was to reduce the haulage rates of commodities (such as rice) to Darjeeling and improve the viability of local industries (such as tea). The government supported the scheme to reduce road maintenance costs.\n\nBy August 1880, the line had opened to the public between Siliguri and Kurseong. Larger Class 2 (later Class A) locomotives were ordered from Sharp Stewart, UK and delivered in 1882-3. In July 1881, the extended line from Kurseong to Darjeeling was opened by Sir Ashley Eden, Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and in 1882, the first full year of operations, DHR had carried 8,000 passengers and 380 tonnes of freight.\n\nFrom then on, the numbers simply continued to grow. By 1930, despite increasing competition from private cars and buses, DHR was still carrying 258,000 passengers and 80,000 tonnes of freight annually. Post-Independence in 1948, the Government of India purchased DHR on October 20 and the line was absorbed into the Indian Railways.\n\nThe first major crisis that DHR faced was in 1992, when competition from road haulage and interruption to services in previous years finally ended freight traffic, and Indian Railways decided to close DHR. Local citizens led by Sherab Tenduf-la, owner of the famed Windamere Hotel, set up the DHR Heritage Foundation and organised a series of stakeholder workshops. Thanks to their continued efforts, closure plans were abandoned in 1994, and in 1999, UNESCO declared DHR a World Heritage Site.\n\nRunning between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling today, the DHR climbs from about 100 m (330 ft) to about 2,200 m (7,200 ft), using six zigzags and five loops to gain altitude, including the famous Batasia Loop, where a small market has sprung up to cater to tourists on the train. Six diesel locomotives handle most of the scheduled service, with daily tourist trains from Darjeeling to Ghum India’s highest railway station – and there is also a special steam-hauled Red Panda service from Darjeeling to Kurseong. These specials are hauled by vintage British B-Class steam locomotives.\n\nWe don’t want to spoil the DHR experience by giving all of it away. You must come and experience the ride for yourself. While here, stay at the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation’s beautiful Meghbalika Tourism Property (formerly Darjeeling Tourist Lodge) which offers excellent accommodation at extremely reasonable rates.
