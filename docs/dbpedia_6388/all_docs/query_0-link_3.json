        "text": "'Gopi' (1970)\n\nGopi, directed by A Bhimsingh, starred Kumar, Banu, Pran, Om Prakash, Nirupa Roy, and Lalita Pawar, among others. It is a remake of the Kannada movie Chinnada Gombe (simultaneously shot in Tamil as Muradan Muthu). Gopi's synopsis reads, \"Unorthodox, honest, simple-minded, and unemployed Gopi is blamed for a theft he did not commit and gets thrown out of his home by his elder step-brother.\"\n\n'Sagina Mahato' (1970)\n\nTapan Sinha's Sagina Mahato is best remembered for Kumar's portrayal of the titular character, the trade union leader of a factory in Siliguri, while Banu played Lalita. This Bengali-language film was a major box office success and drew its inspiration from the labor movement of the early 1940s. It holds a 7.9/10 rating on IMDb. It was later remade in Hindi as Sagina (1974).\n\n'Bairaag' (1976)\n\nBairaag is bejeweled with the who's who of Hindi cinema: Kumar, Banu, Leena Chandavarkar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Helen, Kader Khan, and Nazir Hussain, among others. Kumar was nominated for a Filmfare Award for Best Actor. No surprises there since he played not one or two but three roles! Helmed by Asit Sen (Annadata), Bairaag is streaming on ZEE5 and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n'Duniya' (1984)"
