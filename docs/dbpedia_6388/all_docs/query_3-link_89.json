In the late 1930s, his family moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) from Peshawar, Pakistan. In Bombay, Dilip Kumar was the neighbour of the legendary Indian actor Raj Kapoor. In an interview, he was asked how much did he miss Peshawar? He replied,\n\nI remember a lot. With age, this trend has increased even more. I miss my grandmother. Reminds me of childhood. I miss playing my football.”\n\nIn 1940, when Dilip Kumar was a teenager, he left his home and moved to Pune, Maharashtra, after an altercation with his father. There, he started a dry fruit shop and a sandwich stall at an army club in Pune, Maharashtra.\n\nAfter almost three years, the legendary Indian actress Devika Rani and her husband Himanshu Rai spotted Dilip Kumar in a military canteen. They liked him and offered him the lead role in the Hindi film ‘Jwar Bhata’ (1944). In an interview, he shared how he developed an interest in acting. He said,\n\nYes, I used to watch movies, but they used to be English films. When I got a chance to work in Hindi films, I had seen only a few Hindi films. In those days I was crazy about English films. He used to watch these films hiding from his family members. Later he came to know about this. He was also worried about my passion for films. When I decided to become an actor in Hindi films, I was worried how to do something I don’t know. But then Devika Rani of Bombay Talkies told me that just as you are learning to sell fruits, you will also learn acting.”\n\nBefore making his debut in the Hindi films, at the suggestion of Devika, he changed his name from Mohammed Yusuf Khan to Dilip Kumar. During an interview, Dilip Kumar shared why he had changed his name. He said,\n\nHaqeeqat bataun? Pitayi ke darr se maine yeh naam rakha (Should I tell you honestly? It was because I was scared of beatings that I used this name).”\n\nHis debut film failed at the box office, and after almost three years, he tasted success with the Hindi film ‘Jugnu’ (1947) opposite Noor Jehan.\n\nLater, Devika Rani offered him a job as a scriptwriter in Bombay Talkies (film studio) as he was proficient in Urdu for which he received Rs. 1,250 per month.\n\nIn 1948, he appeared in two super-hit Hindi films ‘Shaheed’ and ‘Mela.’ A year later, he appeared in the Hindi film ‘Andaz’ (1949) along with the superstars of that time Raj Kapoor and Nargis.\n\nIn the 1950s, he appeared in many super-hit Hindi films like ‘Jogan’ (1950), ‘Babul’ (1950), ‘Hulchul’ (1951), ‘Shikast’ (1953), and ‘Uran Khatola’ (1955).\n\nIn the 1950s, he became the first Indian actor to charge Rs. 1 lakh per film.\n\nIn the same era, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru invited Kumar to address a conference of the Indian Youth Congress.\n\nIn 1955, he played the iconic role of Devdas in the Hindi period-drama film ‘Devdas.’ The role of Paro was played by Suchitra Sen, and Vyjayanthimala played the character of Chandramukhi. In 2002, the remake of the film was made with the same name starring the famous Indian actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, and Madhuri Dixit.\n\nAfter portraying tragic characters in many films, he started remaining sad and depressed in his real life too. Then, his doctor suggested him to do some light-hearted roles in the films. During an interview, Dilip Kumar talked about it, he said,\n\nI had been playing characters who were ill-fated and a morbid outlook had seized me as a result of my extreme involvement and my living the character beyond the working hour.”\n\nHis first technicolour film was ‘Aan’ (1952) which was released worldwide and premiered in London.\n\nIn 1953, he became the first Indian actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the Hindi film ‘Daag’ (1952) and went on to win it 7 times in his career.\n\nIn 1951, while shooting for the Hindi film ‘Tarana’ Dilip Kumar fell in love with his co-star Madhubala. After a courtship of almost seven years followed by an engagement, troubles started arising in their relationship due to the court case of the Hindi film ‘Naya Daur’ in 1957. Their last film together was the epic Hindi film ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ (1960). In an interview, while talking about Madhubala, he said,\n\nI must admit that I was attracted to her (Madhubala) both as a fine co-star and as a person who had some of the attributes I hoped to find in a woman at that age and time…She, as I said earlier, was very sprightly and vivacious and, as such, she could draw me out of my shyness and reticence effortlessly.”\n\nDilip Kumar’s first anti-hero role was in Mehboob Khan’s Hindi film ‘Amar’ (1954).\n\nKumar portrayed the role of Prince Salim in K. Asif’s epic historical film ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ (1960). The film remained the 2nd highest-grossing film till 2008 in the history of Hindi films. The film was shot in black & white, and some scenes of the film were shot in colour. In 2004, after almost 44 years of its original release, the film was fully colourised and was re-released in theatres.\n\nIn the Hindi film ‘Gunga Jamuna’ (1961), the role of his younger brother was played by his real brother Nasir Khan. The duo appeared together in another Hindi film ‘Bairaag’ (1976).\n\nIn 1962, he was offered a role in the British film ‘Lawrence of Arabia’ by the British director David Lean, which he declined.\n\nHe got married to the Indian actress Saira Banu in 1966 who was almost half of his age. While he was married to Saira, he fell in love with a girl from Pakistan Asma and secretly got married to her in 1980. His marriage with Asma did not last long, and he returned to his first wife, Saira. During an interview, he talked about his marriage to Saira. He said,\n\nWhen I married Saira she was young, even younger than my sisters. I wondered how she would cope with establishing the right vibes with my brothers and sisters, especially since she belonged to a small family. We siblings were a dozen. But she not only respected and loved them as a devoted sister-in-law, but also keeps me close to all of them.”\n\nHe starred alongside his real-life wife, Saira Banu, for the first time in the Hindi film ‘Gopi’ (1970).\n\nFrom 1976 to 1981, he took a 5-year hiatus from films. In 1981, he returned to the film industry and played the lead role in the multi-starrer Hindi film ‘Kranti.’ He then appeared in many Hindi films like ‘Mashaal’ (1984), ‘Karma’ (1986), ‘Izzatdaar’ (1990), and ‘Saudagar’ (1991).\n\nDilip Kumar was very close to the Indian actors Shashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar. Reportedly, Ashok Kumar influenced his acting style, and he advised Dilip to always act “naturally.”\n\nIn 1993, during the riots in Maharashtra (caused by the demolition of Babri Mosque in Ayodhya), he made his home as a command centre for the relief work. He was involved in various social activities, and he was one of the members who conceptualised Jogger’s Park in Bandra, Mumbai.\n\nPost his acting career, he started his political career in 2000. He was nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra by the Indian National Congress from 2000 to 2006.\n\nOn 14 March 2000, in the presence of the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Vilasrao Deshmukh, Kumar signed nomination papers to compete in the local assembly elections.\n\nDilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Dev Anand were known to be the best friends in Bollywood.\n\nDilip Kumar loved cooking, and the best dish he used to make was chicken soup. In an interview, the Indian politician Priya Dutt said,\n\nDad had a very special relationship with Dilip Uncle. Dilip uncle was always an elder brother and advisor to dad. Whenever father had problems in his life and was going through any kind of an upheaval, he would directly walk all the way up to Dilip uncle’s house. He would go up to him and say that I want to eat with you. Dilipsaab himself used to cook a dish then – Chicken Soup. They used to sit over dinner and discuss. They were very important moments to my father. Dad was always giving advice to others as an elder, but he never had someone older than him to handhold him when he needed.”\n\nKumar was the idol of the veteran Indian actor Dharmendra. While talking about Dilip in an interview, Dharmendra said,\n\nI used to go and meet him and at times I would want to leave early because I wanted to have my regular (alcohol). Dilipsaab would understand and would ask for alcohol to be served too. But I loved his Chicken soup and what Narmada (his cook) cooked and he would give me advice on my career as well.”\n\nHe further added,\n\nImagine our talks and with so much love he gave me a sweater to wear. It used to get nippy those days in 60s so I told him ‘I will not return it, can I take it?’ He happily gave it to me with a lot of love. Then we were shooting one day; he would tell me wear my suit and I told Saira ‘I have got my own, will wear my own cause his are a little loose’ and I couldn’t say no to him then I reminded him, ‘Dilip sahib I took your sweater’ since nobody forgets if they have bought something nice so he said, ‘Yea I got 2 from Paris, one Nasir took and the other you took.”\n\nOnce, Congress parliamentarian Lilavati Munshi raised the issue of Dilip Kumar’s hairstyle while he was in the Rajya Sabha. She said,\n\nIt had “adverse effects” on Indian youths.”\n\nOnce, former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri accused Dilip Kumar of being an Indian secret agent. Later, amid the increasing tension between India and Pakistan, Kumar accepted an award in Pakistan which created huge chaos in India, and he was even threatened by an Indian political party. Kumar then requested the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee to provide him protection.\n\nDilip Kumar was a music lover and was well-versed in playing the sitar. Dilip lent his voice to a composition by music director Salil Chowdhury called ‘Lagi Nahi Chute’ with Lata Mangeshkar, for the film ‘Musafir’ in 1957. It was also the only song he ever sang.\n\nIn 2007, Dilip Kumar landed in a property dispute with his brothers, Ahsan and Aslam. Kumar wanted to reconstruct his house in Mumbai, but his brothers were not ready to vacate it.\n\nIn 2008, a Hindi documentary ‘Abhinay Samrat Ki Dastan’ was released on the life of Kumar.\n\nOn his 89th birthday in 2011, Dilip Kumar launched his Twitter account.\n\nIn an interview, while talking about the new age actors, Dilip Kumar said,\n\nYes, most of today’s actors are thinking that what is kept in literature. I have to say that literature works to keep your sensibilities alive. We have become friends with machines as if we too have become machines. I have read a lot of writers like Mir, Ghalib, Tagore, Iqbal, Faiz, Josh, Premchand, Sharatchand and Manto. These are the writers everyone should read. All the great writers of the world should read. But very few actors of today read literature. This round is looking a little too fast, but it should be considered whether this fast race will be successful in taking a person somewhere.”\n\nDilip Kumar had been featured on the cover page of various magazines.\n\nVarious books have been published on the life of Dilip Kumar.\n\nHe was well-versed in speaking various languages including Pashto, Hindko, Urdu, Hindi, and English.\n\nDilip Kumar was very close to the famous Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan. In an interview, Dilip’s wife Saira said that Shah Rukh Khan was their mooh-bola-beta. She further said,\n\nDilip saab gave the ceremonial clap (Dil Aashna Hai). I have always said that if we had a son, he might have looked like Shah Rukh. Both he and saab are a lot alike and have similar hair, which is why I like to run my fingers through Shah Rukh Khan when we meet. This time (during one of their earlier meetings) he asked me, ‘Aaj aap mere baalon ko haath nahin laga rahi hain?’ I was happy to.”\n\nOnce, Dilip Kumar said that he was one of the poorest actors in India, he further said,\n\nMy costumes and everyday clothes are stitched by the tailor on Pali Naka who had been making my cloths ever since I started living in Bandra. I have my own barber who visit my house once in a month.”\n\nIn the Guru Nanak Khalsa College in Mumbai, an auditorium has been named after him with the name ‘Dilip Kumar Auditorium.’ In an interview, the college officials said,\n\nThe College hall has been named after the alumnus and thespian actor Dilip Kumar. This center is amphitheater for budding talents. Having a proper stage with a green room facility, the college hall has a 500 plus seating capacity. Apart from being the venue for formal functions, the hall is also used for events like drama competitions, literary events, Kavi-Sammelan, Mehfil and allied artistic pursuits.”\n\nDilip and Saira did not have any child of their own. During an interview, while talking about it Dilip said,\n\nIt would have been great if we had our own kids. But we have no regrets. We are both submissive to the will of God. As for incompleteness, I must tell you that neither Saira nor I can complain of a lack of contentment. It is enough for us that we have our families to share our happiness and our small dismays with. Mine is a large family, with so many nieces and nephews and their families of growing kids speaking the language of today, which is as bewildering as it is befitting the times they are living in. Saira’s is a small family comprising her brother Sultan and his kids and grandchildren. We feel we are lucky to be there for them when they need us.”\n\nIn an interview, while talking about Saira Banu, Kumar said,\n\nI wish to live for the happiness of my wife. I knew and know even more strongly now that she loves me as no one, other than my mother, has. I wish to live for her love and devotion. It is so lovely to wake up and see the preparations she has done to make each day worth living for. In fact, our common wish now is to care for, and make, each other happy. You have to be truly lucky to be in my place.”\n\nIn 2013, he visited Masjid al-Haram (The Great Mosque of Mecca), Saudi Arabia, along with his wife and a few relatives. In an interview, Kumar said,\n\nAllah has been kind that he’s given me the strength to go on Umrah (pilgrimage) with Saira, Asif, Faisal… My doctor friends, few relatives are also accompanying me to Umrah. Keep me in your prayers.”\n\nIn 2015, Pakistan’s provincial government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said that the ancestral home of Dilip Kumar in Pakistan would be turned into a national heritage site.\n\nAs he was getting older, he suffered from various age-related ailments. Later, he was detected with prostate cancer which had spread in the other organs of his body. After a prolonged illness, he passed away on 7 July 2021 in Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai, and on his demise, one of the doctors involved in his treatment said,\n\nHe had water in pleural cavity and suffered kidney failure. He required blood transfusion multiple times. We carried out the last transfusion but it did not help.”\n\nOn 7 July 2021, he was wrapped in a tricolour flag and with the full state honour, he was buried at the Juhu Qabrastan in Santacruz, Mumbai. Many Indian actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, and Dharmendra were present at his last rites.\n\nOn his demise, many Indian and Pakistani celebrities shared their condolences on Twitter. The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi tweeted,\n\nDilip Kumar Ji will be remembered as a cinematic legend. He was blessed with unparalleled brilliance, due to which audiences across generations were enthralled. His passing away is a loss to our cultural world. Condolences to his family, friends and innumerable admirers. RIP.”\n\nEven the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan was disheartened to know about Dilip’s demise. He tweeted,\n\nSaddened to learn of Dilip Kumar’s passing. I can never forget his generosity in giving his time to help raise funds for SKMTH when project launched. This is the most difficult time – to raise first 10% of the funds & his appearance in Pak & London helped raise huge amounts. Apart from this, for my generation Dilip Kumar was the greatest and most versatile actor.”\n\nThe legendary Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted,\n\nIn July 2024, it was reported that his Bandra bungalow-turned-apartment was sold for Rs. 155 crore."
