        "text": "Salman Khan (Born Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan on 27 December 1965) is an Indian film actor. He has starred in more than eighty Hindi films.\n\nKhan, who made his acting debut with a minor role in the drama Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), had his first commercial success with the blockbuster Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He went on to star in some of Hindi cinema's most successful films of those times, such as Saajan (1991), Hum Aapke Hain Kaun (1994), Karan Arjun (1995), Judwaa (1997), Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998) and Biwi No.1 (1999), having appeared in the highest earning films of seven separate years during his career. He is the only Indian actor to have four all-time blockbusters in his filmography, more than any other Indian actor in history.\n\nIn 1999, Khan won a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his extended appearance in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), and since then has starred in several critical and commercial successes, including Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), Tere Naam (2003), Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), No Entry (2005), Partner (2007), Wanted (2009) and Dabangg (2010), which has become the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of all-time. Khan has thus established himself as one of the most successful actors of Hindi cinema.\n\nKhan is the eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan and his first wife Salma (maiden name Sushila Charak), his paternal grandfather came to India from Afghanistan and settled in Madhya Pradesh whereas his mother is a Marathi Brahmin. His stepmother is Helen, a former Bollywood actress, who has co-starred with him in Khamoshi: The Musical (1996) and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999). He has two brothers, Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan, and two sisters, Alvira and Arpita. Alvira is married to actor/director Atul Agnihotri.\n\nKhan finished his schooling through St. Stanislaus High School in Bandra, Mumbai, as did his younger brothers Arbaaz and Sohail. Earlier, he studied at The Scindia School, Gwalior for a few years along with younger brother Arbaaz.\n\nCareer\n\n1980s\n\nSalman Khan made his acting debut with a supporting role in the 1988 film Biwi Ho To Aisi. His first leading role in a Bollywood movie was in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), one of India's highest grossing films. It also won him a Filmfare Best Male Debut Award, and a nomination for Filmfare Best Actor Award.\n\n1990s\n\n1990 saw one film release starring Khan, Baaghi: A Rebel for Love. The film was a box office success, followed by three hit films in 1991, Patthar Ke Phool, Sanam Bewafa and Saajan. Despite these early successes, nearly all of his 1992–1993 releases resulted in box office failures.\n\nKhan returned to success in 1994 with his second collaboration with director Sooraj Barjatya in the romance Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, co-starring Madhuri Dixit. This film was the biggest hit of that year, and turned out to be one of Bollywood's highest-grossing films ever, becoming the fourth-highest earner of all time. In 1995 he starred in Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun alongside Shahrukh Khan. The two played brothers who are reincarnated after being killed by family enemies. The film was the second biggest hit of the year, and his role of Karan once again put his name among the nominees for the Best Actor award at the Filmfare, which was eventually won by his Karan Arjun co-star Shahrukh Khan for Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.\n\nIn 1996, Khan performed in two movies, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directional debut Khamoshi: The Musical, a box office failure, but critically acclaimed; and Raj Kanwar's action hit Jeet. He had two releases in 1997: Judwaa and Auzaar. The former was a comedy directed by David Dhawan where he played a dual role of twins separated at birth.\n\nKhan worked in five different films in 1998, his first release being the comedy Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya opposite Kajol, one of the biggest commercial successes of that year. This was followed by the moderately successful drama Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai. Khan played a young man who has to take a child who claims to be his son, under his custody. Khan's performance in the film earned him several positive notices and favourable reviews from critics. He rounded of the year with an extended cameo in Karan Johar's directorial debut, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai for which he earned a second Filmfare Award under the Best Supporting Actor category.\n\nIn 1999, Khan starred in three films: Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United and Biwi No.1, two of the highest grossing films that year; and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, which earned another Best Actor nomination at the Filmfare.\n\n2000s\n\nIn 2000, Khan acted in films including Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Chori Chori Chupke Chupke addressed the issue of surrogate childbirth; Khan played the role of a rich industrialist, who hires a surrogate mother after his wife becomes infertile. Critics noted his turn towards a more serious role, which reportedly had more substance in comparison to his previous roles. In 2002 he starred in the delayed release Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.\n\nFor Tere Naam, (2003) Taran Adarsh said of him, \"Salman Khan is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid...\" He subsequently continued his success at the box office, with comedies like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and No Entry (2005). Khan's work in 2006 included Jaan-E-Mann and Baabul .\n\nKhan started 2007 with the ensemble film Salaam E Ishq. His next release Partner did very well at the box office, receiving a blockbuster verdict. He next appeared in the Hollywood movie, Marigold: An Adventure in India which told the love story of an Indian man and an American woman.\n\nKhan starred in three films throughout 2008, all of which underperformed.\n\nKhan hosted the second season of 10 Ka Dum in year 2009 which turned out to be even more successful than his first season as host of the game show in year 2008. The show got very high TRPs for Sony Entertainment Television and according to reports, the show helped Sony TV regain its third position in the Indian television ratings.\n\nKhan's first film of 2009, Wanted directed by choreographer turned director Prabhu Deva. In the same year, he appeared in two other films, Main Aurr Mrs Khanna and London Dreams. While London Dreams doing average business, only due to the uninspiring music, but Main Aurr Mrs Khanna made 21 crores through DTH Premiere.\n\n2010s\n\nKhan's first release of 2010 was Anil Sharma's Veer. Dabangg was produced by his brother Arbaaz Khan, and was released on 10 September 2010. It made a record opening at the box office and Box Office India declared it an all-time blockbuster and the second-highest grossing Indian movie of all-time. For his performance in Dabangg, Khan received a Star Screen Award for Best Actor and a Stardust Award for Star of the Year – Male and was nominated for his sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Anupama Chopra from NDTV wrote about his performance, \"It's the role of a lifetime and Salman Khan bites into it like a starving man devours a feast. He inhabits it fully, strutting and swaggering and even, spoofing himself.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2004, he was voted seventh best-looking man in the world and the best looking man in India by People magazine, U.S. Khan has been involved in several charities during his career.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, Khan accepted an offer from Madame Tussauds wax museum in London to have a wax replica made of himself. His life-size wax figure was installed there on 15 January 2008, making him the fourth Indian actor to have been replicated as a wax statue in the museum.\n\nControversies\n\nLegal troubles\n\nOn 28 September 2002, Khan was arrested for rash and negligent driving. His car had run into a bakery in Mumbai; one person who was sleeping on the pavement outside the bakery died and three others were injured in the mishap. Charges of culpable homicide were laid against him, but later dropped, and he was found not guilty. However, he will still have to stand trial for a series of lesser charges pertaining to the incident.\n\nOn 17 February 2006, Khan was sentenced to one year in prison for hunting an endangered species, the Chinkara. The sentence was stayed by a higher court during appeal. On 10 April 2006, Salman was handed a five year jail term for hunting the endangered Chinkara. He was remanded to Jodhpur jail, and remained there until 13 April when he was granted bail. On 24 August 2007, the Jodhpur sessions court, upheld the 5 year jail term for Khan in the Chinkara poaching case by turning down his appeal against the 2006 judgement. At the time of the hearing, he was busy with a shooting elsewhere, while his sister attended the proceedings. The day after, he was placed under police arrest in Jodhpur after a Rajasthan court upheld a prison sentence passed upon him for poaching. On 31 August 2007, Khan was released on bail from the Jodhpur Central jail where he spent six days.\n\nBreakup with Aishwarya Rai\n\nHis relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicised topic in the Indian media. After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him.\n\nIn 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake.\n\nFatwas\n\nIn September 2007, a Muslim organisation issued a fatwa against Khan for attending a Ganesh puja. Stating that Islam prohibits idol worship, the organisation stated that unless Khan reads the Kalma – the declaration of faith – all over again, he will not be considered a Muslim. In addition to that, Khan celebrated the Ganesh Mahotsav with his family in Bandra; they brought a Ganesh idol for one day for the sake of his stepmother, Helen. Khan was among the group who danced in the procession. His father responded by criticising the fatwa and stated that Salman had done nothing wrong.\n\nAnother fatwa was raised against Khan by a Muslim cleric in India, mufti Salim Ahmad Qasmi, for allowing Madame Tussauds in London to make a wax model of himself. The mufti said the statue is illegal and the Sharia forbids depictions of all living creatures. This created speculation in the press, as no fatwa was released against fellow Muslim, Shahrukh Khan who also has a wax model in the museum. Salman responded by saying, \"These fatwas are becoming a joke\".\n\nThe fatwa was raised upon Khan again in September 2008, for celebrating the Ganeshotsav Hindu ceremony at his home with the family. The fatwa was raised by the member of the Advisory Council, Jama Masjid, in New Delhi. Once again his father, Salim, questioned the latest fatwa and criticised those who raise it.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\nYear Film Role Other notes 1988 Biwi Ho To Aisi Vicky Bhandari 1989 Maine Pyar Kiya Prem Choudhary Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut\n\nNominated—Filmfare Award for Best Actor 1990 Baaghi: A Rebel for Love Saajan Sood 1991 Sanam Bewafa Salman Khan Patthar Ke Phool Inspector Suraj Kurbaan Akash Singh Love Prithvi Saajan Akash Varma 1992 Suryavanshi Vicky/Suryavanshi Vikram Singh Ek Ladka Ek Ladki Raja Jaagruti Jugnu Nishchaiy Rohan Yadav/Vasudev Gujral 1993 Chandra Mukhi Raja Rai Dil Tera Aashiq Vijay 1994 Andaz Apna Apna Prem Bhopali Hum Aapke Hain Kaun...!

He has appeared in over 120 Hindi language films. At the start of his career, his acting and dancing skills gained him widespread attention among film viewers. He later gained worldwide fame as a Bollywood icon through comedy films such as Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Coolie No. 1, Haseena Maan Jaayegi and Partner.\n\nHe is a member of the Indian National Congress Party. He was elected as the seventh Member of Parliament for the Mumbai North Constituency of Maharashtra, India in the 14th Lok Sabha elections in 2004, after defeating Ram Naik of the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the 2009 General Elections, he opted out of politics to concentrate more on films. However he continues to have political favor from Congress Party. His constituency was succeeded by Sanjay Nirupam (also from Congress).\n\nIn June 1999, Govinda was voted as the tenth greatest star of stage or screen of the last thousand years by BBC News Online users.\n\nGovinda’s father, Arun Kumar Ahuja, was born in pre-partition Gujranwala, Punjab on January 26, 1917. He studied in an engineering college at Lahore. Veteran producer Mehboob Khan brought him to Mumbai in 1937 and cast him in Ek Hi Raasta as the leading man. Arun was notable for acting in Mehboob Khan's Aurat (1940). Govinda's mother, Nazeem who was Muslim had converted to Hinduism and adopted the name Nirmala Devi.[citation needed] Arun and Nirmala first met during the making of the film Savera, in which they were cast opposite each other. They married in 1941.\n\nThe only film Ahuja ever produced was a flop. Unable to bear the loss, his health failed. The family, living in a bungalow on Mumbai's upmarket Carter Road, later moved to Virar — a northern Mumbai suburb, where Govinda was born. The youngest of six children, his pet name Chi Chi means little finger in Punjabi, the language they speak at home. Since his father was unable to work, Nirmala Devi brought up the children through hard times in Mumbai.\n\nEarly career\n\nHe studied at Annasahb Vartak College in Vasai, Maharashtra. He graduated in commerce, but failed to find a job. He was not considered for a steward's position at the Taj Mahal hotel, because his English wasn't good enough. His father suggested films. Around this time, Govinda saw the film Saturday Night Fever and dance became his obsession. He practiced for hours and circulated a promo of himself on a VHS cassette. Soon a fertilizer commercial came his way, followed by an Allwyn ad, finally his very first leading role in Tan-Badan, which was to be directed by his uncle Anand. He started shooting for his next film Love 86 in June 1985. By mid-July, he had signed 40 others.\n\nHis first released film was Ilzaam (1986), a box office success and the fifth biggest hit of 1986. The film established him as a dancing star. He acted in a string of movies after that with mixed success. Most of the films he appeared in during the 1980s were in the action, romance or family drama genres. He was often paired opposite actress Neelam and together they appeared in several hit films such as Love 86 (1986), Khudgarz (1987) and his brother Kirti Kumar's directorial, Hatya (1988). He had success with family drama films such as Dariya Dil (1988), Jeete Hain Shaan Se (1988) and Hum (1991) as well as action films such as Marte Dam Tak (1987) and Jung Baaz (1989). He worked with David Dhawan for the first time in the 1989 action film Taaqatwar. He also worked with Rajini Kanth and Sridevi in a hit film that year titled, Ghair Khanooni.\n\n1990s\n\nGovinda appeared in several successful films in the 1990s. In 1992, he was seen in the critically acclaimed film, Zulm Ki Hukumat, an Indian remake of The Godfather where his performance was appreciated. He then formed a successful collaboration with David Dhawan and went onto act in 17 movies directed by him most of which were comedy films. The most successful films made by their collaboration include, Shola Aur Shabnam (1992), Aankhen (1993), Raja Babu (1994), Coolie No. 1 (1995), Saajan Chale Sasural (1996), Hero No. 1 (1997), Deewana Mastana (1997), Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998), Haseena Maan Jaayegi (1999), Anari No.1 (1999) and Jodi No. 1 (2001). Dhawan and other directors frequently cast him opposite actresses such as Divya Bharati, Karishma Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Manisha Koirala, and Raveena Tandon during the 1990s.\n\n2000s\n\nHis box office graph suffered a setback in the early 2000s following a series of commercially unsuccessful films. He played the role of a villain for the first time in his career in Shikari (2000). Although the movie was not a commercial success, Govinda's convincing portrayal of a sociopath murderer was critically acclaimed. He turned down roles in Taal, Gadar: Ek Prem Katha and Devdas which went on to become successful films.[9] His acting career was further affected when he contested and won the seat for Member of Parliament from Mumbai North in the 2004 parliamentary elections. He did not have any new film releases in 2004 and 2005 although some of his delayed films such as Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen (2005) and his home production Ssukh (2005) were released and turned out to be box office disasters.\n\nGovinda made a comeback to films in late 2006 with the comedy film, Bhagam Bhag, alongside Akshay Kumar which became a hit. His first release of 2007 was the huge multi-starrer Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute To Love. Although a box office disappointment, Govinda was praised for his performance.\n\nHis second release of 2007 was the David Dhawan directed comedy, Partner, which co-starred Salman Khan. The film grossed Rs. 300 Million in India on its opening week, the second highest domestic opening week gross for an Indian film until then. In 2008, he appeared in the film, Money Hai Toh Honey Hai. The same year, Salman Khan invited David Dhawan and Govinda on his show Dus Ka Dum to celebrate the success of their film Partner. In 2009, he had a successful release titled Life Partner. Govinda got back to the successful trio of David Dhawan, Vashu Bhagnani and himself with the film, Do Knot Disturb, which flopped at the box office.\n\nIn 2010, Govinda was seen in Mani Ratnam's bilingual project, Raavan, along with Vikram, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. Govinda played a forest officer who takes Vikram's character through the forests in search of a wanted criminal. While it was earlier speculated that his character was a contemporary version of Hanuman, Govinda refuted the claim. Despite having a small role in the film, Govinda was appreciated for his performance.\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn 2004, Govinda joined the Congress party, and was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower House of Parliament from Mumbai with a thumping majority of beating the five time sitting MP by over 50000 votes. In a run up to the polls, Govinda had announced that his agenda will be prawaas (transportation), swasthya (health) and gyaan (education).\n\nDuring the first ten months of his tenure as a Member of Parliament (MP), Govinda did not spend any money from his MP Local Area Development Fund of Rs. 20 million. He started utilizing his fund only when newspaper reports brought this to notice. According to the Thane district collectorate sources, Govinda committed Rs 7 to construct anganwadi, samaj mandirs and resolve drinking water problem of Vasai and Virar residents. However, work on these projects did not begin (as of August 2005), because administrative approval was being awaited. Govinda also took credit for 80% of the quadrupling of Borivli-Virar section on Western Railway (India).\n\nCriticism\n\nAs an MP, Govinda has been criticized for being inaccessible to the people of his constituency, especially during the terrible rains (beginning 26 July 2005) that left around 450 dead in Mumbai. After the rains, while speaking to a TV channel, Govinda claimed that he had got Rs 150 million sanctioned for his flood-hit constituency after speaking to Sonia Gandhi. However, his own party colleagues contested the claim. Mohan Adhikari, the president of Palghar Congress Unit went on record saying that \"not a single paisa\" had been received.\n\nDuring his tenure as an MP, Govinda embarrassed his party, Congress, by coming out in open to support actor Shakti Kapoor, who had been caught in a sting operation, asking for sexual favours from a television reporter posing as a Bollywood aspirant. He also opposed the ban on dance bars, which embarrassed the Congress-NCP led Democratic Front Government, which had proposed the ban.\n\nDuring his tenure as the Member of Parliament, he was criticized for never playing any active role. He was mostly absent while the house was in session. He also did not participate in any debates or raise any queries regarding his constituency.\n\nOn 20 January 2008, he decided to quit politics to concentrate on his acting career in Bollywood.\n\nPersonal life\n\nGovinda's father Arun Ahuja was an actor in the 1940s and his mother Nirmala Ahuja was also an actress as well as a singer. His brother, Kirti Kumar is an actor, producer and director. His sister, Kaamini Khanna is a writer, music director, singer, anchor and founder of 'Beauty with Astrology'. Govinda has six nephews and two nieces in the entertainment industry: actors Vinay Anand, Krushna Abhishek, Aryan, Arjun Singh, Ragini Khanna, Amit Khanna, Aarti Singh and director Janmendra Kumar Ahuja. Govinda's brother-in-law, Devendra Sharma has also acted in a few Hindi films.\n\nGovinda's maternal uncle Anand Singh, who was assistant to director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, launched him in his film, Tan Badan. Anand's wife's sister Sunita fell in love with Govinda during the 'Mahurat' of Tan Badan. They got married on 11 March 1987. Their marriage was a closely guarded secret for four years. The couple have two children, Narmada and Yashvardhan.\n\nGovinda narrowly escaped death on 5 January 1994 while traveling to a studio for the shooting of Khuddar (1994). The actor's car collided with another car, resulting in him sustaining injuries to his head. Though bleeding profusely, Govinda did not cancel the shooting. After visiting a doctor, he shot for the film till midnight.\n\nAge dispute\n\nGovinda's year of birth has been cited as both 1960 and 1963. According to Govinda's parliament member profile on Loksabha.nic.in, the Official Government website of Lok Sabha, his date of birth is listed as 21 December 1963. The profile is compiled from government records. Personal Information of parliament members are obligatorily scrutinized and affirmed at the time of submitting nominations for candidacy.\n\nThe year of birth has also been stated as 1958 in numerous web portals. This probably originated from an unverified entry on his IMDb page. Various web portals like Rediff that referred IMDb as a source featured articles on the actor celebrating his 48th birthday on the eve of Bhagam Bhag's release on December 21, 2006.\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\nWinner\n\n1997 - Filmfare Special Award for Saajan Chale Sasural\n\n1999 - Filmfare Best Comedian Award, Haseena Maan Jaayegi\n\nNominated:\n\n1994 - Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Aankhen\n\n1996 - Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Coolie No. 1\n\n1997 - Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Saajan Chale Sasural\n\n1998 - Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Deewana Mastana\n\n1999 - Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Bade Miyan Chote Miyan\n\n2000 - Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role for - Haseena Maan Jaayegi\n\n2000 - Filmfare Best Villain Award forShikari\n\n2001 - Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role for Kunwara\n\n2002 - Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role for Jodi No.1\n\n2002 - Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role for Kyo Kii...

In 1997, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema. He is often referred to as the \"Action King\" of Hindi cinema having starred in numerous action films and is considered a living legend. He is father of notable actors Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol and Esha Deol. He was the main lead of the all-time blockbuster film, Sholay (1975) and also went on to star in numerous successful Bollywood films cutting across five decades. Dharmendra has thus established himself as one of the most prominent figures of the Hindi film industry.\n\nHe was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh family in Punjab state to Kewal Kishan Singh Deol and Satwant Kaur. He spent his early life at village Sahnewal, Ludhiana. His father was a school headmaster in the village of Lalton Ludhiana where the family later moved. At the peak of his film career he was considered the most handsome actor in Bollywood and a matinée idol. He was a member of the 14th Lok Sabha of India representing Bikaner constituency in Rajasthan from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was awarded the Lifetime achievement award for his contribution to Hindi cinema at the 2007 IIFA Awards.\n\nFilm career\n\nDharmendra won the Filmfare new talent award and came to Mumbai from Punjab looking for work. Starting with Arjun Hingorani's Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960), he worked in several romantic black and white films in the early 1960s, hitting solo hero stardom with Phool Aur Patthar (1966). At the start of his career, he was usually cast as a romantic hero and later in the period from 1974 onwards as an action hero. He starred with several leading actresses at the beginning of his career. He worked with Nutan in Soorat Aur Seerat (1962) and Bandini (1963), Mala Sinha in Anpadh (1962) and Pooja Ke Phool (1964), Saira Banu in Shaadi (1962) and Ayee Milan Ki Bela (1964) and with Meena Kumari in Main Bhi Ladki Hoon (1964), Kaajal (1965), Poornima (1965) and Phool Aur Paththar (1966).\n\nPhool Aur Paththar became the highest grossing film of 1966 and Dharmendra received his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. He formed a very successful pairing with actresses like Meena Kumari, Saira Banu, Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Asha Parekh, Parveen Babi, Zeenat Aman and Hema Malini. His most successful pairing was with Hema Malini, who went on to become his future wife. They formed a hit pair delivering phenomenal hits like, Raja Jani, Seeta Aur Geeta, Sharafat, Tum Haseen Main Jawaan, Jugnu, Dost, Charas, Maa, Chacha Bhatija, Azaad, Teesri Aankh and Sholay. The 1980 film, The Burning Train also saw the Dharam-Hema chemistry in full flight.\n\nHis most notable acting performance was Satyakam with Hrishikesh Mukherjee[10] and Sholay, where he appeared as the inimitable Veeru. Sholay went on to become one of the biggest hits in the history of Hindi cinema and is listed by Indiatimes as one of the \"top 25 must see Bollywood films of all time\". Dharmendra went on to star in numerous successful Bollywood films in the 1970s and 80s like Pratigya, Dharam Veer, Charas, Azaad, Katilon Ke Kaatil, Ghazab, Bhagavat, Dharam Aur Kanoon, Hukumat, Watan Ke Rakhwale, Aag Hi Aag, Ghulami, Hathyar and Loha.\n\nHe has worked with various directors, each having different styles in their film-making, like Bimal Roy and Mohan Kumar in drama films, Yash Chopra and Raghunath Jhalani in romance films, Raj Khosla, Ramesh Sippy, Arjun Hingorani, Anil Sharma and Rajkumar Santoshi in action films and Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterji and Rajkumar Kohli in comedy films. He also has the distinction of appearing in quite a few films opposite actresses who have also starred opposite his son Sunny Deol. Notable amongst those are Sridevi in Naaka Bandi, Jaya Prada in Elaan-E-Jung, Dimple Kapadia in Shehzaade, Amrita Singh in Sachai Ki Taaqat, Kimi Katkar in Humlaa and Poonam Dhillon in Sone Pe Suhaaga.\n\nHe has also periodically done films in his native tongue of Punjabi, starring in Do Sher (1974), Dukh Bhanjan Tera Naam (1974), Teri Meri Ik Jindri (1975), Putt Jattan De (1982) and Qurbani Jatt Di (1990). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to appear in many more films playing leading roles or supporting roles. In 1997, he received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. While receiving the award from Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu, Dharmendra became emotional and remarked that he never received any Filmfare award in the Best Actor category despite having worked in so many successful films and nearly a hundred popular movies. He was glad that his contributions had finally been recognized. Speaking on the occasion Dilip Kumar commented, \"Whenever I get to meet with God Almighty I will set before Him my only complaint-why did You not make me as handsome as Dharmendra?\".\n\nHe has also experimented with film production; he launched both of his sons in films: Sunny Deol in Betaab (1983) and Bobby Deol in Barsaat (1995) as well as his nephew Abhay Deol in Socha Na Tha (2005). In one of her interviews, actress Priety Zinta has been quoted as saying that Dharmendra is her favourite actor. She has gone on to recommend him to play her father's role in Har Pal (2008).\n\nAfter a few years hiatus from acting since the early 2000s, he is reappearing in films as a character actor. His 2007 films Life in a Metro and Apne were both successful at the box office. In the latter, he appears with both his sons, Sunny and Bobby for the first time. His other release was Johnny Gaddaar, where he played a villainous role. His latest film Yamla Pagla Deewana co-starring his sons Sunny and Bobby was released on January 14, 2011.\n\nPolitical career\n\nDharmendra has also been active in politics. He was elected as a Member of the Parliament in the 2004 general elections, from Bikaner in Rajasthan, on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. During his election campaign, he made an ironic remark that he should be elected Dictator Perpetuus to teach \"basic etiquette that democracy requires\" for which he was severely criticized. Dharmendra has rarely attended the Parliament when the house was in session, preferring to spend the time shooting for movies or doing farm-work at his farm house. He has also not participated in any debates or raised any queries. Along with actor Govinda, Dharmendra has been criticised for ignoring his duties as a Member of Parliament.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDharmendra maintained two relationships at same time. His first marriage was to Prakash Kaur at the age of 19 in 1954. His second marriage took place with actress Hema Malini. They are said to have fallen in love on the set of Sholay (1975) although they had made films together before. He married Hema while he was still married to his first wife Prakash Kaur. According to some reports, he converted to Islam before marrying her.\n\nFrom his first marriage, he has two sons, Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol who are also successful actors, and two daughters named Vijeta and Ajeeta. From his second marriage to Hema Malini, Dharmendra has two daughters Esha Deol, who is an actress and Ahana Deol. Dharmendra was also romantically involved with his Phool Aur Patthar co-star Meena Kumari.\n\nDharmendra has gone on record saying he does not believe that the Mumbai film industry is a place suitable for girls. He was unperturbed by his sons Sunny and Bobby joining the industry, but was vocal about his displeasure regarding his daughter Esha's choice of profession.\n\nAwards\n\nFilmfare Awards\n\nWinner\n\n1991 – Filmfare Award For Best Film/Producer for Ghayal\n\n1997 – Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Indian Cinema.\n\nNominated\n\n1965 – Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award for Ayee Milan Ki Bela\n\n1967 – Filmfare Best Actor Award for Phool Aur Patthar\n\n1972 – Filmfare Best Actor Award for Mera Gaon Mera Desh\n\n1974 – Filmfare Best Actor Award for Yaadon Ki Baaraat\n\n1975 – Filmfare Best Actor Award for Resham Ki Dori\n\n1984 – Filmfare Best Comedian Award for Naukar Biwi Ka\n\nOther Awards and recognitions\n\nIn the mid seventies, he was voted as one of the most handsome men in the world, a feat only repeated by Salman Khan (from Bollywood) in 2004.\n\nHe has received the World Iron Man award.[citation needed]\n\nHe has also received a Special Award for \"contribution in Indian Cinema\" at the Kalakar Awards.\n\nHe is a recipient of the prestigious \"Living Legend Award\" by the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the Indian entertainment industry.\n\nIn 2003 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Sansui Viewers' Choice Movie Awards.\n\nIn 2004, he was honoured for Best Contribution to Indian Cinema.\n\nIn 2005, he received the Zee Cine Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nIn 2007, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF).\n\nIn 2007, he received an IIFA Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nIn 2007, he received an award for Humanitarian Services to the Indian Nation.\n\nIn 2007, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award by DBR Entertainment.\n\nIn 2007, the Punjabi newspaper Quami Ekta honoured him for his contributions to the Indian cinema.\n\nIn 2008, he was named \"Actor Par Excellence\" at the Max Stardust Awards.\n\nIn 2008, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 10th Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image International Film (M.A.M.I).\n\nIn 2009, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Nashik International Film Festival (NIFF).\n\nIn 2010, he was honoured as the Big Star Entertainer for his 50 years of excellence at the Big Star Entertainment Awards.\n\nIn 2011, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Apsara Film and Television Producers Guild Awards.\n\nIn 2011, he received a \"Salaaam Maharashtra Award\" for completion of 50 years in the film industry.\n\nIn 2011, he was honoured with \"Outstanding Performance For The Last 50 Years\" award at the Global Indian Film & Television Honors.\n\nFilmography\n\nSubway to Nowhere (1955)\n\n1960s\n\nDil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960)\n\nShola Aur Shabnam(1961)\n\nBoy Friend (1961) ….\n\nSoorat Aur Seerat (1962)\n\nShaadi (1962)\n\nAnpadh (1962)\n\nBegaana (1963)\n\nBandini (1963) (as\n\nPooja Ke Phool (1964) ….\n\nMera Qasoor Kya Hai (1964)\n\nMain Bhi Ladki Hoon (1964)\n\nHaqeeqat (1964) ….\n\nGanga Ki Lahren (1964)\n\nAyee Milan Ki Bela (1964)\n\nAap Ki Parchhaiyan (1964) ….\n\nPurnima (1965)\n\nNeela Aakash (1965) ….\n\nKaajal (1965) ….\n\nChand Aur Suraj (1965)\n\nAkashdeep (1965)\n\nPhool Aur Patthar (1966) ….\n\nMohabbat Zindagi Hai (1966) ….\n\nMamta (1966) ….\n\nDil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya (1966)\n\nDevar (1966)\n\nBaharen Phir Bhi Aayengi (1966) ….\n\nAnupama (1966 film) ….
