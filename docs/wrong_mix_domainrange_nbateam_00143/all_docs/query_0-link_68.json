Hamer returned to his alma mater as an assistant director of development with the Tennessee Fund in 2020.\n\nIn his current role, Hamer takes the lead in developing a comprehensive approach to ensuring that all letterwinners maintain a meaningful connection with UT. That includes collaboration with the Letterman's T Club as well as examining opportunities for VFL and LVFL engagement throughout the year.\n\nHamer also continues to serve as a major-gift fundraiser with the Tennessee Fund and close Shareholder Society gifts.\n\nDuring the development of Tennessee Athletics' comprehensive five-year strategic plan, Rise Glorious—which was published in July of 2022—Hamer served on the Brand Advancement & Messaging Committee.\n\nA native of Grand Junction, Tennessee, Hamer scored more than 1,400 career points for the Vols and earned All-SEC acclaim before being selected by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 1996 NBA Draft.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Hamer returned to Tennessee and spent 13 years as an educator and coach. Immediately prior to transitioning to a staff role at UT, Hamer spent seven years as the director of athletics at Apostolic Christian School in northwest Knoxville.\n\n\"To say that I am humbled by this great opportunity to serve this great university, our letterwinners and our fans is a gross understatement,\" Hamer said. \"I am truly excited to embark upon a new chapter in which I hope to bridge the gap between anyone who has ever donned the orange and this special place that we call home. What a great time to be a Vol!\"\n\nA gifted relationship builder, Hamer has excelled in donor stewardship since joining the Tennessee Fund staff while also serving as a familiar connection point for dozens of former Vols and Lady Vols across all sports.\n\n\"Congratulations to my good friend, Steve Hamer,\" Tennessee basketball legend Allan Houston said. \"From knowing Steve as a teammate and friend, I envision him leading an innovative effort to enhance an authentic connection and a community of support between current and former VFLs that could have major impact.\"\n\nIn addition to Hamer's daily responsibilities, he regularly steps in to share his basketball insight as an analyst on SEC Network+ telecasts and Vol Network radio broadcasts.\n\nHamer and his wife, Cher, have three children. Their daughter Isabella is a student at UT. Son, Malachi, and daughter, Penelope, both attend Apostolic Christian School."
