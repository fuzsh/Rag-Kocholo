        "text": "Someone asked me if Jayson Tatum is as good as Larry Bird? I thought about it for a second and said no. Not now. But he may end up being just as good at the end of his career.\n\nTatum was classmates in high school with Florida Panthers hockey player Matthew Tkachuk.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons fired Monty Williams after just one season; they went 14-68. A coach texted me and said, “Can’t keep your job if you lose 30 in a row.” Williams had a $78.5 million dollar contract for six years. He’ll be getting paid for doing nothing. In a year or two someone will hire him as either an assistant coach or head coach. Matter of fact, Lakers or Cavaliers may hire him ASAP. But, he’s set for life, he doesn’t have to work anymore.\n\nCameron Brink of the LA Sparks tore her ACL and will be out for the rest of the season. Look-a-likes; Brink and actress Sophie Turner.\n\nIndiana Fever-Chicago Sky will meet for the third time this Sunday. Their second meeting (last Sunday) broke the record for most viewers since 2001.\n\nAngel Reese was salty with the media a couple of days ago. She told them, “I can’t trust any of ya’ll.”\n\nLuis Tiant belongs in the baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nBill Belichick is 72 and dating a 24 year-old.\n\nRest in peace Willie Mays. The “Say Hey Kid” used to play stickball in the street with kids in Harlem.\n\nCongratulations to the Boston Celtics.\n\nC’s defeated the Dallas Mavericks Monday night, 106-88 to wrap up their 18th title in franchise history. C’s won the series 4-1.\n\nJayson Tatum scored 31 points, 8 rebounds and 11 assists. He becomes the first Celtics player in franchise history to have 30+ points and 10+ assists in a finals game.\n\nJaylen Brown was named MVP of the series. I was a bit surprised by that selection. Tatum had better stats. 22.2 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 8.3 assists in the five games. Brown 20.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.2 assists. It might’ve been Brown’s defense on Doncic that won it. 4 voters voted for Tatum.\n\nThings got off to a bad start; at the bottom of my television screen was a news flash scroll of a potential tornado in my area. I couldn’t see the score or time. Thankfully it cleared up.\n\nNate Oats, Alabama head coach was at the game.\n\nAl Horford’s dad Tito sits right behind the Celtics bench. Horford is from Grand Ledge, Michigan. I watched him throughout his high school career. He gets his first NBA ring.\n\nDoris Burke with the line of the night. After Kristaps Porzingis was thrown to the ground Doris said, “If that were Caitlin Clark, it might spark a debate for a week.”\n\nKyrie Irving was boo’d every time he touched the ball. “Kyrie Sucks” chants were also heard. He shot 5-16 on the night.\n\nLuka Doncic did all he could but it wasn’t enough. He scored 28 points, pulled down 12 rebounds and had 5 assists.\n\nLuka and Krie did not shoot the ball well from distance in the series. Luka was 11-45, Kyrie 8-29.\n\nShoot it up and sleep in the streets: Celtics attempted 207 3’s in the series. Mavericks 152.\n\nCeltics were 16-3 in the 2024 playoffs.\n\nMike Breen, who talks way too much misidentified Jrue Holiday’s wife in the stands.\n\nHoliday is my favorite Celtics player. Last night he had 15 points and 11 rebounds. He led the C’s in offensive rebounds in the finals with 13.\n\nDerrick White dove for a loose ball and chipped his upper front tooth.\n\nCeltics had 25 assists last night with 7 turnovers. Mavs 18-13.\n\nLuka had 28 assists with 23 turnovers in the series.\n\nHow come NBA fans don’t storm the court after winning the championship?\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nGame 5 of the NBA finals tonight in Boston.\n\nKyrie Irving said the Boston Celtics organization is a “cult.”\n\n“You have to show your respect here. I think that’s what I struggled with initially, was figuring out how I’m going to be a great player here while winning championships and also leading a team and selflessly joining the Celtics’ organization or the cult that they have here.\n\n“That’s what they expect you to do as a player. They expect you to seamlessly buy into the Celtics’ pride, buy into everything Celtics. And if you don’t, then you’ll be outed.”\n\nWhat’s wrong with buying into the organization’s philosophy?\n\nJaylen Brown’s father is seven-feet tall. He used to box for Lansing Community College but never played on their team.\n\nDoris Burke, who’s been announcing games for years said of a player the other night; “I didn’t know he had that in his game.” I noticed Burke and her partners Mike Breen and JJ Redick never give us any background info on the players or coaches. And I don’t care if Breen is considered one of the best, he talks way too much and interrupts Redick often. Announcers should educate, inform and entertain. I miss Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson working the Finals.\n\nCareer numbers of Jerry West: 27 PPG, 5.8 RPG and 6.7 APG. I mentioned he was named MVP of the 1969 Finals despite losing to the Celtics, 4-3. Did you know he was also the MVP of the 1959 NCAA Final Four and West Virginia didn’t win it all. They lost to Cal in the Final game, 71-70. In the semi-finals against Louisville West had 38 points and 15 rebounds. In the finals he had 28 points and 11 assists.\n\nChicago Sky took on the Indiana Fever Sunday for the second time this season and wouldn’t you know it, there was drama that has everyone talking. Caitlin Clark drove to the basket on the left side, Angel Reese went for the block, missed the ball and hit Clark in the head. Reese was slapped with a Flagrant 1 but to me, there was nothing wrong with the play. She was trying to block the shot. Much ado about nothing.\n\n“I think we went up strong a lot of times and we didn’t get a lot of calls,” Reese said. “Going back and looking at the film, I saw a lot of calls that weren’t made. I guess some people got a special whistle.”\n\nClark was asked what was going through her mind after the foul:\n\n“What’s going through my mind is: ‘I need to make these two free throws, that’s all I’m thinking about,’” the rookie said. “It’s just a part of basketball. It is what it is, you know. She’s trying to make a play on the ball and get the block. But yeah, it happens.”\n\nBottom line is that it was a basketball play. Nothing wrong with what Reese did.\n\nFever won 91-83. Clark scored 23 points with 8 rebounds and 9 assists.\n\nHappy birthday Kristin Haynie…\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nE-Mail: SteveFinamore@yahoo.com\n\nGame 2 NBA Finals Notes: (Not takeaways or what we learned…) Celtics take a 2-0 lead with a 105-98 win. Series moves to Dallas Wednesday night. Jrue Holiday scored 26 points and pulled down 11 rebounds. In 74 minutes of action in the first two games, Holiday doesn’t have a single turnover. Mike Breen said, “hand is part of the ball.” Who started that and why? You hit my hand on a jumper, that’s a foul. Doris continues to tell us what we just watched. J.J. Redick is excellent behind the microphone. He dropped a “High quadrant iso’s,” reference. Lakers should hire him as head coach if Danny Hurley turns them down. Luka Doncic recorded a triple-double; 32-11-11. Kyrie Irving is 0-8 from distance in the first two games. PJ Washington is 1-8. Jayson Tatum had 12 assists. Who cares which Celtic player is the best. They play well together as a team. Celtics covered the spread by half a point.\n\nOne thing I dislike is bad people and bad teammates. They’re uncoachable and a pain in the ass to be around. In all my years coaching, I’ve had to deal with a few bums. You don’t want to be around these people. They’re all about themselves and try to bring others along with them. The minute things don’t go their way, they’re looking to draw attention to themselves.\n\nJrue Holiday of the Boston Celtics is the ultimate teammate and an outstanding human being. This is what he said following Game 2 of the NBA Finals.\n\nWhen talking wonderful people and a great teammate you can’t leave out Caitlin Clark. Here’s C.C. after not being selected by Team USA. This is one of the biggest snubs ever. It reminds me of the Isiah Thomas/Dream Team conspiracy. Someone clearly doesn’t want Clark on the team. Angel Reese was wondering, “Why wasn’t I chosen, it’s about me too.”\n\nGame 1 of the NBA Finals went to the Boston Celtics, 107-89. Kristaps Porzingis scored 20 points in 20 minutes off the bench. Jaylen Brown added 22. Celtics made 16 3’s. Mavericks 7. Dallas had just 9 assists. Luka Doncic led Dallas with 30 points but had just 1 assist. Kyrie Irving shot 6-19, 0-5 from distance. At one point in the game Boston led by 29 points. Game 2 is Sunday night. Boston favorite by 7.\n\nRemember how the media would talk about if a team had “x” amount of days off that they would be rusty? LOL. Boston had 9 days off. They did not look rusty. They looked fresh. Rest is good.\n\nGreat touch by the Celtics last night honoring the late, great Bill Walton. Celtics players had shooting shirts with “WALTON” on the front. And they played a cool video up on the board with Walton highlights from his Celtics days. The Big Redhead played 90 games with the Celtics from 1985-87 helping lead them to the title in 86. Injuries slowed Walton down. If not, he might’ve went down as the greatest center ever.\n\nBack in 1998, Game 3 of the NBA Finals between Bulls and Jazz, Utah scored 54 points. Chicago won 96-54. Jazz shot 21-70 from the field, 1-9 from 3. Jazz had 26 turnovers.\n\nJohnny Point Spread missed out last night, he had Mavs getting +6.5 – JPS informed me he’s looking to get even tonight with the Fever getting 1.5 on the road against the Mystics who are 0-10.\n\nI thought Cameron Brink went to Stanford? With her latest comments, she’s not very smart. What the hell is she talking about?\n\nPlease, no more Caitlin Clark/WNBA drama talk. Just play ball…I’m tired of it.\n\nDanny Hurley should stay at UConn. In a few years the Knicks job will be open, and that would be a team to coach. Lakers should go after Jay Wright.\n\n(Updated 6:10 PM) On second thought, with the money that’s being discussed, if I’m Hurley, I may think about going to LA…\n\n“When the Game Was War” by Rich Cohen is a good read. It’s about the 1987-88 NBA season, mainly the Lakers, Celtics, Bulls and Pistons.\n\nDraymond Green has a good podcast, “The Draymond Green Show.” He’s going at it with Skip Bayless. “And he comes out and says he’ll have me eating out the palm of his hands if I come on the show. I am not coming on your show, Skip. I’m going to keep skipping past you just like everybody else skipped on you. Because that show is dead, no one wants to hear you talk anymore… In the words of Richard Sherman: ‘I am better than you. I am better than you at life,’ I am just better than you. Skippin’ Skip.”\n\nOklahoma Softball won their fourth straight NCAA championship.\n\nBelmont Stakes tomorrow.\n\nHappy birthday Allen Iverson…\n\nToday is National Donut Day.\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nE-Mail: SteveFinamore@yahoo.com\n\nTonight’s the night. Mavericks-Celtics Game 1 NBA Finals. I’m pulling for the Mavericks. I want to see Luka Doncic win a ring. Celtics are -6.5 tonight. Johnny Point Spread going with Dallas plus the points.\n\nCool story from Molly McCloskey on her father, Jack. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/03/the-detroit-pistons-were-my-fathers-second-family\n\nAbove all, he hated attitude. What finally brought him to the pros—in 1972, he got a job coaching the Portland Trail Blazers, and my family moved across the country—was an inability to keep sucking up to high-school recruits. One day, he went to see a star senior in New York. The kid was spinning the ball, acting cocky. “Hey, Coach Jack,” he said, “what’s Wake Forest gonna do for me?” My father pondered this. “You know what we’re gonna do?” he replied. “We’re gonna stick that ball right up your ass.” Then he walked out.\n\nAnd they say kids have changed? No they haven’t. What’s changed is the people and things around them.\n\nNote to Danny Hurley – don’t you dare even think about going to LA to coach the Lakers. It’ll never work. Stay where you are. Don’t mess with happy.\n\nCongratulations to Saddi Washington. The former Michigan Wolverines assistant coach has been hired at Michigan State.\n\nDraymond Green and Rasheed Wallace on social media talking about who would win the 2004 Detroit Pistons or 2017 Golden State Warriors. That’s easy – Warriors would win. But the game is so different today.\n\nWhy isn’t Tim Legler on the pre and post game shows on ESPN? He’s better than all the clowns they have on now.\n\nNancy Lieberman said she would’ve punched the cheap shot artist on the Chicago Sky in the face. There you go. Clark should’ve got up and went after the cheap shot artist herself.\n\nAngel Reece recently said fans not only go to games to watch one person (she means Caitlin Clark) that they come to see her too. Next game she gets thrown out. How irresponsible is that?\n\nSomeone sent me these attendance figures for last weekend’s WNBA games.\n\nRIP Mike Vorkapich – father of former Michigan State strength coach, Mike Vorkapich passed away. He was 94.\n\nMemorial service for Dan Fife will be held June 29th, 1:00 PM at Clarkston High School gym.\n\nI am on my 26th straight day without going to Starbucks. I make my coffee at home now.\n\nWhat’s this world coming to? Two guys order a pizza, ask for it to be delivered to a dorm on the campus of Michigan State. When the delivery guy arrives, they jump him and steal his money. Come on man…\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nE-Mail: SteveFinamore@yahoo.com\n\n(The New Yorker)\n\nFormer NBA player Matt Barnes came out and blasted Caitlin Clark’s teammates for not coming to her defense when she got knocked down with a cheap shot by the Chicago Sky player (I’m not going to mention the player from the Sky, ever again.) The W.N.B.A. wanted publicity, now they have it but not for basketball. It’s about the drama.\n\n“I mean, throughout the season, she’s been getting beat up. Hard screens, elbows, knocked down. It is what it is; she’s not the first, she won’t be the last. My issue and my question is, Where the f–k are her teammates at? Where y’all at? Where are the rest of the Indiana Fever at? I’ve seen a couple of girls smirk when she’s got knocked down, half-ass to pick her up. Like, y’all supposed to protect the asset, protect the star. And although this is a team, you always protect your star. I was someone who protected the stars. You f–k with Kobe, [Chris Paul], Blake [Griffin], the list goes on, it’s going to be a problem. You guys are supposed to be a family. And you wonder why you sit at the bottom of the league right now, it’s because y’all don’t protect each other, man. Coach don’t do s–t about it, players don’t do s–t about it. Y’all should be ashamed of it. But the rest of the league is going to continue to test her. That’s what they’re supposed to do. It’s your guys’ f–king job to have her back, and to have each others’ backs. Got to do better, ladies.”\n\nThe Chicago Sky player who shoved Clark said all Clark can do is shoot 3’s. LOL. That’s a joke. Clark is current;y 4th in the league in assists. She’s the Big Ten’s all-time leader in that stat. 4th all-time in college history. All she can do is shoot 3’s? I don’t think so.\n\nDan Dakich has an outstanding view on the whole Caitlin Clark vs the W.N.B.A. I highly recommend you go search for his take on OutKick. People are jealous of her. Plain and simple. She’s rich, attractive, down to earth and can play ball.\n\nPat McAfee jumped in. He is crazy calling Clark, “a white bitch.” He’s right about the mention of this “rookie class.” There’s only one star and that’s Clark. The others are role players. If it weren’t for Clark, no one would be talking or watching.\n\nStephen A. Smith got after it with some girl named Monica McNutt. I listened and read about it; I still don’t know what the hell they are talking about?\n\nThe great Maurice Lucas (RIP) was one of the best enforcers the game has ever seen. The Indiana Fever need a female version of him.\n\nAngel Reese said it’s not just about Catlin Clark for the WNBA being popular this season. “I know I’ll go down in history,” Reese told reporters Monday. “I’ll look back in 20 years and be like: ‘Yeah, the reason why we’re watching women’s basketball is not just because of one person, it’s because of me too, and I want you to realize that.” LOL. That’s a joke. Reese is famous because of Caitlin Clark. Reese is a role player. And that’s all she will ever be.\n\nCarl from Brooklyn writes: “Legend in her own mind. The only way young girls will get her jersey is giveaway night.”\n\nJohnny Point Spread back from Vegas: “If you saw Caitlin Clark walking through an airport you would recognize her. If you saw Angel Reese walking through an airport, you wouldn’t know who in the hell she was.”\n\nGained a lot of respect for Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon for coming out and saying the bush league foul on Clark “was not appropriate and not what we do or who we are.”\n\nI’m done reading the USA Today. I will never, ever read that rag again. Kendall Baker of Yahoo Sports AM has an excellent daily sports news e-mail. Highly recommend subscribing.\n\nNBA Finals just a few days away. Can’t wait. I’m pulling for the Mavericks. I want to see Luka Doncic win a ring.\n\nGilbert Arenas says Steph Curry is not a generational player. LOL. Curry changed the game. And he’s the all-time leader in 3’s made. With 4 championships. He’s got more titles than Jerry West and Oscar Robertson combined.\n\nHow about the mother who says she doesn’t put her shopping cart back? Awful message she’s sending. This is why our country is crumbling. Like Bill Parcells once said, “it’s not the kids that have changed, it’s the people and things around them that have changed.”\n\n“I’m not returning my shopping cart and you can judge me all you want. I’m not getting my groceries into the car, getting my children into the car and then leaving them in the car to go return the cart. So if you’re going to give me a dirty look, f— off.”\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/mom-hammered-tiktok-video-why-170500097.html\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nGame 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals went to the Boston Celtics last night, 133-128. The C’s needed OT to take a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nI won’t sit here and write about the game – but I will tell you it came down to a “foul or defend” in regulation. Pacers on defense, up 3 with 8 seconds remaining. Celtics had the ball under their own basket. Celtics got off a 3, made it, sent the game into OT and it was all she wrote. Instead of fouling on the catch and sending Jaylen Brown to the foul line, Indiana failed to foul, not to mention TJ McConnell didn’t switch out on him, so Brown knocked down the game tying 3 from the left corner. JJ Redick and Doris Bourke gave all kinds of excuses – never once explaining what should have happened with Indiana’s defense. “It’s harder than you think,” said Redick about fouling up 3. And of course Doris “The Obvious” agreed with him.\n\nPacers attempted 10 free-throws in the game – Celtics 30.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. took responsibility and held himself accountablele for the Nuggets losing to the Timberwolves. Love this., It’s rare in today’s game you hear this.\n\nThere’s too much talking back to the officials when a foul is called. Now it’s moving to the women’s game. And how come players don’t raise their hands anymore when there is a foul called on them?\n\nNote to the New York Knicks – do not sign someone or trade for someone just because they are an all-star and their jersey is a top seller. Lot of guys out there who get their numbers but are not winners.\n\nBill Spooner, former NBA ref called Chris Paul the “biggest a-hole he has ever had to deal with.”\n\nStephen A. Smith left Isiah Thomas off a list of “small guards who had great playoff runs.” It was a dumb thing to do whether you like Thomas or not.\n\nI have known Jemele Hill since 1999. I have no problem with her views on race. But she’s way off base with her latest comment on Caitlin Clark.\n\nThe Fever-Liberty game this past Saturday broke the record for most viewers ever in the WNBA on ABC.\n\nESPN’s in-game interview with the coaches is dumb. Not necessary.\n\nChazz Palminteri has a great podcast. Listen to his latest episode with Jennifer Esposito. It’s outstanding.\n\nAlways play the right way…\n\nE-Mail: SteveFinamore@yahoo.com\n\nI’m sorry but we’re making too big of a deal over this Catlin Clark-Gregg Doyel thing.\n\nAngel Reese went to the Met Gala, so what?\n\nTravis Kelce kissed Taylor Swift, who cares?\n\nThe Boston Celtics ripped the Cleveland Cavaliers 120-95 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. How about Cleveland fans chanting, “We want Boston, We want Boston,” in Game 7 against Orlando. No you don’t. Be careful what you wish for…\n\nCeltics made 18 3’s.\n\nThunder crushed the Mavericks in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semi-Finals, 117-95.\n\nGame 2 Eastern Conference Semi-Finals tonight between Pacers and Knicks. Knicks have lost Mitchell Robinson for 6-8 weeks. He injured his ankle in Game 1.\n\nThere was a play in Game 1 of Pacers-Knicks where OG Anunoby dove on the floor for a loose ball. I clipped it and sent it to a college coach. “First to the floor,” coach said. “Matter of fact, only one on the floor.” OG makes winning plays.\n\nReggie Miller is joining Stan Van Gundy and Brian Anderson for Game 2 on TNT. I really don’t want to mute the game but Miller may make me.\n\nI had no problem with Rudy Gobert missing a basketball game for the birth of his child.\n\nDan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports has a good piece on “Inside the NBA.” https://sports.yahoo.com/please-save-inside-the-nba-170647304.html\n\nPat Riley is 100% correct about Jimmy Butler. “Shut up!”\n\nWay too many gambling ads on TV.\n\nThe NIL and Transfer Portal has helped college athletics. Wonder if there is a list that is public where we can see the athletes in the Portal?\n\nHappy birthday Speedy Claxton."
