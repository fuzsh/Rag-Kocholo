They have plenty of pieces to give for a max player on a team that stumbles...Blake? Aldridge? Millsap?\n\nToo late on one of them\n\nMarc Stein âœ” @ESPNSteinLine\n\nLeague source confirms @olgunuluc report from Down Under that veteran NBA guard Steve Blake is signing with the Sydney Kings in Australia.\n\n7:58 PM - 21 Oct 2016\n\nTough to bet the under because they'll definitely be in the market to add another stud as the season progresses. They have plenty of pieces to give for a max player on a team that stumbles...Blake? Aldridge? Millsap?\n\nYea, having the swap with BRK pick for the next yer, and their outright pick in 2018 is kinda ridiculous. Especially when this is what that team is putting out there for a 15 man roster. ooooooffff\n\nLin/Vasquez/Whitehead/\n\nHollis-Jefferson/Foye/Kilpatrick\n\nBogdanovich/Harris/Levert\n\nBooker/Bennett/McCullough\n\nLopez/Scola/Hamilton\n\nUmmmm\n\nAl Horford and Jae Crowder are out injured. Kind of hard to stick with an 8 man rotation (not that any team actually has an 8 man rotation in the regular season anyway), when 2 of your starters are out\n\nUmmmm.\n\nHe was using a double digit rotation before they went down. In fact he's used a double digit rotation from game 1.\n\nI'm not looking to create a heated argument or bash anyone here. I just don't like the philosophy of using 10-12 guys. (except of course unless they are getting blown out).\n\nOn another note, Mickey looks like he's taken a giant step backward in his time this early in the season.\n\nThis team is one stud / paint enforcer away from being a scary good team.\n\nTheir a paint enforcer and an Ray Allen type 3 point shooting machine away from being Champions.\n\nAmir Johnson frustrates me like no one else on this roster. I'd rather see Zeller starting over Amir.\n\nI'd trade Olynk (he's still too soft), Amir (he disappears for entire games) and one of those next two #1 Net's picks to get what is needed. I'd throw in Terry Rozier in any deal that is necessary to sweeten a pot.\n\nPretty excited for the 2018/19 season.\n\nThere was a preview special on tv last night and they were discussing the Celtics biggest issue ... playing time and who gets shots.\n\nSuch a good problem to have but really so much talent on this team it's going to be hard getting everyone the ball / stats that they deserve.\n\nAssuming the starting lineup is; Kyrie, Brown, Hayward, Tatum, Horford\n\nOK, Horford can go without ... but the other 4 will want to score with recognition and future contracts on the line. Curious to see how this plays out.\n\nPretty excited for the 2018/19 season.\n\nThere was a preview special on tv last night and they were discussing the Celtics biggest issue ... playing time and who gets shots.\n\nSuch a good problem to have but really so much talent on this team it's going to be hard getting everyone the ball / stats that they deserve.\n\nAssuming the starting lineup is; Kyrie, Brown, Hayward, Tatum, Horford\n\nOK, Horford can go without ... but the other 4 will want to score with recognition and future contracts on the line.

Curious to see how this plays out.\n\nI wonder if it makes more sense to bring Hayward off the bench? At minimum, he'll be playing fewer minutes than the rest of the starters as his body gets back into NBA form. Also, I wonder how often we'll see Rozier playing the 1 with Kyrie playing off ball?\n\nI wonder if it makes more sense to bring Hayward off the bench?

He needs to be a starter and the fastest way to get him in that role is to just start him there.\n\nBut I'm sure Stevens will try about 7,000 different lineup configurations. You will definitely see some Rozier/Kyrie combos.\n\nGreat article here on Kyrie and the Celtics in general coming into this season.\n\nSo unbelievably excited about this season.\n\nIt is a point of grief to see young people who don't feel a need or obligation to argue with the gods when inspiration seizes them, but i have to admit that, if i'm going to kill God, this is how it goes. maybe the ultimate set-aside is that, because of pure talent, members of oppressed races &amp; classes will have first crack at that. poetic justice....\n\nkyrie irving is that way - the yeezy of b-ball. i was bothered by his leadership of my team for just that reason until he recently formed a love connection with maaaacus smaaaat as his literal wingman. that could be sum'n.\n\nJayrod said:\n\nDon't look now, but things are clicking.\n\nBrad has found a few of the right buttons and the boys are playing together again.\n\nyeah, there's flow again with Maaaacus Smaaaat setting the high screens for Kyrie that the young bucks can't/won't. and i dont know if it was the rest or getting the share of the ball he wants on the 2nd unit, but Jaylen Brown (who may be a slow starter anyway) looked great. scrubs of the East are gonna loooove facing JB, Hayward &amp; Rozier for their minutes every night.\n\nand i'm a LOT less scared of the Sixers after watching them twice this week. Simmons &amp; Embiid STILL havent developed a relationship, both their games are devolving and the new guys (Butler, Chandler &amp; Muscala) haven't been integrated into the \"playbook\" yet. Simmons and Butler actually looked happier on JoJo's nite off Friday and, when you play better ball without the best post since Shaq, sumn's very wrong. It's kinda good i'm boycotting the FFA b-ball thread cuz all i'd be doing is arguing with Sixers fans over what an utter void their coach is."
