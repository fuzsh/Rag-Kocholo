He was then recruited to become the strength and conditioning coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, where he spent six seasons, including Kobe Bryant’s final four years in the league.\n\nEven when the ink is dry on someone’s new contract, they don’t become a true part of their new team until the players fully embrace them. In this episode, TD tells the hilarious story of how this happened with the Lakers squad before a game with their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics.\n\nListen up as TD shares how:\n\nHe grew up idolizing Larry Bird and the Celtics\n\nGary Vitti recruited him for the Lakers\n\nMitch Kupchak taught a valuable lesson about the Celtics-Lakers rivalry\n\nMetta World Peace and Steve Blake planned his initiation into the Lakers family\n\nMetta’s lateness led to an unusual ceremony at half court on the Celtics’ iconic leprechaun"
