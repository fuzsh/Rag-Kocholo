        "text": "With Robert Williams no longer in the picture as a result of last Sunday’s trade for Jrue Holiday, Brad Stevens and the Celtics are searching high and low and stocking up on any and every big man the secondary market has to offer.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, that led the club to former Oregon State standout Kylor Kelley.\n\nA 7-footer who has seemingly played all over the world at this point, the 26-year-old Kelley will join the Celtics on an Exhibit 10 contract, according to Keith Smith. If the ‘Exhibit 10’ part of that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the contrat that ex-Boston big man Tacko Fall signed when he first joined the Celtics way back in 2019.\n\nMost recently, Kelley played with Raptors 905 of the G League, and averaged 7.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 15.3 minutes per game over a 21-game run with the club.\n\nPrior to his time with Toronto’s G League squad, the Utah-born Kelley played for the Austin Spurs of the G League, the Bakken Bears (Denmark), and the London Lions (United Kingdom). Prior to his signing with the Celtics, Kelley had signed on with the Calgary Surge of the Canadian Elite Basketball League.\n\nAt Oregon State from 2018 through 2020, Kelley proved to be a dynamic defensive player for the Beavers, and was a two-time Pac-12 All-Defensive Team player. Kelley also began Oregon State’s all-time blocks leader during his second season with the program, and finished with 211 total blocks for the Beavers.\n\nCeltics unveil 2023 training camp roster\n\nTy Anderson is 98.5 The Sports Hub’s friendly neighborhood straight-edge kid.
