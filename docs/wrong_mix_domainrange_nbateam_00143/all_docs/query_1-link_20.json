        "text": "Hello, I am Jake Davidson and every week I will be writing a sports column commenting on what is happening in the world of professional and collegiate athletics.\n\nFor all those Laker fans out there who think that their team is going to coast to a three peat, I am sorry, but you are sorely mistaken. For all those bandwagoners who are suddenly devout Heat fans and think that the combination of team trinity (Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, and Chris Bosh) will overpower teams with superior talent, well, pick a new team.\n\nNow who does that leave? The answer, as much as it pains me to say it, is the big, bad Boston Celtics.Before you all laugh and say that they are too old, let me explain why they will bring home their eighteenth banner this year and hoist the Jim O’Brien trophy at the end of the year.\n\nReason #1: Rajon Rondo is an unstoppable force\n\nFor all the people whose only memory of Rajon Rondo is Kobe Bryant sagging off him in the 2008 finals, well, it is time to introduce you to the most dynamic player in the NBA. Rajon Rondo, not Lebron James, is the most likely candidate to average a triple double. While he still has some flaws in his shot, no point guard in the league can stay in front of Rajon Rondo. His fake behind the back pass is the greatest move in the game at the moment.\n\nReason #2: The O’Neals\n\nWhat cost Boston the championship series last year? Well, a lack of depth when Kendrick Perkins got hurt. But on a larger scale, it was the Celtics’ inability to crash the boards. The secret in the NBA is that size does matter.\n\nSo what did the Celtics do? Danny Ainge (Boston GM) went out and picked up two of the most dominant big men this past decade to bolster an already talented inside game. While Shaq and Jermaine both may be injury prone and their skills might have deteriorated from their prime, one thing remains the same: they are 7 feet tall!\n\nReason #3: They have done it before\n\nI will come out and say it, there will be a point this season when the Celtics look old and on a downslide. They could even remain a middling 500 team for a good portion of the season, as they were last year going 17-17 from December to March. However, at the end of the day, the Celtics know how to win. This same core has reached the finals two out of three years. Ray Allen still is automatic from the line connecting on over 90 percent of his free throws, Kevin Garnett is still a great defender and team leader, and Paul Pierce still can use his size and craftiness to wear opponents down.\n\nIf they enter the playoffs healthy, then the Celtics will win the NBA title."
