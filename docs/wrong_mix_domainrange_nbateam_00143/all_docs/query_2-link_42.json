        "text": "LOS ANGELES - It was just four years ago that the Celtics were beaten by the Lakers, and coach Doc Rivers went around the visitors' locker room and collected $100 from every player and coach. He removed a ceiling tile and hid the money behind it, then told his players they would be coming back in June to collect it.\n\nSuch was the Celtics' self-assurance in this, the NBA's most storied rivalry, that they indeed returned to Los Angeles for the NBA finals, where they got their hands on their cash but not another championship trophy, losing a crushing seventh game to the Lakers.\n\nThese days, though, hubris is on hiatus.\n\nThat much was clear on Friday when the Lakers' 101-92 comeback victory over Boston was sparked by Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks, who had been acquired the day before as spare parts from Golden State.\n\nIt was a sign of the depths to which these two franchises have sunk. The Celtics, who have lost 25 of their last 32 games, blew a 13-point second-half lead enabling the Lakers, who have lost 23 of their last 29, to snap a franchise-record eight-game home losing streak and escape the Western Conference cellar.\n\nIt appears all but certain that for only the second time in 65 seasons, the Celtics (19-37) and the Lakers (19-36) will miss the playoffs in the same season. (That happened previously in 1994.)\n\nNot even Kobe Bryant is likely to rescue the Lakers. The team announced on Friday that his knee had continued to swell, and that he would be re-evaluated in three weeks, increasing the likelihood that he will not return this season.\n\nIf ESPN was compelled to broadcast Friday's game, it was not a must-see game for the usual celebrities. Jack Nicholson took the night off, and Floyd Mayweather, accompanied by his entourage, made his way to a courtside seat more than halfway through the second quarter. He did so while carrying on a cellphone conversation.\n\nStaples Center was full, and for much of the night, the crowd dutifully booed the Celtics, particularly the one recognizable villain, Rajon Rondo, and Kris Humphries, still a scoundrel in Kardashianland. But there was clearly an absence of venom.\n\nThat old edge, though, arrived early in the fourth quarter when Bazemore jumped into the stands trying to save a ball - exchanging high-fives with several fans before returning to the court - and Brooks, who began the season as a Celtic, notched three steals. A majority of Bazemore's 15 points and Brooks' 14 came in the final period as the Lakers charged in front.\n\nWhen the buzzer sounded, the crowd rewarded the Lakers with a standing ovation, a rarity this season.\n\n“It was the first time it felt fun in a while,\" center Chris Kaman said.\n\nTo some, it almost felt like old times. Before the game, Cedric Maxwell and Kurt Rambis, who traded elbows during the knock-down, drag-out 1980s, commiserated over the current state of affairs. The only pride they could take was looking up on the walls where - as in Boston - the only banners that hang are championship ones.\n\n\"The Garden would be like the United Nations if they hung division banners like some teams,\" said Maxwell, a radio and television analyst for the team. “It's only the big flags.\"\n\nRambis, an assistant coach with the Lakers, said: “In some organizations, if you win 40 games, everybody goes woo-hoo. But it means nothing to these organizations. Both organizations understand that anything short of winning a championship is basically a wasted year on some level.“\n\nFans in Boston - after the Celtics jettisoned Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett last summer and hired Brad Stevens to replace Rivers as coach - have mostly been patient.\n\nThey are smart enough to understand that better days could soon be at hand with six first-round draft picks in the next three years, which can be used on young talent or as trade chips to surround point guard Rondo, who is working his way back from a torn knee ligament.\n\n“They understand the situation,\" Boston forward Gerald Wallace said. “Other than selling out every night like we used to, we're getting a pretty good crowd for the record we have.“\"\n\nThe Lakers' plans are less clear. They chose not to deal Jordan Hill or Pau Gasol at the trading deadline Thursday, sending only Steve Blake to the Warriors for Bazemore and Brooks. They could have as much as $24 million in cap space this summer to lure a free agent to play with Bryant.\n\nBut to some that sounds suspiciously like the plan last summer.\n\nRather than go into full-scale rebuilding after Dwight Howard left as a free agent for Houston last year, the Lakers retooled their roster with skilled wing players on short-term contracts, hoping that a return to health by Bryant and Steve Nash, along with a training camp under coach Mike D'Antoni, would allow them to compete in the Western Conference.\n\nA promising start vanished in a wave of injuries. Bryant has played only six games, and Nash has been limited to 10. Also out Friday were Xavier Henry and Nick Young for the Lakers, who have missed an NBA-leading 200 games because of injury.\n\n“If you put any team in the NBA through this type of adversity, they'd be in the exact same position,\" said Jordan Farmar, whose two stints on the disabled list surprisingly did not include strained credulity. “Take LeBron off Miami, and they'd be in the same situation. It's definitely not an excuse, but it's a reality. We're just trying to figure it out.\"\n\nSo, too, are the Celtics.\n\nStevens expressed exasperation over his team's ability to respond to adversity. But if Stevens, a rookie NBA coach at 37, has gained many new experiences this season, an immersion into an old rivalry is not quite one of them.\n\n“A lot of us in the locker room have never been a part of those games, but I think everybody gets it, and I think everybody at different times throughout their lives have watched it in awe,\" said Stevens, who grew up outside Indianapolis. “Certainly, I would be an example of that. When you were a kid in the '80s, this is what was on TV. It felt like Boston and LA were playing every Sunday. I don't think that's probably true. But it was the only game I felt like ever got on TV, so those were the games we watched.“\"\n\nIf Magic and Bird seem like ancient history, at the moment so do Bryant and Pierce. What Friday's game illustrated was that these two franchises are inextricably linked, and that if the Lakers and the Celtics can refashion themselves as contenders, neither one would mind company.\n\n“Hopefully,\" Stevens said, “both of us are not where we are for long.\""
