        "text": "There's also a Wellesley mansion on the market with its own indoor sports court honoring the playoff contenders.\n\nCeltics fans have a shot at Al Horford’s house, Blake Griffin‘s condo, and their own mini basketball court.\n\nAl Horford\n\nAs the Celtics say hello to the Eastern Conference finals, Al Horford is saying goodbye to his six-bed, 7.5-bath home in Brookline. The star center listed his modern beauty for $8,995,000.\n\nSet on just over an acre, the modern-style home, built in 2021, is high on privacy, with a fenced-in perimeter and with a wrought-iron gate.\n\nCustom glass doors serve as a greeting in the two-story, 230-square-foot foyer, where a grand staircase ascends. The buzzer-beating kitchen comes with top-of-the-line appliances from Sub-Zero, Miele, and Wolf, and there’s also a wine room and walk-in pantry. A 163-square-foot breakfast nook is ideal for busy mornings — or for grabbing a snack at halftime.\n\nThe first floor also features a 362-square-foot formal living room, a 260-square-foot formal dining room, and a junior primary suite with a balcony. There are also two half bathrooms and a 595-square-foot family room.\n\nUpstairs, you’ll find four suites, all with walk-in closets. The primary suite boasts plenty of grandeur: a dressing room, 141-square-foot walk-in closet, and a luxe bath.\n\nHost a screening of “Celtic Pride” in the 352-square-foot movie theater. There’s more than 2,200 square feet of unfinished space here on the lower level, too. Outside, impeccable landscaping and a deck will impress your guests — even the ones who are Lakers fans.\n\nGeorge Sarkis of the Sarkis Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate has the listing, but neither he nor Douglas Elliman could comment at the time of publication.\n\nBlake Griffin\n\nIt’s not just homes of current Celtics hitting the market. Blake Griffin is enjoying retirement, and the Millennium Tower condo where the former basketball star lived when he played one season with the Celtics is up for grabs.\n\nUnit 5502 is a three-bed, 4.5-bath beauty listed for $6,825,000. Measuring 3,172 square feet, the 55th-floor unit was Griffin’s home during the 2022-2023 season. He announced his full retirement from basketball just last month.\n\n“It was turnkey everything,” said David Murdock of Boston Real Estate Group at Compass, who has the listing. “It was rented furnished, down to the linens and pots and pans. He was a nice guy too — an ideal tenant.”\n\nThe rent for the unit was $35,000 per month, which was a record at the time, Murdock said. The owners, who had already purchased a home in Brookline, left the property “basically as is” for Griffin.\n\nThe home welcomes you in the 162-square-foot foyer, which leads seamlessly into the 685-square-foot great room. Boasting 12.5-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and wireless motorized shades, the great room features modern glass chandeliers and a gas fireplace.\n\nOf course, the views are exceptional.\n\n“You can see the State House down to over Marina Bay from the living room,” Murdock said. “I think it’s the most comfortable, elegant layout I’ve ever seen.”\n\nYou’ll find a spacious island and built-in bench seating in the kitchen. There are also Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances, a full-sized wine fridge, Calacatta marble counters with waterfall edges, and white Poggenpohl cabinets. An elegant dining room is the perfect space for entertaining before the game.\n\nEach of the three bedrooms is en-suite, but the 308-square-foot primary bedroom is the picture of decadence, thanks to stunning views of the Back Bay, two custom walk-in closets, and two bathrooms, including one with a soaking tub.\n\nOne of the most luxurious aspects of life in Millennium Tower is its amenities. The building’s offerings include lounges, a swimming pool and hot tub, a spa and fitness center, a billiards room, a movie theater, a golf simulator, and on-site dining.\n\nThe outside (the city) cut\n\nOf course, if you’re a Celtics fan who prefers suburban life, there is an option for you in a bucolic setting: a Wellesley mansion with an indoor basketball court. The property is listed for $6,350,000.\n\nThe home at 149 Benvenue St. is a five-bed, eight-bath (6 full, 2 half) mansion with its own sports wing, including an indoor basketball court emblazoned with the Celtics name. Easily reached thanks to a staircase down to the walk-in lower level from the two-story foyer, this floor features an expansive rec room with a wet bar. There’s also a golf simulator, a workout room, and a wine cellar.\n\nJust a few steps to the exterior, you’ll find a year-round, in-ground hot tub, and a heated swimming pool. There’s a full built-in grill and outdoor kitchen.\n\n“It is really like a luxury hotel,” said Debi Benoit of William Raveis Real Estate, who has the listing.\n\nBack on the main floor, an open kitchen, which measures 350 square feet, features custom cabinetry, granite counters, top-of-the-line appliances, and a cozy fireplace. It flows into the 520-square-foot family room. The formal dining room measures 360 square feet and features a marble gas fireplace, and the 320-square-foot office has extensive built-in bookshelves, ideal for working from home.\n\nThe primary suite, which measures 330 square feet, features a white marble fireplace and a private balcony overlooking the property. There’s also an walk-in closet, dressing room, and luxurious bathroom.\n\nA one-bedroom pool house, not included in the square footage tally, offers a kitchenette, gas fireplace, laundry, and prime access to the pool. The home’s exterior also features a rolling lawn and half-basketball court.\n\n“I just love the ambiance of this house and the ease of living in this house,” Benoit said. “There’s just so much to do — and no reason to leave.”\n\nUnless you have playoff tickets."
