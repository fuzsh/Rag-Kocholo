        "text": "This NBA championship means so much to so many people. It is only fair to stop and give credit to the people that made it all possible. So let’s hand out rings to everyone that deserves one! (Note: the Celtics will make those decisions and this is just one man’s humble suggestion list)\n\nThe Current Team\n\nObviously everyone on the current team gets their rings. But allow me some time to appreciate them each in turn.\n\nAl Horford - While it is hard to rank who I’m most happy for on this team, Horford has to be right at the top of any such list. A pro’s pro, a vet’s vet, a man’s man, and now a champion. I thought he had a Hall of Fame resume already (reminder that he has two college titles ,too) but this cements it.\n\nThe Jays - Forever linked even though “they” tried to tear them apart. Continuously questioned, belittled, and mocked. But as Tatum said last night: “What are they going to say now?”\n\nDerrick White - The silent storm. The humble hero. The superstar role player. He’ll never pound his chest, but he’ll leave his teeth on the floor.\n\nKristaps Porzingis - KP had his own trials, humbling situations, and a long road to redemption. But from the moment he became a Boston Celtic, he has been grinning from ear to ear because he understood what this all means.\n\nJrue Holiday - Now he has a pair of rings. He brought so much poise and experience with him. Just the right final touch to this roster.\n\nJoe Mazzulla - Another vindication story. Thrust into the lead job in less than ideal circumstances. Forced to learn on the job under the deepest scrutiny. Never stopped being himself. Never stopped believing in his philosophy. That’s our sicko coach.\n\nBrad Stevens - The architect, the mastermind, the Growth Mentality Magi.\n\nWyc Grousbeck, Steve Pagliuca, and the Celtics ownership group - The ultimate compliment I can give to any ownership group is this: They get it.\n\nEveryone Else - Everyone played a part. From Pritchard’s half court heaves to Hauser’s no-dip 3’s to Kornet’s kontests, to every bench player going nuts when someone did something special. Everyone played their parts. Everyone gets a ring.\n\nLegends of Yesteryear\n\nA somber request to give rings of honor and respect to the families of the legends from the past that aren’t around to enjoy this moment.\n\nBill Russell, Bill Walton, Tommy Heinsohn, Sam Jones, KC Jones, Johnny Most and all the legends we’ve lost in recent years.\n\nHeather Walker’s family in honor of the beloved long-time PR executive.\n\nI’m sure there are countless more behind the scenes that helped make all this possible and deserve rings of their own.\n\nThe Loved Ones\n\nDeuce Tatum - Give Deuce his own miniature ring!\n\nLauren Holiday and all the wives, girlfriends, and loved ones all deserve rings for the parts that they played behind the scenes.\n\nOld Friends\n\nMarcus Smart - Give Marcus a ring. He helped make this group what it is today. He fought through all those prior battles and left his heart and soul on the floor every game. It kills me that he wasn’t part of this run, but his fingerprints are all over the place. He deserves a ring, too.\n\nDanny Ainge - Speaking of fingerprints, we don’t have Tatum and Brown if Danny doesn’t pull off the trade of the century with the Nets. He also had the foresight to draft Tatum and Brown when the consensus leaned in other directions. He laid the foundation for Brad Stevens to build upon.\n\nIsaiah Thomas - When it looked like we were headed into a long rebuilding phase, IT came along and made things really, really fun again.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nRobert Williams III - It also pains me to see Rob Williams not get a ring. He was so fun and such a fan favorite. I hope he somehow finds a way to stay on the court in the future and get a ring of his own.\n\nBlake Griffin - Blake had his opportunities to come back for this one, but he decided that his playing days are through, and I respect that.\n\nAll the fun personalities that came and went without a title. From Tacko Fall to Daniel Theis to Aron Baynes to Vítor Faverani ...and even all the shorter players too! I wish we could give rings to all of them, but we have to save money for the luxury tax bills that are coming.\n\nNote: I’m sure I’m missing a TON. Feel free to add your own in the comments below.\n\nSarcastic Mentions\n\nLet’s send out some tinfoil rings to some folks that “deserve” to be mentioned as well.\n\nMikhail Prokhorov, Bobby Marks, and the Nets - Without them, we don’t have the Jays.\n\nThe Sixers and Lakers front offices - Both teams passed on both Tatum and Brown in the draft. The Sixers also gave up on both Al Horford and Jrue Holiday. They have only themselves to blame.\n\nKyrie Irving - Like him or not, he’s part of the overall story. Those experiences taught this team a lot and probably had a hand in influencing the kinds of players they brought in after he left. It is also kind of appropriate that Kyrie “helped” the Celtics in this series as well.\n\nMost Valuable Fans\n\nCelticsBlog readers - What a way to celebrate our 20th Anniversary! You all were a part of this journey and boy did we go through a lot with this team over the years. Thank you for all you do. You all deserve rings of your own.\n\nEveryone everywhere that loves the Celtics! - I mean, why stop with the blog? Celtics Nation expands around the globe. Find yourself another Celtics fan and give them a huge hug and embrace the moment together. Maybe we won’t all be getting diamond encrusted rings, but the memories and moments we’re sharing together are worth infinitely more."
