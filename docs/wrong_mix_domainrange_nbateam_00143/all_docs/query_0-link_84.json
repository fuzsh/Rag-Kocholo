        "text": "BASKETBALL\n\nNBA champions for sale\n\nThe ownership group that controls the NBA champion Boston Celtics said it intends to sell all its shares of the team. In a statement released Monday, Boston Basketball Partners LLC said it intends to sell the majority of its shares in 2024 or early 2025. The balance of its shares would then close in 2028. Wyc Grousbeck, whose family leads the ownership group, is expected to remain the team's NBA governor until the sale is complete. \"The controlling family of the ownership group, after considerable thought and internal discussion, has decided to sell the team for estate and family planning considerations,\" the statement said. The Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals last month to capture the franchise's 18th championship. Boston Basketball Partners -- led by venture capitalist Grousbeck, his father and investor H. Irving Grousbeck, along with venture capitalist Steve Pagliuca -- purchased the Celtics for $360 million from the Gaston family in 2002. The Gastons had owned the team since 1983.\n\nGOLF\n\nBland wins U.S. Senior Open\n\nRichard Bland shot a 4-under 66 in the final round of the U.S. Senior Open, catching leader Hiroyuki Fujita after rain postponed the finish to Monday morning and then banging a chip shot off the pin to beat him on the fourth playoff hole and win his second consecutive senior major. The Senior PGA champion gained five shots on Fujita in the final round, which was delayed by thunderstorms Sunday afternoon with eight holes remaining. When the golfers returned to the par-70, 7,024-yard Newport (R.I.) Country Club on Monday, Fujita's consistency -- he hit 38 straight fairways in regulation before the rain delay -- had abandoned him.After both posted 13 under in regulation and matched scores in a two-hole, aggregate playoff and the first hole of sudden death, the golfers returned to the par-4, 466-yard 18th hole for the fourth time of the day. Bland's shot from a greenside bunker caught the pin and settled 2 inches from the cup; Fujita missed a 25-footer to prolong the tournament, and Bland tapped in to claim his second senior major in as many tries. Richard Green shot 71 and finished third at 10 under, one stroke ahead of Steve Stricker. Ken Duke (Arkadelphia, Henderson State) finished tied for 23rd at 1 under.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nGruden loses court rehearing\n\nJon Gruden lost a bid Monday for three Nevada Supreme Court justices to reconsider whether a lawsuit he filed against the NFL over emails leaked to the media before he resigned as coach of the Las Vegas Raiders should be heard in court or in private arbitration. Attorneys for Gruden, the league and an NFL spokesman didn't respond to messages after a two-word order -- \"Rehearing denied\" -- was posted on a court website. It wasn't immediately clear whether Gruden will seek a hearing before the entire seven-member state high court. Gruden's lawyers sought a rehearing after the three-justice panel split in a May 14 decision that said the league can move the civil contract interference and conspiracy case out of state court and into arbitration that might be overseen by one of the defendants, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Gruden's lawsuit, filed in November 2021, alleges Goodell and the league forced him to resign from the Raiders by leaking racist, sexist and homophobic emails that he sent years earlier when he was at ESPN.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nNimmo falls, misses game\n\nNew York Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo missed Monday night's game against the Nationals after being injured in a fall in his hotel room overnight. Manager Carlos Mendoza said Nimmo cut his forehead in the fal, but did not have a concussion. \"In the middle of the night he woke up, needed to go to the bathroom and slipped,\" Mendoza said. \"Hit his forehead so he's got a pretty big cut.\" Mendoza said Nimmo called the Mets trainers, who went to his room to assist him. Nimmo was still at the hospital Monday afternoon, but Mendoza said the outfielder was coming to the ballpark. \"He went through all the tests (Monday) morning,\" Mendoza said. \"Wanted to make sure we weren't missing anything, Luckily everything came back negative, so I think we got lucky there.\" The 31-year-old outfielder has been with the Mets for nine s\n\nSOCCER\n\nSt. Louis City fires coach\n\nSt. Louis City has fired Coach Bradley Carnell amid a disappointing second season for the Major League Soccer team. The team announced the move Monday two days after blowing a two-goal lead in a 4-3 loss to Vancouver. St. Louis City (3-7-10) is 12th in the 14-team Western Conference a year after becoming the first expansion team to win a conference regular-season title. The team lost to Kansas City in the first round of last year's playoffs. Technical director John Hackworth will manage the team on an interim basis. Carnell was hired as the team's first manager in January 2022 and received a contract extension before this season. \"Given Bradley's many contributions to the club, this was not an easy decision,\" St. Louis City Sporting Director Lutz Pfannenstiel said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, based on our Year 2 results to date, we believe a coaching change is in the best interest of the club as we regroup and look to improve both our performance and our results.\" St. Louis City faces San Jose on Wednesday night.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nLeague lifts bans on 3\n\nThe NHL lifted its ban on longtime coach Joel Quenneville and executives Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac on Monday, clearing the way for their return to the league more than two years after they were punished in the fallout from the Chicago Blackhawks sexual assault scandal. The three can sign contracts with an NHL team after July 10. The scandal rocked the Blackhawks in October 2021 and had ripple effects across the league. An independent investigation commissioned by the team concluded that officials mishandled allegations raised by Blackhawks player Kyle Beach during the team's Stanley Cup run in 2010. Quenneville, the former Chicago coach and second on the all-time wins list to Scotty Bowman, resigned from his job as coach of the Florida Panthers. The NHL fined the Blackhawks $2 million in the wake of the investigation, which was launched in response to two lawsuits filed against the franchise: one by a player identified as John Doe alleging sexual assault by then-video coach Brad Aldrich in 2010 and another filed by a former student whom Aldrich was convicted of assaulting in Michigan. The report found no evidence that CEO Danny Wirtz or his father, Rocky, who owns the team, were aware of the allegations before the lawsuits. But the younger Wirtz said it was clear team executives had \"put team performance above all else.\""
