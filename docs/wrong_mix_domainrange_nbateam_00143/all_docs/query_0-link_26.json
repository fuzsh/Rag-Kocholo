        "text": "Lakers trade Steve Blake to Warriors for MarShon Brooks, Kent Bazemore\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have their backup point guard.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers traded Steve Blake to the Warriors for guards MarShon Brooks and Kent Bazemore, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks.\n\nBlake, who turns 34 next week, has averaged 9.5 points and 7.6 assists in 27 games for the Lakers this season. He missed a month and a half with a torn elbow ligament but otherwise has provided steady leadership at point guard.\n\nThe Warriors have searched for a backup point guard since letting Jarrett Jack sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the offseason. They traded for the Boston Celtics' Jordan Crawford, but he has struggled off their bench after thriving as the Celtics' starter.\n\nBlake should be a good fit to play with and behind All-Star Stephen Curry while also adding another three-point shooter to the mix. The Warriors will be Blake's eighth team, though his 3Â½-year stint with the Lakers was his longest.\n\nThe Lakers made the trade to save money, as they will cut salary but also luxury tax payments."
