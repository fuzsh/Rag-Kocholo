The construction is expected to take about two years before welcoming its first students.\n\nManagement Development Program Presentation Participants of the County’s Management Development Program, in collaboration with the UGA Carl Vinson Institute, presented their community service projects.

It ensures that they are equipped to lead our community.”\n\nMyah Freeman, Corrections counselor and GED instructor with BCCI gave an overview of the community projects on behalf of the 19 employees who completed the program.

He said this is a great example of how giving our community is.\n\nMoving on to County business, County Manager Tom Couch asked the Commissioners to remove item number 3 in the new business regarding the land bank authority at the request of the County and City Attorney.

Approval of Revenue Bonds to be Issued by the Development Authority for the Benefit of the Statesboro STEAM Academy\n\nSteve Rushing, as attorney for the Development Authority, is requesting the Commissioners' approval of the issuance of the above-referenced revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed $13 million, the proceeds of which will be used to finance the costs of construction of a new school facility for the Statesboro STEAM Academy at the intersection of East Main Street and Veterans Memorial Boulevard. Federal tax law requires approval of the Chairman of the Bulloch County Board of Commissioners in order for the bonds to have tax-exempt status. The bonds will not be an obligation of Bulloch County, the City of Statesboro, the Development Authority, or the State of Georgia. Rather, the bonds will be paid solely from the school's revenue, which includes tuition and state education funds. In the packet is some information about the Statesboro STEAM Academy and the project. Approval of the attached resolution approving issuance of the bonds is recommended.\n\nSteve Rushing spoke on behalf of the Development Authority in favor of this project. This will fund the construction of the 35,000 square foot school building. An open air collaborative design in a modular type environment. STEAM stands for Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math. This is about a two year construction process before they will see students in the building.\n\nAPPROVED - 2. Approve a Joint Resolution with the City of Statesboro to Appoint John Robinson to a Four-Year Term on the Statesboro-Bulloch County Land Bank Authority\n\nIn 2002 the City of Statesboro and Bulloch County entered into an interlocal cooperation agreement to establish the Statesboro-Bulloch County Land Bank Authority pursuant to Title 48 of the Georgia Code. The primary purpose for a land bank authority is to rehabilitate tax delinquent and dilapidated properties, and it has been used exclusively by the City of Statesboro for that purpose. The only real reason the County is a party to the agreement is because the code requires an interlocal agreement between a county and a municipality in order to establish a land bank authority. In 2012, Title 48 was amended to allow the creation of new land bank authorities with expanded powers regarding property ownership and financing. However, the new law allows existing land bank authorities to exercise the new powers if a new board member is appointed in order to create an odd number of board members. The current Land Bank Authority board members are Linda Christy and Mildred Wilson as appointed by the County, and Deloris Groomes-Dickey and Michael Summers as appointed by the City. The City has requested approval of the attached joint resolution to appoint John Robinson as the fifth board member.\n\nDEFERRED - 3. Approve an Amendment to the Interlocal Cooperation Agreement for the Statesboro-Bulloch County Land Bank Authority\n\nThe City has requested approval of the amendment to the interlocal cooperation agreement for the Statesboro-Bulloch County Land Bank Authority to state that the Authority shall have all powers conferred to land bank authorities as contained in Article 4 of Title 48 of the Georgia Code as it currently reads and may be amended.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENTS\n\nDavid Reed spoke about an issue he brought before the Commissioner four years ago about an issue with the building code regarding dryer vents which requires them to be 12” above the ground. He believes PVC is not within codes as well. Nothing has been done about this. James Pope is trying to work out a solution, he said.\n\nMarcus Toole with Habitat for Humanity - “Thank you all for adding the other person to the Land Bank Authority. I can’t tell you how many times citizens have tried to donate a lot to Habitat for property that they can’t do anything with because it is heirs property. They can’t sell or give away or borrow money to improve the property. But they are stuck paying the taxes. This helps clear these log jams. They can take the property and clear the title to donate or sell. This helps bring the property back into the tax code. Most of this property has issues with the title. The land bank authority had been dormant, but the City has revitalized it and it has made a big difference already. Thank you for your support.”\n\nCOMMISSION AND STAFF COMMENTS\n\nRobert Seamons, Assistant Public Works Director, shared with the Commissioners that as of this morning they have put a new grapple truck in operation. The truck was ordered a year and half ago. This gives them three primary full sized grapple trucks operating along with one small truck. The first of the two roll off trucks they authorized to purchase has been delivered to public works and the second is to be delivered later today. He said that the public works department is currently 14 team members short, between maintenance, solid waste and the airport. They are working to fill positions. They have quite a few openings they are not receiving applications for.\n\nCommissioner Timmy Rushing thanked all of the members of the leadership class for their community service.\n\nGrice Connect has converted the agenda and all supporting documents to searchable documents.
