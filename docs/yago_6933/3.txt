For those who are living under the rock, Xander Berkeley who has just deserved a place in a pop-culture not because he appeared in TERMINATOR 2, killed by the T-1000, but because he revealed himself as Red John, is married to the actress Sarah Clarke. The couple wed on May 2002 and they met during the set of 24 Season 1.

Not just a coincidence, but both Xander and Sarah played the Nastiest Villains in the TV Show history transpire. Clarke played Nina Myers in 24 who was revealed to be the mole inside the CTU until the end of the first season. Same thing for her sweet hubby, Xander who has been releaved to be Red John.

Ironically, both 24 and Mentalist' showrunners did not get in the mind these two sweet people to play villains, until they picked them up during the season's run. Bruno Heller, The Mentalist's creator said that he did not get the idea of "who is gonna be Red John" before, but he picked up Xander Barkley just a year ago to be the prime candidate to portray RJK.

Oh, yes, one last thing. This is really an irony. Sarah Clarke played Nina who is known for having screwed up with the entire CTU, but also, because she killed Bauer's wife. Xander, on the other side, killed Jane's wife and daughter...too.

Irony, they really play nice villains these two :)
