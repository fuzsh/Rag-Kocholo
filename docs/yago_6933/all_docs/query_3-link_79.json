        "text": "Sarah Clarke’s art is finally imitating her life.\n\nThe actress, best known for playing the nefarious traitor Nina on Fox’s “24,” stars as Erin McGuire on TNT’s “Trust Me” (Tuesday night at 10).\n\n“It is so close to things going on in my life,” Clarke said in an interview from the show’s set in Los Angeles. “My character has a remodel of her house going on, and I’m going through a huge remodel. I’ve said, ‘You guys, I so know my way around fixtures right now.’ ”\n\nThe St. Louis native said playing an ad executive’s wife on “Trust Me” lets her live out the path not taken.\n\n“Having grown up in the Midwest with a suburban upbringing and knowing that I wanted to break out of that, it was an interesting idea to think, ‘What if I had never left? What if I had stayed? What would it be like?’ Advertising was always the exciting profession in the Midwest. And on top of it, (creators and executive producers) Hunt Baldwin and John Coveny have such a funny way of seeing the world, and to get to be in their mind-set and have their words to say, it’s just nothing but fun.”\n\nClarke and her husband, actor Xander Berkeley, have a 2-year-old daughter, and she draws on that experience to play a TV mom. Baldwin and Coveny also requested that she read the book “The Ten-Year Nap.”\n\n“It’s basically about women who had careers, put their careers on hold to raise children and now are re-entering the work force, trying to figure out what they want to do and who they are beyond mothers and wives. I love that idea, too. I think it’s a lot to play with.”\n\nWhen she first appeared on “24,” Clarke e-mailed her family and friends and wrote, “Watch and see if I can convince you I belong in the CIA.”\n\n“In ‘24,’ I had to convince people I could kill them at any second, so that’s a lot of contained power and contained energy, and I’m so small that it seemed unbelievable.”\n\nEven though she has been off “24” since 2004, Clarke said people still stop her to talk about Nina.\n\n“The fact that they gave Nina an emotional connection to Jack and have a betrayal so deep, I just struck the jackpot there. I think whenever you have someone close to you turn, that’s really unsettling, and that’s probably why she was so powerful.”"
