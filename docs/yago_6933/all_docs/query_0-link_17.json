That is a combined net worth with his wife of many years, fellow \"24\" actor, Sarah Clarke. They have been married since 2002.\n\nHe began his professional on-camera career in 1981 with a role on \"M*A*S*H\", and has since gone on to appear in a wide variety of film and television projects. Some of his work includes guest starring, supporting, and starring roles in such films and television shows as \"Hart to Hart\", \"Remington Steele\", \"Falcon Crest\", \"Wiseguy\", \"The X-Files\", \"Nash Bridges\", \"ER\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Law & Order\", \"The West Wing\", \"Bones\" and \"Nikita\".\n\nXander Berkeley is best known for portraying the character \"Gregory\" on the American television series \"The Walking Dead,\" the egotistical and cowardly leader of the Hilltop Colony who later finds himself dangling at the end of a rope, and the character of Sherriff Thomas McAllister on the American drama television series \"The Mentalist.\"\n\nEarly Years\n\nAlexander Harper Berkeley was born on December 16, 1955 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a painter and his mother was a school teacher. He was raised in New Jersey and, at the age of 16, joined a community theatre and an experimental theatre troupe. Xander Berkeley went on to attend Hampshire College, a private liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts. He continued performing in regional theaters and, later, in off-Broadway productions.

He went on to claim roles in hundreds of popular television shows and award-winning motion pictures.\n\nTelevision\n\nXander Berkeley made his first television appearances in 1981. That year, he played the role of a marine on the American war comedy drama \"MASH,\" which aired on CBS from 1972 to 1983, and portrayed the character of \"Medford\" on the ABC sitcom \"Open All Night,\" which aired from 1981 to 1982.\n\nXander Berkeley has since appeared on such television shows as \"The Incredible Hulk,\" \"The A-Team,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" and \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nFilm\n\nXander Berkeley made his motion picture debut in the 1981 American biographical drama \"Mommie Dearest,\" where he portrayed Joan Crawford's adopted son Christopher Crawford as an adult.

It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Television Series – Drama,\" and for a Writer's Guild of America Award for \"New Series.\" The American monthly magazine \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the character of \"Gregory\"- portrayed by Xander Berkeley in the television series – as number 24 in its list of the 30 best Walking Dead characters.\n\nThe Mentalist\n\nAn American drama television series that premiered on September 23, 2008 and ran for seven seasons, the show concerns a psychic who works as a consultant to the California Bureau of Investigation.

It's eventually revealed that \"Red John\" is actually Sheriff Thomas McAllister, portrayed by Xander Berkeley.
