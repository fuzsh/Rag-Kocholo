        "text": "Xander's IMDb\n\nXander is one of the most consistent and versatile actors in the business, which explains his 230 film and television credits. People know to pay attention and stay tuned when he comes on screen. If this chameleon has a trademark it would be honest gravitas and wry humor. Otherwise you are often hard-pressed to recognize he is the same person from one film to the next so complete is his transformation in support of the story.\n\nFrom early training in both classical and experimental theatre, and high-level skills as a make-up artist, he was brought out to LA from NY by an agent and soon landed his first film, the iconic Mommie Dearest as Christopher Crawford. Roles on shows like M.A.S.H. and The Incredible Hulk soon followed and then another film as Tom Hanks’ college roommate in Volunteers. But he credits his role as the drug dealer in Sid and Nancy as the turning point of his career leading to both a steady stream of art films and Box Office hits, often playing the antagonist (or husband) opposite Academy Award winning actors.\n\nMany remember him first as the foster father in Terminator 2, head of PR in Apollo 13, Captain Whitaker in A Few Good Men, and the turncoat Secret Service Man Agent Gibbs, who went down with the plane, in Air Force One, the evil Sheriff Nathan Van Cleef in Shanghai Noon and the King of Sodom in Harold Ramis’ Year One being just a few of his many memorable roles in Studio hits. And as for Indies, he did three other Films with Alex Cox and four with Mike Figgis as well as leads in Candyman, Safe, Gattaca, and the titular role in The Maestro.\n\nTV fans know him as George Mason (who also went down with the plane...) on Fox’s 24, Percy on Nikita for the CW, Magistrate Hale on WGN’s Salem, Red John on The Mentalist for CBS, and Gregory on The Walking Dead for AMC. Also starring as The Man in The Booth at the End for Hulu (now available on Amazon Prime).\n\nXander has won best actor awards in many different domestic and international film festivals and The Streamies, as well as the coveted Art Carney Award for lifetime excellence as a film character actor, a Lifetime Achievement in film from The Garden State Film Festival and a Screen Actor’s Guild Award for best ensemble cast.\n\nXander has four films coming out and one in production. Look for him to start directing soon in his new home state of Maine where he lives with his wife, actress Sarah Clarke, and their two daughters."
