        "text": "Sarah Clarke (born February 16, 1972) appears in Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as Renée Dwyer.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nClarke was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Carolyn, a homemaker, and Ernest Clarke, an engineer.\n\nClarke attended Indiana University, where she studied Fine Arts and Italian. While a student at IU, Clarke became a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She was initiated into the Beta chapter in 1990.\n\nClarke first became interested in acting while studying abroad during her senior year in Bologna, Italy. Upon returning to the United States, she began studying architectural photography. She received free acting lessons in return for taking photographs of a cultural arts center, and she studied acting at Circle in the Square Theatre School, Axis Theater Company, and The Willow Cabin Theatre Company.\n\nCareer[]\n\nClarke began her acting career with an appearance in a 1999 award-winning commercial for Volkswagen. She followed this with a role in the 2000 short film Pas de deux and received an Outstanding Performance award at the Brooklyn Film Festival. Clarke's career soon blossomed with minor roles, including films All About George in 2000 and The Accident in 2001, as well as television shows such as Ed and Sex and the City. In 2001, Clarke auditioned for the role of CTU agent Nina Myers on 24. She won the role on the day that filming began. The wardrobe department didn't have time to fit her, so she had to wear her own outfit for the entire season of filming. In her three seasons with the show, Clarke was featured in a total of 36 episodes. Clarke won a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama Series for this role. Clarke also lent her voice to 24: The Game, as her 24 character, Nina Myers.\n\nClarke guest starred in the episode of House entitled \"Control\" as a workaholic CEO with congestive heart failure, and in the episode of Life entitled \"A Civil War\" as Mary Ann Farmer, the owner of a gas station. Clarke also played Renée Dwyer in Twilight, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Stephenie Meyer. Currently, Sarah Clarke has taken a leading role on a brand new series on TNT entitled Trust Me, alongside Eric McCormack and Thomas Cavanagh. The series premiered on January 26, 2009 to positive reviews.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Clarke reprised her role as Renée Dwyer in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn - Part 1.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nClarke met her husband, Xander Berkeley, while on the set of 24 (he played her husband's supervisor, George Mason) and they were married in September 2002, a year after meeting. They have two daughters: Olwyn Harper (b. September 23, 2006) and Rowan (b. 2010). They eventually co-starred in the internet short-film The Booth At The End.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Film Role Notes Other Notes 2000 Pas de deux The Clown Film as Sarah Lively All about George Catherine Film as Sarah Lively Sex and the City Melinda Peters 1 episode as Sarah Lively 2001 24 Nina Myers 36 episodes 2001–2004 The Accident Reeny Film Ed Kara Parsons 1 episode as Sarah Lively 2002 Emmett's Mark Sarah Film aka Killing Emmett Young 2003 Thirteen Birdie Film The Third Date Katrina Film Karen Sisco Barbara Simmons 1 episode Uncredited 2004 Below the Belt Company Spokesperson Film aka Human Error 2005 Happy Endings Diane Film House Carly Forlano 1 episode Psychic Driving Selma Film E-Ring Jim's Wife 1 episode Unaired Pilot (date/year unknown) Las Vegas Olivia Duchey 2 episodes 2006 A House Divided Jackie TV - Film 24: The Game Nina Myers Video-game voice over Commander in Chief Christine Chambers 1 episode The Lather Effect Claire aka One More Night 2007 Alibi Sarah Winters TV - Film The Colony Olga Film Life Mary Ann Farmer 1 episode 2008 Twilight Renée Dwyer Film The Cleaner Lauren Keenan 1 episode Wainy Days Rebecca 1 episode 2009 Women in Trouble Maxine McPherson Film Trust me Erin McGuire 13 episodes Bedrooms Janet Film Level Seven Alex Film 2010 The Twilight Saga: Eclipse Renée Dwyer Film Below the Beltway Anne Film Men of a Certain Age Dori TV series 5 episodes 2011 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 Renée Dwyer Film\n\nAwards[]\n\nYear Award Category Result Role 2003 Satellite Awards Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Drama Won Nina Myers in 24 Screen Actors Guild Awards Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series Nominated 24 (shared)\n\n[]"
