        "text": "If you had the choice between Jon Hamm and Paul Rudd, who would you choose? If you are Sarah Clarke, apparently you choose neither.\n\nIn Vanity Fair's June issue, Rudd admitted that many years ago, he and the 43-year-old \"Mad Men\" star once fought for the affections of Sarah Clarke, better known as mole Nina Meyers from \"24\" and Bella Swan's mom in the \"Twilight\" saga.\n\nAccording to Sarah's brother Preston, who has been friends with Hamm since high school, Sarah met Rudd when he was Preston's roomate at the University of Kansas. Rudd proceeded to visit the siblings in their hometown of St. Louis, Mo.\n\n“I thought he was coming to visit me, but obviously he was coming to visit my sister,\" Preston told Vanity Fair. \"Hamm was there because he was always at my house. And Paul knew that Jon had taken Sarah to prom. He was slightly intimidated. And then we started playing Trivial Pursuit.”\n\nRudd confirmed to the magazine that he was indeed intimidated.\n\n“He seemed like he was a good-looking, athletic guy who possessed qualities I did not possess,\" the 45-year-old \"Anchorman 2\" star said of Hamm. \"We were playing Trivial Pursuit in teams. Sarah and I were on one team and Jon and Preston were on the other team. Jon would want to go right to Yellow, which was History, and I was like, ‘Oh, great, this guy is smart too.’ They would ask a question like ‘What is the largest lake in Africa?,’ and Jon immediately went, ‘Lake Victoria.’ I felt so emasculated in the game that, as a result, I started reading atlases.”\n\nDespite their rivalry over the actress, Sarah did not actually end up with either of them in the end. In 2001, she met actor Xander Berkeley on the set of \"24\" (He played her supervisor on the show.).\n\n\"It was like there was no possibility of escape for either of us – and no desire to either,\" her 58-year-old co-star told Hello! in 2004 of their relationship.\n\nThe duo wed a year later and subsequently had two daughters, Olwyn in 2006 and Rowan in 2010.\n\nDon't worry, though. Both Hamm and Rudd also ended up finding their perfect matches. Hamm has been in a relationship with actress Jennifer Westfeldt since 1997, while Rudd went on to have two children with film publicist Julie Yaeger, whom he wed in 2003."
