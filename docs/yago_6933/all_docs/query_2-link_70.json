        "text": "Artist Oliver Black (Xander Berkeley) wakes to discover his wife Evelyn (Sarah Clarke) has died in their bed overnight. Brimming with magical realism, we enter a world in which the misconceptions of our belief in a solid reality are revealed. Space and time bend in a way to challenge the audience with what is real, what is illusion, and what is beyondâ€¦\n\nThis peaceful and hypnotic quiet is interrupted by the outside world and the threat of everyday, common reality (thanks to Oliver's art dealer played by cult icon Mink Stole).\n\nALCHEMY OF THE SPIRIT explores the mysteries which transcend our physical universe and open a doorway into a different dimension, where ultimately, in the aftermath of death, there is an evolution of life which expands awareness, serenity and inner peace."
