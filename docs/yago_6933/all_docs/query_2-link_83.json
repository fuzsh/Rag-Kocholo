        "text": "Sarah Clarke, famous for her role as Nina Myers on 24, will appear in the second part of the second season of Nikita. Details on her character and in how many episodes she will appear are kept under wraps.\n\nPerhaps Sarah will have scenes with Xander Barkeley (Percy), who is actually her husband in real life â€” they met while they were shooting 24 (Xander Berkeley played George Mason). Aside from the first three seasons of 24, Sarah Clarke has since worked on the Twilight saga and appeared in 5 episodes of Men of a Certain Age.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't be surprised if her character is related to Lyndsy Fonseca's... anyway, as a 24 fan, I think it's a very nice addition to the cast !\n\nStreaming Options"
