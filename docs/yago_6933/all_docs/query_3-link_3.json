His roles include George Mason on the television series 24.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBerkeley was born in Brooklyn, New York, though he has lived most of his life in New Jersey. Berkeley went to Hampshire College and worked in the theaters at the five college system]which Hampshire was a part of, including Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst, and the University of Massachusetts. Berkeley worked in the Regional and Repertory Theaters in addition to while living in New York. Despite a classically trained theater background, he was increasingly drawn to the subtleties of film acting. A play written by Reynolds Price called Early Dark had such a cinematic feel to it, that an agent saw the acting potential in Berkeley and encouraged him to make the move out west.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nBerkeley is a painter and a sculptor, as well as a make-up artist. Berkeley met Sarah Clarke (she appeared in Nikita as Katya Udinov) on the set of 24 in 2001, and married her the following year. They have two daughters.\n\nBerkeley lives with his wife and 2 children in Los Angeles, California, where he works as a painter and sculptor when he is not acting.\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]"
