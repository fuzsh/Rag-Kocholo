        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Coming off two seasons on Nikita, Xander Berkeley is set to recur on the upcoming third season of SyFy’s Being Human. In an eight-episode stint, Berkeley will play Liam, the father of Brynn (Tracy Spiridakos) and Connor (Jon Cor) who is seeking answers for what happened to his children and also seeking to wipe out the vampires that remain. A brute with charisma and chilling elegance, he will be both enemy and father-like figure to Nora (Kristen Hager). For the past two seasons, Berkeley played villain Percy on the CW’s Nikita. The 24 alum, repped by Domain and Mosaic, will also appear in the feature Small Time, the directorial debut of 24 co-creator Joel Surnow, and will reprise his starring role in the second season of the Hulu Web series The Booth.\n\nFrank Grillo has been cast in the HBO/BBC original movie Mary And Martha. Produced by Working Title and directed by Phillip Noyce, Mary And Martha stars Hilary Swank and Brenda Blethyn as two women who emerge from traumatic family tragedy to forge a unique bond while fighting for the eradication of malaria. Grillo, repped by CAA and Management 360, will play Swank’s husband. He will next be seen in Stephen Frears’ Lay The Favorite, Intersection, and Kathryn Bigelow’s Osama bin Laden movie Zero Dark Thirty."
