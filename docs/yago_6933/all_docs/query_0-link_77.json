        "text": "LOS ANGELES - In the Feb. 25 episode of Fox’s espionage drama 24 – in which the entire season takes place over the course of one 24-hour day – Counter Terrorist Unit director George Mason (Xander Berkeley) finally admitted that his radiation sickness, the result of a massive exposure in the morning, was impeding his ability to do his job. He then handed over control of the Los Angeles operation to CTU operative Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard).\n\nMeanwhile, Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) continues to attempt to save the city from a terrorist bomb set to explode in minutes or hours.\n\nWhether or not Mason makes another appearance on 24 before his inevitable demise remains a closely guarded secret, but however it turns out, the show has given Mr. Berkeley much more than just a paycheck.\n\nDuring filming of the pilot for season one last year, Mr. Berkeley met actress Sarah Clarke, who played Nina Myers, the CTU agent who turned out to be a traitor. Last September, the two were married.\n\nFor Mr. Berkeley, who is more than a decade older than Ms. Clarke, taking this plunge is somewhat similar to the fear of signing on to a TV commitment. “I don’t want to stretch the metaphor,” he says, “but I guess I was afraid of being trapped in the wrong situation.”\n\n“I’ll just answer the marriage thing directly. I hadn’t reached a point where I was ready to meet my match, until I did. There may have been some apprehension about commitment, but there isn’t anymore. Upon meeting Sarah, there was a sense of certainty that I’d always felt missing before.”\n\n“In terms of doing TV, so many people get into the business going, ‘How can I get famous?’ I always thought, “My God, be careful, what happens if you do?’ There’s no turning back on that one. I never wanted a divorce, and I never wanted to run away from the wrong character.”\n\nSprung from prison, Nina returned for a few episodes at the beginning of the season, as Bauer grilled her for help locating the Middle Eastern terrorists holding the bomb.\n\nAirs at 9 p.m. Tuesday on Fox.\n\n‘24’"
