Appeared with husband Xander Berkeley on 24: Twenty Four (2001) during the first two seasons, although they rarely shared a scene. They got married little less than two months before the premiere of season two.

In one of her guest appearances on 24: Twenty Four (2001), Clarke's character, Nina's (fake) passport picture is brought up on a screen during a CTU meeting, and the name next to the picture reads "Sarah Berkeley", Clarke's married name. The information shown on the passport, however, is not Clarke's real information (birthdate, etc).

Both she and her husband, actor Xander Berkeley, have played turncoat government agents who help terrorists attempt to kill the President of the United States: Clarke on the TV series 24: Twenty Four (2001) and Berkeley in the movie Air Force One (1997).

A native of St. Louis, Missouri, she began acting in the theatre while working as an architectural photographer. In her first short film, Pas de deux (2000), she won an Outstanding Performance award at the Brooklyn Film Festival.
