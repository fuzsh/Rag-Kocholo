        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations specialized agency for health, was created on 7 April 1948 as “directing and coordinating authority of international health work.” The WHO consists of its 194 member states and a secretariat with 8000 staff working in its headquarters in Geneva, 6 regional offices, and 150 country offices mostly providing technical assistance to low- and middle-income countries. With its issued norms and standards, the WHO affects all aspects of health, including food, air, water, noise, chemicals, and many other fields the life of every human being as well as the laws and economies of each country. This chapter provides the historical background of WHO, its visionary constitution defining health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, the WHO’s successes such as the eradication of smallpox and its failures, the political challenges WHO has to navigate as well as WHO’s engagement with multiple other organizations and modes of financing. In 2020, the need for a strong WHO has never been more pronounced as evidenced by the global COVID-19 pandemic."
