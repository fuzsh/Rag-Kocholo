        "text": "As G7 Heads meet this week in Hiroshima, over 250 figures from 50 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific have endorsed a joint statement released by the Asia-Pacific Leadership Network (APLN) and the European Leadership Network (ELN). Former prime ministers, defence ministers, foreign ministers, senior military figures, diplomats and others warn that nuclear arms control must not be allowed to fall victim to geopolitical competition and issue a call for action.\n\nThe following statement calls on Russia and the United States to pursue a successor framework to the nuclear arms reduction treaty, New START, before its expiration in 2026, and for all states to reaffirm commitments not to test nuclear weapons and make concerted efforts toward the entry-into-force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nThe statement is issued in the names of the signatories and not on behalf of the APLN and ELN organisations or their respective network memberships as a whole. The full statement is available in English, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French and Spanish.\n\n*****\n\nGroup Statement: Protecting Nuclear Arms Control Is a Global Imperative\n\nThe world badly needs more nuclear arms control, not less.\n\nAs security policy leaders from 50 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific, we call on the leaders of Russia, the United States, China, France, and the United Kingdom to ensure that nuclear arms control will not be made yet another victim of geopolitical competition.\n\nThese five leaders, in January last year, declared the reduction of strategic risks and the avoidance of war between nuclear-weapon states to be their foremost responsibilities and that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought. In November 2022, G20 leaders (including the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, and India) collectively agreed that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.\n\nYet United States-Russia strategic stability talks are in limbo and the New START treaty, which has played an indispensable role in ensuring reciprocal security, is now in question. As the only existing nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, the world’s two largest nuclear-armed countries, the treaty’s collapse or expiration without a replacement would threaten a destabilising arms race.\n\nFailure to agree on a new nuclear arms control framework to replace New START before it expires in February 2026 would also make it more difficult to bring China, France and the United Kingdom into multilateral arms control, as all three are not ready to consider limits on their nuclear arsenals until the United States and Russia bring down their nuclear stockpiles.\n\nWorsening great power competition has made it even more difficult to advance nuclear arms control and risk reduction more generally – for example, within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Failure to uphold obligations under that treaty weakens our national and collective security and fails the test of statesmanship.\n\nWe have many different views on the rights and wrongs of current geopolitical competition. But we all agree that it is long past time to start prioritising nuclear arms control and taking unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral actions.\n\nWe call on the P5 nuclear weapons states to take steps to begin strategic stability talks at a variety of levels and to resume strategic risk reduction talks in the P5 format.\n\nWe call on Russia and the United States to compartmentalise nuclear arms control by:\n\nConfirming that they will not exceed the New START limits on deployed nuclear forces, which thus far have not been violated.\n\nAgreeing to remove the obstacles to full implementation of their New START obligations and resuming the work of the Bilateral Consultative Commission.\n\nCommitting to pursuing good faith negotiations on a successor framework for New START before its expiration in 2026.\n\nWe call on all signatory and other holdout states of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to reaffirm their commitments not to test nuclear weapons and also to make concerted efforts towards entry into force of the Treaty.\n\nSigned,\n\nNPT nuclear-weapon states\n\nChina\n\nProf. Chen Dongxiao, President, Shanghai Institute for International Studies (SIIS) (APLN)\n\nProf. Cui Liru, Senior Advisor to the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (APLN)\n\nDr. Hu Yumin, Senior Research Fellow, Grandview Institute (APLN)\n\nMr. Ren Libo, Chief Executive Officer, Grandview Institution\n\nProf. Shen Dingli, Professor and former executive dean at Fudan University’s Institute of International Studies and former Director of the Center for American Studies (APLN)\n\nDr. Tong Zhao, visiting research scholar at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University and Senior Fellow at the Nuclear Policy Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, China (APLN)\n\nProf. Yu Tiejun, Professor of International relations, Peking University\n\nFrance\n\nBenoit d’Aboville, former French PermRep at NATO and Associate researcher at FRS, Paris (ELN)\n\nDr Isabelle Facon, Deputy Director, Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, FRS\n\nDr Juliette Faure, Research and Teaching Fellow, Université Paris II Panthéon-Assas (YGLN) (ELN)\n\nDr Marc Finaud, Associate Fellow, Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP), Vice President, Initiatives pour le désarmement nucléaire (IDN)\n\nBenjamin Hautecouverture, Senior research fellow, Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, FRS\n\nProf. Francois Heisbourg, Senior Advisor for Europe at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and Special Advisor at Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique (ELN)\n\nPierre Lellouche, former Minister for Foreign Trade (ELN)\n\nGeneral (ret) d’armée aérienne Bernard Norlain, Président Initiatives pour le Désarmement Nucléaire-IDN (ELN)\n\nRussia\n\nDr Alexey Arbatov, Head of the Center for International Security at the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations (ELN)\n\nProf. Vladimir Baranovsky, Academic Director of the Centre for situation analysis at the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO)\n\nDr Alexey Gromyko, Director, Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ELN)\n\nNikita Gryazin, Younger Generation Leaders Network Coordinator (YGLN) (ELN)\n\nDr Evgenia Issraelyan, Leading Researcher at the Arbatov Institute for US and Canada Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, (ISKRAN)\n\nDr Victor Mizin,leading Researcher at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences\n\nPavel Palazhchenko, Head of International and Media Relations, The Gorbachev Foundation\n\nDr Sergey Rogov, Academic Director of the Institute for the US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Science (ISKRAN) (ELN)\n\nDr Pavel Sharikov, Institute of Europe, Russian Academy of Sciences (YGLN) (ELN)\n\nDr Nikolai Sokov, Senior Fellow, Vienna Center for Disarmament and Nonproliferation\n\nDr Nadezhda Shvedova, Doctor of Political Sciences, Professor, Chief Researcher of the Institute for the United States and Canada Academician G.A.
