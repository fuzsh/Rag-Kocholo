        "text": "Across the weekend of 16-18 February 2024, the 60th Munich Security Conference takes place. With a host of foreign and security policy leaders, politicians, government officials, and heads of state in attendance, we are pleased to share a range of ELN activities taking place within the conference framework, on its fringes, and for the public and Network alike.\n\nOn Friday 16th, our weekend begins with the now-regular membersâ€™ lunch. ELN members invited to the conference, or simply in town, are invited to join us for a private gathering to network and discuss ELN programmes and impact and to feed into future work.\n\nFollowing the opening sessions of the Conference, you can join the ELN at the Cafe Luitpold from 1700-1930 CET as YGLN Programme Manager and Senior Policy Fellow Julia Berghofer hosts a talk on her late 2023 debut book, The New Cold War: Nuclear Weapons, Cyberattacks, Hybrid Dangers (German). Together with Leo Simon of the Youth Atlantic Treaty Association (YATA), Julia will discuss key themes from her book: how serious is the nuclear threat? Are we facing a new arms race? And how should Europe brace itself against global aggressors in the future? Click here to register!\n\nOn Saturday evening, 17th Feb, from 1730-1900 CET, the ELN hosts an official side event with The Elders entitled Risky Propositions: Why it matters to have leaders who champion nuclear arms control. For this event, US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins, joins ELN Chairman and former British Defence Secretary Lord Des Browne, former Prime Minister of Norway and Director General of the World Health Organisation Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland and Younger Generation Leaders Network member and NTI Senior Program Officer Patricia Jaworek to debate the need to separate existential risks, with a primary focus on nuclear arms control, from great power competition. The event will be open to attendees of the MSC and members of the public, but registration is required. Click here to join us.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least, join ELN senior network member and serving Bulgarian Minister of Defence Todor Tagarev in conversation with Julia Berghofer from 20:00, Saturday 17 Feb, continuing in the Cafe Luitpold for an open session reflecting on debates in the MSC and the Balkans."
