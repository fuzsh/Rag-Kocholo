        "text": "* Professor emeritus at Paris-VII university.\n\n(1) These representatives include Colombia’s German Velasquez, one of the WHO’s leading experts on essential drugs and is a noted defender of the rights of sick people in poor countries. He was assaulted on 26 May 2001 in Rio de Janeiro and two days later in Miami. His attackers referred to his criticisms of the pharmaceutical companies’ patent policies.\n\n(2) Compulsory licensing is provided for in Article 31 of the WHO’s agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (Trips). Governments facing health emergencies are authorised to issue operating licences relating to patents without obtaining the permission of the patent-holders. See Philippe Demenet, “The high cost of living”, Le Monde diplomatique English edition, February 2002\n\n(3) See Libération, 5 March 2001.\n\n(4) “Why Invest in Health”, Dr Brundtland’s speech to the Third International Conference on Priorities in Health Care held in Amsterdam, 23 November 2000.\n\n(5) Le Monde, 27 April 2002. See also Philippe Rivière, “Patently wrong”, Le Monde diplomatique English edition, July 2001.\n\n(6) The Global Fund was designed as a partnership between governments, private organisations, civil society and international institutions. Its executive council includes seven representatives from donor countries, seven from developing countries, two from the private sector and two from NGOs. The private-sector organisations are the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Anglo-American PLC (a global leader in the mining and natural resources sectors). UNAIDS, the WHO and the World Bank have non-voting representatives. As the manager of the funds raised, the World Bank has an important responsibility.\n\n(7) See the WHO website, Thomas Zeltner et al., “Tobacco Industry Strategies to Undermine Tobacco Control Activities at the World Health Organisation”, a report by the Expert Committee on tobacco industry documents, Geneva, July 2000.\n\n(8) Ralph Nader, letter dated 23 July 2001.\n\n(9) Letter from Daphne A Fresle to Dr Brundtland, 23 December 2001, Geneva. Ms Fresle worked in the WHO’s Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines Policy.\n\n(10) See World Health Report 2000, “Health Systems: Improving Performance”, Geneva, 2001. The report contains a listing of the healthcare systems in the various member-states, and ranks them in terms of efficiency. The report’s statistical methodology and the absence of reliable data have met with harsh criticism. See Cella Almeida et al, “Methodological Concerns and Recommendations on Policy Consequences of the World Health Report 2000”, The Lancet, Vol 357, London, 26 May 2001.\n\n(11) The WHO’s audit with respect to reorganisation has not yet been made public.\n\n(12) Richard Horton, “WHO: the casualties and compromises of renewal”, The Lancet, Vol 359, Issue 9317, London, 26 May 2001.\n\n(13) The WHO’s relations with the private sector also involve the rich nations. The WHO sets a wide variety of international standards governing such things as nitrate levels in drinking water; sulphur levels in the atmosphere; dioxin levels near garbage incinerators; the power capacity of cell phones; and healthcare for the mentally ill."
