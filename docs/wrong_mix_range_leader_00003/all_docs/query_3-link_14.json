On April 9, 1940, German troops invaded the country and quickly occupied Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Narvik. The Norwegian government rejected the German ultimatum regarding immediate capitulation. The Norwegian Army, which received help from an Allied expeditionary force, was unable to resist the superior German troops, however. After three weeks the war was abandoned in southern Norway. The Norwegian and Allied forces succeeded in recapturing Narvik but withdrew again on June 7, when the Allied troops were needed in France. The same day, King Haakon VII, Crown Prince",

        "text": "Political and social change\n\nAfter the liberation in 1945 a coalition government was formed under the leadership of Einar Gerhardsen. The general election in the autumn of 1945 gave the DNA a decisive majority, and a purely Labour government was formed with Gerhardsen as prime minister. The DNA governed almost continuously from 1945 to 1965. Haakon VII died in 1957 and was succeeded by his son, Olaf V. The Labour governments continued the social policies initiated in the 1930s. From 1957 old-age pensions were made universal, and in 1967 a compulsory earnings-related national supplementary pension plan came into effect. The old “poor law” was replaced by a law on national welfare assistance in 1964. The election of 1965 resulted in a clear majority for the four centre and right-wing parties, which formed a coalition government under the leadership of Per Borten. In 1971 the coalition government split, and the DNA again came to power, headed by Trygve Bratteli.\n\nAs a consequence of the referendum on the European Economic Community (EEC), the Labour government resigned and was followed by a non-Socialist coalition government under the leadership of Lars Korvald. The DNA returned to power in 1973 with Bratteli again as prime minister. When he resigned as leader of the party and prime minister in 1976, he was succeeded by Odvar Nordli. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway’s first woman prime minister, took over the government and party leadership from Nordli in February 1981. Her government was defeated at the polls in September of that year, and a Conservative, Kåre Willoch, became prime minister. Brundtland returned as prime minister in May 1986 but was again defeated three years later. The Conservatives formed a three-party coalition government under Jan Peder Syse but resigned after one year over the issue of Norway’s future relationship with the EEC. Brundtland again formed a minority Labour government and continued to head it until her resignation in October 1996.\n\nA year later the Labour government fell and was replaced by a centre-coalition minority government, with Kjell Magne Bondevik of the Christian People’s Party as prime minister. (King Olaf V died in 1991 and was succeeded by his son, who ascended the throne as Harald V.) Bondevik remained in office until 2000, when his government was replaced by a minority government led by Jens Stoltenberg of the Labour Party, whose brief tenure ended in 2001 with the return of Bondevik at the head of another conservative coalition. In 2005 the so-called Red-Green coalition led by Stoltenberg triumphed in the general election, and he again assumed the position of prime minister, this time at the head of a majority government, which was returned to power in elections in 2009.\n\nOn July 22, 2011, a pair of terror attacks stunned Norway. At 3:26 pm local time, a bomb exploded in central Oslo, seriously damaging government buildings and killing at least seven people. Hours later, a gunman disguised as a police officer opened fire on a Labour Party youth camp on the island of Utøya, roughly 25 miles (40 km) from Oslo. The gunman, armed with an automatic weapon and a pistol, killed more than 65 people during an hour-long attack. Police apprehended a suspect in the shooting and stated that the two attacks were linked. The next year the entire country followed the trial of the accused killer on television and grieved with the survivors and families of the victims of the attack. In the end the defendant was convicted and received a 21-year sentence, the maximum allowable under Norwegian law, though that sentence could be extended should it be determined that he remained a threat to society.\n\nSince the 1970s a central issue in Norwegian politics has been the exploitation of the rich natural gas and petroleum deposits in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. As the Norwegian petroleum industry grew in importance, the country became increasingly affected by fluctuations in the world petroleum market, but in the late 20th and early 21st centuries oil revenues played the dominant role in fueling a prosperous Norwegian economy and providing Norwegians with one of the world’s highest per capita incomes. The government, prudently preparing for a time when petroleum profits might not be so lucrative, began reinvesting those profits in the Government Pension Fund (originally the Government Petroleum Fund). Even as much of the rest of the world struggled in the wake of the international financial crisis that began in 2008, Norway continued to prosper, with its economy continuing to grow steadily and unemployment remaining low at about 3 percent.\n\nBy 2013 the Government Pension Fund had swelled to some $750 billion, yet, despite the continued economic prosperity under Stoltenberg, the Norwegian electorate seemed restive as it rejected his government in parliamentary elections in September 2013. Although Labour captured the largest number of seats for any single party (55), the centre-right bloc led by the Conservative Party took 96 seats, and Conservative leader Erna Solberg became the first prime minister from her party since 1990. She headed a minority coalition government with the Progress Party, whose anti-immigration stance had mitigated against attracting a third party to the coalition, preventing it from forming a majority government, .\n\nAlthough the Liberals and the Christian Democrats chose not to join the new government, they agreed to support it in return for a promise that amnesty would be granted to some asylum-seeking immigrant families and for guarantees that oil drilling would be banned during the next four years in the vulnerable fishing areas in the Lofoten-Vesterålen island groups. The Solberg government responded to the increasing influx of migrants seeking asylum (especially from the Syrian Civil War) in 2015 with a combination of providing shelter and assistance, offering monetary compensation for repatriation, and pursuing stricter immigration policies.\n\nAs declining world oil and gas prices began to hinder the growth of Norway’s economy (Norwegian oil giant Statoil reported its first quarterly loss since 2001 in the third quarter of 2014), Norwegian politicians and businesspeople began planning for a future with diminished petroleum output and revenues.. Solberg tackled these economic challenges by cutting taxes, investing in infrastructure, and borrowing from the Government Pension Fund Global. By the time parliamentary elections rolled around in 2017, the economy had gradually rebounded, and the Norwegian electorate rewarded Solberg by making her the first leader of a centre-right government in Norway in more than three decades to win consecutive terms. In the September polling, Labour (led by former foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre) continued to hold the largest number of seats in the Storting, but the Conservatives and their coalition partners, which now included the Liberals, maintained their narrow plurality and formed another minority government.\n\nIn January 2019 the Christian Democrats were persuaded to join the ruling coalition, and for the first time Solberg found herself at the head of a majority government; however, that majority was short-lived because the Progress Party withdrew from the coalition in early 2020 as a result of a dispute over the government allowing the repatriation from Syria of the Norwegian Pakistani widow of a Norwegian terrorist and her two young children. At roughly the same time, the global coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread to Norway, which took a much more stringent approach to the potentially deadly health crisis than did neighbouring Sweden, imposing a prolonged lockdown on much of the economy and most institutions as well as introducing social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Moreover, by October 2021 more than 70 percent of Norwegians had been vaccinated. As a result, Norway had one of Europe’s lowest rates of deaths related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nThe release in August 2021 of a United Nations report on the irreversible impact of global warming had a profound effect on the campaigns for the parliamentary elections scheduled for the next month. Norwegian society was already deeply conflicted over the dominant role fossil fuels played in the Norwegian economy. On one hand, Norway’s considerable economic prosperity was a result of its status as western Europe’s largest oil producer, but, on the other hand, most Norwegians were committed to combating climate change, and the country had taken aggressive steps to limit carbon emissions and to adopt renewable energy sources. On the heels of a summer in which wildfires and extreme weather (likely a consequence of climate change) menaced parts of Europe, many of the smaller political parties in the Norwegian elections advocated the country’s determined shift away from oil and gas exploration. Indeed, the Green Party called for the termination of oil and gas production by 2035. While acknowledging the need to reassess the long-range future role of fossil fuels in the Norwegian economy, the main parties generally supported continued oil exploration and production."
