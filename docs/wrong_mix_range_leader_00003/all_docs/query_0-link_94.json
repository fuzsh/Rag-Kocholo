We join a growing number of international leaders in raising the alarm over new nuclear dangers.\n\nLast month we witnessed the end of the landmark US-Russia Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Today, there are grave doubts over the future of the only remaining agreement that limits and regulates Washington and Moscow’s strategic nuclear weapons, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). And new challenges confront the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nStability is eroding and risks are rising. North Korea has grown its nuclear weapon stockpile, tests missiles, and continues to feel threatened. The fate of inter-Korean and US-DPRK dialogue remains uncertain. Tensions are flaring between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan. And, following Washington’s unilateral breach and resumed sanctions, Iran may walk away from the nuclear deal that constrains its ability to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nMoreover, new military technologies threaten to destabilise global and regional nuclear confrontations. These technologies are rapidly evolving and entirely uncontrolled.\n\nThe risks of nuclear accident, misjudgement or miscalculation have not been higher since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Complacency should not be an option. It is not only European security at stake.\n\nSimply coercing an adversary will not restore stability. Politically unrealistic appeals for transformed behaviour will not build trust. An accelerating arms race makes both trust and safer behaviours harder to achieve.\n\nIt is possible to negotiate with adversaries without condoning unacceptable behaviour. Leaders must relearn the skills of past decades in finding ways to reduce shared nuclear risks in the absence of wider trust.\n\nFor their national and common interests, we urge leaders at the United Nations General Assembly to launch a new, shared project to reduce nuclear risks. This is all the more urgent as we approach the May 2020 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which for 50 years has served as the foundation of the world’s nuclear regime.\n\nWe recommend that:\n\nRussian and US governments should comply with existing commitments, maintain existing tools, and develop new approaches to deal with a more complex future. This includes the continuation of the INF Treaty’s core objectives (mutual nuclear restraint in Europe and no deployment of intermediate range delivery systems), implementation and extension of New START (with provisions for transparency), and intensification of existing talks on strategic stability to reduce the risks of miscommunication and miscalculation.\n\nMoscow and Washington acknowledge their special responsibilities as the states with the largest nuclear arsenals and, through their resumed strategic stability talks, consider new constraints on nuclear competition and measures to preserve nuclear stability.\n\nUS-Russia talks should focus on the classes and postures of nuclear weapons and delivery systems – strategic and non-strategic, deployed and non-deployed – and of technologies with potential strategic nuclear effect that are particularly dangerous or destabilising.\n\nGovernments across the Euro-Atlantic region, home to over 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons and four nuclear weapon states, should step up engagement and develop concrete proposals to reduce nuclear risks. The deteriorating relationship between Russia and the West and breakdown of nuclear arms control fundamentally affects European security.\n\nChina and other nuclear weapons states should promote work on strategic stability. Multilateral efforts should be made to find effective mechanisms to engage nuclear-armed states not party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nWorld leaders should accept that:\n\nnuclear stability will become so entwined with new technologies that states must collaborate if nuclear risks are to be reduced. The potential for disruption by non-state actors is unacceptably high;\n\nrising complexity is neither a justification for discarding arms control arrangements nor an excuse for inaction in agreeing new measures;\n\nthe return to great power competition makes multilateral engagement on nuclear stability, transparency, and predictability more essential.\n\nOnly through cooperation on existential common interests can we build trust and stability. These shared interests demand a renewed commitment to collective nuclear diplomacy. Euro-Atlantic and global security depends on it.\n\nENDS\n\nSigned by members of the European Leadership Network’s senior network:\n\nAlbania\n\nMr Fatmir Mediu, former Albanian Defence Minister\n\nAustria\n\nMr Alexander Kmentt, former Permanent Representative of Austria to the Political and Security Committee of the European Union\n\nDr Wolfgang Petritsch, former EU Special Envoy for Kosovo & Former High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBelarus\n\nAmbassador Vladimir Senko, former Foreign Minister\n\nBulgaria\n\nDr Solomon Passy, former Foreign Minister, former Chairman of the OSCE and UN Security Council\n\nProfessor Todor Tagarev, former Minister of Defence, Head, Centre for Security and Defence Management, Institute of ICT, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences\n\nCroatia\n\nAmbassador Budimir Loncar, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of former Yugoslavia; former Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to the Non-Aligned Movement\n\nProfessor Ivo Šlaus, Nuclear physicist and Honorary President, World Academy of Art and Science\n\nCzech Republic\n\nJan Kavan, former President of the UN General Assembly, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister\n\nDenmark\n\nMr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, former Minister for Foreign Affairs\n\nE Mr Mogens Lykketoft, former Foreign Minister; former President of the UN General Assembly\n\nFinland\n\nDr Tarja Cronberg, former Member of the European Parliament, former Chair of the European Parliament Iran delegation, former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Subcommittee of Security and Defence\n\nAmbassador Jaakko Iloniem, former Ambassador to the United States, former Ambassador to the CSCE\n\nAmbassador Jaakko Laajava, former Under-Secretary of State and former Ambassador to the United States and Ambassador to the United Kingdom\n\nAdmiral Juhani Kaskeala, former Chief of Defence\n\nDr Elisabeth Rehn, former Minister of Defence\n\nProfessor Raimo Väyrynen, former President of the Academy of Finland; Former Director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs\n\nFrance\n\nAdmiral (ret.)
