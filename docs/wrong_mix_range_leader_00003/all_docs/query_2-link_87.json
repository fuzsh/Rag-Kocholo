In 2011, she served the first Senior Expert on Gender and Inclusion on the UNâs Mediation Standby Team. She has also served on the Advisory Board of the UN Democracy Fund (UNDEF), and was appointed to the Civil Society Advisory Group (CSAG) on Resolution 1325, chaired by Mary Robinson in 2010.

This movement reached its peak during the 80’s and 90’s. Mr. Ashafa went on to become the Secretary General of the National Council of Muslim Youth Organizations, an organization promoting hostility against Christians.\n\nDuring a confrontation between Christians and Muslims in Zongon Kataf, Mr. AshafaÂ lost two cousins, as well as his spiritual mentor, while they were fighting against the Secretary General of the Kaduna State chapter for the Youth Christian Association of Nigeria, Pastor James Wuye.\n\nAfter a mutual friend brought them together, the two men slowly built mutual respect, and decided to work together to bridge the divide between their communities. In 1995, Mr. Ashafa and Mr. Wuye formed the award-winning Interfaith Mediation Centre, a religious grassroots organization that, with over 10,000 members, reaches into the militias and trains the countryâs youth, women and leaders to become civic peace activists. The center provides interfaith training to young people in schools and universities, to women, religious leaders and politicians. It has contributed to defusing tensions after the 2002 and 2004 clashes in Kaduna and Yelwa Shendam.\n\nMr. Ashafa and Mr. Wuye mediated in Kenya, after the disputed election in 2007-2008, and they have fostered trust-building in Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Sierra Leone, Australia, Malaysia, Sweden, Canada and inside a British prison.\n\nÂ\n\nGro Harlem Brundtland\n\nDr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norwayâs first woman Prime Minister, was born in Olso\n\nDr. Brundtland inherited another passion from her father – political activism.

It was not until 1978 however, that Native Americans were legally permitted in the United States to practice their faith traditions. Even after the US adopted the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, challenges continued to exist regarding access to sacred sites and the freedom to pray in traditional ways. As a spiritual leader, Nacâa has brought international awareness to the large gap between government policies and their implementation.\n\nHis primary responsibilities however have always remained with the People as he conducts ceremonies for families and for the People during pilgrimage horse journeys over hundreds of miles at a time, bringing together the prayers and intentions while traveling hundreds of miles at a time on horseback.\n\nIn 1996 through spiritual guidance, Nacâa Looking Horse sponsored a spiritual horseback ride from Canada to Wyoming where he led the first “World Peace and Prayer Day” (WPPD), bringing awareness to the protection of the Bear Lodge Sacred Site as Nacâa spoke out against the damaging recreational climbing and the mistranslated, derogatory name (Devils Tower) given to the site.Â He has been a consistent voice in the United States in a shared effort alongside traditional wisdom keepers to return the respectful name honored by Indigenous Peoples.\n\nDuring the past two decades, theÂ June 21st ceremony has traveled around the globe as people gatherÂ to pray in their own Religion/Faith Tradition. Nacâa seeks to have the United Nations recognizeÂ June 21stÂ as âHonoring Sacred Sites DayâÂ and pass theÂ Universal Code for Holy SitesÂ with the inclusion of Indigenous sacred sites in addition to religious man-made structures. He believes that through united prayers and efforts we can heal an ailing planet, and he has therefore committed his life journey to this effort.\n\nMonica McWilliams\n\nMonica McWilliams was a co-founder and leader of the Northern Ireland Womenâs Coalition political party and was elected to a seat at the Multi-Party Peace Negotiations, which led to the Belfast (Good Friday) Peace Agreement in 1998.\n\nShe served as a member of the Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly from 1998 to 2003 and the Northern Ireland Forum for Dialogue and Understanding from 1996-1998.

Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (“Church Committee”).\n\nIn 1976 Carter, the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate. Carter and Mondale’s time in office was marred by a worsening economy and, although both were renominated by the Democratic Party, they lost the 1980 election to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for president while promoting a nuclear freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment, an increase in taxes, and a reduction of U.S.Â public debt.

Mr. Rawal served as a consultant to documentary filmmakers and then branched out as a filmmaker himself with âOcean Monk,â which took the Best Short Doc Prize at the 2010 St. Louis Film Festival, and âChallenging Impossibility,â which premiered at Tribeca in 2011.\n\nNow, Mr. Rawal is speaking to an even larger audience with a feature-length documentary called âFood Chains.â The film, which premiered at the latest Berlinale, describes the challenges that farm workers endure despite years of work by leaders such as Cesar Chavez.\n\nââFood Chainsâ reveals the human cost in our food supply and the complicity of large buyers of produce like fast food and supermarkets,â said a spokesperson.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the film, âWhile fascination and concern about what we eat is at an all-time high, there is little reliable information on how our food actually gets to the family table â¦ The plight of migrant farm workers remains a nagging social justice and human rights issue.â\n\nIn his work in development strategy, Mr. Rawal has assisted in the launch and management of a number of high-profile celebrity philanthropic endeavors both domestically and abroad.

Nine years later, she finished her MBA at Berkeley as a Fulbright Scholar, and she also graduated from the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. In the meantime she had studied art and design, and finished the exams from high school privately. She promised herself that if she ever had children, she would provide inspiration rather than boredom for them. This is how she became engaged in the establishment of the first Montessori School in Norway in 1990.\n\nHer experience taught her several truths: (1) children and youth have unlimited energy, potential and inspiration â it is the responsibility of adults to help unleash it; and (2) the entrepreneurial spirit of youth has no boundaries. If we build boundaries for them, the spirit will be lost, and in some cases be used negatively. If we give them the right tools to be entrepreneurs, we will see a world of change makers.\n\nAs a business woman, Ms. Stange has never been satisfied with âbottom lineâ thinking. When she left traditional business to prioritize social impact in the mid-80s, this was seen as stepping aside. Today, this is mainstream among young leaders and entrepreneurs worldwide. Business leaders and professionals all over the world are joining the movement led by unique individuals like Jeff Skoll, Bill Drayton, Jacqueline Novogratz, Bill Gates and Richard Branson.\n\nInspired by organisations such as Skoll Foundation, Ashoka and Acumen Fund, Ms. Stange established philanthropy advisory services at Formuesforvaltning in Norway in 2007, with the purpose of offering pro bono advisory services to interested clients. âThe move from traditional grant-giving charity to more impact oriented funding â whether as grants or as investments â has grown stronger over the past decade. The social responsibility of business has also become evident to most business leadersâ, Ingrid says.\n\nIn 2010, Ingrid began working with the Norwegian Opera and Ballet to co-organize the first Partnership for Change conference. In 2012, she founded the Partnership for Change foundation, which promotes a vision of a more equitable, a more secure, and a more sustainable global society.\n\nTuija Talvitie\n\nTuija TalvitieÂ has been the Executive Director of Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) since November 2009, where she leads the execution of CMIâs mission and the implementation of CMIâs strategy.

During the 1980s and 1990s he was involved in militant Christian activities. For eight years, he served as Secretary General of the Kaduna State chapter of the Youth Christian Association of Nigeria, an umbrella organization for all Christian groups in Nigeria.\n\nHis hatred for Muslims was without limits. He hated seeing people being intimidated and abused, so when Muslims were blamed for inciting a violent conflict in Kaduna, he immediately volunteered to lead a reprisal attack. He lost his right arm during one of the battles against Imam Muhammad Ashafaâs militant group, increasing his vengeance and deep hatred for Muslims in general and Mr. Ashafa in particular.\n\nAfter a mutual friend brought them together, the two men slowly built mutual respect, and decided to work together to bridge the divide between their communities. In 1995, Mr. Ashafa and Mr. Wuye formed the award-winning Interfaith Mediation Centre, a religious grassroots organization that, with over 10,000 members, reaches into the militias and trains the countryâs youth, women and leaders to become civic peace activists.
