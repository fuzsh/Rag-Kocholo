        "text": "The Op-eds and Speeches center provides full texts of speeches and of published opinions written by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, and Carter Center experts.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nOpinion: Celebrating Universal Human Rights Is More Important Than Ever\n\nOp-ed by Karin Ryan, published by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is celebrating its 75th anniversary since its establishment in 1948. We are witnessing a low point of the modern human rights movement. Karin Ryan writes that it is time to take stock and renew our commitment to universal values.\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nOpinion: A Pivotal Moment for Gaza and Global Diplomacy\n\nOp-ed by Carol Daniel Kasbari, senior associate director of the Carter Center's Conflict Resolution Program, published by The Hill\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from the U.S. to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in the wake of the tragic killing of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen on April 1 and the harrowing toll of the war, which has already claimed over 30,000 Palestinian lives and more than 1,160 Israeli lives.\n\nJan. 19, 2024\n\nOpinion: Paige Alexander and Kristin Lord: 2024 Is the Year of Elections. Let's Act Now to Protect Them.\n\nOp-ed by CEO Paige Alexander, published by The Chicago Tribune\n\nAs we look ahead this year, voters in more than 50 countries, including the United States, will go to the polls. The elections will take place during a period of global democratic backsliding and in rapidly changing social media environments characterized by new threats from generative artificial intelligence and tech platforms’ reductions in trust and safety protections. The challenges to election integrity and public confidence are daunting and require all levels of society — individuals, communities and institutions — to act.\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nOpinion: Women, Youth Hold Key to Peace in Sudan\n\nOp-ed by CEO Paige Alexander, published by Newsweek\n\nA deadly competition between two rival generals in Sudan has derailed anticipated prospects for a transition to civilian rule. As always, it is the Sudanese people who are paying the price, with hundreds of civilians killed or wounded, and more than a million people internally displaced or crossing as refugees into neighboring countries.\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nOpinion: Why We Can’t Forget the Nakba\n\nEssay by Carol Daniel Kasbari, senior associate director of the Carter Center's Conflict Resolution Program For Palestinians, the Nakba (Catastrophe) is a somber occasion that represents the loss of their homeland and the forced displacement that followed. As a nation, they mourn the tragic events that unfolded, which saw them violently uprooted from their ancestral homes to make way for a Jewish-majority state, as envisioned by the Zionist movement. لماذا لا يمكننا نسيان النكبة\n\nSept. 22, 2022\n\nOpinion: Americans Are Fed Up, Candidates. Clean Up Your Act\n\nOp-ed by Paige Alexander and Gleaves Whitney, published by CNN.com\n\nMany politicians these days seem to think they have to play dirty to win, that truth is optional and that they don't have to accept the results if they lose. We have news for them: American voters are fed up with scorched-earth campaigning and want their leaders to act like adults. They want candidates to follow the rules of decency and civility. They want national healing and reconciliation.\n\nAug. 31, 2022\n\nOpinion: Sudan Needs Attention and Action Now\n\nOp-ed by John Goodman and Guma Kunda Komey in Devex.\n\nSudan’s democratic fate is in the balance. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are in the street, risking their lives for peaceful change. Yet the world is not paying attention.\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\nReform the Electoral Count Act\n\nOp-ed by Jimmy Carter and James A. Baker III, published by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWe stand on opposite sides of the partisan divide, but we believe it is better to search for solutions together than to remain divided. This is particularly true of a vexing problem that could wreak havoc during the 2024 presidential election: the inadequacy of the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\n\nMay 16, 2022\n\nThis Is How We Finish off Guinea Worm\n\nOp-ed by World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Carter Center Chair Board of Trustees Jason Carter in the Guardian/print edition special supplement\n\nIn the past 200 years, humankind has made incredible progress against many threats to health: vaccines, medicines and other innovations have saved millions of lives from feared killers, from malaria to cancer. But only one human disease – smallpox – has ever been eradicated. Less noticed by the rest of the world, we stand on the threshold of consigning another disease to the history books: Guinea worm.\n\nMarch 22, 2022\n\nPaige Alexander: China Can Play a Vital Role to End War in Ukraine Op-ed by Paige Alexander published on FT.com/Chinese Edition. The route to peace in Ukraine may travel through China. Because of its unique relationship with Russia, China now has more influence than any other country to convince Moscow to seek peace. Beijing should not be reluctant to use this clout.\n\nJan. 5, 2022\n\nJimmy Carter: I Fear for Our Democracy\n\nOp-ed by Jimmy Carter in The New York Times.\n\nOne year ago, a violent mob, guided by unscrupulous politicians, stormed the Capitol and almost succeeded in preventing the democratic transfer of power. All four of us former presidents condemned their actions and affirmed the legitimacy of the 2020 election. There followed a brief hope that the insurrection would shock the nation into addressing the toxic polarization that threatens our democracy.\n\nOct. 29, 2021\n\nSenior Advisor to The Carter Center, Jennie K. Lincoln: \"Nicaraguan Democracy is Dead\"\n\nOp-ed by Jennie K. Lincoln in La Prensa.\n\nThe fraud is already done and human rights are on the ground,\" said Lincoln, who years ago was an electoral observer in Nicaragua. The principal adviser of the Carter Center on peace initiatives in Latin America and the Caribbean, Jennie K. Lincoln, said this Friday that in Nicaragua there are no conditions for credible elections.\n\nSept. 21, 2021An Opportunity to Energize Multinational Diplomacy on Syria\n\nOp-ed by George A. Lopez and Hrair Balian in Responsible Statecraft.\n\nAs the world has focused on Afghanistan for the past month, a historic compromise agreement reached in July at the United Nations Security Council between the United States and Russia has received little attention.\n\nJune 25, 2021\n\nIt’s Time for a Reality Check in Mali\n\nOp-ed by Bisa Williams and John J. Goodman in Al Jazeera.\n\nAs the United Nations Security Council prepares to vote later this month on whether to extend the UN peacekeeping mission there, it is time for a reality check about the effectiveness of current international support for the country’s peace process.\n\nJan. 20, 2021\n\nThe United States Needs a New Syria Policy\n\nالولايات المتحدة بحاجة إلى سياسة جديدة بشأن سوريا\n\nOp-ed by Jeffrey Feltman and Hrair Balian in Responsible Statecraft.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will inherit a 10-year-old crisis in Syria that continues to pose acute strategic and humanitarian challenges. The new administration has an opportunity to re-evaluate U.S. policy on Syria, prioritizing diplomacy to advance our interests.\n\nDec. 12, 2020\n\nOpinion: Code of Conduct Can Help in Divisive Senate Runoff\n\nOp-ed by Paige Alexander published in the Atlanta-Journal Constitution\n\nThe Carter Center is no stranger to polarized elections. Over the last three decades, we’ve observed more than 110 elections in 39 countries, many of them deeply divided. Now we’re faced with a high-stakes election in our own backyard.\n\nOct. 28, 2020\n\nJason Carter and Cindy McCain on Trust in America’s Election System\n\nOp-ed by Jason Carter and Cindy McCain published by The Economist.\n\nVoters in this year’s election in Guyana had to wait five months to get the final results. The South American country’s troubles may sound familiar to Americans: allegations of voter suppression and intimidation, fraudulent ballots, ballot boxes going missing or being destroyed, attempts to thwart the count and fears that the party in power would not accept the results if it lost.\n\nOct. 7, 2020\n\nIt's Time For Congress To Regulate Political Advertising On Social Media\n\nOp-ed by Michael Baldassaro and David Carroll published by The Hill Washington.\n\nFacebook recently announced that because of concerns about its inability to counter misinformation, it was placing a moratorium on new political advertisements in the week before Election Day. This move was reminiscent of one from Twitter last year that banned all political advertising for similar reasons.\n\nAug. 28, 2020\n\nAmerica's Elections Are At Risk. Here's What The Carter Center Is Doing About It\n\nOp-ed by Jason Carter and David Carroll, published by CNN.com.\n\nFrom Ecuador to Egypt, Ghana to Guyana, The Carter Center has been supporting democratic elections around the world since 1989 to ensure they are free, fair and transparent. This year, for the first time in our history, we will be turning our attention to the US, where we plan to launch a campaign to strengthen transparency and trust in the election process.\n\nAug. 6, 2020\n\nPreventing a Modern Cold War\n\nRemarks by Paige Alexander at the CPAFFC virtual meeting.\n\nOn Aug. 6, the Carter Center’s China Program partnered with the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries to host a webinar titled, “What is the Next Chapter in U.S.-China Relations?” Read Carter Center CEO Paige Alexander's keynote address to the gathering.\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\nCrisis Shows Importance of Mental Health, Caregiving\n\nOp-ed by Eve Byrd and Jennifer Olsen published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nDuring the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, mental health has become a common discussion topic among the public, media, and health providers. Will the crisis help \"normalize\" the way mental health and caregiving are viewed and help reduce the stigma typically surrounding these topics?\n\nSept. 24, 2019\n\nJimmy Carter: President Trump, act now to give democracy a chance in Sudan\n\nOp-ed by Jimmy Carter published by CNN.\n\nThe Sudanese people's overthrow of their former government opened new opportunities in the country for democracy, peace and economic development. Today, Sudan's transition is at a fragile moment. To succeed, it needs urgent international support.\n\nSept. 20, 2019\n\nWhat Keeps Us From Eradicating This Deadly, Contagious Disease?\n\nOp-ed by Mary Ann Peters published by CNN.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health recently announced that new treatments appear to sharply increase the survival rate for people who have contracted Ebola. The tests were conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an outbreak of this highly contagious disease has already cost 2,000 lives.\n\nMay 30, 2019\n\nWe Are at the Beginning of a Global Mental Health Revolution\n\nOp-ed by Rosalynn Carter and Bill Jallah published by CNN.com.\n\nAccess to mental health services has never been more critical -- no matter where you live. Mental health disorders are increasing globally, and depression is the leading cause of disability in the world. One in four of us will experience a mental illness at some point in our lives, according to the World Health Organization. And many more are indirectly affected by disorders experienced by someone we love.\n\nDec. 31, 2018\n\nJimmy Carter: How to Repair the U.S.-China Relationship — and Prevent a Modern Cold War\n\nOp-ed by Jimmy Carter published by The Washington Post.\n\nForty years ago, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and I normalized diplomatic relations between the People’s Republic of China and the United States, putting an end to three decades of hostility. The anniversary of this relationship is a testament to the ability of countries with different histories, cultures and political systems to work together for the greater good. Yet, today, this critical relationship is in jeopardy.\n\nSept. 28, 2018\n\nWe Must Treat Mental and Bodily Health the Same. It’s a Matter of Human Rights.\n\nRosalynn Carter, Patrick J. Kennedy op-ed, published by The Washington Post. Almost 10 years have passed since Congress required that insurers offering mental-health services for illnesses of the brain, such as depression or addiction, do so no more restrictively than illnesses of the body, such as diabetes or cancer. And yet most insurers today still do not comply with the law.\n\nAug. 24, 2018\n\nIn Syria, an Ugly Peace Is Better Than More War\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nAt their summit in Helsinki, Finland, in July, President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia reportedly agreed to end the Syrian war and to move Iranian forces away from the Syria-Israel border. President Trump has also indicated that he is willing to accept President Bashar al-Assad’s remaining in office and is prepared to withdraw American forces from Syria. This is a start. But more is needed to end the violence in Syria.\n\nMay 19, 2018\n\nLiberty University Commencement Address\n\nSpeech by Jimmy Carter.\n\nTo Dr. Hawkins, who is retiring now as provost of this great university, and to Secretary Carson, who is here, whom I have admired for a long time, to President Falwell and all of his family, to the students who are graduating, to the parents who have supported them, and to all the rest of you: This is a wonderful crowd. Jerry told me before we came here that it’s even bigger — I hate to say this — than it was last year. I don’t know if President Trump will admit that or not, but to me it means a lot.\n\nFeb. 14, 2018\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter on U.S.-China Relations\n\nJimmy Carter, Transcript of Guest Lecture, Emory University.\n\nIn Feburary 2018, President Carter spoke to Emory students as a guest lecturer on factors that led to his decision to normalize U.S. relations with China in 1979. He also spoke about a dinner conversation with President Deng Xiaoping that likely led to a surge of Christianity in China, now one of the world's leading producers of Bibles.\n\nNov. 8, 2017\n\nPresident Carter: Lack of Universal Healthcare Should Be a 'National Scandal'\n\nJimmy Carter and Gro Harlem Brundtland op-ed, published by Time.\n\n\"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" are the inalienable rights at the heart of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. The text is as dear today to the hearts of the American people as it was when Thomas Jefferson first penned his words nearly two and a half centuries ago.\n\nOct. 20, 2017\n\nOpinion: Caregiving Support’s Come a Long Way\n\nRosalynn Carter op-ed, published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThirty years is a long time in the history of caregiving as an issue in our country. The world was a very different place then. We used push-button phones, not cell phones, and had big word processors, not personal computers. There were social clubs, not social media, and people took care of each other because of a sense of familial responsibility. You didn’t hear much about “caregivers,” not because they didn’t exist but because what they were doing was quite common, and it was expected.\n\nOct. 4, 2017\n\nJimmy Carter: What I’ve Learned from North Korea’s Leaders\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nAs the world knows, we face the strong possibility of another Korean war, with potentially devastating consequences to the Korean Peninsula, Japan, our outlying territories in the Pacific and perhaps the mainland of the United States. This is the most serious existing threat to world peace, and it is imperative that Pyongyang and Washington find some way to ease the escalating tension and reach a lasting, peaceful agreement.\n\nSept. 12, 2017\n\nJimmy Carter: Voters Need a Digital Defense\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nTechnology threatens to fundamentally change the nature of elections and democratic governance.\n\nApril 21, 2017\n\nSecuring America’s Legacy in the Fight Against Neglected Tropical Diseases\n\nAmbassador (ret.) Mary Ann Peters op-ed, published by The Hill.\n\nGlobal progress against malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases often makes headlines across our nation and around the world. And it should. Yet news rarely captures one of the biggest global health successes to date: our country’s efforts to eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).\n\nApril 11, 2017\n\nA Sound Mind is a Sound Investment: Rosalynn Carter and Chirlane McCray\n\nRosalynn Carter and Chirlane McCray op-ed, published by USA Today.\n\nThe first thing every American needs to understand about mental illness and substance use conditions is that with timely diagnosis and proper treatment, the overwhelming majority of people can recover and lead fulfilling lives. The second thing everyone should know is that we all have a stake in making sure that everyone has access to high-quality, affordable health care.\n\nDec. 8, 2016\n\nU.S. Must Stand for Human Rights by Jimmy Carter\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe only title higher and more powerful than that of president is the title of citizen. We Americans are in the midst of a political transition that is reassuring in its constitutional orderliness even as it is fraught with uncertainty about what comes next. Just as each new U.S. president does, we, as citizens, should use this moment to remember the values that have defined us as a great nation.\n\nNov. 28, 2016\n\nWe Must Finish Fight Against Diseases We've Overlooked for Too Long\n\nMary Ann Peters and Sue Desmond-Hellmann op-ed, published by CNN.com.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Jude is his playful spirit and insatiable curiosity. An inquisitive and talented 13-year-old boy in Nigeria, Jude loves going to school, practicing drums and playing soccer with his friends. He dreams of growing up to serve his community and nation.\n\nNov. 28, 2016\n\nJimmy Carter: America Must Recognize Palestine\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nWe do not yet know the policy of the next administration toward Israel and Palestine, but we do know the policy of this administration. It has been President Obama’s aim to support a negotiated end to the conflict based on two states, living side by side in peace.\n\nNov. 10, 2016\n\nRelieving Human Suffering through Partnership and Perseverance\n\nRemarks by Jimmy Carter at the Meeting of the Coalition for Operational Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nGood morning everybody. Good morning everybody! Just want to make sure you’re awake. I know that Pat didn’t put you to sleep. I’m going to repeat Pat’s speech a little bit and am going to use notes.\n\nNov. 3, 2016\n\nOur Election System Isn’t Perfect, But Accusations Of ‘Rigging’ Are Baseless\n\nDavid Carroll op-ed, published by The Huffington Post.\n\nThe first election The Carter Center ever observed was rigged.\n\nSept. 20, 2016\n\nJimmy Carter: A First Step for Syria? Stop the Killing\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times\n\nThe announcement this month of a new cease-fire agreement in Syria is good news. But a lack of trust among the Syrian belligerents and their foreign supporters means this agreement, like the one that came before it, is vulnerable to collapse. بالعربية\n\nJuly 14, 2016\n\nRosalynn Carter to State: Stop Segregating Children with Disabilities\n\nRosalynn Carter op-ed, published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe state of Georgia needs to stop denying thousands of its schoolchildren their civil rights.\n\nJune 21, 2016\n\nA Time for Peace\n\nJimmy Carter, speech at the Center's 2016 Human Rights Defenders Forum.\n\nI was on a battleship in the Atlantic Ocean in 1945 when the world’s powers got together and formed the United Nations with a clear and express purpose of preventing war in the future. The United Nations was dedicated to peace. A few years later the same global powers assembled and concluded a commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nMay 31, 2016\n\nJimmy Carter Op-ed: To Curb Prostitution, Punish Those Who Buy Sex Rather Than Those Who Sell It Jimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nIt is disturbing that some human rights and public health organizations are advocating the full legalization of the sex trade, including its most abusive aspects. I agree with Amnesty International, UNAIDS and other groups that say that those who sell sex acts should not be arrested or prosecuted, but I cannot support proposals to decriminalize buyers and pimps.\n\nApril 25, 2016\n\nThe Prospects for Peace or War in Syria\n\nSpeech by Hrair Balian at the World Affairs Council\n\nAfter five years of civil war, is peace in Syria possible? The Carter Center has been working behind the scenes with key players in the conflict and in Syria's civil society to help pave the way for peace. Balian talks about the situation on the ground and at the negotiating table, about the challenges of reaching peace, and about what others can do to help.\n\nApril 18, 2016\n\nNordic Model Key to Beating Exploitation\n\nMary Ann Peters op-ed, published on CNN.com\n\nWith a decisive 64-12 vote in parliament this month, France asserted its determination to put an end to the exploitation of women and girls through prostitution. The United States and the rest of the world should follow suit. France's new law follows the Nordic Model, which recognizes prostitution as a form of violence, makes the purchase of sex acts illegal, regards prostituted persons as victims rather than criminals, and provides victims with help to get out of the business.\n\nApril 1, 2016\n\nJoint Quest for Global Peace Can Keep Bilateral Relations on Course\n\nJordan Ryan op-ed, published by The Global Times\n\nIn these difficult and dangerous times, it's important for the United States and China to work collaboratively on shared global challenges. One area ripe for more U.S.-China collaboration is Africa, where common interests of development, trade, anti-piracy, and counter-terrorism overlap more than they compete.\n\nMarch 17, 2016\n\nJimmy Carter Op-ed: President Obama Can Still Advance Israeli/Palestinian Peace Jimmy Carter op-ed, published by USA Today Online.\n\nSince the time of President Harry Truman, the United States has assisted Israel, including persistent efforts to forge peace agreements with her neighbors. Our government has also vetoed more than thirty U.N. Security Council resolutions that were critical of Israel, including many that were supported unanimously by all other Security Council members, and for several decades our support has included massive economic and military aid, amounting to about $8 million per day.\n\nMarch 8, 2016\n\nInternational Women's Day: Reflecting on Progress Made and Challenges Still Unmet\n\nRosalynn Carter Q&A, published by The Huffington Post.\n\nIn Honor of International Women's Day, former first lady Rosalynn Carter answered a series of questions about her experiences in the movement for women's rights.\n\nFeb. 3, 2016\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter – Lord Speaker's Global Lecture Series (PDF)\n\nJimmy Carter speech, House of Lords, London, UK.\n\nThank you. Well, I want to thank first of all Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza. I want to thank the members of the House of Commons who are here, the members of the House of Lords and also guests and my personal friends who have joined the audience. I'm very grateful for this invitation to come and speak to you this afternoon. As a matter of fact, this proves that there are at least some times when having been president can be an advantage. Thank you for that.\n\nJan. 14, 2016\n\nAcceptance Remarks of Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter Upon Being Presented the Order of Manuel Amador Guerrero in the Grade of the Grand Cross by the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez\n\nJimmy Carter, The Carter Center, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nI do not think it is necessary for me to say that I am overwhelmed in many ways — with the official reception of this very high award from the government and the people of Panama, but also with the flood of memories that this event brings forward in my heart and mind. This is a glorious day for me, which I will never forget, and I am exceptionally gratified to see so many distinguished Panamanians come for this ceremony.\n\nOct. 23, 2015\n\nJimmy Carter: A Five-Nation Plan to End the Syrian Crisis\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nI HAVE known Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, since he was a college student in London, and have spent many hours negotiating with him since he has been in office. This has often been at the request of the United States government during those many times when our ambassadors have been withdrawn from Damascus because of diplomatic disputes.\n\nSept. 22, 2015\n\nObama and Xi Must Do More Than Agree to Disagree Jimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Huffington Post.\n\nI have been fascinated with China since my first visit to Qingdao in 1949, just a short time before the Peoples' Republic was founded on October 1, my 25th birthday. I was governor of Georgia when President Nixon made his historic visit to China in 1972, and was disappointed when no additional moves were made to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries.\n\nSept. 16, 2015\n\nGender Equality in Politics Still Far Away\n\nMary Ann Peters and Mark P. Lagon op-ed, published by The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThis year, for the first time in history, women in every country will have the right to vote; Saudi Arabia ended its status as the final holdout by granting women the right to campaign for office and vote in municipal elections later this year. But it is still critical for the United States and others who work to build democracy around the world to focus on advancing women's political participation.\n\nAug. 20, 2015\n\nTranscript of Press Conference About President Carter's Cancer Diagnosis\n\nJimmy Carter, The Carter Center, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWell, thank you all for coming this morning. I first want to give my special thanks to my wife, Rosalynn, who's busy talking right now, and to all the folks at The Carter Center, my Emory doctors, and literally hundreds of well-wishers who have called in or sent me letters or emails—and I've tried to answer as many of them as I could.\n\nAug. 19, 2015\n\nWhy \"no-fly zones\" or \"IS-free zones\" are not a solution in Syria\n\nHrair Balian op-ed, published by NOREF.\n\nThere is a renewed push to establish \"no-fly\" and \"IS-free\" zones in Syria. An external military intervention to establish such zones, even with the good intention of protecting civilians, is likely to precipitate more chaotic fighting and further harm civilians.\n\nMay 29, 2015\n\nJimmy Carter: Why I Believe the Mistreatment of Women is the Number One Human Rights Abuse\n\nTranscript of Talk by Jimmy Carter for TEDWomen.\n\nThinking about my career since I left the White House, I'm reminded of a cartoon I saw in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up at his father and says, \"Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president.\"\n\nMay 14, 2015\n\nWe Can End the Illegal Sex Trade\n\nJimmy Carter and Swanee Hunt op-ed, published by Politico\n\nToo often, when we think of sex trafficking in America, we imagine women smuggled here from Asia or Latin America, when in fact we should be picturing everyday girls and women from our own neighborhoods, exploited by pimps and brothel owners in our own cities and towns.\n\nMarch 27, 2015\n\nRebuild Gaza, and Avert the Next War Jimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly seven months after the end of the latest war in Gaza, none of the underlying causes of the conflict have been addressed. In the meantime, the people of Gaza are experiencing unprecedented levels of deprivation, and the prospect for renewed armed conflict is very real.\n\nMarch 14, 2015\n\nSyria's Civil War Sees No End in Sight Hrair Balian op-ed, published by Al Jazeera America.\n\nAs the fourth anniversary of the conflict in Syria approaches, there appears no end in sight. Horrendous violations of international law continue unabated. Syrians have allowed themselves to be used as proxies by self-interested foreign countries. The war has taken sectarian and criminal dimensions, drowning the reform agenda that spurred the popular anti-government protests in 2011.\n\nFeb. 19, 2015\n\nSupport the Peacemakers Too\n\nMary Ann Peters op-ed, published by Huffington Post.\n\nPresident Obama has asked the Congress to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to counter the threat from the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The threat posed by this group is obvious and force will be necessary to halt and reverse their territorial gains.\n\nFeb. 6, 2015\n\nDon't Politicize Vaccinations Rosalynn Carter op-ed, published by Huffington Post.\n\nFor more than four decades, I have joined with many others working to ensure the timely vaccination of children, and today I am saddened to see an outbreak of measles infecting more than 100 people in 14 states, many of them vulnerable infants.\n\nDec. 26, 2014\n\nCuba, North Korea, and Getting Sanctions Right\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post\n\nAs we contemplate how to strike back at North Korea because it is believed to be behind the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer network, the foremost proposal is tightening sanctions. In my visits to targeted countries, I have seen how this strategy can be cruel to innocent people who know nothing about international disputes and are already suffering under dictatorial leaders.\n\nOct. 1, 2014\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at The Carter Center Celebration for His 90th Birthday\n\nJimmy Carter, The Carter Center, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nMy major trepidation is over — I didn't have any idea what Rosie was going to say. I think I came away fairly unscathed, and I'm grateful to you, sweetheart.\n\nOct. 1, 2014\n\nRosalynn Carter's Remarks at The Carter Center's 90th Birthday Celebration for Former President Jimmy Carter\n\nRosalynn Carter, The Carter Center, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nI have already seen the butterfly garden, and I'd like to thank everybody who made that possible. And the movie, and I'm sentimental already. I have known Jimmy Carter for most of my life — I think for all of my life except when I was very small. He likes to say that he was my next-door neighbor when I was born, and he looked through the bars on the cradle and saw me. I didn't recognize him then.\n\nMay 12, 2014\n\nUnited Palestinian Government May Provide New Opportunities for Peace\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post\n\nA united Palestinian government with wider international recognition, newly elected leaders and assured financial support from the Arab world may provide an opportunity for a new round of peace talks, permitting Israel finally to live in peace with its neighbors.\n\nMarch 13, 2014\n\nCan Venezuela Back Down from the Cliff?\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed, published by AlJazeera.com.\n\nIncreased polarization makes it imperative for Venezuela to take steps to find its way back from the brink.\n\nMarch 5, 2014\n\nThe \"Street Strategy\" Deepening Venezuela's Troubles\n\nJennifer McCoy and Michael McCarthy op-ed, published by The National Interest.\n\nOn this first anniversary of Hugo Chávez's death and in the wake of the sudden collapse of the Ukrainian government, predictions are swirling that Venezuela's Maduro government could be toppled either by an aggressive protest movement, or by an internal coup within the chavista movement.\n\nFeb. 14, 2014\n\nThe Arab Spring is Not Over\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by Al Jazeera America\n\nThere have been dramatic political upheavals in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, and the Carter Center — the nonprofit foundation I head that seeks to promote human rights, democracy and alleviation of suffering worldwide — has been invited to witness the transition process from authoritarianism to democracy in all of them. We still see citizens struggling to improve their lives and shape their own destiny, with sharply different prospects.\n\nJan. 16, 2014\n\nThe World's Youngest Country and a Very Old Disease: South Sudan Proves Guinea Worm Can Be Defeated With Return To Peace\n\nDonald R. Hopkins op-ed, published by The Huffington Post.\n\nIn the 1970s, a decade of peace opened up between civil wars in Sudan, allowing health workers to reach and immunize at-risk communities for smallpox. Without this window of peace, historians argue, smallpox might not have been conquered there. Recent outbreaks of violence (Dec. 15, 2013) in the new country of South Sudan have led some to speculate whether eradication efforts will succeed for another primeval plague -- the Bible's \"fiery serpent,\" known today as Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis).\n\nJan. 9, 2014\n\nThe Sudan Conflict and Disease\n\nDonald R. Hopkins letter to the editor, as published by The New York Times.\n\n\"U.S. Is Facing Hard Choices in South Sudan\" (front page, Jan. 4) reports that the conflict there \"has left the Obama administration scrambling to prevent the unraveling of a major American achievement in Africa.\" The conflict also jeopardizes an important South Sudanese achievement, which aims to eliminate Guinea worm disease from the young country by the end of this year, with significant benefits to health, agricultural productivity and school attendance.\n\nJan. 7, 2014\n\nMadagascar Offers Lessons for Troubled States\n\nJohn Stremlau, Cassam Uteem, and Dennis Kadima op-ed; published by Business Day Edition.\n\nMadagascar's December 20 elections are a victory for multilateral diplomacy led by the Southern Africa Development Community (Sadc) backed by political and economic sanctions imposed by democracies, including France, the US, the African Union and the United Nations, with the endorsement of China.\n\nDec. 27, 2013\n\nHow Canada Can Revise Its Prostitution Laws\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by the Ottawa Citizen.\n\nThe decision by the Supreme Court of Canada to strike down the existing basic laws governing prostitution is a step in the right direction. France is also struggling with the same issue, and is considering the adoption of the only workable solution that has been devised. New legislation has been passed by the French assembly to emulate Sweden, and a final decision by the senate is expected in June 2014.\n\nDec. 22, 2013\n\nTime to be Bold and Make Peace in Syria\n\nJimmy Carter and Robert A. Pastor op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nOn Nov. 26, the U.N. secretary general made another call for a Geneva peace conference on Syria, to be held Jan. 22. These calls have been issued since June 2011, but no belligerents have shown up because each has been allowed to define the preconditions for negotiations. The only way to break this stalemate is for the United Nations and major powers to set the conditions for participation and enforce them.\n\nDec. 12, 2013\n\nFulton Must Avoid Mental Health Cuts\n\nRosalynn Carter op-ed, published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe Fulton County Commission must avoid the proposed cuts to Grady Memorial Hospital's mental health services. The loss of the Grady programs these monies fund will be devastating. Emergency rooms at area hospitals will overflow with mental health patients in crisis. With an already inadequate capacity, the regional hospital will have to turn away more citizens in need. The jail population likely will increase as it becomes practically the only alternative for shelter and care. The county may cut the Grady contract, only to end up paying for more expensive psychiatric services at other hospitals.\n\nNov. 11, 2013\n\nWhat Can the U.S. and China Do Together?\n\nSpeech by Jimmy Carter at the U.S.-China Relations Forum in Atlanta, Ga.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 1978, Deng Xiaoping and I announced simultaneously in Beijing and Washington that we were going to normalize diplomatic relations the first day of 1979, and just three days later, on Dec. 18, Deng Xiaoping announced reform and opening up for the people in his own country at the 3rd Plenum of the 11th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nOct. 12, 2013\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter's Remarks at the National Symposium on the Modern Death Penalty\n\nPRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: Thank you all. My overwhelming feeling right now is one of both gratitude and welcome to you. We are delighted to have you at The Carter Center. You remember that you were here 13 years ago. The Carter Center has now been here about 32 years since I left the White House. We stay quite busy here, and I have a good life as a former president. As a matter of fact, I told a group yesterday morning, that one of my favorite cartoons in New Yorker magazine is this little boy looking up at his father and he says, \"Daddy when I grow up, I want to be a former President.\" Well, there are a lot of benefits from that.\n\nSept. 11, 2013\n\nThe World Now Has a Chance to End War in Syria\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nThe only way to be assured that Syrian chemical weapons will not be used in the future is not through a military strike but through a successful international effort.\n\nAug. 28, 2013\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter's Remarks at the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream Speech\"\n\nPRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: Well, I'm greatly honored to be here. And I realize that most people know that it's highly unlikely that any of us three (including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. President Barack Obama) over on my right would have served in the White House or be on this platform had it not been for Martin Luther King Jr. and his movement and his crusade for civil rights. So we are grateful to him for our being here.\n\nJuly 15, 2013\n\nLatin America's Experiences Offer Lessons for Postcoup Egypt (PDF)\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed, published by World Politics Review.\n\nLatin America holds lessons for understanding — and pointing the way through — the current upheaval in Egypt. As Egypt enters a new phase of polarization following the military intervention in the wake of massive protests against its elected leader, recent Latin American experience points to the risks of moving forward without addressing the roots of this polarization.\n\nApril 25, 2013\n\nThe Roots of Venezuela's Recount\n\nJennifer McCoy and Michael McCarthy op-ed, published by The National Interest.\n\nAfter fourteen years of Hugo Chávez's personalist leadership, Venezuelans took their first steps into a brave new world of political contestation on April 14 when they elected a president to fulfill Chávez's term. The fireworks that marked the aggressive campaign are, in a sense, still going off.\n\nApril 8, 2013\n\nEditor's Choice: Addressing Stigma Through Social Inclusion\n\nRosalynn Carter op-ed, published in the May 2013 edition of the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nCo-authors: David Satcher, and Tony Coelho. In the past few decades, the mental health community has accomplished much through tenacity. The same dedication that has brought us this far must be applied to decreasing stigma and promoting social inclusion in its place. It will require a devoted, concentrated effort, but we know from past successes that by working together we can achieve great things.\n\nApril 5, 2013\n\nPublic Address by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter\n\nAddress by Jimmy Carter from Parkroyal Hotel inYangon, Myanmar.\n\nIntroduction by H.E U.S. Ambassador to Myanmar Derek Mitchell: President Carter has been a hero of mine since I was all of 12 years old, when my mother and I stuffed envelopes in 1976 for my first presidential campaign in my home state of Connecticut.\n\nMarch 6, 2013\n\nChavez Legacy an Incomplete Revolution\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed, published by USA Today.\n\nHugo Chávez was a larger than life figure who dominated Venezuelan politics and shaped hemispheric relations as few leaders have done. He personified change in Venezuela and was the single unifying force in the country since 1999 – unifying his diverse supporters to follow his lead, and uniting his opponents to try to defeat him.\n\nFeb. 24, 2013\n\nChallenges of a Superpower (PDF)\n\nSpeech by Jimmy Carter to the Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, Calif.\n\nThank you. Thank you very much. Well, first of all, let me say that I'm glad to be here. This is not something that I do very often, but I came because of my — I'd say the influence and pressure from George Smith, my good friend, and when George asks you to do something, it's very hard to say no. Also, I wanted to follow in the footsteps of my wife, who was here two years ago, and I can't hope to fill those shoes, but I'll do the best I can.\n\nJan. 8, 2013\n\nNepal's Peace Process Needs Elections\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published in the Kathmandu Post and Kantipur newspaper\n\nI have a great interest in the future of this beautiful country, and was honored to visit Nepal three times in the year leading up to the Constituent Assembly elections in 2008. Since that time we have monitored the peace process continually, in Kathmandu and throughout all other regions. Observers from The Carter Center have been deployed in Nepal since 2007.\n\nDec. 20, 2012\n\nDespite Uncertainty, Venezuela's Political Scenarios Not all Bleak (PDF)\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed published by World Politics Review\n\nFor 14 years, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has galvanized his diverse supporters and united his opponents. Now, with Chávez apparently gravely ill, these centrifugal forces will be much harder to hold together, and many have predicted political instability, infighting within both camps and even violence. Nevertheless, three dynamics could help to prevent Venezuela from spinning out of control.\n\nDec. 10, 2012\n\nWestern Hemisphere Can Lead in Human Rights (En espańol)\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by Infobae.com\n\nAs President, I signed the American Convention on Human Rights in June 1977. Although the United States Senate has not ratified the convention, 25 other countries of the hemisphere did, and the Inter-American Court on Human Rights was born in 1979. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights was created much earlier and incorporated in the OAS Charter in 1967.\n\nDec. 10, 2012\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights\n\nGreetings from Atlanta! Although I could not be with you to celebrate Human Rights Day, I am glad to have this chance to speak with you.\n\nDec. 4, 2012\n\nStatehood Key to Renew Peace Talks\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by USA Today\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly vote last week that overwhelmingly recognized Palestine as a state could serve as a stepping stone to relaunch the long moribund Middle East peace negotiations.\n\nNov. 27, 2012\n\nTwo-Party Politics a Boon for Sierra Leone\n\nJohn Stremlau op-ed, published by BDlive\n\nSuccessful elections were held in Sierra Leone this month, another African good news story barely noted amid the headlines of the latest conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Middle East. But the 50-year sentence given to former Liberian head of state Charles Taylor earlier this year by an international tribunal for war crimes in Sierra Leone points to the history of horrors in that corner of Africa, which prompted journalist Robert Kaplan to famously forecast a \"coming anarchy\" — a proliferation of Sierra Leone-like failed states threatening global peace and security.\n\nOct. 28, 2012\n\nJimmy Carter to California: Yes on Prop. 34\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by the Los Angeles Times\n\nThe process for administering the death penalty in the United States is broken beyond repair, and it is time to choose a more effective and moral alternative. California voters will have the opportunity to do this on election day.\n\nOct. 15, 2012\n\nBeneath Chávez's Victory\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed, published by the Financial Times\n\nMost English-language commentary has attributed Hugo Chávez's surprising 11-point victory in Venezuela's presidential election on October 7 to oil-fueled public spending and \"ventajismo\" (incumbent use of state machinery to create an unlevel playing field and impressive mobilization), with some voters induced by fear of losing promised benefits to vote for the president. While all these factors contributed to the outcome, the analyses miss one additional factor explaining Chávez' political longevity.\n\nOct. 10, 2012\n\nA Third Option in Syria\n\nRobert A. Pastor op-ed, published by the Los Angeles Times\n\nThe conflict in Syria was \"extremely bad and getting worse.\" That's what Lakhdar Brahimi, special envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League and one of the world's most skillful diplomats, told the Security Council in late September. The major powers listened but offered no new ideas on how to end the crisis. We need to change direction.\n\nSept. 6, 2012\n\nPerspectives on Inter-American Relations\n\nRemarks by Jimmy Carter at the XVI Annual CAF Conference on Latin America in Washington D.C.\n\nPresident Garcia, Secretary-General Insulza, Dialogoue President Michael Shifter, President Leonel Fernandez, Ladies & Gentlemen: it is an honor and pleasure for me to attend this conference and to give my personal perspective on inter-American relations.\n\nJuly 4, 2012\n\nBehind Paraguay's Presidential Ouster\n\nJennifer McCoy op-ed, published by InterPress Service\n\nIn Paraguay, like Honduras, very little change has occurred in the gross inequities in land distribution.\n\nJune 24, 2012\n\nA Cruel and Unusual Record\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times\n\nThe United States is abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights. Revelations that top officials are targeting people to be assassinated abroad, including American citizens, are only the most recent, disturbing proof of how far our nation's violation of human rights has extended.\n\nJune 1, 2012\n\nThe Wisdom of Reforming Terrorist Designations\n\nNathan Stock op-ed, published by Foreign Policy\n\nIn 2008 — 18 years after New York City threw him a ticker tape parade for helping to end apartheid — it took an act of Congress to ensure that Nelson Mandela did not need a special waiver to enter the United States, finally removing his terrorist designation. In November 2011, Hezbollah leader Imad Mughniyah was removed from the \"Individuals and Entities Designated by the State Department Under E.O. 13224\" terrorist list. He had been dead for three and a half years.\n\nApril 25, 2012\n\nShow Death Penalty the Door\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nFor many reasons, it is time for Georgia and other states to abolish the death penalty. A recent poll showed that 61 percent of Americans would choose a punishment other than the death penalty for murder.\n\nApril 24, 2012\n\nWar on Drugs: There Has to Be a Better Way\n\nJennifer McCoy and Kristen Sample op-ed, published by the Miami Herald.\n\nThe main U.S. headlines coming out of the recent Summit of the Americas in Colombia were a sideshow about Secret Service misconduct and the perennially divisive question of Cuba, while President Obama touted the event as an opportunity to help jumpstart U.S. employment by selling more goods to a dynamic Latin America.\n\nApril 23, 2012\n\nPresident Carter Addresses 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates\n\nThe key goal for this 12th summit is for Nobel laureates to inspire younger generations. Having been a college professor for thirty years and with four children, 12 grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren I have personal experience and responsibilities to advise and educate young Americans. Remember that this is the audience I am addressing in my remarks.\n\nApril 12, 2012\n\nDon't Give Up on Mideast Peace\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published on nyt.com and a version of it appeared in print on April 13, 2012, in The International Herald Tribune.\n\nThe current focus of leaders in Washington and Jerusalem on Iran has obscured the near-death of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and the inevitable catastrophe toward which Israel is now moving.\n\nFeb. 9, 2012\n\nWaging Peace, Fighting Disease, Building Hope: A Conversation with President Jimmy Carter\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter presented this speech and participated in a Q&A during the gathering of the World Affairs Coucil in Seattle, Washington, Jan. 31, 2012.\n\nOn January 31, the World Affairs Council hosted our biggest event ever, featuring President Jimmy Carter speaking on \"Waging Peace, Fighting Disease, and Building Hope.\" Click here to view footage of the event in full > (Note: President Carter's speech begins at 29:37)\n\nDec. 15, 2011\n\nFixing Ailing System Achievable\n\nRosalynn Carter op-ed, published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nI became involved in mental health issues in 1966, campaigning for my husband for governor. A newspaper exposé had revealed terrible conditions in our large mental hospital, Central State in Milledgeville, and families of the patients there were frustrated and almost beyond hope that anything could be done to help their loved ones.\n\nNov. 18, 2011\n\nJohn Stremlau: Partners Crucial to Nurturing Liberian Democracy\n\nPublished by Business Day (Johannesburg).\n\nLiberia's fragile democracy suffered several setbacks surrounding last week's presidential run-off that are typical of many post-conflict African countries.\n\nOct. 19, 2011\n\nBlack Cherokees Exercise Hard-Won Right to Vote\n\nJohn Stremlau op-ed, published by CNN.com.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation had difficulty electing its principal chief, so much so that members called in the Carter Center to observe the most recent vote and judge whether it was free and fair. We normally observe elections only in politically troubled countries abroad but believe that the contentiousness and fundamental voting rights issues at stake -- and not just for the Cherokees -- justified this exceptional mission.\n\nSept. 13, 2011\n\nAfter the U.N. Vote on Palestine\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by the International Herald Tribute and NYTimes.com.\n\nIn September 1978, Anwar Sadat and Menachim Begin signed the Camp David Accords, following four Arab-Israeli wars in which Egypt had provided the overwhelming military force that threatened the existence of Israel.\n\nAug. 10, 2011\n\nWhat Is A Superpower?\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by Tikkun Magazine.\n\nAmerican military expenditures are now equal to those combined for all other nations, and it is good to know that our nation's defenses against a conventional attack are impregnable. It is also imperative that America remain vigilant against threats from terrorists. But the admirable characteristics of a nation are no more defined by its size and physical prowess than are those of a human being.\n\nJuly 13, 2011\n\nRemarks by Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter at the Funeral of Betty Ford\n\nThis eulogy was delivered by former First Lady Rosalynn Carter at the National Tribute to Former First Lady Betty Ford, held July 12, 2011, at Saint Margaret Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, Calif.\n\nBetty Ford was my friend and I'm honored to be here today to help celebrate the life of this truly remarkable woman. I never imagined when we first met 40 years ago that we would develop such a close and personal friendship.\n\nJune 17, 2011\n\nCall Off the Global Drug War\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nIn an extraordinary new initiative announced earlier this month, the Global Commission on Drug Policy has made some courageous and profoundly important recommendations in a report on how to bring more effective control over the illicit drug trade.\n\nMay 25, 2011\n\nThe Unchanged Path to Mideast Peace\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by the International Herald Tribune and NYT.com.\n\nIt was not a new U.S. policy concerning the borders of Israel, nor should it have been surprising to Israeli leaders, when President Obama stated: \"The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\"\n\nMay 3, 2011\n\nSupport The Palestinian Unity Government\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nThis is a decisive moment. Under the auspices of the Egyptian government, Palestine's two major political movements — Fatah and Hamas — are signing a reconciliation agreement on Wednesday that will permit both to contest elections for the presidency and legislature within a year.\n\nFeb. 16, 2011\n\nTwo Vital Steps on Path to Democracy in Egypt\n\nJohn Stremlau op-ed, published by CNN.com.\n\nThe resignation of President Hosni Mubarak was only the first step on what will be a long, difficult path toward genuine democratic governance — one that will need the support of the international community.\n\nFeb. 11, 2011\n\nCredible Elections for Egypt\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times/International Herald Tribune.\n\nEven at this point, after the dramatic announcement by the armed forces, no one can predict the ultimate outcome of the Egyptian drama. But there is a clear picture of the existing situation and a few obvious options for the future.\n\nFeb. 2, 2011\n\nSouth Africa Must Accept That Gbagbo Lost the Election\n\nJohn Stremlau op-ed, published by Business Day.\n\nSouth Africa may not have vital interests at stake in the Cote d'Ivoire election, but questioning the results certified by the United Nations (UN) risks harming those that do. Most at risk are the long-suffering Ivorian people and their neighbours, who are struggling to deal with a rising tide of refugees as a result of this unnecessary and unjustified crisis over presidential succession.\n\nJan. 15, 2011\n\nLooking to the Future in Sudan: Dr. Donald R. Hopkins' Letter to the Editor, The New York Times\n\nThis letter sent Jan. 11, 2011, by Carter Center Health Programs Vice President Donald R. Hopkins, M.D., M.P.H., is in response to an editorial published Jan. 8, 2011, by The New York Times.\n\n\"Southern Sudan Votes\" (editorial, Jan. 8) rightly notes that the government of southern Sudan has \"set up more than two dozen ministries and built schools and roads\" since the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement in 2005.\n\nDec. 21, 2010\n\nTutu, Carter: Time to Move on Mideast Peace\n\nJimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu op-ed, published by USA TODAY.\n\nFor nearly two decades, there have been peace processes in the Middle East but no peace. In recent visits to the region — including Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory — we have heard a consistent message: People want peace but are skeptical about the process and have little faith in the international community to deliver.\n\nDec. 6, 2010\n\nProgress on Neglected Disease is Moot If We Neglect to Count (PDF)\n\nDonald R. Hopkins op-ed, published by Nature Medicine. Abbreviated version reprinted with permission. The complete issue can be viewed at: http://www.nature.com/nm/index.\n\nThe recent global campaign launched against a select number of neglected tropical diseases is a welcome development. But we should be as careful about measuring progress toward the control or elimination of these diseases as we are about choosing which ones to target.\n\nNov. 24, 2010\n\nListen to North Korea\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The Washington Post.\n\nNo one can completely understand the motivations of the North Koreans, but it is entirely possible that their recent revelation of their uranium enrichment centrifuges and Pyongyang's shelling of a South Korean island Tuesday are designed to remind the world that they deserve respect in negotiations that will shape their future. Ultimately, the choice for the United States may be between diplomatic niceties and avoiding a catastrophic confrontation.\n\nNov. 10, 2010\n\nVeterans and Mental Health Care\n\nRosalynn Carter and Patrick Kennedy op-ed, published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThis Veterans Day, Americans will pay tribute to our military veterans, the men and women who have returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSept. 29, 2010\n\nTea Party and Me\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by USA Today.\n\nA number of readers of my new book have noted parallels between today's frustrated and even angry mood and a similar mood in the mid-1970s. Indeed, in some ways my successful campaign for the presidency in 1976 resembled the Tea Party movement of today.\n\nSept. 16, 2010\n\nNorth Korea Wants to Make a Deal\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by The New York Times.\n\nDuring my recent travels to North Korea and China, I received clear, strong signals that Pyongyang wants to restart negotiations on a comprehensive peace treaty with the United States and South Korea and on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nJuly 26, 2010\n\nAfrica: World Losing the War on Virulent, Preventable Childhood Diseases\n\nJimmy Carter and Koffi Annan op-ed, published by news outlets including AllAfrica.com, Nigeria's Business Day, and UAE National.\n\nVaccines have saved the lives of millions of children around the world, and have the potential to save millions more in the future as newer vaccines are developed and introduced.\n\nJuly 13, 2010\n\nTribute to Dr. Norman Borlaug: Speech by Jimmy Carter, Former US President and Founder, The Carter Center\n\nThis speech was presented by President Carter during Sasakawa Africa Association's 2010 Borlaug Symposium, \"Taking it to the Farmer.\" The Symposium was held in honor of the life and achievements of Carter Center Agriculture Program Senior Consultant Dr. Norman Borlaug and discussed the current realities and challenges facing African agriculture, particularly those affecting small-scale farmers and agricultural extensionists.\n\nMay 27, 2010\n\nHelping Our Vets Here at Home\n\nThomas Bornemann op-ed, published by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nOn Memorial Day, families across Georgia recognize the bravery and sacrifices of men and women in the armed forces. Yet, as we remember the fallen, a disturbing trend has become apparent — more and more of our military heroes are losing their lives not in combat, but from the often hidden, emotional wounds of war.\n\nApril 28, 2010\n\nSudan's Imperfect But Important Elections\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published the Los Angeles Times.\n\nOn Monday, the results of the April 11-15 elections in Sudan were announced: The ruling party's President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir won 68 percent of the vote.\n\nApril 6, 2010\n\nSudan Can Rid World of a Horrible Disease\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by CNN.com.\n\nOppressed by war and poverty for generations, the Sudanese have struggled with terrible hardships. But the people of this vast country have a narrow window of hope to achieve progress by ridding both their nation and the world of a horrible disease forever.\n\nMarch 30, 2010\n\nA Project for Haiti: The Eradication of Two Diseases\n\nThis letter to the editor of the New York Times by Carter Center Vice President for Health Programs Dr. Donald R. Hopkins was published March 30, 2010, in response to the March 28, 2010 editorial \"Making Haiti Whole.\"\n\nTwo projects that the donors conference on Haiti should consider this week are the binational plan that Haiti and the Dominican Republic announced last October to eliminate malaria by 2020, and the plan that Haiti announced simultaneously to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) by 2020 (the Dominican Republic expects to eliminate lymphatic filariasis this year).\n\nMarch 23, 2010\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Korea University, Seoul, Korea\n\nA Nuclear North Korea and Peace in the Korean Peninsula? My speech will cover three main subjects, and I hope to stimulate some questions from the audience.\n\nFeb. 2, 2010\n\nJimmy Carter: A Crisis in Sudan\n\nJimmy Carter op-ed, published by the Washington Post.\n\nOne of the most urgent responsibilities the international community faces is in Sudan, which is facing a renewal of nationwide violence.\n\nJan. 21, 2010\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Nuclear Proliferation\n\nThis speech was given by Jimmy Carter at the 2010 Middle Powers Initiative, an organization that brings together non-profit organizations with leaders from \"middle power\" governments to educate and encourage nuclear weapon states to take practical steps in order to reduce the dangers of nuclear proliferation.\n\nArchives"
