International PEN congratulates Orhan Pamuk on being awarded the Nobel Prize

International PEN congratulates Orhan Pamuk on being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Jirí Grušá, President of International PEN said today, ‘we congratulate Orhan Pamuk as an author who combines great writing with courage and humanistic wisdom. To PEN, he represents an opening of global perspectives towards the creation of a peaceful world of creative differences.’

International Secretary, Joanne Leedom-Ackerman welcomed the announcement saying ‘Orhan Pamuk’s rich and textured storytelling bridges worlds and opens doors to literature, history and language that shows civilisation at its crossroads.’

International PEN is delighted that the work of this important author is being celebrated in this way. Orhan Pamuk is a writer of extraordinary merit and he is also a great advocate for freedom of expression.

International PEN hopes that this award to Orhan Pamuk, who was himself on trial last year under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code for insulting ‘Turkishness,’ will serve to highlight the fact that there are still many writers and journalists in Turkey who are on trial solely for expressing their opinions.

‘Orhan Pamuk writes on issues that relate to identity and the experience of minorities. For too many writers in Turkey, this can lead them into the courtroom and in some cases, prison. We are especially pleased that a writer of such quality and courage has received this honour,’ commented Dr Karin Clark, Chair of the Writers in Prison Committee.
