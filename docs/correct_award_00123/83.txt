Orhan Pamuk Wiins Nobel Prize for Literature

Oct 19 2006

Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist known for his free speech struggles with the Turkish government, has won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Academy head Horace Engdahl said Pamuk was selected not for political reasons, but because he had "enlarged the roots of the contemporary novel" through his links to both Western and Eastern culture. Pamuk, whose novels include Snow and My Name is Red, was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in its history: the massacre of Armenians during WWI, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's Kurdish southeast. Charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.
