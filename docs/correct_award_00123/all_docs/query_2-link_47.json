        "meta_description": "Orhan Pamuk is a writer-artist who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. Born in Istanbul in 1952, Pamuk intended until the age of 22 to be a painter and was thus encouraged by his family. In the 1960s and ’70s, as he describes in his book of autobiographical essays Istanbul (2003), he photographed the streets ofIstanbul to use in his paintings; his early desire to take photos is explored in the introduction to the illustrated version of Istanbul (2017). The Museum of Innocence is both a novel Pamuk published in 2008 and a museum he opened in Istanbul in 2012 that exhibits the objects, pictures, papers and photographs described in the story. The Museum of Innocence received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2014. Pamuk has now been taking photos for over fifty years.",
