        "text": "(Istanbul, 1952). He is one of the main contemporary Turkish writers, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature 2006. After leaving his architecture degree course, he went on to study journalism, but he did not exercise the profession as he was soon exclusively devoted to writing literature. His work is profoundly inspired by Istanbul, his native city, marked both by the cultural shock and class between east and west. He has been translated into over sixty languages and has won numerous Turkish and international prizes. He currently combines his literary career with his work lecturing at Columbia University in New York.\n\nHe received his first international accolade in 1985 with the novel The White Castle and his consolidation came a decade later thanks to My Name is Red. Apart from the book of memories Istanbul: Memories and the City and various collections of essays, he is the author of a further eight fictional works: Cevdet Bey and His Sons, The New Life, Snow, The Museum of Innocence, A Strangeness in My Mind and The Red-Haired Woman. Nearly all of his works can be found published in Catalan by Bromera and Més Llibres, and in Spanish by Literatura Random House.\n\nWithin the collection Breus, the CCCB has published Els museus i les novel·les / Museums and novels, the lecture that he gave in 2010 to inaugurate the Barcelona Debate of that year."
