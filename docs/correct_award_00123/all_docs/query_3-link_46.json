        "text": "The writer Orhan Pamuk, laureate of the Nobel Prize (2006), was one of the special guests of the Western University of Timișoara in the year of the European Capital of Culture. There were two special meetings with the public, firsts for the local cultural environment.\n\nThe first of these meetings took place on Monday, April 3, 2023, from 19.30:01 p.m., in the Aula Magna of UVT. The prestigious writer offered a vision of the culture and literature of the border space located between the East and the West, participating in a public debate moderated by the writer Radu Paraschivescu. The number of places was limited, and access was strictly based on personalized invitations sent to the e-mail address. In addition, in order to provide the necessary comfort to people who could not participate in the Aula Magna due to the capacity of the hall, we have also made available other rooms (AM, A11, AXNUMX) in which the conference held in the Aula Magna was broadcast. In order to ensure the best possible experience, we opted to use the INTERACTIO application for real-time translation from English, accessible from your own phone.\n\nOn April 4, from 10 a.m., also in the Aula Magna, the academic community of UVT awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa to the famous writer Orhan Pamuk, in a special celebration for the Romanian and European cultural and intellectual space.\n\nUVT rector, Marilen Gabriel Pirtea: \"We are honored by the entry of the distinguished Nobel Laureate into the ranks of our academic community. By awarding the title of Doctor Honoris Causa Literarum Humaniorum, Western University gratefully acknowledges the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk for encouraging us to believe in a world with more centers than edges.\"\n\nOrhan Pamuk is one of the most famous contemporary Turkish writers, his works have been translated into more than 40 languages ​​and published in more than 100 countries. In the most important themes that play a central role in his works, the Turkish writer evokes the relationship between Eastern and Western culture, but also the strong specificity of the Turkish mentality, in which floats the multiple melancholy that can also be felt in the air of Istanbul, explained by Orhan Pamuk by the term hüzün, a specifically Turkish synonym for melancholy as understood by Western Europeans.\n\nOn October 12, 2006, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, being the first Turkish laureate of this prestigious award. Among his most famous volumes are \"My name is Red\", \"Istanbul\" or \"The Museum of Innocence\".\n\nTwo other Nobel laureates are on the UVT guest list in 2023 – Jean-Marie Lehn, laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 and Jean-Pierre Sauvage, laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016.\n\nThe events are part of the cultural program \"At UVT, Culture is the Capital!\", included in the Cultural Program \"Timișoara 2023 - European Capital of Culture\", the Oameni territory, the Reflections station, financed by the Municipality of Timișoara through the Project Center. The main partners are: CTP, BOSCH and Bioclinica."
