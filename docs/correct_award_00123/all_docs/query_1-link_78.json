        "text": "Orhan Pamuk is a well-known Turkish novelist in the contemporary world literature. He writes his novels in the Turkish Language. However, his novels were translated into more than 60 languages of the world today. He has a unique style and his most important themes are conflict and confluence of the West and Islam, and the argumentative issues of identity. He portrays his characters genuinely, as he meets them throughout his life, regardless of whether his heroes look like him or not. He does his best to identify them. He believes that the history of the novel is simply the historical background of human freedom. Up to now, only eleven novels of his literary works were translated into English. He has got many prizes for literature, for instance, in 2005, he was granted the Peace Prize for creative writing of novel in Germany, and in 2006, he has won the Nobel Prize for literature, as well as in the same year, he was selected in the United States of America as one of the 100 most effective people in the world, who shape the universe by speaking up. This paper will discuss Pamuk's own personal life, his style of writing and the themes of his novels as well as what kind of character he is dealing with. It also tells the story of Pamuk when he talked to a Swiss Magazine about the killing of Kurds and the Armenian Genocide.\n\nThe question of Turkish identity is one of the main themes in Orhan Pamuk's novels. Since his first work, Cevdet Bey and His Sons, Pamuk has deeply explored the identity crisis of characters belonging to a world pending between East and West. The purpose of this essay is to analyze the theme of identity crisis in Pamuk's literary works from an anthropological point of view. The theoretical framework used in this study is based on Edward Said's work, Orientalism. The analysis focuses particularly on The Black Book, in which the characters seem to be afflicted by two opposite forces: On one hand, they are obsessed with the desire to imitate the West; on the other hand, they are attracted by the dream of a lost Turkish authenticity. This study aims to define the role played by the images of the West in Pamuk's novels and at point out how these representations have shaped, and continue to shape, the process of the identity construction in the Turkish culture.\n\nOrhan Pamuk is a controversial writer whose works have often caused controversy at both home and abroad. While Pamuk's brilliance as a writer has been contested by few, if any critics, his status as an enfant terrible of Turkish Literature is due to his ability to force the custodians of Turkey's secular institutions to question if the identity crises the modern day republic is experiencing, is not due to the rigorous censorship of Turkey's forgotten and forbidden Ottoman past? Pamuk's novels, especially My Name is Red and The Black Book, explore the theme of subaltern identities and how certain identities while buried beneath the grand narrative of the secular Turkish Republic, reinforce their presence through various means. Writers such as Pamuk, with their fingers on the pulse of Turkey's identity crises, explore through the means of fiction, how certain identities, especially those related to Turkey's Ottoman past and its esoteric Sufi traditions have continued to haunt the modern day Republic. This article explores Pamuk's attempts to unearth Turkey's forbidden past with the help of certain \"silenced\" narratives that I refer to as \"subaltern narratives\" in this paper.\n\nChapter 5, pp. 178-207. Keywords: Headscarf controversy; political Islam; Armenian genocide; political exile; hidden symmetry; the veiled and the unveiled Orhan Pamuk sets Snow (2002) in the village of Kars in the eastern Anatolia province of Turkey, far away from the multicultural city of Istanbul that links Europe and Asia, in order to foreground the tensions and resistance between Islam and Turkey’s secular state as girls, forbidden to wear head scarves to school, commit suicide. The protagonist Ka, a poet posing as a journalist, is caught between the factions of political Islamists and militant nationalists. His dilemma forecasts Pamuk’s own arrest and trial in Istanbul in 2005 on charges of “insulting Turkishness” for suggesting that responsibility for the Armenian genocide in Anatolia in 1915 lies with the Turkish Republic. The novel’s diegetic narrator “Orhan Bey” finds the “hidden symmetry” of a snowflake design that organizes Ka’s book of poems, Snow, on three axes of Reason, Imagination, and Memory, though the poems themselves are lost. Orhan Bey’s novel is likewise organized according to a hexagonal design whose three axes are traversed by pairings of the Veiled/Unveiled, Politics/Beauty, and Belief/Incredulity. Pamuk’s Snow negotiates the local conflicts between conservative Islamists and secular republicans, but as a global novel that defends freedom of expression it fulfills his conviction that cosmopolitan citizens “do their deepest thinking about themselves” by reading literature."
