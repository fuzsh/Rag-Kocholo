        "text": "Why is Christian Science in our name?\n\nOur name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that.\n\nThe Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it.\n\nHere, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope.\n\nExplore values journalism About us\n\nThe Nobel committee in 2006 awarded the literature prize to Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, \"who in the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures.\" He is the first and only Turkish citizen to win the award.\n\nSome observers saw political implications in the European committee awarding the Nobel to Mr. Pamuk, a vocal critic of the killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Much of Europe labels the killings a genocide, a classification that Turkey denies. Arne Ruth, the former editor-in-chief of the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, told The New York Times that Pamuk “is a symbol of the relationship between Europe and Turkey, and they couldn’t have overlooked this when they made their choice.”"
