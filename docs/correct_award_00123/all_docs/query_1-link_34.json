        "text": "New York | The Nobel Prize committee could not have picked a more divisive winner for literature than Orhan Pamuk, a writer from a predominantly Muslim country whose life and works illustrate the struggle to find a balance between East and West.\n\nThat was reflected in the range of reaction in his homeland Thursday, from Turkish nationalists professing shame at the selection of a man who speaks of the oppression of Armenians and Kurds, to Turkish writers calling it a historic moment for their rich literary tradition.\n\nPamuk has long been beloved in Europe as the lyrical voice of a society in flux, and to some, his victory was another symbol of Turkey's emergence as a Western nation after decades of self-conscious cultural reform. To others, he is just another example of the West telling Turkey it should be something it's not.\n\nFrom an early age, Pamuk has had a troubled love affair with his native Istanbul, raised in a city and by a family that had known better times, imagining he had a double, another Orhan, who remained in his childhood home while the author moved on.\n\n\"Here we come to the heart of the matter,\" Pamuk writes in Istanbul, a memoir published last year.\n\n\"I've never left Istanbul, never left the houses, streets, and neighborhoods of my childhood. Although I've lived in different districts from time to time, fifty years on I find myself back … where my first photographs were taken and where my mother first held me in her arms to show me the world.\"\n\nThe real Orhan, the famous one, is now an international symbol of social conscience, whose frank talk about the slaughter of Armenians brought the threat of imprisonment, and whose poetic, melancholy narratives brought him the book world's ultimate blessing.\n\nPamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, said he accepted the award not just as \"a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent.\"\n\nPamuk will receive a $1.4 million check, a gold medal and diploma, and an invitation to a lavish banquet in Stockholm, Sweden, on Dec. 10, the 110th anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel.\n\nBetter-known works by Orhan Pamuk, who won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday: 'Cevdet Bey Ve Ogullar' (1982) 'Sessiz Ev' (1983) 'The White Castle' (1991) 'The Black Book' (1994) 'The New Life' (1997) 'My Name is Red' (2001) 'Snow' (2004) 'Istanbul: Memories and the City' (2005)\n\nother writings"
