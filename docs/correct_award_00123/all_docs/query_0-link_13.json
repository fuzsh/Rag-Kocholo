        "text": "Orhan Pamuk (born June 7, 1952, Istanbul, Turkey) is a Turkish novelist, best known for works that probe Turkish identity and history. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006.\n\nRaised in a wealthy and Western-oriented family, Pamuk attended Robert College, an American school in Istanbul, and went on to study architecture at Istanbul Technical University. After three years he dropped out and devoted himself full-time to writing. In 1977 he graduated from the University of Istanbul with a degree in journalism. From 1985 to 1988 he lived in the United States and was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York and the University of Iowa.\n\nPamuk began writing seriously in 1974 and eight years later published his first novel, Cevdet Bey ve oğulları (“Cevdet Bey and His Sons”), a sweeping history of an Istanbul family during and after the establishment of the Turkish republic. He followed it with Sessiz ev (1983; Silent House), relying on multiple narrators to shape the story of a family gathering on the eve of the Turkish military coup of 1980. Pamuk first achieved international fame with Beyaz kale (1985; The White Castle), his third novel, which explores the nature of identity through the story of a learned young Italian captured and made a slave to a scholar in 17th-century Istanbul. His subsequent novels, which were widely translated, included Kara kitap (1990; The Black Book), a dense depiction of Istanbul, and the mysteries Yeni hayat (1996; The New Life) and Benim adım kırmızı (1998; My Name Is Red).\n\nIn Kar (2002; Snow) a Turkish poet living in exile in Germany faces the tensions between East and West when he travels to a poor town in a remote area of Turkey. Masumiyet müzesi (2008; The Museum of Innocence) investigates the relationship between an older man and his second cousin. Thwarted in his attempts to marry her, the man begins to collect objects that she has touched. Pamuk replicated the titular museum in reality, using a house in Istanbul to display a range of items amassed while plotting the story; it opened to the public in 2012, accompanied by the catalogue Şeylerin masumiyeti (The Innocence of Objects). The novel Kırmızı saçlı kadın (2016; The Red-Haired Woman) centres on the familial relationship that forms between a well digger and his apprentice. Among Pamuk’s other works were İstanbul: hatıralar ve şehir (2004; Istanbul: Memories and the City, also published as Istanbul: Memories of a City), a partly fictionalized memoir, and The Naive and Sentimental Novelist (2010), in which he explicated his theories on the novel as a literary form. Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık (2014; A Strangeness in My Mind) is a love story set in Istanbul. Balkon (2019; “Balcony”) is a collection of photographs Pamuk took from the balcony of his home."
