        "text": "For years I have heard what a dull film Mai Zetterling’s Loving Couples is, and I always knew it was an opinion worth flushing down the toilet because it came from the sort who think that Coppola and Kubrick made good movies. (Such persons exist.) Loving Couples, it turns out, is utterly fascinating, amazingly empathetic towards its female characters in a maternity ward that doubles (metaphorically speaking) as an insane asylum, and just wonderful in its seamless interweaving of present and reverie. The Swedish film is highly Bergmanesque, what with Sven Nykvist’s black-and-white cinematography (stencil gray indoors, beauteous outdoors in Nature), and with Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Gunnar Björnstrand, Eva Dahlbeck, Anita Björk, Jan Malmsjö, Ake Grönberg and others onboard. But that coldness of Bergman’s is absent, and Zetterling’s use of the camera is far more relaxed, given to sustained pans, for example, not chiseled, sculptured. Zetterling’s shots are claustrophobic only when she wants them to be.\n\nOne may rue the compromise that a false ending applies to the material, but the film’s sensitivity to homosexuality and lesbianism refreshes. Bergman, too, essays the theme of the conventional straightjacket that society readies for girls and women, but Zetterling, unlike Bergman, balances this with another motive: female solidarity. I was unsentimentally moved to tears by passages of this film; this has never happened to me while watching a Bergman film.\n\nPlease do not misrepresent my opinion. Bergman has made masterpieces; Zetterling’s film is hardly a masterpiece. But it’s very fine, highly intelligent, and more humane than Bergman, who, after all, is misogynistic behind the curtain of that curiosity and clinical interest of his in women.\n\nTwo asides: one, Loving Couples—Älskande par—shows Bergman’s influence less than it reveals how much both Bergman and Zetterling owe to Alf Sjöberg (Miss Julie, 1950), for whom Bergman began as a screenwriter and whom he has acknowledged as a mentor; two, you know the double-take that we all make whenever we see Sandra Bullock onscreen? Think Gunnel Lindblom."
