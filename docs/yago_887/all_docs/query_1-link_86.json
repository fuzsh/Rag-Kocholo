        "text": "The Swedish Film Institute’s digitally restored Swedish films continue to be enjoyed the world over. Classics by Mai Zetterling, Jan Troell, Alf Sjöberg and Victor Sjöström are currently showing in Tokyo and Paris.\n\nTouring under the name ‘Sweden-Japan 150 Years: An Invitation to Swedish Film History,’ the programme features screenings of 30 Swedish classics at the National Film Archive of Japan in Tokyo. Coinciding with events celebrating 150 years since Sweden and Japan established diplomatic relations with one another, this film series kicked off on 27 November and continues through 23 December.\n\nFeatured films were made between the 1930s–80s, and many have been digitally restored by the Swedish Film Institute. Films include Gustaf Molander’s A Woman’s Face (1938) featuring Ingrid Bergman in the leading role, Alf Sjöberg’s Only a Mother (1949) with Eva Dahlbeck, Arne Mattsson’s ‘Swedish sin’ classic One Summer of Happiness (1951), Jan Troell’s Here is Your Life (1966) and Mai Zetterling’s ground-breaking The Girls from 1968. The Ingmar Bergman centenary continues across the globe, with Japanese screenings of Prison (1949) and Sawdust and Tinsel (1953). Kajsa Hedström, project manager for Bergman100 for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation and the Swedish Film Institute, will attend the screenings in Tokyo.\n\nJapanese newsreel film Sueeden koutaishi-denka douhi-denka goraicho – featuring footage from Swedish Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf’s trip to Tokyo in 1926 – will also be shown. A vintage nitrate print of the film was recently discovered in Stockholm, and on behalf of the Japanese Film Archives’ request, the Swedish Film Institute transferred and preserved new screening material onto 35mm at SFI’s photochemical laboratory in Rotebro.\n\nInterest in Swedish film classics extends beyond Japan. Beginning last week and extending through 11 December, eight Swedish silent films are screening at Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé in Paris. Films include digitally restored Witchcraft Through the Ages (Benjamin Christensen, 1922) and a restored 35mm copy of The Norrtull Gang (Per Lindberg, 1923). In addition, Victor Sjöström’s The Price of Betrayal from 1915 – which for quite some time was considered lost but was recently found and restored by the CNC French Film Archives in Bois d’Arcy with assistance from the Swedish Film Institute – is included in the series.\n\nJon Wengström, head of Archival Film Collections at the Swedish Film Institute, curated the programme and will introduce many of the films in Paris, as well as lecturing on Greta Garbo with screenings of short films and photographs. Wengström also compiled the film programme in Tokyo, along with the Japanese hosts.\n\n– How fantastic to exhibit our filmic legacy in this way. Our excellent working relationship with our Japanese colleagues goes way back – we recently screened a series of analogue restored Swedish silent films in Tokyo. This time round, it’s fun to be given the opportunity to present so many of our digitally restored films, Jon Wengström explains.\n\nFollow us on social media:"
