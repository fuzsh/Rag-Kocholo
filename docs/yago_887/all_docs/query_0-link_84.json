        "text": "The entry compares the flâneur in Hjalmar Söderberg’s debut novel to the one established by Baudelaire, which was later conceptually refined by Walter Benjamin. It is claimed that the flânerie is almost free-floating, sometimes tied to certain characters, sometimes not. The invisible extra-diegetic third person narrator comes to resemble a camera lens. Förvillelser also contains traits of precinematic media that further strengthen the link to the visual and cinematic qualities in a novel that was published almost simultaneously with the production of the very first film segments (1895)."
