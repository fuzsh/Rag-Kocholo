        "text": "Margaret Atwood\n\nDoctor Glas by Hjalmar Södberg\n\n\"Now I sit at my open window, writing - for whom? Not for any friend or mistress. Scarcely for myself, even. I do not read today what I wrote yesterday; nor shall I read this tomorrow. I write simply so my hand can move, my thoughts move of their own accord. I write to kill a sleepless hour. Why can't I sleep? After all, I've committed no crime.\"\n\nThis short, astonishing novel arrived in the mail a couple of years ago, sent by Swedish friends who ferret in secondhand bookstores in search of Swedish books in translation which they think I might like. They were spot-on with this one. Doctor Glas was first published in 1905 and caused a scandal then, in Sweden, for reasons that had to do with its handling of those two scandalous items, sex and death - not to mention their sub-sets, abortion and euthanasia.\n\nThe version I have is a tattered paperback from 1970, a reissue of a 1963 translation - published I suppose to coincide with a film based on it, directed incidentally by Mai Zetterling. On the back of my copy are various encomiums, from the Observer, the Guardian, the Sunday Telegraph, the Glasgow Herald -\"a masterpiece\", \"the most remarkable book of the year\", and so forth. Still, as far as I know, Doctor Glas has long been out of print, at least in its English version.\n\nThe narrator of Doctor Glas is Doctor Glas, a thirtyish man whose journal we hypocrites lecteurs read over his shoulder as he composes it. His is the remarkable yet unnervingly familiar voice we follow in its reflections, its prevarications, its self-denunciations, its boredoms, its wistfulness, its lyrical praises or splenetic denunciations of the weather. A romantic idealist turned solitary and sad, afflicted with fin-de-siècle malaise, pestered by thoughts of Darwin and duty, Baudelaire and escapism, the longing for love and action, and the sceptical inertia of his age, unable to fall in love except with women who are in love with someone else, infested by his own unconscious - of which he is fitfully conscious - he offers both the candid transparency and the narcissism his surname would suggest.\n\nHowever, it's no accident that his second name is Gabriel, for he is tempted to play Angel of Life to a beautiful woman who arrives at his surgery one day begging for his help. Ignorant of what marriage entails, she has allowed herself to be pawned off on a \"respectable\" but morally and physically loathsome clergyman. The help she wants from Glas is freedom from this troll's sexual attentions, which she finds repugnant in the extreme - especially since she is having an affair with another man. Doctor Glas takes pity on her and invents a disease for her, and lies to the husband about it for her sake.\n\nThus it begins. Angels can of course be angels of death as well as of life, and doctors are very conveniently situated for this role. I won't spoil the plot by telling what happens next, but it's a cunning triple-tied knot. Doctor Glas is deeply unsettling, in the way certain dreams are - or, no coincidence, certain films by Bergman, who must have read it. It moves from the sordid to the banal to the anxiously surreal to the visionary with economy and impressive style. A few years earlier and it would never have been published; a few years later and it would have been dubbed a forerunner of stream-of-consciousness. It occurs on the cusp of our century, opening doors we've been opening ever since.\n\n\"And now, as I sit at my open window, writing this by a flickering candle - I detest touching oil lamps and my housekeeper is sleeping too soundly after her funeral coffee and cakes for me to have the heart to wake her - now, as the candleflame flutters in the draught and my shadow shivers and flutters like the flame on the wallpaper, as if trying to come to life - now I think of Hans Andersen and his tale of the shadow. And it seems to me I am the shadow who wished to become a man.\"\n\n© OW Toad, 2000.\n\nJohn Irving\n\nThe Headmaster's Papers by Richard A Hawley\n\nThe Headmaster's Papers, a novel by Richard A Hawley, was first published in 1983 by a small, independent publisher in Middlebury, Vermont - Paul S Eriksson. At the time, the author was himself a headmaster; he was a teacher and the director of the upper school division of the University School, an independent school in Cleveland, Ohio. The Headmaster's Papers is an epistolary novel - a form I much admire, chiefly for the difficulty of writing a novel with such a limited structure. The best writer of fiction in the epistolary form is Alice Munro, and I told Alice once that two things prevented me from trying to write an epistolary novel, which I have long been tempted to do.\n\nOne is that Alice has already written better in this form than anyone likely will, and two is that Richard A Hawley wrote The Headmaster's Papers, an epistolary novel so heartbreaking that no one is likely to surpass its emotional effect in letter form. I sent a copy of the novel to Alice; she liked it very much. We had a further conversation about epistolary novels, and I told her that I thought Hawley's novel was so moving that he establishes a virtual rule for future epistolary novels: namely, the last letter in the novel has to be a suicide note.\n\nNothing else will do. The Headmaster's Papers is entirely composed of one man's letters - John Greeve's, the suffering headmaster at an all-boys' private school. His name is well-chosen. In Hawley's journal, before he began the novel, he wrote: \"Imagine a good man whose props have fallen away.\" That is John Greeve - a very good man, whose life has been to guide others but who finds himself, in his middle 50s, rudderless and at sea. His letters are to friends, to the angry parents of boys dismissed from school, to his own son - lost to drugs and wandering in Europe, or (the reader presumes) most likely dead.\n\nAlso, included among Greeve's \"papers\" are his public addresses to the boys and faculty of his school, and his heartfelt (occasionally too heartfelt) poems, which he submits to various small magazines. From his letters, we see how impossibly \"good\" Greeve's standards are; we also see his own efforts to maintain himself, with dignity and grace, slipping. His wife is dying of cancer. When she dies, Greeve gives up. In his last letter to his lost son, Greeve writes: \"We are forever in the stands, kid. Sorry.\" In his suicide notes, to old friends, he writes: \"This is not a tragedy. I am used up.\" But he's wrong; The Headmaster's Papers is a tragedy, a fine one. I implied earlier that the last letter in Hawley's novel is a suicide note, but this isn't exactly true - the suicide note is next to last. The last letter is a kind of PS to the suicide note, or a different kind of suicide note from the first one - call it suicide note number two. Greeve submits a poem to his school's quarterly magazine.\n\nTo the editor, he writes: \"I know we don't print poems as a rule, but since there will be no Headmaster's Letter, maybe you could work it in.\" The poem itself is one of John Greeve's best, the closing lines of which can be read as suicide note number three. \"A bright road opening wide to me Ghost children chanting something About verbs They are cheering in waves Hymns from voices clear and sad And gone as bells Hurrying bells, evening bells School bells banging me back To school.\"\n\nBack in 1983, the novel received a fair amount of well-deserved attention - especially for a first novel, and for a small-press publication. The Boston Globe compared Hawley to Louis Auchincloss, and Mr Auchincloss himself wrote in praise of the novel - as did I: \"The headmaster is a character ripe with nobility, and with personal failure and hopelessness,\" I wrote. \"Mr Hawley has the poise and vision of a writer who can create a whole world.\"\n\nIt was successful enough to merit a paperback sale - to Bantam, in 1984. And in 1992 Eriksson published a revised paperback edition of the novel, with a foreword and afterword by the author. Both are interesting but unnecessary; the novel works best all by itself. Whatever narrative limitations are imposed on an epistolary novel, The Headmaster's Papers demonstrates that a good man's suffering can be felt in his letters as keenly as in any other form of storytelling.\n\n© John Irving, 2000.

But I have a clear memory of a Saturday in the summer of 1990, during a year when I tried to live one month in Dublin followed by one month in Barcelona and managed not to live much at all, but spent my time oddly disentangled, disengaged, suspended. And the book hit me hard.\n\nI remember late on a Saturday night, in a tiny room in a flat near Santa Maria del Mar, realising that if I did not put this book down I would finish it that night, and when I woke in the morning I would not have it. I put it aside and slept and then woke with the absolute and uncomplicated pleasure you normally get from finding a delightful and half-forgotten bloke in bed beside you. I started reading again and I am still recovering, in certain ways, from what I learned.\n\nThe book is Juan Goytisolo's memoir Forbidden Territory, which was published in hardback by Quartet in England. I don't know if it ever made it to a paperback. Goytisolo was brought up in bourgeois Barcelona, where the upper middle classes have remained undisturbed for a hundred and fifty years. Neither world war, nor the Spanish civil war have had much impact on them, except to make them conservative in ways that are almost exquisite.\n\nAs a child, Goytisolo was sexually interfered with by his grandfather, and as an adult, he is determined that the sort of sexual repression which led to this will not govern his life, but rather become the source of his liberation. His mother Julia Gay was killed by a bomb during the civil war when he was a small boy (he was born in 1931) and that sorrow and a strange guilt, as anyone who has lost a parent in childhood will know, follow him everywhere. He goes, as all good Catalans go, to Paris and there he meets Jean Genet who asks him straight out if he is a homosexual.\n\nGoytisolo is a provincial; his editor Monique Lange, who will be his lover for many years, is also in the room. He cannot answer; he hesitates. Maybe he is a homosexual. And later he tells us that at the time of writing the book he spends half the year with a working-class Moroccan man. It is complicated, so he cannot answer straight, but he feels shame about this, and Genet has no more time for fear and shame and prevarication.\n\nI love the dark truths which Goytisolo is prepared to explore in the book. He is the boy who suffers alienation from family and Catalan society, who suddenly realises that, elsewhere, alienation - it is Paris in the 50s - has become the new enlightenment. But this is not a cure, merely an explanation and, at times, a comfort. The damaged self is alone in this book; the aim of the journey is to know and explore the damage because it cannot be repaired. Things must be faced, and this is something I wish I could come to terms with. Goytisolo realised that the enemy lingers in the language itself, and that language remains, no matter who else has used it, a soft wax when you are alone in a room with it.\n\nHis novels are a great roar against the Spanish tradition since 1492, against grammar and syntax, as much as inherited boundaries and notions of culture and civilisation. The first volume of his memoirs set the context for this: he is uncompromising and honest not about the things which it is easy to be uncompromising and honest about - Franco's Spain, bourgeois life - but about the forbidden territory of the self, the things we wish to keep hidden.\n\n© Colm Tóibín, 2000.\n\nMichael Ondaatje\n\nBringing Tony Home by Tissa Abeysekara\n\nWhen I first read Bringing Tony Home three years ago, it felt as if I had come across a book from my childhood, one I already knew well. It was of course my childhood I had come across, found evoked - with that strange, exaggerated sense of description (\"as the woman disappeared inside the house I noticed she was frighteningly thin and flat like a steamroller had gone over her\"), and enlarged sense of things, such as a too-heavy jug one was supposed to carry a great distance.\n\nThe book had the delicious sad sense of being a solitary in the world, with a thousand intricacies between you and your closest neighbour or relative. Bringing Tony Home was written in 1996 and is not a \"lost classic\", but I had the sense of having found one. Something about the way it was written, was slipped by accident into my hands, something about its quick disappearance and, in fact, its non-appearance in the West, made it one.\n\n\"In the last years of the forties, when I had still not reached ten years of age, my family became desperately poor.\" So begins Bringing Tony Home.\n\nThe author, Tissa Abeysekara, is a contemporary Sri Lankan film-maker who in mid-life wrote this first novella or memoir about a disappearing moment from his childhood. It is a book written by someone roughly my age, about a mutual era of childhood. I had, till reading it, never found a book with such a physical echo of my life in Sri Lanka. Usually, I transpose the location and setting in any novel about childhood that I read so I can fit the events into a familiar place.\n\nFor instance, as a boy in Sri Lanka I knew only one house with a staircase and so for many years whenever anyone in a novel climbed or descended the stairs, whether a Karamazov or the Count of Monte Cristo, they did so in my Aunt Nedra's house. So Tissa Abeysekara's slim novel about a childhood loss took me right to the place of my youth. Not just to Sri Lanka, not just to Colombo, but specifically to the High Level Road in Boralesgamuwa. And there, in a place I knew and could recognise - and could slip into without translation - I was introduced to the people in his boyhood story, coloured and altered by the 40 years of the author's adult life.\n\nIt is a simple story about a family that has to move because of a change in fortune and in doing so, it becomes necessary to leave behind the family dog. The boy, a week later, returns on his own to the village to look for \"Tony\", and because of the narrator's smallness and because of the \"largeness\" of the world around him, the journey he makes is mythic. \"The glass smelled vaguely of sardine and the water tasted like when it is taken from a galvanised bucket, but I drank it all in one breath and returned the glass to the woman with both hands...\"\n\nI feel that already I am simplifying a privately heard tale. It is a book I wish to share only by passing it over to a reader. Funny and tender. Dangerous. Unfair. And, of course, it is one of the saddest stories. What is wonderful is the way Abeysekara can make a whole era hang on a single strand of memory:\n\n\"Each year during the April season a giant wheel would be constructed in Depanama and it would be there till after Wesak; this year they were constructing it on the little hill overlooking the Pannipitiya Railway Station where, once upon a time there was a tennis court, and every Saturday Father would come in the evening to play tennis with Messrs Arthur Kotelawala, Bulner, Subasingha, and the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, and I would sit perched on the embankment by the cactus bushes with Guneris the servant boy and watch the trains come and go in the station below, and during the Sri Pada season which was from early January to late May, the trains were full of pilgrims and white cloth fluttered like bird feathers from the windows, sheaths of areacanut pods bristled, voices chanted and along with it the iron wheels of the train braked, clanged and screeched all blending together in perfect harmony and held together by the sad melancholy whistle of the train as it left the station and behind was the sound of the tennis ball hitting the racquet the ground or the net in a soft but clear and varying rhythm...\n\n\"Then one by one they stopped playing; Mr Subasingha disappeared because - I heard my mother and father whispering to each other - his wife had run away with a Tamil gentleman who was the Apothecary at the local government dispensary; Mr Kotelawala had a stroke and was ordered complete rest; the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, started drinking during the day also and was too drunk by evening to play tennis, and old Mr Bulner simply stopped playing.\n\nWe moved from the big house to the small one at Depanama and Father had no time to play for he left early in the morning on a bicycle and would return late at night even on Saturdays, and sometimes he would be gone for days. And the tennis court was abandoned and weeds grew all over it and the iron roller that used to level the court was dragged by some village boys to the top of the little hill and rolled down where it ended in a ditch and lay there like a broken animal.\"\n\nThe portrait of the world is farcical and formal in the way the author insists on giving us a torrent of details and names and everyone's official role, for children know and remember the labels on adults: the Apothecary, the Station Master. Because it is these details of society in his memory, blending together in perfect harmony, that once held his childhood society together. But the habits of parents, the memories of public fights, disappear and are discovered to be mutable - so it is a book not just of a child dealing with the loss of one dear dog, but of everything, the whole world that surrounds his life.\n\nAccordingly, the descriptions are detailed and frantic, an aria of lists that tries to hold the past together - in the way that the adult film-maker in a subliminal subplot continues to make films, now in this region.\n\n\"Forty-five years later I killed myself trying to capture something of this atmosphere in the opening scene of Pitagamkarayo, and the paddy field on which the final sequence was staged was the very same paddy field.\" The tragedy within the book is not the loss of the animal per se , but the boy's awareness that he must in the end leave it. He is being forced to turn into an adult, which is the deeper sadness in this story. On a second reading we realise that the boy in the story is looking back, so that contemporary opinions and events also flood in within this \"slight\" story, told in double time with young and with adult eyes:\n\n\"By eleven o'clock I had finished my assignments: rations from the coop store - the smelly yellowy big grained milchard; six chundus of it at two per coupon, sugar; brown sticky and smelling faintly like stale bees' honey: three pounds of it, Dhal: the variety referred to as 'Mysoor parippu', fine-grained and pink and mistakenly believed to be coming from Mysore in India and boycotted under the orders of the JVP when the Indian Peace Keeping Force was alleged to be raping girls in Jaffna in the late eighties until someone enlightened us that the dhal had nothing to do with India and was really 'Masoor Dhal' which came from Turkey...\"\n\nWe hold onto favourite books for reasons that are not universal. Each word and sentence in this one carried me into arms I'd been in before. No other book brings me as close to my lost self. It is a lost classic for me, too, because of this book's quick fate. Published in Sri Lanka by a small press, it has so far not been published anywhere else. It was a story written far from the publishing centres of the West, and there it remains, still lost to the rest of the world.\n\n© Michael Ondaatje, 2000. Forbidden Territory, Sri Lanka, 1988. ISBN 955-96434-0-1, priced 200 rupees.\n\nEdmund White\n\nThe story of Harold by Terry Andrews\n\nThis is one of the strangest books I've ever read, probably because it combines elements that have never before or since appeared together. When the book first came out in 1974 it created a minor sensation and then immediately sank out of sight, never to be reprinted, as far as I know.\n\nCertainly it is now out of print. \"Terry Andrews\" is apparently a pen name and though I once heard the real name of the author (someone who in fact was a celebrated children's book writer of the period), I've since forgotten it and I understand he is long since dead. The novel is recounted by a first-person narrator, named \"Terry\", who is a New York children's book author who penned an instant classic, The Story Of Harold, which he reads frequently to a group of kiddies.\n\nHarold is a minuscule man who wears a checked vest and a bowler hat, possesses minor magic powers that can change some things but not all, and writes spontaneous poems that sometimes work as spells. Terry is a hard-drinking, sadistic, death-infatuated bisexual who is a star of the wife-swapping orgy circuit, who has a respectable girlfriend, Anne, and who has two main boyfriends.\n\nOne is Jim Whittaker, a handsome, cold-hearted egotist, a pushy masochist who drops in on Terry whenever he feels like a roughing up. He's eager to be manhandled and thrashed - but no marks, please, since he must go home to his wife and six children. His children, of course, are all enormous Harold fans, and Terry gets invited to the Whittakers' for Thanksgiving so that he will fill the kids in on still-unpublished episodes in Harold's adventurous life. Harold's biggest admirer is Jim's handsome, blind son, Ben.\n\nAlthough Terry is profoundly in love with Jim, Jim is abundantly clear about his own basic indifference to Terry - a friend, hot sex, nothing more. Terry's other \"slave\" is Dan Reilly, a \"fire freak\" who wants Terry to handcuff him to a stake and burn him alive; in fact, Dan has bought an isolated little house in the suburbs just so this erotic death can be accomplished in privacy. And Dan has carefully constructed his funeral pyre in anticipation of Terry's visit (he's even thoughtfully provided the matches).\n\nThat's what I mean by an unusual (unprecedented) combination of elements. The narration, in the form of Terry's diary, alternates among accounts of an evening with Anne at the opera (Die Frau Ohne Schatten), a cozy luncheon at the museum between Terry and Jim Whittaker's wife (during which they discuss Jim's human failings), an acrobatic evening with the swingers (the year is 1974, after all), an evening of beating and cigarette burns with Dan Reilly, a hearty, friendly exchange with Terry's loveable cleaning lady...\n\nStrangest of all are the scenes with Bernard, an impossible, unloveable lump of a little boy whose mother has begged Terry to spend some time with him every so often. Bernard loves only one thing in the world, The Story Of Harold, and Terry is able to encode life lessons for Bernard in further tales of the tiny figure. Even more bizarrely, Terry talks about the perverted corners of his own nocturnal life in the twee terms of a children's story. There are faults in this book - it's about fifty pages too long, it has a sentimental ending, the tone seldom strays from an exalted, almost giddy despair.\n\nBut it is a fearless performance. The narrator's tone (derived, one suspects, from Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) smoothly negotiates its way through all the motley elements. And though \"Terry\" is a bisexual and a shockingly far-out sadist, nevertheless this novel is the earliest document that renders the feel of Downtown Village gay life in the 1970s - the mix of high culture and perverse sex, the sudden transformation, say, from a night at the opera to an early morning at the baths, the bohemian indifference to bourgeois comfort or even cleanliness, the Sade-like conviction that sexual urges are to be elaborated rather than psychoanalysed, a complete silence regarding national politics (one would never know this novel was written in the last throes of the Vietnam war), and an enthralled focus on personal destiny. The gym is already a part of the single man's life, as is the apartment that is little more than a trick pad. And a life of sex does not in any way preclude a nearly Wagnerian passion (for Jim Whittaker):\n\n\"He genuinely loves his wife. At least he must, the amount of sex they make together. He's told me about that, and doesn't lie. (God, I wish that one time he had!) In fact - all you my witnesses - he's described their married life in intimate detail. Among other pleasures on the mental rack, I've been made a confidant... And he simply adores his kids. I'd like him for that. If there were any seashore left in the storm of emotions I felt for him.\n\n\"I'd say I'd like him - but the truth within the truth is I love him just for that! The fact that he is an excellent father, a pretty good husband - despite how much he fucks around - those things are what allure me most - they've magnetised me like iron toward his life: the things that make it impossible for me to be anything at all except some casual sex for him...\n\nTerry Andrews - the living dildo, the living whip - that's me!\" All the stylistic tricks are here - the voice that interrupts and corrects itself, the demotic-hieratic vocabulary (\"fucks around\" in the same sentence with \"magnetised\"), the exclamations as asides in parentheses buried in an otherwise matter-of-fact sentence. This is the voice of the first gay liberation generation: romantic and sexual, unguilty and explicit, non-judgmental and appreciative, grittily urban and, at the same time, operatic and verging on hysterical self-dramatising. To me, The Story Of Harold is a remarkable period piece that reminds us that the 1970s was a period far more sophisticated and humane than our own © Edmund White, 2000.\n\nThese essays are extracted from Lost Classics, edited by Michael Ondaatje, Michael Redhill, Esta Spalding and Linda Spalding, published by Bloomsbury on March 5, at £14.99.
