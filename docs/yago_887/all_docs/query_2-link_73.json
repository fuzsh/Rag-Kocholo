        "text": "Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once or twice daily. It may be prescribed 4 times a day for some conditions. If you are taking this medication once daily, it is usually taken after the evening meal or before bedtime.\n\nThe dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition and response to treatment. In children, dosage may also be based on body weight. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. You may take other medications (such as antacids) for your condition as recommended by your doctor.\n\nTake this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same time(s) each day. Do not increase your dose or take it more often than prescribed. Do not stop taking this without your doctor's approval because this may delay healing of the ulcer.\n\nIf you are using nonprescription ranitidine for self-treatment of acid indigestion or heartburn, take 1 tablet by mouth with a glass of water as needed. To prevent heartburn, take 1 tablet by mouth with a glass of water 30-60 minutes before eating food or drinking beverages that cause heartburn. Do not take more than 2 tablets in 24 hours unless directed by your doctor. Do not take for more than 14 days in a row without talking with your doctor.\n\nTell your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens."
