Visit Ticket Center the day of the screening to reserve your spot!\n\nAbout the film:\n\nA young boy named Luke and his grandmother go on vacation only to discover their hotel is hosting an international witch convention, where the Grand High Witch is unveiling her master plan to turn all children into mice. Will Luke fall victim to the witches’ plot before he can stop them? Based on the outrageous tale from master storyteller Roald Dahl.\n\n“Kids want scaring and “The Witches” knows how to scare ’em good. But not so much they wake up screaming, and not so little they start going sproing-sproing-sproing in their seats.”\n\n—Desson Thomson for The Washington Post\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nNicolas Roeg was an English film director and cinematographer, best known for directing Walkabout (1971), Don’t Look Now (1973), The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) and Bad Timing (1980).\n\nMaking his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg quickly became known for an idiosyncratic visual and narrative style, characterized by the use of disjointed and disorienting editing. For this reason, he is considered a highly influential filmmaker, cited as an inspiration by such directors as Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan, and Danny Boyle.\n\nMore From Book to Film See our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
