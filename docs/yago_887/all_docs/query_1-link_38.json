        "text": "IN ''Scrubbers,'' her portrait of a\n\nBritish reformatory for delinquent young women, the director Mai Zetterling accomplishes at least one of her objectives: dramatizing this potentially lurid material without resorting to the usual forms of exploitation. If ''Scrubbers'' avoids tawdry sexism, though, it has a viciousness that comes close to being exploitation of a different variety.\n\nThe ugliness of life in this Borstal is depicted graphically, from the fist fights to the obscenities to the daily ritual of emptying chamber pots. This may suggest a film of uncompromising toughness, but ''Scrubbers'' also has its sentimental side. One of the film's key characters is the feisty Annetta (Chrissie Cotterill), an inmate who pines incessantly for the child from whom she has been separated. Miss Zetterling is not beyond making explicit madonna-and-child allusions in a sequence that shows Annetta trying to visit her little girl.\n\n''Scrubbers,'' which opened yesterday at the Film Forum, is compelling all the same. Focusing on two young runaways who land inside a high-security institution, it explores all the rituals of reformatory life. One inmate sings filthy ditties from dawn to dusk, since this is the only form of subversion that remains available to her. Others flaunt their sexuality defiantly, and form attachments with one another by passing cigarettes and love letters after curfew. Carol (Amanda York), the other young newcomer, is befriended by the lesbian Eddie (Kate Ingram), who's so tough that she can cut in front of the others, when they're lined up for the bathroom, merely by crooking her thumb. Eddie offers Carol protection, and Carol, as a demonstration of loyalty, has Eddie's name tattooed on her breast.\n\nMiss Zetterling, having assembled a strong cast of newcomers (the only familiar face is that of Elizabeth Edmonds, who starred in ''Experience Preferred . . . but Not Essential''), puts them through paces that alternate between extreme violence and contrivance. A neatly composed shot of the young women assembling doll parts in a factory, for instance, speaks all too blatantly of their frustration. And a final showdown, as two young inmates square off in a kitchen full of boiling cauldrons, is so conspicuously choreographed that its impact is blunted. ''Scrubbers'' is at its best when it avoids the cliches that grow almost automatically from this material."
