        "text": "WELCOME TO MAI ISSUE ONE\n\nDearest MAI Readers,\n\nWhen we started this journal in summer 2017, we couldn’t have anticipated the support and enthusiasm with which this project has been greeted. Some of you may know of the Swedish actress and film director Mai Zetterling, but many of you will never have heard of her. She’s extremely important to us – a feminist spirit guide of sorts – and we believe she deserves a collective founded in her name!\n\nThis is an attempt to form a journal worthy of her feminist, experimental and ground-breaking work; to that end, the intention of MAI is to give voice to those who often find themselves, like Mai Zetterling herself, unable to fit within the confines and strictures of the institutions so many of us inhabit; to bring creative work into dialogue with scholarship; and more than anything, to challenge those hegemonic, patriarchal structures that bind us and prevent us from growing.\n\nOur creative ideas for this journal would not have come to fruition without the dedicated web team who have helped to create a platform for us to share interdisciplinary and intersectional work engaging with a range of visual cultures. We have been strengthened and heartened to see how MAI has brought so many people together from a range of backgrounds to contribute to this conversation – we are, first and foremost, a collaborative effort. This journal would not even have reached issue one without the tireless work of the editorial board. Every single day, we are reminded that we, as feminists, are nothing individually without solidarity and communication.\n\nThis issue is our first and it is exemplary of how we would like to continue: here, you will find video essays alongside scholarly articles, poetry alongside short films, reviews alongside personal engagement with artworks; photographic work alongside collages. The common thread that all these pieces share is a radical personal engagement with art from a feminist perspective. MAI does not value one form of thinking over any other: we welcome considered, empathic engagement that is as varied as human beings are. We adore the use of I, the acknowledgement of limitations, vulnerabilities, perspective and subjectivity. Above all, our aim is to produce collaboration and dialogue from the way in which the journal is structured and run to each particular issue and how it comes to exist in this world. Feminism is an action that is performed in collaboration in the world: it is not some abstruse, abstract form of thinking. We honestly believe that feminism can make this world a far better place for many people.\n\nCentral to MAI as a publication is open access as an ethical principle. We believe that feminist engagement is the domain of everyone: not just the privileged few behind the walls of institutions with access to academic libraries. We believe that the onus should never be on the writer/artist/poet/filmmaker to pay to make their own work accessible to all. We are entirely against this exploitative model of academic publishing and we are here to be the change that we want to see in the world.\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported us thus far: we could not and would not be doing this without you! It is our intention to grow from here, to listen, to collaborate, to celebrate the work of feminists everywhere.\n\nPlease dig in to MAI Issue One.\n\nAnna Backman Rogers & Anna Misiak\n\nMay 2018"
