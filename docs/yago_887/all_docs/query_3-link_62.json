        "text": "Permanent History of Women Filmmakers:\n\nMai Zetterling\n\nThe ‘Permanent History of Women Filmmakers’ series has enabled us, edition after edition, to discover or rediscover the works of, among others, the Ukrainian Soviet director Larissa Shepitko, the American Dorothy Arzner, the Italian Lina Wertmüller, and the Japanese Kinuyo Tanaka. This year's festival will focus on the work of Swedish director Mai Zetterling. In the early 1960s, after having made two films for Ingmar Bergman and spent part of her career in England, she made the choice to become a filmmaker. Initially, she produced ethnographic documentaries financed by the BBC, then went on to direct a short film that won a prize at the Venice Film Festival. She subsequently signed her first feature film, Loving Couples, magnificently lit by Sven Nykvist and presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 1965. From the outset, Mai Zetterling established a straightforward and powerful voice, whose audacity shocked some viewers, and created an œuvre devoted primarily to the study of the female condition. She went on to direct six feature films, including Night Games and The Girls, and made contributions to collective films. She directed Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson and others.\n\nIn collaboration with the Swedish Film Institute, who restored all the films of the retrospective.\n\nFilms presented"
