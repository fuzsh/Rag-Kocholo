        "text": "Epistolary novel by Hjalmar Söderberg\n\nFor the films based on the novel, see Doctor Glas (1942 film) and Doctor Glas (1968 film).\n\nDoctor Glas is a 1905 epistolary novel by Hjalmar Söderberg which tells the story of a physician in 19th-century Sweden who deals with moral and love issues.\n\nThe novel is about Dr. Tyko Gabriel Glas who is a respected physician in Stockholm. The story is told in the form of a diary and follows Doctor Glas as he struggles with depression. The antagonist is Reverend Gregorius, a morally corrupt clergyman. Gregorius' beautiful young wife confides in Dr. Glas that her sex life is making her miserable and asks for his help. Glas falls in love with her and agrees to help even though she already has another lover. He attempts to intervene, but the Reverend refuses to give up his \"marital rights\" – she must have sex with him whether she likes it or not. So, in order to make his love happy, he begins to plot her husband's murder. The novel also deals with issues such as abortion, women's rights, suicide, euthanasia, and eugenics. Not surprisingly, the book triggered a violent campaign against its author who was subsequently vilified in Swedish literary circles.\n\nIn 1963, the first English edition of this novel was published. It featured an introduction by author William Sansom.\n\nIn 2002, the latest edition was published by Anchor Books with an introduction by Canadian author Margaret Atwood.\n\nA new translation by Rochelle Wright was published by Counterpoint in 2015.\n\nIn 2004, Swedish author Bengt Ohlsson wrote a book named Gregorius using Söderberg's character Gregorius and expanded upon his background, explaining why he has become so morally corrupt when readers meet him in Doctor Glas.\n\n1942: a black-and-white Swedish adaptation directed by Rune Carlsten\n\n1968: a Danish adaptation directed by Mai Zetterling"
