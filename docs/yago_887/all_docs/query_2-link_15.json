        "text": "Glass is a shattering disappointment and a monumental artistic misfire from one of my favorite filmmakers. It is, at least, a testament to my belief that Unbreakable needed no sequel. If that majestic superhero origin-as-mid-life-crisis drama was too early to cash in on the zeitgeist (which is, to be fair, part of what made it stand out all of these years), then this continuation is (at best) a decade too late. It adds little of value to its predecessors, offers nothing in terms of in-the-now commentary on its genre and actively pollutes the carefully constructed mythology. It is so focused on plot turns and story twists that it mostly loses sight of its characters. It plays like an inadequate (and underfunded) fanfiction sequel to Unbreakable and a meta-parody of a stereotypical late-2000s M. Night Shyamalan miss.\n\nThings get off to a decent enough start, as we realize that the “rescue the kidnapped cheerleaders” beat is the opening scene rather than the climax. Taking place just a few weeks after the events of Split, we open with a still-in-action David Dunn (Bruce Willis) going on periodic crime-fighting patrols while attempting to discover the new hiding place of “The Horde” (James McAvoy). We get a few notable story updates (including one for Anya Taylor-Joy’s Casey that would have better served as the end of Split) and then a confrontation between The Horde and, uh, The Overseer. Both the hero and the villain captured and end up under the psychological care of Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson). She insists that these super-powered folks are suffering from a delusion that makes them think they are comic book characters.\n\nIt is here the movie quickly drowns. We go on to spend much of what remains with Paulson monologuing that David and Kevin aren’t super-powered creatures, with Shyamalan never realizing that this is entirely irrelevant to the story. To the extent that, in a civil society, David should/shouldn’t beat up bad guys or Kevin should/shouldn’t kidnap and eat teen girls, it does not matter if they are real-life comic book characters or suffering from specific mental ailments. I cannot overstate the miscalculation of this particular storytelling emphasis. We spend much of the movie with the hero and the villain being convinced that they aren’t what we know they are. We know what we saw them do in the last two movies and couldn’t care less “why” David and Kevin are able to do what they clearly can do.\n\nNo spoilers, but Samuel L. Jackson’s Elijah is somewhat out-of-the-picture until he’s not, and Bruce Willis (shockingly) gives another sleepwalking performance, to the point where the movie feels edited around him. Title notwithstanding, a sequel to Unbreakable should be at least partially about David Dunn and the legacy of his choices, yet he has little to say or do of value. McAvoy gets plenty of screen time (and, again, he's wonderful), but it’s mostly scenes of him bouncing between his 23 personalities. But moments barely click beyond recognition since he’s locked up and not technically a danger. Casey shows up mostly to play out a weird and lazy “beauty can tame the beast” arc with her former kidnapper, while Spencer Treat Clark (returning as David’s admiring son) is mostly irrelevant to the overall narrative.\n\nDr. Staple barely does any real “work” in terms of talking to her patients (the how’s and why’s of her treatment are glossed over), and she pales in comparison to Betty Buckley’s empathetic shrink from Split. Moreover, it exists in the “real world” of Unbreakable and Split and yet applies the kind of halfhearted and inexplicable sort of fantasy logic that wouldn’t fly in any halfway respectable comic book story. The only thing I’ll say about the second half is that, yes, Elijah does eventually come back into the picture, and it’s clear that Jackson enjoys playing this character again. No details, but the final act focuses on arbitrary reveals and empty confrontation (think Heroes) which forgets that the appeal of comic books is not the plot or the action but the character melodrama.\n\nWe waste an entire movie watching a shrink trying to convince our comic book characters that they aren’t comic book characters (while constantly repeating story beats from the first two movies), at the expense of new journeys for David, Kevin and Elijah whom we wanted to see… actually being superheroes and supervillains (or at least interacting with the world). Not unlike Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, it sacrifices character interaction for the sake of setting up “here’s what it was all about” reveals that don’t justify the wasted time and betray a misconception about why the previous films worked in the first place. And it all ends with… no spoilers, an unsatisfying wrap-up that actively lessens the re-watchability of the movies that came before it. It can’t even cash the check it attempts to write.\n\nAs a theoretical third act to a single superhero melodrama written 20 years ago, the story beats that make up Glass might have worked. To be fair, it would also have been potentially more effective 15 years ago before real-world superhero movies became, partially thanks to Unbreakable, a genre unto themselves. The plot beats and consequences would also make more sense in 2003 versus 2019. But as a stand-alone movie (or a sequel to two previous movies), it is a narrative failure all-but-sure to annoy those most excited for this film. Because it retroactively damages one of Shyamalan’s best movies (as well as one that, while not among my favorites, has its fans), it is his worst major studio feature. At least fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender can still watch the Nickelodeon cartoon and can forget about the live-action botch.\n\nGlass is so tragically misguided, so bereft of character that it may be a sign that perhaps The Visit was a fluke. Maybe the Shyamalan who struck gold 20 years ago never came back after he parted ways with Disney over story notes given for Lady in the Water. With Glass, which proves that he indeed shouldn’t have returned to the world of Unbreakable, he entirely loses sight of his characters, his skewed balance of compassion and malice, his quirky dialogue and the real reasons (not just the plot twists) that he became a household name in the first place. For years we all thought that Shyamalan had lost his storytelling mojo. But now it appears that he may have lost his empathy and compassion. And if that is the case, he may have lost me as well."
