        "text": "Dr. Simon Glass is a psychologist under employment with the SCP Foundation. He is the head of psychology at Site-17, and is responsible for conducting psychological evaluations both on personnel and contained entities.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSCP-781[]\n\nDr. Glass worked with SCP-781, a man who manifests his own nightmares when he sleeps, and provided an evaluation log of him detailing his psychological to emotional states all the way until he killed Dr. ██████. After this, Glass was promoted.[1]\n\nAlternate realities[]\n\nYesterday[]\n\nAfter a worldwide containment breach in 2020, Simon Glass was targeted by Dr. Alto Clef on the orders of O5-12 Troy Lament in order to satisfy the Bloom's activation procedures. Clef orchestrated Glass' death by having a mentally unwell agent murder him.[2]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nSimon Glass has a softness for humanoid SCP objects, while that is uncommon for SCP Foundation personnel due to their usual cold and calculating nature, he has been proven fit to work for the Foundation. Dr. Glass is also very empathetic. He feels self-conscious about how the higher-ups think about his connections to various GOIs\n\nAttributes[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAccording to the creator, Simon Glass is pansexual.[3]\n\n[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nEntry Page: 963\n\nEntry Page: 353\n\nDr Glass' Personnel File\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nGame Day, Phase 1: Secure\n\nIn His Own Image: Part 2\n\nIn His Own Image: Interlude 3\n\nIn His Own Image: Part 6\n\nIn His Own Image: Part 7\n\nEntry Page: 1985\n\nShowtime\n\nYesterday\n\nTemporal Site-01 (RCT-Δt Hub)\n\nThe Children of the Scarlet King Hub"
