        "text": "When life tosses you to the side like a doll after years of being taught to act content and keep everything to yourself, you'll inevitably break. Don't be afraid to admit that you've broken, because it's only then that you can piece yourself back together. Your sense of self shouldn't be defined by someone who thinks they own you, so break away from the shackles of gender norms to find yourself.\n\nA foreboding yet illuminating look into how a maried woman's life disintegrates once her husband reveals that he's in love with another girl and how family and society at large try and, for all intents and purposes, fail to connect with her as she goes through the most primal stages of grieving. All this is done as she watches over her past with the same withdrawn disconnect.\n\nMoms across the world and across time basically pass around one piece of paper with the same script on it for when their daughter gets broken up with\n\nIntimate, and experimental film about a woman going through a divorce in which heartbreak is presented as a pathology. Impossible to forget, when you see the brutal breakdown scene here, that she was set to write a monograph on The Passion of Joan of Arc before she died in 1994.\n\n\"She wanted to be born dead.\n\nLeave the world unknowingly.\n\nWithout a trace. Just wiped out.\n\nShe wanted to erase this birth, which was just a mistake.\n\nThe result of a random meeting between two bodies\"\n\nI got multiple goosebumps just from watching this.\n\ncouldn't pay much attention unfortunately due to circumstances mostly outside my control so i won't fully critique -- I'll focus on the good. mai paints her most visceral picture, one of hate & decay & grief. beautiful yet fragmented, hard to take all in, but it's absolutely her most singular film. to self (?) destruct."
