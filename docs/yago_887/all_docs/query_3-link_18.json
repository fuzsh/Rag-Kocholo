Her peerless ability to render subjective psychological states with startling immediacy is on display in LOVING COUPLES, NIGHT GAMES, and THE GIRLS—three provocative, taboo-shattering works from the 1960s featuring some of Swedish cinema’s most iconic stars. With their audacious narrative structures that fuse reality and fantasy, their elaborate use of metaphor and symbolism, and their willingness to delve into the most fraught realms of human experience, these movies are models of adventurous, passionately engaged filmmaking.",
