Mai Zetterling (born May 24, 1925, Västerås, Sweden—died March 15?, 1994, London, England) was a Swedish actress, director, and novelist. As a director, she imbued her work with a passionate feminism.

Zetterling was trained for the stage and made both her stage and screen debut in 1941 when she was 16 years of age. In 1944 she appeared in Alf Sjöberg’s film Hets (Torment, or Frenzy). Ingmar Bergman wrote the script for Hets, and critics consider it the beginning of a new period in Swedish filmmaking.
