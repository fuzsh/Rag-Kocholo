You know from time to time you just get cranky? For no reason, just get cranky. One of the little crazy things I made a deal with myself when I started Woody Boater was to go with the mood I was in at the time. be open and try not to pretend. Now normally 99.9% of the time, I can see the humor in about anything. Yes I am one of those. “too soon” people. Maybe it’s how I cope with life. Humor to me is life.

And for some odd reason, from time to time. I can feel my teeth starting to clinch and jaw gets sore, and just want to sit in a dark room and listen to John Prime, or Opera. Yup. For some very odd reason Opera calms me down. The sound track to The Mission is always good, although a tad cliche these days cause of all the coffee commercials made with it. Enya used to help, but after a while I just wanted to burn all those tapes, Cd’s UGH.. Really? Now MP3’s and soon the music will be somehow emplanted in my brain so after I die it still plays. BTW, thats hell BTW.

Anyway, I can feel the bitterness starting to slip back in. I NEED A BOAT RIDE! By myself, or with the Boatress and Mr B. Thats it. OH wait. I need to varnish, paint and get that electrical thing fixed I have procrastinated on all winter on Sweet Pea. GRRRRRRRR…….
