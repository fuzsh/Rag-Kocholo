        "text": "Welcome back to The Rundown, our daily breakdown on news stories we missed from the previous day. Have a link to share? Email me at david@multiversitycomics.com.\n\n– Do you want an inside look at Paul Giamatti’s The Rhino from The Amazing Spider-Man 2? I sure hope you’re ready for a laugh, because Giamatti raging in a weird nuclear mega helmet/shoulder pad contraption (which, I’d wager, is a CGI stand-in) is pretty damn hilarious. Have set pictures ever done anything for superhero movies besides make them look insanely stupid? Not really.\n\n– So Quantum & Woody from James Asmus, Tom Fowler and Jordie Bellaire is rapidly approaching, and to build excitement for it, Valiant is now releasing weekly one-pager comics over at IGN. While I’m a little sore that we weren’t chosen to unveil these beauties, it does give me a ton of hope that this comic will in fact be as great as the original series. Check it out!\n\n– Both the Beat and Robot 6 took different tracks in interpreting Brandon Graham’s recent Tumblr post talking about his experience working on the House of Mystery Halloween Special. Neither of those things really amused me, as anyone who knows anything about Graham knows that working for the Big Two is just not something he looks to do because they don’t align whatsoever from a storytelling/comic booking standpoint (and, as he said on Twitter, he’s not a fan of their treatment of creators).\n\nHowever, Graham’s response was pretty fun to watch, as a comic creator got a little bit of the he said/she said treatment of pro athlete’s and actually had to reinterpret on Twitter what he said so the wrong ideas didn’t gain traction. Not saying either the Beat or R6 badly reported things (or do so traditionally, and Graham said The Beat handled it well here), but as per usual, unless it’s from the horse’s mouth, take news you hear second or third hand with a grain of salt.\n\n– In other news, I’m awesome.\n\n– Craig Mahoney has created a painting of grown up Calvin going back to his old best friend Hobbes. A great piece, but hardly the inducement of tears that the Huffington Post articles makes it seem like. I may be a robot though."
