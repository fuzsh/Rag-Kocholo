        "text": "It was quite the scene at the Lafayette Regional Airport on Friday as 99-year-old World War II veteran and pilot Joe Sciarra arrived, accompanied by stars from popular soap operas \"The Young & the Restless\" and \"The Bold & the Beautiful.\" While the soap opera celebrities were undoubtedly a draw, it was Sciarra who stole the show, receiving a hero's welcome from servicemen and women eager to express their gratitude.\n\nAs Sciarra and the soap opera stars exited the jet bridge into the terminal, they were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd. The Lafayette Regional Airport's Facebook page captured the heartwarming moment in a video showing the visibly moved Sciarra, almost shocked by the warm reception from the many people waiting for his arrival.\n\nAmong the soap opera stars were Eric Braeden (Victor Newman), Christian LeBlanc (Michael Baldwin), and Bryton James (Devon Hamilton) from \"The Young & the Restless,\" as well as Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke Logan), Kimberlin Brown (Sheila Carter), and Supervising Producer Casey Kasprzyk from \"The Bold & the Beautiful.\"\n\nThey were in town for fundraising events hosted by The Little Big Cup.\n\nThe welcome was a touching tribute to Sciarra's service and a testament to how Laafayete views and respects its veterans. The event highlighted the unpredictability of who might fly into Lafayette at LFT, making for a special moment for all in attendance.\n\nThe Lafayette Regional Airport's Facebook caption summed it up perfectly: \"We were thrilled to welcome 99-year-old World War II veteran and pilot Joe Sciarra and daytime soap opera cast members from 'The Young & the Restless' and 'The Bold & the Beautiful' at Lafayette Regional Airport! Thank you for flying LFT!\"\n\nWe thank Mr. Sciarra for his service and hope he enjoys his time in Cajun Country."
