        "text": "Quotes\n\n\"If that guy had something to do with our friends vanishing, then he's our problem too.\"\n\n—Woody, deciding to help Sora\n\nWoody is a toy based on a sheriff from Toy Box who is a party member in Kingdom Hearts III. He originated in the Disney/Pixar film Toy Story.\n\nDevelopment[edit]\n\nThe proposal folder shown to Buena Vista included plans for a world based on Toy Story in the original Kingdom Hearts. For Kingdom Hearts II a model of Buzz Lightyear and Woody were created for a similar purpose but according to the series' director Tetsuya Nomura, there was never a chance to present them to Disney so the idea was scrapped.[1] Both the world and the characters finally made their appearance in Kingdom Hearts III as party members in Toy Box.\n\nStory[edit]\n\nKingdom Hearts III[edit]\n\nAlong with his friends Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Hamm, the Little Green Men, and the Green Army Men, Woody is taken away from his owner Andy and trapped in a replicated version of his world by Young Xehanort to experiment on the nature of their hearts. Woody joins his fellow toys on Andy's bed, as they prepare to take on the intruders that have appeared in Andy's room. They plan to spring upon the intruders on Woody's count; however, Buzz stops his friends, as three new toys, Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy, have shown up.\n\nThe trio defeat the Heartless and introduce themselves. Buzz, suspicious of the newcomers, demands Sora tell him where he had fought the Heartless before. However, his interrogation is stopped by the others, who believe Sora, Donald, and Goofy to be Andy's newest toys. They plan to search Galaxy Toys for Young Xehanort.\n\nAt Galaxy Toys, Young Xehanort appears and summons Heartless to pilot the Gigas toys against Sora. The toys are split up and Woody helps to reunite everyone. Once all of the toys are recovered, they decide it is time for them all to return home. However, before they can leave, Young Xehanort appears once more, summoning a Marionette to possess Buzz, whose heart had been weakened by fear and doubt. Buzz turns his laser on Woody and attacks. Though Goofy, Donald, and Rex try to stop him, he disappears into a Corridor of Darkness.\n\nSora and the others track down another dark corridor in the toy store, finding Buzz inside trapped in a column of darkness. Young Xehanort muses on the darkness in Buzz's heart, but Woody responds by describing the love between the toys and Andy. His connection to Buzz breaks the darkness trapping him. The darkness takes the form of the King of Toys, but Buzz regains his senses and helps Sora defeat it. Though the toys remain trapped in the alternate world for the time being, they remain hopeful of seeing Andy again and do not regret the chance to meet Sora and his friends, who have become a part of their hearts.\n\nSome time after Master Xehanort's defeat, Woody is seen with the other toys in Andy's room as the door finally opens with Andy's return.\n\nDesign[edit]\n\nWoody is a thin ragdoll-style toy with a plastic head, hands, and boots. He has pale skin, brown eyes, and brown hair, over which he wears a brown plastic cowboy hat. He wears a red-patterned yellow shirt with folded cuffs and silver buttons under a black and white cow-skin vest on which his sheriff badge is pinned. He wears dark blue denim pants with a brown belt and gun holster buckled with an ovular tan buckle, and brown boots with tan spurs. There is a red bandanna tied around his neck, and a white ring on his back, attached a pull string. His arms and legs are stitched flat to give him elbows and knees. The name \"ANDY\" with a backwards \"N\" is written on the bottom of his right boot in black marker.\n\nPersonality[edit]\n\n\"Yeah, I am a toy. And a friend. My guess is no one's ever loved you before. Because you know NOTHING about hearts and love.\"\n\n—Woody to Young Xehanort\n\nWoody is a smart, determined, passionate, and loyal toy who would do anything for his nearest and dearest friends. He considers his friends as family and he tries his best to keep them together at all times. He is very attached to his friends and cares for their safety, especially Andy, his owner. His determination to find Andy was what led him to put his trust in Sora, Donald, and Goofy, far more than Buzz. Despite finding Young Xehanort splitting their world far-fetched, Woody is willing to give people the benefit of the doubt, even reminding Buzz of his own faults, such as when he believed he was a real space ranger.\n\nWhen upset, Woody is shown to be very stern, such as ordering Young Xehanort to return Buzz to normal, then to get lost. This shows that he is willing to endure the hardest challenges without a hint of fear. Woody's bond with Andy and his friends is what allowed him to endure the darkness and free Buzz, stating that Young Xehanort is hollower than any toy. Hamm claims that Woody is always getting into trouble, showing that even he has his own faults.\n\nAbilities[edit]\n\nKingdom Hearts III[edit]\n\nWoody is an offense-focused physical attacker. His basic attacks consist of close-range punches. Both of his action abilities allow him to more easily close long distances between him and a target, with Shoulder Tackle bringing him to the enemy and Lasso Attack bringing the enemy to him. His Lasso Attack also stuns the enemy for 10 seconds, making him good at disabling enemies to setup for further damage. His weapon is Cowboy's Pride.\n\nAlongside Buzz Lightyear and Sora, Woody is able to use the Rocket Ruckus Team Attack, allowing the listed party members to mount the rocket from Toy Story and strike enemies with it before sending it at the enemies into an explosion of fireworks.\n\nWoody's base stats are 30 AP, 175 HP, and 100 MP. He has 2 armor slots, 2 accessory slots, and 3 item slots, two of which start equipped with Potions.\n\nActions Attack Attribute Power\n\nMultiplier Form\n\nValue Reaction\n\nValue Revenge\n\nValue Guard?

Outside of the films, he is voiced by Tom Hanks's brother Jim Hanks.\n\nIn the 1995 film, Woody is the beloved favorite toy of a boy named Andy. When Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and begins to spend more time with it than with Woody, Woody becomes jealous and fears he has been replaced by the space ranger toy. He attempts to hide Buzz from Andy, and in the process, he gets them both lost and in the possession of Sid, the toy-torturer who lives next door. In Sid's house, Woody finally admits his insecurities to Buzz and a friendship forms between them. They team up to escape Sid's house and manage to make it back to Andy before he leaves them behind in moving to a new house.\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nWoody's sprite.\n\nWoody's save portrait in the Save Point.\n\nWoody in the Kingdom Hearts III manga.\n\nNotes and references[edit]\n\nParty Playable characters Sora | Riku | Roxas | Mickey Mouse | Data-Sora | Terra | Ventus | Aqua | Lingering Will | Kairi | Player | Xehanort Mission Mode Xemnas | Xigbar | Xaldin | Vexen | Lexaeus | Zexion | Saïx | Axel | Demyx | Luxord | Marluxia | Larxene | Xion | Donald Duck | Goofy Party members Donald Duck | Goofy | Tarzan | Aladdin | Ariel | Jack Skellington | Peter Pan | Beast | Pluto | Mickey Mouse | Mulan | Auron | Jack Sparrow | Simba | Tron | Riku | Xigbar | Xaldin | Vexen | Lexaeus | Zexion | Axel | Demyx | Luxord | Marluxia | Larxene | Xion\n\nHercules | Cloud | Terra | Ventus | Aqua | Prince Phillip | Zack | Experiment 626 | Woody | Buzz Lightyear | Rapunzel | Eugene Fitzherbert | Sulley | Mike Wazowski | Marshmallow | Baymax | Eraqus | Hermod | Bragi | Urd | Vor\n\nDream Eaters Joint struggle characters Mickey Mouse | Riku | Aqua | Ventus | Lea | Kairi | Roxas | Xion | Sora Assistants Riku | Squall Leonhart | Cogsworth | Megara | Philoctetes | Pegasus | Queen Minnie | Captain Pete | Yuffie | Tifa | Cloud | Hercules | Mickey Mouse | Axel | Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather Escort characters Winnie the Pooh | Lumière | Mrs. Potts | Megara | Queen Minnie | Abu | Timon | Pumbaa | Tigger | Roo | Piglet | Eeyore | Cinderella | Jaq | Snow White | Boo Summons Simba | Genie | Dumbo | Bambi | Tinker Bell | Mushu | Cloud | Chicken Little | Stitch | Peter Pan | Meow Wow | Wreck-It Ralph | Ariel D-Links Terra | Ventus | Aqua | Cinderella | Snow White | Maleficent | Mickey Mouse | Zack | Experiment 626 | Peter Pan | Donald Duck | Goofy | Pete | Vanitas"
