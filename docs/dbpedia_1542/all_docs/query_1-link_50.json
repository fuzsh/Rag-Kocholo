        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nWe last updated the male version of this list (see the actress list here) just after Leonardo DiCaprio was finally crowned for The Revenant (2015) but it's time for some adjustments. What follows is a list of Oscar's 34 All Time Favorite Actors. The only brand new addition to the list is Anthony Hopkins who enters the exclusive club due to two new consecutive nominations (including this year's bid The Father) significantly changing his previous 4/1 record. But there are other big changes. Actors who improved their standing since the last update five seasons ago are Denzel Washington (up several notches and a tier due to Fences and Roman Israel Esq), Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio (up a handful of notches each due to recent nominations), Jeff Bridges and Al Pacino (up a couple of notches each), and Daniel Day Lewis (up a tier with that Phantom Thread nomination but the same numeric placement -- the higher up you go the harder it is to rise much after all). A handful of other men are getting very close to joining this club after recent Oscar favor, too.\n\nThis royal club is restricted to men with 5 or more nominations. Only the acting statistics are accounted for so George Clooney, for example, is not (yet) ranked...\n\nNow that many major stars are involved in producing these types of extra nominations stats are likely to make Oscar lists of the future progressively murkier so we're opting not to include them since this is a discussion of response to what happens in front of the camera by way of movie stars. (If you'd like to see how the ranks were determined --it's not as simple as basic addition or there would be way too many ties -- that's at the bottom of the post.)\n\nOSCAR'S FOUR KINGS\n\nAnd 30 other Royals\n\n01 Jack Nicholson 12 noms | 3 wins\n\n02 Laurence Olivier 10 Noms | 1 win | 2 honoraries\n\n03 Paul Newman 9 noms | 1 win | 2 honoraries\n\n04 Spencer Tracy 9 noms | 2 wins\n\n(Their counterpart queens in Oscar's enamored eyes: Streep, Hepburn, Davis)\n\nTHE PRINCES\n\n05 ðŸ”º Al Pacino 9 noms | 1 win\n\n06 Marlon Brando 8 noms | 2 wins\n\n07 Jack Lemmon 8 noms | 2 wins\n\n08 ðŸ”º Denzel Washington 8 noms | 2 wins\n\n09 Peter O'Toole 8 noms | 0 wins | honorary\n\n10 Dustin Hoffman 7 noms | 2 wins\n\n11 Robert De Niro 7 noms | 2 wins\n\n12 ðŸ”º Daniel Day-Lewis 6 noms | 3 wins\n\n(Similarly celebrated women: Bergman, Page, Fonda)\n\nDUKES\n\n13 ðŸ”º Jeff Bridges 7 noms | 1 win\n\n14 Robert Duvall 7 noms | 1 win\n\n15 ðŸ”º Tom Hanks 6 noms | 2 wins\n\n16 Michael Caine 6 noms | 2 wins\n\n17 Richard Burton 7 noms | 0 wins\n\n18 ðŸ”º Leonardo DiCaprio 6 noms | 1 win\n\n19 ðŸ”º Anthony Hopkins 6 noms | 1 win\n\n20 Gary Cooper 5 noms | 2 wins | honorary\n\n21James Stewart 5 noms | 1 win | honorary\n\n22 Gregory Peck 5 noms | 1 win | honorary\n\n(Similarly celebrated women: Audrey Hepburn, Amy Adams, Frances McDormand)\n\nCOUNTS, KNIGHTS, AND BARONS\n\n23 Fredric March 5 noms | 2 wins\n\n24 Sean Penn 5 noms | 2 wins\n\n25 Gene Hackman 5 noms | 2 wins\n\n26 Paul Muni 5 noms | 1 win\n\n27 Morgan Freeman 5 noms | 1 win\n\n28 Walter Brennan 4 noms | 3 wins\n\n29 Alec Guiness 4 noms | 1 win | honorary\n\n30 Charles Boyer 4 noms | 0 wins | honorary\n\n31 Anthony Quinn 4 noms | 2 wins\n\n32 Albert Finney 5 noms | 0 wins\n\n33 Arthur Kennedy 5 noms | 0 wins\n\n34 Warren Beatty 4 noms | 0 wins | honorary (his nominations in other categories more than double his acting haul making for a very unusual case since he's still primarily thought of as a movie star)\n\nWHO IS NEXT?\n\nWhat follows is NOT COMPREHENSIVE -- so don't complain that we missed anyone -- but merely a discussion prompt. Who is most likely to enter that very exclusive top 30+ to make it a top 40? Who will have to make due with the honors they've already received (which is of course far more than most actors ever could possibly dream of since even 1 nomination is a very very big deal and puts you in the history books)\n\nTantalizingly close to this list with 4 nominations...\n\nðŸ”ºChristian Bale, ðŸ”º Bradley Cooper, ðŸ”º Willem Dafoe, ðŸ”º Joaquin Phoenix, ðŸ”º Brad Pitt (...and though they haven't been nominated for acting in a while you never know: George Clooney, Ed Harris, William Hurt)\n\n3-timers that feel possible for a fourth...\n\nJavier Bardem, Russell Crowe, ðŸ”º Woody Harrelson, ðŸ”º Gary Oldman, ðŸ”º Viggo Mortensen, Edward Norton, ðŸ”º Mark Ruffalo\n\n2-Timers that feel possible for a third...\n\nðŸ”ºMahershala Ali, Benicio del Toro, ðŸ”º Adam Driver, ðŸ”º Ryan Gosling, Ethan Hawke, Jonah Hill, ðŸ”º Richard Jenkins, ðŸ”º Daniel Kaluuya, ðŸ”º Sam Rockwell, ðŸ”º Michael Shannon, and though they haven't been nominated in quite a while we can hope for Oscar comebacks for Michael Fassbender, Ralph Fiennes, and Jude Law since only two nominations for those careers feels vaguely cruel (hell, pointedly cruel in Fiennes case)\n\nOne nomination a long time ago. Seriously, when is the second one coming ?\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L Jackson\n\nExciting and very talented actors that have never been nominated. What would it take?\n\nChristopher Abbott, Jamie Bell, Colman Domingo, Idris Elba, Colin Farrell, Ben Foster, Hugh Grant, Kelvin Harrison Jr, Brian Tyree Henry, Nicholas Hoult, Oscar Isaac, Michael B Jordan, Barry Keoghan, Tracy Letts, James McAvoy, Ben Mendelsohn, Alessandro Nivola, Robert Pattinson, Dan Stevens, and Michael Stuhlbarg\n\nHow the ranks were determined. Number of nominations determines general placement. Once that's established wins are most important. In the event that someone has the same exact stats in nominations and wins, the tiebreaker factor in rank is that leading roles count more than supporting. If the tie stubbornly remains the tie is broken by endurance (how many years your nomination spread includes). Further mitigating factors: Three statues is so uncommon that it gives the actor a phantom extra nomination in terms of ranking (thus Daniel Day-Lewis is higher than he otherwise would be) but this phantom nomination only helps to determine relative rank and they may only vault over those who have not won competitive Oscars. Honorary statues give the actor a phantom extra boost with the same affect as an additional nomination or win (thus Paul Newman trumps Spencer Tracy) to be determined by the gate keeper yours truly. In the event that someone has multiple wins they may vault over the next immediate rivals if said rivals have never won a competitive Oscar (which is why a few people beat Richard Burton). Honorary statues also account for four nomination men like Sir Alec Guiness and Warren Beatty making the list which otherwise requires five nominations to enter.\n\nI love Sir Anthony, and I'm so glad he's here. What a fascinating career he's had. He's been turning in great performance for decades, and while it seemed his years of Oscar glory was in the 90s, I'm so glad he's back.\n\nI know he doesn't have the right number of noms, but I'd say Daniel Day Lewis is one of the kings, especially with his work to nomination ratio. However, I highly suspect he'll come out of retirement and win a fourth Oscar. He's too good, and gives the type of performances that the Academy, no matter the era, finds undeniable.\n\nNot sure if the Irishman was a true second-wind for Pacino or if it was a late-career honor. But, I think he'll back, especially with the new Gucci movie coming out. Hopefully, his commitment to Hunters season 2 is small/over with so he can focus more on films.\n\nDenzel seems primed for a third win. The fact that he was nominated for a box-office bomb, Roman J Israel, indicates that they really like him.\n\nHoffman would be able to rise, but with his own sexual abuse scandals and the Meryl Streep slap/groping reveal, I can't imagine he'll make his way back (though they invited Mel back so...).\n\nBale and Oldman will get fourth nominations. They're both in their prime Oscar decades. I think Bardem could do it. He has a lot of goodwill, and I wouldn't be surprised if he was 7th for Skyfall.\n\nDafoe kind of defies logic - like Keaton he keeps getting nominations throughout the years, even for unlikely projects. He'll land another nod, largely because critics love him and give him a nice boost.\n\n@Phillip H, Ben Mendolsohn won an emmy and was nominated for every season of his show.\n\nOf the younger generations, Kaluuya and Cooper feel like the most obvious to keep racking up nominations (Bale is a given).\n\nI'm not sure about Gosling. I think he's respected, but he works infrequently and even then intersperses a lot of commercial plays. He'll be nominated again, but there might be significant gaps of 5-10 years each time.\n\nEddie Redmayne (not mentioned here, even with two noms) is kind of unusual. Still fairly young but his type of sensitivity on-screen doesn't feel like something the Academy will bestow mass laurels upon.\n\nI think everyone respects Michael Shannon enormously but he's not chasing film success the way many actors do. His first love is the stage and he'll work with nobodies in film if his interest is struck. Also almost strictly a supporting player. But he's very much like Dafoe, so he might hit a hot period.\n\nI think once Oscar Isaac gets over the first nomination hurdle, he could become a perennial.\n\nNot discussed in the comments, but Adam Driver is a fascinating case. The next year seems like it could be his make-or-break (with Annette/Gucci/The Last Duel) in terms of how the industry views him. Everyone is aware of how talented he is, but there was definitely resistance for years from studios to cast him as a leading man. Is he competitive with Gosling? He also has quite a specific screen presence that the Academy might not want to over-award. It's really difficult to project with him. I have a friend who is convinced he could be the next Nicholson. I'm not quite there."
