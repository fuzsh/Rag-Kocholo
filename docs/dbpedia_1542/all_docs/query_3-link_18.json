        "text": "When the Body Says ‘No’ should be read by anyone who experiences chronic emotional stress. By reading the book, you will understand the impact of your inner world on your health. I read it, too, as recommended by my therapist when she learned that I used to clench my leg muscles as a response to stress painfully.\n\n‘Seek and ye shall find’, one of the great teachers said. The seeking itself is the finding since one can fervently seek only what one already knows to exist — Gabor Maté, When the Body Says ‘No’\n\nNote! Dr. Maté uses a lot of heavy medical terms, but the book is worth reading (granted, with a dictionary aside) because it helps you understand the impact of emotions on physical health. So, as a prerequisite for reading it, get a basic understanding of psychology and medical terms, at large."
