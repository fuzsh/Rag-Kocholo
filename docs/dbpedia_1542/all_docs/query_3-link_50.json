        "text": "If you are a fan of Toy Story, you know that Andy loves writing his name on the bottom of his toys as a way to prove that they are, well in fact, his.\n\nWell, (spoiler alert) at the end of Toy Story 3, Andy is getting ready to head off to college and he gives his toys to Bonnie because he knows she will love and take care of them while he is away. Because of this, since Andy is no longer Woody‚Äôs owner, Disney made a change to the latest version of their Woody doll for sale in the theme parks ‚Äî and fans are not happy.\n\nRelated: ‚ÄòToy Story‚Äô Fans Are Distraught Over Disney‚Äôs Latest Post\n\nSabrina (@sabrinafajardo0) took to TikTok to share a video of the latest Woody doll to be released in Disneyland, writing:\n\nYou know you‚Äôre old when the Toy Story toys at Disneyland say ‚ÄúBonnie‚Äù and not ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù.\n\n@sabrinafajardo0\n\nBye Andy üëãüèΩü•∫‚ô•Ô∏è #disneyland #toystory\n\n‚ô¨ Married Life ‚Äì Michael Giacchino\n\nRelated: Woody From ‚ÄòToy Story‚Äô Has a New Look at the Parks!\n\nOther Toy Story fans did not hesitate to share their feelings on this change as the TikTok video has gathered over 4,000 comments and nearly 400k views.\n\nNicolee M. commented:\n\nthat‚Äôs a crime\n\nAnd TikTok user Miku said something similar:\n\nthat is a crime, i am not okay\n\nKate voiced their opinion, writing:\n\nBonnie didn‚Äôt even appreciate him like Andy did\n\nAnd another user who goes by Sup said:\n\nIT SHOULD SAY ANDY. Bonnie didn‚Äôt care about Woody.\n\nIt makes sense as to why Disney made this change on the Woody doll as, again, Bonnie is technically Woody‚Äôs owner now and not Andy, but for everyone who grew up watching Toy Story, it is clear they aren‚Äôt okay with this change."
