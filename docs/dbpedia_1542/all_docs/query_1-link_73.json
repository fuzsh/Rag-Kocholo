        "text": "More thoughts on Mr. Television: Milton Berle had the reputation of hogging the spotlight, stealing scenes and insinuating himself into other acts. On his legendary variety show and in his stage shows that predated it, he would bring on great performers but rarely allow them to have the stage to themselves. The jugglers would only get to juggle a little before Uncle Miltie came bounding out in juggler garb to burlesque and make a shambles of their routine. \"It always had to be about him,\" George Burns once told me. \"If the bit wasn't about him, he made it about him.\"\n\nThis was not always done out of ego — or, if it was, it was also with the intent of making a better show. When criticized for the practice, Berle would get defensive. He'd argue that, by injecting himself into another performer's act, he kept that performer on stage longer than they would otherwise have remained, and gave them the status of co-starring with the star of the show. Given his rate of success, it's hard to argue that he was always — or even, usually — in the wrong.\n\nStill, he was an enormous glutton for attention. You know the joke about, \"The most dangerous place in the world is anywhere between So-and-So and a camera?\" The first time I ever heard it was at a lunch at the Friar's Club with a wonderful, now departed comedian-impressionist named George Kirby. Berle was the former \"Abbot\" of the Friar's — a kind of ceremonial grand poobah — and he'd still table-hop during mealtime and glad-hand everyone.\n\nHe was at our table when someone across the room whipped out a home video camera to record some sort of greeting to an absent friend. The greeting was not supposed to involve Mr. Berle but, like lightning, he sprinted over, got in the shot and did his famous \"walrus\" shtick, inserting a cigar under his upper lip like a tusk. Kirby shook his head, turned back to me and said, \"The most dangerous place in the world is anywhere between Milton and a camera.\" Indeed.\n\nA little later, Entertainment Tonight set up to tape a few interviews with the comedians present. Berle was first up and he proceeded to do something that I mentioned in my article here on Red Skelton; something almost every comedian of his generation seemed to do, given the chance. As the camera rolled, Berle talked about there being too much smut in comedy. \"I tell all the young comics, 'Don't work blue,' he lectured. \"If you have talent, you don't need four letter words and filth.\"\n\nThen the camera was turned off and Berle resumed what he'd been doing before the interview: Telling dirty jokes. The cleanest one I recall was the one about the newlyweds who sunbathed nude on their honeymoon. That night, the groom's privates were horribly sunburned so he went into the kitchen, took out a container of milk and plunged his member into it. His new bride wandered into the room, saw this and said, \"Oh! I always wondered how men fill those things.\" Uncle Miltie told the joke, then looked down at his lap and added, \"I'd need a dairy.\" (I almost played naïve — like I didn't get the reference — but I was afraid he'd show me what it meant.)\n\nEvery cast member of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World who's ever mentioned his name in interviews has spoken of his uncanny ability to always be the last one out of every shot, thereby maximizing his screen time. A TV director I once worked with told me a story that pertained to this ability…\n\nBerle kept adding words, adding lines to his part. He had this one long speech and every rehearsal, it got longer and longer, no matter how we told him to cut it down. Finally, we got into taping and it turned into an extended monologue. He simply would not not add all those extra words. So I figured, \"Well, I'll find some cuts in editing…you know, cut away from him right after the beginning, drop the whole middle, and then cut back to him for the last few, crucial lines.\" Well, I couldn't do that. I got into editing and that's when I realized what he did.\n\nDuring the speech, he took out a cigar, slowly unwrapped it and put it into his mouth. I couldn't cut the middle of the monologue out because then, the cigar would have appeared out of nowhere…and I couldn't cut the whole speech out because the last line or two were essential to the plot. So I had to leave the whole thing in, and I'm 100% convinced he knew exactly what he was doing. He knew I wanted to cut, he knew where I'd want to cut and he knew how to fix it so I couldn't cut.\n\nOkay, those are all negative or semi-negative stories. There are a lot of good things that ought to be said about Milton Berle, starting with the incredible number of performers who owed their careers to his help and encouragement. He even found talent on the street. One day, back when he was headlining at Loew's New York State Theater, he wandered between shows into a nearby arcade. There, a printer had a little set-up cranking out business cards and letterheads and he told Berle that he dabbled in joke-telling on the weekends. They became friends and Berle began steering the job offers he couldn't take to the printer, whose name was Henny Youngman.\n\nAnother time, also in his stage show days, Berle struck up a friendship with a kid who worked the counter at a luncheonette near the theater. The kid's name was Jack Gellman and he did impressions and pantomimes so well that Berle hired him and put him in his act…but not before changing his name to Jack Gilford. There are dozens of these tales.\n\nAnd he really did invent an awful lot of TV comedy, back at a time when both budgets and technology were pitiful. Part of his reputation as \"The Thief of Bad Gags\" came about because his show, The Texaco Star Theater, initially couldn't afford much in the way of writers. To fill that weekly hour, Berle dredged up every old routine he could remember and, in some cases, they were sketches and monologues that were more-or-less public domain among comedians, but in which some comics — perhaps jealous of his success — claimed proprietary interest.\n\nLater on, when the program's success kicked loose some funds, Berle began buying the rights to use some of the classic comedy sketches that had been written for Broadway revues. The material was properly bought and paid-for but some of the comedians who'd performed in those revues — Bert Lahr being the most vocal, Berle claimed — saw it as Milton stealing \"their\" signature routines. When I heard Berle talk of this — decades after Lahr and his other detractors were dead and buried — he still turned crimson over it. He said, \"I was the first guy on television to pay writers and to pay them well.\"\n\nI'm not certain that Berle was the first TV performer to pay writers but he was surely among the first…and he was the first to do so many things, including causing America to stay home and watch the tube. The surviving kinescopes of those broadcasts have not aged well — all the outrageous costumes, constant mugging and everyone breaking up. But this was state-of-the-art live television of the time: Berle was way ahead of what everyone else was doing. It wasn't sophisticated but it was easy to watch. (He always told the writers to make the jokes \"lappy,\" which meant to lay them in the viewers' laps.)\n\nAfter a few years of the Texaco program and a few successors, he established another \"first.\" He was the first performer to ever wear out his welcome on television. By the time he was knocked off the air — by Phil Silvers playing S/Sgt. Ernest T. Bilko — Berle had demonstrated that it was quite possible for America to tire of someone. He had plenty to do for the rest of his life — movies, clubs, guest shots, the occasional series, even some dramatic roles — but he never again reached the apogee he'd reached as Mr. Television. No one did.\n\nI'm writing all this quickly and off the top of my head. If I sound conflicted, I am. Like many of my generation, I never laughed that much at Milton Berle and there was a time when I wondered why this pushy guy was so revered. In time, I think I came to understand that it had to do with innovation and longevity, two qualities that are rarely found — at least, together — in the comedy stars who began in television. Milton Berle was of another era, already an established performer before he or anyone appeared on TV, forced to invent and reinvent in front of an entire nation. Fortunately, he was a master showman and more than equal to the task.\n\nThe few times I got to meet him, he was very nice to me and quite willing to dive into his uncanny memory and summon up anecdote after anecdote, most of them probably true, at least to some extent. All in all, I enjoyed being around the man. Of course, I never got between him and a camera.\n\nI suspect a lot of folks under the age of 60 respected Milton Berle — assuming they really knew who he was — not because he was funny but because he was first. He couldn't appear anywhere without someone (often, him) reminding us that he was Mr. Television, aka Uncle Miltie, aka The Man Who Invented TV Comedy. He spent his life in show business, commencing as a child actor being thrust into the spotlight by a pushy stage mother. He claimed to have been the kid who sold Charlie Chaplin a newspaper in Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914), though some film historians question that. Throughout his career, Berle had many great accomplishments but he always seemed to be claiming they were even greater — that is, when he wasn't telling people how large his penis was. I have no idea if that last brag was true but the others weren't that far wrong.\n\nHe was in show business almost from the time he could walk. He was a major headliner in vaudeville and a star on Broadway. He was the impetus for so many American households to scrape up the bucks to buy their first television machine. He was even, at times, as notorious a stealer of other comics' material as he joked he was.\n\nHe was at his best when he was playing straight for other comedians. On his sixties' TV show, the best segments came when he was heckled by a rude audience member named Sidney Spritzer — in reality, veteran burlesque comic Irv Benson. Spritzer would insult Berle relentlessly and stop him from performing. Eventually, they'd always get to this joke which I loved…\n\nSPRITZER\n\nYou're too close to the microphone.\n\nBERLE\n\nHow far should I be?\n\nSPRITZER\n\nYou got a car?\n\nAn old joke? Certainly. But one of the reasons Berle's material seemed so shopworn to many of us was that he'd been doing it for eons, and whole generations of comedians had helped themselves to it. (That particular Milton Berle Show didn't last long, by the way. In fact, when it was cancelled, Berle — probably with the aid of some writer — remarked, \"I've figured out how to end the Vietnam War. Just put in on ABC and it'll be gone in thirteen weeks.\")\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Berle on a couple of occasions, one of which is recounted in my article here on Henny Youngman. Another, which I just this second posted, is this article about a time I was poaching on the set of Love Boat. And, of course, he was one of the stars of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, which is mentioned, ad nauseum, on this site. One of these days, when a little more time has passed, I'll try and write up a few other stories I heard or observed that perhaps shape or cloud my admiration for the man. For now, I'll just say that he had a rich, wonderful life and probably no regrets, apart from the fact that he didn't outlive Bob Hope…or die a few days earlier, so they could have mentioned it on this year's Oscars.\n\nApril Fool's Day is next week and while I don't like most practical jokes, I do love witty, harmless gags. I'm remembering the first April Fool's Day after I'd gotten a modem and begun calling computer bulletin boards. This was before Al Gore invented the Internet. I logged into a B.B.S. I called once a week or so and there, in its \"announcements\" section was a serious, deadpan notice that due to complaints from callers, three regular users of the system — two unfamiliar names plus mine — were being banned for being obnoxious and offensive. I did a double-take that would have been considered overacting in a Ben Turpin movie and began pondering what I'd posted that could have ticked people off. Took me about ten seconds to realize that I'd been had; that the system was configured so that everyone saw their name as one of the three in the bogus announcement.\n\nOne of my favorite April Fool's Day gags was perpetrated by the Cartoon Network back in 1997. Rather than describe it myself, I'm going to quote verbatim, a squib from the daily fax report that was issued that day by the newspaper, Electronic Media. Here it is…\n\nThe Cartoon Network pulled its regularly scheduled programming in lieu of an April Fools' Day stunt. Since 6 a.m., the network has been repeating a single seven-minute short (Screwball Squirrel's Happy-Go-Nutty), along with occasional on-screen notices claiming the animated character has taken over the control room in an effort to have April 1 declared a national holiday. All fooling aside, the channel plans to resume normal programming at 6 PM — after the cartoon has run more than 140 times.\n\nThe stunt was, I thought, hysterical — the same cartoon over and over and over. They did not even rotate the five classic cartoons that Tex Avery directed of Screwy (sometimes known as Screwball) Squirrel. They ran the same one over and over and over and over. Even after it was apparent what they were doing, I found myself tuning in to Cartoon Network throughout the day, making sure they were still at it, and checking out the little announcements about the Screwy Squirrel hostage crisis.\n\nThey left all the promotional announcements and bumpers intact as per the schedule, so they'd announce, \"Coming up next — The Flintstones,\" and then they'd show Screwy Squirrel in Happy-Go-Nutty. Or they'd say, \"We now return to Thundercats\" and then they'd show Screwy Squirrel in Happy-Go-Nutty. For twelve hours straight. I found myself laughing, just at the sheer silliness of it all.\n\nSomeone at Cartoon Network has a great sense of humor and a hefty serving of guts. For the sake of a great gag, they ran the risk of outraging cable subscribers — and, indeed, judging from Internet postings, a few were incensed sufficiently to phone up the channel's headquarters in Atlanta. This did them no good, of course; all they got was a recorded announcement that said that they were doing their best to get Screwy out of the control room. Others called their local cable companies to report technical problems. At least one cable service out in the Valley began carrying the channel on the first of April. One wonders what those new viewers thought.\n\nBut I know what I thought: I thought it was brilliant. And, looking at the above report from Electronic Media, I wonder if Cartoon Network played a trick on them in a press release, or if no one at Electronic Media knows how to multiply. Even if you left out commercials and promo announcements — and they didn't — it would take a lot more than 12 hours to run a 7-minute cartoon 140 times. Either way, somewhere Tex was laughing his wings and/or ass off.\n\nOne more thought on the Oscars and then I'll shut up: I think there's a silly tendency to try to discuss \"The Vote\" as if all the voters were working towards one goal and with one motive; like they all got together in a big room to mark their ballots and said, \"Okay, it's time to make a racial statement. Everyone vote for Denzel and Halle, but we'll give Best Director to Ron Howard because we liked him when he was Opie!\" Amidst this morning's web chat about the event — including, what a surprise, many who thought it was the Worst Oscar Show Ever — I see a lot of this.\n\nA large group of people voted without consultation, and we have only a tiny piece of information as to how they voted. We know which films and people got the most votes but for all we know, each winner could have gotten 21% of the vote in a razor-close five-way competition. Nonetheless, we not only act like the whole Academy chose Halle Berry, we pretend they all had the same thing on their brains…then we further extrapolate to discuss the mindset of the voters in all categories; what they were collectively trying to say with this year's awards.\n\nFact is, there probably isn't one — or even one dominant — trend. We do this with political elections, as well (\"Twelve states voted Republican because they're fed up with high property taxes\") but at least there, we have various opinion polls and the exact vote totals from which to speculate. We still go too far, trying to assign one thought process to a large group of divergent minds — we color a whole state red or blue based on 51% of the vote — but there's some basis, however vague, for interpreting the win. Oscar votes, apart from being even less important, have the luxury of no data whatsoever that can ever validate or belie any analysis. We can say, \"Well, this year, Academy voters were trying to say they don't like the price of Raisinets at the refreshment stand,\" and nothing can ever prove us wrong. I think it's silly to pretend that a whole group of people — whose identities none of us really know — all spoke with one set of sensibilities and purpose. For all we know, this year's \"statement\" was about the price of Raisinets.\n\nOkay. Now, I'll shut up. By the way, they still have no idea if it's going to rain Thursday."
