        "text": "Woody Harrelson has given fans a rare insight into his violent past by talking about one particularly violent confrontation with Hole singer Courtney Love.\n\nDuring rehearsals for The People Vs Larry Flynt, Cheers star Woody recalls the rock singer was two hours late for a script reading.\n\nHe said: “She walks in and she’s mumbling some stupid excuse about this and that.\n\n“I told her, ‘well, I had this and that to do but I was still here on time.’”\n\nAfter a physical confrontation in which Love lunged at Harrelson, The Hunger Games actor remembers pinning the singer down, demanding an apology.\n\nWoody added in a heartfelt admission that he sometimes wishes he was like his on screen persona Woody Boyd.\n\nHe added: “It would of been great if I’d been as easy-going as Woody in Cheers.”\n\nThe troubled star married Laura Louie in 2008 and has three daughters Deni, Zoe and Makani. Set to star in blockbuster The Hunger Games: Catching Fire on November 21, it is clear Woody is now more settled.\n\nBut, suffering through a childhood divorce and his father’s prison sentence for murder, the actor attributes his promiscuity and attitude to his heavily religious childhood. He said: “There is no avoiding the fact that I was white trash.”"
