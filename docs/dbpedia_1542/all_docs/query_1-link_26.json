        "text": "NATHANIEL HACKMANN (Biff) (he/him) has emerged as an actor/singer of international renown. He has been seen on stage in some of the most demanding roles and alongside many of the world’s greatest orchestras. He has portrayed Jean Valjean and Javert on Broadway in Les Misérables, as well as the titular roles in Jekyll and Hyde and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. For the internationally televised BBC Proms at London’s Royal Albert Hall, he appeared as Curly with the John Wilson Orchestra in the acclaimed production of Oklahoma and portrayed Gaby in On The Town for Leonard Bernstein’s 100th Birthday Celebration. It is impossible to overstate the influence of Back to the Future in Hackmann’s formative years. Having memorized the films, line by line and shot by shot by wearing out the used VHS tapes he bought with his childhood lunch money at Blockbuster, it is an incredible honor to step into this iconic role and help tell this story for new generations! Following his recording as Steve in Paint Your Wagon, his Curly in Oklahoma will be available soon on all music streaming platforms, followed next year by his Billy Bigelow. Hackmann’s past favorite roles include both Gaston and the Beast in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, and Quasimodo in Disney’s Hunchback of Notre Dame, and many of Frank Wildhorn’s and Stephen Sondheim’s antagonists. In the operatic repertoire, Hackmann is an alumnus of the prestigious Merola Opera Program at the San Francisco Opera. He has also appeared with Virginia Opera, Michigan Opera Theater, Opera Theater Saint Louis, San Francisco Lyric Opera, and others. On the concert stage, he has appeared with the John Wilson Orchestra, Sinfonia of London, Hong Kong Symphony, San Francisco Opera Orchestra, Springfield Symphony, Midland Symphony Orchestra, Sun Valley Opera, Central Michigan Orchestra, Northern Arizona Symphony, and Northwest Indiana Symphony.

Gale was born and raised in St Louis, Missouri, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Cinema from the University of Southern California in 1973, where he met and began his association with his longtime collaborator, Robert Zemeckis.\n\nGale has written or co-written over 30 screenplays and his other film credits include 1941, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Used Cars, Trespass and Interstate 60, the last of which he also directed. In addition to his film and television work, and being the ‘Gatekeeper’ for the BTTF franchise, Gale has written comic books including Spider-Man, Batman and IDW’s Back to the Future title, thus proving to his father that he did not waste hours and hours reading comics in his youth. He has given talks on screenwriting in colleges across the USA, and enjoys meeting fans at comic conventions and Back to the Future events. He has also served as an expert witness in over 25 plagiarism lawsuits, even though this has occasionally required him to wear a suit and tie. When he’s not in production, writing, or wasting time on the internet, he actually does take out the trash, even when his wife doesn’t ask (well, sometimes he does). Gale lives in California with his wife and dog. Back to the Future the Musical is his first foray into writing for the stage.\n\nROBERT ZEMECKIS won an Academy Award©, a Golden Globe and a Director’s Guild of American Award for Best Director for the hugely successful and popular Forrest Gump. The film’s numerous honors also included a Best Picture Oscar and for Tom Hanks, a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nEarly in his career, he co-wrote with Bob Gale and directed Back to the Future, which was the top-grossing release of 1985, and for which Zemeckis shared Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Original Screenplay. He then went on to helm Back to the Future, Part II and Part III, completing one of the most successful film franchises in Motion Picture history.\n\nZemeckis has continued to bring an impressive number of popular films to the screen including the comedies Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, the romantic adventure Romancing The Stone starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and the macabre comedy hit Death Becomes Her starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis.\n\nHe also directed Who Framed Roger Rabbit, cleverly blending live action and animation in a feature film, resulting in a worldwide box office smash.\n\nZemeckis re-teamed with Hanks directing and producing the contemporary drama Cast Away which opened to critical and audience acclaim.\n\nHe directed and produced Contact, starring Jodie Foster, based on the best-selling novel by Carl Sagan. He also co-wrote and directed the motion capture film The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks as a charming train conductor taking children on a magical adventure to the North Pole.\n\nZemeckis produced and directed his second motion capture film, Beowulf which starred Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie, based on one of the oldest surviving pieces of Anglo-Saxon literature, written before the 10th Century A.D. He released another advanced motion-capture film: A Christmas Carol, based on the celebrated and beloved classic story by Charles Dickens which he both wrote and directed for The Disney Studios.\n\nZemeckis returned to live action direction with the critically-acclaimed dramatic feature film Flight, for Paramount Pictures starring Denzel Washington. Under the direction of Zemeckis, Washington received an Academy Award nomination for the role.\n\nFor The Walk, he directed Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ben Kingsley in the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit’s 1974 attempt to cross the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.\n\nHe then directed the romantic thriller Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, telling the compelling story of the relationship between a Canadian Intelligence Officer and a French Resistance Fighter against the backdrop of WWII in North Africa in 1942.\n\nAlong with Caroline Thompson Zemeckis wrote the screenplay for Welcome to Marwen, which he directed for Universal Pictures. The film starred Steve Carell as artist Mark Hogancamp who created a miniature WWII-era village as a way to recover from a violent assault. He then directed The Witches for Warner Bros. Studios.\n\nZemeckis produced such films as The Frighteners, Monster House, Last Holiday, and as a producer brought the true life story of The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio starring Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelson to the big screen.\n\nAlong with Bob Gale, Zemeckis co-wrote Trespass. He and Gale previously wrote 1941, which began a long-time association with Steven Spielberg.\n\nFor his present directorial effort, Zemeckis has completed Pinocchio which he co-wrote for the Disney Studios. The film is currently on Disney+\n\nIn 1998 Zemeckis, Steve Starkey and Jack Rapke partnered to form the ImageMovers, a production company dedicated to telling character-driven stories across many genres for film and television incorporating into their both cutting-edge and innovative digital technology\n\nFor the small screen, his television directing credits include episodes of Spielberg’s Amazing Stores and HBO’s Tales From the Crypt.

This state-of-the-art center is the country’s first and only fully digital training center and houses the latest in non-linear production and post-production equipment as well as stages, a 50-seat screening room and USC student-run television station, Trojan Vision.\n\nPresently Zemeckis is on location in England filming Here for Miramax and Sony Pictures Studios. The film will have a Fall 2023 release.\n\nIn his ongoing, decades-long career as a composer, Alan Silvestri has blazed an innovative trail with his exciting and melodic scores, winning the applause of Hollywood and movie audiences the world over. With a credit list of over 100 films, Silvestri has composed some of the most recognisable and beloved themes in movie history. His efforts have been recognised with two Oscar® nominations, two Golden Globe nominations, four Grammy® awards, two Emmy® awards, and numerous International Film Music Critics Awards, Saturn Awards, and Hollywood Music In Media Awards.\n\nBorn in New York City and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, Silvestri first dreamed of becoming a jazz guitar player. After attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston, he hit the road as a performer and arranger. Landing in Hollywood at the age of 22, he found himself successfully composing the music for 1972’s The Doberman Gang which established his place in the world of film composing. The 1970s witnessed the rise of energetic synth-pop scores, establishing Silvestri as the action rhythmatist for TV’s highway patrol hit CHiPs. This action-driven score caught the ear of a young filmmaker named Robert Zemeckis, whose 1984 hit film, Romancing the Stone, was the perfect first date for the composer and director. Its success became the basis of a decades- long relationship that continues to this day. Their numerous collaborations have taken them through fascinating landscapes and stylistic variations, from the Back to the Future trilogy to Toontown in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, the tension of What Lies Beneath and Death Becomes Her, to the cosmic wonder of Contact; the emotional isolation of Castaway, to the magic of The Polar Express, to Zemeckis’ 1994 Best Picture winner, Forrest Gump, for which Silvestri’s gift for melodically beautiful themes earned him an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination. This 38-year, 21-film collaboration includes such recent films as Flight, Allied and The Witches based on Roald Dahl’s 1973 classic book. Zemeckis and Silvestri are currently working on Walt Disney’s Pinocchio starring Tom Hanks, which is scheduled for release in September of 2022.\n\nThough the Zemeckis/Silvestri collaboration is legendary, Silvestri has scored films of every imaginable style and genre. His energy has brought excitement and emotion to the hard-hitting orchestral scores for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, James Cameron’s The Abyss as well as Predator 1 and 2 and The Mummy Returns. Alan’s diversity is on full display in family entertainment films such as The Father of the Bride 1 and 2, The Parent Trap, Stuart Little 1 and 2, Disney’s Lilo and Stitch, The Croods as well as Night at the Museum 1, 2 and 3 while his passion for melody fuels the romantic emotion of films like The Bodyguard and What Women Want.\n\nIn 2018-19 Alan composed the music for Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. These films are the culmination of a partnership with Marvel that began in 2011 with his dynamically heroic score for Captain America: The First Avenger followed by The Avengers in 2012. Alan’s collaboration with Marvel helped propel The Avengers: Infinity Saga to spectacular worldwide success.\n\nSilvestri’s success has also crossed into the world of song writing. His partnership with six-time Grammy Award-winner Glen Ballard has produced hits such as the Grammy-winning and Oscar- nominated song ‘Believe’ (Josh Groban) for The Polar Express, ‘Butterfly Fly Away’ (Miley Cyrus) for Hannah Montana The Movie, ‘God Bless Us Everyone’ (Andrea Bocelli) for A Christmas Carol and ‘A Hero Comes Home’ (Idina Menzel) for Beowulf. In addition to Back to the Future the Musical, Alan and Glen continue their long collaboration with new songs for the upcoming Robert Zemeckis production Pinocchio for Disney, scheduled for release in September 2022.\n\nSix-time Grammy Award winner Glen Ballard is one of popular music’s most accomplished producers and songwriters, whose records have sold more than one hundred and fifty million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2023 Ballard was selected to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Through his Los Angeles-based production company, Augury, Ballard is developing a diverse slate of projects in which music plays a central role. His most recent television project is the Netflix Original series “The Eddy,” a music-driven multicultural drama about a jazz band trying to survive in chaotic modern-day Paris which debuted in May 2020. Ballard wrote and composed original songs and music for the limited series and served as an executive producer alongside Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle, BAFTA and Tony award winning writer Jack Thorne, and Emmy winning producer/director Alan Poul.\n\nBallard wrote original lyrics and music for GHOST the Musical which debuted in 2011 and has since been touring worldwide. Ballard’s international production company, Augury is a producer of the stage adaptation of 1985’s Back to the Future, having worked on the project’s development for more than 14 years. In collaboration with Grammy Award winning and Oscar nominated film composer Alan Silvestri, Ballard created original music and lyrics for the production which includes 17 new original songs and is directed by John Rando. Ballard is also writing songs for the stage version of the 1979 movie The Rose, to be produced by Gail Berman (The Jackal Group) and Michael Gorfaine and Sam Schwartz in association with Augury. Ballard produced and co-wrote Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill (33 million worldwide, four Grammys, and named Best Album of the Decade by Billboard Magazine), and in 2019 a musical called Jagged Little Pill featuring all the songs from the album debuted on Broadway. Directed by Diane Paulus with a book by Diablo Cody, Jagged Little Pill was nominated for 15 Tony Awards in 2020.\n\nBallard has written and produced songs for Quincy Jones, Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand, Dave Matthews, Shakira, Katy Perry, Idina Menzel, George Benson, Ringo Starr, George Strait, Wilson Phillips, Van Halen, Chaka Khan, Patti Austin, Al Jarreau, Andrea Bocelli and many others.\n\nHis production credits include producing and arranging records for Annie Lennox, No Doubt and POD.
