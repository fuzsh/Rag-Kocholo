        "text": "Hollywood career\n\nAfter moving to Hollywood, Reynolds played a few supporting roles in TV series and movies. He was offered the role of Xander in Joss Whedon’s series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003) but turned it down because he did not want to play a teenager anymore. Instead, he landed the role of medical school student Berg in the ABC sitcom Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998–2001). The series helped Reynolds develop his gifts for mimicry and imbecilic bumbling, qualities that were also showcased in his lead role in National Lampoon’s Van Wilder (2002). The screwball college comedy became a cult hit.\n\nThat role brought Reynolds work in a variety of genres. He starred in the Canadian heist flick Foolproof (2003), which was a box-office disappointment, and voiced the sidekick of Leslie Nielsen’s bumbling crime fighter in the Teletoon animated comedy series Zeroman (2004–05). He made the jump to big-budget Hollywood fare with a supporting role opposite Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks in the comedy The In-Laws (2003) and starred with Wesley Snipes in the action movie Blade: Trinity (2004), for which he trained for three months and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis status as a Hollywood star firmly established, Reynolds starred or costarred in the comedies Waiting (2005), Just Friends (2005), Adventureland (2009), and The Change-Up (2011); the romantic comedies Definitely, Maybe (2008) with Rachel Weisz and The Proposal (2009) opposite Sandra Bullock; and the action movies Smokin’ Aces (2006), X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Green Lantern (2011), R.I.P.D. (2013), Self/less (2015), and Deadpool (2016). The latter film, about the Marvel Comics antihero, was a blockbuster hit, and Reynolds subsequently starred in and cowrote the sequel, Deadpool 2 (2018). He later appeared with Will Ferrell in Spirited (2022), a musical comedy inspired by Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His thrillers include Buried (2010), in which he played an American contractor entombed in a coffin in Iraq; Safe House (2012), about a CIA agent trying to protect a criminal (played by Denzel Washington); and 6 Underground (2019), about a billionaire who recruits a team to overthrow a dictator. In 2021 he starred in Free Guy, portraying a bank teller who learns he is a character in a video game; the sci-fi comedy also featured Jodie Comer. In The Adam Project (2022), Reynolds took the role of a time traveler who joins forces with his preteen self and late father to save the future, making peace with his past along the way. In 2024 Reynolds returned to the world of Marvel to star opposite Hugh Jackman in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nReynolds also lent his voice to the family films The Croods (2013) and its sequel (2020), Turbo (2013), and Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019). Exhibiting his skill for self-mockery, he played himself in an episode of Seth MacFarlane’s series Family Guy (2011) and made memorable cameo appearances in MacFarlane’s feature comedies Ted (2012) and A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).\n\nReynolds’s more serious movies were among his least successful. The dramas The Nines (2007), Fireflies in the Garden (2008), and Chaos Theory (2008) were all poorly received both critically and commercially, and Atom Egoyan’s thriller The Captive (2014), in which Reynolds starred as the father of a kidnapped girl, was booed by audiences and panned by critics upon its debut at the Cannes film festival. Somewhat better received was Woman in Gold (2015), in which he played a lawyer helping a Jewish woman (Helen Mirren) recover a painting stolen by Nazis during World War II.\n\nCharity and advocacy work\n\nA committed environmentalist and activist, Reynolds has been involved over the years with a number of charities. In 2008 he ran the New York City Marathon to raise money for the Michael J. Fox Foundation and in honor of his father, who was diagnosed with Parkinson disease about 1994. Reynolds served on the foundation’s board of directors.\n\nReynolds executive-produced and narrated the eco-conscious Canadian documentary The Whale (2011). He worked with the environmental organization Natural Resources Defense Council to advocate for renewable energy and to bring attention to the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, he helped raise funds for relief efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and, together with his wife, Blake Lively, donated $1 million to North American food banks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nReynolds has contributed to the Vancouver and Toronto locations of Covenant House, which provides shelter to runaways and homeless people, and he frequently visits children’s hospitals. In addition, he has supported children’s causes in Africa, including the education of former child soldiers in Uganda and the care of orphans in Malawi."
