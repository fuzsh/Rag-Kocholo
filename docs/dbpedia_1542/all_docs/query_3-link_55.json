        "text": "Toy Story has kept our childhoods alive for the past two decades. Who knew that talking toys could teach us so much about friendship, feelings, and growing up? There are countless life lessons to be learned after all is said and done—and let’s just say Woody and the gang have a lot more to say than the average pull-string quote. These are some of our favorite Toy Story quotes from the iconic characters:\n\nWoody\n\nToy Story\n\n“I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you outta here, Buzz.”\n\n“Snap out of it, Buzz!”\n\n“Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony.”\n\n“You are a toy!”\n\n“Don't tell me what to do.”\n\n“This is the perfect time to panic!”\n\n“That wasn't flying. That was falling with style.”\n\n\"From now on you must take good care of your toys, because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid. We toys can see everything! So play nice!\"\n\n\"The word I'm searching for, I can't say because there's preschool toys present.\"\n\n\"Reach for the sky!\"\n\n\"This town ain't big enough for the two of us.\"\n\n\"Somebody's poisoned the water hole.\"\n\n\"You're my favorite deputy.\"\n\n\"Yee-haw! Giddy-up, partner! We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"Hey! No one does that to my friend!\"\n\n\"Well, then, let's find out together!\"\n\n\"So, who's the real Buzz?\"\n\n\"I can't stop Andy from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it for the world.\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"If you'd help us, one toy to another, I'd sure be grateful.\"\n\n\"So long, partner.\"\n\n\"Daycare? What, have you all lost your marbles?\"\n\n\"I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.\"\n\nBuzz Lightyear\n\nToy Story\n\n“To infinity and beyond!”\n\n“You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell.”\n\n“And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.”\n\n“I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.”\n\n\"And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n“Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours, you'll be sitting around a campfire with Andy making delicious, hot schmoes.”\n\n\"Woody once risked his life to save me. I couldn't call myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same.\"\n\n\"Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.\"\n\n\"I wanted to say you're a bright young woman with a beautiful yarn full of hair. Hair full of yarn. It's uh ... oh ... I must go.\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"Quiet, musical hog!\"\n\n\"We're going into attic mode, folks. Keep your accessories with you at all times. Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition.\"\n\nMr. Potato Head\n\nToy Story\n\n“Son of a building block!”\n\n\"You uncultured swine. What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?\"\n\n\"Hey, Hamm, look. I'm Picasso!\"\n\n\"Who invited that kid?\n\n\"Laser envy.\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"We're not preschool toys, Slinky. We can read.\"\n\n\"Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.\"\n\n\"You're not turning me into a mashed potato.\"\n\n\"Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!\"\n\n\"Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back.\"\n\n\"Pizza, anyone?\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"You would not believe what I've been through tonight.\"\n\n\"I was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.\"\n\nHamm\n\nToy Story\n\n\"Will you take a look at all those presents? Yes, sir. We're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.”\n\n“Impressive wingspan. Very good!”\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"All right. Nobody look till I get my cork back in.\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"It's the perfect time to be hysterical!\"\n\n\"Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay.\"\n\n\"That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.\"\n\n\"I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.\"\n\nRex\n\nToy Story\n\n\"I don't like confrontations!\"\n\n\"But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one? I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!\"\n\n\"I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it!\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n“How do you spell FBI?”\n\n\"It's the chicken man!\"\n\n\"Dinosaur overboard!\"\n\n\"But look at my little arms! I can't press the fire button and jump at the same time!\"\n\n\"Losing health units. Must rest.\"\n\n\"But I don't wanna use my head!\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"Come to papa.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hate all this uncertainty!\"\n\nSlinky Dog\n\nToy Story\n\n\"I knew you were right all along, Woody. Never doubted you for a second.\"\n\n\"Golly bob howdy!\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"Buzz, my back end's goin' to Baton Rouge!\"\n\nAliens\n\nToy Story\n\n“The claaaaaaaw.”\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful.\"\n\nToy Story 3\n\n“The claaaaaaaw.”\n\nBo Peep\n\nToy Story\n\n\"I found my moving buddy.\"\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"You're cute when you care.\"\n\nMr. Pricklepants\n\nToy Story 3\n\n“Well excuse me. I'm trying to stay in character.”\n\n“Are you classically trained?”\n\nAndy\n\nToy Story 2\n\n\"You should never tangle with the unstoppable duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!\"\n\nButtercup\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"There is no way out. Just kidding. Door's right over there.\"\n\nLotso\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"You got a play-date with destiny!\"\n\n\"Put him back in the time out chair.\"\n\nTrixie\n\nToy Story 3\n\n\"We're either in a cafe in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey. I'm pretty sure I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news.\""
