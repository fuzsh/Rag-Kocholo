According to Duke-Elder and Wyler,1 they were first mentioned by Galenus in 200 AD and later, in 1666, they were described in more detail by the German physician and anatomist Heinrich Meibom, after whom they are named.\n\nLipids produced by the meibomian glands are the main component of the superficial lipid layer of the tear film that protects it against evaporation of the aqueous phase and is believed also to stabilize the tear film by lowering surface tension.2 Hence, meibomian lipids are essential for the maintenance of ocular surface health and integrity.\n\nAlthough they share certain principal characteristics with ordinary sebaceous glands, they have several distinct differences in anatomy, location, secretory regulation, composition of their secretory product, and function.\n\nFunctional disorders of the meibomian glands, referred to today as meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD),3 are increasingly recognized as a discrete disease entity.4 –8 In patients with dry eye disease, alterations in the lipid phase that point to MGD are reportedly more frequent than isolated alterations in the aqueous phase. In a study by Heiligenhaus et al.,9 a lipid deficiency occurred in 76.7% of dry eye patients compared with only 11.1% of those with isolated alterations of the aqueous phase. This result is in line with the observations by Shimazaki et al.10 of a prevalence of MGD in the absolute majority of eyes with ocular discomfort defined as dry eye symptoms. These observations noted that 64.6% of all such eyes and 74.5% of those excluding a deficiency of aqueous tear secretion were found to have obstructive MGD, or a loss of glandular tissue, or both.10 Horwath-Winter et al.11 reported MGD in 78% of dry eye patients or, if only non-Sjögren patients are considered, in 87% compared with 13% with isolated aqueous tear deficiency. It may thus be accepted that MGD is important, conceivably underestimated, and possibly the most frequent cause of dry eye disease due to increased evaporation of the aqueous tears.5,9 –12\n\nAfter some excellent reviews of MGD4,7,8,13,14 in the past, many new findings have been reported in recent years, and other questions remain to be identified and resolved. A sound understanding of meibomian gland structure and function and its role in the functional anatomy of the ocular surface15 is needed, to understand the contribution of the meibomian glands to dysfunction and disease. Herein, we seek to provide a comprehensive review of physiological and pathophysiological aspects of the meibomian glands.\n\nHeinrich Meibom\n\nHeinrich Meibom the younger (1638–1700; )16 came from a scholarly family. He was the son of the physician Johann Heinrich Meibom and the grandson of the German historian and poet Heinrich Meibom the elder (1555–1625),17 who was professor of history and poetry at the University of Helmstedt in Germany. Heinrich Meibom the younger was born on June 29, 1638, in Lübeck, Germany, and later traveled around in Europe and received a cosmopolitan education. In a short article18 that commemorated the 300th anniversary of his birth in 1938, the British Medical Journal characterized him as follows: “Like so many of his contemporaries, he was indeed a child of Apollo, god of culture, poetry, rhetoric, and healing. While still a medical student (he became MD at Angers in 1663) he was appointed to, and in 1664 took up, the professorship of medicine in the University of Helmstadt. Fourteen years later he accepted the additional chairs of history and of poetry. He further showed his versatility by straying into the pleasant fields of archaeology, philology, and philosophy, and all his life he was an insatiate traveller.” Apparently a man of many talents, in 1666, shortly after receiving the chair of medicine, Heinrich Meibom published the first detailed description, including a drawing, of the oil glands inside the tarsus of the eyelid, that later were named the meibomian glands. His description appeared as a book with the title De Vasis Palpebrarum Novis Epistola.19 This early drawing showed basic characteristics of the glands, such as multiple single gland streaks along the extension of the tarsus with openings onto the lid margin, similar to but not as detailed as another much later and more well-known drawing ( ).\n\nAnatomy, Embryology, and Physiology\n\nAnatomy of the Meibomian Glands\n\nArrangement.\n\nA single meibomian gland is composed of clusters of secretory acini that are arranged circularly around a long central duct and connected to it by short ductules. This arrangement has been compared with a chain of onions.20 One end of the central duct is blind, and the other end opens close to the posterior lid border, just anterior to the mucocutaneous junction, at the lid margin, where the oily secretion is delivered onto the tear meniscus.21\n\nThese separate glands are arranged in parallel in a single row throughout the length of the tarsal plates in the upper and lower lids,1,22,23 and they presumably act in a coordinated fashion that is influenced by hormonal and neural regulation and by the mechanical forces of muscle contraction during the eye blink.24\n\nThe extent of the meibomian glands roughly corresponds to the dimensions of the tarsal plates in the upper and lower eyelids and hence differs between them ( ). In the upper lid the tarsal plate has the shape of a half circle that extends upward centrally for approximately 1 cm and narrows on the temporal and nasal sides, whereas the tarsal plate in the lower lids is smaller and forms a strip of rather equal length (∼0.5 cm) from the nasal to the temporal side.24\n\nDimensions and Number of Glands.\n\nThe reported dimensions of the meibomian glands differ to a certain extent in different studies. The number of separate glands in the upper lid is given in one study20 as 25 and in another1 as 40, with a median number of approximately 31.25 The number of glands in the lower lid is given in the former study20 as 20 and in the latter1 as 30, with a median of approximately 26 glands.25 The length of the individual glands is reported as approximately 5.5 mm in the middle of the upper lid and approximately 2 mm in the lower lid, and hence their calculated total volume is also higher: approximately double in the upper lid (26 μL) versus the lower lid (13 μL).25 The meibomian glands in the lower lids tend to be wider than those in the upper lids. The number of secretory acini along a single meibomian gland is reported20 to be approximately 10 to 15 and is also higher in the upper than in the lower lid.\n\nThe secretory capacity of the meibomian glands in the upper lids should therefore be roughly double of that in the lower lids, but most investigations focus on the lower lid because of its greater accessibility. The differential secretory capacity in the upper versus the lower lid has not been investigated.\n\nEmbryologic Development of the Meibomian Gland\n\nThe embryologic growth of the meibomian glands occurs from the third to the seventh month of gestation, during the sealed-lid phase of eyelid development.26 –28 During this time, the loose connective tissue of the mesoderm in the lid folds differentiates into the tarsal plate and muscles (orbicularis and Riolan's muscle), the blood vessels, and the loose connective tissue underlying the outer lid skin and the conjunctiva. The development of the meibomian glands from the anlage (the initial clustering of embryonic cells that serves as a foundation from which the organ develops) of the meibomian glands shows considerable similarities to that of the hair follicles, the hair anlage. Both of them grow from the ectodermal sheet, which seals the fused lid folds down into the mesoderm, although the meibomian anlage is larger, grows deeper, and takes longer for complete development as investigated in detail by Ehler's group.28\n\nSimilar to the hair anlage of the eyelashes, which develops associated glands (holocrine sebaceous glands of Zeis and modified sweat glands of Moll), the epithelial cord of the meibomian anlage develops lateral outgrowths that later differentiate into the connecting ductules and secretory holocrine sebaceous acini. Inside the epithelial cylinder of the meibomian anlage, similar to the hair anlage, the production of lipids leads to the formation of a central canal that later develops into the central duct. The production of lipids is followed by the occurrence of keratohyalin granules in the luminal epithelial cells, and therefore the lipid synthesis and keratinization events were once assumed to be somehow related.28 Lipid production by the more mature meibomian anlage and by the ciliary glands of Zeis has also been found to be related to the formation of a canal between the two sealed lid folds, which leads to the separation of the then fully differentiated upper and lower lids in the seventh month of gestation.28 In the mouse, it is thought that an increasing amount of keratinization, rather than lipid secretion, contributes to the separation of the upper and lower eyelids.29\n\nHence, the central meibomian duct can be compared to the hair follicles of the eyelashes in embryology and also shows distinct similarities in structure and epithelial differentiation, including the keratinization status, in the adult. The meibomian gland can hence be regarded as a “hair follicle without a hair shaft.”30 This observation may offer the conclusion that hyperkeratinization is a typical disease of the meibomian gland.\n\nHistologic Appearance of the Meibomian Gland\n\nThe meibomian glands are composed of secretory acini that are connected via smaller ductules to the larger, long, straight central duct ( ) that extends throughout the length of the tarsal plate and opens onto the free lid margin close to the posterior lid border. The whole internal ductal system is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with signs of incipient keratinization. Full keratinization (cornification), as indicated by the presence of luminal keratin lamellae, is physiologically only present in the terminal part of the central duct that is lined by an ingrowth of the cornified epidermis from the surface of the free lid margin.1,23,24,31,32\n\nAcinus.\n\nAs a special type of sebaceous gland, the secretory acini of the meibomian glands follow a holocrine secretion mode that is reflected by their structure ( A). The numerous secretory acini have an elongated or spherical shape of approximately 150 to 200 μm diameter. They are completely filled with secretory cells, termed meibocytes.33 The basal cells are smaller and darker. The meibocytes, located more toward the center of the acinus, show a progressive accumulation of lipids in the cytoplasm and hence appear increasingly foamy and pale in conventional histology of paraffin-embedded sections because of the extraction of the lipids during processing. During their maturation, the most central cells undergo shrinkage, compaction, and disintegration of the nucleus (pyknosis). Eventually, disintegration of the cell membrane occurs at the transition from the acinus to the ductule. Hence, the whole cell contents form the oily secretory product termed meibum.33 A gradient in maturation with more undifferentiated, immature cells in the basal layer is also supported by transmission electron microscopy in mouse34 and human35 meibomian glands. The basal acinar cells contain a medium dense nucleus that is rich in heterochromatin and has a prominent nucleolus. The basal acinar cells have sparse cytoplasm that contains a large number of keratin filament bundles together with numerous mitochondria and many free ribosomes, as is characteristic for synthesis of internal cell proteins, whereas the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, for export of secretory products, are scarce. The basal layer of meibocytes in the periphery of the acinus serves as a proliferating progenitor cell population that constantly gives rise to new meibocytes. In the rat, it has been shown that it takes approximately 4 days to generate new meibocytes.36\n\nConnecting Ductule.\n\nTypically one, or sometimes more, acini are connected to a ductule that is approximately 150 μm long and has a luminal diameter of approximately 30 to 50 μm. The ductules are lined by a stratified (four layers) squamous epithelium. At the junction from the acinus to the ductule, a sharp transition from the peripheral layer of basal meibocytes to the ductal epithelium has been reported in electron microscopy of the monkey and rabbit.32 This conclusion was reached from the observation that the epithelial cells of the ductule did not contain lipid droplets, as found in neighboring meibocytes, but instead contained keratohyalin granules. Histology in the human meibomian gland does not necessarily confirm a sharp transition based on the shape and arrangement of the epithelial cells in this region, because the spherical brighter epithelial cells of the basal meibocytes are seen to transform gradually into the cells of the multilayered ductal epithelium that have a slightly denser cytoplasm and a more elongated shape ( B). Keratohyalin granules are also observed in ductal epithelial cells of the normal human meibomian gland (Knop E, et al. IOVS 2009;50:ARVO E-Abstract 4833).\n\nCentral Duct.\n\nThe connecting ductules enter the long central duct, typically in an oblique direction that leads to the formation of a sharp tissue spur that is mainly composed of epithelial cells and contains a narrow internal core of connective tissue at the entrance into the central duct ( C).\n\nThe central duct is also lined by a four-layered, stratified squamous epithelium but has a wider lumen approximately 100 to 150 μm in diameter. The central duct extends throughout the total length of the gland, which corresponds roughly to the extension of the tarsus.1,20,25,37\n\nAround the terminal part of the central duct and among the terminal acini close to the free lid margin, there are various amounts of striated fibers of Riolan's muscle ( , also noted in A) that are split from the orbicularis muscle by the down-growth of the hair anlage of the cilia, deep into the tarsal fold during embryologic development. These muscle fibers appear to encircle the terminal part of the meibomian gland.20,38 The terminal part of the central duct preceding the excretory duct is often slightly dilated, thus forming a kind of ampulla, conceivably due to its physiological content of secreted meibum.\n\nExcretory Duct.\n\nThe cornified epithelium of the free lid margin (epidermis) extends into the terminal part of the meibomian gland1,22,23,32 for about 0.5 mm. It has a keratinizing layer that contains numerous dense keratohyalin granules (granular layer) and a superficial layer of fully keratinized (cornified) keratin lamellae. At about 0.5 mm internal to the orifice, the epithelium gradually transforms into the ordinary ductal epithelium of the meibomian gland by losing the keratin lamellae and the granular layer and by reducing the stratification from about six to eight layers to four layers. Since the epithelium in this terminal part has a different structure compared with the rest of the central duct, it appears justified to term it as an excretory duct (Knop E, et al. IOVS 2009;50:ARVO E-Abstract 4833).\n\nPhysiology of the Meibomian Glands\n\nSecretion Mode.\n\nBasal meibocytes move during their maturation, which includes the production and accumulation of lipids, from the basal compartment of the acinus toward its center36 and eventually toward the entrance of the ductule ( , also indicated in ). The biochemical characteristics of the secretion process and its products are considered in the section on lipid synthesis.\n\nDuring this process, the meibocytes go through several stages that can be differentiated morphologically (basal, differentiating, mature, and hypermature), depending on several structural characteristics as described by Gorgas.34 Cell organelles that are necessary for lipid production inside the cells increase in number and size during this process—in particular, the smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER) and peroxisomes.34 The lipid droplets are encircled by multilamellar membrane structures that are assumed to originate from the membrane of the sER.34 Similar multilamellar structures are also integrated into the lipid droplets and hence contribute to the meibum.35 All the components of the whole cell including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids contribute to the oily secretory product, which is also called meibum.33\n\nThe ductal system may contribute to the final secretory product that is released onto the posterior lid margin in an active or passive way, since (1) nerve fibers are observed not only around the acini but also around the ductal system,39 and (2) the originally secreted meibomian lipids are conceivably, at least in part, modified by hydrolyzing enzymes from commensal bacteria inside the ductal system that lead to a breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and small portions of mono- and diglycerides and other modifications40 in patients with blepharitis.41 and even in the normal condition. Commensal bacterial species have been cultured in most expressed meibum samples42 from blepharitis patients, but similarly also from normal subjects.\n\nMechanisms of Secretion and Delivery.\n\nBecause of the length of the meibomian glands, there is frequently a long distance between the cell biological process of secretion of the meibum in the secretory acini and its actual delivery onto the lid margin where it exerts its functions. Therefore, it appears advisable to follow the nomenclature suggested by Bron and Tiffany43 and to separate secretion of the meibum from its delivery.\n\nThe constant production of new meibocytes in the secretory acini and their disintegration into the final secretory product generates a continuous secretory force that drives the meibomian oils within the ductal system of the gland toward the orifice at the free lid margin ( ). The hypothesis of a continuous production is not only supported by the observed generation time of new meibocytes36 but also by the finding that in the morning after sleep, during which the lids are closed, an increased amount of lipid that has apparently accumulated within the ductal system is then delivered in increased amounts onto the lid margin.44,45 The constant secretion of meibum further represents a basis for the generation of increased pressure within an obstructed gland.\n\nThe same observation further supports the conclusion that the mechanical action of the lid muscles contributes to delivery ( ), as suggested by Linton et al.46 During the movement of the eyelids during a blink, the orbicularis muscle, located on the external side of the tarsal plate, generates a compression of the tarsal plate and the enclosed tarsal glands of Meibom. It was concluded that this “would promote the flow of secretion by a milking action.”46 It has been suggested that the embedding of the glands inside the tarsal tissue provides for a homogeneous effect on compression of the individual glands along the lid margin.37 The contraction of Riolan's muscle conceivably exerts compression of the terminal part of the ductal system and acini and contributes to the delivery of the oily meibum onto the surface of the lid margin. This notion may be supported by the incidental observation that meibum is released onto the lid margin in the form of jets of liquid.47 It has been assumed that the constrictive forces of Riolan's muscle may also close the terminal part of the meibomian gland and hence prevent the outflow (i.e., act in a somewhat antagonistic way on the flow of meibum compared to the pretarsal orbicularis muscle).46 It has been further speculated that, in the act of a blink, the pretarsal orbicularis performs a “milking action” while Riolan's muscle is relaxed and, conversely, between blinks, while the orbicularis is relaxed, Riolan's muscle contracts to prevent the outflow of meibum.46 Contraction of Riolan's muscle may also aid in limiting unwanted outflow of meibum (e.g., at night), although then the orbicularis muscle is relaxed, according to Linton et al.,46 and does not perform a propulsive action on the meibum. Although these speculations may offer attractive explanations for the delivery of meibum, there is no evidence of such an antagonistic action of the marginal muscle of Riolan compared with the pretarsal orbicularis muscle. There is also no evidence of a potential influence of the smooth fibers of the superior and inferior tarsal muscles or of an influence of age-related or pathologic changes in the composition and shape of the tarsal plate and lids that could influence meibomian gland function and meibum delivery. These questions may need further investigation.\n\nAfter an absence of blinking and muscular action overnight, the accumulated meibum from within the ductal system is delivered in increased amounts. This action has been observed by meibometry44 in the morning during the first hour or so after awaking and has been clinically observed after a prolonged time of concentrated work associated with reduced blinking frequency.45,46 Consequently, muscular action during repeated enforced blinks significantly increases the lipid layer thickness48 and is also an appropriate therapeutic approach to overcoming a certain minor degree of obstruction in patients with incipient obstructive meibomian gland disease.3\n\nLid Topography and Meibomian Gland Function.\n\nThe differential contribution of the meibomian glands in the upper versus lower eyelids has been insufficiently investigated to date. Because of the calculated higher volume of the meibomian glands in the upper lids,25 it can be assumed that they also have a higher secretory capacity and contribute more to the lipid pool at the lid margin and subsequently to the tear film lipid layer. However, because of the better accessibility of the margin of the lower lids, most investigations of the morphology and secretory capacity of the meibomian glands have focused on the lower lids.\n\nThis focus applies in particular to meibometry, introduced by Bron and Tiffany43 and Chew and colleagues,44,45 which is able to measure effective amounts of lipid on the lid margin.44 Research has shown the amount of meibomian lipids on the lid margin, and the rate of delivery is dependent on age, sex, and diurnal conditions.45,49 In these investigations it has been assumed that mixing of the meibum of the upper and lower lids during blinking means that the lower reservoir is likely to be similar to the value obtained from the upper lid. The amount of lipid in the marginal reservoir is lower in children younger than 14 years compared with adults, higher in adult males than in adult females, equal in both sexes after the age of 50 years, and stable or even slightly increased up to the eighth decade of age.45,50 The rising amount of lipids in the marginal reservoir with age is in some contrast to the described decrease of active meibomian glands with age50 and can probably be explained by a decreased removal of lipids from the lipid layer and reservoir.43,50,51\n\nThe secretory activity of glands, as analyzed by Norn52 by the staining of delivered lipid at the meibomian orifice, found active delivery in only 45% of gland openings at one time point and a decrease of active glands by 50% from the age of 20 years to the age of 80 years.52 The morphologic equivalent of such a decrease in function may be represented by an age-dependent disappearance of gland tissue (gland dropout) as observed more recently by meibography.53 The secretory activity of glands was analyzed in more detail by Korb and Blackie51,54,55 by their ability to deliver a liquid secretory product on diagnostic expression involving application of mild external pressure in the physiological range of 1.25 g/mm2, performed to reveal delivery without overcoming a potential obstruction of the orifice. These studies supported that not all glands deliver oil at the same time. In addition, it was observed for the first time, that the number of active glands in lower lids depends on their location along the lid margin and is highest in the nasal third,51 lower in the middle of the lid, and lower still in the temporal third meibomian glands. It was also observed that there is a correlation between the number of actively delivering meibomian glands in the lower eyelid and dry eye symptoms.51 The time necessary for full expression of a gland, at the specified mild pressure until delivery stopped was approximately 12 seconds, on average, and the recovery time until new oil could again be expressed from the same gland was approximately 2 hours.54 When individual glands were repeatedly expressed, with intervals of 3 hours between expressions over a daytime period of 9 hours (i.e., four times), it was observed that a single gland is capable of secreting oil on demand over the course of a working day.55 This continuous activity of the meibomian glands also showed a similar dependence on the position along the lid margin, as observed before.\n\nInvestigations on the secretory activity and capacity of the meibomian glands in the upper lid are desirable, to better analyze the physiological functions of the glands and their alterations in different types of disease.\n\nInnervation.\n\nIn contrast to the sebaceous glands of the skin elsewhere in the body that are mainly regulated via hormones and other factors, the meibomian glands also have a distinct neural innervation.\n\nThe meibomian glands of the human have a dense meshwork of unmyelinated nerve fibers (nerve plexus) around the acini that are described by electron microscopy32 and also by histochemistry.56 The network consists of nerve fibers that have terminal buttons containing small vesicles filled by granules that contain neurotransmitters. The nerve endings are located closely around the acini but remain outside the basement membrane and constitute so-called synapses en passant that lack a direct postsynaptic structure in the target cell, as is characteristic of the autonomic nervous system. Such nerve fibers are also observed around the ductal system,56 which may indicate that the ductal epithelium contributes to the composition of the finally delivered meibum. Many nerve fibers occur around and within the wall of the small vessels39 that build a dense meshwork around the acini.20\n\nThe nerve fibers of the human meibomian gland are mainly positive for acetylcholinesterase and are hence supposed to represent a part of the cholinergic parasympathetic nervous system.56 In addition they contain the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P,57 which are markers for the sensory nervous system but also occur in the parasympathetic system, and, in addition, the parasympathetic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.58 These results substantiate a prevailing parasympathetic innervation of the meibomian gland.\n\nIn summary, the innervation of the meibomian glands is maintained via a dense meshwork of nerve fibers that contain different neurotransmitters and originate from different sources. They include, besides the mainly parasympathetic nerves from the pterygopalatine ganglion, sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion and sensory fibers from the trigeminal ganglion. In the rat it has been shown, that the parasympathetic fibers via the pterygopalatine ganglion originate from the superior salivatory nucleus59 that is also responsible for the innervation of the lacrimal gland. This innervation pattern offers the possibility of a common regulation24 of the ocular surface glands that contribute the different components of the tear film (meibomian glands for the lipids and lacrimal gland and accessory glands for the aqueous phase) to achieve an optimal composition of the tear film. The goblet cells that produce the secreted mucins which represent the main component of the mucous phase of the preocular tear film appear to be regulated in the same way.60 Whether and how the meibomian glands are actually integrated into the neural feedback loop,61,62 similar to the lacrimal gland, is yet to be learned.\n\nLess information is available at present on the release of the transmitters observed in the nerve fibers, on respective receptors on the target tissue, and on the mode of action that is transmitted by their interaction.\n\nKeratinization\n\nProcess of Epithelial Keratinization.\n\nMeibomian glands share principal features of the embryologic developmental course and of the structural organization with the hair follicles of the eyelashes. These features include a general commitment of the epithelium to keratinization. Keratohyalin granules represent incipient stages of keratinization and contain proteins such as filaggrin that are later released into the cytoplasm and serve the function of interconnecting the intermediate keratin filaments leading to the formation of a densely packed meshwork. The keratin meshwork increasingly occupies the cytoplasm of the keratinizing epidermal cells, termed keratinocytes.63 The cross-linking of keratin bundles goes along with an enforcement of the cell membrane that is transformed into the cornified envelope.64 After degeneration and loss of their nuclei, these cells form the superficial keratin lamellae that indicate full keratinization (cornification)63 and serve the purpose of protecting against physical and chemical stress factors.\n\nIncipient Keratinization\n\nElectron microscopy has shown that the ductal epithelium of normal meibomian glands contains keratohyalin granules in the apical cell layer of the rabbit and monkey.32 Although no obvious keratinization occurs in the normal human meibomian gland, recent histologic investigations (Knop E, et al. IOVS 2009;50:ARVO E-Abstract 4833) could verify that the whole epithelium of the central duct and ductules of the human meibomian gland also contains keratohyalin granules and hence preserves a commitment to keratinization. Thus, the meibomian gland can in principle be regarded as a “hair follicle without a hair shaft.”30\n\nMeibomian Gland Stem Cells and Cell Dynamics\n\nAs a special type of large sebaceous gland, the meibomian glands, unassociated with hairs, share certain principle rules of biology and cell dynamics with the more conventional hair-associated sebaceous glands of the skin. However, compared with the latter, the knowledge of basic information on stem cells and cell dynamics is very limited for the meibomian gland in general and in particular for the human. The same applies to another sebaceous gland without association to hairs, the preputial gland. Therefore, it is at present frequently necessary to consider more general phenomena of sebaceous gland biology in the skin, the validity of which is awaiting experimental proof for the meibomian gland.\n\nMeibocyte Generation and Migration\n\nAs a sebaceous gland, the meibomian gland produces its secretum (meibum) by the holocrine secretion mechanism. This means that the contents of the whole glandular cells form the meibum, as shown in A. After a process of maturation including lipid synthesis and accumulation, centripetal cell movement, and eventual cell degeneration and membrane disintegration, the lipids and other cell components are shed into the lumen of the ductal system. This holocrine secretion process hence results in the structural consequence that the whole secretory acinus is filled by secretory cells and in the dynamic consequence that secretory cells are continuously lost and replaced. This process is in distinct contrast to the merocrine secretion mode of the aqueous lacrimal gland, where only the secretory products are released from intact secretory cells.65 The continuous loss of acinar cells requires a consequent continuous production of new cells and therefore a continuous cell turnover and differentiation within the acinus. Even though it has long been assumed that the regeneration of the meibocytes arises from the peripheral layer of basal cells located on the basement membrane,66 in a way that is equivalent to the regeneration of other epithelial tissues from their basal layer,67 this was only proven in 2001 by Olami et al.36 A gradient in maturation, with more undifferentiated immature cells in the basal layer, has been observed by transmission electron microscopy in the mouse34 and the human35 meibomian gland and has also been indicated by histology.\n\nOlami et al.36 labeled dividing cells in the mouse meibomian gland with the radioactive nucleotide [3H]-thymidine, which is integrated as a marker into the nuclei during mitosis. They were able to show, after observation at different time points, that the labeled dividing cells were initially only found in the basal cell layer. At later time points, the number of labeled cells gradually increased, indicating basal cell mitosis and multiplication. Later, labeled cells were observed in locations closer to the center of the acinus, thus verifying the assumed centripetal movement of meibocytes. It has been calculated that in the mouse meibomian gland, the meibocytes have a generation time of 4.1 days between each division. Newly formed cells move from the basal layer at a velocity of 0.62 μm per day toward the center of the acinus and need approximately 9 days from their formation in the basal layer for their movement and eventual shedding in the center. These results36 showed for the first time the location of meibocyte progenitor cells in the basal cell layer, together with the constant and synchronous centripetal movement of their progeny. This movement explains the constant secretion of meibum, as observed by meibometry,44 and provides the basis for a previously assumed constant secretory force43 that, together with the muscular action46 of the orbicularis muscle on the outside of the tarsal plate and of Riolan's muscle around the terminal parts of the meibomian glands, leads to the delivery of the oil onto the posterior lid margin. It can be assumed that basic similar characteristics also apply to the human meibomian gland, but, since the human acinus is larger in diameter and is filled by more cells, the exact numerical values may be slightly different.\n\nMeibomian Gland Stem Cells\n\nOlami et al. concluded from their observations that the stem cells of the meibomian glands lie at the circumference of each acinus. There have been almost no investigations of stem cells in the meibomian gland to date, with the exception of Olami's work and one abstract (Lavker RM, et al. IOVS 2003;44:ARVO E-Abstract 3781). The latter group was concerned with meibomian gland stem cells in general and also reported that, after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or [3H]-thymidine, most of the rapidly cycling cells were seen in the “basal sebocytes,” which refers to the basal acinar meibocytes. However, these cells are not regarded as real stem cells which are defined as a slow-cycling cell population,68 similar to those in the corneal limbus69 –71 and skin,72 analogous to those defined in the hematopoietic system.73 Rather they are regarded as progenitor cells (transient amplifying [TA] cells). TA cells are daughters of the stem cells, with more rapid division but a limited further number of divisions and a restricted differentiation program,68 that eventually give rise to terminally differentiated cells. There were only a few if any slow-cycling stem cells observed in the acini (Lavker RM, et al. IOVS 2003;44:ARVO E-Abstract 3781), but most of the fast-cycling cells of the meibomian glands were located there.\n\nThe presence of fast-cycling TA cells in the basal acinar epithelium appears sufficient to explain the continuous generation of meibocytes, if it is additionally assumed that these basal cells are continuously replenished by the migration of young TA cells from a stem cell source outside the acinus. Similarly, the corneal epithelium is apparently maintained by the migration and division of TA cells that originate from the stem cell source at the limbus and can also remain intact after a prolonged time of limbal stem cell insufficiency.69 –71 The same applies to the skin epithelium, which is also regenerated by several generations of basal TA cells that originate from the stem cells located in the hair follicles68 or in interfollicular epidermal rete pegs.74\n\nSlow-cycling, and hence label retaining, putative stem cells have been found concentrated in the ductal epithelium of the meibomian gland (Lavker RM, et al. IOVS 2003;44:ARVO E-Abstract 3781). In addition, many of the cells “in the uppermost portion of the meibomian gland ductal epithelium” have show label dilution indicative of rapid dividing TA cells (Lavker RM, et al. IOVS 2003;44:ARVO E-Abstract 3781). Such highly proliferative cells also occurred farther out in the zone of the mucocutaneous junction on the inner lid margin.\n\nSimilarities to Hair Follicles.\n\nThis situation in the meibomian glands shows immediate similarity with the arrangement of stem cells and TA cells in the hair follicle—consistently downward with the lower hair root epithelium and upward with the skin epithelium. Cotsarelis et al.75 observed that, in the hair–skin unit, the slow-cycling putative stem cells are almost exclusively localized in a specific zone (the hair bulge) at about the middle of the hair follicles where the permanent upper part of the hair follicle ends and the arrector pili muscle inserts into the follicle. Later investigations by Taylor et al.68 confirmed the initial hypothesis that TA cells originate from slow-cycling cells in the hair-bulge zone and populate two different tissue compartments. From the differential location and cell-cycling characteristics it was concluded that they form (1) the lower hair follicle and also the hair shaft and (2) the epithelium of the upper hair follicle and the epidermis.\n\nIt was therefore concluded that the hair-bulge stem cells are bipotent, follow two distinct differentiation pathways, and are able to give rise to two different populations of TA cells that form either the hair or the epidermis ( ). The reported results of Lavker RM, et al. (IOVS 2003;44:E-Abstract 3781) in the meibomian gland share certain similarities with the situation observed earlier in the hair follicle.68,75 In addition to a slow-cycling stem cell zone in the epithelial lining of a canal (either of the hair follicle or of the meibomian duct) two regions of more rapidly cycling, differentiating TA cells occur. TA cells are located downstream (in either the lower hair follicle or in the acinus of the meibomian gland) and upstream (in either the upper hair follicle and lid margin epidermis on the outside or in the uppermost part of the meibomian gland duct and in the MCJ on the outside). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the renewal of the epithelial tissue by stem and TA cells follows a course in the meibomian gland similar to that in the hair follicle. A basic similarity between the hair follicles of the cilia and the meibomian glands, that would explain why hyperkeratinization is a typical pathology in MGD, is further validated by their similar structure and their joint embryologic development,26 –28 as reviewed in Knop et al.24\n\nCell Dynamics and Functional Compartments\n\nThe meibomian glands have conceivably at least three structural and functional domains ( ) that require a unique differentiation status maintained by differential regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. These are constituted by (1) the holocrine secretory compartment of the acini filled with the secretory meibocytes that produce the meibomian oil, (2) the tubular four-layered squamous ductal system that drains the oil, and (3) the uppermost (distal) part of the long central duct, the excretory duct, that delivers the oil onto the posterior lid margin and represents an extension of the multilayered cornified skin epithelium (epidermis).\n\nAt present it is unclear how the boundaries of such structural and functional compartments are established and maintained. It can be assumed that different receptors are expressed on the surface of cells in the excretory duct versus the ductal system versus the secretory meibocytes. Furthermore, a differential expression of proteins in the cytoplasm that are related to the differential maturation and function of these tissues can be assumed. Little detailed information on these assumptions is available today, even though microarray analyses by Sullivan, Schirra, and colleagues76 –81 have generated substantial data on the gene expression profiles of the meibomian glands in health and disease.\n\nCell Dynamics in Sebaceous Glands\n\nThe development of sebaceous glands, some of which are the meibomian glands, is governed by a hierarchy of factors: (1) A lineage commitment of undifferentiated stem cells into sebaceous gland stem cells is followed by (2) their proliferation and organization into a gland structure, which is completed by (3) the terminal differentiation of secretory cells inside the acinus and their functional lipid production.82,83 Each of these steps is governed by regulatory factors, the specificity and interaction of which is insufficiently resolved to date.\n\nLocation and Lineage Commitment of the Sebaceous Gland Stem Cells.\n\nEven though there is a relatively large body of literature on sebaceous glands, the formation of the sebaceous gland tissue from stem cells is still insufficiently understood. From Taylor et al.,68 it can be assumed that the subpopulation of hair-bulge stem cells that migrate upward to populate the epidermis also represent the stem cells for the hair-associated sebaceous glands that are located on the way from the bulge toward the epidermal surface. This notion is supported by studies in which it was found that isolated and transplanted hair-bulge stem cells can form all skin cell lineages and constitute the respective tissues (i.e., hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and epidermis).84,85 More recent results indicate that epidermal stem cells from regions between hair follicles (interfollicular epidermis) are also bipotent, similar to the hair-bulge stem cells,68 and form two lineages.86 One of them differentiates into epidermal cells that express keratinization markers, and the other differentiates into sebocytes under the influence of the transcription factor c-myc. Another study74 indicated multiple classes of stem cells are present in cutaneous epithelium, independent of the hair-bulge cells, and can contribute to the development of epidermal structures including hairs and sebaceous glands. This group also showed, by retroviral lineage tracing in the mouse, that in approximately one third of the labeled hair units, only the sebaceous gland was selectively labeled, which indicates the presence of a pool of long-lived, slow-cycling cells that conceivably represents a pool of lineage-specific glandular stem cells ( ). These presumed gland progenitors are located at the transition zone from the acinus to the hair follicle,74 and, in the same position, presumed mouse sebaceous gland–specific progenitors were later characterized by a transcription factor.82 This finding is in some contrast to the location of slow-cycling progenitors in the ductal epithelium of the mouse meibomian gland (Lavker RM, et al. IOVS 2003;44:E-Abstract 3781).87 Differences in the location of holocrine acinar stem cells may be related to the fact that the mouse hair–associated skin sebaceous glands apparently do not have a distinct connecting ductule, in contrast to the human hair sebaceous glands and the meibomian glands.\n\nAt present, it is thought that there are at least three independent stem cell populations in the skin88: the multipotent hair-bulge stem cells, for the cyclic reformation of the hair, and lineage-committed stem cells for the sebaceous glands and the interfollicular epidermis. In addition, there are isthmus-resident cells in the upper hair follicle close to the sebaceous gland. Under pathologic conditions such as wounding, the bulge stem cells become activated and can in fact replenish the sebaceous glands82 and the epidermis between the hair follicles.88\n\nDevelopment of Sebaceous Glands.\n\nThe transcription factor c-myc governs the expression of a large number of genes, including some that are essential for skin development. In skin, c-myc represents a kind of switch that determines the development of stem cells into keratinizing epidermal cells versus sebaceous gland cells. Increased expression of c-myc favors their differentiation into sebocytes.83 The differentiation of sebocytes can also be induced by c-myc activation in stem cells of the interfollicular epidermis between hair follicles.86\n\nThe further differentiation and proliferation of stem cells committed to sebaceous gland development is governed by the transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1), originally discovered as a factor that inhibits the further proliferation but promotes the differentiation of B-lymphocytes into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Experiments in the mouse showed that a loss of the Blimp1-positive gland progenitor cells at the transition from the acinus to the hair follicle sebaceous gland ( ) resulted in increased cell activity in the hair-bulge stem cell compartment and led to reformation of gland tissue, although in a hyperplasic state.74 From these observations it was concluded that the BLIMP1-positive cells represented the unipotent, lineage-committed progenitor cells that control the development and homeostasis of the sebaceous gland. A later study in the mouse and human, however, did not show that BLIMP1 distinguishes stem cells undergoing differentiation into sebaceous gland versus hair follicle versus interfollicular epidermal cells.86 Recently, it was observed that the BLIMP1 protein does in fact occur in all appendages of the skin including hair follicles, nail organs, sebaceous glands, and the epidermal granular layer, at least in the human.89 In addition, BLIMP1 protein was mainly found in the most mature cells; therefore, the authors concluded that BLIMP1 has a major role in terminal differentiation, including a central function in skin barrier homeostasis, as indicated by its presence in the epidermal granular layer.89 However, the function of BLIMP1 may be more complex, since in BLIMP1 knockouts, an increased cell division activity has been observed in the multipotent stem cells of the hair bulge, conceivably serving to replace the dysfunctional sebaceous gland cells. This occurrence results in a disturbance of sebaceous gland homeostasis with formation of enlarged, hyperplasic glands and an oily fur.82 Other regulatory factors also contribute to sebocyte differentiation and proliferation via the Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, and other signaling pathways.90 Hedgehog91 and Indian hedgehog92 signaling stimulates sebocyte proliferation, whereas their inhibition results in suppression of gland development.\n\nTerminal Maturation of Sebocytes.\n\nThe maturation of sebocytes within the sebaceous gland involves signaling by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), a member of the PPAR subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. It is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays an important role in the control of gene expression in a large number of tissues with lipid-producing cell types, even including keratinocytes,93 and is activated by fatty acids.94 PPARs regulate multiple lipid metabolic genes via PPAR response elements located in cell organelles, such as peroxisomes, microsomes, and mitochondria, which are involved in lipid metabolism.95 PPAR-γ is necessary for the differentiation of adipose tissue in vivo and in vitro.96 Signaling to PPAR-γ, (e.g., by long–chain fatty acids such as linoleic acid)97 initiates lipogenesis and the accumulation of large intracellular lipid droplets.98 PPAR-γ is also involved in the terminal differentiation of sebocytes in the non–hair-associated rat preputial gland.97 The growth and development of sebaceous glands is dependent on androgens, but they are not sufficient for the full maturation of the sebocytes, as dissected in cell culture experiments.99 Androgens appear to influence early steps of sebocyte differentiation, probably including the upregulation of PPAR-γ, whereas full differentiation and maturation of sebocytes, including the formation of the typical large lipid droplets, requires the action of PPAR-γ.97 Therefore, the action of androgens is related to but distinct from that of PPAR-γ. Still, in cell culture, the effects of dihydrotestosterone and the specific PPAR-γ ligand thiazolidinedione BRL-49653 were additive in increasing the lipidogenesis of rat preputial sebocytes,97 which points to the importance of sex hormones—in particular, androgens—in the regulation of sebaceous gland function.\n\nCell Differentiation and Dynamics in the Meibomian Gland\n\nMolecules that are involved in the differentiation and function of sebaceous glands are also present in the meibomian glands, as observed by Nien et al.87 BLIMP1 was described as a differentiation marker for the sebaceous lineage stem cells,82 but was observed later in the epidermis and basically in all skin appendages89 and was also found in the meibomian gland ductal system87 and in the luminal layers of the eye lid epidermis. The sebocyte differentiation marker PPAR-γ was also observed in mouse meibocytes. It showed an age dependence and changed from a cytoplasmic staining of basal cells of young animals, to cytoplasmic staining in most meibocytes of young adults, to a nuclear staining of all meibocytes in old animals.87 This rearrangement was paralleled by a decrease in acinar size and in lipid production, as verified by oil red O staining. Furthermore, in young and young adult animals, many of the basal acinar cells were recognized as proliferative by Ki67 staining, whereas the proliferation rate decreased in older animals. The noted absence of BLIMP1 from basal acinar cells may be explained by the recent finding that it does not represent a lineage marker for sebaceous stem cells, as originally assumed82 and does not discriminate between stem cells of different lineages in the mouse,86 but in fact occurs everywhere in the human epidermis.89\n\nThe terminal differentiation of meibocytes shares similarities with that of the secretory cells (sebocytes) of sebaceous glands, as can be assumed from their structure and function for lipid production. Intracellular lipids, after their synthesis via a PPAR-γ-dependent pathway, are maintained inside specialized compartments (lipid droplets) that contain the associated molecule adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP, or adipophilin) in their periphery.100 ADRP is an intrinsic lipid storage protein found in lipid droplets of different cell types and in all cells that produce lipids to any degree, from muscle cells to adipocytes. ADRP stimulates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids and its own expression is also upregulated101 by the presence of these fatty acids that represent a prominent component in the meibomian oil (Green-Church KB, et al. IOVS 2009;50:ARVO E-Abstract 533).102 –105 ADRP has been described in rat meibomian gland tissue by Northern and Western blot analysis and by immunohistochemistry.106 The latter showed ADRP localization at the margins of the lipid droplets with a generally higher level of expression in the more mature meibocytes located toward the center of the acinus in situ and in more mature cells in the cell culture of isolated meibocytes. ADPR was hence suggested to be a differentiation marker for mature meibocytes.\n\nRelation of Stem Cells to Meibomian Gland Disease\n\nDefects in stem cell formation and their migration may contribute to MGD and disease. This assumption is mainly based on observations in cutaneous hair-associated sebaceous glands, but also on findings in the meibomian glands itself.\n\nIn the skin, these defects are relevant (e.g., in the onset of acne107 and sebaceous cancer).108 Related diseases also occur in the meibomian gland in the form of hyperkeratinizing seborrheic conditions7,109,110 and cancers of the meibomian gland tissue.111\n\nAlterations of sebaceous glands can occur on all levels of development, from commitment to stem cell lineage, to gland tissue formation, to terminal sebocyte maturation inside the acini, as discussed by Horsley et al.82 Overexpression of the basal transcription factor c-myc, which acts as a kind of switch between the developmental directions into epidermis versus sebaceous gland formation, favors sebaceous gland hyperplasia,112 which conceivably results in primary seborrhea. BLIMP1, a more downstream transcription factor that represses c-myc and inhibits further proliferation but stimulates the differentiation of progenitor cells,113 is essential for lineage determination of sebaceous gland stem cells.114,115 Disturbance of sebaceous gland homeostasis due to loss of BLIMP1-positive, gland-committed progenitors can result in excessive repair processes with formation of enlarged, hyperplastic glands and seborrhea.82 The terminal maturation of sebocytes inside the acinus is maintained by PPAR-γ, which is a key factor for all lipid-producing cells.98 Cells with deficiency of PPAR, such as knockout cells, can only poorly contribute to the formation of secretory acini.96 In line with this observation in sebaceous glands may be the finding that the expression pattern of PPAR-γ gradually redistributes from a cytoplasmic location in young and young adult mice to a nuclear location in old mice. This change in location is paralleled by development of acinar atrophy with a decrease in the size of the acini in general and of the lipid droplets within individual meibocytes in particular.87 A lack of PPAR-γ could therefore contribute to potential age-related atrophic processes of the meibomian gland. Agonists and antagonists of PPAR-γ can modulate the function of sebaceous glands and may also provide potential therapeutic approaches.87\n\nIn wounding conditions, stem cell differentiation tends to develop a higher degree of plasticity,74 and the lineage commitment can switch, leading to a replacement of altered or lost progenitor cells.82,88 This process may also apply to events observed in MGD that may exert stress on the cells, such as that due to stasis with downstream mechanical pressure stress in obstruction or due to increased bacterial growth and downstream release of bacterial lipases, toxic mediators, or inflammatory mediators. Stem cell–based repair mechanisms, however, do not always result in intact tissue reconstruction but can lead to alterations in structure and function. This alteration can result in hyperplastic acini with increased lipid production82 that could contribute to the pathogenesis of MGD, as similarly described in the pathogenesis of acne,107 but it may also be involved in the development of meibomian gland cancer.111\n\nLipid Synthesis in Meibomian Glands\n\nOverview\n\nThere are few studies on lipid synthesis or uptake in the meibomian gland. A primary reason for the scant number of studies is that information about which lipids are synthesized has been lacking. Meibomian lipid characterization has reached a point where it may now be possible to identify those lipid synthetic pathways that lead to very long fatty acids. Science remains challenged, however, in that not all animal models would produce the same lipid mixtures as humans, and because the energy needs and hormonal stimulation needed for lipid production are not fully understood. Enormous amounts of energy are required to add two carbons to a growing lipid chain (1ATP, 2NADPH; 16C palmitic acid requires 7ATP plus 14NADPH). For this to occur, the meibocytes need both a sufficient supply of oxygen and a reliable carbon source. Although the basal cells in the acini have access to oxygen from capillaries, as the cells mature, they continually plump up with lipids, and they distance themselves from the capillaries ( ). Both glucose (the typical carbon source) and oxygen do not diffuse well through lipids—hence, the conundrum as to how these resources are supplied to the maturing acinar cells. In mature meibocytes according to Jester et al.32 “the mitochondria are shrunken and electron-dense.” In contrast, Gorgas and Völkl34 have not reported any degeneration of mitochondria in mature meibocytes but only the presence of osmophilic, dense inclusion bodies that occur in all stages of meibocyte differentiation. Despite this, the cells fill with lipids; therefore, the resources for producing the lipids must be accessible to the central acinar cells. It remains unclear whether this process occurs via transport or diffusion.\n\nThere are also questions about hormonal regulation of the lipid production process, because insulin and glucagon are typically involved with fat and sugar metabolism. They are water soluble and would have little access to the maturing acinar cells. By contrast, steroid hormones (particularly androgens) are known to influence the acinar cells, and their lipid solubility would give them access to the maturing acinar cells. In addition to the synthesis of meibomian lipids, the ultrastructure of meibocytes indicates that there are special features of stacked membrane arrays and peroxisomes, which means that these cells must also have the machinery to synthesize polar lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, for synthesis of their internal membranes. There remains the possibility, however, that some of these polar lipids and others, such as (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids, are specifically synthesized for secretion. Before the puzzle of how the synthesis of these lipids is controlled versus those specifically destined for secretion can be systematically considered, a consensus must be reached on the composition of normal meibomian secretions. It is also highly likely that some of the enzymes associated with the lipid synthesis are membrane bound, which makes them difficult to study. Immunohistochemical studies may resolve this dilemma, because they will help determine the compartmentalization of the enzymes—an important factor, in that enzyme location is an indication of the end destination of the lipids. Unfortunately, no easily accessible primer text about the biochemical pathways has been published to date.\n\nThe most abundant components of the meibomian lipids are wax and sterol esters, consisting of fatty acids and fatty alcohols, long-chain (>20C) fatty acids and alcohols, and sterols, particularly cholesterol. The most abundant fatty acid is oleic acid, which has 18C and is monounsaturated (18:1(cisΔ9), which means it has 18C with the ninth bond being a cis double bond. Wax esters are formed by condensation of fatty alcohols with fatty acids, and sterol esters are formed by condensation of sterols with fatty acids.103,116 Theoretically, these lipid components could either be synthesized de novo in the acinar cells or taken up from the bloodstream or both. The evidence for de novo synthesis is supported because the synthetic enzymes for the components and the transesterases to form the final products have been detected either directly or indirectly (mRNA) in the acinar cells.77,81,117 There is no direct evidence to date that the lipids are taken up from the bloodstream (this does not refer to steroid hormones, which are lipids, being taken up by the acinar cells as part of their hormonal action) and this is an area that warrants further investigations. Such uptake could show variations in lipid composition with change in diet, and the plasma cholesterol levels warrant further investigation relative to the cholesterol118 or cholesterol esters in tear fluid or meibomian secretions. Recently, patients with blepharitis and taking flaxseed oil (omega-3) showed no difference in omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, total monounsaturated, poly, or monounsaturated fatty acids, despite levels of omega-3 fatty acids being higher in the blood.119 And if diet is important, it would not explain how the meibomian lipids of koalas, which have a very restricted and specific lipid dietary intake (sole diet of eucalyptus leaves), have a lipid profile similar to other mammals (Butovich IA, Millar TJ. IOVS 2009;50:ARVO E-Abstract 2545). However, a correlation has been shown between polar lipid profiles and variations in diet in women with Sjögren's syndrome; that is, those with a single polar lipid peak after HPLC analysis had about double the intake of omega-3 fatty acids compared with those who had multiple polar lipid peaks.120 Therefore, it is most likely that all the lipids secreted by the meibomian glands are synthesized by the gland and we must understand fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, the key enzymes involved in these pathways, and in which cellular compartments they are located.\n\nA Skeletal Overview of Lipid Synthesis\n\nFatty acid synthesis catalyzed by fatty acid synthase occurs in the cytoplasm, but the carbons come from the mitochondria ( ). Therefore, mitochondria are necessary, not only for generating the large amounts of energy needed for lipid synthesis, but also for the carbons of lipids. This fact is enigmatic in the context of meibomian glands, where the more mature acinar cells continue to plump up with lipids, but at the same time their mitochondrial number decrease, and they are further displaced from their oxygen source.\n\nFatty Acid Synthesis\n\nThe carbon chain of the fatty acids is built two carbons at a time after repeated enzymatic cycles. As part of this process, the acetyl-CoA has to be activated to a higher energy level. This activation is induced by adding carbon dioxide to it to form malonyl-CoA ( ). With each cycle of fatty acid synthesis, two new carbons from malonyl-CoA are added to the chain, and the third carbon is released as CO2 ( ). With each cycle, through several different reactions catalyzed by different domains of the enzyme fatty acid synthase, two reductions occur, each of which converts one NADPH to NADP. Each of these steps is about the same as consuming three ATPs. The result is an even-numbered fatty acid, typically 16C long (palmitic acid), which is cleaved from the enzyme by a thiolase. Many of the fatty acids in the meibomian gland are much longer than 16C, and the further elongation requires different enzymes. If an odd-numbered straight-chain fatty acid is to be synthesized, propionyl-CoA (4C) is initially used as the carbon source instead of malonyl-CoA, and when CO2 is displaced, three carbons are added to the chain, resulting in an odd-numbered fatty acid.\n\nStraight-Chain Fatty Acids.\n\nFor chain elongation, the palmitoyl component of palmitoyl ACP is transferred to coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to form palmitoyl-CoA. Then, elongation (C18–C28) occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum,121 and some of these are converted by additional enzymes into fatty alcohols. The elongation process occurs in the same way as described above, except that in this case, CoA is the carrier. Two new carbons are loaded from malonyl-CoA onto palmitoyl-CoA, followed by reduction, dehydration, and reduction to form the new saturated chain extended by 2C. In forming the most prominent fatty acid in meibomian gland secretions, oleic acid, the palmitic acid (16C), has to be elongated and then desaturated. Fatty acyl-CoA desaturase catalyzes the introduction of a double bond into the acyl chain (bond 9 of stearic acid), to form oleic acid. This oxidation occurs on the inner face of the endoplasmic reticulum and involves coupled electron transfers through cytochrome-b5, FADH2, and NADPH, which is converted to NADP+. This enzyme in mammals readily desaturates the bond between C9 and C10 but does not desaturate the bonds between C10 and the terminal methyl group. Fatty acids with desaturation between C10 and the terminal such as linoleic acid (18:2; all-cisΔ9,12) and linolenic acid (18:3; all-cisΔ9,12,15) are normally obtained from the diet. These fatty acids have been detected in human meibomian gland secretions, albeit in small amounts.122 One possibility is that there are additional desaturase enzymatic activities in the meibomian gland that are able to desaturate ω-3 or ω-6 bonds in C18 fatty acids. One example of such enzymatic activity is the product of the gene fat-1, which has been found in animals.123 These desaturases are membrane bound and probably require other membrane-linked cofactors, such as cytochrome-b5 for their activity. The presence of large numbers of ordered peroxisomes in more mature cells in the meibomian gland acini34 may be the location of these enzymes, but this still has to be demonstrated. That these enzymes are membrane bound means that they are very difficult to purify, and therefore searching for their gene expression is more likely to reveal their presence. Another important highlight of plant membrane-bound desaturases is that they use glycerolipids as their substrates and not acyl-CoA. The presence of this substrate is also likely to be the case for similar desaturases (e.g., FAT-1), if they exist, in meibomian glands. This notion implies that the carbon chain source would be from the membrane lipids of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nBranched-Chain Fatty Acids.\n\nSome branched-chain fatty acids have been detected as components of meibomian lipids.116,124,125 It appears from studies of rabbit meibomian glands, with the use of radioactive labeled precursors, that the branched carbon chain is supplied from branched side-chain amino acids. In rabbits, isoleucine has been used predominantly in vivo, whereas, in vitro, valine has also been used. In neither case has leucine been used as a precursor.126 For these, the incorporation must have been at the initial loading of the acyl carrier domain of fatty acid synthase, because the branched fatty acids were either iso- or anteiso-branched (at the omega end of the carbon chain). Since the new chain grows from the carboxyl end, if incorporation were not at initiation, there would be multiple branching along the length of the chain. Similarly, if it were incorporated after the initial synthesis of palmitic acid, the extension phase for longer chain fatty acids, they would also occur randomly and possibly as multiple branched methyl groups near the carboxyl end, but this is not the case. Whether the preference order for the amino acid precursors for branched-chain fatty acids is the same in other animals as it is in rabbits still has to be established.\n\nFatty Alcohols.\n\nFatty alcohols are synthesized from their corresponding fatty acids. The fatty acid component of acyl CoA is reduced to form the corresponding fatty alcohol (acyl-CoA reductase).127,128 Whether the cofactor in the meibomian gland is NADPH or NADH is not known, but two high-energy compounds are consumed in the reaction. In the meibomian gland, there appears to be a preference for long-chain fatty acids, because long-chain fatty alcohols seem to be the predominant species found to be associated with cholesterol and wax esters. This association may come about because of an enzymatic preference for longer chain fatty acids or because the shorter chain fatty acids are preferentially used for the acid component of wax esters or (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids.122 The location of the fatty alcohols could be in the peroxisomes,34 whereas in other tissues they are involved in making ether bonds (condensation of two alcohols), but in this case it would be likely that they form ester bonds with fatty acids to form the wax esters.\n\nCholesterol Synthesis.\n\nAn overview of cholesterol synthesis is that all 27C compounds come from acetic acid, in the form of acetyl-CoA. As above, the acetyl component of acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm via citrate ( ). It is then converted to HMG-CoA ( ), which is converted to mevalonate ( ). This reaction is catalyzed by HMG reductase, which is activated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon. Therefore, it would be of interest to examine the composition of meibomian lipids from patients with uncontrolled diabetes, as in theory, this critical enzyme would have decreased activity, and hence less cholesterol would be synthesized. Mevalonate is converted to a 5C compound, isopentenyl pyrophosphate ( , ). Three of these are joined to form a 15C compound—farnesyl pyrophosphate—and two farnesyl pyrophosphates are joined to form a 30C compound, squalene ( ). Squalene is cyclized to form lanosterol, and three methyl groups are then removed to form cholesterol.\n\nThe mRNAs for the enzymes associated with this pathway have been identified in mouse meibomian gland extracts, and most of them are increased by testosterone, which is an indication that this pathway is upregulated by testosterone.77,121 This suggestion is supported by the histochemical detection of various hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases in meibomian gland acinar cells. These enzymes were located in developing and mature, but not basal, acinar cells of the meibomian gland.129 These enzymes are not found in all sebaceous glands, but are associated with sebaceous glands of the face and neck.130,131 In sebaceous glands, the levels of these enzymes decrease with age, which does not seem to be the case with meibomian glands. Perra et al.56 did not mention this, even though samples were taken from 18- to 60-year-olds. In terms of function, the enzymes are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are able to catalyze the conversion of androgens into their potent metabolic forms, particularly dihydrotestosterone, which is associated with upregulation of gene transcription for enzymes associated with fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, as well as other functions associated with lipid metabolism.\n\nOther Synthetic Pathways\n\nTriglycerols have also been reported to be components of meibomian lipids. The pathway for synthesis of triglycerols involves having one of the intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, converted to glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which uses NADH as the hydrogen source. Acyl transferases sequentially catalyze the transfer of acyl groups from acyl-CoA to C1 and then C2 of the glycerol 3-phosphate to form phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol, which is then converted to triacylglycerol by transfer of an acyl group from acyl-CoA (acyl transferase).\n\nThe suggestion and, more recently, the detection of (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids33,121 means that ω-hydroxy fatty acids must be synthesized in the meibomian glands. The enzymatic pathway for ω-hydroxy fatty acids is not known. At this stage, only long-chain ω-hydroxy fatty acids have been detected, which tends to indicate that the hydroxylation occurs at the end of acyl chain synthesis, not at the beginning. Hydroxylation of an inert terminal methyl group would be very unusual and normally needs several intermediates. Such intermediates have yet to be detected. However, many of these compounds, which may be in low amounts, would be undetected unless specifically sought.\n\nCholesterol esters tend to have long-chain (>C20) fatty acids attached to them,132 which indicates that the cholesterol transacylase(s) involved prefer long-chain acids. This preference differs from that of the wax acyl-CoA:alcohol transacylases, which do not appear to be specific for chain lengths.125 The (O-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids tend to have long-chain ω hydroxyl fatty acids (C30:1, C32:1, and C34:1) acetylated through their ω-hydroxyls by a C18:1-FA,132 which indicates that the transacylases may be very specific.\n\nComments on the Synthesis of Lipids in Meibomian Glands\n\nVascular Supply.\n\nFat synthesis needs both energy and an excellent blood supply as the source of its oxygen. This necessity is reflected in adipose tissue development, where lipocyte density correlates positively with capillary density, and the cells tend to cluster around large blood vessels.133 Examination of the published literature on the structure of the meibomian gland and structural studies of meibomian gland development have not paid particular attention to capillary size and density. Although this may not be particularly essential in development, a study of the capillaries could be of benefit in understanding the aging process, in which gland atrophy has been noted. Local swelling, such as occurs when there is a blockage of the meibomian gland duct, may also lead to poor blood flow and atrophy of the glands. In other fat cells, angiogenesis factors such as PGE2 (ubiquitous) and l-butyrylglycerol (specific to fat cells) are synthesized and secreted by adipocytes. To date, secretion of these factors by meibocytes has not been investigated.\n\nThe predominant source of energy in these synthetic pathways is NADPH, typically produced by a side path of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway. Key enzymes associated with this pathway (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) have been detected in the differentiating and degenerating cells of human meibomian glands, but not in the basal cells. The need for this pathway means that, to produce lipids, meibocytes require a rich supply of glucose and therefore depend heavily on insulin and a rich blood supply for glucose uptake. Insulin also stimulates lipid synthesis (many kinases that control activation of lipid synthetic enzymes are sensitive to insulin). Similarly, glucocorticoids have been long known to increase adipose tissue mass via their hypertrophic effect. A clinical method of testing this hypothesis would be the assessment of the meibomian glands that are altered in patients who have Cushing's syndrome or are receiving cortisol treatment.\n\nThe membranes between acinar cells are particularly and unusually interdigitated35 and could be a region of cytoplasmic exchange. On the positive side, published micrographs also show, on casual inspection, that there is a concentration of mitochondria around lipid droplets that is consistent with the molecules that come from the mitochondria being a carbon source for the new lipids.32 Similarly, some lipid droplets are surrounded by organized concentric layers of endoplasmic reticulum. This arrangement is consistent with the enzymes associated with fatty acyl chain elongation and oxidation (formation of double bonds) occurring in these regions. It may also mean that, at this stage, different lipids are in different lipid droplets, but it probably has no impact at the end, when the cells disintegrate as part of the holocrine secretion.\n\nProteins and the Meibomian Gland\n\nThere is emerging evidence that specific lipoproteins134 or other proteins (Thangavelu M, et al. IOVS 2010;51:ARVO E-Abstract 2373) may be associated with meibomian lipids. There has been a study on adipose differentiation-related protein, a protein that marks the differentiation of adipose tissue.106 This protein seemed to localize adjacent to the lipid droplets and, in micrographs, appeared to be present at lower levels in the most mature cells in the follicle. The low magnification made this difficult to ascertain. Lipocalin has also been found in human meibomian gland secretions,134 and hence it is possible that this lipocalin also sequesters lipids. It may originate from the meibomian gland, given that lipocalin mRNA has been identified in the mouse meibomian gland.81,135\n\nPhysical Properties of Meibomian Lipids\n\nThe transition temperature from a solid to a liquid for meibomian lipids is actually a range, 28°C to 32°C, because of the mixture of lipids. This transition has been explained by the arrangement of lipids from their transconformation (ordered and rigid) to their gauche conformation (disordered and fluid), as evidenced by infrared spectroscopy.136 The temperature of the eyelids will therefore affect the liquidity of meibomian lipids and hence their viscosity. In liquids, viscosity (η) is a measure of resistance to flow at a particular temperature. In substances that exhibit Newtonian viscosity, if the force is doubled, the flow rate doubles, and hence the resistance to flow (viscosity) remains the same. Other substances alter their viscosity (non-Newtonian) depending on the force applied. (A good example is toothpaste, which is very viscous when sitting on a toothbrush, but flows easily out of a tube when force is applied.) This phenomenon is called shear thinning. Tiffany and Dart137 have reported the viscosity of human meibomian lipid samples to vary between 9.7 and 19.5 Pa · s, (cf. honey, 10 Pa · s; glycerine, 1 Pa · s; olive oil, 0.1 Pa · s; and water, 1 mPa · s), depending on the force applied. Therefore, the viscosity of meibomian lipids exhibits non-Newtonian behavior. The temperature at which the viscosity was measured in these experiments was not indicated, but considering the data, it is likely that it was below the transition temperature (30°C). In a practical sense, these data represent the viscosity of the meibomian secretion sitting in the ducts. Blinking would apply shearing force that would lower the viscosity, making the lipids easier to eject from the meibomian orifices. This shearing force would be increased by having narrow openings in comparison to the diameter of the duct (as anatomic studies indicate is the case), and this effect would also reduce the viscosity. A lower viscosity would also occur because the temperature of the eyelid (35°C–37°C) would be above the transition temperature. In the same experiments, the viscosity of lipids extracted from chalazion secretions were so high that only one measurement, despite heating to 70°C, could be made, and that was 69.9 Pa · s. This material contained more phospholipids, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides than do normal meibomian lipids.\n\nViscosity measurements on thin films are complex, and several different experimental parameters, such as frequency and amplitude of shear forces and surface pressure of the film, are varied to come up with appropriate measures of viscosity.138 –140 Films made from human meibomian lipids show increasing viscosity (complex viscosity) with surface pressure and attain a viscosity of 1 mPa · s at a surface pressure of approximately 25 mN/m, dropping to 0.1 mPa · s at 35°C, at a shear frequency of 6.2 rads−1.141\n\nThe refractive index of meibomian lipids varies between 1.46 and 1.53 per the visible spectrum, with a small, relatively linear decrease over a temperature range from 25°C to 45°C. The refractive index of human skin lipids is approximately 0.013 less. This high refractive index probably has little overall refractive influence over a pure air–water interface because the lipid layer is very thin.142\n\nAlthough there seems to be an abundance of lipids available on the eyelid margins (300 μg) compared with the amount of lipids estimated to be in the lipid layer of the tear film (9 μg),48 we still do not know what enables them to spread from the reservoir across the ocular surface to form a film. There is indirect evidence that a bigger reservoir of lipids on the eyelid margins leads to a thicker lipid layer. The amount of lipids is higher on the eyelid margins just after waking,45 and there is a thicker oil film on the eye surface in the morning.143 A surfactant is needed for lipids to spread across an aqueous surface. In the absence of a surfactant, the lipids form lenses on the surface. One of the main questions about meibomian lipids centers on what enables them to spread. Holly144 proposed that this could be achieved by an initial spread of polar lipids over the aqueous surface followed by nonpolar lipids. However, it is most likely that the lipid film is not respread on each blink, but instead collapses and expands, as indicated by the same interference patterns seen over multiple blinks; only after this is a new layer formed. What conveys these properties is still not understood and whether proteins from the aqueous layer become part of this outer layer of the tear film, as some models suggest, still has to be demonstrated. Conversely, there is also no evidence they are not part of this outer layer.\n\nRegulation of the Meibomian Gland in Health and Disease\n\nSebaceous glands are present throughout the body and are classified into two major types: pilosebaceous, which are associated with hair follicles, and free (i.e., preputial and meibomian), which occur in the transitional zone between the skin and mucous membranes.145 An extensive amount of information is known about sebaceous glands, and a review of their physiological regulation in health and disease would be challenging. More than 6000 articles have been published about these glands since 1904, and numerous factors are known to modulate the development, proliferation, differentiation, maturation, lipogenesis, and secretion of sebaceous glands throughout the body ( ). These factors include sex steroids, corticosteroids, hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, insulin, retinoids, thyroxine, melanocortins, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands ( ).40,98,145 –156 The control points for sebaceous gland regulation often involve effects on gene expression, protein synthesis, and lipid production. There appear to be considerable differences in the control mechanisms, however, as well as in the lipid composition, of sebaceous glands between species and between different types of sebaceous glands.145\n\nTable 1.\n\nFactorGrowthLipid ProductionAdrenocorticotropic hormone↑Androgen↑↑Basic fibroblast growth factor↑Calcitonin gene-related peptideRRCorticotropin-releasing hormone↑↑Epidermal growth factor↑Estrogen↓↓Growth hormone↑Hydrocortisone↑Insulin↑Insulin-like growth factor-I↑Insulin-like growth factor-II↑Keratinocyte growth factor↑Neuropeptide YRRPeroxisome proliferator activated receptor ligands↑Pituitary extract (bovine)↑Progestin∼Retinoid↓↓Substance P↑↑Thyroid-stimulating hormone↑Thyroxine↓↑Transforming growth factor-α↑Vasoactive intestinal peptideRRα-Melanocyte stimulating hormone↑↑β-Adrenergic agonistPermissiveβ-Endorphin↓↑\n\nIn contrast to sebaceous glands in general, there is relatively little information about the physiological regulation of the meibomian gland. Fewer than 850 articles about the meibomian gland have been published in the past 106 years ( ), and fewer than 50 of these papers, including reviews, address the topic of physiological control. The paucity of studies is astonishing, given that recent research has demonstrated the presence of more than 270 receptor mRNAs in the mouse meibomian gland alone ( ). Yet it is unknown whether most of these transcripts are translated and functional. Of particular interest is the lack of knowledge about the neural influence on the meibomian gland. This tissue is the only sebaceous gland in the human body that has rich sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic innervation,145 including contact with nerve fibers reactive for acetylcholinesterase, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, dopamine β-hydroxylase, nitric oxide synthase, tyrosine hydroxylase, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and CGRP.39,56,57,59,81,157 –169 Further, the meibomian gland contains mRNAs for serotonin, adrenergic, CGRP, cholinergic, dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, NPY, neurotensin, and somatostatin receptors ( ).81 It is entirely unclear, however, whether neurotransmitters are released in the vicinity of the meibomian gland, act on glandular receptors, or induce a physiological effect.\n\nTable 2.\n\nTopicNumber of Articles% of

the effects of androgens, estrogens, progestins, all-trans retinoic acid, and growth factors on this tissue and/or its epithelial cells. This topic is discussed in the following sections.\n\nAndrogens\n\nAndrogen Regulation of Sebaceous Glands.\n\nAndrogens exert a significant impact on the meibomian gland.81 This influence is not surprising, given that androgens control the development, differentiation, and lipid production of sebaceous glands throughout the body.40,81,145,146,148,151,153,156,170 –188 Androgens act primarily on acinar epithelial cells in sebaceous glands, and these cells contain both androgen receptor mRNA and protein (in their nuclei). Acinar cells respond to androgens by increasing the transcription of multiple genes and synthesizing proteins that augment both the elaboration and secretion of lipids. Sebaceous gland activity and secretion may be inhibited by orchiectomy or topical antiandrogen treatment.182,189 –192 Of particular interest, sebaceous gland function declines with age.193 This aging-associated dysfunction has been correlated with both an atrophy of acinar epithelial cells and a decrease in serum androgen levels.193 Indeed, the age-related cellular shrinkage in certain sebaceous glands has been directly correlated with a reduction in androgen levels in the surrounding skin.193\n\nAndrogen activity in sebaceous glands is significantly influenced by the activity of certain enzymes, particularly 5α-reductase (converts testosterone into the potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone), aromatase (converts testosterone to 17β-estradiol, androstenedione to estrone), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD; regulates the interconversion of 17-ketosteroids with their corresponding 17β-hydroxysteroids and is necessary for the intracrine formation and/or inactivation of all active androgens and estrogens in sebaceous glands).194 –200 These enzymes are vital, given that most of the androgens and estrogens in humans are synthesized in peripheral tissues (e.g., sebaceous glands) from adrenal sex steroid precursors (i.e., dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] and DHEA-sulfate) and that these enzymes regulate the critical steroidogenic pathways ( ).194 –197 Of interest, the activity of these enzymes may vary according to sex, tissue location in the body, or cellular position within a pilosebaceous unit and may also be induced by microenvironmental factors (e.g., proinflammatory cytokines).200 –203\n\nAndrogens also regulate numerous pathways of lipid metabolism. For instance, depending on the tissue, androgens control:\n\nthe induction of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, including fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase, malic enzyme, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyl transferase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and FAR-17c;\n\nfatty acid saturation and branching;\n\nthe incorporation of fatty acids into neutral lipids and phospholipids;\n\nthe content of total lipids, neutral lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides, and neutral glycosphingolipids;\n\nthe secretion rate of wax esters and various other lipids; and\n\nIn addition, androgens stimulate the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that play an important role in the coordinate regulation of lipogenic enzymes.215 –218,220,221\n\nAndrogen Regulation of the Meibomian Gland.\n\nAndrogens regulate the meibomian gland and modulate gene expression and lipid production within this tissue.77,81,117,222 –225 These hormonal actions appear to be mediated, at le"
