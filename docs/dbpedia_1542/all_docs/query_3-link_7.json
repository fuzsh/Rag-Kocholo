        "text": "At the end of \"Toy Story 3,\" a college-bound Andy takes a box of his old childhood toys, including Rex, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and Slinky Dog, to the home of Bonnie. Earlier in the film, Woody winds up lost at the little girl's home decides she would make a good future owner for Andy's toys in place of being put in the attic.\n\nAndy drives over to Bonnie's house and introduces all of his toys to the little girl under one condition.\n\n\"I'm going away now. I need someone really special to play with them,\" Andy told Bonnie of his toy collection. \"You've gotta promise to take good care of these guys. They mean a lot to me.\"\n\nAfter showing all of his toys to Bonnie, the little girl finds Woody at the bottom of the box and yells out, \"My cowboy.\" Andy never planned to give away Woody, his first favorite toy. Instead, Woody jumped into the box with his friends.\n\n\"Woody, what's he doing in there?\" Andy asks aloud as he holds the toy.\n\nAs Bonnie goes to reach out for him, Andy recoils. Woody wasn't supposed to be in there, and it seems as if he's considering to tell Bonnie that.\n\nHowever, when Andy sees the sad look on Bonnie's face, he takes a long moment, sighs, and then changes his mind.\n\n\"Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember,\" Andy tells Bonnie. \"He's brave, like a cowboy should be, and kind and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is that he'll never give up on you, ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what.\"\n\nAndy asks Bonnie if she thinks she'll be able to take care of Woody for him and she nods her head yes. The teenager hands over his beloved doll and then the two spend the afternoon playing one last time together with his old toys.\n\nAs Andy bids farewell, Bonnie waves Woody's little hand goodbye and it hits Andy right in the feels. Before he drives off, Andy whispers to himself, \"Thanks guys.\"\n\nSo it's incredibly frustrating that at the start of \"Toy Story 4,\" we see that Bonnie's not keeping good on her word to Andy. Sure, she's playing with the other toys. But Woody? During playtime, she has repeatedly chosen not to play with him. At one point, Bonnie takes the sheriff's star off of Woody to put it on Jessie and play with her instead. How rude.\n\nInstead, Woody's been discarded in the closet, left to collect dust bunnies alongside a few other toys and objects like an elephant and a play chair.\n\nA look over the \"Toy Story 4\" soundtrack shows the score for when Woody's in the closet is called \"Woody's Closet of Neglect.\" The song contains a piece of \"When She Loved Me,\" the song in \"Toy Story 2\" from Jessie's flashback where the cowgirl was abandoned.\n\nBonnie only starts playing with Woody later in the movie when he's inseparable from Forky, an arts and crafts creation Bonnie makes at kindergarten orientation, who doesn't accept the fact that he's a toy.\n\nYes, Bonnie's 4-to-5-year-old little girl. She probably doesn't remember the promise she made to Andy.\n\nI get it. Kids get over toys.\n\nBut not Andy. This kid held onto his most beloved childhood toys until he was heading off to college before deciding to part with all of them, except for Woody. He didn't want to give Woody away unless he was assured Bonnie was really going to look after him and love him the way he did for about two decades.\n\nAnd she didn't. By the film's end, Woody, a toy who Andy says is so loyal that he'll \"never give up on you, ever,\" decides to part ways with Bonnie. He ditches his owner, who he feels has forgotten him, for a lifetime of being a lost toy with Bo Peep.\n\nIn the end, everyone's happy, though Buzz and the rest of Andy's toys are a bit sad to see him go. But if Andy knew what had become of Woody, he would have been a bit upset."
