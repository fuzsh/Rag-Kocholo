        "text": "An early design for everyone’s favourite cowboy Woody has been revealed – and he’s hardly rootin’, or tootin’.\n\nIn fact, the clay bust of the Toy Story hero looks downright creepy, with heavy eyelids, a down-turned mouth and a long nose.\n\nHe also has a puppet’s movable jaw and his sherriff’s badge sits below his chin rather than on his waistcoat.\n\nThis bust was made for an earlier version of the movie, but by 1995 Pixar settled on the design below.\n\nThe eyes still look a bit odd because Woody’s pupils were added digitally.\n\nThe early model’s less friendly appearance is down to two reasons. Firstly, the character was originally a ventriloquist dummy.\n\nWhen studio bosses decided that the dummy version looked sneaky and distrustful he was changed to a stuffed cowboy doll, but the pull-string remained.\n\nSecondly, Woody was actually a complete arse in the first draft of the film’s scripts.\n\nMORE : Toy Story is 20: The 20 best toy characters in the Toy Story movies\n\nIn an early version of the film which was only half recorded, Woody’s vindictive behaviour drives the other toys in Andy’s room to rebellion.\n\nDisney bosses hated this story arc and insisted the production was shut down to allow for a full rewrite.\n\nThis meant we got the cheery, brave all-round good guy (albeit with some insecurities) we all know and love. Phew.\n\nMORE : QUIZ: Can you name the Toy Story movie from the picture?\n\nMind you, if Disney had got their way on every aspect of Toy Story, the film would have been a musical.\n\nToy Story began as a 1988 short film by John Lasseter called Tin Toy, which tells the story of a tiny soldier toy trying to escape a violent baby.\n\nIt almost became a short for TV called A Tin Story Christmas in the early nineties but due to a lack of funding it never got made.\n\nAnd weirdly, Buzz Lightyear used to be called Lunar Larry. You wouldn’t go to infinity and beyond with someone called Larry.\n\nLast month Toy Story celebrated its 20th anniversary, which will make everyone everywhere feel really bloody old.\n\nToy Story 4 is currently on course for release in June 2018, by which time we’ll be so old we’ll need AA batteries to keep us going."
