        "text": "It’s Sunday, March 24, at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, where the films of 2001 will be honored over the course of a record-breaking four hours and 23 minutes. (Dear God.) Yes, this is the longest Oscar ceremony in history, though one with moments worthy of its length. Perhaps as a small mercy—to me, anyway—the recording I’m primarily working off of doesn’t include the red-carpet segment of the evening. Which means I will be blessedly saved that time.\n\nOh, wait, no, never mind: I found some of the Joan Rivers E! stuff on YouTube.\n\nFirst up, there’s Sharon Stone with her then husband, Phil Bronstein, who had recently been attacked by a Komodo dragon. That really is a thing that happened!\n\n“We just had our four-year anniversary,” Stone says of her marriage. “Time flies,” Rivers responds. Stone smiles. “In Hollywood it’s like dog years.” Don’t you mean dragon years, Sharon? Anyway, it’s so nice to have Sharon Stone—queen of the Oscar ceremonies of the mid-to-late 1990s—back in the game.\n\nWhile Rivers queries Stone about her famous intelligence—she asks if Stone is in “menza”—some sort of live ranking thing pops up on the screen. I’m not sure what exactly that number is meant to indicate, but Stone is fluctuating wildly.\n\nStone says she’s not actually in Mensa, that she just went to some gifted program as a child. “But I am so, so smart,” Stone quips. We don’t disagree. Her final score is revealed, and it is a disgrace.\n\nStone ends her segment by saying, “I’m really happy to be here.” Which always seemed true of Sharon Stone at the Oscars. I’ve said it a thousand times in this unending series of recaps, but everyone should be as excited as Sharon Stone is to be at the Oscars. Live it up! Tell someone you’re smart! Wear a damn Gap shirt and make a night of it. Stone is a model for us all.\n\nNext, Rivers jokes that she’s talking to “just another simple person with a dream.” That person is one Nicole Kidman, who is nominated for Moulin Rouge! (her first nomination) and is, presumably, enjoying her first Oscars ceremony sans Tom Cruise. (Though he is at this ceremony too—more on that later.)\n\nRivers tells Kidman that everyone says she’s beautiful and funny. Kidman laughs awkwardly (does she laugh any other way?) and says, “Am I beautiful and funny? I’m very glad that I’m funny!” Rivers asks Kidman if she thinks people “don’t expect you to be anything but gorgeous?” Kidman sidesteps a little and says that, well, she’s never done a comedy, so…Then she says Moulin is the closest thing she’s done to a comedy, which seems to be forgetting To Die For? Or maybe she just doesn’t think that movie is funny. Kidman seems understandably flustered by this line of questioning, eventually conceding, “I don’t know what I’m saying.”\n\nOnce that misery is over for Kidman, Rivers has some time to reflect while she waits for Marcia Gay Harden. Rivers—standing in a scrum of people, far different from the relatively elaborate and cordoned-off sets of today’s red-carpet coverage—remarks that she’s near the Australian press and that everyone wants to stop there because there are so many Australians nominated. The camera then cuts to the world’s most famous Australian, Helen Hunt.\n\nRivers rambles on for a bit. Suddenly Bullock has a Listerine product in her hand, and begins modeling it. “Product placement!” she jokes. Sandra Bullock is the first influencer.\n\nNow it’s time for In the Bedroom nominee Sissy Spacek, who’s there with her then 13-year-old daughter, Madison. Rivers asks Madison who she wants to meet, and the kid seems flustered and says “Anybody!” Rivers then says that Spacek is a strong contender alongside Kidman, when of course neither of them would go on to win.\n\nOkay, that’s the end of the Rivers video that I found. There are a few other scattered bits on YouTube, like Chris Connolly interviewing Kidman and Bridget Jones’s Diary nominee Renée Zellweger. The two were about to begin shooting Cold Mountain in Eastern Europe. That film will win Zellweger an Oscar in two years’ time. For now, though, Kidman just wants to “get this over with so we can party!”\n\nBefore we head into the theater, we’ll take one last look at the red carpet, where a German reporter is handing Monster’s Ball nominee Halle Berry a single red rose. It’s not the last thing she’ll be handed this evening—though, she probably didn’t throw away the other thing two seconds after receiving it.\n\nOkay! Let’s start the show, because we have a longgg way to go before we can go party with Nicole and Renée. Here we are inside the glittering Kodak Theatre.\n\nABC and producer Laura Ziskin hired Glenn Close and Donald Sutherland to do all the announcing for this year’s broadcast. A particular cruelty when you consider that, at this point, Close had been nominated five times without a win (she’s now at 8–0) and Sutherland has never, and still has never, even been nominated. (He received an honorary trophy in 2018.) Way to rub it in, everyone!\n\nDuring the In the Bedroom bit, we catch a glimpse of Marisa Tomei. I wish the camera would find her more often in general!\n\nThen it’s on to Moulin Rouge! and its director, Baz Luhrmann. Every awards-show shot should begin with Nicole Kidman clapping funny and end with Jodie Foster looking wicked.\n\nI wish I’d been able to find footage of Foster on the red carpet, but at least there is this photo.\n\nWith the measly five best-picture nominees done, Close chimes in to highlight the perpetually most overlooked segment of Oscar contenders, the actors. She gets the Brits out of the way first.\n\nGlenn Close then says the seven words Nicole Kidman has likely been dreading all afternoon: “Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Tom Cruise.” Vanilla Sky was, at one point, poised to be the Oscar makeup for Cruise’s Jerry Maguire loss, but it was a critical flop and there was to be no nomination. So, the Academy gave Cruise the consolation prize of opening the show to talk about what had happened just six months prior: 9/11.\n\nYes: This is indeed the first Oscars post–September 11, a fact that has to be acknowledged, just as Ellen DeGeneres had to at the Emmys the previous fall. Cruise opens with a quote from Billy Wilder about the magic of movies—the presiding theme of the evening. He then talks about seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey when he was just six years old and all the questions it provoked in him. “What is life? What is space? What is existence?”\n\nCruise continues reflecting on the movies that changed him, and then gets to a vague-ish allusion to what happened “last September.” In the early 2000s, there was lots of awards-show talk about whether it was worth it to celebrate movies and all their frivolous finery at a time of such woe—think of George Clooney musing on supposed out-of-touch Hollywood liberalism during the height of the Iraq War while winning his Oscar for Syriana—and Cruise’s speech is no exception. “An actor friend said to me, ‘What are we doing? Is it important, what I do? And what of a night like tonight? Should we celebrate the joy and magic that movies bring?’ Well, dare I say it, more than ever.” This gets a predictably huge round of applause, as sentiments like that did in those days. And certainly don’t anymore!! (Sigh.)\n\nAt the end of the speech, Cruise issues a bit of poetry that has become somewhat famous in Oscar-obsessive circles: “So pull up a sofa. It’s just us talking. It’s Oscar night.”\n\nIt’s a strange thing to look back at now. From a purely sentimental standpoint, it’s a cozy reminder of the self-seriousness that pervaded the Academy Awards when “Oscar night” really meant something. This broadcast had 42 million viewers in the U.S. alone! I do miss a bit of that pomp, if not really anything else about this particular circumstance.\n\nThen there’s a presentation of a little short by Errol Morris in which various talking heads—some of them notable—talk about what movies mean to them. Again with the self-seriousness that, quite guiltily, I yearn for these days. It’s a charming enough piece, and if you are curious who pops up in it, their names are listed here. Some are fun, some are less so. It’s up and down, like life.\n\nI’ll say this about embarking on a four-hour tour of a 20-year-old Oscar ceremony: It is quite something to hear Donald Sutherland spiritedly say, “Ms. Whoopi Goldberg!” And then our host arrives, descending from the rafters in her Moulin Rouge! finest. The audience is, as they say these days, gagged.\n\nGoldberg’s next joke is timely: “What a night. Movie stars. Oscar winners. Great big party. My God, is this Liza’s wedding?” She is, of course, referring to Liza Minnelli’s wedding to David Guest, which had taken place just the week before. A couple of the ladies in the audience absolutely love it.\n\n“I’m just cracking you up, aren’t I?” Goldberg asks, perhaps noticing that Sharon Stone and Julia Roberts had now keeled over onto the floor, convulsing, seat fillers scrambling to drag them out into the lobby. “Go ahead, Julia, laugh out loud, child,” Goldberg continues, addressing Roberts’s now motionless corpse.\n\nThen came a joke that I think even at the time was a bit controversial? While talking about how aggressive that year’s awards campaigns had been, Whoopi quips, “So much mud has been thrown this year, all the nominees look Black.”\n\nGoldberg goes on to say that the negative campaigning has been so bad this year that she got an email saying that Frodo Baggins was an antisemite. Which, sadly, is true.\n\nAfter that, it’s time to remark upon “Oscar’s new house,” the Kodak Theatre, which has since been renamed the Dolby Theatre. Because no one looks at physical pictures anymore, but sound still tears through the world unabated. Goldberg then trips her way through a joke whose premise is that, at 74 years old, Oscar is almost old enough to get flowers from Anna Nicole Smith. The audience groans.\n\nContinuing with the age thing, Goldberg says, “Oscar is the only 74-year-old who doesn’t need Viagra to last three hours.” Oh, sweet innocent Whoopi, how I wish this was only going to be three hours.\n\nGoldberg then moves into her 9/11 bit, joking that America suffered through a national tragedy, but don’t worry, “Mariah Carey has already made another movie.” She is referring to Glitter, which was released on September 21 of the previous year. The soundtrack, featuring all new Carey songs, was released on September 11 itself. That doomed project will forever be tied to its entirely accidental timing, but it’s actually not a bad movie. I welcome Goldberg’s suggestion that Carey make more movies. Do it, elusive chanteuse!\n\nMore from Goldberg: “Security here tonight is tighter than some of the faces.”\n\n“Oh, look,” Goldberg says, striding stage left. “The Smith family has been seated together. Will, Jada, and Maggie Smith.”\n\nFor one of her last jokes, Goldberg decides, sensibly, to focus on the movie Iris, for which Judi Dench, Jim Broadbent, and Kate Winslet are nominated. “A movie that Ingmar Bergman found depressing.”\n\nSweet generous heavens, it’s time for the first award. And it’s a biggie. Benicio Del Toro emerges from his cave of wonders to present best supporting actress. The nominees are Kate Winslet for Iris, Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith for Gosford Park, Marisa Tomei for In the Bedroom, and Jennifer Connelly for A Beautiful Mind. Connelly had previously won the Golden Globe and the BAFTA, though was nominated in lead at the SAG Awards, where she lost to Halle Berry. So, all told, this was pretty much a lock at this point. Dare I say she knew it?\n\nOnce that’s done, we get a glimpse backstage, where Jennifer Connelly is a little frightened of a dancer of some sort.\n\nThen we finally get to meet our announcers for the evening, Donald Sutherland and Glenn Close. “And so an actress’s life is changed forever. Hello, I’m Glenn Close,” she says a little wistfully. They also make Close read ad copy for Diet Pepsi (“Drink Young”) and JCPenney (“It’s All Inside”), like a common podcaster.\n\nBack from the commercial break, Academy president Frank Pierson takes the stage to talk about the new theater and stuff. Nothing remarkable. After that, Will Smith walks out to present the best-editing category. This is the first instance of a clever gimmick: The Academy enlisted famous screenwriters to explain what some of the more technical categories are all about. Neat idea! Who’s the first screenwriter? David Mamet. Oh. Darn. Smith jokes that that ought to “keep the censors alert for a few minutes at least.” Smith reads what Mamet wrote and it’s nothing special. Oh, well. Longtime Ridley Scott editor Pietro Scalia wins for Black Hawk Down. Josh Hartnett looks on in quiet awe, while Scott lets himself laugh a little.\n\nNext, Close introduces “the legally bound Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon,” the bound thing being because they were married at the time, I’m assuming. I don’t think they were legally required to be there or anything. But who knows! This was the time of the Patriot Act and whatnot. Anyway, look at that walk.\n\nThese impossibly young and pretty people are there to present best makeup, which neither of them need, amirite??\n\nThen there is a strange moment where Phillippe is about to read the winner, but Witherspoon says, “Let me read it?” in a plaintive little voice. Phillippe sighs and says, “You make more than I do, go ahead,” which is…perhaps an early sign of trouble in this legal bond? Or it’s just a dumb preplanned bit. Either way, yikes.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings wins its first of four trophies that night, beating A Beautiful Mind and Moulin Rouge! Glenn Close gets to say “Gimli the Dwarf,” which is the second best thing next to actually winning an Oscar. A small boy watches in wonderment.\n\nIt’s time for a little more Whoopi, as had been prophesied a couple categories ago by Close. Goldberg makes a joke about remembering “the actors, actresses, producers, and directors who are no longer with us, who have gone up there. You know, the ones filming in Canada.” I guess this was around the time when Canadian production—especially in Vancouver—was really ramping up. These three people are delighted by the joke.\n\nGoldberg then introduces the first best-picture nominee, In the Bedroom. She jokes that the budget was so low it was originally called “In the Double-Wide,” and then says that with all the fighting and slapping, the movie is better than Jerry Springer. Spacek remains unfazed.\n\nA cool thing they do this year is instead of just showing clips from the nominated films, they cut in interviews with the cast and creators to give a little insight on what the movies are all about. I think that’s a great idea! In the Bedroom is also a great movie and writer-director Todd Field has barely worked since, and that was long one of American cinema’s great mysteries. Where did Todd Field go? Well, he has a movie coming out this fall, supposedly, starring Cate Blanchett. Welcome back, Todd!\n\nThen the producers make poor Glenn Close get up from her announcer chair and go do a remote bit in the lobby, where she teases what’s to come after a commercial break. Do you think the Academy told her they’d give her an Oscar if she just did this one little favor for them? Or, how much did this gig pay? Not enough, I’d bet!\n\nPost-commercial, Donald Sutherland announces the next presenters: Owen Wilson, “who is nominated for an Oscar tonight,” and Ben Stiller, “who is not.” Sick burn, Sutherland. Wilson was of course nominated for cowriting The Royal Tenenbaums with Wes Anderson, that film’s only—only!!!—nomination. Gene Hackman was very much robbed. (Especially since Sean Penn was nominated for I Am Sam, woof.)\n\nThe boys are there to present best costume design, introducing a pretaped bit in which they wear various costumes from the nominated films.\n\nMoulin Rouge!’s Catherine Martin (Luhrmann’s wife) and Angus Strathie win. Martin would go on to win three more Oscars in her career, while Strathie designed the catsuit for Halle Berry’s Catwoman. So, to paraphrase Glenn Close, lives were really changing this night.\n\nThen it’s back to 9/11 stuff. Woody Allen makes his first-ever appearance at the Oscars to issue a plea to the industry to keep filming in New York City. He gets a standing ovation, yet another marker that 20 years ago was indeed a different time.\n\nI will take this moment to note that I believe at this Oscars ceremony, Tim McGraw sat behind Paul McCartney, in case you were worried that at some point post–9/11 wonders did actually cease.\n\nWhatever one might think of this particular moment, the montage tribute to New York on film is rather nice. What a town.\n\nNext up, Jodie Foster walks out to the Silence of the Lambs theme, as happens whenever she enters a room. It’s time for cinematography. Lord of the Rings wins, because that’s a good-looking movie. Though much of that feels owed to the stunning vistas of New Zealand. It would have been fun to see Roger Deakins win for The Man Who Wasn’t There, or even Bruno Delbonnel for Amélie. But, LotR was a technical juggernaut that could barely be stopped.\n\nOnce again we journey backstage, where Glenn and Donald are stuck with a bunch of circus performers—their will to resist entirely gone, resigned to their fate as mere props in the Academy’s depraved carnival.\n\nLet’s press on! “Please welcome, an angel,” Donald Sutherland says, no doubt wishing a real angel would come deliver him from his toil. Out comes Cameron Diaz, there to present art direction. Joel and Ethan Coen have been tapped to write the little intro for the category. It’s a deliberately tricky bit of playful verbiage that Diaz handles better than her character in In Her Shoes would, anyway.\n\nCatherine Martin, so happy to be freed from Buffalo Bill’s dungeon, wins her second prize of the night.\n\nAfter Robert Benigni talks about Ben-Hur for a little while in a pretaped bit, we venture backstage once more, where the circus people seem to be multiplying, or transmogrifying, while Glenn and Donald huddle behind their desk.\n\nAs the contortionists and acrobats inch ever closer toward that benighted pair, Whoopi comes back out to throw to a little package about the scientific and technical awards, which were presented in a separate ceremony by Mighty Joe Young phenom Charlize Theron. Apparently Theron said at one point, “Let me know if you don’t want to kiss,” perhaps presaging Adrien Brody’s infamous accosting of Halle Berry at the Oscars the following year.\n\nThey’re really having Goldberg do a lot tonight. Normally, Theron would have come out and presented that clip reel herself, and separate presenters would introduce each best-picture nominee. I guess they were trying to get a little more bang for their buck, or lots of people didn’t want to come to the Oscars that year? If that was the case, they should have just had Sharon Stone present everything so Goldberg could save her energy. Or they should have had Sharon Stone do all the announcing so Close and Sutherland could finally be reunited with their families. Notes for next year, I suppose.\n\nOnce that’s done, Goldberg says, “The man, the meerkat, Nathan Lane,” and there Nathan Lane is to present best animated feature. This is the category’s inaugural year, just in time for Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. Lane makes a joke about animators giving life to things that are “2D, flat, inert.” Which, he says, “they never achieved with Al Gore.”\n\nNow Halle Berry takes the stage in that iconic Elie Saab dress to present the sound categories.\n\nSongwriters Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote a singsongy bit of intro copy for Berry, who has fun with its rhyme and rhythm. She gets applause for it, the crowd warming themselves up for later in the evening. At this point in the Oscar season, Sissy Spacek had won the best drama actress Golden Globe, whereas Judi Dench had won the BAFTA. But Berry had the SAG under her belt, giving her momentum into this evening. You can feel it radiating off of her.\n\nBlack Hawk Down wins the sound prize, while Pearl Harbor wins for sound editing. So, in some ways, Josh Hartnett is the real winner here.\n\nNext up is best supporting actor! Last year’s winner Marcia Gay Harden is here to present. She looks heavenward to honor the dearly departed Julia Roberts.\n\nYou may recognize Hiller from Oscars past, as he was president of the Academy for four years in the 1990s. He gives a nice speech, as expected.\n\nOh, dear. One of the circus people tossed Donald Sutherland up into a box seat, so now he’s stuck there.\n\nTrapped in his vertiginous aerie, Sutherland introduces Ben Kingsley, who in turn introduces a tribute to film composers. This ceremony is drunk as hell on tributes and the like, which I suppose is what an Oscars ceremony is supposed to be. This one feels awfully generic, though. It’s just all the same classic scores—Star Wars, Jaws, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius—we’ve heard a million times at other ceremonies.\n\nI think we should just move on. It’s Two Weeks Notice time, as Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make their entrance to dole out the best-score award. They do a cute little bit because they are cute little people.\n\nAnd then one of the Gallagher brothers from Oasis talks a little bit about Twelve Angry Men.\n\nDonald Sutherland is brought outside in chains to tease what’s to come. He glumly says names like “Josh Hartnett,” “Faith Hill,” and “Sting.” Then he closes his sorry bit with a weary, “It’s the Oscars.” We know, Donald. We’ve been watching them for 19 hours now and we can see that they are killing you. But there is nothing we can do.\n\nOnce Sutherland has been dragged back indoors, Goldberg comes out for another bit of comedy and an introduction of the next presenters. She ties a little cloth around an Oscar statuette’s groin area. She says “John Ashcroft asked me to do this,” a joke about the then U.S. Attorney General who had a naked statue covered behind curtains so he wouldn’t appear in photos with it. Just a tiny, probably mostly forgotten absurdity from an administration—and a whole political era—that swiftly grew dark enough that it was past such lighthearted jokes. What a grim time.\n\nAdapted is up first. Ghost World and Shrek were nominated! What a time to be alive. As each nominee is announced, we hear one of the presenters reading a little snippet of stage directions, so the audience may better understand what a screenplay is. But mostly so we can hear Gwyneth Paltrow say, “Bilbo materializes.”\n\nAkiva Goldsman wins for A Beautiful Mind, perhaps the first true sign that this thing could go all the way. Goldsman gives a quick little speech, and then wanders off to go write the screenplay for The Da Vinci Code and direct Winter’s Tale. So he’ll be seeing you in a few years, Will Smith!\n\nFor original screenplay, Gosford Park sex lunatic Julian Fellowes wins for his first-ever film script, thus setting the table for Downton Abbey, thus ensuring that The Gilded Age would eventually slouch across the earth, leaving behind it a wake of blood and bile and other human ooze. All the perverts in the Gosford Park cast are thrilled that their smut prince has won his shiny implement.\n\nOnce at the mic, Fellowes says, “I feel as if I’m in A Star Is Born, and any minute Norman Maine is going to come out and whack me in the mouth.” He also says Robert Altman has given him “the greatest break in the movies since Lana Turner walked into Schwab’s.” Later on, he thanks his wife.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg then comes out to introduce the next presenters, John Travolta and Sharon Stone. While saying that Stone often leads the way in terms of style, Whoopi jokes, “And what woman hasn’t wanted to put her husband in a cage with a Komodo dragon?” In case you forgot something from earlier, this deep into the recap, Sharon Stone’s husband’s foot was eaten by a dragon. That’s what that joke was about. The dragon that ate Sharon Stone’s husband’s foot.\n\nAnd then out Stone and Travolta come, doing a little dance (impromptu?) to delight themselves, and I suppose the audience. This is probably one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to Sharon Stone, a dance with an icon at the Oscars. Couldn’t have happened to a more willing person.\n\nThese eager two are there to present what was then called best foreign language film. Just look at Sharon go. Head up, acknowledging the mezzanine and the balconies. She’s speaking regally, proudly. A masterclass. She is truly a legend of being at the Oscars.\n\nStreisand says some things about Redford—always calling him “Redford,” which is charming—that are true, and some that are overblown. Sundance, intriguingly enough, gets the biggest applause. It was really a major force by 2002. If you’re curious, some movies that premiered at Sundance just two months before this ceremony were Secretary, Real Women Have Curves, Storytelling, One Hour Photo, The Good Girl, Blue Car, Devil’s Playground, Bloody Sunday, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing, Tadpole, Birthday Girl (!!!), The Kid Stays in the Picture, and Gerry.\n\nAnyway! There’s a clip reel for Redford, and then he strides out onstage, “The Entertainer” playing. Everyone gets to their feet, some a bit more slowly than others, like someone at a Broadway show that hasn’t quite earned the standing ovation.\n\nOnce Berry is finally able to speak, she apologizes for crying, and then utters the paragraph of the 2002 Oscars: “This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It’s for the women that stand beside me: Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it’s for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has the chance because this door tonight has been opened.” Hard to argue with that sentiment. Except, of course, that it’s been 20 years and it hasn’t happened again. Oof.\n\nAfter Berry thanks her lawyers, which earns chuckles from the audience, and maybe sees the “wrap it up” signal, she says, “Okay, wait a minute, I’ve got to take this. Seventy-four years here, okay?? I gotta take this time.”\n\nWe venture backstage again, and I swear I am not kidding when I say that Glenn Close utters the following: “I don’t think anybody could possibly leave now.” She has been broken. She is gone.\n\nOnce that depressing moment is passed, Whoopi comes back out to riff about Black versions of Robert Redford movies. (“You know, I will never forget The Way We Was” gets the biggest laugh.) She then introduces the last best-picture nominee, A Beautiful Mind, flanked by a guy dressed like one of John Nash’s hallucinations (I think?). Is this hunk in the movie? Because if this hunk is in the movie, I guess I will see the movie.\n\nNow it’s time for a bit of stage magic. Though her body is currently in the Hollywood morgue, a hologram of Julia Roberts glides onto stage to present best actor. It’s so lifelike!\n\nThe Robertsgram says she’s glad that Tom Conti isn’t there because she was a little hard on him. I think she means Bill Conti, whom she referred to as “stick man” when he tried to play her off—or, rather, the real Julia Roberts—during her acceptance speech. The audience seems to get it anyway. Then it’s time for the winner!\n\nRobertsbot 3000 fumbles with the envelope a little, reads what’s inside, and says, “I love my life. Denzel Washington.” I’ve never been quite sure what to make of the “I love my life.” Is it a little sour toward the other nominees? It might be a little! But, she and Washington are good friends, so…I suppose it’s okay.\n\nAnyhoo, Washington seems very glad, hugging his wife tight while some guy tries to get in on the action. (Please don’t flame me for saying “some guy.” I’m sure he’s an industry bigwig of some sort, I just don’t have the energy to sort out who it is. I am almost Glenn at this point.)\n\nSomething I noticed when they announced the winner is that Will Smith seems to have left? He’s not in the live shots of the nominees, and then when Jon Voight is shown clapping, I do not see the Pinkett Smiths next to him. Maybe Smith saw the writing on the wall.\n\nRoberts gets a good hug in, perhaps to brag to the lonely man in the audience.\n\nBack from the commercial break, Glenn says, “And now, an Oscar-winning director, and my favorite Hamlet, Mel Gibson.” That particular sentiment aside, wouldn’t you love to watch a PBS show called My Favorite Hamlet, in which Glenn Close tours around small towns looking at things and talking to locals and eating various foods? Every episode ends with her saying the same thing, just with a different town name. “And that is why Halcott Center, New York, is my favorite hamlet.” It would be great! Do that instead of this, Glenn!\n\nOkay. Gibson is here to present best director. Let’s skip over his shit and go right to the winner. It’s Ron Howard. A Beautiful Mind has now won three of the eight awards it was nominated for. Will it win another one?? Who knows! (We know. It does.)\n\nWhoever cut to these two talking just as Howard begins to speak is a sneaky genius. (Altman was nominated for best director five times, but never won. He received an honorary award in 2006, just months before his death.)\n\nHoward’s speech is sweet but unremarkable. He tells the audience he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t been dreaming of this for a long time. Which, fair enough. Again, it’s okay to acknowledge that you wanted to win an Oscar! Nothing wrong with that.\n\nI am losing my mind, so let’s wrap this up, shall we? Out comes Tom Hanks to put us out of our misery. He has gently euthanized Glenn Close and Donald Sutherland backstage, and we will not be seeing them again.\n\nHaving Hanks, a major collaborator of Howard’s, present this award maybe suggests that the producers had a sense of what was going to win, and thus set up a situation where the Beautiful Mind crew would be getting the good news from a friendly face. Then again, Hanks played all the orcs in Lord of the Rings and built all the tea trays for Gosford Park. So who knows what the reasoning was. Anyway, A Beautiful Mind wins.\n\nHoward and Hanks share a hug.\n\nGrazer does the talking, off of a sheet of paper. (“Thank you to Marc Forster…Oh, wait, Halle this is your speech.”) It’s pretty much your standard best-picture producer speech. So let’s not dwell on it. We are almost to the promised land.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg comes out one last time and says, “It’s time to start the mudslinging for Oscars 75.” She is really obsessed with the campaign wars, having referenced them the last time she hosted, and at the top of this show. For good reason, I suppose! It was really a bloodbath back then.\n\nThen, Whoopi gets serious. “I want to say something from everybody here in Hollywood, to everybody there in New York: Baby, we’ve got your back.” She then turns around to reveal this.\n\nAnd that’s how the show ends, Whoopi Goldberg waving with her back to the audience, sending America and the world off into all the post–9/11 horror that was to come. What a way to end this trip down memory lane, huh?\n\nAnyway, goodbye. Thanks for reading.
