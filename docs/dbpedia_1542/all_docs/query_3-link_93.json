        "text": "The character “Woody” from the 1995 film Toy Story was developed extensively during the making of the film both in terms of his appearance and personality.\n\nIn the original Toy Story written treatment by John Lasseter in 1991, 4 years before the film was released, the character of Woody is a ventriloquist’s.\n\n“Yer not frum aroun’ heer are yew?” Tinny turns around to see a ventriloquist’s dummy with a human-sized cowboy hat on. He tips it up and underneath he’s got a little top hat. “How’d ya like that? Cowboys are one of my best impressions.” – Toy Story, Written Treatment\n\nIt is interesting to see that even when Woody was a ventriloquist’s dummy there were elements of a cowboy that would eventually develop into the cowboy character seen in the film.\n\nAfter it was decided that Woody would now be a cowboy his appearance needed to be redesigned and new concept art needed to be created.\n\n“We did many, many drawings, everything in animation takes many, many drawings” – Bud Luckey, Character Designer\n\nWoody was redrawn several times with very different looks being tried before he became the Woody we recognise today.\n\nThe difference between the first design and the final Woody character is huge. That being said, the gradual development can be seen. For example the ventriloquist dummy style separated mouth stays as a feature of woody in a lot of the designs. The colour pallet and design of his clothing can also be seen to gradually change from drawing to drawing. One element of the original character design that stayed throughout the development and ended up as part of the final character is Woody’s pull string.\n\nThe decision to change Woody from a ventriloquist’s dummy to a cowboy doll was made because they thought it would create a greater contrast which would allow the characters to clash with each other more naturally as Jeff Pidgeon explains.\n\n“Woody is more like the rag-dolls little girls used to played with whereas Buzz is much more like the modern toys with chips and special effects. They’re just naturally going to clash. It’s almost like the older detective and the younger rookie.” – Jeff Pidgeon, Story Artist\n\nThis development had a huge impact and completely changed the story line and atmosphere of the film. However, this was not the only major development of the Woody character.\n\nAs Pixar were working with Disney they would regularly take their storyboards and animatics to the studios at Disney for feedback. This resulted in some very significant changes being made to the characters and story as Thomas Schumacher, former president of Walt Disney Animation explains.\n\n“Jeffrey Katzenberg who at the time was chairman of the Disney studios and had great interesting in animation would always be pushing for what he called ‘Edge’. The Woody character became wildly unappealing at one point.” – Thomas Schumacher, Walt Disney Animation\n\nAn animatic created after Jeffrey Katzenberg had pushed for Woody to be more edgy shows how different the characters personality is from what can be seen in the final film. At this point in the development Woody is manipulative, angry and aggressively sarcastic which definitely makes him very unlikeable. John Lasseter admits that at this point he was embarrassed by what he had produced and that Disney had told them to stop production. Fortunately he was able to convince Disney to give him a bit more time to sort out the Woody character and make him likeable again.\n\n“I said, ‘just give us two weeks and we’ll turn things around’… I turned to our guys and said, ‘Let’s just make the movie we want to make’ ” – John Lasseter, Director Toy Story\n\nIn the end they developed Woody’s personality so that instead of being unlikeable and doing bad thing, he was more likable and good at heart but just made some bad decisions. However, his new personality wasn’t entirely different from his original personality. There were still similarities just with slight changes in attitude. For example, he is still a bit sarcastic just now the sarcasm has changed from being malicious and designed to put people down to being witty and designed to entertain.\n\nThe importance of character development and getting it right can be seen very clearly here as this unlikeable version of Woody nearly resulted in Pixar having to stop production on Toy Story. However, this negative setback is looked on with a silver lining by the creators of Toy Story.\n\n“When you have these crashing things that happen, the rebuilding allows the thing to be so much better” – Thomas Schumacher, Walt Disney Animation\n\n“After this experience we learnt a lot of things, the most important thing we learn was to trust our own instinct” – John Lasseter, Director Toy Story\n\nAs this was Pixar’s first feature length film the development must have been a huge learning curve for them. Fortunately it all worked out as the film was a huge success which has allowed them to continue creating great films."
