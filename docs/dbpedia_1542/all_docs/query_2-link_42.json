        "text": "The results of this pilot randomized, controlled clinical trial provide the first evidence that supplemental calcium and vitamin D3, alone or in combination, modify CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 expression in the normal colorectal mucosa of sporadic adenoma patients. Following 6 months of treatment, 2.0 g of calcium daily significantly increased CaR expression, but did not substantially change VDR expression. Although not statistically significant, the results also suggested that calcium substantially increased CYP27B1 and decreased CYP24A1 expression. Treatment with 800 IU of vitamin D3 daily significantly increased expression of the CaR (slightly more than did calcium) and CYP27B1. Although not statistically significant, the results also suggested that vitamin D3 increased VDR and CYP24A1 expression. The combined calcium and vitamin D3 treatment statistically significantly increased CaR expression to about the same degree as calcium treatment alone, and thus less than vitamin D3 alone. Although not statistically significant, the results also suggested that the combined treatment increased expression of the VDR (more than did calcium or vitamin D3 alone), CYP27B1 (about the same as did calcium alone, but less than vitamin D3 alone), and CYP24A1 (about the same as did vitamin D3 alone). The findings from this study are relevant because there is substantial epidemiologic (11, 25, 26) and basic science (19, 27) evidence that calcium and vitamin D3 may reduce risk of incident or recurrent colorectal neoplasms, and that any protective effects of calcium and vitamin D3 may, at least in part, operate through the CaR, the VDR, and the vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1.\n\nExpression of the CaR was reported in normal appearing mucosa in humans (28–32) and rats (33), and in differentiated carcinomas (28–32); however, sporadic to no expression was reported in undifferentiated carcinomas (28–32). It was proposed that in normal colon crypts, there is a calcium gradient with low calcium concentrations at the base of the crypts and high concentrations at the crypt apex (34). Decreased calcium concentrations were reported to increase cellular proliferation (4, 32, 35, 36), whereas increased calcium concentrations were reported to decrease proliferation and promote differentiation (4, 28–30, 32, 36). Loss of function of the CaR disrupts the signaling actions from increased calcium concentrations, such as activating E-cadherin and downregulating β-catenin/TCF signaling (28).\n\nThere are no reported human randomized clinical trials on the effects of calcium and vitamin D on CaR expression in normal colon mucosa; however, these effects have been evaluated in colon cancer cell lines. In cell culture, incubation with calcium and/or 1,25(OH)2D3 increased CaR expression (30, 36); calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 combined increased CaR expression more than did calcium or 1,25(OH)2D3 alone (30). We, therefore, hypothesized that supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3 alone and combined would increase CaR expression in the normal colon mucosa. Our hypothesis was further supported by the presence of vitamin D response elements in both the P1 and P2 promoters of the CaR gene (37). As hypothesized, we observed increased CaR expression in the calcium, vitamin D, and the combination calcium/vitamin D3 supplementation groups. Vitamin D3 supplementation alone appeared to have had the largest treatment effect, whereas calcium alone and in combination with vitamin D3 appeared to yield lesser, approximately equal treatment effects. We expected that calcium plus vitamin D3 supplementation would have the greatest treatment effect. There are several plausible explanations for why this was not observed, the first being that our findings may have been due to chance. At least 1 experiment in rodents reported that calcium and vitamin D individually suppressed tumorigenesis, but the combination of the 2 was ineffective (38). However, some studies reported stronger combined effects of calcium and vitamin D3 in reducing adenoma and colorectal cancer risk (39, 40). Some of the strongest evidence comes from a large clinical trial of colorectal adenoma recurrence that suggested that calcium supplementation was primarily effective among those with 25(OH)D concentrations greater than the median in the study population (29.1 ng/mL; ref. 11). In our trial, only the vitamin D3 supplementation group reached 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 29.1 ng/mL (20), suggesting the possibility of a threshold effect.\n\nThere is little consensus on the distribution of the CaR in the normal colon crypt (28, 30, 31, 33). Our study, the largest to investigate this thus far, used disease free colon tissue rather than normal appearing sections of colon mucosa adjacent to neoplastic tissue and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to use image analysis software to analyze CaR distribution in the normal colon mucosa. We found CaR expression to be highest at the base of the crypts, amongst the most proliferative cells and to gradually decline in the differentiation zone toward the crypt apex. These results suggest that CaR expression may undergo negative feedback regulation by luminal calcium.\n\nAn autocrine/paracrine function for vitamin D in the normal colon mucosa is suggested by the expression of the VDR and the vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in the colon mucosa (15). The ability of colon cells to produce the active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D, was recently demonstrated (41–43). Evidence from animal models suggests that the colonic vitamin D system is regulated separately from the renal vitamin D system (5). It was reported that renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D does not produce1,25(OH)2D in the nanomolar concentrations needed to halt proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting that colonic metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D is needed to explain vitamin D's possible anti–colon carcinogenesis effects (19). The expression of the VDR and CYP27B1 was reported to increase in the early stages of cancer development, but to be greatly reduced in undifferentiated cancers; this suggests that the VDR and CYP27B1 act as tumor suppressors, presumably by maximizing 1,25(OH)2D signaling to normalize cell-cycle regulation (16–18). CYP24A1 expression was reported to be increased in undifferentiated cancers, presumably mitigating the effects of 1,25(OH)2D signaling (17, 41). Our observation of increased VDR and CYP27B1 expression in the active treatment groups is in agreement with previous reports, which suggests that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of supplemental vitamin D3 may, in part, be due to increased VDR and CPY27B1 expression. We also observed an insignificant increase in CYP24A1 expression in the vitamin D and calcium plus vitamin D treatment groups, which may minimize the effects of increased VDR and CYP27B1 expression. However, the apparent decrease of CYP24A1 and increase in CYP27B1 in the calcium treatment group may lead to increased vitamin D signaling despite no increase in VDR expression; however, these estimated treatment effects were not statistically significant. The distribution of the VDR and CYP27B1 in the upper 40% of crypts provides additional evidence of the importance of vitamin D signaling for promoting differentiation and apoptosis. CYP24A1 also appeared to be expressed most strongly in the bottom half of the colon crypts, presumably lessening the effects of 1,25(OH)D and thus favoring proliferation.\n\nThere are only a few cell culture and animal studies and no large randomized human trials on the effects of calcium and/or vitamin D on the expression of the VDR, CYP27B1, or CYP24A1 in the normal human colon mucosa. The effects of25(OH)D3 or 1,25,(OH)2D3 on VDR and CYP27B1 expression in colon cancer cells appear to vary depending upon the differentiation status of the cells; however, CYP24A1 expression consistently increases in response to 25(OH)D3 or1,25,(OH)2D3 treatment (42, 44, 45). Two separate studies in mice found that low calcium diets increased CYP24A1 mRNA expression, especially in male mice and in the right colon. The low calcium diet also increased VDR and CYP27B1 mRNA expression in the proximal colon and reduced VDR expression in the distal colon; however, this was only observed in female mice. No significant change in VDR or CYP27B1 expression was observed in either the left or right colon in male mice fed a low calcium diet (46, 47).\n\nWe previously reported that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation in this same trial favorably modified expression of markers of proliferation (8), differentiation (8), apoptosis (20), and oxidative DNA damage (48) in the normal human colorectal mucosa. Previous reports in cancer cell lines (49) and human studies (48) suggest that some of the chemopreventive effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 may depend on the expression of the CaR and the VDR. Our results provide in vivo human evidence that supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 modify the expression of the CaR, the VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 in the normal colorectal epithelium, which may then promote calcium and vitamin D antineoplastic signaling pathways.\n\nOur study had several limitations. First, it was a pilot study with a relatively small sample size, increasing the role of chance observations and limiting our ability to perform stratified analyses. Also, we only examined the rectal mucosa and therefore treatment effects in other parts of the colon remain unknown. Another limitation is that we measured protein expression but not protein activity and, therefore, could not correlate changes in expression with changes in protein activity. Finally, these markers are not proven biomarkers of risk and we do not yet know whether changes in CaR, VDR, CYP27B1, or CYP24A1 affect risk for colorectal neoplasms in humans.\n\nThe strengths of this study include (i) that it is, to our knowledge, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3, alone and in combination, on components of the calcium and vitamin D-metabolizing system in the normal colorectal epithelium in sporadic adenoma patients; (ii) the high protocol adherence by study participants; and (iii) the automated immunostaining and newly designed image analysis software to quantify the crypt distribution of the expression of the CaR, the VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1, resulting in high biomarker measurement reliability.\n\nIn summary, the results of this pilot clinical trial indicate that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation, alone and in combination, may increase expression of the CaR, the VDR, and CYP27B1, and that vitamin D3 supplementation, alone and in combination with calcium supplementation, may increase CYP24A1 expression in the normal colorectal mucosa of sporadic colorectal adenoma patients. The anticarcinogenesis effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 may, in part, depend on the ability of these agents to favorably modulate the expression of the CaR, the VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 in the colorectal mucosa. These results, taken together with previous reports (8, 20, 48), suggest that calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation modulate the colorectal mucosa molecular phenotype to inhibit proliferation and promote cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Our results also suggest that the CaR, the VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 may be treatable biomarkers of risk for colorectal neoplasms and warrant further investigation. Finally, our results support further investigation of calcium and vitamin D3 as chemopreventive agents against colorectal neoplasms."
