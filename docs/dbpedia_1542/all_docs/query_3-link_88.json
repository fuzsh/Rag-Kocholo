        "text": "and many of the \"old school\" coaches of that era.\n\nWoody Hayes was known for his temper, but he did a lot of great things for his school and players.\n\nI know its game week and all, but I'd tap the brakes on labeling him as 'trash'.\n\nYou are 100% correct. He was a huge supporter of the military, was a Navy man, TAUGHT college level military history classes at OSU, and there are several under the radar stories of bonding with students and helping former players overcome and achieve great things.\n\n\"In the summer of 1979, Hayes spoke at the South Carolina high school coaches association clinic. True to form, he didn't apologize for punching Bauman and even admonished several high school coaches in attendance for their facial hair.\"\n\n\"His players at Ohio State had seen Hayes lose it at practice so often, some of them even prepared for it. They made sure to stand to his left. Hayes was left-handed; if you stood to his left, he had to take a step back to throw his left hook, and you had a chance to get out of the way.\"\n\nAt 2 a.m., Enarson and Hugh Hindman had met at the president’s hotel room in nearby Ponte Verde and agreed Hayes had to go immediately. At 8 a.m., Hugh Hindman went to Hayes’s room and gave him the opportunity to resign. Hayes knew his career was over. He just couldn’t bring himself to end it.\n\n“That would make it too easy for you,” Hayes told Hindman. “You better go ahead and fire me.”\n\nAt 10 a.m., Hindman held a press conference at the Sheraton. He announced that “Coach Hayes has been relieved of his duties as football coach at Ohio State. I prefer not to go beyond that.”\n\nanger management issues, but he was also in many ways a Dabo-like coach. Students apparently adored him, in spite of the fact that he was a Nixon supporter. He recruited black kids back when that didn't really happen much, and had black assistant coaches way before that was done much. He taught athletes English and vocabulary, and even military science. In other words, he was a really complicated guy, and like most people, he had demons he had to battle.\n\nHe was also a diabetic and his diabetes was mostly uncontrolled. Not making an excuse but that disease being uncontrolled leads to anger and emotional issues.\n\nBest of luck to your Tigers Saturday night but not too much. I have posted since the congratulations for the ass-kicking your team put on my Buckeyes that night. I'm hoping for a game more like 2014 with a different outcome as that game was an epic battle and was probably the springboard to the success Clemson has had as a program since."
