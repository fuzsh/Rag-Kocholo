        "text": "\"... the awesomely gifted Alisha DeFreitas... tells her story of her brush with the Culture of Death and her refusal to play the world’s game. I love that she gives two well-aimed upraised middle fingers: one to the abortion culture of the Left, and one to the Randian Makers vs. Takers class warriors of the Right. She’s one of my heros.\"\n\nMark Shea, author and blogger\n\n\"While reading your blog I often sense a certain amount of conviction on your behalf, which makes me wonder why isn’t everyone reading the blogs of a woman who actually “gets it.”\n\nDon, at Minus The Bars\n\n\"A curious mix of the sacred and profane...too nice for a run of the mill blog? \"\n\nJoe, my brother, author of The Blog of Blogs\n\n\"Are you really bored or something?\"\n\nJoscelyne, my sister\n\n\"Pretty f****ing intense.\"\n\nReader Brooke Farmer, on this entry.\n\n\"A great outlet for such a prolific mind and an entertaining mix of spirituality and current events.\"\n\nKeiron, my husband, also known on here as K, or my Knight & Sunshine"
