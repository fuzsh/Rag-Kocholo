        "text": "If the first scene of Sidney Lumet's breathtaking new film doesn't get you stirring in your seat, then check your pulse. Don't worry, I'll never tell what it is, but it sets one hell of a marvelous tone.\n\n1970s film auteur, Lumet (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network) brings us his best film in years. The kind that reels you in quick, and fights hard to keep you. Sneaky, sly Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decides to bring his young brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) in on a crime caper. Andy plots to knock of a jewelry store, \"Just a mom and pop kinda place,\" Andy assures the hesitate Hank. Little does Hank know that the jewelry store is none other than his actual mom and pop. Both the brothers need money, the store is insured and Andy promises no one will get hurt, so hey, why not?\n\nIt doesn't take long for things to go wrong, and for the whole family, including father Albert Finney, to be fatally affected.\n\nThe trick of the film is that Lumet, working with a brilliantly daring script from newcomer Kelly Masterson gives us the climax early. From then on, the events leading up to and after the robbery are seen from every major character's point of view. Lumet chooses an inspired path of nonlinear, narrative storytelling that echoes Tarantino.\n\nOnce tragedy strikes, the actors put on their A-games. Hoffman, so good, in well, everything, is mesmerizing as a corrupt sole who can't seem to please anyone, least of all himself. Two memorable scenes deserve all the praise Hoffman can get. I couldn't dare reveal them, but you have never seen just how shattering a decorative bowl of stones can be, until you see what Hoffman does with them. In a career full of accolades (including an Oscar for Capote), this is Hoffman's best work. So fierce with angst, yet so reserved with his guilt, you won’t be able to shake him.\n\nEthan Hawke, far better here than in his Oscar nominated role in Training Day, is equally as good. He gives Hank a uniquely aloof demeanor that asserts that he is in no way ready for the crime, let alone its aftermath. Hawke doesn't get tested much as an actor, but he strives here, reaching a career best performance that the Academy shouldn't dare turn its back on.\n\nFinney and Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman's feisty wife) contribute to the film's power. But it is Lumet who is the real hero. At 83 years old, he is the most recent director to prove that he still has great films to make, age be damned. Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead is a remarkable throwback to Lumet's finest work. Surely one of the year’s best. A movie that will grab you before the opening credits and trouble you long after the closing credits are through. Just like the good ‘ol days. A\n\nListen to my podcast on Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nThe first 10 months of 2007 have been enough. If the year was to end now, my movie going needs would be fulfilled. Crash and The Departed were already out by this time the year’s they won best picture. So the question is, have we already seen the best movie of the year, or is the best yet to come? If you ask me, we’ve seen enough. And then some.\n\nSo far:\n\nThe amount of memorable writer/director films has been astonishing, all with terrific lead actors.\n\nIn the Valley of Elah, written and directed by Paul Haggis- Haggis was the first guy in Oscar history to write two back-to-back best picture winners (Million Dollar Baby, Crash). His coming home from Iraq film resonated with audiences and contained Tommy Lee Jones’ best acting performance. Not to mention a powerful Charlize Theron.\n\nMichael Clayton, written and directed by Tony Gilroy- Gilroy’s first time behind the camera produced one of the most riveting films in recent history. An excellent throwback to the greatest era in cinema. Clooney gave a career-best performance as the title character. Great supporting turns from Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, and Sydney Pollack.\n\nInto the Wild, written and directed by Sean Penn- Penn gave a great effort in telling the true story of Chris McCandless, who gave up everything to gain all that life had to offer. Young actor Emile Hirsch gave a flawless and raw performance. An excellent Hal Holbrook shines above the impressive supporting cast.\n\nThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, written and directed by Andrew Dominik- A magnificently paced exploration of the West. Tabloid sensation Brad Pitt proves his acting chops by delivering a mesmerizing Jesse James. But the standout is Casey Affleck who not only matches Pitt scene for scene; he’s the one that stays in your head.\n\nOther mentions:\n\n--David Fincher’s Zodiac\n\n--Grindhouse (Tarantino’s section Death Proof, pictured)\n\n--the multiple-short epic Paris, je t’aime\n\n--Michael Moore’s Sicko\n\n--James Mangold’s 3:10 to Yuma\n\n--David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises\n\nMemorable performances not mentioned include:\n\n--Robert Downey Jr. in Zodiac\n\n--Angelina Jolie in A Mighty Heart\n\n--Don Cheadle in Talk to Me\n\n--Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, and Armin Mueller-Stahl in Eastern Promises\n\n--Keri Russell in Waitress (pictured)\n\n--Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in 3:10 to Yuma\n\n--Siena Miller in Interview\n\n--Amy Ryan in Gone Baby Gone\n\n--Benicio Del Toro in Things We Lost in the Fire\n\nTechnical Mentions (because this is a film-buff website):\n\nThe cinematography in\n\n--Zodiac\n\n--Death Proof\n\n--Sunshine\n\n--In the Valley of Elah\n\n--Michael Clayton\n\n--Into the Wild\n\n--The Assassination of Jesse James...\n\nPlus, the musical score in\n\n--Elah\n\n--Clayton\n\n--Jesse James\n\nSaving the best for last…\n\nI have purposely left one film out that shines above all the rest in 2007. My favorite film of last year was Babel. The first time I saw that picture, I didn’t know how to feel. I was deeply disturbed yet moved. After multiple viewings, I recognized it as a masterpiece. Every aspect of Babel is seemingly flawless. It contained the best direction, writing, acting, camera work, score and editing of the year.\n\nI was similarly touched by this year’s Rescue Dawn. Iconic, visionary filmmaker Werner Herzog has crafted a perfect picture. Out on DVD November 20th (a special DVD review will follow), Rescue Dawn has all the elements of a classic film. Christian Bale gives his best performance, among many great ones, in the true story about Vietnam POW Dieter Dengler. The film is haunting, humorous, tragic, heartfelt and most importantly, real. Klaus Badelt’s score is some of the best music I’ve ever heard in film, I find myself listening to it over and over, desperately trying to regain some of the emotion from the powerful film. Herzog is a masterful filmmaker and his Rescue Dawn is 2007’s masterpiece.\n\nStill to come:\n\n--Ang Lee’s Lust, Caution (pictured) --Ridley Scott’s American Gangster\n\n--Joe Wright directing Keira Knightley in Atonement (hopefully as well as he did in Pride and Prejudice)\n\n--Mike Nichols’ Charlie Wilson’s War\n\n--The teen-pregnancy comedy Juno (It’s written by an ex-stripper and stars Ellen Page, a promising newcomer)\n\n--The Kite Runner (based on the book)\n\n--Johnny Depp singing in Sweeney Todd\n\n--Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood --Sidney Lumet’s (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network) Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead\n\n--Todd Haynes’ Bob Dylan bio I’m Not There\n\n--and the one I’m most anticipating, The Coen Brothers’ No Country For Old Men (pictured).\n\nIf I ran the show, 2007 would be over. Not to say that there aren’t great films to come, if any filmmakers can put Herzog to the test, it’s the imaginative Coen’s. But just like last October, after I saw Babel, I knew that it wasn’t going to get any better. Rescue Dawn is a modern-day work of art that I’m sure will sadly be forgotten by Oscar voters. I only hope that people are as inspired by the film as I am. Remember November 20th, take two hours out of your weekend and let yourself be marveled. You will not be disappointed.\n\nWes Anderson, who has redefined the word quirky, is a truly original visionary. Each of his films is undeniably distinguishable. Several aspects go into becoming such a modern-day legend.Anderson is notorious for his brilliant use of indie-rock music, his consistently unique, breathtaking cinematography, and his necessity to re-use his actors.\n\nAnderson’s latest feat, The Darjeeling Limited, is much of the classic-Anderson same. The film begins with a heartbreaking short, Hotel Chevalier, in which a lonely man in Paris (Jason Schwartzman) is visited by his lost love (Natalie Portman). The short is a great prologue for what is to come, with Schwartzman introducing another insightful Anderson character. Once part II begins, we are taken on a whimsical journey.\n\nTwo brothers (Adrien Brody and Schwartzman) are invited by their brother (Owen Wilson) to embark on a month-long train ride in India to rediscover their relationships. The three indulge in wondrous conversations and hilarious shenanigans to fill their time.\n\nWilson has played a part in every one of Anderson’s films (as actor or co-writer), and they are where Wilson really shows his acting talent. The romantic and frat-boy comedies are okay, but only in an Anderson film will you get such delightful antics as Wilson barking polite orders to his brothers, all while his face is almost completely bandaged. Believe me, you’ll love every minute of it.\n\nAnderson newcomer Brody delivers a career-unknown, brilliant comedic performance, as does Anderson vet (and co-writer) Schwartzman (who continues his Hotel Chevalier character). No actor is better than the other; it is a trio of true comedic acting. The characters are all equally well written and equally well acted that it makes for a great ride.\n\nA dramatic turn will keep you engrossed and move you in ways completely beyond your expectations. I’ll never reveal the film’s best scene, which our three heroes are dressed in black. But it is in this extended scene that Anderson’s true talent in character development is apparent.\n\nAnderson’s films are a tough sell. You either love it or hate it. You get them or you don’t. I didn’t get his last film, the overrated Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. But The Darjeeling Limited does a smart thing by going back to the Anderson essentials. With echoes of the mesmerizing Royal Tenebaums, and even a hint of his first, and best film Bottle Rocket, The Darjeeling Limited lives up to any fan’s highest prospects.\n\nLike other film products of the 90s (Tarantino, Fincher, Jonze, Aronofsky, and so on) Anderson is a filmmaker with intense originality, each of his films is an eccentrically beautiful venture into life.\n\nI’m not sure why Anderson chose to go to India, but we benefit from his reasons. The Darjeeling Limited is one of his best films, whose comedic genius holds you, and its dramatic tones keep you. I’d expect nothing less, from such a refreshingly innovative filmmaker. A\n\nThe Saw films are something of an anomaly. They aren’t well made, well acted, or well crafted at all. Yet, year after year they are released and they always make a great deal of money. The films also single-handedly kicked off a new genre of film, torture porn. Without Saw you get no Hostel, no Captivity, and so on.\n\nI think I go to these movies based more on tradition and the fact that, four years ago on Halloween weekend, I walked into the original Saw not expecting much. Saw was made for 1.2 million dollars and grossed over 55 million in the United States. It made sense. I was genuinely intrigued by the creepy film, shot mostly in one room. Using mind tricks as a substitute for excessive gore.\n\nSaw IV falls much into the same realm as the two before it. Parts II and III were tired and uninteresting. And while some of the killings seemed like fresh, new ideas, I always remind myself what I am watching, and that tends to ruin the film for me.\n\nIf you’re a fan, you know Jigsaw, the mastermind behind the elaborate mutilations was killed in part III along with his whacko sidekick. Well don’t worry, part IV is much of the Saw same, with plenty of shootings, stabbings, open brains, blood and guts to fulfill your needs (if you’re into that sort of thing).\n\nI don’t want to sound like a hypocrite. Do I enjoy these movies? No. Is one better than the other? No. Do I go to them? Of course. Why? I have no idea. If Saw has just stayed Saw by itself, with no sequels, I think it would be remembered as one of the greatest horror films of all time. But now it has become jumbled with the mess that has followed. But don’t get me wrong, when part V makes its way to the screen next Halloween weekend, I’ll be one of the first in line. Why ruin a perfectly torturous tradition? Saw: A-, Saw II: C, Saw III: D+, Saw IV: D\n\nMost films cut away after something big happens. A funny line, a dramatic revelation, or even a gun shot can act as a director’s tool to keep the audience on edge. If used well, this can be a startling effect. It is rare, however, to see a film that stays in the moment. A film that is so purposely slow paced that it remains in a scene, through its entirety. In The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford director Andrew Dominik uses this plot device to fuel his breathtaking film.\n\nIf the characters are called in to dinner, plan to be at the table through the whole meal. If a man is trying to seduce a married woman, plan to see the complete seduction unfold before your eyes. That is what makes the film so originally thrilling, Dominik’s interest in the very fine, mundane details surrounding those big climatic moments.\n\nAnother device Dominik uses well is plot, mostly because there isn’t one. Jesse James is a film about story, and while the characters do things, they aren’t all reaching for one big feat. There’s no tracking down a pile of money, or planning a huge robbery. The film is set on following Jesse James through his last months, while beginning and ending several friendships.\n\nBrad Pitt exceeds his career-high performance in last year’s Babel, as the iconic criminal, Jesse James. Pitt is remarkable to watch, you’ll forget the tabloid-printed face that you see every day. Pitt exemplifies a historical figure and makes him human. Dominik isn’t trying to get you to like him. He’ll show James for what he is worth. Cracking jokes one minute, and then spinning into an impulsive, mad rage the next, Pitt is convincing every step of the way. He gives James an unpredictability that will keep you guessing in every scene. It is a flawless performance, the best in an underrated career.\n\nEqually as talented is Casey Affleck, who plays the man that became so entranced with James, he eventually killed him. Affleck gives the young Robert Ford a quiver with each word. His cracking voice personifies a uniquely built character. A dinner-table scene in which Ford recounts the similarities between he and James is creepily mesmerizing, all due to Affleck. With Jesse James and last week’s Gone Baby Gone, Affleck has proved that he is the more qualified actor in his family. It would be a sin to forget him come Oscar season.\n\nDominik’s only other directorial effort was the brilliant indie, Chopper. Made in 2000, Chopper is a startling true story about madman Mark “Chopper” Read, who actually cut off his own ears to get moved to a different ward while in prison. Both Chopper and Jesse James are about violent criminals who are immortalized. Although the films don’t fit an equal setting, they are both great, with Jesse James as an incredible seven-year-later, sophomore effort.\n\nNothing is forced in the film, every frame is deliberate. Skilled bits of narration taken from Ron Hansen’s book of the same name, and wonderfully fitting score from Nick Cave help to make this a modern day masterpiece.\n\nThe film is shot by the masterful Roger Deakins. Earlier this year, Deakins made hallways seem intimidating with In the Valley of Elah. Here he uses extended shots of the vast, wide open plains of the west to leave his stamp of perfection on the film. Deakins highlights Jesse James with subtle, yellow hues. But once snow begins to fall you will shiver in the way he lights a room using cold, blue tones. In a brilliant, five-time Oscar nominated career, Jesse James is his most illustrious film. Deakins can be added to the likes of Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan) and the late Conrad L. Hall (American Beauty) as one of the most influential men behind the camera. With Elah, Jesse James and November’s No Country for Old Men, Deakins will have one hell of a hat-trick in 2007, while firmly cementing his role as one of the best living men looking through a lens.\n\nDominik does a great thing in the final moments of the film. And although I’ll never reveal the scenes, I am only thankful that he learned to stay in the moment. Staying with the story, even after you think it has finished. A+\n\nOur post-9/11 cinema is becoming full of Middle East-set war films. Some have hit (In the Valley of Elah) others have missed (The Kingdom) and plenty more are to come. We’ve got a trend. Good or bad, none of these movies are making a great deal of money at the box office. Are people not interested? Are they not ready? Do they want to see films about a war that hasn’t even ended yet? As escapist art, how long can this trend last?\n\nBased on Rendition, the latest film to fit the bill, this film genre is dead on arrival. Rendition tries (and believe me, it tries) to be a good film, but not even a powerhouse of a cast can save it. The movie must have looked great on paper, getting Oscar-celebrated names like Gyllenhaal, Witherspoon, Streep, and Arkin to fill the poster. But the immensely talented cast isn’t given enough to do, being provided with stiff words and tired actions to fill the dull film.\n\nAfter conducting business in South Africa, Jeremy (Armis Knight) is taken at an American airport and flown back to a foreign country (the meaning of rendition) to be interrogated (tortured). Streep and others at the CIA think Jeremy may have information about a suicide bombing that has just occurred in a foreign land. Gyllenhaal plays the rookie state department officer who sits in on the questioning (torture) of Jeremy.\n\nJeremy’s very pregnant wife Isabella (Witherspoon) starts her own investigation, trying to track down her missing husband. She gets closer to the truth with the help of an ex-boyfriend (Peter Sarsgaard) and his connection with a powerful senator (Arkin).\n\nAll the while, there is a boring subplot involving a young man who may have been involved with the bombing and his trysts with the daughter of the man officially in charge of doing the questioning (torture) of Jeremy.\n\nThe countless torture scenes drive the meaning of the film a little too hard. Rendition makes its point but it doesn’t keep attention.\n\nI learned back in Reservoir Dogs that if you torture someone for long enough, they are going to tell you whatever you want to hear, and it’s no surprise when that happens in this film. Rendition does have a few good points. Gyllenhaal does well at hitting his so-depressed-that-I’m-watching-the-brutalization-so-I-must-drink mark. The film also has a remarkable little twist of an ending, in which I sat, genuinely shocked, aimlessly trying to piece it together in my head. But that is all but ruined when it is completely spoon-fed to you. If the intention of such films is to make audiences think and then realize and then empathize, don’t you suppose we’re capable of figuring it out on our own? C-"
