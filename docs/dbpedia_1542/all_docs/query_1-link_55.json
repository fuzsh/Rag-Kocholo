        "text": "I once heard a standup comic—it might have been Woody Allen—declare, \"Comedians are failed intellectuals.\" They can't, he said, shake the feeling that their work should serve a high, serious purpose; they're haunted by their own glibness, lack of discipline, and short attention span. His premise explains not only Allen's own Bergman phase, I think, but also the trajectories of actors like Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, and Eddie Izzard.\n\nI think of Allen's remark as I sit in the darkened bar of L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills, listening to Eric Bana, 39, himself a former standup and sketch comic, tell me a story. Acting, Bana says, was never on his radar when he was a kid. In the workingclass suburb of Melbourne, Australia, where he grew up, the closest thing to a cultural landmark was the airport. There was no theater, no museum, nothing. He'd wanted to drop out of school at 15 to apprentice as a mechanic (he's obsessed with cars), but his father, a Croatian immigrant, wouldn't allow it. Bana compromised He stayed in school, but he didn't do much homework. The feeling of never being prepared for class—\"a real, solid, deeprooted feeling of failure, of not having done what you were meant to do\"—hung over his entire childhood, he says, and reappears today, particularly when he's about to begin a film. \"In fact, I had an anxiety dream last night,\" he tells me. \"I was roaming around school trying to find my class. I was too embarrassed to knock on every door. It used to happen in real life.\"\n\nBut to the story Despite his disinterest in school, he hugely admired one English teacher. One day she assigned an oral book report. \"So I watch the video of Christine, by Stephen King, instead,\" Bana recalls. \"Since I'm a car guy, it was a match made in heaven. I write a few notes in alphabetical order, and up I get to present my book report. I finish, and my teacher gets up and says, 'Thank you.' And I'm feeling pretty dirty, feeling pretty guilty, because I loved this teacher. I mean, she was as good as they get. And she says, 'In my twenty years of teaching, I've heard hundreds of book reports. And Eric, you need to know that this is without a doubt the best oral book report I've ever heard. I'm giving you 10 out of 10.' \"\n\nBana, in a confessional frame of mind, answers my next question before I can ask it. \"It was a moment of such joy for a student who was so used to failing or just getting by. Pure joy that I might have a skill in bullshitting and that there might be something legitimate within the storytelling world that somehow fitted with me. At the same time, there was such an incredible, overwhelming feeling of guilt.\"\n\nI notice that he's blushing. Nearly twentyfive years later, the moment still retains its power for him. You can go too far in analyzing this stuff, of course, but Bana's anecdote has more than an echo of a Freudian case study. In the instant a guy discovers his purpose in life, that discovery is joined permanently to an \"incredible, overwhelming feeling of guilt.\" I'm not saying Bana thinks about this moment every time he gets in front of a camera, but it's in his muscle memory. Above all it's in his eyes. In person his eyes are so dark they don't even shine; they're practically expressionless. In the searching lens of a camera, though, they're luminous and soulful. Ang Lee gave Eric Bana his big Hollywood break, in Hulk, because of those eyes—even made them the foundation of the CGI character—and if you've seen Steven Spielberg's Munich, you know that the hauntedness his eyes convey is the reason Eric Bana is a movie star.\n\nIf you saw a Bana movie before Munich, it was probably Hulk, a fascinatingly neurotic but lifeless film that was, in Bana's account, basically an enormous green headfuck. Hulk seems to have been his first and only calculated attempt to become a star, and today he consciously shies away from what he calls \"chessboardtype decisions\" about taking roles. Ang Lee gave him virtually no direction, Bana says, and put him through as many as 140 takes of at least one scene. Who knows, maybe Lee meant to induce in him Bruce Banner's own conflictedness and rage, but if so, he failed disastrously. The process just emptied Bana out, and the deeper into shooting they got, the less he understood the character he was playing. I ask him to describe what it's like to do 140 takes of the same scene. \"Shithouse, you know\" he says. \"It's no different from running until you can't run anymore. There's nothing that interesting at the end—besides someone who doesn't really know what he's doing.\" Certainly, when you watch the film, you don't identify with, or even feel for, Bruce Banner; in Lee's camera, he's more a laboratory specimen than a character. And for all its cartoonish subject matter, the movie lacked a sense of fun. \"Humor and irony were not welcome on the set,\" Bana recalls, though he felt he couldn't lodge objections. \"At that stage in my career, I don't think anyone would have listened to me.\" Filmed for $137 million, the movie lost money domestically. And it seems to have created a resolve in Bana never to work in such a highprofile way again. Around the time of _Hulk'_s release, he told the Australian Associated Press, \"That pressure in itself is huge and enormous and makes me feel sick and gives me nightmares.\"\n\n\"I have been in some highprofile films,\" Bana says now, \"but I think I've been pretty careful about what my level of involvement is in them. I find the notion so daunting that a movie is actually all about you. I don't think it's healthy.\" He has played the doomed warrior Hector, opposite Brad Pitt's Achilles, in Troy; the doubtplagued assassin Avner in Munich, a film whose star was really Steven Spielberg; a professional gambler in Lucky You, opposite two bigger names, Drew Barrymore and Robert Duvall; and in this month's The Other Boleyn Girl, King Henry VIII—a commanding, complex, sometimes frightening performance for which he's billed third in the credits, with an _and _preceding his name. Also opening this month is _Romulus, My Father, _a beautifully filmed, vaguely Ethan Frome–ish Australian indie in which Bana plays—what else—a supporting role opposite the film's star, an 11yearold boy.\n\n\"More than once,\" Bana says, \"I've read a script and thought, This movie is going to be huge. This movie is going to make a star out of whoever does it. But I don't see myself in it.\" He won't name names, but one film he reportedly passed on, XXX, did in fact establish Vin Diesel as an action hero. Notwithstanding his complaints about the lack of humor on the set of Hulk, his American roles are marked in large degree by just that—strange, given that he began his career doing standup comedy.\n\nBana didn't know until his midtwenties that he was going to be a comedian. After graduating from high school and embarking on an impressively varied series of deadend jobs (among other things, he hauled cargo on the Melbourne docks, cleaned up glasses at a nightclub, and steamcleaned carpets), he awoke to his prospects one night when a coworker dragged him to a comedy club. \"One of the performers was pretty good, and the rest were just lousy, and my friend said, 'Three of the six people you saw tonight are making a living doing this.' I'd thought everyone was as good as Richard Pryor. I went, 'What am I doing picking up glasses' \" His early years sound very Broadway Danny Rose—he gigged at the Terrace Hotel's Fox & Hounds Room, he worked as a sideman to a conjurer called the Amazing Johnathan, he toured with someone or something called Jimeoin. \"I found it to be incredibly sad,\" he says. \"I found a lot of the company very tortured and troubled.\" In 1993 he began his TV career on Full Frontal, Australia's answer to SNL, playing mostly Phil Hartman–type roles newscasters, pitchmen, coaches. After four seasons, Bana was given his own show—Eric—to staff, cast, and write. \"We'd come up with a few different names, but the network decided on that one,\" he says. \"To this day, I've never felt more pressure.\"\n\nThe best sketches came out of nowhere. Meditations on character, they were marked by an affection for thwarted workingclass people and by an underlying melancholy reminiscent of SCTV. My favorite of Bana's cast of characters is Alex Topolino Amateur Magician, a teenager in a turtleneck, medallion, and lushly curly New Kids on the Block coif that was horrifically outdated even when the episodes aired in 1997. Alex is a lonely, gentle sociopath, just this side of retarded, and all his tricks conclude morosely and unsuccessfully, with gruesome bodily damage.\n\nBana also does two excellent celebrity impressions, of Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and in some of his funniest work separately interviews them in the guise of a third character, a reallife Aussie TV personality named Ray Martin. In the most provocative sketch of the entire series, BanaasCruise chokes up while discussing his love for his kids, at which BanaasMartin comfortingly clasps the star's hands. Startled, Cruise gazes at Martin. Then both men lean forward into a passionate kiss. \"I'm sure Tom hasn't seen it,\" Bana says uneasily when I bring up the sketch. He downplays what the sketch suggests about Cruise's sexuality. Ray Martin, he says, is a notorious sycophant, and \"I wanted to get to the side of him being so in love with the person he's interviewing that he wants to pash them.\" Maybe so, but I think Bana's being a bit disingenuous here. Watch the sketch for yourself on YouTube and tell me it's not Cruise who initiates the pash.\n\nBana still fantasizes about making a return to standup comedy. \"As I've moved on with my life,\" he says, \"I have thought, How capable would I be of coming up with another half hour or twenty minutes or hour Then I had a very sobering moment when I watched Jerry Seinfeld's documentary _Comedian. _I just went, 'I'm kidding myself.' Because you'd have to take twelve to eighteen months out of circulation.\"\n\nAs a standup comedian, Bana could assess his performances according to the responsiveness of an often prickly and inebriated audience. As a film actor, how does he know when he's clicking—or not—in front of the camera \"There are times when I feel like I'm in the zone,\" he says, \"but it may not be interesting to watch. And that is so fucking confusing.\" You can see why this might be disorienting. The authentic emotions he produces in the artificial environment of a film set don't read as they should in the objective lens of the camera. So what's real This is what Bana means, I think, when he says the following story \"really upset\" him \"A friend of mine was at acting school in England, in a room that had glass windows into another room. And in this other room was a couple, and they were rehearsing a scene together. It was a scene of an argument. The guy or the girl was getting upset. Watching them, he was so mortified by how bad the acting was that he nearly went in and said something. After five or ten minutes, he got up to get something from a fridge, and he had to go through that room. And he realized, as he passed them, that they were having a real argument.\"\n\nAt another point in our conversation, he'll vent about the isolation of working in Hollywood (\"You will go insane if you rely on other people to foster your selfesteem\"), but to me the isolation of revealing yourself to a camera that doesn't really \"see\" you sounds worst of all—something like telling a woman you love her as she indifferently files her fingernails. Understandably, the experience makes him testy. \"I have had instances where I've done a scene and the director has gone, 'No, I didn't see that,' and I will say, 'Well, you maybe need a tighter lens. Maybe there's not enough light on my face. I'm in the fucking dark here!' \" Bana's considerable affability as an interview subject—a British journalist once described him as \"blokey\"—belies his resolve as an actor. \"Are you easy to work with\" I ask. To my surprise, he responds with a decidedly unblokey answer. \"I can be,\" he says.\n\nWhich brings us back to discussing Hulk. \"I generally don't like being told what to do,\" he explains. \"I come from a place that is instinctual. I like to experiment, I like to feed off my costar, and I like to be in the moment. So if those instincts are being squashed, it's extremely frustrating.\"\n\nLike Denzel Washington, Bana has a powerfully masculine, intimidating physical presence and brings an epicheroic dimension to his roles that's rare in recent movies. A hallmark of his acting is an ability to be at once courteous and nitrogen cold; you can see it throughout his career, notably in The Other Boleyn Girl. As Henry VIII, \"he's very much the man who's never had anybody say no to him,\" says his costar Natalie Portman. It's an unsettling quality to experience in person, as I discover when, excited by his willingness to speak so candidly about Hulk, I ask once too often about it and Bana announces \"Tomorrow, there will be no Hulk questions.\"\n\nPlay a hoppedup psychopath, make him terrifying, funny, and charismatic, and the world will fall at your feet. It's a lesson that made stars of Jimmy Cagney, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. It made a star of Eric Bana, too. The Australian film Chopper (2000) was based on the true story of a national folk hero, Mark Brandon \"Chopper\" Read, who allegedly murdered nineteen people in Melbourne during the '70s and '80s. To prepare for the part, Bana put on thirty pounds and spent a week on Read's Tasmanian farm with him. Footage exists of Bana shifting in his chair as Read, beer in hand, bellicosely holds forth. \"The stories were uncomfortable,\" Bana says. \"After a few hours I'd be completely spent from listening. It was my job to make other people feel that.\" Bana's performance holds together not only a disjointed script but also a character whose abrupt mood shifts ought to make no sense. In one virtuosic sequence, Chopper, having been stabbed four times with a shiv, embraces his distraught attacker, murmuring, \"It's all right.\" How did Bana play such an implausible moment \"It's a matter of convincing yourself that's a believable beat 'It's okay to not react to being stabbed.' \" The role remains Bana's most flamboyant and actorly \"I was spoiled. I was lucky,\" he says. \"A psychopath is so nice.\"\n\nOf _Chopper, _Josh Hartnett, later Bana's costar in Black Hawk Down, said, \"Suddenly, everybody wanted to work with him. To do that off one film, you've got to be the luckiest man on earth.\" Bana bristles at the notion he didn't pay his dues, though, and alludes to his early days as a standup comic touring his vast country in the cheapest possible way \"Maybe Josh wasn't traveling around with me then in a Tarago van,\" he mutters.\n\n\"He has a quality no acting school can teach and few actors can match,\" Roger Ebert wrote of Bana's performance. \"You cannot look away from him.\" Bana seems especially proud that he's never formally studied his craft. \"The IMDb says I went to [Australia's prestigious drama academy] NIDA,\" he says with some exasperation. \"I've asked them, but they won't take it off the site!\" He goes on, \"I know enough about what they teach in a lot of those schools to know that those approaches wouldn't be right for me. I never wanted to shroud acting in mystery.\" His approach is instinctive, unsystematic. Scarlett Johansson, his costar, with Portman, in The Other Boleyn Girl, says, \"Onscreen you can see his thoughts blossoming, you can see him making discoveries, all the pieces sliding into place. He's processing his words as he's saying them; it gives the lines a kind of life.\" Bana says, \"It's just through feeling. Like trying to build a world in my head for that character. To me the attraction is immersing myself in his experience. It's addictive.\" More than once, I ask him what he finds addictive about losing himself in another person's life; repeatedly and frustratingly, he says, \"It just feels right. I don't know how else to explain it.\"\n\nBana still lives in Melbourne, fifteen hours away from Hollywood by plane, and remains, partly for reasons of selfdefense, very much a son of his city. \"Living away from Hollywood is a big advantage,\" he says. \"You can be so impinged in this town by physical beauty, by things that aren't real, by paranoia and insecurity, that it can alter your mind.\" Today, walking around Melbourne, he forgets he's a movie star. \"I'm part of the furniture,\" he tells me. Eric, his TV show, draws on his experiences growing up in Melbourne as much as any first novel would. The six episodes of the show remain his most autobiographical work. But has he been shying away from roles that are close to who he is in life Has he had opportunities to play them A few years ago, he told a reporter, \"I don't believe in acting where people just walk through the film as themselves. I get quite resentful of that.\" I ask him about those remarks. \"Maybe that comment comes from jealousy,\" he says. \"For whatever reason, I've found myself in a place where I never really get to be anything close to me. You're either doing an accent or you're pretending to be from a different country.\" He acknowledges, too, that he has yet to find \"a vehicle that would suit my comic style, which wasn't super broad. My most interesting work tended to be subtle and based in pathos. Maybe that will be the second half of my career.\"\n\nBana's father worked for Caterpillar but also raised racing dogs. \"I spent many nights at the track, hanging out with the bookies and trainers, staying up late to watch the races. I'd get home at midnight and go to school the next day.\" He also spent, he says, \"hundreds of hours parked in the driveway talking to truck drivers on CB radios. You'd get to become someone else. There was a degree of danger. You'd sometimes arrange to meet people. Their onair persona was so huge, and then you'd meet this scrawny 11yearold pissant of a kid and go, 'Wow, you were so much better on the airwaves.' \" At the age of 21, Bana flew alone to New York, bought a '79 Ford Mustang, and embarked on a sixmonth, 12,000mile odyssey through America. \"I would go days on end without speaking because there was no one to speak to. I got really lonely. There are times when you're by yourself in a car in the middle of nowhere, and you don't know where you're going, and you can't afford to stay somewhere you want to stay. You don't have anyone to call, and you don't know anyone. I learned certain tools that have been very handy in this business. It's a very lonely job, though you're surrounded by hundreds of people. How you cope with it is up to you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this conversation, Bana calls me to discuss his role in The Other Boleyn Girl. I ask him if there's a way that the film industry is like the court of Henry VIII. He lets out a low moan, and I realize that the question, as I've phrased it, sounds like an essay topic. I try again \"Is Henry your most autobiographical Hollywood role, in a sense\" He laughs. \"I don't think so.\" So I propose to Bana that as King Henry, he brings to life all the isolation and toxicity of stardom in America as he has described it to me. Consider the plot of the film, which is set in motion when the queen can no longer bear children. A courtier hatches a plan to procure one of his nieces as a mistress for the king. If the girl can give birth to a son, her family stands to gain extraordinary wealth and position. None of this, I suggest, is very different from the way agents and producers and directors intrigue as they try to manipulate and seduce a movie star. \"Everyone in Hollywood is doing what they think they need to do,\" Bana carefully replies, \"some more honorably than others. It's a bit of a shark tank.\"\n\nI press him harder, trying to locate a chink in his redoubtable blokeyness. How, I wonder, can such an uncomplicated, goodnatured guy find it in himself to play such nuanced, haunted characters How can he make himself so accessible to me yet seem to have so little to reveal The beginning of an answer might lie in something Natalie Portman tells me. \"Eric has a great capacity to turn on and off,\" she says. \"He'd be making faces, and they'd say 'Action!' and he'd instantly be the king. It was an amazing transformation.\" This ability runs counter to everything I've ever read about actors and preparation, so I ask Justin Chadwick, the film's director and a former actor, to help me make sense of it. \"I think it comes from Eric's background as a comedian,\" he says. \"Being able to improvise, he's able to recklessly go for something.\"\n\nIt's above all that tiny piece of imaginary space between Bana and his leaps into character that I've wanted to explore. But I'm not sure he knows much about it himself, or cares to. I try him one last time. I ask him whether he, as a movie star, identifies with Henry's loneliness. He replies that he does. And then he says, companionably, \"But I don't know if there's a better way of saying what I've already said.\"\n\nNATE PENN_ is a GQ staff writer._"
