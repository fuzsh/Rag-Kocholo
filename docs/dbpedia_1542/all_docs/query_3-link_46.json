        "text": "Some have called \"This Land Is Your Land\" an alternative national anthem. Others say it's a Marxist response to \"God Bless America.\" It was written and first sung by Woody Guthrie. Over time, it's been sung by everyone from Bruce Springsteen to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Folklorist Nick Spitzer has the story of an American classic.\n\nWoodrow Wilson Guthrie was born in 1912 in Okemah, Okla. He recorded \"This Land Is Your Land\" during a marathon April 1944 session in New York for Moses Asch, who founded Folkways Records. Guthrie was on shore leave from the Merchant Marines, one of his many occupations during the Depression and war years.\n\nGrowing up in small-town Oklahoma, Guthrie heard church hymns, outlaw ballads, blues, fiddle tunes and popular music. The Guthries had been fairly prosperous — Woody's father was a small-time politician and businessman — but the family unraveled in the topsy-turvy oil economy of the '20s and '30s. The Guthrie family relocated to Pampa, Tex., after Woody's mother was committed to a mental institution for a mysterious nervous condition. That's when Woody took to the road.\n\nAs a boy, he'd already proven himself to be a gifted street entertainer — dancing, playing guitar and harmonica, making up songs as he went. Words and music became a growing passion for him.\n\nOriginal Lyrics\n\n\"This Land Is Your Land\" wasn't released by Folkways until 1951, but the song was originally written in February 1940, when Woody Guthrie first arrived in New York City from Oklahoma. Guthrie had a keen ear for the recordings of Virginia's Carter Family, and he was not afraid to borrow. A 1930 gospel recording, \"When the World's on Fire,\" sung by the Carters, must have provided the tune for what would become \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nMusician, activist and Guthrie's fellow traveler Pete Seeger has probably sung \"This Land\" more than anyone else. He says that Guthrie made good use of the popular melodies of the day.\n\n\"He tended to write words first, and later on picked out a tune,\" Seeger says. \"Woody once said, 'When I'm writing a song and I get the words, I look around for some tune that has proved its popularity with the people.'\"\n\nSocial Commentary\n\nA man happier on the road than at home, he'd walked, hitched and ridden the rails all over the country. He went first to the Gulf Coast, then west to California, where he joined the half-million so-called Okies and Arkies — Dust Bowl refugees migrating in search of better lives. Although Guthrie purposefully threw himself into these travels partly to escape family troubles and his disintegrating first marriage, what he saw and experienced as he cris-crossed the country contributed to his emergence as a social commentator.\n\nHe was irritated by Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America,\" sung by Kate Smith, which seemed to be endlessly playing on the radio in the late 1930s. So irritated, in fact, that he wrote this song as a retort, at first sarcastically calling it \"God Blessed America for Me\" before renaming it \"This Land Is Your Land.\" Guthrie's original words to the song included this verse:"
