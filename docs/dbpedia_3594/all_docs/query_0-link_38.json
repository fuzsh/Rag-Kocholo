        "text": "Note: Before reading this, you should read the Alsace and Bas-Rhin overview page, which will give you an understanding of the region and explains the differences between: Alsace and Bas-Rhin; regions and departments; towns and communes; and more.\n\nEarly history\n\nAlsace was conquered by Roman troops around 58 BC. As the Roman Empire declined, the area came under the control of the Alemanni (or Alamanni) confederation of Germanic tribes, who chased out the last of the Romans in 378 AD and established a short-lived kingdom known as Alamannia. The Franks conquered Alammania in 496, after which it became a duchy under Frankish rule. The Alemmani language is the basis of the Germanic dialects—known as Alemannic German—that are spoken in present-day Alsace, southwest Germany, and Switzerland. The name Alemmani is also the basis of the word for Germans and Germany in several languages, such as the French words Allemand (for German) and Allemagne (for Germany). A succession crisis over the heir to the Frankish throne caused several regions of the Frankish kingdom, including Alammania, to declare independence in the seventh century. The region had de facto independence for almost a century during which rule was consolidated under one duke and the first known law codes were established.\n\nThe region was conquered by the Franks once again in the 740s. In 746, all of the nobles of Alammania were invited to a meeting at Cannstatt, where the Frankish king had them arrested, tried for treason, and executed; this eliminated thousands of noblemen of the region and placed the region firmly in the grip of the Frankish monarchy. The Franks had conquered almost all of the western half of continental Europe, excluding present-day Spain and Portugal, by the ninth century and established the Carolingian Empire. A succession crisis led to the division of the empire by three brothers in 843; present-day Alsace became a part of East Francia, which later became the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHoly Roman Empire\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was a loose confederation of various principalities, duchies, free cities, and other units that were only nominally unified; the term state is used to refer to a sub-unit of the Holy Roman Empire. The terms principality, duchy, and county reflect the title of the person who ruled the state—a prince, duke, and count, respectively. The Holy Roman Emperor was elected by the highest-ranking nobles within the Holy Roman Empire and the Empire was united in some conflicts. However, the various principalities, duchies, and other units had a great amount of autonomy and often fought among each other.\n\nAuthority over Alsace was complex, so I will only discuss the regions where the Alsatian immigrants covered by this website came from. Lichtenberg Castle (French: Château de Lichtenberg), located beside the village of Lichtenberg, was home to the Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg. They ruled the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg, which was established sometime between 1456-1480 and ruled over most (if not all) of the towns our ancestors came from in northwest Alsace.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation spread throughout most of western Europe, polarizing the region and communities. The Protestant-Catholic divide was a major factor over the following two centuries. Alsace was primarily Protestant, but there were a large number of Catholics, particularly in the south (present-day Haut-Rhin department). Some towns were home to large numbers of both Catholics and Protestants, especially larger towns, but most of the smaller villages were almost entirely of one faith or the other. To the best of my knowledge, all of the Alsatian immigrants covered by this website were Lutheran and their families were Lutheran back to the 17th century, although a few were Calvinists (Reformed). The Protestant-Catholic divide reached a head during the Thirty Years’ War in the early 17th century.\n\nThirty Years’ War and Swiss immigration\n\nThe earliest era in northwest Alsace that is of much significance to our genealogy is the Thirty Years’ War, from 1618-1648, and the repopulation of the region in the mid-17th century. The Thirty Years’ War was the most destructive conflict in Europe before World War II. The Alsace region was particularly devastated by the war and over the course of the war and the following three decades, it came under the control of France. This is also the time that the earliest parish records (baptisms, marriages, & deaths/burials) for our ancestors were created and thus the earliest time that our lineage can be traced.\n\nThe Thirty Years’ War was the culmination of decades of religious tension in western Europe, but was also caused by the ambitions of various nobles to expand their territory. The war saw Protestant forces—consisting of most of the states of the Holy Roman Empire and Sweden—clash with the Catholic forces of France, Italy, a few states in the southern part of the Holy Roman Empire, and Spain (which also occupied a region known as “Spanish Netherlands”, covering much of present-day Belgium & Luxembourg). However, the monarchy of France feared encirclement by the House of Hapsburg, a Catholic noble family which included the monarchs of Spain (which included the Spanish Netherlands), Franche-Comté (a region just south of Alsace), and the southern states of the Holy Roman Empire. The monarchy of France did not want the House of Hapsburg to gain control of more states within the Holy Roman Empire and France also sought to extend its influence in western Europe, a motive which would lead to France’s annexation of Alsace soon after the war. Despite the fact that France and the Hapsburg realms were both Catholic, France was often aligned with Protestant forces during the war.\n\nAt the start of the war, Alsace was a part of the Holy Roman Empire, but split among several states; the villages where our ancestors come from were in the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg, which was Protestant. Strasbourg was a free city of about 20,000-30,000 inhabitants; as a free city, it was only under the rule of the Holy Roman Emperor (as opposed to any duke, count, or other noble) and it had a government that was nominally democratic, although politics were largely controlled by an oligarchy of economically significant families that managed to gain political power. Strasbourg was the primary economic center of Alsace and was economically important to the rural lands that comprised the rest of Alsace, including the villages where our ancestors come from.\n\nPost-war immigration\n\nDuring the course of the war, villages were abandoned or greatly depopulated. Alsace, like neighboring Lorraine, lost about 40% of its population during the war. The nobles of Alsace sent representatives to nearby states seeking colonists to repopulate the region. This led to several waves of immigrants, from the 1650s through early 18th century, from Burgundy, Lorraine, Switzerland, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and various other states in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1662, King Louis XIV issued a decree to lure those who left Alsace to return and offering houses and uncultivated or abandoned land, a six-year exemption from taxes, wood for construction or heat, and an exemption from forced labor for the nobles.\n\nFor the families covered by this website, originating in the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg, it is the Swiss Protestant immigrants that merit discussion. Among the early immigrants were many of the Reformed Church, which has roots dating to 1545 in Hanau-Lichtenberg. The region of Hanau-Lichtenberg was also, along with Strasbourg, one of the main bastions of the Lutheran faith in Alsace. The town of Wimmenau was abandoned during the Thirty Years’ War and was resettled, beginning in 1655, primarily by Swiss immigrants in the 17th century. Among the towns they came from are Hutwill and Frutigen.\n\nThe early Swiss immigrants—largely from the cantons of Aargau, Berne, & Lucerne—were driven by the Swiss Peasant War in 1653. The short Peasant War was a popular revolt by rural peasants stemming from high taxes. The peasants organized themselves into a formal alliance by treaty signed in the city of Hutwill, which is, notably, one of the towns from which the 17th-century Swiss colonists in Wimmenau and vicinity originated. Several religious wars in Switzerland later in the 17th century (1656, 1694, 1697) caused misery and persecution for the Protestants and, like the Peasant War, drove immigrants to Hanau-Lichtenberg.\n\nOne other event of note during this period was the Forest Ordinance of 1669. It established a national management system for forests and restricted certain rights the population had to the forests. The Forest Ordinance remained rigorously in force until the French Revolution, when the code was less rigorously enforced and parcels of forests were given to municipalities and individuals. But by the start of the 19th century, the restrictions were back in place. The Forest Ordinance of 1669 remained the foundation of governance and rights to the forests until the Forest Code of 1827, which was a motivating factor for emigration from rural villages in the forests as explained later. Johann Michael Elsass was one of the first, if not the first, forest masters of the forests surrounding Wimmenau, sometime before 1687.\n\n18th Century: Emigration from Alsace begins\n\nLying in the heart of Europe between Frankish and Germanic lands, Alsace is no stranger to conflict, which often led to emigration to nearby states (generally within 300mi/500km). A few emigrants trickled from Alsace to the New World in the late 17th century, settling among their German-speaking brethren in Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 18th century that emigration from Alsace began to lands afar, such as the New World, Eastern Europe (Crimea, the Volga River Valley), and distance French colonies around the world. Like the immigration to Alsace following the Thirty Years’ War, immigration to Eastern Europe during this period was promoted by Prussia, Russia, and the House of Hapsburg to settle vast tracks of sparsely-settled territory across Eastern Europe, notably the Volga River Valley (Russia) and lands conquered by the Hapsburgs from the Turks. Like the Amish in Pennsylvania, some of these German settlers retained German as their mother tongue and remained united as a community. On the invitation of Catherine II, a German princess who later took the throne of Russia after her husband Czar Peter III’s death, 25,000 Germans settled in the Volga Valley between 1764-67. They were permitted to keep their culture and native language and exempted from military service. A century later, these privileges were revoked, prompting many to emigrate to the US and to Argentina.\n\nFrom the mid-18th century, emigration to the American colonies remained limited, but constant. An exception is from about 1817-1828, when French authorities imposed requirements for emigration that significantly stemmed emigration during that period. The US Civil War greatly reduced the number of immigrants to the US during that time.\n\nFrench Revolution and Napoleonic Wars\n\nBefore progressing to emigration from Alsace in the 19th century, a discussion of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars is merited.\n\nThe result of popular resentment of the French monarchy and aristocracy, mixed with the ideals of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution transformed France from a land ruled by the aristocracy to one ruled by the people. In 1789, revolutionary fervor engulfed Paris and forced King Louis XVI to cede a significant amount of power to the Revolutionaries, who were divided among several factions. While the Revolutionaries were divided among many factions with varying beliefs, they were united under the motto “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity” (which has been France’s national motto ever since). A National Assembly was formed and quickly passed legislation abolishing the aristocracy and feudal system—known as the Ancien Régime—and various related privileges for the elite, such as tax favoritism, the sale of judicial posts, unmerited pensions, various privileges of noble birth, and tithes collected as taxes by the Catholic church.\n\nNeighboring monarchies saw the Revolutionary government in France as a threat. In 1791, the monarchs of Austria and Prussia signed an agreement—the Declaration of Pillnitz— stating their opposition to the French revolutionists and their support of the French King Louis XVI, making vague threats of consequences if they were harmed. In August 1792, the revolutionists felt that the King was colluding with foreign powers to stifle the Revolution and, on 12 August, an angry mob arrested and imprisoned the King and his family. The King would later be tried for high treason and was executed in January 1793. Meanwhile, a radical group of revolutionaries gained power in the Assembly and declared war on Austria and Prussia on 20 August 1792. An invasion by Austrian and Prussian troops soon began, passing through Alsace. The ill-equipped French Army did not find much success until a stalemate on 20 September 1792 halted the advance of the invading armies. This conflict would lead France into war throughout Western Europe for the next decade. During this time, an outstanding general named Napoleon Bonaparte, led French troops to conquer Italy and proceeded into Austria until the latter negotiated for peace.\n\nOn 20 September 1792, the Assembly proclaimed the dissolution of the monarchy and establishment of the French Republic. Power was spread among many factions which advocated many radical ideals, most were radical then and some would still be considered radical today. For genealogy purposes, the introduction of secularism is of note. Responsibility for the recording of births, marriages, and deaths passed from the Church to the local government, resulting in the Etat Civil registers, French Republican Calendar, and the establishment of civil marriages as the only form of marriage recognized by the government (both are explained here).\n\nPerhaps the only other consequence of the French Revolution of relevance to genealogy is the long wars that ensued and the conscription of young men to fight in those wars. France was engaged in war against its neighbors until 1802. In the earliest years, the French Army, purged of most of its officers (because nearly all were nobility), was feeble. To address this, the Assembly passed legislation to conscript most young men for service in the army. Hundreds of thousands of young Frenchmen were enlisted for several years before being relieved of service. Soon after the French Revolutionary Wars came to an end, lingering tensions and the ambitions of the new leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, ignited the Napoleonic Wars, during which France conquered much of Europe and, like the Revolutionary Wars, required large numbers of conscripts. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815, France had been almost constantly at war for over 22 years, during which time a large percentage of the nation’s men joined, often involuntarily, the French Army. Fatigue of these conflicts was likely in the minds of some of the emigrant families that emigrated before their sons were old enough to be conscripted into the French Army.\n\nEmigration in the 19th century\n\nEmigration from Alsace reached its height during the 19th century, although it consisted of several waves of emigration. The first wave came in 1817 from the region of Colmar, in Haut-Rhin and far south of the region where the families covered by this website originated. A couple Alsatian families came to Stark County, Ohio in 1816-17, but I have yet to find a connection with the families covered by this website. The main cause of the 1817 wave of emigration was that Alsace was devastated by a series of natural disasters (heavy rains, flooding, hailstorms) in 1816, which took a heavy toll on agriculture in the region resulting in a period of famine and high food prices in the region during the winter of 1816-1817. The region was still occupied by a number of foreign armies that consumed some of the local food for themselves and their horses. There was a large spike in requests to emigrate in the spring of 1817, which would leave the emigrants enough time to cross the Atlantic before the fall.\n\nA second wave from 1828-37 originated from the Saverne and Wissembourg arrondissements—the northern half of Bas-Rhin and the origin of all of the Alsatian settlers covered by this website. From 1838 for the rest of the century, emigrants came from throughout Alsace.\n\nAs explained below, 19th century emigrants from Alsace were spurned by numerous motivations. The only event of note was the transfer of Alsace to Germany at the end of the Franco-Prussian War (1871-72), explained in detail in the next section. There was also a pause in emigration to the United States during the US Civil War.\n\nMany Americans, genealogists included, believe that most European immigrants to the United States in the 19th century were poor peasants motivated to leave by natural disasters, war, and/or the desire to escape their malaise for a better life in America. While there were many such emigrants, there were also many who were middle class workers, by 18th century standards, or farmers who were motivated by a vast array of reasons.\n\nFor Alsace in particular, many believe land agents were largely responsible for luring emigrants to America. This is primarily due to the fame of the Castroville colony of Alsatians in Texas. However, land agents were uncommon in Alsace until the 1850s; even then, land agents mostly worked to attract immigrants to Eastern Europe, particularly the western fringes of the Russian Empire (present-day Poland, Crimea, Ukraine, and the Russian Causasus) as well as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nSorting through the various causes for emigration found in a few scholarly sources, I have found a few that I believe were likely motivations for the families that settled in Ohio from the vicinity of Wimmenau:\n\nLack of arable land\n\nThe website of Wimmenau states that many inhabitants emigrated to the US and Argentina during the 19th century, which corroborates with other sources giving a lack of farmland as a major factor in emigration from the Saverne arrondissement. There are two main causes for this: ever-shrinking land parcels and the Forest Code of 1827 (French: le Code forestier de 1827).\n\nThe first is that large tracts of land were still owned by the government and, as life expectancy rose and the population grew, inherited tracts of land were being divided into smaller and smaller parcels. Many families struggled to live off their small plot of land. In some cases, when a parent died and left their property to their children, a sibling would sell their inherited parcel to the sibling owning the adjacent parcel and use the money to emigrate.\n\nThe second reason is that a new forest code was adopted in 1827 that greatly restricted the rights of access to the forests that the people had known for generations. Of the two major books on the subject of Alsatian emigration in the 18th century, both highlight the Forest Code of 1827 as a major factor that triggered the wave of emigration from Bas-Rhin from 1828 into the 1830s. The forests were owned by the government, with certain rights and privileges given by government decree. Such rights included: gathering dead leaves and wood for fires for heating and cooking, pasturage for domesticated animals, and hunting for wild boar and deer. The Forest Code of 1827 greatly reduced or eliminated these rights and imposed heavy fines for violators. (The sources aren’t clear as to how restrictive the code was, only that the fines were burdensome and collecting of leaves and poaching was prohibited.) A report on the causes of the emigration from Alsace, written in April 1828, highlights the forest code as a significant cause, noting that wild boar were ruining cereal and potato crops (presumably because they were proliferating without any hunting) and that the restrictions in the forest code deprived the poor of the wood and leaves necessary for heating/cooking and the main source of meat that the poorest could obtain. The report highlights that, by removing the forests from contributing to the livelihood of the population, the arable land was greatly overburdened by the population. The popular discontent with the Forest Code of 1827 sparked reprisals against those in charge of watching over the forests; the murder of forest guards (what we’d call park rangers in the US) was not unknown. In one department—far from Alsace—the 1827 Forest Code led to a popular uprising known as the War of the Maidens.\n\nThese issues were particularly poignant in the rural villages in regions that were largely forested, such as the area around Wimmenau, Erckartswiller, and surrounding villages. As most industry was located in large towns and cities, the inhabitants of rural villages had few opportunities for employment as laborers and craftsmen. The lack of sufficient land for self-subsistent farming, prosecution for forest offenses, and lack of employment opportunities was a significant motivating factor for emigration.\n\nEscaping military conscription\n\nFor centuries in Europe, young men were required to join the military to fight in the frequent conflicts, usually over matters that the average citizen had little will to support, and, particularly in the 19th century, their nation’s colonies around the world. In the first two decades of the 19th century, many Alsatian young men served in French units in the Napoleonic Wars. Those who didn’t serve usually had a brother, uncle, or friend that had served. Many families emigrated before the eldest son would be eligible to be conscripted. In other cases, the families emigrated after the eldest son was conscripted to avoid the conscription of the younger children.\n\nJoblessness due to industrialization\n\nAs industrialization spread across Europe, factories opened in the larger towns and cities. The factories employed many laborers who came from the countryside in search of work. However, on the other hand, industrialization eliminated the jobs of many craftsmen in rural communities, whose products could now be produced cheaper in factories. This issue may or may not be relevant to the Alsatian families that settled in Ohio, but are worth mentioning.\n\nLetters from relatives and friends already in America\n\nIn researching the Alsatian families that emigrated to Ohio covered by this website, the vast majority are closely related to earlier immigrants. Although I have no direct evidence of any letters written to family back in Alsace, I have little doubt that the early immigrants wrote to their relatives and friends back in Alsace speaking favorably of their new-found life in Ohio. Compare the lack of arable land in Alsace with the vast lands for sale in Ohio and it’s easy to imagine the joy of new immigrants upon purchasing a large parcel of land to farm. Often, the content of these letters were quickly spread around the village the emigrant left, fueling the flames of the emigration movement.\n\nOther information about the 1828-1837 wave of emigration\n\nEmigration from Bas-Rhin between 1828-1837 began with a large annual number of emigrants 1828-32 before tapering off. In 1828-29, 5,523 emigrants requested passports (the data is not specific enough to determine the number in each year). Passport requests remained strong in 1830 (2,875) & 1832 (2,482), with about half as many in 1831 (983) and 1833 (1,016). Afterwards, passport demands tapered off significantly: 274 in 1834, 414 in 1835, 513 in 1836, and 225 in 1837. (Fouché, p. 50)\n\nThe families that settled in Shelby & Auglaize Counties, Ohio originated from one of the main sources of emigrants during the period 1828-1837. The La Petite-Pierre Canton was the origin of 1,079 emigrants during this period, which compared to the region’s population at the 1836 census (14,759) amounts to approximately 7.30% of the population. Compared with the rest of Bas-Rhin’s 28 cantons, this was particularly high: it was the highest in the Saverne Arrondissement (4.10%) and only the cantons of Soultz (10.50%) and Wissembourg (10.20%) in the Wissembourg Arrondissement (6.90%) had higher rates of emigration. For all of Bas-Rhin, the percentage is 2.56%. (Source: Fouché, p. 52)\n\nOf Bas-Rhin’s 14,365 emigrants between 1828-37, the Saverne Arrondissement was the source of 32.17% (4,620 emigrants) of them, second only behind the Wissembourg Arrondisement (46.28%; 6,649 emigrants). The arrondisements of Strasbourg (18.87%; 2,711 emigrants) and Sélstat (2.68%; 385 emigrants) had significantly less emigrants. (Source: Fouché, p. 51) Among the four arrondissements, emigrants from the Saverne Arrondissement brought the least amount of money (479.90 francs), which had to be declared on passport applications (beginning in 1828). Because of inflation, it is difficult to translate this amount into U.S. dollars either today or at that time, but for comparison, the cost of a journey from the port of Havre to New York in 1836 was 200 francs per passenger (with a reduced fare for infants), which included all costs (eg. food) from the time of boarding to disembarkation, while a passport valid for travel to foreign countries cost 10 francs. A passport for internal travel (within France) outside one’s canton cost 2 francs and some poorer emigrants requested the internal passport rather than an external one. Among all emigrants (based on passport requests) from Bas-Rhin from 1828-37, 39.35% brought less than 500 francs/emigrant, 18.58% brought 500-1000 francs/emigrant, 19.24% brought 1000-2000 francs/emigrant, and 22.82% brought 2000 francs or more per emigrant. (Fouché, p. 24, 54-55)\n\nUnfortunately, the only work that I know of to analyze emigration from Alsace during the 19th century—Émigration alsacienne aux États-Unis, 1815-1870 by Nicole Fouché—does not provide detailed information and analysis about emigration from Bas-Rhin from 1838 through the 1840s, when many of the families covered by this website emigrated. Since there was a drop-off in emigration rates after 1837 and many of the later emigrants were related to earlier emigrants, my educated guess is that this supports the likelihood that letters written from those in Ohio to friends and family back home were the main motivating factors for later emigration.\n\nGerman control and the present day\n\nIn 1870, war broke out between France and Prussia. Prussia was a confederation of northern Germanic states (principalities, duchies, etc.) that continued to expand, with the ambition of its leader Otto von Bismarck being the unification of all German states. The rising prowess of Prussia threatened France, particularly Prussia’s ambition to incorporate the southern Germanic states that were still independent (Baden, Wurttemberg, Bavaria). In July 1870, France mobilized troops along the Prussian border in northern Alsace and Lorraine.\n\nOn 31 July, French troops crossed the border to seize Saarbrücken, commencing the war. The offensive was short-lived. French troops quickly retreated to defensive positions upon learning that a large force of Prussian troops was just 30 miles from Saarbrücken. The French were soon on the retreat. Barely a week after fighting began, French troops retreated through Wingen-sur-Moder, Zittersheim, and Erckartswiller. On 7-9 August 1870, Wurttemberg artillery bombarded the Chateau de Lichtenberg. A large fire broke out on the evening of 9 August, which destroyed much of the château and forced its capitulation. The Chateau remained in ruins until restoration efforts began in the late 1990s. Other than this, the events during the war are not particularly noteworthy for us.\n\nOn 2 September 102,000 French soldiers along with the French king Napoleon III surrendered at Sedan. Most French soldiers were now either surrounded by Prussian troops or prisoners. However, when word reached Paris of the surrender, a popular uprising overthrew the monarchy and declared a new republic. Prussian troops laid siege on Paris from September through January. On 28 January 1871, an armistice was signed ending the fighting. By that time, Prussia and her allies occupied most of northeastern France. In February, the southern Germanic states agreed to unite with Prussia.\n\nThe Treaty of Frankfurt, signed 10 May 1871, formally ended the war and also formalized the unification of Prussia and the southern Germanic states to become the German Empire. France ceded Alsace and a quarter of the Lorraine region (the Moselle department) to Germany. Alsace and the ceded portion of Lorraine were consolidated as the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine under the control of the German Emperor. The inhabitants were given until 1 October 1872 to retain their French citizenship and emigrating or remaining and becoming German citizens. Those who chose to leave and retain their French citizenship are known as optants.\n\nThe desire to reunite Alsace and Moselle with France soon became a popular cause throughout France. To the German government, these were frontier territories where the inhabitants’ loyalty was in question. Accordingly, the region was militarized and the population kept under tighter control than other parts of the German Empire. At the conclusion of World War I, France took control of these regions in November 1918. The regions were formally returned to France through the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nFrance quickly embarked on a campaign to re-Frenchify the regions. During the World War I, Germany prohibited the use of the French language, which could result in fines for anyone caught speaking it. After the war, France promoted the use of French and placed restrictions on the use of German. France also sought to expel all Germans who had settled in these regions since 1870. The inhabitants of the returned territories were divided into four categories: A (French citizens prior to 1870), B (descendants of such French citizens), C (citizens of Allied or neutral states) and D (enemy aliens – Germans). By July 1921, 111,915 people categorized as “D” had been expelled to Germany.\n\nIn the decades that followed, French was the language of education and thus became the language of most inhabitants of Alsace. Today, the few remaining speakers of German (the Alsatian dialect) are elderly. However, after being suppressed for much of the 20th century, France has began to promote the study of regional languages in their respective regions (eg. Alsatian in Alsace, Breton in Brittany, Occitan in southeast France). Alsatian courses are offered in high school and are heavily promoted/supported by the regional government.\n\nBibliography\n\nBalliet, Pierre. “Le Code forestier de 1827 et l’émigration en Alsace Bossue (1828-1837)”.
