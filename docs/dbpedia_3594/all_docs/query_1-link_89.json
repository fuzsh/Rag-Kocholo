        "text": "Disputed for centuries by the Lords of France and Germany, Alsace-Lorraine was originally a territory created by the German Empire in 1871. Today although many of the names of towns may sound German, like Strasbourg, this region of France is passionately French! Alsace and Lorraine have long had a distinct culture, one that is an amalgamation on both France and Germany that when combined is truly unique and special. This region of France has a more or less homogenous feel, with pockets of German and French speaking people, and a warm, lively character that has been distinguished throughout history for its military expertise as much as its culture of fine wine."
