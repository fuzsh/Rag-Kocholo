        "text": "Regions, departments, communes…what are you talking about?\n\nThe first subject that needs to be discussed is political geography, ie. what are the different terms used for this region of France.\n\nThe European territory of France (Metropolitan France) is 213,011 sq. miles (551,695 km²), which is about the size of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and three-quarters of Pennsylvania combined. This figure excludes overseas departments—French Guiana in South America and four small island groups in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean—which are an integral part of France, just like Hawaii and Alaska are an integral part of the US (unlike territories like Guam and Puerto Rico) but we often consider just the contiguous 48 states. Excluding the overseas departments and Corsica (a large island west of Italy), the main part of France is often called l’Hexagone (the Hexagon) because of its shape.\n\nDuring the times of the monarchy and nobility prior to the French Revolution, the country was divided into numerous regions that were based on nobility. During the French Revolution, there was a dramatic shift away from the former social and political system—the Ancien Régime (Old Regime, but the French name is usually kept in English)—to a system of equality and also of unity. In 1791, a system of new political divisions was created with the département as the new sub-national political division (just like a state is the sub-national political division of the US). Because of sentiment against the social order of the Ancien Régime, the boundaries of the departments were drawn so that they did not reflect the existing social and nobility status; likewise, names were chosen based on geographic place names (eg. mountains, rivers) and not cultural or historical regions.\n\nIn 1982, France reinstituted régions (regions) as a political subdivision with limited authority. The names of the regions generally reflect the historic names and boundaries, although no departments are split, of these areas. Regions have a council of elected officials and some taxing authority and responsibility for some infrastructure and educational authorities, but no legislative authority (ie. ability to create laws). The departments have legislative authority and can be roughly equated to US states, although much smaller in size—there are 96 departments in Metropolitan France which, again, is about the combined size of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and three-quarters of Pennsylvania! In contrast, there are 13 régions in Metropolitan France. Departments are divided into arrondisements, which are further divided into cantons, neither of which have any legal significance and are mainly used for electoral districts and as an area unit for statistics. There are also groupings of communes, known as communities of communes, which play a minor role in promoting business, recreation, tourism, and quality of life issues across 5-10 adjacent communes.\n\nCommunes are the smallest political division in France (aside from some cities that are divided into municipal arrondisements, like New York is divided into boroughs). They have their own government, just like incorporated towns in the US. The communes have a mayor and have a similar role to town governments in the US. One major difference between communes and incorporated towns in the US is that all land is part of a commune…think of how, in many Midwestern states, all land in a county is part of a township (although communes are much smaller than townships). For example, a commune may cover 4 sq. miles of which 70% is farmland or forest, 20% is covered by the namesake town, and a couple tiny hamlets (When reading this website, please keep in mind that I will usually refer to the commune when saying a name like “Erckartswiller”, but I will try to make a distinction between “town” and “commune” when it is necessary.\n\nIn the past decade, there has been a lot of discussion about changes to the government hierarchy in France and a few changes have been made. Many of the changes are not very relevant to genealogy or this website, except to say that the above descriptions of government levels may not be accurate several years from now (2016).\n\nAlsace or Alsace-Lorraine\n\nAlsace is a historical and cultural region in northeastern France that consists of two departments, Bas-Rhin (Lower Rhine) and Haut-Rhin (Upper Rhine). The French names are almost always retained in English. The immigrant ancestors covered by this website all came from northwestern Bas-Rhin.\n\nMany Americans, including many genealogists, use the term “Alsace-Lorraine” to refer to the region of France from which these immigrants came. Alsace and Lorraine are two separate regions. Lorraine contains four departments. Alsace and Lorraine (namely the Moselle department) share the similarity that they have historically been home to large ethnic German populations and German dialects were the main languages of these regions until the early 20th century. Most of Alsace came under French control in 1681. Most of Lorraine came under French control in 1776. Following the Franco-Prussian War, 93% of Alsace and 26% of Lorraine (mostly the Moselle department) were annexed by Germany in 1871. Within Germany, they were combined into a single territory known as Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen (Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine). This territory was returned to France in 1919 after World War I.\n\nI don’t know why the term “Alsace-Lorraine” is used so prevalently in English, especially among genealogists, but it isn’t really appropriate to use. Compare 48 years as part of the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine with over four centuries that Alsace and Lorraine have been used to the respective regions! If you use the term “Alsace-Lorraine” in your writing or in your family tree, I strongly encourage you to replace it with Alsace (or Lorraine, if applicable).\n\nFrom 1982-2015, Alsace was an official administrative région . On 1 January 2016, the Alsace, Lorraine, and Champagne-Ardenne régions were merged to create a new region, tentatively known as Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine (simply a hyphenation of the merged regions in alphabetical order). The new government of the region has until 1 July 2016 to adopt a name for the new region. The party which controls the regional government, elected in December 2015, used the name Grand Est (Great East) during the election campaign, so that likely will be the new name. (Note: This section was updated 9 January 2016) However, modern political changes doesn’t affect history, and Alsace will continue to be the name of the geographic, cultural, and historical region covering the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments.\n\nGeography\n\nThe towns where these families came from are located in a geographical region known as the Northern Vosges (French: Vosges du Nord; Vosges is pronounced VOH-zh). The Northern Vosges consists of rolling hills and dense forests and is the northern part of the Vosges, a massif covered with low-rising hills that rise about 1,000-2,000 ft (300-700 m) above the Alsace Plain (along the Rhine River) to the east.\n\nWith the exception of Hattmatt and Ringendorf, all of the towns of the Alsatian immigrants covered by this website are located in the Northern Vosges Regional Nature Park (French: Parc naturel régional des Vosges du Nord; website in French). The park covers 504 sq. miles (1,305 km²) of woodland, wetland, farmland, historic sites, and many small towns and villages. Although the park was created in 1976, it is important to remember that the natural landscape has not changed significantly since the time our ancestors came to America. Towns such as Lichtenberg, Wimmenau, and Erckartswiller were just small towns in the middle of dense forest in the early 19th century; they have grown a little bit in terms of area and population, but still lie in the middle of woodlands.\n\nLanguage\n\nToday, the inhabitants of Alsace speak French as their mother tongue, but this has only been the case for the last century. Until the early-20th century, the inhabitants of Alsace spoke dialects of German, the most-spoken dialect was Alsatian.\n\nWhile we may think of German as one language, it is actually a family of closely-related languages that were used across central Europe. It was not until the 20th century that the language was standardized, although a couple dialects are still commonly used. From my understanding, the differences between the dialects of German were greater than the differences between English dialects, such as American English vs. British English. The German dialects spoken in Alsace are closely related to the dialects spoken in Switzerland and the adjacent part of southwest Germany. Today, native German speakers can understand one another, thanks to standardization and modern culture (television, the internet, etc.).\n\nWhile most people think of France and automatically think that everyone speaks French, many regions of France have spoken other languages for centuries. Besides Alsatian in Alsace, Breton (closely related to the Celtic language of Ireland) was the native language in northwestern France, Basque (which is unrelated to any other European language) was the native language in a part of southwestern France, and there were many other languages that were once the native language in parts of France. However, in the early 20th century, after our ancestors had emigrated, France began to pursue a one-language policy to promote French as the language of all inhabitants. Since schools were only allowed to teach in French, the language eventually became the native language of the inhabitants in all of France. However, in the past few decades, there has been a drive to teach students the regional languages and students can, optionally, take lessons in the local language in high school. Today in Alsace, many older inhabitants know Alsatian, since they were educated in French but their parents spoke Alsatian. Middle-age and younger generations generally do not have much knowledge of Alsatian."
