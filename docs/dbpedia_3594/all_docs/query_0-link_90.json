This is an alternate History forum,\n\n...uh, question.\n\nHow far back do things go in this system? If France stole the territory from Germany (where quite a sizeable fraction of it was actually taken from Spain, to lock down the Spanish Road) then the reason it wasn't French in the first place was someone stole it in turn from Gaul.\n\nPerhaps, under that system, that it was once part of the Holy Roman Empire means that Alsasce-Lorraine should belong to Germany. But by that same metric, large chunks of Prussia should be given back to pagan tribes who lived there before the Teutonic Order rode in and slaughtered the lot!\n\nNo one set of borders can please everyone, and there's always going to be overlapping claims and overlapping justifications. But to go back to the Holy Roman Empire as a basis for claiming Alsace-Lorraine is to say that any territorial claims must be considered valid... so long as they benefit Germany.\n\nSo, a question.\n\nDo you consider the peace treaty of 1815, which concluded the Napoleonic Wars, to be broadly valid? Was it an appropriate one, or one that was inappropriate? If your answer is part-and-part, which territorial transfers do you think were in the wrong?\n\nHow far back it goes doesn't depend upon my opinion -- it depends upon how far back the leaders involved (and the people who supported those leaders' policies) thought was significant.\n\nFor example, French writers such as Jules Roche, Ernest Lavisse, and Christian Pfister reflected a popular French view when they said that A-L belonged to France because it had been part of the Gaul that Caeser conquered (many Frenchmen added a rather disturbing racial argument as well, such as Camille Jullian and Charles Weimann).\n\nNow, if in the later 19th century the French considered it appropriate to base territorial claims on events nearly two millennia old, it would seem thoroughly reasonable for Germans of the time to heark back a mere two centuries and regard France as having stolen A-L.\n\nMeaning that both nations, given the prevailing views about ancient claims still having validity, had reason to believe that the other 'stole' A-L. The poster to whom I was responding asserted that the French had no need to call a plebiscite in 1918 because the provinces had previously been stolen; but by that line of reasoning, the Germans then had no reason to call a plebiscite because they, too, regarded the provinces as having been stolen by France.\n\nIn the context of the attitudes of the time, there are either no grounds to criticize either country for not having held a plebiscite, and for regarding themselves as having a prior claim that justified 'reconquest', or there are grounds to criticize both Yet quite a few people exercise a double standard by criticizing only Germany for these things.\n\nwhich in my view is merely an imposition of the individuals' 21st century standards, and sometimes personal bias, upon late 19th century Europeans. To an extent, that is fair -- we have to make judgements about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. But we still have to realize that the parties involved were acting on the attitudes prevalent at the time. If both had the same attitude, and acted upon it, then it isn't reasonable to regard one as an irrational thug and the other as a rational, enlightened Innocent.\n\n1870 Germany is to the HRE much like how Russia was a successor state to the USSR,meaning it would inherit legal claims from the HRE.France isn't Gaul because Gaul was never an entity.Besides that,the French are fundamentally different people from the Gauls in so many ways.\n\nThis is a quite sound comparison.\n\nOn which I reach an exactly opposite conclusion.\n\nPrecisely because the USSR was not limited to Russia.\n\nHaving been part of the same federation of the USSR than Kazakstan, Uzbeksitan, Lituania, Armenia, Georgia, ... etc, gives Russia absolutely no right to claim the territories of these other States.\n\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to stand on this good example.\n\nI will now answer to some members contradicting me on this subject.\n\nThe fact that the union of several german States calling themselves the German empire under the hegemony of one of them, Prussia, gives them absolutely no rightful claim to other territories :\n\n- inhabited by people speaking a germanic dialect and having once been part of the same loose federation as this new State\n\n- inhabited by people not even speaking a germanic dialect and having once been part of the same loose federation as this new State.\n\nIt gives it no rightful claim either to territories of the former kingdoms of Italy and Burgundy that had been part of the HRE, be there or not ferman speaking people in these territories.\n\nIt would be the same with France claiming Belgium because Flanders had been a county part of the kingdom of France or because Belgium is inhabited by french-speaking. Or claiming Catalonia for the same reason.\n\nOr claiming parts of Switzerland, Africa or Canada because these countries are inhabited by french-speaking people.\n\nSame for Britain if it claimed being the rightful owner of its english-speaking former colonies.\n\nEverybody in this forum knows or should know the difference between claiming something and being rightful in claiming so.\n\nEverybody in this forum knows or should know that conflicting territorial claims and ambitions are never rightful for several reasons. There has been so many changes in links, frontiers, populations that several States can always claim to have a rightful claim. And when everybody has a so-called rightful claim, then it means that this is not a legal matter but just a matter of force and ambition.\n\nConflicting claims can only be settled by force or by negotiation (I mean true negotiation, not a situation chere one of the negotiators holds a gun put on the others's head).\n\nThis subject and the notion of rightful claim just does not make sense.\n\nI state again that it can only lead to bad faith arguments, irreconcilable positions and dead-ends. The notion of rightful claim itself is a trap.\n\nSome can dislike this statement and call it \"demonizing\". They have the right to have such an opinion. But an opinion does not necessarily make a truth nor a fact.\n\nAnd the fact is that such kind of arguments were the cause for wars and massacres.\n\nGermany used such kind of arguments precisely when it was the second Reich and the third Reich. It dramatically fell back on its head and logically led to the ethnic cleansing of almost any germanic presence outside of the borders given to the german States after 1945.\n\nJust consider asking the same kind of questions to other situations. For the \"fun\" if you think it's funny.\n\nWho has a rightful claim or the rightful claim to the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Palestine/Israël ?\n\nWho has a rightful or the rightful claim to the territories east of the Elbe river, that were snatched from its inhabitants (many of whom slavs) by german settlers ?\n\nWho has a rightul claim to Outer Manchuria ?\n\nWho has a rightful claim to Turkey ?\n\nWho has a rightful claim to what are today the territories were parts of Mexico under the names of Alta California and Nuevo Mexico and where many US States now stand ?\n\nWho has a rightful claim on the so-called kingdom of David and Solomon ?\n\nI consider such questions sterile. And I don't like the kind of arguments it drives people to use.\n\nAnd I state it again : all this is discussion is not about alternate History.\n\nAlternate History discussions could be : what if Germany had won WWI and kept the territories it held ?"
