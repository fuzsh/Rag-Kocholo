        "text": "This article is about the free land of Großgermania.\n\nFor the former sovereign state, see Free Republic of Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine (German: Elsaß-Lothringen) is a free land (gebiete) and constituent country of Großgermania. Comprising the territory of the Free Republic of Alsace-Lorraine, which declared independence from France shortly before the foundation of Großgermania, it consists of a single province, which exists for administrative reasons only and has no political or economic government. Alsace-Lorraine is ruled by a Governor appointed by the Emperor, with the approval of the National Assembly of Alsace-Lorraine. The current Governor is Wilhelm Weiss.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine comprises territory that had been passed between Germany and France several times throughout history. The territorial entity that is Alsace-Lorraine was first created by the German Empire following the Franco-Prussian War when it annexed both the Alsace province of France as well as the Moselle district of Lorraine, calling the area the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen). Re-acquired by France following the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine became the site of heavy fighting during the Second World War as the Großdetsches Reich struggled to capture the Maginot Line of fortifications."
