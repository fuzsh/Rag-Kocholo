        "text": "This article is about the former sovereign state. For the free land of Großgermania, see Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nThe Free Republic of Alsace-Lorraine (German: Freierepublik Elsass-Lothringen, French: République Libre d'Alsace-Lorraine) was a short-lived republic in western Europe. Established by a declaration of independence from the Empire of the French, it ceased to exist after ten months upon its merger into Großgermania.\n\nThe territory of Alsace-Lorraine constituted the Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen under the German Empire. Following the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine declared itself independent as the Alsace Soviet Republic, existing for twelve days with the support of the United States of America. Subsequently annexed by France, it ceased to exist as an administrative division for ninety years.\n\nIn late 2007, Jean-Christophe Napoléon, pretender to the throne of Imperial France, led a private army against the French Government, couping the president and declaring himself Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French. Using personal and business connections throughout Europe, he managed to gain the support of the European Union (EU). A French plan, with EU support, to develop much of southern Belgium into a military base, sparked fear in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg that they would be included in the plan at a later date. Luxembourg joined the Association of Germanic States, and, as their fear spread, Alsace-Lorraine reformed as a political entity and declared independence."
