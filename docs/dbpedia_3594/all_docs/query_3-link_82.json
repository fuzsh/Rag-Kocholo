        "text": "In the history of wars and diplomacy in the Western state system of the past several centuries, the most important single boundary is surely that of northeastern France. Since the unification of both Germany and Italy in the last century, the one territorial problem within western Europe that has most seriously endangered the peace of Europe and the world is that of Alsace-Lorraine. While the Germans regarded the annexation of 1871 as a restoration of areas once a part of Germany, they did not return to any previously established boundary, but rather created one that was newly drawn for the purpose. What factors influenced them to place the boundary—the international boundary from 1871 to 1919—precisely where they did place it?\n\n4 This decree of the King of Prussia, as leader of the North German Confederation, was agreed upon at a Council of War held at Pont-à-Mousson immediately following the great battles in the environs of Metz, but still twelve days before the decisive surrender at Sedan.\n\nIn form, the decree merely revised the areas of the two military governments that had been announced during the previous week, one for Alsace and one for Lorraine (though Strasbourg and Metz were still in French hands): five arrondissements (administrative districts) in northern Lorraine were detached from the general government of Lorraine and added to that of Alsace. The purpose of the change was to put under one administration the area that the Germans intended to annex. The population of the area concerned was told by the Official News for Alsace on September 27, “ on the basis of decisions recently resolved upon in Headquarters,” that “Prussia and the allied German states will under all conditions insist upon the annexation of this area with Germany as a defensive zone against future French attacks.” (Quoted in Petermann's Mitteilungen, XVI [1870], 433; cf. also May, Gaston, La Traité de Francfort, Paris, 1909, pp. 87–100.)Google Scholar\n\n5 In the decree of August 21, 1870, it was defined simply in terms of the French political subdivisions of the time—i.e., those drawn up during the Revolution with little reference to the historic past. It consisted of the two (Alsatian) departments of the Upper and Lower Rhine; three of the four arrondissements of the department of Moselle, namely, Sarregue-mines, Thionville, and Metz; and two of the five arrondissements of the department of Meurthe: Sarrebourg and Chateau-Salins. The reader should not be confused by the subsequent change in names of the French departments. The portions of both departments that remained to France after 1871 were united in the single department of Meurthe-et-Moselle which has not since been altered. When Lorraine Annexée was regained after the first World War, it was established without territorial change as the department of Moselle.\n\n12 Boeckh, Richard, Der deutschen Volkszahl und Sprachgebiet in den Europäischen Staaten, Berlin, 1869, pp. 17f.Google Scholar The sections covering Alsace and Lorraine constitute 20 pages of text and 14 pages of tables. Boeckh introduced his study with a significant exposition of the “principle of nationality,” not as a necessary criterion of the limits of a state, but as a right of every folk-group to full freedom in the use and development of its own language and culture, even though that be different from the major language of the state in which the group was included. Since, however, the Germans were convinced that the French government had used every means possible to repress the use of German in Alsace and Lorraine, this exposition did not deter them from using his data in 1870–71 to measure the area of Lorraine that should be added to Germany.\n\n14 In the Vosges highlands, the green line, drawn evidently along the drainage divide, was believed to coincide roughly with the linguistic divide—though subsequent information demonstrated that a narrow strip of French-speaking territory was to be found east of the drainage divide and one or two small districts of German language west of the crest were left in France. Where the boundary turned to the west opposite Strasbourg, the Bruche valley was believed to be German in its lower portion, French in the higher part, whereas in fact it had become largely French throughout. As a part of the department of Vosges, rather than Bas-Rhin, this area had not been originally included in the General Government of Alsace but was added to it in November of 1870, and was annexed entirely to Germany. Controlling routes to Strasbourg across a broad easy saddle in the Vosges, it would no doubt have been included for strategic reasons regardless of language. At the southern end of the Vosges, the lowland around Beifort was recognized as French, but, presumably because of its strategic importance no change was made here until the negotiations at Versailles, when Bismarck granted to the French the city of Belfort and a part of the surrounding French area.\n\nWest of the Vosges, the green line as adopted at Versailles followed for some distance the drainage divide between the Saar and the Meurthe, which was also approximately the linguistic divide, but from Avricourt west and northwest it departed radically from that to include the greater part of the predominantly French-speaking arrondissements of Cha-teau-Salins and Metz. By cutting off minor parts of the French-speaking portions of these arrondissements, the green line of February 1871 decreased to some extent the area of French language that had been included in the decree of the previous August.\n\nOn the northwest corner, near Thionville, no change was made in the line that had been proclaimed in August, even though that left in France a strip of seven or eight formerly German-speaking communes, some of which were believed to be still predominantly German.\n\n25 It seems more likely that the Civil Commissioner received it subsequently and one would suppose that he would have shown it to his military superior, the Governor-General of Alsace, since much of the area it discussed had been included in that General Government, or that, as a document significant for the question of determining the ultimate boundary of Germany, he would have called it to the attention of his civilian superior, Bismarck. No reference to it however has been found in any of the German literature.\n\nOur knowledge of this report, and even of the mere fact that it was made, is based solely on a copy (or possibly the original after a copy had been made) which the Civil Commissioner for Alsace had transmitted on September 11 to the military governor of Lorraine at Nancy, and which the French officials found there after the departure of the Germans and retained in the prefectural archives. The map which Hauchecorne made to accompany his original report was unfortunately not found—it may possibly not have been transmitted to Nancy. May, who first noted the existence of the report in 1909, assumed that someone in authority had assigned Hauchecorne the task of preparing it (op. cit., p. III); Engerand concluded that he did it of his own volition (Les Frontières Lorraine, p. 288).\n\n34 The views of the Crown Prince are mentioned because they were believed to reflect those of a number of others close to the court, rather than because of his position. For in spite of that, and of his mature years, he was frequently excluded from discussions of state matters, both because of fear that information might leak out through his English wife and because of doubts about the stability of his thinking. In a diary entry of February 25, 1871, he noted, “as usual no one thought it necessary to tell me anything.” On the question of Metz, his views show considerable vacillation (though no more so than those of Bismarck). Extracts from his diary of this period were published after his death in Deutschen Rundschau, September 1888, and re-published, as Jus Kaiser Friedrichs Tagebuch, 1870–1871, in New York, 1888; cf. Wolbe, Eugen, Kaiser Friedrich: die Tragödie des Uebergangen, Hellerau bei Dresden, 1931, pp. 199–200.Google Scholar\n\n41 Hahn, , op. cit., p. 134Google Scholar; Bismarck, , “Politische Schriften,” pp. 519 f.Google Scholar The possibility that if Germany voluntarily limited herself to the annexation of areas actually German in culture, France would ultimately accept the settlement as permanent, thus making unnecessary the consideration of military strategy of the next war, was evidently viewed as completely unrealistic by all those associated with the German supreme council, with the possible exception of the Crown Prince. France had bitterly opposed the unification of Germany, had resented the Prussian victories over Austria, and would be expected to seek revenge for the humiliating defeat in the current war; and the public expression of loyalty to France by the German-speaking population of the provinces to be annexed would keep alive in France the conviction that these provinces should be recovered, even if the population concerned was ultimately won over to loyalty to Germany.\n\n55 The statements that Busch adds as presumably paraphrases of Bismarck's commentary are significant in their discussion of points previously never mentioned: “One would otherwise have had to give up large parts of Lorraine that one had in mind to secure. These parts had perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, were very fruitful, especially the Moselle Valley, and contained magnificent beds of iron ore.” (Busch, op. cit., entry for February 23, 1871). Whether these were points that the military urged on the Emperor we do not know, but they are not mentioned by any of the others present at headquarters who recorded their impressions of the debate. Judging from the population figure given, the statement quoted refers only to the arrondissement of Metz where the iron ore deposits were of minor importance; the great gain in iron was in the arondissement of Thionville, about which there had been no question.\n\n60 Roesler states that “the boundary set for Lorraine was decided upon by strategists after consultation with the metallurgist Stumm and the mining engineer Hauchecorne” (Roesier, , op. cit., p. 56Google Scholar ), but I have not been able to find a source for this statement. Stumm, who had inherited his family's ironworks in Saarbrücken, would presumably have known Hauchecorne during the latter's service in that mining center. As a member of the Prussian Landtag, and a colonel in the army during the war, he would have been able to recommend Hauchecorne's name either to Bismarck or to the army authorities. But the suggestion might also have come from either the Civil Commissioner or the Military Governor of Alsace, or from government officials in Berlin who were familiar with Hauchecorne's career.\n\n71 Nor did it quite eliminate French contact with Luxemburg. Whether the German leaders regarded it as significant to cut the connections between France and Luxemburg is not known. Ignoring Kiepert's suggestion of the danger of French desires to annex Luxem burg, the leader of the German members of the boundary commission, General von Stranz, may well have known of complaints made by the military during the war that French sol diers had used Luxemburg as a route of escape from the German forces back into France and that the French in Metz had been supplied, at night, with provisions from Luxemburg. Bismarck himself had sent a formal note of complaint to the Grand Duchy (quoted in Hahn, , op. cit., pp. 179–181Google Scholar ). On the French side certainly, Colonel Laussedat regarded this separation as a serious handicap, presumably from the military point of view. For economic purposes, Bismarck appears intentionally to have left a small bit of common boundary, about half a mile, just where the valley of the Chiers offered a possible route, a route which was in fact later used for the construction of rail and highway connection.\n\n74 From Bismarck's dispatches published in Die Grosse Politik der Europäischen Kabinette 1871–1914, in “Auftrage des Auswärtigen Amtes,” Berlin, 1922, Bd. I (1871–1877), dispatch of May 9, 1871. The Emperor's annotation on this point in the telegram is significant, not only for his own thinking, but, according to the German editors in 1922, for that of many others in Germany: “u(nd) Mars la Tour? ” Mars la Tour was a commune immediately west of Vionville in the southwestern salient of the arrondissement of Metz, a part of the field of battle of August 16, 1870 (Mars la Tour-Vionville-Rezonville). Like Vionville it had been excluded by the alteration in the boundary made by the “green line” of February 21, 1871, but unlike Vionville had not been regained by the modification of that line made in the Preliminary Treaty. A Prussian cavalry division had lost over half 'its numbers there in an heroic sacrifice. Its addition, however would have notably lengthened the peninsular projection of the boundary at Vionville.\n\n76 This story has repeatedly been told as an example of the success of Norman wit in gaining points in diplomatic bargaining. Bismarck having stated that he would make no further territorial concessions, Pouyer-Quertier, a Norman who had planned his little stratagem overnight, said: “If you were the conquered party, I give you my word that I would not have forced you to become a Frenchman, and here you are making me a German.” “How can that be?” said Bismarck, “Who is talking of taking your Normandy.' I don't understand you at all.” “It's very simple, Prince. I am one of the principal shareholders in the forges of Villerupt, and you see clearly that, in this quarter, you make me a German.” “Well, well,” said Bismarck, “don't weep about it. I leave you Villerupt; but do not ask for anything more, or I shall take it back again.” (From the original account of the story by Laussedat, , op. cit., p. 51.Google Scholar ) If Pouyer-Quertier gained a valuable point on this exchange, Bismarck could feel that he had finally got what he wanted—namely, a definite end to French requests for further concessions; after this exchange, he could properly expect Pouyer-Quertier to end the discussions and sign on the dotted line."
