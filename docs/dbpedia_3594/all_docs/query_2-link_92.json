        "text": "The answer to the question depends on the specific time point. Today, Alsace and (Eastern) Lorraine are clearly French lands, whereas historically, they were clearly German.\n\nIn the 9th century, the Frankish Empire was divided into an Eastern and a Western part. The area in question has been part of the Eastern Frankish Empire and the subsequent Holy Roman Empire since then, for almost eight centuries.\n\nDuring this time, Alsatian cities flourished, and the region significantly contributed to and participated in the development of German culture in the 13th to the 16th centuries. Examples include Gottfried von Strassburg with his Middle High German epos Tristan (13th century), and Sebastian Brant with his satire Ship of Fools, one of the most widely read books in German before the Reformation. Strassburg was an important center for the development of a common standard German language, and it is not by accident that the first newspaper of the world was published there (Johann Carolus's Relation, 1605, in German language). It is interesting that in comparison with other humanists, those from the Alsace (e.g. Jakob Wimpfeling) showed themselves particularly patriotic.\n\nIt was not until the 17th century that the French influence became significant. When the Holy Roman Empire was weakened by the Thirty Years' War and threatened by the Ottoman Empire, France under Louis XIV started an aggressive war of expansion, with the city of Strassburg being forcibly annexed in 1681. However, the region stayed culturally and linguistically German; when Goethe studied there in the 1770s, he did so because Strassburg was still part of the German cultural sphere. This changed with the French Revolution, when the bourgeoisie in the cities started to adopt the French language, whereas the lower classes and the rural population continued to speak German.\n\nGerman remained the native language of most Alsatians well into the 1960s, in spite of all Frenchification efforts. Nevertheless, the cultural and linguistic identity of the Alsatians was broken after WWII, and they were ashamed of speaking German and in great numbers decided not to pass on their linguistic heritage to their children.\n\nToday, Alsace has completely lost its German identity and is proud to be one of the most patriotic regions of France. The Alsatians have also decided for French monolingualism; German will be extinct in the Alsace in a matter of decades.\n\nAs an absurd by-product of the historical developments, Strassburg today is one of the most typical German-looking cities, with its medieval core and the 19th century expansion (e.g. the university), whereas most larger German cities in Germany proper have been destroyed during WWII.\n\n...\n\nDuring that time(15th-16th century),Lorraine was pretty much a French country, with a full-blooded French ruling dynasty and kept strong relationships with France and Burgundy(the two powers also viewed the Duchy of Lorraine as a possible prey)\n\nAlsace was part of the HRE, but was largely indipendent; this territory was a sort of \"point of connection\" between French,Burgundian,Habsburg and Swiss interests, counterbalanced by Alsace's spirit of indipendece(strongly favoured by the ecclesistical lordship and the municipal towns); the language was much more German oriented\n\n...\n\nIt certainly makes sense to distinguish between Alsace and Lorraine. Whereas Alsace was almost completely German-speaking through most of its history, the case is different for Lorraine. Most of Lorraine was French-speaking over centuries and had a clear French identity. However, the territory in question - the one annexed to Germany - comprises only the third of Lorraine which was German-speaking. For strategic reasons, some relatively minor French-speaking parts were also annexed, in particular the Francophone city of Metz.\n\nFor the Alsace, I cannot recognize any function as a mediator between French and German culture before the French Revolution. I consider this a modern interpretation that satisfies our desire for multicultural places; it has nothing to do with reality. Strassburg in 1600 was a thoroughly German city no less than Cologne. Of course, it used to have a strong sense of independence in medieval ages, but this was very similar to other South German cities like Nuremberg or Augsburg.\n\nIn theory, it should have been possible to keep some of the German culture and language despite the integration into the French state. However, the perceived German character of the region has obviously not been viewed as an asset by the Alsatians, but rather as a burden for the full integration into the centralist and unitarian French state.\n\nIt certainly makes sense to distinguish between Alsace and Lorraine.

The reception of the French army returning to the region upon victory in WWI made this clear to outsiders. Speaking German at whatever point in history does not make them German rather than French. French identity (since the revolution) is not dictated by ethnicity/language/religion and this goes for Germany as well since recent decades. Remember that less than 20% of the people in \"France\" spoke \"French\" during the Napoleonic era. By that logic France would have a legitimate claim on only small parts of modern France.\n\nDelving into who spoke what language in what century as an identification of a nation is an outdated concept and one that helped ignite several bloody wars between the two nations. How Germans identified someone as German and the French identified someone as French were based upon different factors during the times between 1870-1945. The Germans embraced concepts of racial and linguistic nationalism while the French moved away from this. Germany and France from 1871-1945 really represented two opposite models of European state.\n\nFrance has the better claim because when conflicts erupted between France-Germany they have been predisposed to the French.

This should have been respected in 1870/71, maybe by means of a referendum. The same is true, however, for 1918/19 - why were people not asked what they wanted? I am not sure about the outcome at that time; a majority towards Germany would have been a possibility.\n\nThe French have always maintained that their understanding of the state and citizenship was different from the German one; and you clearly fell for this nice assertion. In short: French nationalism was supposed to be characterized by the expressed will to be citizen of nation, while German nationalism was supposed to be based on ethnicity and language. That is of course nice in theory, but in 1918/19, the French nevertheless decided to ethnically cleanse Alsace-Lorraine, with the effect that 300,000 people had to leave the region because they were not deemed French enough. In 1870/71, no such thing occurred; people were free to choose whether they wanted to stay or to leave (only 50,000 left for France). And of course, after 1918/19, the German language was forbidden in Alsace-Lorraine, and all efforts were made to eradicate the language against the will of the people.\n\nThe ethnic cleansing and the language policy after 1918/19 clearly show that French nationalism in practice was not that different from the German one.\n\nI had thought France first \"took\" Alsace and Lorriane during the reign of Louis XVI as part of the Thirty Years War.\n\nThe region that was once called Lotharingia was allways disputed betwen France and \"Germany\", especially Burgund and later the northern regions of Lotharingia.\n\nThe history of conquest of Alsace-Lorraine mainly started since the 30y-war, when France started to gain control over several cities and regions. In 1648 the emperor and the habsburgians relinquished all rights on their territories and those of the empire. That means, that e.g. former imperial cities with special rights were now given to france, allthough this would have meant a reduction of the rights of thes cities. Especially in the 1680th with the reunion-politics, where france demanded every territory which ever belonged to countries wihich were parts of France from the empire. A French court was responsible for this. Of course they decided in every case, that these cities and territories have to subject to France. Then France mad an ultimatum to subject and threatened with military force. It lasted till 1714 untill Austria acknowledged the situation. A further step was done during the french revolution, when other territories were annexed and as well the french nationalism led to a more rigide incorporation.\n\nThese process you can watch with the beginning of the treaty in 1648\n\nin 1400\n\nin 1648\n\nin 1713\n\nin 1789\n\nfailed attempts for further conquest\n\nin 1808\n\nin 1812\n\nthe kingdom of Westphalia and the Ghzm Berg were French satellite states ruled by Jerome and Napoleon Louis Bonaparte.\n\nBTW, that's why I am allways angry about the term \"the german Drang nach Osten\" and the accusation of the evil germans who had nothing else to do than to conquer their neighbours in the east. we have the same situation in germany's west and there is no \"French urge to the east\" accusation.\n\nThe region that was once called Lotharingia was allways disputed betwen France and \"Germany\", especially Burgund and later the northern regions of Lotharingia.\n\nThe history of conquest of Alsace-Lorraine mainly started since the 30y-war, when France started to gain control over several cities and regions.

Troughout history is has both been in French as in German hands. Today it is in French hands, but do you think this is how it should be or do you think Germany has more claim on it?\n\n...\n\nYour question involves two related aspects, which may lead people to vote differently, dependent on how they understand your question.\n\nThe first aspect concerns the present time. I think it is clear that today the territory what used to be called Alsace-Lorraine is French, and that any German claim on that territory would be utterly stupid. The people there feel as French citizens and don't want to be part of Germany or even the German cultural sphere anymore.\n\nIn the historical perspective, the situation is different, in particular before the Thirty Years' War, and probably up to the French Revolution. How things were in 1870/71 and 1918/19, we don't really know, as the people in Alsace-Lorraine were never asked about their own opinion. It is nevertheless clear that summing up a thousand years of history, the German character of the region prevailed strongly.\n\nSo the answer to your question in regard to the present would be France, in regard to history Germany.\n\nIt is true that after the French Revolution, the Alsace developed an allegiance to the French state, while still retaining much of its German culture and language. This should have been respected in 1870/71, maybe by means of a referendum. The same is true, however, for 1918/19 - why were people not asked what they wanted? I am not sure about the outcome at that time; a majority towards Germany would have been a possibility.\n\nThe French have always maintained that their understanding of the state and citizenship was different from the German one; and you clearly fell for this nice assertion.

And of course, after 1918/19, the German language was forbidden in Alsace-Lorraine, and all efforts were made to eradicate the language against the will of the people.\n\nThe ethnic cleansing and the language policy after 1918/19 clearly show that French nationalism in practice was not that different from the German one.\n\nYou certainly make an excellent point outlining the difference between French identity in theory and practice. In theory a black Frenchman would be completely equal and fully French if born in French, practiced French customs, etc - but he would certainly face discrimination and stigma of being a newcomer simply due to appearance. One could use the United States as a parallel to this example with French (in theory all Americans were \"equal\" long before the 1960's).\n\nRegarding your question in the top paragraph as to why the inhabitants of Alsace and Lorraine were not put to a democratic vote as so many other regions of Europe were in 1918-1919 - according to the allied powers following the armistice, the Alsatians overwhelmingly welcomed French troops as liberators and the British, Americans, and Italians, decided that a vote would be pointless.\n\nIn my personal \"real life\" experience , all the Alsatians I have ever met (especially those from Strasbourg) have ardently considered themselves completely \"French\" when I asked them if they are \"German\"."
