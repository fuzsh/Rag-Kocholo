        "text": "PacketHop, a start-up based in Belmont, California, secured $10 million in a Series B round of financing for its secure mobile mesh software. PacketHop’s software, which can be loaded onto standard IP radio-equipped devices such as commercial off-the-shelf laptops, tablets and PDAs, enables the devices to form a secure, scaleable and robust mobile broadband network. PacketHop’s mobile mesh network does not require fixed network infrastructure such as base stations or access points to provide communications between devices. When fixed infrastructure is available, it is an additional resource utilized by the mobile mesh network to connect to a network backbone when necessary.\n\nPacketHop is initially targeting the homeland security market.\n\nThe new funding was led by ComVentures and included existing investors U.S. Venture Partners and Mayfield. http://www.packethop.com"
