There Is no tendency to Ignore the pro- posed changes In the United States tariff schedules, and their probable effect on Canada's trade is being noted, but the process now going on Is one merely of gathering Infor- ms Hon. The tariff sdvlsory board Is at work, but It Is stated that the board Is engsged on the Iron snd steel, coal, and fish schedules which were the subject of Inquiry at recent sittings. Naturally the modifica- tions In the United States tariff have a bearing on some of these schedules, snd their effect is being noted. Changes upward in the Ca- nadian tariff can only be made by act of Parliament. Consequently. If the Government should consider it advisable to meet some of the United Slates Increases by upward revision here, such changes would have to wait till the next session of Parliament. The view held here Is that there will probably be no finality in the United Stales tariff until the Fall Then it will be time enough to settle down and determine exactly what the effect on Canada will be That once determined, the Government has intimated that It will be pre- pared to act In the best Interest of Canada.

His particular duty la to ascertain public opinion on im- portant Questions, and transmit them to those Interested on the executive of his famous paper TRADE WITH CANADA Mr. Luke is giving special atten- tion to (he position of the British manufacturer In Canada, owing to what he considers the urgency of proper representation here by men capable of giving decisions, who can give a Canadian Industrialist assur- ance of adapting factory production to his needs, not merely reporting upon conditions. He thinks there are other phases in which British manufacturers can break into the market besides establishment of branch factories, by specializing in commodities not yet made In Can- ada, or In supplying parts which can be given better workmanship In the Old Country than is pracUcable In Canada, and where mass produc- tion can enable them to be supplied at lower prices.

I \\ I l» (...VIUhKl.M. Premier Tolmie. in welcoming the delegates on behalf of '.he PgOViSM of British Columbia, said that such gatherings rendered a most excel- lent service to both countries. It brought about a closer understand- ing between the two peoples and a closer knowledge of each other and each other's problems. This was to be desired, for It was ever the am- MttOn of both countries to maintain that great line of peace, the forty - ninth parallel as it had been main- taUied in the hundred years past — without fort or gun along Its thou- sands of mUes of boundary. The Premier spoke of the prov- ince's natural resources and what was being done to develop the prov- ince by roads and link up with the highways to the south so as to encourage more American visitors to come and get to understand Canadians In the same way as Ca- nadians journeyed south and came to a better understanding of their neighbors Mr. Reginald Hayward.

These combined very Injuriously affected the interests of Canada. During seven months, ending April. 1921. before the aforesaid tariffs went Into effect Canada sold to the United States cattle, horses, poultry and sheep, fruits, grains, grain products, meats, milk and milk products, sefcds, vegetables and miscellaneous products such as eggs, hay. maple sugar, tallow and wool, valued at. $138,845,815. For the same period In the following year the exports of the same class of livestock and farm products had fallen to a value of $32,000,000. In 1928 they rose to $39,000,000. and In 1929 declined in value to approximately $33,000,000. This decline in trade was the direct result of the Fordney-McCumber and the emergency tariffs. Within twelve months, and in a seven -month period, the value of the products of Canadian farms exported to the United States declined In value over $100,000,000 During the fiscal year ending on March 31 last, this Dominion bought from the United States goods to the value of $900,000,000 and sold goods to the value of $500,000,000. Thus the ad- verse balance of trade with the United States is $400,000,000. The goods Canada sells to the United States are made up largely of three Items: Paper and paper products, manufactured lumber and lumber products, and minerals and mineral prod- ucts. Much of the products we sell to the United States are manufacturer on the American side and thus benefit American workmen, while the manufactured goods are in part sold by the United States in the markets of this Dominion. The United 8tates will take all the raw products she can get from this country. She Is making it more difficult all the time for our manufactured product* to find a market In her midst. That has been the American policy ever since 1921 and the United States has found the present Govern- ment at Ottawa quite complaisant under the '.ondltlons that she -continues to impose. Mr. R B. Bennett recently pointed out In Parliament that the American tariffs have led to a sudden decrease In the value of Canadian goods exported to the United States and an improve- ment in the import of goods from the United States Into this Dominion. This country's Imports from the United States have Increased by be- tween $300 000.000 and $400,000,000. as compared with 1912 More than that has happened, said Mr Bennett. . . . \"Our men and women, unable to find employment In this country through the operations of the Fordney-McCumber tariff, have been forced to follow our raw and partly fabri- cated materials to the United States In order to rind Jobs In that country which could not be ob- tained at home. Let us have no misunderstanding about this matter. I have the figures which have been classified by the immigration authorities of the United States of America. In the year •nding June 30. 1922. only 48.465 Canadians went to the United States, the next year, as a direct result of that tariff. 115.635 people went to the south from Canada. In 1924 when the full opera- tion of the Fordney-McCumber tariff was appar- ent, we sent to the United 8tates 200,834 Ca- nadians: In 1925 the migration was 102.496. in 1926 It was 91,786; In 1927 it was 81,982, and for the year ending December 31 last, the figure was 73,80$.\" The migration of Canada's people to the United States has been largely due to the Ford- ney-McCumber tariff which brought about a diminution of exports to the United States and on increase in imports from that country. The logical result was the exodus of our men and women to find occupations In another country, where they haye been, as Mr. Bennett put its. \"fabricating Canadian raw materials, which oc- cupation was denied them at home through the action of the Government.\" History will, no doubt, repeat Itself as a result of the new and Increased American tariffs which are now being considered at Washington. We shall export less and less to the United States and that country will send more and more goods to us and get more of our money, unless the Government of Mr. Mackenzie King takes action. As well, an- other Impetus will be given to the migration of our people in the search for work to the south of the international line It is this condition which Canadians should rouse themselves to prevent They should insist on their Government taking action that will lead to greater manufacture of our raw material in our own country and less export of It for the benefit of others. Canada's clear-cut economic duty is to reply to the ever- growing American tariff barriers by similar action. After all any self-respecting people be- lieve in the protection and conservation of their own heritage for their own development. That is what the United States is doing through its tariff policy. EUROPE S FISH HARVEST Europe came together last month In London to discuss one of the greatest problems of peace, the food supply that the world can draw from the aea. France, Germany. The Irish Free State, and Italy. Poland and Portugal. Norway and all the countries around the Baltic, except Russia, sent their professors and delegates to talk to- gether as to what should be done by this Into- national Council to get the best out of the oceans.

For ex- ample, there was an outcry that the nets of the steam trawlers dragging on the sea bottom were destroying the eggs of the food fishes, but It was proved that, except the herring, which lays it eggs among the rocks and stones, the food fishes did not lay their eggs on the bottom a.t all. It was also shown that the trawlers' nets did not take immature fish. For the purpose of tracing the ocean currents which influence the migra- tions of the food fishes a British marine biolo- gist has invented a new kind of double bottle, one within the other like a thermos flask. The outer bottle has a cork which Is destroyed by sea water and acid after a given time, so that the bottle sinks. The Inner bottle floats on. When a number of these bottles have been set adrift the survivors on some foreign strand tell the direction of the drift. The other bottles, each of a different life period, will be picked up from the nets of trawlers from the bottom and will enable the course of the current to be mapped Till S I I.I Ml FINAN4 1KB Mr. Montague Norman, Oovernor of the Bank of England, sets an example which all men In a position of high trust could emulate, a/id the human race would prob- ably benefit thereby.

The flowers of the wilderness are common property The rosea in the gardens are private property, and it is a sin. if not ac- tually a crime, to pick them snd carry them off. whether singly for the enhancement of our individual charms or In bunches for the adorn- ment of our chambers. ■ • • Apparently this strictly moral or ethical view of the rights of prop- erty is not the common or popular view, for we have been told thought- less persona have begun their sea- sonal habit cf helping themselves to the race* blooming in the gardens of Victoria It is a peculiar fact and an evidence of the idiosyncras- ies of human nature that the people who thus help themselves to the property of other people appear to think they have a natural and com- munal right to do whst they do. and are inclined to be resentful when remonstrated with for doing it and not only destroying to some ex- tent the beauty of the garden* but mutilating the parent trees or bushes. • • » To be sure the gardens of Victoria are to a certain extent common property, for the beauty of them is common property, and everybody should take an Interact In them and a common delight in pro- tecting and preserving them. But the flowers In ihoete beautiful gardens do not Just grow like Topsy or like the wild roses in the un- cultivated and untended lanes and waste places. They are the product of wis* planning and skillful atten- tion, and the cost of making and maintaining them bears a certain relation to their profusion and charm The owners or the gardens therefore take a certain proprietory pride In them, and believe that their rights should be respected.

In- cluded nine province* with their own selected Houses, two province* on the Northwest frontier without House*, and a central Government with eleoted House* over all. This system resembled the Canadian Constitution, he declared. \"But defence, finance and police ore reserved subject*, and are not in the hands of Houses, but are dealt wltti by Governors and Vice- roy -in-Councll. This system of divided responsibility is called Diarchy,\" he asserted. The speaker said people of Punjab, Northwest Frontier and the Mali- rat-ta country, about one- tenth of the whole, wa* virile The remainder were physically and morally de- generate, due to malaria, the cli- mate, and hundreds of years of subjection to Mongol and other in- vaders The degenerates were mentally brighter, and furnish all the agitators. All of these were townspeople. \"The bulk of the people are agri- culturists, and recognise the bene- fits of British rule. Irrigation, roads and rail— and only ask to be let atone, and enjoy a continuation of British rule. \"Agitators are a very small min- ority, but are loud-voiced, and like professional politicians in all coun- tries, they are out for themselves and their friends.\" Colonel Withers stated CAUSES OF UNREST The causes of unrest In India In- cluded the natural result of the iireat War: the talks by Lloyd George and the lata President Wil- son with respect to self-determina- tion, and the self-interest of agi- tators \"Soviet Russia recognises India a* our weak spot, and the British Em- pire a* the bulwark against Com- munism It ha* a special school of Taahkend for training Indian agi- tators. The Montague-Chelmsford reforms gave the idea that the Brit- ish were going to clear out of India shortly, and therefore, each religion and race began organizing to be ready to monopolise power a* soon as we go This began by agitaUon against the BritLsh Oovemment and now breeds intercommunal strife Another cause of unrest was the gradual change in the TIBERIUS the second Roman I emoeror. who wa* adopted by Augustus and became his heir to the throne in 14 AD though one of the first, wa* one ot the crudest Roman ruler* Like so many of his successors. Tiberius at first governed well, and all the province* of the empire during his reign were prosperous. In Rome, however, he showed grow- ing suspicion and cruelty Spies were stationed everywhere, and anyone who spoke against the emperor or opposed him. wa* put to death. He finally met death at the hands of one or his own followers. Tiberius wa* a man of undoubted geniu*. but when he shrouded every act in mystery he became hated and feared. He was assassinated in 37 B.C. up. and it is Inconceivable that no outside power, such a* Russia or Japan, would step into our place. We dare not let go In India.\" con- cluded Colonel Withers, amid pro- longed applause.
