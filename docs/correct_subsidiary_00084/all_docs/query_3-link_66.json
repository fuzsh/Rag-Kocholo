The authors analyze this problem within a Bayesian game framework, in which users are unsure of the legitimacy of the claimed type of other users. RYAN W. THOMAS, BRETT J. BORGHETTI, RAMAKANT S. KOMALI, AND PETRI MÄHÖNEN\n\n38 DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS WITH WIRELESS MICROPHONES The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of dynamic spectrum access operational parameters in a typical hidden node scenario with protected wireless microphones in the TV white space. TUGBA ERPEK, MARK A. MCHENRY, AND ANDREW STIRLING\n\n46 THE VIABILITY OF SPECTRUM TRADING MARKETS The authors focus on determining the conditions for viability of spectrum trading markets. They make use of agent-based computational economics to analyze different market scenarios and the behaviors of their participants. CARLOS E. CAICEDO AND MARTIN B. H. WEISS\n\n54 UNIFIED SPACE-TIME METRICS TO EVALUATE SPECTRUM SENSING The authors present a unified framework in which the natural ROC curve correctly captures the two features desired from a spectrum sensing system: safety to primary users and performance for the secondary users. RAHUL TANDRA, ANANT SAHAI, AND VENUGOPAL VEERAVALLI\n\nADVANCES IN STANDARDS AND TESTBEDS FOR COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORKS: PART II GUEST EDITORS: EDWARD K. AU, DAVE CAVALCANTI, GEOFFREY YE LI, WINSTON CALDWELL, AND KHALED BEN LETAIEF\n\n62 64\n\nGUEST EDITORIAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVISION IN TV WHITE SPACE WITH COGNITIVE RADIO TECHNOLOGY: A TELECOM OPERATOR’S PERSPECTIVE AND EXPERIENCE There is a fundamental change happening in spectrum regulation: the enabling of spectrum sharing, where primary (licensed) users of the spectrum are forced to allow sharing with secondary users, who use license-exempt equipment. MICHAEL FITCH, MAZIAR NEKOVEE, SANTOSH KAWADE, KEITH BRIGGS, AND RICHARD MACKENZIE\n\n74\n\nEMERGING COGNITIVE RADIO APPLICATIONS: A SURVEY\n\n82\n\nINTERNATIONAL STANDARDIZATION OF COGNITIVE RADIO SYSTEMS\n\n90\n\nCOGNITIVE RADIO: TEN YEARS OF EXPERIMENTATION AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are new opportunities for cognitive radio to enable a variety of emerging applications. The authors present a high-level view of how cognitive radio would support such applications JIANFENG WANG, MONISHA GHOSH, AND KIRAN CHALLAPALI The authors describe the current concept of the CRS and show the big picture of international standardization of the CRS. Understanding these standardization activities is important for both academia and industry. STANISLAV FILIN, HIROSHI HARADA, HOMARE MURAKAMI, AND KENTARO ISHIZU Although theoretical research is blooming, hardware and system development for CR is progressing at a slower pace. The authors provide synopses of the commonly used platforms and testbeds, examine what has been achieved in the last decade of experimentation and trials, and draw several perhaps surprising conclusions.

This initiative was started by the previous CIO, Harvey Freeman, supported by Fred Bauer. The major objective of this initiative was to deploy a wide range of applications and to improve the ComSoc ICT Department’s ability to respond to the ICT needs of our constituency in a timely fashion. The team chose Drupal as the platform that would best meet these needs. Drupal is an open source content management platform that is widely accepted around the world. Its applications range from personal blogs to enterprise solutions. Drupal is free, flexible, robust, and constantly being improved by hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic professionals from all over the world. ComSoc’s ICT team has joined this community. We now create our own modules and contribute them to the Drupal community, as well as benefit from the contributions of other community members. The Drupal platform was, and is, ideal for website development, thus leading naturally to ICT replicating comsoc.org on the Drupal platform. The new site, available “24/7,” went live in 2009. New features developed on the Drupal platform include: •A mobile version of the comsoc.org website (http://m.comsoc.org), the first in IEEE. •RSS feeds for ComSoc news, conference events and publications into social media pages setup on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. •A robust Webcast Storefront for the new Conferences Webcast program. •Marketing blog for promotion of the ComSoc website with RSS feeds into Social Media pages. ComSoc’s CIO, Alex Gelman, and the ICT team call on you, the ComSoc volunteers, to join the ComSoc Drupal development team and contribute your work to ComSoc and to the entire Drupal community. If you are interested in the development of this feature-rich content management platform, please e-mail Alex at [email protected].\n\nSERVING MOBILE USERS: SMARTPHONOMICS Under the leadership of ComSoc’s Vice President of Publications, Len Cimini, our Director of On-Line Content, James Hong, proposed a new initiative aimed at providing ComSoc services to members carrying smart phones, or any form of smart devices. James already had his students doing research on the new field of “smartphonomics” (in fact, this may have been the first use of that term). To facilitate the initiative, we created an ad hoc committee on “Smartphonomics,” with Fred Bauer as its Chair. This committee, involving both the ComSoc ICT team and a range of volunteers, has already achieved some goals, including mobile web access to comsoc.org and a ComSoc “app” for iPhones. There is much to be done in this smartphonomics area as an increasing number of members will be using mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet computers to access a growing number of resources, including those of ComSoc. The idea of the smartphonomics initiative is to give our members access to ComSoc material and resources directly from their mobile devices wherever they might be. There are two parts to this problem: 1) serving ComSoc webpages to mobile devices and 2) providing new and interesting content regularly to those mobile devices. The smartphonomics team started with the problem of webpage delivery. Last year, as described above, the ComSoc\n\n8\n\nICT team members, Natasha Simonovski and Matt Sielski, enabled the www.comsoc.org site to recognize smartphone browsers and serve mobile content from the website m.comsoc.org. Currently, ComSoc Drupal-based content is automatically processed for mobile use. This new mechanism allows ComSoc to quickly serve many types of mobile devices conveniently with content stored on m.comsoc.org. The next logical step is to support applications native to the most popular mobile platforms. James Hong and his students at POSTECH graciously built and provided an iPhone application for ComSoc members with an Apple iOS device such as the iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. This application was demonstrated during December’s ComSoc committee meetings, showing how ComSoc members might soon be able to access all of the Communications Society via their smart devices. Smartphonomics service is now available to our members from the Apple App Store for free (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comsoc/id413046307). We plan to provide similar native smart phone applications for Android-based mobile devices soon, and possibly others later on. The second problem to be addressed by the ad hoc Smartphonomics Committee is what content to provide on a regular basis that would be of interest to our members. For this, we draw inspiration from IEEE’s newly created IEEE Technology News website: http://www.ieeetechnews.org. This IEEE website aggregates and summarizes a subset of articles from IEEE periodicals, making the summaries accessible to the general public. The ad hoc Smartphonomics Committee is working with a number of similar groups within ComSoc to identify which regularly updated content we can provide that would interest our members with smart devices. As always, we welcome input from you the reader on what you would like to see on ComSoc’s mobile website. Please direct your comments to Fred at [email protected].\n\nCOMMUNITY AND SOCIAL NETWORKING ComSoc Community Sites The new community site (community.comsoc.org) featuring groups, blogs, forums and news feeds, went on-line in early 2009. The community site was open to all communications professionals, not just IEEE members. Groups were the most popular feature and many ComSoc committees began using them to communicate, share information and files, list events, create discussions, and conduct the day to day business of the groups. Presently, ComSoc hosts several community groups. Each group has its own policies for joining and operation. We encourage all ComSoc communities and groups, including all technical committees, chapters, organizing committees and other groups, to create community sites and use them for their ComSoc activities. ComSoc Blog Sites The ComSoc blog was set up by ComSoc’s ICT Department for the Marketing Department to blog updates on promotions, conferences, etc. All entries are automatically fed into social media sites. This site has attracted quite a few followers on our social media pages and has created significant interest in ComSoc promotions and services. The ComSoc blog is updated by the IEEE Marketing staff, Ting Qian and Max Loskutnikov. Also a blog page has been created on the ComSoc Community site: http://community.comsoc.org/blogs. It is moderated by a prominent volunteer, Alan Weissberger, who is also (Continued on page 10)\n\nIEEE Communications Magazine • March 2011\n\nLYT-PRES PAGE-MAR\n\n2/22/11\n\n2:15 PM\n\nPage 10\n\nTHE PRESIDENT’S PAGE (Continued from page 8) the Chair of the ComSoc Santa Clara Valley Chapter. Alan’s tireless efforts helped to establish, debug, and maintain this site. ComSoc in Social Media ComSoc now has a presence on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/IEEEComSoc) and LinkedIn (http://www. linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid= 81475). ComSoc e-News is also available on Facebook. To receive timely messages from ComSoc, please follow us on twitter: http:// twitter.com/comsoc. In addition, there is a ComSoc channel on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/ ieeecomsoc. The very talented channel creator and artistic director is Max Loskutnikov. On-Line Content The cornerstone of the Society’s on-line content is the ComSoc Digital Library, http://dl.comsoc.org, which contains journals, magazines, conference proceedings, newsletters, online tutorials, and other resources such as distinguished lectures, webinars, and videos. It also contains material related to the IEEE Wireless Communication Engineering Technologies (WCET) certification program. All ComSoc-sponsored journals, magazines, and conference publications can be found in the ComSoc Digital Library. ComSoc newsletters include e-News (http://e-news. comsoc.org), the Global Communications Newsletter (http://dl.comsoc.org/gcn), and the IEEE Wireless Communications Professional Newsletter (http://www.ieee-wcet.org/). ComSoc’s on-line tutorial program, called Tutorials Now, provides a collection of recent tutorials given at ComSoc-sponsored conferences – GLOBECOM/ICC, INFOCOM, NOMS/IM, WCNC, CCNC, ENTNET, SECON, PIMRC and MILCOM. Each tutorial features expert presenters who review current topics in communications, with the aim of bringing newcomers up to speed and keeping others current. Available tutorials, which are 2.5 to 5 hours in length, contain the original visuals and voice-over by the presenter. Distinguished Lectures On-Line provides recorded lectures of distinguished lecturers (DLs) selected by the ComSoc Distinguished Lecturer Selection Committee. DLs are typically invited by ComSoc chapters and sister societies around the world. Having these available on line greatly increases their reach.\n\n10\n\nLive ComSoc Webinars and on-line panel sessions are open to all. Viewers and panelists participate from the convenience of their desks. Webinars focus on technologies, systems and services of current interest to communications engineers and scientists (http://www.comsoc.org/webinars). ComSoc Videos provides video recordings of notable keynote speeches at our major conferences such as the keynote speech on the history of the Internet given by Leonard Kleinrock at GLOBECOM 2007.\n\nMORE SERVICES TO COME The ComSoc ICT team has aggressive plans for the future. Among them is to enable all ComSoc groups, including chapters and our sister societies, to deploy their own community web sites, conduct electronic meetings, and to create and maintain their own mailing lists using LISTSERV. Also in the plan is to enable all conferences to offer webcasts and recorded sessions as well as to make totally on-line conferences a reality. The latter is important for reaching out to those who may not be able to attend conferences in person. We also recognize that many colleagues will still seek the rich experience of attending a conference in person, which is something that current technology is not yet able to replicate. An important task in the works is to change the presentation format for the electronic version of IEEE Communications Magazine, which is included with Society membership. The technology under consideration is FlipBook. The new approach will allow all the features now available with PDF format and more. Tammy Hung is working closely with Jennifer Porcello of ComSoc’s Publications Department to deliver this new format. More features are in the planning stages to leverage the Drupal Content Management System, such as automatic generation of mobile web pages and RSS feeds. In view of Drupal’s power and flexibility, the ComSoc ICT team plans to create a robust digital platform and leverage it to deliver valuable current and future products and services. As presented so far, Communications Society On-Line, a collection of on-line content, products, and services being offered through our ICT platform, has grown rapidly to keep up with the information-sharing needs of our members and the broader community. All those involved with creating our “anytime, anywhere” cyberspace environment, including our ICT team, will continue to develop these capabilities even further. We welcome your input.\n\nIEEE Communications Magazine • March 2011\n\nLYT-CERTIFICATION-MAR\n\n2/18/11\n\n3:36 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nCERTIFICATION CORNER THE NEED FOR RECERTIFICATION BY ROLF FRANTZ In a fast changing field such as wireless communications, technology and the knowledge and skills that go with it can quickly become outdated. WCET certification represents, in a sense, a snapshot in time. The WCP credential indicates that the holder has demonstrated mastery of the field “today.” For those who earned the credential two or three years ago, that “today” is becoming “yesterday.” To maintain the credential in good standing, they need to recertify their knowledge and skills. As stated in the 2011 Candidate’s Handbook (“Recertification,” page 35): “… passing the examination is only one portion of certification. The wireless communication field is constantly changing and requires that wireless communication professionals keep current with changes in the profession. Maintaining an active certification status through recertification is the way in which certified professionals demonstrate their currency and preserve their professional edge. Recertification is required every five years, deter-\n\nIENYCM2854.indd 1 12\n\nmined by the expiration date of your current certification …” The first professionals to earn the WCP credential passed the exam in the Fall of 2008; they will need to recertify in 2013. That seems a long way off, but in reality, preparation for recertification needs to start well in advance. The most obvious way to recertify, of course, is to retake the exam. Passing the 2013 exam, which will have been significantly changed and updated in the intervening five years, will clearly demonstrate that a credential holder has kept up with advances in wireless communications technology. However, as with many other certifica-\n\ntion programs that require recertification, ComSoc is working to provide alternative means for people to demonstrate that they have kept their skills and knowledge current with changes in technology. The formal recertification program is under development, and it is ComSoc’s intent to roll it out later this year. It will include options for recertifying by earning Personal Development Points (PDPs). Among the options under discussion for acquiring PDPs are: •Working in one or more of the seven technical areas covered by the WCET exam, performing tasks and holding responsibilities at the professional level. •Taking training courses from ComSoc and other providers that are specific to technology developments in one or more of the seven technical areas. •Attending professional conferences and workshops that address technical advances in one or more of the seven technical areas. •Participating in relevant sessions of local ComSoc chapters or communities, ranging from attending an educational session to being a featured speaker at such a session. •Authoring papers or articles in recognized industry publications on a topic or topics relevant to the technical areas covered by the WCET exam. •Conducting self-directed study via web-based programs, coaching or mentoring with peers, or individual study leading to a demonstrated increase in job skills and responsibilities. For any of these activities, of course, evidence of completion and success must be compiled and presented for evaluation and validation by a committee of wireless professionals. Accumulation of sufficient PDPs through a combination of varied activities – not just a single activity – would be the basis for authorizing recertification of the WCP credential for another five year period. As noted, the recertification program is currently under development. Comments or suggestions regarding the program (e.g., additional activities that might qualify for PDPs, or relative importance of activities) are welcomed via email to [email protected].\n\n2/16/11 3:25:05 PM IEEE\n\nCommunications Magazine • March 2011\n\nLYT-CONF REP-CCNC-MAR\n\n2/18/11\n\n3:30 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT IEEE CCNC 2011 HIGHLIGHTS LATEST ADVANCES IN ANYTIME, ANYWHERE CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS The IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, CCNC 2011, recently completed its 8th annual event in Las Vegas with hundreds of international consumer communications and networking experts exploring the next generation of technologies designed to provide ondemand, anytime access to entertainment and information anywhere in the world. Held in conjunction with the 2011 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), IEEE CCNC 2011 hosted several keynotes, panels, workshops, tutorials and research prototype demonstrations as well as nearly 350 technical papers highlighting the latest advances in industrial and academic research in a wide range of technologies related to consumer communications and networking: home and wide area networks, wireless and wireline communications, cognitive networks, peerto-peer networking, middleware and other applications enabling technologies, information and applications security, etc. Prior to IEEE CCNC 2011, the conference began showcasing research prototypes at the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) booth at CES located in the Las Vegas Convention Center. Throughout CES and then again at IEEE CCNC 2011, Telcordia demonstrated a research prototype of a real-time search tool that can enable users to save time, money, and bandwidth by previewing videos from different perspectives, rapidly determine their appropriateness prior to launching streaming applications. In addition, Drakontas, a New Jersey-based provider of geospatial tools, offered live demonstrations of its new SMYLE research prototype, which allows user groups to share locations, text messages, photos and graphical annotations in real-time environments. Additional advantages are the ability to collaborate on meeting times and experiences almost anywhere within a building complex, such as a theme park, through the use of the SMYLE mobile phone application or a standard PC web browser. IEEE CCNC 2011 then officially commenced on Sunday, January 9th with a full day of workshops dedicated to topics such as “Vehicular Communications System,” “Personalized Networks, Digital Rights Management Impact on Consumer Communications,” “Social TV: the Next Wave, Social Networking (SocNets)” and “Consumer eHealth Platforms, Services and Applications.” On the following morning, Dr. Simon Gibbs, IEEE CCNC 2011 General Co-Chair and Principal Engineer at Samsung, graciously welcomed all attendees. He thanked the conference’s organizing committee members as well as conference patrons – Samsung, Nokia, HD-PLC, Telcordia, and Drakontas – for help-\n\ning to make IEEE CCNC the flagship Consumer Communications and Networking conference. Afterwards, Dr. Kari Pulli of the Nokia Research Center in Palo Alto, California, addressed the forum about the “demise of film cameras and ascent of digital cameras” during his keynote on “Mobile Computational Photography.” As highlighted by Dr. Pulli, this is a marketplace that will continue to grow over the next five years with more than 150 million digital cameras shipped and nearly 1.1 billion camera phones sold internationally by 2014. Spurred by the introduction of real-time computational technology that allows “instant image processing,” future digital cameras will introduce numerous features that provide “full, lowlevel control of all camera parameters” as well as the ability to “rewrite the autofocus” function so as to combine images to create cleaner, clearer and brighter photos in seconds. Following Dr. Pulli’s speech, IEEE CCNC 2011 then launched the first of two days of technical sessions, technology and applications panels, and research prototype demonstrations in various Consumer Communications and Networking areas including security and content protection, entertainment networking, automotive multimedia, multiplayer networked gaming, next generation IPTV, social media, and personal broadcasting. Specific topics addressed the “Dissemination of Information in Vehicular Networks,” Smart Grid Emerging Services,” Ecological Home Networks” and “Smartphone Location-Aware Technologies.” On Wednesday, the conference program had another full day of keynotes, technical sessions and research prototype demonstrations. In the morning, Dr. Kiho Kim, Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Media & Communication R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, began the proceedings with his address titled “A Future Mobile Outlook: Infrastructure, Device and Service.” In his speech, Dr. Kim mentioned that “In the past, the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) industry’s megatrends - “being digital,” “being networked” and “being mobile” - have led us to paradigm shifts such as the “Internet revolution” of today.” He also said that “In the near future, no later than 2020, new technology enablers in mobile devices and wireless access infrastructures will initiate another paradigm shift. New life care services, in addition to the legacy infotainment services, will be delivered via “intelligent, not just smart,” mobile devices through an enhanced network that seamlessly utilizes local and personal networks.” Later that evening at the conference’s Awards Banquet, Dr.\n\nBen Falchuk demonstrated Telcordia’s latest multimedia visual search technology.\n\nDr. Kiho Kim, Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Media & Communication R&D Center of Samsung Electronics, addressed attendees at the Wednesday Keynote Session.\n\n14\n\nIEEE Communications Magazine • March 2011\n\nLYT-CONF REP-CCNC-MAR\n\n2/18/11\n\n3:30 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT Monica Lam, a Professor of Computer Sciences at Stanford University and the co-author of the “Dragon” book or as it is formally known, “Compliers, Principles, Techniques and Tools,” continued the discussion on future trends, while addressing “In Situ Online Social Networking.” In her presentation, Dr. Lam urged attendees to “ride the mobile computing wave” as she described mobile phones as “the perfect devices for changing the way we network” and “creating more peer-to-peer personal communications.” Dr. Lam also explored the development of new instantaneous group communication systems based on existing email technologies, which will soon create “open federated social networks” and facilitate the sharing of information “among pockets of friends” without the need to utilize third party proprietary infrastructures. The second banquet keynote presentation was by JeanPhilippe Faure, who is the CEO of Progilon and affiliated with HD-PLC consortium. Jean-Philippe is the Chairman of the Broadband over Power Line (BPL) IEEE P1901 Working Group. The IEEE 1901 standard has been recently successfully completed. The presentation focused on merits of the BPL technology that enables Internet Access services as well as in-home, in-vehicle and in-airplane networking over power lines for support of a broad range of applications that include Smart Grid communications, Web browsing, and entertainment. After the keynote presentation, Jean-Philippe Foure was presented a plaque for his achievements as the founding chair of the IEEE P1901 Working Group and for successful completion of the Broadband over Power Line Standard IEEE 1901. The plaque was presented by Alex Gelman, who initiated this standardization project, on behalf of the IEEE Communications Society President Byeong Gi Lee, VP-Technical Activities Mark Karol, and ComSoc Director of Standards Curtis Siller.\n\nThe banquet also featured numerous honors. This included the presentation of the Best Paper Award to Hosub Lee of Samsung Electronics for his paper on “An Adaptive User Interface Based on Spatiotemporal Structure Learning” and Special Mention Honor to Greg Elliott of MIT Media Lab for his paper on “TakeoverTV: Facilitating the Social Negotiation of Television Content in Public Spaces.” The overall Best Student Paper Award was also presented to Peter Vingelmann and Hassan Charaf of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics as well as Frank H.P. Fitzek, Morten Videbæk Pedersen and Janus Heide of the Aalborg University in Denmark for their paper on “Synchronized Multimedia Streaming on the iPhone Platform with Network Coding.” IEEE CCNC 2011 concluded on Wednesday, January 12 with a complete schedule of tutorials offering insights into subjects such as “State of the Art Research Challenges and P2P Networking,” “Cognitive Radio Networks,” “4G - Next Generation Mobile Applications,” “Wireless Mesh Networking Advances and Architectures,” “Consumer Network Standardization,” and “Technologies and Applications for Connecting All Your Electronic Devices with Personal Networks.” As Dr. Robert Fish, CCNC Steering Committee Chairman, mentioned at the banquet, next year, the 9th Annual IEEE Consumer Communications Networking Conference will begin once again with a preview of its comprehensive research demonstrations at the IEEE booth located within CES 2012. In addition, the IEEE CCNC 2012 “Call for Papers” has already been announced with all interested parties urged to visit http://www.ieee-ccnc.org/2012 for submission details.

Held from 6 – 10 December 2010 in Miami, Florida, this annual flagship event of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) set numerous milestones including number of attendees (2,500+); symposia and workshop paper submissions (4,614); lowest tutorial acceptance ratio (8%); highest number of tutorial registrations with over 300 attendees per session; largest team of volunteers (8,500+) contributing to the conference’s success; and the largest number of high-profile invited speakers (100+) delivering keynote and plenary sessions, technical symposia, workshops, panels and tutorials (469). Now considered one of the world’s premier communications conferences, IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 initiated its five-day program on Monday, December 6 with the first of two full days of tutorials and a record-setting 21 workshops. For the first time in conference history, each tutorial session was free-of-charge to all conference attendees, who were extremely pleased with the high degree of diversity in the agenda and high-quality of presentations. Dedicated to the most recent industry and academic advancements, session topics ranged from adaptive wireless communications, wireless MediaNets and biologically-inspired communications to Femtocell networking, broadband wireless access, pervasive group communications and smart communications. The conference then officially commenced on Tuesday, when Executive General Chair Dr. Kia Makki was presented an American flag previously flown at the Florida state capitol building in Tallahassee during the morning introductions. Immedi-\n\nPoster sessions provided networking and educational opportunities.\n\nBusiness & Tech Forums were well received by attendees.\n\n16\n\nately afterwards, IEEE ComSoc President Dr. Byeong Gi Lee highlighted the conference’s general theme of “Mobile Interactivity,” while thanking the ongoing efforts of the society’s 48,000 global members, who are “constantly researching, advancing and working to implement global communications technologies that enhance humanity and everyday life.” Dr. Haohong Wang, the conference’s technical program chair, followed these comments by reviewing the agenda of the largest technical program ever presented at IEEE GLOBECOM since its founding in 1957. Following these introductory remarks, Dr. Regina E. Dugan, Director of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) then challenged all IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 participants to overcome the fear of failure, while reminding everyone that one person can forever change the quality of life for 6.9 billion people worldwide. She also continually reinforced this mission by stating that life is a miracle and the magic that can make all our lives better is needed more now than ever before. During her keynote, Dr. Dugan also noted how “diverse perspectives can lead to innovations that make difficult solutions seem easy.” This includes the use of “cognitive clouds” and social networks that can help surmount dilemmas — for in the end diversity of thought will always surpass ability. After this speech, IEEE GLOBECOM 2010 then proceeded with a three-day program filled with plenary addresses, technical symposia, business & technology forums, awards and exhibits designed to explore the entire range of communications technologies.

While there were only 300,000 corporate users in the entire nation 10 years ago, today Japan’s mobile broadband industry generates $17 billion in revenue and represents 3.4 percent of the country’s GDP. By 2016, estimates also predict that Japan’s mobile broadband market will amass approximately 16 million subscribers. In addition, Wednesday’s well-attended IPv6 Forum began with the very real fact that the entire spate of global IPv4 Internet addresses will be exhausted within the next two years and the transition to IPv6 has “already taken five years too long.” As a result, many of the session’s speakers concurred that “if you do not transition to IPv6, you will not be a player in the Internet.” Subsequently, the effort to integrate IPv6 into existing and new infrastructures has seen “more activity in the past year than the previous 10 years combined.” Although in the early stages, this includes providing consumers with IPv6 connectivity options in the very near future. Furthermore, the forum’s distinguished panel of experts offered advice to any and all service and content providers dealing with IPv4 issues. First, “Don’t wait for customers to ask for IPv6. You won’t have the time to react.” Next, “Never pay for IPv6 beyond the service for IPv4. Run from vendors that want to charge extra.” And, education is key. Dispel IPv6 myths and fears by investing in training and classes that inform all interested parties on the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, while advising on their similarities. Other sessions such as the “Wireless Communications Forum” dealt with the challenges of servicing the world’s mobile device users, which already includes 4.1 billion subscriptions and\n\n17\n\nLYT-CONF REP-GLOBECOM-MAR\n\n2/24/11\n\n12:34 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT the “Smart Grid and Green Technology Forum” that offered a host of options for enabling cost savings and lowering energy use through the implementation of smart appliances and meters on a global scale. Additional Wednesday highlights included plenary addresses on highly sensitive areas like “Energy-Efficient Wireless Applications,” “Multidimensional Convergence of Broadband Access Technologies,” “Physical Layer Security in Wireless Networks” and “Smart Phones: A Revolution in Mobile Computing.” On Thursday, Dr. Niki Pissinou, the conference’s operation chair, introduced Dr. Frederica Darema, the director of the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, to open the day’s proceedings. Dr. Darema’s keynote detailed the U.S. Air Force’s concept of network system science and the fundamental aspects of its practical impact.

This was a key message of a two-day roundtable conference entitled “Addressing Europe’s Digital Divide: Towards Sustainable Public Service Media in South East Europe.” Organized by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) Secretariat and the Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the meeting was held in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 14–15 October, 2010. It was attended by more than 50 general directors, media experts, and government, broadcast and regulatory officials. In a “way forward to 2020” signed by EBU Vice-President Claudio Cappon and RCC Secretary General Hido Biscevic, the conference participants agreed: •To establish an enduring cooperation to ensure the sustainability of all public service broadcasters in southeast Europe by 2020 •To promote the values and principles of public service media, as recognized by the Council of Europe and the European Union •To call on the European Union to support these goals politically and financially under its aim to guarantee European cohesion The conference highlighted the need for the public broadcasters, relevant ministries, and regulators in southeast Europe to join forces to ensure that the region does not lag behind the rest of Europe in meeting deadlines for digitalization and analogue switch-off. The participants agreed that the region’s public broadcasters in the digital era need to remain key actors in the evolving knowledge society, provide reliable information, quality educa-\n\n2\n\ntional, cultural and entertainment programmes, and be motors for regional development and investment in the creative industries. Speaking at the conference, Minister of Communications and Transport of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rudo Vidovic, told the conference that digitalization would create a “free and open media market. This momentum needs to be seized.” Mr. Biscevic said sustainable public service media were vital for the countries of southeast Europe as a whole, and for the European Union they hope to join. But he said their role was threatened by a lack of investment in infrastructures “and also in human capital.” In an opening keynote speech, EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre said public service broadcasters needed to play a leading role in the digitalization process in southeast Europe as they have played elsewhere on the continent. Conference speakers included Peter Karanakov, Executive Director, MKRT; Natasa Vuckovic Lesendric, Assistant Minister for the Media, Ministry of Culture of Serbia; Marija Nemcic, Deputy HRT General Manager for International Relations; Bledar Meniku, Ministry for Innovation, Information Technology and Communication of Albania; Maria Luisa Fernandez Esteban, Directorate General for the Information Society and the Media, European Commission; and Oliver Vujovic, Secretary General of the South East Europe Media Organisation.

ICAIT has been a yearly event since 2008 to bring together researchers, scientists, engineers, academicians, and students all around the world to share the latest updates on new technologies that will enhance and facilitate the next generation of information and communications systems and technologies. ICAIT forges links between nations, and builds bridges between the academic and non-academic communities, and between government and non-government organizations. Submissions from about 20 countries for technical presentations were received for ICAIT 2010. The papers went through peer reviews, nominally two or more reviews per paper, to ensure quality. We were highly honored to have two renowned keynote speakers, Prof. Muriel Medard from MIT, United States, and Prof. Anthony TS Ho from Surrey University, United Kingdom, to share with us their insight and perspectives on current trends, convergence technologies, and the strategic updates. ICAIT 2010’s venue, Hainan, the second largest ocean island and smallest land province in China, is located at the (Continued on Newsletter page 4)\n\nICAIT 2010 Conference Opening: (from left to right) Prof. Du Wencai from Hainan University; Prof. Muriel Medard from MIT; Prof. Fu Guohua, Vice president from Hainan University; and Prof. Anthony TS Ho from Surrey University.\n\nStudent volunteers from Hainan University.\n\nJitel and Telecom I+D: Spanish Rendezvous Points for TLC Professionals By Pilar Manzanares-Lopez and Josemaría Malgosa-Sanahuja, Spain The 9th Conference on Telematic Engineering (IX Jornadas de Ingeniería Telemática, JITEL 2010) took place from 29 September to 1 October in the University of Valladolid, Spain. This conference tries to be a propitious forum for the Spanish research groups on networking and telematic services. It tries to encourage both the interchange of experiences and results and the cooperation among the researching groups working in this field of knowledge. The origin of this conference dates back to 1997 when, coinciding with the centenary of the Telecommunication Faculty of Bilbao, it took place in the University of the Basque Country. Since then, JITEL was organized biannually until 2005 and, due to its great success, it has been held annually since 2006. Each edition takes place in a different city, at Spanish universities all around the country. JITEL is co-sponsored by the IEEE Spanish Section. Traditionally, the best papers are published in IEEE America Latina Transactions Magazine. In addition, the best two papers related to telematic engineering education will be published in a book called TIC Aplicadas a la Ingeniería (TICAI), an initiative of the Spanish IEEE Education Society.\n\nIn this last edition of JITEL, with the challenge of adapting the current studies to the new European Higher Education Area, the 1st Symposium on Educational Innovation on Telematic Engineering (I Jornadas de Innovacion Educativa en Ingenieria Telematica, JIE 2010) was created. This is a new forum where university staff can meet and exchange experiences in innovations in networking and telematic teaching, and also in the use of information and communication technologies in higher education in general and this technical area in particular. JITEL 2010’s schedule was coordinated with the XX Telecom I+D conference, with part of the session program coinciding with it. Telecom I+D is a meeting point for members of the academic world (universities and the main research centers) and members of the business world (national and international leading companies in this sector) to advance the interchange of experience and dissemination of knowledge, focused on the promotion of technological innovation. Under the lemma “20 Years Leading the Innovation to Change the Future,” Telecom I+D 2010 was focused on the commitment of ICT to society.

The congress was organized by SPIIRAS (an institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences), Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia (Moscow), and Tampere University of Technology (Finland). The IEEE Russia Northwest BT/CE/COM Chapter was a technical co-sponsor of the conference along with the Popov Society (a professional society of Russian radio and communication engineers). Patrons and supporters of the congress were Nokia, Nokia Siemens Networks, and other organizations. The technical program of ICUMT 2010 included five keynote talks by internationally recognized industrial and academic speakers, seven specialized workshops, and two main congress tracks: telecommunications andcontrol/robotics. Congress proceedings include about 200 papers selected frommore than 320 submissions with the help of more than 250 Technical Program Committee members, reviewers, and workshop chairs. The congress was attended by over 200 participants. New insights in radio technologies as well as the coexistence of research in control systems, robotics, and telecommunications were key topics of the congress. Keynote speakers presented insights and trends in vehicular ad hoc networks, networking security, multicarrier solutions, society of robots, and human-robot interaction. Significant scientific contributions were presented in the areas of applied problems in theory of probabilities and mathematical statistics, advanced sensing and control, systems of systems, mobile computing, reliable network design, and fiber optic systems. An industrial panel session, “The ICT Future by the Year 2015,” was organized by representatives of the top management from HewlettPackard, Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, Oracle Communications, Nokia, Nokia Siemens Networks, and Telecom Italia.\n\nGlobal Newsletter www.comsoc.org/pubs/gcn\n\nSTEFANO BREGNI Editor Politecnico di Milano - Dept. of Electronics and Information Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 MILANO MI, Italy Ph.: +39-02-2399.3503 - Fax: +39-02-2399.3413 Email: [email protected], [email protected] IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SOCIETY\n\nKHALED B.

The final two sessions in ICIN covered business opportunities in networks and future trends. The business opportunities session explored the impact on communication business of convergence with the Internet, necessitating operator strategy adjustments. The future opportunities session presented a series of new concepts including application of peer-to-peer networking concepts to increase network flexibility, techniques for using context, and strategies for managing data volume increases required to deliver multimedia services with high quality of service (QoS). At the closing session, TPC Chair Max Michel reviewed highlights of the conference, and Roberto Minerva (Telecom Italia Laboratories) discussed a recent ConnectWorld article on “deperimeterization.” Delegate feedback on ICIN was extremely positive. On the final day, two workshops were provided in conjunction with ICIN: The Second International Workshop on Business Models for Mobile Platforms, chaired by Pieter Ballon of Vrieje Universitet Brussel, Belgium; and Telecom Transformation: Are You Ready? delivered by Eileen Healey of Healey & Co. Both were well attended and thought provoking. Planning for ICIN 2011 is already underway under the leadership of Roberto Minerva of Telecom Italia Laboratories, TPC Chair for ICIN 2011.
