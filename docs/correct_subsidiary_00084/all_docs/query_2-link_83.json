Integrate these two performance metrics by using the future route lifetime-prediction algorithm select the smallest amount dynamic route with the highest lifetime for unrelenting data forwarding and based on quadrant. Our predictable route Adaptive Routing aware optimal position prediction protocol in an explore dynamic nature routing for manet procedure environment based on Adhoc on demand distance vector routing (AODV).\n\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient greedy location-aided routing (GLAR) scheme to improve the efficiency of location-aided routing (LAR) scheme for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this scheme, we first decide a baseline, which is the line between the source node and the destination node, for route discovery. The request packet is broadcasted in a request zone based on the baseline to determine the next broadcasting node. The neighboring node with the shortest distance to the baseline is chosen as the next broadcasting node. Thus, we can find a better routing path than LAR scheme to reduce the network overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed GLAR scheme outperforms LAR scheme. Key-Words: Expected zone, Global positioning system, Location-aided routing, Mobile ad hoc networks, Request zone.\n\nMANET is self-configured Mobile Ad hoc network of mobile nodes connected via random topology. The main issue in MANET is the selection of best path between any two nodes. Routing in MANET is to find the efficient path to transfer the data from source to destination. APU strategy is routing strategy for geographic routing in Mobile ad-hoc network which dynamically adjust the frequency of position updates based on the mobility dynamics of the nodes and the forwarding patterns in the network. The beacon updates include the current location and velocity of the nodes. An Enhanced APU strategy in the proposed system use destination aware routing with minimum distance dynamically adjusts the beacon update intervals based on the minimum distance from source to destination, mobility dynamics of the nodes and the forwarding patterns in the network. Results of the proposed system are compared with Periodic Beaconing on the basis of packet delivery ratio, beacon overhead, energy consumption. Experiment results show a high improvement in results on the parameters discussed. Energy consumption in Periodic beacon scheme is high compared to proposed system since periodic beacon causes high energy consumption in the nodes. APU saves energy by avoiding unnecessary beacon update and do the beacon update adaptively. Beacon overhead in Periodic beacon scheme is high compared to proposed system due to periodic beacon. Proposed system reduces the beacon overhead by avoiding unnecessary beacon update and only does the beacon update process adaptively."
