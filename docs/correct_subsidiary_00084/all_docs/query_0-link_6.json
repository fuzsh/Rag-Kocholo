They harken back to the days of travel agents, where consumers could ask tough travel questions like ” What are the best hotels near the beach that are kid-friendly?”. A recent spinout from SRI International, They are working on game changing technology that leverages natural language search technology and artificial intelligence to let users find precisely what they are looking for based on multiple criteria, not just price or travel dates.

They believe that the true opportunities for the future of autonomy lie in unlocking the ability for human and machine to work together to solve the most difficult problems driverless vehicles face. The path of progress for the autonomous vehicle is blocked by the idea that complete vehicle autonomy is the goal. They believe safe tele-operation subsumes level 5 autonomy, so instead of removing humans from the driving experience entirely, we’re keeping the humans in, virtually."
