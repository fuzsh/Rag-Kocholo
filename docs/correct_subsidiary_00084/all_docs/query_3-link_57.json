Tht datCroetlon of llrabar goinf on •U over thla continent is a matter rcRarded by Mr. Barnjum with poignant regret. By a cam- paign of publicity, oonduetad antlrtly at hla own axpenae. he is seeking to arouse the public con- •elanca to the ravagea of fire, of insects, and, frtiftt to parHapa moat aarloai otlHi. to tho rav- AKis connoted by the present-day methods of tuuber-cutting for commercial pufposes. He sees tai fdMU to fotaiff on a proeaaa of waata on a prodigal •eala, and to the extent that he has been able to arouaa othara to a sense of responsibility he is a benafaetor of Whom Oaimda may wall bo proud. Mr Barnjum foresees a world shortage of wood and one of a serious character. He urges partteQlariy thoaa wHhtai the Empire, to purchase and con-scrvc every. Of forest that can be secured for a reason- ftMo fHnbe. In hto tadtrMual capacity ha has purchased a number of tracts of timber and so set a notable example. In regard to An Empire policy he says that leonlrol of a majority of the remaiiiinK available wooded aroa.s. with the anormousljr advancing values which are bound vait itHinif to oeew. wo«M gtn lha Kmpire ' greater prestige than control of the gold supply for no amount of gold can replace f oraats within tho llfillwa or two itnorotkma, nor tho few thotuands of acrea Of oof romotnlng Uf troti In fifteen generaUom.'* Mr. Bamjvm haa naturally ttimed hla atten Hon to Brltl.sh Cohimbiii where some of the la.st •tBS4s Umber on a large scale remain on this ootaitMiit. ■« haa atodlM the prodigality in use of lumber In this province and sees In It a dire menace to the future supply.

His crusade, however, has not, as yet, feoaived the ofBctol reeogaltleii that to fti dtie. It Is iiotewnrthy that Mr Barnjum should have seen in the work of destruction by Saanlch MUnlelpamy at Momit Douglas an Illustration of the ofnclal apathy which exists towards the wooded beauUes of thto vicinity. With his broad knowledge he has seized upon the essential features of what is purely a local problem He deprecataa anything that will destroy the beau- tlaa if Mount Douglas Park, and In his atutude he lias the support of every nature lover in this community.
