Networking and security are the most exciting careers in information technology. Heck, they are the most exciting careers in the world. Professionals in these fields do not spend their careers just doing the same thing over and over again. Their work is constantly evolving, and personal growth is guaranteed.\n\nHOW TO STUDY NETWORKInG Networking and Security Are Different Some students find networking and security difficult. The problem seems to be that they require a different learning approach than programming and database management. In programming and database, you learn a little, apply it, learn a little more, apply it, shampoo, rinse, repeat. If there is something you don’t know, there is probably another way to do it. (Except on exams and homework, of course.) In networking, you need to know everything to do anything, and it is what you don’t know that hurts you. For example, suppose that you want to connect a server to an Ethernet switch. This sounds simple enough. However, should you choose copper wire or optical fiber? If copper wire, what grade of copper wire? If fiber, which OM standard should you choose? Or should you connect the server wirelessly? In your choice, you must include speed, distance, delay, reliability, and cost. Especially cost. Budgets are eternally tight, and networking people never say “cost doesn’t matter.” Security is different again. In security, you are not just dealing with design issues and the reliability of technology. You are dealing with human opponents that are engaged with you in a perpetual arms race of protections and new attack methods to get beyond those protections. It is a lot like playing a video game at a high level, but with real-world consequences. Will employers expect you to know everything when you apply for a job? Of course not. However, they will expect you to know a lot. They will sit you down and ask you how to connect a server to an Ethernet switch or something else that requires you to be able to integrate what you have learned. In fact, they will do this for the material in most courses you have taken to get an understanding of how serious you are about work. You will certainly get questions that require you to troubleshoot a problem. Troubleshooting is hard, and most people intuitively do it wrong. This book will give you a methodology for doing it right and plenty of practice in applying it. Employers will expect applicants to be up in the field. For Wi-Fi, they may ask you about security, and they don’t expect you to stop at 802.11i. Mentioning Ethernet busses and hubs in a design may end the interview. Employers expect applicants to have some knowledge of IPv6 and cloud computing. They will be interested if you know even a little about SDN.\n\nxxi\n\nxxii\n\nPreface for Students\n\nLearning with this Book organization of the Book We have tried to write this book to help you learn the material. Most basically, we present the material in short sections with Test Your Understanding (TYU) questions immediately after each section, to help you know if you have understood the section. Pay special attention to keyterms that are boldfaced. These are the core concepts in the field. And yes, there are a lot of them. Important or frequently misunderstood concepts are broken out like this for special attention: A rogue access point is an unauthorized access point set up within a firm by an employee or department.\n\nFigures cover almost all important concepts in the book. There are special study f­igures that summarize the flow and key points in most sections that are not amenable to illustrations. The PowerPoint presentations are based on these figures. For complex ­illustrations, the PowerPoint presentations have builds, presenting only part of the ­figure at each step. If you see a term that you learned previously but have forgotten, go to the Glossary. In Glossary entries, some page numbers are boldfaced. These are the pages on which the term was defined or characterized. Some terms are introduced more than once and may have two or more page numbers boldfaced. Studying for Exams Exams are the least popular elements in any course. And yes, you will have dreams about waking up late for an exam for several years after you graduate. However, there are things you can do to make your life easier. First, study the material. Read a section. Do the TYU questions. In fact, download the homework file, which has all the questions. Put your answers into the file. The multiple choice questions in the test bank are taken from the material in the TYU questions and thought questions. A good idea is to read the material over before exams instead of just relying on your initial answers, which might not have been exactly perfect, having been based on your first reading. Late in your study, describe the figures as if you were giving a lecture. If there is something you do not understand, note it and follow up. Take notes on your problems and insights. At each step, ask yourself why each question and answer is important. This will give you insights and will solidify the material in your memory. Upper-Division Learning Initial college education focuses on learning isolated\n\nfacts. Networking and security, like other advanced courses, requires something more. First, it requires the ability to compare and contrast concepts you have learned. In networking and security, there are alternative ways to do almost everything. Understanding individual alternatives is not enough. To select the best alternative, you must understand trade-offs between them. You must also see them in the broader context of the chapter. For 802.11 Wi-Fi, 802.11i provides a lot of protection; but there\n\nPreface for Students xxiii\n\nare other things you must also do to be secure. Life is about trade-offs. Your studying must reflect that. Another pain point is learning multi-step procedures. It is important to learn the overall flow, understand how each step relates to the flow, understand each step, and do this all over again until you have both the flow and the details. Processes are difficult to learn because you do not have a framework clearly in mind for fitting individual facts into the bigger picture. In learning processes, it takes several cycles of studying at multiple levels to get both the overall flow and the individual steps.\n\naboUt tHe aUtHors Ray Panko is a professor of IT management and a Shidler Fellow at the University of\n\nHawai‘i’s Shidler College of Business.

In 2013, it was 39%.2 • In 2012, online video viewing overtook DVD and Blu-Ray viewing.3 • From 2011 to 2016, global IP traffic will triple, and the number of connected devices will nearly double.4 • In 2016, Cisco expects the Internet to carry one zettabyte of data.5 A zettabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one sextillion) bytes. • By 2020, there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet—ten times the number of human users. The great majority of these will be devices talking to other devices, without human involvement.6\n\nNetflix Dives Into the Amazon7 Figure 1-1 shows that the Internet is often depicted as a cloud. This symbolizes that just as you cannot see inside a cloud, users should be oblivious to what happens inside the Internet. To them, the Internet simply works, like the electrical, water, and telephone systems. In this course, as you might suspect, you will not be spared the burden of understanding the internals of the Internet and other networks. This knowledge will prepare you to help your employer use networks effectively. Along the way, you will learn a good deal about security, too. Networking is a vast superhighway with great potential for benefits. However, it has some rough neighborhoods. 1 Suzanne Choney, “US Has More Internet-Connected Gadgets Than People,” nbcnews.com, January 2, 2003. http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/us-has-more-internet-connected-gadgets-people-1C7782791. 2 Geneva, “Key ICT Indicators for Developed and Developing Countries and the World (Totals and Penetration Rates),” International Telecommunications Unions (ITU), February 27, 2013. 3 Jared Newman, “Online Video Expected to Overtake DVD, Blu-ray Viewing this Year,” Techhive, May 27, 2012. http://www.techhive.com/article/252650/online_video_expected_to_overtake_dvd_blu_ray_viewing_this_ year.html. 4\n\nLarry Hettick, “Cisco: Networked Devices Will Outnumber People 3 to 1 in 2016,” Network World, June 1, 2012. http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/converg/2012/060412convergence1.html 5 Grant Gross, “Cisco: Global ‘Net Traffic to Surpass 1 Zettabyte by 2016, Cisco Says,” Network World, May 31, 2012. http://www.pcworld.com/article/256522/cisco_global_net_traffic_to_surpass_1_zettabyte_in_2016.html 6\n\nEricsson, “CEO to Shareholders: 50 Billion Connections 2020,” press release, April 2010.

First, any computer attached to a network is a host. Hosts include large servers that work with hundreds of users simultaneously. Hosts also include desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart glasses, and smart watches. In the future, hosts will include interactive walls, tables, and appliances that will turn your entire home into an immersive interactive environment. In a trend called the Internet of things, even coffee makers, toasters, medical implants, and many other small and large devices around us will be hosts that communicate through networks to work better. In fact, machine-to-machine communication will eventually dominate traffic on the Internet. The term host is not an obvious name for computers that attach to networks, but it is the common name for them in networking. Any computer attached to a network is a host.\n\nMessages and Addresses Figure 1-1 shows that application programs on different hosts communicate by sending messages to one another. Messages require addresses. For example if you want to send the first author a message, you would send it to his e-mail address, [email protected]. Hosts also need addresses. On the Internet, these are Internet Protocol addresses or IP addresses. In Figure 1-1, the IP addresses are 1.2.3.4 for the source host and 5.6.7.8 for the destination host. Dotted Decimal Notation (DDN) When an IP address is expressed as four numbers separated by dots (periods), this is called dotted decimal notation (DDN). In reality, IP addresses are 32-bit strings of 1s and 0s. Computers have no problem working with long bit strings. Human memory and writing, however, need a crutch to deal with long bit strings. Dotted decimal notation is precisely that—a crutch for inferior biological entities like ourselves. Computers do not use DDN.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud 32 IP address bits divided into four 8-bit segments Segment converted to decimal IP address in dotted decimal notation (DDN)\n\n00000001\n\n00000010\n\n00000011\n\n00000100\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.2.3.4\n\nFigure 1-2 Dotted Decimal Notation\n\nFigure 1-2 shows how to convert a 32-bit IP address into dotted decimal notation. • First, divide the 32 bits into four 8-bit segments. • Second, treat each segment as a binary number and convert this binary number into a decimal number. For example, the first segment, 00000001 in binary, is 1 in decimal. • Third, combine the four decimal field values, separating them by dots. This gives 1.2.3.4. How do you convert a binary number into a decimal number? The fastest way is to go to an Internet search engine and find a binary-to-digital converter. You then type each 8-bit binary segment’s bits into the indicated binary box and hit the convert button. The decimal value appears in the decimal box. We have been looking at a 32-bit IP address. However, this is not the only type of IP address. It is an IP Version 4 (IPv4) address. IPv4 is the dominant IP protocol on the Internet today. However, we are beginning to see significant use of IP Version 6 (IPv6). As we will see in Chapter 8, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are represented for human consumption in a very different way.

Instead, the Internet is a collection of thousands of single networks and smaller internets. All of these single networks and smaller internets interconnect to form a single transmission system that in\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud The Internet\n\nMIT.edu (organizational internet)\n\nAmazon.com (organizational internet)\n\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) Internet Service Provider (ISP)\n\nCloud Service Provider (organizational internet)\n\nSal’s House (small single network)\n\nThe Internet Core Figure 1-3 The Internet’s Networks and Smaller Internets\n\nprinciple allows any Internet host to reach any other.8 Some of these single networks and smaller internets are owned by organizations such as Amazon.com or MIT. Smaller networks are owned by families and even individuals. In addition, some internets link these smaller networks and smaller internets together. We call these linking internets Internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs collectively form the core of the Internet, which is also called the Internet’s backbone.9 To use the Internet, a customer must connect to an ISP. The Internet is a collection of single networks and smaller internets. All of these networks and smaller internets interconnect to form a single transmission system.\n\nAt this point, we need to break the narrative to mention in two pieces of terminology we will use in this book. • First, saying “single networks and internets” is cumbersome. We use the term ­network for both. • Second, in this book, we spell internet in lowercase for internets in general and internets that are not the global Internet. We capitalize the global Internet. Who owns the Internet? The surprising answer is, “Nobody.” The ISPs and other organizations own their pieces of the Internet. Who controls the Internet? Again, ­nobody does. Although the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) creates standards, 8\n\nThe original term for internet was catanet. When things are connected together in computer science, they are said to be concatenated. Fortunately, “catanet” never caught on, saving the Internet from a flood of bad feline jokes. 9 For simplicity, the figure shows ISPs as if they served nonoverlapping geographic regions. Actually, ISPs often overlap geographically. National and international ISPs may connect at several geographical locations to exchange messages.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nnetwork owners decide which standards to adopt. There is no overall authority to enforce standards or to govern interconnection business practices. Everything is negotiated between the network and internet owners. Who pays for the Internet? You do. Users pay ISPs, who work out arrangements with other ISPs to deliver your messages. You probably pay around $30 per month to your ISP. Businesses pay thousands or millions of dollars annually. With rare exceptions, no government money sustains the Internet. Test Your Understanding 4. a) Is the Internet a single network? Explain. b) What is the role of ISPs? c) Who controls the Internet? d) Who funds the Internet?\n\nNetflix Dives into the Amazon You know personally how individuals use the Internet. The corporate experience is often very different. We will illustrate this by talking about how Netflix uses the Internet. Netflix is a commercial streaming video service with tens of millions of customers around the world. Streaming video places a heavy load on network capacity. For a two-hour high-definition movie, Netflix must deliver five million bits (1s or 0s) each second. This is a total of nine gigabytes for that one movie. On any given night, Netflix accounts for roughly a third of the Internet traffic going into U.S. homes. Requirements Users expect high video quality, and they will not tolerate delay or unreliability. The Internet was not designed for these requirements. The Internet is a “best effort” delivery system that often has insufficient speed and reliability and that often has too much delay for Netflix users. Netflix had to overcome these limitations. The Internet is a “best effort” delivery system.\n\nVideo streaming also requires vast amounts of server processing capacity beyond the demands of actual streaming. Each movie must be transcoded into many streaming formats, and when a customer requests a movie, streaming servers have to select the best transcoded format for that particular customer. In addition, at the heart of Netflix’s business plan is an application that creates personalized viewing suggestions for individual customers. This requires the analysis of extensive data about the customer’s viewing habits and the choices of other customers with similar viewing profiles. Outsourcing In 2008, when Netflix was only delivering movies through mailed DVDs, the company suffered a crippling server outage that stopped shipments for several days. That was a wake up call for Netflix. Management realized that reliability would be critical for the online delivery it would soon introduce. It also realized that while Internet delivery would become its core business, managing servers would not. Rather than developing the expertise needed for the complex server technologies the company needed, Netflix decided to outsource server operation to a company that could meet Netflix’s high requirements for capacity, reliability, and agility in responding to sudden demand changes.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nCustomer\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\nOrdering AWS Regional Server Farm\n\nAWS Regional Server Farm\n\nRedundancy for Fail-Over\n\nProcessing Tasks: Customer ordering Content transcoding Analysis of viewing patterns Netflix\n\nContent Uploads Video Content Providers\n\nFigure 1-4 Netflix and Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nNetflix chose Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon had leveraged its expertise in managing vast server farms for its e-commerce needs into a cloud service that customers like Netflix could use without worrying about how the servers are operated. Figure 1-4 shows that AWS’s enormous server farms had the capacity that Netflix needed for customer ordering, transcoding, and the analysis of viewing patterns. In addition, Amazon had multiple regional server farms with high fail-over capabilities. Even the loss of an entire server farm would not disrupt service for more than minutes. This brought the reliability that Netflix customers demanded. Netflix customers today log into an AWS server to order videos and to take care of other business transactions with Netflix. There are many login servers, and AWS automatically routes the user to one of them. Movie content providers upload their video directly to AWS. Netflix then transcodes the contents into many versions optimized for particular combinations of network speed and customer equipment. Content Delivery Netflix uses AWS to store more than one petabyte of movie content in multiple locations. However, Netflix handles content delivery ­itself. Figure 1-5 shows how Netflix delivers video content to individual customers. Netflix calls this content delivery network (CDN) Open Connect. To stream movies to users, Netflix created its own webserver appliances. Each is a relatively small box that can fit into a standard 19-inch (48-cm) wide equipment rack. The Open Connect appliance is seven inches (18 cm) high and two feet (61 cm) deep. Although small in size, it holds about 100 terabytes of data on 36 hard disk drives. The processor is fast enough to stream movies simultaneously to between 10,000 and 20,000 customers. Netflix updates these CDN servers about once a year with newer hardware to increase their capabilities. Figure 1-5 shows that Open Connect is a network on the Internet. It can peer with (connect to) the ISP of a customer. The CDN boxes are placed at the peering point, so\n\n7\n\n8\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nNetflix Open Connect Content Delivery Network (CDN) Open Connect Appliance at Peering Point Peering Point\n\nPeering Point\n\nCustomer ISP\n\nCustomer ISP Streaming Content\n\nCustomer\n\nStreaming Content Open Connect Appliance on ISP Premises\n\nCustomer\n\nFigure 1-5 The Netflix Open Connect Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n\nthat traffic only travels the relatively small span of the customer’s Internet service provider network. In many cases, ISPs reduce delays further by placing the appliance on their own premises, at a location near the final customer. ISPs tend to like this approach because it reduces traffic flowing across their network. The streaming traffic only goes the short distance from the nearest ISP physical location to the customer. With only 100 TB of data storage, Open Connect appliances can only handle a portion of Netflix’s 1 petabyte of content. Consequently, Netflix uses sophisticated analysis to identify the 100 TB of content most likely to be demanded by customers. It installs this content on the individual CDN servers. Of course, customer interests change rapidly, so this content has to be refreshed daily. During quiet periods in demand each day, Netflix deletes content declining in popularity and installs content of increasing demand. Test Your Understanding 5. a) List Netflix’s content delivery requirements. b) What is transcoding? c) Why does Netflix make many transcoded versions of each movie? d) How does Netflix use AWS? e) How do content delivery networks reduce streaming delays to customers?\n\nVirtualization and Agility Figure 1-6 shows that AWS uses virtualization to turn each physical server into several virtual machines (VMs). Each VM is a software process running on the physical server. However, it acts like a real server in its connections with the outside world. It has its own IP address as well as its own data. It is even managed like a real server. Using virtual machines gives an organization agility, which is the ability to make changes quickly—even very large changes. For example, Amazon can move VMs quickly from one physical server to another simply by transferring their files. It can even move VMs to servers quickly to different regions of the world. In addition, new VM instances ­(specific virtual machines) can be added in seconds. In fact, a company can spawn (instantiate)\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nFour Physical Servers in Racks Traditionally, a Server Was a Single Physical Server\n\nOne Physical Server Can Run Several Virtual Machines (VMs). Each Acts as a Server.\n\nVMs Can Be Moved Easily to Other Physical Servers.\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs)\n\nNew Instances of a VM Can Be Created in Seconds.\n\nMore VMs Can Be Added Temporarily.\n\nFigure 1-6 Server Virtualization through Virtual Machines\n\nmany copies of the same virtual machine at once, in no more time it takes to spawn a single VM instance. Physical servers offer nothing like this degree of agility. To make virtualization even more attractive to customers like Netflix, AWS provides a simple self-service ­application for customers to use to add new instances and do many other things themselves. Content delivery is not the only way Netflix uses Amazon Web Services. Transcoding each movie into a hundred or more versions for delivery is an enormous task. Whenever Netflix needs to transcode a movie, it spins up (spawns) a large number of VMs, splits the work up among them, processes the data in parallel, and then spins them down. Providing customized viewing recommendations to subscribers also requires an enormous amount of processing power because it uses an extremely sophisticated analysis of individual user viewing practices and the viewing practices of people who have viewed similar movies. This recommendation system also requires Netflix to spin up large numbers of servers for short periods of time. Even in content delivery, the ability to spawn and kill VMs quickly is critical. During peak evening viewing time in the United States, Netflix spins up many additional VMs for content delivery. It spins them down later to save money. Test Your Understanding 6. a) Distinguish between physical servers and virtual machines. b) What can be done with virtual machines that would be difficult to do with physical servers? c) What is VM instantiation? d) How does Netflix use the agility offered by Amazon Web Services?\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) Amazon is a cloud service provider (CSP). Figure 1-7 illustrates this concept. We saw earlier that the Internet and other networks are depicted as clouds. The figure shows that CSPs also operate their services opaquely, forming a second layer of cloud.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nComputing Cloud\n\nAmazon Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud Service Provider\n\nNetwork Cloud Corporate Data Center\n\nGoogle Mail Application Google Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Service Provider\n\nCustomer\n\nFigure 1-7 Cloud Service Providers, IaaS, and SaaS\n\nInfrastructure as a Service The AWS service that Netflix uses is referred to, generically, as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This ungainly name refers to the fact that AWS provides the computing infrastructure, which consists of server operation, database management systems, and so forth. Netflix creates and manages its own applications for user ordering, transcoding, personalized viewing suggestions, and other matters. By outsourcing server ­operation to AWS, Netflix can focus its efforts more fully on developing and extending its applications. In addition, although Netflix does not manage the servers in AWS, it tests its server/application setups constantly. Netflix has developed a family of programs called the simian army,10 which it uses to selectively turn off parts of the AWS system to test how well the system responds to outages. When a change is made in an application that runs on many virtual machines, Netflix tries it out on just a few at first, then migrates it to the rest in a smooth manner. Software as a Service Amazon is not the only CSP that Netflix uses. Another is Google. Netflix uses Google Mail for its internal communication. In contrast to just offering IaaS, Google offers application software as well. This is called Software as a Service (SaaS). Here, “software” refers to application software. SaaS actually has been popular for some time. For example, many companies use salesforce.com application software for salesforce management and customer relationship management. Product versus Service As a Service in IaaS and SaaS refers to pricing. Normally, a company buys servers as products. However, cloud services are sold like 10\n\nThis name reflects the fact that individual programs have names like Chaos Monkey and Chaos Gorilla.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nelectrical service. You pay for the amount of service you use, and you pay only when you use it. This allows customers to avoid the capital expense (CapEx) of purchasing servers. They also avoid the risk of buying too much capacity that would go unused. IaaS appears as an operating expense (OpEx), which can be managed so that money is spent only when it must be. SaaS, in turn, changes application programs from products to services. Test Your Understanding 7. a) What is a CSP? (Do not just spell out the acronym). b) Distinguish between IaaS CSPs and SaaS CSPs. c) Is AWS an IaaS or an SaaS for Netflix? d) Is Google an IaaS or an SaaS for Netflix? e) Who owns and manages the servers in IaaSs and SaaSs? f) Who owns and manages the applications in IaaSs and SaaSs? g) In AWS, what does Netflix manage and not manage?\n\nClients Move into the Cloud Figure 1-7 shows that companies traditionally operated their own servers and ­applications. IaaS allows them to outsource the computing infrastructure “into the cloud.” SaaS ­allows them to do the same with some applications. Although servers are critical, companies also need to support client hosts used by individual people to receive service. Figure 1-8 shows that client hosts are also using the cloud. Most users today have multiple devices. They typically may have a desktop or laptop PC plus a tablet or two and a smartphone. They would like a consistent experience, at least to the degree possible, across these client hosts. As the figure shows, there is a virtual client host in the cloud, complete with application software and a virtual hard drive. When the user turns on a laptop computer and logs into the virtual client, he or she has access to all of the virtual client’s application programs and data files. In addition, the virtual client remembers its configuration, so all of the user’s shortcuts and other customizations appear on the laptop application window. The user works on documents or other files and saves them. Saving sends them back to the cloud client’s virtual hard drive.\n\nPhysical Clients\n\nApplications and Data Data Sharing with Another Virtual Client\n\nVirtual Client with Applications and Data\n\nFigure 1-8 Client Computing in the Cloud\n\n11\n\n12\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nWhen the user moves to another device, he or she can continue working on the same documents with the same program, picking up exactly where he or she left off. Although screen sizes may differ and the user interface may change somewhat to suit the device, the user’s experience will be similar across devices. The fact that the hard drive is virtual also means that it can be shared in ways that laptop and desktop hard drives cannot. The user can designate certain folders or individual files sharable and grant specific people specific access rights to the data. This allows multiple users to work on word processing documents and other files collaboratively. This is revolutionizing the way that project teams create documents. Instead of buying application software, the user typically pays an annual fee. Again, there is a shift from application software products to application software s­ ervices. As new versions of the software appear, the software vendor usually updates to the newest version of the software without charging an additional fee. Test Your Understanding 8. a) When a cloud virtual client is used, describe what happens when a user moves from one physical client device to another. b) How does the use of virtual clients facilitate file sharing among customers of the system? c) What are the advantages of using cloud application programs as a service, compared to traditional application purchasing?\n\nRain Clouds: Security A central issue for every cloud customer is security. In cloud computing, companies are putting critical corporate data on computers owned by other organizations. In the case of Netflix, Amazon is actually a competitor in the streaming media market. If cloud service providers fail to protect data from hackers, the potential consequences are enormous. Today, cloud customers wonder if government agencies are demanding access to their data under gag orders that prevent customers from learning that this is happening. Edward Snowden’s exfiltration of information from NSA servers in 2013 illustrated how even single employees can get access to masses of critical sensitive data. To deal with security, companies must do extensive due diligence, looking in depth at how cloud service providers handle security. However, there is no way to understand everything about a cloud service provider’s security. For the time being, many organizations are crossing their fingers, whistling in the dark, knocking on wood, and yielding to the attraction of cloud computing’s low cost and agility. Test Your Understanding 9. What concerns do customers have about cloud security?\n\nNetworks and the Cloud Networks today must work extremely well, almost perfectly. They must do this while growing at unbelievable rates. They must do all this using standards that are older than most of today’s network engineers. We have been talking about the Internet. However, as we saw earlier, the Internet is not a single network. It is a jumble of single networks\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nand smaller internets ranging in size from a couple of devices in a dorm room to corporate internets for globe-spanning corporations. The demands of cloud computing are creating enormous stresses on networks. Cloud service providers themselves create massive and fast-changing network transmission loads. Customers of cloud services also find themselves with massive increases in Internet and local network traffic. In addition to growing rapidly, networks are also facing increasing demands for reliability because a company that loses contact with its cloud service providers for even brief periods of time will suffer heavy losses. Test Your Understanding 10. How is cloud computing impacting networking?\n\nService Level Agreements (SLAs): Speed To alleviate customer concerns about service quality, cloud service providers usually offer service level agreements (SLAs), which are guarantees that the CSP will meet specified service parameters or pay a penalty. (We will see in Chapter 4 that network providers in general offer SLAs.) The most basic parameter in SLA agreements is speed. The first question people ask about a newborn baby is whether it is a boy or a girl. The first question people ask about a network is whether it is fast enough to meet their requirements. Speed is normally measured in bits (1s or 0s) per second. This is abbreviated bps. Speeds are given with metric prefixes for the bps base unit. In increasing order of a thousand, these are kbps, Mbps, Gbps, and Tbps. If you are a little rusty on the metric system, see the box “Writing Speeds in Metric Notation.”11 How much speed do you need? Figure 1-9 looks at things from the individual point of view, showing how long it will take to download various types of information at various transmission speeds. Note that e-mail is instantaneous at any common speed today. Streaming video requires a very fast connection, and for disk backup, even gigabit speed may not be enough. Corporate networks, in turn, must carry the combined transmissions of all users and all machine-to-machine background processes. This creates an enormous aggregate need for speed. In Chapter 4, we will look at aggregating the speeds of different traffic. We will also look at SLA parameters beyond speed.

Suppose that you see the speed 45 Mbps. Here, 45 is the number and bps is the base unit (bits per second). The metric prefix in front of the base unit is a multiplication factor. So bps is straight bits per second, kbps is 1,000 bps, Mbps is 1,000,000 bps, and Gbps is 1,000,000,000 bps. The rare Tbps is 1,000,000,000,000 bps. Note that kilo is written with a lowercase k.12 Figure 1-10 shows this information graphically.\n\nRemoving Metric Prefixes Sometimes, you need to change the way a number is expressed. For instance, suppose that you want to express 33 kbps without a metric prefix. The k stands for a thousand, so 33 kbps is 33 times 1,000 bps—33,000 bps. In the second row of the figure, 3.4 Mbps is 3.4 times 1,000,000 bps—3,400,000 bps.\n\nAdding Metric Prefixes What if you need to go in the other direction—to add metric prefixes? In the first row, we have 43,700 bps. This is 43.7 kbps. How did we get this? We divided the original number by 1,000 and added the prefix k. So we have 43,700 / 1000 * 1000 * bps. We divided the number by a thousand and multiplied the metric prefix by 1000, leaving the value the same.

This is a measure of temperature.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud For 3,400,000 bps, we divide the number by a million and add the metric prefix mega (M). So 3,400,000 bps gives 3.4 Mbps. Note that you always multiply or divide by a factor of a thousand (1,000, 1,000,000, 1,000,000,000, etc.).\n\nWriting Numbers with Metric Prefixes Properly How many times should you divide the number by a thousand? The answer is that you do it until you get one to three digits before the decimal point. So 7.89 Mbps (1 place) is good. So are 23.426 kbps (2 places) and 178 Gbps (3 places). However, 4,300 kbps is not good (4 places). Neither is 0.45 bps (no places before the decimal point because leading zeroes do not count). What if you add a metric prefix to a number less than one? Then instead of dividing by a thousand, and increasing the metric prefix, you multiply by a thousand and decrease the metric prefix accordingly. If you have 0.045 Gbps, you multiply 0.045 by a thousand. This gives you 45. To compensate, you divide the metric prefix by 1,000, giving M. So you have 45 Mbps instead of 0.045 Gbps. There is one more rule in writing numbers in metric notation. You place a space between the number and the metric prefix but not between the metric prefix and the base unit. So 45 kbps is good, but 45kbps and 45k bps are not. Test Your Understanding 12. a) How would you write four thousand bits per second in metric notation? b) How would you write 45,250,000 bps in metric notation? c) How would you write 23.78 Mbps without a metric prefix? d) How would you write 0.047 Mbps without a metric prefix? 13. a) Write 45.6355 kbps properly. b) Write 37,400 Mbps properly. c) Write 0.032 Mbps properly. d) Write 37kbps properly. e) Write 89k bps properly.\n\nMessages We saw earlier that application programs on hosts communicate by sending messages back and forth. Now we will look at important types of messages in networking.\n\nApplication Messages The World Wide Web uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard to ­standardize message exchange between browsers and webserver programs. Figure 1-11 shows that an HTTP request message asks for a file. The subsequent HTTP response ­message delivers the file or an error message. This exchange is called an HTTP request/ response cycle. Browsers and webserver programs are application programs, so the messages they exchange are application messages.\n\nMessage Fragmentation, Frames, and Packets As Figure 1-12 shows, application message can be very large. For example, a movie transfer requires the transmission of about six gigabytes of data, and even high-quality photographs take a few megabytes. Forwarding long application messages through a network would be like sending a fleet of 18-wheeler trucks through a narrow English village.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nBrowser (Client Application)\n\nClient Host\n\nHTTP Request/Response Cycle\n\nHTTP Request Message\n\nWebserver Program (Server Application)\n\nServer Host HTTP Response Message\n\nFigure 1-11 Application Request-Response Cycle in HTTP\n\nFragmentation In addition to application software, hosts also have network software, which handles network transmission for the operating system. As Figure 1-12 illustrates, network software does three things with application messages.\n\n• First, if the application message is large, the network software fragments the long application message into many smaller message segments. • Second, the network software places each segment in an electronic envelope. This “envelope” is merely a set of added bits in front of the segment (the header) and perhaps another set of added bits after the segment (the trailer). These bits contain delivery information for the segment in the envelope. Importantly, the envelope contains the address of the receiving host. The network uses this information to deliver the envelope to the destination host. • Third, the network software on the source host transmits each segment plus envelope over the network. The envelope and its contents are called either a frame or a packet depending on the circumstances. Later in this chapter, we will see when to use the term frame and when to use the term packet.\n\nApplication Program\n\nLong Application Message\n\nFragmentation\n\nApplication Message Segments\n\nNetwork Software\n\nNetwork Interface Hardware\n\nFrame or Packet (Segment Plus Header)\n\nNetwork\n\nFigure 1-12 Fragmentation, Frames, and Packets\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Application message segments are carried inside frames or packets that have delivery information.\n\nOn the destination host, the network software receives all the frames or ­packets delivering the application message. It removes the segments, puts them in order, and reassembles the application message. The network software passes this application message up to the application program. Note that neither application program knows that fragmentation has been done. The source application simply passes the whole ­application message down to the network software. The destination application ­receives the whole message from its network software. Error Correction Why do fragmentation? One reason is error correction. Suppose there is a transmission error somewhere within the network and a few bits are lost, damaging the message. The incorrect message must be retransmitted. Figure 1-13 shows retransmission with and without fragmentation. Without fragmentation, the sender must retransmit the entire message. This adds quite a bit to the network’s traffic load. In addition, if a message is long, a transmission error has a high probability of occurring each time it is sent. The message may have to be resent multiple times before it arrives correctly. Transferring a moderate-size file from home to school over a cranky telephone line and without fragmentation once took the first author three hours. With fragmentation, the sender only needs to retransmit the single damaged frame or packet. An error will therefore increase the transfer time only slightly. The bottom line is that fragmentation increases an application message’s effective speed. Multiplexing Figure 1-14 shows a second reason for fragmentation. Consider this analogy. Would it be nice to drive into school or work in your own personal highway lane? There would be no traffic congestion at all. That would certainly be nice, but having thousands of traffic lanes on a freeway would entail astronomical construction costs. In the real world, we have to drive on shared highways that carry many cars in each lane. The individual cars and trucks “share” the cost of the highway lane. In networking, packets share the cost of multiplexed (shared) transmission lines. In the figure, two client PCs are sending messages to different servers. Their\n\nNo Fragmentation\n\nX\n\nError!

Multiplexing reduces transmission costs. It is technically possible to multiplex using large application messages. However, filling a line efficiently with large messages is impossible. To see why, consider another analogy. Hourglasses work far better with sand than with rocks. Small frames and packets can fill a transmission line very efficiently.

We will begin with the most basic unit of networking, the single network. Single networks are networks that have three defining characteristics. If you do not understand these characteristics immediately, things should be clear after some examples. • A single network uses a single technology for transmission. All devices must comply with that technology’s standards. • There is a controlled address space such that each host address is unique, like a telephone number. • Messages in single networks are called frames, not packets. Test Your Understanding 15. What are the three defining characteristics of single networks?\n\nSingle-Network Host Addresses In single networks, the most widely used type of host address is the EUI-48 address. As its name suggests, this address is 48 bits long. The EUI part stands for extended unique identifier. (All addresses are unique identifiers, so this makes sense.) The extended part? Uh, just ignore it.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Different single-network standards use different types of addresses A common type of single-network address is the EUI-48 address EUI stands for extended unique identifier It is 48 bits long Used in Ethernet 802.3, Wi-Fi 802.11, and Bluetooth However, not all single-network addresses are EUI-48 addresses Formerly called a media access control (MAC) address Still commonly referred to as MAC addresses Written as six pairs of number or letter symbols separated by dashes Example A1-B2-CC-92-FF-00 Figure 1-15 EUI-48 Addresses [Study Figure]\n\nIf you have some networking background, you might be asking, “Hey, isn’t that a Media Access Control (MAC) address?” Actually, it is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE’s) new name for MAC addresses. You need to know that they mean the same thing because the term “MAC address” is still widely used. However, the IEEE has deprecated the MAC name in favor of EUI-48. EUI-48 address is the new name for Media Access Control (MAC) address.\n\nAn EUI-48 address is written as six pairs of number or letter symbols separated by dashes. For example, an EUI-48 address might be A1-B2-CC-92-FF-00. In Chapter 5, we will look at EUI-48 addresses in detail. EUI-48 addresses are very common because they are used in 802.3 Ethernet wired networks, 802.11 Wi-Fi wireless networks, and Bluetooth. However, they are not the only kind of single-network address. Do not confuse their common use with universality. EUI-48 (MAC) addresses are very common because they are used in 802.3 Ethernet wired networks, 802.11 wireless networks, and Bluetooth. However, they are not the only kind of single-network address. Do not confuse their common use with universality.\n\nTest Your Understanding 16. a) What is the most widely used single-network address? b) What else is it called? c) Why is the following NOT an EUI-48 address: A9-00-FF-93-BD? d) Are all ­single-network addresses EUI-48 addresses?\n\nPoint-to-Point Single Networks, Physical Links, and Data links We will now look at types of single-network technologies. Figure 1-16 shows the simplest single network technology—a point-to-point connection between two hosts. That’s a network? It’s like two cans connected by a string! Yes, a point-to-point network is not very complex, but we will see later in this chapter that it is important when we move beyond single networks to internets.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Data Link Layer (DLL) Link (Frame organization) Point-to-Point Prococol (PPP) is a common standard\n\nFrame\n\nPoint-to-Point Network\n\nPhysical Layer Link (Transmission media, connectors, signals, etc.)\n\nFigure 1-16 Point-to-Point Single Network\n\nPhysical Layer Although this is an almost trivial network, it allows us to introduce the concept of physical layer and data link layer standards. Physical layer standards govern transmission media such as wires, connectors, and signaling (how 1s and 0s are represented as physical signals such as voltage changes or radio waves). Both hosts must connect to the network using the proper plug and send signals in appropriate ways. Physical layer standards govern transmission media such as wires, connectors, and signaling (how 1s and 0s are represented as physical signals such as voltage changes or radio waves).\n\nData Link Layer A point-to-point network also allows us to introduce the concept of data link layer (DLL) standards. Data link layer standards determine how frames are organized. Although they are not present in a point-to-point network, networks often have forwarding devices to deliver frames in a series of hops. How these devices, including switches and access points, forward frames in a single network is also governed by DLL standards. DLL standards also govern addresses. For point-to-point networks, the most common data link layer standard is the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). The PPP standard governs how the frame is organized. Data link layer standards determine how frames are organized, addresses, and other things we will see later.\n\nLayers We have seen the physical and data link layers briefly. We will soon see other standards layers. Layering is an important concept in network standards. In transportation, the soil layer supports the road layer. Moving up through layers, the road supports the tires, the tires support the car, the car supports the driver, and the driver supports the company he or she is working for in commercial operations. Layering allows specialization. In transportation, someone who is an expert on road construction does not have to know much about car design. In networking, someone who knows electrical signaling does not have to know much about applications—or vice versa.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Layered Standards Often, standards are created in layers, with each layer supporting the next higher layer For example, in driving The soil layer supports the road layer The road layer supports the tire layer The tire layer supports the body layer The body layer supports the driver layer Layering allows specialization Road engineers do not have to understand tire standards or body standards in detail Physical Layer Standards The physical connection between adjacent devices in a network is a physical link Govern transmission media and connectors Govern signaling to transmit ones and zeroes Layer 1 (L1) standards Data Link Layer (DLL) Standards The end-to-end path of a frame between the source and destination host is a data link Govern frame organization Govern how forwarding devices (access points, switches) forward frames over multiple hops Govern DLL addresses Layer 2 (L2) standards Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) The dominant data link layer standard for point-to-point networks\n\nFigure 1-17 Physical and Data Link Layer Standards (Study Figure)\n\nLayering allows specialization.\n\nLayers 1 and 2 (L1 and L2) Networking professionals often refer to network layers by number. The physical layer is the lowest layer, and it is numbered Layer 1 or L1. The data link layer is the next-lowest layer, and it is numbered Layer 2 or L2. All single-network technologies require standards at both Layer 1 and Layer 2. This means that they all must standardize physical link technology and data link layer matters such as DLL addresses and DLL frame organizations.\n\nTest Your Understanding 17. a) In what type of single-network technology is the Point-to-Point (PPP) protocol used? b) What do physical layer standards govern? c) What do data link layer (DLL) standards govern? d) At what layer do you find EUI-addresses? (The answer is not directly in the text. It requires you to integrate the information you have learned.) e) At what layer are frames defined?\n\n21\n\n22\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\n18. a) Why is layering important for creating standards? b) What is the name and number of the lowest network standards layer? c) What is the name and number of the second-lowest network standards layer? d) Which layer’s standards govern single-network technologies? e) At which layer or layers is PPP a standard?\n\nWireless Single Networks Wireless transmission is becoming the most common way to access the Internet, a home network, or a corporate network. Figure 1-18 illustrates an 802.11 wireless network. 802.11 is the collective name for the standards that govern wireless local area networks. These are also called Wi-Fi networks. In 802.11 networks, the source and destination hosts normally do not communicate directly. In the figure, the wireless source host is transmitting a frame to a wireless access point. The wireless access point will relay the frame to the destination host. The wireless access point, in other words, forwards frames between wireless hosts. As we just saw, physical layer standards govern a single physical connection. In Figure 1-16, which illustrated a point-to-point network, there was a single physical link. For the simple wireless network in Figure 1-18, there are two physical links. In turn, we saw that data link layer standards govern frame organization and other things necessary for end-to-end connections between the source and destination hosts in a single network. In Figure 1-18, there is a single data link. There is always a single data link between the source and destination host in a single network, regardless of how many physical links are involved. There is always a single data link in a single network, regardless of how many physical links the frame passes through.\n\nTest Your Understanding 19. a) In 802.11 Wi-Fi networks, what device relays frames between the source and destination hosts? b) What two things do 802.11 data link layer standards govern? c) Is there always a single data link for a frame in a single network?\n\n802.11 Wi-Fi Wireless Client Host\n\nWireless Physical Link\n\ne\n\nm Fra\n\nWireless Data Link\n\nFigure 1-18 802.11 Wireless Single Network\n\n802.11 Wi-Fi Wireless Access Point Wireless Physical Link\n\n802.11 Wi-Fi Wireless Server Host\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nSwitched Single Networks Figure 1-19 finally takes us into a larger single network, a switched network. In a switched single network, the frame is forwarded over a number of transmission links connected by forwarding devices called switches. There may be many switches between the source host and the destination host. In the figure, the frame passes through four switches along its data link. Physical Links The hosts and switches are connected by physical links. Typically, these physical links use copper wire or optical fiber (which carries signals as light pulses propagating through thin glass tubes). There are five physical links along the path the frame takes through the network. There often are many physical links along the path the frame travels. Data Links Again, the path that the frame takes all the way through the switched network is the frame’s data link. There is always a single data link for a frame traveling through a single network.\n\nSwitch Operation When the Source Host X transmits a frame, the frame goes to Switch A. That switch must decide whether to switch (forward) the frame to Switch B or Switch C. This is a switching decision. If Switch A forwards the frame to Switch B, Switch B must decide whether to switch the frame to Switch D or Switch E. This switch-by-switch decision making will continue until the final switch along the path forwards the frame to the destination host. How does Switch A know whether to forward the arriving frame to Switch B or Switch C? The answer, shown in Figure 1-20, is that Switch A has a switching table with two columns. The first is the destination address in the frame. The second is the switch or host that Switch A should send the frame to next. Source Host X\n\nPhysical Links connect adjacent devices.

The table indicates that the switch should forward the frame to Switch B. Switch A does so. Note that Switch A only has local knowledge about what to do with incoming frames. It receives the frame from one physical link and transmits it over another physical link. It does not know the frame’s entire path through the network. If Switch A passes the frame to Switch B, Switch B will also only have local knowledge. In fact, all switches along the way from the source host to the destination host only know what to do with the next frame. A switch does not know the frame’s entire path through the network.\n\nTest Your Understanding 20. a) What decision do switches have to make when a frame arrives? b) What is this decision called? c) How do they make this decision? d) Does an individual switch know the frame’s entire path through a switched single network? e) Are frames addressed to the DLL addresses of a switch or the DLL addresses of a destination host? (The answer is not in the text.)\n\nHybrid Switched/Wireless Single Networks Single networks require all devices to use the same technology and therefore the same standards. Like many things in networks, however, there are a few exceptions. Figure 1-21 shows the most common exception, a hybrid switched/wireless network.\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nCommunication Ethernet Switch\n\nWire\n\nServer Needed by Client\n\nWire Wire\n\nAccess Point\n\nRouter for Internet Access\n\nRadio Transmission\n\nWireless Client\n\nThe Internet\n\nLarge Ethernet LAN\n\nFigure 1-21 Hybrid Switched/Wireless Single Network\n\nIn the figure, there is a full switched Ethernet network. (Ethernet is the dominant switching technology for local area networks.) Although the figure does not show it, many hosts connect directly to a switch. In addition, some hosts connect wirelessly to 802.11 (Wi-Fi) access points. These access points connect wireless hosts to the switched networks. Why connect wireless hosts to wired networks? When bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he allegedly said, “Because that’s where the money is.” In hybrid networks, wireless clients need to connect to the wired network because that is where the resources they need are. The servers they need are on the wired network. So are the routers (which we will discuss later) that connect the single network to the Internet. When counting physical links, the wireless connection between the wireless ­client and the access point counts as one physical link. The wired connection between the ­access point and the Ethernet switch is another physical link. Test Your Understanding 21. a) Can you have a mixed wired and wireless network? b) In a hybrid single switched network, why do wireless clients need to connect to the wired network? c) What role do access points have in hybrid switched/wireless networks?\n\nInternet Transmission Hosts on Different Single Networks What if hosts on different single networks wish to communicate? There are three problems that must be overcome to make this possible. • First, the single networks may have different standards. Each has its own frame organization. They would not be able to make sense of each other’s frames.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Different Standards The single networks may have different standards If so, they cannot understand each other’s frames Overlapping Addresses Even if the two networks follow the same standard, a host on one network may have the same DLL address as a host on the other network. To which host with the same number should the combined network deliver it? Link to Connect the Single Network How would you link the two networks together? If the link used the standards of one network, it would not connect to the other network for the first two reasons Figure 1-22 Problems Connecting Hosts on Different Single Networks (Study Figure)\n\n• Second, even if the two networks follow the same standard, this does not mean that they can interoperate. Most fundamentally, a host on one network may have the same DLL address as a host on the other network. For example, both networks may number their hosts 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. In a combined network, there would be many hosts with the same number. If a message is sent to an address, to which host should the combined network deliver it? • Third, how would you link the two networks together? If the link used the standards of one network, it would not connect to the other network for the first two reasons. Test Your Understanding 22. If two hosts are on two different single networks, what three problems must be overcome if they are to be able to communicate?\n\nCreating the Internet The problem of connecting hosts on different single networks was not an academic ­exercise for Bon Kahn at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the late 1960s. He was funding several research projects on several different research networks. One was the switch-based ARPANET, which was the precursor to today’s Internet. Two others were a short-distance radio network and a satellite data network. He needed researchers on these and other research network to be able to share resources. Kahn also realized that he was not the only person to face this problem. Kahn worked with Vint Cerf at UCLA and later Stanford to solve the problem. The solution they came up with was remarkably simple, at least in principle. Routers Figure 1-23 illustrates part of their solution. It shows that they introduced a new device that they called a gateway. Today, we call this device a router. Routers do the work of connecting networks together. Of course, single networks have no idea what a router is. They only know how to deliver frames to hosts. Routers circumvent this problem by pretending to be hosts. In the figure, Host A on Network 1 wishes to send an application message to Host B on\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nThe router acts as the destination host on Network 1 and the source host on Network 2\n\nHost A\n\nHost B Frame 1 Single Network 1\n\nFrame 2 Router\n\nSingle Network 2\n\nFigure 1-23 Internetworking with a Router\n\nNetwork 2. On Network 1, the router acts as a destination host, accepting a frame from Host A. The router then creates a new frame acceptable on Network 2. Acting like a host on Network 2, the router sends this frame to Host B. On the two single networks, operation is completely normal. IP Addresses As just noted, data link layer addresses are not necessarily unique across different single networks. The way Kahn and Cerf addressed this problem was to create an entirely new type of address, the Internet Protocol address or IP address, which we saw earlier. Like telephone numbers, IP addresses are given out in a way that guarantees that all host IP addresses would be unique. We will see how this is done in Chapter 8. IP Packets Kahn and Cerf also created a new type of message. Unlike frames, which can only travel in single networks, IP packets travel all the way from the source host to the destination host. An IP packet delivers an application segment from the source host to the destination host. There is no need to change the way single networks handle frames. In Figure 1-24, the IP packet “pretends” to be an application segment, and the frame simply carries the packet instead of the actual application segment. How can the packet pretend that it is an application message segment? The ­answer is that the hosts and routers act as accomplices. Single networks do not create frames. They merely deliver them. Nor do they look inside frames at the messages these frames carry. Hosts and routers, however, have software that does know about IP packets and how to use them. Host 1.2.3.4 creates an IP packet for Host 5.6.7.8. It places this packet in Frame 1 and sends the frame to the interface (port) of the router on Single Network 1. The router also has an interface that connects it to Single Network 2. The router removes the packet from Frame 1, places the packet in Frame 2, which is suitable for Single Network 2, and sends the frame out that interfaces to Host 5.6.7.8. Host 5.6.7.8 removes the packet from the frame. The packet has now finished its journey from Host 1.2.3.4 to Host 5.6.7.8. The switches and other devices on the single ­network along the way do not know that they were duped, and the hosts and routers do not gloat about their complicity in Cerf and Kahn’s stratagem. It just works for everybody.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud The packet is addressed to the destination host’s IP address. The packet travels all the way to the destination host.

Figure 1-25 shows encapsulation in internets. Traditionally, a frame in a single network carried an application message segment. In internets, an IP packet is encapsulated in a frame. The IP packet, in turn, encapsulates an application message segment. So a frame in an internet consists of a frame header, followed by an IP packet header, followed by an application message segment. (There may also be a frame trailer if the standard at the DLL has a trailer.) Today, hosts assume that they are on an internet. Consequently, all frames now consist of a frame header, an IP packet header, and an application message segment. On a single network, there is no router, of course. The destination host’s network program understands that and acts appropriately.\n\nTraditional Frame Application Message Segment\n\nFrame Header\n\nFrame on an Internet Application Message Segment\n\nIP Packet\n\nFigure 1-25 Encapsulation of Network Messages\n\nIP Packet Header\n\nFrame Header\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nTest Your Understanding 23. a) What device connects different single networks together into an internet? b) Do single networks know that they are delivering frames to a router? c) To what type of device do single networks think they are delivering frames? d) What devices understand what is really happening? 24. Why was a new type of address needed for the Internet? 25. a) On the Internet, what new type of message travels between the source and destination host? b) How are these messages carried in single networks? c) Describe what happens to a packet between the source and destination host. d) Draw a frame in terms of encapsulation (what message is inside what other message).\n\nRoutes and Layer 3 Routes We saw that at Layer 1, devices are connected by physical links. At Layer 2, the path a frame travels through a single network is a data link. We need a name for the path a packet takes from the source host to the destination host across an internet. The name for this is the packet’s route. Figure 1-26 shows a packet that travels across three single networks from Host A to Host B. The path a frame takes through each network is called its data link. A route is the path that a packet takes from the source host to the destination host across an internet.\n\nNote that there is always a single route for a packet through an internet and that the number of data links is the number of single networks separating the source and destination host (in this case, three). The number of physical links is entirely dependent on the single network technologies, sizes, and other factors. Note that there is always a single route for a packet through an internet and that the number of data links is the number of single networks separating the source and destination host.\n\nNote also that Network Y is a point-to-point network. It probably follows the PPP standard. Linking routers is the main use of point-to-point networks today, so PPP ­really is an important protocol in networking. Layer 3 and the Internet Protocol Effectively, Kahn and Cerf added a third layer of networking, Layer 3. L3 is the internet layer. Note that we write internet in lower case when referring to the layer. The main standard at the internet layer is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP governs the transmission of packets by routers across an internet between the source and destination hosts. It specifically governs IP addresses, packet syntax, router operation, and internets themselves. Although adding another layer with a­ ddresses, paths and forwarding devices works, it creates two layers of addresses, messages, and forwarding devices. Figure 1-27 compares the two layers across these dimensions.\n\n29\n\n30\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud Switched Network X Frame X Packet Switch X3 Data Link A-R1\n\nHost A Physical Link (A-X1)\n\nHost C\n\nSwitch X4\n\nSwitch X1\n\nSwitched Network Y Router R1\n\nSwitch X2 Data Link R1-R2 Packet\n\nRoute A-B\n\nFrame Y Switched Network Z Switch Z1 Router R2 Host B\n\nPacket Frame Z\n\nSwitch Z2\n\nData Link R2-B\n\nSwitch Z3\n\nHost E\n\nSwitch Z4\n\nHost D\n\nRouter R3\n\nFigure 1-26 Physical Links, Data Links, and a Route\n\nTest Your Understanding 26. a) What is a route? b) Distinguish between a data link and a route. c) When a packet travels through an internet, are there usually more data links or routes along the way? d) How many routes are there when a packet is transmitted? e) When a packet is transmitted from a source host to a destination host separated by four single networks, how many packets will there be?

However, from the discussion we have just seen, packets are never switched. Rather, frames are switched in single networks and packets are routed in internets. Networking terminology needs a consistency police. “Packet switching” is a generic name for fragmentation and envelopes However, the term “packet switching” is never used on single networks or internets In switched networks, frames are switched In internets, packets are routed Figure 1-28 “Packet Switching” (Study Figure)\n\nTest Your Understanding 30. Both single switched networks and routed networks are said to use packet switching. Why is this term confusing?\n\n31\n\n32\n\nChapter 1 • Welcome to the Cloud\n\nStandards Layers Companies do not want to limit themselves by buying all of their hardware and software from a single vendor. They want to pit vendors against each other so that v ­ endors have to compete for their dollars. Competition brings lower prices. It encourages ­vendors to keep adding new features to prevent their products from degenerating into commodities. From a risk viewpoint, standards mean that if your vendor goes out of business, your company is not SOL (strictly out of luck). Competition requires hardware and software from different vendors to be able to interoperate (work together effectively). This requires standards. Standards are detailed rules of operation that specify how two hardware or software processes work together. Standards govern such things as connectors, wiring, wireless operation, switching, routing, frames, packets, and application program messages. We will not look at standards much in this chapter. This is not because they are unimportant. It is because standards are so important that they require an entire chapter (Chapter 2). However, it is important to understand one general concept about standards at this point, namely layers. Standards are detailed rules of operation that specify how two hardware or software processes work together.\n\nFive Layers As discussed earlier, network standards are created in layers. Each layer supports the layer above it. Figure 1-29 shows that there are five general standards layers.\n\nLayers 1 through 3 (Physical, Data Link, and Internet Layers) We saw that physical links connect adjacent devices, data links are paths that frames take through single networks, and routes are paths that packets take through an\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nRole\n\n5\n\nApplication\n\nStandardizing communication between two application ­ rograms of a certain type. p\n\n4\n\nTransport\n\nFragmentation and other functions.\n\n3\n\nInternet\n\nTransmit a packet across an internet.
