The course is aimed at first year graduate and senior undergraduate students and covers a broad survey of networking issues. We focus on all seven layers of the OSI reference model and assign four major programming projects to reinforce the ideas covered in lectures. Projects include writing the client side of a client-server program that implements a sliding window data-link layer protocol complete with acknowledgements and retransmissions, writing client and server programs that interact via remote procedure calls, and writing client and server programs that use UDP datgrams to locate and register services with a name server utility and TCP to actually invoke services registered with the name server.\n\nDownload\n\nProceedings of the 2003 InSITE Conference, 2003\n\nThis article proposes a pedagogical framework for teaching an introductory data communications and networking (DCN) course to Management Information Systems (MIS) undergraduate majors within a school of business. Building on the material provided in commonly used DCN undergraduate textbooks, the course introduces students to both theoretical and applied knowledge necessary to solve business and DCN technology problems. Since it is taught in a business school, the course encompasses studentsâ€™ previous business course work, and has a strong business case orientation. All MIS majors at the senior level are required to take it.\n\nDownload\n\nThis paper discusses a non-traditional course in computer networking. The course is a laboratory course with substantial hands-on experiences, which can help to prepare students for jobs in industry as soon as they graduate from an undergraduate institution. This course is not meant to replace the traditional network course but to supplement it by teaching how computer networks work in practice and by exploring new topics such as internetworking, high speed networking, client/server computing and security.\n\nDownload"
