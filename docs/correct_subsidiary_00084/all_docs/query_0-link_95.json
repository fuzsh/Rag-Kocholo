Or is it? Om Malik finds that a serial successful businessman in the networking space has his sights set up on the 56 GHz band in which he hopes to offer 2 Gbps on a wireless LAN with full security across each layer. When you're developing new protocols, you can think about layer-based encryption or embedding encryption into the stack.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:59 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Future\n\nThe Path to 802.11i\n\nOr, how do we get from here to there? A colleague wrote in to ask several questions about the path from WEP through WPA to 802.11i, the final IEEE security standard that's expected next year. I answered his questions in email, but I thought they were a good foundation for discussion.\n\nCurrently, all 802.11a, b, and g devices support WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption which has had flaws and exploits well documented. The ultimate goal is 802.11i, a robust set of security improvements. On the road to 802.11i, the Wi-Fi Alliance has required WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), which fixes all of WEP's problems, is a subset of 802.11i, and which allows full backwards compatibility for most 802.11a and b devices made before 2003.\n\nMy colleague asked what would become of the current generation of 802.11 devices when 802.11i appeared? Because of WPA, I expect from promises made by manufacturers that virtually all client adapters and many (but not all) access points will have firmware upgrades that allow them to support the full WPA subset.\n\nEquipment released in 2003, and some in 2002, already has the silicon in place to support full 802.11i, which has a more complex option for encryption (AES or Advanced Encryption System, in a couple of flavors), and a few more requirements. Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Intersil, Atheros, and others can merely push out firmware upgrades to enable AES and other features to their partners who will then push them out to customers.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:53 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Security\n\nKuwait's Airport Goes Wireless\n\nKuwait's main airport will have Wi-Fi access: The article doesn't note a timetable or cost, but about 4 million passengers a year wend their way across 35 international airlines.

T-Mobile has partnered with Metronet on roaming since 2002. Metronet is the fourth-largest European WISP, according to their press release. \"This deal is therefore bringing us a large step closer to the international objective of providing W-LAN around the entire globe,\" explains Dr. Georg Pölzl, Managing Director of T-Mobile Austria.\n\nT-Mobile Austria charges €7.95 per hour, €15.95 for three hours, or €24.95 for 24 hours. This is enormously higher than the same rates charged by T-Mobile USA. T-Mobile customers can pay via SMS at €1.99 per 15-minute unit, but the service is currently free to subscribers.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:15 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Cellular, Hot Spot, International\n\nKansas City Gets AirPort Wi-Fi\n\nSprint PCS to pay for, roll out airport Wi-Fi in Kansas City: As with many other airport situations, the company with the largest deal wins the contract, even though I believe that's not in the airport's best interest as a general policy. Sprint PCS will pay for the equipment, but the airport will eventually own it. The cost per day: $9.95. Sprint PCS hasn't announced unlimited monthly usage plans yet; they have said they will resell access to their network to others. The expense to build out the airport's Wi-Fi wasn't released.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:07 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Air Travel, Cellular, Hot Spot\n\nWi-Fi's Openings Lead to Arrests, Legal Worries\n\nNews.com's Richard Shim pulls together several related threads about the risks and liabilities of Wi-Fi networks in light of recent arrests: While there's not a simple connection between you leaving a Wi-Fi access point open and someone committing a crime across it, the recent child pornography and brain-dead IT department network exploitation arrests are causing a lot more discussion.\n\nBecause Wi-Fi networks aren't straightforward to secure now, the risk of lawsuits is low. This doesn't address purposely open APs in community networks or free networks either, or legitimate users who have paid to use commercial networks who then commit criminal acts!\n\nInterestingly, Lowe's customers weren't hurt by the fact that three men apparently were able to gain easy access to their Wi-Fi networks in several places and insert a credit-card-collecting crack into the system. Because Lowe's has a corporate IT operation, I would imagine Lowe's would have been liable for negligence if customer information had been misused. They should have known better.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:04 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Security\n\nT-Mobile Prices in Czech\n\nCorrespondent Patrick Zandl writes with T-Mobile's pricing from the Czech Republic: The Czech T-Mobile locations will start charing in January, Zandl says. Pricing is well above the competition. Zandl notes that T-Mobile CZ charges 150 CZK (Czech crowns) or $5.50 US per hour, while Eurotel and WideNet charge a litlte over US$2.00. T-Mobile charges $6.00 per hour with a one-hour minimum in its US locations.\n\nT-Mobile CZ cell users can pay as part of their cell phone bill, in which case they can charge in 15-minute intervals.

They might also deploy a low-power cellular transmitter that would use the satellite link for backhaul.\n\nThe first-generation AP on planes, by the way, is 802.11b only -- probably due to regulatory certification issues. The next-generation system will be a/b/g.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 10:52 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Air Travel\n\nFred-eZone in Canada\n\nThe capital of New Brunswick, Canada, launches Wi-Fi project (follow link and download PDF press release): The Fred-eZone (short for Fredericton) project offers free Wi-Fi throughout public spaces with the first phase costing Cdn$150,000. Right now, this includes downtown and the airport, but the project will eventually span all business corridors and public places. Interestingly, the project stems in part from an earlier effort to deploy municipal fiber, which gave the city the easy access to bandwidth that made the Wi-Fi rollout possible.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 10:49 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hot Spot, Municipal\n\nWhat is the Sound of One Ear Listening?\n\nPaul Gilster writes about the problem of audiences at events with Wi-Fi access: The not-so-silent clacking of keys provides a sensory backdrop much like a white-noise generator. You speak, and a constant barrage of tippity tap tap clack clickety clack echoes in the background. It's not symmetrical: at times, people listen and the typing stops. Other times, one lone typer hammers away--is he or she blogging what you're saying or playing Doom? The sounds rises and falls randomly in different parts of the room.\n\nInterestingly, he talks about the second level of communication being a basement meeting, but I think he hasn't seen an O'Reilly conference in action. At Emerging Technology in April, there were always several simultaneous channels: it was more like instant analysis and commentary of a live event. People would blog and post; using IM, including IRC channels; use SubEthaEdit (ne Hydra) for Mac OS X Rendezvous collaborative note taking; use some of the unique services for discussion or note posting.

Had to be seen to be understood fully. The company graciously loaned me a unit to run through its paces.\n\nThe ZyAIR’s goal is obviously to be as multi-talented as possible. It allows you to create several network names (extended service set IDs or ESSIDs) to which you can assign different virtual LAN (VLAN) tags to restrict network traffic. Each VLAN can have its own set of WEP keys, but you can’t set firewall or IP routing parameters.\n\nIt can also handle up to 32 user accounts manually entered and perform 802.1X/EAP (Encapsulated Authentication Protocol) negotiation directly for those accounts. The B-3000 can also pass-through EAP messages to back-end RADIUS servers for more robust user authentication.\n\nConfiguring the B-3000 is extremely simple and straightforward. They’ve designed the interface well, and the manual, while a little scanty, has practically all of the necessary detail. I had to spend just a little time playing trial and error.\n\nBecause the unit can be set to only allow access via authentication and because it can support user accounts directly, it seems like an ideal secure small office access point and gateway.\n\nBut it does have a few provisos. First, the only 802.1X/EAP type supported is EAP-MD5 which, although it secures the password, is not considered robust enough for an enterprise solution because of the potential of various attacks that could allow others to gain access to the network.\n\nWorse, Windows XP's original release supported EAP-MD5, but alert reader Eddie Rowe wrote in to note that service pack 1 (SP1) disables EAP-MD5 over 802.1X. A technical note I found from a third party cites the failure to secure the transmission of hashed passwords in EAP-MD5 over 802.1X as the reason for it not being allowed. So using EAP-MD5 is actually a higher bar for Windows XP users than PEAP (Protected EAP)! They would require third-party client software. (Mac OS X 10.3 includes EAP-MD5 as a valid 802.1X type.)\n\nThe company said that it was looking into supporting PEAP inside the B-3000, but hadn’t made a decision about this yet because of engineering issues. They said that EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS aren’t feasible in a stand-alone device.\n\nSecond, the B-3000 only supports WEP encryption at the moment, and its dynamic WEP key exchange only works with a RADIUS server, not its internal authentication database. A company spokesperson said that WPA should be available by the end of the year.\n\nThird, only 32 users can access the B-3000 at a time, with or without user accounts. This could be a limitation for offices that would otherwise be good candidates.\n\nFor a suggested retail price of $150, the B-3000 should have enough admirable features to make it an easy choice for a small network trying to dramatically improve its security without reaching government-grade levels, deterring all but the most determined crackers.\n\nUnfortunately, the built-in support for just EAP-MD5 and the lack of current WPA support mean that the B-3000 can't live up to its potential as a stand-alone device. Without the firewall features to make the unique SSID/VLAN feature useful and without PEAP support to handle up-to-date Windows XP users, the B-3000 is just an expensive also-ran that handles pass-through AAA; a Linksys WRT54G would cost less and offers greater security and compatibility right now.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 9:38 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hardware\n\nOn the Road with Wi-Fi\n\nTruckstop.net, which recently signed a deal with Sprint to build hotspots in truck stops, signed a deal with Pilot Travel Centers. Pilot operates rest stops in 37 states and claims to be the largest \"travel plaza network\" in the country. Pilot's rest stops will get Wi-Fi aimed at truckers and other folks on the road.\n\nThe press release isn’t up yet but should be available here eventually.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 9:33 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Deals | 1 TrackBack\n\nEurope Expected to Beat U.S.\n\nInsight research expects service revenues from Wi-Fi to grow faster in Europe than in the U.S. : The research firm expects revenues worldwide to grow from $7 billion this year to over $44 billion by 2008. That figure for revenues this year sounds really high to me, given that in this country at least other recent research revealed that only 1 percent of Internet users had paid to use Wi-Fi.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 9:31 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Research\n\nVerizon Slims Payphone Rollout\n\nVerizon drops payphone Wi-Fi count down to 500 from 1000: Verizon had originally said they'd roll out Wi-Fi service for their DSL customers at 1000 payphones across Manhattan. Now they're saying that 500 should be enough.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 1:36 PM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hot Spot | 1 TrackBack\n\nWireless KVM\n\nIf you don't know what KVM stands for, you don't need it: A keyboard/video/mouse switcher allows an IT staffer to run a bunch of servers as quasi-headless computers in which a single mouse, keyboard, and monitor are shared via a switch. It's a big business, because especially in the Windows world, there are a lot of functions that are most easily carried out when directly connected to a computer instead of adding complication with terminal servers and other virtual remote controllers.\n\nThis wireless KVM controller is a single-PC device, however, for $995. It uses 802.11a and secures the connection with AES. It supports 24-bit color at a 30-frame-per-second refresh. This seems like an awfully high price except for specialized applications, and I expect we'll see switchers instead of one-to-one controllers in the near future.\n\n802.11a is, as we know, a better choice for media because of the uncrowded 5 GHz band.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:03 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Enterprise\n\nSBC's Wi-Fi Slips Out from Under the Brim\n\nAn alert reader noted that SBC hasn't formally announced its Wi-Fi service, but has this page up with prices: FreedomLink is the name of SBC's Wi-Fi service, and they've scaled back a bit from the numbers of hotspots they expect: 2,000 by the end of 2004, but they're including the 600+ locations run by Wayport, which is the primary (but not sole) contractor for building new hotspots for SBC.\n\nSBC will charge $25 for three sessions, $50 for eight, and $100 for 20, which is identical to Wayport's pay-as-you-go pricing.

He lives in San Francisco where many of the previously free local cafes have now banded together to charge $15 a month to use any of them. Too bad he can't pay just one subscription so he can get on networks at home and when traveling.\n\nWe're at that point in the market where roaming deals have to speed up or the folks trying to make money from hot spots won't get enough customers and we'll start seeing them die off. The Jupiter study from last week that found 1 percent of computer users paying for Wi-Fi is making me nervous. People aren't paying because there aren't good subscription plans available.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:30 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Roaming\n\nSony Ericsson Wi-Fi/GPRS Card\n\nSony Ericsson reportedly is soon to introduce a combined Wi-Fi/GPRS card: This story refers to it as a tri-band card, but only notes that it will support 802.11b and GPRS.

While clearly these guys shouldn't have done what they did, Lowe's has some responsibility for making the network at least reasonably secure. Otherwise, it's an attractive menace.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:24 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hacking\n\nAnother Small Town Gets Wi-Fi\n\nNevada, Missouri, a town of 10,000 has commissioned a Wi-Fi network to be built in town: The city is paying NeighborLink $25,000 to build the network. but it's not clear how extensive the network is. Without the network, which offers broadband to homes and businesses, city residents could only dial-up for Internet access.\n\nThe story notes that private providers may feel uncomfortable competing against a service like this one that is funded by the city government. I've been curious about how that may play out in a number of circumstances. However, here no other provider was willing to offer any kind of broadband so the city took the matter into its own hands.\n\nAround the country a number of municipalities are funding broadband networks--wired and wireless--because the big boys won't serve them. In those cases I don't think a potential conflict is an issue. Cities can't be expected to wait forever for the big boys to pay attention to them.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:23 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Metro-Scale Networks | 1 TrackBack\n\nHospitals Like Vocera\n\nEl Camino Hospital in Mountain View, Calif. is using Vocera's Wi-fi badges: The nurses say the system reduces the time it takes them to track down doctors, increasing the time they spend with patients.\n\nI'm wary of Vocera, mainly because it relies on voice commands. I've never, and I really mean absolutely never, been happy using any kind of system that requires voice recognition. It never works right. This article points out that people with accents have had trouble using it. I think there should always be a backup--a keypad or something in case the user is ready to throw the device out the window if the voice recognition doesn't work.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:19 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Voice\n\nPopcorn and Surfing May Co-Exist\n\nScientists have figured out how to focus the energy in a microwave oven more precisely to avoid zapping Wi-Fi networks: The research was intended to improve radar technology, but the University of Michigan team sees great potential in helping microwave oven makers produce Wi-Fi and other 2.4 GHz spread-spectrum technology friendly home appliances.\n\nAnd it's worth noting here again that microwave ovens do not irradiate food, as in exposing food to radioactive sources to sterilize them. Rather, beams of microwave energy reflected entirely inside the a sealed oven cause the dipole water molecules in food to twist as the energy is switched on and off, causing friction to heat food. (Here's a a whole pile of details on how these ovens work.)\n\nThe greatest risk from a microwave oven? Superheating water in a mug. It's very easy to do and extremely dangerous.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 8:00 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Future\n\nPrinceton Town Library Gets Wi-Fi, Confusion\n\nPrinceton Public Library will offer Wi-Fi, and possibly laptops to check out: It's another routine piece about a local library adding free Wi-Fi, but with a couple of funny notes. Patrons unaccustomed to Wi-Fi technology must know it is less secure than a hard-wire connection, Ms. Burger [the library's head] said. \"I wouldn't pay a bill (online) with it,\" she said. Actually, bill paying is almost always accomplished over an encrypted Web connection which is practically 100 percent secure if 128-bit encryption is used (the more usual default these days).\n\nAnother odd point. Although access will be free and The network will extend out to the new municipal plaza next to the library so a library user may sit outside and access the Internet they're also worried that the range typically spreads out so far that unauthorized users could take advantage of the service. So the library will set tighter limits. But if it's free and extends beyond the library, who is unauthorized?\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 9:07 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Libraries\n\nPorndriving in Canada\n\nGenerally well-informed piece from CTV in Canada exposes man's kiddie porn downloads from unprotected Wi-Fi networks: It had to happen, but you can't have sympathy for a man driving the wrong way down a one-way street, naked from the waist down, downloading child pornography. Child porn is one of the worst crimes against humanity that doesn't (necessarily) involve direct violence, and now it's come to unprotected Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe article makes it very clear that wardriving can be benign, which goes a lot further than similar writing elsewhere. The police don't sound as well informed as they should be given the accusations they're making. First, the report makes it sound as if they are calling wardriving itself telecommunications theft. Because wardriving is a passive activity at its heart, that's hard to make a case for. Second, the sex crimes child exploitation office notes people have actually gone to the trouble of spray painting red Xs in front of houses. I don't really believe this; it smacks of urban myth.\n\nA few years ago, a neighbor across the street knocked on the door quite flustered. Someone had broken into the house she and two other folks were renting. She wasn't sure the burglar had left. We called the police. In the meantime, she discovered that not only were some of her underthings missing, so were her wisdom teeth--she'd had them pulled years before and they were in a manila envelope in her jewelry box. The policeman who arrived told us quite solemnly that the teeth were stolen to be used in a satanic ritual. He was reading a book about it.\n\nThe Red X of Free Wi-Fi sounds equally urban mythologized, but I'm ready to be proven wrong with photographic evidence that's not the result of utility workers marking gas and water lines.\n\nI didn't buy into the series of ridiculous claims made over the last year or so about how open Wi-Fi access points would aid terrorists (terrorists don't need to be so conspicuous or easy to track to a physical location), spammers (who would apparently drive up and shoot millions of emails out instead of using the millions of unsecured mailers available worldwide), and other ne'er-do-wells (using Kazaa and downloading pirated music and software).\n\nBut this is more troubling. In fact, I can see that a very small number of child porn aficionados could ruin it for everyone, because if you're already mentally unbalanced or poorly made up enough to want to pursue one of the most prima facie illegal acts in most countries, an open Wi-Fi network is probably the ideal method of acting on it.\n\nHopefully, this won't turn into a weird backlash against community and other free networks that don't require accounts or tracking. I believe that purposely open networks are much less appealing than accidentally open networks: purposely open networks give the impression, at least, that someone's watching, and thus a malefactor would avoid it.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:11 PM | Permanent Link | Categories: Mainstream Media | 1 TrackBack\n\nListen to Rich Dean on Wireless Applications\n\nThe Capital Cabal is offering a free one-hour online chat with Rich Dean, a wireless applications expert: Dean's history is fascinating, and he's ideally positioned to talk about how wireless of all kinds of being applied to work and home.

He's concerned that rules around use of that band, which aren't clear yet, might hamper potential innovation there.\n\nWerbach also notes that this new spectrum won't do much to help out last-mile access because the high frequency impedes running signals quite as far as the 2.4 GHz and other lower frequencies.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:52 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Politics\n\nIntel to Build PC Chip with AP\n\nIntel is working on a chipset for PCs that will make the PC an access point for home users: Apple's offered a software base station feature for its operating system for many years (with a short gap during the early Mac OS X days). A software base station uses a Wi-Fi adapter and a software program to simulate the features of a dedicated access point. Windows XP can manage about the same task--with some technically missing access point features--using ad hoc networking and Internet network connection sharing.\n\nIntel's plan dovetails with some other chipmakers who have enabled this feature. The difference between an access point and a Wi-Fi adapter is often very slight--just different firmware. Putting that firmware into a computer program that can run under Windows is pretty straightforward. Intel hopes to eliminate the AP for home networks, but they miss the point that a computer has to be on all the time when it's a software access point, and that when it's turned off, rebooting, crashed, or defunct, you're out of luck.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:50 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Chips\n\nCompetition for Hot Spot Finders Heats Up\n\nJiWire, a Wi-Fi Networking News partner, and WiFinder are competing for the hotspot search market: The two have different plans for how to make money off the business.

Perhaps that's an indication of the power of Cisco as many enterprises that choose gateway solutions do so for the option of buying APs from anyone, usually Cisco.\n\nD-Link seems notably absent from the group of vendors offering WLAN switches now that NetGear has a WLAN switch that can support 15 APs.\n\nInterestingly, this article refers to Broadcom's recent allegations about degradations caused by Atheros chips but notes that D-Link customers in the U.K. don't have to worry about the issue.

The report is full of similarly sobering figures.\n\nThe report concludes a point that I think Michael Oh of NewburyOpen.net is proving, even though it's not his intention: hotspot operators will need to make money on something other than charging users for straight Internet access. Operators will need to realize internal productivity gains as well as third-party revenues--from services like Oh offers, such as printing--to get a return on the investments.\n\nSo a hotspot will make the most sense to an airline, for example, that builds a network in gates where employees can benefit and the general public might pay to use the network for special services.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:41 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Research | 1 TrackBack\n\nExcitement Builds Around MIMO\n\nResearchers at Arc Chart wrote a paper offering a general description of MIMO, or multiple input, multiple output: The technology employs multiple antennas at the receiver and the transmitter which can ultimately have the effect of boosting throughput.\n\nArc Chart positions MIMO in competition to folks like Atheros who have developed their own methods for increasing throughput on Wi-Fi gear.

Unfortunately for Broadcom, their demonstration didn't include a control test of Broadcom gear working in normal 802.11g mode.\n\nJim notes that D-Link, one of the Atheros chip users, stated that Broadcom-based devices running on channels 1 and 11 at full speed also produced enormous degradation in throughput -- even though the channels are widely spaced and should have virtually no effect on one another.\n\nWhat this argues, of course, is that 802.11g itself might have a major flaw in its ability to work on different channels on adjacent networks. What effect could this have? Pushing enterprise users more rapidly into the uncrowded, 24-nonoverlapping-channel 5 GHz 802.11a band, that's what. Atheros would love that, having specialized initially in 802.11a, so this whole tempest might have the unintended effect of making 802.11a substantially more attractive to the business world.\n\nJim concludes that proprietary modes are bad, which is accurate, but I disagree slightly with his assessment. I would argue that early implementations of draft IEEE standards generally move towards more and more compatibility (look at 802.11g's evolution, for instance, and the WPA interim standard for 802.11i), while purely proprietary plays like Texas Instruments's 802.11b+ (PBCC) tend to peter out without general support.\n\nBecause Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME) -- which include the frame bursting technology that Intersil, Atheros, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments are currently pushing out under many names -- is part of 802.11e, which is due for ratification probably by mid-2004, I expect that frame bursting will become more and more interoperable. Frame bursting also doesn't interfere with non-frame bursting devices: burst frames are just longer frames with more data but they're entirely legal within the 802.11b and 802.11g specification.\n\nJim's overarching point is well taken, and it's good to get a first-person report from someone who understands the technology and its implications.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 11:07 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hardware\n\nExtreme Leader Discusses WLAN Switches\n\nExtreme just began shipping its combined wireless and wired switches: I talked to the company for a story I did a while back and was impressed.

The intermediary was necessary because Atheros (along with many other radio firms) uses software-defined radio (SDR), which if not properly secured would allow a programmer to use illegal frequencies. To avoid FCC trouble, Atheros worked with Sam Leffler, who privately developed a hardware abstraction layer that sits between the driver and the hardware. That code remains private.\n\nBroadcom has been mocked and criticized repeatedly in open-source forums for not making a similar abstraction layer available so that Linux, FreeBSD, and other Unix-like platforms could use Broadcom's gear. (Older cards have had Linux and similar drivers written and companies released more information because the cards were hardwired to use just legal unlicensed frequencies in legal ways.)\n\nThe NDIS wrapper software emulates the abstraction layer in Windows that makes it easier for hardware vendors to write to a common specification instead of having to constantly develop custom drivers for each release of Windows. NDIS also lets software developers write to a standard abstraction instead of supporting each card and release.\n\nBy emulating NDIS, Linux users could simply write to the NDIS layer to build applications, which would include standard network interface clients.

AT&T said that they'd also offer and support the Nokia 6200 EDGE phone which can be used with a laptop or as a cell phone.\n\nEDGE is available outside the U.S. on AT&T's network in Puerto Rico and Bermuda, as well as Vancouver, British Columbia.

The studies don't show the clear-cut results in identical circumstances as routine cell phone use and aren't entirely conclusive. But taken in aggregate, there's enough smoke to worry about the fire, especially given the 10 to 20 years it takes for a brain tumor to grow large enough to become a problem.\n\nHere's where the science gets fuzzy, though, when proponents of childrens' health point to these studies as a way to restrict Wi-Fi use. Wi-Fi is regulated at a much lower signal strength and is rarely directly next to someone's head. Because of this, Wi-Fi is substantially less powerful, and any studies that wind up proving or disproving cell signals' effects on health should similarly be able to show the threshold below which problems don't occur, which will in turn be applicable to Wi-Fi signal levels.\n\nAfter reading this article and some recent studies, I don't think I'll ever spend much time with a cell phone next to my head again.\n\nThe hook on the article, by the way, isn't to frighten folks but to note that the federal government will spend $10 million to conduct research in this area. It's a large array of agencies: The methodology and direction will be set by the U.S. National Toxicology Program, a division of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health.

Broadband wireless isn't new: in fact, I was corresponding yesterday with Brett Glass, a founder of Lariat.org in Wyoming, which was operating 2 Mbps WaveLAN gear in 1993.\n\nIn the late 90s, several major telcos invested heavily in licensed-spectrum wireless broadband, buying up licenses in the educational/institutional MMDS/ITU band (2.5 GHz). Congress had authorized holders of geographic licenses in these bands -- holders that included hospitals, schools, etc. -- to sublicense these broadcasting/distance learning/misc. services frequencies to commercial users.\n\nSprint and Worldcom bought up practically all of the MMDS licenses -- Sprint spent a billion on them -- and AT&T used a much higher but licensed band above 10 GHz. None of these operations succeeded because they were using proprietary technology on frequencies that only they could use! Manufacturers were pumping out ever cheaper, lower-powered Wi-Fi and other spread-spectrum gear while the licensed broadband folks saw their costs stay the same. If you're the only customer (or maybe there's two), there's no much competition.\n\nUltimately, broadband wireless by the big boys died, and Om Malik's article traces the resurgence. There are several hundred broadband wireless ISPs in the U.S. -- one source says 1,800, but I think that's a count of cities in which the service is offered, not unique firms. And that's mostly the mom and pops.\n\nMalik documents both the growth in firms offering to-the-curb/final-mile service, and also the T-1 and higher replacement companies that can bring in tens of megabytes per second of quality service in a few days. One of the key benefits to broadband wireless is that it can be instantaneous. Once you have the tower secured and fiber or high-speed lines running to it, the line of sight is your oyster as an operator.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 8:45 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Metro-Scale Networks\n\nReading Vivato's Tea Leaves\n\nVivato gets switch approved, makes interesting statement: It's rare that reading a press release gives you insight into a company's direction, but given some of our earlier postings on this site about Vivato and the fact that we hadn't seen press releases mentioning major businesses, ISPs, or institutions, the announcement of FCC approval of their Wi-Fi Bridge/Router product (dual radios, $495) gives one pause.\n\nThe VP of marketing, Phil Belanger, says in the press release, The FCC approval gives us the green light to offer customers a complete line of standardized Wi-Fi solutions.

Oh wanted to extend Wi-Fi around his office, located on a tony stretch of Newbury Street in Boston, and to the shops on the street. He quickly concluded that he would have to charge users too much if he wanted to build a robust and reliable network that customers would pay to use. Instead, he decided to build a free network in hopes that it might serve as good PR for his Mac consulting, sales, and support business, Tech Superpowers.\n\nBut building a free network that included more than one access point (AP) would be expensive to maintain because it would require paying for high speed data lines for backhaul. So Oh developed his own network architecture.\n\n\"From an economic standpoint, it's an interesting architecture because it's simple,\" Oh said. \"We can put up nine locations with a single T1.\" At each remote location he uses Apple APs plus wireless bridges from Linksys that were originally designed to wirelessly enable printers. At his central location is an AP with two outdoor antennas, each pointing in a different direction. The remote repeaters look like any type of client to the central AP. \"So the AP at our location sees each repeater as nine client cards out there,\" he said.\n\nRead the rest of \"New Take on Free Hotspots: NewburyOpen.net\"\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 11:33 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hot Spot\n\n\"Leaks in the Wi-Fi Bubble\"\n\nThe San Jose Business Journal looks at cut backs at Trapeze and Vivato, referring to the setbacks as \"leaks in the Wi-Fi bubble\": The story also looks at Cometa's scaled down ambitions and is the fist place I've seen a Cometa spokesperson note that the company's original plans were overly optimistic. Cometa has gotten some flack for delivering on a slower pace but not admitting that its plans had changed.\n\nThe story also notes that Vivato has 40 customers, which is more than I thought.\n\nI think the piece unfairly picks on Trapeze for requiring customers to use its proprietary APs--all the WLAN switch vendors require customers to use their APs. Otherwise they couldn't offer all their whiz-bang features.\n\nBut ultimately those whiz-bang features may not be worth it for customers who don't want to replace existing APs or who don't like to feel forced to buy only a certain AP. I keep reading about increasing sales at companies like Bluesocket and Reefedge which both offer beefed-up security solutions to customers regardless of the APs they use.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:23 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Mainstream Media | 1 TrackBack\n\nBad Name, Interesting Product\n\nThe Washington Post doesn't begin to describe what Koolspan, the company with the bad name, does: But I spoke with Koolspan's vice president of marketing at a conference a few weeks ago and got the scoop.\n\nKoolspan is marketing a smart card solution that authenticates users and encrypts data over Wi-Fi networks. The solution is designed for small to medium sized businesses that don't already have a RADIUS server for authentication.\n\nCustomers must load software onto their APs which allows the APs to recognize user keys and authenticate the users.\n\nEnd users have a smart card that plugs into the USB port of their computer. The card encrypts the data sent from the laptop. The data is decrypted by an appliance that sits in the enterprise network, where the data is sent onward. The card supports 802.1X and performs AES encryption.\n\nThe nice thing about smart cards is that they essentially authenticate the user. A user inputs a password to release the keys on the smart card. That means that it's virtually impossible for two people to log on as the same user at the same time.\n\nGemplus, a maker of smart cards (or subscriber identity modules, SIM cards) for GSM networks, is also making a solution aimed at securing Wi-Fi networks. Smart card solutions have a better chance of taking off in Europe where all cell phones already use SIM cards but it's a secure solution that's worth looking at in the U.S.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:05 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Security\n\nBroadcom Alleges Atheros Chips Degrade Adjacent Networks\n\nBroadcom says that Atheros's 108 Mbps mode in its Super G featureset found in NetGear and D-Link devices significantly degrades nearby network performance across the entire 2.4 GHz band: Associate Editor Nancy Gohring and I filed this breaking news for PC World's online news site today. The allegations by Broadcom could shake the consumer industry slightly. We wrote this story now because Broadcom plans to demonstrate their findings at Comdex next week, and we felt this was the right time to provide the context we'd be been researching all week for the story.\n\nIf the methodology Broadcom used to conduct the tests is reproducible -- they claim these tests show that Atheros's products have a large negative impact on 802.11b and 802.11g networks -- then D-Link, NetGear, and Atheros will need to issue firmware upgrades, disable the mode, or recall equipment. Equally problematic: if Broadcom's claims are not reproducible or their testing methods and assumptions are faulty, they've gone a long distance out of their way to make themselves look unreasonable.\n\nYou might wonder why Nancy and I filed for PC World instead of breaking this news directly at this site. When Broadcom first briefed me on this problem on Monday of this week, I turned to the PC World editor who had recently assembled an exhaustive coverage section on 802.11g access points and their configuration and compatibility. That set of articles showed that many current 802.11g devices still have bugs to be worked out.\n\nIn discussions with the reviews editor and the online news editor at PC World, we talked about how best this story could be written without being either speculative or sensationalist. Their advice and willingness to act as touchstones in our reporting made it clear that we should work with them on the story. They vetted this through their network experts as well to confirm that the technical details were right.\n\nI had and have a lot of trepidation about this story. We don't want to seem naive and give credence to a claim that's scientifically provable and which I've seen the results of but not the process until we know that it's reproducible. But given that this is about to go prime time, as it were, we all felt it was the right point to provide as much background as possible to root Broadcom's claims and Atheros's rebuttal in reality.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 4:58 PM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hardware\n\nSome Say New 5GHz Rules Not Enough\n\nThe New America Foundation, Media Access Project, and some vendors say that the FCC hasn't gone far enough by adding more spectrum to the unlicensed band around 5 GHz: They complain that because the spectrum is high on the band and because of the power constraints set by the FCC, rural WISPs still can't adequately serve customers. They are asking for more unlicensed spectrum in the lower bands where signals can better penetrate interference like trees and travel farther.\n\nRural operators and vendors who try to serve them have long discussed the fact that while the existing power limitations may be useful in cities they unduly strap the potential of wireless in rural communities. Dave Hughes, who has done tons of research on the use of wireless in remote areas, has often suggested that the FCC might set different rules in rural areas. That's a good idea.

This action will also harmonize the spectrum available for these U-NII devices throughout the world, enabling\n\nmanufacturers to reduce product development costs by allowing the\n\nsame products to be used in many parts of the world.\n\nThe FCC is also requiring the items covered in IEEE 802.11h, which was developed to conform to European/World Radio Congress concerns, also apply to the lower indoor bands of 5.250-5.350 GHz as well as the new 5.470-5.725 GHz bands: dynamic frequency selection (DFS) - a listen-before-talk mechanism -- and transmit power control (TPC).\n\nThat additional 255 MHz should translate into as many as 12 additional nonoverlapping channels for 802.11a, which already has 12 nonoverlapping channels. In a talk with Atheros that Glenn had recently, the company noted that bonding channels in 802.11a to create multiple channel throughput of 108 Mbps or higher has enormous potential because of the lack of channel overlap.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 1:31 PM | Permanent Link | Categories: Politics\n\nICOA Buys Airport Network Solutions\n\nICOA, which puts Internet terminals in places like airports and hotels, bought Airport Network Solutions: ANS supplies Wi-Fi to the Sacramento, Calif. airport and ICOA already offers Wi-Fi in the Baton Rouge airport.

That means ultimately the two groups, the Multiband-OFDM Alliance on one side and Motorola, which recently announced intentions to acquire Xtreme Spectrum, on the other, may develop separate standards.\n\nAnalysts are concerned that a splintered vendor market may prohibit UWB from success, and rightly so. Even worse, the two groups might push incompatible products into the marketplace, leaving the consumer to make the choice with the wasted money and non-upgradable hardware that comes from that process.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:04 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: UWB\n\nGuinness Spurs Most Wi-Fi Use in U.K.\n\nA recent Intel study that ranked towns in the U.K. by the number of hot spots per capita, noticed that more hot spots in the U.K. are in pubs than anywhere else: That's certainly a big difference from the U.S. where cafes make up the largest group of hot spots. (As opposed to pub-based \"hot sots,\" which are overheated regulars.)\n\nThe Intel study ranked Exeter number one, followed by Bangor in Wales and then Newcastle. London ranked 33 because even though it has the most hot spots in the U.K.--and the second most in the world behind New York--its large population puts it lower on the per capita-based listing.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:01 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: International | 1 TrackBack\n\nWi-Fi Pricing Droping in U.K.--Debatable\n\nThis article points only to anecdotal evidence from a journalist to claim that the price of using public hot spots in the U.K. is dropping: In any developing market, service providers walk a tight rope between charging enough to cover their startup costs and failing to attract customers because of sky high prices. At the moment, the price of a subscription for Wi-Fi services is too high for most except the serious traveler, especially because there aren't yet enough hot spots. Hopefully a greater number of hot spots will attract more customers, which will in turn lead to lower prices. Maybe that's already starting to happen in the U.K.\n\nInterestingly, this intrepid traveler rants about how insanely high the cost of Wi-Fi is in Europe. He visited nine cities in the U.S. and had Wi-Fi access in eight. Just one of those charged a mere $9 a day for access. He then stayed in seven hotels in Europe and one offered Wi-Fi, for $60 a day and it never worked. Two of the hotels in Europe didn't have phones so no Internet connection was available from the room.\n\nTo be fair, this traveler doesn't mention which cities he stayed in so maybe he was pretty far off the beaten path. Still, I've stayed in decent hotels in Europe that have these ancient phone systems through which you can't even dial up. By contrast, just last week I took a road trip from Seattle to northern California and even cheap hotels in tiny towns at least had dial up while some had broadband wired access.\n\nSince the wired access in European hotels is generally poor, hotel managers there might see a great opportunity in Wi-Fi. Wireless networks will be much easier for them to deploy in a building that isn’t already wired.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 9:59 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: International\n\nForceNine Consultants Look at Hot Spot Market\n\nMuch of this study is really obvious: For example, it states that customers will either pay a monthly subscription or on a per-session basis. Ya think?\n\nBut, one interesting stat here is that just 17 percent of hot spots are in hotels, airports, train stations and conventions. These are the places, the study concludes, that business people will want Wi-Fi access. I suspect that number is a bit skewed because while maybe not so many conference centers have permanent Wi-Fi networks, often conference sponsors deploy a network for the duration of the show. Those instances wouldn't be included in the 17 percent figure.\n\nAlso, the study concludes that coffee shops are not conducive to business traveler usage. Really? I think they are. There's always a coffee shop and usually an empty seat nearby so seems to me a perfect place to park it and get some work done while on the road.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 10:59 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hot Spot\n\nConnexion by Boeing Racks Up Customers\n\nSingapore Airlines yesterday, today it's Japan Airlines: JAL said it will install Boeing's onboard Internet access service on 68 of its long-haul planes.

It authenticates and authorizes users who want to get on the network. Also, every 30 seconds, it logs packets sent over the network so an administrator can analyze network use at the AP level.\n\nCentral Control also includes hooks for functions like billing or an existing AAA security mechanism.

The Salford study shows that exposure to uniform radiation over a period of time in the GSM band can produce some ill effects in rats' brains.\n\nWhile this study should certainly disturb those in the cell industry, it's applicability to Wi-Fi is very very low. First, the band used in Wi-Fi is much higher than GSM and will have different characteristics. The researchers don't state the band in their study, for some reason, but mention that they have been working in the 900 MHz band for some time.\n\nSecond, the study shows that exposure over periods of time to uniform radiation cause the outcome. For cell phones, this is an issue, but for Wi-Fi, it is not. Wi-Fi is not only a bursty technology, in which there is not a constant transmission of peak signal power, but it's also a technology in which the brain is usually from a few feet to dozens of feet away from the radiation point source. Because signal strength varies by the inverse square of the distance from the source, comparing an enclosed uniform radiation field in the study with brains located even 18 inches away from a similarly powered Wi-Fi transmitter is meaningless.\n\nThe study that needs to be performed would have rats in a laboratory at a variety of distances from both bursty and continuously transmitting Wi-Fi transceivers using standard equipment that produces from 30 mW to 200 mW of power, and commercial omnidirectional and sectorized antennas.\n\nFrankly, this study makes me glad that I don't stick my GSM cell phone up against my head. I use a Bluetooth headset, which produces a fraction of the signal strength that a GSM does in normal usage and in a different band.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 9:35 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Politics\n\nPortland Continues Wi-Fi Push\n\nThe Portland Business Journal has another long article about the city of Portland’s plans to attract Wi-Fi networks and Wi-Fi companies: The Portland Telecommunications Steering Committee, a group of city government and business leaders pushing Wi-Fi in Portland, hope that a Wi-Fi cloud will cover not just downtown but the outlying suburbs.

One in San Jose already is, but I haven't heard of any Wi-Fi coverage over lines on the east coast along busy corridors around Washington, D.C., or New York.\n\nPosted by Nancy Gohring at 12:59 PM | Permanent Link | Categories: Hot Spot, International\n\nPortugal Launches Huge Hot Zone\n\nLisbon's Parque das Nações becomes massive Wi-Fi zone with 100 mesh access points covering 100 hecatres/250 acres: The park was the site of the 1998 World's Fair, and access will be free for the first six months. It then moves into a vendor-neutral host position in which any wireless ISP can resell access. The network will divide itself into VLANs with unique SSIDs for each WISP -- a very clever idea, indeed, because VLANs with unique SSIDs can run as an overlay on a single infrastructure. The project is backed by the government and the agency running the park.\n\nPortugal is well on the way to becoming the most egalitarian promoter of Wi-Fi usage in the world, through its subsidies and loans for laptop purchase by students, implementation of networks at universities, and generally encouraging attitude towards this uptake.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 10:56 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: International\n\n3Com Has Three-Mode Solutions\n\n3Com will shortly ship its a/b/g enterprise products: Proxim was first out of the gate with 802.11g enterprise gear, and 3Com now has a full line-up that they say will ship this month. The retail prices are quite extraordinarily high, and the question is whether in an age of commoditization in which a $100 consumer box handles WPA (TKIP), 802.1X, and other advanced features, whether you have enough value added in the enterprise realm to charge $750 for a more robust, more network-manageable version of the same thing.\n\nPosted by Glenn Fleishman at 9:42 AM | Permanent Link | Categories: Enterprise\n\nTime Wonders, Who Invented Warchalking? and Other Howlers\n\nIn a short piece on warchalking, writer fails the test: The author of this article in Time magazine finds a warchalk symbol (so he says...I've yet to see one in the wild), and writes a good, short piece about it.\n\nGood until he notes, Nobody knows who invented warchalking. This reminds me of some of the lines from my favorite canceled sci-fi animated series, Futurama, set 1,000 years in the future.\n\nWe're in the present, so I type who invented warchalking into Google, and most of the matches explain precisely, as is well known, Matt Jones invented it. He designed the sign, spread the meme, posted a PDF with the graphics in it. I wrote about him and warchalking for The New York Times, in fact.\n\nHilariously, the 2nd match on Google right now is this Time article. They have a lot of inbound links does Time magazine.\n\nTime published a huge package of wireless stories about a week ago. They come off as a little bland to me, because I know everything that's in them. To an audience that knows little or nothing about Wi-Fi, I'm sure this sounds much more exciting. But it reads like circa 2002 newspaper coverage.\n\nThe articles all have some missed notes, too, mostly in the technical and statistical details. In an article detailing business use of Wi-Fi, this statistic is thrown in: a surprisingly small number of U.S. firms that have installed wi-fi networks. Fewer than 5% of U.S. workers use them today, according to an estimate by Gartner, a high-tech research firm.\n\nUnfortun"
