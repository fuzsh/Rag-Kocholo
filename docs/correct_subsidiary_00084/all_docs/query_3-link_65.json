In the past we witnessed the PC revolution, the advent of the PDA, and the growth in the use of wireless LANs. Today a new technology referred to as wireless mesh networking has the potential to considerably influence how we communicate. Although derived from military research into mobile networks, the emergence of wireless mesh networking has its greatest potential in the commercial marketplace and is the primary focus of this book. Within a few years, wireless mesh networking may revolutionize the manner by which you can access the Internet as well as communicate with co-workers and friends. Although the software behind wireless mesh networking is still evolving, the concept behind the technology that eliminates the need for a centralized control mechanism is well thought out and will remain in place. In this book we examine the concept behind wireless mesh networking, its advantages over existing technologies and its existing and potential applications, and explore how some of the networking protocols associated with this technology operate by obtaining an appreciation for the technology in the office, government agencies, and in a campus environment as well as in the home. Because it’s the job of an author to fully inform readers of all sides of an issue, we note that there are some significant problems associated with wireless mesh networking. Some problems are associated with the scale of the network, with an increased area of coverage requiring more stations than a smaller network. Other problems, such as security, represent issues that must be considered regardless of the size of the mesh network. Still other problems, such as radio frequency interference, can represent both controllable and uncontrollable issues because it may be\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C000.fm Page xiv Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\ndifficult or impossible to control the use of machinery and fluorescent lighting by other organizations, yet alone the periodic sunspots that radiate hundreds of millions of miles onto our small planet. Thus, at applicable locations in this book we note the problems associated with wireless mesh networking as well as actual and potential solutions to such problems. As a professional author I truly welcome reader comments. Let me know if you feel I should expand upon a topic, if I provided too much information, and what topics you might like to read about in a future edition of this book.

This book is certainly no exception, as it required the efforts of many people to publish the book you are now reading. Once again this author is indebted to Richard O’Hanley at Auerbach Publications for green-lighting another idea and providing backing for this project. I would be remiss if I did not also thank the production staff at Auerbach Publications for turning this author’s manuscript into the book you are reading. Concerning the manuscript, it is with a great sense of pride that I wish to thank my wife, Beverly Jane Held, for her efforts in turning my handwritten notes into a professionally typed manuscript. Beverly typed this author’s first book on a 128-kb Macintosh many years ago. Although technology has certainly changed over the years, Beverly’s typing skills continue to maintain a level of accuracy that is truly appreciated.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 1 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction to Wireless Mesh Networking The purpose of an introductory chapter is to provide readers with basic information concerning the subject of a book. Because this book is about wireless mesh networking, as you might surmise the goal of this introductory chapter is to become familiar with this topic, terms associated with this topic, and even a few associated abbreviations. In this chapter we begin with an explanation of mesh networking and wireless mesh networks. This explanation includes a brief examination of different types of networking, with this author discussing networking structures commonly referred to as networking topology and the manner by which such structures evolved. As we review different types of networking topologies, we note some of the advantages and disadvantages associated with each structure, which will provide a foundation for examining the advantages and disadvantages associated with wireless mesh networking. Because modern mesh networks are built upon over-the-air transmission and primarily use existing wireless LAN networking components, it will come as no surprise that we also focus our attention upon this area in this chapter. Once we complete our initial examination of networking topology, we turn our attention to the different types of mesh networks, their advantages, and disadvantages. In concluding our introduction to the topic of mesh networks and wireless mesh networking, we examine some of the existing and evolving applications that have the potential to make wireless mesh networking\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 2 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\ninto an ubiquitous technology. That said, let’s grab a Coke, Diet Pepsi, or another drink and our favorite munchies and explore the wonderful world of wireless mesh networking.\n\n1.1 Mesh Networking Defined To understand mesh networking, we first need to obtain an appreciation for what a mesh topology represents. If we have n nodes in a network, where the term “node” refers to a communications device that can transport data from one of its interfaces to another, then the ability of each node to communicate with every other node in the network represents a mesh network topology. We can view the structure of a mesh network by simplifying the number of nodes in the network from a value of n, which is what mathematicians like to work with, to an easy-to-visualize number, such as three, four, or five.\n\nNodes and Links Figure 1.1 illustrates three-, four-, and five-node mesh network structures, in which each node has a communications connection to all other nodes in the network. The connection between each node is referred to as a link. If we examine the number of links associated with each network shown in Figure 1.1, it’s obvious that the number of links increases as the number of nodes increases. Although only three links are required to interconnect three nodes, six are required to interconnect four nodes, and ten are required to interconnect five nodes. If you take the time to draw six nodes and interconnect each, you would then note the need for fourteen links. What this means is that a classical mesh network structure in which each node is interconnected to every other node in the network becomes impractical as the number of nodes in the network increases. After all, when networks were first constructed, the links interconnecting nodes were dedicated or leased telephone lines. This meant that a separate physical interface was required by a node to connect to each link. That interface primarily performed parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversion, because data flows bit by bit on a serial link. Because each interface requires buffer memory and a node is a computing device with a finite amount of processing power, adding interfaces increases the amount of processing the node needs to perform until one interface too many is added that saturates the processing capability of the node. Thus, from a classical perspective, a mesh network in which every node can directly communicate with every other node has physical constraints that limit the number of nodes that can be interconnected.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 3 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nThree node mesh network\n\nFour node mesh network\n\nFive node mesh network\n\nFigure 1.1 In a true mesh network structure, each node has a connection to every other node in the network.\n\nControl Issues Recognizing the previously mentioned constraints associated with network nodes resulted in the development of more cost-effective partial mesh network structures. A good example of a partial mesh network would be the public packet networks constructed by Tymnet and Sprint during the 1970s and 1980s. Such networks consisted of hundreds to thousands of nodes, however, instead of each node being directly interconnected to every other node, they simply had two or more links to other nodes to provide an alternate routing and traffic balancing capability. Because nodes are not directly connected to one another, traffic would typically flow through one or more intermediary nodes to its destination, requiring the development of routing protocols that are based upon the transfer of control messages between nodes. Similarly, alternate routing and traffic balancing operations also required coordination, with control messages transmitted between nodes and a centralized network operations center required for controlling the flow of messages between nodes, which in\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 4 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nturn controlled the use of alternate links for backup and traffic balancing operations. This concept of the use of a partial mesh holds true for the “mother of all interconnected networks” better known as the Internet.\n\nModern Mesh Networking In a wireless environment, a single radio frequency (RF) transmitter/receiver in one node has the ability to communicate with a virtually unlimited number of other nodes. Thus, the physical constraints associated with wired connectivity becomes less of an issue in a wireless environment. This means it’s both a practical and a relatively simple process for one node to communicate with many other nodes because a single interface in the form of an RF transmitter/receiver can be substituted for the multiple interfaces required in a wired environment. Obviously, other nodes must be within transmission rage for communications to occur.\n\nWireless Networking Structures There are two basic types of wireless LAN networking structures, referred to as peer-to-peer and infrastructure. In a peer-to-peer networking structure, each node can directly communicate with every other node, assuming they are in transmission range of one another. In an infrastructure wireless LAN networking environment, all traffic flows through an access point (AP). The access point represents a two-port bridge, with one port connected to a wired network and the second port representing the RF transmitter/receiver. Thus, in an infrastructure wireless network two nodes communicating with each other do so by first transmitting to the access point which then regenerates the data. Because the access point in effect functions as a relay station, when transmission occurs between two wireless nodes the transmission distance between nodes can double in comparison to a peer-to-peer networking environment. However, the access point represents a central control mechanism and, if it fails or if a node is out of range of the access point, communications suffer.\n\nOvercoming Transmission Distance Limitations A solution to the need for centralized control and transmission range limitations of wireless nodes occurs by enabling each network node to function as a relay. Figure 1.2 provides a comparison of a wireless peerto-peer network, a wireless LAN infrastructure network, and wireless mesh networking. Note that in a wireless mesh networking environment each node functions as a router and repeater, forwarding data to the next node\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 5 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nPeer to peer\n\nInfrastructure\n\nAccess point\n\nWired network\n\nWireless mesh\n\nFigure 1.2 Comparing wireless LAN topologies.\n\ntoward its ultimate destination. In comparison, in a peer-to-peer environment transmission is limited to two nodes communicating with each other whereas in an infrastructure networking environment all transmissions occur through a centralized access point. However, because nodes can be modified to relay information we can group a sequence of peer-to-peer transmissions to obtain a mesh structure operating environment. Based upon the preceding, we can define a wireless mesh network as follows. A wireless mesh network represents a series of peer-to-peer transmissions where each node functions as a router and repeater. Note from the above definition that there is no requirement for any centralized control and in fact nodes communicate with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 6 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nWe can use an analogy to obtain additional information concerning the operation of a mesh network. Assume a room has a group of people, each having a similar communications device, such as a cell phone or notebook computer. If we are located in the room and need to send a message to a person located outside the room we could either move through the room or convey our message to another person, with the expectation that that person would relay our message until a person near the door could open it and deliver the message to the appropriate person located outside the room. If we think of each person in the room as a “client” or “node” then one person can relay our message to another as a peer-to-peer transmission. The person who opens the door to communicate our message to the person behind the door can be thought of as a network gateway. Thus, in a mesh networking environment, messages are passed in the form of electronic signals from client to client or node to node until they reach their destination on the network or a gateway for transmission off the mesh. Now that we have a general appreciation for the term “wireless mesh networking,” let’s backtrack a bit and discuss the general aspects of how networks evolved. Doing so provides us with a firmer understanding of wireless mesh networking including its relationship to wireless LANs and the advantages and disadvantages associated with the technology.\n\n1.2 Network Evolution Earlier in this chapter when we examined mesh networking we noted the term “link” was used to refer to the connection between two nodes. Both of those terms, “link” and “node,” are considered by some people as antiquated in today’s modern wireless environment. However, they represent a good starting point for examining the evolution of networking including different types of networks and mechanisms to move or transport data from one network to another.\n\nNetwork Topologies There are two generic types of network topologies or structures that evolved over the past half century. Those two generic topologies are referred to as point-to-point and multipoint.\n\nPoint-to-Point The first type of network structure consisted of a link interconnecting two nodes. This network structure is simply referred to as a point-to-point link\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 7 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nPoint-to-point\n\nMultipoint or multidrop or\n\nWireless multipoint\n\nAccess point\n\nFigure 1.3 Generic network topologies.\n\nbecause it directly interconnects two locations. The top portion of Figure 1.3 illustrates a point-to-point network structure.\n\nMultipoint To conserve the cost of leased lines, vendors developed poll and select software that enabled multiple terminal devices to be connected to a common communications line. Referred to as multidrop or multipoint networking, terminals were either individually located in different geographical areas or were clustered together and connected to a common communications line by a control unit. For either situation poll and select software permits multiple terminal devices to share a common communications line. The middle portion of Figure 1.3 illustrates the two types of multipoint communications used in a wired network environment. In a wireless environment the transmission of data from an access point can also be considered as multipoint communications. Although poll and select software is not necessary, the access point must address data to specific devices with which it wishes to communicate. Similarly, each device that needs to communicate with an access point must use the\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 8 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\ndestination address of the AP (Access Point) to ensure data is delivered correctly. The lower portion of Figure 1.3 illustrates an example of wireless multipoint communications. Through the use of a central facility referred to as a hub, you can create a star topology by routing point-to-point lines into the hub. Similarly, creating drops off a common point-to-point line creates what is referred to as a bus network structure. The key to the ability to create various network structures resides in different types of network addressing. Thus, let’s turn our attention to this topic.\n\nTypes of Networking Addressing There are three basic types of networking addresses, technically referred to as unicast, multicast, and broadcast.\n\nUnicast Addressing In a unicast address networking environment a packet has a single destination address. One of the earliest types of network architectures involved the connection of a front-end processor to control units, with each control unit interfaced to a group of terminals. In this networking environment each control unit represented a node and each connection between the front-end processor and a node represented a link. Data flowing from the front-end processor to an individual terminal connected to a control unit needed a specific terminal address to reach its intended destination. That address, which represented the specific terminal, became known as a unicast address.\n\nBroadcast Addressing If it became necessary to transmit a message to every terminal connected to a control unit, the flow of a sequence of messages in which only the destination address changed would be far from efficient. Recognizing this fact resulted in the development of a broadcast address. In our front-end processor to control unit configuration example, the control unit would examine each transmission from the front-end processor. If the destination address was for a specific terminal connected to the control unit the data would then be directed to that terminal. In comparison, if the destination address was a control unit broadcast address, the control unit would then replicate the message to all attached terminals. In a modern client/server environment routers replaced front-end processors and control units. Although each router functions as a network node the term “node” is rarely used today for this type of device. In\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\naddition, because most routers are connected to LANs, which in turn provide connectivity for tens to hundreds or thousands of personal computers, the need for a mechanism to transmit a common message to all computers on the network in an efficient manner continues. Because routers operate at the network layer whereas frames flowing on a LAN operate at the data link layer, this resulted in two types of broadcast addresses: a network (layer 3) broadcast address and a media access control (layer 2) broadcast address.\n\nTypes of Broadcast Addresses In an Internet Protocol (IP) networking environment a network broadcast address is formed by setting the value of the host address portion of the Class A, B, or C address to all 1s. For example, if the network address is 198.78.46.0, which is a class C network address, the broadcast address for that network then becomes 198.78.46.255. Here the value of 255 represents the decimal value associated with setting each bit in the last byte of the address to a value of 1. Table 1.1 lists the broadcast address values for Class A, B, and C IP networks, where the entries x. x. x and x. x. x represent valid dotted decimal values for each applicable IP class address. Although a broadcast IP network address is used to deliver one copy of a packet to all stations on a network, the actual delivery of the packet requires an address translation. This is because packets are delivered on a LAN via a data link layer 2 protocol, such as Ethernet or Token Ring. Thus, the layer 3 IP broadcast address must be converted into a layer 2 broadcast address. This occurs by the router encapsulating the IP packet into a LAN frame and filling in the 48-bit MAC destination address of the frame with all 1s. Although a network broadcast address needs to be converted into a layer 2 broadcast address for delivery, the reverse is not true. That is, stations connected to a LAN can transmit broadcast frames to each other without the frames having to be converted into IP packets. In fact, at layer 2 broadcasts are restricted to individual LANs. Now that we have an appreciation for unicast and broadcast transmission let’s turn our attention to a third type of transmission which is referred to as multicast and which is based upon multicast addressing. Table 1.1\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nIP Broadcast Addresses\n\nClass A\n\nx.255.255.255\n\nClass B\n\nx.x.255.255\n\nClass C\n\nx.x.x.255\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 10 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nMulticast Addressing A multicast address represents a special type of group address. To understand the rationale for multicast addressing assume there are ten client stations on a LAN whose operators wish to receive a video of the latest Mars landing. Without multicast addressing each operator would download an individual copy of the video in the form of a unicast transmission. Thus, ten individual video broadcasts would flow over the Internet and onto the LAN where the ten client stations reside. In addition to consuming valuable Internet resources in the form of having routers allocate processing power to groups of packets that only vary by their destination address, the multiple packets would consume both Internet and LAN bandwidth. Recognizing the potential waste of resources when multiple clients require access to the same data flow was the key motivation for multicast addressing. Under multicasting, a term used to denote the multicast process, clients subscribe to an event, such as the previously mentioned Mars landing video. In effect, the subscription results in the client station’s software being programmed to receive all frames that have a destination address associated with a specific multicast. Then, one sequence of packets flows through the Internet and onto the LAN, with each client that is associated with the multicast pulling copies of the LAN frames into memory for processing. As you might expect, other clients on the LAN that are not members of the multicast simply ignore LAN frames that are part of the multicast. Thus, multicast transmission represents a mechanism that conserves router processing power as well as Internet and LAN bandwidth. Now that we have an appreciation for the three types of network transmission and network addressing, let’s focus our attention upon the two major methods used to move data from one network to another: bridging and routing.\n\nBridging and Routing Bridging represents a layer 2 method for controlling the flow of data. Operating at the Media Access Control (MAC) layer, bridging is a relatively simple process for moving data that depends upon what are referred to as the three Fs: flooding, forwarding, and filtering. A bridge operates by constructing what is referred to as a port-address table. As a frame enters a port on the bridge it examines its destination address and compares that address to entries in its port-address table. If the bridge cannot locate a matching destination address it floods the frame onto all ports other than the port where it entered the bridge. In addition, the bridge notes the source address of the frame and the port where it entered the bridge, using this information to update its port-address table.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 11 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nIf the bridge can match the destination address in the frame with an address in its port-address table it will normally forward the frame onto the port associated with the address, a technique referred to as forwarding. The only exception to forwarding is when the port in the port-address table matches the port on which the frame was received. Because it makes no sense to forward a frame back to where it came from, the bridge filters the frame, in effect placing it into the big bit bucket in the sky. Thus, a bridge operates based upon the 3 Fs, flooding, forwarding, and filtering, using layer 2 MAC addresses as decision criteria. Routing represents a layer 3 method for controlling the flow of data. Because layer 3 represents the network layer, routing involves the flow of data between networks. In comparison, bridging occurs based upon layer 2 addressing, which results in the control of data flow between subnets linked together by a bridge. There are two key differences between bridging and routing. First, bridges are self-learning devices whereas routers require manual configuration. This means that a bridge is essentially a plug-and-play device that can be removed from its packing carton and installed without requiring manual configuration. In comparison, as a minimum, routers need to have their layer 3 addresses defined for each interface as well as other configuration data either entered into the device or selected from a predefined configuration list of options. Because routers are capable of traffic balancing and alternate routing they require a mechanism to alter the flow of data through a network, which results in the second major difference between bridges and routers. Routers employ a routing protocol, which enables data to flow from source to destination between intermediate devices that can provide alternate routing in the event traffic clogs a more favorable path or in the event an existing path becomes inoperative. In comparison, bridges simply examine layer 2 MAC addresses and either forward, flood, or filter packets without any ability to consider alternate paths for the flow of data. Now that we have a general appreciation for the differences between bridging versus routing, let’s focus our attention upon the topological characteristics of wireless LANs.\n\nWireless LAN Topology Every participant on a wireless LAN is commonly referred to as a station. Because an access point and a client connected to an access point can both be referred to as stations, the terms “client” and “access point” are better suited to distinguish one type of device from another and are used in this book. That is, client refers to laptops, desktops, and PDAs equipped with wireless LAN adapter cards, and access point is used to refer to a bridge that provides access between wireless and wired network devices.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 12 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nUsing the preceding information, let’s turn our attention to the manner by which groups of devices communicate with one another and the wireless terminology used to refer to certain groupings of devices.\n\nService Sets The grouping of two or more wireless LAN devices results in the formation of a service set. The actual type of service set that is formed depends upon the type of wireless LAN devices and the manner by which they communicate. When two or more clients communicate directly with each other (known as peer-to-peer or ad hoc communications), they form what is referred to as an independent basic service set. In comparison, when one or more clients communicate via the use of an access point, the AP and clients form an infrastructure service set. Because both an independent service set and an infrastructure service set have the same initials (ISS), we do not use these initial abbreviations due to possible confusion.\n\nBasic Service Set The term “Basic Service Set” (BSS) can be used to refer to any group of two or more wireless devices that communicate with each other, such as two or more clients that form an independent basic service set or one or more clients and an access point that form an independent basic service set. For either situation the wireless devices have a limited range. Thus, to enable wireless LAN devices to communicate with one another at extended distances required a mechanism to convey information between two or more BSSs. That mechanism is referred to as a Distribution System (DS) which is used to interconnect two BSSs that can be in the same building or located on different continents.\n\nDistribution System The actual medium used for the DS is not defined. Thus, the DS could be a wired Ethernet LAN, a point-to-point leased line, or even a wireless repeater. Because the BSSs are in effect extended by the DS, the connection of two BSSs by a DS is referred to as an Extended Service Set (ESS). Figure 1.4 illustrates the relationship between two BSSs and a DS that forms an ESS.\n\nMesh Network Evolution Although wireless mesh networks can be based upon a variety of technologies, their practical commercial evolution is primarily occurring\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nBasic Service Set\n\nBasic Service Set\n\nAP\n\nAP C\n\nC\n\nDistribution System\n\nC\n\nC\n\nExtended Service Set\n\nLegend Client station\n\nC\n\nAP access point BSS Basic Service Set DS Distribution System ESS Extended Service Set\n\nFigure 1.4 Relationship of wireless LAN service sets.\n\nthrough the use of wireless LAN communications. One of the first types of networks that evolved into a wireless mesh network structure was the wireless LAN ad hoc network. As previously discussed in our review of wireless LAN topology, the wireless peer-to-peer network structure is also referred to as an ad hoc network. In addition, an ad hoc network is commonly referred to as an infrastructureless network inasmuch as client stations communicate directly with other clients instead of having to go through a centralized access point. Because clients can enter and exit the network at will, the term ad hoc is also used to describe this type of networking environment. Because an ad hoc network lacks a centralized authority, each node needs to be capable of relaying information for data to move between nodes. The top portion of Figure 1.5 illustrates a four-node ad hoc network, indicating how packets can be routed from node A to D. In this example, data is not transmitted directly from source to destination. Instead, data is forwarded through intermediate nodes that in effect act as routers. If the top portion of Figure 1.5 represented a wired network, every node except the endpoints would contain two ports. The routing tables would be similar to those used by bridges, with the address of devices associated with the ports on each node. The lower portion of Figure 1.5 illustrates\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 14 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nA.

The network shown at the top of Figure 1.5 is formed by the routing information developed in each node. Thus, an entry in node A’s routing table informs it that B is the next hop for all packets destined to nodes B, C, and D. In a wireless environment each node has a single port in the form of an antenna. If a directional antenna is used, it becomes possible for the beam width and focus of the antenna to be adjusted based upon routing table entries.\n\nRouting Algorithms There are two routing algorithms that are commonly used with ad hoc networks that form the basis for the development of a mesh network. Those routing algorithms are dynamic source routing and on-demand distant vector. Thus, let’s briefly discuss how each algorithm operates, with a more detailed examination to occur late in this book.\n\nDynamic Source Routing Dynamic source routing represents one of several protocols being investigated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for use by ad hoc wireless networks. This routing protocol is based upon the concept of source routing, but it was modified to enable each node to be mobile. As a refresher, source routing represents an Internet Protocol (IP) option. When enabled, this option allows the originator of a packet to specify the path it will take to its destination as well as the path responses take\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nwhen the destination responds to the originator. Source routing is defined in the RFC791 standard and is primarily used for diagnostic testing of a specified route or when the default route for a connection is not optimal, perhaps due to an expected rise in traffic resulting from the availability of a new service. Dynamic source routing is similar to IP source routing. Under dynamic source routing, a route request is used to determine the path from the source to the destination. The destination issues a route reply, which provides the reverse path. Although the route between source and destination does not need to be a reverse image of the path between destination and source, some protocols require bidirectional connections. One such protocol is the IEEE 802.11 standard, which enables a destination station on a wireless LAN using dynamic source routing to simply reverse the route to itself to determine the route to the source. In a dynamic source routing environment, each node examines every packet it receives, an operating method referred to as promiscuous mode. As the node examines the addresses in each packet, it learns where other devices are located relative to the node examining packets. Due to this, nodes do not need to transmit periodic routing advertisements, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) transmissions that are used to inform other nodes of the state of the network.\n\nOn-Demand Distant Vector A second ad hoc routing algorithm is the On-demand Distance Vector (ODV) algorithm. Under this routing algorithm, each router advertises its view of the network to its neighbors in the for m of subnets directly connected to the device. Each neighbor uses this information to compute its distance to all other subnets. Unlike dynamic source routing that avoids routing advertisements, the on-demand distance vector algorithm uses periodic “HELLO” messages to track the state of the link between two nodes.\n\nAd Hoc Mesh Networks Now that we have an appreciation for the two routing protocols primarily used in ad hoc networks, let’s go a step further and examine how such networks can form the basis or foundation for a mesh network. As we previously noted, an ad hoc network consists of a series of two or more nodes communicating as peers. As we add additional nodes to the network, we obtain a mesh structure. The mesh structure represents a multidrop system in which nodes assist other nodes in transmitting packets through the network. Each node functions as a router, relaying packets\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 16 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nfor its neighbors. Through the relay process, a packet will be forwarded through intermediate nodes to its destination. In addition, because the routing protocol will adjust to its environment, nodes can enter and leave the network. Because modern-day communications are primarily client/ server, with the server representing a Web or mail server, the mesh network will more than likely be connected to the Internet. This is accomplished by connecting one of the nodes in the mesh to a router which in turn is connected to the Internet. Although additional nodes can be added to the network as long as they support the same routing algorithm used by other nodes, at a certain point in time the searching of routing tables will hinder network performance. Thus, there is obviously an upper limit on the number of nodes that can be grouped to form a mesh network. However, the upper limit will vary based upon the use of the network, with some applications that require less transmission delay having a lower limit on nodes than do other applications. Now that we have a general appreciation for routing protocols and the formation of a mesh network via a series of ad hoc nodes, let’s turn our attention to the advantages afforded through the use of a mesh network.\n\nAdvantages of Use There are many reasons to consider the use of a wireless mesh network. Some reasons, as we note shortly, may be more appropriate to one type of operating environment than another. The top portion of Table 1.2 lists six common advantages associated with the use of a wireless mesh network.\n\nReliability In a wireless mesh network each node functions as a relay to move packets toward their ultimate destination. Because nodes can enter and leave the mesh, each node must be capable of dynamically changing its Table 1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages Associated with the Use of Mesh Networks Advantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nReliability\n\nLack of standards\n\nSelf-configuration\n\nSecurity\n\nSelf-healing\n\nOverhead\n\nScalability Economics\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 17 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nforwarding pattern based upon its neighborhood. Thus, the mesh topology enhances reliability because the failure of one link due to RF interference, the movement of a vehicle between source and destination or another phenomenon, will result in packets being forwarded via an alternative link toward their destination.\n\nSelf-Configuration Because nodes in a mesh network learn their neighbors and paths to other nodes, there is no need to configure each node. Thus, the selfconfiguration capability of nodes can considerably reduce the need for network administration.\n\nSelf-Healing Because nodes in a wireless mesh network dynamically learn their neighbors as well as links to other nodes, there is automatic compensation for the failure or removal of a node. Thus, in the event of a transmission impairment that adversely affects the use of a link or the failure of a node, other nodes establish alternate paths. The establishment of alternative paths results in a self-healing capability.\n\nScalability As we previously noted, nodes can enter and exit a mesh network as long as they operate software compatible with other nodes in the network. This means that you can extend the area of coverage of a wireless mesh network by simply placing new nodes at appropriate locations where they can communicate with existing network nodes. Thus, a wireless mesh network is scalable. However, the number of nodes you may require and the upper limit concerning the total number of nodes you can have in a network will vary based upon your organization’s physical and technical operating environment. Concerning the physical environment, the number of obstacles as well as the level of RF interference will govern the number of nodes required within a given area. In comparison, the routing protocol and processor capability of each node will govern the number of nodes that can be added to a network prior to transmission degrading to an unacceptable level.\n\nEconomics If we consider some of the previously mentioned benefits associated with wireless mesh networks, one implied but not discussed additional benefit\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 18 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nis economics. Because a wireless mesh network does not require centralized administration nor do nodes require manual configuration, such networks are less expensive to set up and operate than conventional networks. Similarly, the ability of wireless mesh networks to automatically resolve link and node outage problems via their self-healing capability eliminates the necessity for manual intervention when things go wrong. Because employee hourly rates can easily exceed the cost of wireless LAN adapters and even some access points, the elimination or even a reduction of the need for manual intervention can provide considerable economic benefits for most organizations.\n\n1.3 Disadvantages of Use To ensure readers have a fair and balanced view of wir eless mesh networks, this author would be remiss if he did not mention some of the disadvantages associated with the technology. Those disadvantages which are listed in the lower portion of Table 1.2 include a lack of standards, security, and the overhead associated with relaying packets through nodes to their ultimate destination.\n\nLack of Standards At the time this book was written, several organizations were in the process of developing wireless mesh networking standards. Because it will be several years until such standards are promulgated and supported by vendor equipment, organizations that currently create mesh networks can be viewed as pioneers. Although some people may view pioneers as those susceptible to catching arrows in their backs, creating a wireless mesh network using proprietary software is not necessarily bad. The key factor to note is the lack of interoperability between different vendors because there are no existing standards with which vendors can tailor their products to comply.\n\nSecurity Because nodes within a wireless mesh network function as routers relaying packets to other nodes, security is an important issue. As the number of nodes in a wireless mesh network increases, you in effect have more locations where insidious persons can view your data. In addition, if software permits nodes to be added without centralized control, a mechanism is required to ensure the node is legitimate and not a PC operated by a hacker. This means that a method of authentication of nodes is\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 19 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nrequired in addition to securing the flow of data through nodes, two security areas that need to be addressed by both standards and proprietary products.\n\nOverhead The old adage, “There is no free lunch,” is also applicable to wireless mesh networks. Because nodes must learn their neighbors as well as paths to other nodes, they must create and maintain routing tables. As network traffic and the number of nodes in the network increases, so will the amount of processing devoted to routing packets. Thus, the efficiency of routing software as well as the number of network nodes and level of network traffic results in processor overhead that can adversely affect the performance of the node to perform other tasks. Now that we have an appreciation for the advantages and disadvantages associated with wireless mesh networks, we conclude this introductory chapter with a brief examination of potential applications suitable for this technology.\n\n1.4 Applications Similar to other communications technologies, wireless mesh networks can support a variety of applications that is only limited by one’s imagination. Currently, the primary use of the technology is to support extended access to the Internet within a geographical area. Over the past year several vendors introduced proprietary products that through software convert IEEE 802.11 client stations into mesh network nodes capable of forwarding packets from other nodes toward a gateway. The gateway, which is connected to the Internet, provides all nodes with Internet access. If you envision a group of suburban homes or a group of apartments within a building, you can immediately visualize the economic benefits afforded by a wireless mesh network. Instead of each homeowner or apartment dweller having a separate cable or DSL modem connection to the Internet, the use of mesh networking technology can considerably reduce Internet connections. Depending upon the number of homeowners or apartment dwellers, perhaps one or a few Internet connections will be able to replace several dozen to a hundred or more separate connections. In a business environment wireless mesh networking can be used to extend wireless LANs between floors within a building and even as a mechanism to interconnect two or more buildings. Although it’s easy to visualize the economic benefits afforded by reducing the number of Internet connections from one per client to one per group of clients,\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 20 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nredundancy, reliability, and scalability are also enhanced. In addition, because a mesh network could provide multiple paths to the Internet that are dynamically adjusted when transmission impairments occur, the redundancy of such networks will provide enhanced reliability. This means that a wireless mesh network can be suitable for factory floors and other “harsh” RF environments where current networking technology encounters limitations due to the environment.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 21 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nChapter 2\n\nRadio Frequency Utilization In the first chapter in this book we became acquainted with various networking terms including obtaining a definition of a mesh network and learning about the service sets and operational modes of wireless LANs. In this chapter we turn our attention to obtaining an understanding of how wireless mesh networks utilize the frequency spectrum. In doing so we become familiar with such terms as “frequency” and “bandwidth,” the location in the frequency spectrum where different frequency bands used by wireless mesh LAN networks reside, and power measurements, because the latter are necessary to obtain an understanding of the relationship between antenna sensitivity and transmission range. Using power measurement information then allows us to discuss the use of antennae and how antenna sensitivity and barriers in the form of buildings, vehicles, and even people affect transmission range. Thus, this chapter can be viewed as building upon our prior knowledge of mesh networking presented in the previous chapter by focusing our attention upon some specific technical information that governs the operation of wireless transmission.\n\n2.1 Frequency, Period, and Bandwidth Three key terms that govern the operation of wireless devices are frequency, period, and bandwidth.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 22 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nA. Operating at one cycle per second\n\nB. Operating at two cycles per second\n\nFigure 2.1 The sine wave.\n\nFrequency Frequency represents the oscillation or movement of a signal per unit of time. In the field of data communications the sine wave is commonly used as a signal onto which information is impressed via modulation, with the term modulation representing the altering of a signal. Thus, to obtain an appreciation of frequency, let’s focus our attention upon the sine wave. The top portion of Figure 2.1 indicates a sine wave operating at one (1) cycle per second. The complete signal cycle is shown to require one second; hence, we say the frequency of the signal is one cycle per second or 1 cps. Another term used to express frequency is Hertz (Hz) in honor of the German physicist, where 1 Hz is equivalent to 1 cps. The lower portion of Figure 2.1 illustrates a sine wave operating at 2 cps or 2 Hz. Note that at 2 cps the sine wave completes two cycles in one second. Similarly, if the sine wave made three complete cycles in one second its frequency would be 3 cps or 3 Hz, and the occurrence of four cycles in one second would result in a frequency of 4 cps or 4 Hz. Thus, as the number of cycles per period of time increases, the frequency of the oscillations increases.\n\nPeriod As we just noted, the frequency of a wave refers to how often it completes a cycle with respect to a uniform period of time. That period of time is\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 23 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nnormally expressed as a second because the terms cps and Hz refer to oscillations within that amount of time. The relationship between frequency and period is shown below. Frequency = 1/period Period = 1/frequency As noted, frequency and period are inversely proportional to each other. We can consider frequency as representing how often something happens, whereas period represents the time in which the event occurred. Because the symbol f is used for frequency and the symbol T is used for period, the relationship between frequency and period can also be expressed as follows. F = 1/T and T = 1/F Now that we understand the relationship between frequency and period, let’s turn our attention to a third key term, bandwidth.\n\nBandwidth Bandwidth represents a range of frequencies. Normally, when we discuss bandwidth requirements of a communications device we refer to a contiguous range of frequencies required by the device. Thus, we can express bandwidth as follows. B = fH – fL where fH = highest frequency fL = lowest frequency\n\nFrequency Bands In just about every country on our globe, the use of the frequency spectrum is regulated. To prevent regulations from stifling the development of electronic equipment most countries belong to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and comply with its recommendations concerning the utilization of frequency. Doing so enables such varied communicationsdependent applications as radio, television, and aircraft navigation systems to operate as you cross borders from one country to another. Because it’s desirable to allow certain types of equipment such as portable telephones, microwave ovens, and similar devices to operate\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 24 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nwithout their manufacturers and owners having to acquire licenses, certain frequency bands are not regulated. Such frequency bands are referred to as unlicensed bands and are supported by most countries. Some unlicensed bands are available for use on a global basis, although slight variances in the frequencies of other bands occur as you move from country to country. The most popular unlicensed frequency bands are referred to as ISM bands, with the initials ISM referring to Industrial, Scientific, and Medical. As we examine the operating fr equencies of wireless LANs later in this chapter, we note that they primarily operate in two unlicensed ISM frequency bands. Table 2.1 provides a list of communication-based applications and the frequency they commonly use. Note that wireless LANs can operate in the United States in five distinct frequency bands. The first band, which occurs in the 900- to 929-MHz range, represents a band allocated by the FCC for personal communications and which was used by manufacturers of first generation, nonstandardized LANs. Two additional frequency bands used by wireless LANs are in the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz frequencies. The 2.4-GHz ISM frequency band is used by IEEE 802.11b- and 802.11gcompliant devices, and the 5-GHz ISM band is used by equipment that is compatible with the IEEE 802.11a standard. Although not considered to represent conventional wireless LANs, two additional types of wireless technology that can be used for mesh network connectivity are WiMax and ZigBee. WiMax, an acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Devices, is designed to operate in both unlicensed and licensed frequencies ranging from 2 GHz to 66 GHz. In comparison, the ZigBee Alliance, which represents a group of semiconductor manufacturers, technology providers, equipment manufacturers, and end users, was in the process of developing standards for wireless transmission for data rates of 250 kbps at distances up to 200 feet for both star and mesh network topologies. Although Zigbee-compliant products will operate in the 2.4-GHz ISM frequency band (which represents a global unlicensed band), they will also operate in two other unlicensed bands. Those bands are 915 MHz for use in North America and 888 MHz for use in Europe. To assist readers who may lack familiarity with IEEE wireless LAN standards as well as knowledge of WiMax and ZigBee, let’s briefly focus our attention on the basic IEEE 802.11 standards, the IEEE 802.16 standard and the relationship of ZigBee to the IEEE 802.15 radio frequency standard.\n\n2.2 IEEE Standards In the United States the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) delegated responsibility for the development of LAN standards to the IEEE.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 25 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nTable 2.1 Common Wireless Applications and Their Frequencies Application\n\nFrequency Band Used\n\nAM radio\n\n535–1635 kHz\n\nAnalog cordless telephone\n\n44–49 MHz\n\nTelevision\n\n54–58 MHz\n\nFM radio\n\n88–108 MHz\n\nTelevision\n\n174–216 MHz\n\nTelevision\n\n470–806 MHz\n\nWireless data\n\n700–720 MHz\n\nCellular\n\n806–890 MHz\n\nDigital cordless\n\n900 MHz\n\nPersonal communications\n\n900–928 MHz\n\nNationwide paging\n\n929–932 MHz\n\nSatellite telephone uplink\n\n1610–1625.5 MHz\n\nPersonal communications\n\n1850–1990 MHz\n\nSatellite telephone downlink\n\n2.4835–2.5 GHz\n\nIEEE 802.11b/g wireless LANs\n\n2.4 GHz\n\nIEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee alliance\n\n2.4 GHz\n\nIEEE 802.16/WiMax\n\n2–66 GHz\n\nIEEE 802.11a wireless LANs\n\n5 GHz\n\nLarge dish satellite TV\n\n4–6 GHz\n\nSmall dish satellite TV\n\n11.7–12.7 GHz\n\nWireless cable TV\n\n28–29 GHz\n\nAs a result of this delegation the IEEE initially developed standards for wired Ethernet and Token Ring LANs during the 1980s. Approximately 20 years later the IEEE developed its first wireless LAN standard which is referred to as the 802.11 standard.\n\nThe 802.11 Standard The first wireless LAN standard developed by the IEEE was the 802.11 standard. This standard defined the use of three physical layers for wireless\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 26 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\ncommunications: infrared, Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS). Vendors developed products that used FHSS and DSSS for wireless LANs during the late 1990s, however, to the best of this author’s knowledge no products were ever developed to follow the IEEE 802.11 infrared communications standard.\n\nFHSS Under the frequency-hopping spread spectrum a station transmits for a small period of time at one frequency, with the period referred to as dwell time, and then hops to a different frequency to continue communications. The frequency-hopping algorithm is known to each LAN station, enabling each station to adjust its transmitter or receiver according to its mode of operation. One of the more interesting aspects of FHSS is the fact that its origin dates to the actress Hedy Lamarr who suggested the technique to the United States War Department during WWII as a transmission security mechanism.\n\nDSSS Direct sequence spread spectrum represents a second transmission technique developed by the military to overcome enemy jamming. Under DSSS a spreading code is applied to each bit to spread the transmission. At the receiver a “majority rule” is applied. That is, if the spreading code is 5 bits and the bits received were 10110, because three bits are set, the receiver would assume the correct bit is a 1. Under the IEEE 802.11 standard an 11-bit spreading code is employed.\n\nUtilization The initial use of 802.11 wireless LANs was limited due to their relatively low data rate. This was because each of the three physical layers was only defined for operations at 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps. Recognizing the need for a higher data transmission rate resulted in the IEEE initially developing two extensions to the basic 802.11 standard. Those extensions are known as the 802.11a and 802.11b standards.\n\nThe 802.11a Standard The IEEE 802.11a standard defined a series of new modulation methods that enable data transmission rates up to 54 Mbps. The higher data rates are obtained by the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), a technique in which the frequency band is divided into subchannels that\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 27 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nare individually modulated. The IEEE 802.11a standard defines operations in the 5-GHz frequency band. This means equipment supporting the standard is not backward-compatible with the basic 802.11 standard because that standard defines operations in the 2.4-GHz frequency band. In addition, because high frequencies attenuate more rapidly than low frequencies, this results in 802.11a wireless LAN stations having a shorter range than stations operating in the 2.4-GHz band. This in turn requires an organization to deploy more access points to obtain a similar geographical area of coverage than would be required via the use of access points operating in the 2.4-GHz band.\n\nThe 802.11b Standard The second extension to the basic IEEE 802.11 standard is the 802.11b standard. Under the IEEE 802.11b standard, DSSS was used with two new modulation methods to provide a data transfer rate of 11 Mbps and 5.5 Mbps. The 802.11b standard also provides compatibility with 802.11 DSSS equipment operating at 2 Mbps or 1 Mbps. To provide this compatibility, the IEEE 802.11b standard specifies the use of the 2.4-GHz frequency band.\n\nThe 802.11g Standard A comparison of the IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b extensions to the 802.11 standard indicates advantages and disadvantages associated with each. Although the 802.11a standard provides a higher data transfer rate, its use of the 5-GHz frequency band results in a shorter transmission distance. Similarly, in a reverse manner, the IEEE 802.11b standard provides a greater transmission distance but lower data rate than obtainable from the use of 802.11a-compatible equipment. By combining the modulation method used in the 802.11a standard with the frequency band employed by the 802.11b standard, the IEEE provided a mechanism to extend both the data rate and transmission range of wireless LANs, resulting in the 802.11g standard. To provide backward compatibility with the large base of 802.11b equipment, the 802.11g standard also supports DSSS operations at 11, 5.5, 2, and 1 Mbps. Thus, the relatively new IEEE 802.11g standard can be considered to represent a dual standard because it provides 802.11b compatibility.\n\nThe WiMax Standard WiMax represents a wide area networking technology that can be used to transmit broadband signals at distances up to approximately 30 miles.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 28 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nWiMax was standardized by the IEEE as the 802.16 standard, which was published in April 2002. WiMax has some similarities to wireless LANs; however, it is also significantly different from the IEEE series of 802.11 standards. Concerning similarities, like the 802.11-compliant products WiMax involves the use of client stations using antennae to communicate with a centralized station. That centralized station is referred to as a central radio base station under 802.16 terminology and is designed to provide an alternative to cabled access networks, such as coaxial-based systems operated by your cable company in which you use a cable modem to access the Internet and a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) for Internet access commonly offered by your local telephone company. Although the original 802.16 standard was defined for use in the 10to 66-GHz frequency band that represents spectrum available on a global basis, such high frequencies represent a significant deployment problem. This problem results from the fact that high frequencies have short periods, which restricts transmission to line-of-sight operations. Recognizing this problem, the IEEE developed an extension to the 802.16 standard known as 802.16a. This new standard defines an extension of WiMax to operate at lower frequencies in the 2- to 11-GHz band, to include operations in both licensed and unlicensed frequency bands. As with the series of wireless LAN standards, WiMax supports pointto-point and point-to-multipoint transmission. In addition, the 802.16a standard extension is designed to add support for mesh networking. Also similar to its wireless LAN cousins, WiMax supports several modulation methods, such as single carrier and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), with the latter support occurring via the use of 256 and 2048 point transforms. Unlike its wireless LAN cousins, WiMax represents a much more sophisticated transmission method and includes support for Time Division Duplexing (TDD) as well as Forward Error Correction (FEC) employing Reed–Solomon coding.\n\nThe ZigBee Standard In concluding this section describing IEEE standards suitable for wireless mesh networking, we focus our attention upon obtaining a brief overview of a networking technology recently developed to transfer data at distances between 30 to 200 feet while consuming an extremely low amount of power. This technology, which is backed by the ZigBee Alliance, is standardized by the IEEE 802.15.4 specification. In order to support low-power wireless transmission, ZigBee equipment operates at a relatively low data rate in comparison to the other IEEE\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 29 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nstandards discussed in this section. ZigBee-compliant products permit data rates of 250 kbps when operating in the 2.4-GHz band where ten channels are available for use. When ZigBee-compliant devices operate in the 915MHz band where six channels are available for use, their maximum operating rate is reduced to 40 kbps, and operations at 868 MHz where a single channel is available results in a maximum data rate of 20 kbps. The goal in developing ZigBee technology was to provide a standard for the operation of remote monitoring sensor devices. Such devices typically operate on battery power within an industrial environment. Due to this, batteries powering the remote monitoring and sensor equipment need to last for a year or more to reduce maintenance cost. Thus, the low power requirement of ZigBee-compliant products is especially well suited for remote monitoring and sensor devices. In addition, because ZigBee battery-powered devices can be placed into a sleep mode of operation, this action further reduces the drain on a battery. In addition to remote monitoring and sensor-based applications in industrial areas, it’s expected that ZigBee-compliant products will find their way into home-based applications. Such applications can include wireless home security; remote thermostats for heat pumps, air conditioners, and furnaces; remote lighting; and even remote controls for television and audio systems. Under the IEEE 802.15.4 standard’s addressing scheme, 255 active nodes are supported by a network coordinator. Although most home-based networks will employ a single network coordinator, multiple network coordinators can be linked together to create very large networks. For example, the use of 16 channels in the 2.4-GHz frequency band permits a ZigBee network to contain over 3000 nodes. ZigBee-compliant devices can transmit up to approximately 30 meters in comparison to Bluetooth’s 10-meter limit. In addition, a ZigBee network with a single network coordinator can support up to 255 devices in comparison to 8 for a Bluetooth network. Due to these differences, ZigBee represents a more powerful networking technology than Bluetooth, however, it’s important to remember that at short distances Bluetooth transmission rates are approximately a magnitude beyond that obtainable by ZigBee products.\n\n2.3 Power Measurements The ability to understand antenna sensitivity as well as general RF operations depends upon knowledge of power measurements. Thus, in this section we turn our attention to this topic and obtain an appreciation for several terms associated with power measurements.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 30 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nThe Bel The first power measurement term we discuss traces its roots to the evolution of the telephone network. Named after the inventor of the telephone, the Bel (B) uses logarithms to base 10 to express the ratio of power transmitted to power received. The resulting gain or loss of a circuit is given by the following formula. B = log10 (Po /PI) where B = power ratio expressed in Bels Po = received or output power PI = transmitted or input power The rationale for the use of logarithms to base 10 corresponds to the manner by which humans hear sounds. That is, our audio capability perceives sound or loudness on a logarithmic scale. For example, if you estimate, based upon your hearing, that a signal doubled in its loudness, the transmission power actually increased by approximately a factor of ten. A second reason for the selection of logarithms for use in power measurements results from the fact that changes to a signal in the form of signal loss due to resistance or signal gain due to the use of an amplifier are additive. Thus, the ability to add and subtract when performing power measurements based on a log scale considerably simplifies computations. For example, a 10-B signal that encounters a 5-B loss and is then passed through a 20-B amplifier results in a signal strength of 10 – 5 + 20 or 25 B.\n\nLog Relationships There are two log relationships worth noting that can be used to simplify power measurement computations. First, you can note that the logarithm to the base 10 (log10) of a number is equivalent to determining how many times 10 is raised to a power to equal the number. For example, log10100 is equivalent to determining how many times 10 is multiplied by itself (raised to a power) to equal 100, with the answer being 2. Similarly, log101000 is 3, log101000 is 4, and so on. In examining the preceding equation we can note that under normal circumstances the output or received power can be expected to be less than the input or transmitted power. When this situation occurs the numerator in the preceding equation (Po) will be less than the denominator (PI ). To simplify computations when this situation arises we can use a second property associated with the use of logarithms. This second property\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 31 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\npermits us to easily resolve fractional computations as we merely have to prefix the computation with a negative sign to flip its fraction to a whole number. That is, log101/X = –log10 X Once we prefix the computation with a negative sign and flip numerator and denominator, it becomes relatively simple to compute the log. For example, let’s assume that the power received is one-hundredth of the transmitted power. Then, our initial computation of the gain or loss becomes: B = log101/100 As previously noted, log101/x = –log10x. Thus, using this relationship we obtain: B = –log10100 = 2 Note that the computational result is negative, which indicates that a power loss occurred and is precisely what we would expect inasmuch as the received power was a very small fraction of the transmitted power. In comparison, a positive Bel value would indicate a power gain, because the output power would be greater than the input power. Although your initial reaction might be dubious concerning a power gain, you need to remember that a signal flowing through an amplifier could result in this situation occurring. In a wireless LAN environment a client transmitting to another client through an access point has its signal regenerated by the AP. If the AP has a higher power level this situation is equivalent to an amplifier in a wired environment. Although the Bel was used for many years to categorize the quality of a transmission circuit, it gradually lost favor due to the requirement for a more precise measurement. The use of the decibel (dB) provided industry with the precise measurement it sought and for all practical purposes has replaced the use of the Bel. Thus, let’s turn our attention to the decibel, which is better known by its abbreviation, dB.\n\nThe Decibel The decibel represents the standard used today to denote power gains and losses. As previously noted, the decibel represents a more precise measurement than the Bel. This is because the dB represents one-tenth of a Bel. To indicate this, we multiply the previously noted computation of\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 32 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nthe Bel by 10 to obtain the computation for the decibel. That is, the power measurement in terms of decibels is computed as follows. dB = 10*log10 (Po /PI) where dB = power ratio in decibels Po = output power or received power PI = input power or transmitted power To illustrate an example of the computation of a power ratio in dBs let’s return to our prior power ratio computational example. In that example the received power was measured to be one-hundredth of the transmitted power. Thus, the power ratio in decibels becomes: dB = 10 log101/100/1 = 10 log101/100 Because log101/x = –log10X, we obtain: dB = –10 log10100 = –20 In comparing the results of our computations for the Bel and decibel for the same input and output power measurements, note that the decibel is precisely 10 times the value computed for the Bel. Thus, the dB provides the ability for more precise power measurements and today is the preferred power measurement in use.\n\nDecibel above 1 mW The terms Bel and decibel represent a ratio or comparison between two values, such as input and output power. Although they are important tools, they are not useful for comparing two circuits inasmuch as they do not specify a common input power level. Thus, for comparing two or more circuits we would want to inject the same amount of power into each circuit and observe the level of received power. In the wonderful world of telecommunications testing a 1-mW signal occurring at a frequency of 800 Hz is used in North America. To ensure that you do not forget that testing occurred with respect to a fixed 1-mW signal the term “decibel-milliwatt” (dBm) is used. Output power with respect to a 1-mW test tone is computed in dBm as follows. dBm = 10 log10 (output power/1 mW input power)\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 33 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nTable 2.2\n\nRelationship of Watts and dBm\n\nPower in Watts\n\nPower in Decibel-Milliwatts\n\n.001 mW\n\n–30\n\n.01 mW\n\n–20\n\n1 mW\n\n0\n\n1W\n\n30\n\n1 kW\n\n60\n\n1 MW\n\n90\n\nNote we use the term dBm to remind us that the output power measurement occurred with respect to a 1-mW test tone. Although the ter m “decibel-milliwatt” is used in most literature, in actuality dBm means decibel “above” 1 mW because the output or received signal is based upon the input of a 1-mW signal. Thus, 10 dBm more correctly represents a signal 10 dB above or bigger than 1 mW, 20 dBm represents a signal 20 dB above 1 mW, and so on. One interesting power relationship concerns a 30-dBm signal. A 30dBm signal is 30 dB or 1000 times larger than a 1-mW signal. Thus, 30 dBm is equal to 1 W. We can use this relationship of 30 dBm being equal to 1 mW to construct a watts to decibel-milliwatt conversion table which is shown in Table 2.2. Most of the entries in Table 2.2 should be self-explanatory, however, let’s review them to ensure we are all on the same path. Let’s start our review with the third line in the table, where 1 mW is shown as equivalent to 0 dBm. Because dBm = 10 log10 (Po /PI) the only way to achieve 0 dBm is for Po to equal PI . Thus, 0 dBm must have an output power of 1 mW. Once we understand that 0 dBm is equivalent to 1 mW, then the other entries in the table are easy to understand. For example, 1 W is 1000 times greater than 1 mW. Because 30 dBm represents a signal 1000 times that of a 1-mW signal, then 1 W is equal to 30 dBm. Similarly, 1 kW is 1000 times greater than 1 W and 1 MW is 1000 greater than 1 kW. Thus, we need to add 30 dBm for each, resulting in 1 kW being equal to 60 dBm and 1 MW being equal to 90 dBm. The only remaining entries to review are the first two. Because .001 mW is one-thousandth of the input power of 1 mW, we obtain: dBm = 10 log101/1000/1 = 10 log101/1000\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 34 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nor dBm = –10 log101000 = –30 Thus, –30 dBm is equal to .001 mW of power. Similarly, .01 mW requires an output one-hundredth of 1 mW, which is equal to –20 dBm.\n\nThe Decibel Isotropic Because wireless devices communicate via the use of antennae another metric that warrants our attention is decibel isotropic, abbreviated as dBi. This metric is used to define the gain of an antenna relative to a hypothetical antenna that radiates output uniformly in all directions. This uniform radiating antenna only exists in theory and is known as an isotropic antenna. Thus, dBi represents a measurement of how much better an antenna is in comparison to an antenna that transmits signals equally in all directions. The computation of dBi is based upon the decibel, resulting in the gain (G) of an antenna. Specifically, G = 10 log10(IA /Ii ) where G is the gain of the antenna in dBi, IA is the electromagnetic field of intensity measured in microwatts per square meter (mWm2) generated by antenna A, and Ii represents the electromagnetic field of intensity produced by an isotropic antenna and similarly measured in microwatts per square meter, with both measurements occurring at the same distance from the antennae. Because the dB is commonly used in communications it’s often helpful to have access to a table of dB and power ratio values. One such table is provided in this chapter to assist readers in any computations they may have to perform. Table 2.3 contains a decibel reference table, with decibels ranging from 0 dB to 100 dB with the equivalent power ratio for each dB entry. Because dB values are algebraic, you can add or subtract one value from another to obtain a desired value. For example, from Table 2.3 the power ratio for 10 dB is 10, and the power ratio for 20 dB is 100, because doubling the dB increases the power ratio by a factor of ten. Working up from 10 dB, a +3 dB is equivalent to a power ratio of 2 × 10 or 20. Thus, 13 dB is equal to a power ratio of 10 + 20 or 30. Similarly, adding another 3 dB (10 + 3 + 3) for a total of 16 dB results in a power ratio of 50 (10 + 2 × 10 + 2 × 10).

As noted earlier in this chapter the gain of an antenna is measured in dBi. A higher antenna gain is better than a lower value and the overall gain of an antenna indicates its ability to pick up a radio signal.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 36 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nAntenna Categories Antennae can be subdivided into two general categories, omnidirectional and unidirectional. An omnidirectional antenna radiates in all directions. In comparison, a unidirectional antenna radiates in only one direction. That direction has a variance, referred to as a beam width, which indicates the directionality of the antenna. In general, antenna directionality is closely related to antenna gain. By concentrating its RF energy in a specific direction, an antenna obtains more gain. An omnidirectional antenna primarily concentrates its radiated energy into the horizontal plane. Antenna gain is increased by concentrating emitted energy out of the antenna horizontally.\n\nPolarization As we noted earlier in this section, an antenna converts electrical current into electromagnetic waves that are radiated into space. The direction by which the electromagnetic waves flow is referred to as the polarization or the orientation of the emitted radio waves. In general most antennae radiate either linear or circular waves. A linear polarized antenna radiates waves entirely in one plane, with the plane representing the direction of wave propagation. In comparison, a circular polarized antenna’s plane of polarization rotates in a circle in which one complete revolution occurs during one period of the wave. When the rotation of the wave is clockwise it’s referred to as Right-HandCircular (RHC), and a counter-clockwise rotation as you might expect is referred to as Left-Hand-Circular (LHC). Antennae can be horizontally or vertically polarized. When horizontally polarized the majority of the electromagnetic waves flow horizontally or parallel to the Earth’s surface. In comparison, a vertically polarized antenna has the majority of its electromagnetic waves flow perpendicular to the Earth’s surface. The electromagnetic radiation pattern is normally shown through the use of two plots. One plot, in the form of a 360˚ circle, has concentric rings from a center specified in dB as shown in the left portion of Figure 2.2. A second plot indicates the strength of the electromagnetic waves with respect to viewing an antenna from its side. An example of this plot is shown in the right portion of Figure 2.2. Antennae used with most access points are vertically polarized. This results in a radiation pattern that flows in all directions outward from the antenna. Because wireless LANs require a near line-of-sight path due to their low power and high frequency, most access points include dual antennae. Such antennae are referred to as\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 37 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nElevation (Vertically)\n\nElevation (Horizontal)\n\n−40 −30 −20 −10 0\n\nFigure 2.2 Antenna radiation patterns.\n\ndiversity antennae and software selects the antenna receiving the better signal as a method to reduce the effect of signal reflections. Unlike a stereo where you can turn up the power only limited by your speakers to whatever setting you desire, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States as well as other regulatory bodies restrict RF transmission power to include that of wireless LANs. That restriction occurs in terms of Estimated Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP). EIRP considers the transmitter output power, line loss associated with cabling the transmitter to the antenna, and the antenna gain. Figure 2.3 illustrates the computation of EIRP. Note that gains are added to the Transmit Output Power (TOP) and losses are subtracted to obtain the EIRP. For example, if the transmitter output power is 30 dBm, cable loss is 1 dB, and the antenna gain is 7 dBi, then the EIRP becomes 30 – 1 + 7 or 36 dBm, which just happens to represent the maximum EIRP Antenna gain TPO Transmitter Cable Loss\n\nEIRP = TPO − cable loss + antenna gain Legend: TPO Transmitter Power Output\n\nFigure 2.3 Computing EIRP.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 38 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nallowed by the FCC. This means that in order to stay within legal limits, you need to consider all three components of EIRP.\n\nDirectionality and EIRP Antennae can obtain more gain by focusing their radiated energy in a specific direction. For example, an omnidirectional antenna primarily concentrates its energy into the horizontal plane in a 360˚ radius because transmitting RF energy vertically is not normally beneficial. In comparison, a unidirectional antenna concentrates its energy in a narrow beam, with the term “beam width” used to refer to the angular width in degrees between the half power points (3 dB down from the maximum) of the major lobe in either the elevation or azimuth radiation pattern. EIRP represents the effective power in the main lobe of a transmitter relative to an isotropic radiator that has a 0-dB gain. EIRP equals the sum of the antenna gain in dBi and the power injected into the antenna less cabling loss. For example, assume your transmitter outputs a 16-dBm signal via a cable with a 1-dB loss into an antenna that has a 12-dBi gain. Then, EIRP = 12 dBi + 16 dBm – 1 dBm = 27 dBm. From the preceding, note that a 27-dBm signal represents a signal 500 times above 1 mW. Thus, the effect results in the antenna radiating 500 mW of power. However, because EIRP is less than 36, you can consider either boosting transmission power or using an antenna with a higher gain to enhance transmission and reception of data.\n\nTypes of Antennae There are numerous types of antennae in use today. Some of the more popular types you will encounter include the whip, dipole, loop, patch, and yagi. Figure 2.4 illustrates each of the previously mentioned types of antennae.

Although commonly used in automobiles they are not normally used in wireless LANs. This is because the rod does not permit energy to be focused and as a result the whip antenna does not have a high gain.\n\nDipole Antenna The dipole antenna represents a simple type of antenna that is very popular in communications applications. The dipole antenna has a straight electrical conductor that measures one-half wavelength from end to end, connected at the center to an RF feed line or cable. The dipole antenna is a balanced antenna due to its symmetry. Because of its design it is also referred to as a doublet. Dipole antennae are omnidirectional and have a relatively low gain with the RF field primarily focused in the vertical direction. Because it’s impractical for many communications devices to have both positive and negative dipole areas when a device sits flat on a desk or other surface, the half dipole is used in place of a dipole antenna.\n\nYagi Antenna A yagi antenna can be viewed as a dipole with directors and reflectors added before and after the dipole. The reflectors and directors are metal rods of similar length to the dipole that concentrate RF energy into a beam, increasing the gain of the antenna. A yagi antenna commonly has one reflector and one or more directors, with the overall rating of the antenna being a function of its total number of elements. A yagi antenna can be considered to represent a directional form of a dipole antenna.\n\nConsidering Power Limits As previously noted, FCC regulations restrict transmission to 36 dBm (4 W) EIRP in the 2.4-GHz frequency band. Because transmitter power and antenna gains are cumulative you need to consider both to stay within legal limits. Table 2.4 provides a summary of the relationship of power injected into an antenna, antenna gain in dBi, and EIRP in dB.\n\nAntenna Selection When the distance between wireless LAN stations increases you can either add repeaters or use directional antennae to better support communications.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 40 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nTable 2.4 Legal Relationship among Power Injected into an Antenna, Antenna Gain, and EIRP in the 2.4-GHz Band Power at Antenna (dBm/Watts)\n\nAntenna Gain (dBi)\n\nEIRP (dBm)\n\n30 (1 W)\n\n6\n\n36\n\n27 (500 mW)\n\n9\n\n36\n\n24 (250 mW)\n\n12\n\n36\n\n21 (125 mW)\n\n15\n\n36\n\n18 (62.5 mW)\n\n18\n\n36\n\n15 (31.25 mW)\n\n21\n\n36\n\n12 (15.125 mW)\n\n24\n\n36\n\nFor example, a single-element antenna may provide a gain of 6 dBi, whereas a specialized parabolic antenna could provide a gain well over 24 dBi. However, because the EIRP maximum is fixed at 36 dBm, this means you may need to lower the transmit power when using certain types of high-gain antennae. For example, if transmit power is 27 dBm (500 mW) you can only use an antenna with a gain of 9 dBi or less, as any gain over 9 dBi would result in an EIRP greater than 36. Of course, you could lower the level of transmit power, but doing so would defeat the purpose of acquiring a high-gain antenna. If you have low-power devices you can consider the use of an antenna with multiple elements referred to as an array antenna. Figure 2.5 illustrates a four-element array antenna, which can be used to enhance transmission distance by generating RF energy in a particular direction. Such antennae are referred to as tuned element array antennae. By using dif ferent frequencies for each element and changing their transmission phase the\n\nFigure 2.5 A four-element array antenna.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_C002.fm Page 41 Monday, May 2, 2005 1:37 PM\n\nantenna becomes a phased-array antenna, with similar operating characteristics to distant early warning phased array radar. That is, such antennae become highly directional and their use in wireless LANs may occur by the time you read this book.\n\nReceiver Sensitivity In concluding this section let’s turn our attention to receiver sensitivity. The sensitivity of an antenna has a considerable bearing on its ability to receive a signal. Although the FCC does not place limits on r eceiver sensitivity, IEEE standards denote receiver performance standards. For operations in the 2.4-GHz band, IEEE wireless equipment should have antenna sensitivity less than or equal to –80 dBm. Because 60 dB is equivalent to a power ratio of a million to 1, –80 dBm means that the antenna should be capable of picking up one-hundredth-millionth of a signal. Wireless LANs are essentially line-of-sight transmission systems. Thus, as you might expect, their transmission distance is greater outdoors than indoors. Table 2.5 lists the transmission distances for a Linksys (now a part of Cisco) 802.11b access point. By appropriately placing repeaters it’s possible to extend transmission distances, which enables wireless devices to form a mesh network that spans a considerable distance. As we continue our journey of exploration, we note how homes within communities can be connected to one another in a mesh network environment that enables one or a few Internet connections to be shared among all users instead of requiring each happy homeowner to pay a monthly bill.

In this chapter we build upon the preceding chapters by turning our attention to common components that function as building blocks for the construction of mesh networks. Such components include what some vendors refer to as “wireless modems,” mesh network bridges, routers and extenders, access points, and switches. After examining a series of components as separate entities, we focus on the integration of components to form a wireless mesh network.\n\n3.1 Understanding Mesh Network Components In this section we examine several mesh network components, commencing our examination with the familiar wireless LAN card which is also referred to as a wireless modem. In doing so we note that many wireless mesh networking components can be used either as is with special software for a limited distance or can be obtained with a different radio technology that provides an extended transmission capability. Thus, the latter provides you with the ability to construct a wireless mesh network over a greater geographical area with a minimum number of access points or routers required for servicing clients.\n\n© 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group.\n\nAU2960_book.fm Page 44 Monday, April 11, 2005 11:01 AM\n\nWireless LAN Cards With special software that turns a wireless LAN client into a mesh network participant you can use standardized IEEE 802.11 client hardware. Such hardware is available in many form factors, ranging in scope from PCMCIA adapter cards inserted into a laptop or notebook card slot to PCI adapter cards that are inserted into a desktop computer’s system expansion slot and USB combined memory modules and wireless LAN technology. By adding software that provides routing and relay capabilities, the conventional wireless LAN client becomes a participant in a wir eless mesh network. Thus, it becomes possible for client computers within a building or in a neighborhood where homes are in close proximity to one another to share one or a few high-speed Internet connections.
