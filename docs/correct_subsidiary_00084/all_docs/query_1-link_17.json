He says the conditions which should govern the strength of the British Navy differ radically from those governing the strength of the navy of any other nation. This Is an Incontrovertible fact, though one likely to be lost sight of In the maze of propaganda en- deavoring to show that mutations In British naval strength will forward the cause of Inter- national peace. Such propaganda is based on false assumptions. It must always remain a dangerous procedure to endeavor to estimate what British requirements are In co-relation to those of countries which have not empires to de- fend. In the course of his statement of the situa- tion Sir 8ydney Freemantle says: •The great sea highways are the internal lines of communication of the British Empire, and on their security depends our continued na- tional existences. The assessment of the st rength of the Navy, which constitutes the insurance of that security, depends upon a multitude of con- ditions which vary from year to year. Predomi- nant among these conditions are the degree of probability of a quarrel with any of the sea Powers. Subsidiary conditions, but conditions of almost equal Importance, are the facilities for asserting sea power, our own or that of potential enemies. In the areas In which our Unes of com- munication may be threatened, and the relative Importance to us of the sea routes in the respec- tive areas. Such conditions cannot be a function of the naval strength of any one Power.\" The bogey that Is fostered by propagandists for parity In naval strength, and. incidentally, naval disarmaments. Is that of tlvalry in building between the United States and Great Britain. That is a bogey that has been exploited In the United States. In reality there Is no such rivalry from the British standpoint; Great Britain has built In the past for the purpose of her Empire requirements and for the security of her own economic well being. The stand taken by Sir Syd- ney Freemantle Is that the United States should build and maintain a navy of such strength as she thinks fit. Great Britain, he believes, should, while giving weight to every treaty and every agreement which may tend to lessen the proba- bility of war, build and maintain a navy of the strength that is required In the exercise of her own independent Judgment. That Judgment, cannot maintain when there are considerations of • parity\" or of a \"yard -stick\" applicable to navies of individual Powers, \"and Irrespective of our relations with those Powers and of our sev- eral strategic situations.\" Sir Sydney Freemantle has outlined a policy that is one of naval self-respect and self-reliance. It Is after all. the only policy which will deter- mine British security. It Is a policy, too he says. • which will obviate expensive and WMt''u ' m tuatlons in naval expenditure, and which will give us the best value for what we want-namely, the Navy proportioned to our requirements as judged by the Government of the day In the light of the current International situation.\" THE DOUKIIOBOR PROBLEM The problem of disobedience to the law. of the land by elements of the Doukhobor Met has persisted for a number of years; In fact It has recurred ever since that sect came to Canada upward of thirty years ago. Instead of being nearer to solution it tends to become more aggra- vated all the time, particularly since the organi- sation known as the Sons of Freedom came into existence The handling of the situation by the Provincial Government Is costing the taxpayers money, too much money to have spent on a problem which should never arise *t *»• ™* Utest development illustrates the stubbornness of the Sons of Freedom. They maintain that they will recognize neither taxes Imposed nor the school laws of the province This Is tantamount. Jn Stoln language, to saying that they are In \" The longer a situation of this character Is allowed to drag the greater likelihood there is of Its becoming aggravated. It la true that a num- ber of the malcontents are to serve sentences for Infractions or the law. the particular charge upon which they have been convicted being an act of indecency. There do not appear to have been any charges at all because of Incendiarism The experiment is being tried of taking a select- ed number of the children of the Sons of Free- dom from the care of their parents and placing them in a provincial home This may. or may not have a beneficial effect; It will be good for children in disciplining their minds to the usages of cMlliatlon. but It Is doubtful If It will exert any Influence on the recalcitrant mentality of their parents In the meantime, in order to enforce the law. the province Is being put to un- due expense British Columbia has been very long-suffer- lna In dealing with the Doukhobor problem It has recognised that a considerable element of ihll MM £ hard-working, self -sacrificing and of value in the industrial development of the prov- taea That element would gladly control th fan.M '« mMtU. but fanaticism I directions appears to b«' ' liable it the ei tire responsibility rests with kenen 1 tuiurr .-«-,„,„, of action If the antics remaTn^* IT* not tO be allowed remain as a pr^lm, bo*Woi'« The taxpayers have u*. vH? .?

M M ATIOS The in and out form of horses on the rare 1 1 m ssta of British Columbia was notably illustrated In Monday s racing at Colwood A specific In- stance will suffice. On previous form in a num- ber of races a horse named York Home lengths superior to an animal n Hill over the distance of a mlie and a fraction, and the weights as between the have been approximately the same rent meetings York Home, up to Monday last, has been consistently beating Hill and Hill, ja tm -t m one race over the distance nqted. has shown a superiority which, considering the man- ner In which the running took place, could be computed at seven lengths. On Monday, how- ever Hill and Hill reversed previous decisive beatings and won handsomely from York Home The majority of the money bet on the race was or? Y?rk Home to win. the public following the record of the form chart with credulity worthy of a better cause. This reversal In running does not appear to have caused any qualms among the stewards at the race meet. So far as the public are aware there' was no Inquiry for an explanation from the owners, trainers and Jockeys of the **£n mala. A good deal might be said MM» ner In which York Home was ridden, but , th * t Is distinctly a matter for the awards \"ho «a» to r position of being guardians of the public In- terest at a race meet.

THE IMPERIAL RACE It Is fashionable in these days to frame slogans, and there are two which 1 would offer to the consideration of every middle-class couple who enter Into the holy state of matrimony The one is that a couple of sons are batter than a motor-car. and the other Is that 'Buy British -made\" Is food, but \"Breed British -born\" Is bettor The demand for morally-sound, well- educated men and women Is almost Infinite, and cer- tainly far beyond the supply Not only all the pro- fessions and social service* at home, but also the well being and whole destiny of great masses of backward populations In the tropics depend upon that supply being forthcoming — Dr Cyril Norwood in The London News and WaatmlnsUr.

It was something we never had thought about or dreamt of. The thing Sir Oliver said was that the brain was not an Instrument of thought at all. but that the cells of the brain were merely instruments through which thought* were expressed by some mysterious power at present beyond human ken. In proving his thesis the lecturer likened the human brain to a musical instrument. The violin is capable of producing sweet music, but the entrancing musical strains inherent In the fiddle can- not be made manifest to the human ear through the will or volition of the instrument. That miracle la wrought by the hand and soul of the master musician. • • • The thought that entered our mind after reading that startling theory, which the lecturer admit* is not yet susceptible of proof, was that the brains of human beings like violins, must vary considerably In their qualities. There must be brains of the Stradlvarius calibre and brains of the common wood and ordinary workshop standard Either that, or the mysterious power that plays upon the brain discrim- inate* unfairly in the selection of instrument* of thought. The sub- ject is fascinating, but It Is too pro- found for our feeble and halting philosophy. If we pursued It further we might soon be flounder- ing as helplessly as we assuredly would be If we attempted to follow Sir Oliver Into the realms of his spirit world. • a • The people of England are said to have been wrought up to a state of terrible nervous apprehension when they saw their first railway train rushing through space at the tremendoua rate of twenty miles an hour. They declared that Oeorge Stephenson was flying In the face of Providence when he drove his Rocket, the parent of millions of locomotives, over an enclosed rail- way at double the normal speed of a stage coach. They Insisted that the murderous machine must be stopped. They petitioned Parlia- ment to refuse charters to any more- railway companies.

At the morning sendee a large portrait of the late Dr Butler, founder of the New Though! move- ment in Victoria, which was pre- sented to the Temple by Mrs. Emerson, of Sidney, was unveiled with fitting ceremony by Mr. J. D. Fraaer. while Mr. O. HaHet. one of the original students under Dr. Butler, recalled his unselfish devo- tion, fortitude and kindly wisdom. Mr. J. Elrlck. chairman of the Temple committee, extended to the congregation a sincere welcome to the new auditorium, explaining that with Its central location, modern construction and equipment, artis- tic decorations and furnishings and large seaUng capacity, it was a home of which the organisation might well be proud. The hard- wood floors are easily cleared for dancing and the adjacent dressing- rooms, reading-room and fully equipped kitchen are admirably suited for all social functions. * The final talk of the morning was by Prof. R M Mobiun. who briefly outlined the basic teachings under- lying the New Thought philosophy in a most interesting and forceful manner. The evening sendee was con- ducted by the resident leader. Mrs Evaiyn Da vies. Appropriate musical selections were rendered by the newly-formed choir, under the direction of Mr Wm C Ellis The soloists for the day were Mrs. J B Shaw and Mr. Ellis, accompanied on the piano by Miss Barbara Fraaer. On Friday evening of this week the opening social and dance will be held. LEADER SPEAKS OF B.C. JOURNEY Hon. R. B. Bennett liknwi Re- cent Itinerary In B.C.— Tartrr The outstanding features that struck Hon. R B Bennett, leader of the Liberal-Conservative party In Canada, during his recent tour In the Canadian West, he said In an Interview in Montreal, were the growing Interest of the people In political matters, the remarkable fu- ture that lies before British Colum- ola, especially if a sane and reason- able tariff ran be established and wisely applied, and the Injury that certain branches of agriculture out there, such as fruit growing and market Hardening, are suffering through the unrestrained dumping of United States surplus products He was passing through Montreal on his way to Quebec to attend the meeting of the Canadian Bar Asso- ciation. \"I spent Hve weeks in British Co- lumbia.\" he said, \"and visited every Federal constituency. I went in by the Windermere country, and came out through Pernle and Mscleod. I went as far north as the Premier mine and Stewart, and within a few miles of the American International boundary', and motored through the Inf \"dor QWMJa MINERAL WEALTH \"The Province of British Colum- bia has all-year porta at Vancou- ver, New Westminster. Prince Rup- ert and Victoria, with grain ele- vators. There are at least three pulp and paper mills on the Coast, north of Vancouver large fish-packing plants, several copper and silver mines. In the Interior large fruit- packing establishments, and the great smelter and mines at Trail and Klmberley The mineral wealth has only been scratched yet, and what the possibilities are in such a prov- ince, with an area as large as an empire and with only 600,000 popu- lation, can best be left to the Im- agination. The deposits of Iron In- sure ultimate steel production, and If trie political policies of Canada were such as to permit us to utilize in finished form the great wealth of British Columbia we could give em- ployment to a very large Industrial population \"What struck me most was the great Interest people are showing in political matters. There la no elec- tion In sight, but In many Instances the auditoriums were packed to the doors. So far as I could see. the young men and women of Canada are looking to the future of their country and Its development and will not be content with policies that result In the exportation nf raw and partly processed manufactured materials. INJURIOUS EFFECTS •The failure of the Oovemment to pass an order- in -council to pre- vent the dumping of American fruit upon the Canadian markets has re- cently had moat injurious effects upon the fn."
