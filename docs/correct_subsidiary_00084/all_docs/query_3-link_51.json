        "text": "[http://www.sri.com/robotics SRI International: Pioneering Robotics ] ] .\n\nSRI has more than 1,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. [ [http://www.sri.com/rd/hot.html SRI International: Hot Technologies for License ] ] SRI International conducts research and development in many areas, both independently and for hire, and sells reports on independent research.\n\nIn 1970, the Stanford Research Institute formally separated from Stanford University and, in 1977, became known as SRI International. The separation was a belated response to Vietnam war protesters at Stanford University who believed that SRI's DARPA-funded work was essentially making the university part of the military-industrial complex.\n\nIn the 1970s, SRI undertook a number of research projects outside of the scientific mainstream, including research into expanded human consciousness and claims of extraordinary human abilities such as those attributed to celebrity psychic Uri Geller (see below).\n\nResearch History\n\nThe following is a summary of some important SRI research projects. [ [http://www.sri.com/about/history/ SRI official web site history page] ]\n\n1940s\n\nIn 1948, SRI began research and consultation with the petroleum company Chevron to develop an artificial substitute for tallow and coconut oil used in making soaps. SRI's investigation confirmed the potential of dodecyl benzene as a suitable replacement, and later Procter & Gamble used the substance as the basis of their successful laundry detergent, Tide.\n\n1950s\n\nIn the early 1950s, the Disney brothers sought SRI's advice regarding a small amusement park called Disneyland which they intended to build in Burbank, California. SRI provided them information on such topics as location, attendance patterns, and economic feasibility. SRI also selected a much larger site, in Anaheim, and prepared reports covering many aspects of operation. They also provided on-site administrative support and continued an advisory role for some time as the park expanded.\n\nIn 1952, the Technicolor Corporation contracted with SRI to develop a near-instantaneous electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented the Scientific and Engineering Award jointly to SRI and the Technicolor Corporation for their work on the design and development of the Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry.\n\nIn 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to the development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.\n\nIn the 1950s, SRI worked under the direction of the Bank of America to develop ERMA (Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting), and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) which as of 2007 is still the industry standard in automated check processing.Fact|date=October 2007 The ERMA project was led by computer scientist Jerre Noe, who was at the time SRI's Assistant Director of Engineering.\n\n1960s\n\nDoug Engelbart was the primary force behind the design and development of the oN-Line System, or NLS. He founded SRI's Augmentation Research Center (ARC), and his team there developed the original versions of many modern computer-human interface elements. These included: bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, and precursors to the graphical user interface including the computer mouse. As a pioneer of human-computer interaction, Engelbart is arguably SRI's most notable alumnus. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 2000.\n\nIn 1964, Bill English, then chief engineer at the ARC, built the first prototype of a computer mouse from Engelbart's design. Originally they intended to call it a \"turtle,\" but when a mouse ran across their workbench they changed their minds Fact|date=March 2007.\n\nIn the 1960s, liquid crystal display (LCD) technology was developed at RCA Laboratories, which is now the Sarnoff Corporation, a wholly owned SRI subsidiary.\n\nFrom 1966 through 1972, SRI's Artificial Intelligence Center developed the first mobile robot to reason about its actions. Named \"Shakey\", the robot had a television camera, a triangulating range finder, and bump sensors. Shakey the Robot used software for perception, world-modeling, and acting. The Artificial Intelligence Center marked its 40th anniversary in 2006.\n\nHewitt Crane and his colleagues developed the world's first all-magnetic digital computer, [ [http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/allmagnetic-logic.html SRI Technology: All-Magnetic Logic ] ] , based upon extensions to magnetic core memories. The technology was licensed to AMP, who then used the technology to build specialized computers for controlling tracks in the New York City subway and on railroad switching yards.\n\nIn 1969, ARPANET, the world's first electronic computer network, was established on October 29 between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's lab at UCLA and Douglas Engelbart's lab at SRI. Interface Message Processors at both sites served as the backbone of the first Internet. [ [http://www.engineer.ucla.edu/stories/2004/Internet35.htm UCLA, Birthplace of the Internet, Holds Forum to Mark 35th Anniversary ] ]\n\nIn addition to SRI and UCLA, UCSB and the University of Utah were part of the original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire 4-node network was connected.\n\n1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, SRI developed other technologies, including packet-switched radio (precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, malaria treatments, vacuum microelectronics, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), and software-implemented fault tolerance.\n\nIn 1972, Dr. Harold E. Puthoff, then a researcher at SRI, put forth proposals to study quantum mechanics in life processes. This resulted in a series of studies in parapsychology, including the now controversial remote viewing programs that have been discontinued and partially declassified (see below).\n\nIn the late 1970s social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell created the Values and Lifestyles psychographic methodology (VALS) to explain changing US values and lifestyles. VALS was formally inaugurated as an SRI International product in 1978 and was later cited by \"Advertising Age\" as \"one of the ten top market research breakthroughs of the 1980s.\" [ [http://www.sric-bi.com/VALS/ Sric-Bi | Vals ] ]\n\n1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, SRI developed, among other things, Zylon, stealth technologies, improvements to ultrasound imaging, two-dimensional laser fluorescence imaging, a multimedia electronic mail system, intrusion detection expert systems, theory of non-interference in computer security, a multilevel secure (MLS) relational database system called Seaview, LaTeX [cite web\n\nbook\n\ncurly=yes\n\nlast=Lamport\n\nfirst=Leslie\n\ntitle=LaTeX: A Document Preparation System\n\nyear=1986\n\npublisher=Addison-Wesley\n\nisbn=0-201-15790-X\n\nurl=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#latex\n\naccessdate=2008-08-01] , and order-sorted algebra. On January 17, 1986, SRI.com became the 8th registered \".com\" domain .\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, SRI developed, among other things, ground- and foliage-penetrating radar, Open Agent Architecture (OAA), dry-powder drugs, remote surgery (aka telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, an easy-clean oven surface, the cancer drug Tirapazamine (now in clinical trials), ammonium dinitramide (ADN) - a novel environmentally benign oxidizer, network intrusion detection system, the Maude system (a declarative software language), the INCON and REDDE command and control system for the U.S. military, IGRS (integrated GPS radio system), an advanced military personnel and vehicle tracking system, natural language speech recognition, assisted hydrothermal oxidation for safe, cost-effective disposal of hazardous materials, an advanced letter sorting system for the United States Postal Service, PacketHop, a revolutionary peer-to-peer wireless technology to create scalable ad hoc networks, electroactive polymer aka “artificial muscle”, and several landmark education and economic studies.\n\n2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, SRI developed, among other things, new uses for diamagnetic levitation; the Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System (DFIRST), which uses GPS satellites, high-speed wireless communications, and digital terrain map displays to train armored combat units during battle exercises; live-virtual-constructive training systems for the California National Guard; Pathway Tools software, which aims to accelerate drug discovery by using artificial intelligence and symbolic computing techniques to analyze complex biological processes; BioCyc, SRI’s growing collection of genomic databases and software tools used by biologists to visualize genes within a chromosome, complete biochemical pathways, and the full metabolic maps of organisms; the advanced modular incoherent scatter radar (AMISR), a novel relocatable atmospheric research facility under construction for the National Science Foundation; the Centibots, one of the first and largest teams of coordinated, autonomous mobile robots that explore, map, and survey unknown environments; and speech recognition and translation functionality for the VoxTec Phraselator handheld speech translator, which has enabled U.S. soldiers overseas to communicate with local citizens in near real time. SRI researchers made the first observation of visible light emitted by oxygen atoms in the night-side airglow of Venus, offering new insight into the planet’s atmosphere. SRI education researchers conducted the first national evaluation of the growing U.S. charter schools movement. For the World Golf Foundation, SRI compiled the first-ever estimate of the overall scope of the U.S. golf industry’s goods and services ($62 billion in 2000), providing a framework for monitoring the long-term growth of the industry.\n\nIn 2006, SRI was awarded a $56.9 million contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to provide preclinical services for the development of drugs and antibodies for anti-infective treatments for avian influenza, SARS, West Nile virus, hepatitis, and more.\n\nAlso in 2006, SRI announced it has selected St. Petersburg, Florida as the site for a new marine technology research facility. The new facility will be called SRI-St. Petersburg and aims to accelerate research and development of technologies related to ocean science, the maritime industry and port security. SRI's expansion into Florida is a collaboration with the University of South Florida College of Marine Science and its Center for Ocean Technology, and is supported by the City of St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, and the state of Florida.\n\nSRI celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006.\n\nResearch outside of the mainstream\n\nClairvoyance and ESP\n\nIn 1972, Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the \"viewers\" or \"percipients\") could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or \"targets\". In the early studies, a human \"sender\" was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term remote viewing was coined to describe this overall process."
