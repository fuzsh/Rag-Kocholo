        "text": "This volume explores Italian science fiction from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first, covering literary texts, films, music, and visual works by figures as diverse as Maria Rosa Cutrufelli, Peter Kolosimo, Primo Levi, Antonio Margheriti, Gilda Musa, and Roberto Vacca. It broadens the horizons of both Italian studies and the environmental humanities by addressing a long-neglected genre, and expands understanding of relations between the ecological, the imaginary, and the sociopolitical. The chapters draw on a variety of methodological frameworks, including animal studies, ecocriticism, ecofeminism, eco-media studies, energy humanities, and posthumanism. There is a wealth of insights regarding topics such as anthropocentrism/speciesism, ecomodernist thought, environmental justice struggles at the planetary and regional level, non-human and new materialist ontologies, utopian/dystopian philosophies, and prospects for transitioning beyond the crisis of petromodernity through the construction of post-depletion futures.\n\nIn his 1990 book Toward a Transpersonal Ecology, developing a new foundation for environmental philosophy, Warwick Fox proposed to consider self in an expansive sense through a process of identification with the environment. The shift between an anthropocentric to an ecocentric perspective referred to a psychologization of ecophilosophy. In this sense, the so called “deep ecology” (Næss, 1973) identifies an egalitarian and holistic concept of the world based on the recognition of the equal intrinsic dignity of all biota as well as of their ecological interconnectedness and interdependence. Reconsidering these theoretical premises, my first claim will be that the notion of the film world allows us to identify the basis on which an ecophilosophical study of film can be carried out. How can a film world identify an environmental philosophy? How can it suggest an ecocentric perspective? Moving from the theses of the film as philosophy, this paper will focus on the cinematic representation of the relationship between human and nonhuman and, in particular, on the expression of ecophilosophy in contemporary Italian cinema. The analysis of some movies, such as Bella e perduta (Marcello, 2015) and Spira Mirabilis (D'Anolfi and Parenti, 2016), will be proposed in order to identify the key aspects of a film ecophilosophy for which the film world represents the hermeneutic horizon through which filmgoers can reflect on their own identity and role within the ecosystem.\n\nThis is my proposal for a book on Cinema, and Italian Cinema in particular. It will be the first to study this art of the 20th century from an Ecosexual perspective, and with an emphasis on practices of ecosexual love that are fluid and inclusive. Two important tropes in the approach are Gaia theory and Deleuze's philosophy of Cinema. Are you interested in Cinema? Are you interested in ecology? Are you interested in sexuality? Are you interested in the Ecosexual Movement? Are you interested in Deleuze's ideas? In Gaia theory? If any or all of these apply to you, then please join the session. I am open to responses, comments, suggestions about the proposal. Thank you!\n\nThe Italian film I dannati della terra (The Damned of the Earth) (Orsini and Filippi 1968) is a prominent example of the connection between the European cinema of intervention and the Third World struggles of the 1960s. Set as a 'film within a film', the movie tells the story of a leftist filmmaker, Fausto Morelli, who faces the challenge of finishing a film about the liberation struggles of sub-Saharan Africa by building on the documentary footage that was bequeathed to him by his student and friend, the young Abramo Malonga, an African (Bantu). This article recovers overlooked and little-known documents about the film to show that it is the expression of an active cinematic Third Worldism forged in previous years between the legacy of the Resistenza Partigiana (Italian Resistance) and the Third World struggles of the 1960s. At the same time, the article analyses the ways in which the film 'dialogues' with experimental trends of the contemporary avantgarde artistic scene in order to challenge the viewer to debate the 'open ideological hypothesis' of the film and take an active part in the political struggles of the time.\n\nAs humans re-negotiate their boundaries with the nonhuman world of animals, inanimate entities and technological artefacts, new identities are formed and a new epistemological and ethical approach to reality is needed. Through twelve thought-provoking, scholarly essays, this volume analyzes works by a range of modern and contemporary Italian authors, from Giacomo Leopardi to Elena Ferrante, who have captured the shift from anthropocentrism and postmodernism to posthumanism. Indeed, this is the first academic volume investigating narrative configurations of posthuman identity in Italian literature and film."
