        "text": "Madrid in the 1950s. The cruel tale of a misunderstood old man who wants to buy an electric scooter for hanging around with his disabled friends. But he appears to be too healthy for that option, so his doctor and kids try to convince him to give up the whimsical idea. How far will he go? Starring the famous comic actor José Isbert, The Little Coach is Ferreri’s third feature, and the last he directed under the Franco regime in Spain. The film established young Ferreri as a European master of black humor, but issues with the Spanish regime’s censorship forced him to flee back to his native Italy.\n\nFor $30, receive one ticket to a film in Marco Ferreri: Beyond the Absurd and a select menu item at Café Paradiso, located in FLC’s Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center.
