        "text": "The proposed stroller standard incorporates the published voluntary ASTM F833-13 standard, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Carriages and Strollers, with one modification. The modification would require the addition of language in the standard to address scissoring, shearing, and pinching hazards associated with folding or foldable strollers.\n\nCPSC staff reviewed more than 1,200 stroller-related incidents, including four fatalities and nearly 360 injuries that occurred from 2008 through 2012. Staff believes that the published standard, with the proposed addition in the NPR, will help to reduce the risks associated with the majority of the hazard patterns identified in reviewing the stroller incidents.\n\nHazard patterns found in strollers include:\n\nwheel breakage and detachment;\n\nparking brake and lock mechanism failures;\n\nhinge issues;\n\nstructural integrity issues;\n\nentrapment;\n\ncar seat attachment;\n\ncanopy issues; and\n\nhandlebar failures.\n\nReported injuries include:\n\nfinger amputations on folding hinges and canopy hinges;\n\nfalls due to wheel detachment or parking brake issues;\n\ninjuries due to stroller collapse;\n\nhead entrapment in openings of travel systems; and\n\nfalls due to a child unbuckling the restraint harnesses.\n\nThe proposed rule would also help address finger injuries associated with the folding hinges on folding or foldable strollers. Various stroller types, such as travel systems, carriages, tandem, side-by-side, multi-occupant, and jogging strollers would be covered by the standard.\n\nStaff recommends that the mandatory standard for strollers become effective 18 months following publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.\n\nThe proposed rule has a 75-day public comment period. Comments can be posted directly on Regulations.gov."
