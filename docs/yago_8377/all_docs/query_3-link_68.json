        "text": "Sale\n\nÂ£3.99\n\n| /\n\nAvailability: Instant delivery\n\nJuan Tamariz is a one-of -a-kind performer. A household name in his native Spain , he is one of the most unique and talented performers ever to grace our art. In the tradition of Vernon and Slydini he has blazed his own enchanted trail. His books on magic are required reading for any thinking student of magic. His repertoire is vast as well as legendary; he once performed for 74 weeks in a row on television. He is in constant demand and is often mobbed on the streets of Madrid by adoring fans. He is one of those especial performers that takes the spectators on a wonderful journey - a magical journey through the heart as well as the mind.\n\nJuan is the consummate performer. Armed with only a deck of cards he can entertain a small group or a packed auditorium for hours. He is hilariously funny, but at the same time he'll fool you like you've never been fooled before. He is one of magic's greatest thinkers, a master of misdirection and a magic philosophy, and he has never had a large body of material recorded... until now!\n\nEffects Included:\n\nEl Cochecito: As performed by Juan on The World's Greatest magic Television Special! This is the real work on magic and emotion- taking the audience back to childhood, capturing their imagination and sense of wonder through the use of a simple toy car. This is a prime example of how to take an innocent prop and turn it into a magical showpiece!"
