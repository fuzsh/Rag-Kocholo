The film was a huge flop when it was released in Spain, but nowadays is a cult classic. The film had troubles with Spanish censorship, that forced to change and cut the original ending.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDon Anselmo Proharán (José Isbert) is an old man totally determined to acquire an invalid stroller with a motor, just like the one his friend Lucas and other companions his age have. Despite the opposition of his entire family, Don Anselmo does not give up on his whim, even if to achieve it he is forced to sell the family jewels. When his son Carlos finds out, he forces her to return it. In revenge, Don Anselmo makes the decision to poison his family. When he tries to flee in his stroller, however, he is eventually detained by the Civil Guard.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
