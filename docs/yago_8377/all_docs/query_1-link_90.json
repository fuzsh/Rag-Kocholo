        "text": "The initial flowering of cinema\n\nin Spain at the beginning of the 20th century occurred in much the\n\nsame way as in the rest of Europe. Spanish moviemakers grappled\n\nwith the challenge of learning to harness cinema’s artistic and\n\ncommercial potential as an international art, while at the same\n\ntime using the medium as a reflection of their own national culture.\n\nFor a good deal of its history, Spanish film, like the country itself,\n\nwas caught between a conservative take on the world and a more liberated,\n\ninternationalist view of culture and identity.\n\nIt’s said that the first movie shot in Spain was\n\nEduardo Jimeno’s People Coming out of the Noontime Mass at the\n\nCathedral of the Virgin of Pilar in Zaragoza (1897), which was\n\nfollowed by a series of shorts done in the same spirit by the Lumiere\n\nbrothers’ cameraman, Alexandre Promio. The first actual fiction\n\nfilm made in Spain—written, directed, produced and performed by\n\nSpanish film pioneer Fructuoso Gelabert—was Café Brawl (1897). Barcelona was the center of Spanish moviemaking up until\n\n1915; in addition to Gelabert, Segundo de Chomón was busy\n\nduring those early days making a series of special effects pictures\n\nthat led up to his spectacular fantasy film, The Electric Hotel (1905). Though Barcelona remained a center of production for\n\nthe next 20 years, Madrid began to siphon off a large chunk of that\n\nactivity, beginning when Benito Perojo and his brother, José,\n\nset up shop in the city.\n\nContent in these early movies reflected local Spanish\n\ncultural tastes faithfully. Documentaries about bullfighting were\n\npopular, as were adaptations of 19th century romantic plays, a trend\n\ntouched off by Ricardo de Baños’ 1908 version of Don Juan\n\nTenorio.\n\nIn the 1920s, Spanish literature became a rich source\n\nof material for local moviemakers, with artists like Jacinto Benavente,\n\nJosé Buchs and Florián Rey all turning out successful\n\nbig-screen adaptations. A hit adaptation of Carlos Arniches’ popular That’s My Man, directed by Carlos Fernández Cuenca\n\nin 1927, set the tone for many movies that followed. Arniches’ theater\n\nwas a prime source of material for many of the pictures produced\n\njust prior to the Civil War. His ability to bring to life the world\n\nof working-class Madrid, and his mastery of their vernacular, were\n\na key part of his work’s appeal.\n\nThe Spanish film industry was producing about 60\n\npictures a year at this point, but the advent of talking films soon\n\ncut into this rapid pace. It was during this time that Luis Buñuel\n\nand Salvador Dali’s surrealist short The Andalusian Dog (1928)\n\nwas screened in Paris, launching Buñuel’s notorious film\n\ncareer. For many people outside of Spain (particularly cinephiles)\n\nBuñuel, like Pedro Almodóvar today, came to represent\n\nSpanish cinema at its most irreverent, eclectic best.\n\nFrancisco Elías’ The Mystery of the Puerta\n\nde Sol (1929) was the first sound picture produced in Spain.\n\nBut while American and other European moviemakers made significant\n\nleaps in sound technology, Spanish films continued to be conceived\n\nas silent works, with synchronized sound added after the fact. It\n\nwas Hollywood that gave Spanish audiences their first good sound\n\nfilms, determined to keep their grip on international markets. Spanish\n\ncasts and crews were assembled in Hollywood to remake English-language\n\nfilms, using the same sets but with Spanish script translations.\n\nThe technical quality of these pictures surpassed anything coming\n\nout of Spain, even though the content wasn’t always specifically\n\nSpanish in origin. Given the poor infrastructure for moviemaking\n\nin Spain at the time, a significant number of film professionals\n\nmigrated to Hollywood and Paris. By 1931, the production of Spanish-language\n\nfilms produced outside of Spain actually dominated the Spanish\n\nmarket itself.\n\nIn 1931, Spanish and Latin American film professionals\n\ngot together in an effort to create a united front and lobby for\n\ngovernment protection of their industry. No tangible results were\n\nproduced. Then, in 1932, the first sound studio in Spain, Orphea\n\nStudios, was set up in Barcelona. The following year, Cinematographia\n\nEspañola Americana (CEA), a Madrid-based sound studio, went\n\ninto action, along with Estudios Cinema Español S.A. (ECESA)\n\nin Aranjuez, just outside the capital. These new Spanish ‘majors’\n\nwere able to turn out some quality films, but nothing on the scale\n\nthat Hollywood could generate. Still, with the addition of 14 smaller\n\nstudios over the next two years, it was possible to declare a boom\n\nin Spanish cinema by 1935—aided by a high level of support from\n\nSpanish audiences.\n\nWhile a lot of the material produced at this time\n\nwas more or less escapist fare, companies like Compania Industrial\n\nFilm Español S.A. (CIFESA) and Filmófono went beyond\n\nthis trend to create pictures that were both commercially successful\n\nand artistically distinct. CIFESA’s early hits included Rey’s Mama’s\n\nSuitor (1934) and Benito Perojo’s On the Road to Cairo (1935).\n\nSignificantly, Buñuel was hired to manage and participate\n\nin all aspects of Filmófono’s activities (including directing\n\nprojects himself under other directors’ names). But Spain was still\n\na conservative country, and most pictures reflected the traditional\n\nvalues of investors.\n\nPopular hits of the day revealed that audiences continued\n\nto like material that captured the urban milieu. Still, a bit of\n\nsocial criticism did show up in Spanish cinema of the day, with\n\nfilms like Madrid se Divorcia (1934) and Who Loves Me?\n\n(1936). Fernando Roldán’s Fermin Galán (1931)\n\nwas clearly created to justify the existence of the Second Republic,\n\nwhich would soon come to an end with the arrival of the Spanish\n\nCivil War in 1936.\n\nThe period just prior to the war was indeed a golden\n\nage of Spanish cinema, and for some, a golden age of Spanish culture\n\nin general. Spanish cinema had a strong domestic following, which\n\nit managed to achieve despite strong pressures from Hollywood and\n\nthe total absence of subsidies from the government. The early to\n\nmid-1930s were also a time in which homegrown film stars such as\n\nMiguel Ligero, Manuel Luna, Rosita Díaz Gimeno and Antoñita\n\nColomé captured the national imagination. Years later, Spanish\n\ndirector Fernando Trueba would put his own nostalgic spin on this\n\nbeautiful time with his Oscar-winning Belle Époque (1992).\n\nThe great gains made by the industry by the mid 1930s\n\nwere effectively halted (and in some cases reversed) by the commencement\n\nand eventual outcome of the Civil War, which saw a victory for General\n\nFranco’s nationalist forces, who were allied with Nazi Germany.\n\nDuring the conflict, many productions were halted and moviemakers\n\non both sides of the conflict found themselves cut off from large\n\nchunks of their audience—as well as their collaborators, many of\n\nwhom died in the conflict or went into exile. While some of the\n\npictures that managed to reach completion by 1936 (such as Rey’s Morena Clara) did find commercial success on both sides of\n\nthe divide, right up until the end of the War, there was little\n\nroom for a liberated, creative cinema in Franco’s Spain.\n\nWith Franco’s government came increased censorship,\n\ngovernment subsidies, classifications and ideological pressures\n\naimed at steering content in a direction that would please the state’s\n\nhighly reactionary agenda. It wasn’t long before moviemakers were\n\neffectively policing themselves. Ironically, the government’s edict\n\nrequiring Spanish as the only language allowed on national screens\n\nhad the unforeseen consequence of placing foreign films on an equal\n\nfooting with Spanish product since all films, regardless of their\n\norigin, had to be spoken in Spanish. Soon, better-made foreign films\n\nwere gaining a solid base in the Spanish market.\n\nAlthough cinema after the Civil War carried forward\n\nmany of the themes and trends previously familiar to audiences,\n\nmore films showed up which exalted the values and pretensions of\n\nthe new order. Juan de Orduña’s Follow the Legion (1942) and Antonio Román’s Martyrs of the\n\nPhilippines (1945) both glorified the honor of fighting and\n\ndying for the cause. The most significant picture of this ilk was Raza (1942), scripted by Franco himself under a pseudonym.\n\nIt managed to succeed by couching the values of the nationalists\n\ninside a highly melodramatic plot featuring chaste love between\n\ntwo romantic leads. The picture underscored Franco’s fetish for\n\nheroic death, and his vision of the traditional Spanish family as\n\nthe ideal mechanism for producing ‘good’ Spaniards.\n\nThe regime’s idealization of a supposedly glorious\n\npast spawned a string of opulent costume dramas such as Manuel Augusto\n\nGarcía Viñola’s Inês de Castro (1944),\n\nJosé López Rubio’s Eugenia de Montijo (1944)\n\nand two major pictures of the period, de Orduña’s Love\n\nCrazy (1948) and Agustina of Aragón (1950), both\n\nproducts of CIFESA. A steady crop of religious-themed films was\n\nalso churned out around the same time, with titles like The Saintly\n\nQueen (1947) and Loyola, the Soldier Saint (1948). The\n\nhunger for a mix of melodrama and eroticism was satisfied by a number\n\nof costume dramas, done in the spirit of the escapist novela\n\nrosa, or pink novels. Movies like José Luis Sáenz\n\nde Heredia’s The Scandal (1943) and Rafael Gil’s The Prodigal\n\nDaughter (1946) were popular examples. Up until its fall in\n\nthe mid-1950s, CIFESA (often compared to MGM because of its penchant\n\nfor lavish costume dramas) became the quasi-official studio of Franco’s\n\ngovernment, rolling out film after film that reflected the regime’s\n\ntastes and thematic obsessions.\n\nIn the 1950s, there were rumblings for modernization\n\nand liberalization in Spain, as many people compared the country\n\nunfavorably to a more modern and dynamic Europe. The government\n\nresponded with a few cosmetic changes, allowing the publication\n\nof dissident film journals that advocated a cinema that was more\n\nconnected to the everyday realities of Spanish life. Ironically,\n\nthe formulation of a community of moviemakers with a desire for\n\nreal change was formed at the National Film School, a government\n\ninstitution. Luis García Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem\n\nwere principal figures in this group, inspired in part by the Italian\n\nschool of Neorealism. The Bardem-Berlanga collaboration That\n\nHappy Pair (1953) was an early example of where this influence\n\nwas showing up. The films of Marco Ferreri and Rafael Azcona—El\n\nPisito (1959) and El Cochecito (1960)—were good examples\n\nof the cinema of dissidence, as was Carlos Saura’s The Delinquents (1962). Saura would go on to have one of the most prestigious careers\n\nin Spanish cinema, a career that continues today with pictures like Tango (1998).\n\nMany innovative moviemakers like Saura got their\n\nstart just as the state was trying to put a liberal face on country.\n\nGovernment-sponsored support for new talent, offered under the guise\n\nof a program called New Spanish Cinema helped usher in some highly\n\noriginal films, including critical and commercial successes like\n\nMiguel Picazo’s Aunt Tula (1964) and Mario Camus’ With\n\nthe East Wind (1967).\n\nOver the next 10 years, along with all the pulp fare\n\nthat had always been a staple of the country’s cinema, moviemakers\n\nlike Saura and Víctor Erice developed a talent for allegory\n\nthat helped them get around continued government censorship. True\n\nliberalization of culture didn’t come until Franco’s death in 1975\n\nand the subsequent transition to democracy, ushering in mavericks\n\nlike Pedro Almodóvar (the poster child of ‘liberated’ Spain),\n\nJ.J. Bigas Luna (Jamón, Jamón), Vicente Aranda\n\n(Mad Love) and Fernando Trueba (Calle 54). With them\n\ncame a generation of new Spanish stars including Victoria Abril,\n\nCarmen Maura, Antonio Banderas and Penélope Cruz.\n\nIf the democratic era can be faulted for anything,\n\nit would be the government’s tendency to subsidize serious films\n\nover populist cinema, leading to the production of 20 bad films\n\nfor every good one. Throughout the 1990s, Spanish moviemakers lost\n\nmarket share at home to foreign (mostly Hollywood) competitors.\n\nBut this is changing. A second front of gifted moviemakers, personified\n\nby such directors as Alejandro Amenábar, Julio Medem and\n\nÁlex de la Iglesia, seems even less interested in pursuing\n\nrespectable obscurity than their predecessors. Instead, they have\n\nchosen to embrace many of the strengths of commercial narrative\n\nmoviemaking, while maintaining a refreshing degree of individuality\n\nand personal authorship.\n\nFor Pedro Almodóvar, the level of personal\n\nauthorship enjoyed by Spanish moviemakers would not be possible\n\nwithin the mainstream. “By definition, mainstream cinema avoids\n\nanything that is personal, anything that might remind us of our\n\nhuman nature. What is it that makes Spanish cinema ‘Spanish’? First\n\nof all, it is the absolute freedom to write, produce or direct anything\n\nyou want. Secondly, we have no film industry—or what we have is very small. That means we have to make less compromises for\n\nmoney than big-budget films. The director’s criteria are the only\n\nones that matter. There aren’t hundreds of agents with their respective\n\nstars telling you what you can and can’t do. There is no producer\n\ndemanding that you cut the running time by 20 minutes, or the producer\n\njust doing it himself without even telling you. There aren’t 10\n\npeople from the production company going over your script with a\n\nmagnifying glass and cutting out anything original, because it doesn’t\n\nremind them of any other film or because it’s just too dark. We\n\ndon’t have the shadow of the MPAA hanging over our heads like a\n\nphantom menace. When we write a script we don’t have to worry about\n\nhow many times the word ‘fuck’ appears. This doesn’t mean that all\n\nSpanish films are art, but it does show that films like The Spirit\n\nof the Beehive would be completely impossible with the prevailing\n\nmainstream climate.”\n\nAmenábar’s Open Your Eyes (1997) and\n\nImanol Uribe’s Running Out of Time are two films that show\n\na basic alignment with modern commercial sensibilities. Though shot\n\nin English, Amenábar’s The Others, starring Nicole\n\nKidman, was made with Spanish money and went on to be honored with\n\neight Goya Awards. Though thoroughly contemporary, the film reveals\n\na taste for a secular mysticism, which has its spiritual antecedents\n\nin the history of Spanish cinema. The work of Julio Medem, one of\n\nthe most thrilling new Spanish directors at work today, carries\n\nwith it this spirit of existential inquiry, wrapped in the form\n\nof an often playful, searching narrative."
