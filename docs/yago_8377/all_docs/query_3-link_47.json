However, the film is in fact not recognized for its message but for the stupid censorship it had to endure. To avoid giving away too many spoilers, let's just say that the actual ending of this black comedy is very dark and somewhat perverse, so much so that it was originally removed and…\n\nAlthough the plot synopsis might read like an entrant for the modern day sackcloth-and-ashes race, this early bit of Marco Ferreri scabrousness is less about patronising the marginal as needling those who have the luxury to think about it.\n\nIt's a typically mordant setting for this director/co-writer, with the burden of Franco-ist censorship forcing creative decisions lacking in some of the later, lascivious satires.\n\nAlthough the story of acquisitiveness being insufficient capital to buy the fellowship of disabled-scooter drivers is meaty enough - the film still censored for its troubles - most of the telling detail is in the margins: the Guardia Civil lampooned as men marching with mops for guns and toilet bowls for the tricornio hat, and so on.…\n\n☆\"Old folks are like children.

Absolute legend.\n\nWhat a strange and surprisingly thought-provoking film, the Spanish cult classic El Cochecito [\"The Wheelchair\"], directed by the Italian filmmaker Marco Ferreri. Only recently has the original controversial ending been restored, as the director intended, for this FIPRESCI Prize winner. With a reframing of mobility and confinement, this new focus on disability looks at the titular vehicle as one of independence, this strikingly modern take and subversive look at \"disability privilege\" feels like it was made 13 years ago, not 63.…"
