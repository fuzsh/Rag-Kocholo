Although shelter conditions have improved, shelter management and administration still require support. Humanitarian organizations report between 38 and 44 shelters, both official and unofficial.\n\nActions are shifting from response to early recovery. Authorities are considering transferring some of the emergency shelters to spaces that have been identified for the construction of single-family transition shelters (ATUS). Discussion continues on the criteria for selecting people to move, details of the relocation plan for those in shelters run by the Social Work Secretariat of the President's Wife (SOSEP) and unofficial and self-hosted shelters (around 3,000 people). The lack of access to information and the absence of participation in these processes is generating uncertainty among the sheltered.\n\nThe World Food Program (WFP), in consultation with authorities, carried out a multi-sectoral evaluation of affected communities in Escuintla, Chimaltenango and Sacatepéquez from 20-22 June. At the time of the evaluation, the communities were receiving humanitarian assistance from private individuals and municipal authorities, albeit incomplete assistance that lacked proper focus or defined timelines. There are communities that remain isolated or with very limited access due to damage to infrastructure caused by lahars.\n\nAccess to affected communities is limited to a few hours a day due to early afternoon rainfall that can cause lahars and flooding of local rivers. Should the seasonal rains persist, steady access to affected communities could be greatly jeopardized. Community members indicate that their main requirements are food and cash to cover basic needs for the next 9 to 12 months. Given the loss of income due to the lack of demand for labor, the cost of basic grains makes it impossible for some households to acquire them. Children under 2 years old are not receiving adequate food for their age.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA), with the support of technical teams of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), carried out the evaluation of loss perception in the agricultural sector caused by falling ash and sand in communities of the three affected departments. The main results found that 16,932 small-scale farmers were affected by falling ash and sand, with 13,611 hectares of crops affected, incurring an estimated cumulative economic loss of US$12,299,701. The crops that suffered damage in order of importance were: corn, vegetables and fruit trees. People who grow vegetables and fruits at a commercial level have reduced the hiring of labor by 75 per cent."
