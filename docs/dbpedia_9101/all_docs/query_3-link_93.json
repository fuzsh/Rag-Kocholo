        "text": "edit\n\nBrief History\n\nThe first evidence of human settlers in Guatemala goes back to at least 12,000 BC. There is evidence that may put this date as early as 18,000 BC, such as obsidian arrow heads found in various parts of the country\n\nGuatemala is the centre of the Mayan World. This ancient civilization was the most advanced in pre-Colombian America. The knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, medicine, agriculture, and architecture was superior. The Mayan civilization dominated the region for nearly 2,000 years before the Spanish arrived in the early 16th century. During that time, Guatemala experienced a remarkable cultural development that few places in the continent had. In 1821, Guatemala and Central America declared their independence from Spain, but it wasn’t until the 21st. of March 1847, that the Republic was officially proclaimed, separating itself from the rest of Central America.\n\nGuatemala's \"Liberal Revolution\" came in 1871 under the leadership of Justo Rufino Barrios, who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala. From 1898 to 1920, Guatemala was ruled by the dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera.\n\nFrom 1985, Guatemala has begun a new process in its history, directed to peace and democracy. The nation has been stable since 1996 and has been in a state of continuous development and economic growth. Since the peace accords, Guatemala has witnessed successive democratic elections, most recently in 2007.\n\nedit\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nThe indigenous culture in Guatemala is considered the strongest in Central America, particularly in the central and western highlands of Guatemala. The largest of the indigenous groups are the Maya, with 21 different groups making up over half the countries population.\n\nUnique among many indigenous peoples in Central America, the Maya maintained a hold onto many aspects of their identity throughout Spanish colonial rule and as such many of their customs, textiles, social structure and beliefs are still in practice. Each region may have it's own language, and history, often with different villages in the same region having their own unique customs, traditions and beliefs. Similarly, the most striking symbol of Mayan identity is the traditional dress, though today it is mostly only women and girls who do so. Predominantly, the huipil, a short tunic often tucked into a long skirt, is a means of identifying history of the wearer, with each village often having it's own intricately designed patterns and colour schemes.\n\nMany Mayan communities suffered terribly during the war that gripped Guatemala for over 35 years, with traditions and religious beliefs playing a very complex role in their persecution. Therefore, many visitors to communities away from large tourist areas may find the Maya to be very reserved, especially when it comes to their traditional customs. However, patience and honesty can often reward you in the most unexpected ways.\n\nMost Mayan families rely on farming as the primary source of food and/or income, with corn and black beans being the dominant crops that form the staple part of their diet. A primary tool within the corn harvest is the machete, which is often carried everywhere by Mayan men. At first this can be an alarming sight but is soon experienced as being a normal part of daily life.\n\nAs within many cultures, photography is a sensitive issue. In areas where tourism is common place permission from whomever you are photographing may not be such an issue unless it is a child, in more remote areas always seek permission before taking a photograph.\n\nedit\n\nGeography\n\nGuatemala borders Honduras and El Salvador to the (south)east, Mexico to the north and northwest and Belize to the north/northeast. It also borders both the Caribbean Sea as well as the Pacific Ocean. Guatemala is a mountainous country, except for the souther coastal area and the vast northern lowlands of Petén department. Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing the country into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains; and the Petén region, north of the mountains. Volcan Tajumulco is the highest mountain in the country and of all of Central America, at 4,220 metres above sea level. Guatemala enjoys a rich biodiversity, with lakes, rivers, swamps, rainforests and mangrove areas all adding to the abudant flora and fauna. The rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico drainage basins, which include the Polochic and Dulce Rivers, which drain into Lake Izabal, the Motagua River, the Sarstún that forms the boundary with Belize, and the Usumacinta River, which forms the boundary between Petén and Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nedit\n\nWeather\n\nFrom November to April Guatemala has the dry season, which is a good time to enjoy Central America. That said, rivers, waterfalls and nature in general is much more beautiful during rainy season from May to October. Although much of the country has high temperatures of around 30 °C during the day and around 20 °C at night, there are some regional differences which mainly have to do with the altitude. The Pacific coastline in general is warmer, while more inland temperatures can drop below zero at night.\n\nedit\n\nGetting there\n\nPlane\n\nLa Aurora International Airport (GUA) near Guatemala City is where most international flights depart and arrive. Grupo TACA has flights to Cancun, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, New York, San José in Costa Rica San Pedro Sula in Honduras San Salvador, Tegucigalpa and Washington. Several other destinations are mostly within Central America or the United States, but Iberia has direct flights to and from Madrid.\n\nBy Train\n\nThere is no scheduled passenger train to and from Guatemala although there is a line to Mexico and one to El Salvador used by freight trains and chartered for tours as well.\n\nBy Car\n\nThe Pan-American Highway runs through Guatemala from Mexico in the north and El Salvador in the south and even access from Belize via Flores is possible.\n\nBy Bus\n\nTica Bus is a major operator in Central America, with connections to and from Guatemala from all neighbouring countries, including direct services from El Salvador. There are also buses to and from Mexico and Honduras, less so from Belize.\n\nTravel times from Guatemala City are around 6 hours to San Salvador in El Salvador and San Pedro Sula in Honduras. There is only one land connection to Belize, just west of San Ignacio, on the road to Tikal/Flores. Another big operator is King Quality, which travels on the San José de Costa Rica - Tapachula (Mexico) route, with buses between the capitals of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nBy Boat\n\nThere are ferries between Livingston and Puerto Barrios in Guatemala to several places in southern Belize, like Punta Gorda. Services from Puerto Barrios tend to be more frequent, with daily connections in both directions. Services from Livingston are mostly twice a week to/from Punta Gorda, on Tuesdays and Fridays for about $17.\n\nRequeña’s Charter Service & Watertaxi operates a watertaxi, “Mariestela”, between Punta Gorda and Puerto Barrios. It departs Punta Gorda daily at 9:00am from the Municipal pier near the Customs & Immigration Office. It departs Puerto Barrios daily at 2:00pm from the pier near the Shell gas station. It takes about 1 to 1.5 hours and costs BZ$40.00 each way (about US$20). Check the Belizenet Requena website.\n\nOther options include the Pichilingo, departing Puerto Barrios daily at 10:00am and departing Punta Gorda daily at 2:00pm. Duration is about 1 hour and costs BZ$50.00 each way (about US$25). Or take the Marisol departing Puerto Barrios daily at 1:00pm and Punta Gorda daily at 4:00pm. Same duration and costs. For up to date information check the following website.\n\nThere's also a boat from Lívingston to Omoa in Honduras, which usually goes daily.\n\nedit\n\nGetting around\n\nBy Plane\n\nTransportes Aereos Guatemaltecos has several domestic flights, from Guatemala City to Flores and charters to a few other destinations, like Zacapa and Puerto Barrios.\n\nBy Car\n\nBoth international and local agencies have cars for rent in Guatemala City, but it is not really recommended. Roads are not always in a good conditions and two thirds of the roads are not passable after very heavy rains. To add, there is possible danger of car jackings or robbery along roads, especially at night.\n\nBy Bus\n\nThe bus companies which use tourist buses called pullman are the most comfortable means of transportation. For a cheap, daring, adventurous trip take the chicken buses or polleros. These are the refurbished old school buses brought down from the United States. They get packed to the brim with passengers and the rides can be bumpy. But they are the only access to some places that have curvy two-lane mountainous roads. There are smaller buses or vans that are more comfortable but also work as local buses and have many stops before your final destination. Most are safe, cheap and honest and the Guatemalans help travellers get to their next spots safely. Both the larger chicken buses and smaller vans will originate from a central bus station (in larger towns) or the town/village square. Finding the correct one is easy as they will have their destination displayed in large colourful letters on the front, and the ayudantes (assistants - like a conductor) will be shouting the destination repetitively.\n\nLitegua has connections between Guatemala City, Rio Dulce, Morales, Puerto Barrios and many other towns and cities. Schedules for buses and boats in Guatemala are listed at thebusschedule.com.\n\nIn the Guatemala city there are yellow taxis with meters, and there are other taxis without meters. Be sure to ask the driver before getting in what the price will be, if you don't agree then you can bargain down or refuse the ride if you think it is a bad price.\n\nBy Boat\n\nLivingston and some national parks are only accessible by boat and river trips, such as the Rio Dulce, can be great experiences, especially if you combine tours and public transport. It's also possible to hop on regular passenger services on jungle rivers in the north and on Lake Atitlán.\n\nBetween October and May cruises depart from Santo Tomas de Castilla to nearby destinations in Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, before returning to their original departure sites. Most cruises also offer onshore excursions like touring the towns along the coast of Guatemala, a trip to the city of Antigua, visiting the Mayan ruins at Tikal and so forth.\n\nedit\n\nRed Tape\n\nThe following nationalities do not need a visa to visit Guatemala: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United States, United Kingdom, Vatican City, Venezuela.\n\nValid passports are required of everyone except citizens of the following Central American countries: Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador. There is a treaty of free movement between those countries, similar to the Schengen agreement in Europe.\n\nProof of onward travel is often required by airlines however rarely checked by officials to gain a visa when flying into Guatemala.\n\nedit\n\nMoney\n\nSee also Money Matters\n\nThe quetzal (code: GTQ) is the currency of Guatemala. It is divided into 100 centavos.\n\nCoins include 1 centavo, 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos, 1 quetzal.\n\nBanknotes come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 quetzales.\n\nedit\n\nWork\n\nIf you want to volunteer your time and skills within Guatemala, Entre Mundos, based in Quetzaltenango, is a good place to start. They basically act as a go between for NGOs & charities and eager volunteers.\n\nedit\n\nLanguage\n\nRelated article: Spanish: Grammar, pronunciation and useful phrases\n\nSpanish is the official language of Guatemala, although it is not used everywhere among the country's indigenous population, even as a second language. Alltogehter, Guatemala has 23 languages, though not all of them are regarded as national languages. For the Garifuna people in Livingston, Garifuna and English are the main languages (but Spanish is spoken as well).\n\nedit\n\nEat\n\nAlmost every town square will have a variety of street vendors offering a variety of food and drink. Look for the busiest ones (usually the cleanest) and you'll be rewarded with some very tasty and cheap delights. Mini-tacos, tamale (a starchy cake with a savory filling wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed), atole (a thick drink made from corn, can be sweet or sour), as well as fried beans and tortillas are a few examples to look out for.\n\nedit\n\nDrink\n\nPopular Guatemalan beers are Gallo (lager, by far the most popular with Guatemalans), Victoria, Brahva (a light pilsner style), Moza (dark bock), Cabro, Monte Carlo (premium), and Dorada. Guatemala produces a number of rums, including the superb Ron Zacapa Centenario which is aged up to 30 years. Tequila is a very popular drink in Guatemala.\n\nedit\n\nHealth\n\nSee also Travel Health\n\nThere are no vaccinations legally required to travel to Guatemala. There is one exception though. You need a yellow fever vaccination if you have travelled to a country (7 days or less before entering Guatemala) where that disease is widely prevalent.\n\nIt's a good thing to get your vaccinations in order before travelling to Guatemala. The general vaccination against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Polio (DTP) is recommended. Also a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended and vaccination against hepatitis B, tuberculosis, rabies and typhoid are also sometimes recommended for stays longer than 3 months.\n\nMalaria is prevalent in the country and it is recommended to take malaria pills and take other normal anti-mosquito precautions as well. Dengue sometimes occurs as well. There is no vaccination, so buy mosquito repellent (preferably with 50% DEET), and sleep under a net. Also wear long sleeves if possible.\n\nFinally, other possible health issues include diarrhea and other general travellers' diseases like motion sickness. Watch what you eat and drink and in case you get it, drink plenty of fluids (to prevent dehydration) and bring ORS.\n\nedit\n\nSafety\n\nSee also Travel Safety\n\nDespite its great attraction, Guatemalan tourism has been adversely affected by frequent violent attacks on travellers to its country. It is therefore recommended that visitors limit their sightseeing to the major destinations and travel with a reputable tour group if you are going on an organised trip. Travelling independently is no problem though, but try to travel during daylight hours only and avoid night buses.\n\nIf you do decide to head off into more remote regions, you will be rewarded with a very intimate experience with Guatemala and it's people and lands. Sensible precautions will see you have a safe, adventurous trip, and seeking advice from locals is the best way to keep up to date with the regions security situation.\n\nIn Guatemala City and much less so in a few other popular tourist spots, there tend to be a lot of pickpockets, so make sure you aren't packing any documents and other important stuff while you're sightseeing and surely don't flash your money, jewelry and other valuable stuff around.\n\nedit\n\nKeep connected\n\nInternet\n\nInternet access is widely available. Even most of the more remote areas have some type of internet access available. Many larger areas also have WiFi. All of the Camperos chicken/pizza restaurants (which are numerous) offer free WiFi, as well as many other restaurants and cafes. Some hotels may also offer computer banks with internet access. Just ask and you eventually will find some sort of free access.\n\nIf you have a smartphone such as iPhone, Google Android, you just need a local SIM card (roughly Q25) and can start enjoying the prepaid access plans, which generally come in lots of an hour, a day, or a week.\n\nPhone\n\nSee also International Telephone Calls\n\nGuatemala's emergency phone numbers include 110 (police), 120 (ambulance) and 123 (fire). Guatemala's international calling code is 502. There are no area codes. Phone numbers all have eight digits.\n\nThe phone system isn't great, but it works. Tourists can call abroad from call centers, where you pay by the minute. It is also easy to purchase a calling card to use at public pay phones. The phones there do not accept money, so to use a public phone on the street you must purchase a telephone card. Typically, the cost is around 8 quetzals for a 10-min call to North America, and slightly more to Europe. Cell phones are quite cheap and calling overseas through one can get as low as $0.08 a min. If you are planning to stay for a while and plan to use the phone, you should consider buying a cheap prepaid phone. Wireless nation-wide internet access for laptops is also available as a service from some companies. Telefónica has good coverage with their PCMCIA EV-DO cards.\n\nPost\n\nEl Correo is the national postal company in Guatemala. It offers a wide range of services, including sending cards and packages both domestically as well as internationally. Most Guatemalan towns have a post office, although your best bet is to send mail from a large city. Service at El Correo is improving, thanks to consultation and assistance from Canada Post. Most post offices open from 8:30am to 5:30pm. Airmail letters to North America and Europe cost from Q6.50 and take a week or two to arrive. High-end hotels can usually send your mail for you, too. Expect packages you send through the Guatemalan mail system to take a very long time to arrive. They usually get there in the end, but it's worth paying extra for recorded delivery (correo registrado). Many stores can ship your purchases for you, for a cost. Valuable items are best sent with private express services. Couriers operating in Guatemala include DHL, UPS, and FedEx. Delivery within two to three business days for a 1-kg package starts at about Q500."
