        "text": "Escuintla\n\nGuatemala\n\nEscuintla, city, southwestern Guatemala. It lies near the Guacalate River, on the southern flanks of the central highlands, at 1,109 feet (338 metres) above sea level. It is located 28 miles (45 km) southwest of Guatemala City. Escuintla, one of the larger Guatemalan cities on the Pacific coastal plain, was a prominent political and trading centre for indigo during the 17th and 18th centuries. From the rich agricultural hinterland now come sugarcane, cotton, and coffee, as well as citronella, coconuts, pineapples, and mangoes. Beef cattle are also raised in the region. In the city are cotton-ginning and meat-packing plants; sugar refineries are in the vicinity. Escuintla is also a popular winter resort noted for its mineral baths. Situated on the Pacific Coast Highway halfway between Guatemala City and Puerto de San José, the city is served by a railroad and a nearby airport. Archaeological sites are found about 12 miles (20 km) to the west of the city in Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa. Pop. (2002 prelim.) 65,400.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Maren Goldberg."
