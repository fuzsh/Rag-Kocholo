        "text": "Spring is here, and summer is just around the corner — so save the date for some balmy summer evenings in Hollywood, at the Chef’s Table Series at About Last Knife (ALK), perfectly located in the hip and cool Godfrey Hotel Hollywood.\n\nI had the pleasure of attending an exclusive preview of the NEW monthly dinner series, where Executive Chef Olivier Rouselle served a selection of delicious, fresh farm-to-table creations with a perfectly paired wine for each course.\n\nThis Godfrey Hotel Hollywood series opens to the public on April 26. There are more evenings planned, including a tequila pairing on May 17 (did I mention tequila makes me dance?), and a cocktail pairing on June 21. They also have a gin and vinyl night that sounds like a blast to either grab a double date or a couple of girlfriends. And these nights are the best deal in town, priced at just $95 per person, and that includes all food AND drinks!\n\nGodfrey Hotel Hollywood Monthly Dinner Series\n\nThe menu we sampled was a tribute to Southern California’s fresh and vibrant ingredients. We began with an elegant Amuse-Bouche trio paired with a J Vineyards, California Cuvée sparkling wine that combined the vibrant fruit of Sonoma grapes with a traditional sparkling wine. Let’s face it – bubbles are always a fun way to get the party started and was simply delicious with the light seafood.\n\nThe first course was literally a burst of summer on a plate! Mouth-watering Scottish salmon crudo and daikon salad, beautifully served with a citrus ponzu. The plate was so pretty. This was exquisitely paired with a Jermann Pinot Grigio, 2018 from Italy, and each crisp sip complemented the vibrant flavors on the plate.\n\nThe second course was light roasted gambas and scallop, elegantly served with market vegetables, and accompanied with a tender sugar snap pea coulis. The presentation was almost (and note I say almost because it smelled divine) too pretty to eat. The Palmer Stone Chardonnay perfectly complemented the zesty flavors of the meal.\n\nAt this point I was beginning to feel pleasantly full. However, I couldn’t resist tasting the roasted duck confit, served with baked apple and a Maui onion sauce. This was paired with an Allegrini, Palazzo della Torre, 2018 from Italy, with subtle yet rich, creamy textures.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, we ended this elegant feast with dessert. Flaky profiteroles and a generous scoop of creamy vanilla bean ice cream, drizzled with warm Valrhona cocoa sauce. Le sigh….\n\nThe food was absolutely delectable and I savored my delicious wine, and just soaked in the fun ambiance of this hip hotel space. To say I was perfectly content would be an understatement!\n\nThe Rooftop Deck at Godfrey Hotel Hollywood\n\nIf you’re in Los Angeles and looking for a unique and upscale dining experience in the heart of Hollywood, (with a FABULOUS rooftop deck), I highly recommend checking out The Godfrey Hotel. It’s a perfect date night or an elegant evening with friends.\n\nReady to experience The Godfrey Hotel Hollywood for yourself? Sign up for one of their fun events here. Don’t miss out as each evening is guaranteed to be a celebration of fine food and creativity under the LA sky.\n\nALK is on the ground floor of the hotel, and it’s a retro-chic style restaurant, drawing inspiration from Hollywood’s iconic history. It has a buzz and a lively and social atmosphere. The “I|O Rooftop” is located on the 7th floor of The Godfrey Hotel and it’s built for day and night socializing. There’s a ​sun deck, indoor and outdoor bars, a roof-top pool, and amazing views.\n\nCheers to a fab summer with The Godfrey Hotel Hollywood!\n\nThe Godfrey Hotel Hollywood\n\n1400 Cahuenga Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028\n\nMap | Book A Room\n\nReservations: +1 (323) 762-1000\n\nIf you’re looking for more fun things to do in Los Angeles, you may enjoy the articles: The Walt Disney Concert Hall is Amazing and 8 Things to Do in Los Angeles\n\nWhat are YOUR favorite places to eat in Hollywood?\n\nLet me know in the comments below, and join me on Instagram and X!\n\n***This post is sponsored but all opinions are my own ***"
