        "meta_description": "The central nervous system is unquestionably the most important organ of our body, and injury to the brain or spinal cord has devastating consequences. Research is beginning to unravel the complexities of the injured CNS and is opening new doors for scientists, clinicians, and patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Neurotrauma Society seeks to accelerate research that will provide answers for clinicians and ultimately improve the treatments available to patients. The National Neurotrauma Society will continue to promote excellence in the field by providing opportunities for scientists, establishing standards in both basic and clinical research, encouraging and supporting research, and promoting liaisons with other organizations that influence the care and cure of neurotrauma victims.",
