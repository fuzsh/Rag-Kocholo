Dive into arts, culture, and dining, or enjoy vibrant nightlife. Let us guide you to the best of Hollywood Beach's offerings for a memorable stay.\n\nMy family and I had an absolutely fantastic stay at the Costa Hollywood Hotel. We had incredible sunset bay views from our room. The room was incredibly accommodating for our family of four, spacious and very clean. Being in the heart of Hollywood was a pleasant surprise, as the location was not only charming because of the beach proximity but also conveniently close to a nearby market where we could easily pick up food items to enjoy during our stay. Overall, our experience at the Costa Hollywood Hotel was awesome. We can't wait to return!\n\nMy stay at Costa Hollywood was absolutely perfect! From check-in to check-out, every detail was impeccable. We were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade upon arrival, setting the tone for an amazing experience. The gym was a standout feature with not one, but two Pelotons! Originally booked for post-cruise travels, I can't wait to return and stay longer. Highly recommend!\n\nCosta Hollywood exceeded our expectations! The location is perfect, with everything you need within walking distance. The rooms are spacious, clean, and stylishly minimalist. Daily housekeeping ensures a comfortable stay. The rooftop pool is a must-visit, with stunning views and attentive service from Craig. The beach experience is hassle-free, with complimentary towels and available chairs. We can't wait to return. Thank you, Costa Hollywood!"
