        "text": "What happens when bespoke Italian hospitality meets a private members club tucked away in sunny West Hollywood? Hotel Il Pellicano’s ‘residency’ at the lush San Vicente Bungalows, that’s what!\n\nThe Hotel Il Pellicano team love nothing more than creating intimate dining experiences that immerse guests in a multisensory experience of place. Naturally, they’re thrilled to join CEO, Creative Director and residency ‘hostess’ Marie-Louise Sciò at West Hollywood for this highly anticipated week-long collaboration with San Vicente Bungalows. This impeccable members club is infused with all the detail and charm that defines the Hotel Il Pellicano ambience.\n\n“In its own way, Hotel Il Pellicano is very much like a private club. Our members not only travel there, but they also know Marie Louise, and so having their chefs cooking in our kitchen with her hosting is like a bit of Italy coming to San Vicente Bungalows. They bring their napkins, placemats, even their own ashtrays– so there is an authenticity to the experience that our members love,” said Hotelier Jeff Klein, who opened San Vicente Bungalows well over a decade ago. Mr Klein and his team continue to welcome a star-studded list of celebrity and VIP guests who frequent the secluded sanctuary for a blissful escape, and maybe a Martini or two by the pool.\n\nWhen two world-renowned havens of hospitality and experiential indulgence join forces, you can only expect multisensory magic. And that’s exactly what we’re hearing from guests who are dining the night away with Hotel Il Pellicano and San Vicente Bungalows. The residency ends on Saturday (February 24), so if you’re anywhere nearby and fancy a fragrant Pelican Martini and a taste of authentic Italian allure, get in touch to find out more!\n\nGuests are also discovering Hotel Il Pellicano’s A la Carte Dinner Menu at San Vicente Bungalows’ restaurant until February 24, which celebrates authentic Italian flavours and recipes served with an artful Pellicano touch. Think Carciofo, ricotta, scampo e crema di crescione (artichoke, ricotta, scampi and watercress cream) for Antipasti, Paccheri, astice, carciofi e basilico (paccheri, lobster, artichokes and basil) for first course, Branzino tavolozza di patate, spinaci e salsa limone e capperi (seabass, potato, spinach and lemon and caper sauce) for main course, and for dessert…Tiramisù, of course!"
