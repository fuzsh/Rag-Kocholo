        "text": "There’s a certain sad irony to two desperate, winless teams at the bottom of the standings playing to a draw. Avoiding a loss, and earning the first point in the standings may feel like a positive change of course, but splitting two points may ultimately spell doom for both teams. Of course, it’s a long season, and there is plenty of time for redemption, but both Pink and Green have to hope the 1-1 draw doesn’t go down as another missed opportunity, come season’s end. Nick Vacchio got Pink off on the right foot late in the first, and Captain Mark DeGraffenreid evened things with his first of the season on a nifty deflection in front early in the third. Both goalies were steady, with Sean Kelly stopping several breakaway bids in his 13/14 afternoon, and Andrew Lockard standing tall at the other end (16/17). The result was much rosier for Pink, who managed it without perennial super stud, Andrew Jacobsen, while Green lost their top pick, Rick Brutchey, for the season to a nasty hamstring pop midway through the third. Kamal Gill and Raj Patel are the only remaining players on the initial short list to replace Brutchey. Whoever comes in, they will need to find instant chemistry if Green has any hope of survival.\n\nThe second game of the night produced another draw, this time with Teal and Black having to halve, 2-2. Alaa Razoky planted a wacky bounce of the back boards into a nearly empty net just fifteen seconds in to give Teal an early lead, and Nick Adkins doubled the edge with Razoky and LaGrossa’s help in the second. Black hung tough, and Steve Jones converted a scrappy goal to get his team on the board in the third. The goal was initially waived off for a hand pass, but the refs got together, and the call was quickly reversed. Black rode that reversal all the way to redemption, with Bill Casey scoring another hard-nosed goal on the doorstep to knot it for good with 2:11 to play.\n\nAnother Week Three game, another tie! The 0-0 draw is never a fan pleaser, but it allows White and Royal to remain undefeated on the young season, which may be the other side of the Pink v Green tying coin. Both goalies were, of course, perfect, with Steve Testen racking up another career shutout (22/22), and newcomer, Jerry Russell (18/18), registering the first of his SDFHL career.\n\nCover team, ‘Freddit’, kept beating the winning drum, this time snaring Dark Green, 3-2. Tim Vick and Alexis DaCosta actually staked Dark Green to a 2-0 lead through the early second, but second year stud, Jon Zygelman, got the top dogs barking soon thereafter, and Andy Strathman tied the game later in the frame. It was Zygelman again with his fourth of the season to win it in the third, and keep Orange perfect in January. Vick and Zygelman are now the unlikely leaders in the goal scoring clubhouse as we enter the middle stretch of the season.\n\nCaptain Jon Salt made his return to Light Blue’s lineup triumphant, scoring both of his team’s goals in a 2-0 win over Grey. Ashish Wadhwa, Chris Malki, and Greg Mallinger each collected an assist, and Matt Henderson stopped 10/10 to earn his first shutout of the season. Neither Captain Salt, nor Jordan Pynn could be reached for comment on the status of their once bubbling bromance after meeting face to face as foes.\n\nCaptain Ennsmann elected a Week One bye for White, and they certainly made their week one their own, stomping Dark Green, 4-0. Josh Wirt had a hand in his captain’s GWG in the first, then dropped a hat trick hammer in the third to put White in cruise control. Alyce Perry collected three assists, Ennsmann added a pair of helpers, and Steve Testen stopped 11/11 to continue his surge toward the top of the goalie ranks. It’s one week…one game…but White looks to have all of the tools to terrorize teams for the next two months.\n\nDan Jurgens took the hat trick torch from Josh Wirt, and used it to char Black, 4-2. Jurgens also assisted on the Julie Ott goal early in the first, giving him four points on the season, and share of second place in the scoring race. Steve Jones scored his first two goals of the season in vain, as Don Tran was steady enough (11/13) to hold the fort, and even Grey’s record at 1-1-0.\n\nCaptain Jeremy Copp continued to lead by (surprising) example, assisting on both of Nick Adkins (not surprising) goals, including the game-winner in Teal’s 2-1 win over Pink. Andrew Jacobsen scored the lone goal for Pink…now their only goal through two full games. Chris Tran outdueled Captain Kid Kelly (7/9) in a fill-in roll in nets for Teal, stopping 27/28.\n\nIn the real world, a low salt diet is usually just what the doctor ordered for a healthy lifestyle. In the SDFHL world, a no Salt evening has opponents licking their chops, and salivating over the savory prospect of victory. Alas, for Green, no Salt only meant another bitter defeat. Ashish Wadhwa scored a wacky goal off a Green defender, and Steph Chen made no mistake with an open look in front to make Captain Jon Salt beam with pride all the way from the east coast, as Light Blue was just a pinch better than Green, 2-1. Zach Siemer provided the only retaliation for Green, who are rumored to be making some significant lineup changes in the wake of their 0-2-0 start.\n\nConnor Miller is quickly establishing himself as the cream of the rookie crop, and has elevated Orange’s prognosis in the process. Miller’s 2 and 1 effort helped lead Orange to a 5-3 win over Gold, and lead Miller into a tie atop the league scoring slate. He shares that lead (five points) with teammate, Andy Strathman, both of whom hold just a one point edge over their captain (and…apparent overachiever?), Shawna Hamon. Kris Tosczak recorded both goals for Gold before going to war with the refs over an offside call, and finding himself ejected as a result. Gold will need to keep Tosczak’s body and, more importantly, his rational mind, on the court if they are going to dig their way out of an early season hole.\n\nThe season got off to a slow start, as Pink and Black stared blankly at each other for two periods. Bill Casey finally broke the scoring seal on the season, giving Black a lead which Kim Hernandez doubled minutes later. Cory Brin spoiled Captain ‘Kid’ Kelly’s debut, stopping 22/22 to earn the shutout in Black’s 2-0 win.\n\nParam Gill netted one in the first, one in the second, and assisted on Min-Soo Smith’s game-winner in the third as Royal Blue slid past Gold, 3-2. Mark Nagy and Kris Tosczak comprised the offense for the losing side, as rookie netminder, Jerry Russell, won his SDFHL debut behind a 16/18 line.\n\nCaptain Jeremy Copp is better known for his draft table acumen than his scoring touch, but the latter was the story in Teal’s 1-0 win over Grey. Copp’s late first period tally would be the only blemish for either goalie, with Marc Devoe (27/27) looking very impressive in besting perennial top notch tender, Don Tran (10/11).\n\nCaptain Shawna Hamon made clear to her fellows at the draft table that she was not thrilled with her fifth round draft value. So far, she’s a steal. Hamon scored the first half of Orange’s goals in a 4-1 romp over Green. Andy Strathman had a hand in both of those goals, rookie, Connor Miller, collected his first two career points, Jon Zygelman scored his first of the season, and Alan Razoky went 1 and 1, including the empty net icing on the cake. It was not all doom and gloom for Captain Mark DeGraffenreid’s side, however, as x-factor, Rick Brutchey, showed off his sniper release, accounting for the only fly in Fred Fournier’s 21/22 ointment.\n\nTim Vick made his return to the SDFHL count…1…2…3. Vick’s trick led the way in what many saw as a shocking upset, as Dark Green rolled past Light Blue, 4-2. Captain Jon Salt actually had his team on the board first, but Vick retaliated thrice unanswered before Jeff Henderson finally cut the lead late in the third. Alexis DaCosta capped the win with his first of the season, and Tiffany Fox started the season in the win column, stopping 20/22."
