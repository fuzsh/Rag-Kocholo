        "text": "Directing feature films isn’t getting any easier for Stockton dentist Param Gill, but he must be doing something right.\n\nThe aspiring filmmaker recently took top honors and a $100,000 check for his turn behind the camera of “Last Supper,” an independent dramedy feature film at the 22nd San Francisco Global Movie Fest in San Jose.\n\n“Last Supper” also was named Best of Fest, comedian Eddie Griffin (\"Malcom & Eddie,\" \"Undercover Brother\") took home the Best Actor award, Najarra Townsend (\"Contracted\") won Best Actress, and Ludmil Kazakov was named Best Editor.\n\nGill launched his film career with “Rockin Meera” in 2006 and encountered countless frustrations while filming in his native India. Working with established actors Griffin and Josh Meyers meant a different type of anxiety.\n\n“Directing is tough. They’re legends in their own right,” Gill said. “Eddie Griffin got out of a car and people were honking and stopping their cars. It was crazy. I didn’t know he was so popular. On the set he was very professional, a gentleman. I would give him ideas and he would do what I asked him to do. If I had young, inexperienced actors, it would have taken a lot longer to shoot the film.”\n\nIt took about three weeks to shoot “Last Supper.”\n\nIt’s a fairy tale about two romantic and ambitious lunatics, Fumnanya (Griffin) and Andy (Meyers) who escape a mental institution with a video camera and embark on a romantic quest to find a princess to be rewarded with a magical kiss. The princess they find is actually a suicidal, burned-out prostitute (Townsend) with a threatening pimp (Dave Vescio). Along the way, the trio become overnight sensations on YouTube, as followers speculate whether the whole thing is a clever hoax or a moving, if unorthodox, attempt at redemption.\n\n“I’d seen, many years ago, this film in Slovenian,” Gill said. “A friend recommended I watch it and after I saw it, I thought it could be adapted for American audiences.”\n\nHe and John Buchanan wrote the script, and Buchanan’s brought J Bhandal in as producer. Bhandal put the cast together. Griffin was sent the script and Gill said the actor called his agent in the middle of the night to say he wanted the role of Fumnanya.\n\nMeyers had worked with Griffin in “Date Movie” and signed on as his buddy.\n\nThe film is scheduled for national release in the U.S. and Canada in November over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nGill, who continues to practice dentistry, doesn’t expect to give up his practice, but he wants to continue making films, even if it means time away from his wife and two children.\n\n“It’s the stories that melt your heart,” Gill said. “Right after the screening I met the audience and they were absolutely moved. A man from Indian said it was a very tough movie for any director because I was (walking) a thin line with a story of a hooker. But it’s very within the realm of a PG raging and it moved his heart. Comments like that keep you going.”\n\nSo does a $100,000 prize.\n\n“I remember someone asking what I was going to do with the money and I said, ‘I live and breathe films and will make another movie,' ” Gill said.\n\nContact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com.
