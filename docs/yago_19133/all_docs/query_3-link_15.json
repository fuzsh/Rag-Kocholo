        "text": "'26. â€¦ It seems to me that, save to the extent that it can be shown that any structural damage is caused which could constitute actionable disrepair, the principles of Quick v. Taff Ely apply to this case. The only possible structural damage arising on the facts of this case might be damage to the plasterwork, but there is no evidence that the condensation required more than the walls to be cleaned, so that the damage caused was decorative rather than anything else.\n\n27. Essentially, it seems to me that the principal cause of the damp and mould is therefore the design defect in the property, for which [Mr Gill] is not to be held responsible, but I am satisfied that it was contributed to to a certain extent by the non-functioning and/or poor functioning of the boiler during the first three years of the tenancy, and that is disrepair of the installation for which [Mr Gill] is plainly responsible. It was also contributed to to a small extent by the fact that for a year or so one of the double glazed windows had been smashed and was to be repaired, so that one of the two layers of double glazing was absent. In addition, as I touched on towards the beginning of this judgment, the ingress of water contributed to the condensation, but the lack of adequate heating in my judgment did make a contribution to the condensation problem.\n\n28. In his first report, the expert says, at paragraph 5.02.1, that \"condensation occurs when moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, consequently the control of condensation is governed by the presence of moisture within the air and the presence of cold surfaces.\" He goes on to say that \"the presence of cold surfaces is governed by thermal capacity and performance of the structure, together with the presence and use of heating system.\" It was the failure or lack of any adequate heating system for these three years [November 2004 to November 2007] that made a contribution, as I have found, to the fact that there were these cold surfaces upon which damp and mould was able to grow.\n\n29. In addition, there is one area which relates to the exterior of the flat itself. It is referred to in the Scott Schedule to the first report, at paragraph 1.02, where \"dampness with minor efflorescence and minor mould growth\" is noted at the top of the front wall of the living room, requiring all defective plaster to be hacked off down the wall, approximately 600 millimetres from the ceiling. This was caused by the guttering, but it is a structural defect.\n\n30. As to the lack of heating at all for periods of time and to an adequate standard for the remainder of the first three years of tenancy, plainly this created an extremely difficult situation for [Ms Grand] and her daughter. The daughter (or her mother) describes how at the beginning they shared a bed and had to cuddle up and cover..."
