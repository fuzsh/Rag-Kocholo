        "text": "Just four months after completing a 32-unit extended stay hotel in Downtown Long Beach, Onni Group is expanding the brand to Hollywood.\n\nEarlier this month, Onni announced that the latest location of the Level Hotels & Furnished Suites brand is scheduled to open to guests this Fall at 6933 Santa Monica Boulevard. Plans call for 36 suites in studio, one-, and two-bedroom layouts, ranging from 570 to 1,250 square feet in size, located just east of West Hollywood city limits.\n\nThe new suites, which are made available for stays of 30 days or longer, will occupy a portion of an apartment complex which Onni Group broke ground on in early 2020. The seven-story structure was approved to feature 231 dwellings - including 15 affordable units - above approximately 15,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space.\n\nThe Level hotel suites are to be located together on one or more shared floors, while the remaining of the building would be left as unfurnished rental apartments. Existing Level locations within the Hope + Flower and 825 S. Hill Street operate in similar fashion.\n\nLevel Hollywood, as the new location is called, will offer access to 25,000 square feet of amenities built within the apartment complex, including a swimming pool, a screening room, and a sauna room.\n\nWhile the new apartments and hotel suites on Santa Monica Boulevard is Onni's first project to be built in Hollywood, it is unlikely to be the last. The Vancouver-based developer is also planning offices nearby at 7000 W. Romaine Street, as well as additional mixed-use projects on Cahuenga Boulevard and Vine Street.\n\nFollow us on social media:\n\nTwitter / Facebook / LinkedIn / Threads / Instagram"
