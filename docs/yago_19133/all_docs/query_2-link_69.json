        "text": "From hosting the first Academy Awards presentation in 1929 to serving as the go-to hot spot for A-list gatherings today, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has always been a destination for the stars.\n\nThis landmark across from the famous TCL Chinese Theatre (still a big spot for movie premiers) offers a unique combo of movie history and contemporary elegance. Party by a fire pit at the Tropicana Bar, overlooking a pool sporting a mural painted by modern master David Hockney. Sip craft cocktails created by mixology wizards in the exclusive-feeling Library Bar, and settle into a tufted leather booth beneath crystal chandeliers for the most glam burger youâve ever had at the restaurant 25 Degrees.\n\nKick back in the Spanish Colonial-style lobby for some people-watchingâand keep your eyes open for Marilyn Monroe. She lived at the Roosevelt for two years, and some visitors swear theyâve spotted her ghost. You can even stay in the Marilyn Monroe suite by the pool."
