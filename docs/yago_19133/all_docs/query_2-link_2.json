        "text": "Septuagenarian brothers Mel and Bernie Adler own the Hollywood Hills Hotel; their parents bought the nondescript brick building in 1948. Located on a gritty urban street within walking distance of new glamorous hotels and restaurants on Hollywood Boulevard, the hotel badly needed a refresh. The remodel was a challenge: the budget was modest and the site was messy, with two imperfect buildings (the original 1929 building and a 1970s addition). But by blurring the line between graphics and architecture, Newsom Design created a strong identity for a place that likes to bill itself as “the hotel closest to the Hollywood Sign.”\n\nThe complete graphic program included a logo; a large mural directional, ADA, code, and information signs; and large painted graphics directing motorists through the complicated site.\n\nStarting with the logo, Newsom Design developed a visual vocabulary composed of Hollywood flair, old-school painted signs, and casual dot patterns. The super-scaled pixel dot mural that distinguishes the façade of the hotel was inspired by Pop artist Ed Ruscha; the Adlers love his work, particularly his Hollywood-inspired paintings. The mural was designed to read as Klieg lights from a distance, but dissolves into a random pattern up close. The finishing touch is the word “hotel” in hot pink script at the crossing of the Klieg lights, conceived as the “lipstick kiss” of a starlet in a glamour shot."
