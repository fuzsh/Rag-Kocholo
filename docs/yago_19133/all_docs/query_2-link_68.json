        "text": "Many hotel projects proposed for Hollywood Boulevard in the 1920s were much hyped but never built- for example the Brokaw property, the Bartlett property, and the Shippee property. The Regent Hotel, on the south side of Hollywood Boulevard in the midst of Auto Row between El Centro and Argyle, did get built. It came along without fanfare, announced in the LA Times in September 1924.\n\nDesigned by architects Meyer and Holler, the 85-room, 4-story plus penthouse structure was built for the Christie brothers, who had a realty business as well as a film studio. the hotel rose on the site of a former orange orchard where the Nestor Film Company– with Al Christie, manager, had made some of the earliest motion pictures in Hollywood.\n\nThe Regent had its gala grand opening on April 29, 1925. A notable feature was that each room had a radio; connected to a central operating system at the room clerk’s desk, they could pick up local programs.\n\nWith its proximity to the early Hollywood movie studios, the Regent Hotel became popular with theatrical folk- as local papers would later put it- either on their way up or on their way down. It had become rather shabby by November 1949, when it was purchased by Ethel McCord Nelson and her son John McCord. McCord remodeled the hotel and renamed it the Hotel Gentry.\n\nEthel McCord owned the Hastings Hotel in Minneapolis at this time. As she was taking on the former Hotel Regent in Hollywood, Ethel also faced federal tax evasion charges back in Minnesota for the years 1940-1945. She was convicted in 1950 and was to have done a prison term but in December 1950, the sentence was changed to a fine and 5 years probation. She married Paul A. Nelson in Minneapolis in June 1950.\n\nWhile cleaning, Ethel found an Oscar in a closet; the statuette had no identifying information on it, nor could McCord trace the owner through the hotel records, as she could not later recall which room she had found it in.\n\nThe hotel remained the Hotel Gentry into September 1954. In October 1954, it was taken over by Irene Vermillion Dart and her husband Kermit Dart and renamed the Hotel Vermillion.\n\nThe Darts were something of a real life Fred and Ethel Mertz, retired Vaudevillians managing an apartment house. Irene, as Irene Vermillion, was a stage dancer; Kermit was a musician. The two continued to perform occasionally even after becoming landlords.\n\nThe hotel remained the Hotel Vermillion until August 1959, when Ethel McCord Nelson took it over again, renaming it the Hotel Hastings.\n\nThe Hotel Hastings was the name of the hotel in Minneapolis that Ethel had managed from 1936 to 1943, when she purchased it from the Arthur Roberts Hotel Company. She sold the Minneapolis Hastings in late May-early June 1959.\n\nEating and Drinking here\n\nThe hotel’s first restaurant opened shortly after the hotel itself, in June 1925 as the Hotel Regent Restaurant.\n\nOn March 24, 1927, ex-boxer / dentist Leach Cross opened a namesake cafe, the “Leach Cross Cafe” in the hotel’s ground floor retain space, addressed as 6160 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nLike most such Leach Cross ventures, the cafe was short lived.\n\nOn March 9, 1928, 616o Hollywood Boulevard opened as McHuron’s Grill with almost as much fanfare as the opening of the hotel itself.\n\nMcHuron’s Grill was founded by Loren A. McHuron and Charles Eaton. Both had been previously affiliated with the Paulais Cafe at Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas. The grill featured a German chef. The specialty of the house became a dish called “Toad in the Hole,” which McHuron’s claimed had originated there, and that it had a copyright. It was an old English specialty, so this is questionable. There are many varied recipes for Toad in the Hole- typically it involves a clump of sausages grilled with an egg in the center. So famed was the cafe for this dish that by the early 1930s, “Toad in the Hole” featured prominently in the grill’s print advertising as well as a neon vertical sign on the outside of the building.\n\nCharles Eaton left the partnership in 1935 to found his own namesake Easton’s chain of restaurants. L. A. McHuron carried on with the grill until 1940. The equipment and fixtures were sold at auction in July 1940. McHuron died in 1941.\n\nIn 1952, Joe’s Cuba Club operated in the former grill space, serving Italian dinners in addition to American fare.\n\nThe Hotel Gentry also still had a hotel dining room.\n\nDuring its time as the Hotel Vermillion, the hotel dining room became the Dart-Inn Room, with a twin organ bar. Kermit Dart was a talented organist.\n\nIn 1959, the grill space became the Cart Inn, offering German, Irish and Italian fare. The chef had been there during McHuron’s time, so likely Toad in the Hole could be ordered off-menu.\n\nIn 1962, it was a wine bar called The Tender Grape.\n\nIn 1964, the Hollywood USO moved into 6160 fro mthe Pantages Theater building, on what was supposed to be a “temporary” basis that lasted into the 1970s.\n\nThe hotel remained the Hotel Hastings into 1993. The building was demolished in 1994.\n\nToad in the Hole\n\nThis 1-story building, at the now-gone northeast corner of Vista del Mar and Hollywood Boulevard, was built in 1919 for the Howard Automobile Company’s new Hollywood Buick showroom. It was originally addressed as 6157 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe property owner was investor Harry H. Ziegler, who bought it from the E. W. Twist realty Company as part of the Del Mar tract.\n\nTwist Realty had previously occupied this corner itself; this section of Vista del Mar between Hollywood Boulevard and Carlos Avenue, was known Cyril Drive until 1915.\n\nElias W. Twist was the husband of Josephine Gassagne. Josephine and her surviving siblings – Charles Gassagne, Marie (Mrs. Louis Drouet), Constance (Mrs. James Larquier later Mrs. Pierre J. Picherie), Adele (aka Jenny, Mrs. Henry Kracke) and Eugenie (Mrs. Alexander T. Hoover later Mrs. Frederick Gambold)- were the grandchildren of the French-born Los Angeles pioneer Jose Mascarel, who had settled in Los Angeles in the 1840s and served 1-term as mayor from 1965 to 1966. Among his many real estate holdings was a large parcel of land on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard (originally Prospect Avenue) between Gower and Vine. Mascarel, in his 80s, began subdividing the property in 1897. He died in 1899 and a battle over his estate ensued, initiated by his three surviving adult children. The adult children were not, as was sometimes reported, cut out of his will- they were to receive 1/3 of the sizable estate, but that was not sufficient. They didn’t want any of it going to the grandchildren- whom they accused of poisoning the old man’s mind against his children and, moreover, alleged that they were not Mascarel’s biological grandchildren.\n\nCensus records for 1850 and 1860 show Mascarel living with his wife, Cerilda Lugo and the couple’s children- Marie Conception Mascarel included. However by 1870, Jose was living with another woman, Jesus, at least two decades his junior. Cerilda died in 1887 at age 59. Jose and Jesus remained together until his death; they formalized the relationship by marrying in 1896.\n\nJose and Cerilda Mascarel’s daughter Marie Conception married a livery stable owner named Charles (“French Charlie/Charley”) Gassagne. They were the parents of the 6 grandchildren who became Jose Mascarel’s chief heirs. Marie C. Mascarel Gassange died sometime between 1871 and 1875.\n\nThe heirs settled out of court over the will in 1900, agreeing to split the estate 50-50. The grandchildren resumed subdividing the Del Mar tract. They sold a 5-acre parcel on the west side of Vista del Mar Drive to pioneer music company head A. G. Bartlett in November 1900.\n\nJosephine Gassagne married Elias W. Twist in 1880. They built a large residence in Hollywood at 6129 Carlos Avenue, facing south, that in 1914 was leased to a military academy and in 1916 became the first home of the Hollywood Studio Club.\n\nIn 1912, Twist operated his real estate office at 6157 Hollywood Boulevard before selling the property to Ziegler.\n\nZeigler built the Buick showroom on the site in April 1919 as well as another 1-story garage, addressed as 6151, adjacent to the east for use as an automotive paint shop. The Buick showroom has a facade of artificial stone; the interior featured a blue and white color scheme.\n\nCharles S. Howard was the Buick distributor for California. The Hollywood branch operated out of temporary quarters at 1734 Cahuenga before moving to the new building in July 1919.\n\nHoward Motor Co.’s Hollywood Buick showroom moved to larger quarters at 6660 Sunset Boulevard on May 1, 1936. The building was a former Packard showroom. 6157 Hollywood Boulevard in turn became the new Packard showroom of W. H. Collins.\n\nW. H. Collins remained at 6157 into 1945, when he moved to 6028 Hollywood Boulevard. Abner Elliott England’s A. E. England Pontiac dealership moved into the vacated space from 6032 Hollywood Boulevard. England re-addressed the building as 6161 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThough the building had a new address, it retained its 1919 appearance until late 1948, when A. E. England began modernizing it. Architect Victor Gruen oversaw the remodel, which gave the building a late-moderne rounded curve on the southwest elevation and large, backlit A. E. England Pontiac signage across the front entrance. The work was completed in February 1949.\n\nA. E. England Pontiac remained here into 1971. Ab England died in May 1971. In January 1972 it became Jack Poet Toyota. Toyota moved down the block in 1983.\n\n6161 became an auto radio shop and other auto-related businesses. Today this site is part of the Eastown Apartment complex, addressed as 6201 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nNotes:\n\nJesus only received $5 in Jose Mascarel’s will; this was reportedly satisfactory to her, having received gifts of property from him during his lifetime. She died in 1902.\n\nJosephine and E. W. Twist lived at 6127 Yucca Avenue after leasing the mansion. She died in 1925. He died in 1930.\n\nThis building was a 1-story auto showroom on the southwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and El Centro built in 1919 for Frank E. Wright of the Wright Service Company, who leased the property from owner William E. Graham and his wife Mamie Kendall Graham.\n\nF. E. Wright had the Hollywood Studebaker franchise at the time, having taken over management of the former Studebaker dealer, the Nixon Motor Car Company in September 1917. He was officially named the Studebaker agent for Hollywood in November 1917, his display room located at 6658 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nConstruction on his new home at 6150 was announced in April 1925. The building featured tapestry brick (i.e., with a pattern effect) and enameled brick trim. Wright moved in in July.\n\nPaul G. Hoffman, Studebaker distributor for So Cal would expand into Hollywood, and in 1922 built a new showroom a little ways to the East of 6150, at 6116 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nWright, meanwhile, became the Hollywood Cole-8 dealer in October 1919.\n\nBased in Indianapolis, the Cole Motor Car Company was founded by Joseph J. Cole in 1909. Its 8-cylinder engine, the Cole Eight was introduced in 1915. Cole distributors for So Cal and Arizona, House and Meyer, opened their own Hollywood branch across the street at 6145 Hollywood Boulevard in May 1920. That month, Wright became Hollywood’s Peerless dealer.\n\nThe Peerless Motor Car Company, based in Cleveland, made luxury automobiles beginning in 1900.\n\nThings moved quickly in the post-World War I automobile World. The rush of expansion in the late Teens was followed by a slump in 1920-1921.\n\nIn January 1921, 6150 briefly became home to the Marmon. Founded by Henry Carpenter Marmon, the company had been making luxury automobiles since 1902. Al G. Faulkner as their area distributor.\n\nIn April 1921, 6150 Hollywood Boulevard became the Paige-Hollywood Motor Company, dealers for the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Company.\n\nFounded by Frederick O. Paige, the company began making luxury automobiles in 1908.\n\nIn September, the Paige-Hollywood Motor Company began handling the Dort motor car in addition to Paige.\n\nThe Dort Motor Car Company was based in Flint, Michigan. Founder Josiah Dallas Dort had been a carriage maker with partner William Durant; Dort began making autos in 1915. Paige-Hollywood Co.’s manager, L.n. McDowell had sold the first Dort in Hollywood back in 1916.\n\nIn January 1922, the Hollywood-Paige Motor Co. announced that it was changing its name to the Sunset Motor Company (no relation to another dealership company called Sunset Motors).\n\nIn June 1922, Sunset Motor Co. added the Jewett to its lineup, a lower-priced offering from Paige. Made from March 1922 through 1926, it was named for company president Harry M. Jewett.\n\nOn January 2, 1923, 6150 became H. W. Swanson’s new Hupmobile showroom.\n\nThe Hupp Motor Car Company was founded in Detroit in 1909 by Bobby Hupp and investor Charles Hastings.\n\nLater in January 1923, Walter M. Brown Motors, Inc. announced that 6150 was to become the new home of the Star Car as of May 1. Hupmobile actually remained here through June 1923; the Star Car moved in in July from its temporary home at 5916 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe Star, aka “the Star Car” was a passenger vehicle assembled by the Durant Motors Company, from parts manufactured by others. Durant Motors was the Baby Vamp of Auto Row, founded in 1921 by William (“Billy”) Durant. Son R. C. (“Cliff”) Durant was in charge of the company’s interests on the West Coast.\n\nIn November 1925, the Star Car (and its roof sign) moved to its own custom-built quarters at 5610 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nIn early December, 1925, the vacated 6150 became home of Sherman P. Bakewell’s Bakewell Motors, dealers of the Jordan.\n\nThe Jordan Motor Car Inc., was founded in Cleveland in 1916 by Edward S. (“Ned”) Jordan as the Jordan Motor Car Company. Like the Star Car, the Jordan was at this time an assembled car, built with parts made by others. Bakewell soon took on a partner, George B. Eshleman and became Bakewell and Eshleman.\n\nIn February 1927, the building again became a Paige showroom, operated by Paige distributor Harry H. Anderson.\n\nIn May 1927, the Marmon also returned to 6150 when Anderson became the area’s exclusive Marmon dealer. The Marmon was made until 1933 but they were not sold at 6150 for long.\n\nIn May 1928, the building became an outlet of the Hollywood Cadillac Agency, used car specialists. The agency was later taken over by Hollywood’s Caddy and La Salle dealer, Hillcrest Motor Co. and moved out of 6150 at the end of 1929.\n\nIn January 1930 6150 became a second Hollywood home of the H. F. Haldeman Willys dealership.\n\nWillys was a product of Willys Overland Motor, founded by John North Willys. Willys began bought Overland Automotive in 1912 and renamed his automobile company accordingly.\n\n6150 existed as a used car outlet for most of 1930 through 1931 and the first half of 1932.\n\nIn late June it became the new home of Homer Thompson’s “Nash in Hollywood” dealership. Thompson and Al Stuebing (later of Ford) as the Thompson Stuebing Co. were the Nash distributors for So Cal.\n\nIn May 1934, Frank C. Bestor took over as Hollywood’s exclusive Nash dealer, renamed Nash Bestor Company. Bestor also offered the LaFayette. Nash had purchased the LaFayette in 1924 and in 1934 introduced the Nash-built Lafayette, a lower-priced model. Thompson resumed operation of the Nash dealership here for 1935- early 1936.\n\nStarting in May 1936, H. F. Haldeman returned to 6150, now as a De Soto and Plymouth dealer. Both cars were made by the Chrysler Corporation.\n\nFerd H. Cate, Haldeman’s longtime manager, took over the De Soto Plymouth dealership in August 1938.\n\nWith domestic auto production halted in February 1942, the government had also put a freeze on new 1942 cars that had already rolled off the line and were sitting on dealers’ lots. Most of them went to military use. Others could be sold, under limited circumstances. For the duration, dealers like Ferd Cate would focus on used car sales and their service departments.\n\nFerd Cate would not see the end of WWII or the postwar era of car sales. He died in July 1945, age 51.\n\nCate’s longtime manager Clem F. Atwater, partnered with Vance Fish, took over the Hollywood De Soto Plymouth dealership here, expanding and remodeling the building in January 1946 in anticipation of new cars arriving for the first time since 1942. Their appointment as official De Soto Plymouth dealers was announced in March 1946.\n\nAlthough the firm still sold De Sotos, by June 1959, Atwater and Fish were known as Hollywood Plymouth Center.\n\nAtwater and Fish remained here into June 1961, the building’s longest occupants by far. It’s days as an automobile concern were over.\n\nIn September 1961, 6150 became a Blue Chip Stamp Redemption Center. Founded in California, the Blue Chip Stamp Company was a loyalty program, similar to S&H Green Stamps, where customers of certain stores were issued stamps that could be redeemed for crappy merchandise. They were introduced in So Cal in January 1960. 6150 remained one of many LA area redemption centers, through May 1963.\n\nIn November 1963, 6150 became an outlet of the Chicken Delight fast food chain, which oddly specialized in a fish pizza.\n\nThe building was demolished in 1994 for Metro’s Red Line subway project.\n\nNotes\n\nW. E. Graham died in 1924. Mamie K. Graham continued to own the building. She died in 1969.\n\nThis 1-story auto showroom on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard was built on the Del Mar tract for Elliot M. House and R. A. Meyer, Cole distributors for Southern California and Arizona.\n\nBased in Indianapolis, the Cole Motor Car Company was founded by Joseph J. Cole in 1909. Its 8-cylinder engine, the Cole Eight was introduced in 1915. House and Meyer, as Davidson, House and Meyer, had become Cole distributors in August 1919 and had a new dealership at 1225 S. Grand Avenue. F. E. Wight of the Wright Service Company, became Hollywood’s Cole-Eight dealer in October 1919, located across the street at 6150. House & Meyer, sans Davidson, expanded the Cole franchise to Hollywood in May 1920 and their Hollywood branch showroom opened at 6145 Hollywood Boulevard in June 1920. The new building was along the same lines as the one on Grand Avenue.\n\nHouse and Meyer’s time in Hollywood was short, however. In August, J. R. Allread took over the Cole franchise at 6145.\n\nIn May 1921 it became the Chandler dealership of W. P. Herbert Company, distributor for So Cal. Chandler was based in Cleveland.\n\nIn August 1923, the Hollywood branch was turned over to associate dealer H. F. Haldeman. Chester Bennett Motors took it over in November 1924.\n\nIn December 1926, H. F. Haldeman returned to 6145, now a Nash dealer. Nash, based in Kenosha Wisconsin at this time, had been founded in 1916 by ex-General Motors president Charles W. Nash.\n\nHaldeman remained here through March 1927. In May 1927, it became the Hollywood branch of the White Auto Company. Headed by O.R. Fuller, the White Auto Company had been So Cal’s distributor of the Auburn automobile since 1924.\n\nThe Auburn Automobile Company of Auburn, Indiana was organized in September 1903 by brothers Charles, Frank and Morris Eckhart. The Eckhart family sold the company to Chicago investors in 1919. The company’s prestige and market share grew under the leadership of Errett Lobban (“E. L.”) Cord, who was elected vice-president and general manager of the Auburn Automobile Company in October 1924, and became president in February 1926. Born in Missouri in 1894, E. L. Cord grew up in Los Angeles and in 1933 would build an expansive estate in Beverly Hills he called “Cordhaven.” In October 1926, Cord purchased the Duesenberg Company, known for its racing cars, and employed its founders, brothers August and Frederick Duesenberg, to design passenger autos. In 1929 he created the Cord Corporation, a holding company, and that summer introduced the front wheel drive Cord L-29 automobile.\n\nThe White Auto Co. was renamed the Auburn-Fuller Company in October 1928 to more fully associate itself with the product.\n\nIn January 1932 Auburn-Fuller’s Hollywood Auburn Cord dealership and Richard F. Carlson Motor Company’s Hudson Essex dealership swapped spaces. Auburn moved to 6250 Hollywood Boulevard at the southeast corner of Argyle- previously home of Carlson Hudson, while Carlson moved into Auburn’s vacated space at 6145.\n\nNext it was Oldsmobile’s turn at 6145, handled by Harry Carver Inc., in February 1934. In May 1934, C. E. Kemper, Inc. took over the Oldsmobile franchise for Hollywood.\n\nKemper continued selling new Oldsmobiles here through June 1941. Thereafter, Kemper offered used cars at this location, as well as maintaining his service department, through early August 1943. That month, it became Butler Motor Co. used cars and repairs. By now, the US had entered WWII and with domestic auto production suspended for the duration, used cars were all that was left. Maintaining your existing vehicle was critical.\n\nAfter the war, Butler Motor Co. became a Kaiser / Frazer dealership. Between June 28-30, industrialist Henry Kaiser and partner Joe Frazier exhibited the 1947 Kaiser Special and the 1947 Frazer at the downtown dealership of Kaiser / Frazer distributor, “Mad Man” Muntz Car Co., located at 11th and Figueroa. Kaiser, who was engaged in shipbuilding during the war, was also building affordable housing in the Los Angeles area with Fritz Burns as Kaiser-Burns Homes.\n\nC.R. Peterson replaces Butler as Hollywood’s Kaiser / Frazer dealer in July 1947. In February 1948, Peterson sold his franchise to Ray L. Peterson (no relation) and Tom Maggard. who as Peterson & Maggard, continued selling Kaiser / Frazer automobiles through August 1949. In September 1949, their equipment and supplies were sold at auction.\n\n6145 Hollywood Boulevard became Joe Newell, the self-proclaimed “King of the Near Nu Cadillacs.”\n\nJoe remained here into early April 1952. In late April 1952, Mel Alsbury, the Chrysler – Plymouth dealer at 6119 Hollywood Boulevard, took over this location as well as its neighbor to the east at 6125, a 1-story auto garage of the same approximate vintage. This spot generally housed his used car department.\n\nThe building was demolished in 1972.\n\nThis theater on the south side of Hollywood Boulevard in the midst of Hollywood Automobile Row opened on October 20, 1926 as Carter DeHaven’s Music Box. Unlike the Marcal, which had opened five months earlier just to the east at 6025 Hollywood Boulevard, the Music Box started out as a legitimate theater, not a movie theater venue.\n\nThe project was announced in the Hollywood Daily Citizen on September 12, 1925 and in the Los Angeles Illustrated Daily news and the Los Angeles Times on September 12, 1925.\n\nThe land the theater was built on, like Hoffman Studebaker’s, was leased from the estate of Daeida (Ida) Beveridge. Often called the “Mother of Hollywood,” she had owned the large ranch property with her husband, Harvey Henderson Wilcox. The couple came to the area from Topeka, Kansas and subdivided Hollywood in 1887. Wilcox passed away in 1891; in 1892, Ida married Philo Beveridge. Ida Beveridge controlled the Wilcox land holdings and, when Hollywood incorporated in 1903, donated land for many of its civic buildings. She passed away in 1914 and her estate manager, C.B. Brunson (who was married to the Beveridge’s daughter Phyllis), developed the property as Hollywood turned increasingly commercial.\n\nThe theater was to be a legitimate show house, venue for musical revues in the style of Flo Ziegfeld, George White and Earl Carroll on Broadway- and was probably influenced by the “Music Box Revue” shows presented by Irving Berlin and Sam S. Harris between 1921 and 1924 at Berlin’s Music Box Theatre. The project proponents were actor Carter DeHaven (also spelled de Haven), who was to run the theater, and William S. Holman, secretary of the Christie Film Company, one of the earliest movie studios in Hollywood. The architect was Morgan, Walls & Clements. The building also contained four retail spaces and an open-air cabaret space on the roof.\n\nCarter DeHaven was a Vaudeville/Broadway stage actor who later appeared in motion pictures, often with his wife, Flora Parker (typically billed as “Mrs. Carter DeHaven”). The couple’s daughter, Gloria DeHaven later also joined the acting profession.\n\nHollywood’s elite paid $11 a seat to attend the gala grand opening on October 20, 1926. The opening show was called “Fancies.” Though local theater critics raved about the show, “the most brilliant premiere in the history of California” was not without its hiccups. Journalist Dan Thomas in his syndicated column, “These Movie Folk,” wrote that “first-nighters were given more than they expected. In the second act, the stage was adorned with settings from two different scenes, which didn’t match at all. I am told that all of the stagehands were- well, intoxicated.”\n\nCarter DeHaven’s association with the running of the theater was short. In January 1927 Louis O. Macloon took it over. His first show, “Hollywood Music Box Revue,” opened February 2, 1927. In March, the show, renamed the “Fanny Brice Revue,” moved to the Biltmore Theatre downtown.\n\nIn February 1928, George Sherwood took out a long lease on the theater. His first production was “Women Go On Forever,” which had run on Broadway at the Forrest Theatre from September to December 1927, opened at the Music Box March 13, 1928.\n\nAfter “Women Go On Forever” closed in May 1928, Sherwood engaged the Pasadena Community Players’ production of “Lazarus Laughed,” by Eugene O’Neill to be performed at the Music Box for a limited engagement starting May 15, 1928. If anyone came expecting to laugh, they would be very confused.\n\n“Lazarus Laughed” closed on May 31 and the Music Box went dark until June 18, when the Japanese Imperial Theater Players opened with a Ken-Geki show- Japanese sword play with music and dancing- for a limited 1-week engagement, sponsored by L.E Behymer and Hollywood elites Charlie Chaplin, Sid Grauman, Sam Goldwin, Cecil B. DeMille and Joseph M. Schenck.\n\nIn July 1928, Max Dill of the comedy team Kolb and Dill took over the Music Box lease. His first production, a musical comedy written by Dill himself called “Pair O’ Docs,” opened August 22, 1928. It featured a chorus of young women performing in roller skates. The show- and Max Dill- moved to the Mayan Theatre on September 16, 1928.\n\nDixie McCoy, former head of casting at the Christie movie studio, took over the theater’s lease on September 7, 1928. She intended it as a venue for her own production company, to offer a series of dramas starting with Gilbert Emery’s play “Tarnish,” which had run on Broadway at the Belmont Theater from October 1923 to May 1924. McCoy’s production opened at the Music Box on September 25, 1928 and closed November 4. Although McCoy had indicated in October that she would be announcing further productions for the Music Box “soon,” instead she announced that she was moving her production company to the Vine Street Theater at 1615 N. Vine.\n\nThe Music Box went dark on November 5-15, 1928. On November 14, a documentary-style film, “Simba,” opened at the theater for a limited 10-day run November 16-25. It had already played for several weeks downtown at the Biltmore Theatre.\n\nThe Music Box went dark again from November 26 to December 24, 1928. On December 25, comedian and ex-Ziegfeld star Lupino Lane appeared at the Music Box for a limited engagement over the holidays, returning the theater to its musical revue format. Lane had previously appeared in the Music Box Revue show in 1927 while it was still under the management of Carter DeHaven. The popular show closed February 4.\n\nThe Music Box went dark after Lane’s show for the rest of February and all but one day of March 1928. On Easter Sunday, March 31, flamboyant young evangelist Rheba Crawford held services in the theater. Though it was an invitation-only event for the main floor, the balcony was thrown open to the public.\n\nCrawford had begun her career with the Salvation Army, attending rallies in Times Square, New York, where she earned the nickname “The Angel of Broadway.” Crawford quit the Salvation Army in January 1923 after a high-profile incident in which she backed up traffic on the famous thoroughfare. She came to Los Angeles in January 1929 and began preaching over radio station KPLA. In 1934 she would become an assistant pastor at Sister Aimee Semple McPherson’s Angelus Temple.\n\nO. D. Woodward took on a 5-year lease for the Music Box in March 1929. His first production, a frothy comedy, “The High Road,” opened on April 13.\n\nOn May 19, 1929, “Dracula” opened at Woodward’s Music Box, starring Bela Lugosi. Lugosi had portrayed the Count during the show’s original Broadway run at the Fulton Theater from October 1927 to May 1928. He had reprised the role at the Biltmore Theatre in the Summer of 1928, also staged by O. D. Woodward. A motion picture version was released in 1931.\n\nOn June 19, 1929, Monroe Lathrop, arts writer for the Los Angeles Evening Express, reported that theatrical producer/composer Harry Carroll had signed a long term lease for the Music Box and would take it over on or around September 15, 1929. His first show, “Harry Carroll’s Revue,” was in keeping with the Music Box’s not-so-distant roots.\n\nOn September 26, 1929, Ralph G. Farnum, New York casting agent, borrowed the Music Box for the day to hold auditions for performers to populate Broadway shows by Ziegfeld, George White, Earl Carroll, George M. Cohen and others. The turnabout was seen as fair play, as Hollywood, since the recent advent of talking pictures, was increasingly poaching talent from the Broadway stage for its all-singing, all-dancing musicals that featured Broadway-style reviews- such as Warner Brothers’ Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929).\n\nHarry Carroll’s Revue closed on October 22 and the theater went dark again. On November 12, 1929, the LA Evening Express reported the unfortunate news that, per the trade publication Inside Facts, Carroll had had to sell his $30,000 house in Santa Monica to pay off debts incurred by the show. The only time the Music Box was not dark that month was on November 19 when Fox did some night shooting for a talkie at the entrance to the theater, attracting a huge crowd on the Boulevard.\n\nOn December 23, 1929, The Music Box reopened with a 1-off play, a comedy farce written by Clarence O’Dell Miller- a prominent Pasadena attorney- and Ole M. Ness- former director of the Potboiler art group- called “Maternally Yours.”\n\nThe show was not well received by critics and even stunts like a local dairy distributing bottles of milk in the aisles and co-author Miller mailing personal cards and letters inviting everyone in the LA phone book named Miller to attend “Miller Night,” it was a flop. Though a New Years’ Eve matinee had been advertised, the show closed abruptly and the theater slapped together a vaudeville program with fun galore, girls and free dancing.\n\nIn January 1930 the Los Angeles Repertory Theater, renamed the Civic Repertory Theater, took over the Music Box for its new season. The first of 8 plays, “And So To Bed,” opened January 27, 1930. The successful season concluded in June, after which the theater would host special events such as dance recitals.\n\nLA Evening Express 1/27/1930.\n\nAgnes De Mille put on a recital at the Music Box also. LA Record 7/9/1930.\n\nLater in the Summer of 1930, Hollywood Civic leaders organized the Hollywood Bowl Theater Association and planned to build a theater at the Bowl. The Civic Repertory Theater would be its company. Meanwhile, it remained at the Music Box, where the Fall season opened November 3, 1930, with George Bernard Shaw’s “The Apple Cart.” Profits from the season were to go toward building the company’s permanent home at the Bowl. The 1930-31 season began strong on January 5, 1931, with “Porgy.” But the Bowl plans never materialized and the company had to end the season early due to lack of financial support; through an arrangement the Pasadena Community Playhouse, subscribers were able to attend that venue’s plays on certain nights.\n\nDickson Morgan used the suddenly dark theater to bring Leslie Carter to Hollywood in “Shanghai Gesture” for a limited engagement starting April 20, 1931. It was a critical and commercial success. Miriam Hopkins would portray Carter in a 1940 biopic “The Lady with Red Hair.”\n\nWhen “Shanghai Gesture” closed, the Music Box went dark except for the odd special event. It was by no means unique in this. Other Hollywood legitimate theaters were experiencing long periods of vacancies as well. One could blame the Depression, or the novelty of talking pictures; however, hit shows proved audiences would come if given fare they liked and stayed away in droves if they didn’t like a show.\n\nThey didn’t like Morgan’s next show, “Precedent,” which opened at the Music Box September 21, 1931. The creme of Hollywood motion picture society turned up for the first night but after that it was sparsely attended and closed October 3. Morgan had reportedly already taken on a long-term lease on the Music Box.\n\nThe Music Box went dark again, reopening Christmas Day 1931 with a French farce, “Easy for Zee Zee,” produced by Richard Wilbur, which had run for 61 weeks at the Green Street Theater in San Francisco, interrupted by police raids. The racy fare attracted capacity audiences through January into February. On Feb 6, 1932, cast members Virginia King and Harry J. Jordan got married on stage at the conclusion of the performance and invited the audience to attend. The show closed on February 8, 1932.\n\nThe Music Box was now under the management of Richard Wilbur, whose stock company, the Wilbur Players, promised a new play every Friday starting February 19, 1932, with “It’s a Wise Child.”\n\nThe players did stage 4 plays on 4 successive Fridays but despite reports that the box office was booming, the theater closed abruptly without explanation.\n\nOn April 26, 1932, a 1-off production of “Hit the Air,” a musical spoof on radio (the latest threat to Hollywood), produced by Harry M. Sugarman, opened at the Music Box. Sugarman, aka “Sugie” would later open The Tropics, a South Seas-themed cocktail lounge in Beverly Hills, and the Hollywood Tropics on Vine Street (see my post on the Hawaiian Craze).\n\nThis pattern of different short-term operators or stock companies leasing the theater for their productions would be repeated for the rest of the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s. A notable tenant was CBS radio, which used the theater for Lux broadcasts from 1936 to 1940. CBS would also use other Hollywood legitimate theaters (such as the Vine Street Theater at 1615 N. Vine) for different broadcasts even after its new West Coast headquarters opened on Sunset Boulevard, as the Movie Town became the Radio City, but 6126 Hollywood Boulevard was the home of Lux Radio Theater for its first 5 years in Hollywood.\n\nLux Radio Theater, sponsored by Lever Brothers (makers of the popular detergent and bath soap Lux), began broadcasting from New York on October 14, 1934 over the NBC Blue Network, presenting adaptations of Broadway plays dramatized by stage actors as well as visiting film stars. Lever Bros. had long featured film’s leading ladies in its beauty soap print advertisements so already had ties to Hollywood.\n\nMonday, June 1, 1936 marked several firsts for the show: its move to CBS, to Hollywood, and the Music Box Theater. It began dramatizing movies rather than plays, often featuring the original stars reprising their roles. Cecil B. DeMille served as director, producer and narrator.\n\nThe historic June 1, 1936 show was “The Legionnaire and the Lady,” an adaptation of the 1930 film “Morocco.” Marlene Dietrich performed her original role with Clark Gable stepping into Gary Cooper’s shoes. Gable had appeared on the Music Box stage before- in a 1927 production of “Chicago.” The Lux radio show was broadcast in front of a live studio audience and a capacity crowd filled the Music Box, though local arts critics lamented that radio theater was not theatre.\n\nIn the Summer of 1940, the Music Box Theatre resumed use as a legitimate show house. The Hollywood Theater Alliance, formerly headquartered in the old Writers Club building at 6700 Sunset Boulevard, took on a 5 year lease of the theater and moved in on August 1, 1940. Its first production here, “Meet the People” debuted on August 19, when it moved to the Music Box from the Hollywood Playhouse on Vine.\n\nThe Music Box continued to be used as a legitimate theater by others through the Summer of 1944.\n\nOn February 1, 1945, the Music Box reopened as a first-run motion picture theater, renamed the Guild Theater, operated by Fox West Coast. The gala grand opening was marked by searchlights over Hollywood Boulevard with bunting and pennants festooning the front of the building, which was remodeled for the new use. The opening fare was a double bill, “Bride By Mistake” and “The Falcon in Hollywood.”\n\n6126 Hollywood Boulevard would again be leased by CBS for radio broadcasts in 1948, when theaters in general, like nightclubs, were struggling to stay afloat. It resumed use as a movie theater on May 26, 1954 and was renamed Fox Theater aka New Fox. In September 1959 Pacific Theaters took over the operation, as it did the Marcal Theater, and the Fox was renamed the Pix Theater.\n\nIn 1985, the building returned to its legitimate theater roots and was renamed the Henry Fonda Theater. As the Fonda Theater, it continues as a theater venue today.\n\nBorn in Illinois in 1891, Paul G. Hoffman came to Los Angeles and began selling Studebakers when he was still a teenager. In 1919 he partnered with Robert D. Maxwell as Maxwell and Hoffman, and on March 9, 1919 Maxwell and Hoffman were named Studebaker distributors for Los Angeles, headquartered at 1047 S. Grand Avenue (they later moved to 1015 S. Grand).\n\nAt that time, the Wright Motor Co., run by Frank E. Wright, was the Studebaker dealer for Hollywood, having succeeded James Nixon of the Nixon Motor Company in 1918. Nixon/Wright were located at 6658 Hollywood Boulevard then at 6150 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nJust a little more than a year after being named Studebaker distributors for Los Angeles, on April 4, 1920, the Paul G. Hoffman Company took over succeeded Maxwell and Hoffman as Studebaker dealer for Los Angeles as well as expanding his territory to include Hollywood. He opened his Hollywood branch at 6325 Hollywood Boulevard. (In June 1920 Hoffman would open his new downtown headquarters at 1250 S. Figueroa.\n\nIn July 1922, the Hoffman company negotiated with the estate of Daeida (Ida) Wilcox Beveridge for lease of a property and to construct a new 1-story showroom building, to be located at 6116 Hollywood Boulevard on the south side of the boulevard near Gower. Meyer and Holler were the builders.\n\nThis property had been part of a large rural parcel that Daeida (Ida) Beveridge had owned with her first husband, Harvey Henderson Wilcox. The couple came to the area from Topeka, Kansas and subdivided Hollywood in 1887. Wilcox passed away in 1891; in 1892, Ida married Philo Beveridge. Now Ida Beveridge, she controlled the Wilcox land holdings and, when Hollywood incorporated in 1903, donated land for many of its civic buildings. She passed away in 1914 and her estate manager, C.B. Brunson (who was married to the Beveridge’s daughter Phyllis), developed the property as Hollywood turned increasingly commercial.\n\nPaul G. Hoffman Co. moved into the new building between November 25 and December 2, 1922.\n\nIn October 1924, Hollywood’s first radio station, KNX, owned by the Los Angeles Evening Express newspaper, located its broadcasting studio in the Hoffman building. The massive transmitting towers and giant red KNX letters were a beacon for blocks around, as much of the vicinity was still undeveloped or contained buildings no taller than 1 or 2 stories tall. The first broadcast took place on October 10, 1924. KNX moved the station to the Paramount Pictures lot in 1928, but continued to use the Hoffman studio as well. In 1933 they operated out of 5939 Sunset Boulevard, which had been built in 1924 as a showroom for the Peerless Motor Car.\n\nBased in South Bend, Indiana, Studebaker began as a wagon-making company in 1852. It had been producing automobiles, both gas and electric, in partnership with other companies, since the early 1900s. The first wholly Studebaker-produced motor cars were made in 1912.\n\nBy the mid 1920s, Paul G. Hoffman, the person, left Los Angeles For South Bend to serve as VP of the Studebaker Corporation of America under its president Albert R. Erskine, though he would remain president of his namesake company here. The company acquired luxury automobile maker Pierce-Arrow in 1928. However, the 1929 Stock Market crash impacted the company’s finances.\n\nIn 1932, it began marketing a lower-priced vehicle called the Rockne, named for Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, made in Detroit. (The Hoffman Rockne division was at the downtown location).\n\nBut on March 18, 1933, the Studebaker Corporation entered into receivership. Paul G. Hoffman, the person, was one of the receivers. Corporate president Erskine was fired; he killed himself on July 1, 1933. That month, the company dropped the Rockne. It also sold Pierce-Arrow.\n\nAmid news of Studebaker’s reorganization negotiations, the Hollywood branch of Paul G. Hoffman offered a distraction in the form of “Captain” J. J. Lynch’s driverless car demonstration that involved a “Phantom Studebaker” making a U-turn on Hollywood Boulevard. Even a car with a driver in it making a U-turn on the crowded Boulevard would have been newsworthy, but Lynch, a self-styled captain often referred to as a radio engineer, took it to a new level.\n\nThe Phantom car, a 1934 Studebaker roadster, was to leave the showroom at 6116 and head south on Gower to Sunset, then proceed west on Sunset to La Brea; it would go north on La Brea back to Hollywood Boulevard and head east to Cahuenga, where it would complete a U-turn in the middle of the street before returning to 6116. Luckily. there were no reports of any injuries.\n\nIn January 1935, Studebaker emerged from receivership, reorganized and refinanced, with Paul G. Hoffman as president.\n\nPaul G. Hoffman, the Hollywood Studebaker company, retired the dealership in Hollywood and closed the showroom at 6116 Hollywood Boulevard as of Oct 1, 1937 when its former salesman of the last 6 years, David J. Bricker took over as Studebaker distributor for Hollywood.\n\nIn late January 1939, 6116 became Ernie Smith Inc., a Lincoln, Mercury and Lincoln Zephyr dealership. To celebrate it displayed the “X-Ray car,” a Lincoln Zephyr bound for the Golden Gate Exposition at Treasure Island in San Francisco.\n\nLincoln and Mercury were part of the Ford Motor Company. Ford had acquired the Lincoln Motor Company in February 1922 and it operated as Ford’s luxury division. The streamlined Lincoln Zephyr was introduced in 1936. Mercury was a new division of Ford, introduced by Henry Ford’s son Edsel Ford in November 1938.\n\nOn October 6, 1939, a new firm called Hollywood Motors., Inc. succeeded Ernie Smith at 6116 as Hollywood’s Mercury, Lincoln and Lincoln Zephyr dealership. It was originally managed by Leo S. Domergue; later it was Paul Boulton.\n\nIn November 1941, Hollywood Motors, Inc.’s Lincoln, Lincoln Zephyr and Mercury dealership moved to 5600 Sunset Boulevard. The following month, longtime LA auto dealer Ralph Hamlin acquired 6116 for used car sales. Hamlin remained through January 1942. Later that month it became Hollywood Hudson. Just weeks later, all domestic vehicle production in the US shut down as auto manufacturers concentrated on the war effort. Dealers, like Hollywood Hudson, focused on their service departments- as maintaining your existing car became critical.\n\nThe elegant building built for Paul G. Hoffman ended its days as an automotive showroom as the used car dealership of J. L. Herd Automobile Company. In December 1945, the Office of Price Administration (OPA), which among other things regulated prices during the war emergency, suspended Herd’s license for 30 days for selling a 1942 Buick for $840 over the OPA’s price ceiling.\n\nIn July 1946, 6116 Hollywood Boulevard became a Collins Appliance Co retail store, which was here for two years.\n\nThe building became a film studio for Harris Productions, which made commercial films and test strips. It was damaged by (the inevitable) fire in June 1949.\n\nAs of May 1950, the building became the new home of the Hollywood Gun Shop, which moved here from another automotive building at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard. The gun shop was ultimately the longest tenant the building had had to date- remaining here into 1969.\n\nThe building was demolished in 1971. Today it is a parking lot for the adjacent Fonda Theater at 6126 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nLocated on the southwest corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Gower, the Hollywood Christian Church dedicated its new home here on May 21, 1910. The building was a former residential home, a vine-covered bungalow set amid sloping lawns, pepper trees and palms, and the church was fondly known as the “bungalow church.”\n\nLos Angeles would have other bungalow churches. The trend was considered a particularly Southern California phenomenon, like open-air grocery markets.\n\nThe Hollywood Christian Church was founded in 1888 by merchant B. F. Coulter of the department store and the Rev .M. L. Yager who organized the Disciples of Christ Church. It originally met at a school in Coldwater Canyon, later site of the Beverly Hills Hotel, sharing the space on alternating Sundays with the Southern Methodists. In 1890, the church built a small building in Cahuenga near Sunset on land donated by Helen M. Judson Beveridge, wife of the ex-Illinois governor John Lourie Beveridge.\n\nHaving outgrown that space, in 1910 they began looking for a new home and found it in a literal home at what was then Prospect Avenue and Gower.\n\nThe area was still largely rural and there were several other churches along the Boulevard. The church removed some walls to make room for the congregation but left the fireplace and window seats to create a home-like atmosphere. A deep side porch was enclosed with glass for the Sunday school room.\n\nIn 1920 the church acquired land at 1717 Morgan Place (later renamed Gramercy Place) just north of the Boulevard and in December 1921 revealed plans for a large new church to be built on it, designed by Robert H. Orr. Greek Revival in style, the new building would be quite different from the humble bungalow church.\n\nThe church sold its bungalow home in December 1921 but continued to occupy it as a tenant, renting from the new owner while the new building was under construction. On April 5, 1923, the congregation moved out of the bungalow and began holding services in the Sunday school building of the Morgan Place property.\n\nIn May 1923, the former “bungalow church” building opened as a cafe with music and dancing called “Gypsyland.”\n\nBoulevard Karens went ballistic, aiming their criticism at the church for having allowed a rowdy cabaret to move into its former space. Pastor W.F. Richardson had to explain that they were no longer the owners and had no say over what the new owner (Christie Realty Co.) did with the property. Gypsyland was gone in a blink, anyway.\n\nThe bungalow was next occupied by the Paul Gerson dramatics school. Born in England in 1871, Paul Gerson was a stage actor who founded an acting school in San Francisco about 1904. His Hollywood branch opened at 6100 on August 25, 1924. It remained through January 1929.\n\nAs of March 1930, the property resumed a religious use as the home of the Spiritualist Science Church of Hollywood run by Dr. Mae M. Taylor.\n\nIn February 1934 Packard dealer W. H. Collins leased the property’s Hollywood Boulevard frontage for one of his used car lots, while the Spiritualist Church continued to occupy the building itself.\n\nIn November 1935, a permit was obtained to construct a Standard Oil service station and W. H. Collins began to clear his lot. The Spiritualist Church stayed until the end as well but in December 1935, the bungalow was demolished.\n\nThe corner was a gas station for decades. Today it is a parking lot.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn October 1934, the Hollywood Christian Church merged with the Beverly Christian Church to become the Hollywood-Beverly Christian Church. The building on Gramercy Place, having suffered earthquake damage, was demolished in 1988.\n\nThe Spiritualist Science Church moved to the Castle Center at Franklin and Argyle in December 1935.\n\nLike its neighbor 6028 to the east, 6032 Hollywood Boulevard has home to a smorgasbord of automobile dealerships, including the first Toyota dealership in the USA.\n\nThe parcel was vacant until 1920 when siblings Frank Rich and Bessie Rich Garlock had a 1-story retail building constructed here. With space for 5 retail stores, it was addressed as 6030-6032-6034-6036-6038 Hollywood Boulevard. Rich & Garlock were the adult children of Edwin Rich, who owned the adjacent parcel (see 6028 Hollywood Boulevard). Their uncle was Sanford Rich, of 6048 Hollywood Boulevard, who had been mayor of Hollywood from 1904 to 1905 before it was annexed by the City of Los Angeles in 1910.\n\nThe building housed various small, mostly short-lived businesses- an automotive supply, a plumber, an architect, a hat shop, a luggage maker.\n\nOn June 2, 1928, local papers announced that the property had been leased to Leo G. Coryell, Hollywood Oakland-Pontiac dealer.\n\nThough the papers stated that the existing 1-story building would be demolished and a new auto showroom built in its place at a cost of $20,000, that was either a mistake or a deliberate fib- the same day of the announcement, the siblings obtained a permit to modify the existing building at a cost of $20,000. From now on it would be 6032 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nCoryell had been a salesman for the Albertson Motor Company Dodge distributors. For several years in the early 1920s, the firm supplied a fleet of Dodges for the LAPD.\n\nBy 1927, Coryell was a dealer for Oakland and Pontiac automobiles. The Oakland Motor Car Company was founded in 1907 and purchased by General Motors (GM) in 1909. Pontiac was a also a GM brand, created in 1926.\n\nCoryell had his formal opening for 6032, with motion pictures, lights, prizes and a general good time, on August 25, 1928.\n\nH. H. Goodrich, president of Leo Coryell, Inc., took over the dealership in April 1932, now selling the Pontiac only as GM phased out the Oakland in 1931. He was only in business briefly and closed out the shop in November 1932.\n\nOn March 1, 1933, it was announced that Hudson Essex dealer Glenn B. Austin had opened a branch at 6032 for his used car department, The cars sold here were largely demonstrator models with only a few miles on them.\n\nNamed for department store owner Joseph L. Hudson, the Hudson Motor Car Company was founded in Detroit in 1909. The company introduced the Essex in 1919. It began phasing out the brand in 1932, replacing it with the Terraplane.\n\nAustin was only here briefly, through May 1933. Hudson would return to this vicinity in 1941- when Sunset Motors moved next door at 6028. By then the Terraplane was no longer made- Hudson discontinued it in 1938.\n\nFrom August 1933 to September 1935, 6032 Hollywood Boulevard served as an auction house.\n\nIn October 1935, 6032 again became a Pontiac dealership when Pontiac dealer A. E. (Ab) England announced that he was moving into what he called “one of the finest and best equipped automotive establishments in the movie capital.” England and his brother C.P. England came to Hollywood from Phoenix, where they’d been in the auto business with their uncle O.T. England.\n\nThis section of the Boulevard was still fairly undeveloped at this point. The south side of the block was largely devoted to auto dealerships interspersed by the shaded lawns of the Mountain View Inn. Across the street, there was the Marcal Theater and some small retail buildings but the rural Brokaw property was still undeveloped, but for a defunct miniature golf course. That would change between the years 1936 and 1940 when the Palms Grill, Hawaii Theater, Florentine Gardens and Hollywood Food Mart were built.\n\nMany auto manufacturers like Pontiac were already working on military contracts prior to the US entry into World War II. Domestic auto production shut down in February 1942 as the auto industry turned 100% to the war effort. Dealers like A.E. England focused on maintaining and repairing existing cars in the service departments and buying and selling used models.\n\nA. E. England Pontiac moved out of 6032 after September 1944, relocating up the block at 6161 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n6032 again languished as an automotive building. It became the new home of the Hollywood Gun Shop from March 1945 through December 1949. The shop also sold items such as bicycles, fishing rods and reels and other sporting goods equipment. It moved to the former Paul G. Hoffman Studebaker building at 6116 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nIn March 1950, the building returned to automotive use as the showroom of “Roi’s of Hollywood” used cars. Roi’s remained here through early June 1950.\n\nOn June 22, 1950 it became Hollywood Nash. Nash had previously operated next door at 6028 in 1936 to 1937 when 6032 was a Pontiac dealership. Nash Motors Co. had become Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in January 1937, and operated as the automotive division of Kelvinator, manufacturer of refrigerators and other appliances.\n\nNash Motors Company, based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was founded by former GM president Charles W. Nash in 1916 when he acquired the Thomas B. Jeffrey Co., which had manufactured a horseless carriage called the Rambler from 1902 to 1914. Nash introduced its Rambler for the 1950 model year along with the Nash Statesman and the Nash Ambassador. The Rambler was considered a compact car for the time. Nash began using the distinctive “Airflyte” aerodynamic body styling in 1949.\n\nIn November 1950, manager Ted Faull announced that a modernization and reorganization of the space was nearing completion. Customers would now be able to enter the service department from Hollywood Boulevard but would exit onto Carlton Way, thereby avoiding traffic on the Boulevard. This indicates the dealership must have been routing customers along the south (rear) part of the property, and to the east past 6028 and 6000 Hollywood Boulevard to the alley called Brokaw Place that connected Hollywood Boulevard to Carlton Way between 6000 and the Mountain View Inn at 5956 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHollywood Nash remained here through December 1953. It moved to 5239 Sunset Boulevard. In 1954, Nash-Kelvinator merged with Hudson to form the American Motors Corporation (AMC).\n\nFrom January 1954 to May 1957, 6032 was used by J. F. O’Connor and Son Lincoln-Mercury, who had moved to 6028 in 1949, and then by O’Connor’s successor, Pearson Lincoln-Mercury. By this time both parcels were owned by Mark M. Hansen of the Marcal Theater and his wife Ida. Hansen had acquired 6032 by 1940 and 6028 as of 1952 for sure. Pearson left in May 1957 when Hollywood Ford took over 6028 Hollywood Boulevard. Likely Ford was using this property as well.\n\nIn July 1957, Reuters and other news correspondents reported that the Toyota Motor Company of Nagoya, Japan was to begin exporting its Toyopet passenger cars in the USA, an attempt to capture the growing market her for smaller, more fuel efficient cars. Toyota officials scouted locations and decided that Hollywood was the ideal place to open its first dealership.\n\nLos Angeles Toyota fans with a paid admission to the Imported Motor Cars Show, held at the Shrine Auditorium January 9-19, 1958, got to see the new Toyopet Crown- the first showing in the USA.\n\nWhile the show was still underway, on January 18, 1958, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported that Toyota had been granted a license to sell their vehicles in California. Toyota sales director Masuyuki Kato announced that their first dealership would open at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard in February 1958. On March 1, the paper reported that Toyopet parts had arrived at Los Angeles Harbor, bound for the brand’s showroom at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard. The cars themselves were expected in late March. The article indicates there was a Toyota Land Cruiser, 2 station wagons and 4 passenger cars on hand here. These were likely demonstrator models and not for sale.\n\nLate March came and went. The first shipment of Toyopets for retail sale arrived at LA Harbor on June 20, 1958 and would be available for public viewing on July 18. That date got pushed back to July 31, 1958. And when the Toyopets were finally put on the market, it does not appear that they were sold at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard, after all. Holt Motor Company Dodge-Plymouth dealer in the Valley at 5230 Van Nuys Boulevard claimed the first public showing. A local Toyopet ad published July 31, 1958 lists all the So Cal Toyopet dealerships. 6032 Hollywood Boulevard is not mentioned. If Toyopet vehicles were being sold or displayed here at this time, it wasn’t hyped.\n\nIn September 1959, Stan Brucks Oldsmobile had an import division called Brucks Imports at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard, and was an authorized dealer of the Toyopet along with other import makes- including Triumph and Singer motor cars from Britain and the Volvo.\n\nBrucks continued to advertise here through November 1959.\n\nJuly 21, 1961 was the first advertisement for Hollywood Toyota Motor, Inc. at 6032 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nHollywood Toyota moved to a new building at 1000 N. Vermont Avenue May 24-26, 1968, and later moved again to 6161 Hollywood Boulevard- the onetime home of A. E. England Pontiac.\n\nThe address 6032 Hollywood Boulevard does not appear to have been used after Toyota moved out. In June 1970, Hollywood Ford at 6000 Hollywood Boulevard had all extant structures on 6032 and 6028 demolished and the entire property from 6000 to the corner of Gower was addressed as 6000 Hollywood Boulevard. Hollywood Toyota moved back to this location (as 6000 Hollywood Boulevard) in 1983. Today it remains Hollywood Toyota."
