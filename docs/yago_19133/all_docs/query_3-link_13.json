        "text": "Having immigrated to Canada from England with my parents, I saw firsthand the amount of time and effort my parents invested and the sacrifice they faced to support our family. These are lessons I instill in my own kids to this day, and is the cornerstone as to why I am so passionate about helping my hardworking clients achieve their life goals.\n\nShowing a natural inclination towards analyzing numbers and providing solutions, I take a true interest in understanding and building personalized financial plans for pre-retirees and retirees. Creating a blueprint aimed at seeing my clients through retirement and with the goal of allowing them to live their ideal lifestyle is just as fulfilling to me.\n\nMy process begins with a thorough discovery meeting, where I get to know you and what is most important to you. With sincerity, I will provide an upfront, realistic assessment of your goals, based on your scenario. Grounded in your goals, your personal financial plan will be created and presented to you in a following meeting. Only with your agreement, will your plan be implemented. We will then discuss next steps.\n\nI genuinely care for the well-being of my clients. I do my best to take the stress out of deciding where to invest and I am here to be the main point of contact for my clients' financial health."
