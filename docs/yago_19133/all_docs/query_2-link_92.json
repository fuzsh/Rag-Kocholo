        "text": "Construction of Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino\n\nIn 2018, Superior had the pleasure of assisting with the construction of Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, the flagship property for Seminole Gaming, located in Hollywood, Florida. The hotel is the centerpiece of a 1.5-billion-dollar complex at the tribe’s Hollywood property. The back-to-back Guitar style hotel opened in October of 2019. It features 638 luxury guestrooms, a 10-acre lagoon-style pool, 30 restaurants/lounges/bars, an event venue, retail space, an expansive casino, meeting/convention space and more.\n\nSuperior’s Role in Construction\n\nSuperior’s role on the project was the amphitheater at the base of the guitar tower. Superior’s work tied the tower and the casino together using a truss that required temporary shoring towers. Each truss weighed 65,000 pounds. With the small footprint of the site, there were difficult challenges bringing in such heavy machinery and the steel. Superior teamed up with SDL to provide an erection plan that was followed and led to successful completion of the project. Superior’s expansive equipment fleet was key to making this project a success. Superior chose one of their most versatile crawler cranes in their fleet, the Liebherr LR 1300 SX crawler crane to install the steel, along with a 100-ton RT as an assist crane for the project.\n\nLiebherr LR 1300 SX\n\nThe Liebherr LR 1300 SX has a loading capacity of 660,000 lbs. with a maximum hoisting height of 554 ft. and a radius up to 377 ft.. This crawler crane is primarily designed for lifting work with high loads and can be easily assembled and disassembled. It is used in various industries such as steel erection, pre-cast erection and machine setting.\n\nThe project made the 2019 Liebherr calendar and was featured on their website.\n\nSuperior Rigging & Erecting provides solutions for projects requiring heavy steel, erecting and rigging needs. With more than 65 years of operation, Superior Rigging & Erecting has the experience, and industry-wide reputation, for mobilizing the most complicated heavy steel projects.
