        "text": "The design envelopes you in a natural experience through the surrounding materials like wood and clay along with an abundance of plants and flowers at every glance.\n\n1 Hotel was featured on Dezeen and was also named #4 on Conde Nast’s list of the 2019 Best Hotels in the World.\n\nEach detail of the landscape design fulfills this goal to meld landscape with interiors spaces through enthusiastic planting in every corner. Throughout the spaces, there is an interplay between distressed and finished woods, highlighting the inherent characteristics of each. Materials are combined and contrasted to emphasize their differences, similarities, and beauty.\n\nWood planters designed by RIOS with Angel City Lumber are indicative of this holistic integration of nature and design and provide a distinct feel for the property’s main entrances.\n\nThe design brings the outdoors inside, creating a unique, natural environment inside the lobby and key spaces. Interior firm AvroKO developed the concept, while RIOS brought the interior design to life by serving as Architect of Record for this property along Sunset Boulevard."
