History

Bellaire citizens first adopted the City's Home-Rule Charter in an election held on April 2, 1949. Since then, the Charter has been amended by election three times, in 1983, 1987, and 2006.

On November 7, 2016, the City Council of the City of Bellaire, Texas, adopted Ordinance No. 16-067 for the purpose of establishing a Charter Review Commission (the “CRC”) as an Ad Hoc Committee of the City of Bellaire, Texas, to review the Charter of the City of Bellaire, Texas, as last amended on November 7, 2006, and to appoint five (5) members to serve on the CRC for a term of seven (7) months commencing on December 1, 2016, and ending on June 30, 2017.

At the conclusion of the CRC’s meetings, a final report was prepared and presented to City Council at the June 19, 2017 Council meeting. View a copy of the final report (PDF). A brief summary of the amendments are listed below. View a full description of the amendments (PDF).

Following that meeting, the City Attorney prepared a series of propositions that could be placed on the ballot at a special election to be held on November 7, 2017 in conjunction with the City's regular Mayor and Council election. On August 21, 2017, the City Council adopted Ordinance No.17-053 to call a special election for the purpose of amending the Charter.
