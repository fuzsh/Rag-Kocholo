Why Have Limitations on Gifts?\n\nThe federal government and the House of Representatives have long recognized that public office is a public trust. [1] The public has a right to expect that you are impartial in performing your official duties and are not influenced by gifts or favors.[2] However, Congress also recognizes that you will be offered gifts that do not raise any genuine ethical concerns, or that could cause needless embarrassment or hurt feelings if denied.\n\n[1] Code of Ethics for Government Service ¶10, H. Con. Res. 175, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 72 Stat. pt 2, B12 (1958). Both the House and Senate concurred that all federal government employees and officeholders should follow this code.\n\nClose\n\nThe limitations on gifts come from many sources, including the Constitution, federal statutes, and the House Rules.[3] These sources place limits on accepting gifts, but also have exceptions to those limits.[4]\n\n[3] General statutory authority for the House Gift Rule comes from 5 U.S.C. § 7353. That statute gives the supervising ethics office the authority to issue rules or regulations implementing the statute. Id. at § (b)(1). The Committee and the House as a whole are the supervising ethics office for the House. Id. at (d)(1)(A). Therefore, the House votes on the Gift Rule at the beginning of every Congress in the House Rules. The current House Gift Rule can be found in House Rule 25, clause 5. All provisions of the Gift Rule are interpreted and enforced solely by the Committee. House Rule 25, cl. 5(h).\n\nClose\n\nReturn to top\n\nII. What is a Gift?\n\nA gift is something with monetary value for which you do not have to pay. Gifts include gratuities, favors, discounts, entertainment, hospitality, loans, forbearances, services, training, travel expenses, in-kind contributions, advanced payments, and reimbursements after the fact.[5] The Committee only considers the fair market value of the gift you receive, not whether the person or organization offering it to you paid full price.\n\n[5] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(2)(A).\n\nClose\n\nExample. Your friend invites you to play golf at the country club where your friend is a member. The club’s rules state that guests of club members do not pay any fee. The round of golf is still a gift to you. The value is what the country club generally charges for a round of golf. To determine whether you may accept the gift, please see Exceptions to the Gift Rule for Permissible Gifts.\n\nIf your spouse or dependent child accompanies you to an event where a meal or refreshments are offered, only the meal or refreshments you receive is a gift.[6]\n\n[6] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n\nClose\n\nGifts can be tangible and intangible. Examples of intangible gifts include, but are not limited to, discounts, forbearances, below fair market interest rates, selling property for more than its market value, purchasing property for less than its fair market value, and receiving compensation that is greater than the fair market value of the services you provided.\n\nReturn to top\n\nIII. How to Value a Gift?\n\nTangible gifts are generally valued at the item’s fair market value, even if the item is not typically for sale. Fair market value is the item’s retail price, not the wholesale price, or the reasonable estimate of an item’s cost if it were available for sale. You may use the lowest price available to the general public to value a gift.\n\nGifts that are offered at the same time from the same person must be aggregated to determine value.\n\nExample. You attended an awards gala and at the end of the event, the event organizer handed out a gift bag. Inside the gift bag were 5 items, each worth $10. The gift’s total value is $50.\n\nThe Committee has different formulas to value tickets to events and honorary memberships.\n\nThe face value of a ticket to a sporting event or show is the ticket’s fair market value.[7]\n\nIf the ticket does not have a price printed on it, the value is the highest priced ticket for that event, in that venue, on the primary market.\n\nThe value of tickets to charity or political fundraisers is the value of the meal.[8] The cost to the purchaser is not the ticket’s value.\n\nThe value of honorary memberships is the total of the organization’s normal initiation fee, periodic dues, and usage charges. The value does not change if you do not use the membership.\n\n[7] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n\nClose\n\n[8] Select Comm. on Ethics, Final Report, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1837, at 9 (1979).\n\nClose\n\nThe value of an intangible gift, such as a discount or a below-market interest rate, is the difference between the market rate and what you are asked to pay.\n\nExample. Your first cousin offers to help you pay for living expenses. Your cousin is willing to loan you the money you need at 0% interest if you pay your cousin back in a year. The prevailing interest rate is 3%. The gift to you would be 3% interest for that year. You may accept the loan from your first cousin as a gift from a relative.\n\nAttendance at a meeting or informational briefing generally does not have monetary value. But during that meeting or briefing, you may be offered a meal or packet of informational materials that does have monetary value. Please see Exceptions to the Gift Rule for Permissible Gifts to determine whether you may accept those additional gifts.\n\nReturn to top\n\nIV. Who is Subject to the Gift Rule?\n\nThe House Gift Rule applies to all Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, officers, and employees of the House.[9] “Officers and employees” include any individual whose pay is disbursed by the Chief Administrative Officer and those individuals providing services to the House under consultant contracts.[10] The Gift Rule applies equally to full time and part time employees, employees in district offices and in the Washington, DC offices, permanent and temporary employees, and employees on Leave Without Pay status.\n\n[9] House Rule 23, cl. 4; House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(1)(A)(i). For the purposes of all guidance in the Ethics Manual, the term “Members” includes all Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico.\n\nClose\n\n[10] House Rule 23, cl. 19.\n\nClose\n\nInterns who are not paid by the House and fellows who are not paid by the House are not House employees. Detailees, except in limited circumstances, are also not House employees.[11] The Committee recommends that each office using the services of a non-House employee still require the non-House employee to adhere to all the House Rules to protect the integrity of the House.\n\n[11] See 2 U.S.C. § 72a(f). Detailees should contact their Designated Agency Ethics Official for gift questions relating to detailees personally. Any questions that relate to the office or the Member, however, are still governed by the House Rules.\n\nClose\n\nInterns and fellows who are paid by the House, including through the House Paid Internship Program, the Wounded Warrior Program, and the Gold Star Family Fellowship,[12] are House employees.\n\n[12] For more information about the Gold Star Family Fellowship, please call the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) at 202-226-1965.\n\nClose\n\nMembers-elect are subject to the Gift Rule when their pay and allowances begin. For Members elected in a regular election, pay and allowances begin at the start of the new Congress. For Members elected in a special election, pay and allowances begin the day after the special election.\n\nGenerally the Gift Rule does not apply to spouses and family members of Members, officers, and employees. However, the gifts they, or anyone else, receive may be subject to the Gift Rule if\n\nthe Member, officer, or employee knew about and agreed to the gift; and\n\nthe Member, officer, or employee has reason to believe the gift was given because of the Member, officer, or employee’s official position.[13]\n\n[13] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(2)(B)(i).\n\nClose\n\nExample. Your child is getting married. A lobbyist you’ve met with many times, but who does not know your child personally, offers to help pay for the catering costs at the wedding. This gift was offered because of your official position and is subject to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample. Your spouse is an award-winning author. Your spouse’s latest work is nominated for a prestigious award, and your spouse is invited to attend the awards dinner at no cost. This gift was offered to your spouse because of your spouse’s achievements and is not subject to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample. A friend offered you two tickets to a baseball game. You cannot attend the game. You ask your friend to offer the tickets to your child’s t-ball coach instead. Because you knew about the gift and suggested to whom to offer the gift, the baseball tickets are subject to the Gift Rule.\n\nThe Gift Rule applies to Members, officers, and employees at all times, even during lapses in appropriations or if you are on Leave Without Pay status, family leave, annual leave, sick leave, or administrative leave.[14]\n\n[14] See Comm. on Ethics, Ethics Guidance Related to Operations During a Lapse in Appropriations (Jan. 19, 2018).\n\nClose\n\nReturn to top\n\nV. Source of a Gift\n\nWho provides the gift is just as important as what the gift is and why it was given. It is your responsibility to determine who the source of the gift is. If a person is using their own personal funds to provide your gift, that person is the gift’s source. But, if the person will be reimbursed or receive a tax deduction for your gift, that person is not providing a personal gift. If a company, foreign government, or domestic government ultimately pays for your gift, that company, foreign government, or domestic government is the gift’s source. If someone is merely passing along a gift from another person, the person passing along the gift is not the relevant source.\n\nIf a person affiliated with a company gives you a gift, both the person and the company are the gift’s sources.\n\nExample. Your best friend’s father works for a company with a corporate apartment. The company allows its employees to stay there while in town for business, but not for any personal use such as a vacation. The company instructs your best friend’s father to offer the apartment to you the next time you are in town. The company, not your best friend’s father, is the gift’s source.\n\nIf multiple people or organizations give you a gift, the gift is from all of the sources collectively. You may not divide the value of a gift between sources to try to fit the gift into an exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample. Two nonprofit organizations that do not employ or retain registered federal lobbyists give you a gift worth $70. You may not divide the gift’s value between the organizations to say each organization gave you a gift worth $35. The gift’s total value is $70.\n\nReturn to top\n\nVI. Recipient of a Gift\n\nYou must look to the intentions of the gift’s donor to determine who is the gift’s “recipient.” If someone brings a gift and says it is “for the office,” then the gift will be considered a gift to everyone in the office who takes advantage of the gift. If someone brings a gift and says it is for a particular person, even if that person shares with others, the gift is a gift just to the original recipient.\n\nExample. A constituent orders pizza for the office. The employees who eat the pizza are the gift’s recipients. See No Thank You Gifts and Exceptions to the Gift Rule for Permissible Gifts for whether staff can accept the pizza.\n\nExample. An organization sends a box of its sample products to the Member. Even though the box’s contents can be separated, because the box was addressed to the Member, the Member is the recipient.\n\nReturn to top\n\nVII. Do Not Ask for a Gift\n\nYou may not ask for a gift for yourself or someone else.[15] Even if you would otherwise be able to accept the gift, you may not accept the gift if you or someone else asked for it. This restriction applies to anything that may benefit the office or you, personally. The Committee does not apply this restriction to requesting gifts from relatives or establishing a gift registry for a special occasion, if the gifts are not for official activities.\n\n[15] 5 U.S.C. § 7353(a). Specifically, you may not solicit anything of value from someone who is seeking official action from or doing business with Congress, or whose interests may be impacted by your official duties. This prohibition does not include solicitations for campaign contributions. See 136 Cong. Rec. H1647 (daily ed. Apr. 24, 1990) (regarding technical corrections to the Ethics Reform Act of 1989); Comm. on Ethics, Member, Officer, and Employee Participation in Fundraising Activities (May 2, 2019). Members and staff may assist with fundraising to benefit political organizations registered under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, including federal and state political organizations. Members and staff may also fundraise directly for state level ballot measure committees that are qualified under state law, but not fundraise for an organization that intends to donate all or some of its proceeds to a state level ballot measure committee. Comm. on Ethics, Member, Officer, and Employee Participation in Fundraising Activities.\n\nClose\n\nExample (Impermissible). You were invited on a privately-sponsored trip. You cannot go, but your colleague can and is interested. You ask the trip sponsor to invite your colleague instead. Because you asked for the gift, your colleague may not accept it. You may, however, tell the trip sponsor that you are no longer the correct contact, but that your colleague now handles the relevant matters.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are out of the office when a group comes to your office with stress balls for everyone. Your desk mate asks if the group could leave one for you. Because your desk mate asked for the gift, you may not accept it.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your office is throwing a farewell party for one of your departing colleagues. You know people in the private sector who might be willing to donate refreshments. You may not request donations from those people.\n\nExample (Permissible). You are buying a new home and need $10,000 for your down payment. You may ask your parents for the money for the down payment, and you may accept the gift if your parents give you the money.\n\nYou may be able to help with solicitation or fundraising efforts that benefit charitable endeavors. You may also be allowed to solicit a gift in connection with the Congressional Art Competition, the App Challenge, or other officially-sanctioned competitions. See Members, Officers, and Employees Participating in Fundraising Activities and Request to Solicit for Officially-Sanctioned Competitions.\n\nReturn to top\n\nVIII. No Bribes, Illegal Gratuities, or Thank You Gifts\n\nA Warning. People can and do face severe criminal penalties for violating these restrictions.[16] Members accused of violating these restrictions have also been expelled from the House or resigned before a final Committee decision was reached.[17]\n\n[16] Punishments for bribery include a fine of up to three times the amount of the bribe, imprisonment up to fifteen years, and disqualification from holding any federal office. See 18 U.S.C. § 201 (b). Punishments for seeking or receiving an illegal gratuity also include a fine and imprisonment up to two years. Id. at (c).\n\nClose\n\nYou may not accept gifts offered in exchange for official actions.[18] The restrictions apply to official actions you are asked to take in the future and in return for official actions you already took. The restrictions apply whether you are engaging in quid pro quo, or just being offered a reward for your official actions.[19] The gift and the official action must have a specific link.[20]\n\n[18] See 5 U.S.C. § 7353(b)(2)(B); 18 U.S.C. § 201. The Committee is aware of recent court decisions that further define the types of official actions covered under 18 U.S.C. § 201. See e.g., McDonnell v. United States, 576 U.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 2355 (2016); United States v. Jefferson, 289 F. Supp. 3d 717 (E.D.V.A. 2017) (vacating a portion of Congressman Jefferson’s convictions following McDonnell v. United States). The Department of Justice enforces this statute; however, the Committee has the authority to investigate actions that violate the House Code of Conduct, House Rule 23, clauses 1 and 2, even if those actions are not prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\n\nClose\n\n[19] Bribery occurs when a federal official “directly, or indirectly, corruptly” receives or asks for “anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for . . . being influenced in the performance of any official act.” Id. at (b)(2)(A). An illegal gratuity results when an official directly or indirectly seeks or receives personally anything of value other than “as provided by law . . . for or because of any official act performed or to be performed.” Id. at (c)(1)(B). Bribery requires a quid pro quo, or “a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act[,]” and illegal gratuity “may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take (and may have already determined to take), or for a past act that he has already taken.” United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers, 526 U.S. 398, 404-405 (1999).\n\nClose\n\n[20] Sun-Diamond Growers, 526 U.S. at 405-408.\n\nClose\n\nYou may still accept gifts that are expressions of goodwill or general appreciation that are not tied to a specific official action.[21] You may also accept token gifts in the form of perishable items like home baked goods or flowers, or decorative items for display in the office or donated to charity.[22]\n\n[21] A true “gift” is a “voluntary transfer” of property, made “without compensation.” Gift, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).\n\nClose\n\n[22] This view is similar to that in the regulations of the Executive Branch’s Office of Government Ethics. See 5 C.F.R. § 2536.206(a)(2) (Example 1).\n\nClose\n\nAdditionally, you may not receive any compensation for assisting people and organizations outside the House with matters before the federal government, or in any particular matter where the federal government is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.[23] You also may not solicit or accept anything of value, including campaign contributions, for helping someone get a federal position.[24] See Outside Employment and Income (page 185) for more information about these prohibitions.\n\n[23] House Members and employees may not accept compensation for representing anyone before a federal department, agency, officer, or court in any particular matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. 18 U.S.C. § 203. Officers and employees have similar restrictions even if they are not receiving compensation. See 18 U.S.C. § 205. These statutes are administered by the Department of Justice, and any advice the Committee provides about these statutes is advisory only.\n\nClose\n\n[24] 18 U.S.C. § 211.\n\nClose\n\nExample (Impermissible). A lobbyist offers a Member a substantial campaign contribution if the Member introduces certain legislation. The lobbyist violated the bribery statute for the offer, and the Member would violate the bribery statute if the Member accepted.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A Member introduces legislation and manages the bill through passage solely because she believes it will benefit the country. A lawyer also favors the legislation because it will benefit his clients. The lawyer sends the Member a book valued at less than $50 with a note that expresses appreciation for the Member’s work on the bill. The Member may not accept the book from the lawyer and must return it to the lawyer.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). A constituent sends the official office an email asking for assistance with a casework matter. In the email, the constituent also offers to make a campaign contribution to the Member’s re-election campaign. The Member may not accept the campaign contribution. Additionally, the Committee recommends the Member or staff contact the constituent to let the constituent know the Member may not accept a campaign contribution associated with casework or any official actions. The Member may perform the casework after contacting the constituent.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). During the holidays a trade association send a Member a fruit basket with a note that says, “Seasons’ Greetings to you and your staff.” The gift is not connected to any official action and may be accepted if it meets one of the Gift Rule exceptions.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A constituent who served on the Member’s service academy nominations panel was so moved by the experience that the constituent offered to give the Member two wine glasses valued at $40 total to the Member as a thank you. The Member may not accept the wine glasses.\n\nExample (Impermissible). An intern in the DC office gave a Capitol tour to visiting constituents. At the end of the tour, the constituents gave the intern a $25 gift card to a local coffee shop as a thank you. The intern must return the gift card to the constituents. The Committee recommends staff who oversees the interns ensure interns are aware of these rules.\n\nExample (Permissible). A caseworker in the district receives a flower arrangement from a local flower shop, sent by a constituent the caseworker helped. The flower arrangement has a card that thanks the caseworker for the casework’s successful outcome. The caseworker may accept the flower arrangement.\n\nExample (Permissible). Following the successful outcome of a casework matter, the constituent gives the caseworker a cake the constituent baked themselves. The caseworker may accept the home baked cake.\n\nExample (Permissible). Same example as above, but instead the constituent embroidered the caseworker's name on a small piece of fabric for display in the official office. The caseworker may accept the embroidered fabric as a token decorative item.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A constituent writes to you asking for an internship in the office and includes a necktie with the internship application. The constituent owns a small business making and selling similar neckties. The necktie is not intended for display in the official office, but rather for you to wear. You may not accept the necktie in connection with the internship request.\n\nReturn to top\n\nIX. Impermissible Gifts\n\nIf you receive a gift you may not accept, you must take the appropriate action to return or pay for the gift. Which action is appropriate depends on the gift’s nature. Your options are discussed below.\n\nReturn to top\n\nA. Decline the Gift\n\nIf someone offers you a gift you either may not accept, or do not want to accept, you may simply decline the gift. See Gifts from Foreign Governments and International Organizations if a foreign government official is offering the gift.\n\nReturn to top\n\nB. Return Gift to Donor\n\nYou may always return a gift to the person who gave it to you, whether the gift does not meet an exception to the Gift Rule, or you simply do not want it. You should return the item promptly.[25] If the gift came to the official office, please contact the Committee on House Administration for ways to pay for return postage.\n\n[25] The Gift Rule restrictions do not apply to anything a Member, officer, or employee does not use and promptly returns to the donor. House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(A).\n\nClose\n\nReturn to top\n\nC. Pay Fair Market Value\n\nIf you receive a gift you may not accept, you may pay fair market value for the gift and keep it.[26] If you pay fair market value, the item will no longer be a gift, but rather a commercial transaction. How the Committee calculates fair market value varies depending on the gift.[27] See How to Value a Gift to determine what amount you should repay.\n\n[26] The Gift Rule does not apply to anything for which a Member, officer, or employee pays market value. House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(A).\n\nClose\n\n[27] Generally, the Committee looks to what would be a reasonable price for something similar in an arms’-length transaction. Any difficulty the recipient may have in paying the fair market value is not a factor in determining how much would need to be repaid. See Comm. on Ethics, In the Matter of Allegations Relating to Representative Jean Schmidt, H.R. Rep. No. 112-195, at 19 (2011).\n\nClose\n\nReturn to top\n\nD. Perishable or Unreturnable Gifts\n\nIf you receive a gift you do not wish to pay for and is impracticable to return because it is perishable, you may donate the gift to a charity or throw it away.[28] You may also donate a tangible item or throw it away if you have made every effort to return it and you cannot find the donor.[29] Donating or destroying a non-perishable tangible gift is an extreme measure. You should make every possible effort to return the gift first.\n\n[28] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(6).\n\nClose\n\n[29] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(6); Comm. on Ethics, In the Matter of Officially-Connected Travel by House Members to Azerbaijan in 2013, H.R.

Please contact the Committee for instructions on sending cash to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nReturn to top\n\nX. General Gift Rule Provisions\n\nThe Gift Rule starts with the premise that you may not accept a gift unless it meets an exception to the Gift Rule.[30] Both the Gift Rule and other sources, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act (FGDA) and the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act (MECEA), provide many exceptions. A gift only needs to meet one exception for you to accept it.[31]\n\n[30] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nClose\n\n[31] For example, if you may accept a book under the informational materials exception, you may accept that book even if the fair market value is more than $50. Because the book meets the exception for informational materials, you also would not have to apply the exception for gifts less than $50 and that book would not count towards the annual limit of less than $100 that goes with the less than $50 per instance exception.\n\nClose\n\nEven if you may be able to accept a gift under a technical reading of any exception discussed below, you should still be mindful of the motives behind any gift. You should always exercise discretion and be careful to avoid even the appearance of impropriety when accepting a gift.[32]\n\n[32] The Office Code of Conduct for the House prohibits Members, officers, and employees from receiving any benefit “by virtue of influence improperly exerted from the position of such individual in Congress.” House Rule 23, cl. 4. Additionally, the Code of Ethics for Government Service states you should “never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept for [yourself] or [your] family, favors or benefits under circumstances [that] might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of [your] governmental duties.” Code of Ethics for Government Service ¶ 5. See also Comm. on Standards of Official Conduct, Investigation of Financial Transactions Participated in and Gifts of Transportation Accepted by Representative Fernand J. St. Germain, H.R. Rep. No. 100-46, at 3, 9, 43 (1987) (“[T]he Committee would admonish all Members to avoid situations in which even an inference might be drawn suggesting improper action.”).\n\nClose\n\nYou should consider the following factors when deciding whether to accept a gift.\n\nWhether the gift meets an exception to the Gift Rule[33]\n\nSource and value of the gift\n\nFrequency of gifts from one source\n\nPossible motives of the donor\n\nPossible conflicts of interest with official duties[34]\n\nWhether accepting the gift violates the spirit of the Gift Rule[35]\n\n[33] See Comm. on Ethics, In the Matter of Allegations Relating to Representative Don Young, H.R. Rep. No. 113-487, at 4 (2014) (issuing a letter of reproval despite repayment because the Member’s acceptance of impermissible gifts “demonstrated a lack of appropriate safeguards and an inattention to the relevant standards of conduct”).\n\nClose\n\n[34] See Comm. on Standards of Official Conduct, In the Matter of Representative Charles H.

Gifts of Nominal Value\n\nYou may accept an item valued at less than $10 ($9.99 or less before tax), or a greeting card, baseball cap, or t-shirt, regardless of the source, with some caveats.[36] The caveats are\n\n[36] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(W). Through the 105th Congress, the Committee allowed Members and staff to accept a variety of low value, tangible items under this provision. At the start of the 106th Congress. however, the House determined that such a broad reading of the nominal value provision was no longer appropriate and instituted the less than $10 limit. H.R. Res. 9, 106th Cong. (1999).\n\nClose\n\nYou may not accept cash or cash equivalents, like gift cards;\n\nYou may not accept food or beverages in a one-on-one setting;[37] and\n\nYou should be mindful of potential conflicts if you are repeatedly offered nominal value gifts from a single source, even if the gifts technically satisfy the requirements of the exception.\n\n[37] Under the Gift Rule prior to the 110th Congress, Members and staff were allowed to accept gifts, including food and refreshments, from virtually anyone under the less than $50 provision, even if the source was a registered federal lobbyist, foreign agent, or organization that employs or retains a registered federal lobbyist. With the Gift Rule amendments in the 110th Congress, the House determined food and refreshments of a nominal value offered by a registered federal lobbyist, foreign agent, or organization that employs or retains a registered federal lobbyist may only be accepted at business meetings, receptions, and similar events that are not one-on-one encounters. H.R. Res. 6, 110th Cong. (2007); Comm. on Standards of Official Conduct, Gift Rule Amendments at the Beginning of the 110th Congress (Feb. 6, 2007).\n\nClose\n\nExample (Permissible). Your local baseball team won the World Series. The baseball team sends you a box with 10 World Series baseball caps with a note for everyone in the office who would like one to take one. You and your colleagues may each accept one baseball cap.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A registered federal lobbyist you work with often invites you to discuss an upcoming bill over a cup of coffee. You may not allow the registered federal lobbyist to pay for your coffee, but you may still meet with the lobbyist and pay for your own coffee.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A constituent sends you a handwritten note thanking you for all your hard work over the years and encloses a $5 gift card. You may keep the handwritten note, but you must return the gift card.\n\nReturn to top\n\nB. Gifts Worth Less Than $50\n\nYou may accept a gift worth less than $50 ($49.99 or less before tax) from someone who is not a registered federal lobbyist, foreign agent, or entity that employs or retains a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent, with some caveats.[38] The caveats are\n\nThe cumulative value of gifts you may accept under this exception in a calendar year from a single source must be less than $100 ($99.99 or less before tax);\n\nA gift worth less than $10 ($9.99 before tax) does not count towards the cumulative limit;\n\nYou may not accept cash or cash equivalents, like gift cards; and\n\nYou may not buy down the gift’s value to get it below $50.\n\nYou do not have to maintain formal records related to gifts you accept under this exception, but you must make a good faith effort to comply with these terms.[39]\n\n[39] Id.\n\nClose\n\nExample (Permissible). You were invited to dinner by a group that does not employ or retain a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent. Your meal and beverages before tax and tip cost $45. You may accept the group’s offer to pay for your meal.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A registered federal lobbyist invites you to dinner and offers to pay. You may not accept the offer, regardless of the meal’s value. You may still go to dinner with the lobbyist and pay for your own meal.\n\nExample (Impermissible). An organization that does not employ or retain a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent offers you tickets to a baseball game with a face value of $65. You may not pay $16 to buy down the value so the gift is less than $50. You must pay the ticket’s entire face value to accept it.\n\nExample (Impermissible). An organization that does not employ or retain a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent has a monthly speaker series over dinner. The dinners are $20 per person. In that calendar year, you already attended four dinners and would now like to attend a fifth dinner. Because the fifth dinner’s value would make a total of $100 in cumulative yearly gifts from that organization, you may not accept the fifth dinner, nor may you pay $1 to bring the cumulative value to $99. You may still attend the event and pay for your own dinner.\n\nReturn to top\n\nC. Gifts from Relatives\n\nYou may accept anything that a relative offers you, if your relative is the source of the gift, and not merely passing along a gift from someone else.[40] The following individuals are your relatives.\n\n[40] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(C) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. app. § 109(16)).\n\nClose\n\nParent\n\nChild\n\nSibling\n\nAunt or Uncle\n\nGreat Aunt or Great Uncle\n\nFirst Cousin\n\nNiece or Nephew\n\nSpouse[41]\n\nFiancé(e)\n\nGrandparent\n\nGrandchild\n\nMother or Father-in-Law\n\nDaughter or Son-in-Law\n\nSister or Brother-in-Law\n\nStepparent\n\nStepchild\n\nStepsibling\n\nHalf sibling\n\nGrandparent of your spouse[42]\n\n[41] A spouse is someone to whom you are legally married.\n\nClose\n\n[42] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(C); 5 U.S.C. app. § 109(16).\n\nClose\n\nIf a person is not on this list, such as a second cousin or a godparent, you may be able to accept a gift under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your parents offer to buy you a car using their personal funds. You may accept the car.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your grandparents offer to pay off your student loans by writing you a check. You may accept the check from your grandparents.\n\nExample (Permissible). You received Committee approval to accept a trip from your significant other to whom you are not engaged or married. While on that trip, your significant other proposes and presents you with an engagement ring. Once you accept the proposal, you may also accept the engagement ring as a gift from your now fiancé(e).\n\nExample (Permissible). Your grandmother wants to give you her heirloom dining room table. You may accept the table. See Bequests and Inheritances if your grandmother wishes to leave you the table in her will.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your long-time family friend gives your parents a gift to give to you. Because your long-time family friend is really the gift’s source, and your parents are just passing the gift along, you may not accept the gift as one from a relative. You may be able to accept the gift under a different gift exception.\n\nReturn to top\n\nD. Gifts Based on Personal Friendship\n\nYou may be able to accept a gift that is offered because of personal friendship and not related to your position with the House.[43] This exception does not require that you be friends with someone before you joined the House, nor does it prohibit friendships with registered federal lobbyists or foreign agents. But you should always be mindful of why you were offered the gift and who the true source of the gift may be.\n\n[43] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(D).\n\nClose\n\nIf the gift’s fair market value exceeds $250, you must seek formal Committee approval to accept a gift offered because of personal friendship, even if the gift meets all the requirements discussed below. If the fair market value of a gift is $250 or less, you may decide for yourself if the gift meets the requirements. The Committee views trips as a whole; therefore, the value of a trip would be the transportation expenses, lodging expenses, and meal expenses that someone else offers to pay on your behalf. You can find the form to request approval from the Committee to accept the gift based on personal friendship here. The Committee will consider your request through its formal advisory opinion process. If you can, please submit your request early to give the Committee enough time to review, analyze, and make a decision.\n\nTo accept a gift under personal friendship, you must consider the circumstances of the offer, including, but not limited to\n\nthe nature of your relationship with your friend, including any past exchange of gifts;\n\nif your friend paid or will pay for the gift personally, or if your friend will seek a business reimbursement or tax deduction; and\n\nif the same or similar gift was or will be offered to another Member, officer, or employee.[44]\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). Your former roommate is now a registered federal lobbyist. For years you have gone to basketball games together. Sometimes you would pay for the tickets and sometimes your former roommate would pay for the tickets. Your former roommate has an extra ticket to a playoff game that your roommate paid for personally and invites you to come. Because you and your former roommate have been friends for a while, have a history of exchanging gifts, and your former roommate paid for the extra ticket personally, you may be able to accept the ticket. Depending on the ticket’s fair market value, you may need to seek Committee approval before accepting it.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are friendly with a registered federal lobbyist who often comes to your office and whom you see at official events. You do not socialize with the lobbyist outside of work. The lobbyist invites you to dinner at their personal expense. Because you do not have a friendship relationship with the lobbyist, you may not allow the lobbyist to pay for your dinner. You are welcome to still go to dinner with the lobbyist and pay for your own meal and drinks.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A person you recently met asked you out on a first date and offers to pay. Other than meeting this person previously, you have not socialized with the person. You believe you were asked out because of where you work. You may not accept the offer to pay for the first date under personal friendship. If you develop a relationship with this person, you may be able to accept future offers to pay for dates. If the person is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent, you may accept the offer if the date’s total value before tax and tip is $49.99 or less.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). Your significant other, to whom you are not engaged or married,[45] surprises you with a trip abroad for your birthday. Your significant other offers to pay for flights, lodging, and meals while you are on the trip. Because the trip’s value likely exceeds $250, you will need to seek Committee approval before accepting your significant other’s offer.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). You and your significant other take a trip. You both pay your own way. While on the trip, your significant other purchases a piece of art worth more than $250 for your birthday and has it shipped to your home. The gift was spontaneous, and you did not have the opportunity to request Committee approval beforehand. You may request retroactive approval to accept the piece of art. If the Committee does not approve your request for some reason, you may pay your significant other back for the piece of art.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your best friend works for a lobbying firm. The lobbying firm is having their holiday party and all their employees can bring a guest. The lobbying firm does not place restrictions on whom the guest can be. Your best friend asks you to be their guest. Because your best friend can bring whomever they want, the gift is your best friend’s to offer. If the per person value of the food and drinks for the holiday party is less than $250, you may accept your best friend’s offer to attend the holiday party.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your roommate works for a downtown law firm. The law firm has a box at a major league baseball stadium. The law firm allows its staff to bring a guest to the baseball games and sit in the firm’s box. The law firm does not place restrictions on whom the guest can be. Your roommate invites you to the game as their guest. Because your roommate can bring whomever they want, you may accept and sit in the law firm’s box at the baseball game.\n\nReturn to top\n\nE. Gifts from other Members, Officers, or Employees\n\nYou may accept a gift from another Member, officer, or employee of the House or Senate if the person giving you the gift is either your direct or indirect supervisor or your peer.[46] You may not accept a gift from someone you supervise unless the gift is given for a special occasion.[47] Special occasions include birthdays, holidays, marriages, births or adoption of children, anniversaries, retirements, deaths, and other similar occasions for which gifts are traditionally given. You should never be pressured to make or contribute to a gift.\n\n[46] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(F).\n\nClose\n\n[47] See 5 U.S.C. § 7351(a) (a federal employee may not give a superior a gift, solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to a superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay). The Committee has the authority to implement this section, including to allow for gifts to superiors for special occasions. Id. at (c).\n\nClose\n\nProviding personal services without compensation may also be a gift.[48] Supervisors should not accept uncompensated personal services from subordinate staff for services the supervisor would usually pay for if there is no connection to legitimate, official activity.[49]\n\n[48] See Staff of Comm on Ethics, 115th Cong., In the Matter of Allegations Relating to Representative Thomas Garrett 5, 32-34 (Comm. Print 2019).\n\nClose\n\n[49] Id. at 34.\n\nClose\n\nExample (Permissible). You are a district caseworker working part time while also going to school. Your employing Member and your Chief of Staff would like to use their personal funds to help you pay for textbooks. You may accept that gift from your supervisors.\n\nExample (Permissible). A Member wants to give all her colleagues a copy of a book that helped inform her policy positions. The Member would like to use personal funds to purchase those books. The other Members may accept that book as a gift from their peer.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your Chief of Staff is getting married. Everyone in the office would like to contribute to a gift card to your Chief of Staff’s favorite restaurant as a wedding gift. If no one feels pressured to contribute, you may pool your funds and give the gift card to your Chief of Staff. Your Chief of Staff may also accept the gift card for this special occasion.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your employing Member completed the first session of their first term in office. The staff would like to contribute to a gift to celebrate your Member’s first year in office. Your Member may not accept that gift from the staff because it is not a special occasion for which gifts are traditionally given.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your employing Member asks you to pick up their children from school. Because this activity bears no connection to legitimate, official activity, you should not perform this service for your employing Member.\n\nReturn to top\n\nF. Gifts of Personal Hospitality\n\nYou may stay in someone’s home or personally-owned facility, or eat a meal at someone’s home, as long as the person who offers the personal hospitality is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent.[50] You may not accept the offer of personal hospitality if the purpose is business-related or the property is used for a business purpose, such as being rented out to others.[51]\n\n[50] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(P) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. app. § 109(14)). If the individual providing the gift is reimbursed by a business or seeks a business expense deduction for the hospitality, that hospitality is a business expense and not personal hospitality. Bipartisan Task Force Report, 135 Cong. Rec. 30743. Similarly, any property or facilities owned by a corporation or a firm, even if the individual providing the gift is the sole owner of the corporation or firm, are not personally owned by the individual and may not be used for personal hospitality.\n\nClose\n\n[51] Id.; 5 U.S.C. app. § 109(14) (“[H]ospitality extended for a non-business purpose by an individual, not a corporation or organization, at the personal residence of that individual or his family or on property or facilities owned by that individual or his family.”). See, e.g., Comm. on Ethics, In the Matter of Allegations Relating to Representative Don Young, H.R. Rep. No. 113-487, at 38, 57, 61 (2014) (discussing various trips taken by Representative Young that did and did not meet the exception for personal hospitality).\n\nClose\n\nThis exception only applies to lodging and meals in the home or personally-owned facility. The exception does not apply to meals at restaurants while visiting someone, nor to someone paying for your hotel room while visiting. Those gifts may be allowed under separate exceptions.\n\nExample (Permissible). You are going to visit your college roommate, who offers to let you stay in their apartment. Your college roommate personally rents the apartment and is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent. You may accept your college roommate’s offer to stay in their apartment, and you may accept any meals your college roommate may make for you in their apartment.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your friend owns a beach house and offers to let you and your family stay there for a week. Your friend rents out the beach house on a weekly basis. Because the beach house is used for a business purpose, you may not accept your friend’s offer as personal hospitality. See Gifts Based on Personal Friendship for an exception that may apply.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You were invited to an “off-the-record” dinner at a local philanthropist’s home. The dinner’s purpose is to discuss policy initiatives on which the philanthropist works. Even if the philanthropist is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent, you may not accept the meal as personal hospitality because the dinner has a business purpose. See Free Attendance at Events for other ways you may be able to accept the offer.\n\nExample (Permissible in Part). You recently met someone at a party locally with whom you spent most of your time sharing your love of skiing. Your new acquaintance invited you to spend the weekend at their condominium in Colorado to go skiing. Your new acquaintance also offered to pay for your lift tickets and take you out to some local restaurants. Your new acquaintance is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent and personally owns the condominium. Your new acquaintance does not rent out the condominium. You may accept the lodging in the condominium over the weekend, but you may not accept the lift tickets or the meals at the local restaurants as personal hospitality.\n\nExample (Permissible). A constituent knows that you like to duck hunt. The constituent personally owns a piece of property with a lake where the constituent often goes to duck hunt and allows his friends to duck hunt as well. The constituent does not charge others to hunt on his property. The constituent is not a registered federal lobbyist or foreign agent. The constituent offers to bring you along the next time he goes hunting. You may accept the constituent’s offer.\n\nReturn to top\n\nG. Gifts from Federal, State, or Local Governments\n\nYou may accept anything that is paid for by the federal government, a state or local government, or secured under a contract with the federal government.[52] The domestic government agency or entity must directly pay for the gift and may not merely be a conduit for someone else.[53]\n\n[52] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(O). “Government contracts” under this provision mean federal government contracts. See, e.g., 5 C.F.R. § 2635.203(7); 57 Fed. Reg. 35,014 (Aug. 7, 1992) (“The exclusion is intended to cover items the Government procures for use by its employees under a Government contract or knowingly obligates itself to pay for.”).\n\nClose\n\n[53] See Comm. on Rules, Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to Provide for Gift Reform, H.R.

The Committee also does not consider Native American tribes to be foreign governments. Additionally, many Native American tribes employ or retain registered federal lobbyists. Your ability to accept gifts from those Native American tribes will be limited by the Gift Rule exceptions relevant to organizations that employ or retain registered federal lobbyists.\n\nClose\n\n[58] “Amtrak is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government . . .” 49 U.S.C. § 24301(a)(3).\n\nClose\n\nThese lists are not exhaustive.

A private university offers you tickets to an upcoming football game. You may not accept the tickets as a gift from a state government, but you may be able to accept the tickets under a different exception.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). The company running a national lab invites you to tour its facility and offers to take you out to lunch afterwards to discuss your observations.

If not, you may be able to accept under a different exception.\n\nReturn to top\n\nH. Gifts from Foreign Governments and International Organizations\n\nThe Emoluments Clause of the Constitution limits your ability to accept gifts from foreign governments. The Emoluments Clause prohibits you, as a federal government official, from receiving “any present . . . of any kind whatever” from a foreign government or its representatives without the consent of Congress.[59]\n\n[59] U.S. Const. Art. I, § 9, cl. 8.\n\nClose\n\nCongress consented to gifts, including travel, from foreign governments by enacting two federal statutes, FGDA and MECEA.[60] House rules also allow you to accept gifts under these two statutes.[61] See Travel Paid for by a Foreign Government for more information about travel allowed under FGDA and MECEA.\n\n[60] Congress consented to other programs outside of FGDA and MECEA, including the U.S.-Korea National Assembly Exchange Program. However, FGDA and MECEA are the most common methods that foreign governments use to offer Members, officers, and employees gifts and travel.\n\nClose\n\n[61] Members, officers, and employees may accept “[a]n item, the receipt of which is authorized by the [FGDA], the [MECEA], or any other statute.” House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(N).\n\nClose\n\nFGDA also allows you to accept certain tangible gifts and decorations from the following entities.\n\nForeign governments;\n\nInternational or multinational organizations whose membership is made of units of foreign governments and their agents or representatives;\n\nQuasi-governmental organizations closely affiliated with, or funded by, foreign governments; or\n\nPrivate organizations closely affiliated with, or funded by, foreign governments.[62]\n\n[62] 5 U.S.C. § 7342(a)(2). To determine whether an organization is part of a foreign government, the Committee looks to a number of factors including the level to which the organization is funded by the federal government, whether the organization is controlled by a foreign government, and whether another U.S. government agency determined the organization is part of a foreign government. Members, officers, and employees may only accept gifts from organizations that meet this definition under FGDA or MECEA.

If you are unsure of the value, the Office of the Clerk can appraise the item.[68] Tangible gifts include trinkets, meals, entertainment, or local transportation to attend an event.\n\n[66] 5 U.S.C. § 7342 (c)(1)(A).\n\nClose\n\n[67] 5 U.S.C. § 7342(a)(5).\n\nClose\n\n[68] 5 U.S.C. § 7342(g)(2)(B); (a)(6)(A).\n\nClose\n\nIf you are abroad, you may accept tangible gifts worth more than minimal value if refusing the gift would cause offense or embarrassment. But you accept those gifts on behalf of the United States government and must turn over the gifts when you return to the United States, report the gifts on the FGDA Disclosure Form, and seek Committee approval if you would like to retain the gifts for official display purposes.\n\nYou must aggregate the value of tangible gifts given to you in the same presentation from the same source to determine if the group of gifts is more than minimal value. You must also aggregate gifts given in the same presentation from the spouse of a foreign official as well as the foreign official themselves.

A foreign government wants to present you with its highest civilian honor for your assistance to their country. The decoration is less than minimal value. You may accept, wear, and retain the decoration for your personal use.\n\nExample (Permissible). The same foreign government wishes to present you with the same award, but the decoration is more than minimal value. You seek and receive approval from the Committee before accepting the decoration. You may accept the decoration, wear the decoration, and retain the decoration for your personal use.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). Same as the previous example but you did not seek and receive approval from the Committee before accepting the decoration. You may accept the decoration on behalf of the United States, but you must turn it over to the Clerk of the House or seek Committee approval to display it in your official office.\n\niii. Medical Treatment[70]\n\n[70] 5 U.S.C. § 7342(c)(1)(B).\n\nClose\n\nYou may accept medical treatment from a foreign government if the treatment is provided for an unexpected illness or injury that requires immediate attention while in the host country. You may also accept medical treatment from a foreign government if you seek and receive Committee approval prior to accepting the treatment.\n\nExample (Permissible). You break your leg while on vacation abroad. The foreign government offers to pay to have your leg set so you can fly home. You may accept the offer of medical treatment.\n\niv. Educational Scholarship[71]\n\n[71] Id.\n\nClose\n\nYou may accept an educational scholarship from a foreign government if you seek and receive Committee approval prior to accepting the scholarship. You may not accept transportation to and from the United States under this exception unless transportation is a term of the scholarship.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). You are offered a scholarship to study at a foreign public academic institution abroad. The scholarship covers travel to and from the United States, plus tuition and room and board for the academic year. The public academic institution and the scholarship are funded by the foreign government. You must receive Committee approval before accepting the scholarship.[72]\n\nv. Reporting Requirements\n\nIf you received gifts or travel from a foreign government under FGDA, you must report those gifts on a separate form and return the form to the Committee.[73] If you accepted in-country travel expenses, regardless of value, you must return the form to the Committee within 30 days of returning from your trip. If you accepted gifts or decorations of more than minimal value, you must return the form to the Committee within 60 days of receiving the gift or decoration. You can find the form here.\n\n[73] The Department of State makes FGDA disclosures public in the Federal Register each year. 5 U.S.C. § 7342(f)(1).\n\nClose\n\nIf you file financial disclosure statements, you must also report tangible gifts, decorations, medical treatment, or educational scholarships of more than minimal value on your annual financial disclosure statement.\n\nReturn to top\n\nI. Home State Products\n\nYou may accept tangible products that are manufactured, produced, or grown in your home state.[74] These products must be intended to promote your state, and be for display or distribution to visitors in your office.[75] The home state products should be of nominal value, less than $10, to each recipient. Home state products that are more than nominal value may be displayed in a public area of your office.\n\n[74] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(V). Home state products can be manufactured, produced, or grown anywhere in your state, not just your district. This provision does not include items that are merely distributed in your state, but are manufactured, produced, or grown elsewhere.\n\nClose\n\n[75] The Committee understands Members and staff may occasionally avail themselves of individually packaged home state products. The home state product exception does not prohibit occasional use, but individually packaged home state products must be intended for, and actually distributed to, visitors to your office.\n\nClose\n\nHome state products may not be traded between offices, including for intern or staff labor to assist with projects.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your state is known for growing peanuts. A peanut farmer in your state sends your office three large boxes of single serving sized peanuts. You may accept those peanuts and place them in your office reception area for visitors to take.\n\nExample (Impermissible). That same peanut farmer sends you a large tin of peanuts intended just for your consumption. You may not accept the peanuts as a home state product, but you may be able to accept them under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Permissible). An aerospace company makes rocket engines in your state. They send you a scale model of one of the rocket engines. You may accept the scale model and place it in your office reception area for visitors to see.\n\nExample (Permissible). The holidays are approaching, and a local tree farmer offers to send you a Christmas tree. You may accept the tree and put it on display in your office reception area for visitors to see.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your state invested heavily in its wine-producing regions and a local winery would like to send you six bottles of wine for display. You may accept the bottles and put them on display in your office reception area. Please contact the Office of General Counsel at 202-225-9700 for guidance about providing alcohol on House grounds.\n\nExample (Permissible). A soda manufacturer has a bottling plant in your state and offers you single-serving cans of the various sodas it bottles at its plant. You may accept the cans of soda.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). A well-known ice cream producer is in your state. The company offers to provide you with single-serving sized ice cream cups and a freezer to keep them in. You may accept the ice cream as a home state product. You may also accept the freezer on loan from the company. See Artwork and Other Gifts of Unusual Nature on Loan to the House for the requirements of the loan agreement.\n\nReturn to top\n\nJ. Free Attendance at Events\n\nThe events discussed below can be held in-person or virtually. A virtual event, including a webinar or a live-stream event, must still meet the criteria discussed below. If an event is held virtually, you may not accept a gift card or meal voucher in place of food for events under these exceptions. If you are offered free attendance at an event for yourself and a guest, which otherwise complies with the House Gift Rule, you may accept the offer for any kind of guest.[76]\n\n[76] Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\ni. Receptions\n\nYou and a guest may attend an event if only nominal value food and drink that is not a meal is served.[77] Events that fall in this category are often evening receptions with light to medium appetizers or hors d’oeuvres, briefings over coffee and pastries or bagels, and afternoon briefings with snacks, such as cookies or chips.[78] The Committee does not assign a per person dollar limit, but you should be mindful of not accepting food and beverages in excess of these examples. For example, a reception serving only high-cost items like champagne and caviar or a 25-year Scotch tasting would not be nominal value. Low-cost meals, like pizza, hot dogs, or sandwiches, are still meals that you may not accept under this exception to the Gift Rule. You may be able to accept those meals under different event exceptions.\n\n[77] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(U); Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\n[78] See Comm. on Rules, Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to Provide for Gift Reform, H.R.

However, background music played by famous musicians, or a reception that is really a concert may change the event’s nature.\n\nExample (Permissible). You receive an invitation to an evening event with cocktails and finger foods. The event will have tables and plates for your food. You may attend the event, regardless of who invited you.\n\nExample (Permissible). You receive an invitation to the same event, and the invitation includes the ability to bring one guest. You may attend the event and bring anyone you like as your guest.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Your colleague forwards you an invitation to an event they will be attending. The event will feature a carving station, salad station, and a collection of breads. Because this event will offer a meal, it is not a reception.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are invited to lunch briefing and the organization sponsoring the briefing plans to pass out boxed lunches. Because this event will offer a meal, even though a low-cost meal, it is not a reception.\n\nExample (Permissible). You are invited to an evening reception with appetizers and background music played by a jazz quartet. You may attend the event.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are invited to an evening reception with appetizers and music performed by last year’s Grammy winner for best artist. The Grammy winner will sing for two hours. Although the food and drink are nominal value, the event’s nature is a concert and is not a reception.\n\nii. Widely-Attended Events\n\nYou and a guest may accept an unsolicited offer of free attendance for a widely-attended event for you and one guest.[79] “Free attendance” includes all or part of the cost of admission; local transportation to and from the event; and the food, refreshments, entertainment, and instructional materials provided to all event attendees.[80] Free attendance does not include entertainment collateral to the event or food and refreshments outside the group setting of the event, such as giveaways.[81] Your guest may be anyone, as long as the event organizer offered you an unsolicited second ticket.[82]\n\n[79] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(4)(A); (B); Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\n[80] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(4)(D).\n\nClose\n\n[81] Id.

Remember, an event may be a widely-attended event for you but may not be a widely-attended event for your colleague. The three criteria are\n\nYou are invited by the event organizer directly;\n\nThe event organizer is the organization(s) doing the work to put the event on, not a monetary event sponsor or table sponsor.[83]\n\nThe event organizer has a reasonable expectation that at least 25 people will also attend who are not Members, Senators, officers, or employees of Congress or their spouses; and[84]\n\nThose 25 attendees must come from a variety of backgrounds, including the Executive Branch, but may not solely be the employees of a single organization.\n\nYour attendance is related to your official or representational duties.\n\nYou could be speaking in your official capacity, learning about a topic that will assist your work with the House, or meeting with constituents.\n\nWhether your participation is related to your official or representational duties is a decision for you and your superiors, if any, to make.\n\nPurely entertainment, personal pleasure, professional development, or charitable activities are not related to your official or representational duties.[85]\n\nMerely watching a feature film, a sporting event, or show is generally purely entertainment.\n\n[83] “Event organizer” and “event sponsor,” as those terms relate to events, mean “the person, entity, or entities that are primarily responsible for organizing the event. An individual who simply contributes money to an event is not considered to be a sponsor of the event.” Comm. on Rules, Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to Provide for Gift Reform, H.R. Rep. No. 104-337, at 12 (1995). Gold or silver level sponsors or table sponsors are not included in the definition of event organizer or event sponsor for the purposes of these exceptions to the Gift Rule. But, there may be more than one event organizer if those entities “play[] significant, active role[s] in organizing the event in a manner that is roughly comparable” to another event organizer or sponsor.

No. 104-337, at 12 (1995).\n\nClose\n\nOrganizations that provide only financial assistance to the event organizer but are not assisting with the logistics for the event may still want to invite you. You may not accept an invitation from these organizations directly. The fiscal sponsors may instead request the event organizer invite you directly. You may only accept that invitation if\n\nThe event organizer retains ultimate control over the guest list and seating arrangements, and\n\nThe event organizer is the only entity listed on the invitation and the only entity extending the invitation.\n\nYou may accept an invitation to a large media-related event, such as the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner or the Washington Press Club Foundation’s Annual Congressional Dinner, if you are invited by a member of the media organization sponsoring the event.\n\nExample (Permissible). You are a legislative assistant focused on environmental policy. Your colleague is also a legislative assistant but focused on banking issues. You both receive an invitation to a large environmental policy conference, and the event organizer offers you free attendance. In years past, over 500 people from across government and industry have attended this conference. After discussing the conference with your supervisor, you may accept the invitation, but your colleague likely may not.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Same example as above, but a large corporation is underwriting the conference and sends you the invitation. The corporate sponsor has no role in planning, organizing, or executing the conference. You may not accept the invitation from the corporate sponsor.\n\nExample (Impermissible). While at the conference, you are invited to an after-hours dinner put on by one of the advocacy organizations active on environmental policy. The after-hours dinner is not part of the free attendance offered by the conference organizer. You may be able to accept the offer if the after-hours dinner meets a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Impermissible). The owner of a local sports team offers you a ticket to an upcoming game. Although many people will be in attendance, the game is not a widely-attended event because it is purely for entertainment purposes.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your district is home to a large annual rodeo that is very important to the district’s financial health. The organization that puts on the rodeo offered you two tickets and seats in a prominent location so the event organizer can recognize you. You may reasonably determine your attendance is related to your official or representational duties and accept both tickets.\n\niii. Events with Constituent Groups\n\nYou and a guest may attend events that include meals with constituent groups that do not meet the 25 non-Congressional attendance requirement of widely-attended events, if the events meet the following criteria.[86]\n\n[86] The Committee granted this general waiver pursuant to its waiver authority in House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(T). The Committee did so because it recognized the Gift Rule was not intended to interfere with Members carrying out their conventional representational duties, and that meetings or events with constituent organizations may sometimes be attended by only a few constituents, particularly when the organization is from a state with a small or diffuse population.The Committee also used its waiver authority to allow Members and staff to bring one guest, if invited. Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\nThe event is regularly scheduled;\n\nThe event is related to your official or representation duties; and\n\nThe event is open to members of the constituent group, rather than just its officers or board members.\n\nYou may accept an invitation that meets the above criteria from the following event organizers. This list is not exhaustive.\n\nCivic associations\n\nSenior citizens organizations\n\nVeterans’ groups\n\nBusiness, trade, or professional associations\n\nFor example, associations of lawyers, nurses, bankers, teachers, or farmers\n\nExample (Permissible). You are invited to a lunch meeting of a civic association in your district. The lunch meeting is a periodic meeting open to all of the civic association’s members, but only 15 are expected to attend. If you determine your attendance is related to your official or representational duties, you may accept the invitation.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A veterans’ group in your district would like to have an event honoring your upcoming retirement. Only 10 members of the group will be able to attend. Because the event is not regularly scheduled, you would not be able to accept the invitation under this exception. You may be able to accept it under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Permissible). Your teachers’ association is hosting its annual Washington fly-in. All association members are welcome to participate in the trip, and usually about 20 members come to Washington. One of the events during the fly-in is a dinner with the congressional delegation. If you determine your attendance is related to your official or representational duties, you may accept the dinner. If offered, you may also bring one guest of your choosing.\n\nExample (Impermissible). Same example as above, but only one association member from your district attends the fly-in and would like to take you out to lunch separate from the group. Because the lunch is not an association event, you may not accept the lunch under this exception. You may be able to accept the lunch under a separate exception to the Gift Rule.\n\niv. Educational Events\n\nYou and a guest may attend events that include meals designed for small group discussion that do not meet the 25 non-Congressional attendance requirement of widely-attended events, if the events meet the following criteria.[87]\n\n[87] The Committee granted this general waiver pursuant to its waiver authority in House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(T). The Committee did so because it recognized there are certain events that are worthwhile for Members and staff to attend, but that do not meet the numeric requirements for widely-attended events. The Committee also used its waiver authority to allow Members and staff to bring one guest, if invited. Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\nThe event is educational, such as a lecture, seminar, or discussion;\n\nThe event is hosted by a university, foundation, think tank, or similar nonprofit, non-advocacy organization; and\n\nYou are invited by the event organizer directly.\n\nYou may not accept a meal at educational events organized by registered federal lobbyists or foreign agents, organizations that employ or retain registered federal lobbyists or foreign agents, or advocacy groups. You also may not accept a meal at educational events that are legislative briefings or strategy sessions, even if the organization hosting the event has an educational status under the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nExample (Permissible). You are invited to a luncheon series hosted by a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank. The luncheon series features distinguished speakers from academia discussing foreign policy updates. The think tank invited about 15 people, some of whom are Members and staff. You may accept the invitation and the luncheon. If offered, you may also bring one guest of your choosing.\n\nExample (Permissible in Part). A trade association establishes a nonprofit educational foundation. The foundation sponsors a monthly series at which experts from the field explain aspects of their industry and the ramifications of various legislative proposals for that industry. You and a dozen other House staff are invited to these presentations, which occur over lunch. You may attend the event, but you may not accept the meal because these events are legislative briefings. You may be able to accept the meal under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nv. Training in the Interest of the House\n\nYou and a guest may accept free attendance to training that is in the interest of the House.[88] You may also accept any food or refreshments offered to all attendees as part of the training.[89] Generally, trainings “in the interest of the House” are trainings like vendor trainings on how to use a product.\n\n[88] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(3)(L); Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).\n\nClose\n\n[89] Id.\n\nClose\n\nThese trainings are generally not provided by outside organizations looking to share their views with you and influence your policy decisions. You may not accept meals in connection with presentations made by registered federal lobbyists, foreign agents, organizations that employ or retain registered federal lobbyists or foreign agents, or advocacy groups. You also may not accept meals in connection with briefings or discussions relating to issues before Congress.\n\nExample (Permissible). The company that your office uses for managing constituent communications is hosting a training session in the Rayburn Gold Room to promote its product and provide hands-on assistance to current and potential clients. The company plans to offer boxed lunches to everyone who attends. You may attend the training and accept the boxed lunch.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A think-tank would like to host an event where it shares the results from a recent poll and discusses how those results can inform policy decisions. The think tank plans to offer a boxed lunch to everyone who attends. You may not attend this event under this exception to the Gift Rule. But you may be able to attend under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nvi. Charity Events\n\nYou and a guest may accept an unsolicited offer of free attendance for a charity fundraising event. [90] “Free attendance” includes all or part of the cost of admission; local transportation to and from the event; and the food, refreshments, entertainment, and instructional materials provided to all event attendees.[91] Free attendance does not include entertainment collateral to the event or food and refreshments outside the group setting of the event, such as giveaways.[92]\n\n[90] House Rule 25, cl. 5(a)(4)(C); Comm. on Ethics, Guest Policy Change and Reminder of Gift Rules for Attendance at Events (Sept. 19, 2022).

A local company invites you to its casino night whose proceeds will be donated to a § 501(c)(3) charity in the district. Because you were invited by the event organizer and the primary purpose is to raise funds for a charity, you may accept the invitation.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A local organization has both a § 501(c)(3) arm and a § 501(c)(4) arm. The organization is hosting its annual fundraising dinner and those who purchase tickets or wish to donate more than the ticket price can choose whether their donations will benefit the § 501(c)(3) or the § 501(c)(4). Because the event’s primary purpose is not to raise funds for an organization qualified under § 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, this event is not a charity fundraiser.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A local company invites you to its casino night. If any money is left over after the company pays its expenses, it plans to donate the excess to a local § 501(c)(3) charity in the district. Because the primary purpose of this event is not to raise funds for an organization qualified under § 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, this event is not a charity fundraiser.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A lobbying firm wishes to hold a dinner for Members and staff, at which it will announce that the firm made a substantial donation to a local charity. This event is not a charity fundraiser because its primary purpose is not to raise funds for that charity.\n\nExample (Impermissible). A local theater is organized as a § 501(c)(3) charity. The chairman of the board for the local theater invites you to a regular performance. This event is not a charity fundraiser because its primary purpose is not to raise funds for the charity. A separately scheduled fundraiser for the theater may be considered a charity fundraiser.\n\nExample (Permissible in Part). A § 501(c)(3) charity is hosting an evening fundraising reception, followed by a board meeting over dinner. You may accept an invitation for the fundraising reception, but not stay for the board meeting, because the board meeting’s primary purpose is not to raise funds for the charity. You may be able to attend the board meeting and accept the meal under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Impermissible). An advocacy organization you work with often purchased a table at a charity fundraiser organized by another organization. The advocacy organization invites you to be its guest and sit at its table. You may not accept the ticket from the advocacy organization under this exception.\n\nExample (Permissible). An event organizer offers you two tickets to its upcoming charity fundraiser. You would like to bring your adult child as your guest. You may use the second ticket to bring your adult child.\n\nYou may be able to accept travel to attend a charity fundraiser. See Travel to Attend Charity Fundraisers.\n\nvii. Events Sponsored by Political Organizations\n\nYou may accept an offer of free attendance to a political fundraiser or other campaign event organized by the political organization.[95] Free attendance to a political event includes the cost of admission, food, refreshments, entertainment, and other benefits provided by the political organization, including unsolicited offers of free attendance for guests.[96] You may be able to accept transportation and lodging if the offer complies with the requirements in Travel for Political Purposes.

You may not accept the invitation from the state party.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are invited to a fundraiser for a § 501(c)(4) organization. Because the event does not benefit a political organization, you may not accept the invitation under this exception.\n\nExample (Impermissible). You are invited to a fundraiser for your employing Member by a campaign donor who purchased the ticket for you. You may not accept the ticket because it did not come from a political organization. You also may not pay for the ticket because it is a fundraiser for your employing Member. You may be able to accept the ticket under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nviii. Events in Honor of Members, Officers, and Employees\n\nEvents that outside organizations put on nominally in your honor are not gifts to you, although free attendance at the event would still be a gift. To be “nominally” in your honor, the event must meet the following criteria.[100]\n\n[100] An event could nominally be in honor of a single Member, officer, or employee, or a group. For example, an event could be in honor of a caucus or a staff association.\n\nClose\n\nThe event organizer is clear to all participants, such as at the top of the invitation;\n\nYou are not a host or sponsor of the event;\n\nYou do not receive any particular benefit from the event;\n\nYou did not ask the event organizer to host the event; and\n\nYou did not solicit support for the event.\n\nIf the event does not meet the criteria above, the event’s entire cost would be a gift to you.\n\nExample (Permissible). An advocacy group that works on environmental issues wants to host a reception in your honor because of your work on environmental issues. The advocacy group will handle all the logistics for the event. They may host the reception in your honor and you may attend if your free attendance meets the Gift Rule exceptions for that type of event.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). At that same event, the advocacy group wishes to showcase your nature photography and offer it for sale. Because you would receive a benefit from the event, the event’s entire cost would be a gift to you. You may be able to accept the gift of the event under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). You are retiring at the end of the Congress. A local nonprofit in your district wants to host a retirement event in your honor. The event will be a fundraiser for the nonprofit, and you will be required to help fundraise for the event. Because you are asked to solicit support for the event, the event’s entire cost would be a gift to you. You may be able to accept the gift of the event under a different exception to the Gift Rule.\n\nExample (Additional Action Required). Your friends would like to host a retirement party in your honor. They ask to hold the event at your home, but they plan to handle all the other logistics. Because you would provide in-kind support for the event, the event’s entire cost would be a gift to you. You may be able to accept the event as a gift based on personal friendship.\n\nix. Inaugural and Swearing-In Events\n\nYou may wish to host or attend a Presidential Inaugural event or a Congressional Swearing-In event. The rules for hosting or attending these events are the same as for all other events. An offer of free attendance at an inaugural or swearing-in event must comply with an exception to the Gift Rule depending on the type of event—widely-attended event, charity fundraiser, political event, or reception. Additionally, if the event is nominally in your honor, you may not be involved in putting on the event. See Events in Honor of Members, Officers, or Employees.\n\nIf you wish to host a swearing-in event or a reception for visitors from your district, see Conferences and Town Hall Meetings (page 340).\n\nx. Events During National Political Conventions\n\nMembers may not attend some events during the national political conventions, even if attendance would otherwise meet an exception to the Gift Rule or if the Member purchased a ticket.[101] During the dates of the national political convention to select the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates of your party, a Member may not participate in or attend an event held in their honor, if the event is paid for by a registered federal lobbyist or organization that employs or retains a registered federal lobbyist.[102] If the Member being honored is a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate, this restriction does not apply.[103]\n\n[101] This provision only applies to Members, not to officers or employees who may also attend the national party conventions.\n\nClose\n\n[102] See Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA), Pub. L. No. 110-81, § 305, 121 Stat. 735, 753-754 (Sept. 14, 2007); House Rule 25, cl. 8."
