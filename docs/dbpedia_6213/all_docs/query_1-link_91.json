        "text": "Ryan Binkley, a business executive and pastor from Texas, has jumped into the Republican presidential fray and visited first-in-the-nation Iowa to begin laying the groundwork for a campaign.\n\nBinkley's candidacy is a longshot in a field likely to be dominated by established names such as former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. DeSantis, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nBut he told the Des Moines Register in an interview Monday he believed he could carve a path with a platform that prioritizes unity and, at times, bipartisanship on financial, immigration and health care policy.\n\nWho is Ryan Binkley and why is he running for president?\n\nBinkley is the president, CEO and co-founder of Generational Equity Group, a mergers & acquisitions and business advisory group headquartered in Texas. He previously worked in Procter & Gamble and Boston Scientific Corporation before starting Generational in 2006.\n\nHe's also the co-founder and lead pastor of the Create Church, based in Richardson, Texas.\n\nBinkley said in recent years he had \"heard calls from the Lord about what's needed in our country,\" leading him to launch the presidential campaign — his first foray into elected politics. He's touting his business acumen and faith in driving a candidacy that will prioritize \"solutions for the country.\"\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses: GOP presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nWhat is Binkley focusing on in his platform and campaign?\n\nBinkley criticized both Democratic and Republican leaders, saying they \"really have trouble uniting their own party, much less their own country.\"\n\nHe outlined four main areas he would be focusing on in his campaign: balancing the federal budget, driving down health care costs, reaching across the aisle to reform immigration policy and \"revitalizing education\" to encourage community involvement.\n\nCurrent leaders, he argued, have come up short in all four of those areas.\n\n\"Former President Trump ran deficits,\" he said. \"Many other presidents … and our senators today, they've all voted for this continuation of what we've been doing.\"\n\nWhen it comes to health care, \"we need to know how much it costs,\" Binkley said, urging further transparency from insurance companies.\n\nHe also called for a robust \"volunteer movement\" among young people to mentor and tutor other students in an effort to boost falling test scores and reading abilities.\n\nAnd on immigration, he believes the only realistic solution will require cooperation from both parties.\n\n\"One party wants a secure border, the other wants some sort of pathway of success for the immigrants that are here,\" Binkley said. \"I think we're going to have to work together with some sort of visibility plan to know who's in our country right now.\"\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses: Donald Trump to hold Des Moines rally on same day Ron DeSantis heads to Iowa\n\nCan Iowans expect to see more of Binkley going forward?\n\nBinkley's campaign is beginning to step on the gas in Iowa, buying more than $250,000 in advertisements across statewide television, cable and radio that began airing Monday.\n\nAnd he plans to continue visiting the state for in-person events.\n\n\"They should expect to see quite a bit of me,\" he told the Register. \"I've been here several times and it's great to be back today. And we'll be here probably three weeks a month, in some ways.\""
