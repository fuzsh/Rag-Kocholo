        "text": "Corrections & Clarifications: The story has been updated to correct David Trone's time of service as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign is already well underway, but ballots across the country are long, and commander in chief isn't the only position in play.\n\nThere are 33 United States senators up for reelection in 2024. Ten are Republicans, three are Independents, and 20 are Democrats.\n\nThe upper chamber, which is now controlled narrowly by Democrats, could flip red if the GOP performs well in November. The map is considered to favor Republicans slightly this election cycle, though electoral predictions will continue to evolve, and surprises on the campaign trail are always possible.\n\nCome decision day 2024, these are the states that will see contests for senator, and who currently represents them.\n\nWhich senators are up for reelection in 2024?\n\nArizona\n\nKyrsten Sinema\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSinema, once a Democrat, is known for her eccentric fashion choices and her centrist views, which have regularly held up the Democratic policy agenda. Sinema left the Democratic Party in December 2022 over concerns of \"rigid partisanship.\"\n\nSinema will not run for reelection, citing increased polarization in the Senate. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D.-Ariz., is the leading Democratic candidate to fill Sinema's seat. Kari Lake, a former news anchor and 2022 gubernatorial candidate, is the leading Republican choice.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDianne Feinstein\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAfter winning California's \"jungle primary,\" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey will be on the ballot in November to fill the seat of the late Feinstein, who died in September 2023. The Super Tuesday ballot featured Schiff, Garvey and two other Democratic House lawmakers: Reps. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter.\n\nSome feel Schiff is to thank in part for Garvey's second-place finish â€“ he spent millions of dollars on ads boosting Garvey in the lead-up to the primary. The race for the liberal state's Senate seat is all but secured for Schiff as Californians haven't voted in a Republican Senator since 1988.\n\nConnecticut\n\nChris Murphy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMurphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to reelection in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut. During his time in the chamber, he has made gun control a major issue, often referencing the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in his home state.\n\nDelaware\n\nTom Carper\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCarper, who originally won his seat in 2000, will not seek another term. In his retirement announcement, Carper endorsed Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester to be his successor. Blunt Rochester formally announced her candidacy in June.\n\nFlorida\n\nRick Scott\n\nParty: Republican\n\nScott has been a senator since 2019, and he served as state governor before his time in the upper chamber. Scott is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was tasked as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee with securing a victory for the party in the midterms. Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging Scott.\n\nHawaii\n\nMazie Hirono\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHirono, running for reelection in 2024, was the first Asian American woman to be elected a U.S. senator. She first won her seat in 2012 and has spent much of her tenure in the chamber working on legislation addressing immigration, the environment and veterans affairs.\n\nIndiana\n\nMike Braun\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBraun, who won his Senate seat in 2018, is opting to run for governor in his state rather than seek a second term. The race to replace Braun includes Republican Rep. Jim Banks and former Democratic State Rep. Marc Carmichael.\n\nMaine\n\nAngus King\n\nParty: Independent\n\nKing is running for reelection in 2024. One of just three independents in the Senate, he has held the seat since 2013.\n\nMaryland\n\nBen Cardin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCardin, who has been in office since 2007, announced in May he would not seek reelection. Since the announcement, a slew of candidates have indicated they plan to run in the Democratic primary in Maryland, including Rep. David Trone and Angela Alsobrooks, the county executive of Prince George's County. Former Gov. Larry Hogan will run on the Republican side.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nOne-time presidential hopeful and Senate veteran Elizabeth Warren is running to keep her seat in 2024. She has served as senator for ten years.\n\nMichigan\n\nDebbie Stabenow\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nStabenow, who has been in the Senate since 2001, announced plans to retire in early January, opening up a seat in a critical battleground state. In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though businessman Nasser Beydoun and actor Hill Harper have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, many are tossing their hats into the ring. Republican candidates include former Reps. Justin Amash, Peter Meijer and Mike Rogers, businessmen Michael Hoover, Glenn Wilson, J.D. Wilson and Sandy Pensler, State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder, physician and pastor Sherry O'Donnell, physician Bensson Samuel, educator Sharon Savage and attorney Alexandria Taylor.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKlobuchar, who rose to national fame during her 2020 bid for the presidency, has been a Minnesota senator since 2007 and is the first woman to be elected by the state to the Senate. She is running for reelection.\n\nMississippi\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWicker has been the state's senator since 2007 and will run again in 2024. He serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMissouri\n\nJosh Hawley\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFamous in part for holding up a fist in support of rioters outside the capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Hawley forms part of a growing conservative flank of the GOP. He will run for reelection in 2024.\n\nMontana\n\nJon Tester\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nA Democrat in a deeply red state, Tester has held his Senate seat since 2007. He is expected to face a tough challenge from the right in 2024 as Republicans battle to regain a majority in the U.S. Senate. After U.S. Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale dropped out, Tester's likely opponent is GOP nominee Tim Sheehy, a businessman and veteran with a Trump endorsement.\n\nNebraska\n\nDeb Fischer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFischer has represented Nebraska in the Senate since the 2012 midterms and is seeking reelection.\n\nNevada\n\nJacky Rosen\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nRosen, who has already announced her reelection bid for 2024, has held her seat since 2019. Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Army veteran Sam Brown is challenging Rosen in what may be a tight race, based on recent polls.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRobert Menendez\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMenendez has held his Senate seat since 2006. He has not ruled out running for reelection but faces harsh criticism from his own party after he was charged with accepting bribes and obstructing justice. Other Democratic candidates include New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMartin Heinrich\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHeinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024. He launched his campaign for a third term with a video touching on gun safety and the importance of a transition to clean energy.\n\nNew York\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nGillibrand has become a mainstay of New York politics, holding her Senate seat since 2009. She is running for reelection. New York Republicans have tapped Mike Sapraicone, a private security executive, to run against Gillibrand.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKevin Cramer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCramer, who won his seat in 2018, will seek reelection this year. Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket. Katrina Christiansen, an assistant engineering professor at the University of Jamestown, is vying for the seat from the Democratic side.\n\nOhio\n\nSherrod Brown\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBrown, who first won in 2006, is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan is running along with businessman Bernie Moreno and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBob Casey\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCasey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. Former business executive David McCormick is challenging Casey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nWhitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and the former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly, and Republican State Rep. Patricia Morgan.\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nParty: Republican\n\nElected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues. She has announced plans to seek reelection, but will face a prominent challenge on the left.\n\nState Rep. Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020.\n\nTexas\n\nTed Cruz\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018. For 2024, he may have to do the same. Democratic Rep. Collin Allred, a former NFL player, won the recent Senate primary and will face Cruz in November.\n\nUtah\n\nMitt Romney\n\nParty: Republican\n\nOne-time presidential nominee for the GOP, Romney has come to occupy a minority in recent years, treading a more centrist, anti-Trump line. He has held his Senate seat since 2019, but is not running for reelection in 2024. Many hopefuls are vying for his seat, notably Rep. John Curtis and Brent Orrin Hatch, the son of the late Orrin G. Hatch, a former Utah senator.\n\nVermont\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSanders, a famously outspoken member of the Senate's left flank, has been in office since 2007 and is running for reelection this year. He is one of the chamber's few independents but often votes on a party line with Democrats.\n\nVirginia\n\nTim Kaine\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKaine, the vice presidential candidate on Hillary Clinton's ticket in 2016, has represented Virginia in the Senate since 2013. For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off.\n\nRepublican hopefuls include veterans Eddie Garcia and Hung Cao and former Ron DeSantis advisor Scott Parkinson.\n\nWashington\n\nMaria Cantwell\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000. Cantwell is running for reelection. Several hopefuls have thrown their hat in the ring, including Republican candidate Raul Garcia, an emergency room physician.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nJoe Manchin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nManchin, a notoriously centrist vote on the Democratic side, will not run for reelection.\n\nFormer West Virginia coal executive, Don Blankenship, who previously ran for the U.S. Senate seat as a Republican in 2018, is running for Manchin's vacant seat as a Democrat. Other hopefuls include Glenn Elliott, the mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia and former Marine Zachary Shrewsbury.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTammy Baldwin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBaldwin, who announced plans for reelection in April, is a prime target for the GOP this election cycle. Her likely GOP opponent is businessman Eric Hovde.\n\nWyoming\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBarrasso has represented Wyoming in the Senate since 2007. In one of the reddest states in the country, he is unlikely to face a strong Democratic challenger."
