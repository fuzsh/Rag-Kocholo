        "text": "Cortez Masto said “[t]here was never any [political] position I was interested in other than being the attorney general . . . I thought it was time to step up and take a leadership role and steer the ship to bring attention to those issues and find solutions to the problems.”[4] Cortez Masto made the following issues her priorities--elder abuse, sex trafficking, methamphetamine epidemic and drug distribution, and domestic violence. She spearheaded the statewide Methamphetamine Working Group to fight the use, manufacturing, and distribution of meth in Nevada. She believed that the effort to fight drugs required the combined approach of prevention, treatment, legislation, and law enforcement. Cortez Masto helped pass new laws to crack down on meth manufacturers and restrict the sale of materials used to make the drug, and her efforts led to a significant decrease in the use and distribution of meth in Nevada.\n\nCortez Masto’s grandparents were targets of fraud, an experience she told Gonzaga University’s law blog “was heartbreaking.”[5] In early 2007, she pushed the Nevada legislature to give the Attorney General’s Office jurisdiction to investigate elder fraud and abuse cases, and in May, the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 226 which created a special unit within the Attorney General’s Office to prosecute crimes against seniors.[6] She wanted to ensure that seniors were educated and aware of common scams, such as Medicare fraud, so they could avoid becoming victims.\n\nCortez Masto also advocated for women and children, especially concerned about human trafficking. In 2013, she sponsored a bill making human trafficking a felony crime in Nevada, and the bill also gave victims the right to sue their traffickers. The prison sentence of those convicted of human trafficking was lengthened, and it expanded the state’s sex offender registry by requiring human traffickers to register as sex offenders. Additionally, another bill passed in 2013 that set up a fund for victims of human trafficking. Cortez Masto invested in programs to address violence against women—a team she created to review the domestic violence fatality rate and provide recommendations to reduce deaths released a report recommending specific actions for law enforcement, district attorneys, and local legislators to combat domestic violence.\n\nIn 2010, Cortez Masto’s Office also led the fight on foreclosure fraud in Nevada by creating the Mortgage Fraud Strike Force. She was one of the first attorneys general to investigate Bank of America, accusing the company of raising interest rates on troubled borrowers. Although Bank of America denied any fault, in 2012 they settled the lawsuit for $750 million for lien reductions and short sales.[7]\n\nIn another well-known case, Sevcik v. Sandoval, Cortez Masto defended the state of Nevada in the lawsuit, that challenged Nevada’s denial of same-sex marriage as prohibited by the state’s constitution and statutory law. Cortez Masto and the state initially defended Nevada’s same-sex marriage ban, however, the state abandoned its defense of the ban after the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[8]\n\nCortez Masto, who served two terms as Nevada Attorney General, was term-limited from running for re-election. When United States Senator Harry Reid decided not to run for re-election in 2016, he endorsed Cortez Masto as his successor. On November 8, 2016, Cortez Masto became the first woman elected to represent Nevada in the Senate and the first Latina elected to serve in the Senate.[9]\n\nElection of 2006\n\nOn November 7, 2006, Cortez Masto was elected as Nevada’s 32nd Attorney General, and of the 574,975 votes cast, Cortez Masto (Democrat) received 339,465 (59.03%) votes to Don Chairez’ (Republican) 204,816 (35.6%) votes and “None of these Candidates”’ 30,694 (5.3%) votes.\n\nElection of 2010\n\nOn November 7, 2010, Cortez Masto was re-elected as Attorney General, and of the 704,332 votes cast, Cortez Masto (Democrat) received 372,011(52.8%) votes to Travis Barrick’s (Republican) 251,269 (35.7%) votes; Joel F. Hansen’s 54,980 votes (7.8%); and “None of these Candidates”’ 26,072 (3.7%) votes.\n\nElection of 2016\n\nWhen United States Senator Harry Reid decided not to run for re-election in 2016, he endorsed Cortez Masto as his successor. On November 8, 2016, Cortez Masto became the first woman elected to represent Nevada in the Senate and the first Latina elected to serve in the Senate.[11] In the Senate race, as reported by the New York Times, Cortez Masto (Democrat) won 521,994 (47.1%) of the votes to Joe Heck’s (Republican) 495,079 (44.7%) of the votes. “None of these candidates”, Tom Jones (American Independent), Tom Sawyer (Independent), and “Others” received a combined number of 91,221 votes (8.2%).[12]"
