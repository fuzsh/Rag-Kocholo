Alternatively, a person may become affiliated with a political party when the person takes an oath of affiliation at the precinct convention. A person must be affiliated with a political party to be eligible to: (1) serve as a delegate to or otherwise participate in a convention held by a party; (2) be elected as a member of or be appointed to fill a vacancy on a state executive committee; or (3) be appointed to fill a vacancy on a county executive committee. To be eligible to affiliate with a political party, a person must be a registered voter or eligible to vote a limited ballot at the time of affiliating. A person who is affiliated with a political party is ineligible to become affiliated with another political party during the same voting year. Any party affiliation expires at the end of the voting year (calendar year) in which the person became affiliated.\n\nAlternate Judge/Alternate Presiding Judge – Appointed by the authority ordering the election to serve in an election polling place on election day. Serves as a clerk unless needed to take over the role of Presiding Election Judge in the event of that person’s inability to serve.\n\nAnnual ABBM: An application for a ballot submitted by a person who wishes to vote by mail for the reason of age or disability and that serves as an application for every election run by the early voting clerk for the remainder of the calendar year after the AABBM is submitted.\n\nApplication for a Ballot by Mail (\"ABBM\"): To be entitled to vote an early voting ballot by mail, a person who is eligible for early voting must make an application for an early voting ballot to be voted by mail. The requirements to apply for a ballot by mail are very specific, and the ABBM form contains all of the information a person needs to provide in order to apply for a ballot by mail.\n\nApplication for a Place on the Ballot: The form filed by a candidate with the appropriate filing authority to apply for a place on a ballot. General Requirements for Application - A candidate's application for a place on the ballot that is required by this code must: (1) be in writing; (2) be signed and sworn to by the candidate and indicate the date that the candidate swears to the application.\n\nArticle XI, Section 11 (Texas Constitution): Provides that home rule cities may provide by charter or charter amendment and general law cities by election may select a longer term of office than 2 years (i.e., 3 or 4 years). If a term length of greater than 2 years is chosen, all members of the governing body must be elected by majority vote, and any vacancy in such an office must be filled by special election within 120 days after such vacancy occurs.\n\nAutomatic Tabulating Equipment: Equipment, other than a voting machine, that compiles vote totals by ballot sorting, ballot reading, ballot scanning, or electronic data processing.\n\nBallot: Either in paper form or electronic, the mechanism for voters to show their vote preferences.\n\nBallot Box Nos. 1, 2, 3, & 4: A ballot box is a container for ballots that can be locked (double-locked in case of a ballot box used for early voting by personal appearance) and sealed. Ballot boxes no. 1 and no. 2 are used for the deposit of voters’ marked ballots; ballot box no. 3 is used for delivering the voted ballots to their custodian after they are counted and for storing the voted ballots during the preservation period; and ballot box no. 4 is used for delivering defectively printed, spoiled, and unused ballots to their custodian after the election. Ballot boxes no. 1 and no. 2 must each have a slot in the top just large enough to receive a ballot. Ballot boxes no. 3 and no. 4 are not required to have a slot, but if a slot is provided, it may not be larger than that prescribed for boxes no. 1 and no. 2.\n\nBallot Envelope: The envelope, usually white, in which a voter places his marked ballot when voting by mail; also called a ballot secrecy envelope. This envelope is in turn placed in the Carrier Envelope.\n\nBallot Image: The ballot as it appears on a direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system.\n\nBallot Instructions: The wording found at the top of the ballot, but below the words “OFFICIAL BALLOT,” that instructs a voter on how to mark the ballot. Examples of statutory ballot instructions include: “Vote for the candidate of your choice in each race by placing an “X” in the square beside the candidate’s name.” Or, if more than one candidate is to be elected in any race on the ballot, “Vote for none, one, two, . . .or ” (in the numerical sequence appropriate for the number of candidates to be elected). There are also specific instructions for straight-party voting, propositions, and for electronic voting machine ballots. See Secs. 52.070 – 52.072, 124.063.\n\nBilingual Requirements: Bilingual election materials (printed in English and Spanish) shall be used in elections in this state.\n\nBranch Early Voting Location: Either Permanent or Temporary – a location other than the main early voting site where voters can vote early by personal appearance.\n\nCalendar Year: A document that is good for the calendar year effectively “expires” on December 31 at the end of the year. That is, it is not necessarily good for a full year from the date of filing (unless filed on January 1).\n\nCancellation of An Election: An election may be cancelled under certain circumstances as allowed by law. Reasons for cancellation include candidates being unopposed or a moot measure (i.e., the action to be authorized by the voters may not be taken, regardless of the outcome of the election).\n\nCandidate: A person who is running for an elected office.\n\nCanvass: The procedure performed by the governing body of the political subdivision whereby the election results become official. At the time set for convening the canvassing authority for the local canvass, the presiding officer of the canvassing authority shall deliver the sealed precinct returns to the authority. The authority shall open the returns for each precinct and prepare a tabulation stating for each candidate and for and against each measure the total number of votes received in each precinct and the sum of those precinct totals (the tabulation must also show the total number of voters who cast a ballot). Two members of the authority constitute a quorum for purposes of canvassing an election.\n\nCarrier Envelope: The envelope in which a voter places his sealed ballot envelope (containing his marked by-mail ballot). The voter then seals the carrier envelope, signs the back flap on the signature line, and mails this to the early voting clerk conducting the election in which the voter is casting a ballot.\n\nCensus: An official count of the number of people in a region. The federal census is done by the federal government every 10 years.\n\nCentral Counting Station: A centralized location at which ballots cast during the election are tabulated and election reports generated based on those tabulations. The authority adopting an electronic voting system for use in an election may establish one or more central counting stations for counting the ballots if the voting system is designed to have ballots counted at a central location.\n\nCertificate of Election: After the completion of a canvass, the presiding officer of the local canvassing authority shall prepare a certificate of election for each candidate who is elected to an office for which the official result is determined by that authority's canvass. A certificate of election is then issued to each winning candidate.\n\nCharter City: See Home Rule City.\n\nCity Secretary: A city clerk or, in a city that has no city secretary or clerk, the city officer who performs the duties of a city secretary.\n\nCombination Form: A form used at the polling place during early voting and election day that combines multiple functions and requirements into a single form. For example, the form contains the poll list and signature roster, space for election workers to add the name and address of a voter’s assistant, and notations that a voter is voting provisionally, is not on the list of registered voters, or has a similar name issue. The form also includes the “similar name” and “voter not on list” affidavits to be initialed by voters. The form has multiple carbon copy layers, with one copy each going into Envelopes 2, 3, and 4, and one copy in with ballot box #3.\n\nCombined Election Precincts: When two or more county election precincts vote at the same polling place but the precincts are reported separately and separate paperwork is kept for each precinct. Contrast “Consolidated Precinct.”\n\nCommissioner/JP/Constable Precinct: Each county in the state must be divided into four commissioner’s precincts; one county commissioner is elected to represent each commissioner precinct. Similarly, each county must be divided into justice of the peace and constable precincts; the number of such is dependent upon the county population and other factors. See Art. V, Sec 18, TX Constitution.\n\nConfirmation Notice: A notice sent to a voter by the voter registrar when the registrar has reason to believe that a voter’s current residence is different from that indicated on the registration records. The notice includes a statement that, if the voter fails to submit to the registrar a written, signed response confirming the voter’s current residence on or before the 30th day after the date the confirmation notice is mailed, the voter will have to submit a statement of residence (SOR) before the voter may be accepted for voting. The notice also warns the voter that the voter’s registration is subject to cancellation if the voter fails to confirm the voter’s current residence by November 30 following the second general election for state and county officers that occurs after the date the confirmation notice is mailed.\n\nCongress: The U.S. Congress, which makes the country's laws, is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are 100 Senators (2 from each state) and 435 members of the House of Representatives (Representatives are divided by population among the states, with each state having at least 1 representative).\n\nCongressional District: An area within a state from which a member of the House of Representatives is elected. Seats (positions) in the House of Representatives are reapportioned every 10 years; since the number of Representatives is set to 435, some areas lose Representatives and others gain some. Texas currently has 36 Congressional districts.\n\nConsolidated Election Precinct – County Election: In a special election for which use of county election precincts is required, the commissioners court may consolidate, on the recommendation of the county election board, two or more county election precincts into a single precinct if the polling place is located so it will adequately serve the voters of the consolidated precinct; at least one consolidated precinct must be situated wholly within each commissioners precinct. With a consolidated precinct, essentially the county election precincts become a single larger precinct; the precinct results are reported by the consolidated precinct rather than for each individual precinct, and only one set of paperwork is kept for the entire consolidated precinct.\n\nConsolidated Election Precinct – Primary Election: The county executive committee of a political party\n\nholding a primary election may order two or more county election precincts consolidated into a single precinct, if the polling place is located so it will adequately serve the voters of the consolidated precinct.\n\nConvention: An official meeting of the delegates of a political party at which the delegates decide upon their party platform and take other party-related actions.\n\nCorrected Ballot: To make a necessary correction on the ballot, the authority responsible for having the official ballot prepared may prepare new ballots, line out or otherwise obscure the language being corrected (and enter in printed form the correct language next to the language being corrected, if necessary), or prepare printed or blank correction stickers to be affixed to the ballots.\n\nCounty Clerk: Administers elections at the county level, unless that county has an Elections Administrator.\n\nCounty Election Board: The board established in each county for the general election for state and county officers, a special election for an officer regularly elected at the general election, and any other election ordered by a county authority or held at county expense. In the general election for state and county officers and for a special election for an officer regularly elected at the general election, the board consists of the county judge, county clerk (or EA, if applicable), voter registrar (VR), sheriff, and county chair of each political party required to nominate candidates by primary election. In other elections, the board consists of the county judge, county clerk, voter registrar, and sheriff. Duties of the county election board include: 1) reviewing and approving the selection of election supplies by the county clerk or elections administrator (In an election ordered by the governor or county authority); 2) appointing the early voting ballot board for the general election for state and county officers; 3) appointing the Signature Verification Committee; and 4) recommending consolidation of precincts in special elections that require use of county election precincts. The county clerk (or EA) is the chair of the county election board.\n\nCounty Election Commission: The group that appoints, monitors, and may fire a county Elections Administrator (EA). Board membership is composed of the county judge, county clerk, county tax assessor-collector, and the county chair of each political party. Given the role of the board, the county clerk is not replaced by the EA once an EA is appointed (unlike with the County Election Board).\n\nCounty Election Precinct: The county commissioner’s court divides all territory of the county into county election precincts; each precinct must not contain territory from more than one county commissioner’s precinct, justice precinct, congressional district, state representative district, state senatorial district, or state board of education district. The precincts must be compact and contiguous. A voter is registered in the county election precinct that contains the voter’s residence address. Each election precinct established for an election shall be served by a single polling place located within the boundary of the precinct. In elections other that the general election for state and county officers, and with certain limitations, county election precincts may be combined or consolidated so that multiple precincts vote at a single polling location.\n\nCounty Office: An office of the county government that is voted on countywide or from a portion of the county such as a commissioner, justice, or constable precinct.\n\nCountywide Polling Place Program: Also referred to as Vote Centers. A polling place system in which the county election precinct polling places are eliminated and instead any registered voter eligible to vote in the county-run election may vote at any polling place open on election day; similar to the way an early voting polling place is used. A county must meet the following minimum requirements: (1) exclusive use of direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems at all polling places; (2) implementation of a computerized voter registration list that allows instantaneous verification that a voter has not already voted at another polling place; and (3) if the county has not participated in one of the previous countywide election precinct programs, it must hold a public hearing to inform and solicit opinions from voters, minority organizations, and other interested parties. For an election held in the first year in which the county holds an election under the program, the total number of countywide polling places may not be less than 65% of the number of precinct polling places that would otherwise have been used in the last equivalent election. For subsequent elections, this number drops to 50%.\n\nCure Period: The period ending on the 6th day after election day (for most elections), during which a voter who voted provisionally because the voter (a) does not possess one of the acceptable forms of photo identification listed below, which, for voters aged 18-69, is not expired for more than four years, and the voter can reasonably obtain one of these forms of identification or (b) possesses, but did not bring to the polling place, one of the seven (7) forms of acceptable photo identification, which, for voters aged 18-69, is not expired for more than four years, or (c) does not possess one of the seven (7) forms of acceptable photo identification, which, for voters aged 18-69, is not expired for more than four years, could otherwise not reasonably obtain one, but did not bring a supporting form of identification to the polling place, may go to the office of the voter registrar (or elections administrator, if applicable), to either present one of the seven (7) forms of acceptable photo identification OR, if the voter does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain one of the seven (7) forms of acceptable photo identification, follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure, or, if applicable, submit one of the temporary affidavits (religious objection or natural disaster) in the presence of the county voter registrar, or, if applicable, qualify for the disability exemption with the county voter registrar.\n\nCustodian of Election Records: The individual responsible for maintaining for the required retention period the records from an election. In an election ordered by the governor, a county authority, or the primary election, this is the county clerk/elections administrator. For a city, it is the city secretary; for all other elections, it is the secretary of the political subdivision’s governing body (or of no secretary, then to governing body’s presiding officer).\n\nDeclaration of Write-in Candidate: To be entitled to a place on the list of write-in candidates, a candidate must make a declaration of write-in candidacy and file it with the authority with whom an application for a place on the ballot is filed.\n\nDirect Recording Electronic Voting Machine/DRE: A voting machine that is designed to allow a direct vote on the machine by the manual touch of a screen, monitor, wheel, or other device and that records the individual votes and vote totals electronically.\n\nDisability Exemption: An exemption to the requirement that a voter show one of the 7 forms of acceptable photo identification or following the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure, before voting a regular ballot. Voters with a disability may apply with the county voter registrar for this permanent exemption. The application must contain written documentation from either the U.S. Social Security Administration evidencing he or she has been determined to have a disability, or from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs evidencing a disability rating of at least 50 percent. Those who obtain a disability exemption will be allowed to vote by presenting a voter registration certificate reflecting the exemption [shown as (E) on the VR certificate].\n\nDisaster Exemption: A voter who does not present one of the 7 forms of acceptable photo identification or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure because of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor may vote a provisional ballot, appear at the voter registrar’s office within six (6) calendar days after election day, and sign an affidavit swearing to the natural disaster. This will allow the voter’s provisional ballot to be counted as long as the voter is otherwise eligible to vote.\n\nDistrict Office: An office of the federal or state government that is not voted on statewide.\n\nDuplicate Ballot: A ballot substituted for a damaged or partially invalid optical scan ballot; each duplicate ballot must be clearly labeled “duplicate” and must bear the serial number of the original ballot.\n\nEarly Voting Ballot Board: An early voting ballot board must be created in each election to process early voting results from the territory served by the early voting clerk.\n\nEarly Voting by Mail. A person who will be absent during the period of early voting in person and on election day, who will be 65 or older on election day, is disabled, or imprisoned may choose to vote by mail by timely submitting an application for a ballot by mail to the early voting clerk for the election.\n\nEarly Voting Clerk: The early voting clerk shall conduct the early voting in each election. The clerk is an officer of the election in which the clerk serves. Generally speaking, the clerk has the same duties and authority with respect to early voting as a presiding election judge has with respect to regular voting. The early voting clerk for a county election is the county clerk (or elections administrator), for city elections it is the city secretary, and for other political subdivisions, it is a person appointed by the governing body of the political subdivision who meets certain requirements.\n\nEarly Voting in Person/Early Voting by Personal Appearance: Voting conducted in person before the date of the election. Early voting in person begins for most elections the 17th day before election day and runs until the 4th day before election day. Early voting for the May uniform election date and any subsequent runoff election begins on the 12th day before election day through the 4th day before election day.\n\nEarly Voting Roster: The early voting clerk maintains for each election a roster listing each person who votes an early voting ballot by personal appearance and a roster listing each person to whom an early voting ballot to be voted by mail is sent.\n\nElections Administrator (EA): An appointed official who performs the election duties of the county clerk and the voter registrar.\n\nElection Assistance Commission (EAC): Established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, the Election Assistance Commission serves primarily as a national clearinghouse and resource for information on elections. It also reviews federal election administration and procedures.\n\nElection Clerk: Individuals appointed by the presiding judge to assist in running the election. The presiding judge shall designate the working hours of and assign the duties to be performed by the election clerks serving under the judge.\n\nElection Contest: An action in civil court to contest the result of an election. The tribunal hearing an election contest attempts to ascertain whether the outcome of the contested election, as shown by the final canvass, is not the true outcome because: (1) illegal votes were counted; or (2) an election officer or other person officially involved in the administration of the election: (A) prevented eligible voters from voting; (B) failed to count legal votes; or (C) engaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made a mistake. The result of a “successful” election contest is that the court by order will state a new result for the election, or order a new election to be held.\n\nElection (Day) Precinct: The phrase commonly used to refer to the area served on election day by a single polling place. It could be a single county election precinct, combined county election precincts, or consolidated county election precincts (counties); or the precincts created by a local authority (May elections). Contrast “county election precinct.”\n\nElectioneering: A person commits an offense if, during the voting period and within 100 feet of an outside door through which a voter may enter the building in which a polling place is located, the person loiters or electioneers for or against any candidate, measure, or political party. The term electioneering includes the posting, use, or distribution of political signs or literature. Electioneering within the prohibited distance and time period is a Class C misdemeanor.\n\nElection Identification Certificate (EIC): A form of identification issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety to individuals who do not have one of the other six forms of acceptable form of photo identification to present when voting. To qualify for an EIC, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen, a Texas resident, eligible to vote in Texas (show VR certificate or submit VR application when applying for the EIC), and be 17 years and 10 months or older.\n\nElection Judge: Also, “Presiding Election Judge” or “Presiding Judge.” The presiding judge is in charge of and responsible for the management and conduct of the election at the polling place of the election precinct that the judge serves.\n\nElection Night Returns: Unofficial vote totals reported by local election officials to the Secretary of State on election night. On completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct, which must state: (1) the total number of voters who voted at the polling place as indicated by the poll list; and (2) the total number of votes counted for each candidate and for and against each measure.\n\nElectoral College: The president and vice president are selected through the electoral college system, which gives each state the same number of electoral votes as it has members of Congress. The Electoral College is composed of delegates from each state (plus the District of Columbia). (The number of delegates from each state is equal to the sum of that state's U.S. Senators plus U.S. Representatives.) According to the U.S. Constitution, the electors (chosen by popular vote) assemble in their respective state capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December and vote for president. Electors are supposed to vote for the candidate who received a plurality of votes in the state or area they represent. To become president, a candidate must get more than half of the Electoral College votes (270 out of 538 votes).\n\nElectronic Voting System: A voting system in which the ballots are automatically counted and the results automatically tabulated by use of electronically operated apparatus; i.e., a method of voting using either optical scan ballots (which are counted either at the precinct using a precinct ballot counter or at the central counting station using tabulator machines) or Direct Recording Electronic voting machines.\n\nEnvelope Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 4.

Exit polls are used to predict the outcome of the election or gather other information before the polls are closed. The policy of the SOS is to permit non-disruptive exit polling within the 100 foot boundaries surrounding each early voting and election day polling place.\n\nFederal Election: An election involving a federal office (or multiple federal offices).\n\nFederal Election Commission (FEC): Independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance law. The FEC consists of six commissioners appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. The FEC was established by the 1974 amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.\n\nFiling Authority: The person with whom an application for a place on the ballot or a declaration of write-in candidacy must be filed. For political subdivisions other than a county and a city, the secretary of the governing body is the filing authority. For cities, it is the city secretary. For county level offices appearing on the primary election ballot, it is the party county chair. For district and state offices appearing on the primary election ballot, it is the state party chair. For independent or write-in candidates for county level offices, it is the county judge. For independent or write-in candidates for district and state offices, it is the SOS.\n\nFinal Canvass (see also, Canvass): The canvass from which the official result of an election is determined.\n\nFPCA: Federal Postcard Application – a person is eligible for early voting by FPCA if: (1) the person is qualified to vote in this state or, if not registered to vote in this state, would be qualified if registered; and (2) the person is: (A) a member of the armed forces of the United States, or the spouse or a dependent of a member; (B) a member of the merchant marine of the United States, or the spouse or a dependent of a member; or (C) domiciled in this state but temporarily living outside the territorial limits of the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\nGeneral Election: As used when applied to political subdivisions other than counties, the regularly-scheduled election to fill the full terms of a political subdivision’s governing body; held on a uniform election date (second Saturday on May or first Tuesday after first Monday in November).\n\nGeneral Election for State and County Officers: The general election at which officers of the federal, state, and county governments are elected; held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday on November of each even-numbered year.\n\nGeneral Law City: In Texas there are two main types of cities – general law and home rule (charter) cities. Of the general law cities, which operate under the general laws of the state (e.g., the Texas Local Government Code), there are three main categories – Type A, Type B, and Type C. A Type A city has a population of at least 600, and its city council members serve terms of 2-4 years. A Type B city has a population of 200 – 9,999, and its officers serve terms of 1 – 4 years. A Type C city has a population of 201-4,999, and its officers serve terms of 2-4 years. Each city has specific vacancy-filling procedures. Art XVI, Sec. 11 of the Texas Constitution applies to vacancies in office if the terms are longer than 2 years.\n\nGoverning Body: The term used to describe the group of individuals elected to formulate the policy and direct the affairs of a political subdivision. Examples include a city council, school board, water district board of directors, etc.\n\nGubernatorial General Election: The general election held every four years to elect a governor for a full term.\n\nHatch Act: The Hatch Act places restrictions on political activity by employees of the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, District of Columbia government, and state and local employees who work in connection with federally funded programs. Under the act, employees are permitted to contribute to a candidate’s campaign, but are restricted from using official authority to influence an election, including soliciting or receiving political contributions and engaging in political activity — including wearing or displaying political promotional materials — while on duty. Employees covered by the Hatch Act may run for office in a nonpartisan election, such as many school board elections, but are prohibited from running in a partisan election.\n\nHelp America Vote Act (HAVA): Congress passed HAVA to address voting problems encountered in the 2000 presidential election. The act encourages state and local governments to eliminate punch-card and lever voting machines. Under HAVA, states have received $2.9 billion since 2003 to improve their election processes.
