        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nWalz is a familiar face in Minnesota and the halls of power in Washington, D.C., but a relative newcomer to the national stage.\n\nAlong a white picket fence in St. Paul, Minnesota today, a crowd gathers to send off Governor Tim Walz after getting the call from presidential nominee Kamala Harris to join the Democratic ticket.\n\nKamala Harris, Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate: Listen, I want you to do this with me.\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Vice Presidential Candidate: I would be honored, Madam Vice President.\n\nGov. Tim Walz:\n\nEverything that we believe in, these people are trying to destroy. So, if you are on the streets tonight, it is very clear, you are not with us. You do not share our values. And we will use the full strength of goodness and righteousness to make sure that this ends.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nThe right criticized his response as slow, and Walz himself later acknowledged the — quote — \"abject failure\" of that response.\n\nIn 2023, after his party won control of the Minnesota House and Senate, Walz signed into law a laundry list of Democratic priorities, providing free meals to K-12 students, the largest child tax credit in the country, enshrining abortion rights into state law, increasing LGBTQ protections, legalizing marijuana, and granting voting rights to ex-offenders.\n\nHis selection by Harris is seen by some as a nod to the party's progressive wing.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nIn 2006, he flipped his Minnesota U.S. House seat from red to blue, becoming the highest-ranking enlisted veteran ever in Congress.\n\nOver six terms and a dozen years, he ranked among the most bipartisan lawmakers, supported ongoing operations in Iraq, while opposing more boots on the ground, pushed for a minimum wage hike and prescription drug cost negotiations, voted against President Obama's 2009 Wall Street bailout plan, but backed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBefore entering politics, Walz served 24 years with the Army National Guard, enlisting at the age of 17, alongside his day job teaching high school social studies and coaching football. In recent weeks leading up to his selection, Walz made a name for himself as a willing warrior for Harris.\n\nAre you what this ticket needs to be able to beat the Trump/Vance ticket?\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nThe Harris/Walz campaign will spend the next week touring swing states, with stops in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, as it introduces the country to a new national political player and potential future vice president.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the Harris/Walz campaign will be introducing Governor Walz to the American people. Our new PBS/NPR/Marist poll out today shows that 71 percent of Americans don't know who he is.\n\nFor more on the Minnesota governor, I'm joined now by Twin Cities PBS reporter Mary Lahammer. She's been following Walz's career for some 20 years.\n\nMary, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.\n\nMary Lahammer:\n\nYes, it was an interesting environment.\n\nAn organic crowd developed. There were folks walking their dogs out on a morning run, a walk, and decided to stay, and they actually got to see him depart in the motorcade, and just started cheering for him out of the blue.\n\nAnd then talking to them afterwards, they're excited. Minnesotans like to play an outsized role in national politics. They're kind of proud of it. I think people are learning the statistic that if Walz wins three out of the last six Democratic vice presidents will be from Minnesota.\n\nBut as your poll shows, he's got to introduce himself to the nation.\n\nMary Lahammer:\n\nYes, I will go back to his very first run for office.\n\nAnd I remember some trusted sources saying you got to get down to this rural Republican district where this football coach is actually making a race of it and eventually flipped the seat. I went back and studied that debate and tried to kind of ascertain how much he has changed. And it was interesting to me to see that he is still kind of — was the fearless, self-effacing, but aggressive, quick kind of his feet.\n\nSo he's been able to debate and really pivot for a long time, but introducing himself to a national audience will be new. He's used to the Minnesota press corps. He's done a lot of national news, and was even surprised. In our recent interview, we discussed how that Republicans are weird phrase, how we kind of coined that phrase.\n\nAnd he was almost embarrassed, saying, oh, gosh, shucks. I wasn't trying to be mean about it.\n\nSo we will see how those Midwestern tendencies go on the national stage.\n\nMary Lahammer:\n\nIt depends which office you're talking about. When he was a member of Congress from a rural previously Republican district, he was much more of a moderate.\n\nThen, when he became governor for the state and his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, definitely took him in more of a progressive stance. And then he got an all-Democratic legislature, so ended up passing just a very large list of highly progressive items.\n\nSo, some folks say, was it a bait-and-switch? He originally ran on this concept of one Minnesota. We are still probably rather divided here.\n\nMary Lahammer:\n\nYes, a good portion of his time in office as governor has been in front of a divided legislature. He recently had the all-Democratic trifecta.\n\nBut before that, he had a lot of critics, and he had a hard road in divided government. Minnesota is a state, four Democrats, four Republicans in Congress. We're slightly purple. And folks here are very critical of his time during the pandemic in particular. We had a lot of lockdowns. Of course, we had the riots following George Floyd's murder and were very critical of him being slow to send the National Guard out.\n\nAlso, during the pandemic, we had the largest fraud in the Feeding Our Future fraud case. I think the governor will probably be talking about the fact that those cases have been brought to justice, and there have been convictions in both of those instances."
