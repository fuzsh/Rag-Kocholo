        "text": "2006 Texas Election\n\n← 2005 November 7, 2006 ( ) 2007 →\n\nThe 2006 Texas General Election was held on Tuesday, 7 November 2006, in the U.S. state of Texas. Voters statewide elected the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office, Commissioner of Agriculture, and one Railroad Commissioner. Statewide judicial offices up for election were the chief justice and four justices of the Texas Supreme Court, and the presiding judge and two judges of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\nElections were additionally held for the United States Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, Texas Senate, and Texas House.\n\nDemocratic and Republican candidates were selected in party primaries held 7 March 2006. In races without a majority, the runoff elections were held on 11 April 2006.\n\nLibertarian candidates were selected at the Texas Libertarian Convention 10 June 2006 in Houston (the Libertarian Party does not use a primary system to select candidates).\n\nIndependent candidates had 60 days after the primaries are over (from 8 March, one day after the primary election, to 11 May 2006) to collect the necessary signatures to secure a place on the ballot. For statewide elections, state law proscribes the collection of one percent of voters casting ballots in the prior gubernatorial election (for 2006, this equates to 45,540 signatures) from registered voters that did not vote in either primary or any runoffs. If there was a primary runoff for the office an independent candidate is seeking, the petition process shrank to only 30 days, from 12 April (one day after the runoff elections) to 11 May 2006.[1]\n\n2006 United States Senate election, Texas Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,106,587 25.7 Turnout 4,314,663 Republican hold Swing\n\nMain article: Texas gubernatorial election, 2006\n\nTexas general election, 2006: Governor[1] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 406,450 9.24 Turnout 4,399,068 −3.40 Republican hold\n\n2006 election for Lieutenant Governor Party Candidate Votes % Majority 896,040 20.75 Turnout 4,319,226 Republican hold Swing\n\nIncumbent Attorney general Greg Abbott ran for re-election, winning by a 22% margin.\n\n2006 Texas Attorney General election\n\n← 2002\n\n2010 →\n\nNominee Greg Abbott David Van Os Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 2,556,063 1,599,069 Percentage 59.51% 37.23%\n\nCounty results\n\nAbbott: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nVan Os: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nAttorney General before election\n\nGreg Abbott\n\nRepublican\n\nElected Attorney General\n\nGreg Abbott\n\nRepublican\n\n2006 election for Attorney General Party Candidate Votes % Majority 956,994 22.28 Turnout 4,294,800 Republican hold Swing\n\n2006 election for Comptroller of Public Accounts Party Candidate Votes % Majority 961,961 22.46 Turnout 4,283,250 Republican hold Swing\n\n2006 election for Commissioner of the General Land Office Party Candidate Votes % Majority 595,590 14.17 Turnout 4,203,616 Republican hold Swing\n\n2006 Texas Agriculture Commissioner election\n\nTexas general election, 2006: Texas Commissioner of Agriculture[1] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 547,004 12.98 −8.74 Turnout 4,212,797 −4.85 Republican hold\n\n2006 election for Railroad Commissioner Party Candidate Votes % Majority 516,796 12.3 Turnout 4,200,338 Republican hold Swing\n\nRepublican\n\nWallace Jefferson, Incumbent\n\nLibertarian\n\nTom Oxford\n\nGreen (Write-in)\n\nCharles E.
