The term of office for those elected in 2006 ran from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2013. Before the election cycle, the Republican Party controlled 55 of the 100 Senate seats.\n\nThe Senate elections were part of the Democratic sweep during the 2006 elections, in which Democrats made numerous gains and no congressional or gubernatorial seat held by a Democrat was won by a Republican.[1] However, Democratic incumbent Joe Lieberman in Connecticut was defeated in the primary and was later reelected as a third-party candidate; he continued to caucus with the Democrats. Because of this, this is the first time since 1970 in which a member of a third party, who is not an independent, was elected to the Senate. Independent Jim Jeffords in Vermont retired but was succeeded by another Independent, Bernie Sanders, retaining their presence in the Senate. Jeffords and Sanders both caucused with Democrats. Democrats picked 6 seats up by defeating Republican incumbents in Missouri, Montana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Virginia, while holding open seats in Maryland and Minnesota. Republicans held their sole open seat in Tennessee.\n\nFollowing the elections, no party held a majority of seats for the first time since January 1955. The Democrats were able to control the chamber because the two Independents caucused with the Democrats. They needed at least 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would have broken any 50–50 tie in favor of the Republicans. This was the only time between 1990 and 2022 that Democrats gained Senate seats in a midterm.\n\nAs of 2023 , this was the last time a Democrat won a Senate election in Nebraska, the last time a Democrat did not win a seat in Connecticut, and the last time that the tipping point state was decided by under 1%, with Jim Webb of Virginia winning by a margin of under .4%.\n\nResults

Kyl's Democratic opponent for the general election was wealthy real-estate developer Jim Pederson, who served as the Arizona Democratic Party Chairman from 2001 to 2005. During his tenure, Pederson spent millions of dollars of his own money to help Democrats modernize and to elect Janet Napolitano as Governor of Arizona. The deadline for signing petition signatures to appear on the September 12, 2006, primary ballot was June 14, 2006.\n\nNot long after the 2004 election, Pederson's name began being mentioned as a potential Senate candidate for the 2006 race. On July 28, 2005, Pederson formally stepped down as Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, further fueling those speculations. In early September 2005, an e-mail was sent from the Arizona Democratic Party's website, inviting people to an announcement by Pederson on September 7. In an anticlimactic move, an e-mail was sent out shortly after the first saying that the announcement would be postponed due to Hurricane Katrina. It was requested that any money that would be donated to Pederson's campaign at the announcement be directed to relief efforts instead. Similarly, a meeting in Arizona of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was scheduled for around the same time. It was also postponed and the same request was made involving donations. On September 7, 2005, Pederson filed to run for the U.S. Senate. On September 14, 2005, Pederson formally announced his intention to run, in his hometown of Casa Grande, Arizona.\n\nAlthough Kyl started the campaign with a sizable lead in most polls, the gap quickly narrowed, especially after Pederson released his array of ads.\n\nPederson lost the election by 9.84% or 150,257 votes, despite Democratic Incumbent Governor Janet Napolitano easily being re-elected and winning every county statewide. While Pederson lost it was still notable, as it was the worst performance of Senator Kyl's career. Kyl did well as Republicans usually do in Maricopa County home of Phoenix. Pederson did well in Pima County home of Tucson which tends to support Democrats. Kyl was called the winner by CNN at around 8 P.M. local time, 11 P.M. EST. Pederson called Senator Kyl and conceded defeat at 9:02 p.m. local time, 12:02 A.M.

Also running was Libertarian Michael Metti, Don Grundmann of the American Independent Party, Todd Chretien of the Green Party and Marsha Feinland of the Peace and Freedom Party.\n\nBecause California is a state that requires a large amount of money to wage a competitive statewide campaign, it is not unusual - as was the case for this race - for a popular incumbent to have no significant opponent. Several prominent Republicans, such as Bill Jones, Matt Fong, and others, declined to run, and a previous announced challenger, businessman Bill Mundell, withdrew his declaration after determining he would not be a self-funded candidate (like Michael Huffington was in the 1994 election).\n\nDemocratic primary Candidate Votes % Dianne Feinstein (Incumbent) 2,176,888 86.95% Colleen Fernald 199,180 7.96% Martin Luther Church 127,301 5.09% Total votes 2,503,369 100.00%\n\nGreen primary Candidate Votes % Todd Chretien 12,821 46.14% Tian Harter 10,318 37.13% Kent Mesplay 4,649 16.73% Total votes 27,788 100.00%\n\nOther primaries Party Candidate Votes %\n\nOn September 22, the Los Angeles Times reported that Mountjoy's official biography, as found on his campaign website, falsely asserted that he had served aboard the battleship USS Missouri during the Korean War—he'd actually served aboard the heavy cruiser USS Bremerton. A review of the ships' logs corroborated this and the website was quickly changed to reflect his service aboard the Bremerton rather than the Missouri. Mountjoy denied having been responsible for adding the incorrect information[7]\n\nFeinstein won the election easily. Feinstein won almost every major urban area, winning in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and San Diego.

Lieberman formed his own third party and won in the general election to a fourth term.\n\nBecause Connecticut was believed to be a Democratic stronghold, Connecticut's Senate seat was considered safe to remain as a Democratic seat by political analysts,[10][11] but Lieberman's continued support for conservative and Bush administration policies made him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenger. Lieberman's critics objected to what they call Lieberman's lack of commitment to the Democratic party;[12] his opposition to affirmative action;[13] his opposition to a Connecticut state law that would require Catholic hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims;[14] his membership in the bipartisan Gang of 14;[15] his support of Florida governor Jeb Bush in the Terri Schiavo case;[16] his initial willingness to compromise on Social Security privatization;[17] his alliances with Republicans;[18] and his attacks on other Democrats.[19][20][21]\n\nOn March 13, 2006, Ned Lamont announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Lamont was more liberal than Lieberman, but he was not immune from criticism from within his own party. The New Republic senior editor and \"liberal hawk\" Jonathan Chait criticized Lamont's supporters by comparing them to activists who he felt \"tore the party apart\" in the 1960s and 70s.[22]\n\nEarly polling showed Lieberman with as much as a 46-point lead,[23] but subsequent polls showed Lamont gaining until Lamont took the lead just weeks before the primary.[24] A controversy about a \"kiss\" Lieberman supposedly received from President Bush during the 2005 State of the Union address highlighted concerns that the senator was too close to the unpopular president to be a credible Democratic nominee.[25] Lieberman released several campaign advertisements over the summer of 2006, seeking to connect himself to former President Bill Clinton and to portray Lamont as standing for little more than opposition to Lieberman. Lamont struck back against some of Lieberman's more negative ads with an advertisement produced by well-known political consultant Bill Hillsman. In Lamont's ad, a foreboding narrator says, \"Meet Ned Lamont. He can't make a decent cup of coffee, he's a bad karaoke singer, and he has a messy desk.\" Lamont then chimes in, \"Aren't you sick of political attack ads that insult your intelligence? Senator Lieberman, let's stick to issues and pledge to support whoever wins the Democratic primary.\"[26]\n\nFrom midmorning August 7 to well past August 9, Lieberman's official campaign site was taken offline; officials from Lieberman's campaign claimed, \"dirty politics\" and \"Rovian tactics\" on the part of Lamont's supporters, and more specifically, a sustained Distributed Denial of Service attack that, according to the Lieberman campaign, had left the site down for several days.[27]\n\nTim Tagaris, Lamont's Internet communications director, denied the charge and attributed the downtime to the fact that the Lieberman campaign had chosen an inferior web host, or ISP, and was only paying $15/month to operate its site (in comparison to the $1500/month being spent by the Lamont campaign).[28][29][30] On December 20, 2006, a joint investigation by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal's office and the U.S. attorney's office cleared the Lamont campaign of the hacking accusations. A spokesman for Kevin O'Connor, the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, stated, \"The investigation has revealed no evidence the problems the Web site experienced were the result of criminal conduct.\"[31]\n\nLamont won the primary with 51.79% of the vote, as opposed to Lieberman's 48.21%.[32] However, in his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary.[33]\n\nIn the Republican Party primary, Alan Schlesinger drew fire in July when it was revealed that he had been gambling under an alias in order to avoid detection as a card counter. Despite calls to withdraw from the race, Schlesinger remained in the race,[34] ultimately becoming the Republican nominee when no other Republican challengers entered the race.\n\nDemocratic Primary Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 283,055 100.0%\n\nOn June 12, Ned Lamont began running radio ads promising if he lost the primary to endorse Lieberman, challenging Lieberman to abandon consideration of an independent run by making a similar pledge. Lieberman refused to make this pledge; his campaign manager, Sean Smith said, \"Are we going to support Ned Lamont? Ah, no!\"[35]\n\nOn July 3 in Hartford, Lieberman announced that he would collect signatures in order to guarantee himself a position on the November ballot. Both Lieberman and Smith said that Lieberman will run as a \"petitioning Democrat\" and would caucus with Senate Democrats if elected.[36] On July 10, the Lieberman campaign officially filed paperwork allowing him to collect signatures to form a new political party, the Connecticut for Lieberman party.[37]\n\nUpon Lieberman's announcement, independent polls continued to show him favored to win a plurality or outright majority of the vote in a three-way general election (see below). The petition issue led to charges against the Lieberman campaign of political opportunism and lack of respect for the political process.[38] Lieberman received strong support from many prominent conservative pundits and publications. \"[H]is most vocal support came from places like The Weekly Standard, National Review, and Commentary Magazine; Sean Hannity, Bill Kristol and right-wing radio hosts cheered for his victory.\"[39] Thus, \"Lieberman was able to run in the general election as the de facto Republican candidate — every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him — and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents.\"[40]\n\nOn August 9, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and DSCC Chair Chuck Schumer issued the following joint statement on the Connecticut Senate race:\n\nThe Democratic voters of Connecticut have spoken and chosen Ned Lamont as their nominee. Both we and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) fully support Mr. Lamont's candidacy. Congratulations to Ned on his victory and on a race well run. Joe Lieberman has been an effective Democratic Senator for Connecticut and for America. But the perception was that he was too close to George Bush and this election was, in many respects, a referendum on the President more than anything else. The results bode well for Democratic victories in November and our efforts to take the country in a new direction.[41]\n\nAccording to The Hill, a Democratic aide to a high-ranking senator commented that Lieberman might be stripped of his Democratic privileges in the Senate. \"At this point Lieberman cannot expect to just keep his seniority,\" said the aide. \"He can't run against a Democrat and expect to waltz back to the caucus with the same seniority as before. It would give the view that the Senate is a country club rather than representative of a political party and political movement.\"[42]\n\nLieberman won with approximately 50% of the vote, and served a six-year term from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2013. Exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33% of Democrats, 54% of independents and 70% of Republicans.[43] Lieberman won every county in the November general election.[44]\n\n2006 United States Senate election, Connecticut[45] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 113,251 10.0% Turnout 1,134,777 Independent gain from Democratic\n\nDelaware\n\n[edit]\n\nDelaware election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Tom Carper Jan Ting Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 170,567 69,744 Percentage 67.1% 27.4%\n\nCounty results\n\nCarper: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nThomas Carper\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nThomas Carper\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Democrat Thomas R.

He warned the state would lose all clout in Washington if the state's two US Senators, both of whom were over 80 years old, left office within a short time of each other.

Snowe won by a landslide even as Democrats won across the country due to her being a centrist Republican and having a very high approval rating in Maine. Meanwhile, her Democratic opponent in the 2006 election, Jean Hay Bright, had never been elected to political office.\n\nDemocrats' best hope for taking the seat was that Snowe would retire rather than run in 2006, but there was never any indication that she seriously considered not running for re-election.[55]\n\nThe filing deadline for major party candidates was March 15, 2006. The primary was held June 13, 2006. Olympia Snowe was unopposed for the Republican nomination; Jean Hay Bright narrowly won the Democratic nod with 50.7% of the vote against Eric Mehnert.\n\nHay Bright announced her candidacy in May 2005. Hay Bright was previously an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination to the House in 1994 and the Senate in 1996.\n\nThe race had been called by FOX News for Snowe 23 minutes after the polls had closed. Snowe won re-election by a greater margin than any U.S. Senator that cycle except Indiana's Richard Lugar, who faced only a Libertarian opponent.

Ben Cardin, then a congressman since 1987, was the only other major candidate until September 2005, when Dennis F. Rasmussen, a former Baltimore County Executive, American University professor Allan Lichtman, and wealthy Potomac businessman Josh Rales entered the contest. Thirteen other candidates subsequently also entered the primary. As of August 2006, Cardin had raised more than $4.8 million and collected endorsements from a number of Democratic politicians, the AFL–CIO, and The Washington Post; Mfume had raised over $1.2 million and collected endorsements from the Maryland State Teachers Association, Progressive Maryland, former Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, the National Organization for Women, and Maryland Congressmen Elijah Cummings and Al Wynn.\n\nDemocratic primary[57] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 589,695 100%\n\nMichael S.

Pessimism about the state's economic future had left Michigan ranked 49th nationally between 2000 and 2005 in retaining young adults. Since its peak, Detroit had lost over a million people. Bouchard claimed that the incumbent had accomplished nothing, dubbing her \"Do-Nothing Debbie.\"[68]\n\nFrom a long way out, Stabenow looked like she might be vulnerable. President Bush even came to Michigan to campaign for Bouchard, raising over $1,000,000 for him. However, Bouchard never won a single poll. By October the Republican Party, started taking resources out of Michigan to focus on closer races, essentially ceding the race to Stabenow. Stabenow would go on to win the election easily, capturing nearly 57% of the vote. Stabenow did well throughout Michigan but performed better in heavily populated cities like Detroit, Lansing, Ann Arbor, and Kalamazoo. Bouchard did win Grand Rapids, a typical Republican area. He also won in many rural areas around the state. However, Bouchard failed to put a dent in Stabenow's lead, largely due to her strong performance in heavily populated areas.

Carnahan had been appointed to the Senate seat following the posthumous election of her husband Mel Carnahan, who had died in a plane crash shortly before the 2000 election. Talent was running for a full term, his Democratic opponent was Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill. Early on the morning of November 8, Talent conceded defeat to McCaskill, having faced considerable political headwinds. Talent lost the election with 47% of the vote, to 50% of the vote for McCaskill.\n\nThe election was always expected to be very close, which seems fitting for a seat that has changed hands twice, both by very narrow margins, within the last six years. In 2000, the late Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator John Ashcroft 50% to 48%. Two years later in a special election held for the seat, incumbent Senator Jean Carnahan lost an even closer election to former Congressman Talent, 50% to 49%.\n\nMissouri was seen as the nation's bellwether state throughout the 20th century: It had voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1900, except for 1956 (when the state narrowly favored Adlai Stevenson over Dwight D. Eisenhower). Missouri's bellwether status was due to the fact that it not only voted for the electoral victor, but that its returns usually mirrored national returns.\n\nThe state itself is a geographically central state, bordered by both the edges of Southern and Midwestern regions. In statewide contests for much of the 20th century, Missouri favored the Democratic Party. In recent elections, the Republican Party (GOP) has emerged in statewide contests. The election of 2004 was an important one; as George W. Bush was re-elected he carried Missouri. But this time his margin in the state was greater than it was nationwide. Bush won the Presidency 51% to 48%, he carried Missouri 53% to 46%. This trend had begun in 2000, when Bush lost the national popular vote to Al Gore 47% to 48% but still won Missouri, 50% to 47%. Bush's victory also saw Republicans triumph in several statewide contests; Senator Kit Bond was re-elected by a decisive 56% to 43% margin and Matt Blunt won the election for Governor, narrowly defeating state auditor Claire McCaskill 51% to 48%. The GOP also captured control of the state legislature for the first time in eighty years.\n\nTalent, anticipating a tough re-election battle and attempting to dissuade challengers, had accumulated a large campaign fund.[76] For most of 2005, he had no opposition. State Senator Chuck Graham had briefly entered the race early in the year, but dropped out soon after. However, on August 30, 2005, Democrat Claire McCaskill announced her intention to run for Talent's Senate seat.\n\nMcCaskill started with a large financial disadvantage, but she was also an experienced candidate with high name recognition. McCaskill had run two successful campaigns for state auditor. She was also a candidate for governor in 2004, when she defeated the incumbent Democratic Governor Bob Holden in the primary election but lost with 48% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBoth Talent and McCaskill faced unknowns in their respective primaries on August 8, 2006, and defeated them soundly.\n\nThe Missouri contest was seen as vitally important to control of the United States Senate; as a toss-up election between two strong candidates, the race was expected to attract a lot of interest as well as money spent on ads and turning out supporters. If Talent won, then a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate depended upon victories in Tennessee, where the Republican Bob Corker won, and Virginia, where Democrat Jim Webb won; the Democrats needed to win six seats to take control of the chamber with 51 seats. To do this, they would need to retain their 19 incumbent seats, win the four Republican-held seats of Montana, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania (where Democratic chances seemed above 50%, and Democrats won all 4.) and two of the following three \"toss-up\" races: Missouri, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIt is believed[by whom?] that statewide ballot issues drove the November 2006 vote. Talent was on the opposite of the majority of voters in this poll on just about every issue: 66% of Missouri voters favored raising the minimum wage to $6.50 an hour; 62% of Missouri voters favored raising taxes to replace Medicaid funding cut by the current Republican Governor, Matt Blunt; 54% opposed a law that would require all Missourians to show a photo ID before they vote; 58% favored campaign donation limitations; and 66% favored restoring Medicaid coverage to about 90,000 Missourians who lost coverage when Blunt and the Republican legislature tightened eligibility requirements.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, 62% favored a ballot proposal that would allow all types of embryonic stem cell research allowed under federal law - a measure Talent had recently announced that he was against.[77]\n\nOn election night the race was, as expected, too close to call. With 85% of the vote in and with still no call, McCaskill claimed victory. At the time McCaskill declared victory, she was ahead by a vote margin of 867,683 to Talent's 842,251 votes; in percentage terms, with 85% of the vote in, McCaskill led Talent, 49% to 48%. Finally, at 11:38 p.m. Central Time the Associated Press called McCaskill as the winner. St. Louis County, adjacent to St. Louis, and Jackson County, home of Kansas City, are probably what pushed McCaskill over the finish line.\n\nMissouri general election Party Candidate Votes % Plurality 48,314 2.3% Turnout 2,128,459 Democratic gain from Republican Swing\n\nMontana\n\n[edit]\n\nMontana election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Jon Tester Conrad Burns Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 199,845 196,283 Percentage 49.16% 48.29%\n\nCounty results\n\nTester: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nBurns: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nConrad Burns\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nJon Tester\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Republican Conrad Burns was running for re-election to a fourth term but was defeated by Democrat Jon Tester, President of the Montana State Senate, by a margin of 0.87%, or 3,562 votes out of 406,505 votes.\n\nBurns was first elected as a United States senator from Montana in 1988, when he defeated Democratic incumbent John Melcher in a close race, 51% to 48%. Burns was re-elected 62.4% to 37.6%, over Jack Mudd in the Republican Revolution year of 1994. In 2000, Burns faced the well-financed Brian Schweitzer whom he beat 50.6% to 47.2%.\n\nIn 2000, George W. Bush carried Montana 58% to 33% in the race for president, but Burns won by 3.4%. Since the direct election of Senators began in 1913, Burns is only the second Republican Montana has elected to the U.S. Senate. Also, for thirty-two straight years, 1952 to 1984, Montana elected only Democratic Senators.\n\nBurns's involvement in the Jack Abramoff scandal made him vulnerable.[78] A SurveyUSA poll released in March 2006 found that 38% of Montanans approved of him, while 52% disapproved of him.[79] Polls against leading Democratic candidates had him below his challengers.[80]\n\nOn May 31, 2006, Richards, citing the closeness of the race, and his own position (third) in the polls, withdrew from the race, and threw his support to Tester.[81] Morrison started off strong in the race for the Democratic nomination for Senator, collecting $1.05 million as of the start of 2006, including $409,241 in the last three months of 2005.[82] but Morrison's advantages in fundraising and name identification did not translate into a lead in the polls.[83] Later, the race was called a \"deadlock,\"[84] but Tester continued to gather momentum.\n\nDemocratic primary[85] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 108,198 100.00%\n\nRepublican primary[85] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 97,473 100.00%\n\nThe race was expected to be close, due to Burns's previous narrow winning margins and recent political scandal involving him personally; Republican incumbents everywhere were facing more challenging races in 2006 due to the waning popularity of Congress and the leadership of President George W. Bush. In July 2006, the Rasmussen report viewed Burns as the \"second most vulnerable Senator seeking re-election this year (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum was still the most vulnerable).\"[86]\n\nSenator Conrad Burns of Montana faced a strong challenge from Brian Schweitzer in 2000, being re-elected by 3.4% in a state that went for Bush twice by margins of over 20%.[87][88] This, combined with the increasing strength of the state Democratic party[89] and accusations of ethical issues related to the Jack Abramoff scandal,[90] made this a highly competitive race.\n\nOn July 27, Burns was forced to apologize after he confronted out of state firefighters who were preparing to leave Montana after helping contain a summer forest fire and directly questioned their competence and skill; Burns was strongly criticized.[91]\n\nOn August 31, in a letter faxed to the office of Montana governor Brian Schweitzer, Burns urged the governor, a Democrat, to declare a fire state of emergency and activate the Montana Army National Guard for firefighting. Schweitzer had already declared such a state of emergency on July 11 — thus, activating the Montana Army National Guard. He issued a second declaration on August 11. A Burns spokesman said the senator was \"pretty sure\" Schweitzer had already issued such a disaster declaration, but just wanted to make sure. \"The genesis of the letter was just to make sure that all the bases were covered,\" Pendleton said. \"This is not a political football. It's just a cover-the-bases letter and certainly casts no aspersions on the governor.\"[92]\n\nMontana general election[93] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,562 0.88% −2.44% Turnout 406,505 Democratic gain from Republican Swing\n\nDue to errors with polling machines the Montana count was delayed well into Wednesday November 8.

The seat was previously held by Democratic Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine. After Corzine resigned and was sworn in Governor, Corzine appointed Congressman Menendez on January 18, 2006. Menendez was challenged by Republican Thomas Kean, Jr. and seven other candidates. Filing for the primary closed on April 10, 2006. The primary election was held June 6, 2006.[107] Menendez became the first Hispanic to hold a U.S. Senate seat from New Jersey, and was the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state.\n\nMenendez won the Democratic primary, with 86% of the vote, against James D. Kelly, Jr.\n\nRepublican John P. Ginty, associate director with Standard & Poor's represented the conservative wing of the New Jersey Republican party. Kean was a moderate, and the son of the former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean. Kean won the primary by a 3–1 margin.[108]\n\nThe biggest factors in the New Jersey Senate race may have had little to do with the candidates involved and more to do with Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine and President George W. Bush.\n\nIn mid-summer, Jon Corzine and the Democratic-controlled state legislature held a brief shutdown of state government, which ultimately resulted in a sales tax increase, among other things.\n\nIn a September 2006 poll, SurveyUSA found that Corzine received an approval rate of only 43%, with 48% of the state disapproving.[109] Since Menendez had been appointed by Corzine, some pundits argued that this would be a resonating factor with a number of voters.\n\nAccording to a separate September 2006 poll, SurveyUSA found that the state of New Jersey had a rather high disapproval rating for Republican President George W. Bush, with 64% disapproving and only 32% approving.[110] This led some to argue that voters would take their discontent with Bush out on Kean in the November election.[111]\n\nIndeed, some pollsters demonstrated that concerns over the Iraq War and discontent with President Bush solidified the Democratic base in October's advertising blitz, and won over enough independents to seal of fate of the Republican nominee.[112] On the eve of the election, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll reported that 65% likely voters said that the US invasion of Iraq was a mistake, \"including nine of ten Democrats and six of ten independents.\"[113] Observers also pointed out that \"from the beginning, [Menendez] made much of his 2002 vote against the Iraq War Resolution, often referring to it as one of the most important votes of his career. He made it clear as well that he intended to make the race a referendum on the President.\"[114]\n\nOthers attributed Kean's early strong showing in the polls of this blue state to uninformed voters confusing the three-year state senator with his father, the popular former governor and 9/11 Commission chairman.[115]\n\nBecause of Kean's perceived liberalism on social issues, he has been labeled by some conservatives as a \"Republican in Name Only\".[116]\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Kean held a fundraiser in Ocean County featuring First Lady Laura Bush. It was here that both Senator Kean and Mrs. Bush pointed out that Kean is not George W. Bush, claiming that Senator Menendez seems to confuse the two.[117]\n\nOn June 16, 2006, at a New Jersey Association of Counties speaking event in Atlantic City, Kean and his aides beat a hasty retreat from the ballroom engagement and \"stampeded\" into an elevator in an abortive attempt to avoid the press, only to exit on the same floor as they had entered. Kean declined to answer questions about the scathing attacks on his integrity which his opponent had delivered minutes earlier, instead opting to repeat \"a few slogans.\"[118]\n\nIn late June, the Associated Press reported that Kean's campaign was planning a \"Swift Boat\"-style film accusing Menendez of involvement in a New Jersey mob-connected kickback scheme \"despite public records and statements disputing that claim.\" The AP article noted that \"[f]our former federal prosecutors who oversaw the case have said Menendez was never involved in any wrongdoing.\"[119] The airing of unsubstantiated [by whom?] allegations years or even decades old is a hallmark of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign attack style, which gained notoriety during the 2004 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn mid-September, The Star-Ledger reported that Sen. Menendez had declined a national debate with Kean on the popular Sunday morning talk-show, Meet the Press. A Menendez spokesperson stated that the incumbent Democrat would prefer to focus on local citizens and press. Menendez did agree to take place in three locally aired debates with Kean, which will be aired between October 7–17.[120] Kean withdrew from one of the scheduled debates to which he had previously committed, an October 14, 2006, debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters, insisting on a national TV debate as a condition of his participation.[121]\n\nBoth candidates agreed to participate in a virtual debate sponsored by the nonpartisan Hall Institute of Public Policy - New Jersey which provided \"an unprecedented opportunity for candidates and citizens to engage in an interactive forum on the important issues confronting\" New Jersey. Beginning in July and running through Election Day in November, the institute submitted questions to the candidates and then posted their responses on its website.[122]\n\nNew Jersey general election[123] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 203,068 9.0% Turnout 2,250,070 Democratic hold Swing 3.26%\n\nNew Mexico\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Mexico election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Jeff Bingaman Allen McCulloch Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 394,365 163,826 Percentage 70.6% 29.3%\n\nCounty results\n\nBingaman: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nJeff Bingaman\n\nDemocratic\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nJeff Bingaman\n\nDemocratic\n\nIncumbent Democrat Jeff Bingaman won re-election to a fifth term.\n\nDemocratic primary[124] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 115,198 100.00%\n\nDavid Pfeffer, Santa Fe City Councilman announced on August 23, 2005, that he would be entering the primary.

Pre-election stories in the U.S. media suggested that the national Republican Party may have given up on saving Senator DeWine's senate seat before election date. Sherrod Brown, former Ohio Secretary of State and U.S. Representative from Ohio's 13th district was the Democratic candidate, and the eventual winner.\n\nPaul Hackett, Iraq War veteran announced on February 13, 2006, that he would withdraw from the race, because national party leaders had decided that Sherrod Brown had a better chance against DeWine. The Plain Dealer (2/18/06) also reported that there had been concerns that Hackett might not have had enough money after the primary to run the statewide advertising customary for a Senate campaign.\n\nDemocratic primary Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 747,404 100.00%\n\nBoth Republican challengers, engineer William G. Pierce and David Smith, candidate for OH-02 in 2005, campaigned as conservative alternatives to DeWine, citing DeWine's support for legal abortion and his role as one of the Republican members of the Gang of 14 who compromised with Democrats in a dispute about judicial appointments. DeWine won the primary 71.82% of the votes.[12]\n\nBecause this race was targeted by Democrats, it made it all the more important to the GOP, who desired to retain Senate control. John McClelland, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party said, \"It's vitally important to the Republican Party as a whole, so I think that's why you see the president coming to Ohio to support Mike DeWine. Phil Singer, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said, \"Mike DeWine Senior is in for the fight of his life, make no mistake about it\".[132]\n\nOn July 14, 2006, DeWine's campaign began airing TV commercials depicting a smoking World Trade Center. \"The senator was notified ... by a reporter at U.S. News & World Report that the image of the burning Twin Towers could not have depicted the actual event because the smoke was blowing the wrong way.\"[133] DeWine's campaign admitted that the video was actually a still photo of the World Trade Center with smoke digitally added.[133] He also was criticized for using an emotionally charged image to attack his challenger.[134]\n\nAnother of DeWine's ads suggested that opponent Sherrod Brown did not pay his taxes for thirteen years. This claim led to the Associated Press reporting on October 19 that, \"Several Ohio television stations have stopped airing a Republican ad because state documents contradict the ad's accusation that Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Sherrod Brown didn't pay an unemployment tax bill for 13 years.\" Brown produced a commercial citing these facts.[135] DeWine's ads were changed to state only that he had failed to pay his unemployment taxes until legal action was taken against him.\n\nAccording to an article in the October 16, 2006, edition of The New York Times, top Republican party officials on the national level determined that DeWine would probably be defeated and were moving financial support from his race to other Republican senatorial candidates they felt were more likely to win.[136]\n\nBrown was called the winner right when the polls closed at 7:30. DeWine had the second worst performance of a Republican incumbent in 2006. Only Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania had a worse performance. While DeWine was able to win rural counties in western Ohio, Brown managed to win most eastern Ohio counties, especially in heavily populated areas. DeWine's narrow 2,000 vote victory in Hamilton County which is home to Cincinnati, came nowhere close to making a dent in Brown's lead. Brown would go on to be re-elected in 2012 and again in 2018.\n\nOhio general election Party Candidate Votes % Majority 452,690 12.34% Turnout 4,019,236 53.25% Democratic gain from Republican Swing -17.9\n\nPennsylvania\n\n[edit]\n\nPennsylvania election\n\nIncumbent Republican Rick Santorum ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Bob Casey, Jr.[137] Casey was elected to serve between January 3, 2007, and January 3, 2013. Santorum trailed Casey in every public poll taken during the campaign. Casey's margin of victory (nearly 18% of those who voted) was the largest ever for a Democratic Senate nominee in Pennsylvania, and the largest margin of victory for a Senate challenger in the 2006 elections.[138]\n\nBob Casey, Jr., State Treasurer, former State Auditor General and son of former Governor Bob Casey, Sr.[139] won the Democratic primary.[140]\n\nDemocratic primary, May 16, 2006[141][142] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 115,591 68.9% N/A Turnout 744,862 +1.3%\n\nSantorum was unopposed in the Republican primary. Republican John Featherman (not to be confused with John Fetterman), who ran against Santorum in 2000 as a Libertarian, had been expected to challenge him in the 2006 Republican primary. However, Featherman withdrew his candidacy after a GOP petition challenge because he did not have the necessary number of signatures to get on the ballot.[143]\n\nRepublican strategists took as a bad omen Santorum's primary result in 2006, in which he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Republican gubernatorial nominee Lynn Swann, also unopposed in the primary, garnered 22,000 more votes statewide than Santorum in the primary, meaning thousands of Republican voters abstained from endorsing Santorum for another Senate term. This may have been partly due to Santorum's support for Arlen Specter, over Congressman Pat Toomey in the 2004 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Even though Santorum was perceived to be only slightly less conservative than Toomey, he joined virtually all of the state and national Republican establishment in supporting the moderate Specter. This led many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans to consider Santorum's support of Specter to be a betrayal of their cause.[144][145][146] However, Santorum said that he supported Specter to avoid risking a Toomey loss in the general election, which would have prevented President George W. Bush's judicial nominees from getting through the Senate.[147] Santorum said Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito would not have been confirmed without the help of Specter, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time.[147]\n\nPennsylvania general election[148] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 710,204 17.36% +10.5% Turnout 4,081,043 Democratic gain from Republican Swing -24.4%\n\nAt 9:45 pm EST on Election Night, Santorum called Casey to concede defeat.[149]\n\nRhode Island\n\n[edit]\n\nRhode Island election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Sheldon Whitehouse Lincoln Chafee Party Democratic Republican Popular vote 206,109 179,001 Percentage 53.5% 46.5%\n\nCounty results\n\nMunicipality results\n\nWhitehouse: 50–60% 60–70% 70–80%\n\nChafee: 50–60% 60–70%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nDemocratic\n\nThe election was won by Sheldon Whitehouse, former Attorney General of Rhode Island and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island.[150] Republican Lincoln Chafee was seeking re-election for a second full term to the seat he had held since 1999, when he was appointed to fill the vacancy created by the death of his father John Chafee. Lincoln Chafee won election to the seat in 2000.\n\nWhitehouse was endorsed by U.S. Senator Jack Reed, U.S. Congressmen Jim Langevin and Patrick J. Kennedy, as well as by former candidate Matt Brown. Carl Sheeler, a former U.S. Marine, a business owner, and an adjunct professor of business, ran on a more progressive platform. Ultimately, however, Whitehouse would trounce his competition in the primary on September 12, winning his party's support by a large margin.\n\nDemocratic primary[151] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 84,984 100.00%\n\nIncumbent Lincoln Chafee was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party in the Senate by 2006, and was challenged for the Republican nomination by Steve Laffey, Mayor of Cranston, who had criticized Chafee for his liberal voting record in the Senate. In early 2006, the Club for Growth, a pro-tax cut political action committee, sent a series of mailings to Rhode Island Republicans attacking Chafee's positions and voting record.\n\nThe national GOP supported Chafee in the primary campaign, believing that he was the most likely candidate to hold the seat in the general election. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Laura Bush appeared at fundraisers for Chafee, while Senator Bill Frist's PAC donated to Chafee. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also ran ads in the state supporting Chafee. Steve Laffey, however, picked up many endorsements from Republican town committees throughout Rhode Island, the national group Club for Growth, and former candidate for the party's presidential nomination Steve Forbes. On July 10, 2006, the National Republican Senatorial Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Laffey, saying that he had included a political communication in tax bills mailed to residents of Cranston.[152]\n\nRepublican primary[153] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 64,483 100.00%\n\nDemocrats believed that this was one of the most likely Senate seats to switch party control, due to the Democratic tilt of Rhode Island, as well as the fact that Chafee needed to expend part of his campaign fund to win the Republican primary election. Chafee's approval ratings also took a beating from his primary battle with Laffey and may have hurt him in the general election. Another factor that hurt Chafee was the fact that Whitehouse, the Democratic nominee, had a huge head start on him, as he was able to campaign with little opposition for at least half the year and had not had to contend with a major opponent until the general election campaign. Rhode Islanders' historically large disapproval ratings for President Bush and the Republican Party as a whole was another major hurdle for Chafee.\n\nWhitehouse and Chafee very rarely disagreed on political issues. Socially, they agreed almost 100% of the time. Chafee was against the Bush tax cuts, indicating his ideology was liberal-leaning. On some fiscal issues they disagreed on such as on social security and free trade.[154][155]\n\nRhode Island general election[156] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 27,093 7.04% −8.69% Turnout 384,993 Democratic gain from Republican Swing\n\nWhitehouse carried Providence County, which contains approximately 60% of the state's population, with 59% to Chafee's 41%.

Chafee also took Kent County by a small margin, while Whitehouse was victorious by extremely slim margins in Bristol and Newport counties.\n\nAfter the election, when asked by a reporter if he thought his defeat would help the country by giving Democrats control of Congress, he replied, \"to be honest, yes.\"[157]\n\nTennessee\n\n[edit]\n\nTennessee election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Bob Corker Harold Ford, Jr. Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 929,911 879,976 Percentage 50.7% 48.0%\n\nCorker: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70%\n\nFord: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nBill Frist\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nBob Corker\n\nRepublican\n\nWinner Bob Corker replaced Republican Bill Frist who retired upon the end of his second term in 2007.

The race between Ford and Corker was one of the most competitive Senate races of 2006, with Corker winning the race by less than three percent of the vote. Corker was the only non-incumbent Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Since 1994, the Republican Party has held both of Tennessee's Senate seats.\n\nFord is known nationally for his keynote address at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California, and for a challenge to Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the House Democrats. Rosalind Kurita, a six-term state Senator from Clarksville, Tennessee, dropped out of the race in early April 2006. No official reason was given, but Ford enjoyed substantial support from Democratic leaders in Washington and Nashville and held a substantial lead in fundraising. Ford won the Democratic nomination by a wide margin in the primary.[158]\n\nOnly 11 percent of Tennesseans knew who Corker was when he began running for the Senate race.[159] All three Republicans had run statewide campaigns in the past, albeit unsuccessful ones: former U.S. Representative Ed Bryant for the 2002 Republican Senate nomination, losing to Lamar Alexander; businessman and former Mayor of Chattanooga Bob Corker for the U.S. Senate in 1994, losing to Frist in the Republican primary; and former U.S. Representative Van Hilleary for Tennessee Governor in 2002, losing to Democrat Phil Bredesen. Corker won the nomination by obtaining 48% of the primary vote to Bryant's 34% and Hilleary's 17%.[158]\n\nNot long after Corker's primary victory was assured, Ford, at a rally of his supporters attended by Bill Clinton, challenged Corker to seven televised debates across the state. In response, Corker said he will debate Ford but did not agree to Ford's request of seven debates.[158] Both of Corker's primary opponents endorsed Corker immediately after they conceded the race.[158]\n\nBefore a Corker press conference in Memphis on October 20, Ford approached Corker in a parking lot and confronted his opponent about Iraq in front of local news cameras, pointing out that some of Corker's fellow Republicans are changing their minds on the war and wanting to debate him about the issue. In response, Corker said, \"I came to talk about ethics, and I have a press conference. And I think it's a true sign of desperation that you would pull your bus up when I'm having a press conference.\" Ford replied that he could never find Corker. Corker then walked away to his press conference.[160]\n\nOn November 2, Nielsen Monitor Plus indicated that the Corker campaign had purchased more television advertising than any other Senate candidate in the country through October 15.[161]\n\nA particularly negative ad titled \"Who Hasn't?\" sponsored by the Republican National Committee (\"RNC\") that aired during the third and fourth weeks of October gained national attention and condemnation from both Ford and Corker. The ad portrayed a scantily clad white woman (Johanna Goldsmith) acting as a Playboy bunny who \"met Harold at the Playboy party\" and invites Ford to \"call me\".[162][163]\n\nResponding to questions about the ad, a Ford spokesperson said that Ford went to a 2005 Playboy-sponsored Super Bowl party that was attended by more than 3,000 people,[164] and Ford himself said that he likes \"football and girls\" and makes no apology for either.[165]\n\nDemocratic primary results Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 421,900 100.00\n\nRepublican primary results Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 481,117 100.00\n\nTennessee general election[166] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 49,935 2.72% Turnout 1,833,695 47.49% Republican hold Swing -14.39\n\nTexas\n\n[edit]\n\nTexas election\n\nIncumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison won re-election to a third term over Democratic attorney Barbara Ann Radnofsky.\n\nThe Democratic nominee who had never run for public office and was expected to face an uphill battle in the general election, especially in a state that has not elected a Democrat statewide since 1994 and against a historically popular Hutchison. Since neither Radnofsky nor her main opponent, Gene Kelly, had received a majority of votes in the Democratic primary, a runoff was held April 11, 2006, which Radnofsky won. Radnofsky's campaign platform is available on her website. [13] Scott Lanier Jameson won the Libertarian Party nomination at the party's state convention on June 10, 2006, defeating Timothy Wade and Ray Salinas. Arthur W. Loux, a Roman Forest City Councilman and a member of the Minutemen, was running as an independent.\n\nHutchison co-sponsored legislation supporting the creation of a constitutional amendment that would limit terms for senators but had been quoted saying that she would only leave after two terms if such a law applied to all senators.[167] After deciding not to challenge Governor Rick Perry this year, as had been widely speculated, Hutchison was running for a third term.[168] She had no opposition in the Republican primary and had approval ratings in the 60 percent range going into the General Election [14], although they had been slipping rapidly.\n\nTexas general election[169] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,106,587 25.7% Turnout 4,314,663 Republican hold Swing\n\nUtah\n\n[edit]\n\nUtah election\n\n← 2000\n\n2012 →\n\nNominee Orrin Hatch Pete Ashdown Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 356,238 177,459 Percentage 62.5% 31.1%\n\nCounty results\n\nHatch: 40–50% 50–60% 60–70% 70–80% 80–90%\n\nAshdown: 40–50%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nOrrin Hatch\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. Senator\n\nOrrin Hatch\n\nRepublican\n\nIncumbent Republican Orrin Hatch won re-election to a sixth term over Democrat Pete Ashdown, the founder and CEO of Utah's oldest Internet service provider, XMission.\n\nUtah general election[170] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 178,779 31.30% −2.77% Turnout 571,252 Republican hold Swing\n\nHatch won all but one county with 60% to 70% of the vote.

Many Democratic politicians across the country endorsed Sanders, and no Democrat was on the ballot. The state committee of the Vermont Democratic Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders.[171] Sanders won the open seat with 65% of the vote.\n\nFour candidates ran in the Democratic primary.[171][172] Sanders won the primary, but declined the nomination, leaving no Democratic nominee on the ballot. This victory ensured that no Democrat would appear on the general election ballot to split the vote with Sanders, an ally of the Democrats, who has been supported by leaders in the Democratic Party.[173]\n\nIn mid-August 2006, the campaign heated up considerably, with Tarrant fully engaged in heavy media advertising, most of which criticized Sanders's public stances. Tarrant ran several ads accusing Sanders of representing himself differently from his voting record in the House of Representatives, citing such examples as Sanders's votes against Amber Alert and against increased penalties for child pornography. Sanders responded with an ad stating that Tarrant's claims are \"dishonest\" and \"distort my record\" and presented what he viewed as more accurate explanations of his voting record.[174]\n\nVermont general election[175] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 86,741 33.1% Turnout 262,419 100% Independent hold Swing\n\nSanders won a majority of the votes in every county in the state, with 57% as his lowest county total.\n\nVirginia\n\n[edit]\n\nVirginia election\n\nIncumbent Republican George Allen ran for re-election to a second term, but lost in a narrow race to Democrat Jim Webb.\n\nAllen, who previously served as Governor of Virginia and was considered a possible candidate for president in 2008, was running for his second term. Webb, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, writer and former Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan won the Democratic nomination after being drafted by netroots activists, such as those at the blog Raising Kaine. Polls clearly favored Allen through mid-August, when he was caught on videotape on August 11 twice using an ethnic slur in reference to a Webb campaign volunteer, S.R. Sidarth, who is of Indian ancestry. Allen denied any prejudice in the comment, but his lead shrank considerably. Still, he led in most polls until late October, when several surveys showed Webb with a lead — mostly within the margin of error. The election was not decided until nearly 48 hours after the polls closed, when Allen, behind by a margin of about 0.3%, conceded on November 9, 2006. With all of the other Senate races decided, the outcome swung control of the Senate to the Democrats.[177]\n\nThe week before the primary, businessman Harris Miller said a Webb campaign flier characterized him in an anti-Semitic way; Webb denied that it did.[178]\n\nDemocratic primary[179] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 155,784 100.00%\n\nWebb focused on his early and outspoken opposition to the war in Iraq, which Allen supported. In a September 4, 2002, opinion piece in The Washington Post, Webb wrote: \"A long-term occupation of Iraq would beyond doubt require an adjustment of force levels elsewhere, and could eventually diminish American influence in other parts of the world.\"[180] Webb's son, a U.S. Marine, served in Iraq.\n\nAllen and Webb differed on other issues. Allen is anti-abortion; Webb supports abortion rights. Allen supported George W. Bush's tax cuts while Webb said more of the benefits should have gone to middle-class Americans.[181] Both candidates supported the death penalty, right-to-work laws, and Second Amendment rights.\n\nVirginia general election[182] Party Candidate Votes % Plurality 9,329 0.39% -4.19% Turnout 2,370,445 Democratic gain from Republican Swing\n\nVirginia has historically been one of the more Republican Southern states: for instance it was the only Southern state not to vote for Jimmy Carter in 1976, its congressional delegation was mostly conservative, with eight of eleven Congressmen and both Senators belonging to the Republican Party prior to the 2006 election. This made Virginia's Congressional delegation the most Republican of any Southern state. Despite this, Democrats had won the previous two gubernatorial races, in 2001 and 2005. The state's political majority has been changing from conservative white to a mixture of races, especially Hispanic. The state is increasingly diverse; it had the highest percentage of Asians (4.7%, according to the 2005 American Community Survey of the U.S. census) of any Southern state. 9.9% of Virginians are foreign-born.[183] Webb, like Governor Tim Kaine in 2005, won the four major fast-growing counties in Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C.; Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Arlington. President Barack Obama carried Virginia by a 6.3% margin over Republican Senator John McCain.\n\nWhen results began coming in, Allen quickly built a sizeable lead, which began to narrow as the night went on. With 90% of precincts reporting, Allen held a lead of about 30,000 votes [15], or about 1.5%. However, as votes began to come in from population-heavy Richmond, Webb narrowed the gap, and pulled ahead within the last 1 or 2% of precincts to report. Preliminary results showed Webb holding a lead of 8,942 votes,[184] and many news organizations hesitated to call the election for either candidate until the next day. At 8:41 pm EST on November 8, AP declared Webb the winner.[185] In all Virginia elections, if the margin of defeat is less than half of a percentage point, the Commonwealth of Virginia allows the apparent losing candidate to request a recount, paid for by the local jurisdictions. If the margin of defeat is between one and one-half of a percentage point, the losing candidate is still entitled to request a recount, but must cover its expense.[186][187] Because the difference was less than 0.5%, George Allen could have requested a recount paid for by the government, but declined to make such a request. That was likely because:\n\nEven in large jurisdictions, recounts — such as those in Florida in 2000 and Washington's 2004 gubernatorial election — rarely result in a swing of more than 1,000 votes, and Allen was trailing by almost 10,000 in the initial count. In particular, almost all votes in this Virginia election were cast using electronic voting machines, whose results are unlikely to change in a recount.\n\nThere was wide speculation that calling for a recount (and still losing) would give Allen a \"sore loser\" label, which would hurt his future election campaigns, including what some speculated might still involve a 2008 presidential run. However, after losing the senatorial election, on December 10, 2006, Allen announced that he would not be running for president in 2008.\n\nWashington\n\n[edit]\n\nWashington election\n\nIncumbent Democrat Maria Cantwell won re-election to a second term.\n\nThe filing deadline was July 28, 2006, with the primary held September 19, 2006.[188] Cantwell consistently led in polling throughout the race, although political analysts saw her as vulnerable this election cycle due to her extremely narrow win in 2000 and discontent among progressive voters. In November, The National Journal ranked Cantwell's seat as number 13 of the top 20 races to watch based on the likelihood of switching party control, and the third-highest Democratic seat likely to flip.[189] However, in an election marked by discontent over the Republican leadership in D.C., Cantwell easily won by a 17% margin of victory.[190]\n\nStatewide politics in Washington had been dominated by the Democratic Party for many years. The governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer, state auditor, and insurance commissioner were all Democrats, while only secretary of state, attorney general, and commissioner of public lands were Republican. Of the nine representatives Washington sent to the House of Representatives, six were Democrats. Democrat Patty Murray was the state's senior senator. Cantwell won her initial election to the Senate in 2000 over Slade Gorton by 2,229 votes. Due to the closeness of that race, and the close gubernatorial contest between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi in November 2004, many Republicans believed they had a strong chance of capturing Cantwell's seat in 2006.\n\nOn March 9, 2006, Aaron Dixon announced his decision to seek the Green Party's nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging Cantwell on her continued support for the U.S. presence in Iraq and the USA PATRIOT Act. On May 13, 2006, Mr. Dixon secured the party's nomination at the Green Party of Washington state's Spring Convention.\n\nInitially, Cantwell had two challengers from within the Democratic primary, both of them taking strong stances against the Iraq war that brought attention to Cantwell's votes for the Iraq Resolution and against a timeline for withdrawal. Three other Democrats also entered the primary race.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, the incumbent Democratic Senator from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, lost his primary race to challenger Ned Lamont by 52%-48%, and then ran as an Independent in the general election. A great deal of attention was focused on this race as an early barometer of both anti-incumbent and anti-war sentiment nationwide. Comparisons were made between Lieberman's troubles and Cantwell's re-election bid, citing Cantwell's vote in favor of the Iraq Resolution that led to the war, her refusal to say she regretted the vote, and her vote against a timetable for withdrawal.[191][192]\n\nUnlike Lamont's campaign, Cantwell's anti-war opponents' campaigns received much less funding and did not have the same support from the blogosphere that brought Lamont to prominence and improved his name recognition. Also, unlike Lieberman, Cantwell altered her position on the war during her campaign and criticized the Bush Administration for its conduct of the war. She also hired her most vocal anti-war primary opponent, Mark Wilson, at $8,000-a-month salary, a move that was described by political commentators as \"buying out\" the opposition (which she also allegedly attempted with other anti-war challengers Hong Tran and Aaron Dixon).[193] The article noted that, despite the differences in exact circumstances, the Lieberman defeat also showed that voters were in an anti-incumbent mood, which could've created problems for Cantwell.[194] This was supported by another P-I article that also noted that the primary loss of Lieberman and two House incumbents, Michigan Republican Joe Schwarz and Georgia Democrat Cynthia McKinney, on the same day indicated that there may have been a nationwide anti-incumbent trend.[195]\n\nFollowing the primary results, Cantwell endorsed Ned Lamont and McGavick responded by endorsing Senator Lieberman.[196] The Dixon campaign released a statement criticizing Cantwell's \"spin and vague rhetoric\" on the war, and equating her current position to a pro-war stance similar to Lieberman's.[197]\n\nOn August 14, less than a week after Lamont's win and nearly four years after the actual event, Cantwell for the first time said she would have voted against the authorization to use force in Iraq if she knew then what she knew in 2006.[198] However, she did so only after hearing her opponent McGavick say that he would have voted against the authorization under those conditions.[199] Cantwell has stated that she had no regrets for her vote in favor of the authorization.[200]\n\nOn July 9, anti-war challenger Mark Wilson announced he would abandon his bid, endorse Cantwell, and take a paid position offered by Cantwell's campaign, one day after progressive activist and anti-war critic Dal LaMagna had been hired to be the Cantwell campaign's co-chair. Initially, Cantwell's campaign refused to state how much they were paying Wilson, but under pressu"
