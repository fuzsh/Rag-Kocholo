        "text": "Elections for the United States Senate will be held on November 7, 2006, with 33 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate being contested. Since Senators are elected for six-year terms, those elected will serve from January 3, 2007 until January 3, 2013. Those Senators who were elected in 2000 will be seeking reelection or retiring in 2006. The Seante Elections will be conducted using the first past the post voting system.\n\nThe House of Representatives election is scheduled for the same date as the Senate election, as well as many state and local elections, including those for 36 state governors.\n\nMajor Parties[]\n\nOf the seats being contested, 17 are held by Democrats, 15 are held by Republicans, and 1 by an independent who votes with the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe Senate is currently composed of 55 Republicans, who have been in the majority since 2003, 44 Democrats, and 1 independent. (The independent, former Republican Jim Jeffords of Vermont, began voting with the Democratic caucus in 2001, but will not seek re-election.)\n\nTo gain a majority in the Senate, Democrats will need 51 seats, holding their 17 seats at risk and acquiring a gain of 6 or 7 seats depending on whether the open Vermont seat is won by a Republican. With only 50 seats, the Democrats would remain in the minority as Vice President Dick Cheney as President of the Senate, breaks all tie votes.\n\nTo gain a \"working majority\" of 60 members, the number of votes required to break a filibuster, Republicans will need to gain five seats and hold their 15 seats at risk.\n\nLegend: D = Democratic, R = Republican, I = Independent, G = Green, C = Constitution, DFL = Democratic-Farmer-Labor\n\nSenate contests in 2006[]"
