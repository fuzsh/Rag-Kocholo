        "text": "THE TOP\n\nHarris chooses fellow ideological traveler to take on Trump and Vance\n\nHappy Wednesday morning.\n\nBig Capitol Hill news: Speaker Mike Johnson has installed several veteran Republican oversight operators atop the House task force investigating the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nFrederick Hill will be the staff director. Hill is a veteran of the House Oversight Committee and was a key aide in Rep. Darrell Issa’s (R-Calif.) chairmanship of the panel in the early days of the Obama administration.\n\nLauren Holmes will be deputy staff director. Holmes is also an Oversight alum who is now the general counsel of the House Small Business Committee. Like many in House GOP legal circles, she graduated from George Mason University’s law school.\n\nBill Burck will be one of two special counsels. Burck is about as high profile as they come in Republican leader circles. A lawyer with a pair of degrees from Yale, Burck is the global managing partner of Quinn Emanuel. He has represented Don McGahn, Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and former Special Counsel Robert Hur.\n\nThe task force’s other special counsel is Jon Skladany. Skladany, also a George Mason law graduate, was staff director to the House Oversight Committee. He’s currently special counsel at Jenner and Block. Skladany has run previous investigations into the Secret Service.\n\nHill and Holmes traveled to Butler, Pa., last week to visit the site of the attempted assassination. The pair also met with Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), the task force chair.\n\nA few quick observations: That Johnson made these appointments shows his team’s intricate involvement in this panel. And that Republicans have tapped seasoned figures shows the influence the GOP will exert on this committee.\n\nWalzing into 2024 race: In tapping Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen a fellow ideological traveler, a politician who has shifted his views on a host of topics to fit the Democratic Party of the moment.\n\nThe 60-year-old Walz has been in public office for 17 years, spending much of his congressional tenure safely in the ideological middle of the House Democratic Caucus. In Congress, Walz occasionally sided with Republicans on gun laws, earning an A mark from the NRA while also working with the GOP to craft agriculture policy critical to his southern Minnesota district.\n\nProgressives, however, say he’s one of theirs: a champion of free college tuition, free school lunches and transgender rights. To the left — including the Democratic Socialists of America — Walz is a welcome departure from the corporate Democrats that the base has come to loathe.\n\nBut to his detractors, Walz is a progressive ideologue who let BLM protestors burn Minneapolis to the ground, issued driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants and aligned with progressives on transgender policy.\n\nMuch like Harris, the once crusading anti-crime district attorney, Walz can be everything to everybody at the same time. Walz’s stances give fodder to his conservative detractors and hope to his liberal supporters, yet he doesn’t fit neatly into either political camp.\n\nThis, in many ways, is a blessing and a curse for the Harris-Walz ticket. Republicans have sharply criticized Harris for shifting her view on a number of issues, including fracking and single-payer health care. Walz will likewise get hit by the Trump campaign on his leftward turn, especially as Minnesota governor.\n\nFor example, in 2006, Walz campaigned on sending undocumented immigrants back to their home country to reapply for citizenship. As governor, he signed a bill last year allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses.\n\nBut the working hypothesis about the race is that none of this truly matters. Former President Donald Trump has been on every side of nearly every contemporary political issue under the sun. Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) bashed Trump before becoming a Trumpian. So let’s not go overboard about shifting on critical issues of the day.\n\nThe political calculation behind choosing Walz isn’t terribly complex to comprehend. Team Harris thinks that they can put Pennsylvania in play with or without Gov. Josh Shapiro on the ticket. At Tuesday evening’s rally in Philadelphia, Shapiro proved himself to be a more-than-able orator willing to boost the Harris-Walz ticket from the outside.\n\nHarris’ vibes with Walz aside, the thinking is that the Minnesota governor can help Harris win critical Midwest states and serve as a very-affable contrast to the more cerebral Vance.\n\nAnd how about Shapiro? There are those in the Democratic Party who say that Harris committed political malpractice by not putting Shapiro on the ticket. And, of course, if Harris loses Pennsylvania, it will have been. But we heard from several House Democrats who were truly worried about the union vote if Shapiro made it onto the ticket. Harris needed to put any down-ballot drama behind her.\n\nLet’s note one other fascinating dynamic at play in this race. Three of the four top candidates — Harris, Walz and Vance — came from humble beginnings. Vance maybe even more than the two Democrats, although Harris and Walz went to far more modest colleges than Vance.\n\nYet Trump — beloved by the middle class and the non-college educated — is the son of a mega-rich New York developer and landlord. Trump also does nothing but play up his own billionaire status.\n\n— Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan\n\nPunchbowl News is excited to announce our Congressional Recess Giveaway.

Winners will be announced in September.\n\nTHE SENATE MAP\n\nRosen’s old-school Senate campaign\n\nLAS VEGAS — Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) is doing something that her fellow vulnerable Democratic senators are strategically avoiding.\n\nShe’s running a traditional, old-school Democratic campaign.\n\nRosen is seeking a second term by not only touting her bipartisan credentials in securing infrastructure investments but also using the presidential race and national issues like abortion as a way to boost Democratic turnout — a combination that Senate Democrats in other battleground states are shunning.\n\n“A lot of this election is about a choice — not just for freedom … but the choice of what we invest in,” Rosen said in an interview here after campaigning with the left-leaning veterans group VoteVets Tuesday.\n\nIn Nevada, this strategy could work in Rosen’s favor as she faces off against Republican nominee Sam Brown. To win statewide, Democrats need to juice turnout in the metropolitan hubs of Las Vegas and Reno, especially among hospitality workers and unions. Democrats have a major advantage on that front because of the political machine set into motion by the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nThis will be crucial for Rosen in what her campaign expects will be an extremely tight race. Two years ago, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) defeated Republican Adam Laxalt by fewer than 8,000 votes.\n\nSchumer’s view: Rosen’s emphasis on what Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer refers to as “implementation” of landmark bills from the last Congress is a way for her to localize the race. It could also help insulate Rosen from criticisms about Nevada’s economy, which has been generally worse than the rest of the country post-Covid.\n\n“We have broadband going in places in rural Nevada, in places all across Nevada, that we’ve never had before because of the bipartisan infrastructure law,” Rosen said. “And high-speed rail that’s going to connect Los Angeles to Las Vegas is going to bring billions of dollars in economic impact… Sam Brown would have voted against that.”\n\nIn many of the battleground states, including Nevada, the Senate GOP challenger is running behind former President Donald Trump. Democrats credit this to their efforts to remind voters about what incumbents brought home for their state.\n\nYet this week, Brown told us the federal spending Rosen supported “directly resulted in higher prices for everyday things.”\n\nBrown also criticized the high-speed rail project as a “giveaway” to a “New York hedge fund billionaire peddling a train boondoggle with ticket prices so high that working-class families won’t be able to afford to use it.”\n\n“[Rosen] may call this reckless spending an ‘investment,’ but everyday Nevadans know it’s just another corporate giveaway to a political donor,” Brown said.\n\nA different kind of battleground: In one respect, Rosen is running her race a lot like Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) — focusing on the local impact of Congress’ big-ticket legislation and insisting they have their own brand distinct from that of the national Democratic Party.\n\nBut unlike Montana and Ohio, where Trump will win handily, Nevada is actually a tight contest at the presidential level. And unlike Tester and Brown, Rosen is eager to talk about and campaign for the top of the Democratic ticket — and link it directly to the issue of which party controls the Senate.\n\nRosen did exactly that when talking about abortion, an issue Democrats believe will benefit their candidates up and down the ballot. And abortion will quite literally be on the ballot in Nevada — voters will choose whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. In this case, Rosen is nationalizing the issue.\n\n“The only way to protect women from dying in emergency room parking lots or back-alley abortions is to protect our Senate Democratic majority,” Rosen said. “And that’s what we’re going to do in Nevada when I get reelected.”\n\n— Andrew Desiderio\n\nTHE CAMPAIGN\n\nBush loses in another blow to Squad\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) won’t be returning to Congress next year after she lost her 1st District Democratic primary to Wesley Bell.\n\nBell won handily, topping Bush 51.2%-45.6%.\n\nBush, one of the most progressive members in the House, joins Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) as the second Squad member to fall to a primary challenger this year. It’s a major blow to the group of progressives who swept into power in recent years vowing to shake up the Democratic Party.\n\nBell ran as a progressive prosecutor — he serves as the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney — who would fight for constituents and avoid the drama that surrounded Bush’s time in office.\n\nMost notably, Bush is under FBI investigation for allegedly misusing campaign funds. Bush has denied any wrongdoing surrounding the employment of her husband for security purposes.\n\nPlus, Bush’s stringent anti-Israel views attracted the attention of AIPAC’s super PAC. United Democracy Project made Bush’s race a top priority and spent more than $9 million to defeat the incumbent.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership endorsed Bush and House Minority Whip Katherine Clark even stumped for Bush in the race’s closing days. But it wasn’t enough to stave off Bush’s defeat.\n\nWashington: In Washington’s 4th District, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) appears to be in a tough spot. Newhouse looks poised to advance to the general election along with fellow Republican Jerrod Sessler, who’s backed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut with more than half the votes counted, Sessler is running ahead of Newhouse. And another Trump-endorsed Republican, Tiffany Smiley, also notched roughly 20% of the vote and is in third.\n\nSo with a significant number of Republicans voting against Newhouse in the primary, the general election may be an uphill battle. Remember: Newhouse voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nMichigan: As expected, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) will face off against former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) in the state’s blockbuster Senate race. Both Slotkin and Rogers easily dispatched primary opponents.\n\nIn the state’s 8th District, Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet appears poised to take on unsuccessful 2022 Republican candidate Paul Junge in the election to fill retiring Rep. Dan Kildee’s (D-Mich.) seat.\n\nIn the 7th District race to fill Slotkin’s seat, Democrat Curtis Hertel will face Republican Tom Barrett. Both the 7th and 8th districts are key toss-up campaigns in the battle for the House.\n\n— Max Cohen"
