Some call this system a jungle primary because all candidates for an office run together in one election and the majority vote wins. If there is no majority vote winner in the primary election then the top two candidates go to a run-off election called a general election. This type of system is used in Louisiana for all offices state, parish, municipal and congressional, but it is not used for the presidential preference primary.\n\nPresidential Elections\n\nPresidential elections are held every four years on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November to choose the electors for president and vice president of the United States, one to be chosen from each of the six congressional districts and two at large for the state total of eight electorial votes.
