Perry regarding the 2011 legislatively enacted congressional plan &lpar;PLANC185&rpar;&period; After extensive hearings and expert testimony&comma; the court found evidence of intentional dilution of minority voting opportunity as well as racial gerrymandering in the Dallas&hyphen;Fort Worth area, and in South Texas/Bexar County&period; The court rejected numerous other claims by the various plaintiffs&comma; including claims that districts in the Houston area were drawn with discriminatory purpose&comma; were racially gerrymandered&comma; or violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for failing to draw additional minority coalition districts&period;\n\nPerez v. Perry Litigation Continues &hyphen; 2013 Congressional Plan\n\nIn July 2017&comma; the San Antonio district court conducted a trial regarding the pending claims challenging the 2013 congressional plan (PLANC235) adopted as an interim plan by the court in 2012 and enacted by the Legislature in June 2013. These included claims that congressional District 23 as remedied in the 2013 plan was still not an effective Hispanic district, that District 27 resulted in dilution of the Hispanic vote in Nueces County, that new District 35 in Central Texas was a racial gerrymander that intentionally eliminated a minority influence or crossover district in the Travis County area, and that additional minority coalition districts should have been created in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Harris County regions&period;\n\nOn August 15, 2017, the district court issued an extensive ruling on the legal challenges to PLANC235. The court determined that there was insufficient evidence of minority coalition voting or discriminatory intent in the Dallas and Harris County challenges to support additional findings of vote dilution in that area, and that the changes made to District 23 in the 2013 plan were sufficient to remedy the vote dilution violations found in the initial 2011 legislative plan. However, the court determined that the plan was enacted with discriminatory intent because it retained certain discriminatory districts present in the legislature's 2011 plan. Specifically, the court determined District 25 in Central Texas and District 27 in the Nueces County region were enacted with discriminatory purpose in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe district court ordered the state to remedy the violations before the 2018 elections, but the ruling was stayed pending appeal to the U&period;S&period; Supreme Court.\n\nAbbott v. Perez &hyphen; Ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nThe State of Texas appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court the ruling of the San Antonio district court that the 2013 legislative plan for Congress (PLANC235) violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it was the product of intentional vote dilution of minority voters and, in some area, of racial gerrymandering&period; In June 2018&comma; the Supreme Court by a vote of 5&hyphen;4 upheld PLANC235&period; (585 U.S.___(2018)). PLANC235 was identical to the interim plan that the San Antonio district court had drawn to address various asserted voting rights violations in the legislature's original 2011 congressional plan (PLANC185) that the district court considered to be \"not insubstantial\" pending a full trial on the merits of that plan. The majority opinion held that, when the legislature enacted the 2012 court-ordered interim plan as the state's permanent congressional plan in 2013, it presumably acted in good faith, so that the burden was on the plaintiffs to prove that the 2013 enactment was itself the product of intentional discrimination. The district court had, according to the Supreme Court, improperly attributed elements of intentional discrimination in the 2011 plan to the legislature's 2013 reenactment of the district court's interim plan. The Supreme Court also determined that the plaintiffs had not shown that an additional Hispanic opportunity district could have been created in the Nueces County or South Texas region. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the district court in its entirety, effectively upholding the 2013 legislative plan.\n\nAbbott v. Perez &hyphen; Final Proceedings in U.S. District Court\n\nOn remand of the case to the federal district court in San Antonio, the district court heard arguments from the plaintiffs that the district court's findings of intentional vote dilution in the legislature's 2011 state house and congressional plans, together with other recent judicial findings of racial discrimination by the state and local jurisdictions, warranted the court to require the state to seek federal preclearance of any redistricting plans enacted after the 2020 census is released pursuant to Section 3(c). On September 24, 2019, the three-judge redistricting panel in Perez v. Abbott was dissolved, effectively ending the substantive litigation. The dissolution order left the outstanding issue of attorney fees sought by various plaintiffs to be determined by U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia, with whom the case was orginally filed.\n\nState Board of Education Redistricting\n\nThe 82nd Legislature&comma; Regular Session&comma; passed the State Board of Education redistricting bill&comma; H&period;B&period; 600 &lpar;PLANE120&rpar;&comma; on May 5&comma; 2011&period; On September 22&comma; 2011&comma; the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted its approval for the plan under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act&period;"
