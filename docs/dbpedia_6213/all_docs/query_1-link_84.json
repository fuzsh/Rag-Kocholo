In Nebraska’s regular Senate election, Democrats are expected to support an independent, as nobody from the party filed to run.\n\nThe interactive map provides a series of purple shades to use in these three elections, in addition to the regular blue and red colors.\n\nIn terms of majority control, independent ‘winners’ on the interactive map are counted as part of the Democratic total, as this best reflects the real-world situation.\n\nAs with any other 2024 state, you can use the Map Color Palette or rotate through the colors by clicking on the map.\n\nIndependent Senators Kyrsten Sinema (Arizona) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia) are not running for reelection in 2024."
