        "text": "Precinct Sorted Data\n\nThese files contain the results of an election after all accepted provisional and absentee ballots have been sorted into their respective precincts. See layout file (TXT) for full list of variables included in these files.\n\nWhy/when does the Precinct Sort take place? Per Voting data maintained by precinct. N.C.G.S § 163-132.5G, county boards are required to provide vote tabulation data by precinct. The precinct sort is a post-election re-tabulation whereby precinct returns for each item on the ballot shall include the votes cast by all residents of that voting precinct who voted, regardless of where the voter voted. The precinct sort is to be completed within 30 days (previously 60) after the election.\n\nWhy do the vote counts in the Precinct Sorted Data files differ slightly from those in the Election Results files? To protect the secrecy of voters’ ballots, statistical noise has been added to the precinct sorted results files. The process of adding statistical noise is a common practice among statisticians, demographers, and other organizations working with datasets containing sensitive and/or confidential information. The addition of statistical noise to the precinct sorted data ensures that, when joined to other datasets, the precinct sorted data cannot reveal the ballot choices of any voter. Due to the addition of statistical noise, the vote counts in the precinct data will differ slightly from those in the Election Results. As such, the precinct sorted data should not be considered a source for reporting official election results."
