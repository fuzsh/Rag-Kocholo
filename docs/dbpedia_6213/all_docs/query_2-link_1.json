        "text": "The 2006 Texas gubernatorial election was held on November 7, 2006, to elect the governor of Texas. The election was a rare five-way race, with incumbent Republican Governor Rick Perry running for re-election against Democrat Chris Bell and Independents Carole Keeton Strayhorn and Kinky Friedman, as well as Libertarian nominee James Werner.\n\nPerry was re-elected to a second full term in office, winning 39% of the vote to Bell's 30%, Strayhorn's 18%, and Friedman's 12%. Perry carried 209 out of the state's 254 counties, while Bell carried 39 and Strayhorn carried 6. Exit polls revealed that Perry won the white vote with 46%, while Bell got 22%, Strayhorn got 16% and Friedman got 15%. Bell won 63% of African Americans, while Perry got 16%, Strayhorn got 15% and Friedman got 4%. Bell also won the Latino vote with 41%, while Perry got 31%, Strayhorn got 18% and Friedman got 4%.\n\nPerry was inaugurated for a second full four-year term on January 16, 2007. The ceremony was held inside the House of Representatives chamber at the Texas Capitol after thunderstorms canceled the planned outdoor ceremony. This remains the last time Republicans won a statewide race in Texas with only a plurality. Despite only winning 29% of the vote, this is the closest the Democrats have come to winning a Texas gubernatorial election in the 21st century.\n\nAs of 2023, this is the most recent gubernatorial election where Swisher, Crosby, Fisher, Haskell, Red River, Morris, Marion, Bastrop, Newton, Jefferson, Bee, and Calhoun counties voted for the Democratic candidate, and the most recent where Cameron County voted for the Republican candidate, as well as the most recent where Cooke, Nolan, Wilson, Goliad, and Wharton counties did not vote for the Republican candidate.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nIncumbent Rick Perry became governor in late 2000 when then-Governor George W. Bush resigned following his election as President of the United States. He had been elected lieutenant governor in 1998. Perry was subsequently elected governor in his own right in 2002 and successfully ran for a second full term in 2006.\n\nPerry's overall poll ratings had plummeted since the 2002 election, plagued by budget woes, battles over school financing reform, and a contentious and controversial redistricting battle. His approval rating dropped to 38% during the latter part of the 2005 legislative session.\n\nQualifications\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is difficult for an independent gubernatorial candidate to gain ballot access in the state of Texas. The election law, summarized briefly, requires the following:\n\nThe candidate must obtain signatures from registered voters, in an amount equalling at least one percent of the total votes cast in the prior gubernatorial election. For the 2006 ballot, this required 45,540 signatures. (This is also the number of signatures required for a third party to gain ballot access, which only the Libertarian Party did in 2006.)\n\nThe signatures must come from registered voters who did not vote in either the Democratic or Republican primaries or in any runoff elections for governor.\n\nThe signatures must come from registered voters who have not signed a petition for any other independent candidate. In other words, a Strayhorn supporter cannot also sign Friedman's petition, nor vice versa. If a supporter signed more than one petition, only the first signature counts.\n\nThe signatures must be obtained within 60 days following the primary election; the window is shortened to 30 days if a runoff election for either party's gubernatorial candidate is required. In 2006, neither party had a runoff election for governor; therefore, the candidates had the full 60 days â€“ until May 11, 2006.\n\nIn the event a candidate does not qualify for independent status, they may still run as a write-in candidate. The candidate must pay a $3,750 filing fee and submit 5,000 qualified signatures. However, the filing cannot take place any earlier than July 30, nor later than 5:00 PM on August 29.\n\nRepublican primary\n\n[edit]\n\nStar Locke\n\nLarry Kilgore, advocate for Texas secession\n\nRick Perry, incumbent Governor since 2000\n\nRhett Smith\n\nWithdrew\n\n[edit]\n\nCarole Keeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller and former Railroad Commissioner and mayor of Austin (withdrew December 2005, ran as independent)\n\nDeclined\n\n[edit]\n\nKay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator since 1993 (ran for re-election)\n\nCampaign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe race was initially expected to be a contentious three-way primary between Perry, Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Keeton Strayhorn, and U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. Hutchison declined to run for governor in late 2005, instead opting to run for re-election to the Senate. This left Strayhorn and Perry vying for the GOP nomination. Believing her chances to be better running as an independent and appealing directly to voters, rather than those of the Republican Party first, she announced her intent to challenge him in the general election instead. Had she run in the primary, the December 2005 Scripps Howard Texas Poll of match ups had Perry in the lead against Strayhorn by a 55%-24% margin.\n\nDespite weak polling numbers, Perry had the support of the Texas Republican Party. According to Perry's campaign website, he gained 142 separate endorsements. Perry had endorsements from virtually the entire Texas Republican congressional delegation (all but two members),[citation needed] every Republican statewide officeholder (except Strayhorn and judicial officeholders, who by law cannot endorse political candidates), 51 of the 62 members of the Texas Republican Party executive committee, and nearly every major Texas pro-business, fiscal conservative, and social conservative organization and PAC. Perry even managed to gain the endorsement of the Teamsters Union,[citation needed] notwithstanding Texas's strong right to work laws.\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nRepublican primary results[1] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 655,919 100.00\n\nDemocratic primary\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Bell, former U.S. Representative from Houston and member of the Houston City Council\n\nBob Gammage, former justice of the Texas Supreme Court and U.S. Representative from Houston\n\nRashad Jafer\n\nChris Bell, a former Congressman from Houston, had been defeated in his party's 2004 primary after the controversial mid-decade redistricting in the state.[citation needed] Bell announced his run in July 2005.[citation needed]\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nDemocratic primary results[2][3] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 508,602 100.00\n\nGeneral election\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Bell, former U.S. Representative from Houston and member of the Houston City Council (Democratic)\n\nJames \"Patriot\" Dillon (Independent) (write-in)[4]\n\nKinky Friedman, country singer and mystery author (Independent)\n\nRick Perry, incumbent Governor since 2001 (Republican)\n\nCarole Keeton Strayhorn, Texas Comptroller and former Railroad Commissioner and mayor of Austin (Independent)\n\nJames Werner, sales consultant and candidate for U.S. House in 2004[5] (Libertarian)\n\nKinky Friedman, an independent candidate, claimed that country-music lovers, college students, animal lovers, ranchers, and anyone who didn't vote in the last election were among his supporters.[citation needed]\n\nCampaign\n\n[edit]\n\nBell's official strategy was to get Democrats to unite behind and vote for a Democrat, predicting (and betting on) a splintering of the Republican vote among Perry, Strayhorn, and Friedman, giving the Democrats the needed plurality to win the election.[6] Running on a platform of ethics reform and education issues, he stayed with the pack of three candidates with better name recognition. After a good debate performance, his poll numbers improved significantly to where he had taken second place in nearly every poll afterward.\n\nFriedman briefly enjoyed a high standing in the polls, and surpassed Democrat Chris Bell for second place by Independence Day.[citation needed] As Election Day drew near, the Friedman campaign fizzled out as much of his wide support was among young voters. He finished fourth in the election with under 13% of the vote. His website claimed that \"he doesn't put much stock in unscientific political polls among \"likely\" voters, saying, \"It's Kinky Friedman versus apathy\". Friedman stated during the campaign that he was going after the 71% who didn't make it to the polls in 2002.[citation needed]\n\nPerry's position in polling improved during the campaign, with a 44% approval rating and 51% disapproving as of September 2006.[7]\n\nDebates\n\n[edit]\n\n2006 Texas Governor Debates No. Date Host Link Participants Key:\n\nP Participant A Absent N Non-invitee W Withdrawn Rick Perry Chris Bell Carole Keeton Strayhorn Kinky Friedman James Werner 1 October 6, 2006 KERA-TV [1] P P P P N\n\nPredictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSource Ranking As of The Cook Political Report[8] Likely R November 6, 2006 Sabato's Crystal Ball[9] Safe R November 6, 2006 Rothenberg Political Report[10] Likely R November 2, 2006 Real Clear Politics[11] Likely R November 6, 2006\n\nEndorsements\n\n[edit]\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nGraphical summary\n\nSource Date MoE Bell (D) Friedman (I) Perry (R) Strayhorn (I) Werner (L) WSJ/Zogby October 31, 2006 Â±2.9% 28.5% 14.4% 36.7% 15% 2.1% Houston Chronicle/KHOU October 29, 2006 Â±3.2% 22% 10.5% 38% 21% 1% Rasmussen October 27, 2006 Â±4.5% 25% 12% 36% 22% N/A SurveyUSA October 24, 2006 Â±4.3% 26% 16% 36% 19% 1% WSJ/Zogby October 19, 2006 Â±3% 26.2% 13.2% 37.5% 13% 3.9% Dallas Morning News October 5, 2006 Â±3.5% 15% 14% 38% 18% N/A WSJ/Zogby September 25, 2006 Â±2.6% 22.3% 18.9% 33% 15.5% 1.5% Survey USA September 19, 2006 Â±4.3% 23% 23% 35% 15% 2% Rasmussen September 13, 2006 Â±4.5% 18% 16% 33% 22% N/A WSJ/Zogby September 5, 2006 Â±2.9% 25.3% 22.4% 30.7%* 11.1% 2.6% WSJ/Zogby August 28, 2006 N/A 23.1% 22.7% 34.8% 9.6% N/A Rasmussen August 9, 2006 Â±4.5% 18% 18% 35% 18% N/A Rasmussen July 24, 2006 Â±4.5% 13% 19% 40% 20% N/A WSJ/Zogby July 24, 2006 N/A 20.8% 20.7% 38.3% 11% N/A Survey USA June 26, 2006 Â±4.2% 20% 21% 35% 19% N/A WSJ/Zogby June 21, 2006 N/A 19.7% 17.5% 37.7% 14.1% N/A Rasmussen June 12, 2006 Â±4.5% 14% 20% 38% 19% N/A Survey USA May 22, 2006 Â±4.1% 18% 16% 41% 20% N/A Survey USA April 26, 2006 Â±4.2% 15% 16% 39% 25% N/A Rasmussen April 20, 2006 Â±3% 17% 15% 40% 19% N/A WSJ/Zogby March 30, 2006 N/A 20.7% 16.6% 36.3% 19% N/A Dallas Morning News February 18, 2006 Â±3% 19% 10% 36% 16% N/A Rasmussen February 14, 2006 Â±4.5% 13% 9% 40% 31% N/A Rasmussen January 5, 2006 Â±4.5% 14% 12% 40% 21% N/A\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nTexas election laws do not require a run-off in the event that a majority is not achieved, and so Governor Perry joined only two other Texas governors to achieve the office by a plurality of less than 40%. The Texas Governor Elections of 1853 and 1861 both won with less than 40% of the vote.[citation needed]\n\nStrayhorn was seen as a moderate alternative to Perry, and found support among moderate Republicans and independent voters. Although a few polls had her tied for second going into Election day, she finished with 18.13%.[5]\n\n2006 Texas gubernatorial election[13] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 406,450 9.24 Turnout 4,399,068 âˆ’3.40 Republican hold\n\nCounties that flipped from Democratic to Republican\n\n[edit]\n\nCass (Largest city: Atlanta)\n\nHudspeth (Largest city: Fort Hancock)\n\nPecos (Largest city: Fort Stockton)\n\nTerrell (Largest city: Sanderson)\n\nCameron (Largest city: Brownsville)\n\nKenedy (largest municipality: Sarita)\n\nCulberson (largest municipality: Van Horn)\n\nKleberg (largest municipality: Kingsville)\n\nCounties that flipped from Republican to Independent\n\n[edit]\n\nFalls (Largest city: Marlin)\n\nNolan (Largest city: Sweetwater)\n\nCoke (Largest city: Robert Lee)\n\nGoliad (Largest city: Goliad)\n\nWilson (Largest city: Floresville)\n\nWharton (Largest city: El Campo)\n\nCounties that flipped from Republican to Democratic\n\n[edit]\n\nCalhoun (Largest city: Port Lavaca)\n\nBastrop (Largest city: Elgin)\n\nStonewall (Largest city: Aspermont)\n\nSwisher (Largest city: Tulia)\n\nCrosby (Largest city: Crosbyton)\n\nRed River (Largest city: Clarksville)\n\nHaskell (Largest city: Haskell)\n\nDallas (Largest city: Dallas)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n2006 United States gubernatorial elections\n\nInterview with Richard \"Kinky\" Friedman, January 14, 2011.
