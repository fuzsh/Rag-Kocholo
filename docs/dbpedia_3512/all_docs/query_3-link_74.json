        "text": "Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nBy STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nome might call the ignorance of most Americans about political events north of the border a scandal. The general image of Canada here is a sedate neighbor that, except for its French-speaking population, is just like us. The joke behind the song \"Blame Canada!\" from the movie \"South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut\" is that there is nothing for which we can blame this polite serious country, the country that produced folk-rock artists like Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen. Now the Film Society of Lincoln Center has borrowed the song's title to label a 3-week, 31-film Canadian series, which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater.\n\nOne of best and most revealing films in the series is a new documentary, \"Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the 70's Generation,\" to be shown on April 23 and 26. A study of the legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the country's prime minister from the late 1960's to the mid-80's, the film credits him as Canada's great unifier who fostered a sweeping agenda that kept the country from splitting apart. In order to forestall the secession of Quebec, this charismatic prime minister strenuously promoted bilingual education and continued confederation.\n\nThe film, directed by Catherine Annau, examines the generation, now mostly in its 30's, that grew up in Mr. Trudeau's thrall. As you watch these bilingual talking heads reminisce about what it was like to grow up in Canada during the 70's and experience things like \"language immersion,\" their collected voices give the impression of a complicated extended family from a mixed cultural marriage. Without beating the drums too heavily, the history they piece together is a political success story with Mr. Trudeau the (not unblemished) hero.\n\n\"Just Watch Me,\" like almost everything else in the series, is evidence that Canada's bland cultural image is undeserved. Cinematically speaking, this is the country, after all, that has given us David Cronenberg's darkly sensual gallows humor; Atom Egoyan's aching metaphysical dramas in which people examine themselves in halls of media mirrors; and Guy Maddin's surreal frolics in delirious mythical landscapes of his own invention. Each of these directors is represented in the series by one film.\n\nThe opening weekend offerings include Allan Moyle's \"New Waterford Girl,\" a high-energy teenage drama set on Cape Breton Isle; John Paizs's \"Top of the Food Chain,\" a whimsical 50's-style science-fiction spoof; and a newly restored print of Claude Jutra's powerful 1971 drama \"Mon Oncle Antoine,\" set in the dead of winter in a northern Quebec mining town.\n\nBest of all among the recent films being screened this weekend is Gary Burns's dark 1997 comedy \"Kitchen Party,\" a satiric vision of suburban sterility in which a bored teenager breaks his parents' house rules with an unauthorized beer party that skids out of control. This acidic comedy, one of the hits of the 1998 New Directors/New Films series, goes to some of the places visited by movies like \"Happiness\" and \"American Beauty.\""
