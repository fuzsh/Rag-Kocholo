        "text": "Rich girl Pammy (Trini Alvarado, Stella) is the sheltered daughter of a prominent politician. Wild child Nicky (Robin Johnson, D.O.A.) is a tough runaway. Together, the two teens escape from a psychiatric hospital and with the help of radio DJ Johnny LaGuardia (Tim Curry, The Rocky Horror Picture Show), become punk rock heroes on the streets of New York City. But just as their outrageous new life begins to come together, they find that society wants to tear them apart. Can a sisterhood that runs soul deep survive the cold heart of the city?
