        "text": "With a spirit half made of misanthropy and half of punk rock; “Times Square” is a scrawl of an anthem to the most proud of all feminist traditions: rebellion.\n\nA favorite film entry of riot grrrl icons, not the least of which is Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna, “Times Square” captures the enthralling danger that pairs with entry into young teenage years.\n\nThe movie, like its young heroines, is engulfed in some sort of cycle of ending; one of which includes the inglorious peak scum era of its namesake locale. As leads Trini Alvaredo and Robin Johnson experience a self-made becoming by (in)virtue of running away from home to instead be parented by the place only some years before nicknamed ‘Danger…\n\nDear Daddy,\n\nI am not kidnapped.\n\nI am me-napped\n\nI am soul-napped\n\nI am Nicky-napped\n\nI am happy-napped\n\nHere’s a wonderful urban punk fairytale from Allan Moyle, the writer/director of Pump Up the Volume and Empire Records. It’s a sloppy, unfocused early film, but the vibe is a blast and you can totally see it as a template of what he would create a decade later.\n\nDisturbed teens Nicky and Pammy come from opposite backgrounds, but their frustrations are the same, and the two of them team up together with the encouragement of rebel Disc Jockey Tim Curry to bring their music and rebellion to the streets.\n\nWatching the two of them dancing along a New York sidewalk to the…\n\nThis film is wooden, awkward and doesn't make sense at times. Still, it's a perfect slice of teenage confusion, of unlikely friendship and amazing tunes.\n\nThe film opens with one of my favourite Roxy Music tracks, 'Same Old Scene', and it's wrong and perfect for the film all at the same time. It's a film about punk, about New York City as it was in 1980 - gritty, run-down, full of drug-fuelled excess. In a way, I think Roxy Music weren't far off, gritty and excessive in their own way, but still it's odd to have a glossy, synthesizer-driven, falsetto-singing Bryan Ferry and co. in the same scene where thorough-bred Brooklynite Robin Johnson refers to her guitar as her \"axe\".…\n\nThe sweetest NYC 80’s sleazecore movie.\n\nThe story of two girls who find friendship (and themselves) on the mean, skuzzy streets of New Yawk is equally light and dark in tone.\n\nTim Curry just exudes sexy cool as the DJ.\n\nCan’t believe one of the girls is the female lead from THE FRIGHTENERS.\n\nOne of the best final shots in a New York City movie ever, equally joyous and melancholy.\n\nOne of my favorite 80’s punk/new wave soundtracks ever; if you ever get a chance, listen to it walking the NYC streets one day, it’s like a Time Machine.\n\nDirector Alan Moyle (PUMP UP THE VOLUME, EMPIRE RECORDS) has a thing for implementing DJs into storylines it seems.\n\nWould be…\n\n“I really was just playing myself and probably would have died young had I not had a chance to channel my self-destruction into a starring movie role.” - Robin Johnson\n\n“I swear to God I’ve never seen an actress like this. She’s Mick Jagger plus Marilyn Monroe.” - Courtney Love on Robin Johnson\n\nIf I had known this movie existed when either of my daughters were thirteen, I would’ve enthusiastically showed it to them.\n\nIt’s an early 80’s runaway fairy tale that seems gritty and authentically “of the streets” due to incredible location shooting, but actually takes place in a fantasy New York where two houseless girls can roam, free of the threat of sexual assault, freezing winters, and true…\n\nHot air, urine, pushers, pimps, and a festering need to be within the city yet, a longing to bulldoze it down to erect an amusement park to swallow the filth of Times Square beneath it. Oh, welcome to New York City 1980.\n\nI was reading that this film has an almost made-for-Hollywood exposé backstory about Allan Moyle finding some crazy girl’s diary between a used couch cushion. Is that even true, Moyle? Tell me the truth dude. In like total meta-fashion, the movie seemed to be more about selling the killer soundtrack over investing a lot in the storytelling. So it’s a sexy cosmic turn of events that a movie plot no one put too much brain power into became…"
