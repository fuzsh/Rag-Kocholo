        "text": "Other 1990 Coverage So Far\n\n100 (or so) Favorite Images from the Films of 1990\n\nWhat I’ll Remember About the Films of 1990: A Love Letter\n\nTop Ten By Year: 1990 – Poll Results\n\n#9. Spontaneous Combustion (US/Hooper)\n\n#7. A Moment of Romance (Hong Kong/Chan)\n\n#3: Gremlins 2: The New Batch (US/Dante)\n\nYou’re a teenager in the sanctuary of your room. Safe, but alone in self and in soul. A voice comes from the radio. The distortion is alien, but it’s talking to you instead of down to you, and it sounds confused and pissed off and just a little bit crass. You recognize yourself in the things he says, the voice of someone who not only knows that, in the words of Fiona Apple, “the world is bullshit”, but is trying to grapple with it live and in the moment. It’s the voice of someone who doesn’t have the answers but knows the problems, and the pain of being. Even though you can only hear him, it feels like he sees you. He is a life line, and the only catharsis you’ve currently got.\n\nAs we get older, we revisit the put-upon teenage-isms in movies and books with slowly increasing disconnect. It’s only natural. I used to love Ferris Bueller’s Day Off so much that I’d watch it all the time. I thought Ferris and his day of fantasy hijinks were so cool (though I always related to Cameron Frye). But he, and the film, are actually the definition of obnoxious, largely because it buys into Ferris as the second coming of Christ. Don’t trust coming-of-age films that worship their main character. Sincerity is the unpopular approach to the high school film, partly because teenagers hiding behind a wall of wit and sarcasm always has appeal, and partly because coming-of-age narratives tend to be written by self-satisfied adults. Sincerity is a much harder approach, both to pull off and to sell.\n\n“My So-Called Life” pulls off this needle-in-a-haystack sincerity because Angela’s diary-of-absolutes voiceover (“sometimes it seems like we’re all living in some kind of prison, and the crime is how much we hate ourselves”) transport you back to adolescence even as you can feel your remove from it. You remember how it felt to angst-out for the first time, to be trapped in the bubble of high school, and the Chicken Little apocalypse of every experience. We feel the ways we still are, and are not, a teenager — what we took with us and what we left behind. When a lot of onscreen teenagers talk, you can picture a writer back-patting themselves with “damn, that’s good”. With Angela you can’t, because she’s too busy feeling; Claire Danes always delivers her lines as a girl finding her words in the exact moment she says them.\n\nJust like Angela and her voiceover, Mark and his pirate radio are also expressions of existential and unmistakably teenage introspection. Pump Up the Volume is full of lines like “all the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks” or Nora’s “jam me, jack me, push me, pull me” poetry, baby’s first pangs of nihilism and provocation. But we don’t roll our eyes. Instead we not only recognize being that age, but, like “My So-Called Life”, are brought back to it because of the passion and free-form urgency these creative expressions take. Both “My So-Called Life” and Pump Up the Volume have the same sincerity and honesty to their angst, but Pump Up the Volume trades in solitary heartache for collective generational loneliness and unrest.\n\nWe recognize Christian Slater’s familiar “chaos is what killed the dinosaurs, darling” instigator mode. But unlike J.D’s (Heathers) anarchic antagonist (made further untouchable through a satirical wall) or Clarence’s (True Romance) unfortunate Tarantino-ego conduit, in Pump Up the Volume his wised-up persona takes the form of a desperately shy kid who stumbles into the guise of a pirate radio alter ego (it’s the performance of his career by the way). He is just as alone as the kids listening to him. He didn’t start this because he thought he had anything to say or because he thought he could be a voice for anybody. He tells us “you see, I didn’t plan it like this. My dumb dad got me this shortwave radio set so I could talk to my buddies back east. But I couldn’t reach anybody. So I just imagined I was talking to nobody”. Mark doesn’t know how to be so he finds a way to be on the air. As his similarly adrift peers gravitate towards the mysterious Hard Harry, the suburb’s parents and educators see him as an insurgent threat that must be eradicated. Only 30 years old, Pump Up the Volume takes place in a presently unimaginable world where the only possible connective outlet for teenagers takes place within your town and through illegal means.\n\nAllan Moyle’s films are consistently about the connectivity between outsider music, outsider kids, and outsider culture (other films include Times Square and Empire Records). Part of that “this movie is with us” vibe comes from the fuck the system soundtrack to go with a fuck the system film. Moyle’s musical tastes tend towards underground sounds of the moment. The bands featured cover a wide array of punk, hardcore, alternative, and hip-hop (Sonic Youth, Above the Law, Bad Brains, and The Pixies to name a few), music not only spiritually aligned with the film, but in some cases on the precipice of defining their era to a wider audience. In Pump Up the Volume, music can help you discover identity and find like-minded rebellious expression in the absence of self-expression. The film’s first line is “Do you ever get the feeling that everything in America is completely fucked up?”. He then airs Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows” to elaborate and further express that sentiment.\n\nThe compassion so central to Pump Up the Volume evolved over time. Originally, Moyle’s much darker script was about of a kid who goes on the air each night intending to kill himself before getting too caught up in talking about it to get around to it. Even though the story was re-conceived to have broader appeal, the focus on suicide, depression, and alienation remain. And while the film is packed with deeply felt cynicism, too much of it at the wrong moment is shown to lead to tragedy. Instead, Pump Up the Volume is hopeful enough to imagine that change is possible through rallying efforts and the power of the individual voice. But, critically, it’s much more centered on authentically communicating the very real hopelessness and epiphany of hypocrisy carried by a lot of post-Reagan youth. It’s a film about how to cope because “high school is at the bottom, being a teenager sucks, but that’s the point, surviving it is the point”: a “you’re not alone” film without any of the misfire and flat sentimentality. It’s about how to get by through activating yourself, and how to hold onto that pain by transforming it into something tangible or uniting because it’s the only thing that’s real.\n\nPump Up the Volume is to some what “Hard Harry” is to the teenagers populating the film’s suburban Phoenix setting. Though it failed at the box-office, it seems to have had a concretely life-changing impact on a smattering of the Gen-Xers who saw it upon release. Every time I bring it up on social media, at least one person replies back with their memory of seeing the film in theaters and how important and/or life-changing it was to them. Extensive focus is put on watching these kids listen to Mark, because the film is an act of recognition. It recognizes that kids are depressed and suicidal and realizing they are trapped in a system they didn’t choose. There is an emotional momentum to its encouragement to ask yourself what you can do and the ways you can create, speak, and put yourself out there. It sounds lame and didactic but the semi-miracle of this movie is that it’s not. It’s the antidote to John Hughes, and a film that has a much broader, inclusive, and vital application for now."
