        "text": "The 2020 Oxford Film Festival Announces Film Lineup (March 18 – 22)\n\nAllan Moyle’s classic PUMP UP THE VOLUME will have special 30th\n\nAnniversary screening as the Opening Night Gala selection,\n\nand Braden King’s THE EVENING HOUR is the Closing Night choice.\n\nWorld premieres include Brandon Colvin’s A DIM VALLEY, Miles Doleac’s\n\nTHE DINNER PARTY, Jo Duca’s HER NAME WAS JO, Dennis Cahlo’s IN\n\nFLOWERS THROUGH SPACE, Frank Waldeck’s IT’S TIME,\n\nBen and Bo Powell’s NOTHIN NO BETTER,\n\nand Mary Blessey’s YOU ASKED FOR THE FACTS.\n\nOxford, MS (January 15, 2020) – The 2020 Oxford Film Festival (March 18-22) has announced an event filled edition of the acclaimed regional film festival with a special 30th Anniversary screening of Allan Moyle’s rebel youth classic PUMP UP THE VOLUME featured as the Opening Night Gala selection with Moyle himself on hand for the screening as well as Producer Sandy Stern, and Braden King’s searing drama THE EVENING HOUR presented as the fest’s Closing Night Gala following its debut at Sundance. A special screening with a panel discussion including the actors and their real-life counterparts of Frank Waldeck’s IT’S TIME about Ole Miss’ Chucky Mullins, an inventive presentation of the cult classic SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA at a bowling alley, and a special conversation with Mississippi author Angie Thomas (THE HATE YOU GIVE) timed to the introduction of a brand new award created in her honor all add up to a banner year of highlights to accent the film lineup for Oxford film fans in March.\n\nAlways a magnet for film debuts, world premieres at the Oxford Film Festival include Brandon Colvin’s A DIM VALLEY, Miles Doleac’s THE DINNER PARTY, Jo Duca’s HER NAME WAS JO, Dennis Cahlo’s IN FLOWERS THROUGH SPACE, Waldec’s IT’S TIME, Ben and Bo Powell’s NOTHIN NO BETTER, and Mary Blessey’s YOU ASKED FOR THE FACTS. The short film section is rich with premieres as well this year: 28 short films will make their world premieres, eight shorts will make their U.S. premieres, and one will have its international premiere.\n\nOnce again the Oxford Film Festival enjoyed another record year of submissions (increasing from 1595 last year to 2253 this year). The lineup includes 32 feature films (21 narratives, 11 documentaries), 168 short films (146 narratives, 22 documentaries), and eight music videos representing 26 countries. The lineup is highlighted by both a successful application of the 50/50 by 2020 gender filmmaker parity pledge, as well as another expansion fo the film festival’s LGVTQIA+ categories.\n\nOxford Film Festival’s Executive Director, Melanie Addington, said, “We challenged ourselves this year to both achieve goals in line with our staunch support of female filmmakers, LGBTQIA+, and those with disabilities. We have embraced our role as leaders both in this city and the state in that regard knowing that the filmmaking community and the public look to our film lineup and our presentations to match our public positions. However, this year, we also wanted to deliver big signature events to enhance our film lineup so that Oxford film fans and Oxford Film Festival filmmakers can feel they have been part of something truly special at this year’s fest.”\n\nAllan Moyle’s PUMP UP THE VOLUME electrified a generation when it premiered in 1990. Christin Slater and Samantha Mathis became stars and avatars fro young people who watched the film over and over again. In the film, Slater plays a shy student, who secretly runs a pirate radio station and causes an uproar, becoming an underground celebrity and leader of a movement when he speaks his mind and enthralls fellow teens. Mathis plays a classmate who discovers and develops a romance with the boy behind the voice and inspires him to take a real chance with his life. The film screens Thursday, March 19 at 7:00 p.m. at the Gertrude C. Ford Center (351 University Ave.) with Moyle and producer Sandy Stern attending following a live broadcast of Thacker Mountain Radio Show, a locally produced live reading and music performance broadcast in Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nThe Oxford Film Festival is starting to make a tradition of nabbing a couple of hot titles right out of Sundance and this year, Braden King’s THE EVENING HOUR fills that bill. In the tense drama, a popular, young health aide at a nursing home in rural Appalachia, makes ends meet by serving as a middle man in an illicit medication transfer from townies to local buyers. It’s a tough area with few opportunities, and he does what he can to keep his addicted customers out of harm’s way from the town’s menacing kingpin. However, the return of his childhood friend after years away may threaten the fragile balance he has achieved with plans to capitalize on what he sees as his friend’s place in the local drug trade. The film screens Sunday, March 22 at 5:30 p.m. at the Malco Commons (204 Commonwealth Blvd.) with King and actors attending with the film.\n\nSaturday, March 21, Angie Thomas will host a conversation with the panel before revealing the winner of the Angie Thomas Zeitgeist Award. Like the author, whose writing has made such an impact from the state of Mississippi, the award will celebrate a film artist from a diverse background each year who has exhibited a unique and clear voice through their work.\n\nPreviously announced, Waldeck’s IT’S TIME will be presented as part of a special screening and fundraising event at the Gertrude C. Ford Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday, March 18. A dramatic telling of the story of Ole Miss Rebel football player Chucky Mullins, his tragic on-field injury following a collision with Vanderbilt’s Brad Gaines, and its uplifting aftermath. The event will include a post-screening discussion of the film with the actors and some of the people they portray in the film. Included in the post-screening panel discussion will be cast members Pierson Fode, and Amy Goussett, as well as Gaines.\n\nBeloved cult favorite, SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA will be celebrated during a free night of bowling, food, and movie viewing as part of a Bowl-O-Rama Party at Premier Lanes (204 Commonwealth Boulevard). The fun will start at 8:00 p.m. and will include Oxford Film Festival’s publicist John Wildman, who was a cast member in the film.
