Charting the WB's \"Roswell\"'s downward trajectory from a piquant, lovely pilot to the worst of \"The X Files\" and \"Dawson's Creek\" is a fascinating, instructive thing to watch–not only for the schadenfreude of it all, but also for the way that corporate perception of what an audience purportedly wants invariably leads to production of the same kind of dull crapulence over and over again. (Though, in the WB's defense, a grassroots letter-writing campaign that saved the series from oblivion at least once indicates a fervid devotion to this kind of garbage.) In the fine tradition of making a self-pitying clone of \"thirtysomething\" for teen-somethings played by a cast of twenty-somethings, \"Roswell\" is \"Sweet Valley High\" mixed with the Troll Books variety of soft-core science fiction, making that \"My So-Called Life\" feeling of middle school alienation literal in its tale of three or four actual aliens getting teased by jocks in Roswell, NM. It's the love child of Robert A. Heinlein and Judy Blume, and it ain't pretty.\n\nZERO STARS/**** Image A- Sound A Extras C\n\nstarring Mandy Moore, Matthew Goode, Jeremy Piven, Annabella Sciorra\n\nscreenplay by Derek Guiley & David Schneiderman\n\ndirected by Andy Cadiff\n\nby Walter Chaw Giving a whole new meaning to the term \"Grand Old Party,\" now that Jenna and Barbara Bush have made being the first daughter delinquent-delightful again after that stick-in-the-mud scholar/ambassador Chelsea (the \"Family Values\" party has a little 'splainin' to do), gird yourself for no fewer than three films featuring the exploits of the most powerful girl-child in the free world: David Mamet's Spartan, the Katie Holmes starrer First Daughter, and, first out of the block, Andy Cadiff's execrable Chasing Liberty.\n\n***/**** Image C- Sound C+\n\nstarring Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Rubin, Alan Boyce, Pamela Gidley\n\nscreenplay by Jarre Fees and Alice Liddle and Larry Ketron\n\ndirected by Marisa Silver\n\nby Walter Chaw Before Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure trapped Keanu Reeves in an amber of his own inexplicable sun-baked imbecility, he appeared in a couple of genuinely good films, nursing the mistaken impression that he was actually acting. One of these pictures is Tim Hunter's elegy to ennui River's Edge; the other is Marisa Silver's curiously affecting teenage-suicide melodrama Permanent Record. In both, Reeves demonstrates a now-unsurprising affinity for the soulful burnout character, a moral compass in the morass of the amorality of Eighties introspection and hedonism. A neo-hippie destined to become Neo for real, Reeves brought to his early work a kind of befuddled earnestness that informs his best performances (in My Own Private Idaho for instance, or even the first Matrix)–a quality causing genuine concern for \"Hellblazer\" fans, who probably deserve a more complex Constantine. Prior to mega-stardom, however, the most enduring image of Reeves is a scummy sleeping bag tryst in River's Edge, and his awkward take on drunkenness via Ray Bolger during the climax of Permanent Record.\n\n****/**** Image A Sound A- Extras B-\n\nstarring Alex Frost, Eric Deulen, John Robinson, Elias McConnell\n\nwritten and directed by Gus Van Sant\n\nby Walter Chaw I live about five minutes from Columbine High School. In the year following the shootings, Littleton, a strange place already, got even stranger: a man killed himself in a crowded Burger King parking lot, a child was found in a dumpster behind a local strip mall, two kids were killed in a Subway, and so on. It was mass psychic fallout, and something that none of the inquiries into Columbine seem to address; in time, I'm sure, people will forget that there were aftershocks and tremors.\n\nZERO STARS/**** Image C Sound C\n\nstarring Erika Christensen, Mike Vogel, Katherine Heigl, Johnny Whitworth\n\nscreenplay by Max Enscoe & Annie De Young, based ever-so-loosely on the book by Emile Brontë\n\ndirected by Suri B. Krishnamma\n\nby Walter Chaw Consider this time-capsule exchange from the horrifically-misguided mess Suri Krishnamma has made of Wuthering Heights and shudder:\n\n\"I swear to God if you ever leave me I'll kill you.\"\n\n\"Then I'd have to come back and kill you so we could be together.\"\n\n\"If you kill me then I'd haunt you. Forever.\"\n\n\"You promise?\"\n\nHow about I just kill myself while you two sort it out?\n\n*½/**** Image D+ Sound B-\n\nstarring Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy, Patti D'Arbanville, Ben Stiller\n\nscreenplay by Larry Ketron\n\ndirected by David Anspaugh\n\nby Bill Chambers As Tipton, best friend of Matt (Andrew McCarthy), Ben Stiller whispers in Andrew McCarthy's ear, \"Look, when the horse underneath us drops, we take a fresh one.\" Yes, and the wet duck flies at midnight. Fresh Horses is all too effortlessly characterized as Pretty in Pink by way of Cormac McCarthy, or a Walker Evans BOP spread. Hot off of Hoosiers, director David Anspaugh seems to be aiming for something even folksier and more naturalistic this time around, but his three leads–McCarthy, Stiller, and Molly Ringwald–are the least likely actors he could've cast. The effect is a movie from Mars.\n\nby Bill Chambers\n\nOVERRATED\n\nTHIRTEEN\n\n*½/**** Image B+, Sound A, Extras B-\n\nstarring Evan Rachel Wood, Holly Hunter, Nikki Reed, Jeremy Sisto\n\nscreenplay by Catherine Hardwicke & Nikki Reed\n\ndirected by Catherine Hardwicke\n\nI wrote my first script at around the age that 16-year-old Nikki Reed was when she collaborated with her father's ex-girlfriend Catherine Hardwicke on the screenplay for Thirteen. In an attempt to shape a thesis about the almost-unwatchable film made from this memoir of Reed's pubescence, I browsed that script (something I haven't done in over a decade) looking for examples of didacticism; by page three, a character has died from smoking, with cigarettes themselves characterized outside passages of dialogue as \"cancer sticks.\" This was of course written in tandem with my own misadventures in smoking, but do as I say, not as I do. (Call it Harmony Korine Syndrome.) Teenagers make exceptionally bad screenwriters because all teens are Catholic, in a sense–every rebellious action has an equal and opposite guilty reaction. Manifested in confessional writing, that hypocrisy can be deliriously egotistical.\n\n*/****\n\nstarring Scarlett Johansson, Erika Christensen, Chris Evans, Darius Miles\n\nscreenplay by Mark Schwahn and Marc Hyman & Jon Zack\n\ndirected by Brian Robbins\n\nby Walter Chaw A remake in quality and spirit of the \"what were they thinking\" classic Hackers, Brian Robbins's The Perfect Score is one of those stunted adolescent teensploitation flicks that makes one pine for the suddenly-glory days of Fresh Horses and The Breakfast Club–which, as it happens, seems to serve as this flick's carbuncular muse. A band of five disparate high school washouts meet in detention–errr, during a PSAT test–and plot to steal the answers from SAT headquarters. The Jock is played by real-life jock Darius Miles; the basket case is Roy (Leonardo Nam); the princess is Anna (an even more zombie-like than usual Erika Christensen); the brain is Francesca (Scarlett Johansson); and the punk is Kyle (Chris Evans). It takes some doing, it goes without saying, to cause one to reassess the acting acumen of the Brat Pack.\n\nImage B+ Sound B+ Extras B-\n\n\"The Kiss\", \"Crossroads\", \"Alternative Lifestyles\", \"Tamara's Return\", \"Full Moon Rising\", \"The Dance\", \"The All-Nighter\", \"The Reluctant Hero\", \"The Election\", \"High Risk Behavior\", \"Sex, She Wrote,\" \"Uncharted Waters\", \"His Leading Lady\", \"To Be or Not to Be…\", \"…That is the Question\", \"Be Careful What You Wish For\", \"Psychic Friends\", \"A Perfect Wedding\", \"Abby Morgan, Rest in Peace\", \"Reunited\", \"Ch…Ch…Ch…Changes\", \"Parental Discretion Advised\"\n\nby Bill Chambers SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. In striving for an original approach to reviewing the sophomore year of a show for which there are already umpteen online episode guides at one's disposal, I've decided to take inventory of \"Dawson's Creek: The Complete Second Season\"'s seven major players. A series driven by personalities, if far from light on incident, \"Dawson's Creek\", as executive producer Paul Stupin says in his DVD commentary for the season finale (or is it the premiere?), hit pay dirt with its core ensemble, so let's examine how their roles evolved beyond the preliminary 13-episode run–and meet a couple of interlopers while we're at it.\n\n*½/**** Image C+ Sound B\n\nstarring Jason Robards, Corey Feldman, Piper Laurie, Meredith Salenger\n\nscreenplay by Daniel Jay Franklin and Marc Rocco & D.E. Eisenberg\n\ndirected by Marc Rocco\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover How to describe the sublimely awful experience of Dream a Little Dream? Imagine a whacked-out homage combo to John Hughes and Nicolas Roeg–one made without the talent or intelligence of either–and you’ll have an idea of its astoundingly ill-advised combination of temporal step-dancing and teenage romance. You have to admire the guts of director Marc Rocco for going so far out on aesthetic limbs that he’ll inevitably crash to earth–if nothing else, he’s willing to try things, and his plotting and editing rhythms are so unlike anything in the rest of the ’80s teen genre that they border on the avant-garde. Dream a Little Dream isn’t actually good, but it’s certainly never dull, and it will keep bad-film enthusiasts forever wallowing in pig heaven.\n\n**½/**** Image B+ Sound B+ Extras A-\n\nstarring James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson\n\nscreenplay by Kevin Williamson & Maggie Friedman\n\ndirected by James Whitmore, Jr. (\"All Good Things…\") and Greg Prange (\"…Must Come to an End\")\n\nby Bill Chambers SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. When it first aired, I was fuming. But I've not only come to terms with the series finale of \"Dawson's Creek\", I've grown to appreciate it, too. What I realized on a second viewing (not as superfluous as you might think: the DVD that facilitated a reassessment restores 20 minutes of footage cut from the broadcast version) was that my own tenuous identification with the main character, a movie lover and amateur filmmaker prone to befriending unattainable hotties, was getting in the way of appreciating a perfectly laudable reversal of expectations. There's no sense beating around the bush: Joey (Katie Holmes) picked suave Pacey (Joshua Jackson). The first \"Dawson's Creek\" scripted by series creator Kevin Williamson since the second season's \"…That Is the Question\" (in tandem with which he announced he was stepping down as the show's Professor Marvel), the two-part capper–aired as a movie-of-the-week–leaves Dawson (James Van Der Beek) without a fallback girl, as Joey romantically rejects Dawson on the heels of the passing of her alternate: single-mother Jen (Michelle Williams), who dies from a rare heart condition.\n\nDROP DEAD FRED\n\n½*/**** Image C+ Sound B+\n\nstarring Phoebe Cates, Rik Mayall, Marsha Mason, Tim Matheson\n\nscreenplay by Carlos David & Anthony Fingleton\n\ndirected by Ate De Jong\n\nTHE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN\n\n**½/**** Image A- Sound A-\n\nstarring Lawrence Mondson, Diane Franklin, Steve Antin, Joe Rubbo\n\nwritten and directed by Boaz Davidson\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover Not all bad films are created equal. Like everything else, there are “good” examples and bad ones, the distinction resting on how much they’re willing to give. For example, a film like The Last American Virgin, while stopping well shy of being a real movie, nonetheless holds interest with its constant barrage of boorish behaviour and its curious attempts to shoehorn “touching” drama into its gross-out formula. It’s bad, but it tries things, and you admire its valiant attempts to give the people some low satisfaction. A movie like Drop Dead Fred, meanwhile, has been so ruthlessly scrutinized for anything that might resemble creativity that it has nothing to offer, and exhausts its 100-odd minute running time chasing its short stubby tail as we rush to the exits.\n\n***/****\n\nstarring Evan Rachel Wood, Holly Hunter, Nikki Reed, Jeremy Sisto\n\nscreenplay by Catherine Hardwicke & Nikki Reed\n\ndirected by Catherine Hardwicke\n\nby Travis Mackenzie Hoover I'm a bit surprised to have liked Thirteen as much as I did. For one thing, it has no particular point of view–things simply happen in and of themselves and aren't much related to the outside world. For another, the film is somewhat obvious in the way it depicts its various outrages, almost cuing us to register their brutal nature instead of simply letting us draw our own conclusions. But Thirteen's heavy-handed chaos mirrors that of its teenage protagonist, who is in the grip of emotions she doesn't understand and whose responses are as arbitrary as they are destructive. The agony depicted is real, and while the film is no aesthetic miracle, it manages to blast through its limitations with its primary emotion.\n\nVALLEY GIRL\n\n**/**** Image B Sound C- Extras B+\n\nstarring Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman, Elizabeth Daily, Cameron Dye\n\nscreenplay by Andrew Lane and Wayne Crawford\n\ndirected by Martha Coolidge\n\nTHE SURE THING\n\n**½/**** Image A Sound B Extras B\n\nstarring John Cusack, Daphne Zuniga, Viveca Lindfors, Nicollette Sheridan\n\nscreenplay by Steven L. Bloom & Jonathan Roberts\n\ndirected by Rob Reiner\n\nby Bill Chambers SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT. I spent the better part of 1983 in a hospital hooked up to a poetically elaborate I.V., the end result of a pyeloplasty to repair an irritable kidney. Media saturation wasn’t then what it is now, and living sheltered like that made it doubly easy for movies to pass by my radar undetected. But in the strange case of Valley Girl, which I didn’t even know existed until four or five years after its release (once its star, Nicolas Cage, was on the rise), I climbed aboard the bandwagon unbeknownst: The weekday nurses–who seemed old to me then but whom I now realize were probably in their early-twenties at best–returned to work one spring Monday having adopted an entirely new dialect and nicknamed themselves “the Valley girls.” My susceptible young mind took to the language–I still talk like a goddamn Valley girl.\n\nZERO STARS/****\n\nstarring Mandy Moore, Allison Janney, Alexandra Holden, Peter Gallagher\n\nscreenplay by Neena Beber, based on the novels Someone Like You and That Summer by Sarah Dessen\n\ndirected by Clare Kilner\n\nby Walter Chaw Based on a pair of Sarah Dessen novels that apparently deal with the tribulations of a particularly sour adolescent girl, Clare Kilner’s How to Deal is a disastrously twee Judy Blume knock-off that compacts every ill of growing up female into a hysterical parcel of over-reaching and hollow sanctimony. It’s the kind of movie that has its maudlin protagonist reading Madame Bovary to parse, I guess, some portion of romantic martyrdom when the irony of the reference is that at the root of Emma Bovary’s problems arguably lies her infatuation with mealy romance novels into which she might substitute herself for the heroines (not forgetting the role of Dessen’s books in the first place). Irony and incompetence being the two rules of the day as Kilner and her cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards (once Gus Van Sant’s DP, now relegated to stuff like this and Britney Spears’s Crossroads) make unforgivable decisions in lighting and camera placement that cast How to Deal as an unintentional horror film with at least three scenes loaded with tension and free-floating anxiety for no good reason save that the filmmakers don’t seem to know what the hell they’re doing.\n\nEmpire Records: Remix!\n\n*½/**** Image B Sound A- Extras C-\n\nstarring Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia, Renee Zellweger, Maxwell Caulfield\n\nscreenplay by Carol Heikkinen\n\ndirected by Allan Moyle\n\nby Bill Chambers Allan Moyle’s Empire Records has defenders too staunch to disregard–and because I listened to them, I’m left with the sensation that I chewed a piece of bubblegum until well after its flavour ran dry. The Canadian Moyle, whose inauspicious directorial debut was the 1977 tax-shelter crime flick The Rubber Gun, discovered teenagers three years later with his oddity of a second film Times Square and has rarely looked back since. Yet although his cinematic beginnings predate those of John Hughes, Moyle’s Pump Up the Volume and Empire Records are eclipsed by even the lesser entries in Hughes’s teen canon, such as Sixteen Candles and the Hughes-produced Pretty in Pink.\n\nZERO STARS/**** Image A Sound B+ Extras B-\n\nstarring Rob Schneider, Rachel McAdams, Anna Faris, Andrew Keegan\n\nscreenplay by Tom Brady & Rob Schneider\n\ndirected by Tom Brady\n\nby Walter Chaw What to think of a variation on Teen Wolf wherein the victim of the lycanthropic puberty metaphor is a young girl who turns into Rob Schneider? What to make of a film that wrests its central conceit of enchanted jewellery from the long-putrefied grasp of Mannequin 2? And what to make of a film released in the year 2002 that is this misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and cruel to the obese? Rather than postulate that our culture has regressed to the hale cultural morass of the mid-1980s, it’s doubtless more fruitful to examine the ways in which film is becoming as self-reflexive, meta-critical, and free of irony as television.\n\nABANDON\n\n***½/**** Image A Sound A Extras B\n\nstarring Katie Holmes, Benjamin Bratt, Charlie Hunnam, Zooey Deschanel\n\nwritten and directed by Stephen Gaghan\n\nDAWSON’S CREEK: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON\n\nImage C+ Sound B- Extras B-\n\n“Pilot,” “Dance,” “Kiss,” “Discovery,” “Hurricane,” “Baby,” “Detention,” “Boyfriend,” “Road Trip,” “The Scare,” “Double Date,” “Beauty Contest,” “Decisions”\n\nby Bill Chambers Abandon is a damn good movie detested in some quarters because, he hypothesized, it’s not very comforting, because it subverts the entrenched John Landis approach to depicting college life, and because it’s determined to be meaningful within the framework of a supernatural potboiler. The film stars Katie Holmes, whose career has caught its second wind with the near-simultaneous DVD releases of Abandon and the first season of “Dawson’s Creek”, in addition to the title role in 2003’s Sundance favourite Pieces of April and upcoming appearances in Keith Gordon’s The Singing Detective and the Joel Schumacher thriller Phone Booth. She’s also seeing the end of her aforementioned TV series “Dawson’s Creek”, which sails into the sunset this May after five years on the air. It will leave her more time for movies, and with her remarkable taste in film projects (see also: The Gift, Go, and The Ice Storm), I’m anxious to see where that freedom takes her. Especially if it’s anywhere near the territory of her poised work in Abandon.\n\n½*/**** Image A Sound B Extras B-\n\nstarring Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, Shiri Appleby, Kate Burton\n\nscreenplay by Charles Bohl & Phillip Schneider\n\ndirected by John Polson\n\nby Walter Chaw It’s one thing to say that Swimfan is a boldly unoriginal rip-off of such gems as The Crush, Deadly Friend, Wicked, and Poison Ivy, but it’s another, far more disturbing thing altogether to note that Swimfan travels the same inexplicable path of the moon-faced pork-pie Lolita so purposefully trundled by the likes of Alicia Silverstone, Kristy Swanson, Julia Stiles, and Drew Barrymore. Erika Christensen–memorably spacey as the troubled daughter in Soderbergh’s Traffic–reveals herself in Swimfan as just the next completely interchangeable cherubic baby-fat starlet to try (or continue) to sully her ephemeral image in a role day-trippers might mistake for “edgy.” Make no mistake, Swimfan may be many things, but it’s about as edgy as Christensen’s Romanesque elbow."
