        "text": "Empire Records is a 1995 coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed by Allan Moyle and starring Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar, and Maxwell Caulfield. The film takes place over the course of a single day at Empire Records, a small independent record store in Delaware. The film opens with the store's employees arriving for work, including the store manager Joe (LaPaglia), who is trying to keep the store afloat amidst the threat of a corporate buyout. The other employees include the rebellious A.J. (Caulfield), gorgeous and promiscuous Gina (Mazar), nerdy Mark (Ethan Embry), quirky Corey (Liv Tyler), and the loveable stoner Lucas (Rory Cochrane).\n\nAs the day unfolds, each of the characters has their own subplot: A.J. is trying to declare his love to his best friend Corey, Gina is dealing with the consequences of her promiscuity, Mark is trying to win a radio station contest to meet his idol Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield), Corey is considering throwing away her education to follow her dream of becoming a musician, and Lucas is trying to save the store from being bought out by corporate.\n\nThroughout the day, the characters face various challenges and conflicts, ranging from financial struggles to rocky relationships, but ultimately come together to save the store and each other. The film ends with a rooftop concert featuring the employees and Rex Manning.\n\nEmpire Records was praised for its authentic portrayal of teenage life and its eclectic soundtrack, which featured artists such as The Gin Blossoms, Better Than Ezra, and Cranberries. It also touched on themes of friendship, identity, and the power of music.\n\nDespite receiving mixed reviews upon its release, the film has since gained a cult following and is now considered a classic of the 90s teen movie genre. Its colorful cast of characters, witty dialogue, and infectious soundtrack have made it a beloved film among fans, and its timeless messages of self-discovery and friendship continue to resonate with viewers today.\n\nEmpire Records is a 1995 music movie with a runtime of 1 hour and 30 minutes. It has received mostly poor reviews from critics and viewers, who have given it an IMDb score of 6.7 and a MetaScore of 36."
