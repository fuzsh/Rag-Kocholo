        "text": "Canadian film director (born 1947)\n\nAllan Moyle (born 1947) is a Canadian film director.[1] He is best known for directing the films Pump Up the Volume (1990) and Empire Records (1995).[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHis first major film was Times Square (1980). During the editing of the film he clashed with producer Robert Stigwood who reportedly wanted dialogue scenes removed and replaced with more musical sequences, so that the accompanying soundtrack recording could be expanded to a double-album. Moyle refused to make the cuts so Stigwood fired him and made the cuts himself.\n\nIn the eighties he wrote a novel that was never published but became the basis for his screenplay of his movie Pump Up the Volume, which he also directed. It was released in 1990.\n\nMoyle has since directed The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992), Empire Records (1995), New Waterford Girl (1999) - for which he won the Best Direction Canadian Comedy Award in 2001, XChange (2000), and the made-for-TV movies Jailbait (2000) and Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story (2004). His film, Weirdsville,[3] debuted at and headlined the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival in January, the film's stars include Taryn Manning.[3]\n\nHe is divorced from actress Dianna Miranda and currently married to Chiyoko Tanaka. He attended McGill University in Montreal and apprenticed at the New London Barn Theatre in New Hampshire.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nMontreal Main (1974, actor/writer)\n\nThe Mourning Suit (1975, actor)\n\nEast End Hustle (1976, actor/writer)\n\nOutrageous!
