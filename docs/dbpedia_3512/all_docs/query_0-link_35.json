At its base it attacks\n\nthe academic inflation of Japan, where kids spend 12+ hours a day in\n\nschool (some even go to a after school school) and even with top\n\ngrades you are not sure of your future. The irony is, that even though\n\nboth kids survive and escape, even beat the program, society wont\n\nrecognize their effort.\n\nWhile the film first and foremost is escapism, and only uses social\n\ncritisism as catalyst, it became one of the greatest box office hits\n\nin the history of Japan. People would wait in cues for hours to get\n\ntickets and you could buy Kitano action-man figures. Even McDonald\n\nJapan had LEGO Battle Royale figures in their happy meals. It touched\n\nsomething deep in the conscience of the Japanese youth.\n\nAround the time of its release, Kitano wrote one of his polemic provo\n\ncolumns, where he suggest all schools closed. Teachers were teaching\n\nthe same things they taught the kids parents, the kids had no respect\n\nfor the teachers anymore, to get into a university was only for the\n\nfilhty rich or the extremely lucky and so on.\n\nAvoid \"Battle Royale 2\" like the plague.\n\nHenrik\n\n11502\n\nFrom: Travis Miles\n\nDate: Mon Jun 28, 2004 5:10pm\n\nSubject: Re: Alan Clarke (Was: 80s and 90s Coppola / teen films)\n\nThere was a \"complete as possible\" retrospective of Alan Clarke at the\n\nNational Film Theater in London in 2002. Pretty much everything was\n\noutstanding, and cumulatively it was probably the most rewarding\n\nretrospective I've managed to view in toto.\n\nMade on video for tv, Stars of the Roller State Disco ranks high in the Alan\n\nClarke \"follow your man\" steadicam canon. In the future, job centers, roller\n\nrinks, and youth homes are combined to allow kids to roller skate all day\n\nwhile waiting to be called up for menial employment. Our hero is a diffident\n\nkid who refuses all options offered to him at the job counter (which is on\n\nthe opposite end of the rink from the concession stand), despite his\n\ngirlfriend's attempts to get him to conform. What makes it all extraordinary\n\nis that much of the shots were made with the cameraman (Clarke's regular\n\nsteadicam guy, I forget his name, but a real hero) on roller skates. The\n\nlengthy last shot of the kid listlessly skating around and around with the\n\nlights and people behind him increasingly blurring is a real jawdropper.\n\nThere were many other out-of-the-blue qualitative shockers in that season,\n\nbesides those that were obviously more immediately accomplished. Billy the\n\nKid and the Green Baize Vampire, Penda's Fen, Psy-Warriors, and Linda were\n\nuneven, but tremendous works.\n\nOn 6/28/04 11:32 AM, \"Dan Sallitt\""
