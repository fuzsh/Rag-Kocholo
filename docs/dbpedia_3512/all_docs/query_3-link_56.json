        "text": "FANTASIA #4\n\nRestoration debut\n\nIntroduced by Stephen Lack and DP Frank Vitale\n\nTHE RUBBER GUN feels and looks just like Wim Wenders did one of his B-side slice-of-life films while on exchange one semester in Montreal... I just saw several of Wenders's low-key urban social landscape films last autumn in Lyon, so I can identify that style when I see it. But it got me to thinking that Wenders is the anglophone slant to the French New Wave movement, and thus is an ideal influence for anglophones in Montreal.\n\nFollowing around privileged bohemian artists / drug dealers in the McGill Ghetto, driving along Docteur Penfield and Avenue des Pins as if they haven't changed a crack since 1977, I'm not…\n\nSociology student Allan Moyle falls in with an assemblage of omnisexual drug dealers/consumers who share a flat in Montreal and form a borderline cult around hyperverbal artist and front man Stephen Lack, all while a unit of lumpy police officers barely bothers to conceal the sting operation developing outside.\n\nThis is arty, breezy, deeply fascinating stuff, anchored by a towering lead performance by Stephen Lack (who wrote the script along with Moyle) as a too-smart-for-his-own-good hipster babbling an unending stream of sardonic, urbane ramblings. Moyle's debut feature is as gritty and choppy as its low-budget artsploitation pedigree would suggest (It's one of those movies where all the characters share the actors' names), but that works entirely in its favor. For…\n\nEasily my favorite Canadian film.\n\nMost Americans know more about Russia than they do about Canada. A shame, for our northern neighbors have always given us a wealth of strange movies.\n\nRemember the plot of THE PRODUCERS, where in order to make money they must lose money? From the mid-'70s to early-'80s, the Canadian film industry worked off that same premise. If you were, say, a Canadian dentist and wanted to funnel $2 million into a tax shelter, you invested in a film.\n\nIt didn't matter whether the film made money, lost money, was released or was even finished. This made every Canadian film of the time essentially an art film, since financial considerations were out the window. The Canadian…\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Watchlist! Challenge 2023\n\n#23 of 35 Watch a movie from your favorite genre: CRIME! (or maybe CANUXPLOITATION!)\n\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\n\nStephen Lack Can Ack(t)! Anyone who's a fan of the Cronenberg head-splodin' classic Scanners usually comes away with a poor opinion of the actor playing the main guy- he's some amateur in over his head.\n\nWRONG\n\nTurns out he's a terrific actor- his mostly comatose performance in Scanners is good character development since one of the effects of being a \"scanner\" is personality sublimation where a subject must be practically catatonic to survive. Here in The Rubber Gun (made previous to aforementioned film), Lack has a wonderful gift of gab. He never shuts up and everything he says…\n\nStephen: \"I feel like you're watching me die.\"\n\nAllan/Bozo: \"I thought I was watching you live.\"\n\nNearly two years after (now former) Cinefamily programmer Bret Berg wrote about this title in exceptional detail and clearly with a lot of love for it on Rupert Pupkin Speaks, I finally sat down on the first of November and watched THE RUBBER GUN. As a film from the era where all Canadian feature films were experimental, educational, or arthouse as fuck, THE RUBBER GUN is of that third set: a curiously metatextual faux documentary presumably inspired by its creators true-to-life experiences. Director Allan Moyle and other cast members appear in the film not as themselves, but as characters with their names (as in…"
