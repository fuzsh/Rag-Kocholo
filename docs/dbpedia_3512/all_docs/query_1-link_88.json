        "text": "Amy DeLouise is the founder of #GalsNGear - an organization committed to advocating for women in film and technology. After working on movies like Forrest Gump, Amy was inspired to create \"tequity\" - equity across the film and technology industries. She now works as a tireless advocate for other women, helping them build their careers and connect with opportunities to grow their careers.\n\n\"Beyond Visual,\" is an engaging new series that offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of our esteemed colleagues in Pro AV, through the transformative lens of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Aptly described as \"their story, in their own words,\" this captivating series delves into the compelling narrative of their career journeys, capturing both the trials and triumphs they've encountered along the way."
