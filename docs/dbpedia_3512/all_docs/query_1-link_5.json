        "text": "What a convoluted mess! It's so bad. And it really takes alot for me to rate a movie so low, but wow! Confusing, slow, erratic, cheap and gratuitous. With a horrible script, directing, music and editing. Nothing is cleary defined so I had no idea what was happening or why most of the time, and it was only exciting in the last 10 minutes.\n\nA Canadian knockoff of face off except here rich people swap minds for fast travel. The plot is a terrorsit takes over a corpy(corporate goon) body for reasons? And the main character gets stuck in a clone body called Jeff. One minute Kyle Mclaughlin is our main then all of sudden were stuck with dull Stephen Baldwin.\n\nThis movie smells its own farts so hard. It really thought it was being edgey and smart huh? Thankfully the writers didnt do much after this. Avoid at all costs. Unless your having a bad movie night.\n\nKinda clever DTV Canadian sci-fi from Allan Moyle (Pump Up the Volume, Empire Records) probably deserving of a higher budget. Conveys a corporate dystopia effectively enough, but the awful, awful, awful early 2000s Space Channel sheen (sorry this is my second review in a row complaining about it) makes the movie feel like it should be broken up with commercial breaks featuring a computer ad scored to a parody of Alice Deejay's \"Better Off Alone\".\n\nAdmittedly lost a lot of interest by the time I realized Kyle MacLachlan was gonna ROLL IN ROLL OUT so early\n\nSort of a DTV riff on Face/Off (I know i couldn't believe it either--and it's from the director of Pump Up the Volume and Empire Records too) with uptight middle management exec Kim Coates swapping bodies with terrorist Kyle MacLachlan (whoa!) This then goes a step further by having MacLachlan jumping bodies into that of a clone played by Stephen Baldwin. So it's Baldwin vs Coates. Because Baldwin is a clone, his body is going to fall apart in roughly 48 hours so he's got a giant deadline to get himself transferred back into the right body here, but first he has to find it!\n\nThis actually starts out fairly well, with it feeling a little more like Total Recall…\n\nA little Canadian sub Dickian DTV sci-fi thriller that is actually a good deal more interesting than most actual Dick adaptations. A corporate asshole has to make use of current xchange technology of body swaping to go to a business meeting just to lose his original body to a terrorist with some big wig backers. Reliable Allan Moyle directs with a lot of neat ideas and some Verhovenian sense of satirical fun. The last act is a bit disappointing action oriented (Moyle is many things, but action director is not one of them) and plot dictactes the film has to swap leads from Kyle MacLachlan to Stephen Baldwin which is not fair (that said casting Baldwin as an assembly line cloned body with an expirating date is genius).\n\nA movie that should be watched before any election, before any movement into a position of political power, before we see cycles repeat themselves over and over, from Ancient Rome to today. An explosive illustration of the plots and intrigues of those with political power and their attempts to retain and consolidate it. Virtually every character is a manipulator. \"They await you sir, on the Capitol. The senate comes up there expressly to swear to your laws before Jupiter's eyes.\"\n\nIt’s a fun concept. Inception body snatching and the plot is slightly predictable since it’s one that has been done over and over again, but there is some freshness to it.\n\nMoyle doesn’t do action sequences well though. Also the production was a bit low budget so the effects shots suffer. MacLauchlin and Baldwin are good enough in it to pull you through the movie. I feel like if this was done in the 80s it would have more of that futuristic charm, however this was at a time studios were pumping out dvd movies no matter how low the quality. I doubt Moyle is happy with this final product."
