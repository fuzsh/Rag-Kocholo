Tension is low.\n\nWar is just a decoration, but really this movie is about nothing. There is no conflict with the characters, there is no emotional story. Sometimes you feel that this movie was written by a neural network, or writers just follow the cloud of tags. The acting is also not really good. Maybe this film can work a few years ago, but in 2022 it is just outdated, especially in Ukraine."
