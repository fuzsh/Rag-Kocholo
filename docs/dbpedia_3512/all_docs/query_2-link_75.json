        "text": "JCCV FILM NIGHT\n\nMonday, March 30th at 7:00 pm\n\nJewish Community Centre of Victoria, 3636 Shelbourne St.\n\nNEW WATERFORD GIRL (1999 Comedy, 97 mins)\n\nDIRECTOR: Allan Moyle STARRING: Nicholas Campbell, Mary Walsh, Andrew McCarthy, Liane Balaban and Tara Spencer-Nairn\n\nThe JCCV is proud to present New Waterford Girl! One of the best Canadian films of all time! Set in the Nova Scotia Town of New Waterford on Cape Breton, this is the story of a “troubled youth” desperate to leave her small sheltered Catholic community. Her outrageous scheme to fulfill her goals is the spotlight here. Unlike a lot of teen comedies, this is not a mere guilty pleasure to watch. The proof is in the laughter and spontaneous applause that erupts in response to a pitch-perfect script. This quirky, charming film is funny, generous, and exuberant! Viewing satisfaction guaranteed!\n\nPlease join us for a laugh out loud evening of cinema…schmoozing…discussing and having a good time! State of the Art projection, large screen & great sound! A classic cartoon and/or newsreel prior to the feature!\n\nSnacks and cold drinks included. Admission by donation.\n\nDick de Ryk – Resident Movie Critic and Comic Book Aficionado\n\nContact: eegabeeva@shaw.ca\n\nThe Food For Thought Luncheon scheduled for Monday, March 16th has been postponed out of due precaution in keeping with COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.\n\nThank you for your Understanding.\n\nTopic: Managing Johnny Cash, as an Atheist Jew\n\nSpeaker: Jonathan Holiff, Filmmaker\n\nJoin us for a fascinating conversation with filmmaker, Jonathan Holiff, whose 2013 documentary, “My Father and The Man In Black,” chronicles the unlikely relationship between bad-boy Johnny Cash and his strait-laced manager, the late Canadian Saul Holiff.\n\nJonathan’s film is both a behind-the-scenes look at Johnny Cash’s troubled 1960s, as well as an examination of the father-son relationship; Saul was Jonathan’s father. The film also supplies the ending that was missing from the hit movie, “Walk The Line:” Johnny Cash’s conversion to fundamentalist Christianity. This will be the focus of the discussion.\n\nAt the height of the singer’s career, Johnny Cash was “born again.” The drama that followed between manager and star, which grew out of concern for Johnny’s recording career, saw faith and reason collide in spectacular fashion. When one man finds a new calling, the other has to choose between his job and his integrity.\n\nSaul Holiff retired to Victoria in 1979. In 1983, enrolled as a mature student, he graduated with an Honours B.A. in History from the University of Victoria. In 2005, at the age of 79 and in ill-health, Holiff committed “rational suicide.”\n\nThis sit-down luncheon will feature clips from the film as well as recorded phone calls between the two men from the early 1970s.\n\nWhen: Monday, March 16th, 12:00 to 2:00 pm\n\nWhere: JCCV, 3636 Shelbourne Street\n\nSit down luncheon includes coffee or tea and dessert.\n\nCost is $15.00, $12.00 for JCCV members. Call or email the JCCV at 250-477-7185 or jccv@telus.net to reserve.\n\nTopic: Negotiating with Giants\n\nSpeaker: Peter D. Johnston\n\nPeter D. Johnston is a leading thinker and practitioner in the realm of negotiation, and the author of the international bestseller, Negotiating with Giants. A Harvard MBA, Peter has advised CEOs on critical transactions, guided senior government officials in the face of national conflicts and helped entire industries initiate and manage change. His knowledge and abilities have been formally recognized by the U.S. government for their positive economic and social impact. Peter has worked with clients around the globe on their most challenging negotiations — clients such as HSBC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Suez, Johnson & Johnson, The United Nations and The World Bank. As the Managing Director of NAI Limited, founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he has been featured in dozens of interviews by media including CNN, Fox Business News, The Globe and Mail, The Wall Street Journal and Oprah & Friends.\n\n“Negotiating with Giants is entertaining and any one of its six chapters will unveil insights you’ll want to pass along to a friend, colleague or family member.”\n\n—- Business Class Magazine\n\nWhen: Monday, February 17th, 12:00 to 2:00 pm\n\nWhere: JCCV, 3636 Shelbourne Street\n\nSit down luncheon includes coffee or tea and dessert.\n\nCost is $15.00, $12.00 for JCCV members.
