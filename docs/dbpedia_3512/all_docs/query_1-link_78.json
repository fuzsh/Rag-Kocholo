Half of patients who smoke continue to do so through cancer treatment, and many who quit resume smoking after treatment ends (Toll et al., 2013, Lucchiari, et al., 2016; Ramaswamy et al., 2016; NCI, 2018). Racial and ethnic minority groups have lower abstinence rates and use cessation aids/pharmacotherapy less often than White people who smoke (Leventhal et al., 2019; Garrett et al., 2015).\n\nThe NCI Cancer Moonshot-funded Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) has engaged 52 NCI-designated Cancer Centers (CCs) in integrating tobacco cessation services into clinical care. Over the past 4 years, reach – the percentage of patients who engage in any tobacco treatment service – has roughly doubled (D’Angelo et al., 2021). Despite strong gains, many patients are still being left behind.\n\nThis toolkit includes a catalyst film which summarizes findings from research about diverse patients’ experiences with smoking, cancer, and tobacco cessation at C3I cancer centers. The toolkit also includes materials to guide this film’s use with various audiences. If you are new to using a catalyst film, you might find it valuable to review our introduction to catalyst films guidebook available at: https://www.healthexperiencesusa.org/CatalystFilms.\n\nWho should use this toolkit?\n\nThis toolkit is intended to be used by patients and families; clinicians, including oncology clinicians and tobacco cessation specialists; researchers; and health program and system leaders and administrators.\n\nWhat does the toolkit contain?\n\nThis toolkit contains the following:\n\nCatalyst film: Health Experiences Catalyst Films are short films that summarize key findings from interviews with people discussing their experiences with health and health care. This catalyst film is about peoples’ experiences of smoking, cancer, and tobacco cessation. The film can help patients feel support from others like them; clinicians and researchers develop and deliver more effective cessation interventions; and health systems leaders appreciate the challenges of tobacco cessation and the need for investment.\n\nFacilitation guide: The toolkit contains facilitation materials including a draft agenda for an educational session with clinicians and administrators using the catalyst film. This agenda can be adapted for sessions with other audiences such as patients and families.\n\nReflection worksheet: This toolkit contains a list of reflection questions that can guide conversation after viewing the film.\n\nHow should these tools be used?\n\nThis film and accompanying toolkit are intended to increase understanding and empathy for all people who smoke or have smoked by exploring their experiences, personal histories, motivations and messages for others. They are also intended to increase the chances that health care providers and patients can make decisions together without the interference of shame or judgment.\n\nMore specifically, the materials in this toolkit can be used to:\n\nInform oncology clinicians and tobacco cessation specialists about dimensions of peoples’ diverse experiences with smoking and tobacco cessation that may not always be readily available in clinical settings.\n\nDevelop or hone empathic support for people with cancer who have experiences of smoking and tobacco cessation\n\nSpark conversations about enhancing or changing certain clinical practices in oncology and tobacco cessation settings\n\nGarner support for further investment in tobacco cessation resources for people with cancer or high cancer risk\n\nThe catalyst film can be viewed in full or in sections. Sections can be combined to meet the needs of different audiences. In addition to the Introduction and Credits sections which we recommend be included on any viewing, available sections include:\n\nReasons for Smoking\n\nSmoking and Cancer\n\nCessation Specialists\n\nClinician Interactions\n\nStigma\n\nQuitting or Not Quitting\n\nMotivations for Quitting\n\nReasons Not to Quit\n\nEffects of Quitting\n\nStrategies for Quitting\n\nMessages to other Patients\n\nMessages to Family and Friends\n\nMessages to Clinicians\n\nDevelopment of this toolkit\n\nThe Catalyst Films about Health Experiences: Smoking, Cancer, and Tobacco Cessation was developed by researchers and clinicians (Principal Investigator: Rachel Grob) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine & Public Health – Department of Family Medicine and Community Health.\n\nThis film was created from interviews with 18 people with experiences of smoking, cancer, and tobacco cessation, which includes people who have quit smoking and those who haven’t. Participants were recruited all over the United States through the following cancer centers: City of Hope; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering; The Medical University of South Carolina; Yale; Oregon Health Sciences University; Fred Hutchinson; Duke; University of California-Davis; and Stanford.\n\nAll who shared their stories for this project identified themselves as belonging to groups identified in this study’s context as historically marginalized. This includes being part of a racial and ethnic minority group; from a household that has little income or wealth to buffer against the negative impacts of an adverse health event; living in a rural location (outside urban area, <50,000 people); part of a sexual or gender minority group (people who identify as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community); disabled; part of an underrepresented religious group; an immigrant or refugee; formerly incarcerated; retired; a veteran; living with and/or after substance use disorders; or living with mental illness.\n\nThis project was supported by a supplement from the National Cancer Institute.
