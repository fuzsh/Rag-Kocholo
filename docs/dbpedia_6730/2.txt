just wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of resources for weblogs on personal websites, as opposed to using blogger.com, etc. i want to be able to personalize more than i am currently doing but i'm a little bit of a loss for where to look or even source code to make one...

Well, my biases lead towards LiveJournal. I haven't needed to customize more than it offers, and it offers CSS, so that's... quite a bit. I haven't even touched that, though; still letting other people (some LJ-official, but mine currently just another user's who wanted to create a style) do the CSS work for me.

You might also look at Moveable Type (http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/), or services such as TextDrive's (http://www.textdrive.com/) which offer you Moveable Type and enough freedom anyway to do whatever you'd like.

Really, though, LiveJournal is nice -- especially when you start to find more communities and other users of more interest, since your own account there facilitates that kind of growth.

I've heard of other kind services: myspace, xanga.

I've been very happy with WordPress since I started using it, but I'm not really sure where to begin recommending it because I don't really understand it -- it's been a lot of trial and error setting it up! I'm pretty handy with HTML but their codex and using PHP taxed my resources -- still, I needed it to do a few semi-complicated things and I always found the right plug-in. So... with a bit of know-how, time and patience, I think WordPress is wonderful.
