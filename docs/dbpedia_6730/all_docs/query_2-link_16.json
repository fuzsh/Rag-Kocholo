        "text": "On Sunday we drove up to Vail with some friends to go hiking. Iâ€™d never been hiking in the snow before, but sure enough it snowed the night before and a little on us during the hike. I took a few photos, but didnâ€™t really stop to make sure I was getting what I hopedâ€¦\n\nI get a number of e-mails from people who are interested in starting a blog and asking for advice, so I thought Iâ€™d throw a few general tips out here. I hope you guys will add to this list in the comments. In no particular orderâ€¦ Find a domain/URL that isnâ€™t too long or hardâ€¦\n\nSlate: How Bush Choose Stupidity. Ted Leung has some great quotes from Slack. The Mac is a Harsh Mistress Nicolas Cianca has a journal and photos from 9/11. NY Times columnist Bob Herbert writes about a recent speech by Al Gore.\n\nI had to get a mousepad because of the new desk. It seems ironic, but the my wrist would get a little stuck to the finish of the desk and my optical mouse didnâ€™t track well on the grain for some reason. I like what I ended up with, but I still feel like Iâ€¦\n\nIâ€™ve posted a few new WordPress Styles, one is a 3-column combination of my Blue Fade and Dots styles. Just a reminder, if you create a style youâ€™d like to share, Iâ€™m happy to add it to my list.\n\nI released Tasks Proâ„¢ 1.1.2 this afternoon. This adds a check to allow â€˜file:///â€™ URLs to not have â€˜http://â€™ prepended to them and removes a stray comment that was causing the timer not to work properly. I certainly didnâ€™t intend to put out another release so soon, but I hate having people download code thatâ€¦\n\nTasks Pro 1.1.2 released. This adds support for file:/// URLs.\n\nThe 1GB RAM module for my PowerBook arrived today as promised. I was starting to get impatient last week, but I think Apple probably handled this situation the right way. The RAM I initially ordered wasnâ€™t back-ordered, but they got a functional machine to me in a timely fashion and gave me some free RAMâ€¦\n\nMike Pinkerton has posted a bullet list of changes for Camino 0.9. I really hope they can enable spell checking in the textarea widget in one of these releases. I also hope they donâ€™t put the close icon on the left (like one of the mock-ups) when they create new tab widgets. I believe Caminoâ€¦\n\nI just cleaned out my PayPal account signing up for TextDrive. $200 for life (well, for TextDriveâ€™s life)! Iâ€™ll throw WordPress on there to get Matt another contribution. Just for clarification, Iâ€™m thrilled with my continuing relationship with Austin Web Development and have no plans to move sites from this server (this is a dedicatedâ€¦\n\nThis evening I granted permission for Blojsom to use the javaScript Quicktags I created for Tasks then gave to WordPress. I think itâ€™s cool that other projects can just plug them in like that. Itâ€™s also cool that they asked. ðŸ™‚ If anyone else wants to use the Quicktags code and the GPL (WordPress) andâ€¦\n\nIâ€™ve released Tasks Proâ„¢ 1.1.1. This release fixes a couple of minor bugs, adds additional strings for localization and adds a few small features: E-mail notifications are properly sent in the recipientâ€™s language instead of the senders. (Not surprisingly, no one reported this) Changed an option in the server settings to hide groups that usersâ€¦\n\nIâ€™ve made Tasks 2.0.1b1 available for download to my Tasks 2.0 customers. This has a few minor changes (as you might guess from the version number): Added a â€˜COMPLETEDâ€™ status to VTODO items in the iCalendar. Hide % Complete in tree view for tasks that have been converted to notes. Local Windows URLs (C:\\â€¦) doâ€¦\n\nWe got phone service through Qwest, but only one of the phone jacks in the house is active. It turns out the previous owner of my house had three phone lines coming into the house: a home line, a business line and a fax line. The fax line only came into the one outlet inâ€¦\n\nTasks Pro 1.1.1 released. This adds additional translation strings, a few small features and fixes a few bugs."
