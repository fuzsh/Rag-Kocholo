You suggest downloading Django like this:\n\ncurl http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/0.90/Django-0.90.tar.gz -\n\no Django-0.90.tar.gz\n\nYou can simplify that using the -O argument to curl (that's a capital\n\nO), which tells it to use the same filename when saving to disk:\n\ncurl -O http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/0.90/Django-0.90.tar.gz\n\nCheers,\n\nSimon\n\nOn 11/25/05, Simon Willison <swil...@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> You can simplify that using the -O argument to curl (that's a capital\n\n> O), which tells it to use the same filename when saving to disk:\n\n>\n\n> curl -O http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/0.90/Django-0.90.tar.gz\n\nGood call. I don't know much of curl's command-line options, being\n\nused to wget,but for a while wget wasn't available on TXD's shared\n\nservers; I think now it is, and I'll probably just update to use that\n\ninstead.\n\nî—“\n\nOn 11/25/05, James Bennett <ubern...@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> I spent some time with Georg's Django/lighttpd/FCGI instructions, got\n\n> Django running under my TextDrive account, and then wrote up some\n\n> (hopefully) easy-to-follow instructions which are now online:\n\n>\n\n> http://manuals.textdrive.com/read/book/15\n\nNicely done, James! This is great stuff.\n\nOne suggestion: The writeup should encourage people to chown their\n\nsettings file so that it's only readable by their own user account and\n\nthe Web server, as a security precaution. I apologize in advance if\n\nyou did indeed mentioned this, but I didn't see it during my cursory\n\nread.\n\nAdrian\n\n--\n\nAdrian Holovaty\n\nholovaty.com | djangoproject.com | chicagocrime.org"
