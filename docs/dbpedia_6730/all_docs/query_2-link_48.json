        "text": "I write to White Christian America. Who are we? As we read the Palm Sunday, Passion Week and Easter narratives, who are we? Where do we fit in the story?\n\nWe default to thinking of ourselves as the Disciples. We are the heroes of the story. We are the ones who walk with Jesus, who treasure His words, who fear the Romans and the corrupt religious establishment. We are the persecuted and the ones discriminated against.\n\nAs I‚Äôve listened more, I‚Äôve heard the people of Black Christian America say, ‚ÄúJesus is a Black man‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt understand what they meant. Jesus didn‚Äôt have black skin. He may have had darker skin than me (that‚Äôs not hard to do). He may have looked like a Middle Easterner. But he wasn‚Äôt black.\n\nBut this isn‚Äôt a statement about skin color. (Black Hebrew Israelites aside.) ‚ÄúJesus is a Black man‚Äù is a statement about society, culture, and status. It‚Äôs about where Jesus fit in the context of His world and how He was viewed and what people thought of Him.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, Judea was a cultural and economic backwater. It was the home of malcontents, criminals, and rebels. It was trouble. Anyone who came from Judea started off at a disadvantage and had to work twice as hard for respect. Just ask Herod.\n\nIf Judea was a cultural backwater, Nazareth was the cultural backwater of Judea. Jesus came from the cultural backwater of a cultural backwater. No one outside of Judea respected Judeans and no one in Judea respected Nazarenes.\n\nJesus surrounded Himself with unsavory people. People who were illiterate and crude. People who made a living cheating others. People who made a living doing dirty, smelly jobs. People who were criminals.\n\nThen He had the audacity to travel around telling everyone that they were doing life wrong, believing wrong, living wrong.\n\nLet‚Äôs put Jesus into our context. He was a poor, Black man, from West Baltimore. He was tatted up, wore his hair in cornrows. He was friends with rappers, drug dealers, street prostitutes, and con men. He wasn‚Äôt just surrounded by them, he made them part of His inner circle. Have you seen The Wire, the men from the projects? That was Jesus.\n\nWho are we? We are the White, well-to-do people who despise the inner cities. We consider them dirty, dangerous, unsavory, full of crime and moral degeneracy. Not only do we refuse to live there, we often refuse to travel there and fear the people who live there.\n\nWe certainly don‚Äôt want any of those street thugs telling us that we‚Äôre wrong about our mostly deeply held beliefs and need to make drastic changes. We don‚Äôt want to hear about our wrong view of history, our wrong views about poverty and money. We don‚Äôt want to hear that the nation we‚Äôve created and love and defend is wrong, and that we are culpable for much of the suffering in our world. We don‚Äôt want to hear some Black man telling us that the way to paradise and eternal life is to give away all our wealth to the people like Him, and then follow Him.\n\nWe don‚Äôt want to hear it. Jesus is a Black man and we are White Christian America. We are the religious leaders. We are the High Priests. We are the Roman oppressors. And we‚Äôre not following Jesus, as his faithful disciples. We are the synagogue rulers and political leaders who are worried about the troublemaking, rabble rousers from the inner cities. We are the villains of the story.\n\nFellow White people! Lend me your ears! Mekka Okereke, a Google engineer and a bonafide Black man, has been incredibly generous with his time and has explained some of our history to us. Throughout the month of February, ‚ÄúBlack History Month‚Äù, he took a timeout from Black history to talk about White American history instead. He posted threads almost every day, tackling one topic at a time.\n\nThese post threads are for White folks who don‚Äôt know their own history. White folks like me. I learned a lot from Mekka last month. I‚Äôve collected all 22 threads and I‚Äôm making them easy to find for all of my pasty compatriots who missed them the first time around. Come and learn.\n\nHere‚Äôs how Mekka kicked things off, on February 1.\n\nHappy #BlackHistoryMonth !\n\nYou know the drill by now. I don't like talking about Black history. Americans know Black history. I want to talk about white American history. In other words, racism, and the erasure of both positive achievements of, and injustices suffered by, non-white people. That's what people don't know.\n\nI'm not ready to talk about Black history. I want to talk about white US history.\n\nHere we go.\n\nFebruary 1:\n\nTry this: Ask your white US friends what the statue of liberty celebrates.\n\nNow ask your Black friends. Or French folk of any color.\n\nFebruary 02\n\nQ: \"Why don't Black people build any generational wealth? Newer immigrant groups seem to be doing just fine? Must be a lazy and shiftless people!\"\n\nA: Because for most of US history, white folk have intentionally destroyed the wealthiest Black neighborhoods in the US and stolen all the wealth.\n\nGreenwood. Allentown. Seneca Village. Rosewood. Freedmen's town.\n\nFebruary 03\n\nQ: Why do Black people see racism in everything?\n\nA: A few years ago, European tech entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky asked some very good questions in good faith. He asked why San Francisco and Madrid were different in so many confusing and awful ways. I answered each of his questions. Please verify each and every answer with a skeptic's keen eye.\n\nHere we go...\n\nFebruary 04\n\nDo you know that in the US, a Black 11 year old is 10 times more likely to die by drowning, than a white child?\n\nIn a nation that ignores racism, folk believe that this is because Black folk \"Don't swim well.\"ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nIt's 2023, and there are still folk that believe Black kids drown due to race, not racism.\n\nFebruary 05\n\nQ: Why do so many Black folk call Abraham Lincoln a white supremacist? He freed the slaves! Why don't Black folk have pictures of Lincoln up in their house? Are they ungrateful?\n\nA: Because Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist, and one of the worst kinds. He was an \"I know Black folk aren't inferior, but hey man, it's an 'us or them' thing, and I choose us to be in the superior position.\"\n\nFebruary 06\n\nThe US loves soldiers and veterans! Virtuous! Service! üá∫üá≤ü¶Ö\n\nThe US hates homeless people. Lazy! Dirty! Want a handout!\n\nBut... ~1 in every 20 US homeless folk is a Black or hispanic veteran. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nIn the USA, the phrase \"support our troops!\" is a euphemism that does mean military jingoism, but doesn't mean supporting all of our troops.\n\nFebruary 07\n\nQ: Why are Black neighborhoods so often high crime neighborhoods? Must be a lawless people! Violent! Thieves! Predators!\n\nA: There is no such thing as a \"high crime neighborhood.\" The whole concept is entirely made up based on our notion of what we consider a crime.\n\nYou may be thinking:ü§î Wait... What?! Not true! A high crime neighborhood has more drug use and sales, theft, and even murder!\n\nFebruary 08\n\nQ: Why do so many Black people refuse to sing the US national anthem? I'm sorry, but that seems unpatriotic to me. Plus, the Whitney Houston version is amazing! Why don't you like Whitney Houston? Whitney!\n\nA: Because more Black folk know the true history of the anthem, and some can't get past the racism.\n\nFebruary 09\n\nQ: Why do Black kids not do well in school? Is it because their dads are uninvolved and uncaring parents? Bill Cosby and Herschel Walker told me that, and they are good and wise men that we should listen to! It's Black dads' fault! Boo Black men!\n\nA: No. Black kids only do poorly in school in extremely racist countries.\n\nFebruary 10\n\nQ: Why are Black people in the US so much more likely to die in traffic accidents than white people? Are Black folk more likely to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI)? Is it street racing? Are y'all just bad drivers?\n\nA: Hmm. I'm stumped! No one knows the answer to why this happens! Just kidding. It's racism. It's always racism.\n\nFebruary 11\n\nQ: Why do Black folk commit more crime? I hear you on \"wage theft should be a crime too\" and all that... but if we look at convictions for murder, sexual assault, and drug possession, Black folk just commit way more crime! Those are facts!\n\nA: Black folk are convicted more. Black folk are many times more likely to be wrongfully convicted. Because racism.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nQ: Why are so many Black folk early adopters of tech like Uber and Amazon? Sometimes this willingness to try new tech early backfires on y'all, like the whole crypto scam. Tech companies don't always love you back. So... why so eager? Is it because of Deltron 3030 and Andr√© 3000? ü§îYou're... you're going to say racism aren't you?\n\nA: Yep! Racism. And go ahead and add Sears to that list of \"technology\" companies.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nQ: Why don't Black folk like things like rodeos, country music, and cowboys! But why are so many Black folk Dallas Cowboys fans? Could we use the Dallas Cowboys to introduce Black people to country culture?\n\nA: You might mean \"re-introduce.\" 1 in 5 wild west cowboys was Black. Almost all of the original cowboys were Black.\n\n(Texans all like \"I know this one! I'm getting an \"A\" today! Finally! Our time!\"ü§£)\n\nFebruary 15\n\nQ: Why do Black folk get so upset when people ask them if they live in this neighborhood? I saw a Black stranger in my building and I just asked him if he lived here and can I see 3 forms of government ID, and now I'm the racist? How? I voted for Obama! Twice! Why are Black folk so sensitive about this?\n\nA: Racism. This is a legacy of slavery and ethnic cleansing. Seriously.\n\nFebruary 16\n\nQ: Why do Black folk just assume that many supporters of Trump, Reagan, Nixon, etc are racist? That doesn't seem fair. Why do 90% of Black folk vote democrat? Why aren't more Black people \"free thinkers?\"\n\nA: Racism. Black US folk know about the \"Southern Strategy,\" and what Reagan, Nixon and their advisers said about us. They know the origins of the Alt-right. Many white US folk don't.\n\nFebruary 17\n\nQ: Why is it OK for Black folk to like the Black Panthers, but white folk can't like the klan? Black supremacy is just as bad as white supremacy! Why the double standard?\n\nA: Black folk know white US history, so they know that the Black Panthers were not Black supremacists.\n\n(At this point, half of the Black folk reading this just involuntarily said \"COINTELPRO!\" out loud).\n\nFebruary 18\n\nQ: Why does it seem like so much of the anti-Asian hate that I see on TV and in newspapers is done by Black people? It seems like Asian folk should be legitimately afraid of Black people! Why does it seem that way?\n\nA: Racism. Most Asian hate attacks are done by white folk. Asian folk are significantly safer from Asian hate, when they are around Black folk.üôÇüôÉ\n\nNewspapers lied on us.\n\nFebruary 19\n\nQ: Why is so much Black music about violence and misogyny? I'm not racist, but I think Black culture is just more violent. Why does it seem that way?\n\nA: Racism. Rap, trap, and drill, are only the most popular genres of Black music listened to by white people. The most popular among Black folk is R&B, almost 2X as popular. Violent rap is mostly for y'all.ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/945163/leading-music-genres-african-american/\n\nFebruary 20\n\nQ: Why were Black folk so happy when OJ was acquitted? To be honest, it feels disgusting. Why does it seem like you're happy he got away with murderer?\n\nA: Racism. Black folk did not like OJ that much. In fact, many Black people think he did it. Black folk didn't \"celebrate OJ.\" Black folk celebrated the hope that a brutally unjust, evil, and racist system, could be defeated at all.\n\nFebruary 21\n\nQ: Enough about racism for a second. Take a break! I'm worried about gender issues in the US too. For example, why is the gender pay gap in the US so large? It's one of the worst in the OECD!\n\nA: You know why. Racism! In the US, the pay gap between white men and white women, is smaller than the pay gap between white women and Black and Latinx women.\n\nEarnings and wages - Gender wage gap - OECD Data\n\nFebruary 23\n\nQ: Not everything is racism! E.g. Black folk die young because of high BMI from their bad diets! That's on y'all! Don't hate on Lululemon leggings or khaki pants! Hate yourself! We're only trying to help you! How is this racism?\n\nA: Black people in the UK have higher BMI than white people, and live longer than white people.üôÇüôÉ\n\nBMI is racist, and used to justify racism.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nQ: Why does it seem like Black folk don't contribute much to society or science or history? Most inventions are from Europeans? Why does it seem this way? Don't cancel me!\n\nA: Racism. The lie of white supremacy requires that we pretend that white men are the only people that ever invented anything or contributed to society.\n\nOne of the joys of living in southern Arizona is getting to see the saguaro cacti. I can see them all around town and there are large ‚Äúforests‚Äù of them in the Sonoran Desert.\n\nI recently saw this Kingfisher & Wombat tweet thread from Sat, February 22, 2020 at 05:34 PM about the saguaro. It's worth your time.\n\nSo following my retweet of the saguaros being cut down, it occurs to me that the extraordinary nature of the saguaro may not be common knowledge. Therefore, let us talk about this marvelous vegetative creature.\n\nThere‚Äôs a fairytale quality to the origin of this cactus. They sound more like how you make a unicorn or a cockatrice than a plant. ‚ÄúBorn from an egg laid by a rooster under the Dog Star and incubated by a serpent.‚Äù ‚ÄúSprung from the drops of blood from a martyred saint.‚Äù\n\nWell, the saguaro fruit must be eaten by a coyote or a cactus wren and deposited in the shade of an ironwood to nurse. No, really.\n\nMesquite or palo verde will also work, but the cactus requires a nurse tree. The seeds can be eaten by a coyote, but a dove or a quail will digest them instead of passing them whole.\n\nIn the event the proper animal ate them and pooped in the proper nurse tree, it will take a decade for the saguaro to grow more than two inches tall.\n\nBetween 50-100 years, the first arm appears. It will likely flower before this, in its thirties. The flowers must be pollinated, probably by bats.\n\nBy this point, it will have outlived its nurse (and probably outcompeted it.) Those cactus with dozens of arms? OLD.\n\nThe cactus is not considered an adult until it is over a hundred years old. It can live to be two hundred, with luck.\n\nTo get away from the cold facts for a minute...saguaros, if you live around them, are, uh...Not just plants. There‚Äôs stuff going on there. People stuff. Saguaros have souls.\n\nI realize I romanticize plants all the time, so you can feel free to dismiss this as my usual bullshit, but saguaros are...yeah. Okay, you ever met a tree that you thought was big and old and maybe like a person? The whole species is like that. Saguaros are special.\n\nGiant redwoods are a little too obviously gods, any fool can see it, but saguaros are something else.\n\nAnyway. It is worth noting that even if you dismiss my half-baked garden faith, saguaros are the pinnacle of a web of ecosystem arrangements. Three other species, minimum, are required to make a saguaro. Wren, ironwood, bat. Or coyote, mesquite, hummingbird. But three minimum.\n\nThis is why they‚Äôre so ultimately fragile. They rely on the others to even exist. They are a group effort! But they do repay it. Dozens of species live in them, on them, and by them.\n\nWoodpeckers dig holes, elf owls live in the holes, hawks nest on top, everybody eats the fruit.\n\nThey are the nexus of the web. They‚Äôre special. Natives in the area have very respectful terms for them, though I do not know enough to give you any details. They‚Äôre one of the great goods of the world,and cutting them down is a cruel thing.\n\nThat‚Äôs all.\n\nWell, no, one more thing. I joke sometimes that when I die, the primary witnesses for the defense will be all the turtles I helped across the road. I‚Äôm pretty sure if a saguaro spoke up for someone, they‚Äôd halt the proceedings and send you on your way at once.\n\nAnd hey‚Äîwe get down on humanity sometimes, we really do, and that border wall is an abomination, but the people of Arizona made laws to protect saguaros. Imperfect, flawed, but by god, they recognized and they‚Äôre trying. Credit where due.\n\nAlmost 13 years ago, I signed up for a shared hosting account on a little web host called TextDrive. I didn't know it then, but that was my introduction to a community that I'm still a part of today.\n\nTextDrive was founded by Dean Allen, a man with a love for writing and for the ability of typesetting to make writing pop off of the screen. I wasn't a Dean Allen fan ‚Äî I didn't come to TextDrive because of Dean. I came because TextDrive looked like a good hosting company for people who loved technology, and who loved to tinker on the web.\n\nTextDrive was that. Of all of the hosting companies that I've used over the past 20 years, TextDrive was the best. Dean and Jason gave us a remarkable amount of freedom on their servers, while sparing us from the challenges of being administrators of our own systems. They were personable, with a seemingly endless supply of patience for our requests and the ways that we found to crash their servers.\n\nBut I found more than just a good web host. I found a community of the like minded. We all liked to tinker and to write. Some linked to tinker so much that they became members of TextDrive's support staff. The TextDrive forums were our shared campfire. (I mostly sat in the shadows). When TextDrive was absorbed into Joyent, we moved together to the Joyent forums. And when Joyent stopped offering shared hosting, we stayed in touch through Twitter and Slack. The community feels special because we each have different backgrounds, careers, and interests. We have different levels of technical skill. On the surface, it sometimes seems that we have little in common. But we're still united by that shared interest in writing and in tinkering.\n\nLast week, I learned that Dean Allen had died. I feel his loss less keenly than others in the community only because I knew him less well than they did. But I mourn the loss of him nonetheless, because of what he did to attract so many like minded individuals. I've been shaped by that community in various ways and wouldn't be quite who I am today without them and without him.\n\nJoel, a member of our TextDrive community, wrote some thoughts on Dean's passing, Retooling. I was struck by his thoughts and his Twitter summary of them.\n\nFor God‚Äôs sake, stay in touch\n\nA good way to stay in touch is to keep blogging\n\nBe your whole self online\n\nMake the whole soup from scratch\n\nI was especially struck by Joel's third point.\n\nOne thing about blogging, as opposed to clipping words into a stream of status updates, is that it gives you room to be your political self (say) without collapsing the rest of you out of sight. Dean‚Äôs politics were pretty clear to anyone who read him, and he was no stranger to the polemic, but he let himself be more than his politics, to such an extent that people who disagreed with his politics (including myself at the time) were happy to congregate together around him.\n\nMaybe when we each have our own spaces to think and express ourselves, and when we Stay In Touch mainly by checking in on each other‚Äôs spaces, we do better at thinking together.\n\nPolitics (e.g.) are important. But, thanks in part to my experience with Dean and people at TextDrive, I can see that being inclusive, allowing ourselves to be and see more than our politics, happens to be good for our politics. The fact that they took this approach, and looked past my freshman twerpisms, was helpful for me at the time, and a factor in several changes-of-mind down the road.\n\nI'm not good at being my whole self online. I'm an introvert. I'm very, very comfortable with my introvertedness. I'm not lonely. I'm perfectly content to spend an evening (or 10) with the quiet comfort of my own thoughts. That leads me to spend a lot of time having internal dialogs, forgetting that no one else can hear my constant conversation. And then I realize that's been two months since I posted anything, anything at all, on my blog and longer still since I publicly wrote anything of true meaning.\n\nJoel's thoughts challenged me to make public interaction a priority. Post something, even if it's just a link to something that I found interesting. Post everything, even if it's political and might annoy people. Post about who I am ‚Äî my whole self ‚Äî my love for books, my nascent interest in comic books and console games, the boardgames that I'm enoying, the frustrations and joys of parenting, my complaints about American Christianity, everything.\n\nI'm not sure how successful I'll be. It's a struggle to take the constant stream of thoughts in my head and focus on one long enough to freeze it and put it online. But I think it's worth doing. Community is important and I can only be a part of an online community if I'm willing to be heard.\n\nWhen I was young, before junior high, I strongly believed that women were the weaker sex and that it was up to men to protect them. I believed that women shouldn't fight in the military, that they probably shouldn't engage in the hurly-burly of the working world, and that men should take on all of the physically demanding work leaving women the easier, less physically demanding work.\n\nThrough the loving, persistent efforts of a Sunday School teacher and many female friends, I became accustomed to the idea that women were just as hardy as men, just as able to take on any task, just as able to bear any burden, and just as able to engage the world. For the past 15‚Äì20 years, I've heard that women are equal to men in any area that they care to be involved in and that men shouldn't treat them any differently from how men treat other men. I thought that being a feminist meant believing that there were few, if any, differences between the genders.\n\nOver the past 2 years, I've run into a different brand of feminists. They tell me that women are horribly discriminated against. They tell me that men are predatory beasts who prey upon women and that it's up to men to protect women from these predators. They tell me that women want to be computer engineers, software designers, scientists, and mathematicians but that the culture in these fields is too toxic for women to endure. They tell me that these fields need to be cleaned up and sanitized before women can feel safe enough to work there.\n\nNow I don't know what to think. Are women strong and resilient like men? Are they hardy, able to live in unpleasant conditions, to clear a space for themselves, and to blaze a trail? Or are they hothouse flowers who need a carefully controlled environment before they can live and thrive? Are women as I was taught: strong, confident, able to defend themselves? Or are women as I first believed: a weaker sex that needs to be protected by the strong sex?\n\nHere's a perfect example of my dilemma. An anonymous women provided this advice on software development: Engaging With Hateful People in Your Community Lends Legitimacy to Their Presence. She's writing in the context of a software development project that takes feedback and contributions from the general public. The words are hers. Any extra emphasis comes from me.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the right way to deal with male supremacists and similar hate groups showing up?\n\nI don‚Äôt have a clear answer. What I care most about is that community members are protected.\n\nHere‚Äôs my suggestion #1: Don‚Äôt engage. It‚Äôs better to instantly block that person from the repo and delete their comments.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nGitHub‚Äôs weaknesses make it not very safe for women and minorities, so if you want those voices heard, avoid the GitHub issue tracker.\n\nBy the way: Similar things apply when male supremacists send you reasonable-looking pull requests.\n\nI noticed that this gr.amergr.ate person had sent a small PR to a [my-project] plugin, and the plugin maintainer merged it.\n\nThis made me super uncomfortable, and I hope I don‚Äôt have to interact with that maintainer, because I really don‚Äôt trust their judgment.\n\nWhen you get a PR from an author whose very name spells hate, then even if the diff looks reasonable, don‚Äôt merge it.\n\nThis women is arguing that the best way to get women involved in software development is for other people to carefully police the software project, instantly banning commenters and contributors just on the basis of their usernames.\n\nShe's not arguing that these contributors have demonstrated harmful behavior and need to be banned on that basis. She's not arguing that these individuals have personally done anything that's even threatening. She's arguing that usernames that represent a community that she doesn't like are themselves a threat and that anyone with such a username should be immediately banned from the software project. Without this, she won't feel safe enough to contribute to the project.\n\nTo my ears, this represents a view of women as hothouse flowers that need protection. This isn't something that a strong, confident, assertive, girl power, \"hear me roar\" woman would write. This is something written by a woman who always needs a fainting couch nearby, a shrinking violet who can't survive in the harsh, uncontrolled environment of the real world.\n\nI'm willing and ready to treat women however they want to be treated. Just, please, make up your minds. Should I censor your mail, only passing along what's safe for you to read? Should I carefully pre-screen your online communities before letting you engage? Should I create special woman-safe zones, carefully monitoring language and behavior for anything indelicate or offensive? Or should I stand back and let you engage the world as equals, trusting that you're strong enough to face whatever comes your way, that you're up to the challenge of engaging the world without a male chaperone?"
