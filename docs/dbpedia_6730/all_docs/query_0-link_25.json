        "text": "Well...the new year looks to be off to a slightly shaky start for me! I got a few e-mails from my hosting provider (www.fluidhosting.com). The first was an announcement that their hosting plans changed and that I would have to upgrade to a different plan sometime this year. From the looks of it, it looks like the pricing of a plan that is nearly identical to mine is almost double what I’m paying now! Not good! On top of that, I received a few e-mails regarding an e-mail server outage that lasted almost two whole days as well as a maintenance announcement on my web server. This is due to the fact that they changed the location of their main data centers and, well, looks like they have a few bugs to work out. So...in the end, it looks like I’m in the market for a better hosting provider!\n\nThe two I’ve sort of narrowed down after a single day of research is these two:\n\nDreamhost (www.dreamhost.com)\n\nI’ve tried them before but really didn’t want to mess with all the security stuff they implemented on their server. They seem pretty good but I’ve read some reports about how their database servers can be really slow during peak hours. That could be a deal breaker for me!\n\nMedia Temple (www.mediatemple.net)\n\nWhat’s funny about their site is that it appears that a few other sites have actually ripped the design! Guess they did something right with it! I’m pretty impressed with the presentation...simple, clean, and very professional! The control panel is the same used by Fluid Hosting so it would be a snap to get used to them. However, the main thing I’m highly concerned about is the use of MySQL 3.23.58 instead of a 4.0.x version or higher! All my databases are running on 4.0.x so going backwards doesn’t set well for me at the moment. This could be a serious deal breaker too!\n\nGuess what I’m wondering is if others have used these two and what you seriously think about them. Also, are there some other hosting providers I should consider? What I really need is a provider that would allow me to host at least 5 domains (with subdomains as well!), at least 10 MySQL databases, a good control panel (Plesk or H-Sphere prefered! I hate CPanel!!), and a solid reputation for reliability, speed, and uptime. Cost shouldn’t be a problem since my budget is around $30 a month or so."
