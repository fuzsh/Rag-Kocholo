        "text": "Distracted driving has become a deadly epidemic on our roads. Cell phone use — specifically, texting, talking, and social media use — has become the most common distraction. Other risky actions include adjusting the radio or GPS, applying makeup, eating and drinking. By driving distracted, you’re robbing yourself of seconds that you may need to avoid a close call or deadly crash.\n\nDrive Responsibly\n\nIn 2022, distracted driving killed 3,308 people. April, which is national Distracted Driving Awareness Month, is a good time to regroup and take responsibility for the choices we make when we’re on the road. Follow these safety tips for a safe ride:\n\nNeed to send a text? Pull over and park your car in a safe location.\n\nDesignate your passenger as your “designated texter” to respond to calls or messages.\n\nDo not scroll through apps while driving. Struggling not to text and drive? Put the cell phone in the trunk, glove box, or back seat of the vehicle until you arrive at your destination.\n\nThe Consequences\n\nDuring a portion of Distracted Driving Awareness Month, from April 4 through 8, you may see increased law enforcement on the roadways as part of the national paid media campaign Put the Phone Away or Pay. This campaign reminds drivers of the deadly dangers and the legal consequences – including fines – of texting behind the wheel.\n\nTake Action"
