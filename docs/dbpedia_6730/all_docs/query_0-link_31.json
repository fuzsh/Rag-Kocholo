        "text": "I wanted to have a good repository of my code projects just in case something bad happens. Searching info here and there, I found the following pages useful for setting up my own repository in textdrive, and also installing and configuring the appropiate software on my mac.\n\nSo first thing was creating the repository, from the webmin administration tool (in textdrive, of course)\n\nThen I found this cool page by Josh Buhler, explaining how to install all the svn tools for Mac Os X. Once all is instaled, I jumped to this textdrive forum thread on using subversion on TXD, which is a bit old but gave me the idea of how to refer to the svn paths. I thought it was something like svn://.... but it was http://... (no wonder why it gave me a timeout each time I tried to access it!).\n\nWith it, I could go to the terminal and make the first import and put the first version in my repository! I did it as it is explained in this good article at macdevcenter: Making the Jump to Subversion. Basically the most important step here is making a copy of your source code before importing to the repository, then import it, rename the first folder as Myfolder_beforeSVN, and check it out again in the MyFolder folder - so you get the contents again from the repository, but this time they are all marked like subversionized, and if you look carefully, you'll note their icon exhibits a little check box - to make clear they are under the subversion domain and they are up to date.\n\nIf you are a bit curious and run ls -la in your code folder, you'll note there's a little new (and hidden) folder called .svn which contains something like this:\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â Â 12 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â 408 Jan 22 18:57 .\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â 119 soleÂ soleÂ Â 4046 Jan 22 18:57 ..\n\n-r--r--r--Â Â Â Â 1 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â 118 Jan 22 18:57 README.txt\n\n-r--r--r--Â Â Â Â 1 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â Â 78 Jan 22 18:57 dir-wcprops\n\n-r--r--r--Â Â Â Â 1 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â Â Â 0 Jan 22 18:57 empty-file\n\n-r--r--r--Â Â Â Â 1 soleÂ soleÂ 31254 Jan 22 18:57 entries\n\n-r--r--r--Â Â Â Â 1 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â Â Â 2 Jan 22 18:57 format\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â 114 soleÂ soleÂ Â 3876 Jan 22 18:57 prop-base\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â 114 soleÂ soleÂ Â 3876 Jan 22 18:57 props\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â 114 soleÂ soleÂ Â 3876 Jan 22 18:57 text-base\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â Â Â 6 soleÂ soleÂ Â Â 204 Jan 22 18:57 tmp\n\ndrwxr-xr-xÂ Â 114 soleÂ soleÂ Â 3876 Jan 22 18:57 wcprops\n\nÂ\n\nI think that it is where subversion holds all the info for the files and so on, like the CVS folders which are created in each folder when you use CVS.\n\nAnd that's all! Now there's no excuse for not being a bit less messy when it comes to having backups and a clean code. Hope you're lucky with it all..."
