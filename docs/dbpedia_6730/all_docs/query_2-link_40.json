So far I’ve learned how to “write a compelling blog” (please, have you been to blogwaffe before?).\n\nMore to the point, I finally got to meet Podz and Matt.\n\nFor all the readers at home, you can check out the wordcamp flickr photostream.\n\nUpdate 08.07.2006:\n\nAfter lunch I went to talks about WordPress MU, server optimization and a really good one on microformats. I also met Ryan, Mark, Andy, and Donncha.\n\nThe day was made all the sweeter by the bumping afterparty. By the way, Ryan, your penalty for not attending the postWordCamp bash is to recommend to me a favorite beer of yours.\n\nIn a way, I’m a little sad to see it go. My unconventional port and I have been together for a long time now. It’s been a source of conversation, intrigue and misplaced pride. Sadly, the pros of moving on outweigh the cons.\n\nFor those of you who hadn’t noticed after this ~day of being offline: http://blogwaffe.com.\n\nI didn’t want to name names until all had settled, but I’m now very happy to say that blogwaffe is being served by TextDrive. I absolutely could not be happier with the service or its people. TextDrive’s servers are fast, highly configurable and very usable while all the while the folks running the show are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable nearly to the point of being scary. I had a couple questions about the best way to move the site over while maintaining the old links. Not only did they have answers, they had implementable solutions. Many thanks to Ryan, Jason and the lot.\n\nAlso, I’d be remiss if I didn’t give a loud shout out to Matt who was responsible for setting us up the bomb in the first place. So thanks, Matt.\n\nUPDATE: The documentation for this plugin is now on my AJAX Comment Preview page. All the talk below of the installation being hard is out of date. Things are much easier now.\n\nI’ve looked around occasionally for a good comment preview plugin for the site. There’s a few “Live” preview plugins around, but I find an as-you-type update of your comment really annoying. Plus, those plugins are entirely javascript based; they can’t know what the server will do to a comment after it gets sent off, so it’s not robustly WYSIWIG.\n\nThere seemed to be no good pre-fab solution fitting all my criteria:\n\nNot live updating (who’d have thought you’d need to specify the negative)\n\nAll content filtered through WordPress ensuring solid WYSIWIGnitude\n\nDelicious AJAX goodness to avoid hard refreshes\n\nSo I made my own.\n\nRead more…"
