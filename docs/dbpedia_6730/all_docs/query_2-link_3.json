        "text": "The Company collects certain additional information in connection with your use of our Services, web-based products and/or desktop products with online features. For instance:\n\n• Product Updates: Some products provide you with the ability to download and register product and/or tax updates as they become available. During the download and registration process, we collect “Business Information,\" including customer ID number and product version, type, and serial number. This is collected so that we can authorize your access, provide you with the appropriate update, and to update our records as to the product and products updates you have downloaded or installed, so that we may provide the appropriate support.\n\n• Account Set-Up and Access: Upon subscribing to our services, The Company collects Business Information, which may include information such as product serial number, customer ID, and your customer profile information. This allows us to identify you to authorize your access and use of the services, and to provide you with your relevant account information. Certain products allow you to access your account to obtain information such as your support plan status, service subscriptions, registrations, and order history.\n\n• Online Product /Account Application: Certain products and services are subject to an application and enrollment process, which may be completed on paper or online. Information requested may include federal ID numbers, bank account, payroll, credit card, and contact information. This information is used to process your enrollment request and, if approved, to set up and administer your account.\n\n• Web-based Services: Some of our web-based Services collect certain additional information, including IP address, browser, connection speed, domain, referring URL, and other environment-related information. This enables us to provide a secure environment for the use of the services to pre-populate forms and calculate aggregate statistical information about the customers using these services. We use this information to better protect you and to provide a better user experience.\n\nSupport. We offer certain support services. If you access our support services, you may be asked for information such as customer ID, product name, product version, and other information to help us determine what the technical issues are and how best to help you resolve them. In addition, certain products allow you to submit support-related questions directly from the product. If you access online support services from a product, information about your network, operating system, and other similar information will be automatically pre-populated for submission to our customer support representatives to assist them in answering your questions.\n\nThird-Party Products. The Company may use your business information to inform you of special discounts or offers from other companies we have carefully selected and whose products and services may be of interest to you.\n\nPublic Forums. Information (including personal and business information) that you submit, post, or otherwise reveal in a public forum (such as comments to a blog or product discussion forum) is not subject to this Privacy Policy, will be seen by third parties not related to The Company, and may be used by them or The Company to contact you for any purpose.\n\nRegistrations. To access information (blogs, demos of our products, marketing materials etc.) on the Websites, a user may be required to register with The Company. During registration, a user is required to give certain information (such as name, email address, job title). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our Website in which you have expressed interest.\n\nOrders. We request information from you on our order forms. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). All payment data is stored by our payment processors, and you should review their Privacy Policies and contact the payment processor directly to respond to your questions. The Company uses this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.\n\nSurveys and Contests. From time to time, our Websites may request information via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes, if applicable. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Websites.\n\nEmail and Text Communication. Each email and/or text we send will contain instructions on how to unsubscribe should you decide not to receive future promotional communication. If you choose to opt out of receiving promotional email and/or text communications from The Company, we may still periodically communicate with you via email, mail, and telephone for non-promotional matters. Please allow up to 10 business days to be removed from our promotional communication list.\n\nWe send notification emails about the Website and Services from time to time as necessary. Generally, you may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.\n\nThird-Party Email Promotions. If you access and/or use any of our third-party provider's (our Partners) services from a link on our Websites, a The Company/Partner co-branded site or by any other means, any information you reveal in connection with such service is submitted to our Partner and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. You should consult the privacy policy of any Partners or third-party site with respect to its treatment of any information that you may reveal through such service.\n\nServices and Product Data. Business information collected by The Company does not include your company's data entered in the course of operating our products (“Product Data“) or data provided by you while using our services (“Services Data“). The Company will not access your Product Data or Services Data except in the following limited circumstances:\n\n• To provide you with technical support, solely at your request and with your permission\n\n• On a limited-access basis to install updates, produce regular backups or restore data from backups at your request\n\n• Where the inherent purpose of the product or service requires The Company to provide the Product Data or Services Data to a third party on your behalf (for example where The Company makes tax filings on your behalf or initiates bank transfers on your behalf)\n\n• To utilize Aggregate Information derived from Product Data and Services Data to help us improve our products and services and in developing additional offerings. Aggregate Information is non-identifying information about you that is provided to third parties for analysis. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of this Website and the activities they conduct while on this Website to better understand the user experience. Third-parties who receive aggregate information cannot identify or contact you based on the information they receive\n\nThe Company will not provide your Product Data or Services Data to any third party or permit any third party to access your Product Data or Services Data, except with your permission or to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order. In addition, if at any time you decide to discontinue your use of the applicable service, your Services Data will be destroyed and removed from all servers according to terms set forth in your Customer Agreement, subject to applicable backup and disaster recovery practices and procedures.\n\nEmployment Applications and Talent Management. As part of our recruitment and talent management process, we collect personal information with respect to individuals who are interested in working for us. In this context, we collect employment and application data, such as the following: contact information (e.g., name, title, residential or postal address, telephone number, and personal email address); information in a curriculum vitae, resumé, cover letter, or similar documentation; details regarding the type of employment sought, willingness to relocate, job compensation and benefit preferences; health data (e.g., medical conditions); information related to your background, education, criminal record, credit history, and similar data; information provided about or by your references or other third parties related to your employment history, skills, qualifications, or education; and, information related to previous applications to us or previous employment history with us. When permitted by law, we may collect information about your race and ethnicity to assist with our diversity and inclusion programs. We use this information for the following purposes: to identify and evaluate job applicants; to verify your information; to complete employment, education, background, and reference checks; to communicate with you about the recruitment process and your application; to comply with our legal, judicial, regulatory, administrative, or other corporate requirements; to analyze and improve our application and recruitment process; to accommodate individuals who may have specialized needs during the employment process; and to protect the rights, interests, and property of our business, other job applicants, employees, or the public, as required, or permitted, by law.\n\nCookies. The Company may place “cookies” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies may enhance the convenience and use of the Websites. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits but doing so may affect your ability to access or use certain features of the Website.\n\nThe Company may also utilize web beacons on our Websites. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. The information collected through these automated means may include information that we gather and store about your visit to, and use of, the Websites, such as your IP address, type of browser and operating system used, date and time you access the websites, pages you visit, and, if you linked to the Websites from another website, the address of that website. This data does not include Personal Information and is not treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, but it may include the IP address of your device. We may link an IP address to information that is personally identifiable.\n\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable this function so that your browser will not accept cookies. Please be aware that disabling this function may impact your use and enjoyment of this Website.\n\nThird-Party Analytics. We may also allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include cookies and web beacons within the pages of the Websites on our behalf and to retain and use the information received from such cookies and web beacons themselves. Third-party service providers that collect this data on our behalf may offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt out on their respective websites which you can access here: http://www.google.com/analytics/.\n\nDo Not Track. Currently, various browsers — including Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.\n\nHow Long We Keep Your Data\n\nWe may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use our Websites or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\n\nHow We Protect Your Data\n\nWe take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Websites, your information is protected both online and offline. We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your data both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, store, and the current state of technology. Please note, though, that no website or internet transmission is completely secure, so while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.\n\nHow We Share Data\n\nUnless you give us your permission, we don't share data we collect from you with third parties, except as described below:\n\nThird-party service providers or consultants. We may share data collected from you on The Company Websites with third-party service providers or consultants who need access to the data to perform their work on The Company' behalf. These third-party service providers are limited to only accessing or using this data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances that they will appropriately safeguard the data.\n\nCompliance with Laws. We may disclose your data to a third party if (i) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of the The Company Site or our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.\n\nIf The Company is required by law to disclose any of your data that directly identifies you, then we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of that disclosure requirement, unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order. Further, we object to requests that we do not believe were issued properly.\n\nBusiness transfers. If we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, data we gather from you through our website may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with due diligence for any such transaction. Any acquirer or successor of The Company may continue to use the data we collect from you through our Websites as described in this notice.\n\nAggregated or de-identified data. We might also share data collected from you from The Company Websites with a third party if that data has been de-identified or aggregated in a way that does not directly identify you.\n\nWe do not share your data (including, but not limited to, the personal data of your end users) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless you give us your consent to do so.\n\nEmployers - Career Center Solutions. An Employer, in our Career Center Solution, is a recruiter, company representative, agency, or another individual who has contracts with The Company and is interested in contacting potential candidates, or job-seekers, for job openings. Relevant job-seeker resumes are provided to Employers, who may use that resume information to contact the job-seeker. This information is only made available to employers with the consent of the job-seeker. The Company does not share your data (including, but not limited to, the personal data of your end users) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless you give us your consent to do so.\n\nCross-Border Transfers of Data\n\nThe Company' headquarters are in the United States and as such, data may be transferred to the United States from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, or another country that requires legal protections for international data transfer.
