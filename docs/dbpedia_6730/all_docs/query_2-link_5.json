        "text": "1. Services.\n\n(a) AND/OR AVH will use commercially reasonable efforts during the Service Term to provide Customer the Services identified on Customer’s order form, invoice, etc. As part of the Services, and/or AVH grants Customer the right to use the Services on Customer’s website or other appropriate methods and mediums during the Service Term.\n\n(b) The Services will be provided to Customer through AND/OR AVH’s methods including, but not limited to, AND/OR AVH’s website and dashboard, integrations utilizing API keys, webhooks, ADF feed, etc. and Customer must register and identify a username and password. The customer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or services necessary to use the Services and for maintaining the security of such equipment, services, and Customer’s username and password. Customer is responsible for all use of its username and password.\n\n(c) Customer may only use the Services for its internal business purposes and may only disclose the Services to third parties to enable those parties to provide services to Customer. Such internal business purposes may include, but are not limited to, email marketing, direct mail, SMS marketing, and social media marketing in accordance with all local and federal laws.\n\n2. Proprietary Rights.\n\n(a) Customer shall not, directly, or indirectly reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to the Services or any software, documentation, or data related thereto or create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices of labels from, any of the foregoing. AND/OR AVH shall own and retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, and Software, and all improvements, enhancements, or modifications thereto, and all intellectual property rights related to any of the foregoing.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH may collect and analyze data relating to Customer’s use of the Services and will be free to use such data for its internal business purposes and to disclose such data in de-identified form in connection with its business. AND/OR AVH shall not disclose to third parties the aggregated Services in a form, which is attributable to Customer.\n\n(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party when it has knowledge of a breach that may compromise the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any third parties’ personally-identifying information that relates to the Services and shall cooperate with law enforcement with respect to such breach and shall take appropriate action to mitigate the breach at its expense.\n\n(d) Customer shall not export the Services from the United States except in compliance with applicable law and with the prior written approval by AND/OR AVH.\n\n3. Payment of Fees.\n\n(a) Customer shall pay AND/OR AVH the fees described in the Order Form, invoice, etc. in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”) for services being rendered. Customer authorizes AND/OR AVH to charge the credit card and/or alternate electronic form of approved payment for services. Full payment for services is due upon receipt (Late payment terms and time frames are covered on each invoice). Unpaid amounts may be subject to a finance charge of 7.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and may result in immediate termination of Service.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH may change the Fees or applicable charges, or may institute new Fees or charges, by giving Customer written notice 90 days in advance. If Customer believes that AND/OR AVH has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact AND/OR AVH no later than 30 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to AND/OR AVH’s accounting department at accounting@accelerateventureholdings.com. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on AND/OR AVH’s net income.\n\n(c) Customer agrees and understands that the charges on a credit card or for any check for the Services are irrevocable, undisputable and may not be charged back, contested, or challenged now or in the future. Doing so is a material breach of this agreement for which AND/OR AVH would be entitled to attorney fees, costs, and fees associated with addressing a chargeback in addition to the amount challenged. Should Customer not pay the amount submitted to by AND/OR AVH for the cost of the chargeback within 30 days after AND/OR AVH has submitted its amount of cost due to Customer contesting a charge, the charges will be turned over to a collection agency. AND/OR AVH shall have at its sole disposal any other legal remedy it independently chooses to pursue any collection against Customer for the cost of the chargeback. Customer further agrees that proof of purchase by AND/OR AVH is all that is necessary to establish to the credit card agency or banking institution to deny a chargeback to Customer.\n\n4. Term and Termination.\n\n(a) AND/OR AVH will provide the Services beginning on the Service Start Date which will endure for a minimum of three-monthly billing cycles (“90-day Minimum Commitment\") and then continue on a month-to-month basis (the “Service Term”) until written notice of termination is given by either party.\n\n(b) Either party may terminate the Services by giving written notice of termination to the other party; such termination (“30-day Opt-out\") will be effective at the end of the next full calendar month of Service.\n\n5. Representations and Warranties.\n\n(a) Each party represents and warrants to the other party that it has complied and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Services, including without limitation SAN Registration https://telemarketing.donotcall.gov/profile/create.aspx, CAN-SPAM, the TCPA, and the FTC’s TSR.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH represents and warrants to Customer that it will use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in a manner which minimizes errors and interruptions and shall perform any installation or training services in a professional and workmanlike manner and neither the Services will contain any viruses, malware, or other disabling code installed or inserted by AND/OR AVH.\n\n(c) The express warranties set forth in these Terms of Service are the only warranties made. All other warranties, express or implied, including without limitation warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed. All Services are provided “as-is” with no warranties whatsoever.\n\n6. Confidentiality.\n\nCustomer shall not use or disclose to any third party any of AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. AND/OR AVH’s confidential information includes non-public information identified by AND/OR AVH as confidential or proprietary or which should reasonably be understood by Customer to be confidential or proprietary based on the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure. Non-public aspects of the Services are AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. Upon termination of the Service Term, Customer shall promptly return or certify to the destruction of all AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. Customer may disclose AND/OR AVH’s confidential information if required by law if Customer gives notice to AND/OR AVH prior to such disclosure and assists AND/OR AVH in limiting the disclosure.\n\n7. Indemnification.\n\nEach party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its directors, officers, contractors, employees, agents, and consultants (the “Indemnified Group”), from and against any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, liabilities, damages, losses, judgments, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, made or claimed by a third party arising out of or related to: (i) the Indemnifying Party’s the breach of these Terms of Service, including of any representations and warranties made herein; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party’s violation of any rights of any third party or the Indemnified Group that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Service.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability.\n\nNeither party shall be liable for any consequential, indirect, exemplary, special, or incidental damages, or for damages for lost profits, arising out of or related to these Terms of Service, however caused and regardless of the theory of liability (including without limitation negligence), even if the party has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Each party’s liability arising out of or related to these Terms of Service shall not exceed and is limited to the total amount of Fees paid by Customer in the 12-month period immediately before the event giving rise to liability. This Section 8 shall not apply to a party’s breach of Section 2(A), 6, to the payment of Fees when due, or to a party’s indemnification obligations herein.\n\n9. General.\n\n(a) All notices given under these Terms of Service shall be in writing and will be effective when received by the party to whom directed. All notices shall be delivered by hand or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the party’s address on the Order Form, or sent by email, with confirmation of receipt, addressed to the party’s email address on the Order Form. A party may update its notice address by giving notice to the other party.\n\n(b) These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of laws principles. An action brought by either party under these Terms of Service shall be brought only to a state or federal court located in Collin County, Texas. Each party submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection to such courts. AND/OR AVH may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party hereby waives any right it has or may have to a jury trial in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.\n\n(c) The breach or threatened breach by the Customer of these Terms of Service would be highly prejudicial to the interest of AND/OR AVH and would materially damage AND/OR AVH. Therefore, AND/OR AVH will be presumed entitled to injunctive relief, including specific performance, to remedy or prevent such breach or threatened breach, without the obligation to post a bond and in addition to any other remedy that may be available at law or equity.\n\n(d) No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created because of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service and the Order Form state the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersede all previous discussions, negotiations, and agreements. The failure of any party to insist upon the performance of any provision of these Terms of Service or to exercise any right or privilege granted to such party under these Terms of Service will not be construed as waiving such provision or any other provision hereof. Neither party may assign these Terms of Service without the written consent of the other party; provided, that either party may assign these Terms of Service without the other party’s consent(i) to the acquirer in connection with the sale, transfer, or other disposition by such party of all or substantially all of its assets or to the surviving or resulting entity in a merger or reorganization. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties intend that the provision be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under law and therefore request that the court reform the invalid or unenforceable provision to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted; if the court refuses to modify or reform the provision, then the provision shall be severed from these Terms of Service with no effect upon the remaining provisions. Any amendment or addition to these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by both Parties.\n\nTextDrive is committed to protecting the privacy of the data relating to our users, and their clients.

Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.\n\nThis page provides the terms and conditions (these “Terms of Service”) that govern the use of, including but not limited to, services, products, software, and technologies (the “Services”) offered by TextDrive and/or Accelerate Venture Holdings, LLC, a Texas corporation, and its subsidiaries (“ and/or AVH”). By using the Services, you/your company (the “Customer”) agrees to these Terms.\n\n1. Services.\n\n(a) AND/OR AVH will use commercially reasonable efforts during the Service Term to provide Customer the Services identified on Customer’s order form, invoice, etc. As part of the Services, and/or AVH grants Customer the right to use the Services on Customer’s website or other appropriate methods and mediums during the Service Term.\n\n(b) The Services will be provided to Customer through AND/OR AVH’s methods including but not limited to AND/OR AVH’s website and dashboard, integrations utilizing API keys, webhooks, ADF feed, etc. and Customer must register and identify a username and password. The customer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or services necessary to use the Services and for maintaining the security of such equipment, services, and Customer’s username and password. Customer is responsible for all use of its username and password.\n\n(c) Customer may only use the Services for its internal business purposes and may only disclose the Services to third parties to enable those parties to provide services to Customer. Such internal business purposes may include, but not limited to, email marketing, direct mail, SMS marketing, and social media marketing in accordance with all local and federal laws.\n\n2. Proprietary Rights.\n\n(a) Customer shall not, directly, or indirectly reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, know-how, or algorithms relevant to the Services or any software, documentation, or data related thereto or create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices of labels from, any of the foregoing. AND/OR AVH shall own and retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, and Software, and all improvements, enhancements, or modifications thereto, and all intellectual property rights related to any of the foregoing.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH may collect and analyze data relating to Customer’s use of the Services and will be free to use such data for its internal business purposes and to disclose such data in de-identified form in connection with its business. AND/OR AVH shall not disclose to third parties the aggregated Services in a form that is attributable to Customer.\n\n(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party when it has knowledge of a breach that may compromise the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any third parties’ personally identifying information that relates to the Services and shall cooperate with law enforcement with respect to such breach and shall take appropriate action to mitigate the breach at its expense.\n\n(d) Customer shall not export the Services from the United States except in compliance with applicable law and with the prior written approval by AND/OR AVH.\n\n3. Payment of Fees.\n\n(a) Customer shall pay AND/OR AVH the fees described in the Order Form, invoice, etc. in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”) for services being rendered. Customer authorizes AND/OR AVH to charge the credit card and/or alternate electronic form of approved payment for services. Full payment for services is due upon receipt (Late payment terms and time frames are covered on each invoice). Unpaid amounts may be subject to a finance charge of 7.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and may result in immediate termination of Service.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH may change the Fees or applicable charges, or may institute new Fees or charges, by giving Customer written notice 90 days in advance. If Customer believes that AND/OR AVH has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact AND/OR AVH no later than 30 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to AND/OR AVH’s accounting department at accounting@accelerateventureholdings.com. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on AND/OR AVH’s net income.\n\n(c) Customer agrees and understands that the charges on a credit card or for any check for the Services are irrevocable, undisputable, and may not be charged back, contested, or challenged now or in the future. Doing so is a material breach of this agreement for which AND/OR AVH would be entitled to attorney fees, costs, and fees associated with addressing a chargeback in addition to the amount challenged. Should Customer not pay the amount submitted to by AND/OR AVH for the cost of the chargeback within 30 days after AND/OR AVH has submitted its amount of cost due to Customer contesting a charge, the charges will be turned over to a collection agency. AND/OR AVH shall have at its sole disposal any other legal remedy it independently chooses to pursue any collection against Customer for the cost of the chargeback. Customer further agrees that proof of purchase by AND/OR AVH is all that is necessary to establish to the credit card agency or banking institution to deny a chargeback to Customer.\n\n4. Term and Termination.\n\n(a) AND/OR AVH will provide the Services beginning on the Service Start Date which will endure for a minimum of three-monthly billing cycles (“90-day Minimum Commitment\") and then continue a month-to-month basis (the “Service Term”) until written notice of termination is given by either party.\n\n(b) Either party may terminate the Services by giving written notice of termination to the other party; such termination (“30-day Opt-out\") will be effective at the end of the next full calendar month of Service.\n\n5. Representations and Warranties.\n\n(a) Each party represents and warrants to the other party that it has complied and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Services, including without limitation SAN Registration https://telemarketing.donotcall.gov/profile/create.aspx, CAN-SPAM, the TCPA, and the FTC’s TSR.\n\n(b) AND/OR AVH represents and warrants to Customer that it will use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in a manner that minimizes errors and interruptions and shall perform any installation or training services in a professional and workmanlike manner and neither the Services will contain any viruses, malware, or other disabling code installed or inserted by AND/OR AVH.\n\n(c) The express warranties set forth in these Terms of Service are the only warranties made. All other warranties, express or implied, including without limitation warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed. All Services are provided “as-is” with no warranties whatsoever.\n\n6. Confidentiality.\n\nCustomer shall not use or disclose to any third party any of AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. AND/OR AVH’s confidential information includes non-public information identified by AND/OR AVH as confidential or proprietary or which should reasonably be understood by Customer to be confidential or proprietary based on the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure. Non-public aspects of the Services are AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. Upon termination of the Service Term, Customer shall promptly return or certify to the destruction of all AND/OR AVH’s confidential information. Customer may disclose AND/OR AVH’s confidential information if required by law if Customer gives notice to AND/OR AVH prior to such disclosure and assists AND/OR AVH in limiting the disclosure.\n\n7. Indemnification.\n\nEach party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its directors, officers, contractors, employees, agents, and consultants (the “Indemnified Group”), from and against any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, liabilities, damages, losses, judgments, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, made or claimed by a third party arising out of or related to: (i) the Indemnifying Party’s the breach of these Terms of Service, including of any representations and warranties made herein; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party’s violation of any rights of any third party or the Indemnified Group that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Service.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability.\n\nNeither party shall be liable for any consequential, indirect, exemplary, special, or incidental damages, or for damages for lost profits, arising out of or related to these Terms of Service, however caused and regardless of the theory of liability (including without limitation negligence), even if the party has been advised of the possibility of such damage. Each party’s liability arising out of or related to these Terms of Service shall not exceed and is limited to the total amount of Fees paid by Customer in the 12-month period immediately before the event giving rise to liability. This Section 8 shall not apply to a party’s breach of Section 2(A), 6, to the payment of Fees when due, or to a party’s indemnification obligations herein.\n\n9. General.\n\n(a) All notices given under these Terms of Service shall be in writing and will be effective when received by the party to whom directed. All notices shall be delivered by hand or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the party’s address on the Order Form, or sent by email, with confirmation of receipt, addressed to the party’s email address on the Order Form. A party may update its notice address by giving notice to the other party.\n\n(b) These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of laws principles. An action brought by either party under these Terms of Service shall be brought only to a state or federal court located in Collin County, Texas. Each party submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection to such courts. AND/OR AVH may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party hereby waives any right it has or may have to a jury trial in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.\n\n(c) The breach or threatened breach by the Customer of these Terms of Service would be highly prejudicial to the interest of AND/OR AVH and would materially damage AND/OR AVH. Therefore, AND/OR AVH will be presumed entitled to injunctive relief, including specific performance, to remedy or prevent such breach or threatened breach, without the obligation to post a bond and in addition to any other remedy that may be available at law or equity.\n\n(d) No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created because of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service and the Order Form state the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersede all previous discussions, negotiations, and agreements. The failure of any party to insist upon the performance of any provision of these Terms of Service or to exercise any right or privilege granted to such party under these Terms of Service will not be construed as waiving such provision or any other provision hereof. Neither party may assign these Terms of Service without the written consent of the other party; provided, that either party may assign these Terms of Service without the other party’s consent(i) to the acquirer in connection with the sale, transfer, or other disposition by such party of all or substantially all of its assets or to the surviving or resulting entity in a merger or reorganization. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties intend that the provision be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under law and therefore request that the court reform the invalid or unenforceable provision to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted; if the court refuses to modify or reform the provision, then the provision shall be severed from these Terms of Service with no effect upon the remaining provisions. Any amendment or addition to these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by both Parties.\n\nAccount Terms & Conditions\n\nTextDrive is committed to protecting the privacy of the data relating to our users, and their clients.
