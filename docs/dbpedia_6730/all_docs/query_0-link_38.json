I haven't needed to customize more than it offers, and it offers CSS, so that's... quite a bit. I haven't even touched that, though; still letting other people (some LJ-official, but mine currently just another user's who wanted to create a style) do the CSS work for me.\n\nYou might also look at Moveable Type (http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/), or services such as TextDrive's (http://www.textdrive.com/) which offer you Moveable Type and enough freedom anyway to do whatever you'd like.\n\nReally, though, LiveJournal is nice -- especially when you start to find more communities and other users of more interest, since your own account there facilitates that kind of growth.\n\nI've heard of other kind services: myspace, xanga.\n\nI've been very happy with WordPress since I started using it, but I'm not really sure where to begin recommending it because I don't really understand it -- it's been a lot of trial and error setting it up! I'm pretty handy with HTML but their codex and using PHP taxed my resources -- still, I needed it to do a few semi-complicated things and I always found the right plug-in. So... with a bit of know-how, time and patience, I think WordPress is wonderful."
