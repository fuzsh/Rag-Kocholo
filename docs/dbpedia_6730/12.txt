I spent some time with Georg's Django/lighttpd/FCGI instructions, got

Django running under my TextDrive account, and then wrote up some

(hopefully) easy-to-follow instructions which are now online:

http://manuals.textdrive.com/read/book/15

Suggestions and corrections are welcome.

Thanks a lot James - that's some really well written documentation:

clear, succinct and informative.

Just one tiny suggestion (I don't use TextDrive so I can't comment on

much). You suggest downloading Django like this:

curl http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/0.90/Django-0.90.tar.gz -

o Django-0.90.tar.gz

You can simplify that using the -O argument to curl (that's a capital

O), which tells it to use the same filename when saving to disk:

curl -O http://media.djangoproject.com/releases/0.90/Django-0.90.tar.gz

Cheers,

Simon

Good call. I don't know much of curl's command-line options, being

used to wget,but for a while wget wasn't available on TXD's shared

servers; I think now it is, and I'll probably just update to use that

instead.

Nicely done, James! This is great stuff.

One suggestion: The writeup should encourage people to chown their

settings file so that it's only readable by their own user account and

the Web server, as a security precaution. I apologize in advance if

you did indeed mentioned this, but I didn't see it during my cursory

read.
