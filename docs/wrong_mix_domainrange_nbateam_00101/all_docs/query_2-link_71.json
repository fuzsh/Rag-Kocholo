        "text": "The anticipation for the 2003 NBA Draft was unlike any other since perhaps the Victor Wembanyama draft of 2023, and for good reason. Scouts already knew that LeBron James had the potential to change the game back when he was a high school student at St. Vincent-St. Mary.\n\nJames was far from the only star in this draft, though. Two current Hall of Famers and two surefire future ones were taken within the first five picks. Nine players made at least one All-Star game. It also featured one of the all-time worst picks — Darko Milicic, taken second by the Pistons.\n\nThe Pistons and other teams will have a chance to rectify their mistakes in our redraft. Two of our writers — Stephen Noh and Scott Rafferty — put on their GM hats and decided what the order of players selected would look like today.\n\nMORE: Nikola Jokic rises from No. 41 to No. 1 in 2014 redraft\n\nRedrafting the 2003 NBA Draft\n\n1. LeBron James, Cavaliers\n\nOriginal pick: LeBron James\n\nLeBron would be the undisputed first pick in any draft class, save maybe 1984 with Michael Jordan. This was a no-brainer first pick 20 years ago, and it remains the same today. — Noh\n\n2. Dwyane Wade, Pistons\n\nOriginal pick: Darko Milicic\n\nWade's original draft position: 5th (Heat)\n\nAnother relatively easy decision. Incredible of a career as Carmelo Anthony had, Wade was the best player on a championship team. He was then the second-best player on two more championship teams. He was a dominant scorer despite being a 6-foot-4 guard without much of a 3-point shot, and he was a dynamite defender at his peak. There's a reason he's remembered as the best shot-blocking guard in NBA history. — Rafferty\n\nMORE: Why Joel Embiid won SN's Player of the Year in 2023\n\n3. Carmelo Anthony, Nuggets\n\nOriginal pick: Carmelo Anthony\n\nMelo may not have ever won a ring, but he will go down as one of the all-time greatest scorers ever. His 28,289 career points ranks ninth in league history, and he led the league with 28.7 points per game back in the 2012-13 NBA season.\n\nMelo racked up the awards during his 19-year career. He was named to 10 All-Star teams and six All-NBA teams. After announcing his retirement in 2023, he will be a surefire entrant into the Hall of Fame as soon as he is eligible. — Noh\n\n4. Chris Bosh, Raptors\n\nOriginal pick: Chris Bosh\n\nIt's easy to forget how dominant Bosh was before he joined forces with James and Wade in Miami. And while he became the third option on the Heat, they don't go back-to-back without him. His shooting ability provided important spacing and he became a dynamic defender. It's a shame his career was cut short because it looked like he had a few more All-Star seasons in him. — Rafferty\n\n5. David West, Heat\n\nOriginal pick: Dwyane Wade\n\nWest's original draft position: 18th (Hornets)\n\nWest was a two-time All-Star, averaging 20.8 points and 8.7 rebounds during that stretch. He was a tough, no-nonsense forward with a good midrange shot and great power post moves that kept him in the league for 15 years. He was also a great locker room presence and a winner, ending his career on a high note with two championships. — Noh\n\n6. Kyle Korver, Clippers\n\nOriginal pick: Chris Kaman\n\nKorver's original draft position: 51st (Nets)\n\nThere's no question that Korver is one of the greatest shooters in NBA history. Not only does he rank fifth all-time in 3-pointers made, but he ranks 10th all-time in 3-point percentage. He once scored 11 points in one minute. There wasn't much that could be done when he caught fire. — Rafferty\n\nMORE: Redrafting 2016 with Jaylen Brown, Jamal Murray and more\n\n7. Boris Diaw, Bulls\n\nOriginal pick: Kirk Hinrich\n\nDiaw's original draft position: 21st (Hawks)\n\nDiaw played in the wrong era of basketball. A 6-foot-8, 250-pound big body with great passing chops and incredible defensive versatility, Diaw paved the way for players who are hybrids of multiple positions. He could do a little bit of everything on the floor, and he was a big part of the Spurs dynasty with his high skill level. — Noh\n\n8. Mo Williams, Bucks\n\nOriginal pick: T.J. Ford\n\nWilliams' original draft position: 47th (Jazz)\n\nWilliams is one of nine players from the 2003 NBA Draft to earn an All-Star selection. He proved to be a solid No. 2 next to James in Cleveland, peaking in 2008-09 with an average of 17.8 points per game, though he did have a 50-point game later in his career. — Rafferty\n\n9. Leandro Barbosa, Knicks\n\nOriginal pick: Michael Sweetney\n\nBarbosa's original draft position: 28th (Spurs, traded to Suns)\n\nThe Brazilian Blur was a high-energy speedster off the bench that could light up crowds with his scoring. Nobody could stay in front of Barbosa in transition, and his 38.7 percent from 3 over the course of his career made him a supremely difficult cover. — Noh\n\n10. Josh Howard, Wizards\n\nOriginal pick: Jarvis Hayes\n\nHoward's original draft position: 29th (Mavericks)\n\nHoward fell off rather quickly, but he was one of the better wings in the league for a couple of seasons — a strong two-way player who could get you around 20 points while still wreaking havoc defensively. — Rafferty\n\n11. Kirk Hinrich, Warriors\n\nOriginal pick: Mickael Pietrus\n\nHinrich's original draft position: 7th (Bulls)\n\nHinrich was a tough-as-nails defender and a heady point guard who would always make the right pass. Earlier in his career, before injuries began to take a toll on his body, he was a pretty good athlete too. A solid jump-shooter that hit 37.5 percent of his 3-pointers for his career, Hinrich would have fit perfectly in the Warriors' system. — Noh\n\n12. Jose Calderon, Sonics\n\nOriginal pick: Nick Collison\n\nCalderon's original draft position: Undrafted\n\nCalderson put together a long NBA career after going undrafted in 2003. He became a dependable point guard who was always in control and could shoot the lights out. He was a starter for most of his NBA career, but he would've complemented Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Kevin Durant nicely on the Thunder thanks to his ability to play on and off the ball. — Rafferty\n\n13. Nick Collison, Grizzlies\n\nOriginal pick: Marcus Banks\n\nCollison's original draft position: 12th (Sonics)\n\nCollison didn't have a fantastic playing career, but he was known as one of the best locker room guys and leaders in the league. That helped him last 14 years in the league despite mediocre averages of 5.9 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. A big body at 6-foot-10, Collison gave teams solid interior defense and mistake-free play. — Noh\n\n14. Chris Kaman, Sonics\n\nOriginal pick: Luke Ridnour\n\nKaman's original draft position: 6th (Clippers)\n\nKaman might be best known for the picture of him laying on the bench, but he had a good run for the Clippers that saw him earn an All-Star selection in 2009-10 with averages of 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game. He was a pretty reliable post scorer who could knock down midrange jumpers. — Rafferty"
