        "text": "The next NBA season looks promising. I’d like to see Lebron and Kobe face off, that’d be cool. im also glad Kirk Hinrich made it, he’s probably going to become one of the best white guys in the league. (not foreign)\n\nI can’t wait to see Lebron play this season.\n\ni can’t believe my washington wizards got 10th overall pick. they shouldn’t even be able to, they’re probably going to lose most of their games anyway.\n\nI’ve lost all hope on all my home teams. none of them ever make it through playoffs\n\nthat’s another thing i was concerned about with him. he’s used to playing with high school students. what made him stand out was that he was better than other high school students. who’s to say he’s up to par with NBA players? how do we know Ohio simply didn’t have any good high school basketball teams?\n\nwe’ll all find out come NBA season.\n\nit will probably take him a few years to develop into one of the better NBA players, but i think he’s going to be really good once he matures to the NBA level.\n\ni was watching somethign and they were saying how its better for them to get college players cause they teach them on a higher level better and more mature fundamentals, oens that you cant get in HS and the NBA doesnt have tiem to teach you\n\nHe should have gone to college for at least 1 maybe 2 years like Carmello Anthony. then he’d be alot more prepared for the nba than he is now.\n\ni’m sure Lebron’s mindset is like “I have nothing to worry about, i have a career now, therefore why go to college?” not knowing him right off the bat, i can’t verify.\n\nthe NBA should set regulations on the players they sign, like a minimum number of years of college education. i wonder if he does go to college if he’ll play for that school’s team. it would make one hell of an NCAA tourney.\n\n*Originally posted by thoriphes *\n\n**i sure as hell wouldn’t **\n\nnot after that i wouldnt either, but i would have before the NBA. Just for a “Fall back” job, sports are rough, and if you are a damaged package and new to the sport, you better have something to fall back on :trout:\n\nhaha…i don’t think lebron will ever have to worry about a “Fall Back” job…with the 90 million dollar deal\n\nin fact, i don’t think many nba players will have to worry about a “Fall Back” job…the minimum is like .5 million for normal players and 1 million for veterans…that’s a lot of money!\n\n-teet"
