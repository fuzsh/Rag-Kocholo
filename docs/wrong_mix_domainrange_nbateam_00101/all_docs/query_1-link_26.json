        "text": "Published Jul. 7, 2013 7:56 p.m. ET\n\nfoxsports\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are bringing another familiar face back to town.\n\nFree-agent small forward Carlos Delfino and the Bucks have agreed to a two-year, $6.5 million contract including a team option for a third year that could make the deal worth $9.75 million, a league source confirmed Sunday evening.\n\nDelfino, 30, spent last season with the Houston Rockets, averaging 10.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game while shooting 40.5 percent from the field and 37.5 percent on 3-pointers.\n\nThe Rockets released Delfino and point guard Aaron Brooks last week to clear salary cap space to agree to a contract with free-agent center Dwight Howard.\n\nA first-round pick of the Detroit Pistons in 2003, Delfino came over to the United States in 2004. The Argentinian spent three seasons with the Pistons before being traded to Toronto for two second-round draft picks.\n\nAfter one season in Toronto, Delfino spent the 2008-09 season with Khimki Moscow in the Russian Super League. Delfino returned to the United States when he was traded by Toronto to the Bucks with Roko Ukic for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems in the summer of 2009.\n\nDelfino averaged 11.0 and 11.5 points per game in his first two seasons with the Bucks, shooting 40.8 percent and 39.0 percent from beyond the arc. Delfino was limited to just 49 games in his second season with the Bucks due to a severe concussion.\n\nAfter averaging 9.0 points and 3.9 rebounds per game in 2011-12 with the Bucks, Delfino signed with Houston last offseason.\n\nThe veteran is a 3-point specialist and is a good perimeter defender. His presence in the locker room was lauded last season in Houston, and he'll bring leadership to this year's Bucks team. With Mike Dunleavy agreeing to a contract with Chicago, Delfino will add depth at small forward for the Bucks, joining Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and first-round pick Giannis Antetokoumpo.\n\nDelfino is the third free agent the Bucks have agreed to a contract with, joining shooting guard O.J. Mayo and center Zaza Pachulia. All three can't officially sign their contracts until the league moratorium ends July 10.\n\nFollow Andrew Gruman on Twitter"
