        "text": "Ryan Hawkins could be about to join Stade Rochelais for next season’s Betclic ÉLITE.\n\nAfter an excellent season in Italy with Pistoia, where he averaged 9.4 points with 43% success, 3.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game, Hawkins seems ready for a new challenge in France.\n\nSource: BeBasket\n\nChimezie Metu has reached an agreement with Barcelona, as reported by Evan Sidery of Forbes Sports.\n\nMetu, six years in the NBA, has already signed a contract with the Catalan club, although the details of the deal were not specified. Selected with the number 49 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by the San Antonio Spurs, Metu has played for the Spurs, Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Detroit Pistons.\n\nHapoel Holon announced the arrival of Marcus Bingham for the upcoming season.\n\nThe Michigan State product spent last year with Hapoel Haifa, averaging 14.5 points (52% FG, 67% FT), 8.1 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game in Winner League.\n\nJeffrey Carroll is a new player of BM Stal Ostrow, as announced by the Polish club.\n\nThe forward spent 2023/24 in Germany with MLP Academics Heidelberg, scoring 13.3 points with 3.3 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game.\n\nDanilo Andjusic is a new player of BC Dubai, as announced by his agent.\n\nThe 33-year-old Serbian shooting guard spent the last two seasons with Partizan (7.1 points with 41% from three in 2023/24).\n\nTwo days ago the club that will participate in the upcoming Aba Liga also announced the signing of Awudu Abass.\n\nShannon Shorter will continue to wear the KK Split jersey for the 2024/25 season, the Croatian club announced.\n\nThe point guard will thus begin his fourth season with Split, a rarity for a U.S. player.\n\nLast year Shorter produced 14.9 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game.\n\nIsaiah Reese is a new player of Merkezefendi, as announced by the Turkish club.\n\nThe guard comes from an excellent year in the VTB League with Parma Basket Perm, where he produced averages of 14.5 points, 5.7 assists and 1.9 steals per game.\n\nFabien Causeur, after seven successful seasons at Real Madrid, is now in the details with Olimpia Milano.\n\nThe Frenchman, born in 1987, is known for his experience and versatility, having won 2 EuroLeagues, 4 ACB and other important titles.\n\nDonta Hall signs with Baskonia as reported Gabriel Pantel-Jouve.\n\nFormer Monaco agreed a two-year contract.\n\nHall averaged 4.9 points, 3.5 rebounds last season with Monaco in EuroLeague.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his farewell to Barcelona, Rokas Jokubaitis has reached an agreement on a two-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv, with an option for a third season. Jokubaitis, 23, is expected to succeed Lorenzo Brown.\n\nWith six years of experience in the Euroleague between Zalgiris Kaunas and Barcelona, he averaged 5.3 points and 2.7 assists per game last season.\n\nIn addition to Jokubaitis, Roman Sorkin has signed a five-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv, confirming his return after attempting to get a contract in the NBA.\n\nFonte: Walla\n\nPolski Cukier Start Lublin has signed 33-year-old Tyran De Lattibeaudiere, a former Legia Warsaw player, for the 2024/2025 season.\n\nLast season, Lattibeaudiere averaged 9.8 points and 4.8 rebounds in 11 ORLEN Basket Liga games, and 10.5 points and 3.5 rebounds in four Basketball Champions League games.\n\nSasha Vezenkov has decided to waive $6.6 million of his NBA contract for the 2024/25 season and the Toronto Raptors have released him.\n\nThe Bulgarian forward must wait another 48 hours to get the final release and return to Olympiacos. During that time, Vezenkov will remain on the waivers list and, if no NBA team selects him, the Greek club can officially announce his signing.\n\nGiven Vezenkov’s strong desire to return to Europe, he is unlikely to be claimed by another NBA team.\n\nSource: sport24.gr\n\nOn the future of Filip Petrusev Olympiacos player’s agent Misko Raznatovic takes the floor.\n\nThe BeoBasket president clarifies how to date there have been no contacts between the Greek club and Red Star for Petrusev’s transfer: “And this is how it will be until Olympiacos has reinforcements at the position of ‘4’.”\n\nOlympiacos has been waiting for a positive solution to the Sasha Vezenkov telenovela for a long time..\n\nBarcelona targets Chimezie Metu.\n\nMetu this season has produced 5 points and 3 rebounds on average with the Phoenix Suns and 10.5 with the Pistons with 6 rebounds.\n\nRicky Rubio has accepted a proposal from Joventut de Badalona to return to the verdinegra jersey, 15 years after his departure. The news was launched by the Efe agency and confirmed by Mundo Deportivo.\n\nAfter ending his contract with Barça on June 30, Rubio was not included in the derecho de tanteo, allowing any team to freely negotiate with him. During the last few weeks, Rubio had conversations with Joventut executives and weighed the options of retiring or returning to the Badalonese club, finally opting for the latter.\n\nRubio left Joventut in 2009 to sign with Barça, with whom he won a Euroleague, and later began his career in the NBA. He returned to Barça last season and played 28 games averaging 5.3 points and 4.1 assists per game.\n\nRubio’s return to Joventut closes a controversial chapter in his career that began with his departure in 2009, when the player had contested a 4 million exit clause. With this return, Rubio will strengthen Joventut’s roster, which already counts on point guards Guillem Vives and Keye Van der Vuurst, and ‘combo’ Devon Dotson.\n\nSource: Mundo Deportivo.\n\nPartizan Mozzart Bet may lose Carlik Jones to interest from several NBA clubs. Jones, who has impressed with the South Sudan national team, was selected as Partizan’s new point guard.\n\nHowever, according to Mark Stein, NBA teams are monitoring the player and could sign him by Thursday, the deadline to enforce his contract with the Serbian club. If that does not happen, Jones will begin his adventure with Partizan.\n\nMaccabi Tel Aviv is in advanced talks to sign Lithuanian point guard Rokas Jokubaitis, 23, who has played the past three seasons with Barcelona. With a height of 1.93 meters, Jokubaitis could become the first point guard under Oded Kattash.\n\nBarcelona had the option to extend Jokubaitis’ contract for another season, but decided not to exercise this option, paving the way for his transfer. If the deal is finalized, Jokubaitis will join Jordan Loyd in Maccabi’s backcourt, which also hopes to complete the signing of Daryl Macon soon.\n\nLast Euroleague season, Jokubaitis averaged 5.3 points and 2.8 assists per game. His best season was in 2021/22, also with Barcelona, averaging 7.1 points and 2.6 assists per game. Raised in Zalgiris, Jokubaitis was selected 34th overall in the 2021 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder, but has not yet played in the NBA. He recently participated in the Summer League with the New York Knicks, averaging 9.8 points and 3.8 assists per game.\n\nPallacanestro Trieste is following Denzel Valentine with great interest, according to a report by Superbasket.\n\nBefore joining Milan for the latter part of the season, Valentine recorded averages of 12.1 points with 5.3 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game with Sydney in the NBL, in his first experience away from the States.\n\nPreviously the forward spent 6 NBA seasons with career-averages of 7 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists.\n\nAwudu Abass is a new player of BC Dubai, now it’s official.\n\n“His leadership and winning mentality are a perfect fit for our club.”\n\nThe 31-year-old swingman will play for the first time in his career away from Italy.\n\nLast season, his fourth with Virtus Bologna, Abass averaged 6.2 points and 2.2 rebounds between LBA and Euroleague.\n\nKolossos Rhodes announced that point guard London Perrantes has agreed to a new deal for the upcoming season.\n\nThe former Virginia last year scored 11.3 points and dished out 5.6 assists per game in the Greek league.\n\nHapoel Jerusalem strengthens the backcourt with the signing of Jeremy Morgan.\n\nThe guard comes from a good season with JL Bourg, where he produced 10 points (42% from three), 1.7 assists and 1.7 steals per game in the Eurocup.\n\nLegia Kosz strengthens the backcourt for the 2024/25 season with the arrival of Kameron McGusty.\n\nAfter a successful rookie year in Piacenza, the guard spent last year in France with Limoges CSP (9.6 points in 21 minutes per game).\n\nZach Hankins is a new player of Cluj-Napoca, as announced by the Romanian team.\n\nThe 27-year-old big man spent a two-year stint with Hapoel Jerusalem (10.1 points, 6.6 rebounds between Winner League and BCL in 2023/24).\n\nSegafredo Virtus Bologna is working on three major signings.\n\nSo many names are in the mix, let’s start with the most important- in terms of status but also salary-, experienced forward Will Clyburn.\n\nLa Gazzetta dello Sport speaks of a two-year contract close to signing, while for La Prealpina there would be an agreement in principle between the parties for around $1.5 million.\n\nFor the backcourt, with the probable exit of Dobric, the Italian team should add a point guard and a swingman.\n\nLa Gazzetta lists the names of Xavier Moon and Matt Morgan for the point guard position, while La Prealpina talks about a major offer for former Venice player Rayvon Tucker.\n\nThe Resto del Carlino speculates that the club will announce over the weekend the signings of Clyburn, Tucker and Morgan, in addition to the already known ones of Akele, Visconti and Grazulis.\n\nWe close by pointing out Matt Morgan’s outstanding ballistic performance last night at the Las Vegas Summer League: 36 points in 22 minutes shooting 11/11 from the field and 7/9 from the foul line in the Hornets’ win over the Trail Blazers.\n\nMorgan spent last season with the London Lions, where he produced averages of 17.2 points and 3.6 assists per game between the English league (45 percent from three) and Eurocup (36 percent).\n\nHighlights of his performance in Las Vegas:\n\nAccording to Il Corriere del Trentino, Daulton Hommes has reportedly exercised the clause to leave Dolomiti Energia Trentino in case of an offer from a Euroleague club.\n\nIt is unclear where the former Baskonia forward will end up.\n\nDolomiti Energia Trentino will therefore have to find one more piece on the market in addition to the two already missing to finalize the roster.\n\nOgnjen Dobrić, known as “Kobra,” is set to return to Crvena Zvezda after a year with Virtus Bologna. The news has been confirmed by Meridian Sport. During his previous tenure with Crvena Zvezda (2016-2023), Dobrić won numerous titles, including four Adriatic League championships and six national championships. His return now depends on the decision of Virtus Bologna, which must approve the transfer.\n\nSource: Meridian Sport\n\nAnthony Gill is not considering a return to Europe according to reports in Sportando.\n\nEarlier in the day we had reported on interest from Olympiacos and Efes in the former Khimki forward.\n\nGeorge Conditt IV is close to an agreement with Gran Canaria.\n\nThe Puerto Rico centre averaged 12.8 points and 8.4 rebounds last season in the G League.\n\nPallacanestro Reggiana announces it has reached an agreement for the 2024/2025 season with American athlete Cassius Winston.\n\nA 1998 class point guard, 185 centimetres tall, Winston was born in Detroit, where he remained until the end of high school. He attended Michigan State for the next four years: in 2019 he was named the best player in his conference, leading the Spartans to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament and becoming the best assist man in Big Ten history. In 2020, his senior season was cut short by the Covid pandemic: he was then chosen with the 53rd pick of the NBA Draft by Oklahoma. After playing 31 games in the ‘pros’ with the Washington Wizards’ jersey, he arrived in Europe in the summer of 2022, signing with the Euroleague club Bayern Munich.\n\nWith the German team he won the German Cup and participated in the Euroleague, where in 29 games he averaged 11 points and 3.4 assists in almost 20 minutes of usage.\n\nLast season, he moved to Turkey with Tofas Bursa, playing in the FIBA Basketball Champions League in addition to the national championship. He ended the season with an average of 14.7 points and 5 assists in almost 30 minutes of usage.\n\nCoach Dimitris Priftis describes him as follows: ‘Winston is a talented player with a lot of potential, especially in the offensive half of the court. Before coming to Europe he had a great college career behind him. He has an excellent ability to pass the ball and knows how to find his teammates, characteristics that will help our game. We are ready to work together with him to build the right team chemistry with his graft’.\n\nThese are Cassius Winston’s first words: ‘I am really galvanised by the idea of starting a new chapter in my career with this club and this organisation. I want to arrive in Reggio and compete from day one, the goal is only one: to give everything to win as many games as possible’.\n\nEdmond Sumner in the crosshairs of Trapani Shark? The news is reported this morning by La Prealpina.\n\nWe read: ‘Trapani tries to open the foreign market with a bang. Edmond Sumner, 28-year-old former Brooklyn Nets and Zalgiris Kaunas playmaker, has an important economic proposal in his hand: he may not give up the cups but he’s wavering’.\n\nPlay or second handler, born in 1995 with 193 centimetres, Sumner left Zalgiris Kaunas at the end of a 6.8 points average season in EuroLeague with 1.8 assists."
