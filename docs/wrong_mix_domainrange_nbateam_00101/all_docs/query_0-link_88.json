        "text": "Kevin Love said he’s committed to winning an NBA title with the Cleveland Cavaliers — however long it takes.\n\nThe All-Star forward was introduced Tuesday by the Cavs, who acquired him last weekend in a blockbuster, three-team trade. The deal gives the team a star-powered trio in Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.\n\nLove spent his first six seasons with Minnesota. He can opt out of his contract next summer but said he intends to stay with the Cavs: “I’m committed to this team, committed long term to the end goal and that’s to win championships.”\n\nLove said after James announced he was re-signing with Cleveland he called and asked him to join him. Love said he told James, “I’m in.”\n\nThe Timberwolves, meanwhile, introduced their prize in the deal at the Minnesota State Fair: Andrew Wiggins, who was taken No. 1 overall by the Cavs in the NBA draft.\n\n“It’s been a crazy summer, really up and down,” said Wiggins, 19. “But I wanted to play for a team that wanted me. I felt the love as soon as I got off the plane at the airport, so it’s all good now.”\n\nMore NBA:\n\nSmall forward Jared Dudley is going to the Milwaukee Bucks. A person with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press that the seven-year veteran was dealt to Milwaukee by the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for forward Carlos Delfino, a former Piston, and backup center Miroslav Raduljica. The Clippers are also receiving a future first-round pick. ... The Atlanta Hawks re-signed Mike Scott. Terms of the deal were not released. The 6-foot-8 forward averaged 9.6 points a game last season. ... The New Orleans Pelicans signed veteran small forward John Salmons to a free-agent contract. Salmons has played 12 seasons in the NBA. ... The Oklahoma City Thunder traded center Hasheem Thabeet and cash to the Philadelphia 76ers for a protected second-round draft pick in 2015 and a trade exception. The Thunder has a year to use the trade exception.\n\nCollege football:\n\nSouthern California coach Steve Sarkisian says the school is investigating defensive back Josh Shaw’s story that he injured both of his ankles jumping off a balcony to save his nephew from drowning. Sarkisian said USC has received calls contradicting Shaw’s detailed claims about his two high ankle sprains. Shaw’s story was told in a detailed post on the Trojans’ website Monday hailing the fifth-year senior’s heroism.\n\nCollege basketball:\n\nIndiana added power forward Emmitt Holt to its recruiting class. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound freshman, a finalist for New York’s Mr. Basketball Award, averaged 19.8 points, 14.6 rebounds and 5.0 blocks at Webster Schroeder High last season, andhas a 7-foot-3 wingspan.\n\nDetroit Free Press News Services"
