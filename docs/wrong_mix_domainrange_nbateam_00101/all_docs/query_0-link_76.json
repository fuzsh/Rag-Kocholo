        "text": "Michigan has never been one of the better states when it came to basketball, but we've always been able to hold our own on the hardwood. We have seen some great high school games within the mitten and had multiple professional players that were born here, even some championships at the college and pro level. All of that is in the past now, because Michigan is really struggling on the hardwood this year.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons have won the NBA Finals 3 times since moving to Detroit, they had back-to-back titles with the Bad Boys in 1989 and 1990 and then a lone title in 2004. Since the glory they faced in the early 21st century, the Pistons have been clawing to get back to that. This year is another year of disappointment but at least they aren't the only team underperforming during the basketball season in Michigan.\n\nCringey College Basketball\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines are one of the worst teams in Men's College Basketball this year as they have an 8-17 record and boast an unimpressive 3-14 record within Big Ten play. They have struggled to find their rhythm which is going to lead to another disappointing season, but they aren't even the worst college basketball team in the state.\n\nThat title instead belongs to the University of Detroit Mercy Titans, who have been doing more than struggling on the hardwood this year. Last year, this Titans team was on the brink of history as Antoine Davis almost set the NCAA career points record, this year they were once again almost on the brink of history. Although this history wasn't something they wanted to accomplish, they did as they were almost held winless this year. They just won their first game of the year earlier this week 81-66 over IUPUI, moving the titans to 1-26 on the season.\n\nIt's Time To Tank\n\nThe Detroit Pistons aren't making things any better for the basketball fans in Michigan. The Pistons who came into the year with a young core that was looking to make a splash within the league this year, but they have made the exact opposite impression. They hired a new coach in Monty Williams who was supposed to come in and help change things around.\n\nInstead, the Detroit Pistons have managed to become the worst team in the league in a matter of a few months. In a season where they could've been within the top 10 teams in the East and be playing in the Play-In tournament for a spot in the playoffs, they are instead thinking about tanking for the number 1 overall pick. The Pistons are currently 8-46 as they are preparing for the all-star break.\n\nDetroit is quite possibly the worst city in all of America for basketball and it's fans, do you agree?"
