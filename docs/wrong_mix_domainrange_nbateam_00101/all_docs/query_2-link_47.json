        "text": "I recently ran a story about Brad Evans and his untimely death, knowing this was not the only person or family that has suffered from such horrible things. What I didn’t know was that there are families that want their stories told. Let me preface by saying that I am just a guy who has devoted his spare time to raise awareness about concussions and their lasting effects, just ONE guy and I was utterly floored and brought to tears by an email I received today, the sender was Michelle Trenum, mother of Austin Trenum who also ended his life prematurely on September 27, 2010. Austin had been diagnosed with a concussion sustained in a game the previous Friday. Here is Mrs. Trenum, a grieving mother’s email to me;\n\nI saw your blog posting on Brad Evans. Our son, Austin Trenum, received a “mild to moderate” concussion on September 24, 2010 at his football game. Less than 48 hours later, our beautiful, smart, funny, happy, athletic, talented son took his life suddenly and spontaneously. There was no warning, no depression, no mental health issues, no drugs or alcohol issues, no divorce or financial issues, no trouble with friends, no trouble with school, no fights or breakups with girlfriend, etc. We found out about Brad Evans the day after it happened when the press contacted us noting the similarities of the two boys. We were not up to speaking to the press but a friend who represents the family did call down there. The reporter down in Fayetteville who’d personally interviewed Brad’s family and friends and they all said that everyone said the same thing about Brad: that there was no reason and that he was excited about his future. That sounded so familiar to us.\n\nWe know with every fiber of our being that Austin would never have taken his own life. He was too well adjusted, happy, and so excited about college. He was making plans for that Sunday evening with his girlfriend, Continue reading →\n\nResearch is beginning to suggest that chronic exposure and delayed recovery from TBI (concussions) is directly effecting executive functioning of the brain. This past August, the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology published an abstract on an experiment from Finland.\n\nHartikainen, Waljas, et al performed executive reaction time testing, standard neuropsych tests and diffusion tensor imaging on their subjects and found that there were significant differences in scores between those that still had symptoms and those that have fully recovered. The issue and problem that presented itself is that the scores indicated trouble in executive functioning of the “still-injured” brain as opposed to the recovered.(1)\n\nMindDisorders.com defines Executive Function as;\n\nThe term executive function describes a set of cognitive abilities that control and regulate other abilities and behaviors. Executive functions are necessary for goal-directed behavior. They include the ability to initiate and stop actions, to monitor and change behavior as needed, and to plan future behavior when faced with novel tasks and situations. Executive functions allow us to anticipate outcomes and adapt to changing situations. The ability to form concepts and think abstractly are often considered components of executive function.\n\nThese are high level abilities that influence the most basic things like attention, memory and motor functions. Along with the basics the executive functions of the brain allow each of us to adapt and perform in real life situations. Permanent or temporary deficits to the executive functioning of the brain are associated with; obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, ADD/ADHD, Tourette’s Syndrome, schizophrenia, and autism.\n\nThere has been suspicion about how concussion symptoms specifically affect the brain, this could be our first hard evidence of the executive function angle. As with previous studies, actually quantifying executive function is difficult, more research is needed and welcomed.\n\n(1) – PubMed\n\nAs unpredictable as the games have been in the NFL, what is becoming a trend is the amount of concussions. The nation took notice in week six after some big hits, and the league responded with more emphasis on the rules, including increases in the fines. Since then, there have been 48 concussions, leading up to that there were 45. A quick snapshot would tell you that rule enforcement is not helping.\n\nAlong the time we have been reporting this information, how we disseminate it has been tweaked, giving you the reader the most accurate picture of what is going on in this sport in terms of concussions. While analyzing the info, we have made slight changes to the player chart (put the week the injury was sustained), and with the numbers (reevaluated the preseason injuries).\n\nSince training camp has opened there have been 108 total reported concussions. There were eight concussions reported prior to the regular season, and 7 more that MAY have occurred before the regular season, but were not reported until week one. For reporting purposes of regular season the total is now 100 (DJ Williams of the Denver Broncos get the distinction of the 100th). The following are regular season stats.\n\nIncidence Rate = 14.63%\n\nEpidemiological Incidence = 9.11%\n\nConcussions per week = 9.0\n\nConcussions per game = .60\n\nProjected Concussions = 154\n\nThe following stats are for all 108 concussion;\n\nOffensive Concussions = 52\n\nDefensive Concussions = 58\n\nQB = 8, RB = 9, TE = 11, WR = 17, OL = 7\n\nDL = 12, LB = 12, DB = 32\n\nClick on the rest of the story for the entire list…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYouTube Video Tribute\n\nA promising young athlete struck down in the prime of his life, at his own hands. Brad Evans of Hobbton High School in North Carolina ended his life with a gunshot. A seemingly “put together” young man who had no indication of depression or impulse control issues suddenly and without explanation felt compelled to end it. Brad was going to go to college to play baseball and possibly strive for his ultimate goal of the Major Leagues.\n\nThis was to happen after his senior season, including on the gridiron, where all the problems may have begun. It is very important to say that there is and most likely will not be a link, but Brad suffered three concussion in a month’s time. He returned prematurely, and did not get a doctor’s clearance to participate. His final concussion occurred on October 8th and required a helicopter transport to a regional medical center.\n\nThe time line and a very good narrative of what happened to this young man are at the FayObserver.com, written by Greg Barnes.\n\nNo one will ever know whether Brad suffered from CTE, or whether the repeated blows to his head altered his thinking and led him to take his own life.\n\nSuicide remains one of the most common causes of death among teenagers.\n\nBut a mounting body of evidence – reinforced by the unlikely deaths of three promising young athletes since April – suggests that at least some of those suicides could be linked to repeated hits to the head.\n\nOnce again we hope that there are not many to report, but there will surely be some. Currently we are four concussions shy of 100 since training camp opened (see here), and I would like to be on top of it today. However, I cannot do that without the help of many eyes and ears, so I am calling for your assistance.\n\nYou can either comment here or tweet to @concussionblog if you have any information. There are some ground rules;\n\nReported by team\n\nReported by media\n\nPlayer knocked out (but we all should know that NOT being ko’ed still can mean concussion)\n\nPlayer uneasy on feet\n\nNotify us of: team, player, position, quarter, return status\n\nThat should get us started, thanks for the help!!!\n\n==============11:51\n\nPregame mode for me, tuning into RedZone, with my Broncos off, my fantasy teams can get the full attention…\n\n==============2:52\n\nI have not seen nor heard of anything this week, I am sure we will learn more after the games.\n\n==============9:13\n\nEllis Hobbs takes a shot to top of head, obviously lost control of his body and was “KO’ed”. Reporting movement in extremities, but the fact that he was still prone 4 min. post indicates serious injury.\n\nI don’t promote things here, but what I do is create discussion and thought as it relates to head injuries. I recently saw in Sports Illustrated a quick blurb on something called the V2, a new equipment invention. Instead of trying to explain it myself, I went to the source, Dr. Todd Aaron. I felt it would be best described in his words, so I had him compose a post that I could publish. And here is his unedited work;\n\nI created the V2 Prototype Concussion Reduction System when my daughter suffered a concussion in an equestrian accident. I vowed that I would find a way to protect all athletes so they could safely participate in sports.\n\nUntil the V2 Prototype Concussion Reduction System, all efforts to stop concussions have been based solely on the helmet. I realized that I needed to take a systematic approach to absorbing and dissipating the forces of impact thus minimizing their potential for central nervous system damage. Therefore I created a patented one-piece helmet and shoulder pad design that transfers energy away from the head and redistributes the total force. The product was tested at impacts in excess of 100 G’s at Biokinetics and Associates in Ottawa, Canada. Independent statistical analysis confirmed that one is nearly twice as likely to suffer a concussion when not wearing the V2 Prototype as compared to those using it!\n\nOne of the added benefits of the V2 Prototype is that the modifications to the current state of the art are minimal. There is no need to create a new helmet technology or a new shoulder pad system. The V2 can drive down the incidence of concussions as well as keep the standard aesthetic that so many players are unwilling to give up. In fact we have even had player feedback that the V2 would make them look even cooler!\n\nMy unique approach to concussion reduction also includes my unique position on concussion causes. I believe that I am the first Physician/Inventor to link the concussion mechanism of injury to Shaken Baby Syndrome\n\nI don’t believe that the commonly accepted theory of Coup-contrecoup adequately describes the pathology we are now seeing.” Coup-contrecoup is a macroscopic description first proposed by a French surgeon describing brain injury after blunt trauma…this theory is nearly 250 years old and only minimally describes the associated brain injuries. Chris Nowinski and his group out of Boston have shown that the microscopic brain pathology found in people suffering from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is found diffusely throughout the brain, not just on superficial and opposite areas that Coup-contrecoup proposes. In fact the brain damage in CTE is nearly identical to that seen in Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\nMany people have described the brain as a gelatinous substance, which is easily shaken and damaged. In reality the brain is not as dense as is jello, but made of different density cell types which develop their own momentum when rapidly decelerated causing through and through axonal shearing and damage. It is this physician’s belief that a more proper name for the epidemic of concussions seen in contact sports would be more appropriately called “Adult Shaken Brain Syndrome”. This too would explain why helmets alone are only minimally able to protect the wearer from concussion causing injury.\n\nDr. Aaron is a practicing physician in Philadelphia. He is boarded in Internal Medicine and an elected Fellow of the American College of Physicians. He is also the US Patented Inventor of the first systems approach to reducing concussion risk in contact sports. See Revolutionarysportsgear.com\n\nI think it is great that Dr. Aaron is thinking outside of the box, but as with most inventions; money and research are the biggest hurdle. I hope that Dr. Aaron can fine tune this and get it into the real world to see if there are positive impacts in the concussion realm.\n\nLast night we had our second girls basketball contest of the winter season and it was a VERY, VERY busy night!!! First, some back story on my experience with girls basketball as an athletic trainer…\n\nThis sport is extremely physical. In all my years covering girls high school basketball (11), I’ve observed there are more bodies on the floor and bumps and bruises than any other winter sport, wrestling included. I have no idea why it is like that, but this sport lends itself to a high rate of concussions. In fact, I had four last year, which equals what we had in football this year. I also have been dealing with an athlete that sustained a concussion last January, still has symptoms and has yet to return, which is my second such long-term concussion issue in four years.\n\nBack to last night, we (my A.T. student, two high school observers and I) were going through the routine of the JV game when a previously-concussed athlete that had been cleared by a physician (AGAINST MY ADVICE) was warming up for the second half, and a ball hit her head. Most individuals that get hit in the head by a ball would just get mad and brush it off, but not this one. She crumpled to the floor, dazed and upset. We took her to the training room for evaluation, and she would not return (we will get back to her later).\n\nDouble Dribble\n\nWhile my students were observing her in the dark training room, I was back on the floor covering the game, when no more than 5 minutes later a player was dribbling up the court and was tripped and her head bounced off the court. She grabbed her head and was writhing in pain. I got to her side and she had tears in her eyes and a dazed look. After calming her down, she reported just a small headache while sitting on the court, but she was not acting like herself. We stood her up and like a cornstalk in the wind, she wobbled back and forth. She was ushered to the dark training room for observation as well.\n\nBy this time our resources were strapped. Good thing I had student observers, as they were put in charge of watching them, (as you could guess, these high school students are well versed in concussions, and working with me they get daily homework about this injury) and if they changed demeanor they would contact me or my college student. We were not in the training room because of paperwork, finding parents, or covering the game still going on. Then chaos knocked on the door.\n\nDads\n\nThe phone rang, and it’s from a parent at the junior high just across the parking lot, and he reports a girl on the floor with a head injury (you can see our community is becoming so VERY responsive to this issue). Continue reading →\n\nAfter some tweaking of information gathering, I am making some changes to the Concussion Reports. There will no longer be a listing on Saturday of the concussion list and their status for the games. Rather, I will be putting all the information in the Concussion Report to appear on Fridays. By making this change I feel that I will have a more comprehensive list. The change was made in response to my feelings that some concussions are being missed by the NFL Official Injury Report, and that the reporters of the NFL are doing a great job of finding information. Players are not listed on this list unless there are corroborated reports of concussion. Now for the information…\n\nSince Training Camp has opened there have been 96 concussions\n\n48 concussions on offense, 48 on defense\n\nBy Position; QB (8), RB (8), TE (10), WR (16), OL (6), DL (9), LB (11), DB (28)\n\nThe exterior players (WR/DB) make up 45.8% of concussions\n\nInterior players (OL/DL) make up 15.6% of concussions\n\n7 players (Maurice Leggett, Jay Thomas, Freddy Keiaho, Mike Furrey, Hunter Hillenmyer, Darcy Johnson and Ben Hamilton) have been placed on Injured Reserve due to concussion\n\nThere have been 88 concussions during the regular season\n\nAverage of 8.8 concussions/week\n\nAverage of .58 concussions/game\n\n150 projected concussions at seasons end\n\nIncidence Rate (# concussions/average players in NFL/week) is 14.17%\n\nEpidemiological Incidence (# concussions/all players a.k.a. 53 man roster) is 8.82%\n\nClinical Incidence (# concussions/play) or chance of sustaining a concussion on any given play is 2.5%\n\nLooking at the stats through Week 10 there are some glaring indications that some small changes could make an impact.\n\nDevelop a position specific helmet.\n\nThe higher the impact force (speed) the greater chance of a concussion, address rules.\n\nInvestigate the impact the interior players are getting on a daily basis (sub-concussive forces) and the cumulative effects.\n\nThat is all I have for now but you can click on the continuation of this story for the full list. Continue reading →\n\nLooks like Pop Warner, with the help of the NFL, has created a medical oversight committee, and their first task was the creation of some head injury rules/guidelines. I am still looking for a full press release with more details – all info I have is based on this espn.com article. Youth athletes MUST have a note from a doctor before allowing return to play. While this is a GIANT step in the right direction, this issue is certain to be filled with problems purely on lack of universal access to medical professionals experienced with sports-related head injuries. More to come when I find the full press release…\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nWow, I am impressed… there were a few things that came to mind when I read the espn.com article that I was immediately concerned about, and it appears Pop Warner did a great job with these rules. While I still have some concerns, it is certainly a SIGNIFICANT step forward in youth athletics.\n\nMy number one concern was parents – now I know there are many great parents out there, many that would do anything for their children – but with that comes another problem. Sometimes doing anything and everything is going too far, specifically I’m talking about two things. 1.) Parents being objective and seeing the bigger picture when their child is injured in athletics (sometimes it becomes hard to remember that this is just a game for fun). And 2.) parents who are also medical providers can have their judgment clouded when it’s their child that’s injured.\n\nFortunately, Pop Warner has addressed these issues.\n\nS3: Injured player: Once removed by reason of injury, a player shall not re-enter the game without the approval of an official licensed athletic trainer or medical professional who is not a parent/guardian of the player.\n\nMore to come.\n\nFull Press Release\n\nI don’t know how else to bring you raw, unfiltered thoughts other than trying to blog live. Essentially I believe you will be seeing notes about what I am taking in. Disclaimer: if you have not followed me until now, you will notice sarcasm and an attempt at humor… But they will be genuine feelings and opinions. THESE ARE MY OPINIONS AND MINE ALONE. However if you feel that you want to express anything, please do so via the comment button. I will be putting the information from most recent to first, you will have to scroll to see the beginning… Here we go!!!———————————————————————————————————————\n\n=====2:15\n\nThe panel continues, but I have to run to do my duties as an athletic trainer. Thanks for reading and hope that you get the chance to see the webinar. Would love to hear any comments.\n\n=====2:14\n\nErb talks about rules, spearing is a huge issue, intentional or unintentional. Athletes are bigger, stronger, faster and still growing, and the game has become more wide open. Erb touches on mouth guards, chin straps, and officials… Then opens up on the media….\n\n=====2:10\n\nQ: What role does EMS have in this issue?\n\nA: Joe Clark, they should only be involved in the transport, spine boarding, etc. The athletic trainers need to approach the EMT’s/Ambulance crew prior to the event. “The athletic trainer is in control of the scene until the EMS has arrived or called onto the field.”\n\nI need more Joe Clark’s in this world!!!\n\n=====2:07 Continue reading →\n\nFollowing up on the unfortunate story of Tre’ Newton having to stop playing football due to multiple concussions, his Longhorn teammates turn in two quotes that make you say “really?!”.\n\n“I support Tre’ but for me personally, I’d die on that field,” Williams said.\n\n“I always go 100 miles per hour and will worry about all that health stuff 10 years from now when I’m done playing,” Gideon said. “I’m making memories now. We all knew what we were signing up for when we started playing football.”\n\nWilliams is Aaron Williams and Gideon is Blake Gideon, both defensive backs on Texas’ football team. Both of these “non-forward” looking kids have sustained previous concussions. Maybe Tre’ is the only one with some common sense in Austin? It’s great the Gideon is making memories, but if he keeps it up they will not be HIS memories, because he will not remember them.\n\nListen up boys, you only get one brain. Someone ought to show them some videos and news stories of athletes that have had too many brain injuries.\n\nLINK TO QUOTES\n\nThanks to @catch108stchs for this story.
