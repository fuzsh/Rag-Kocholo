        "text": "Detroit Pistons - Empty The Bench\n\n2006/07 Record: 53-29, 1st in Central Division, 1st in Eastern Conference\n\nKey Losses: Carlos Delfino, Chris Webber (for now), Dale Davis\n\nKey Additions: Jarvis Hayes, Rodney Stuckey, Arron Afflalo\n\nWhat significant moves were made during the offseason?\n\nFor a team that’s laden with so much veteran talent and possesses an NBA Championship caliber core of All-Star starters, less is more. Despite the disappointing losses in the Eastern Conference Finals the last two seasons, the entire nucleus remains from a team that was one game from a title in 2005, made it to the East Finals in 2003 and won the title in 2004. Still, there are several reasons for increased optimism.\n\nThe team has decided to get into shape. According to MLive, Rasheed Wallace, Nazr Mohammad, and Flip Murray all dedicated their offseasons to improved conditioning. ‘Sheed lost 25 lbs. and is in the best shape of his Pistons tenure. Backup combo guard Flip Murray also lost 20 lbs. and could contribute the quick scoring punch off the bench he’s capable of that wasn’t always there last year. Nazr has taken to pilates, and the team can only hope that’ll help him be more dynamic and quick around the basket.\n\nThe most significant change, though, may be incorporating the explosive games of \"veteran\" youngsters Amir Johnson and Jason Maxiell. Both have the look of future stars in this league. Maxiell is an absolute bull who should figure prominently into the rotation after a strong showing last season. The third-year forward is capable of dominating backup power forwards and can throw down on anybody, any time–posterizing opponents is the name of his game. He was fantastic in summer league play, will sport an improved jumper, and already throws down the rock as hard as anybody in the NBA. Johnson is lanky and unproven, but he was the best player in the NBADL last season and has grown from 6′9″ on draft day to 6′11 1/2″ today. With his silky skill set and size, Johnson would likely have been a top-5 pick in the draft this year if he had gone to college.\n\nThough Jarvis Hayes will also add much-needed depth at small forward, the only other true \"new\" addition that will pay immediate dividends this season is 15th overall pick Rodney Stuckey, who’s looked dominant in summer league and preseason play. He’s an NBA-ready guard who should provide an offensive spark off the bench. Stuckey is strong and excels at creating his own shot and taking the ball to the basket. He’s also a great passer with good size who can play both guard positions for the Pistons on both ends of the floor.\n\nWhat are the Pistons’ biggest strengths?\n\nWithout question, Detroit’s greatest strength is their wealth of experience and veteran leaders. That goes for playoff experience as well as the familiarity the core has with one another. Chauncey Billups, Rip Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace and Tayshaun Prince have all been there, together, and know what it takes to win. There are few players in the NBA more collected and clutch than Billups and Wallace in crunch time. The Pistons also play fantastic team defense as a result of their familiarity. There is an absolute sense of selflessness among these veteran leaders on both ends of the floor. Over the years, Billups has developed into one of the best pure points in the NBA and manages the game extremely well while hitting huge shots and always knocking down his free throws. And you had better believe these guys are motivated after last season’s crushing defeat.\n\nWhat are the Pistons’ biggest weaknesses?\n\nWhen this franchise shocked everyone outside of the Metro Detroit back in ‘04 by crushing the favored LA Lakers to win the NBA Title, most league observers commended them for their hardworking, generally humble persona. The phrase \"play the right way\" was drilled into our collective heads ad nausea. Since then, however, general public opinion has slowly changed, and now the Pistons are often criticized for their arrogance and flip-the-switch mentality, a bad habit the team insisted would be vanquished last season but that reared its ugly head in the embarassing ECF loss to the Cavs.\n\nNow three years removed from that title, one would think the \"been there, done that\" attitude should be well dissipated, but it still pops up here and there. While there’s nothing wrong with a strong sense of confidence in yourself and your teammates, this team needs to temper that attitude and carry themselves with an increased sense of humility, as well as respect their opponents’ ability more than they sometimes do.\n\nOutside of what’s in their heads, the Pistons lack a reliable, go-to scorer in the post that they can feed when the going gets tough. Wallace will never be a consistent low-post banger, McDyess is very solid but streaky and prone to foul trouble, and Maxiell too inexperienced. They’re also not as strong in the middle defensively as they were in the past; no one is going to mistake Nazr Mohammed for Ben Wallace. Flip Saunders’ jump-shot oriented offense (below) can also be a detriment when the shots aren’t falling. There’s apparently been an increased focus during training camp on being in \"attack mode\" more often to help address the problem.\n\nWhat are the Pistons’ team goals?\n\nWhen it comes to the elite teams of the NBA, sizing up their season-end goals is about as easy as convicting Tom Donaghy: win the division, secure the #1 seed, win the conference, win the title. To get there, the Pistons should have two main sub-goals in mind this season:\n\n1) Develop the Bench, Settle on a Rotation, and Allow for Wiggle Room\n\nTne consistent criticism of Flip Saunders has been his inconsistency when it comes to substitution patterns and player minutes. Too often since taking over in Detroit, Saunders has waffled on which bench guys to play, and when, and in what situations, and this shortcoming has manifested itself in up-and-down performances from guys who might feel like they’ve been jerked around. Carlos Delfino, traded in the offseason to Toronto, and Dale Davis, a free agent, are prime examples from last year’s team. Being forthright with his complimentary players takes on added significance this season with so many young guys likely playing key roles.\n\nThe best way to avoid this pitfall is by ironing out a loose rotation early in the season, communicating said expectations to the players–including a rough guess at minutes for the near future–and sticking to it as much as possible. As the season goes, needs and situations will obviously change, and when they do it’s on Saunders to continue the lines of open communication and award performance, effort, and production with consistent minutes. If Amir Johnson is making the absolute most of his 10 minutes night in night out, find a way to reward him and up his floor time to 15 minutes.\n\nThat’s where the wiggle room is key. One could argue that part of Jason Maxiell’s inconsistency last season, for example, was never knowing how many minutes he’d get on a given night. In Game 2 of the ECF against the Cavs, Maxiell logged 22 minutes and posted a solid 15 points, 6 boards, 1 steal, and 2 blocks. The very next game, he played just 2:35. The point is, if a player emerges and starts coming up big–whether it be rookie Sammy Meija or vagabond vets Ronald Dupree and Nazr Mohammed–Saunders must be willing to adjust his rotation based on player development and performance. It’s a common theme in our Pistons preview.\n\n2) Limit the Starters Minutes (Especially Tayshaun Prince)\n\nThis goes hand in hand with Goal #1. As good as they are, the Pistons’ starting unit is only human and cannot continue logging the kinds of minutes they have been for the past two or three seasons. Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace, and Antonio McDyess are all on the wrong side of 30 and need their rest, especially in the early going, for this team to have a shot at a sixth straight trip to the ECF. While he’s probably the best-conditioned athlete in the league, Rip Hamilton seemed worn down towards the end of last year’s playoff run and should benefit from a slimmed-down Murray and energetic rookie in Stuckey backing him up. The Ripper is a guy that heavily relies on his jump shot falling, so keeping those skinny legs of his fresh is key.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, however, is giving Tayshaun Prince a break. Coming into the league, many questioned whether his slight frame could hold up to the pounding of 82+ games a season. He’s answered that skepticism by playing in every single game all four years of being a starter while logging about 36 minutes/per. That’s an incredible feat, but you can’t rely on that every year. As the defensive stopper assigned to check the Lebrons of the world, Prince is the glue of this team and needs to see his average minutes per game come down to around 30-32. The addition of Jarvis Hayes could finally make that a reality after a few consecutive years of the team’s empty promises to limit Prince’s burn.\n\nIf the Pistons can address both of the above goals with satisfactory results, they’ll be well on their way to the other, easy-to-predict season goals.\n\nCan Flip Saunders take this team to the NBA Finals… and win it?"
