        "text": "Allen KimSenior Analyst I\n\nPower Ranking Every NBA Team's Top Pure Shooter\n\n0 of 30\n\nJim Rogash/Getty Images\n\nPure shooters in the NBA are vital to the success of any organization. After all, you always need someone to knock down those big threes from downtown.\n\nSome players make up for their lack of athletic ability with their shooting stroke, while others simply have a money jumper.\n\nSo, who's the top shooter from every team and who's the best of the bunch?\n\n30. Omri Casspi, Sacramento Kings\n\n1 of 30\n\nThe Sacramento Kings are full of mediocre shooters, which probably holds the team back significantly.\n\nThe team’s best shooter is probably the second-year forward out of Israel, Omri Casspi.\n\nHe’s more than capable of lighting it up, especially from downtown. He hit six of seven three-point shots in a game earlier this season against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n29. Carlos Delfino, Milwaukee Bucks\n\n2 of 30\n\nCarlos Delfino is not a widely known commodity in the NBA, but he is arguably the best shooter on the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nYou could make a case for Michael Redd, but Redd has been out of action for quite some time and no one’s quite sure what he’s capable of doing at this point in his career.\n\nDelfino is a vital cog in the Bucks’ offense, and his absence has hurt the team this season.\n\n28. Rudy Fernandez, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n3 of 30\n\nRudy Fernandez has been nothing but a headache for the Portland Trail Blazers. However, he is vital to the success of the team with his shooting ability.\n\nWith Brandon Roy ailing, Fernandez may actually see an increased role that may even get him to stop complaining.\n\nThen the NBA can see what he is truly made of when given enough playing time.\n\n27. Luke Ridnour, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n4 of 30\n\nLuke Ridnour is not a flashy point guard, but he’s reliable and consistent.\n\nRidnour wasn’t always the greatest shooter, but he has taken great strides with his jump shot and has become one of the most efficient shooters in the league.\n\nHis 45 percent shooting from long range is one of the highest in the league.\n\n26. Marco Belinelli, New Orleans Hornets\n\n5 of 30\n\nMarco Belinelli has quickly become the New Orleans Hornets' best shooter.\n\nMost of his points essentially come from jump shots, with half of his makes being three-pointers.\n\n25. O.J. Mayo, Memphis Grizzlies\n\n6 of 30\n\nO.J. Mayo entered the NBA a deadly shooter. His game has regressed over the past two years, and he was recently demoted to the bench.\n\nMayo may be in the midst of a serious slump, but don’t let his poor play fool you.\n\nWhile he has had some trouble this season, when his game is on, he’s a deadly scorer with near-unlimited range on his jump shot.\n\n24. Stephen Jackson, Charlotte Bobcats\n\n7 of 30\n\nThe mercurial swingman Stephen Jackson is just as talented as he is a headache to coach.\n\nHowever, he is extremely versatile and a more than capable shooter, able to light it up on any given night.\n\n23. Eric Gordon, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n8 of 30\n\nAfter a stint with Team USA over the summer, Eric Gordon has returned to the NBA a changed man.\n\nGordon has been on a scoring binge, and he’s one of the top scorers in the NBA.\n\nWhile Gordon has become more of a slasher early on, he has limitless range on his jump shot.\n\nHis three-point shooting percentage is down this season, but it’s only a matter of time before he gets back into his groove from downtown.\n\n22. Mike Bibby, Atlanta Hawks\n\n9 of 30\n\nSomething drastic has happened to Mike Bibby from last season to this year.\n\nHe went from a 38.9 percent shooter from downtown to a blistering 53.8 percent this season. He's nailed 2.2 threes per game, and his three-point percentage actually tops his field goal percentage.\n\n21. Gilbert Arenas, Washington Wizards\n\n10 of 30\n\nGilbert Arenas has faced plenty of adversity over the last couple of years.\n\nHowever, it seems that most people have forgotten that he is one of the best shooters in the NBA.\n\nHe really hasn’t had a productive season in about four years, but he was a scoring machine during the 2006-07 campaign.\n\nIf you’ve watched him at any point this season, you can see that he’s still got it. He opened eyes around the league this season when he drilled seven out of 10 three-pointers in a game against the Chicago Bulls.\n\n20. Ben Gordon, Detroit Pistons\n\n11 of 30\n\nBen Gordon has not been having a great season by any means as he’s buried on the team’s bench getting less than 30 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, he is playing extremely efficient, averaging a career high 47.3 percent from the field. His 42 percent shooting from downtown falls just behind his career high set in his sophomore campaign.\n\nRegardless, Gordon is a shooter at heart, and he can go up against the best the NBA has to offer.\n\n19. Chauncey Billups, Denver Nuggets\n\n12 of 30\n\nChauncey Billups may be having a down year, but he isn’t called Mr. Big Shot for nothing.\n\nWhen the game is on the line and Carmelo is either in a funk or being swarmed by defenders, this is the man you want taking the shot.\n\n18. Deron Williams, Utah Jazz\n\n13 of 30\n\nNot only is Deron Williams one of the best shooting point guards in the league, he is arguably the most clutch of the group.\n\nWilliams is a fearless shooter.\n\nHe uses his deadly crossover to create space for his beautiful step-back jumper. He has deep range and if you slack off him for a moment, he’ll make you pay.\n\n17. Mo Williams, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n14 of 30\n\nMo Williams was lights-out when he had LeBron James drawing four defenders at him on every possession, but his shooting has tailed off now that James is no longer there.\n\nHis three-point shooting, in particular, has seriously regressed.\n\nHowever, Williams is still one of the best pure-shooting points in the NBA.\n\n16. Rashard Lewis, Orlando Magic\n\n15 of 30\n\nIt was a tough decision choosing between Rashard Lewis and J.J. Reddick, but I opted for Lewis because he has been the more consistent and better player over the course of their careers.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Lewis was the most prolific three-point shooter in the NBA. He made a living behind the arc, and his lanky arms and 6’11” frame made him a nightmare to guard.\n\nLewis may be on a serious decline, but he’s always useful in an offense set like Stan Van Gundy’s.\n\n15. Manu Ginobili, San Antonio Spurs\n\n16 of 30\n\nManu Ginobili has long been a staple of the San Antonio Spurs. He’s their most prolific scorer, and the team often turns to him as their go-to scorer down the stretch.\n\nAfter coming off the bench for years, Greg Poppovich finally opted to start the Argentinean, and he has responded with the best numbers of his career.\n\nGinobili is second in the league in three-point shooting, hitting 2.6 per game.\n\nHis elite slashing abilities give him just enough room to work his magic when he needs to pull up for a shot. If he’s getting overcrowded, his step back jumper is one of the deadliest in the NBA.\n\n14. Danilo Gallinari, New York Knicks\n\n17 of 30\n\nStanding at 6‘10”, Gallinari makes life difficult for opposing defenders. Once his long arms swing over his head, he can hit shots with impunity.\n\nDanilo Gallinari finished just behind Aaron Brooks in three-point shooting last season, and he could very well finish this season as the leader.\n\nHe started the season in a shooting slump but has since worked out of it, and he’s back to drilling jumpers with ease.\n\n13. Kevin Martin, Houston Rockets\n\n18 of 30\n\nThis was close between Kevin Martin and Aaron Brooks for the top spot, but I decided to opt for a healthy Kevin Martin as opposed to an injured Aaron Brooks.\n\nMartin has irregular form on his jump shot. He takes the term gunslinger to a new level with the way he pulls the ball to his hip before he lets loose.\n\nRegardless of how ugly the form is, it works and that’s all that really matters.\n\n12. James Jones, Miami Heat\n\n19 of 30\n\nChoosing between Mike Miller and James Jones was no easy feat. Both are lights-out shooters from deep, and I initially went with Miller but changed my mind after looking at what Jones has done so far.\n\nJones essentially sits behind the arc and waits for that open look all game long: 2.1 out of the 2.5 shots he makes are three-pointers, and he rarely does anything else but shoot.\n\nHis 45 percent rate from downtown hovers near the top of the league, and he defines the term pure shooter.\n\n11. Jason Kapono, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n20 of 30\n\nJason Kapono is buried deep on the 76ers depth chart, so he really hasn’t had an opportunity to showcase his shooting talents.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2008, he was arguably the best pure shooter in the game. He shot 51.4 percent from deep during the 2006-07 NBA season and 48.3 percent during the 2007-08 season.\n\nKapono actually has a pretty ugly-looking jumper, but he’s still one of the best shooters in the NBA.\n\n10. Kyle Korver, Chicago Bulls\n\n21 of 30\n\nKyle Korver’s job is to do one thing and one thing only: hit jump shots. Whether he’s pulling up from beyond the arc or near the paint, Korver has one of the most reliable jumpers around.\n\nHe really leans on his shot to score to make up for his lack of athleticism. The three-ball is the deadliest weapon in his arsenal with a career 41 percent success rate from deep.\n\nKorver is a fearless shooter, and he’s made plenty of clutch buckets over his career.\n\n9. Andrea Bargnani, Toronto Raptors\n\n22 of 30\n\nAndrea Bargnani fits into the mold of Dirk Nowitzki—a seven-footer with a deadly jump shot.\n\nThe Italian is a matchup nightmare. He’s able to stretch the floor behind the arc and can put the ball on the floor and attack the basket when needed.\n\nBargnani uses his height to his advantage as he shoots over smaller defenders with relative ease.\n\n8. Anthony Morrow, New Jersey Nets\n\n23 of 30\n\nAnthony Morrow may not be a household name, but he’s an underrated player.\n\nHis best asset is his shooting stroke, particularly from three-point range.\n\nMorrow’s career three-point shooting percentage sits at 45.3. He can challenge the all-time leader, Steve Kerr, when he hits the requisite 250 three-pointers made mark to be qualified.\n\nIt’s rather puzzling that he hasn’t been invited to the three-point shooting contest, but hopefully he gets a shot this year.\n\n7. Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n24 of 30\n\nNot only is Kobe one of the most prolific scorers in the history of the game, he’s one of the best closers.\n\nKobe has a silky smooth jumper with immaculate form. In fact, he may have the second-nicest-looking jumper behind one other player on this list.\n\nBryant is capable of hitting shots from pretty much anywhere on the court at the most extreme angles.\n\nGet him into the low post and he’ll abuse you with his turn-around fadeaway all game long.\n\n6. Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n25 of 30\n\nKevin Durant is arguably the most prolific scorer in the NBA today.\n\nHe may be off to a slow start to the year, but he still leads the league in scoring.\n\nDurant can score in a variety of ways—getting nearly a third of his points at the charity stripe—but it’s his deadly jumper that makes him so difficult to guard.\n\nStanding at 6’10” with lanky arms, when he pulls the ball over his head, he’s extremely difficult to block.\n\n5. Danny Granger, Indiana Pacers\n\n26 of 30\n\n4. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors\n\n27 of 30\n\nStephen Curry was one of the most prolific scorers while he was playing college ball, and he owes that to his impeccable shooting stroke.\n\nNicknamed the Baby-Faced Assassin, Curry shoots lights out from pretty much all corners.\n\nCurry has a quick release—which helps him avoid timely blocks—and his accuracy is nearly unmatched at his position.\n\nOnly in his second season, Curry’s shooting stroke will undoubtedly improve over time, which is scary when you see how great of a shooter he already is. He was one of the top five best three-point shooters last season, and he’s one of the best right now.\n\nHis percentage from behind the arc comes in at 43.6 percent—higher than what a lot of players shoot inside the arc.\n\n3. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks\n\n28 of 30\n\nFor a seven-footer, Dirk Nowitzki’s shooting prowess is on par with the most skilled guards in the NBA.\n\nWhether he was doing running leaners, pull-up jumpers or turn-around fadeaways, Dirk had the whole repertoire.\n\nCouple his towering frame with his silky smooth jumper, and you have an unbridled scoring machine that is near impossible to block. Look no further than his fade-away jumper and the helpless defender assigned to try and stop him.\n\n2. Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns\n\n29 of 30\n\nSteve Nash will go down in the history books as one of the most prolific shooters from the point guard position. He could very well challenge Mark Price for that honor, if he hasn’t already surpassed him, of course.\n\nNash is one of the few players on this list to make the illustrious 50-40-90 club (at least 50 percent shooting from the field, 40 percent from deep and 90 percent at the line for the season).\n\nFor a guard, Nash manages to consistently stay near the top of the league in field goal percentage. He currently sits at No. 4 on the list for guards.\n\nHe uses his pristine dribble-drive to maneuver around the court to find that small opening to drill pull-up jumpers. Also, his transition three-ball is arguably the best in the game today.\n\n1. Ray Allen, Boston Celtics\n\n30 of 30\n\nRay Allen is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, shooters in the history of the NBA.\n\nAllen has picture-perfect form on his jump shot that even the best players in the game today could envy.\n\nHe has made a living running defenders ragged off of screens for catch-and-shoot jumpers. Get him to the line and he’ll make you pay, as he’s one of the greatest free-throw shooters ever.\n\nAllen is drilling 2.1 three-pointers per game at a 42.6 percent clip. He is closing in on Reggie Miller’s all-time record for most three-pointers made. A record he will most assuredly break at some point this season.\n\nDown by three with the game on the line, I’d take Allen any day of the week.\n\nX"
