        "text": "A lot has changed for the Minnesota Timberwolves over the last week.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (13-43) vs. Milwaukee Bucks (21-34) at the Bradley Center\n\nDo you even recognize your Timberwolves anymore? Is this the same team that lost to the Clippers at home a mere six days ago? It doesn't seem like it.\n\nKevin Love played in the All-Star Game. Wesley Johnson was throwing down dunks off of passes from John Wall. Michael Beasley is healthy again. Corey Brewer will be wearing a Knicks jersey the next time he plays. Anthony Randolph and Kosta Koufos are already fighting over who gets the cushy chair at the end of the bench.\n\nIt's a strange world. But hey, we've got a game to play.\n\nTonight, the Wolves are in Milwaukee to take on the Bucks. Milwaukee lost its previous game before the All-Star break in what turned out to be Carmelo Anthony's last appearance in a Denver Nuggets uniform. Let's break down tonight's matchups:\n\nIt hasn't been a great year for Andrew Bogut since returned from injury.\n\nDarko Milicic vs. Andrew Bogut\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks made the playoffs last season largely on the back of Andrew Bogut, who had arguably the best season of his career. After breaking his arm, however, the Aussie has come back to a team that doesn't look like a playoff contender. For his part, Bogut's points per game average has dropped 3 points, despite playing more minutes per game, and he is shooting only 48% from the floor (compared to 52% last season).\n\nTonight, he takes on Darko Milicic. According to my sources, Darko spent the entire All-Star break in Russia training with Nicolai Koloff and Igor Rimsky. Sounds like trouble for Bogut. I'd expect nothing less than a double-double from the Serbian tonight.\n\nWinner: Darko Milicic\n\nOne of these people turned out to be an All-Star.\n\nKevin Love vs. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute\n\nI like Luc Richard Mbah a Moute. But c'mon, does this guy have a nickname or something? Do I have to take 30 seconds to write out his name every time? Someone needs to work on this before the next Bucks preview.\n\nAnyhow, despite his name, I like this guy as a player. He could be a nice defensive stopper on a contending team. The problem is that when would-be role players on good teams are only would-be role players on bad teams, they don't look as good. If he were playing next to Kobe and Pau? There'd be a thousand Internet posts talking about how underrated he is, some stats guy like Dave Berri would proclaim him to be an All-Star, Mark Cuban or Ted Leonsis would offer him $40 million over $4 years and we'd spend 3 of those years talking about how bad of a contract he has.\n\nKevin Love is like bacon. He'll be great in pretty much every situation. Tonight, he'll bring some of that All-Star home and put up a 20/20 on LRMAM.\n\nWinner: Kevin Love\n\nMichael Beasley is back after a nice, long rest.\n\nMichael Beasley vs. Carlos Delfino\n\nBoth Michael Beasley and Carlos Delfino have had to deal with injuries this season. Delfino has only played in 23 games so far this year and he's shooting under 40% from the floor. The forward from Argentina kept the Bucks competitive with the Atlanta Hawks in last year's playoffs, but so far this season, his play hasn't kept them competitive with much of anyone - let alone playoff contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Beasley is ready to return to the lineup for the Timberwolves after spending time on the shelf with an ankle injury. Beasley undoubtedly watched Love's performance in the All-Star Game and has been sparked to play even better during this laugh part of the season. While he should remain smart about playing with that ankle, it will be great to see him popping jumpers like they're Wild Berry Skittles.\n\nWinner: Michael Beasley\n\nThis one is for you, Corey.\n\nCorey Brewer vs. John Salmons\n\nCorey Brewer and I both began our \"careers\" with the Minnesota Timberwolves at the same time. I started out as a young season ticket holder who spent $300 of birthday money on a single seat in Row T of the upper deck. Corey started out as a young forward with promise, coming off of a National Championship with the Florida Gators. In the three and a half years since then, I've watched hundreds of games, I've written hundreds of pieces on those games and I've spent countless hours talking and thinking about the Timberwolves.\n\nOut of all of those experiences, there are few players who have stood out in that time more than Corey Brewer. Sure, Brewer was wildly inconsistent on the court. But he gave effort and he was a stand-up guy. Win or lose, I don't need much more than that.\n\nI've met Brewer on several occasions. I don't know him. We aren't friends and we've never had a conversation where I wasn't a fan and he wasn't a player. But even so, the Corey Brewer that I met was a fantastic individual who gave his time and attention to those who cared about him as a basketball player. He answered my questions when I asked them. He even laughed at a couple of my jokes. I know it's impossible to know the true person behind any athlete, but naive or not, I think Corey Brewer is one of the good ones in the NBA.\n\nI'm sad to see him go. But it will be great to watch him in the playoffs this Spring. I hope Mike D'Antoni gives him a chance because I think the nation is ready for how good this guy really can be.\n\nWinner: Corey Brewer\n\n48 Minutes of Tel(fair)?\n\nSebastian Telfair vs. Brandon Jennings\n\nWith Luke Ridnour not making the trip to Milwaukee and Jonny Flynn reportedly being shut down by David Kahn, that leaves only Sebastian Telfair and Wayne Ellington take over tonight's point guard duties in Milwaukee. While I think 48 Minutes of Tel(fair) has a catchy ring to it and is far better than anything Nolan Richardson has ever done, I'd also like to see Makin' It Wayne get some good minutes in the backup point guard role.\n\nAfter all, I made him the starting point guard on my NBA2K11 squad and he's got my Wolves in the #1 spot right now. We all know that NBA2K11 is never wrong about its player evaluations.\n\nTelfair and Ellington will take on Brandon Jennings tonight. Many Wolves' fans think Jennings is overrated and that current Wolf Luke Ridnour was more responsible for the Bucks success at the point last season. Well, of course anyone would look bad next to Luke Ridnour. That's not really a fair comparison. Jennings is a skilled player who should have a bright future in the NBA.\n\nThat being said, I think he's met his match tonight.\n\nWinner: Sebastian Telfair\n\nThe Wolves are gonna make Squad 6 sit down and go home early.\n\nMy Prediction: Timberwolves 108 - Milwaukee Bucks 81\n\nTimberwolves Record: 14-43"
