        "text": "Pacers, Andrew Nembhard agree to three-year, $59 million extension\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard has agreed to a three-year, $59 million contract extension that will take him through the 2027-28 season, Todd Ramasar and Jaafar Choufani of Life Sports Agency told ESPN on Wednesday morning. Nembhard — one of the breakout players of the 2024 Eastern Conference playoffs — agreed on the maximum allowable money available to him on a three-year deal. The Pacers will decline his $2.2 team option in 2025-26, allowing for the new deal to begin for him next year, sources said. Nembhard became eligible to sign the deal Monday.\n\nWith Haliburton out of the lineup in Games 3 and 4 of the conference finals against the Celtics, Nembhard averaged 28 points and 9.5 assists. He became the fourth player to shoot 55 percent from the floor and 45 percent on 3-pointers in a single postseason, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Nembhard’s 48 percent shooting on 3-pointers in the 2024 playoffs was best among players with 25-plus attempts, per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nAnd while the buzz that surrounded Bronny, and now Bryce, rises to unique heights, that plight is one that fellow NBA sons can relate to. “He’s getting a lot of hate for no reason, just because he’s LeBron’s son. LeBron has a lot of haters,” said Cayden Boozer, a five-star point guard expected to end up at either Duke (like his father, Carlos), Miami or Florida. “He’s still a rookie. He was the 55th pick. I don’t know why they’re expecting, like, that he’s supposed to be the next generational player. He has to become his own player. You have to let that happen.”\n\nStephen Curry on 2012 Olympics: 'I didn’t get picked because I wasn’t on the level I needed to be'\n\n“In 2012, I didn’t get picked because I wasn’t on the level I needed to be,” said Curry about the 2012 USA Basketball gold medal team that included Durant, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. “In ’16, I was coming off the Finals run and I didn’t feel I would get the rest I needed to get ready for the next season. And in 2020, it was a COVID year. And just that whole process, I don’t remember what was going on family wise. But it wasn’t a good time for me. “[Warriors teammate] Draymond [Green] played. He won twice (2016 and 2020). So, obviously I was watching him and missed out. This year, the stars aligned. It feels great. I’ve obviously had some time off for the ramp-up and Paris. It is all really cool.”\n\nWhat is it like not only playing on this star-studded USA team, but also playing with LeBron James for the first time? Stephen Curry: Obviously, me and LeBron have never been teammates in a competitive environment. And seeing how our games match, complement each other has been awesome so far… Everybody is just here, having fun, and understands the moment from top to bottom. The team that we have: myself, KD [Durant], LeBron, the champs [from the Boston Celtics], J.T. [Jayson Tatum], Jrue [Holiday], Joel [Embiid], I know that this is probably my one and only [Olympic] playing experience and I’m playing with guys I probably will never play with again at this level; it’s special. Me, K [Durant] and LeBron took the [same] picture that MJ [Michael Jordan], Larry Bird and Magic [Johnson] took [during the 1992 Olympics]. I can’t wait to get that on my wall and get them to sign it. It’s just an honor knowing what we’ve all done in our careers. The fact that we are the elder statesman with ’Bron still playing at a high level.\n\n“I’m surprised a lot of people are realizing that this is my first time playing in the Olympics,” Curry told Andscape on July 8. “I did play for Team USA in 2010 and 2014 on the World Championship team. I missed out on the three Olympic opportunities I’ve had while I’ve been in the league. So, I’m excited about it. I have a little bit of FIBA experience. The team that we have is amazing. Paris, where the world competition of basketball is right now, there is no cake walk. It’s going to be tough for us to win. “So, personally, it’s the one thing I haven’t been able to experience: Being an Olympian. Hopefully we will win gold. At this stage in my career, it’s give me an opportunity to just be so present in the moment and have fun playing basketball. It’s such a pure expression of the game. We’re all just trying to win, so it’s cool.”\n\nDespite not playing at a high level, Fernández earned this role quickly by mastering not only the intricacies of modern basketball but also by displaying elite interpersonal skills. During the Sacramento Kings’ visit to Toronto in March, Brown — now the coach of the Kings — said Fernández is “way better than me” at connecting with people. “Am I very good at it? I don’t know. I cannot tell you because I’m myself, but I try because I think it’s important,” Fernández told The Athletic earlier this month. “Sometimes when you have the relationship, especially in the tough moments, is when you can break through and be successful. Otherwise, if you don’t have that relationship, then it’s tough. So you try to build it.”"
