        "text": "It's Andrew Bogut week here on NBA.com Australia! Throughout the week we'll feature stories celebrating the career of one of the greatest Australian basketball players in NBA history. From a historic NBA draft day to his role in crafting a Golden State dynasty to his profound impact on the Australian national team, we'll examine Bogut through every lens to offer up perspective on what makes him arguably the greatest Aussie hooper ever.\n\nWe brought together a crew of Australian basketball writers to look back at Bogut's impact on Australian basketball and the defining legacy he'll leave.\n\nKane Pitman - NBA Australia (@KanePitman)\n\nWhen combining longevity and personal accolades, Andrew Bogut stands clear at the top among the greats of Australian men’s basketball.\n\nNamed to the All-NBA Defence second team in 2015, Bogut also added a long-awaited ring with Golden State, but it was the 2009-10 season that the 7-footer was at his best.\n\nMost remember that season for the way it ended, with that gruesome arm injury against Phoenix on the eve of the 2010 NBA playoffs. Don’t overlook the dominant run the big man was on as the focal point of the Bucks' offence and anchor on defence.\n\nMORE: The numbers behind Andrew Bogut, Golden State's dynastic championship Aussie anchor\n\nBogut was named to the All-NBA third team in that season, but he was also a major All-Star snub and arguably should have been named the league’s Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nOutside of Bogut’s 14-year NBA career, his NBL MVP with the Sydney Kings and three Olympic campaigns add to a sparkling resume.\n\nKnown for his beautiful touch around the basket, a play that stands out is his game-winner against San Antonio at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee during his rookie season with the Bucks.\n\nWith 0.7 seconds on the clock and the scores tied at 107, Toni Kukoc threw a perfect lob to Bogut who caught and finished in mid-air off glass for the win in just the 23rd game of his career.\n\nThe only thing missing from Bogut’s trophy cabinet is an Olympic medal - perhaps the Tokyo 2021 Olympics could provide the perfect way to call time for the Aussie GOAT?\n\nLiam Santamaria - NBL (@Liam_Santa)\n\nWhen Andrew Bogut does eventually decide to hang up his size nineteen kicks – whenever that time may come – he will retire as one of the most influential figures in Australian basketball history.\n\nI mean, the big fella’s impact on the sport in this country has been immense.\n\nHe broke down barriers on that memorable draft night, inspired a generation across his lengthy NBA career, has been a pillar of strength for our national program and has brought much-needed attention to the game back home since returning to the NBL.\n\nOne of the best passing big men the game has ever seen, Bogut has also hung his hat on his enormous defensive impact and elite rebounding. Perhaps his greatest characteristic, however, has been his toughness.\n\nBogut’s never taken any s**t – that’s a given – but what has ultimately defined his career has been his ability to both play through pain and work his way back from injury.\n\nLet’s be honest, his injuries have been game-changers. From the frightening incident in 2010 to the nasty ankle injury in 2012 and the broken tibia he sustained in 2017 – as well as all the others in between – it’s incredible that he has continued to perform at a world-class level well into his thirties.\n\nWhich brings me to my favourite moment of the Bogey Man’s career to date: the gutsy performance he delivered in Game 2 of the Olympic qualifying series against the Kiwis back in 2015.\n\nThe TSB Bank Arena in Wellington is a long way from the glitz and glamour of the NBA Finals, but Bogut’s efforts that night were remarkable nonetheless.\n\nTruth be told: the man had no business playing in that game.\n\nHaving re-aggravated a debilitating back injury during the first game of the series, Bogut was gone for all money for Game 2. He couldn’t get out of bed. He was done. Yet somehow, he dragged himself onto a plane and willed himself onto the court; playing a crucial role in advancing the Boomers to the Rio Games.\n\nBogut recorded a double-double with three swats in that game – including a rim-rocking tip-jam off a missed free throw – but his impact far exceeded his numbers in the box score. He was truly inspirational and, looking back, it was a performance that reflected so much about his magnificent career.\n\nOlgun Uluc - ESPN Australia (@OlgunUluc)\n\nOver the past five years, we've seen Australia's modern NBA fraternity enter the forefront of our consciousness. Andrew Bogut was the father of that fraternity.\n\nThe centre entered the NBA as Australia's first-ever No. 1 overall pick, and showed an entire generation of his country's onlookers what it meant to be successful in one of the toughest leagues on earth. For most of his time in Milwaukee, Bogut was probably the best player on his team - something Australian fans hadn't experienced before - before he ended up in Golden State as a starter among arguably the greatest dynasty in league history.\n\nToday, when we look at the success of guys like Ben Simmons, and Patty Mills, and Joe Ingles, they're doing so amid a standard that Bogut set. He's the elder statesman of Australia's golden era of basketball, and is responsible for setting the foundation for what success looks like at that level.\n\nThat sentiment carried over to the modern-day Boomers, too; the ball would always go through Bogut's hands, so it was up to him to set his teammates up for success. It's the role he's played over his career, not one that necessarily came by choice, and one he carried over to the NBL.\n\nONE PLAY: Andrew Bogut played his role on the Golden State Warriors to perfection\n\nWhen it comes to my favourite moment of Bogut's career, there's one particular play that sums him up. It was during Bogut's time with the Warriors, back in 2016; the big-man tipped a loose ball out to Stephen Curry for a three, and started running back to his own half in celebration before the shot even went up. It went in, obviously.\n\nThat play was a perfect mixture of Bogut demonstrating why he's one of the best passing bigs in the history of the sport, and the mostly-playful and endearing smart-arsery that's defined his off-court persona.\n\nIf Bogut has played his final game, there's no quantifying the impact he's had on Australian basketball, and the stage he set for others to follow in his footsteps.\n\nRoy Ward - The Age (@rpjward)\n\nAndrew Bogut flew the flag for Australians in the NBA for so much of his career and I can’t help but feel that he kept the NBA dream alive for his countrymen.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that before Patty Mills, Matthew Dellavedova, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes and then Ben Simmons all broke through, it was Bogut who was setting the standard with his defence, passing and his toughness to return from several career-threatening injuries.\n\nWhat I will remember most was the way he formed such a strong connection with that Golden State Warriors side who won their club’s first title since the 1970s and did so by forming such a tight connection with budding superstars Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\n\nWhile injuries and other factors kept him away from the Boomers for several years, his efforts during Andrej Lemanis’ time in charge were exceptional.\n\nHe should be a multiple-time medal winner. Hopefully that can be rectified in 2021. If not he will forever be a champion regardless.\n\nBenyam Kidane - NBA Australia (@BenyamKidane)\n\nPut simply, Andrew Bogut kick-started Australia's modern NBA revolution after becoming the first Australian selected with the no.1 overall pick in 2005.\n\nSince then, Australia's imprint on the NBA has been as strong as ever, with Aussies making a name for themselves on championship-winning teams over the years and becoming regular fixtures on Australian television screens.\n\nBut that wasn't always the case.\n\nThe year is 2006 and NBA games are hard to come by on Australian TV, but Bogut's presence in the NBA had Milwaukee Bucks games plastered across TV screens in Australia for years to come, generating a wave of interest in the sport in Australia once again.\n\nThe Bogut effect was real.\n\nWhile his career highlight came in 2015, helping the Golden State Warriors break their 40-year title drought, the 35-year-old's commitment to helping grow the game in Australia will forever be his defining legacy.\n\nFrom his commitment to the Australian National Team, representing the Boomers at three Olympic Games (2004,2008, 2016), to returning to play in the NBL in 2018, Bogut has flown the flag for the country in the States, while leading the development of a basketball culture Down Under.\n\nIt's hard to pick just one Bogey moment from over the years, but this 2013 poster jam over JaVale McGee always stands out.\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs."
