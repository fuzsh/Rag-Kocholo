        "text": "Pistons Player Value\n\nContribution by M. Jones\n\nI have always been fascinated by NBA contracts and evaluating if players are worth the money they receive. NBA GM’s are considered to be some the biggest suckers when it comes down to paying free agents and ‘star’ players to come to their towns (with exception to the Yankees of the baseball world who are not subject to salary cap limitations). My opinion has been fading on Joe Dumars, current Detroit Pistons General Manager. (https://motownmeltdown.wordpress.com/tag/joe-dumars-draft-day-analysis/) I wanted to see how his 2014 contracts (via Hoopshype.com) look at the current moment based on stat production (via ESPN.com) to determine which players are of the best value to the organization and the paying fans. I developed a formula (Value to Date) that considers the contributions made per game based on average per game stats and the pay check received per games (82 game season). The list below is in order from the most valuable to the least.\n\nKEY:\n\nM-Minutes, P-Points, R-Rebounds, A-Assists, S-Steals, B-Blocks and T-Turnovers\n\nNet Contribution – Sum of points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game, less turnovers.\n\nValue to Date – The way this works is the LOWER (VTD) the number the HIGHER the value per dollar that the player contributes on a per game basis. Calculated by dividing the per game salary by the net contribution.\n\n[Information below presents the Value Ranking, Player Name, 2014 Salary, Remaining Years Under Contract and Per Game Salary]\n\n1 – Kyle Singler – $1,045,000 – 1 more year at $1.1M – Per Game $12,744\n\nStats – Games Played-39, MPG-23.8, PPG-8.5, RBP-3.5, APG-0.6, SPG-0.4, BPG-0.5 and TPG-0.9 – Net Contribution – 12.6 – Value to Date – $1,011\n\n2 – Andre Drummond – $2,462,400 – 3 more years between $2.6-$4.4M – Per Game $30,029\n\nStats – Games Played-39, MPG-32.6, PPG-12.7, RBP-12.7, APG-0.4, SPG-1.4, BPG-1.9 and TPG-1.4 – Net Contribution – 27.70 – Value to Date – $1,084\n\n3 – Josh Harrellson – $884,293 – 1 more year at $948K – Per Game $10,784\n\nStats – Games Played-28, MPG-9.5, PPG-3.0, RBP-2.1, APG-0.5, SPG-0.2, BPG-0.5 and TPG-0.3 – Net Contribution – 6.0 – Value to Date – $1,797\n\n4 – Greg Monroe – $4,086,453 – 1 more year at $5.5M – Per Game $49,835\n\nStats – Games Played-39, MPG-32.3, PPG-14.5, RBP-8.8, APG-1.9, SPG-1.9 BPG-0.5 and TPG-2.2 – Net Contribution – 25.40 – Value to Date – $1,962\n\n5 – Will Bynum – $2,790,343 – 1 more at $2.9M – Per Game $34,029\n\nStats – Games Played-23, MPG-18.8, PPG-8.5, RBP-2.0, APG-2.8, SPG-0.8, BPG-0.2 and TPG-1.8 – Net Contribution – 12.5 – Value to Date – $2,722\n\n6 – Kentavious Caldwell-Pope – $2,653,080 – 4 more years between $2.8-$5M – Per Game $32,355\n\nStats – Games Played-37, MPG-24.3, PPG-7.3, RBP-2.2, APG-0.9, SPG-1.0, BPG-0.1 and TPG-0.4 – Net Contribution – 11.1 – Value to Date – $2,915\n\n7 – Brandon Jennings – $7,655,503 – 2 more years between $8-$8.3M – Per Game $93,360\n\nStats – Games Played-37, MPG-36.1, PPG-16.5, RBP-3.3, APG-8.4, SPG-1.54, BPG-0.08 and TPG-3.2 – Net Contribution – 26.62 – Value to Date – $3,507\n\n8 – GiGi Datome – $1,750,000 – 1 more year at $1.75 – Per Game $21,341\n\nStats – Games Played-21, MPG-7.7, PPG-3.0, RBP-0.4, APG-0.8, SPG-1.2, BPG-0.3 and TPG-0.2 – Net Contribution – 5.50 – Value to Date – $3,880\n\n9 – Chauncey Billups – $2,500,000 – 1 more year at $2.5M – Per Game $30,488\n\nStats – Games Played-18, MPG-16.7, PPG-3.9, RBP-1.5, APG-2.2, SPG-0.4, BPG-0.06 and TPG-1.3 – Net Contribution – 6.76 – Value to Date – $4,510\n\n10 – Tony Mitchell – $490,180 – 2 more between $816-$947K – Per Game $5,978\n\nStats – Games Played-10, MPG-3.7, PPG-1.1, RBP-1.1, APG-0.1, SPG-0.1, BPG-0.2 and TPG-0.2 – Net Contribution – 1.3 – Value to Date – $4,598\n\n11 – Rodney Stuckey – $8,500,000 – Final year of deal – Per Game $103,569\n\nStats – Games Played-31, MPG-25.0, PPG-13.6, RBP-2.2, APG-2.0, SPG-0.9, BPG-0.2 and TPG-1.2 – Net Contribution – 17.52 – Value to Date – $5,911\n\n12 – Josh Smith – $14,000,000 – 3 more years at $14M – Per Game $170,732\n\nStats – Games Played-38, MPG-34.9, PPG-15.3, RBP-6.9, APG-3.4, SPG-1.5, BPG-1.5 and TPG-2.5 – Net Contribution – 26.10 – Value to Date – $6,541\n\n13 – Peyton Siva – $490,180 – 1 more year at $816K – Per Game $5,978\n\nStats – Games Played-13, MPG-5.8, PPG-0.3, RBP-0.6, APG-0.6, SPG-0.2, BPG-0.1 and TPG-1.0 – Net Contribution – 0.8 – Value to Date – $7,473\n\n14 – Jonas Jerebko – $4,500,000 – 1 more year at $4.5M – Per Game $54,878\n\nStats – Games Played-26, MPG-8.1, PPG-3.6, RBP-1.7, APG-0.4, SPG-0.3, BPG-0.08 and TPG-0.8 – Net Contribution – 5.28 – Value to Date – $10,390\n\n15 – Charlie Villanueva – $8,580,000 – Final year of deal – Per Game $104,634\n\nStats – Games Played-13, MPG-9.1, PPG-4.8, RBP-1.6, APG-0.4, SPG-0.2, BPG-0.3 and TPG-0.5 – Net Contribution – 6.8 – Value to Date – $15,387\n\nAt the end of the day, it looks like the ‘bucket man’ is the most valuable player on the roster based on how much the paying fans are donating to the team.\n\nOh, and Charlie V we see you failing all the way at the bottom.\n\nTo make the data above comparable across the league, i scanned the NBA and decided to compute a few more. Some good values out there, and it looks like anywhere under $6K or so is usually a pretty strong value for a team. And for fun i had to have Ben Gordon (yes Joe D gave him that deal).\n\nPlayer Team 2014 Salary Per Game Salary NC VTD 1 Michael Carter-Williams Philadelphia $2.2 $26,841 29.07 $923 2 Paul George Indiana $3.3 $40,024 32.53 $1,230 3 Avery Bradley Boston $2.5 $30,627 19.99 $1,532 4 Klay Thompson Golden State $3.3 $39,575 24.1 $1,642 5 Kyrie Irving Cleveland $5.9 $72,144 29.43 $2,451 6 Kevin Love Minnesota $14.7 $179,194 41.14 $4,356 7 James Harden Houston $13.7 $166,692 32.69 $5,099 8 Kevin Durant Oklahoma City $18.8 $228,941 42.63 $5,370 9 Joe Johnson Brooklyn $21.5 $261,789 21.73 $12,047 10 Ben Gordon Charlotte $13.2 $160,976 7.45 $21,607\n\nContribution by: Trevor Parnell\n\nThe 2013-14 Michigan Wolverines basketball season has been a wild ride so far for a wide variety of reasons. Expectations were high at the start of the season, especially when you factor in that the Wolverines would return the 2013 NCAA Tourney beast Mitch McGary and a hell of an athlete, and future lottery pick, in Glen Robinson III. They were also coming off an appearance in the national championship game where they fought a very tough Louisville Cardinals to the final whistle. Michigan fans had a lot to be excited about with the future of this program. Then… Trey Burke and Timmy Hardaway Jr. took their talents to the NBA and all of the sudden, the backcourt in Ann Arbor went from one of the most sought after in the country, to a huge question mark.\n\nBefore we get into this season, I want to give a huge shoutout to John Belein. He has built this program from the shit that Tommy Amaker left him with into a perennial Big Ten contender. This school is no longer a football school. Back in the Amaker days, if talented players like Burke and Hardaway were to leave, it would cripple the program for years. But, not Beilein. He locked, and reloaded, and here come Derrick Walton and Zak Irvin. The art of recruiting in college basketball sometimes goes under appreciated, but I will tell you right now I think Mr. B is a damn genius and I would give my first born to him for revitalizing a basketball program that has gone through some awful awful years before his tenure.\n\nLast year’s Michigan basketball team was built around Burke and Hardaway, a terrific 1-2 backcourt punch that could score in bunches. Many people forget that the emergence of McGary really did not come to fruition until late in the season/ early in the Big Ten tournament. This year, the team is in a completely different place. Let’s take a look at each team and the position they were in at this point in the season:\n\n2012-13 Wolverines (Overall Record 16-0, Big Ten 3-0)\n\nAt this point last season, Trey Burke was dominating bitches and crossing up everybody he could. (Word has it he would carry around a basketball on the street and perform crossover moves on anybody he could find, kids, adults, women. I also may have just made that up, but you are still reading, so who’s the asshole now?) Nik Stauskas, ohhhh Cannaaddaaa, was making waves on Youtube with his unbelievable 3 point shooting skills and putting that skill set to work on the court, and McGary was starting to separate himself from the upper classmen bigs, and was pushing for starters minutes. This team was on a roll, without a blunder on the record to date. Part of this had to do with a soft non-conference schedule, with the most difficult tests being wins over NC State Kansas State, and Arkansas. Solid wins, but not enough to really define a team. It ended up working out, because we all know how this season ended, but at the time, all Michigan fans were a little unsure of just how good this squad was.\n\n2013-14 Wolverines (Overall Record 12-4, Big Ten 4-0)\n\nMidway through the season, this squad has been through a lot. I’ll start with Mitch McGary. God, I wish this guy was healthy. His NCAA Tournament performances, only at the end of last year, were so good I got blue balls just thinking of how good he was going to be this year. With him and GR III controlling the boards, this team was looking ready for another run at a B1G title. But then came the back issues. McGary could never really get into a rhythm and eventually had to call it quits for the year and get back surgery. This was a HUGE blow to the squad. It has forced Jon Horford and Jordan Morgan into starter minutes, and put more pressure onto GR III to perform at a high level. After the injury, the thought of Horford and his stupid dumbo ears flopping around the court for 25 minutes per game made me want to punch an infant. However, the performance of both Horford and Morgan thus far has been better than expected. On the flip side, the injury to McGary has allowed some other players to emerge. Derrick Walton was given the tall order of “replacing” Trey Burke. Well, everybody knew he wasn’t going to be Trey Day but the maturity level of Walton has gone from frantic Freshman at the start of the year to cool cucumber in recent games. He seems to have a hold of this offense now and looks to be primed for some breakout games in the near future. Also, Zak Irvin and Nik Stauskas have been great. Irvin has become a solid guy off the bench, and his scoring is coming around, as evidenced by his 16 points against Minnesota a couple weeks back. Stauskas has been flat out awesome. He is leading the team with 17.7 PPG, is shooting 45% from long range, and has taken on a leadership role it seems. This team is definitely starting to gel at the right time and with Walton, Stauskas, Irvin, and Caris Levert (should have mentioned more about how much he has improved) holding down the back court, and GR III, Horford, and Morgan banging down low (no sexual inuendo intended) this team looks like it could actually challenge for the B1G title once again. A tough non-conference schedule featuring road games against Iowa State (soo tough to win there), Florida State, @ Duke, and a 2 point loss at home to the #1 team in the country, Arizona, were character builders and even the losses are teachable moments for a team filled with young guys playing big minutes.\n\nThis year’s Michigan team is NOT last year’s team. It is full of young guys who are still figuring out their college ball strengths, rather than seasoned names like Burke and Hardaway. The next three games are when we really get to see what this team is made of. Michigan goes on the road today against a hungry Wisconsin team coming off a loss to Indiana. Then they host a vastly improved Iowa team, and then prep for a showdown in East Lansing. These guys are going to learn a lot about themselves in the next week and it will go a long way to determining the success they have come March. After all of the ups and downs between the end of last year’s tourney run and this midway point of the season, the immediate future of Michigan basketball looks pretty bright.\n\nContribution by: Zach Ficht\n\nWith the college hoops season in full swing we here at MotownMeltdown thought it was time to take an in depth look at what’s what in one of the nation’s most feared conferences: The B1G. I would like to say that we’ll have an updated version each week but come on, let’s be real the chances of that happening are about as good as Bo Ryan not scaring children when he walks down the street…not good. And for the record, each week (relative term) we will be unveiling the rankings from 12-1, because if TNT taught me anything it’s that I know drama. And the team limping to the barn this week is drum roll please….\n\n12. Nebraska –Conf–0-4 Overall (8-8)\n\nThe Cornhuskers are still trying to find their place in the bruising B1G. Nebraska, led by third year head coach Tim Miles remain winless in conference play and have frankly played underwhelming ball so far this season. To their credit, the start of conference play wasn’t kind to Big Red as they opened up on the road against the Hawkeyes and Ohio State. It appeared that they might’ve eked out a win against Michigan but a last second effort fell short handing Nebraska its fourth straight loss. (Their losing streak currently sits at five.) They have some playmakers, in the likes of Terran Petteway a 6’-6” monster giving Miles 17 points and 5 boards a game, and 3 point shooter Ray Gallegos who’s already banged home 31 one trey balls on the year. But the complimentary pieces are still missing. At this point, it appears that the fans in Lincoln will have to endure yet another rebuilding year as Nebraska tries to find its niche in this challenge conference. But still look for this team to compete with and even knock off a top tier team or two in their newly opened Pinnacle Bank Arena which provides a rock solid college bball atmosphere despite a subpar product on the court.\n\nNext Up: #11 Ohio State (Jan. 20) 7pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n11. Penn State–Conf–0-5 Overall-(9-9)\n\nThe Nittany Lions get the nod over Nebraska for the 11th spot based on the fact that, although their winless, Penn State has at least looked competitive during their five game skid. Tim Frazier and DJ Newbill are doing all that they can for this squad but unfortunately it takes an entire team effort to win in this conference and while this team has shown flashes of that potential (two straight three point losses before playing Michigan) they have yet to put it into play for a full 40 minutes. Head coach Pat Chambers needs to figure it out soon, because come June, Frazier might be taking his ball and heading to the NBA; not an ideal situation for an already razor thin roster. A showdown will fellow cellar dweller Nebraska is set for January 23rd in the Bryce Jordan Arena. So if for nothing else, I’m sure Chambers will have his boys ready to play at least for prides sake. A couple of wins and this team could get rolling however, as Penn State only has to play two more ranked teams away from Happy Valley. (Michigan State and Ohio State). Confidence can go a long way, see Michigan game from last year. Don’t sleep on the Lions just yet.\n\nNext Up: @Purdue (Jan. 18) 7pm\n\nTV-ESPNU/WatchESPN\n\n10. Northwestern–Conf-1-4 Overall (8-10)\n\nFormer head coach Bill Carmody, was never quite up to the task of leading the Wildcats to the big dance and so far in his first year at the helm new Coach Chris Collins doesn’t seem to have the 2013-14 team any closer to achieving that goal. Fresh off their upset of Illinois, an impressive confidence building win, the Wildcats ran into the buzz saw that is the Michigan State Spartans. Senior leader Drew Crawford is finally healthy and playing some great ball (leads the team in points and rebounds) but there is just not enough talent in Evanston to compete in this conference. This is a Northwestern team that relies heavily on perimeter shooting which can be a dicey game to play when you don’t have the size down low to gobble up the rebounds on an off shooting night. As we saw in their last game this is a team that can and will get pushed around by the stronger more physical teams in the B1G.\n\nNext Up: @Indiana (Jan. 18) 2:30pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n9. Purdue–Conf-2-2 Overall-(12-5)\n\nPurdue finds themselves right in the thick of the B1G ten race four games into conference play. After dropping their first two contests, the Boiler makers appear to have found some solid ground; winning back to back games over Nebraska and Illinois. The Johnson brothers (Terone and Ronnie) are continuing to lead the way for Purdue, anchored by the their 7’ sophomore center A.J. Hammons who is fresh off of his Big Ten All-Freshmen team selection a year ago. Purdue has looked tough in each of their two losses in B1G play, and the schedule appears to set up nicely for them (only have to play MSU once, bonus) in the second half of the year. This team can score the rock and can rebound as evidenced by their nearly 40 boards a game average. That total trails only Michigan State, Indiana, and Iowa in conference play respectively. As the season marches on, a trip up to West Lafayette looks less and less inviting.\n\nNext Up: Penn State (Jan. 18) 7:00pm\n\nTV-ESPNU/WatchESPN\n\n8. Illinois–Conf-2-3 Overall- (13-5)\n\nThe start of B1G play has not been kind to the Illini. A soft non-conference schedule helped John Groce’s squad race out to an 11-2 record but after a solid conference opening win on their home floor against Indiana, Illinois has dropped three out of their last four B1G games, including back to back choke jobs against Northwestern and Purdue (the latter in Champagne). The loss of both Brandon Paul and Meyers Leonard to the NBA left a gaping hole on this roster but Junior transfer Rayvonte Rice who leads the squad in scoring (second in the B1G) will look to help right the ship before things gets too out of hand. However, the schedule doesn’t get any easier for the Illini as Illinois’s next five games feature four ranked opponents including trips to Columbus and Bloomington, while hosting perennial powers Michigan State and Wisconsin.\n\nNext Up: #4 Michigan State (Jan. 18) 8pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n7. Indiana–Conf-2-2 Overall- (12-5)\n\nIndiana is off to a better start to B1G play than many of their fans would like to admit. Coming in, this was somewhat of a “hybrid-rebuilding” year. When you have to replace two first round NBA draft picks including the defending B1G defensive player of the year in Cody Zeller and Victor Oladipo it’s going to be a bit tough. But to Tom Crean’s credit he has the Hoosiers playing some competitive ball as of late. A court storming worthy upset win over the Badgers earlier this week was backed by an impressive 25 pt performance from PG Yogi Ferrell. The in-game benching by Coach Crean for poor shot selection early in the second half really seemed to light a fire under Ferrell and the Hoosiers, backed by the raucous crowd that packed Assembly hall, IU was able to hand Wisconsin their first loss of the season. And don’t be mistaken; despite the losses of Oladipo and Zeller, plus Christian Watford and hometown favorite Jordon Hulls this is a Hoosier team that is still stacked with talent. Senior leader Will Sheehey is IU’s spark plug that can hit the open jumper and also take it to the rack for the crowd pleasing slam. Ferrell is the sniper who can handle the ball in crunch time, but the stud of this group is the 6-10 freshmen forward Noah Vonleh. Vonleh is easily the most NBA ready player under Crean’s tutelage, averaging nearly a double double (12 pts/9 reb) so far in his first year in Bloomington. There are still some questions that need to be answered, but as we’ve seen already this team has a flair for the dramatics so anything could be possible.\n\nNext Up: Northwestern (Jan. 18) 2:30pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n6. Minnesota–Conf-3-2 Overall-(14-4)\n\nNew Coach Richard Pitino appears to be following the blueprint left by former headman Tubby Smith, except this time the Gophers are winning in the non-conference AND in B1G play. After losing a late lead to Michigan State and eventually losing in overtime in East Lansing last week, Minnesota was able to regroup and put together a complete game in front of their home crowd to knock off the #11 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes. Minnesota, in recent years has been a team that many perceived underachieved in both regular and postseason play, which ultimately led to the dismissal of Tubby. However, there’s a new sheriff in town with a familiar name in the college basketball scene. Richard Pitino, the son of legendary coach Rick, has brought with him a more fast paced offense and even some new pieces in the form of Junior transfer Deandre Mathieu (Central Arizona State) and freshman recruit Daquein McNeil (Vermont Academy). It doesn’t hurt that, both Andre and Austin Hollins are still roaming the back court in Minneapolis chipping in 15 and 11 points a game apiece. A more transition oriented offense has allowed Minnesota to position themselves in the middle of the B1G race. But we’ve seen this same story before; don’t go awarding them anything just yet. It only gets tougher from here.\n\nNext Up: @Iowa (Jan. 19) 1:00pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n5. Ohio State–Conf-2-3 Overall-(15-3)\n\nAfter winning their first 15 games and ascending all the way to #3 in the country, the Buckeyes have since lost their last three game games; the latest at the hands of Minnesota after a woeful shooting (35% from the floor) and all around offensive performance. The loss of Deshaun Thomas to the NBA left this team without a true scorer and while the Buckeyes remain one of the stingiest defensive teams in the country; if they can’t score the basketball with any regularity it’s going to be a challenge each and every night in this conference. Senior Aaron Craft is the undisputed leader of this team and continues to play his style of hustle basketball night in and night out. But so far in conference play that has not been enough. LaQuinton Ross is doing the majority of the scoring for this squad (14 ppg) and the recent disappearing act of Lenzelle Smith Jr. only compounds the problem. Thad Matta needs to find his go to scorer before they tumble any further, but the good news for the Buckeyes is that a trip to Nebraska is next on the docket, and while there are no freebies in this league look for the Scarlet and Grey to get back on track with a dominating win.\n\nNext Up: @Nebraska (Jan 20.) 7pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n4. Michigan–Conf-4-0 Overall-(12-4)\n\nDespite losing the player of the year in Trey Burke and Junior guard Tim Hardaway oh and don’t forget about the loss of preseason All-American and NCAA Tournament beast Mitch McGary, the Wolverines remain undefeated in B1G play. Their 4-0 mark has a lot to do with their favorable conference schedule so far (biggest test being a road win over Minnestoa), but Big Blue has found ways to win and already has two conference road victories under their belt. The emergence of Sophomore Guard Nik Stauskas and Freshman Derek Walton has been instrumental to their early success. Stauskas has been able to find ways to penetrate and score from inside the three point line while, Walton has been learning how to run Beilein’s offense. That offense preaches ball control and Michigan has been better than most in taking care of the rock averaging fewer than 10 turnovers a game. When looking at this team’s production, the presence of both Jordan Morgan and Jon Horford can’t be ignored. So far both big men have been up to the task in replacing McGary and while they won’t be able to replace his energy or overall talent they can play their roles as needed. The defensive questions that surround this team are legitimate as can be seen from past performances like the Nebraska game; a 71-70 shootout where no one could stop anybody but so far they have skated by. The true tests are coming and Michigan is entering a three game stretch that includes games against the likes of Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan State. When the dust settles, we’ll know if these defensive concerns are now fully fledged problems.\n\nNext Up: @#3 Wisconsin (Jan. 18) 6:00pm\n\nTV-ESPN/WatchESPN\n\n3. Iowa–Conf-3-1 Overall- (14-3)\n\nThis Iowa team is rolling and unlike in previous seasons under Head Coach Fran McCaffery, moral victories are now becoming actual victories. Led by Senior Roy Devyn Marble and junior guard Aaron White, Iowa currently leads the conference in points per game (86) and rebounding (44). Even despite a rather embarrassing on the court tantrum directed at an official, Fran McCaffrey has got his boys playing top tier basketball. The Hawkeyes have been so close to the big dance in recent years that they could taste it. Now with the development of Marble who’s contributing 16 pts per game they seem to be on the right track to finally cracking the field of 68. Their recent win over the Buckeyes in Columbus has this team’s confidence in a good place and with other complimentary pieces like senior Melsahn Basabe shooting a 56% clip this team could be scary good. Success in conference play is new for this Iowa team, but from what we’ve seen already from McCaffrey I don’t think they are celebrating anything yet.\n\nNext Up: Minnesota (Jan.19) 1:00pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\n2. Wisconsin–Conf-3-1 Overall-(16-1)\n\nThe Badgers are the epitome of B1G basketball. They are big, strong and will grind you down forcing you to play their brand of basketball: slow. Led by stellar head coach Bo Ryan, this year’s Badgers team has a bit of a different look to them. The most glaring thing that stands out if you’re an opposing team is that while Wisconsin is still taking care of the basketball (leading the nation in fact with 8.3 turnovers per game), their offensive output is up 11 points from last season. Beating Wisconsin just got a little bit tougher, not that it was ever easy. UW got out to their best start in program history starting 16-0 before losing at Indiana and currently sits at #3 in the country. That number will likely change when the new polls come out next week, but I don’t’ seem them dropping out of the top ten. This is a big lineup that frequently causes matchup problems with the undersized teams in this conference. And it should be noted that the Badgers aren’t just big, they can shoot and shoot well; all five starters are currently shooting at 35% or above from behind the arc. Yikes. Losing anyone of the Badgers starters in transition will cost you dearly, and in the half court they are a patient club. They work to get the shot they want and as you’ve just found out, they will typically knock that shot down. The thing with Wisconsin is that dominating in conference play is what the Badgers do (under Bo Ryan UW has never finished worse than fourth in B1G play). The trouble lies in tournament time and only time will tell if this is the year Bo and Co. is ready to make a deep run.\n\nNext Up: Michigan (Jan. 18) 6:00pm\n\nTV-ESPN/WatchESPN\n\n1. Michigan State–Conf-5-0 Overall-(16-1)\n\nThere must be something in the water up in East Lansing, or it could just be that Tom Izzo continues to be one of the elite coaches in the country as he consistently gets the most out of his players. State fields a veteran squad, led by the likes of Seniors Adreian Payne and Keith Appling. Payne has been battling a foot injury for most of the season but is still finding a way to get into the lineup and contribute. He along with Branden Dawson make up two of the top five players in the B1G in defensive rebounding, a staple of any good Izzo led team. Sophomore guard Gary Harris has NBA level talent, and can score from anywhere on the floor, currently averaging 17 points per game. Contributions from Travis Trice and Denzel Valentine have also been essential in the Spartans early season success. Like Wisconsin, this is a team that can shoot the basketball from beyond the arc: Payne, Appling and Trice all post a shooting percentage of 42% or above. This team has the size and physicality to allow them to adapt their game plan on any given night. Backed by their great home crowd that consistently fills the Breslin Center to capacity, this team is built to win now and that is exactly what they are doing.\n\nNext Up: @Illinois (Jan. 18) 8:00pm\n\nTV-Big Ten Network\n\nContribution by M. Jones\n\nIf you can’t tell by now, I am the basketball junkie of the group. Although this specific column does not have a Michigan sports focus, it encompasses both college hoops and the NBA.\n\nIt doesn’t seem that long ago that everyone in the basketball was salivating at the idea of the upcoming NBA draft class, even leading some top ‘experts’ to call it potentially THE best ever. Everyone seemed to be of the belief that the top freshmen in the country were going to absolutely dominate the college hoops scene in route to dominating the top 10 of the draft. NBA GM’s started to value the picks in the 2014 draft as the best assets they could acquire and clearly the bottom feeders of the league were set on tanking to get as many lottery balls as possible (just take a look at the Eastern conference standings).\n\nTeams that have accumulated multiple picks in the 1st round:\n\nOrlando Magic – 2; Philadelphia 76ers – 2; Boston Celtics – 2; Utah Jazz – 2; Charlotte Bobcats – 2 [Joe D says you’re welcome]; Phoenix Suns – 3 and OKC Thunder – 2\n\nLet me reiterate that, this is for the first round. That means 15 of the 30 picks are owned by 7 teams. The Pistons will not have a first round pick, because Dumars traded the rights to the pick a few years back.\n\nNow that we are a few months into the season, i thought it was worth taking a look into how the top fifteen (aka the ‘freshman 15’) freshman prospects (all 5 star recruits per the respected sites) playing college hoops right now to see if teams should keep ‘Riggin for Wiggins’ after all to turn their franchises around.\n\nPoint Guards\n\nAndre Harrison – 6’5″ – Kentucky [Team Record 12-3, #13 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 10.9 PPG; 2.8 Rebs; 3.3 Assists; 38% FG – [Part 1 of the duo that the Jones bros wish we could have been]\n\nKasey Hill – 6’5″ – Florida [Team Record 13-2, #7 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 7.2 PPG; 1.9 Rebs; 3.4 Assists; 41% FG\n\nTyler Ennis – 6’2″ – Syracuse [Team Record 17-0, #2 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 11.6 PPG; 3.2 Rebs; 5.6 Assists; 42% FG\n\nShooting Guards\n\nAaron Harrison – 6’5″ – Kentucky [Team Record 12-3, #13 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 14.0 PPG; 3.3 Rebs; 2.3 Assists; 45% FG – [Part 2 of that brother duo]\n\nWayne Selden – 6’5″ – Kansas [Team Record 12-4, #15 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 10.1 PPG; 2.8 Rebs; 2.4 Assists; 48% FG\n\nZach Irvin – 6’6″ – Michigan [Team Record 11-4, Unranked (not for long)]\n\nStats – 8.0 PPG; 2.4 Rebs; 2.8 Assists; 43% FG\n\nSmall Forwards\n\nAndrew Wiggins – 6’7″ Kansas [Team Record 12-4, #15 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 15.8 PPG; 6.3 Rebs; 1.5 Assists; 45% FG – [Not bad for a Canadian]\n\nJabari Parker – 6’8″ – Duke [Team Record 13-4, #23 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 18.8 PPG; 7.3 Rebs; 1.5 Assists; 49% FG – [This dude is bringing all the Duke girls to the yard]\n\nJames Young – 6’6″- Kentucky [Team Record 12-3, #13 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 14.1 PPG; 4.5 Rebs; 2.2 Assists; 38% FG – [Sleeper of the group]\n\nPower Forwards\n\nJulius Randle – 6’9″ – Kentucky [Team Record 12-3, #13 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 16.7 PPG; 10.9 Rebs; 1.5 Assists; 54% FG – [Do it all post player]\n\nAaron Gordon – 6’8″ – Arizona [Team Record 17-0, #1 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 12.2 PPG; 7.9 Rebs; 1.4 Assists; 50% FG – [Starting to create a stir among GMs, but I am not sold just yet]\n\nNoah Vonleh – 6’9″ – Indiana [Team Record 12-5, Unranked]\n\nStats – 12.3 PPG; 9.3 Rebs; 0.6 Assists; 55% FG\n\nCenters\n\nChris Walker – 6’10” – Florida\n\nStats – 0.0 – INELIGIBLE [Too much of the choo choo, not enough of the library]\n\nDakari Johnson – 6’10” – Kentucky [Team Record 12-3, #13 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 9.6 PPG; 3.9 Rebs; 2.9 Assists; 54% FG\n\nJoel Embiid – 7’0″ – Kansas [Team Record 12-4, #15 in the AP Poll]\n\nStats – 10.9 PPG; 7.4 Rebs; 1.4 Assists; 68% FG [Embiid is starting to cause a stir that suggests he may be the #1 pick.

When i think of the elite freshman players over the past decade or so, there have truly been some amazing players who absolutely dominated play while they were getting an education (cough, running trains on campus, cough). Below are the freshman stats during their fantastic runs to help put the stats above into context.\n\nKevin Durant – 6’9″ Small Forward, Texas [2006-2007] – KD turned in the one of the most impressive seasons of all time in the NCAA, let alone for a freshman. I can still remember where i was watching some of his classic games, and being in awe. Obviously, his game transitioned well in the NBA where he has won multiple scoring titles and is one LBJ away from his first NBA ring.\n\nFreshman Stats – 25.8 PPG; 11.1 Rebs; 1.3 Assists; 47% FG\n\nCarmelo Anthony – 6’8″ Power Forward, Syracuse [2002-2003] – Melo was truly elite in his one season as a freshman at the ‘Cuse as his numbers show and not to mention…he cut down the nets and was a National Champion. No one else on the list can claim that, and it is yet to be seen if anyone on the current list will match that feat.\n\nFreshman Stats – 22.2 PPG; 10.0 Rebs; 2.2 Assists; 45% FG\n\nDerrick Rose – 6’3″ Point Guard, Memphis [2007-2008] – Although he ‘may’ have paid someone to take his SAT to get into college (allegedly!), Rose dominated the college scene in his only year and went on to become the best PG in the NBA (not counting the past 2 years where his mental health is really healing slowly.\n\nFreshman Stats – 14.9 PPG; 4.5 Rebs; 4.7 Assists; 48% FG\n\nKyrie Irving – 6’2″ Point Guard, Duke [2010-2011] – Kyrie was injured for a significant portion of his only season in college ball, but he showed major flashes when he was able to get on the court and has elevated his game each season in the league. And who doesn’t love Uncle Drew?! He and Knoxville should team up in a bad grandpa sequel.\n\nFreshman Stats – 17.5 PPG; 3.4 Rebs; 4.3 Assists; 53% FG\n\nJohn Wall – 6’4″ Point Guard, Kentucky [2009-2010] – John Wall was excellent at Kentucky and was a walking meme. Wall drew equal amount of fans and haters, but it’s tough to doubt his raw talent. That one is for you T. Parnell.\n\nFreshman Stats – 16.6 PPG; 4.3 Rebs; 6.5 Assists; 46% FG\n\nGreg Oden – 7’0” Center, Ohio State [2006-2007] – Reverse Benjamin Button himself was a dominant force in college when he could stay on the court and avoid the daunting 5th foul. It’s a shame he has never been healthy in the league.\n\nFreshman Stats – 15.7 PPG; 9.6 Rebs; 0.7 Assists; 62% FG\n\nLuoel Deng – 6’8″ Small Forward, Duke [2003-2004] – Deng went on down to Duke and was rare find for the college game as International recruits were not very common. Strange that Coach K has had two one-and-done players on the list as he typically has not played the Calipari card often.\n\nFreshman Stats – 15.1 PPG; 6.9 Rebs; 1.8 Assists; 48% FG\n\nKevin Love – 6’10” Power Forward, UCLA [2007-2008] – K love was a beast at UCLA and i think it’s safe to say he has exceeded all expectations at the pro level.\n\nFreshman Stats – 17.5 PPG; 10.6 Rebs; 1.9 Assists; 56% FG\n\nChris Bosh – 6’10” Power Forward, G Tech [2002-2003] – Bosh had many GM’s thinking hard in the loaded 2003 draft class based on his potential and raw ability. Many seem to forget that he was a legit star in Toronto before playing 3rd wheel for D Wade and Bron Bron in south beach. Probably because of images like this have been burned into the brains of the public. Dude is SUPER suspect – ‘Not that there’s anything wrong with that’ to quote Seinfeld.\n\nFreshman Stats – 15.6 PPG; 9.0 Rebs; 1.2 Assists; 56% FG\n\nAND\n\nLebron James – 6’8″, Small Forward – Straight 2 the League – I know i know, he doesn’t fit the criteria but with all the Wiggins comparisons and overreactions i thought it was proper to mention this man posted 20/5/5 as a rookie in the league. I don’t see any of these guys doing that next season.\n\nRookie Stats – 20.9 PPG; 5.5 Rebs; 5.9 Assists; 42% FG\n\nShit, who knows i may be wrong in the long run but we will have to wait and see. I will revisit this at the end of the season as part of the NBA mock draft discussions and see if I end up being wrong. For now, it’s clear i am a genius!\n\nContribution by M. Jones\n\nPeriodic National NBA Update\n\nPart 1: Judging NBA teams for the championship race like girls at the bar\n\nTo put the current NBA landscape into perspective for the average dude, i compared all 30 teams to something we can all relate to – a good night out at the bar looking for some poo-nani. For reference of how Vegas views each team’s chances, i added the current Vegas odds to win the NBA championship as of today (via bovada.lv). Also, I included the X factor for each team in the top 3 tiers for why they can win it all and the most likely reason they won’t, respectively.\n\n1-The Dime – The obvious standouts of the group. Put away your fear boner, fellas. Think Sloan from Entourgae.\n\nMiami (2:1) [27-10, 2nd in the East] – They have the best player in the world, King James; No team has made 4 straight finals appearances since the 1980’s.\n\nIndiana (7:2) [29-7, 1st in the East] – Paul George is elevating his game to an elite level; May not have enough steam to take on the western conference champion.\n\nSpurs (7:1) [29-8, 1st in the West] – Experience and track record, Pop knows how to win flat out; Every year we think is this the year age catches up to them.\n\nThunder (13:2) [28-9, Tied for 2nd in the West] – KD will get a ring; Will Westbrook stay healthy?\n\nPortland (16:1) [28-9, Tied for 2nd in the West] – Ton of talent really coming together nicely, Lilliard is a star; Have not been tested in the big moments with this core.\n\n2-The Cool Cute Chick – May be worth a shot on a good day.\n\nClippers (9:1) [26-13, 4th in the West] – CP3 and Doc know how to win; Not convinced Blake and DeAndre will get a ring together.\n\nRockets (16:1) [24-24, 6th in the West] – Harden is an elite player and Howard has had a resurgence; Howard will foul out of multiple big games and Harden won’t be able to carry this team past the Spurs, Thunder and Blazers of the NBA world.\n\n3-The Hot N Stupid – You don’t want to waste time or put faith into them but on some nights it’s hard to resist believing.\n\nWarriors (14:1) [25-14, 5th in the West] – Curry and Thompson are incredible shooters and on any night they can shoot their way to a win; Any night they can also shoot their way out of a win (JR Smith syndrome).\n\n4-The Personality, Just Not the Looks – Still missing something that retains much interest.\n\nTwolves (75:1) [18-19, 10th in the West, 3.5 games out of the playoffs]\n\nDenver (66:1) [19-17, 9th in the West, 2 games out of the playoffs]\n\nRaptors (75:1) [18-17, 4th in the East]\n\nDallas (50:1) [22-16, 8th in the West]\n\nMemphis (66:1) [17-19, 11th in the West, 4 games out of the playoffs]\n\n5-The How Much is My Tab at 2 am?! How is that possible? The 5 who looks like a 7 at the Moment – This is where it gets real messy. Avoid if possible.\n\nPistons (150:1) [16-22, 7th in the East]\n\nSuns (100:1) [21-15, 7th in the West]\n\nNets (40:1) [15-22, 8th in the East]\n\nKnicks (50:1) [14-22, 10th in the East, Half game out of playoffs]\n\n6-The Horrible Decision – Need a friend to talk you down from this group at all costs.\n\nOrlando (500:1) [10-27, 14th in the East, 5 games out of the playoffs]\n\nBulls (50:1) [17-18, 5th in the East]\n\nHornets (250:1) [15-21, 12th in the West, 6 games out of the playoffs]\n\nPhilly (300:1) [12-25, 13th in the East]\n\nWashington (100:1) [16-19, 6th in the East]\n\nKings (1000:1) [13-22, 14th in the West, 7.5 games out of the playoffs]\n\nBoston (150:1) [13-25, 12th in the East, 2.5 games out of playoffs]\n\nAtlanta (75:1) [20-18, 3rd in the East] – As you can see I do not think very highly of this roster. How in the hell are they in position for home court in round 1??\n\n7-The I Wouldn’t Fuck Her With Your Dick – That speaks for itself.\n\nCharlotte (300:1) [15-23, 9th in the East, Half game out of the playoffs]\n\nMilwaukee (1000:1) [7-29, 15th in the East, 5.5 games out of the playoffs]\n\nLakers (150:1) [14-23, 13th in the West, 7.5 games out of the playoffs]\n\nUtah (1000:1) [12-26, 15th in the West, 10 games out of the playoffs]\n\nCleveland (150:1) [13-24, 11th in the East, 2 games out of the playoffs]\n\nPart 2: If I Was in Vegas today with $500 that was burning a hole in my pocket\n\nThe odds included above got me thinking what if I had to bet $500 today and wanted to break even or profit based on picking the 2014 NBA champion. To include Miami in the mix, you would have to bet half the pot ($250) to break even. That and the fact a team hasn’t made 4 straight final appearances since the 1980’s lead me away from placing the money there. The other big snub in the Pacers. Even though they could be the team that stops the heat from making their 4 straight appearance in the finals, i just don’t see them having enough steam to win the whole thing. That being said, this is how i would allocate the $500 as of today based on the current Vegas odds after an all-day binge by the Flamingo pool and throughout the city. You know how i’m paying for the bet? Straight cash homie.\n\nSpurs – 7:1 – $100 to win $700 ($800 Payout)\n\nBlazers – 16:1 – $100 to win $1600 ($1700 Payout)\n\nClippers – 9:1 – $50 to win $450 ($500 Payout)\n\nThunder – 13:2 – $100 to win $650 ($750 Payout)\n\nWarriors – 14:1 – $100 to win $1400 ($1500 Payout)\n\nNets – 40:1 – $50 to win $2000 ($2,050 Payout)\n\nPart 3: Another look at the NBA’s recent nickname decision\n\nFor anyone who watched the Miami Heat Brooklyn Nets game on January 10th, you may have noticed the NBA made the decision to change the names on the jerseys from each player’s last name to their nicknames. My first thought is man was the XFL was ahead of their time or what?! Who can forget ‘He Hate Me’ from Vince McMahon’s failed football venture nearly a decade ago?\n\nWhen analyzing why the NBA would do this, my conclusion is simple. It is purely a money grab. Just wait to see how those ‘Macklemore’s Alter Ego’ jerseys (see below) start flying off the shelves in local crack houses. In the spirit of this poor decision, i decided to assess the nicknames and come up with more appropriate names given everyone’s current abilities to be more accurate.\n\nChris Andersen | Birdman – Suggested replacement name – ‘Macklemore’s Alter Ego”\n\nMichael Beasley | B Easy – Suggested replacement name – ‘Boats N Hoes’\n\nChris Bosh | CB – Suggested replacement name – ‘Juwanna Man’\n\nLeBron James | King James – I was at work, did he have a ‘decision’ conference on ESPN news to reveal his nickname? If not, shame on you ESPN. – Suggested replacement name – ‘The Decision Maker’\n\nRashard Lewis | Sweet Lew – STILL can’t believe this man received a max contract not that long ago. Insane, laughable depiction of the panic some GMs show – Suggested replacement name – ‘Got Yo Ass With the Max Contract’\n\nRay Allen | J. Shuttlesworth – This is probably the most appropriate of the names given his role in the classic ‘He Got Game’ movie. But in the spirit of the article and the still thriving beef with KG and Paul Peirce (I assume it is mostly KG because he seems like a major dick) that exists since he bailed on them for Miami – Suggested replacement name – ‘KG U Mad Bro? ‘\n\nGreg Oden | G.O. – No way this guy is really still in his mid-20’s. More breaks than trucker rest stop on I-75 and looks like LeBron’s Grandpa. Side note: Watch out for the glory hole! – Suggested replacement name – ‘Reverse Benjamin Button’\n\nDwyane Wade | D. Wade – The only male to be carted off in a wheelchair for a shoulder injury in the history of men. Wade spends more time on the bench in a suit and on the ground diving for calls than playing elite ball these days – Suggested replacement name – ‘Mr. Glass’\n\nKevin Garnett | The Big Ticket – It is crazy to me to see how much KG has fallen off from the elite player he was still just a few years back in Boston. May be time to hang it up in the next year or so. Suggested replacement name – ‘Silver Cinemas Senior Citizen Discount’\n\nJoe Johnson | JJ – With a max deal, you would expect Johnson to be a guy who the Nets could count on 24/7/365. Watch a nets play a few games, that is clearly not the case – Suggested replacement name – ‘8/2/25’ [Hours/Days a week/Days in year he is reliable]\n\nAndrei Kirilenko | Кириленко – Come on man, how is Kirilenko going to do this?? Obvious suggested replacement name – ‘AK 47’\n\nPaul Pierce | Truth – Pierce has been turned into a fade away jump shooter because he simply lost a step. It had to happen eventually, kind of a bummer to see a great player decline – Suggested replacement name – ‘Fade Away’\n\nDeron Williams | D-Will – While mentioning declines, I’m starting to really feel that this applies for him as well. What happened to D Will? Just a few years back i would have argued he was THE elite PG in the world, but he seems to lose an edge, a step or something. – Suggested replacement name – ‘Remember When I Was Compared to CP3?’\n\nUntil the next episode…..\n\nJoe Dumars Draft History Analysis\n\nContribution by M. Jones\n\nFor my first contribution, i decided it was time to start a discussion and evaluation around everyone’s favorite General Manager. I am talking about the man who wore the Pistons white, blue and red for 14 years and helped lead the Bad Boys to back to back titles: Joe D. For the past few years many pistons fans have been critical of the man as the pistons have slid deeper into the NBA cellar and turned into an annual lottery pick waiting to happen just to lose to the son of the man who now truly runs the D, Dan Gilbert. I won’t get into the legitimacy of the lottery and my gut feeling that the NBA is rubbing the Cavs nuts for the whole LeBron debacle by just happening to draw that top pick repeatedly, we can revisit that in a later blog as the draft approaches. For now, my focus will be on evaluating Joe D’s draft history and his ability to draft and develop his picks over the past decade or so.\n\n2003:\n\nDarko Milicic (Round 1, pick 2);\n\nCarlos Delfino (Round 1, pick 25);\n\nAndreas Glyniadakis (Round 2, pick 58)\n\nThe draft where it has to start….the infamous 2003 blunder.\n\nCarmelo, Wade, LeBron, Juwanna Man (Bosh) and even Captain Kirk. Ugh. Without a doubt, one of the worst mistakes by any GM in NBA history happened on this day when Dumars fell in love with a Serbian who had a great YouTube clip and ‘unlimited’ potential. I can’t decide if i should move on or dwell on this dark day in pistons history. Joe D was convinced this guy could become the key to many key victories down the road, and he ends up being no more than the human victory cigar. In retrospect, there was a lot of debate at the time whether or not a guy such as wade or melo would gel with the incredible core Dumars assembled as Rip and Tayshaun were in the prime and Motown was rolling but fuck it, we all know the story i will move on.\n\nAnd then you have Delfino who showed potential for a small part while playing with Detroit and then went on to contribute to a few non-contenders down the road. Delfino is still playing pro-ball. And then there is Andres. Who you ask?? Exactly. Dumars has demonstrated a complete lack of ability to find talent in the second round of any draft he has ever overseen as you will continue to read. It was clear that in 2003, Joe D was going through a phase of foreign love like a sophomore female in college who is studying abroad and getting stuffed like a teddy bear in Paris.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2003:\n\nAfter Darko at 2: Melo (3), Bosh (4), Wade (5), Kaman (Oooh Ahhh you wish you were a Chippewa caveman at 6), Hinrich (aka the NBA 2K create a player you have all made at 7) and David West (18).\n\nAfter Delfino at 25: Kendrick Perkins, Leonardo Barbosa, Steve Blake, Matt Bonner (Ginger based god) and Kyle Korver.\n\nDraft Grade – Clearly a big Fucking F to start off the show.\n\n2004:\n\nRickey Paulding (Round 2, pick 54)\n\nThe draft after hoisting the championship, the Pistons draft picks were limited to one late 2nd rounder, and no real gems would have come from keeping their late first rounder. (Another article on his track record with trades/free agents to come at a future date). Rickey Paulding never panned out but Dumars had very little work with. As a result, this year is not applicable for grading.\n\nDraft Grade – N/A – Hey it’s better than failing after 2003. Let’s move on.\n\n2005:\n\nJason Maxiell (Round 1, pick 26);\n\nAmir Johnson (Round 2, pick 56);\n\nAlex Acker (Round 2, pick 60)\n\nBack to a normal draft year for Dumars to evaluate. Jason Maxiell. The next Big Ben. He’s only 6 foot 7 but he was going to learn from the man and become a force. I have always believed that Dumars invested way too much time and MONEY in maxiell. Dumars believed so much in the dude that he pushed him into a starter role years later and tried to keep convincing someone, anyone, that he was a good pick. Well it turns out he wasn’t at all.\n\nOn to Amir Johnson, and the trend of Dumars trading guys he drafted before they developed. Looking back now, Johnson was probably a steal in the 2nd round and probably the only one you will see on this list. Too bad he’s hanging out in Toronto spending all his loonies and toonies on the new Drake albums saying ‘hell yeah fucking right doggie.’ And Alex Acker, yup i will move on again but hey he was the last pick so no big issue there.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2005:\n\nAfter Maxiell at 26: David Lee (30), Brandon Bass (33), Monta Ellis (40), Louis Williams (45)\n\nAfter Amir at 56: MARCIN GORTAT (57) YES THE POLISH FUCKING HAMMER\n\nDraft Grade – A Firm D – …. At this rate Joe D isn’t getting that diploma\n\n2006:\n\nWill Blalock (Round 2, pick 60)\n\nSimilar to the 2004 draft, the Pistons draft picks were limited to one late 2nd rounder, and no real gems would have come from keeping their late first rounder. As a result, another N/A. Side note, this was Joe’s first attempt to find someone that Mason could call Will ‘the thrill’.\n\nDraft Grade – N/A\n\n2007:\n\nRodney Stuckey (Round 1, pick 15);\n\nArron Afflalo (Round 1, pick 27);\n\nSammy Mejia (Round 2, pick 57)\n\nThe first important draft of the rebuilding era for the Stones that has fallen so flat on its face. At the time, the catch phrase was ‘reload’ instead of ‘rebuild’ still but we all know the steep fall from this point. Stuckey is a tough one for me to be critical on. I was very high on this pick from day one and always thought he was going to prove everyone wrong. A high volume scorer at a time when the pistons core could not register 100 on the big board on the Palace with an aging Rip Hamilton. The reason that this pick eventually fell flat was the belief that Stuckey was a star on a good team down the road and not a 5th/6th man on a good team in the long run. Still have a gut feeling that if Rodney can escape Auburn Hills in the next 1-2 years, you will see a resurgence for him and he will live up to expectations more than he has.\n\nTo take a step back, Stuck for his career has posted about 13.5 points a game and always shows flashes every week or two. At the end of the day, the lack of ability to ever shoot much above 40% from the field and under 30% from long range are the stats that stick with you and prevent him from excelling. Still not Joe’s worst pick, and definitely not since 2003.\n\nNow onto Afflalo. Damnit. An all-American in his final year at UCLA and a gritty player who could contribute in many ways on the court. And he was from Compton. In a battle for Compton street credit, i would take afflalo over Tayshaun and his lanky ass arms and he even gets a shout out on Kendrick Lamar’s latest album. Battle over. Joe D finally hit on a late draft pick and he’s now scoring 20+ a game and making an argument for a 2014 all-star appearance in a uniform that is not the Detroit Pistons. And Sammy Mejia. C’mon man.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2007:\n\nAfter Stuckey: Marco Belinelli (18), Wilson Chandler (23) the man was never the same after spending time in China with JR Smith, go figure.\n\nDraft Grade – Best of the bunch so far from a pure draft standpoint with no great talent below stuckey and the decision to get Afflalo even though he blew his load later by trading him. B+\n\n2008:\n\nD.J. White (Round 1, pick 29); [Rights traded for WALTER SHARPE]\n\nDeron Washington (Round 2, pick 59)\n\nWalter Sharpe played one season and averaged 1.0 points per game. Wow. Let’s move straight to how he messed this one up.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2008:\n\nAfter the 29th pick: Nicola Pekovic (30). Let’s expand on this one. Did you know this man was a stand in for the Goonies movie? Turns out he is a rebound machine and now one half of the big white machine in Minnesota with K Love. Turned out to be a big fuck up, because we had Maxiell so we didn’t need a big man, right? Oh and then there is DeAndre Jordan (35), Omer Asik (36) and Goran Dragic (45). That’s 4 guys drafted late in the draft who are now very solid players and not to mention 3 are big guys which the pistons desperately needed until Dre came to town recently. Just terrible.\n\nDraft Grade – Even though 2nd rounders are tough to call this draft by Joe was pathetic. The list of guys we could have had leave me with no option but another F.\n\n2009:\n\nAustin Daye (Round 1, pick 15); [Drafted BJ Mullens at 15 and traded for Daye who was at 30, also acquired Jonas]\n\nDaJuan Summers (Round 2, pick 35);\n\nJonas Jerebko (Round 2, pick 39);\n\nChase Budinger (Round 2, pick 44) – Traded to Houston for hand job and a smile.\n\nAnd we continue on. Joe Dumars clearly was trying to recreate the core he built that won the 2004 championship. Austin Daye. SMH. Austin Daye? DaJuan Summers played ok as a role player and then disappeared. Jonas banged half of Lake Orion and Auburn Hills and then decided he wasn’t ever going to develop. At least Joe D got than good ole’ fashioned in the deal from Houston.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2009:\n\nAfter Daye via the 15: Tyler Hansbrough (16), Jeff Teague (19), Jrue Holiday (20), Ty Lawson (21) and Brandon Jennings (22).\n\nNotable 2nd Rounders: DeMare Carrol (36) I think he sucks but he starts for the Hawks who own us this year, Taj Gibson (38), Darren Collison (42), Danny Green (47), Jodie Meeks (49) and Wesley Matthews (58).\n\nDraft Grade – What the fuck? A deep draft that could have resulted in Lawson and Green and we come out with nothing. D.\n\n2010:\n\nGreg Monroe (Round 1, pick 7);\n\nTerrico White (Round 2, pick 36)\n\nOk, so after years of absolutely failing Joe D is back in the top ten picks of the draft and has a chance to start again. I still remember where i was for this draft and i still remember yelling at the TV begging for Joe D to trade up two picks to get DeMarcus Cousins at 5. Fate fell into the pistons hands finally though on this day as Golden State topped even Dumars and failed hard by picking Ekpe Udoh at 6. This is Dumars best pick to date in this review as the Moose has developed into a VERY good player. I consider Monroe to be one of the most underrated players in the league today. The man can do everything on the court well and is a knock down jump shot and a pistons playoff berth away from being an all-star.\n\nBut in all fairness, with a top 10 pick it deserves a deeper dive into who else could be sporting the Motor City jerseys on Sundays.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2010:\n\nGordon Hayward (9) – Still happy with Gmo at this point.\n\nThen you see PAUL GEORGE (10) – Must have been the two first names thing. But damnit, this guy is leading the Pacers to the best record in the land and he has developed into a top 10 guard in all of the world. Damnit again.\n\nLuke Babbit (16) – Terrible pick but Joe’s former apprentice (Hammonds) for the bucks but just still really funny to me that this guy went so high. Milwaukee is the only team who drafts on our level year over year.\n\nEric Bledsoe (18) – Turned into a good player but still good with GMO.\n\nNotable 2nd Rounders after Terrico: Lance Stephenson (40). For the record Terrico has never registered even a single stat in the NBA. Weak 2nd round besides Lance who is a starter for the league-leading Pacers.\n\nDraft Grade – I still really like the Monroe pick. If George wasn’t in the draft it would be an A, but i have to downgrade it to a B knowing we could have an elite wing player who is about to hit his prime in the next few years.\n\n2011:\n\nBrandon Knight (Round 1, pick 8);\n\nKyle Singler (Round 2, pick 33);\n\nVernon Macklin (Round 2, pick 52)\n\nWell this is an interesting one for me. I was a huge fan of the Knight pick on draft day and for his rookie season. A one year college player who i thought could develop but he’s already off the roster in 2014. For once we see Dumars getting some value in the second round with THE bucket man. Singler is a solid contributor to the current team, even though the current record in nothing to brag about. I think he will still be on the roster once things finally get turned around and i envision 20,000+ strong in the Palace chanting ‘bucket man’. Macklin created some hype in the D League but still has never shown anything in the NBA so he is probably never going to at this point.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2011:\n\nAfter Knight at 8 – Kemba Walker (9), Klay Thompson (11) DAMNIT, Kawhi Leonard (15), Iman Shumpert (17), Tobias Harris (19), Kenneth Faried (22), Reggie Jackson (24) and Jimmy Butler (30).\n\nNotable 2nd Rounders after Singler at 33: Chandler Parsons (38) and Isiah Thomas (60).\n\nDraft Grade – Was ok with it at the time, but who wouldn’t honestly take essentially any of those guys listed above over Knight (and by association Jennings) today? Not many of you. Thompson, Faried, Jackson, Parsons and Thomas would all look pretty damn good in the Stones uniform these days. Given the fact that i thought Knight was a steal on draft day and he was later swapped for Jennings who can hoop, i will let Joe get away with a C+ here.\n\n2012:\n\nAndre Drummond (Round 1, pick 9);\n\nKhris Middleton (Round 2, pick 39);\n\nKim English (Round 2, pick 44)\n\nFinally a true bright spot. Andre is one of the best centers in the league at a very young age and will only continue to develop. Joe D hit the jackpot on this one and now has the piece he needs to build a contender once again. Middleton and English are both already no longer affiliated with the Pistons, so i consider those wasted picks.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2012:\n\nAfter Dre at 9 – After closer review of the 2012 draft after the 9th pick, it is clearly one of the weakest drafts in years. Again a pure home run here for Joe D, which may have saved his job.\n\nDraft Grade – A+. Yes an A+, trust me the rest of the draft is terrible at this point.\n\n2013:\n\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope (Round 1, pick 8);\n\nTony Mitchell (Round 2, pick 37);\n\nPeyton Siva (Round 2, pick 56)\n\nThis is toughest to rate so far given that we are not even at the all-star break yet for the rookie season of the draft class. I was surprised by the pick on draft day, but i have seen a few flashes from KCP that suggest there may be some light at the end of the tunnel here. He is currently on a roster full of guys who shoot like they will never touch the ball again with J Smooth, Jennings, Stuckey and Will the Thrill. Mitchell showed big flashes in summer league but is having trouble getting on the court. Siva seems like he should see some time but the backcourt, like always under Dumars’ rule is log-jammed. Still worth analyzing the early results to see if there was a miss here.\n\nNotable players passed on by Dumars in 2013:\n\nAfter KCP and 8 – It starts with Trey Burke at 9. I watched nearly every game of his career at Michigan and was disappointed we passed on Trey Trey. He has started to turn around a terrible Utah team, so probably a mistake here all bias aside. Then you have Carter-Williams at 11 who has been lighting the NBA on fire and may be on the way to rookie of the year honors. Can’t forget to give Timmy a shout out at 24 too, he is starting to play well for the Knicks and will benefit if they can ever rid themselves of the debacle that the resigning of JR Smith was this offseason. Just watch out Timmy, this dumb asshole may untie your shoes in practice of straight-up bring the glock to work Gilbert Arenas style. Probably too early to judge the 2nd rounders just yet, but no obvious misses at this point in time.\n\nDraft Grade – B. Outside of MCW and Trey, no obvious screw up just yet. Let’s give KCP sometime before throwing Joe D under the bus AGAIN.\n\nOverall Consensus:\n\nOverall there are definitely more failures than success stories to speak of. And though I realize the drafts are crap shoots at times, there are successful NBA GM’s that are very effective and reload over and over just ask the Spurs. Joe D has been on borrowed time for years now, but has hung on by throwing nearly a dozen coaches under the bus. In this guy’s opinion, he has made more of a case for replacement than extension. Tom Gores (and his hair) should be on the recruiting trail now unless some drastic happens."
