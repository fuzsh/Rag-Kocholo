        "text": "Twenty years ago professional NBA players were allowed to play for the USA's Olympic basketball team for the first time: they became known as the Dream Team.\n\nThis week Team USA officials released the preliminary 20-man roster for the men's Olympic basketball team to compete this summer in London. As expected, the team will be stacked to the brim with future Hall of Famers, and narrowing down this group to 12 will be no easy task for Mike Krzyzewski and crew. The biggest names, such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant, Derrick Rose, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwight Howard all figure to be locks to make the team leaving just a few spots on the bench to be filled with All Stars. It is a true embarrassment of riches. Barring a major upset, the 2012 team should repeat their gold medal performance of 2008.\n\nWhen the IOC lifted all restrictions on professional athletes participating in the Olympics after the 1988 Games in Seoul, the American team pulled out all the stops and assembled a basketball squad the likes of which had never been seen in Olympic play before. The roster of that 1992 team reads like a wall in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Scottie Pippin, John Stockton, Patrick Ewing, and Clyde Drexler all played in Barcelona that year. And indeed, in 2010 the entire Dream Team was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe team was quite deserving of this honor as they gave one of the most thoroughly dominating performances in the history of modern sports. Their eight wins came by an average margin of victory of almost 44 points per game. Despite Olympic games being eight minutes shorter than NBA games, they averaged more than 117 points per contest. In all, the Dream Team set a pretty high standard for subsequent American teams.\n\nNaturally, this year's iteration of the team will draw comparisons to its predecessor. But comparing two teams in any sport from different eras is a difficult undertaking. Context is so important that simply looking at player stats side by side can only reveal so much.\n\nWithout a doubt, this year's Dream Team and the original Dream Team are comparably talented groups. If the present team were to play against the competition from 1992, they would win by a similarly huge margin. (Let us say, for argument's sake, that the difference between the talent level of the 1992 team and the 2012 team in terms of average margin of victory against 1992 competition is negligible.) In the last two decades relatively little has changed with respect to the talent level of the American team.\n\nYet, in London the 2012 team is not likely to replicate the merciless drubbing carried out at the hands of the 1992 team. In fact, as the disappointing bronze medal the 2004 team took home illustrates, there is now a chance that the 2012 team might not win at all. The point, I hope, is obvious: while the U.S. team has remained consistently elite since 1992, the rest of the world has slowly but surely begun to catch up. One statistic that illustrates this point nicely is that at the start of the 1992 season, there were only 21 foreign-born players from 18 different countries on NBA rosters; at the start of the 2010-2011 season there were a record 84 foreign-born players from 38 counties. If the NBA represents the game's biggest stage, then this would suggest that international basketball has improved dramatically since 1992. This point is borne out further by the ever growing number of foreign-born players who are selected in the NBA draft each year.\n\nThis Summer in London the U.S. team will face opponents loaded with players who can boast NBA experience. Many of these teams feature at least one legitimate NBA superstar. Even teams without a strong NBA presence on their roster have Euroleague players who spend a great deal of time playing together and thus form a more cohesive unit. The U.S. team's toughest competition figures to again be the Spanish team, with their deep roster of NBA stars and role players, including Pau and Marc Gasol, Rudy Fernandez, Serge Ibaka, Jose Calderone, and rookie phenom Ricky Rubio. The 2008 bronze medal-winning Argentinian team, anchored by Manu Ginobili, Luis Scola, and Carlos Delfino could also challenge. Here the U.S. team is a useful barometer for measuring how much international play has improved.\n\nThe question of which Dream Team is better will no doubt become fodder for debate on talk radio in the months leading up to the Games. Of course, it's a virtually impossible question to answer objectively. If your way of measuring this is in terms of the individual accolades won by the members of the team, then the only fair way of making this comparison is by waiting until everyone from the current team has retired. If your argument is that the 1992 Dream Team was just simply more talented, it's worth keeping in mind that both Johnson and Bird were nearing retirement in 1992.\n\nIt's certainly a fascinating discussion, but just as interesting is what the Dream Team can tell us about the globalization of basketball excellence.\n\n2012 vs. 1992: How They Stack Up\n\nAs noted above, comparing player stats across eras can be a tricky endeavor. Nevertheless, the question is: player-by-player how does the 2012 team compare to the original Dream Team?\n\nHere's a look at how the nine players who are locks for the 2012 team stack up to their counterparts from the 1992 team, using career per game stats (Points, Assists, Total Rebounds, Steals)\n\nPoint Guard\n\nChris Paul vs. Magic Johnson\n\nThe Stats:\n\nPaul – 18.7 PTS, 9.9 AST, 4.6 TRB, 2.4 STL\n\nJohnson – 19.5 PTS, 11.2 AST, 7.2 TRB, 1.9 STL\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nJohnson has the slight edge here. Like Johnson, Paul is an excellent scoring point guard, but Johnson's size allowed him to rebound with some of the best big men in the league, making him one of the most versatile players in history. Paul is only 26 years old, however, while Johnson was 32 in 1992.\n\nShooting Guard:\n\nKobe Bryant vs. Michael Jordan\n\nThe Stats:\n\nBryant – 25.3 PTS, 4.7 AST, 5.3 TRB, 1.5 STL\n\nJordan – 30.1 PTS, 5.3 AST, 6.2 TRB, 2.3 STL\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nDespite Jordan recently saying that Kobe is the only player currently in the league to warrant comparisons to His Airness, Jordan still has the upper hand. Although, having not looked at Jordan's stats recently, I was a bit surprised at how close it actually is.\n\nSmall Forward:\n\nLeBron James vs. Scottie Pippen\n\nThe Stats:\n\nJames – 27.7 PTS, 7.0 AST, 7.1 TRB, 1.7 STL\n\nPippen – 16.1 PTS, 5.2 AST, 6.4 TRB, 2.0 STL\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nIt was a common joke when James made his notorious \"Decision\" that he joined the Miami Heat to be the Scottie Pippen to Dwyane Wade's Michael Jordan. But as the numbers show, this is not even close. James is the only player in NBA history to average over 26 points, 6 assists, and 6 rebounds for his career. (Side note: Larry Bird and Scottie Pippen played equal time at the SF position for the Dream Team, but in 1992, Bird was 35 years old and preparing to retire while Pippen was 26.)\n\nPower Forward:\n\nKevin Durant vs. Charles Barkley\n\nThe Stats:\n\nDurant – 25.9 PTS, 6.3 TRB, .9 BLK, 1.2 STL\n\nBarkley – 22.1 PTS, 11.7 TRB, .8 BLK, 1.5 STL\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThis comparison is particularly hard to make because the two players have such vastly different playing styles. Durant is essentially an oversized shooting guard while Barkley played like an undersized center. Indeed, Durant's natural position is SF, but considering the logjam there on the Olympic team, he will likely log a fair number of minutes at PF. We'll call this a push.\n\nCenter:\n\nDwight Howard vs. Patrick Ewing\n\nThe Stats:\n\nHoward – 18.3 PTS, 12.9 TRB, 2.2 BLK, 1.0 STL\n\nEwing – 21.0 PTS, 9.8 TRB, 2.4 BLK, 1.0 STL\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nI'm inclined to give this one to Ewing because his career scoring average was dragged down a bit by his last few years in the league. In 1992, he was averaging over 23 points per game. But it's only Ewing by a hair; as you can see, where Howard falls short of Ewing as a scorer, he makes up ground as a rebounder.\n\nBench:\n\n2012 Dream Team – Dwyane Wade, Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh\n\n1992 Dream Team – John Stockton, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Karl Malone\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThis is quite close. If we break it down into guards and forwards, then Wade and Rose get the edge over Stockton and Drexler and Bird and Malone beat out Anthony and Bosh. Yes, even as an injury prone 35 year old, Bird averaged 20.2 PTS, 9.6 TRB, and 6.8 AST for the Celtics in 1992."
