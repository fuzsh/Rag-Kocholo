        "text": "In Wade, however, the Nuggets would have had a remarkable talent on both sides of the ball—an NBA Finals MVP who has made the All-NBA first, second or third team every year but one since his rookie season. He's also been in the top 10 in points per game six times since his rookie campaign and even led the league in 2008-09.\n\nBut I still remember his monster rebounding year in 2007-08 for the Clippers. The truth is, he hauled in a bunch of boards and scored a bunch of points for L.A. over the course of his career there. Per 36 minutes, his stats (other than turnovers and steals) stack up with some of the better centers in the NBA.\n\nI admit to having a soft spot in my heart for Kaman, who played his college ball in my home state. But I can say without hesitation that the Knicks would have been thrilled to get Kaman instead of Mike Sweetney, who was a decent role player for two years before being traded to Chicago and falling apart.\n\nOld pick: Marcus Banks\n\nNew pick: Kendrick Perkins\n\nPerkins is perhaps not the player we thought he was going to be when he first hit the scene in Boston. But he's a terrific defender in the post and a solid rebounder, and his attitude set a tone for the Oklahoma City Thunder when they were on their way up.\n\nPerkins has been in the top 10 in blocks and blocks per game in two seasons and has been in the top five in defensive rating two years as well.\n\nSince being traded to OKC his numbers have gone down, but he's still an important contributor.\n\nOld pick: Reece Gaines\n\nNew pick: Marquis Daniels\n\nMuch like when a good shooter gets a so-so shot to fall—it's called a \"shooter's roll\"—I give Daniels the underdog's roll here. In other words, he ranks higher than he might have were he not undrafted the first time around.\n\nDaniels had about six good years and three really good years. He never had much range, but he was crafty with the basketball in his hands and was a good defender and solid player overall.\n\nHe deserved better than not being selected at all, and he was far better than Gaines, a historic bust for the Magic and later the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOld pick: Troy Bell\n\nNew pick: Udonis Haslem\n\nI give props where they're due. The undrafted Haslem has lasted a long time in this league and has been an important complementary piece on several championship rosters.\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, the only undrafted players since the common draft began in 1966 to have grabbed more rebounds than Haslem are Ben Wallace and Brad Miller.\n\nThe Miami Heat's all-time leading rebounder—at 6'8\", no less—Haslem gives maximum effort every night and plays hard-nosed defense, in the style of Pat Riley's New York Knicks of the 1990s.\n\nYet he plays nice perimeter defense, performs with poise and professionalism and always seems to step in when needed and perform above expectation. Never was that more apparent than last season, when Blake stepped in for a fallen Kobe Bryant and guided the Lakers, averaging 23.5 points, six rebounds, 5.5 assists and a steal in two wins that pushed L.A. into the playoffs.\n\nAnother player known for his defense and tough, physical play, Bogans, in his second stint in Orlando, was a role player on the contending Magic squads featuring Dwight Howard. Originally known for not being able to shoot, Bogans developed a pretty decent three-point stroke and last year lurked in the corner for the Nets—not a spot where anyone would have expected him to be when he started his career.\n\nBut he's a far cry better than the T-Wolves' real draft pick, Ndudi Ebi, who played a grand total of 86 minutes in the NBA before being waived by Minnesota and then the Dallas Mavericks. Ebi was last seen playing overseas. If he'd gone higher, as some projected, he'd rank among the greatest busts in the history of the league.\n\nAfter playing in Portland during its Dark Period, half a season with the Clippers and one year with the Nets, he landed on the Sacramento Kings, which until their sale had been the NBA's version of purgatory. He's played 10-12 minutes a game but has been an insurance policy for the most part.\n\nNo one will ever question his effort, which is deeply appreciated on an NBA roster. His techniques are uncomplicated, and they're what a prototypical big man ought to be: a guy who lives in the post, keeps himself between his man and the basket whenever possible and hits his shots with reasonable consistency."
