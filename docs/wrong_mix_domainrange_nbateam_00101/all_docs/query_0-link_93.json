        "text": "33 Crazy Predictions for the NBA Season | Grandland.com\n\nYou're already reading everything Zach Lowe writes because...well, because of course you are. But in case you, like, haven't gotten to this yet, Lowe predicts both the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves will trade away a wing player this season.\n\nMilwaukee did well to steal a first-rounder from the Clippers in the Jared Dudley deal, but the wing rotation is crowded â€” especially if Brandon Knight gets time at shooting guard. Dudley is easier to move than O.J. Mayo and rangier than Jerryd Bayless.\n\nIt's generally risky to call anybody a \"safe bet\" to be traded (though Gary Neal totally qualified last year), but moving Dudley this season does make a lot of sense. His deal is relatively cheap at $4.25 million with an ETO after this year, and he was a very effective wing scorer with Phoenix before enduring a rough season with the Clippers last year. Don't expect the Bucks to get too much for him if they do find a taker, though if Carlos Delfino and Miroslav Raduljica can fetch a better player and a future first, anything is possible, right? Having already acquired a future first-round pick for taking on his contract, swapping him for another future asset would constitute some seriously slick cap management from John Hammond and company.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks' Larry Sanders says he's learned lessons from lost season | FOX Sports\n\nAndrew Gruman talks with Larry Sanders about the big man's efforts to return to form after off-court incidents and injuries derailed his 2013-2014 season. Sanders says the number one thing is to learn find the lessons :\n\n\"I wouldn't say rebuild,\" Sanders said about his reputation. \"I'd say more just pushing through and learning from things that have happened. You learn from different situations on the court and off the court, and it's all about growth.\n\n\"Nothing grows without pain; nothing grows without struggle. You just have to pick apart the lessons within the struggle.\"\n\nNBA: Why you should watch in 2014-15 - ESPN\n\nZach Harper gives you a reason to watch every single NBA team this season. Milwaukee's is...predictable.\n\nSay it with me now: Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nOK, that wasn't great pronunciation from everybody but you'll eventually get the hang of it.\n\nThe Greek Freak's impossible wingspan and endearing demeanor have made Twitter all, well, twitterpated. Jason Kidd is going to use him in odd, unconventional ways, including playing Antetokounmpo at point guard and having him lead a lot of fast breaks. He can cover 75-80 feet of the floor in like two dribbles.\n\nThere are plenty of fun parts to this bad Bucks team -- Jabari Parker, for instance, is someone you'll want to watch -- but it's all about Giannis when it comes to viewing pleasure."
