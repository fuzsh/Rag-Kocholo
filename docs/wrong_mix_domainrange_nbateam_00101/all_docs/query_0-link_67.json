        "text": "When you think of hip-hop and Rap music in Detroit you think of names like the Insane Clown Posse, 50 Cent, Eminem, Big Sean, Lizzo and more. But when it comes the super groups of Hip Hop & Rap, names like NWA, De La Soul, Hieroglyphics, and Wu-Tang are some of the most legendary of the top acts of the 80s and 90s.\n\nBut what about recognition for the first supergroup coming from Detroit? Of course, I'm talking about the 1987 Detroit Pistons. Wait, don't tell me you've never heard of the legendary bars dropped by the 1987 Detroit Pistons. Well, pull up an ice bath and lend an ear...\n\nBack before the famous Rap Supergroups, the likes of Joe Dumars, Isaiah Thomas, Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, Chuck Nevitt, and Head Coach Chuck Daly were dropping straight fire to get people to shop at Dunham's.\n\nThe odd thing about the video below is they were hyping up the store, who were advertising Patrick Ewing shoes...\n\nThe video itself is hilarious and filled with awful lip-syncing, but for some reason, this works for me. I wouldn't say I'm now compelled to go in and buy shoes from them, but I think this is something that needs to make a comeback.\n\nWhy don't sports teams record crappy, corny songs about themselves or their team anymore? The Detroit Tigers and the Chicago Bears were famous for doing things like this and I feel it's something that needs to make a return. It would make sports a lot more appealing."
