        "text": "The U.S. is once again a heavy favorite to win the gold in the men's basketball competition at the Rio Olympics, but that doesn't mean it won't be a competitive tournament. The U.S. barely beat Lithuania and held off Spain for gold at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nPlus, several games not involving the U.S. should be compelling, especially Group B featuring Brazil, Lithuania, Croatia, Spain, Nigeria and Argentina. Along with the U.S. in Group A: Australia, France, China, Venezuela and Serbia.\n\n\"Clearly, USA is the favorite. After that, you can make an argument for six or seven teams to medal. There’s a lot of balance,\" said international basketball expert Fran Fraschilla who is calling Olympic games for NBC.\n\nA record 46 NBA players from 23 teams are on rosters, including seven players from Spain, and Australia, Brazil and France each have five NBA players on their rosters.\n\nHere's a look at the 12-team field with noteworthy items and quotes from Fraschilla:\n\nArgentina\n\nHow qualified: Finished second 2015 FIBA Americas Championship\n\n2015 FIBA Americas Championship: Lost to Venezuela in the finals\n\n2014 World Cup: 11th place\n\n2012 London Olympics: Fourth\n\nNBA connections: Luis Scola (Brooklyn), Manu Ginobili (San Antonio), Carlos Delfino, Andres Nocioni have extensive NBA experience; 23-year-old Nicolas Brussino signed with the Dallas Mavericks in July.\n\nCoach: Sergio Santos Hernandez\n\nNoteworthy: Scola, Ginobili, Delfino and Nocioni were on Argentina’s gold-medal team at the 2004 Athens Olympics, and those four will play a prominent role on this year’s team. … Scola carried the flag for Argentina during the Opening Ceremony. … Point guard Facundo Campazzo will need a strong tournament if Argentina wants to medal. … Can Argentina defend well enough to medal? … Argentina is the only team in the field besides the U.S. that has won a gold medal.\n\nQuote: “They’re going to be scrambling for a spot on the medal stand. As good as the Golden Generation’s key guys have been, I don’t think there’s enough firepower from the younger guys to push this team against the U.S., and it’s not going to be easy because there’s a lot of wear and tear.” – Fran Fraschilla\n\nAustralia\n\nHow qualified: Won FIBA Oceania Championship in 2005\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to Turkey in round of 16\n\n2012 London Olympics: Lost to USA in quarterfinals\n\nNBA connections: Patty Mills (San Antonio), Andrew Bogut (Dallas), Joe Ingles (Utah), Matthew Dellavedova (Milwaukee), Aron Baynes (Detroit). David Andersen and Cameron Bairstow have NBA experience.\n\nCoach: Andrej Lemanis\n\nNoteworthy: How healthy and ready is Bogut? ... After Bogut, Australia has good size in Baynes, Bairstow, Andersen and Brock Motum, who plays in Lithuania. … Mills and Dellavedova give Australia a nice backcourt.\n\nQuote: \"What makes them dangerous is they’re tough, smart, hard-nosed players. They’re a nice blend of young but experienced high-level international players. They have great chemistry. What Australia has going for it is a good core nucleus of NBA players. This is a veteran group who at the All-Star break spent the break together in San Diego. You’ve got four NBA champions on this team. They have varying degrees of influence, but it can’t hurt.” – Fraschilla\n\nBrazil\n\nHow qualified: Host nation\n\n2015 FIBA Americas: Did not advance out of group play\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to Serbia in the quartefinals\n\n2012 London Olympics: Lost to Argentina in the quarterfinals\n\nNBA connections: Raul Neto (Utah), Cristiano Felicio (Chicago), Marcelo Huertas (Los Angeles Lakers), Nene (Houston), Leandro Barbosa (Phoenix). Alex Garcia and Marcus Vinicius have minimal NBA experience.\n\nCoach: Ruben Magnano\n\nNoteworthy: Brazil has prepared for this since the country was awarded the Olympics and winning a medal at this event is a high priority. … Anderson Varejao was thrilled to play the Olympics in his home country but withdrew because of a back injury. … If you’re looking for an under-the-radar but valuable player, pay attention to Vitor Benite, who plays in Spain’s top pro league. … Magnano coached Argentina’s gold-medal team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.\n\nQuote: “This an old team, a team likely to start five players 30 and older if they start Huertas, Barbosa, Garica, Nene and (Rafael Hettsheimeir). Now, you’ve the 24-year-old Neto who may start in place of Huertas. They’re going to be playing for pride at home but they’re going to have to play very well. The big thing for them is who can they go to to get them a big basket. It’ll likely be Barbosa. Nene is still effective. This is a veteran team. … They will be crafty offensively but struggle at times defensively. They’re going to be in the mix for a medal. I would take the European teams right now but Brazil will battle.” – Fraschilla\n\nChina\n\nHow qualified: Won 2015 FIBA Asia Championship\n\n2015 FIBA Asia Championship: Defeated the Philippines in the finals\n\n2014 World Cup: Did not qualify\n\n2012 London Olympics: Did not win a game.\n\nNBA connections: No current NBA players but Yi Jianlian played five seasons, averaging 12 points and 7.2 rebounds for New Jersey in 2009-10. … Houston selected 7-2 Zhou Qi with the 43rd pick in the second round of the 2016 draft, and Memphis drafted 7-0 Wang Zhelin with 57th pick of the second round in the 2016 draft.\n\nCoach: Gong Luming\n\nNoteworthy: Zhou and Wang have potential but are not ready to join the NBA. … China is building a young team with 10 of its 12 players 26 and younger. … Every player plays in the China’s top pro league and not one plays for the Shanghai Sharks, owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Yao Ming. … Zhao Jiwei is a 20-year-old point guard who plays with creativity.\n\nQuote: “Unfortunately, it’s a shame that Yi’s not on NBA team. He’d be a terrific rotation game. It’s a shame he didn’t find a niche somewhere. To me, he’s certainly the level of an NBA player. He’s the focal point of the team much like Yao Ming was when Yao was his prime. … If there’s a young player to watch in this tournament, its Zhao Jiwei who has the kind of moxie you haven’t seen from Chinese backcourt players in recent years. He plays with some swagger as opposed to by the book. He’s going to share the point guard spot. He can potentially be a very good player for them.” – Fraschilla\n\nCroatia\n\nHow qualified: Won the Olympic qualifying tournament in Turin in July\n\n2015 Eurobasket: Lost to Czech Republic in round of 16\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to France in round of 16\n\n2012 London Olympics: Did not qualify\n\nNBA connections: Bojan Bogdanovic (Brooklyn), Mario Hezonja (Orlando), Dario Saric (Philadelphia). Roko Ukic has NBA experience.\n\nCoach: Aleksandar Petrovic\n\nNoteworthy: NBA observers will tune in to see how Saric plays in this event before he begins his rookie season with the Sixers. … Krunoslav Simon is a three-point threat who is not afraid of the big moment. … Croatia will need strong point guard play if it wants to challenge for a medal. Can veteran point guard Roko Ukic provide enough? … Just three players 30 or older on the roster.\n\nQuote: “These European teams are primarily spread pick-and-roll oriented and play four guys out and stretch the floor and they’re going to use spacing to create opportunities to shoot the three. The key guy is Bogdanovic. He’s 27. He had 44 in a game this year against the Sixers. At worst, he’s a solid NBA player. The offense goes through him. They do a good job not only of putting him in the pick-and-roll but they create isolation opportunities for him. They give him freedom to play one-on-one. Saric to me – he’s a young Boris Diaw. He’s a 6-9 rebounder and playmaker who is very comfortable as a passer. He handles the ball in transition and makes great decisions. He’s what I call superglue guy. He plays with tremendous heart and is a tough kid.” – Fraschilla\n\nSpain\n\nHow qualified: Won 2015 Eurobasket\n\n2015 Eurobasket: Beat France in the finals\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to France in quarterfinals\n\n2012 London Olympics: Silver\n\nNBA connections: Pau Gasol (San Antonio), Alex Abrines (Oklahoma City), Jose Calderon (Los Angeles Lakers), Guillermo Hernangomez (New York), Nikola Mirotic (Chicago), Sergio Rodriguez (Philadelphia), Ricky Rubio (Minnesota). Victor Claver, Rudy Fernandez and Juan Carlos Navarro have also played in the NBA.\n\nCoach: Sergio Scariolo\n\nNoteworthy: Besides the U.S., Spain has more NBA players than any other team in the field. However, Spain is missing Marc Gasol, who is recovering from an injury. … Spain has lost to U.S. in past two Olympic gold-medal games.\n\nQuote: “Having watched Spain, it is certainly the team that is poses the most threat to the United States. You’re talking about a good mix of great experience, size and still some young player who can contribute. You’re looking at a team that has three guys who are 36 years old in Reyes, Navarro and Pau Gasol. Calderon is 34. Rudy is 31. I don’t think Spain is the threat they were in 2012 particularly without Marc Gasol, but there is no doubt that on a given night, they can get hot from beyond the arc, Pau can cause problems inside and most capable team in a one-and-done situation of knocking off the United States.” – Fraschilla\n\nFrance\n\nHow qualified: Won the Olympic qualifying tournament in the Philippines in July\n\n2015 Eurobasket: Finished third\n\n2014 World Cup: Finished third\n\n2012 London Olympics: Lost to Spain in the quarterfinals\n\nNBA connections: Tony Parker (San Antonio), Boris Diaw (Utah), Nic Batum (Charlotte), Rudy Gobert (Utah), Joffrey Lauvergne (Denver). Nando De Colo and Mickael Gelabale played in the NBA.\n\nCoach: Vincent Collet\n\nNoteworthy: France is one of the more experienced teams in this tournament with 87.4 international games played per player. Diaw has played in 162 international games followed by Florent Pietrus (137), Parker (135) and Batum (108). … France hasn’t medaled in men’s basketball since silver in 2000.\n\nQuote: “If there’s a couple of teams who can beat the USA in a one-and-done situation, it’s certainly France. That makes them a dangerous team to win silver or bronze. Let’s start out by saying the guy they didn’t have in the qualifying tournament and the guy they have now is Rudy Gobert who gives them a healthy dose of rim protection against any team in this tournament. He is going to be a major factor is he stays out of foul trouble. He gives France a chance to get more stops. Then you add the experience of Diaw and Parker who essentially have been together since they were teenagers in the French national program. Batum is the ultimate solid defender and scorer. To me, the guy who is unsung and could play a key role in the league right now but is making great money in Russia is Nando De Colo. He’s playing great right now and is as important as anybody in the starting lineup including Diaw, Parker and Batum.” – Fraschilla\n\nLithuania\n\nHow qualified: Finished second at 2015 Eurobasket.\n\n2015 Eurobasket: Lost to Spain in finals\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to U.S. in semifinals\n\n2012 London Olympics: Lost to Russia in quarterfinals\n\nNBA connections: Jonas Valanciunas (Toronto), Mindaugas Kuzminskas (New York), Domantas Sabonis (Oklahoma City)\n\nCoach: Jonas Kazlauskas\n\nNoteworthy: Valanciunas gives Lithuania a strong low-post option, but Lithuania has an aging backcourt and will struggle to match-up with some teams. It is a fun team to watch with creative offensive sets. Remember, Lithuania led the U.S. 84-82 in the fourth quarter at the 2012 London Olympics and lost 99-94. … Sabonis, the son of Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis, and Kuzminskas are NBA rookies but aren’t expected to make a big impact in Rio.\n\nQuote: \"What’s not talked about too much with Lithuania when you talk about Spain and Argentina and how they’re growing old, a similar thing is going on with Lithuania. There’s a likelihood four of their five starters are 30 or older in Mantas Kalnietis, Renaldas Seibutis, Jonas Maciulis, Paulius Jankunas. Those four guys have hit their peak as international players. They’re still dangerous but I don’t think they pose quite the threat they did four years when they were younger. They’ve got great chemistry and continuity but they’ve peaked. I wouldn’t say they’ve lost as much as Argentina, but they haven’t accomplished as much either.” – Fraschilla\n\nNigeria\n\nHow qualified: Won 2015 FIBA Afrobasket\n\n2015 Afrobasket: Defeated Angola in the finals\n\n2014 World Cup: Did not qualify\n\n2012 London Olympics: Finished 1-4 and did not make it out of group play\n\nNBA connections: Josh Akognon, Ike Diogu and Ben Uzoh have NBA experience, and Michael Gbinije was selected 49th by Detroit in the second round of the 2016 draft. Ben Uzoh has D-League and minor NBA experience.\n\nNoteworthy: Every player on the roster played U.S. college basketball. … Alade Aminu is the brother of Al-Farouq Aminu. … Shane Lawal plays in Spain’s top pro league, Akognon plays in Italy’s top pro league and Diogu plays in China. … Coach Will Voigt, a Vermont native, coached in the D-League and worked in San Antonio’s video room. ... Assistant coach John Bryant is on Philadelphia’s coaching staff. … Chamberlain Oguchi is a solid three-pointer shooter. ... Festus Ezeli and Al-Farouq Aminu are not playing.\n\nCoach: Will Voigt\n\nQuote: “They’re an athletic, tough, physical team. They change defenses. They hang their hat on pressure – man-to-man – but they will change defenses. They’re going to play through Diogu and Farouq-Aminu. There’s a lot of pride there. Five teams in that group are vying for four spots. Nigeria could knock off a Brazil or an Argentina and keep a team out of the knockout round.” – Fraschilla\n\nSerbia\n\nHow qualified: Won the Olympic qualifying tournament in Belgrade in July\n\n2015 Eurobasket: Finished fourth\n\n2014 World Cup: Lost to the U.S. in the championship game\n\n2012 London Olympics: Did not qualify\n\nNBA connections: Nikola Jokic (Denver). Nemanja Nedovic and Miroslav Raduljica also played in the NBA.\n\nCoach: Sasha Djordjevic\n\nNoteworthy: A strong, defense first team coached by an international legend. … Strong backcourt with Milos Teodosic, Nedovic, Stefan Marokovic and solid post presence in Jokic. However, Serbia is missing Nemanja Bjelcia (Minnesota) who is rehabbing and Boban Marjanovic, who missed qualifying game because he was focused on his free-agent deal. After he signed with the Pistons, Marjanvic expressed his interest in playing but Serbia said no. … This is Serbia’s debut in the men’s Olympic basketball event.\n\nQuote: “Serbia plays extremely well together and is led by one of the maestros of world basketball in Milos Teodosic. He’s in the top echelon of passers in the world. He’s probably one of the top five playmakers in the world in terms of passing. ... They have a guy they can throw into in the low-post in Jokic. He’s going to be one of the youngest contributors of the good players in this tournament. He’s just 21 years old and Serbia is very comfortable throwing the ball into Djokic and playing off of him. He’s an excellent passer. He had a solid rookie year. I’m hesitant to call him a young Vlade because Vlade is 7-1 but this kid is terrific and efficient player in the low post particularly in terms of passing. They don’t need to be as reliant on Teodosic.” – Fraschilla\n\nVenezuela\n\nHow qualified: Won 2015 FIBA Americas championship\n\n2015 FIBA Americas: Defeated Argentina in the finals\n\n2014 World Cup: Did not qualify\n\n2012 London Olympics: Did not qualify\n\nNBA connections: None. Gregory Vargas plays in France’s top pro league, and Anthony Perez plays for Ole Miss. The rest of the teams plays in Venezuela’s pro league.\n\nCoach: Nestor Garcia\n\nNoteworthy: Greivis Vasquez was a late withdrawal, deciding to focus on his health after signing with Brooklyn in the offseason. … John Cox, who played college basketball at San Francisco, is the first cousin of Kobe Bryant. David Cubillan played at Marquette, and Dwight Lewis Southern California.”\n\nQuote: “They’re going to miss Vasquez but the strength of this team is in the backcourt. To me, their key is Gregory Vargas, a 5-11 PG who has won eight titles in 13 pro seasons mostly recently in Israel and plans to play in the French Pro A next season. He’s the heart and soul of the team.” – Fraschilla\n\nUSA\n\nHow qualified: won 2014 FIBA World Cup\n\n2014 World Cup: Defeated Serbia in the finals\n\n2012 London Olympics: Won gold\n\nCoach: Mike Krzyzewski\n\nNoteworthy: Every player is an All-Star and/or All-NBA performer or former All-Star and/or NBA performer, except for Harrison Barnes. … U.S. won gold in 2008 in Athens and 2012 in London and have won 14 Olympic golds. … Since 1992, the U.S. is 126-7 in official competitions and 51-1 in exhibition games. Since losing to Greece at the 2006 world championship, the U.S. is 45-0. … The U.S. has six first-time Olympians (Jimmy Butler, DeAndre Jordan, Kyle Lowry, Barnes, Paul George and Draymond Green) and Jordan is the only one of those six who has played in an official international game. … Carmelo Anthony is going for his third consecutive Olympic gold medal."
