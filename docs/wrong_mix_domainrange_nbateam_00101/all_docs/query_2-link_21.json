        "text": "By of the\n\nMinneapolis - It's an enticing matchup two years in the making.\n\nWhen Ricky Rubio was selected fifth overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2009 draft and Brandon Jennings went 10th to the Milwaukee Bucks, basketball fans were eager to see the young point guards face off.\n\nBut Rubio decided to stay in Spain and play two seasons with Regal FC Barcelona while Jennings became an instant starter with the Bucks. The young Buck helped his team reach the playoffs during his rookie year and led Milwaukee in scoring last season.\n\nNow Rubio, a 21-year-old Spaniard, is taking his first plunge into the NBA waters and will meet the 22-year-old Jennings on the court three times in the next few weeks.\n\nThe Bucks and Timberwolves open the two-game preseason Saturday night at the Target Center and will play again Wednesday night in the annual MACC Fund Game at the Bradley Center.\n\nThen the teams face each other on Dec. 27 in the Bucks' regular-season home opener.\n\n\"It's just exciting we're all on the same court and able to play in an NBA game, that's the most important thing,\" Jennings said. \"I'm just happy that I can put on my Bucks uniform and go out there and play.\n\n\"He's been playing professional basketball since he was 14 or 15 years old, so he's had a lot of experience at the pro level. I'm sure coming to the NBA will be even easier for him.\"\n\nRubio is part of a reshaped Timberwolves backcourt that also features point guard J.J. Barea, who helped the Dallas Mavericks win the NBA title in June; and former Bucks guard Luke Ridnour, who signed a multiyear free-agent deal with Minnesota prior to last season.\n\nThe Bucks also will be testing their restructured point guard trio of Jennings, veteran Beno Udrih and Shaun Livingston.\n\nNew Minnesota coach Rick Adelman isn't afraid to play his point guards at the same time, so it's highly likely Barea and Rubio or Ridnour will be on the court together at times. And the same goes for Jennings and Udrih or Livingston.\n\nAfter a pre-draft workout in Sacramento in 2009, Jennings famously said of Rubio, \"I think the dude is just all hype.\"\n\nBut Jennings later backtracked a bit on that comment and complimented Rubio's game. Still, Jennings thought the Spanish player had not braved the workout grind that he and other point guards in that draft class went through, including Jonny Flynn, Ty Lawson, Stephen Curry and Jrue Holiday.\n\nBucks guard-forward Carlos Delfino is familiar with Rubio's game after playing against him in international basketball. Before the 2010 World Championship in Turkey, Argentina played Spain and Delfino matched up against the talented point guard.\n\n\"In that game we didn't have any playmakers, so I was playing as a playmaker,\" Delfino said. \"He likes to run the court and he has great vision of the court.\n\n\"The best part of his game is running, passing ahead and using his speed. When he plays 5-on-5, at least the last couple years, he's been struggling, especially playing pick-and-rolls. He likes to gamble a lot, especially on defense.\n\n\"He's long and athletic; his legs are fresh.\"\n\nRubio is sure to get an education in the compressed NBA season. Jennings remembers going against elite point guards on a regular basis during his rookie year.\n\n\"Now the NBA is becoming a lot of young, talented guards,\" Jennings said, \"so every night, especially for 66 games, there's going to be urgency for everybody. So I think it's going to be a good challenge for him and for all of us.\"\n\nExhibition feels real: Bucks coach Scott Skiles admits the two exhibition games will carry extra weight as he tries to prepare the team for its regular-season opener Dec. 26 at Charlotte.\n\n\"We've got to play well Saturday and try to build a little momentum,\" Skiles said. \"Typically your first exhibition game, it's strictly a gauge, you're just using it to see where you're at.\n\n\"This is a little bit different because we only have two of them. It's against the same team, so you don't get to see different players and matchups. We've got to settle into some things and at least get our minds wrapped around the fact that everything's important right now.\"\n\nForward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute did not make the trip and has yet to practice while waiting for his work visa issue to be resolved. And Skiles was not sure how much he would be able to use rookie forward Tobias Harris and second-year forward Larry Sanders.\n\nNeither player has gone through a full practice since suffering dehydration issues in practice on Sunday. Both players were hospitalized for two nights and monitored closely this week."
