        "text": "By of the\n\nSt. Francis — Luke Ridnour is back with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThe veteran point guard had a solid three-year run with the Minnesota Timberwolves and wasn't looking to leave while entering the final year of his contract.\n\nBut the business of contracts and player movement often leads to changes. The Timberwolves acquired shooting guard Kevin Martin as part of a three-team deal with the Bucks and Oklahoma City and suddenly the 32-year-old Ridnour was on his way to Milwaukee.\n\nNot that Minnesota coach Rick Adelman, who started Ridnour in 82 games last season, was thrilled about it.\n\n\"We didn't really want to get rid of Luke,\" Adelman said before his team played the Bucks in Sioux Falls, S.D., on Thursday. \"We had to make some moves, and he was the one that everybody wanted, and I know why.\n\n\"He played 82 games for us. I was forced to play him out of position at the 2 guard (shooting guard) spot for two years and he never complained. He was one of our soldiers. I just wish him all the best.\"\n\nThe Bucks knew what they were getting in Ridnour, who played two seasons in Milwaukee before heading to Minnesota.\n\nHe's still the gritty, savvy player who showed up in one of general manager John Hammond's first trades, made with Oklahoma City in the summer of 2008.\n\nAnd Hammond figured Ridnour would be a good veteran to have around with 21-year-old Brandon Knight and rookie Nate Wolters the other point guards on the roster.\n\n\"It takes time to bring it all together, but you have some veteran guys who have been through it and know what it's all about, it makes it a little bit easier,\" Bucks coach Larry Drew said. \"A guy like Luke who has been around this thing for a long time, his leadership and experience does help.\"\n\nRidnour always has been able to adjust to different roster situations. When Brandon Jennings was a rookie with the Bucks in 2009, then-coach Scott Skiles started Jennings, knowing Ridnour could handle being the No. 2 point guard and still would contribute heavily.\n\nIn Minnesota, the Timberwolves had Spanish sensation Ricky Rubio and crafty J.J. Barea, but Adelman still found a way to utilize Ridnour's talents.\n\n\"Ricky is a good kid and that made it a lot easier,\" Ridnour said. \"We just wanted to win. Unfortunately, we had so much other stuff happen, injuries, and we didn't (win).\"\n\nRidnour wound up playing in tandem with Rubio and proved he could complement the former Barcelona star.\n\n\"For teams it's harder to guard,\" Ridnour said. \"You have two guys in pick and rolls, just like when I was here with Brandon.\n\n\"You make things happen; you've got guys who can shoot. It makes it difficult. It seems like every year at some point, you try it out and see what happens.\"\n\nRidnour said he enjoyed playing for Adelman, the veteran coach who had success in both Portland and Sacramento before moving on to Houston and now Minnesota.\n\n\"He understands the game and he puts people in the right places to succeed,\" Ridnour said. \"He called me when the trade went down. He said he wasn't too happy about it, but that's the business of the game.\"\n\nAdelman even had the audacity to have the 6-foot-2 Ridnour defend some small forwards at times.\n\n\"I don't know if it was that or we were just that banged up,\" Ridnour said. \"He would put me on those bigger guys and just let me battle them.\n\n\"On the other end, make them guard pick-and-rolls. I think it made me a better basketball player because I could play different positions.\"\n\nInjuries mounting: Three more players were injured in the Bucks' 98-89 loss to Minnesota on Thursday night, meaning Drew barely had a quorum for practice Friday.\n\nThe latest players to go on the injury list were guard Nate Wolters, who banged his left wrist in a hard fall to the floor in the second half; forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was suffering from knee soreness; and guard Gary Neal, who hurt his left foot in the first half against the Timberwolves.\n\nDrew said he was not sure who would be available for Saturday's home exhibition game against the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nAlready out are Carlos Delfino (foot surgery), Ekpe Udoh (knee), Zaza Pachulia (recovery from Achilles surgery) and Ersan Ilyasova (sprained right ankle suffered Tuesday). None of those players are ready to return and the Bucks announced late Friday that Udoh underwent successful arthroscopic surgery and would be out 4-6 weeks.\n\nUdoh's surgery was performed by Bucks orthopedist Michael Gordon in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\n\"That's thrown a big wrench into things,\" Drew said of the injury woes. \"At the very beginning, we knew of Carlos' situation.\n\n\"We're still waiting on Z to come back, losing Ekpe. I go from having all these big guys to where I'm limited now.\n\n\"We have to adapt accordingly. All the things I wanted to do today, I really couldn't do because we were short-handed.\"\n\nDrew has been trying to limit his regulars' minutes in the preseason despite the injuries. He kept Caron Butler, John Henson and O.J. Mayo around the 20-to-25-minute mark against the Timberwolves.\n\nAntetokounmpo again led the team in minutes played with 28, backup center Miroslav Raduljica played 24 minutes and Stephen Graham played 23 minutes."
