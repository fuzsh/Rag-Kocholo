        "text": "Rudolf Graf von Schönburg, popularly known as Count Rudi, is one of the key figures in the history of Marbella Club Hotel and the town of Marbella. Born on 25 September 1932 in the Wechselburg Castle in Germany, he spent his youth at his family’s property in Saxony until May 1945, when he was forced to take refuge with his family in the western part of the country due to harassment from Russian troops. After finishing college, Count Rudi started his higher education in hotel management in 1953 at the University of Hotel Management in Lausanne (Switzerland), where he obtained his qualification as Hotel Director awarded by the Swiss Society of Hotel Management.\n\nDuring his education, he gained experience in the most prestigious luxury hotels in Switzerland and Germany, until Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe took him on as assistant manager at the recently opened Marbella Club Hotel in 1956. After spending two years in Mexico, Count Rudi returned to Marbella Club Hotel in 1961 to assume the post of General Manager, a post he occupied until 1983. In 1971, he married Princess Maria Luisa of Prussia, great-granddaughter of the last Kaiser of Germany Wilhelm II , and cousin of the emeritus Queen Sofia. Their marriage has produced two children, Countess Sophie and Count Federico. In 1993, he returned to Marbella Club as board member of the company.\n\nIn this interview, we have tried to gain an insight into the life of this extraordinary man who is intelligent, charming, approachable and loving.\n\nYour life and work has been dedicated to Marbella Club Hotel.
