        "text": "Wilhelm Pfister may have passed the chef’s hat to his son, however, he’s still working as an all-rounder at the hotel and looking after his guests.\n\nWilhelm Pfister is the senior chef at our hotel in Mayrhofen. For a long time, he has been running the house together with his wife Elisabeth and his diligent mother Gisela. Now his son Wilhelm junior and his wife Katarina have taken the reins, managing the hotel with lots of passion of dedication. Born in 1956, Wilhelm senior has successfully completely the Villa Blanka college of hotel management and afterwards, gone to Lichtenstein to work as a cook. After his first working experiences in the hotel industry, he travelled to England to follow a language course and work in a travel agency. Once he was back, he worked as a cook and all-rounder at his parents’ traditional hotel. Today he still pitches in when needed. Born a true host, you can mostly find him in the service or behind the bar of your Zillertal accommodation. In his leisure time, he loves hunting and biking."
