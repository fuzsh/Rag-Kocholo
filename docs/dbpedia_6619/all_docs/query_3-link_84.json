        "text": "Warm mulled wine is a delightful drink to enjoy during the winter season. Different cultures have their own variations and the version served in Germany and Austria is known as Glühwein. This festive drink is a holiday tradition in our household and we are happy to share it with you.\n\nGlühwein Basics\n\nThe word “Glühwein” roughly translates to “glow wine.” A traditional Glühwein typically includes a variety of spices such as cinnamon, clove, and star anise. This German mulled wine also features citrus, vanilla, and sugar. It is most often made with red wine, although you can use white wine if you prefer.\n\nThis warmed wine beverage has been around since at least 1420 in Germany. This is based on the discovery of a Glühwein tankard which is thought to have belonged to Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen. He was a German nobleman and was also the first grower of Riesling grapes. Although this is the first known evidence of German Glühwein specifically, mulled wine has existed for even longer. Roman troops were known to drink warm spiced wine in the First Century CE and spread the tradition across the different regions they conquered.\n\nToday, you will see Glühwein at German Christmas markets. It is typically served in mugs and is sometimes consumed mit Schuss with a shot of liquor. This is usually either rum or amaretto.\n\nWilhelm Family Vineyards Glühwein Mix\n\nWilhelm Family Vineyards offers a Glühwein mix that is handmade with care using our winemaker Karyl’s unique recipe. It includes a proprietary blend of spices, fruit flavors, and extracts. You can choose red or white wine and we pair our mix with a specially-selected bottle matched for each year’s release. This delicious mulled wine is sure to get you into the holiday spirit, although you can also enjoy it year-round if you like.\n\nHow to Make Glühwein Using Our Mix\n\nBe sure to shake the mix thoroughly before use to make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed. Pour the mix into a pot and heat it prior to adding the Wilhelm wine of your choice. Combine one part mix with two parts wine for the ideal combination. One bottle of our mix can be combined with a standard bottle of Wilhelm wine (750ml). Be sure that the wine does not boil during the heating process, as this will start to cook off the alcohol. You can garnish your mug with an orange slice and cinnamon sticks for an extra festive feel.\n\nA Great Holiday Gift\n\nOur Glühwein mix is a great holiday gift for friends, family, or even for yourself. You can purchase it online [click here] for a red wine pairing or [click here] for a white wine pairing.\n\nPurchase our Glühwein mix today."
