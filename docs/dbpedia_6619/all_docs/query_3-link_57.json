        "text": "The traffic roars, people hurry by, street artists perform on Breitscheidplatz, Kurfürstendamm is bursting with life … and then a door opens, a rich, deep blue light shines. Silence all around – and suddenly the hectic world is gone. As soon as you step into the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche, bustling Berlin is far, far away. The Gedächtniskirche (Memorial Church) is the most famous landmark in the western city centre and is one of Berlin’s most important churches – but at the same time much more than just that. It is composed of the ruins of the church that was destroyed in the war, as well a modern church building. It is a memorial for peace and reconciliation, commemorates Berliners’ determination to rebuild after the war, and is a place of contemplation.\n\nThe history of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church\n\nIn honour of Wilhelm I, the first German Kaiser, his grandson Wilhelm II planned a magnificent church, which was built by Franz Schwechten between 1891 and 1895 in the Neo-Romantic style. With five spires, the bombastic design reflected the tastes of the time and that of the Kaiser.\n\nThe church bells were the second biggest in Germany after Cologne, and when the church was inaugurated, the five bells rang so loudly that the wolves in the zoo started howling. During the Second World War, the chimes stopped and the five bells were melted down for munitions.\n\nDid you know that LED lights in a double wall provide the blue light of the Memorial Church?\n\nThe story behind Eiermann's ingenious architecture and many other exciting stories about Berlin's history is presented in our app ABOUT BERLIN.\n\nDownload here for free\n\nReconstruction\n\nAir raids in 1943 damaged the church so badly that the top of the main spire broke off and the roof collapsed. At the end of the war, the Allies were unwilling to rebuild it, since it had been a symbol of excessive national pride. The ruin stood as a constant reminder to Berliners of the horrors of war. In 1956, plans to completely demolish the church and build a new one led to angry public protests. As a compromise, the architect Egon Eiermann integrated the ruin in his design for the new church. The present church was completed between 1959 and 1961. The design consists of concrete honeycomb elements with stained glass inlays. Inside the octagonal nave, the stained glass produces a rich blue light and an atmosphere of meditative calm. The memorial hall in the old spire is now a memorial against war and destruction and a symbol of reconciliation. It also contains a crucifix made of nails from the burnt roof timbers of Coventry Cathedral, which was almost completely destroyed by bombs in 1940. The crosses of nails from Coventry, which are also in Dresden, Hiroshima and Volgograd, are a symbol of reconciliation.\n\nRenovation of the church\n\nThe church has been undergoing extensive renovation for several years. From 2009 to 2015 the old spire was hidden under thick tarpaulins. The new spire and chapel are next in line.\n\nChurch services and concerts\n\n10 a.m. Sundays: Protestant service with celebration of the Eucharist.\n\n6 p.m. Sundays: evening service with various themes\n\nEvery 2nd Sunday of the month: “Psalmton” - jazz pop service\n\nEvery 4th Sunday of the month: “500 years of the Reformation”\n\nEvery last Sunday in the month: Eucharist celebration\n\n1 p.m., 5.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. Mondays to Fridays: prayers for peace and short weekday services\n\nEvery day at 1 p.m.: midday prayers for peace\n\nEvery Friday at 1 p.m.: “Reconciliation prayer” from Coventry at the cross of nails in the memorial hall\n\n6 p.m. Saturdays: organ and choral vespers or cantata services, continuing performance of cantata works of Johann Sebastian Bach as part of the church service\n\nIn summer, well-known jazz musicians play in the IN SPIRIT series - the summer night jazz experience.\n\nChristmas market at the Memorial Church\n\nOne of Berlin’s biggest Christmas markets takes place every year on Breitscheidplatz.\n\nGuided tours through the City West\n\nTickets for guided tours\n\nLet us guide you through City West in a small group: On the tour you will learn exciting stories about the Kudamm and discover hidden places at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächstniskirche.\n\nTickets for individual city tours\n\nOpening hours"
