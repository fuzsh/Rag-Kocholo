        "text": "Niagara College alumna Jennifer Wilhelm (Hotel and Restaurant Management, 1999), returned to her NC roots on April 17 to launch her new book, “Sharing a Glass.”\n\nSharing a Glass showcases the women who shaped the foundation of Ontario’s grape and wine industry through a compilation of memoirs, tributes, and untold behind-the-scenes stories of these influential women and their contributions. It shines a light on the exceptional women, often unsung heroes, with an aim to keep them alive in our archives, and our hearts, for their distinctive contributions.\n\nWith over 50 attendees, the event took place at the Wine Visitor + Education Centre at the Daniel J. Patterson Campus. Among the crowd were book contributors, family, friends, members of the press, and the Niagara College community, including six of the nine trailblazing women featured in the book: Dr. Linda Bramble, Donna Lailey, Nicolette Novak, Debi Pratt, Ann Sperling, and Debbie Zimmerman.\n\n“The caliber of our alumni is exemplified in this incredibly special collection of memoirs that Jennifer put together through ‘Sharing a Glass,’” said Jana Boniferro, Director, Alumni Relations. “She is trailblazing her way through the Ontario Grape and Wine industry by underscoring the important role women have played and continue to play. We are honoured that she came back to her alma mater for the launch of her book as this is the very place that shaped her journey.”\n\n“Sharing a Glass” is the first book in Canada to gather and chronicle the significant contributions of women in the Ontario wine scene from its early days. It is more than just a historical record; it pulls readers into the personal and professional challenges these women faced and overcame. The book not only celebrates these women and their legacies, but ensures their valuable insights and wisdom continue to inspire generations of people searching for strong, ethical, role models.\n\nWilhelm captured the spirit of the community during the launch, noting, “’Sharing a Glass’ is more than just the title of this book; sharing a glass is what we do as an industry and a community,” she said. “The support and enthusiasm for this project, as evidenced in this room today, would be exceptional in any other industry. In this wine community, you can count on it. It is what we do.”\n\nThe book is now available for purchase at local wineries, online book retailers, and directly from the publisher. It’s a key resource and a source of inspiration not only for those in the wine industry but also for anyone interested in the powerful stories of pioneering women.\n\nAdditionally, the book’s sales will support the future of the industry, with proceeds going towards a bursary for Niagara College students through an endowment from Galey-Pride. This initiative aligns with the author’s and editor’s commitment to nurturing and supporting the next wave of industry leaders."
