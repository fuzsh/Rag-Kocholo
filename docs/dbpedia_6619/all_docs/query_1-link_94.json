She was also a cousin of Zane Grey's wife, Lina Elise.\n\nLillian Wilhelm was born in Flagstaff, Arizona and grew up in a prospoerous household in New York City. She was the eldest daughter of Henry and Lenore Wilhelm. She showed an interest in art at an early age, and subsequently attended the Art Student's League, the National Academy, the Leonia School of Art in New Jersey, and Columbia University.\n\nHer interest in the American West was first piqued when she attended a William Cody's \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\" at Madison Square Garden in 1907 with Zane Grey. Her relationship with Zane Grey developed when she accompanied him to the Rainbow Bridge in Arizona in 1913 to illustrate his western-themed books. She subsequently accompanied Zane Grey on various trips Kyenta, Arizona, Long Key, Florida, Catalina, California, and visited him several times at his home. During trips to Arizona, she met and developed a firm friendship with John and Louisa Wetherill, and a love of Arizona that would cause her to spend most of her life in the State. She reamined friends with him for many years, although her contact diminished after her marriage to Jess Smith.\n\nShe married Westbrooke Robertson in 1917, but they subsequently divorced in 1924. She quickly married Jesse (Jess) Raymond Smith that same year. Lillian and Jess accepted jobs at guest ranches, Lillian began displaying her art at the Monte Vista Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1929, she worked in the art shop of the newly opened Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, and was permitted to sell her own artwork and Hopi-style china. With Jess, she operated a trading post in Tuba City, an orange grove in Phoenix, and a dude ranch in Sedona.
