The PEEPS® 8-BIT CHRISTMAS Sweepstakes is open only to individuals who, as of entry date, are thirteen (13) years of age and older. Employees and directors of Just Born, Inc. (\"Sponsor\"), Coyne PR (\"Administrator\"), Vertical Marketing (\"Agency\"), Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc. (\"Prize Provider) and each of their respective parent entities, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, advertising, promotion, or production agencies (and their respective IRS dependents, immediate family members [children, spouse, parents, siblings and their respective spouses, regardless of where they reside] and individuals residing in their same household, whether or not related) are not eligible to participate. Void where prohibited. By participating, Entrants (or their parent/legal guardian, if Entrant is deemed a minor in the state of his/her residence) agree to these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor, which are final and binding in all matters relating to this Sweepstakes.\n\n2. HOW TO ENTER: PEEPS® 8-BIT CHRISTMAS Sweepstakes (the \"Sweepstakes\") begins at 12:00:01 a.m. Eastern Time (\"ET\") on November 24, 2021 and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. ET on November 29, 2021 (\"Sweepstakes Period\"). To enter, during the Sweepstakes Period, visit the PEEPS® candy page on Facebook at @peepsbrand. Once there, follow the instructions provided in the Sweepstakes post caption which instructs consumers to comment on a post and automatically receive one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes. All posts must be public to count as entry. Limit one (1) entry per person. Each individual submitting an entry may be referred to hereafter individually as an \"Entrant\" and collectively as \"Entrants\". This Sweepstakes is not sponsored, endorsed, administered by or associated with Facebook. By entering, you are providing the information to Sponsor, and not to Facebook. If you have any questions regarding the Sweepstakes direct them to the Sponsor and not to Facebook.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Entrants must adjust their Facebook account settings to allow for receipt of messages from Sponsor. For this purpose, Entrants will have to set Facebook account settings to 'Public', and take any further necessary steps to ensure receipt of any communication from Sponsor. It is solely Entrant's burden to take any steps necessary to adjust his/her Facebook account settings so that messages can be sent by Sponsor. An Entrant's non-receipt of a message from Sponsor for any reason, including for failure on behalf of Entrant to adjust Facebook account settings, shall be Entrant's, and not Sponsor's fault. Similarly, Sponsor shall not be held liable if they are not able to view an Entrant's entry for any reason, including the failure on behalf of Entrant to adjust his/her Facebook account settings accordingly. By entering this Sweepstakes, each Entrant agrees that the Sponsor has the right to contact the Entrant by Facebook Messenger to administer and fulfill this Sweepstakes.\n\n3. RANDOM DRAWING: Potential winner will be chosen from among all eligible entries/comments received throughout the Sweepstakes Period on or about December 6, 2021 by an independent judging agency on behalf of Sponsor, whose decisions are final and binding in all matters relating to this Sweepstakes. Potential winners will be selected and verified to ensure they have met all promotion guidelines. Potential winners will receive a winner notification by Administrator or Sponsor via message to their Facebook account. Each potential winner (or potential winner's parent or legal guardian if potential winner is a minor in his/her state of legal residence) will be required to be in contact with Administrator and/or Sponsor for winner verification within 24 hours after receiving the initial notification. Upon verification, the verified winner will receive instructions on how to retrieve prize. If any prize notification or attempted notification is returned as undeliverable, the prize will be forfeited and will be awarded to an alternate winner. By accepting a prize, winner (or winner's parent/legal guardian if winner is deemed a minor in the state of his/her legal residence) acknowledges that he/she is in compliance with these Official Rules. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received throughout the Sweepstakes Period.\n\n4.
