        "text": "The E-Sylum: Volume 5, Number 14, March 31, 2002, Article 10 PSEUDONYM OF DR. WILHELM HOETTL While searching the web for more information on Operation Bernhard, the following tidbit about earlier books on the subject turned up. The information is recorded as part of testimony by Dr. Wilhelm Hoettl at the trial of Nazi official Adolf Eichmann in 1961. He wrote The Secret Front and Operation Bernhard (not to be confused with the Anthony Pirie book titled Operation Bernhard): \"The book was originally published under my pseudonym, Walter Hagen, but later in my own name, Dr. Wilhelm Hoettl, particularly for the English and American editions. In reply to the question as to whether I wrote the book primarily as an historian or more as literature, I would state the following: As a responsible historian, I maintain to this day that Die Geheime Front (The Secret Front) is historically sound as far as all the essentials are concerned; it was of course necessary to add minor literary embellishments, since that is the only way to sell enough copies, purely historical works not being known as commercial successes. Just at the time when this book was published I had to depend on it for my income. Asked in this connection about the nature of the book, Unternehmen Bernhard (Operation Bernhard), my reply is as follows: Unlike my first book, The Secret Front, Operation Bernhard is to a large extent a piece of journalism, which can best be compared with the so-called documentary reports which are common today. Although the background to this book - the counterfeiting of Sterling during the Second World War - is historically genuine, and some details I give in the report are based on actual events, the literary make-up is far stronger than in The Secret Front.\" Wilhelm_Hoettl-08.html\n\nWayne Homren, Editor\n\ncoinbooks.org Web"
