Some of his episodes are explosively contro- versial, notably Tito's offer, inspired by Stalin, to join the Germans in repelling any attempted Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast; someâlike the spectacle of the Italian partisans selling their British arms to the Germans, who paid for them in forged Pound notes and used them against the Partisans themselvesâare fadedly grotesque. Mussolini emerges feebly in his so-called Pontine Musings; indeed all the major Axis paladins, except the unspeakable IleVdrich, exhibit a weakness of brain and !yin-power that even now seems vaguely unprobable, though hard to disprove.\n\nThe dominant note is of confusion, divided loyalties and universal bewilderment at the Anglo-American refusal to protect their enemies from Russia.\n\nH.
