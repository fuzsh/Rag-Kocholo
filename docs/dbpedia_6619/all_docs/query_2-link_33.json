        "text": "Many know the famous names of James Bowie, William B. Travis, and David Crockett as men who died defending the Alamo, but there were about 200 others there during the Battle. These men came from a variety of backgrounds and places, but all came together to fight for Texas liberty. Who were they?\n\nA muster roll of the final day of the battle does not exist, and therefore historians reconstruct the list of Defenders from available information. The current list is based on many primary and secondary sources. These include muster roles from the Alamo prior to the Battle, newspaper reports, first-hand accounts of people who were at the Alamo before and during the Battle, land grant claims by descendants of the Alamo Defenders, and other historical evidence.\n\nEach of the Defenders has his own story and reasons for being at the Alamo. Some were native San Antonians of Mexican heritage who were defending their home. Some were recent immigrants from the United States, or even from Europe, and had joined the cause to defend Texas liberty. Explore their histories here."
