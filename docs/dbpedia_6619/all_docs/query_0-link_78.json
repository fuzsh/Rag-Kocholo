        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nWilhelm Böing was the father of William Edward Boeing (WEB), Sr., founder of the Boeing Company. Born in the North Rhine-Westphalia area of Germany on May 3, 1846, Böing was a veteran of the Austro-Prussian War. He immigrated to the United States in 1868 settling in Detroit, Michigan, and started working as a laborer. He soon was hired by Karl Ortmann, a local lumberman and immigrant from Vienna.\n\nBöing married Ortmann's daughter, Marie, on December 25, 1880 and they had two children, William and Caroline. He Anglicized his name to William Boeing. He built his fortune from land, timber, and mineral rights on lands in Minnesota doing very well financially and able to help fund Detroit's first art museum in 1883.\n\nBoeing died from influenza circa 1889-1890 (sources differ) at the age of 42, leaving behind his wife Marie (Ortmann) Boeing and their children.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia, Ancestry.com and Historylink.org"
