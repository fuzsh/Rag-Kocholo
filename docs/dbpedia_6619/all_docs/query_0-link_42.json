        "text": "It took me about half an hour to walk from the centre of Vienna – from the opera house – to the Freud Museum on Berggasse. It's pretty much a straight line: up Augustinerstrasse, along Herrengasse, past the stables of the Spanish Riding School, then straight across Michaelerplatz and on along the street past the Café Central and then across the wide avenue of the Ring by the university. Another few hundred yards and then a right turn down the gentle slope of Berggasse to number 19, the apartment building where Freud lived and practised for 47 years, from 1891-1938, and which has been transformed into a small but fascinating museum.\n\nIt was very quiet the day I went there on an early spring morning four years ago. There was no one about as I passed under the arched entryway with a view of a small inner courtyard beyond. There were three trees growing there, as I recall. I climbed the stairs to the first floor to find two adjacent doors on a landing. There was a sign on one door: \"Prof Dr Freud\". The left-hand door led to the Freud family's private apartments, the other to the consulting rooms. I paused for a moment on the landing and looked down at the courtyard and experienced that strange Proustian shiver – time travel. There was nothing around me, nothing in the view that said 21st century. The thought came to me that I could have been standing here 100 years ago, visiting Prof Dr Freud for a consultation. Ring the bell, be admitted, start the \"talking cure\". What must it have been like to be psychoanalysed in the early years of the 20th century? How weird and risky would it have appeared to decide voluntarily to tell your darkest secrets to a stranger who promised to rid you of your terrible fears and neuroses? It must have seemed the purest mumbo-jumbo, surely. But as I pushed open the door and walked into the deserted museum I knew one thing for sure – I had the idea for a novel.\n\n❦\n\nWhy do certain cities haunt the imagination? Not just the city itself but the city in a particular historical period. In my own case I can identify four such cities – Los Angeles in the 1970s, Lisbon in the 1930s, Berlin in the 1920s and Vienna in the years just before the first world war. Thus captivated, I wrote fiction – short stories, chapters of novels – set in each of these cities long before I ever visited them. This is the mark and measure, I suppose, of their allure – it's vicarious, it works at a great distance – but it must be some conveyed sense of atmosphere, the spirit of place, that prompts the fascination. Perhaps the most telling factor is a powerful feeling that you would like to have lived there yourself.\n\n❦\n\nOne of the amazing aspects of Vienna – or certainly the central city, the Inner Stadt bounded by the great circling boulevard of the Ring, is how easy it is to imagine living there – not just in the early years of the 20th century but in the 19th or even 18th century as well. It's so beautifully preserved and maintained that you can turn a corner and draw up with a shock, imagining that Mozart or Brahms could have seen the identical view. But Vienna in its fading pomp, in the last years of the Austro-Hungarian empire (1867-1918), is present before you in almost every street scene or vista. Freud's Vienna, Wittgenstein's Vienna, Egon Schiele's Vienna.\n\n❦\n\nIt was Egon Schiele who started my Vienna obsession. Schiele and Klimt. Up until the 1970s – when Rudolf Leopold's catalogue raisonné of Schiele's paintings and drawings appeared – Schiele was a virtual unknown. I can remember while I was at university in the 70s the sudden outpouring of postcards and posters, books or reproductions that occurred. Suddenly everyone loved Schiele and was enthralled by his short, tormented life. Schiele's angular, mannered, brilliant draughtsmanship, the blatant near-pornography of his nudes, male and female, were a thrilling revelation. I went to Vienna for the first time to write a piece about Schiele, or to be more precise to write a piece about the Leopold Museum that contains the world's biggest collection of his work. Even after decades of familiarity the actual canvases and drawings retain their power to shock and disturb. In some ways, Schiele is the perfect symbol of the Viennese antithesis – namely that this small, safe, solid, beautiful, bourgeois capital city should have housed in the early years of the 20th century such a contrapuntal, boiling ferment of modernism in every art form.\n\nIt's an interesting thought experiment to stand before Schiele's large, almost life-sized, naked self-portrait – \"Seated Male Nude\" – and imagine what it must have been like to see it for the first time in 1910. The lurid, putrifying colouring, the emaciated body, the orange nipples, the dense, dark pubis, the clumped genitalia, the absence of feet – almost as if they'd been amputated. It's still incredibly, disturbingly powerful. Beside Schiele's graphic audacity, Klimt's etiolated nudes seem almost fey. Klimt's drawings veer tentatively towards eroticism, also, but they seem half-hearted and sketchy beside Schiele. Schiele is one of art history's greatest draughtsmen – up there with Ingres, Degas and Picasso. He was destined to take Klimt's crown as the pre-eminent artist of the Jugendstil movement when Klimt died in February 1918. However, Schiele himself died eight months later, in the influenza pandemic that ravaged Europe and the world at the end of the first world war. He was 28 years old.\n\n❦\n\nSchiele, Klimt and Kokoschka were the great trio of artists that the Viennese Secession produced. Klimt and Schiele died in 1918. Oskar Kokoschka, born in 1886, lived on until 1980 – an astonishing, mind-bending life-span when one considers what he must have lived through. I've never particularly liked Kokoschka's work – what intrigues me about him is his passionate affair with Mahler's widow, Alma – a society beauty and bluestocking somewhat older than Kokoschka. The affair lasted two years from 1912-14 and was unilaterally terminated by Alma because she felt it was getting out of hand, so passionate were the emotions it generated. In despair, Kokoschka had a life-sized wooden replica doll constructed and made to look like Alma that he kept in his studio to console his lovelorn angst and, reputedly, took this Alma-simulacrum to the opera with him as his date. Very Vienna. Again, the city produces another bizarre fusion of the personal and the art-historical that illustrates the modernity of the sexual mores that pullulated beneath the pompous and starchy moral codes that so typified the empire and its values.\n\n❦\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian empire was, as empires go, comparatively short-lived. It began in 1867 with the Ausgleich – the \"Compromise\" – that saw the old Austrian and Hapsburg empire transmogrified into a new Austria-Hungary, a strange hybrid empire with a dual monarchy whose imperial life ended in 1918 with defeat in the first world war. In fact, Austria-Hungary contained many other countries and ethnic groups and 11 recognised languages. This curious amalgam of peoples included Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians and Italians. For the duration of its existence its emperor was Franz Joseph I. He reigned for nearly 68 years, dying in 1916 at the age of 86. The multi-generational length of his reign gave an illusion of permanence, of timeless durability, but as the old man grew ever more aged, so too the prospect of his death generated a collective sense of impending disaster. This growing fearfulness resonates in the literature of the period but there was a general feeling throughout the empire that everything would change once the old gentleman passed away. His son and heir, Crown Prince Rudolf, committed suicide at Mayerling in 1889. Franz Joseph's nephew, Franz Ferdinand, became archduke and the heir presumptive to the empire. There was at least the notion that the dynasty would continue until – in June 1914 – Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, made a state visit to Sarajevo.\n\n❦\n\nAlmost every day, the Emperor Franz Joseph drove in his state coach from his Shönbrunn Palace just outside Vienna to his Hofburg Palace in the centre of the city. And over a six-week period in January and February 1913 this progress was observed from an apartment in nearby Schönbrunner Schloßstrasse by one Josif Dzhugashvili, later to be known to the world as Josef Stalin. Stalin was in Vienna to research and write a communist pamphlet. Intriguingly, Trotsky – Lev Bronstein – was also in Vienna at the time. Trotsky loved the city and lived in Vienna between 1907 and 1914. By one of those extraordinary accidents of history it's entirely possible that, as they wandered through the city, Stalin and Trotsky could have crossed paths with a shabby, odorous young vagrant hawking his talentless watercolours. Adolf Hitler's Vienna years (1908-13) are difficult to document (he took care to expunge as much of the record as possible). However, there are witnesses enough to provide a portrait of a young down-and-out, bearded, long-haired, living in grim hostels with the impoverished flostam and jetsam of the empire, its many castes and races. Apparently Hitler used to wear a rubberised yellow cycling jacket-cum-cape with no shirt underneath. In Vienna's summer heat the rubber made him sweat – and smell. It is eerie to imagine the idea of Hitler, Stalin and Trotsky walking Vienna's streets during those few weeks in 1913 that they were all in the city together. It is a disturbing contemplation: in Vienna in 1913 Hitler was a shabby, mentally disturbed, embittered and near-desperate member of the Austro-Hungarian underclass. Twenty years later he was the chancellor of Germany.\n\n❦\n\nThe great novel of Vienna in those years – Vienna's Ulysses, if you like – is Robert Musil's vast, 1,000-page opus The Man without Qualities. Musil (1880-1942) wrote the novel over a number of years between the wars. It's a curious book, alternating passages of utter tedium with beguiling and acute social observation, but what is particularly intriguing about it is its tone of voice – this is the mindset of the Viennese intellectual at the beginning of the 20th century. Cynical and disenchanted, Ulrich, the principal character, the \"Man without Qualities\", drifts through the upper echelons of Viennese society, visiting friends, half-heartedly participating in public events, enjoying casual affairs and idly watching his Viennese world drifting helplessly, complacently, towards the nemesis of the first world war.\n\nIf Musil is the great novelist of the city, then Joseph Roth (1894-1939) is the great novelist of the empire. Roth was born in the eastern province of Galicia (now part of Poland), and his many works of fiction are a loving recreation of the \"Crown lands\", as the further-flung regions and principalities of the dual monarchy were known. Roth's novels are set in provincial towns and isolated estates, peopled by lonely young officers in decrepit army barracks and melancholy bureaucrats whiling away their lives in rural backwaters. Roth's masterwork, The Radetzky March (1932), barely features Vienna at all, in fact, but, like Musil, he wrote it with the full benefit of hindsight. That world of the empire's twilight years had been forever transformed by the edicts of the Versailles conference in 1919. Austria was now a republic – the victors had split the empire into its various discrete parts, establishing new countries and enlarging and diminishing others. Europe would never be the same again, and both Roth and Musil in their novels bear rueful witness to a vanished world.\n\n❦\n\nNot entirely vanished – traces of that world do remain in Vienna. You can still go to the Café Landtmann where Freud enjoyed a kapuziner and a cigar. You can sit in the Café Sperl – my favourite – and imagine Egon Schiele wandering in with one of his models. You can eat Sachertorte and drink schnapps in the Hotel Sacher and watch the patisserie chefs at work in Demel, much as Roth and Musil would have done. Somehow, Vienna has managed to preserve the authenticity of its old style of life in a way that most other European capitals haven't. It's true that Jean-Paul Sartre would still recognise the Café de Flore, Alberto Moravia the Caffè Greco, and Charles Dickens would feel at home in the Grapes by Limehouse Basin, but the relentless, homogenising, modernising hand of the 20th and 21st centuries is making all cities of western Europe come steadily to resemble each other. But for the moment, at least, parts of Vienna seem miraculously preserved.\n\n❦\n\nPerhaps this is because the clock metaphorically stopped for Vienna when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo in June 1914 and the first world war began a few weeks later. In those first 14 years of the 20th century, Vienna, more than anywhere else, was the fulminating, bewitching crucible where the modern world was invented. It doesn't seem too fanciful to posit the idea of a form of modern renaissance that took place in the city over the first decade or so of the 20th century and that transformed our culture permanently. There have been artistic and social upheavals in other cities at various times – Paris, London, New York and Berlin have all been the cynosure of cultural movements – but was there ever such a concentration of genius across the broad spectrum of thought and culture that could be found in Vienna and the Austro-Hungarian empire during those early years of the 20th century? If we start drawing up some lists of names the idea appears ever more plausible. In literature: Rilke, Kafka, Roth, Musil, Zweig, Schnitzler. Music: Mahler, Schoenberg, Webern, Berg. Architecture: Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos. Painting: Klimt, Schiele and Kokoschka. Philosophy: Wittgenstein and the origins of the Vienna Circle school. Journalism: Karl Kraus. The brew is almost too rich. Then throw in Adolf Hitler and, of course, the sine qua non, Sigmund Freud.\n\n❦\n\nHowever discredited Freud is today, as a thinker and founder of psychoanalysis, there is no doubt that we are, like it or not, all Freudians now. What Freud did – to put it very simply – was to schematise the workings of our unconscious mind. However wrongheaded and unscientific his theories proved to be, they had the effect of creating one of those revolutions in human understanding and self-knowledge that ranks with, for example, Copernicus (we go round the sun, not vice versa) and Darwin (we are animals, part of the fauna of this small planet). Freud established that our conscious mind perhaps accounted for only 50% of our behaviour – the irrational, the unknown, the repressed, the neurotic and the taboo became an irreducible part of the explanation of our human persona. A modern, complex, troubled sensibility was established for the new century – a century that very quickly was going to upset all certainties and all complacent confidence about human progress.\n\n❦\n\nThe first fiction I wrote about Vienna was a short story about Ludwig Wittgenstein called \"Transfigured Night\" (the title is lifted from Schoenberg's exquisite sextet, Verklärte Nacht (1899). I'd studied Wittgenstein at university but became more and more intrigued with the man himself. Wittgenstein was born into a vastly rich and cosmopolitan Jewish-Austrian family who had converted to Catholicism. Three of his brothers killed themselves. Even more intriguingly, he attended the same school as Adolf Hitler – the Realschule in Linz – where they overlapped as pupils for a year in 1904-05. Before the war Wittgenstein went to Cambridge, where he met Bertrand Russell and began to make his name as a philosopher, but he returned to Vienna in 1914 when war broke out and joined up. He fought with gallantry on the Russian and Italian fronts and was decorated. He was captured at Trentino and spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp. It was while he was a prisoner of the Italians that he began to write the seminal work that made his reputation – the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. However, what makes Wittgenstein a true son of Austro-Hungarian Vienna is not so much his difficult and uncompromising philosophy as the way he casually turned his hand to architecture. After the war he contributed to the design and building of a house for his sister, Gretl. There can be very few philosopher-architects (not the same as architect-philosophers – they are legion), but Wittgenstein concentrated his energies on Gretl's house with a fanatical and obsessive attention to detail. Wittgenstein's house still exists (3, Kundmanngasse) and can be visited, even though it now the cultural centre of the Bulgarian embassy. It took minimalism to new heights or rather to a new, bleaker austerity. No carpets or curtains, lit by naked lightbulbs, painted cement walls and ceilings, exposed radiators, with automated metal grilles to shut out the light from the windows – it must have been the most uncomfortable house ever created. It is in its way the best monument to Wittgenstein and the unsparing rigour of his brilliant mind.\n\n❦\n\nJoseph Roth's last, short novel – Die Kapuzinergruft (The Emperor's Tomb is its English title) – is a kind of sequel to The Radetzky March and, rare among his novels, is set largely in Vienna, before, during and after the first world war. At one stage, his central character, Franz Trotta, thinks about his life in the old empire: \"Before me spread the whole bright landscape of life, scarcely bounded by the rim of a far, far distant horizon. I lived in the cheerful, carefree company of young aristocrats whose company, second only to that of artists, I loved best under the old empire. With them I shared a sceptical frivolity, a melancholy curiosity, a wicked insouciance, and the pride of the doomed, all signs of the disintegration which at that time we did not see coming. Above the ebullient glasses from which we drank, invisible Death was already crossing his bony hands.\" The image is telling and powerful, and \"invisible Death\" had an appointment at the rim of that far horizon – in Sarajevo.\n\nRoth's hero feels doomed, as if there was something inevitable about the catastrophe that was coming, but the details of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 could not be a better example of brute chance in action, of utter contingency determining events. In the morning of the 28th, as the royal motorcade drove through the streets of Sarajevo, a bomb had been thrown, bounced off the rear of the archduke's car and exploded further down the street. Warning enough, one might have thought, but Franz Ferdinand proceeded with his duties, attended an official reception at the town hall and made a speech. The motorcade set off again but the driver of the royal car took a wrong turning and headed – irony piling on irony – into Franz Joseph Street. The car stopped and began to reverse out, and its engine stalled. It was at this moment that one member of the gang of Serbian irridentists, Gavrilo Princip – whose assassination attempt had seemed to have ended in total failure – spotted the open-topped car reversing and saw who was in it. He stepped forward and shot Franz Ferdinand in the throat and his wife, Sophie, in the abdomen. Both died shortly after.\n\nThis assassination on 28 June 1914 was the single direct cause of the first world war. It's highly unusual to be able to point to this utterly random congruence of events, this arbitrary chain of sheer happenstance, and to see it as the tipping point, the moment the world changed for ever. Gavrilo Princip's squeeze of the trigger as he aimed at Franz Ferdinand was, so hindsight now tells us, like a shot from a starting pistol. It signalled the end of the Austro-Hungarian empire – and the fact that nothing would ever be the same again. The modern world – our world – had begun."
