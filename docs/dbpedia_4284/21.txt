Synopsis:

Calchas asks the Greek leaders to demand his daughter Cressida from the Trojans in exchange for Antenor, whom the Greeks have captured. The leaders agree and dispatch Diomedes to conduct the exchange of prisoners. The Greek leaders shun Achilles. After Ulysses and Achilles discuss the briefness of fame, and Ulysses attacks Achilles for loving the Trojan Polyxena, Achilles watches as Thersites and Patroclus perform an impromptu playlet mocking Ajax.

⟨Flourish.⟩ Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor,

Agamemnon, Calchas, ⟨Menelaus,⟩ ⌜and Ajax.⌝

CALCHAS

1860 Now, princes, for the service I have done ⟨you,⟩

1861 Th’ advantage of the time prompts me aloud

1862 To call for recompense. Appear it to ⟨your⟩ mind

p. 135

1863 That, through the sight I bear in things to ⌜come,⌝

1864 5 I have abandoned Troy, left my ⌜possessions,⌝

1865 Incurred a traitor’s name, exposed myself,

1866 From certain and possessed conveniences,

1867 To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all

1868 That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition

1869 10 Made tame and most familiar to my nature,

1870 And here, to do you service, am become

1871 As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.

1872 I do beseech you, as in way of taste,

1873 To give me now a little benefit

1874 15 Out of those many regist’red in promise,

1875 Which you say live to come in my behalf.

AGAMEMNON

1876 What wouldst thou of us, Trojan, make demand?

CALCHAS

1877 You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor

1878 Yesterday took. Troy holds him very dear.

1879 20 Oft have you—often have you thanks therefor—

1880 Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,

1881 Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,

1882 I know, is such a wrest in their affairs

1883 That their negotiations all must slack,

1884 25 Wanting his manage; and they will almost

1885 Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,

1886 In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,

1887 And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence

1888 Shall quite strike off all service I have done

1889 30 In most accepted pain.

AGAMEMNON 1890 Let Diomedes bear him,

1891 And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have

1892 What he requests of us. Good Diomed,

1893 Furnish you fairly for this interchange.

1894 35 Withal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow

1895 Be answered in his challenge. Ajax is ready.

p. 137

DIOMEDES

1896 This shall I undertake, and ’tis a burden

1897 Which I am proud to bear.He exits ⌜with Calchas.⌝

Achilles and Patroclus stand in their tent.

ULYSSES

1898 Achilles stands i’ th’ entrance of his tent.

1899 40 Please it our General pass strangely by him

1900 As if he were forgot, and, princes all,

1901 Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.

1902 I will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me

1903 Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on

1904 45 him.

1905 If so, I have derision medicinable

1906 To use between your strangeness and his pride,

1907 Which his own will shall have desire to drink.

1908 It may do good; pride hath no other glass

1909 50 To show itself but pride, for supple knees

1910 Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.

AGAMEMNON

1911 We’ll execute your purpose and put on

1912 A form of strangeness as we pass along;

1913 So do each lord, and either greet him not

1914 55 Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more

1915 Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.

⌜They pass before Achilles and Patroclus. Ulysses

remains in place, reading.⌝

ACHILLES

1916 What, comes the General to speak with me?

1917 You know my mind: I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.

AGAMEMNON, ⌜to Nestor⌝

1918 What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?

NESTOR, ⌜to Achilles⌝

1919 60 Would you, my lord, aught with the General?

ACHILLES 1920 No.

p. 139

NESTOR 1921 Nothing, my lord.

AGAMEMNON 1922 The better.⌜Agamemnon and Nestor exit.⌝

ACHILLES, ⌜to Menelaus⌝ 1923 Good day, good day.

MENELAUS 1924 65How do you? How do you?⌜He exits.⌝

ACHILLES 1925 What, does the cuckold scorn me?

AJAX 1926 How now, Patroclus?

ACHILLES 1927 Good morrow, Ajax.

AJAX 1928 Ha?

ACHILLES 1929 70Good morrow.

AJAX 1930 Ay, and good next day too.⌜He exits.⌝

ACHILLES

1931 What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

PATROCLUS

1932 They pass by strangely. They were used to bend,

1933 To send their smiles before them to Achilles,

1934 75 To come as humbly as they ⌜use⌝ to creep

1935 To holy altars.

ACHILLES 1936 What, am I poor of late?

1937 ’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with Fortune,

1938 Must fall out with men too. What the declined is

1939 80 He shall as soon read in the eyes of others

1940 As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,

1941 Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,

1942 And not a man, for being simply man,

1943 Hath any honor, but honor for those honors

1944 85 That are without him—as place, riches, and favor,

1945 Prizes of accident as oft as merit,

1946 Which, when they fall, as being slippery slanders,

1947 The love that leaned on them, as slippery too,

1948 Doth one pluck down another and together

1949 90 Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me.

1950 Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy,

1951 At ample point, all that I did possess,

1952 Save these men’s looks, who do, methinks, find out

1953 Something not worth in me such rich beholding

p. 141

1954 95 As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.

1955 I’ll interrupt his reading.—How now, Ulysses?

ULYSSES 1956 Now, great Thetis’ son—

ACHILLES 1957 What are you reading?

ULYSSES 1958 A strange fellow here

1959 100 Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,

1960 How much in having, or without or in,

1961 Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,

1962 Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;

1963 As when his virtues, ⟨shining⟩ upon others,

1964 105 Heat them, and they retort that heat again

1965 To the first ⟨giver.⟩

ACHILLES 1966 This is not strange, Ulysses.

1967 The beauty that is borne here in the face

1968 The bearer knows not, but commends itself

1969 110[To others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself,

1970 That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,]

1971 Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed

1972 Salutes each other with each other’s form.

1973 For speculation turns not to itself

1974 115 Till it hath traveled and is ⌜mirrored⌝ there

1975 Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

ULYSSES

1976 I do not strain at the position—

1977 It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,

1978 Who in his circumstance expressly proves

1979 120 That no man is the lord of anything—

1980 Though in and of him there be much consisting—

1981 Till he communicate his parts to others;

1982 Nor doth he of himself know them for aught

1983 Till he behold them formed in the applause

1984 125 Where they’re extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate

1985 The voice again or, like a gate of steel

1986 Fronting the sun, receives and renders back

1987 His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this

1988 And apprehended here immediately

p. 143

1989 130 Th’ unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!

1990 A very horse, that has he knows not what!

1991 Nature, what things there are

1992 Most ⟨abject⟩ in regard, and dear in use,

1993 What things again most dear in the esteem

1994 135 And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—

1995 An act that very chance doth throw upon him—

1996 Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do

1997 While some men leave to do!

1998 How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,

1999 140 Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!

2000 How one man eats into another’s pride,

2001 While pride is fasting in his wantonness!

2002 To see these Grecian lords—why, even already

2003 They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder

2004 145 As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast

2005 And great Troy shrieking.

ACHILLES

2006 I do believe it, for they passed by me

2007 As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me

2008 Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?

ULYSSES

2009 150 Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back

2010 Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,

2011 A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.

2012 Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured

2013 As fast as they are made, forgot as soon

2014 155 As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,

2015 Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang

2016 Quite out of fashion like a rusty ⌜mail⌝

2017 In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,

2018 For honor travels in a strait so narrow

2019 160 Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,

2020 For Emulation hath a thousand sons

2021 That one by one pursue. If you give way

2022 Or turn aside from the direct forthright,

p. 145

2023 Like to an entered tide they all rush by

2024 165 And leave you ⟨hindmost;

2025 Or, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,

2026 Lie there for pavement to the abject ⌜rear,⌝

2027 O’errun and trampled on.⟩ Then what they do in

2028 present,

2029 170 Though less than yours in ⟨past,⟩ must o’ertop yours;

2030 For Time is like a fashionable host

2031 That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand

2032 And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,

2033 Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,

2034 175 And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek

2035 Remuneration for the thing it was,

2036 For beauty, wit,

2037 High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,

2038 Love, friendship, charity are subjects all

2039 180 To envious and calumniating Time.

2040 One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,

2041 That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,

2042 Though they are made and molded of things past,

2043 And ⌜give⌝ to dust that is a little gilt

2044 185 More laud than gilt o’erdusted.

2045 The present eye praises the present object.

2046 Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,

2047 That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,

2048 Since things in motion sooner catch the eye

2049 190⟨Than⟩ what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,

2050 And still it might, and yet it may again,

2051 If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive

2052 And case thy reputation in thy tent,

2053 Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late

2054 195 Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves

2055 And drave great Mars to faction.

ACHILLES 2056 Of this my privacy,

2057 I have strong reasons.

ULYSSES 2058 But ’gainst your privacy

p. 147

2059 200 The reasons are more potent and heroical.

2060 ’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love

2061 With one of Priam’s daughters.

ACHILLES 2062 Ha? Known?

ULYSSES 2063 Is that a wonder?

2064 205 The providence that’s in a watchful state

2065 Knows almost every ⟨grain of Pluto’s gold,⟩

2066 Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive ⌜deep,⌝

2067 Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,

2068 Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.

2069 210 There is a mystery—with whom relation

2070 Durst never meddle—in the soul of state,

2071 Which hath an operation more divine

2072 Than breath or pen can give expressure to.

2073 All the commerce that you have had with Troy

2074 215 As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;

2075 And better would it fit Achilles much

2076 To throw down Hector than Polyxena.

2077 But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home

2078 When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,

2079 220 And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing

2080 “Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,

2081 But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”

2082 Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.

2083 The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.

⌜He exits.⌝

PATROCLUS

2084 225 To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you.

2085 A woman impudent and mannish grown

2086 Is not more loathed than an effeminate man

2087 In time of action. I stand condemned for this.

2088 They think my little stomach to the war,

2089 230 And your great love to me, restrains you thus.

2090 Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid

2091 Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold

p. 149

2092 And, like ⟨a⟩ dewdrop from the lion’s mane,

2093 Be shook to air.

ACHILLES 2094 235 Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

PATROCLUS

2095 Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.

ACHILLES

2096 I see my reputation is at stake;

2097 My fame is shrewdly gored.

PATROCLUS 2098 O, then, beware!

2099 240 Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.

2100 Omission to do what is necessary

2101 Seals a commission to a blank of danger,

2102 And danger, like an ague, subtly taints

2103 Even then when they sit idly in the sun.

ACHILLES

2104 245 Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.

2105 I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him

2106 T’ invite the Trojan lords after the combat

2107 To see us here unarmed. I have a woman’s longing,

2108 An appetite that I am sick withal,

2109 250 To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,

2110 To talk with him, and to behold his visage,

2111 Even to my full of view.

Enter Thersites.

2112 A labor saved.

THERSITES 2113 A wonder!

ACHILLES 2114 255What?

THERSITES 2115 Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for

2116 himself.

ACHILLES 2117 How so?

THERSITES 2118 He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector

2119 260 and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling

2120 that he raves in saying nothing.

ACHILLES 2121 How can that be?

p. 151

THERSITES 2122 Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock—

2123 a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess

2124 265 that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set

2125 down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard,

2126 as who should say “There were wit in this

2127 head an ’twould out”—and so there is, but it lies

2128 as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not

2129 270 show without knocking. The man’s undone forever,

2130 for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat,

2131 he’ll break ’t himself in vainglory. He knows not

2132 me. I said “Good morrow, Ajax,” and he replies

2133 “Thanks, Agamemnon.” What think you of this

2134 275 man that takes me for the General? He’s grown a

2135 very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of

2136 opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a

2137 leather jerkin.

ACHILLES 2138 Thou must be my ambassador ⟨to him,⟩

2139 280 Thersites.

THERSITES 2140 Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody. He professes

2141 not answering; speaking is for beggars; he

2142 wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence.

2143 Let Patroclus make ⟨his⟩ demands to me. You

2144 285 shall see the pageant of Ajax.

ACHILLES 2145 To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire

2146 the valiant Ajax to invite the ⟨most⟩ valorous Hector

2147 to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct

2148 for his person of the magnanimous and

2149 290 most illustrious, six-or-seven-times-honored captain

2150 general of the ⟨Grecian⟩ army, Agamemnon,

2151 ⟨et cetera.⟩ Do this.

PATROCLUS, ⌜to Thersites, who is playing Ajax⌝ 2152 Jove

2153 bless great Ajax.

THERSITES 2154 295Hum!

PATROCLUS 2155 I come from the worthy Achilles—

THERSITES 2156 Ha?

p. 153

PATROCLUS 2157 Who most humbly desires you to invite

2158 Hector to his tent—

THERSITES 2159 300Hum!

PATROCLUS 2160 And to procure safe-conduct from

2161 Agamemnon.

THERSITES 2162 Agamemnon?

PATROCLUS 2163 Ay, my lord.

THERSITES 2164 305Ha!

PATROCLUS 2165 What say you to ’t?

THERSITES 2166 God b’ wi’ you, with all my heart.

PATROCLUS 2167 Your answer, sir.

THERSITES 2168 If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the

2169 310 clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he

2170 shall pay for me ere he has me.

PATROCLUS 2171 Your answer, sir.

THERSITES 2172 Fare you well with all my heart.

⌜He pretends to exit.⌝

ACHILLES 2173 Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

THERSITES 2174 315No, but ⟨he’s⟩ out of tune thus. What music

2175 will be in him when Hector has knocked out his

2176 brains I know not. But I am sure none, unless the

2177 fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.

ACHILLES 2178 Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him

2179 320 straight.

THERSITES 2180 Let me bear another to his horse, for that’s

2181 the more capable creature.

ACHILLES

2182 My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirred,

2183 And I myself see not the bottom of it.

⌜Achilles and Patroclus exit.⌝

THERSITES 2184 325Would the fountain of your mind were clear

2185 again, that I might water an ass at it. I had rather

2186 be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

⌜He exits.⌝
