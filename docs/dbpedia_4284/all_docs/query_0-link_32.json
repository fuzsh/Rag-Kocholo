This will take you to the first instance the name appears on the Master List. If there are several choices use the arrows next to the search box to scroll through them.\n\nSEARCH ENGINE: Typing a name into the SEARCH BOX at the top of each webpage allows you to search the entire website for data; It reads all of the CAPTIONS beneath the images, the REFERENCE LIBRARY and GLOSSARY and lists all the instances where the name occurs.\n\nOPENING A MAIN SPECIES PAGE: Once you've found a taxon you wish to view select the highlighted COMMON NAME or DISTRIBUTION NOTES which will open the MAIN SPECIES PAGE. Selecting the thumbnails on this page will open the image pages.\n\nUSING THE THUMBNAIL PAGES:\n\n(Note: The links to thumbnails pages will highlight with a black background when you \"hover\" your mouse over the link and a small text box called a tool tip will appear telling you where the link will go).\n\n- FAMILY THUMBNAILS: Selecting the blue highlighted name within a FAMILY, SUBFAMILY or TRIBE name will display all the thumbnail images for that group. Caution: if you have a slower internet connection selecting a large group could take a very long time to complete.\n\n- GENUS THUMBNAILS: To view all the thumbnails for a genus select the first blue highlighted name in the series.\n\n- SPECIES THUMBNAILS: To view just the thumbnail images for a single species choose the first highlighted SPECIES name in the series\n\n- SUBSPECIES THUMBNAILS: To view just the thumbnail images for a single subspecies choose the SUBSPECIES or AUTHORS name."
