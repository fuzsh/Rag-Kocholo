        "meta_description": "Cet article prend pour point de départ une tradition rapportée par les scholies homériques et par l’invective politique athénienne du quatrième siècle : quand Solon rejoint l’agora pour réciter un poème exhortant les Athéniens à renouveler la guerre contre Salamine (fr. 1-3 W), il aurait repris un geste attribué à Ulysse (Iliade, 2, 183). Tel le héros épique face au défaitisme des soldats, Solon aurait deposé son manteau ou chlaina. La discussion présentée ici propose une nouvelle lecture des fr. 1-3 qui vise à montrer non seulement que le lien de Solon avec ce précédent homérique est beaucoup plus profond que ne l’ont reconnu les commentateurs antérieurs, mais que le poète athénien se réfère également à une tout autre tradition poétique, celle de la poésie iambique. Modelant son discours et son comportement quasi-épique sur ceux de praticiens mythiques et historiques du ridicule et de l’abus, en tête le Thersite iliadique et Archiloque – à qui il emprunte la posture de héraut adopté par le poète parien, en deux occasions, pour déclamer un poème injurieux ou obscène – Solon endosse le rôle du moqueur autorisé. L’article se termine en examinant les traces du geste de Solon dans les oeuvres de Critias, le poète-politicien athénien qui, tout en se référant à Solon, prend pour cible le personnage construit par Archiloque ; l’hypothèse avancée ici est un parallélisme déjà visible chez Homère, et concentré autour d’Ulysse, entre l’abandon du bouclier et celui de la chlaina.",

        "text": "αὐτὸς κῆρυξ ἦλθον ἀφ' ἱμερτῆς Σαλαμῖνος,\n\nκόσμον ἐπέων ὠιδὴν ἀντ' ἀγορῆς θέμενος.\n\nεἴην δὴ τότ' ἐγὼ Φολεγάνδριος ἢ Σικινήτης\n\nἀντί γ' Ἀθηναίου πατρίδ' ἀμειψάμενος·\n\nαἶψα γὰρ ἂν φάτις ἥδε μετ' ἀνθρώποισι γένοιτο·\n\n“Ἀττικὸς οὗτος ἀνήρ, τῶν Σαλαμιναφετέων”.\n\nἴομεν ἐς Σαλαμῖνα μαχησόμενοι περὶ νήσου\n\nἱμερτῆς χαλεπόν τ' αἶσχος ἀπωσόμενοι.\n\n(Solon fr. 1-3 W)\n\n1According to a tradition found in the Iliadic scholia, life replicates art. When Solon went into the Athenian agora to deliver his poem of martial exhortation, urging the Athenians to resume their war on Salamis, he supposedly acted in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus in Iliad book 2. There, roused by Athena, the epic hero runs through the camp so as to stem the tide of Achaeans as they, having taken Agamemnon’s speech of deception urging abandoning the Trojan War at face value, begin to rush headlong to their ships. Citing the Homeric phrase used of Odysseus as he races off to stop the ignominious flight – “he threw off his chlaina” (183) – the scholion then reports a remark from the Homeric Problems of Ps.-Aristotle (Aristotle fr. 368 Gigon) and comments:\n\nIt seems to be inappropriate for Odysseus to run through the camp wearing only his chiton, having cast off his chlaina, and most of all inappropriate for someone of the sort Odysseus is supposed to be. But Aristotle says that he did it so that the crowd might turn back in amazement and his voice might reach a great area and people would gather from all directions as also Solon is said to have done, when he was gathering a crowd on account of Salamis.\n\n3Events in Iliad 2, the symposium and the licensed abuse in its midst are central to the second part of my paper. As I argue, in styling himself herald in fr. 1, Solon not only takes his cue from the Iliadic Odysseus’ assumption of that role, but from a second figure highly relevant to his self-construction here and, again, to the invective that his elegy includes. By reading the Salamis poem in conjunction with two compositions in which Archilochus anticipates Solon’s stratagem by adopting the herald’s identity, we see how Solon not only authorizes his latter day performance, but gains additional status and impunity. No less than Odysseus, the persona of Archilochus is eminently suited to Solon’s self-fashioning here: at once a soldier, politician and poet, Archilochus would have used his sympotic poetry as a way of advancing his ends in the more public, civic sphere.\n\nThe Salamis Elegy and Iliad 2\n\n5Very briefly, then, a recapitulation of the sequence of events following Agamemnon’s lying address at the start of Iliad 2. Taking his words at face value, and believing that their leader is urging a return to Greece, the Achaean troops begin to stampede to the ships. Odysseus, roused by Athena, succeeds in stopping their headlong flight and returns the soldiers to the agora. There, before he is able to deliver his speech exhorting the army to continue the fight, the brawler Thersites makes his harangue, vilifying Agamemnon, lauding Achilles, and advocating abandoning the war. Odysseus, using both a verbal counterattack and physical assault, silences the calumnist and then proceeds with his (thoroughly successful) military paraenesis. In what follows, I detail the elements of the Odysseus-Thersites confrontation so as to demonstrate just how closely Solon and those reporting the circumstances surrounding the Salamis poem have drawn on the Iliadic episode.\n\n14If poets from the archaic through the Hellenistic age embed the absence of the cloak within iambic discourse, then fourth-century Athenian orators and statesmen include the motif in the political invective that appropriates so many of the tropes of the poetic genre. Within Aeschines’ attack on Timarchus, this departure from normative standards of public dress typifies the individual who recalls Thersites on a triple count; possessing his signature shamelessness, the object of abuse also misadvises the demos, and is shown up as lacking the legitimacy required to mount the bema so as to make a political address in the public forum. Here Aeschines not only portrays Timarchus as the quintessence of indecorum, but contrasts him with Solon and other statesmen of earlier times: “They were too modest to speak having the arm outside the cloak, but this man not long ago…in an assembly of the people threw off his cloak and leaped about like a gymnast, his body in such a state of wretchedness and shameful ugliness (κακῶς καὶ αἰσχρῶς διακείμενος τὸ σῶμα) that right-minded men, at least, covered their eyes, being ashamed for the city” (26). Further to prove his point, Aeschines then cites a statue of Solon erected in the agora at Salamis, showing the statesman adopting the requisite decorous – and the term is εὐκοσμία - hand-in-cloak stance.\n\nArchilochus: a missing link?\n\nἐρέω τιν’ ὕμιν αἶνον, ὦ Κηρυκίδη,\n\nἀχνυμένη σκυτάλη,\n\nπίθηκος ἤιει θηρίων ἀποκριθεὶς\n\nμοῦνος ἀν' ἐσχατιήν,\n\nτῶι δ' ἆρ' ἀλώπηξ κερδαλῆ συνήντετο,\n\nπυκνὸν ἔχουσα νόον.\n\n27Reinforcing the links between Thersites and Kerykides is the correspondence between the sceptre and skutale in the epic and iambic scenarios. In Iliad 2, when Thersites appears to address the troops he conspicuously lacks the baton that equips both Agamemnon and Odysseus as public speakers, and whose absence indicates the abuser’s unfitness for the role he has assumed. In fr. 185, not only has Archilochus de-authorized and silenced Kerykides by appropriating his herald’s staff; like Odysseus who beats Thersites into silence with the baton, he too deploys it to deliver chastisement. Reading ἀχνυμένη in the objective sense, the participle anticipates the grief that the fable will cause Kerykides. The “grief-full” nature of the blow that Odysseus’s skeptron inflicts on Thersites receives particular emphasis in Iliad 2; as the victim wipes away the tears generated by his bodily ἀλγός, the poet describes the internal audience as grieving, ἀχνύμενοι (270), perhaps a result of the empathy that, for all their laughter, they feel with the target of the assault.\n\n29My suggestion, then, is that Solon’s Salamis elegy treats the Archilochean precedent as a “window text”, re-deploying the Homeric echoes that fr. 185 already includes and investing the Athenian poet’s Odyssean role with all the additional authority and license to attack his political opponents that the (also Odyssean) mask of the Parian iambographer affords. It may not be happenstance that the phrase “lovely Salamis” that demarcates Solon’s poem’s opening and close has an “Archilochean” ring, using an epithet applied twice by the Parian poet to his own and other lands (so of Paros in fr. 166.3 W and, negated here, of Thasos in fr. 22 W); so too the diction and meter of αἶσχος ἀπωσόμενοι with which fr. 3 ends exactly matches the close of Archilochus’ elegiac fr. 13, πένθος ἀπωσάμενοι. These echoes aside, there are larger benefits to be derived from including Archilochus’ heraldic voice within the Salamis elegy: although there is no establishing at what point the poet became a recipient of hero cult on Paros (most probably in the late sixth or early fifth century), the biographical tradition surrounding that cult lays special emphasis on Archilochus’ patriotism and military achievements. If – and there can be no certainty here – some of these elements of the poet’s biography were already in place when Solon’s elegy assumed its present form, then the paradigm of the patriotic soldier-poet, no less than the story of Archilochus’ vilification, exile and later heroization, would suit Solon’s self-construction very well.\n\nOdysseus, Archilochus and Solon in Critias’ Athens\n\n30The third and final figure in the poetic-political catena reconstructed here is the statesman, polygeneric author and sophist Critias, the late fifth-century oligarch so implicated in attacks on the radical Athenian democracy. After first signaling Critias’ close relations with Solon and his poetry, evident in his redeployment of his predecessor’s words and even, on occasion, stance, I then turn to the invective he composed against Archilochus. As I aim to show, the charges leveled against the Parian poet, and chief among these his supposed abandonment of his shield, may display – albeit in circuitous ways – affinities with the conduct of Odysseus in Iliad 2 and freshly illuminate the links between that episode and Solon’s delivery of his Salamis elegy."
