        "text": "The American Journal of Archaeology has an uninterrupted history of publication that began in 1885. Archaeological discoveries, theoretical discussions, and countless in-depth reviews of books are just some of the hallmarks of our top-tier quarterly. The journal is also distinct in its field for its initiatives to stay current and visible in an constantly evolving digital age.\n\nThe timeline slideshow below was compiled by the journal staff and is a series of snapshots that capture the AJA story to date. We hope you enjoy browsing through it."
