O enfoque não será posto na avaliação da qualidade literária dos textos em francês em comparação com os textos originais, em grego, mas nas motivações que levaram essa autora a traduzir os poemas sáficos, assim como na sua escolha explícita em afirmar o homoerotismo poético, expresso no feminino, que pode ser lido nesses fragmentos e que, a contragosto ou não, impôs-se, em alguma medida, à crítica que se dedicou a comentá-los como uma questão incontornável. Abstract: The purpose of this article is to present and to comment, briefly, the French translation / versions made by Renée Vivien (1877-1909) of two compositions attributed to the poet Sappho of Lesbos (VII-VI BCE). The aim here is not to discuss the literary value of the French translation, in parallel to the Greek text, but the reasons why this author decided to translate the Sappho's poems and her explicit choice in asserting the poetical homoeroticism, expressed in the feminine, which can be ready in these fragments and that, like it or not, impose itself upon the critic reviews as if it is an unavoidable question."
