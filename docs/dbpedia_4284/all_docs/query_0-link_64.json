Patented Feb. 18,1879,\n\nwhi \"Manama-Inna.\n\nLIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD.\n\nUNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.\n\nAUGUSTE BARTHOLDI, OF PARIS, FRANCE.\n\nDESIGN FOR A STATUE.\n\nSpecification forming part of Design No. 11,028, dated February 18, 1879; application filed January 2, 1879. [Term of patent 14 years] To all whom it may concern:\n\nBe it known that I, Auous'rn BARTHOLDI, of Paris, in the Republic of France, have originated and produced a Design of a Monumental Statue, representing Liberty enlightening the world, being intended as a commenorative monument of the independence of the United States; and I hereby declare the following to be a full, clear. and exact description of the same, reference being bad to the accompanying illustration, which I submit as part of this specification.\n\nThe statue is that of a female figure standing erect upon a pedestal or block, the body being thrown slightly over to the left, so as to gravitate upon the left leg, the whole figure being thus in equilibrium, and symmetrically arranged with respect to a erpendicular line or axis passing through the ead and left foot. The right leg, with its lower limb thrown back, is bent, resting upon the bent toe, thus giving grace to the general attitude of the figure. The body is clothed in the classical drapery, being a stola, or mantle gathered in upon the left shoulder and thrown over the skirt or tunic or under-garment, which drops in voluminous folds upon the feet. The right arm is thrown up and stretched out, with a flamboyant torch grasped in the hand. The flame of the torch is thus held high up above the figure. The arm is nude; the drapery of the sleeve is dropping down upon the shoulder in voluminous folds. In the left arm, which is falling against the body, is held a tablet, upon which is inscribed 4th July, 1776.\" This tablet is made to rest against the side of the body, above the hip, and so as to occupy an inclined position with relation thereto, exhibiting the inscription. The left hand clasps the tablet so as to bring the four fingers onto the face thereof. The head, with its classical, yet severe and calm. features, is surmounted by a crown or diadem, from which radiate divergingly seven rays, tapering from'the crown, and representing a halo. The feet are bare and sandal-strapped.\n\nThis design may be carried out in any manner known to the glyptic art in the form of a statue or statuette, or in alto-relieve or bassrelief, in metal, stone, terra-cotta, plaster-ofparis, or other plastic composition. It may also he carried out pictorially in print from engravings on metal, wood, or stone. or by photographing or otherwise.\n\nWhat I claim as my invention is The herein-described design of a statue representing Liberty enlightening the world, the same consisting, essentially. of the draped female figure, with one arm upraised, bearing a torch, while the other holds an inscribed tablet. and having upon the head a diadem, substantially as set forth.\n\nIn testimony whereof I have signed this specification in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n\nA. BARTHOLDI. Witnesses:\n\nC. TERINIER. Corrm."
