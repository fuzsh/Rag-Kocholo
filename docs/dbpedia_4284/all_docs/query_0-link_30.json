We reviewed recently published books and papers including the six volumes of Mammals of Africa to develop an up-to-date annotated checklist of all mammals recorded from Kenya. A total of 390 species have been identified in the country, including 106 species of rodents, 104 species of bats, 63 species of even-toed ungulates (including whales and dolphins), 36 species of insectivores and carnivores, 19 species of primates, five species of elephant shrews, four species of hyraxes and odd-toed ungulates, three species of afrosoricids, pangolins, and hares, and one species of aardvark, elephant, sirenian and hedgehog. The number of species in this checklist is expected to increase with additional surveys and as the taxonomic status of small mammals (e.g., bats, shrews and rodents) becomes better understood.\n\nKeywords: Checklist, Rodents, Bats, Ungulate, Carnivores, Shrews, Kenya\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nKenya lies astride the equator on the eastern coast of Africa. It is a medium-sized country, covering an area of about 582 646 km2. The geography of Kenya is highly diverse, with various landforms that include coastline, lake basins, plains, hills, high mountains, and deserts. Similarly, the Kenyan climate is diverse and varies with geographical location. For example, rainfall and temperature are influenced by changes in altitude and distance to the coast and Lake Victoria. The Kenyan coast (0–100 m a.s.l.) is warm and humid, receiving about 1 000 mm of rainfall per year; the central highlands (1 000–2 500 m a.s.l.) are cool and humid, receiving the highest rainfall (over 2 000 mm per year) in Kenya; the hot and dry regions of northern and eastern Kenya (200–700 m a.s.l.) receive the lowest rainfall (<300 mm per year) (Bennun & Njoroge, 1999). Frost regularly occurs above 2 400 m a.s.l., with the hottest area (mean maximum temperature of 34 °C) being Lake Turkana (Bennun & Njoroge, 1999). The variations in rainfall, temperature, topography and landuse together influence the biomes and ecoregions of Kenya. Due to the complex topography, vegetation types and variation in climate, Kenya harbors a large diversity of organisms, with about 25 000 species of fauna and 7 000 species of flora currently recorded, along with at least 2 000 species of fungi and bacteria (NBU, 1992).\n\nOver 10% of the country’s land area is presently gazetted as a national park, national reserve or forest reserve (Bennun & Njoroge, 1999). However, these protected areas were primarily established because they: 1) contain considerable populations of ‘big game’ (i.e., large mammals), which attract visitors; (2) are important water catchment areas; (3) support valuable timber for exploitation; or (4) contain few resident people at the time of establishment (Bennun & Njoroge, 1999). Thus, these protected areas were typically not established for the conservation of Kenya’s many smaller mammalian species such as hedgehogs, bats, rodents, otter-shrews, shrews, hares and elephant-shrews. More than 80% of Kenya’s land area is not under legal protection and is predominantly comprised of degraded vegetation, agriculture and settlement, resulting in ongoing loss of suitable natural habitats for mammals. However, a small but significant proportion of the unprotected zones are conserved as privately or community owned ranches and conservancies, which can support relatively undisturbed natural habitats, providing important refuges for some mammals. For many of Kenya’s protected areas, conservancies and ranches, only checklists of larger mammals are typically available. The remoteness, difficulty of access and security concerns in northern and some parts of eastern Kenya have made this region difficult to survey. For example, an apparently new giant sengi (Rhynchocyon sp.) was recorded in the Boni-Dodori Forest (Andanje et al., 2010) but the risk of attack and kidnappings by Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militants has prevented any further research on the species. The study of small mammals in Kenya, as elsewhere on the continent, is also hampered by a shortage of experienced taxonomists. Hence, compared with large mammals, there is a dearth of knowledge on the distribution and ecology of small mammals in Kenya.\n\nSpecies checklists constitute alpha-diversity descriptors of the taxonomic richness of a given country (Whittaker, 1972), and are important tools for the effective conservation of threatened species at the national level (Amori et al., 2011). Past checklists of Kenyan mammals were published in the 1920s to early 1990s. These included checklists for Insectívora, Chiroptera, and Carnivora (Hollister, 1918), Chiroptera (Aggundey & Schlitter, 1984), Insectivora and Macroscelidea (Aggundey & Schlitter, 1986), Kingdon’s volumes of East African Mammals (Kingdon, 1974a, 1974b, 1977, 1982a, 1982b, 1984), Kingdon’s Field Guide to African Mammals (Kingdon, 1997), Mammals of East Africa, including Kenya (Davies & Vanden Berghe, 1994), and Key to Bats of East Africa (Patterson & Webala, 2012). However, these checklists are now outdated and incomplete. In the past 24 years since the last checklist (Davies & Vanden Berghe, 1994), no attempt has been made to compile and publish a revised checklist of mammals in Kenya, even though a good deal of research has been conducted during the same period. Therefore, an updated complete checklist of mammal species is both warranted and of great conservation importance. This current checklist attempts to update the list of all mammals recorded in Kenya, and thus reflects recent advances in research of Kenyan mammals.\n\nMETHOD OF CHECKLIST PREPARATION\n\nThe current checklist was compiled by reviewing the six volumes of the Mammals of Africa (MOA): Vol. 1 (Introductory Chapters and Afrotheria: Kingdon et al., 2013), Vol. 2 (Primates: Butynski et al., 2013), Vol. 3 (Rodents, Hares and Rabbits: Happold D, 2013a), Vol. 4 (Hedgehogs, Shrews and Bats: Happold M & Happold D, 2013), Vol. 5 (Pigs, Hippopotamuses, Chevrotain, Giraffes, Deer and Bovids: Kingdon & Hoffman, 2013a), and Vol. 6 (Carnivores, Pangolins, Equids and Rhinoceroses: Kingdon & Hoffman, 2013b); Rodents of Sub-Saharan Africa: A Biogeographic and Taxonomic Synthesis (Monadjem et al., 2015), Keys to the Bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) of East Africa (Patterson & Webala, 2012), and the IUCN website (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2017) (only for Cetaceans). Prior changes in the taxonomy of each taxon are not included in this checklist because respective volumes of the MOA provide detailed information on the same. However, changes stemming from more recent literature are noted. Nomenclature follows the MOA, except where noted. We recognized the families Miniopteridae (Miller-Butterworth et al., 2007) and Rhinonycteridae (Foley et al., 2015) for bats and Heterocephalidae for rodents (Patterson & Upham, 2014). The checklist, which covers both terrestrial and aquatic (freshwater and marine) species, is presented by order, family, genus, scientific name, species authority, preferred common English, Swahili (English Coastal Swahili Dictionary online (ECSDO), 2016; Kingdon, 1974a, 1974b, 1977, 1982a, 1982b, 1984, 1997), and Chinese names (mostly following Wang et al., 2001), distributional range in Africa and Kenya, and the broad habitat types where it occurs. Cetacean species (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 2017) were included in the list if their distribution range encompassed the shallow marine habitat over the continental shelf and deep sea of the Indian Ocean along Kenya’s coastline. Introduced species without a wild breeding population, those not confirmed to occur in Kenya, and those locally extinct are not included in the list.\n\nCHECKLIST OF MAMMALS\n\nORDER HYRACOIDEA (Hyraxes–four species)\n\nFamily PROCAVIIDAE\n\nGenus Dendrohyrax Gray, 1868.

We have followed Monadjem et al. (2015) who considered T. rex, T. annectens, T. ibeanus, T. spalacinus and T. ruddi as valid species in Kenya based on morphometric analysis and the distinct biogeographic and ecological distributions of each species.\n\n47.\n\nTachyoryctes annectens (Thomas, 1981). English: Mianzini Root-rat. Swahili: Fuko/Mizizi Panya. Chinese: 美兹尼鼹鼠. Included within T. splendens by Jarvis (2013a). Endemic to Kenya. Subterranean in well-drained soils in savanna habitats.

English: Angolan Collared Fruit Bat. Chinese: 安哥拉领果蝠. This species was formerly referred to as Lissonycteris angolensis, but a recent molecular review of the tribe Myonycterini placed Lissonycteris within the genus Myonycteris (Nesi et al., 2013).

In Kenya, widely distributed, mostly W of the Rift Valley.\n\n194.\n\nRhinolophus fumigatus Rüppell, 1842. English: Rüppell’s Horseshoe Bat. Chinese: 达马拉菊头蝠. Highly disjunct records from Senegal to Cameroon in West Africa, and also disjunctions from NE Gabon and N Congo southwards to Angola and Namibia, and from Eritrea, E Sudan, Ethiopia and NE DR Congo southwards to NE South Africa. Found in woodland savannas (Cotterill & Happold M, 2013a).

Chinese: 兰德菊头蝠. Widespread but disjunct records in sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia and southwards to NE South Africa. Found in a very wide variety of habitats (Happold M, 2013i). A recent study showed that savanna populations in South and East Africa represent a distinct species of R. lobatus (Taylor et al., 2018), which is likely widely distributed in Kenya.\n\n197.\n\nRhinolophus simulator K. Andersen, 1904. English: Bushveld Horseshoe Bat. Chinese: 布什维尔德菊头蝠. Highly disjunct records in West Africa (Guinea to W Cameroon) and also disjuncts from C Ethiopia and S Sudan to NE South Africa. Found in various habitats, including rainforests, montane forests, wetter woodland savannas, coastal mosaics and valley bushveld, but probably only near caves and/or abandoned mines (Cotterill & Happold M, 2013c). In Kenya, recorded from the W and SE.\n\nFamily HIPPOSIDERIDAE\n\nSpecies traditionally treated as within the genus Hipposideros have been recently allocated to three different genera, namely Hipposideros, Doryrhina and Macronycteris (Foley et al., 2017).\n\nGenus Doryrhina Peters, 1871. Leaf-nosed Bats\n\nFoley et al. (2017) placed Hipposideros cyclops in Doryrhina, but their study did not include H. camerunensis. Because cyclops and camerunensis are traditionally considered to be very closely related, we provisionally placed camerunensis in Doryrhina; however, this needs confirmation.\n\n198.\n\nDoryrhina camerunensis (Eisentraut, 1956). English: Cameroon Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese; 喀麦隆蹄蝠. Originally described as Hipposideros camerunensis but see Genus Doryrhina above. Disjunct records from S Cameroon, E DR Congo and W Kenya. Found in montane and lowland rainforests (Happold M, 2013j as Hipposideros camerunensis). In Kenya, recorded only from North Nandi and Kakamega forests in the W, in degraded montane forest and intermediate evergreen forest, respectively.\n\n199.\n\nDoryrhina cyclops (Temminck, 1853). English: Cyclops Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese: 大眼蹄蝠. Disjunct records from Senegal to coastal Kenya and Tanzania. Found mostly in lowland rainforests, but also in coastal, montane, swamp and mangrove forests (Fahr, 2013a as Hipposideros cyclops). In Kenya, recorded only from small areas in the SW and SE.\n\nGenus Hipposideros Gray, 1831. Old World Leaf-nosed Bats\n\n200.\n\nHipposideros caffer (Sundevall, 1846). English: Sundevall’s Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese: 松氏蹄蝠. Widespread in many African countries. Found in woodland savannas (Bernard & Happold M, 2013b). In Kenya, H. caffer is widely distributed from W of the Rift Valley to the C and E along the coastal strip. However, taxonomic revision is required as H. caffer is considered to be a species complex (Kock et al., 2008; Vallo et al., 2008). Three subspecies were listed by Simmons (2005), including: H. c. angolensis Seabra, 1898; H. c. nanus J.A. Allen, 1917; and H. c. tephrus Cabrera, 1906. However, a study by Vallo et al. (2008) revealed two distinct clades, H. c. caffer and H. c. tephrus, respectively, inhabiting southern Africa and the Maghreb, West Africa and Arabian Peninsula. Whether East African populations belong to either of the two clades or to a distinct one requires investigation.\n\n201.\n\nHipposideros megalotis (Heuglin, 1862). English: Large-eared Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese: 串耳蹄蝠. Recorded from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya. Found in afro-montane vegetation and various wooded grasslands, bush lands and thickets, and semi-desert grasslands (Happold M, 2013k). In Kenya, recorded in W and C regions.\n\n202.\n\nHipposideros ruber (Noack, 1893). English: Noack’s Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese: 诺氏蹄蝠. Vallo et al. (2008) recognized several species lineages within the caffer-ruber complex throughout Africa, a view supported by Monadjem et al. (2013b). Molecular data are, therefore, required to resolve the taxonomy of the group. In fact, according to Vallo et al. (2008), H. ruber is only found in East Africa. In Kenya, the species is only recorded from the W and SE (Happold M, 2013l).\n\nGenus Macronycteris Gray, 1866. Leaf-nosed Bats\n\n203.\n\nMacronycteris gigas (Wagner, 1845). English: Giant Leaf-nosed Bat. Chinese: 巨蹄蝠. Recorded disjunctly from West, Central and East Africa. Found in lowland tropical rainforests, East African coastal forests and wetter woodland savannas.

Highly disjunct records from N Nigeria and N Cameroon, from the eastern side of Africa (from Ethiopia and Somalia to NE South Africa), and from SW Angola. Found in a wide variety of habitats. In Kenya, recorded only in the SE, in coastal forests and adjacent bushland (Happold M, 2013n as Hipposideros vittatus).\n\nFamily RHINONYCTERIDAE\n\nFollowing Foley et al. (2015, 2017), we recognize the family Rhinonycteridae as distinct from the family Hipposideridae, to which we allocate the genera Cloeotis and Triaenops.\n\nGenus Cloeotis Blyth, 1848. Percival’s Trident Bat\n\n205.\n\nCloeotis percivali Thomas, 1901. English: Percival’s Trident Bat. Chinese: 珀氏三叉蝠.

Widespread but disjunct records from Senegal to Eritrea and W Somalia (although not most of Ethiopia) and southwards to Gabon, DR Congo, C Zambia, N Malawi and Tanzania. Mostly found in woodland savannas with abundant acacias, but also various other habitats (excluding closed rainforest) (Happold M, 2013q). In Kenya, widely distributed W of the Rift Valley and along the coastal strip.\n\nFamily RHINOPOMATIDAE\n\nGenus Rhinopoma É. Geoffroy, 1818. Mouse-tailed Bats\n\n209.\n\nRhinopoma macinnesi Hayman, 1937. English: Macinnes’s Mouse-tailed Bat. Chinese: 麦氏鼠尾蝠. Recorded only from S Eritrea, NE Somalia and NW Kenya. Found in semi-desert vegetation, including grasslands, shrublands, Acacia-Commiphora deciduous bushland and thickets (Aulagnier, 2013). In Kenya, recorded in a narrow band from areas around Lake Turkana to Lake Baringo.\n\nFamily EMBALLONURIDAE\n\nGenus Coleura Peters, 1867. Sheath-tailed Bats\n\n210.\n\nColeura afra (Peters, 1852). English: African Sheath-tailed Bat. Chinese: 非洲鞘尾蝠.
