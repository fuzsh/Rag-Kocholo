        "text": "The Sunday Morning Times\n\nSUNDAY, JULY. 15 1877.\n\nANCIENT LANDMARKS.\n\nGleanings from Old Syracuse\n\nDirectories.\n\nTHE ONLY COMPLETE FILE IN\n\nTHE CITY.\n\nThrough the kindness of Geo. J. Gardner, esq., we have been permitted the use, in his valuable and beautifully located library, of one of the very few complete files of Syracuse City Directories, from which we hoped to make some memoranda which might be of interest to the readers of the TIMES. Mr. G. entertains the belief that he possəsses the only complete file of these books in existence.\n\nA carefully compiled directory is of paramount importance in any city of the size of Syracuse, and the publication of such a work is no slight undertaking, both for the reason that the time allowed for the labor is necessarily very brief, and the care necessary to secure anything like tolerable accuracy is immense. Indeed, with the utmost watchfulness, and the constant supervision of an experienced publisher, such a thing an a correct directory has never yet been issued from the press.\n\nDirectory publishing in this city began with the year 1851-2. The first book, as well as several subsequent ones, was compiled by A. B. F. Ormsby, and its imprint reads, “Printed and Published by Seth Haight, Journal Office.” It contained 5,800 names—something of a difference between that and this year’s book, which Mr. Boyd informs us will contain about names. The publisher says in his preface that “our city has obtained such a size, and contains so large a population, that a directory is one of the necessities of business life.” And “in presenting to the citizens of Syracuse the first number of the Daily Journal City Register, we do so in full confidence that our arduous labors in preparing the work will be fully appreciated,” etc.\n\nThe book opens with a brief history of Syracuse, quoted mainly from Clark’s “Onondaga.” Following that is a list of the Societies, Schools, etc., of the city. Among these we find the “Young Men’s Lyceum,” with H. S. Fuller as President, and Charles Andrews, Secretary. “Society meets weekly in Brintnall’s Hall, on Fayette street, and is in a highly prosperous condition.\n\n“The Bradbury Seminary; located at 39 Montgomery street, and established by the late Miss Bradbury. Mrs. Porter Montgomery, Principal, and Miss Amelia Robinson, Assistant.”\n\nFayette street Female Seminary, located on the south-east corner of Fayette and Montgomery streets. Miss Laura J. and Sarah A. Huntington, Principals.”\n\n“Onondaga Seminary, for Young ladies, 33 East Fayette street.”\n\n“Cottage Seminary, located in the building known as the White Cottage, one door west of the Congregational church on E. Genesee street. Miss Emma C. Palmer, Principal.” In addition to these three, were five other select schools, institutes, etc., at that time, which would indicate one of two things—either our children needed more educating then than now-a-days, or else the public schools were not so efficient. It will not probably take the average Syracusan of to-day long to conclude that the latter was the case.\n\nA list of the district schools is given, and the names of the Board of Education, who were, J. McCarthy and W. H. Hoyt, 1st ward; J. Wilkinson and I. A. Thurber, 2d ward; H. Putnam and C. F. Williston, 3d ward; C. A. Wheaton and P. C. Samson, 4th ward. There were 29 teachers emplyed, seven of whom, as male principals, received $880, or about $45 per month; the other 22 were paid $403, an average of about $18 per month; which shows that school-teachers in those days managed to live on a great deal less money than they can now.\n\nThe “New York, Albany and Buffalo Telegraph Company, (Morse’s Line) was then in operation here, with John D. Stone as Syracuse operator. John Wilkinson was one of the Directors, as was also S. F. B. Morse. Office No. 12 Malcolm block. In opposition to this was the “New York State Telegraph, (O’Reilly’s Line),” with office over S. P. Pierce’s China Hall, 10 S. South street; also the N. Y. State Printing Telegraph Company,(House’s Line,) in the Malcolm Block. Among the directors of these companies we find names of many prominent citizens, showing the fever heat to which telegraph stock once arose.\n\nAustin Myers and F. Wellington then run a daily line of packet boats to Schenectady, and two to Buffalo. Fare from Schenectady to Buffalo, including board $5,00. Cheap enough.\n\nIn addition to all this, the first directory contained lists of banks, halls, newspapers, streets, city, county, and State officers, railroads, stages, rates of postage, value of money, table of coins, etc. Altogether, it was a very complete work, better, indeed, in most respects than some which followed it in other years. But there was one feature introduced into its pages, of very doultful propriety, to say the least, which gave the book a very extended reputation as “the semicolon directory.” This was the insertion after the name of every person keeping a house of prostitution, or an as-\n\nsignation house of any description, of a semicolon, instead of the customary period or comma. The publisher may have intended that this abnormal feature should remain a secret, except with a select few, but he should have reflected upon the utter impossibility of such a result. It was not long before “the semicolon directory” was upon every one’s tongue, and there was a hubbub raised around the ears of the publisher, such as is seldom heard. There they stand to-day, in the few remaining copies of the work, like signals on a dangerous coast, and there are among them, names which, if we should print them here, would be apt to make fully as much of a buzz as did the issue of “the semicolon directory.”\n\nAnother peculiarity of the book deserving of mention, occurs in the directory proper. On the 195th page we find a heading, “list of Colored Persons,” following which are the names of about seventy negroes; among them we find “Rev. J. W. Loguen.” The extent to which the prejudice which placed those names on separate pages of the book, has been wiped away in twenty-five years, is a good thing to mentally chew upon.\n\nThree person absolutely refused to give their names for the directory.\n\nThe book closes with 66 full pages of advertising, which we believe is more than could be got for a similar purpose to-day. Prominent among the advertisements we find the following:—\n\nREGULATOR!!\n\nNo. 6 Franklin Buildings.\n\nJAMES S. DAVIS & E. A. WILLIAMS, alias “SETH.”\n\nDealers in all kinds of Dry Goods; and, as Seth says,\n\nThey are ever cheerful, ever kind,\n\nLight-hearted, frank and gay;\n\nTheir shawls and satins, soft and bright,\n\nAre selling CHEAP TO-DAY!!!\n\nPerhaps that “alias Seth” will not thank us for bringing to light his youthful poetical effucion; but there it is at any rate.\n\nEvans & Taylor’s advertisement is unique:\n\n“For sale by Evans & Taylor, at Western Market, No. 35 West Water St., Syracuse.\n\nPROVIDENCE,\n\nconsisting of Bread, Butter, Cheese, Hams, Eggs, and Fresh and Salt Meats of all kinds.\n\nAGITATIONS.\n\nCider, Vinegar, Pickles, etc.\n\nGRIEVANCES,\n\nPepper Sauce, Mustard, Black Pepper, etc.\n\nPUNISHMENT,\n\nWine, Brandy, Gin, Beer, and Spirits, of all kinds.\n\nSUPERFLUITIES,\n\nSnuff, Tobacco, and Segars.\n\nN. B.—Any of the above articles exchanged for\n\nNECESSARIES,\n\nsuch as Eagles, Dollars, Dimes, Cents, Mills, or bank bills. Credit given for\n\nPAYMENT\n\n30, 60 or 90 days, or as long as a man can hold his breath,” etc.\n\nThe “oldest established drug store” in the city was then kept by Johnson L. Hall successor to M. W. Hanchett, at 17 South Salina street.\n\nA. Root advertised among other goods the Jenny Lind, or Seamless Gaiter, at 21 South Salina street.\n\nAnother man says “Clear the track, I am bound for Higgins’ Premium Daguerrean Gallery, 6 Franklin Buildings.” Signed Benjamin L. Higgins, which name our readers may recognize.\n\nD. P. Phelps sets forth the desirability of investing in the United States Life Insurance Company, and others.\n\nC. A. Foeke & Co. managed the “Syracuse Bookbindery,” at No. 3 Granger block.\n\nT. S. Truair & Co. run a job printing office at No. 5 E. Genesee street, 3d and 4th stories.\n\nJohn A. Clarke was city undertaker, and many others we have not space to mention.\n\nNo directory was published for 1852-3, but the one for the year following, was also compiled by Ormsby; it was a smaller book, less pages, and set in smaller type, and its imprint says it was printed by himself, and published by Hall, Mills and Co. In the preface the compiler says, “The non-appearance of a directory for 1852 resulted in great inconvenience to our citizens. We are happy to inform them that this will be avoided in the future.” It is perhaps needless to mention that there were no semicolons among the names.\n\nIt seems there was a little jealousy and rivalry between the compiler and other printing establishments, which finds vent in the following paragraph:\n\n“When it was first advertised that this work was under contemplation, a public journal announced that a rival edition was to be issued at that office. * * Some few were induced, by their confidence in that announcement, to withhold their patronage from the enterprise. We will not impugn any ones’ motives, but we are convinced there was never any intention to engage in any rival publication.”\n\nThe directory that year contained many engravings of buildings, public and private, which it says were executed by Mr. William Riches, of this city. Among them are the “Residence of Geo. Barnes, Foot street Hill.” Onondaga County Bank, Mechanics Bank, Crouse Bank, Syrause Savings Institution, etc.; cuts of nearly every chuch in the city at that time; the Dillaye Buildings—(now McCarthy’s stores), Renwick Castle, etc. Many of those old engravings would be very valuable at this day. Very little advertising was printed that year, which shows a counter-influence at work somewhere; this was the last work of the kind published by Mr. Ormsby.\n\nThe following year one W. H. Rainey compiled and published, and T. S. Truair printed about the worst looking book imaginable. Large pages, fine print, cheap binding, etc., characterized it. About two thousand new names were added to the work, and the publishers say that, “after making due allowances, this demonstrates an increase of population not inferior to that of any city of America.”\n\n“Salt, our great staple, has been manufactured in much larger quantities than ever before, above 5,000,000 bushels having been sent to market.”\n\n“For the merits of this work we neither invite nor repel criticisms. We expect to please our patrons, and to be found fault with by others,” etc., etc.\n\nBeyond this, there is nothing peculiarly interesting about the book in question.\n\nThe book of 1855-6 is only exceeded in ugliness by its predecessor, perhaps for the reason that the publisher this year had an assistant in Mr. J. R. Daley. It was “printed by J. G. K. Truair, Daily Journal Office,” which establishment has, with one or two exceptions, printed the standard directories every year since, and with constantly increasing beauty and acceptability to purchasers of these books.\n\nThe book of 1855-6 is a small octavo affair, containing less than 200 pages, very little advertising, and but little information outside the list of names. There is no preface, which indicates that its publishers could find little to say in their own behalf.\n\nThe following year—1857-8—was the first year of Mr. William Boyd’s directory work in this city. He was a brother to him who has acquired for himself the sobriquet of “The Directory King,” Mr. Andrew Boyd, who has probably published more different directories, by far, than any other living man; and it is but just to say that all his works bear the impress of intelligent, careful work. Mr. Andrew Boyd has, at some period of his labors, in this line, had as many as twenty-five different annual publications on his hands at once, and there is not a detail of the business of which he is not a thorough master. His brother William, began directory-making in New York as early as 1845. It seems to be a sort of epidemic in the Boyd family.\n\nAlthough William Boyd had some opposition the first year of his work in this city, in an indifferent book gotten out by H. P. Winsor, his book was a great advance on all that had been previously issued. It was a large octavo work, printed in small pica type, bound in muslin, adorned a with steel plate engraving af the city, and abounding with information. Advertisements were inserted on colored paper, and dispersed all through the work, and the whole book is carefully classified. Such has been the general character of the books published ever since.\n\nNo directory was published in 1858-9; but in 1859-60 Wm. Boyd published another excellent book, which was his last in this place. Then Syracuse was without a directory for three years. The reason of this was chiefly the apparent impossibility of making the enterprise of publication a financial success. At the end of this period, Messrs. Truair, Smith & Miles, then publishing the Journal, took the matter in hand, and published reliable and commendable directories until 1867-8, with the exception of one year—1864-5.\n\nIn 1867-8 Andrew Boyd appeared on the scene, and from that date until the present time, we have been favored with first-class productions from his hands.\n\nThe Sunday Morning Times\n\nSUNDAY, JULY. 15 1877.\n\nANCIENT LANDMARKS.\n\nGleanings from Old Syracuse\n\nDirectories.\n\nTHE ONLY COMPLETE FILE IN\n\nTHE CITY.\n\nThrough the kindness of Geo.

Truair, Smith & Miles, then publishing the Journal, took the matter in hand, and published reliable and commendable directories until 1867-8, with the exception of one year—1864-5.\n\nIn 1867-8 Andrew Boyd appeared on the scene, and from that date until the present time, we have been favored with first-class productions from his hands.\n\nTHE SYRACUSE STANDARD: MONDAY MORNING, JULY 25, 1887\n\nTHE NAMES IN THE DIRECTORY.\n\nLooking Them Over for the Curious Things\n\nThey Suggest.\n\nThere is a familiar legend to this effect:\n\nAdam was the first man,\n\nEve she was another,\n\nCain he was a wicked man,\n\n‘Cause he killed his brother.\n\nHowever that may be the first man mentioned in Boyd’s directory of Syracuse for 1887-’88, is Aaron. Moses is not mentioned until long afterwards, and although we read of Bulls there is no reference anywhere to bullrushes. Aaron, by the way, is standing directly in front of an Abbey so that he may not stay out in the wet unless he prefers it. Abel is given an early notice and so is Caine, but there is not a word about Adam or Eve. Possibly the various Eversons and Adamses referred to are relations of theirs. Abraham, Solomon and Isaacs are all down in the Syracuse edition, and there is a line about Balzhauser and of numerous interpreting, Daniels, Job is slighted, but there are Boyles until you can’t rest.\n\nThe population of the city is given as 81,339. Of these we are substantialy informed that some are Cumming and not one Going. Singularly but one is Parshall and only one Fair. Some are Rich, others are Failing, seven are Fayles, a few are Bustin, a good number are Owen and yet there is only one Poorman in the book. Various Prices are named. As to nationality no Irish have yet applied, yet four Irelands are spoken of. There is one England and six who are English. There are forty-five Scotts, perhaps a hundred Welch and twenty-four French. An even hundred Syracuse Kings, without queens, princes, princesses or kingdoms, yet most of them have subjects. In health some are Ayling, others Strong, and more are Wells. In disposition a few are Good; there is one really Goodman, some are Goodfellows, Goodsells, Goodriders, Goodwin, Goodspeed, Goodrich, and so on to the end of the chapter. A number Bragg, but only one has been given a brand, one wears bangs and others take aesthetic(???) Comfort. A few say they are Nice.\n\nThe occupations are diversified. Farmers are numerous and so are Bakers, Porters, Coopers, Botlers, Stuarts, Butlers Brohops(???), Parsons and Papers(???). One is a Hunter. Naturally enough some citizens are Salters. We have failed to find a candlestick maker in the whole batch. In the matter of beverages Waters are quite common. In fine we have a good supply of Pooles, Ponds and Brooks and Lakes. Mr. Boyd was just out of Rivers but he expects some next week. Would Marshes do instead? Those are in stock. As to beverages, one takes Beer, seven more call for Beers, others demand Porter or Weiss. No one wants Bass. One woman is known to have got Tyte. He don’t live here. There seems to be no great demand for provisions yet several lots of Bacon are in use, and Rice is not scarce. Then we have ten Pease and two Beans. Thirty-four Pecks come in handy right here. Very little traveling is done, as four Baggs supply the town.\n\nThere are Partridges, Pigeon and Pike. Fish are plenty. Finns are around, too. One Rivet is fast, but the Screws are loose. While a number readily keep up with the Paice, others are caused Paine and two go their Bourne whence they came. Three have the Gripes, two are full of Guile. Three are out on Bail. Two Banes are named without an antidote. There is a ring in town. Four Cards are all that go with four Packs, ten Bowers, one Bower and one Trumb. Query: Has not there been a misdeal? Three have received Calls but none are Chosen. In colors white predominates, yet there is a brilliant display of Brown, Gray, Balloon, Sage, Green and Black. The town is well fixed in Gunns, Cannons, Schoot and Hunters. Strikers are thick, but only one has Struck. We have some Fields, some Stuble and one Stumpe. Of Days and Knights there is no lack.\n\nSyracuse is not without Gamon or its Boulee. Bitter is taken along with sweet. More than one family is said to be Gross. There are only five Barnes to corespond with thirteen houses and twenty Holmes. We are cut off with two Schillings, several Nickels and six Thousand. Then there are Byers, Hoods, Buttons, Plants, Burrs, Thorns, Berrys, Birds, Hooks, Balls, Storms, Storrs, with Hair Hands. For fuel Cole, Coke and Wood are sued. Webbs are numberous and so are Cobbs, but no Spider is to be found. Lambs, Lambkins, Hurds, Schattles and Griffins furnish only four Hydes. Seven get on Benders. Then there are Strauss to show which way the wind blows.\n\nMr. Boyd has never issued a directory which seemed more complete than that which he is now placing in the hands of his subscribers. It is a splendid advertisement of the prosperity of the city as well as a comprehensive guide to its inhabitants and record of its commercial enterprises. Mr. Boyd predicts that Syracuse will pass its 100,000 mark in six or seven years. That is the kind of a true blue Syracusan he is.\n\nSyracuse DAILY Standard\n\nSYRACUSE, N. Y., WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 27, 1887.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF THE TOWN\n\nPopular Belief That Syracuse Will\n\nSoon Pass the 100,000 Mark.\n\nReasons Why the City is Bound to Grow\n\nand Become Great—Observations of\n\nOld Residents—Expert Opin-\n\nions on the Question.\n\nIn the new directory Andrew Boyd says the city of Syracuse in six or seven years will count up 100,000 inhabitants or more. Thirty years ago the population of this city was only 26,000. In the next twenty years this number was doubled, and in the past decade 26,000 more have been added to the population. More than three times as many people live here as the city in 1887 contained. Then there were 137 streets, 10 newspapers, 26 places of worship, and 8 public schools. Now there are 433 streets, 61 churches, 29 newspapers and 28 public schools. The First ward has increased less than any other section of the city in the past ten years. It about got its growth in 1877, when the population was 5,215. Now the number is 5,817. The Second ward in these ten years has grown from 8,965 to 9,725. The Third ward has increased from 4,032 to 6,698. The Fourth ward had 9,219 then has 12,816 now. Ten years ago the Fifth ward held 8,323, and now there are 12,291. In 1877 the population of the Sixth ward was 4,534, and now it is 5,853. Then the Seventh ward contained 8,979, and now there are 10,508. The Eighth ward has swollen in the same time from 5,132 to 7,792. The Ninth and Tenth wards contain territory annexed last year. The population of the Ninth ward is 5,046, and the Tenth 2,632. The Eleventh ward, formerly Danforth, has a population of 2,161.\n\nNot every prophet is honored in his own country. Mr. Boyd therefore runs the risk of being laughed at for predicting a population of more than 100,000 in six or seven years from the present time. However, it happens that Mr. Boyd’s prophecy is credited at home almost universally. Yesterday the business men of the city were united in expressing a belief that Syracuse will reach the mark indicated within the six or eight years. Everyone thought it was a reasonable figure. Sheriff T. R. O’Neill said Mr. Boyd had been modest in his estimates and that in less time than that named we might well expect to pass the hundred thousand line. This he felt free to say, although his own business was not showing up very big just at present. Surrogate Cook had no doubt whatever of the fulfillment of the prediction, and he is well qualified to express an opinion on affairs of this sort. The case was not adjourned but Judgment rendered at once. Other county officials, who ought to be impartial, as their duties include the whole of Onondaga, were equally emphatic. A well-known stock broker who has been particularly successful dealing in “futures,” said he was in the syndicate and took all the stock he could get that the population of Syracuse would be 100,000 within six years.\n\nAfter talking about the prospect of the growing crop of tobacco and the effect of the recent rain with a reporter, John P. Hier added his opinion that Mr. Boyd was right. The present territory is sufficient to contain 100,000 people easily, he thought, and it would not be necessary to annex East Syracuse, Liverpool or any outlying district to reach the mark. The present rate of growth alone would do it.\n\nJohn McCarthy, of the firm of D. McCarthy & Co., one of the oldest residents of Syracuse, was born in 1823 in a house standing a few feet from the one where he now lives, No. 383 Park street. Probably no one has had a better opportunity than Mr. McCarthy of watching the growth of the city and estimating its chances for future development. Mr. McCarthy said yesterday afternoon:\n\n“No one who has seen what Syracuse was fifty years ago can doubt that it is destined to become a city much larger than it is at present. In the year 1900 we will have a population of 120,000, estimating a moderate increase of 2,000 each year. The growth is very steady although not so rapid as that of Rochester and some other cities. When I was born, in 1822, Salina was a village of 2,500 inhabitants, while Syracuse was a hamlet of a half dozen houses. Between Salina and this hamlet there were only two houses, one known as the Sullivan house, or the haunted house. It stood a little north of where the Church of Assumption stands and was occupied by the late ex-Mayor Demong. In the old times the house was in a solitary place, surrounded by underbrush and came to have the name of being haunted, for which reason it was unoccupied for many years. The other building was a tavern known as the ‘Half Way’ house. The first sign of increase in the size of the place was in 1826 at the opening of the canal. From that time the growth has been steady. Formerly a cut a mile and a half long ran from near my present house to the Erie canal, so that the people of Salina might send goods by the canal. In 1831, the county decided to build a new court house, and there was intense rivalry between Syracuse and Salina as to which should have the honor of the location. The old court house had been at Onondaga Hill, but Syracuse and Salina had now outstripped that place and were of about equal size. The rivalry between these villages was so great that they almost came to blows respecting the court house. Finally as a compromise it was placed in the wilderness just half-way between the two. But Syracuse grew much more rapidly than Salina, and at last annexed the rival, and when the present court house was to be erected, there was no dispute.\n\n“When the salt interests gave out, there was an indication for a time of a fall in our growth. Salt boilers and barrel makers moved away. In 18??, 100 men in the First ward were well-to-do, having from one to five salt blocks. Now three blocks are worthless, nineteen out of twenty of them are shut down, while in the rest the owners are simply making their ordinary day’s wages. Syracuse would have retrograded terribly had not manufacturing come to the rescue. Manufactories began to spring all over, and more men were employed than by the salt interests and better wages were made than salt boilers had received. The city became a great railroad center and manufacturers found it a convenient place from which to ship goods to all parts. More commercial travelers have their headquarters in Syracuse than in any other city of the state outside of the metropolis. Occupying a central position the city became a favorite one for conventions. Hence hotels and restaurants became numerous and gave employment to many. The placing of the university here has helped. In war times many farmers sold their farms at high prices and removed to Syracuse on account of its educational advantages. Some of the villages in the southern part of the county were almost depleted.\n\n“Syracuse will become before long the fourth city in size in the state. It will never become such a city as New York and Brooklyn, and will also continue to rank lower than Buffalo and Rochester. Buffalo has the advantage of its position on the lake. Rochester has a great start over Syracuse in population, wealth and manufacturing interests, and has fully as much enterprise as we have. In the past five years, and in the present year as well, Rochester has done more building than Syracuse. It has all the advantages we have, except that Syracuse is more central. Syracuse will out rank Albany and Troy, the former being dead and the latter having a mushroom growth, with no natural advantages.”\n\nGeorge A. Porter, president of the Porter Manufacturing company, said:\n\n“There is no reason why we should not have a population of 100,000 in three or four years, or five at the most. Manufacturing is what the city must depend on now and it is a fact that Syracuse would be much nearer the figure indicated than at present if the city would encourage manufacturers by furnishing good water. Many manufacturers have built their works in other places because of the poor water. There will be a limit to the city’s growth unless there is a change in this regard.”\n\nNicholas Peters, one of the most extensive merchants of the Second ward, said:\n\n“The Second ward is growing wonderfully. Germans are constantly moving in and Germans always have large families. The ward will do more than its share toward bringing up the population to 100,000.\n\nJoseph A. Hoffmann, editor of the Central Demokrat, and agent for a number of steamship lines, said:\n\n“The past spring more people have come to this city from Germany than at any other time. Only one has obtained return passage through me, intending to forsake Syracuse. In seven or eight years we will have the population predicted.”\n\nMany other merchants and citizens declared that with the improvement in business and building which has been shown the last year Syracuse would make the most rapid strides in all its history within the next five years. The locality of the town, the enterprise of its citizens, its industrial institutions, educational advantages and business facilities were more and more attracting trade, and people from other cities and towns to settle here. Architects say that the amount of building being done in the suburbs this summer is unusually large and they expect next year will be fully equal to or better than this season. A hardware firm told a reporter that his house had sold more goods this season this year than in any other in the last decade. The amount of building being done this year, not only in Syracuse, but almost everywhere, has caused an advance in the price of oil and white lead used in mixing paints. More baby carriages are being sold in town this season than ever before."
