        "text": "Key Facts\n\nCategorized as a Jupiter Trojan\n\nComparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island (68.16 km diameter)\n\nNot a Near Earth Object\n\nNot a Potentially Hazardous Object\n\nSee orbit simulation\n\nOverview\n\nThersites is a large asteroid that shares Jupiter's orbit around the sun. NASA JPL has not classified Thersites as potentially hazardous because its orbit does not bring it close to Earth.\n\nThersites orbits the sun every 4,470 days (12.24 years), coming as close as 4.73 AU and reaching as far as 5.89 AU from the sun. Thersites is about 68.2 kilometers in diameter, making it larger than 99% of asteroids, comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island.\n\nThe rotation of Thersites has been observed. It completes a rotation on its axis every 10.49 hours.\n\nNo Close Approaches\n\nThersites's orbit is 3.73 AU from Earth's orbit at its closest point. This means that there is an extremely wide berth between this asteroid and Earth at all times.\n\nOrbital simulations conducted by NASA JPL's CNEOS do not show any close approaches to Earth.\n\nImages and Observations\n\nThersites's orbit is determined by observations dating back to March 28, 1954. It was last officially observed on April 16, 2023. The IAU Minor Planet Center records 3,823 observations used to determine its orbit.\n\nAccessibility and Exploration\n\nThis asteroid is not considered a viable target for human exploration by the NHATS study.\n\nSimilar Objects\n\nThese objects have orbits that share similar characteristics to the orbit of Thersites:\n\n3801 Thrasymedes (1985 VS)\n\n4946 Askalaphus (1988 BW1)\n\n8317 Eurysaces (4523 P-L)\n\nReferences"
