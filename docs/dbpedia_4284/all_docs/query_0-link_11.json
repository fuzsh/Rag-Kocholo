        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nCalchas asks the Greek leaders to demand his daughter Cressida from the Trojans in exchange for Antenor, whom the Greeks have captured. The leaders agree and dispatch Diomedes to conduct the exchange of prisoners. The Greek leaders shun Achilles. After Ulysses and Achilles discuss the briefness of fame, and Ulysses attacks Achilles for loving the Trojan Polyxena, Achilles watches as Thersites and Patroclus perform an impromptu playlet mocking Ajax.\n\n⟨Flourish.⟩ Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor,\n\nAgamemnon, Calchas, ⟨Menelaus,⟩ ⌜and Ajax.⌝\n\nCALCHAS\n\n1860 Now, princes, for the service I have done ⟨you,⟩\n\n1861 Th’ advantage of the time prompts me aloud\n\n1862 To call for recompense. Appear it to ⟨your⟩ mind\n\np. 135\n\n1863 That, through the sight I bear in things to ⌜come,⌝\n\n1864 5 I have abandoned Troy, left my ⌜possessions,⌝\n\n1865 Incurred a traitor’s name, exposed myself,\n\n1866 From certain and possessed conveniences,\n\n1867 To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all\n\n1868 That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition\n\n1869 10 Made tame and most familiar to my nature,\n\n1870 And here, to do you service, am become\n\n1871 As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.\n\n1872 I do beseech you, as in way of taste,\n\n1873 To give me now a little benefit\n\n1874 15 Out of those many regist’red in promise,\n\n1875 Which you say live to come in my behalf.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1876 What wouldst thou of us, Trojan, make demand?\n\nCALCHAS\n\n1877 You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor\n\n1878 Yesterday took. Troy holds him very dear.\n\n1879 20 Oft have you—often have you thanks therefor—\n\n1880 Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,\n\n1881 Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,\n\n1882 I know, is such a wrest in their affairs\n\n1883 That their negotiations all must slack,\n\n1884 25 Wanting his manage; and they will almost\n\n1885 Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,\n\n1886 In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,\n\n1887 And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence\n\n1888 Shall quite strike off all service I have done\n\n1889 30 In most accepted pain.\n\nAGAMEMNON 1890 Let Diomedes bear him,\n\n1891 And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have\n\n1892 What he requests of us. Good Diomed,\n\n1893 Furnish you fairly for this interchange.\n\n1894 35 Withal, bring word if Hector will tomorrow\n\n1895 Be answered in his challenge. Ajax is ready.\n\np. 137\n\nDIOMEDES\n\n1896 This shall I undertake, and ’tis a burden\n\n1897 Which I am proud to bear.He exits ⌜with Calchas.⌝\n\nAchilles and Patroclus stand in their tent.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1898 Achilles stands i’ th’ entrance of his tent.\n\n1899 40 Please it our General pass strangely by him\n\n1900 As if he were forgot, and, princes all,\n\n1901 Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.\n\n1902 I will come last. ’Tis like he’ll question me\n\n1903 Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on\n\n1904 45 him.\n\n1905 If so, I have derision medicinable\n\n1906 To use between your strangeness and his pride,\n\n1907 Which his own will shall have desire to drink.\n\n1908 It may do good; pride hath no other glass\n\n1909 50 To show itself but pride, for supple knees\n\n1910 Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\n1911 We’ll execute your purpose and put on\n\n1912 A form of strangeness as we pass along;\n\n1913 So do each lord, and either greet him not\n\n1914 55 Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\n\n1915 Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.\n\n⌜They pass before Achilles and Patroclus. Ulysses\n\nremains in place, reading.⌝\n\nACHILLES\n\n1916 What, comes the General to speak with me?\n\n1917 You know my mind: I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.\n\nAGAMEMNON, ⌜to Nestor⌝\n\n1918 What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?\n\nNESTOR, ⌜to Achilles⌝\n\n1919 60 Would you, my lord, aught with the General?\n\nACHILLES 1920 No.\n\np. 139\n\nNESTOR 1921 Nothing, my lord.\n\nAGAMEMNON 1922 The better.⌜Agamemnon and Nestor exit.⌝\n\nACHILLES, ⌜to Menelaus⌝ 1923 Good day, good day.\n\nMENELAUS 1924 65How do you? How do you?⌜He exits.⌝\n\nACHILLES 1925 What, does the cuckold scorn me?\n\nAJAX 1926 How now, Patroclus?\n\nACHILLES 1927 Good morrow, Ajax.\n\nAJAX 1928 Ha?\n\nACHILLES 1929 70Good morrow.\n\nAJAX 1930 Ay, and good next day too.⌜He exits.⌝\n\nACHILLES\n\n1931 What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?\n\nPATROCLUS\n\n1932 They pass by strangely. They were used to bend,\n\n1933 To send their smiles before them to Achilles,\n\n1934 75 To come as humbly as they ⌜use⌝ to creep\n\n1935 To holy altars.\n\nACHILLES 1936 What, am I poor of late?\n\n1937 ’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with Fortune,\n\n1938 Must fall out with men too. What the declined is\n\n1939 80 He shall as soon read in the eyes of others\n\n1940 As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,\n\n1941 Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,\n\n1942 And not a man, for being simply man,\n\n1943 Hath any honor, but honor for those honors\n\n1944 85 That are without him—as place, riches, and favor,\n\n1945 Prizes of accident as oft as merit,\n\n1946 Which, when they fall, as being slippery slanders,\n\n1947 The love that leaned on them, as slippery too,\n\n1948 Doth one pluck down another and together\n\n1949 90 Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me.\n\n1950 Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy,\n\n1951 At ample point, all that I did possess,\n\n1952 Save these men’s looks, who do, methinks, find out\n\n1953 Something not worth in me such rich beholding\n\np. 141\n\n1954 95 As they have often given. Here is Ulysses.\n\n1955 I’ll interrupt his reading.—How now, Ulysses?\n\nULYSSES 1956 Now, great Thetis’ son—\n\nACHILLES 1957 What are you reading?\n\nULYSSES 1958 A strange fellow here\n\n1959 100 Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,\n\n1960 How much in having, or without or in,\n\n1961 Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,\n\n1962 Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\n\n1963 As when his virtues, ⟨shining⟩ upon others,\n\n1964 105 Heat them, and they retort that heat again\n\n1965 To the first ⟨giver.⟩\n\nACHILLES 1966 This is not strange, Ulysses.\n\n1967 The beauty that is borne here in the face\n\n1968 The bearer knows not, but commends itself\n\n1969 110[To others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself,\n\n1970 That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,]\n\n1971 Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed\n\n1972 Salutes each other with each other’s form.\n\n1973 For speculation turns not to itself\n\n1974 115 Till it hath traveled and is ⌜mirrored⌝ there\n\n1975 Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.\n\nULYSSES\n\n1976 I do not strain at the position—\n\n1977 It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,\n\n1978 Who in his circumstance expressly proves\n\n1979 120 That no man is the lord of anything—\n\n1980 Though in and of him there be much consisting—\n\n1981 Till he communicate his parts to others;\n\n1982 Nor doth he of himself know them for aught\n\n1983 Till he behold them formed in the applause\n\n1984 125 Where they’re extended; who, like an arch, reverb’rate\n\n1985 The voice again or, like a gate of steel\n\n1986 Fronting the sun, receives and renders back\n\n1987 His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this\n\n1988 And apprehended here immediately\n\np. 143\n\n1989 130 Th’ unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there!\n\n1990 A very horse, that has he knows not what!\n\n1991 Nature, what things there are\n\n1992 Most ⟨abject⟩ in regard, and dear in use,\n\n1993 What things again most dear in the esteem\n\n1994 135 And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—\n\n1995 An act that very chance doth throw upon him—\n\n1996 Ajax renowned. O, heavens, what some men do\n\n1997 While some men leave to do!\n\n1998 How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,\n\n1999 140 Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\n\n2000 How one man eats into another’s pride,\n\n2001 While pride is fasting in his wantonness!\n\n2002 To see these Grecian lords—why, even already\n\n2003 They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder\n\n2004 145 As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast\n\n2005 And great Troy shrieking.\n\nACHILLES\n\n2006 I do believe it, for they passed by me\n\n2007 As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\n\n2008 Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?\n\nULYSSES\n\n2009 150 Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back\n\n2010 Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\n\n2011 A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.\n\n2012 Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devoured\n\n2013 As fast as they are made, forgot as soon\n\n2014 155 As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,\n\n2015 Keeps honor bright. To have done is to hang\n\n2016 Quite out of fashion like a rusty ⌜mail⌝\n\n2017 In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,\n\n2018 For honor travels in a strait so narrow\n\n2019 160 Where one but goes abreast. Keep, then, the path,\n\n2020 For Emulation hath a thousand sons\n\n2021 That one by one pursue. If you give way\n\n2022 Or turn aside from the direct forthright,\n\np. 145\n\n2023 Like to an entered tide they all rush by\n\n2024 165 And leave you ⟨hindmost;\n\n2025 Or, like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,\n\n2026 Lie there for pavement to the abject ⌜rear,⌝\n\n2027 O’errun and trampled on.⟩ Then what they do in\n\n2028 present,\n\n2029 170 Though less than yours in ⟨past,⟩ must o’ertop yours;\n\n2030 For Time is like a fashionable host\n\n2031 That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand\n\n2032 And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,\n\n2033 Grasps in the comer. Welcome ever smiles,\n\n2034 175 And Farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek\n\n2035 Remuneration for the thing it was,\n\n2036 For beauty, wit,\n\n2037 High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,\n\n2038 Love, friendship, charity are subjects all\n\n2039 180 To envious and calumniating Time.\n\n2040 One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\n\n2041 That all, with one consent, praise newborn gauds,\n\n2042 Though they are made and molded of things past,\n\n2043 And ⌜give⌝ to dust that is a little gilt\n\n2044 185 More laud than gilt o’erdusted.\n\n2045 The present eye praises the present object.\n\n2046 Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,\n\n2047 That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,\n\n2048 Since things in motion sooner catch the eye\n\n2049 190⟨Than⟩ what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,\n\n2050 And still it might, and yet it may again,\n\n2051 If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\n\n2052 And case thy reputation in thy tent,\n\n2053 Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late\n\n2054 195 Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves\n\n2055 And drave great Mars to faction.\n\nACHILLES 2056 Of this my privacy,\n\n2057 I have strong reasons.\n\nULYSSES 2058 But ’gainst your privacy\n\np. 147\n\n2059 200 The reasons are more potent and heroical.\n\n2060 ’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love\n\n2061 With one of Priam’s daughters.\n\nACHILLES 2062 Ha? Known?\n\nULYSSES 2063 Is that a wonder?\n\n2064 205 The providence that’s in a watchful state\n\n2065 Knows almost every ⟨grain of Pluto’s gold,⟩\n\n2066 Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive ⌜deep,⌝\n\n2067 Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,\n\n2068 Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\n\n2069 210 There is a mystery—with whom relation\n\n2070 Durst never meddle—in the soul of state,\n\n2071 Which hath an operation more divine\n\n2072 Than breath or pen can give expressure to.\n\n2073 All the commerce that you have had with Troy\n\n2074 215 As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;\n\n2075 And better would it fit Achilles much\n\n2076 To throw down Hector than Polyxena.\n\n2077 But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home\n\n2078 When Fame shall in our islands sound her trump,\n\n2079 220 And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing\n\n2080 “Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,\n\n2081 But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”\n\n2082 Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak.\n\n2083 The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.\n\n⌜He exits.⌝\n\nPATROCLUS\n\n2084 225 To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you.\n\n2085 A woman impudent and mannish grown\n\n2086 Is not more loathed than an effeminate man\n\n2087 In time of action. I stand condemned for this.\n\n2088 They think my little stomach to the war,\n\n2089 230 And your great love to me, restrains you thus.\n\n2090 Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid\n\n2091 Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold\n\np. 149\n\n2092 And, like ⟨a⟩ dewdrop from the lion’s mane,\n\n2093 Be shook to air.\n\nACHILLES 2094 235 Shall Ajax fight with Hector?\n\nPATROCLUS\n\n2095 Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.\n\nACHILLES\n\n2096 I see my reputation is at stake;\n\n2097 My fame is shrewdly gored.\n\nPATROCLUS 2098 O, then, beware!\n\n2099 240 Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.\n\n2100 Omission to do what is necessary\n\n2101 Seals a commission to a blank of danger,\n\n2102 And danger, like an ague, subtly taints\n\n2103 Even then when they sit idly in the sun.\n\nACHILLES\n\n2104 245 Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.\n\n2105 I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him\n\n2106 T’ invite the Trojan lords after the combat\n\n2107 To see us here unarmed. I have a woman’s longing,\n\n2108 An appetite that I am sick withal,\n\n2109 250 To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,\n\n2110 To talk with him, and to behold his visage,\n\n2111 Even to my full of view.\n\nEnter Thersites.\n\n2112 A labor saved.\n\nTHERSITES 2113 A wonder!\n\nACHILLES 2114 255What?\n\nTHERSITES 2115 Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for\n\n2116 himself.\n\nACHILLES 2117 How so?\n\nTHERSITES 2118 He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector\n\n2119 260 and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling\n\n2120 that he raves in saying nothing.\n\nACHILLES 2121 How can that be?\n\np. 151\n\nTHERSITES 2122 Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock—\n\n2123 a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess\n\n2124 265 that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set\n\n2125 down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard,\n\n2126 as who should say “There were wit in this\n\n2127 head an ’twould out”—and so there is, but it lies\n\n2128 as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not\n\n2129 270 show without knocking. The man’s undone forever,\n\n2130 for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat,\n\n2131 he’ll break ’t himself in vainglory. He knows not\n\n2132 me. I said “Good morrow, Ajax,” and he replies\n\n2133 “Thanks, Agamemnon.” What think you of this\n\n2134 275 man that takes me for the General? He’s grown a\n\n2135 very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of\n\n2136 opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a\n\n2137 leather jerkin.\n\nACHILLES 2138 Thou must be my ambassador ⟨to him,⟩\n\n2139 280 Thersites.\n\nTHERSITES 2140 Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody. He professes\n\n2141 not answering; speaking is for beggars; he\n\n2142 wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence.\n\n2143 Let Patroclus make ⟨his⟩ demands to me. You\n\n2144 285 shall see the pageant of Ajax.\n\nACHILLES 2145 To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire\n\n2146 the valiant Ajax to invite the ⟨most⟩ valorous Hector\n\n2147 to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct\n\n2148 for his person of the magnanimous and\n\n2149 290 most illustrious, six-or-seven-times-honored captain\n\n2150 general of the ⟨Grecian⟩ army, Agamemnon,\n\n2151 ⟨et cetera.⟩ Do this.\n\nPATROCLUS, ⌜to Thersites, who is playing Ajax⌝ 2152 Jove\n\n2153 bless great Ajax.\n\nTHERSITES 2154 295Hum!\n\nPATROCLUS 2155 I come from the worthy Achilles—\n\nTHERSITES 2156 Ha?\n\np. 153\n\nPATROCLUS 2157 Who most humbly desires you to invite\n\n2158 Hector to his tent—\n\nTHERSITES 2159 300Hum!\n\nPATROCLUS 2160 And to procure safe-conduct from\n\n2161 Agamemnon.\n\nTHERSITES 2162 Agamemnon?\n\nPATROCLUS 2163 Ay, my lord.\n\nTHERSITES 2164 305Ha!\n\nPATROCLUS 2165 What say you to ’t?\n\nTHERSITES 2166 God b’ wi’ you, with all my heart.\n\nPATROCLUS 2167 Your answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES 2168 If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the\n\n2169 310 clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he\n\n2170 shall pay for me ere he has me.\n\nPATROCLUS 2171 Your answer, sir.\n\nTHERSITES 2172 Fare you well with all my heart.\n\n⌜He pretends to exit.⌝\n\nACHILLES 2173 Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?\n\nTHERSITES 2174 315No, but ⟨he’s⟩ out of tune thus. What music\n\n2175 will be in him when Hector has knocked out his\n\n2176 brains I know not. But I am sure none, unless the\n\n2177 fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.\n\nACHILLES 2178 Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him\n\n2179 320 straight.\n\nTHERSITES 2180 Let me bear another to his horse, for that’s\n\n2181 the more capable creature.\n\nACHILLES\n\n2182 My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirred,\n\n2183 And I myself see not the bottom of it.\n\n⌜Achilles and Patroclus exit.⌝\n\nTHERSITES 2184 325Would the fountain of your mind were clear\n\n2185 again, that I might water an ass at it. I had rather\n\n2186 be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.\n\n⌜He exits.⌝"
