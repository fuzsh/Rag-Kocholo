Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic.[1]\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Philoctetes measures 22.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.104.[6]\n\nAs of 2017, the body's rotation period and shape remain unknown.[1][7]\n\nSurvey designation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe survey designation P-L stands for Palomar–Leiden, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Leiden Observatory. The trio are credited with several thousand asteroid discoveries.[8]\n\nNaming\n\n[edit]\n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek mythological figure Philoctetes, famed archer and participant in the Trojan War, where he killed Paris, son of the Trojan King Priam.[3] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 June 1975 (M.P.C. 3826).\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
