1846.1[3.3]

3.3.0.11847Enter Ulysses, Diomed, Nestor, Agamemnon, [Ajax,] 1848Menelaus, and Calchas. Flourish.

Now, princes, for the service I have done you,

3.3.21850Th'advantage of the time prompts me aloud

3.3.31851To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind

3.3.41852That, through the sight I bear in things to love,

3.3.51853I have abandoned Troy, left my possession,

3.3.61854Incurred a traitor's name, exposed myself,

3.3.71855From certain and possessed conveniences,

3.3.81856To doubtful fortunes, sequest'ring from me all

3.3.91857That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,

3.3.101858Made tame and most familiar to my nature,

3.3.111859And here, to do you service, am become

3.3.121860As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.

3.3.131861I do beseech you, as in way of taste,

3.3.141862To give me now a little benefit

3.3.151863Out of those many registered in promise,

3.3.161864Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? 1866Make demand.

You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor,

3.3.191868Yesterday took. Troy holds him very dear.

3.3.201869Oft have you -- often have you thanks therefore --

3.3.211870Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,

3.3.221871Whom Troy hath still denied; but this Antenor,

3.3.231872I know, is such a wrest in their affairs

3.3.241873That their negotiations all must slack

3.3.251874Wanting his manage, and they will almost

3.3.261875Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,

3.3.271876In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,

3.3.281877And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence

3.3.291878Shall quite strike off all service I have done

3.3.301879In most accepted pain.

1880Agamemnon

In most accepted pain. Let Diomed bear him,

3.3.311881And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have

3.3.321882What he requests of us. Good Diomed,

3.3.331883Furnish you fairly for this interchange;

3.3.341884Withal bring word if Hector will tomorrow

3.3.351885Be answered in his challenge. Ajax is ready.

This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden

3.3.371887Which I am proud to bear.

3.3.37.1Exit [Diomed].

3.3.37.21888Enter Achilles and Patroclus in their tent.

Achilles stands i'th'entrance of his tent;

3.3.391890Please it our general to pass strangely by him,

3.3.401891As if he were forgot, and, princes all,

3.3.411892Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.

3.3.421893I will come last; 'tis like he'll question me

3.3.431894Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turned on him.

3.3.441895If so, I have derision medicinable

3.3.451896To use between your strangeness and his pride,

3.3.461897Which his own will shall have desire to drink.

3.3.471898It may do good. Pride hath no other glass

3.3.481899To show itself but pride; for supple knees

3.3.491900Feed arrogance, and are the proud man's fees.

We'll execute your purpose, and put on

3.3.511902A form of strangeness as we pass along.

3.3.521903So do each lord, and either greet him not,

3.3.531904Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more

3.3.541905Than if not looked on. I will lead the way.

3.3.54.1[They walk separately past Achilles' tent.]

What? Comes the general to speak with me?

3.3.561907You know my mind; I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

[To Nestor] What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?

[To Achilles] Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

No.

[To Agamemnon]Nothing, my lord.

The better.

[To Menelaus]Good day, good day.

How do you? How do you?

[To Patroclus]What, does the cuckold scorn me?

How now, Patroclus?

Good morrow, Ajax.

Ha?

Good morrow.

Ay, and good next day too.

3.3.69.1Exeunt. [Ulysses remains onstage pretending to read.]

What mean these fellows? Know they not 1922Achilles?

They pass by strangely. They were used to bend,

3.3.721924To send their smiles before them to Achilles,

3.3.731925To come as humbly as they used to creep

3.3.74To holy altars.

1926Achilles

To holy altars. What, am I poor of late?

3.3.751927'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,

3.3.761928Must fall out with men too. What the declined is

3.3.771929He shall as soon read in the eyes of others

3.3.781930As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,

3.3.791931Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,

3.3.801932And not a man, for being simply man,

3.3.811933Hath any honor, but honored for those honors

3.3.821934That are without him, as place, riches, and favor,

3.3.831935Prizes of accident as oft as merit,

3.3.841936Which, when they fall, as being slippery standers,

3.3.851937The love that leaned on them, as slippery too,

3.3.861938Doth one pluck down another and together

3.3.871939Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me;

3.3.881940Fortune and I are friends; I do enjoy

3.3.891941At ample point all that I did possess,

3.3.901942Save these men's looks, who do, me thinks, find out

3.3.911943Something not worth in me such rich beholding

3.3.921944As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;

3.3.931945I'll interrupt his reading. --

3.3.94How now, Ulysses?

1946Ulysses

How now, Ulysses? Now, great Thetis' son.

What are you reading?

1948Ulysses.

What are you reading? A strange fellow here

3.3.961949Writes me that man (how dearly ever parted,

3.3.971950How much in having, or without, or in)

3.3.981951Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,

3.3.991952Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection,

3.3.1001953As when his virtues shining upon others

3.3.1011954Heat them, and they retort that heat again

3.3.1021955To the first giver.

1956Achilles

To the first giver. This is not strange, Ulysses.

3.3.1031957The beauty that is borne here in the face

3.3.1041958The bearer knows not, but commends itself

3.3.1051958.1To others' eyes, nor doth the eye itself,

3.3.1061958.2That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,

3.3.1071959Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed,

3.3.1081960Salutes each other with each other's form.

3.3.1091961For speculation turns not to itself

3.3.1101962Till it hath traveled and is married there

3.3.1111963Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

I do not strain it at the position

3.3.1131965(It is familiar), but at the author's drift,

3.3.1141966Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves

3.3.1151967That no man is the lord of anything

3.3.1161968(Though in and of him there is much consisting)

3.3.1171969Till he communicate his parts to others,

3.3.1181970Nor doth he of himself know them for aught

3.3.1191971Till he behold them form√®d in th'applause

3.3.1201972Where they are extended, who, like an arch, reverberate

3.3.1211973The voice again, or, like a gate of steel,

3.3.1221974Fronting the sun, receives and renders back

3.3.1231975His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this,

3.3.1241976And apprehended here immediately

3.3.1251977The unknown Ajax.

3.3.1261978Heavens, what a man is there. A very horse,

3.3.1271979That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are

3.3.1281980Most abject in regard and dear in use;

3.3.1291981What things again, most dear in the esteem

3.3.1301982And poor in worth. Now shall we see tomorrow

3.3.1311983An act that very chance doth throw upon him.

3.3.1321984Ajax renowned? O heavens, what some men do,

3.3.1331985While some men leave to do;

3.3.1341986How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,

3.3.1351987Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes;

3.3.1361988How one man eats into another's pride,

3.3.1371989While pride is feasting in his wantonness

3.3.1381990To see these Grecian lords. Why, even already

3.3.1391991They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,

3.3.1401992As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast,

3.3.1411993And great Troy shrinking.

1994Achilles

And great Troy shrinking. I do believe it,

3.3.1421995For they passed by me as misers do by beggars,

3.3.1431996Neither gave to me good word nor look.

3.3.1441997What, are my deeds forgot?

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,

3.3.1461999Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,

3.3.1472000A great-sized monster of ingratitudes.

3.3.1482001Those scraps are good deeds past,

3.3.1492002Which are devoured as fast as they are made,

3.3.1502003Forgot as soon as done. Perseverance, dear my lord,

3.3.1512004Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang

3.3.1522005Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail

3.3.1532006In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way,

3.3.1542007For honor travels in a strait so narrow,

3.3.1552008Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,

3.3.1562009For emulation hath a thousand sons

3.3.1572010That one by one pursue; if you give way,

3.3.1582011Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,

3.3.1592012Like to an entered tide they all rush by

3.3.1602013And leave you hindmost,

3.3.1612014Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,

3.3.1622015Lie there for pavement to the abject -- near

3.3.1632016O'er-run and trampled on. Then what they do in present,

3.3.1642017Though less than yours in past, must o'er-top yours,

3.3.1652018For time is like a fashionable host

3.3.1662019That slightly shakes his parting guest by th'hand

3.3.1672020And, with his arms outstretched as he would fly,

3.3.1682021Grasps in the comer: the welcome ever smiles,

3.3.1692022And farewells goes out sighing. Oh, let not virtue seek

3.3.1702023Remuneration for the thing it was, for beauty, wit,

3.3.1712024High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,

3.3.1722025Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all

3.3.1732026To envious and calumniating time.

3.3.1742027One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,

3.3.1752028That all with one consent praise newborn gauds,

3.3.1762029Though they are made and molded of things past

3.3.1772030And go to dust that is a little gilt

3.3.1782031More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.

3.3.1792032The present eye praises the present object.

3.3.1802033Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,

3.3.1812034That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,

3.3.1822035Since things in motion sooner catch the eye

3.3.1832036Than what not stirs. The cry went out on thee,

3.3.1842037And still it might, and yet it may again,

3.3.1852038If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive

3.3.1862039And case thy reputation in thy tent,

3.3.1872040Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late

3.3.1882041Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves

3.3.1892042And drave great Mars to faction.

2043Achilles

And drave great Mars to faction. Of this my privacy,

3.3.1902044I have strong reasons.

2045Ulysses

I have strong reasons. But 'gainst your privacy

3.3.1912046The reasons are more potent and heroical.

3.3.1922047'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love

3.3.1932048With one of Priam's daughters.

2049Achilles

With one of Priam's daughters. Ha? Known?

2050Ulysses

With one of Priam's daughters. Ha? Known? Is that a wonder?

3.3.1942051The providence that's in a watchful state

3.3.1952052Knows almost every grain of Pluto's gold,

3.3.1962053Finds bottom in th'uncomprehensive deeps,

3.3.1972054Keeps place with thought, and, almost like the gods,

3.3.1982055Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.

3.3.1992056There is a mystery (with whom relation

3.3.2002057Durst never meddle) in the soul of state

3.3.2012058Which hath an operation more divine

3.3.2022059Than breath or pen can give expressure to.

3.3.2032060All the commerce that you have had with Troy

3.3.2042061As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;

3.3.2052062And better would it fit Achilles much

3.3.2062063To throw down Hector than Polixena.

3.3.2072064But it must grieve young Pyrrhus, now at home,

3.3.2082065When fame shall in her island sound her trump

3.3.2092066And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,

3.3.2102067"Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,

3.3.2112068But our great Ajax bravely beat down him."

3.3.2122069Farewell, my lord. I as your lover speak:

3.3.2132070"The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break."

To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you;

3.3.2152072A woman impudent and mannish grown

3.3.2162073Is not more loathed than an effeminate man

3.3.2172074In time of action. I stand condemned for this;

3.3.2182075They think my little stomach to the war,

3.3.2192076And your great love to me, restrains you thus.

3.3.2202077Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid

3.3.2212078Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold

3.3.2222079And, like a dewdrop from the lion's mane,

3.3.2232080Be shook to airy air.

2081Achilles

Be shook to airy air. Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.

I see my reputation is at stake;

3.3.2262084My fame is shrewdly gored.

2085Patroclus

My fame is shrewdly gored. Oh, then, beware.

3.3.2272086Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.

3.3.2282087Omission to do what is necessary

3.3.2292088Seals a commission to a blank of danger,

3.3.2302089And danger, like an ague, subtly taints

3.3.2312090Even then when we sit idly in the sun.

Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus;

3.3.2332092I'll send the fool to Ajax, and desire him

3.3.2342093T'invite the Trojan lords after the combat

3.3.2352094To see us here unarmed. I have a woman's longing,

3.3.2362095An appetite that I am sick withal

3.3.2372096To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,

3.3.237.1Enter Thersites.

3.3.2382097To talk with him, and to behold his visage

3.3.2392098Even to my full of view. -- [Notices Thersites] A labor saved.

A wonder.

What?

Ajax goes up and down the field asking for 2102himself.

How so?

He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector 2105and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgeling 2106that he raves in saying nothing.

How can that be?

Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock, a 2109stride and a stand, ruminates like an hostess that hath no 2110arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; 2111bites his lip with a politic regard as who should 2112say, "there were wit in his head an 'twould out," and so 2113there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint 2114which will not show without knocking. The man's undone 2115forever, for if Hector break not his neck i'th'combat, 2116he'll break't himself in vainglory. He knows 2117not me. I said, "Good morrow, Ajax," and he replies, 2118"Thanks, Agamemnon." What think you of this man 2119that takes me for the general? He's grown a very 2120land-fish: languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion. 2121A man may wear it on both sides like a leather 2122jerkin.

Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody. He professes 2125not answering; speaking is for beggars; he wears 2126his tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence. Let Patroclus 2127make his demands to me; you shall see the pageant 2128of Ajax.

To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the 2130valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come 2131unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe conduct for his 2132person of the magnanimous and most illustrious 2133six-or-seven-times-honored captain, general of the Grecian 2134army, Agamemnon, etc. Do this.

[To Thersites] Jove bless great Ajax.

[Pretending to be Ajax]Hum.

I come from the worthy Achilles --

Ha?

-- who most humbly desires you to invite Hector 2140to his tent --

Hum.

-- and to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

Agamemnon?

Ay, my lord.

Ha?

What say you to't?

God b'wi'you, with all my heart.

Your answer, sir?

If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock 2150it will go one way or other; howsoever, he shall pay for 2151me ere he has me.

Your answer, sir?

[Pretending to exit] Fare you well, with all my heart.

Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will 2156be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know 2157not, but I am sure none, unless the fiddler Apollo get his 2158sinews to make catlings on.

Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him 2160straight.

Let me carry another to his horse, for that's the 2162more capable creature.

My mind is troubled like a fountain stirred,

3.3.2712164And I myself see not the bottom of it.
