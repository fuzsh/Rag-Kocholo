        "text": "In the last few years, the surge in the country's Hispanic population and the success of Spanish-language radio and television have caused newspaper publishers across the nation to try to cash in. Start new Spanish supplements and Spanish editions, they ordered. Then they sat back to wait for the advertisements and dollars to roll in.\n\nQue horror! The expected Hispanic readers never turned off their radios and televisions, advertisers never arrived and shareholders of the newspaper companies wanted to know why cash was pouring out, not in. Now the publishers are shutting their new sections or at least cutting them back.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Fort Worth and Chicago, newspapers have reversed course. And on Friday, The Daily News of New York confirmed that it too might close its bilingual newspaper, El Daily News, just four months after introducing it.\n\nAcross the nation, profit projections based on the surge in Hispanic buying power and notions about community service have confronted the realities of heavy competition from radio and television, rising newsprint costs and restive shareholders.\n\nInitially, said Gilbert H. Bailon, president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and an editor at The Dallas Morning News, \"people wanted to do it because they wanted to provide coverage for a community,\" confident that Spanish-language sections would win profits and praise. \"Now,\" he added, \"the bottom line is becoming more difficult.\"\n\nTwo years ago, The Los Angeles Times expanded Nuestro Tiempo, its Spanish-language supplement that had come out 15 times a year, and began publishing 400,000 copies weekly. \"This exciting new publication expands our efforts in the largely bilingual and Spanish-speaking segment of the market,\" said David Laventhol, then the publisher of the Los Angeles Times, in his own newspaper.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
