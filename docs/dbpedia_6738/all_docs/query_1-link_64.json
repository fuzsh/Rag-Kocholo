        "text": "Classroom Policy (Reglas o etiquetas de la clase).\n\nà READ AHEAD ß\n\nUse Spanish at all times!\n\nCourtesy and civility foster a positive and conducive learning environment.\n\nBe courteous and conduct yourself appropriately for learning. This means respecting the rights of other students and the Instructor at all times. It includes turning cell phones and pagers off for each and every class period.\n\nShould your cell phone, Ipod, pager, or other electronic device go off or be in use while in the classroom, at any time, you may have 5% deducted from the next relevant exam for the chapter. No warnings will be provided on this. I may ask you to list your name on a sheet of paper which will simply keep a record of the times this happens with you and other individual students.\n\nInform the instructor prior to class if you need to leave early.\n\nIf late, take your seat and join the activities promptly.\n\nDo not take it personally when the instructor corrects your pronunciation and /or answers. You are here to learn. Feel free to correct others. J\n\nNo hats allowed! Please remove them as you come in.\n\nRudeness, disrespect, harassment, and disruption wont be tolerated. After the first warning, if the offense is repeated, the instructor will ask you to leave or security will escort you out.\n\nLearn to be critical of your culture as your learn about others. Use a sense of humor.\n\nFeel free to bring a soda pop, coffee, tea, juices and water and to class. Discard the empty containers upon exiting the classroom. No one should clean up after you! Civility is important!\n\nNo sleeping, smoking, carrying of weapons or consumption of illegal drugs or alcoholic beverages will be allowed. Do NOT attend class drunk or with a hangover: It is disrespectful and vulgar.\n\nDo not read catalogues, magazines, newspapers or classes material not pertinent to Spanish.\n\nOnly the instructor has the authority to dismiss class. Do not gather your material in the backpack while an activity or lecturing is still in progress.\n\nIf the instructor is late (there is always a valid reason), wait silently and patiently at your seat, after 15 minutes you are allowed to leave. Do not disrupt the other classes in the building.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the evacuation procedure posted by the door.\n\nContact me and visit me during office hours with any concerns you may have about the course.\n\nInformation on DRC"
