Over the past six months, Evan Ratliff has been trying to find out. He combined a clone of his voice, an AI chatbot, and a phone lineâmany phone lines, actuallyâinto what are called âvoice agents.â Then he sent them outâ¦ as himself. They talked to sources and colleagues (including his fellow Longform co-hosts), friends and family, scammers and spammers, other AI voice agents, and even therapists. The result is a story of what it feels like when you try to take control of the very technology that threatens to replace you.\n\nNew episodes drop on Tuesdays starting July 9.\n\nVisitÂ shellgame.coÂ to find out more, subscribe, and support the show.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

His next book isÂ The Message.\n\nâI donât think we have the luxury as journalists of avoiding things because people might say bad things about us. I donât even think we have the luxury of avoiding things because we might get fired. I donât think we have the luxury of avoiding them because somebody might cancel some sort of public speech that we have. I then have to ask you, what are you in it for? Like, why did you come here? Did you come here just to make a living?

But it, in some ways, is more interesting because it is produced in a short amount of time, and itâs read as something that is not supposed to be complete. Itâs just meant to provoke or to provide thought or whatever, to provide some sort of context on a certain issue or not. And I actually like that a lot better than the magazine writing. I respect the magazine writersâobviously, I was oneâbut for my disposition now, in my lifestyle, I actually enjoy having to produce this thing every week.â\n\nHave a question for the mailbag?Â Email the showÂ or leave a voicemail at (929) 333-2908.\n\nShow notes:\n\n@jaycaspiankang\n\nKang on Longform\n\nKang on Longform PodcastÂ (Oct 2021)\n\nKang on Longform PodcastÂ (Aug 2017)\n\nKang on Longform PodcastÂ (Apr 2013)\n\nKangâsÂ New YorkerÂ archive\n\n06:00Â Coin Talk\n\n08:00Â Tyler Austin HarperâsÂ AtlanticÂ archive\n\n10:00Â Serial\n\n12:00Â The Daily\n\n20:00Â âThe High Is Always the Pain and the Pain Is Always the HighâÂ (The Morning News â¢ Oct 2010)\n\n28:00Â JamesÂ (Percival Everett â¢ Doubleday â¢ 2024)\n\n34:00Â âAmerican SonâÂ (ESPN â¢ July 2024)\n\n35:00Â KangâsÂ VICEÂ archive\n\n42:00Â âMike Francesa Still Believes in the Power of RadioâÂ (New York Times â¢ Aug 2018)\n\n43:00Â KangâsÂ GrantlandÂ archive\n\n43:00Â KangâsÂ New York TimesÂ archive\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
