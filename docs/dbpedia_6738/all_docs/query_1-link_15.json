Coming up close to these narratives expands your capacity for analysis and critical thinking.\n\nReading in Spanish is an enjoyable activity and moves away from traditional language learning methods. When you read, you allow your creativity and imagination to grow. You get an interest in criticizing, researching, and asking questions about those aspects of a book that captivate you.\n\nA Spanish reading list is an innovative and hands-on resource that motivates and educates language learners.
