        "text": "Magazines in Spain are varied and numerous,[1] but they have small circulation.[2] In terms of frequency, the Spanish magazines are mostly weekly and monthly.[3] Although there are news magazines and political magazines in the country, they mostly focus on entertainment, social events, sports, and television.[3]\n\nThere were many influential feminist magazines in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the country. The first magazine of which the editor-in-chief was a woman was El Robespierre Español which was in circulation in between 1811 and 1812.[4] The number of mainstream women's magazines intensified in the 1960s.[5] As of 2014 there were also a large number of aviation magazines in the country.[6]\n\nAt least thirteen magazines were published by the Falange-operated publishing companies in 1948.[7] The data by the General Media Survey indicated that there were 137 magazines in Spain in 2003.[8] By the beginning of 2005 the number had risen to 576.[9] In addition, there were a total of 19 supplements.[9] However, between 2008 and 2012 a total of 182 magazines ceased publication in Spain.[10]\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of current and defunct magazines published in Spain.
