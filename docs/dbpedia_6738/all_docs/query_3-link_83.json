        "text": "The Story Behind Palo Magazine\n\nRosa Julia Parra, CEO and owner of Palo Magazine, didnât set out to be in publishing. She didnât plan to be a writer, a community leader or an inspiration to her community. But sometimes, when we surrender to lifeâs changes, unexpected opportunities emerge from the shadows and show us who we were meant to be.\n\nRosa had spent almost 20 years working for a bank â a solid 9 to 5 job that helped her build the type of life her family had always envisioned for her: a house, a car, a family and a stable future. While not wildly happy or fulfilled, exactly, Rosa was content. Her mother (a first-generation immigrant to America from Puerto Rico) had instilled in her a great work ethic â but also a healthy dose of fear when it came to risk.\n\nIn 2011, however, the perfect picture began to crumble.\n\nAfter 19 years of employment, the bank outsourced Rosaâs job to India. Her marriage dissolved around the same time â leaving her an unemployed, single mother just as she was approaching age 40.\n\nâThere were a lot of changes at once,â Rosa recollects. âItâs almost like the universe was moving me towards something different.â\n\nDespite the personal pain she was working through, Rosa began connecting with her community â building relationships, talking to new people and exploring the culture of Reading and beyond. She met a DJ and radio personality named Chamo King, now her husband, who had a penchant for culture, music and fashion. The two became closer and began to work collaboratively on Chamo Kingâs passion project â a magazine that would eventually transform into Palo.\n\nRosaâs burgeoning new lifestyle was challenged, however, when the bank offered Rosa her position back. After some soul-searching, she accepted â but experienced a surreal phenomenon when she walked back through the doors of the banks she knew so well for so many years.\n\nEverything looked the same, from the cubicles to the hallways to the desks. But to Rosaâs refreshed perspective, the facility now called to mind something completely different: A rat maze. A few months in, Rosa was miserable. Chamo King told her, âQuit your job. Iâll back you up.â Together, they decided to take the plunge.\n\nAnd although there were a few dicey seasons, Rosa and Chamo King eventually came out on top. As their relationship grew, the magazine project grew as well. Rosa became more and more invested in the future and direction of the publication. She also became more comfortable in the driverâs seat â Chamo King eventually handed over leadership of the publication into her capable hands, although he remains a critical part of the art direction, the layout and the design features.\n\nPalo Magazine has expanded rapidly over the past 12 years, now reaching about 35,000 households and businesses each month.\n\nThe Story Behind Palo Magazine\n\nRosa Julia Parra, CEO and owner of Palo Magazine, didnât set out to be in publishing.

One language doesnât âleadâ over the other â the same visual real estate is given to both Spanish and English on every page.\n\nBut the magazine didnât start that way. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Rosaâs primary written language is actually English, thanks to her public school education at Reading High School â meaning the original, Spanish-only versions of Palo Magazine were a labor of love and the product of a lot of âGooglingâ to say the least! It wasnât until a English-speaking colleague approached Rosa and said, âI love thisâ¦ But I canât read it.â\n\nAlmost on the spot, she decided to pivot and create a bilingual publication â a task she was perfectly equipped for and a move that produced some unforeseen, yet beneficial, results.\n\nPalo Magazine has become an extraordinary educational resource. The content covers lifestyle and community stories, but itâs also peppered with critical financial advice and decision-making guidance for the Spanish-speaking community from Rosaâs banking background â quality, trusted information that Latino communities sometimes find hard to come by.\n\nRosa also reports anecdotal evidence of the magazine being used as a language-learning tool. Running the English and Spanish side-by-side helps readers recognize sentence structure, flow, and emotion thatâs woven into the articles, thereby creating a truly unique learning opportunity for speakers of both languages.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Palo Magazine is its dedication to creating equivalent bilingual content.

It implies harmony and equality without sacrificing uniqueness and points towards the ultimate vision of the publication: educating and connecting the community.\n\nA passionate believer in the power of unity, Rosa imagines a future for Reading where our community initiatives, programs and events work in tandem, without language-based, cultural separations.\n\nâYou should never be the smartest person in the room,â Rosa said. âAnd when we isolate ourselves, thatâs exactly what happens â we lose the opportunity to learn from each other.â\n\nRosa truly sees the magazine as developed by the people, for the people. Despite the numerous awards and accolades the magazine has received, Rosa refuses to hang them on her walls.\n\nâAs soon as I hang those up, I know Iâll get a big head. I donât want to think about what I did yesterday; I want to think about what Iâm doing today. Every day is a fresh start,â she said.\n\nThe philosophy behind the arrangement of Palo Magazineâs content is subtle yet strong.
