        "text": "The Spanish Present Tense is the perfect place to start when learning Spanish.\n\nNot only is it the most widely used tense, but once you have the verb endings down, you will notice a pattern that repeats itself in nearly all the other tenses.\n\nVerbs in the present tense are, for the most part, predictable, so mastering them is totally attainable!\n\nThe Spanish present tense is used not only to talk about what’s happening right now, but also…\n\nTo talk about the future.\n\n-No tengo tiempo hoy, voy mañana. => I don’t have time today, I’m going tomorrow.\n\nTo talk about an ongoing action.\n\n-Estudio música en el conservatorio. => I am studying music at the conservatory.\n\nTo convey an action you’re in the habit of doing.\n\n-Miro mucha televisión. => I watch a lot of TV.\n\nTo narrate past events.\n\nYou most likely have been doing this in English without realizing!\n\nHow many times have you asked your friends about the ending of a movie after watching it?\n\n¿Crees que al final se quedan juntos?\n\n​Do you think they stay together at the end?\n\nEnglish speakers have been using the present simple in these situations without even blinking an eye.\n\nSo strategically speaking, the present tense is going to help you immensely in your learning process.\n\nYou will need to devote a considerable amount of time on it but keep in mind that Spanish conjugation is the bulk of the hard work!\n\nIf you had trouble getting your point across before, you will now be able to express yourself in a clearer way while talking to native speakers.\n\nMastering the Spanish present tense will provide you with a nice boost to your confidence to push past your fear of speaking Spanish.\n\nReady To Get Started?\n\nAs far as Spanish verbs go, regular verbs are always the best place to start.\n\nWhy?\n\nThey are nicely predictable.\n\nWork your way through the article, taking time with each section, making sure you understand everything and have the concepts down before moving on to the next.\n\nStart with the regular verbs. Conjugate, conjugate, conjugate.\n\nI can’t stress enough how important is to work hard on those conjugations. Take mental breaks!\n\nThen, move on to the irregular verbs. Look for patterns. Repetition will help you immensely.\n\nWhen it starts reacting to improperly conjugated verbs, you will realize your brain has not burned up and you are making progress. It will take time, effort, and positive thinking! Yes, you can!\n\nFinally, in case you feel like you have the basics down and want to skip to the tricky topics like the stem-changing verbs, feel free to use this clickable table of contents (below) to jump to the section you most need help on.\n\nPresent Tense Spanish, Part 1: Regular Verbs\n\nThere are three unique categories that Spanish verbs fall into:\n\nVerbs that end in AR - For instance, cocinar (to cook), viajar (to travel), hablar (to talk/speak), etc.\n\nVerbs that end in ER - For instance, comer (to eat), beber (to drink), leer (to read), etc.\n\nVerbs that end in IR - For instance, vivir (to live), decidir (to decide), escribir (to write), etc.\n\nTo conjugate these verbs in the Spanish present tense, you take the root (also called the stem) of the word and add the correct ending, depending on the person (yo, tú, él, nosotros, etc.) and the type of verb in front of us (-ar/-er/-ir).\n\nThe type of verb (-ar/-er/-ir) determines the ending.\n\nLet’s first start with the -ar verbs in the present tense.\n\n1) -AR Verbs in Present Tense\n\nConjugate -ar verbs as follows:\n\nSpanish -AR Verb Conjugations\n\nYo\n\n-0\n\nTú\n\n-as\n\nVos\n\nás\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted\n\na\n\nNosotros\n\n-amos\n\nVosotros\n\n-áis\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes\n\n-an\n\nLet’s put the puzzle together for the verb cocinar which means “to cook.”\n\nCocinar => Cocin- + ending\n\nYo cocino\n\nNosotros cocinamos\n\nTú cocinas\n\n​\n\nVos cocinás\n\nVosotros cocináis\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted cocina\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes cocinan\n\nNow we can build a complete sentence. For example:\n\nYo cocino para mis hijos todos los días.​\n\nI cook for my children everyday.\n\n2) -ER Verbs in Present Tense\n\nConjugate the -er verbs as follows:\n\nSpanish -ER Verb Conjugations\n\nYo\n\n-0\n\nTú\n\n-es\n\nVos\n\n-és\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted\n\n-e\n\nNosotros\n\n-emos\n\nVosotros\n\n-éis\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes\n\n-en\n\nDon’t the endings for the -er verbs look awfully familiar?\n\nFor the first person singular (yo), they are almost the same as the ones for the -ar verbs, except you use an “e” instead of an “a.”\n\nLet’s take the verb beber which means “to drink.”\n\nBeber => Beb- + ending\n\nYo bebo\n\nNosotros bebemos\n\nTú bebes\n\n​\n\nVos bebés\n\nVosotros bebéis\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted bebe\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes beben\n\nNow we can use it in a complete sentence.\n\nBebo cafe todas las mañanas antes de estudiar español. => I drink coffee every morning before studying Spanish.\n\n3) -IR Verbs in Present Tense\n\nConjugate the -ir verbs as follows:\n\nSpanish -IR Verb Conjugations\n\nYo\n\n-0\n\nTú\n\n-es\n\nVos\n\n-ís\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted\n\n-e\n\nNosotros\n\n-imos\n\nVosotros\n\n-ís\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes\n\n-en\n\nNo, you haven’t lost your mind.\n\nThe -ir verbs share most of the same endings with the -er verbs, except for the vos, nosotros, and vosotros forms.\n\nLet’s look at the verb escribir.\n\nEscribir => escrib- + ending\n\nYo escribo\n\nNosotros escribimos\n\nTú escribes\n\n​\n\nVos escribís\n\nVosotros escribís\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted escribe\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes escriben\n\nWhat about in a sentence?\n\nPaula escribe para la revista desde hace quince años. => Paula has been writing for the magazine for fifteen years.\n\nNow comes every Spanish learner’s favorite part. It’s perhaps the most difficult.\n\nHave no fear, I’m here to teach you just what you need to know with the present tense in Spanish.\n\nPresent Tense Spanish, Part 2: Irregular Verbs\n\nIf the regular verbs had healthy roots, the irregular ones need a root canal.\n\nThey are so rebellious they will test your limits. The good news is, all you need is to learn the specifics and then practice with repetition and patience.\n\nYou can do this!\n\nTo make things a bit easier on you, we will start with simple examples then move on to more complex ones. Take baby steps.\n\nFirst Person Irregular in Spanish Present Tense\n\nSome verbs are irregular ONLY in the first person and regular in all other forms.\n\nYeah, what the heck, right?\n\nHowever, as far as irregular verbs go, they are fairly easy to learn.\n\nMost Common Spanish Irregular Verbs\n\nLet’s take a closer look at one of the verbs from the list: hacer which means “to do” or “to make.”\n\nThe first person form is irregular in the Spanish present tense.\n\nYo hago la tarea. ​\n\nI do the homework.\n\nThe other forms are regular:\n\nHacer => to do or to make\n\nYo hago\n\nNosotros hacemos\n\nTú haces\n\n​\n\nVos hacés\n\nVosotros hacéis\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted hace\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes hacen\n\nTener & Venir in the Present Tense\n\nThe verbs tener and venir are not only irregular, but also stem-changers.\n\nIn addition, they have another thing in common; they share a pattern of conjugation.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at tener.\n\nTener => to have\n\nYo tengo\n\nNosotros tenemos\n\nTú tienes\n\n​\n\nVos tenés\n\nVosotros tenéis\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted tiene\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes tienen\n\nNow let's look at the useful Spanish verb venir which means to come.\n\nBelow, you will see the conjugations for venir in the Spanish present tense.\n\nVenir => to come\n\nYo vengo\n\nNosotros venimos\n\nTú vienes\n\n​\n\nVos venís\n\nVosotros venís\n\nÉl/Ella/Usted viene\n\nEllos/Ellas/Ustedes vienen\n\nPresent Tense Spanish, Part 3: Stem-Changing Verbs\n\nAs the word indicates, stem-changing verbs change their stem (or root) in the present tense in all forms EXCEPT for vos, nosotros, and vosotros.\n\nStarting to lose faith?\n\nDo no panic!\n\nIt is a very common feeling that can be reversed.
