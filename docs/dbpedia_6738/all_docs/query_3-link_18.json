        "text": "Whenever we are learning a foreign language it is important to get to know the culture not only through the grammar or teaching words, but through the speech in newspapers and magazines.\n\nYes, I know you are thinking… but how do I get free Spanish newspapers or magazines about London and how am I going to understand them??\n\nWell here in London we are lucky to find different online magazines and newspapers to keep us aware about Hispanic life in London: events, news, sports, festivals, gossips… And just taking a glance at headlines gives us an idea about the topic and if we might be interested in it.\n\nHere is a selection of the best and most known Spanish magazines and newspapers in London:\n\nEL IBÉRICO\n\nIbérico Gratuito is the only fortnightly newspaper written in Spanish for the Spanish Community in London. It was created after many Spanish people came to London to live and work and wanted a communication related to Hispanic events or news. It was born from a need to inform and create links in the Spanish Community in London.\n\nYou can find it printed in Stations such as: Victoria, Charing Cross, St James Park, Queensway, Tower Hill, Baker Street, Camden Town, etc… or check online for free at http://www.eliberico.com/\n\nLa TUNDRA\n\nLa Tundra is an independent printed and online magazine written in Spanish in London whose aim is to reach new audiences in the UK showcasing well-established artists but also supporting emerging talents and festivals.\n\nLa Tundra printed edition is written in Spanish, although the main articles are translated into English for the web, so you can find bilingual versions of the most interesting stories.\n\nAlthough the printed version is only distributed in embassies, consulates, some bookshops, libraries, universities, festivals and concerts, you can always find them online at http://www.latundra.com/\n\nLa Revista Magazine\n\nLa Revista is the British Spanish Society flagship magazine. Published three times per year, it is received first by its members before being distributed more widely in London and elsewhere. The magazine became known as La Revista in 2010 to coincide with a new improved format and editorial focus. Since then it continues to forge its identity through the coverage of Society events, helping to recruit new members and serving as a promotional platform for our corporate supporters. But you can have a look at their archives in https://www.britishspanishsociety.org/la-revista/\n\nLatinoLife\n\nLatinolife is the one of UK’s leading Latino and Hispanic lifestyle and listings magazine. A printed guide to Latin London, every season they distribute 20,000 copies to Latin American, Spanish, Portuguese and other cool venues across London, as well as hand to hand at the big Latin concerts and events.\n\nThe magazine distribution entails: Spanish/Latin American venues along the ‘Latin routes’ From South (Brixton/ Clapham/Vauxhall) to NE (Seven Sisters) and NW (Willesden Green) plus selected record shops, cafes, bars, colleges, libraries, community centres in multicultural areas such as Stoke Newington, Crouch End, Hackney.\n\nBut you can always have a look online at http://latinolife.co.uk/magazine\n\nAre you ready to read some Spanish newspapers or magazines?\n\nWhich is your favourite one and why?!"
