        "text": "In this post: A round-up of the best educational Spanish and bilingual magazines for kids and families learning Spanish.\n\nIf you want fresh, relevant Spanish content delivered right to your door, you may want to look into getting a Spanish magazine subscription—and we’ve got you covered!\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. As an Amazon affiliate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nKids love the excitement of getting their own mail, especially when it’s something fun just for them. Who doesn’t, right? With each issue, you’ll have a new topic to explore, adding an element of surprise, too, even if you opt for a digital subscription.\n\nAt Llamitas Spanish, we are passionate about sharing the best Spanish resources to support you in raising bilingual children. That’s why our Spanish Freebie Library offers monthly rotating printable packs, flash cards, games, music playlists, and more!\n\nOf course, the more authentic Spanish input you can get, the better you can support your child’s language learning, and a magazine subscription is an easy and often affordable addition to your toolbox.\n\nWe’ll let you know about some of the best educational Spanish magazines for kids (including some bilingual options), so you can decide which one is the best fit for your family.\n\nHow do you say “magazine” in Spanish?\n\nThe noun “magazine” in Spanish is “revista” (pronounced “rreh-bees-tah”).\n\nThere are so many benefits of having a Spanish magazine subscription, whether you’re a bilingual family, homeschooling Spanish as a foreign language, or just looking for a fun way to practice your language skills.\n\nWhile there are tons of Spanish and bilingual resources out there that can suit your needs, here are some of the advantages of a magazine subscription:\n\nFresh content. Our world is constantly changing, and each new issue of a magazine will reflect that. A magazine subscription can help you to stay up to date in the topics you’re interested in.\n\nThematic learning. Magazines often focus on a specific theme, and this will allow your child to apply their Spanish skills to topics they are really interested in—much like thematic Spanish lessons, which are a cross-curricular approach to language learning that truly works.\n\nConvenience. Being able to subscribe once and have magazines delivered right to your door (or inbox), is another huge advantage. Plus, some of the magazines we’ll show you include lesson plans, making them a great choice for homeschooling families.\n\nHow to Pick a Spanish Magazine for Your Kid\n\nThere are a lot of great Spanish magazines for kids out there, so it can be hard to choose just one! When picking out the best Spanish magazine subscription for your kid, you’ll want to think about their age, language level, and favorite topics to learn about.\n\nAge or Grade Level\n\nWe’ve included recommended ages and grade levels in our round-up of Spanish children’s magazines, so you can find the best age-appropriate content.\n\nFor younger learners, look for simple language, activities and puzzles, and fun pictures or illustrations to keep them engaged. Magazines for older kids and teens will have more complex language, advanced vocabulary, and likely go more in-depth depending on the topic.\n\nLanguage Level\n\nPay attention to the language level of the magazine and make sure it aligns with your child’s Spanish skills. For example, a magazine that’s intended for young kids who are native Spanish speakers may be too difficult for you and your preschooler if you’re new to the language. In this case you may want to consider a bilingual English and Spanish magazine instead.\n\nDon’t worry—we will let you know which ones are Spanish only or bilingual!\n\nTopics\n\nWith kids especially, it’s so important for them to learn language in a way that’s natural and fun. Whether they’re interested in travel, nature, pop culture, or cooking, look for magazines that will connect with those interests. We’ve included plenty here for you to choose from!\n\nRelated post: How to Raise a Biliterate Kid\n\nRelated post: Best Spanish Readers and Leveled Books\n\nEducational Spanish Magazines for Kids\n\nHere are some of the best educational Spanish magazines for kids:\n\nHigh Five Bilingüe (ages 2–6)\n\nWhile the English version of Highlights High Five magazine occasionally introduces young learners to Spanish, High Five Bilingüe is fully bilingual. With engaging puzzles, stories, poems, crafts, and more, my kids love High Five magazine—and the bilingual edition includes all of this in both English and Spanish.\n\nAlthough it’s geared toward young children, older kids and even adults who are learning Spanish will benefit from the simple language and easy translations in this print magazine.\n\nExplora Mag (ages 7–12)\n\nOlder kids who are interested in travel and geography will love Explora, a print or digital “bookazine” that is fully in Spanish. Each issue explores a different location while providing plenty of activities and content, like articles with beautiful photos, maps, and games.\n\nThis is a fantastic option for older kids and those who are a bit more advanced in their Spanish skills. To learn more, check out this deep dive review of Explora from Bilingual Balance.\n\nCiencia Studies Weekly (grades K–6)\n\nCiencia Studies Weekly is a great choice for parents who are homeschooling and want an immersive, cross-curricular approach to learning Spanish—and, of course, for kids who love science!\n\nThis is the Spanish edition of Science Studies Weekly, full of open-and-go science lessons you can include in your homeschooling every week throughout elementary school. It’s available online or in print to fit your lifestyle.\n\nAlgarabía Niños (grades K–6)\n\nThis children’s magazine is fully in Spanish and covers a variety of fun topics that will fascinate your kids, from pop culture (think Star Wars, Harry Potter, and LEGO) to historical topics like vikings and Frida Kahlo and everything in between!\n\nSince this is a Mexican children’s magazine, it’s not available in print in the US, but you can still order the digital version. This is a great option for elementary aged kids with intermediate Spanish skills and bilingual kids.\n\nScholastic Spanish Classroom Magazines (grades 7–12)\n\nScholastic offers three levels of Spanish Classroom Magazines: ¿Qué Tal? (Level 1), Ahora (Level 2), and El Sol (Level 3). The content is perfect for teens, and with complete lesson plans and digital resources included, these are a great choice for homeschool families.\n\nLadybug en español (ages 3–6)\n\nLadybug en español is no longer being published, but there are several back issues available that you can still order from the Cricket Media website. Just like the standard Ladybug magazine, this one includes beautiful illustrations and simple stories, poems, and songs perfect for preschoolers and early elementary students learning Spanish.\n\nReportero Doc (ages 9–11)\n\nReportero Doc is entirely in Spanish and is an excellent option for middle school and older elementary aged kids with intermediate or advanced Spanish skills. With the variety of engaging yet educational topics covered, this is another one for homeschooling families to consider.\n\nA year subscription costs you a bit over $100, and the magazine is available in print in the US only.\n\nRevista Tú (teens)\n\nThis Mexican magazine for teens is completely in Spanish and a great choice for anyone who loves to stay current with the latest pop culture news.
