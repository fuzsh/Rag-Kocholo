        "text": "More to come, but this is the first one I can contribute with:\n\n– Hobby Consolas (the best-selling videogame magazine in Spain at the time) was surprised with the unexpected presentation of the “VR System” in their number 40, pages 20 and 21, from January 1995. The picture shows the early controller with the color buttons and their description is pretty accurate (I guess it is all based in the same press release). “Mario Bros VB”, “Punchout” and “Space Pinball” appear to be the first three games to be released.\n\nIf needed, I can translate further, but I guess this info was the same worldwide. These two are high quality scans.\n\nAttachments:\n\nSame goes for the direct competition, SuperJuegos. In their number 33 from the same month (January 1995) a small announcement was included in page 9. Information provided is very similar but shorter, skipping the game names and many details.\n\nHere’s a curiosity: the game on top of the page, Chiquito de la calzada challenge, is an April Fools’ joke. The equivalent of April Fools in Spain takes place on the 28th of December so it was natural to have it published in Jan’s number. Chiquito de la Calzada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiquito_de_la_Calzada) is a very particular and “folkloric” celebrity in Spain. Hard to explain, really, but particularly well-known in the crazy 90’s. All in all, many people believed that news and they had to clarify that all was a joke in February’s number.\n\nAttachments:\n\nmmora wrote:\n\nIf needed, I can translate further, but I guess this info was the same worldwide. These two are high quality scans.\n\nVery cool! Thanks so much for sharing!\n\nSure, if you would like to translate these articles into English, that’d be great! Something that I think would also be great is if you could at least give a critique on the English translation for the Dragon Hopper and Zero Racers articles appearing here:\n\nhttp://www.planetvb.com/modules/articles/?s050198001\n\nThus, if you think any translated sentences aren’t very accurate, you could give your rendition of such. I’m not sure why it also contains an alleged translation for Virtual Bomberman, as I don’t see Virtual Bomberman mentioned in the articles on the two pages uploaded to that section of the site.\n\nHi,\n\nSo I had a chance to go over the translation for the two Mexican pages (Dragon Hopper and Zero Racers) and I would rephrase some segments of the first one. The Zero Racers translation is much more accurate (I’m trying to be less literal and closer to the meaning). I didn’t redo Bound High, which has more mistakes, but it’s of less interest as far as I understand. Feel free to correct any grammar mistake (and apologies for my English). Here they go.\n\nIf you are wondering why we didn’t talk about Virtual Boy games since long ago, let us tell you that it wasn’t our choice, as to take pictures of this system a special device that only Nintendo owns is needed, so we took advantage of our recent trip to NOA to bring some images and in this way talk about the future games that are going to appear for this system, as well as some that are already available.\n\nDragon Hopper\n\nIn Dragon Hopper you control a little dragon called Dorin (who is the Prince on top of that) who must rescue his family and his beloved Diana, abducted by his father’s (the King, obviously) Prime Minister so his mission is to seek the help of the 4 spirits of his Kingdom and, in this way, obtain enough power to face the diabolic PM and to set his loved ones free. The least important thing for anyone is the plot, however, as it is quite simple, burnt out and predictable, but fortunately for the players the game doesn’t share the same fortune as the story line.\n\nAs we already mentioned, you control a Dragon that must go through a series of stages that are divided by floors, so to fully explore a level you need to jump to reach platforms that are over you or let yourself fall through the holes on the ground to descend to lower floors. This effect of going up and down is really well done and on the Virtual Boy it really gives a depth effect which makes the game more attractive.\n\nDorin can perform multiple movements such as jumping, attacking and talking with the people you’ll find on your trip, to obtain clues about the location of the keys in each level to be able to progress or to obtain information about the whereabouts of the four sought-after spirits.\n\nAs you’ll be able to see, this is an excellent adventure game that will allow you to enter a 3D world full of terrible enemies. One of its advantages is its battery, so you’ll be able to save your progress.\n\nZero Racers\n\nWow! After a long wait we will be able to enjoy a racing title for the VB and the best thing is that it is a high-speed one. Those who have had the chance to play it say that it plays very well with a nice sense of speed.\n\nThis game is planned to be released in a couple of months so not many details are available, but we can say that there will be four different types of ships which fly in the channels that define the tracks. Ships have different characteristics (as often found in Nintendo games) so you will need to get used to a ship which accelerates quickly but is not very fast or another that has excellent speed but takes years to get there. The other comment we have heard about this game is that it could be said to be F-zero for the VB, which already speaks well of it. Therefore, we can only hope to be able to tell you more.\n\nTo keep the flow going, I’ll post the two other references I’ve been able to find in Hobby Consolas so far.\n\n– First is page 27 in number 41 (Feb 1995). In summary, the snippet at the bottom of the page talks about the Winter CES in Las Vegas, where the editor had the chance to test the VB. “Nintendo didn’t try to surprise with their games. This time they did so presenting a really revolutionary console: the Virtual Boy”. He really had difficulties explaining the concept; the VB is introduced as a “Game Boy but with faster graphics and in red and black […] all in 3D!”.\n\n– Second is a deeper report in October 1995, number 49, p. 26-28, although in the last paragraph the editor warns the readers: “it is very possible that we won’t ever see this device in Spain”. The language used is interesting overall, but the most particular point is in the game list. If you look at the screenshots at the bottom of page 27, they don’t look at all like the games.\n\nGalactic Pinball: the picture doesn’t look like a pinball table at all and the snippet suggests that the game is not played “as a pinball game”.\n\nMario Clash: the picture looks more like a concept than the real thing. It’s weird as the snippet reads that “first, [Mario] will appear in an adventure similar to Mario Bros. and later in a Tennis game full of surprises.”. Mario Clash was released in October, but Mario Tennis was a launch game a few months before.\n\nGolf: it actually talks about Virtual League Baseball and an “untitled” golf game.\n\nVertical Force: ¿what’s that screenshot?\n\nJack Bros: the last one is almost a joke. Jack Bros is referenced with a ¿coliseum? touristic screenshot and is summarized as “an interactive adventures at the likes of Doom”. ¿What?\n\nWario images at page 28 are scary, too.\n\nThey all came from the tech demos for the Virtual Boy, I guess, but it’s kinda surprising that the editors took that as screenshots for the coming games – or, otherwise, it’s hard to believe that they actually tested the games.\n\nMore to come, please let me know how these could be added to the Magazine Scans section (to make it bigger),\n\nm.\n\nAttachments:\n\nLet’s continue with Superjuegos, the second most important magazine at that time. These are quite simple, however.\n\n– Number 34, February 1995: a short snippet that reads that the “Virtua [sic] Boy is the main weapon that Nintendo has to fight the Mega Drive 32X”, from the Winter CES 1995.\n\n– Number 38, June 1995: again, a short snipped regarding the Virtual Boy in the E3, this time with the final console (check the buttons). Some games are called by their prototype names (Wario Cruise, Mario’s Dream Tennis) while others are final. Release date in the US is correctly stated and there is no mention of the Japanese release.\n\n– In number 48, April 1996, a reader asks about the Virtual Boy. The editor compares it again to the Game Boy and then states “I can tell you that it didn’t get the expected success and sales are expected to rise with the future launches of Star Wing and Zelda.” A little optimistic, isn’t it? It’s probably made up.\n\nNext to come, the third in order of relevance: Nintendo Acción, the official Nintendo Spanish Magazine.\n\nAttachments:\n\nBefore moving to Nintendo Acción (with some large articles), I’ll post these two from the Club Nintendo in Spain. Once managed by Spaco (the NES distributor) in 1994-95 the magazine was in hands of ERBE, the biggest videogame distributor in Spain, who was in charge of the Super Nintendo and the Game Boy.\n\n– First one, from Dicember 1994/January 1995 is quite plain, basically reproducing the press release as seen on others.\n\n– The April/May issue, however, is quite surprising as most of the content seems to be made up. I’ll provide a translation:\n\nThe press was impressed by the Virtual Boy due to the variety and quality of the games shown for this prodigy of a console in the last CES in Las Vegas. Titles like Road Racer (a Formula 1 game with quick and fluent action), Vector Blaster (a flight simulator quite close to Starwing) and Teleroboxing (a first-person robot fighting game) surprised to the specialized press. But, without question, the star of the show was a Mario game, without name yet, that is in the works for the VB. It’s a magnificent adventure, similar to Zelda, in which Mario talks. Hudson Soft also announced that they are working in new titles for the Virtual Boy, and we know that a lot of companies are going to follow, developing new products for Nintendo’s last wonder.\n\n¿Anyone heard of these names at any point? I don’t know anything of a F1 game (and I guess that’s a confusion) but Vector Blaster actually looks as if they were calling Red Alarm by a different name…\n\nNice info, guys.\n\nStarWing could be StarFox and the like\n\n(Just to clarify, Starwing is the PAL name for Starfox, so no confusion there).\n\nOn Rock Man I disagree; the original name is Rockman because all characters are music-based (Rock, Roll, Blues, Forte..). The decision to change it to Mega Man it’s a one guy thing: Joseph Morici, Capcom’s Senior Vice-President at the time, who disliked the original name and changed it almost unilaterally. This left some contradictions however, as Rock changed to Mega but Roll kept the same, Blues changed to Proto and Forte to Bass (which is related to music too). Weird choices.\n\nI am pretty sure that they’re referring to the demos shown behind closed doors at WCES ’95\n\nAfter watching the video I do fully agree. There is a bit of fantasy in the snippet but it’s clear it’s based in those images shown at the WCES. Very interesting footage.\n\nThanks for your feedback, I’ll keep it up!\n\nSo, Nintendo Acción is next. This magazine is the official Nintendo mag in Spain, edited by the same publisher as Hobby Consolas. First, this is number 26 from January 1995, p.10-11.\n\nThe Virtual Boy snippet is, again, quite plain and absolutely based in the press release. Games mentioned are, as always, Teleroboxer, Mario Bros VB and Space Pinball. No release date for Europe but their estimation is either Summer or, if delayed due to holidays, September.\n\nMost interesting is the last part, with an interesting dive into the Ultra 64 (mostly rumours that didn’t happen in the end, such as launch dates, CD for the 64, etc…). Another interesting snippet talks about a possible CD for the SNES; confirming that Nintendo didn’t close the deal with Sony, so the PlayStation happened, and the same happened with Philips, originating the CDi. But the project is not yet closed, according to the magazine. “It could be in the final stages of development.”\n\nAnd the last mention in the Nintendo Acción magazine is the longest. It’s number 35, October 1995, p.16-19.\n\nThe main point in this article (“The USA plays already, in Europe they dream about it”). is that “The USA market will test the possibilities of the VB” and “Its launch in the US contrasts with the uncertainty around the launch in our country.”\n\nAs vuefinder83 said in a previous post, here it’s also odd how they still use pre-production images (and titles) three months after its release in JP/USA. Screenshots are, again, from the tech demos. At least descriptions are accurate.\n\nThere is also a debate regarding whether it is portable or not “nobody can think of a person playing VB in a bus stop” but it is “a new concept”.\n\n“When is the VB coming to Spain?” Never, probably (in other words). They summarize it as “respect to the new consoles, the strong competition, respect to the prices and, all in all, that the VB concept doesn’t have repercusion over the public.” “Nintendo Spain is insecure regarding how the VB would work in the Spanish market.” This being said, “If the VB works well in USA, Nintendo will release the console in Europe.”.\n\nAs we all know, that never happened."
