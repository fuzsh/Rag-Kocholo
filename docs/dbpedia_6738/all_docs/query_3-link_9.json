        "text": "Post by Dani on\n\nI remember when I was a kid and my dad used to get us the Reader Digest magazines (in Spanish though). We were always excited to get a new one every month, and went to read it right away.\n\nLately, I have been thinking it might be a good idea to do the same for my kid. I have been surfing online for little kids (preschool) magazines only in the minority language, but I have found only one from Scholastic. However, I need to be a teacher to be able to subscribe.\n\nPlease, If you know of any let me know.\n\nThanks!\n\nDani\n\nPost by Reina on\n\nDani, he is only 18 months, he won't be reading for a while so do not worry.\n\nI know I have strange ideas about it but as long as the kids are not reading by themselves or showing interest in letters (and somebody speaks the ml with the kids), I do not see the need for so many printed resources in the ml. Once they are reading or you move on to read aloud chapter books, then we agree, get them as many things as possible, but until then I do not see the real need. At those ages it is much more important, from my point of view, what you do with the resource than the language in which the resource is. When they are so small, they look at the colors, the shapes...it does not matter if the magazine is in English or Spanish, what matters is that we use the ml when we interact with the child and the resource. When the child is looking at it by himself, he is also not reading yet, so still I do not see the need. In my opinion at those ages it is more important to have a lot of variation in books than those books are in ml.\n\nPinterest has a looooooooooooot of pins with preschool material in Spanish. Colors, shapes, numbers, letters...You can print it all and make your own magazine. I did it a few times with my boys but mostly we used a magazine we bought now and then in ML and that I would just translate on the fly for them in ml. Furthermore I find that if you do not use magazines at those preschool ages, you are much more flexible in being able to offer your child what he is interested in. For example, one of my boys loved mazes and there was only one in the magazine, so he was quickly bored. By printing them, I was able to give them many and to talk about it with him what is at that age (again my own point of view) much more important than the resource itself.\n\nPost by Adam Beck on\n\nReina, I think you make very good points and offer really helpful suggestions.\n\nFor the child's sake, I agree that specifically minority language materials may not be necessary at a young age. At the same time, it might also be true that, for the parent's sake, the idea of building resources in the minority language from birth (even before birth) can establish this key habit right from the start and create momentum for sustaining what should be an ongoing action throughout childhood. In other words, the value of making efforts to gather minority language resources may be, at least early on, more important for the parent than for the child. Not only will this set in motion a crucial habit for long-term success, such resources in the home environment can help keep the parent more conscious and proactive from day to day--and this is especially important during the first formative years.\n\nSo I don't disagree at all. I suppose the \"need\" for minority language materials, at that early age, largely depends on the individual parent and his or her circumstances.\n\nPost by Lena P on\n\nThis is not for little kids, per se, but I plan to get National Geographic en espanol when my toddler is a little older. You CAN order that for delivery in the States and there are often really great pictures with ml captions that I can incorporate into morning reading time. I also like to read it for myself.\n\nI just googled this and it looks like National Geographic Kids has a Spanish version! Since I got the adult version en espanol, you should be able to do the same with this! Que bueno!\n\nAlso, I must say that my philosophy is that written materials are great, even when the kids are pre-literate. You definitely use different words when you read something that someone else wrote than when you just discuss it yourself using pictures. Plus, even if you subscribe early, you could always save the best issues and then \"recycle\" them for when the kids are older and reading themselves.\n\n(And I also don't like bilingual stuff, because I agree that it will be too tempting to read the easier ML version of things!)\n\nLena"
