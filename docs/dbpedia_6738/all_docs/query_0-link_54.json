        "text": "Kritika Kultura invites interested scholars to submit manuscripts to a Forum Kritika on Spanish Literature on the Philippines, guest edited by Rocío Ortuño Casanova of University of Antwerp (Belgium). Selected papers will be published in the August 2021 issue of Kritika Kultura (ISSN: 1656-152x), an international peer-reviewed journal indexed in, among others, the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (Clarivate), EBSCO, and Scopus. Please submit a title and an abstract (200 to 250 words) together with a short bio (100 to 150 words) to rocio.ortuno@uantwerpen.be by February 15, 2020 (cc: kk.soh@ateneo.edu / subject heading: Spanish Literature).\n\nAbout the Forum Kritika on Spanish Literature on the Philippines\n\nIt has been 20 years since the publication of Facts in Fiction: A Study of Peninsular Prose Fiction (1998) by Lilian H. Chung. This landmark work generated high interest on the topic of Filipino-Spanish literary representations studied from a postcolonial point of view. Her book, often quoted in research on Philippine literature and history over the last years, has however not seen a solid continuation of its endeavour: although several monographic journal issues on Filipino literature in Spanish have been lately published1, none of them include any works on Peninsular Spanish literature on the Philippines. Furthermore, the volumes on Spanish colonial literature systematically overlook literature on the Philippines.\n\nThe reboot of Philippine-centred cultural production that has taken place recently in Spain and led to the remake of the film Los últimos de Filipinas (1945, 2018), the publication between 2001 and 2014 of at least 20 Spanish novels about the Philippines (Ortuño 2015), and the dedication of two episodes of the famous TV series El ministerio del tiempo to the Siege of Baler (2016), makes of this a perfect moment to revisit the topic of the representation of the Philippines from Spain. This monographic issue aims to approach new case studies of (Peninsular) Spanish written works about the Philippines from the 1870s to the 21st century and encourages an examination to the wide corpus available online thanks to different digitization efforts2. This should enable a dialogue between works on Philippine literature in Spanish, recent criticism on the evolving notion of hispanidad (Muñoz 2005), and historical criticism based on Spanish texts on the Philippines mainly of the end of the 19th century (Blanco 2011; Schmidt-Nowara 2008; Rodao 2018), which suggest similarities in the late Spanish colonial discourse with other European colonial discourses of the time.\n\nHow does the representation of the Philippines evolve along those 150 years? Are there any recurring tropes? Are works on the Philippines written by Spaniards related to any historical or political landmarks? How does the Spanish discourse about the Philippines converge with or diverge from the discourse about America? And with/from European colonial discourses from the end of the 19th century? These are some of the questions that we seek to explore in this special issue.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. Kritika Kultura published a monographic section on Philippine Literature in Spanish guest edited by Adam Lifshey in 2013, Transmodernity did the same in 2014 with an issue guest edited by Andrea Gallo, and Jorge Mojarro has recently guest edited two similar monographic issues for Revista de Critica Literaria Lationamericana in 2018 and Unitas in 2019.\n\n2. The database Filiteratura has gathered around 100 books on the Philippines as main topic written by Spanish authors, many of them accessible online on different platforms (Biblioteca Digital Hispánica, Digital Library of UST, among others).
