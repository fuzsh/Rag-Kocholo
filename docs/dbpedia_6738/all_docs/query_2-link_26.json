        "text": "Cesar Tiempo is the pen name of Israel Zeitlin, a naturalized Argentine born in the Ukraine in 1906. A Russian pogrom drove the Zeitlin family to Hamburg, and soon after, they set sail for America. When the ship reached New York there were difficulties about details of passport regulations that thwarted their hope of entering the United States, so the Zeitlins went on with the ship to Buenos Aires.\n\nThereby we lost a Jewish poet and Argentina gained a Jewish and a national poet. Israel Zeitlin would have been a Jewish poet in any land, but he has become, in Argentina, not only a poet of his people, but of his adopted country as well.\n\nJewish writers have played a very important part in 20th century Argentine literature, and it is noteworthy that this contribution to Argentine letters does not come from the Sephardic Jews, who have preserved for centuries the Judeo-Spanish cultural tradition. The Argentine group is of East-European descent, first-or second-generation immigrants, like Cesar Tiempo, who have come to the New World seeking refuge and freedom. Brought to Argentina at the beginning of the 20th century through the generosity of Baron Moses Hirsch of Austria, who purchased a great extent of territory in the Argentine province of Entre Rios, these Russian Jews grouped themselves in colonies in this and in other provinces, and soon made a valuable contribution to the economic life of their new country.\n\nAnd not only economic. In a remarkably short time some of these immigrants and their children became a part, and a leading part, of the literary life of Argentina, in spite of the handicaps of language and of cultural traditions so alien to those of their adopted land. Much of this assimilative tour de force was due to the genius of the writers themselves, but conditions in Argentina were peculiarly favorable to it.\n\nIt is unlikely that the same writers would have achieved a comparable leadership in Europe or the United States, despite their great talents and their eagerness to fuse their old and their new cultures. For it must be noted that the “assimilation” of this group of writers did not involve a rejection of their Jewish heritage. They were not interested in becoming Argentine instead of Jewish, but in adding Argentine qualities to their Jewishness, and in explaining their Jewishness to the Gentile world. Indeed, the work of these authors, and especially that of Cesar Tiempo, is deeply concerned with Jewish traditions and culture.\n\n_____________\n\nWhat are the factors that made this literary growth less difficult in Argentina than it would have been in Europe or in the United States? One was certainly economic. Argentina needed immigrants, especially agricultural workers, and she welcomed those who, like the Russian Jews, were good farmers. Established in colonies, they quickly won respect and friendship through their skill and industry. Twentieth-century Argentina, like the United States a half-century earlier, was a relatively empty land of opportunity, going through a tumultuous evolution. The balance of power was shifting from the feudal, cattle-raising aristocracy of the outlying provinces to the farmers of the provinces near Buenos Aires, and to the merchants and intellectuals of the capital. In this struggle all aid was welcome, and men of foreign birth and ancestry rose quickly to leadership, if they were able men. There was no xenophobia or anti-Semitism; the Jew-baiting that afflicts Argentina in recent years is part of the pseudo-Nazi movement by means of which the reactionary cattle-owning aristocracy hopes to regain its lost power.\n\nThe upheaval in Argentine economic life early in the century was paralleled by a revitalized and intensified literary activity. Spanish-American literature as a whole has been slow in maturing, to an even greater extent than in the United States. And the coming of age of Argentine literature was of even more recent date, so that foreign writers were on the scene as modem Argentine literature began to mature and expand. Having taken a full share in the development of other phases of national life, it was natural that they should participate fully in its cultural life as well. The Jewish writers, moreover, were impelled by a desire to explain themselves and their traditions to their fellow Argentines, and by a deep sense of gratitude toward the nation that had offered them a chance to live and grow as free men.\n\nThe outstanding figures of this Jewish flowering in Argentine literature are Alberto Gerchunoff, Samuel Glusberg, Samuel Eichelbaum, and Cesar Tiempo. Gerchunoff has perhaps the greatest prestige; through his editorial work in La Nación of Buenos Aires, one of the four or five great American newspapers; through his two collections of short stories, Los gauchos judíos (The Jewish Cowboys) and Cuentos de ayer (Tales of Yesterday); and through a series of critical and philosophical studies. Samuel Glusberg has done a great deal for the spread of Argentine literature with his publishing house, the Editorial Babel, and with his stories and novels, written under the pen name of Enrique Espinoza. Samuel Eichelbaum has written short stories and critical works, but his greatest fame comes to him through his plays, which have won him the unanimous praise of the critics and first place among the dramatists of Argentina, and perhaps of all Spanish America. An excellent study of his work by Theodore Apstein appeared in the summer 1945 Books Abroad.\n\n_____________\n\nAmong these authors and many others worthy of mention no one has worked with greater diligence and success than Cesar Tiempo. More than any other of them, he has made himself the interpreter, the defender, and the conscience of the Jews of Buenos Aires. As the publisher of the newspapers Crítica and El Sol, and the literary review Columna, Tiempo opened their pages to young Jewish writers, and he has fought for independence and sincerity, justifying the noble motto of his review: “Ready to make any sacrifice, save that of truth.” He did everything possible to fight the infamous anti-Semitic campaign promoted several years ago by Hugo Wast, a campaign and a promoter that at one time enjoyed the official support of the Argentine government, which gives, by this support and by the consequent persecutions, the definitive proof of its barbarity.\n\nIn his dramatic and poetic work Cesar Tiempo continues and strengthens his mission of Jewish champion and interpreter. Two plays of his have been produced, El teatro soy yo (I Am the Theater) and Pan criollo (American Bread), both high in artistic and even poetic value, treating Jewish themes with nobility and sincerity. But Tiempo is above all a poet, and in his poetry we can see most clearly his double mission of interpreter and champion.\n\nHis first book of poems, Versos de una . . . , was published in 1923 under the pseudonym of “Clara Baker.” The critics received it with praise, and then with amazement on discovering that its author was only seventeen. His second collection of poems, Libro para la pausa del sábado (A Book for the Sabbath Pause), won the First Municipal Prize for Poetry in 1930. Since then he has published two other collections: Sabatión argentino (Argentine Sabbatyon) in 1933, and Sábadomingo (Sabbath-Sunday) in 1938.\n\n_____________\n\nWhat are the main themes of Cesar Tiempo’s poetry? As an interpreter of his people, he speaks to us of the Jewish Sabbath, of family affection, of Jewish maidens, of life in the ghetto of Buenos Aires. As a defender and champion of the Jews, he speaks of pogroms, of the suffering of his ancestors; he makes us look upward to the greatness of the Jewish tradition, and punishes with the lash of his irony his brothers when they forget this greatness through their petty, and worldly concerns.\n\nHis principal theme is the Sabbath of pause and meditation, sacred day when the Jews, turning their eyes away from daily worries, forsake the bustle of the streets to withdraw into the synagogue and the home and, by the light of the seven-branched candelabra, contemplate the eternal glory of God. As we have seen, the titles of three of his volumes of poetry refer to this Sabbath pause: A Book for the Sabbath Pause, Sabbath-Sunday, and Argentine Sabbatyon. The latter refers to the legend of the River Sabbatyon, whose waters do not flow on the sacred day of rest. In a language filled with religious emotion, his poetry, like a psalm, sings of the sadness and yearning of the Jewish soul, filled with memories. In “Our Sabbath,” he says:\n\nOur Sabbath, channel of festive rest,\n\ncandelabra of flames crowded as my days\n\nguard your dark-windowed refuge\n\nlike a child in the night, alone and afraid. . . .\n\nand in “The Birth of the Sabbath”:\n\nSabbath of pause—Shabbat—of truce,\n\nof renewal—chadash—of new\n\nmoon—neomenia—for the joy\n\nof one who longs to seek refuge,\n\nfar from turmoil, in the mercy\n\nof active idleness, of sacred peace,\n\nand putting behind him dizziness and discord\n\nto love God and think of nothing.\n\nIn his “Hymn to Jewish Maidens,” he says:\n\nAgainst the phantom of war,\n\nwith a single, steady faith,\n\nlet us give to the earth a Sabbath.\n\nSabbath is peace. Sabbath is peace.\n\nAnd finally, he links the moon and the sun in his beautiful Sabbath “Prayer”:\n\nMoon, mother of the Sabbath, transfuse\n\nyour loving\n\ncalm, your pollen of peace, your wandering\n\nsoul into the wife that awaits\n\nthe son’s coming like a melodious\n\npaschal consecration of spring fruits.\n\nSunday, son of the sun, let your light not\n\nstrike her,\n\nyour alabandine light that knows no rest;\n\nlet the roar of the street become gentle music\n\nfor the son advancing\n\nwith the tremor of water seeking its shore.\n\nSabbath-Sunday, the child new as the dance\n\nthat dies and is reborn upon the stricken\n\nearth,\n\ncomes with its hope to seek your hope;\n\na Jewish mother brings it to you with her\n\nlove,\n\ngive her your brightness all the days of her\n\nlife.\n\nThe poet’s Sabbath meditations do not, however, exclude other interests, both Jewish and Argentine: a love of the street, a delight in complete and outward living, an infinite good humor, a tremendous capacity to react against the sadness and uncertainty of existence, interests that he has expressed in verses that overflow with the joy of living. So in his poem, “To Be Danced on Friday Evening”:\n\nFriday, bearing in your arms\n\nthe Sabbath like a bride,\n\n—Israel counts by evenings\n\nand anticipates the dawn—\n\npuff of blue cloud that loves the street\n\nlike the Hellene and the Jew,\n\npeoples of circles and dreams\n\nwith a living, present past;\n\nsilent peddlers go by,\n\nstray girls and dogs,\n\nunder the trees of night\n\nblind angels rest—\n\nthe trees, nature’s gallows,\n\nand candelabra, still cheerful,\n\nspout yellow lights\n\nupon the suicides of Friday.\n\nFriday of stumbling, wandering steps\n\nif your destiny is my destiny\n\nwhy after loving the Sabbath\n\ndo you love Sunday’s laughter?\n\nThe poor pass like instants,\n\naround the hearth are pictured\n\nlovers’ luck\n\nand needle’s weariness.\n\nFriday, bustling father,\n\nSaturday, festive wife,\n\nSunday, street-loving son\n\nand all around, the living life.\n\nThe living, living, living life\n\nununified and unrestricted,\n\nhurray, hurray, hurray for all,\n\nGod, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nand in “Sun Shower in the Ghetto”:\n\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\n\nlaughs the sun in the rain.\n\nBlond and festive sun\n\nover the Jewish quarter.\n\nHallelujah that unites\n\nSemite and Christian voices.\n\nThe tardy trolleys\n\nsing their bright colors.\n\nThe ghetto’s joy\n\nmakes a date in the sky.\n\nEvening preens itself\n\nin Jewish streets.\n\nGay, golden rain\n\nfor wordless love . . .\n\nGod pours over all\n\nhis fine, golden ash.\n\nGirl, give me your hand.\n\nLet us run and get wet.\n\nHallelujah! Hallelujahl\n\nlaughs the sun in the rain.\n\nThis poem is a good example of Tiempo’s humor, a humor frequent in his poetry, though often—and inevitably—tinged with irony, because of his themes. Thus, faced with a world that stubbornly refuses either to receive the Jews as compatriots or to give them the promised homeland, Cesar Tiempo writes his ‘“Israelite Cemetery”:\n\nDeaf to the hurly-burly of the street,\n\ndrowsy-content, free from delirium,\n\nface upward, with the down-curved noses,\n\nrest\n\nthese souls discharged from Jewry and its\n\ncares.\n\nAfter a crossing by paths without return\n\ntheir boats have come to mooring here at last;\n\nthey have made themselves these beds, this\n\nsprawling city,\n\nin the sure repose of everlasting sleep.\n\nThe moans of old women with their noisy\n\ngrief\n\ncannot disturb this smug and supine world\n\nwhere throb the rhythms of the whining\n\ndirge\n\nsung for a set price, with beatings of the\n\nbreast.\n\nHere the days dance their slowly-measured\n\nease,\n\nthe flowers’ resurrection confers its grace;\n\nthe schnorrer has taken title to the land,\n\nthe aristocrat his neighbor in the ground.\n\nAnd while the nights display their decora-\n\ntions\n\nabove this dwarfed city’s heavy calm,\n\nthe Semite flock sleeps without vain ambi-\n\ntion,\n\nassured that life will not begin tomorrow.\n\nIn the image of the dead Jews resting “face upward, with the down-curved noses” there is a fine example of Tiempo’s characteristic mixture of humor and tenderness. The irony of having to wait for death before becoming landowners and inhabiting the same element as the aristocracy is an irony heightened by the motto that Tiempo used for his poem—Lord Balfour’s “A National Home for the Jewish People.”\n\nHis anger against the oppressors of the Jews can become a lash turned against the Jews themselves when they are guilty of worldliness and ignorance. In his magnificent “Harangue on the Death of Hayim Nahman Bialik,” he contrasts the life and death of the great Hebrew poet with the indifference of the Jews of Buenos Aires to the grandeur of their inheritance:\n\nWhat other interest than that of the present moment can a people have which must drag itself through its shadows and abysses?\n\n—Bialik\n\nOn July 5th the Associated Press gave the\n\nnews to the world:\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik had died in Vienna,\n\nTwenty days later, and in the same city,\n\nthey put an end to Dollfuss, the “Milli-\n\nmetternich.”\n\nLook out for poets\n\nwhose fists pound on the desks of hangmen!\n\nThe world’s dailies\n\nmanaged to publish the item on the Society\n\nPage\n\nnext to the account of the party\n\nwith which the Barabanchik family\n\ncelebrated the circumcision of their off-\n\nspring.\n\nI have a violent heart\n\nand a harsh voice.\n\nI walk the streets of the Jewish Quarter\n\nweighed down by my anger and my grief.\n\nBrothers of Buenos Aires:\n\nour proudest poet is dead.\n\nAs in the Psalms,\n\nGod girded him with strength and made\n\nstraight his way.\n\nMinkowski was plaintive,\n\nBialik an imprecation.\n\nAnd both will rot under the earth,\n\nfacing the blind eyes of tremendous night.\n\nA shirtsleeve sky runs over the roofs.\n\nThe pedlars in the Pilsen are at their end-\n\nless game of dominoes.\n\nGirls who want to get married don’t walk\n\nunder scaffolding.\n\nYou bourgeois who break all the Com-\n\nmandments\n\nand spend your Sabbaths over your black-\n\nbound ledgers,\n\nstroking the spines of the figures\n\nto make them stretch out like cats,\n\nI have seen you in your glittering temples—\n\nranged like thoroughbreds in sumptuous\n\nstalls—\n\nwith your round lifeless little eyes,\n\nwith your formal top hats and your pure\n\nsilk prayer-shawls,\n\ntrying to bribe God\n\nwho knows you better than your employees.\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik is dead.\n\nThere’s gefillte fish today in ‘The Inter-\n\nnational,’\n\nand a good stock of doctors for your poor\n\ndrooping daughters.\n\nWho remembers the massacres in the\n\nUkraine,\n\nthe raving storm of the pogroms,\n\nwhen hooligans raped your mothers\n\nand you stayed trembling in your cellars,\n\nuseless\n\nas a ray of light striking a mirror?\n\nBialik shouted, he thundered across the\n\nblack waters,\n\nand his angry laughter ran through the\n\nvillages like a wild wind.\n\n‘The people are a withered grass,\n\nlifeless as dry timber.’\n\nAnd there were youths who shook them-\n\nselves like wolf cubs\n\nand their sharp teeth tore our shame to\n\nshreds.\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik is dead.\n\nThe old-clothes dealers smile in the door-\n\nways of their pandemoniums.\n\nThe Lacroze trolleys are greener than ever.\n\nCast thy bread upon the waters, says\n\nEcclesiastes.\n\nHow nice to hear Mischa Elman from a\n\nsoft orchestra seat at the Colón.\n\nGorki said that with Bialik the Jewish race\n\nhad given a new Homer to the world.\n\nWould the Bank of Israel accept his sig-\n\nnature?\n\nVoices:\n\n‘Tonight when the store’s closed and I’m\n\ndunking my toast in a glass of tea,\n\nI’m going to ask the wife to read me\n\nThe Bird and The Garden, and after\n\nsupper we’re going to the Ombú Theater:\n\nif you want to get on the Committee,\n\nyou’ve got to keep up with things.’\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik is dead.\n\n‘Ma, can I wash my hair with kerosene and\n\nput on my sky-blue dress to go to\n\nthe Library?’—‘All right, darling, and see\n\nif you can get yourself a young man,\n\nlike the rest of the girls: it’s about time.’\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik is dead.\n\nAt the door of the People’s Kitchen our\n\nbrothers, the ones who haven’t the\n\ncourage to starve to death, are waiting\n\nfor their ration.\n\nHayim Nahman Bialik is dead.\n\nOur legs drag through the deepest marshes\n\nof night and above our heads a pure\n\nlight shines.\n\nIn Tel-Aviv there was a poet.\n\nAnd now?\n\n_____________\n\nCesar Tiempo’s poetry is very Hebraic in spirit. He has the qualities that appear in the work of the great Hebrew poets: irony, humor, sentiment, pity, an interest in man and in the reality of his existence, all expressed with a pure, free lyricism. And at the same time, this Hebraic poetry of Cesar Tiempo proves to be very true to Spanish tradition in its form. There is in his songs an infectious choral gaiety and in his psalms the solemnity and the peacefulness of medieval plainchant. Very Spanish are his humor and tenderness that often become bitterness and sarcasm. He has a thoroughly Spanish stoicism that can accept the hazards of life and view with equanimity the deepest anguish. Very Spanish, too, is his love for the precise, concrete image, and that poetic fantasy that couples dissimilar and improbable elements in bold and striking metaphors, as in, these descriptive verses: “The roofs hoist flags of smoke,” “The cold sharpens its knife on the wind,” “Friday of fog. The dawn has a handkerchief in each hand,” “The night has its back to the sky,” “Sunday nervously loosens its tie, and the shadow of an indifferent Monday advances.” Speaking of a deaf-mute painter:\n\nYour hands learned the purest language,\n\ntranslating into pictures your wordless grief,\n\nas the clouds tell their pluvial\n\nsorrow with simple water pictures.\n\nAt this uncertain hour, in a world filled with hatred and distrust, it is good to listen to the voice of this Jewish poet who, knowing that to understand is to forgive, devotes himself to banishing the errors and deceits that nourish intolerance. Argentina, and America, North and South, need such voices, now more than ever.\n\nAnd despite the incredible horrors and injustices that have been, and are still being committed against the Jews, Cesar Tiempo gives to his Jewish brothers, and to the whole world, a note of hope in the last poem of his book Sabbath-Sunday, a poem entitled “Weeping and Singing,” which bears this motto from the Psalms: “They that sow in tears shall reap in joy”:\n\nFrom a land of milk and honey,\n\nfrom hills and rivers clear,\n\nthe people of Israel went forth,\n\nweeping.\n\nPillars of fire and cloud\n\nwent on before their steps\n\nand Israel crossed the desert,\n\nweeping.\n\nThe captives lifted up their\n\ncities of mighty walls\n\nand they gave thanks to God,\n\nweeping.\n\nTheir lances became harrows,\n\ntheir swords were turned to plows,\n\nnight and day they labored,\n\nweeping.\n\nThe sea of fiery water\n\nthey crossed over with their horses,\n\nthe tempest fell upon them,\n\nweeping.\n\nThey were walled about\n\nin the shadow of the ghettos\n\nbut they found out the light,\n\nweeping.\n\nThe Sabbath was their buckler,\n\ntheir isle, their candelabrum,\n\nand they called the Sabbath holy,\n\nweeping.\n\nTaunted and spat upon,\n\nbent low above the earth,\n\nthey sow without hate or rest,\n\nweeping.\n\nTomorrow the sun will smile\n\nupon the seed-rich fields\n\nand then, then we shall reap,\n\nsinging, brothers, singing."
