In order to understand the importance of this technology, teachers must first recognize that computers and software cannot work magic on their own. The real challenge for foreign language teachers lies in defining why we want students to write with Atajo and how we teach them to use the software.\n\nWhy Write with Atajo?\n\nThe first step in explaining why Atajo is a valid and useful tool involves realizing that Atajo is not a replacement for traditional methods of teaching writing, but instead an addition. The simple fact is that we live in the computer age, and word processing is a preferred writing tool for many students. Moreover, there are obvious advantages for the teacher: student work is typed and legible, editing and rewriting are made easier, and students make a greater commitment to a writing task if they must go to a computer to write rather than jot something down right before class.\n\nOn a more theoretical level, Atajo's provides a rich learning environment in which students can explore the writing process from an early stage in their study of Spanish. It is a unique writing tool that lends itself to a systematic developmental writing program; there are resources in the database for students at elementary, intermediate, and more advanced levels of Spanish study. Furthermore, Atajo's helps students develop critical thinking skills: they learn to read, analyze and choose appropriate items from information screens; to see word associations; and to understand the link between language functions and linguistic structures. Finally, when students use Atajo's to request information and then use that information in their writing task, they build a bridge between \"skill getting\" and \"skill using\" (Rivers, 4-5).\n\nHow to Teach Students to Write with Atajo\n\nThe key to teaching students to write successfully lies primarily in providing a forum for relevant personal expression. Chapter 1 begins with a task-oriented guided tutorial designed to engage students in a writing activity while also familiarizing them with the resources of Atajo. After the tutorial ends, we discuss the implementation of a developmental writing program. Using task-oriented exercises with Atajo, students learn to manipulate grammar, vocabulary, and phrases, so that they gradually progress toward autonomous writing. By the end of the first semester of high school or college Spanish, students can carry out extended guided writing tasks. After about five semesters of Spanish study and practice using Atajo, students are adept at finding and accessing the linguistic information they need to express themselves and are ready to write in unguided autonomous writing activities.\n\nAnother dimension to teaching students to write in a foreign language involves analyzing how individual students undertake a given writing task. In Chapter 2 we discuss in detail how to analyze student writing samples at different stages of writing development. In addition, we explain how the Atajo tracking device (log) allows teachers to see concrete evidence of many factors that make up the whole writing process: the length of time the student worked on a given task; the nature and frequency of Dictionary, Grammar, Vocabulary, and Phrases inquiries; how and when the student checked for notes, examples, or verb conjugations. We describe how the tracking device gives teachers a tool for analyzing individual writing problems while also providing insight into effective and ineffective language-learning strategies.\n\nA final step in teaching students to write in a foreign language involves evaluating their written work. A student ultimately becomes a better writer when given helpful feedback related to both the content and the form of the message. In Chapter 3 we discuss how task-oriented exercises with Atajo are ideally suited to both holistic and analytical scoring techniques.\n\nCHAPTER 1: Teaching Students to Write with Atajo\n\nFor students who already have experience using any word-processing program, Atajo is very easy to use because some of its basic functionalities are common to other programs. Even students who have not done much word-processing, however, will find that the program is easy to master. It is important, however, to have a well organized orientation session to Atajo. An orientation to the program ensures students' success with the software. Typically, it takes students about 20 minutes to learn how Atajo works and what it can offer. Becoming adept and creative with the program requires about four hours of work, or about two 400-word compositions.\n\nTo prepare for your tour, you must start Atajo.\n\nLocate the Atajo folder and click on the book icon. The title screen should appear, and when you click on OK, the program will open. You are now ready to begin the tour.\n\nAtajo begins with a window that fills the top half the screen; this is where you write and edit your work. There is also a small tool bar along the upper right side of the screen; this is the Navigator. The Navigator consists of the tools available to you in the Atajo program. The area at the bottom is where the Dictionary will open up.\n\nBROWSING IN THE DICTIONARY\n\nClick on the Dictionary icon in the Navigator to open the bilingual Dictionary.\n\nClick in the radio button next to the word \"English\" in the lower left corner of the Dictionary to move the search function to English; the language to be searched will be in the left column in the Dictionary.\n\nClick on the compass icon labeled Find to access the Search feature. Type \"talk\" in the box under the \"Search the Dictionary For:\" command line. Make sure that the English radio button is selected. Click on the Find button. The computer finds several entries, one of which is hablar.\n\nTo take a look at the information pertaining to hablar, highlight the word hablar and then click the Expand icon located in the box in the lower right corner of the Dictionary (a shortcut: double-click on the word hablar to expand the information). The information includes a definition in Spanish and examples of how the word hablar is used in Spanish. (Note: if at any time you wish to make any window full screen, click on the small box in the upper right corner of that window. This is a standard Macintosh function.)\n\nTo return to the Dictionary, select the \"Entire Dictionary\" radio button under \"Display:\" at the bottom center of the screen. To return to the Editor, click anywhere on the Editor screen or click on the Editor icon in the Navigator.\n\nFrom the Dictionary window, choose Spanish as the lookup language by selecting the Spanish radio button. Click on the Find icon and look up corazón. Since you do not know how to type accents yet, typing corazon will cause the computer to ask if you want to find the closest match. Select YES and the computer finds corazón. Expand the information to see the word used in a sentence. Return to the entire Dictionary.\n\nLook up the Spanish word ordenador. When you click on Expand, you are instructed to see Note.\n\nClick on the Reference icon in the bottom right of the Dictionary window. The program opens up a new window that shows a Vocabulary entry for ordenador, a vocabulary list of computer terminology. You can scroll through the list using the scroll bar on the right side of the Reference window. There are five screens of vocabulary associated with computing. The last screen contains verbs commonly used in this context. Close the Reference window by clicking on the small box in the upper left corner of the Reference window.\n\nClick on the Find icon and type buscar. When the program finds the verb, expand the information. Note that buscar has only one example associated with it. Since it is a verb, the program tells you whether it is used with an indirect or a direct object in the sample sentence. Click on the Collapse icon (this is what the Expand icon becomes once you have expanded the information) to close the examples.\n\nNotice that the Conjugate icon in the lower right hand corner of the Dictionary window is illuminated. Click on this icon to open a Verb Summary screen for the verb buscar. In the center of the screen you will see the Present tense. On the left side are the conjugations formed on the infinitive. On the right side you will find the compound tenses that use the past participle. Only third-person forms are shown in this summary screen (second-person for the Imperative). Most of the time this will be sufficient to jog your memory into remembering the other forms.\n\nTo expand a tense, move the mouse pointer over the different tense names. Notice that the pointer changes to a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass indicates that you are pointed at an area that can be expanded to reveal more information on the selected tense. Click on Imperfecto to see the full conjugation which appears at the bottom of the Conjugation window. To see the full conjugation of other tenses, simply click on them. Close the Conjugation window when you have finished with it.\n\nSelect Dictionary. Experiment with browsing up and down in the Dictionary using the scroll bar. If you see a Dictionary item that interests you, simply click on it to select it.\n\nBROWSING IN ATAJO GRAMMAR, PHRASES, AND VOCABULARY DATABASES\n\nClick on the Reference icon in the Navigator toolbar in the upper right corner of the screen. This opens the Atajo Reference containing Grammar, Phrases, and Vocabulary resources.\n\nAt the bottom of the Reference window, there are two radio buttons: \"Notes about [last topic viewed]\" and \"Browse:\". Click on the \"Browse:\" radio button. Notice that the boxes next to the three reference categories are marked with an \"X\". This means that all three categories are activated in the scrolling window.\n\nRemove the X's from Vocabulary and Phrases so that just the Grammar is available. Scroll through the list to view the topics included. Double click on an item to select it.\n\nClick on the Find icon in the Navigator and search for the Spanish word que. A list appears with all the material on que that the search program has found in the Grammar. Double click on a topic in the list to read the notes.\n\nExperiment with selecting other items in Phrases and Vocabulary. Put an \"X\" in the box next to these categories to include them in the scrolling window. When they are all selected, the categories appear in alphabetical order so that all the Grammar entries appear first, then the Phrases, Vocabulary.\n\nClick on the Find icon and type \"body\" to see the Vocabulary entries related to the body. Remember to scroll through the window to see all of the information. Select some topics from all the listing retrieved for \"body\" and read the information.\n\nNotice that once you open a Grammar, Phrases, or Vocabulary window you can go the any of the others using the Find feature. With the information for \"body\" still open, use Find to search for \"congratulating\" to see the type of information provided in Phrases.\n\nBEGINNING TO WRITE\n\nInsert your personal diskette in the appropriate drive.\n\nTo save your file to your floppy disk, select File/Save \"Untitled\" As: from the main menu bar. When the save window appears, click on Desktop and choose the name of your personal diskette from the list.\n\nType the name of your document in the space highlighted beneath Save File As:. Once you have titled your document, click on Save.\n\nBegin to write by typing \"Hola. Me llamo (your name).\" Use the arrow keys and the delete key to move around and edit your text. Notice that Atajo is similar to most word processing programs.\n\nSuppose you want to type \" Tengo veintidós años.\" To find out how to type accent marks and special characters, select Window and then Help from the main menu bar at the top of the screen. The information of typing accents is found within the Editor topic under Help. If you are already familiar with using accented characters in other Macintosh software, then you will notice that the same keystrokes apply in Atajo.\n\nHold down the option key and type the e. Nothing will appear on the screen when you release the option key; now type o, and you will see appear an accented o (ó). The option-e + vowel combination will give you all the acute-accented vowels, the only accent mark used in Spanish to indicate stress. Experiment with the other vowels.\n\nTo type the ñ, hold down the option key and type n. Nothing appears on the screen at this point. Then release the option key and type another n. Click on the Reference icon and then click on the Find icon. Search for \"personality\". Read all the information.\n\nIf you need to refresh your memory about the uses of ser and estar, select the appropriate screens from the Grammar, then return to the Editor.\n\nType \"Normalmente soy un hombre/una mujer (adjective) y (adjective) pero a veces soy (adjective).\"\n\nNow transfer this text into a short letter to an imaginary pen pal in Mexico. Choose a name for your pen pal.\n\nSearch the Phrases index for \"writing a letter (informal)\". (You can simply type \"writing\". The program will access all entries the include \"writing\" in the listing. Select the right one.) Read through the information and then write an appropriate beginning for your letter. (Remember click on either the Editor window or the Editor icon each time you want to continue writing.)\n\nIf you don't remember how to end the letter, click on the \"writing\" note to reactivate it, find an appropriate closing for your letter, and return to the Editor to type it in.\n\nAdd a few more sentences and perhaps some questions. You may need to use the Dictionary to look up additional vocabulary or verb conjugations. You may also want to use the Grammar index or the Vocabulary index for ideas.\n\nWhen you have finished your letter, remember to save your document as you did at the beginning of the tour.\n\nMake sure the printer is turned on and loaded with paper. Select File/Print from the menu bar to print your letter.\n\nTo exit Atajo, select File/Quit from the menu bar.\n\nRECAPPING THE TOUR\n\nThe main selections for accessing information in Atajo are:\n\nDictionary\n\nReference\n\nPhrases\n\nGrammar\n\nVocabulary\n\nSecondary sources of information found in the Dictionary are:\n\nExamples\n\nConjugations&uuencoded.document;\n\nNotes\n\nFor information on program features, select Window/Help from the main menu bar.\n\nTo prepare for your tour, you must start Atajo.\n\nIf you installed Atajo on your C: drive in a subdirectory called Atajo, for example, first make sure you are in that drive and directory.\n\nC: [ ]\n\nCD \\ATAJO [ ]\n\nThen, at the prompt, type \"ATAJO\" and press the Enter key:\n\nATAJO [ ]\n\nThe title screen should appear followed by the program. You are now ready to begin the tour.\n\nAtajo divides the screen into two windows. The top window is where you write and edit your work. The bottom window contains the Dictionary and information screens.\n\nBROWSING IN THE DICTIONARY\n\nSelect Dictionary from the Atajo menu in the Editor menu bar to open the bilingual Dictionary. Now select Flip from the Dictionary menu bar to move the lookup function to English; the language to be searched will be in the left Dictionary column.\n\nSelect Lookup. Type \"speak\" in the English Lookup box, and select OK. The computer finds several entries, one of which is hablar. Select OK again. On the right-hand side is the Spanish equivalent: hablar. To see how this word is used in a sentence, select Example on the menu bar or press and hold down ALT and type X [Alt - x]. The Dictionary is replaced with a screen that contains examples of how the word hablar is used in Spanish. To return to the Dictionary, select Windows on the menu bar and then select Dictionary. (To return to the Editor window, select Editor.)\n\nFrom the Dictionary window, select Flip to choose Spanish as the lookup language and look up corazón. Since you do not know how to type accents yet, typing corazon will cause the computer to ask if you want to do an Extended Search to find the nearest match. Select YES and the computer finds corazón. Select Examples to see the word used in a sentence. Return to the Dictionary.\n\nLook up the Spanish word ordenador. Notice that Examples in the menu bar is totally gray. This means that there is no example associated with ordenador. However, Note is active. Select Note. The program takes you to the Vocabulary screens that are associated with ordenador. Here you find a vocabulary list of computer terminology. You can go through all of the screens by using the PgDn and PgUp keys. There are a total of five screens of vocabulary associated with computing. The last screen contains verbs commonly used in this context. Select Windows/Dictionary to return to the Dictionary window.\n\nSelect Lookup and type buscar. When the program finds the verb, select Examples. Note that buscar has only one example associated with it. Since it is a verb, the program tells you whether it is used with an indirect or a direct object in the sample sentence. Select Cancel to close the Examples screen and return to the Dictionary. Notice that Conjugate is active in the menu bar. Select Conjugate to open a Verb Summary screen for the verb buscar. In the center of the screen you will see the Present tense. On the left side are the conjugations formed on the infinitive. On the right side you will find the compound tenses that use the past participle. Only third-person forms are shown in this summary screen (second-person for the Imperative). Most of the time this will be sufficient to jog your memory into remembering the other forms. To expand a tense, select Tenses in the menu bar. A dropdown menu appears. Select Imperfecto to see the full conjugation. To change to other tenses select Tenses again. To view the reflexive form of the verb select Reflexive in the menu bar.\n\nSelect Dictionary. Experiment with browsing up and down in the Dictionary by using the up and down arrow keys [ ] as well as the PgUp and PgDn keys. You may also browse in me Dictionary by clicking the mouse on the up and down symbols on the scrollbar [ ]. If you see a Dictionary item not highlighted, simply click on it to select it.\n\nSelect Help from the Dictionary menu bar and look at the material found there. When you finish, select Help from the Editor menu and do the same; note that Help is context-sensitive.\n\nBROWSING IN ATAJO GRAMMAR, PHRASES, AND VOCABULARY DATABASES\n\nSelect Atajo from the Editor menu bar to open the dropdown menu containing Dictionary, Grammar, Phrases, Vocabulary. Select Grammar, and note that you can scroll through the Grammar index window with , PgUp and PgDn, and the scrollbar. Click on an item to select it.\n\nSelect Lookup and enter the Spanish word que. A second window opens with all of the material on que that the search program has found under G(rammar):\n\nSelect OK or double click to read a highlighted topic.\n\nExperiment with selecting other items in the menu bar. For example, click on Atajo's/Vocabulary. (This means that the item that follows Atajo/ is in a dropdown menu.) Scroll through the list to see the contents. Select Lookup, type \"body\" and select OK to see vocabulary related to the body. Scroll or page down to see more screens on this topic.\n\nNotice that once you open a Grammar, Phrases, or Vocabulary window you can go to any of the others from its menu bar. From an open Vocabulary note select Phrases; when the index opens, select Lookup and type \"congratulating.\" Select OK to see the notes.\n\nBEGINNING TO WRITE\n\nInsert your personal diskette in the appropriate drive. To save your file to a local drive (A: or B:), select File/Save As. In the dialogue box, type the letter of the drive containing your personal diskette followed by a colon and the name you want to assign to your file. (Your file name may be up to eight letters long.) Then select OK.\n\nBegin to write by typing \"Hola. Me llamo (your name).\" Use the arrow keys, the backspace key, and the delete key to move around and edit your text. Notice that Atajo is similar to most word processing programs.\n\nType \"Tengo veintidós años\" without the accent mark or the tilde over the n. To find out how to type accent marks and special characters, select Help/Accents in the Editor menu bar. Study the Help screen then close it. Place the cursor in front of the o in veintidos and press the delete key [Del] to erase it. Then press the forward slash key [/]. Note that an apostrophe ['] appears on the screen in reverse highlight. Now type the letter o. The apostrophe is replaced with an accented o (ó). The forward slash + vowel combination will give you all of the accented vowels. The backslash should remind you of the acute accent, the only accent mark used in Spanish to indicate stress. Experiment with the other vowels. To type the ñ type the tilde character [~] and then type n. (Appendix D contains a list of all the accents and special characters, and the key combinations used to type them.)\n\nSelect Atajo's/Vocabulary from the menu bar to open the Vocabulary selection index. Scroll to \"personality\" or select Lookup and type \"personality.\" Select OK or press Enter [ø] to access the information screens. Read all the screens (move back and forth between screens with PgDn/PgUp). If you need to refresh your memory about the uses of ser and estar, select the appropriate screens from the Atajo's/Grammar index, then return to the Editor. Type \"Normalmente soy un hombre (adjective) y (adjective) pero a veces soy (adjective).\"\n\nNow transform this text into a short letter to an imaginary pen pal in Mexico. Choose a name for your pen pal. Select Atajo's/Phrases/Lookup. Type \"writing a letter (informal).\" (You can reduce the typing to \"writing.\" The program will take you to the start of all entries that begin with \"writing.\" Make sure the right one is highlighted.) Select OK to access the information screens. Read all the screens and then write an appropriate beginning for your letter. (Remember to select Windows/Editor or click the mouse on the editing window each time you want to continue writing.) If you don't remember how to end the letter, click on the \"writing\" note to reactivate it, find an appropriate closing for your letter, and return to the Editor to type it in.\n\nAdd a few more sentences and perhaps some questions. You may need to use the Dictionary to look up additional vocabulary or verb conjugations. You may also want to use the Grammar index or the Vocabulary index for ideas.\n\nWhen you have finished your letter, select File/Save (or File/Save As) from the menu bar.\n\nMake sure the printer is turned on and loaded with paper. Select File/Print from the menu bar to print your letter. You may want to select Printer Settings to change from single to double spacing.\n\nTo exit Atajo's, select File/Exit from the menu bar.\n\nRECAPPING THE TOUR\n\nAs you review the points listed below, you may want to consult the diagrams opposite, which are included to help you visualize how the software works.\n\nThe main selections for accessing information under Atajo are:\n\nDictionary\n\nPhrases\n\nGrammar\n\nVocabulary\n\nSecondary sources of information found in the Dictionary are:\n\nExamples\n\nNotes\n\nConjugations\n\nFor information on program features, select Help from the menu bar. You may also print out a file called HELP.HLP from the Atajo Editor.\n\nWhile students can do the following tutorial without teacher guidance, we recommend that teachers play an active role in orienting students to the software. Our experience suggests that students need to see from the start that learning to write in Spanish with Atajo is a partnership effort.\n\nFirst show or discuss with the students how the program works. Then click on the Atajo icon to open the program.\n\nDo not teach students how to open, save, and print files until they have seen what Atajo can do; you will need their attention and enthusiasm for the guided tutorial. Allow at least one hour for the two phases of the tutorial.\n\nPhase 1 of the Guided Tutorial Before beginning to write, students need to see what Atajo can offer. In order to reassure students that it is easy to use the software, show students how to search the Atajo databases and gather information. (See \"Browsing in Atajo.\")\n\nPhase 2 of the Guided Tutorial After the first phase of the tutorial is completed, students should have a good idea of what Atajo can offer them as they write in Spanish. In the second phase of the tutorial, guide students through the mechanics of starting Atajo, beginning to write, saving their work, and printing. (See \"Beginning to Write.\")\n\nRECAPPING THE TOUR\n\nAs you review the points listed below, you may want to consult the diagrams opposite, which are included to help you visualize how the software works. Introduce students to the Help option on the Menubar and the Toolbar, and to the context-sensitive Help in the Statusbar. Finally, tell them, if they do not already know, that they can exit. the program in two ways. They can select Exit in the File Menu or they can double-click on the Quit icon in the upper left-hand corner of Atajo.\n\nIn fact, you might wish to remind them that they can close any window, or any Mac program, by double-clicking on that spot.\n\nBROWSING IN THE DICTIONARY\n\nSelect Dictionary from the Reference Menubar or click on the Open Book button. The Dictionary always opens with the word \"atajo\" highlighted.\n\nClick on the Flip button to shift between Spanish and English.\n\nSelect Search from the Dictionary option or click on the Magnifying Glass button. When the Search window opens, show students how to set the parameters of the search. Type \"comenzar\" in the Search window and press the Enter key or click on the Search button.\n\nDouble-click on one of the two items in the Search Results box or select one and click on the OK button to go to the Dictionary entry:\n\nNote that there is an asterisk next to \"comenzar.\" This is a visual cue that indicates that there is additional information about this verb that can be accessed through the Reference Menubar or the Reference Toolbar, which now shows two buttons active that were grayed-out before, the Conjugate button and the Examples button.\n\nChoose Conjugate in the Reference Menu or click the Conjugate button to open the Conjugation window and see how the verb is conjugated.\n\nThe top of the window displays the infinitive, the gerund, and the participle of \"comenzar.\" Below are the conjugations. Tell the students that each conjugation shows the 3rd person singular of the verb with the exception of the imperative, which shows the 2nd person singular command. Often this mnemonic will be sufficient to recall the conjugation paradigm. If it is not, point out that the present tense is highlighted to indicate that the conjugation is expanded at the bottom of the screen. If you click on any of the conjugation names, that tense will be similarly expanded at the bottom of the screen.\n\nClick on the Examples button to see some usage examples:\n\nClick on the Magnifying Glass button again to look up the Spanish word \"ordenador.\" Notice that the Examples button in the Menubar is totally gray. This means that there is no example associated with \"ordenador.\" However, Note is active.\n\nSelect Note.\n\nThe program takes you to the Vocabulary screens that are associated with \"ordenador.\"\n\nThis screen contains a vocabulary list of computer terminology. You can go through all of it by using the page down (PgDn) and page up (PgUp) keys. There are a total of five screens of vocabulary associated with computing. The last screen contains verbs commonly used in this context. Double-click on the upper-left-hand corner of the Vocabulary window to dismiss it.\n\nExperiment with browsing up and down in the Dictionary by using the up and down arrow keys [*] as well as Pgup and PgDn. You may also browse in the Dictionary by clicking the mouse on the Up and Down symbols on the scrollbar. If you see a Dictionary item you want to examine, click on it to select it.\n\nSelect Help from the Reference Menubar and look at the material found there.\n\nBROWSING IN ATAJO GRAMMAR, PHRASES, AND VOCABULARY DATABASES\n\nSelect Note Index in the Reference Menu or click on the Closed Books icon.\n\nEnter the Spanish word \"que\" and click the Search button.:\n\nSelect OK or double-click to read a highlighted topic. The program will open a text window with information on the selected topic. You may repeat your searches and open as many Note windows as you need. (See: Managing the Atajo Screen.)\n\nThree databases (Grammar, Phrases, and Vocabulary) can be searched at will by checking the appropriate box in the Note Index Options.\n\nRepeat the process to show some of the functional Phrases notes.\n\nMANAGING THE ATAJO SCREEN\n\nIn addition to the Dictionary and whatever composition text files you are working on, you may open as many Note windows as you need. However, only one window at a time has the focus of the program. To shift the focus between windows, click on the window you wish to work on. Even if you have opened several windows and your screen is getting cluttered, Atajo gives you several ways in which you can bring order out of chaos.\n\nYou can select Cascade in the Window Menu:\n\nBut Tile in the Window Menu allows you to see more information on the screen:\n\nHowever, a good way of not ending up with a cluttered screen is to iconize your windows so that you have a clean screen to work on, yet the information you searched for is easily available. All Atajo windows may be iconized by clicking on the inverted triangle on the top right-hand corner of the window:\n\nIconized Composition Window\n\nIconized Example Window\n\nIconized Dictionary Window\n\nIconized Conjugation Window\n\nIconized Note Window\n\nIconized Key Into Window\n\nThis example shows a screen with a number of iconized windows containing the information that resulted from the student's search of the database. There are two text files, comp1.rtf and notes.rtf. The student is working between the two files. One contains notes that will be eventually used in the composition. The other contains the text of the composition.\n\nImportant: There can be database search delays on some networks, particularly when a lot of users are trying to access the server at the same time. These delays can break a student's concentration. It is therefore important that students search the databases to gather their materials before they actually begin to write.\n\nBEGINNING TO WRITE\n\nAtajo saves its composition files to the A: (default) or B: drives. In most computers the default drive is the A drive. In some, it might be the B: drive. You must therefore insert a diskette into whichever drive is designated as the default drive to which the program will write its text files. To begin Atajo:\n\nClick on the Atajo icon.\n\nSelect New from the File option on the Menubar or click on the New File button to open a file.\n\nSelect Save As from the File option on the Menubar or click on the Save button to save the opened file. The Save File As dialog window opens. Place the cursor in the File Name box and replace \"*.rtf\" with \"comp1.rtf:\"\n\nYour file has now been saved and the file window name has changed from \"Untitled1\" to \"Comp1.\"\n\nSelect Options on the Menubar to set the Autosave feature. We recommend saving every 5 minutes at first. Atajo will automatically save your file every 5 minutes though you can still click on the Save button whenever you wish. Once you are comfortable with the program, you might set the interval at every 10 minutes.\n\nBegin to write by typing \"Hola. Me llamo (your name).\" Use the arrow keys, the backspace key, and the delete key to move around and edit your text. Notice that Atajo is similar to most word processing programs.\n\nType \"Tengo veintidós años.\" without the accent mark or the tilde over the n. To find out how to type accent marks and special characters select Help/Accents in the Editor Menubar. Study the Help screen, then close it. Place the cursor in front of the \"o\" in \"veintidos\" and press the delete key [Del] to erase it. Then press the forward slash key [/]. Note that an apostrophe [ ' ] appears on the screen in reverse highlight. Now type the letter \"o.\" The apostrophe is replaced with an accented o (ó). The forward slash + vowel combination will give you all of the accented vowels. The backslash should remind you of the acute accent, the only accent mark used in Spanish to indicate stress. Experiment with the other vowels. To type the \"ñ\" type the tilde character [~] and then type \"n.\" (Appendix D contains a list of all the accents and special characters, and the key combinations used to type them.)\n\nClick on the Notes Index button to open the Search Dialogue Window. Scroll down through the selection list to \"personality\" or type \"personality\" in the Search entry box.\n\nClick on OK to open the Note window with the information you desire. Read all the screens (move up and down by clicking on the sidebar or pressing PgDn/PgUp). If you need to refresh your memory about the uses of \"ser\" and \"estar,\" click on box next to Grammar in the Index Options list.\n\nIconize the note on personality or move it to the side or bottom of the screen. Click on your composition file to reactivate it and type: \"Normalmente soy un hombre (adjective) y (adjective) pero a veces soy (ad jective).\"\n\nNow transform this text into a short letter to an imaginary pen pal in Mexico. Choose a name for your pen pal.\n\nClick on the Note Index button again. Type \"writing a letter (informal)\" in the Search index box. (You can reduce the typing to \"writing.\" The program will take you to the start of all entries that begin with \"writing.\" Make sure the right one is highlighted.) Select OK or double-click on the highlighted option to access the information screens. Read all the screens and then iconize or close the note and click on your composition file to reactivate it. Write an appropriate beginning for your letter. If you don't remember how to end the letter, click on the \"writing\" note to reactivate it, find an appropriate closing for your letter, and return to your file to type it in.\n\nAdd a few more sentences and perhaps some questions. You may need to use the Dictionary to look up additional vocabulary or verb conjugations. You may also want to search the Grammar or the Vocabulary indexes for ideas.\n\nWhen you have finished your letter, select File/Save (or File/Save As) from the Menubar.\n\nMake sure the printer is turned on and loaded with paper. Select File/Print from the menu bar to print your letter. You may want to select Paragraph to change from single to double spacing or to Page Layout to reset margins.\n\nTo exit Atajo, select File/Exit from the Menubar.\n\nSpeakers of English who think that for every English word there is a corresponding Spanish word and who think, therefore, that writing in Spanish is a matter of translating English sentences word for word into Spanish--what we might call a naive lexical hypothesis--will likely complain that any bilingual dictionary is too limited when they do not find an exact match. This is not so.\n\nOften there is a direct equivalence between Spanish and English; sometimes usage determines which of several Spanish equivalents best conveys the meaning of a given English word or expression; sometimes grammar is the key. Users who are successful at self-directed inquiry using Atajo (or any other dictionary resource for that marter) employ a variety of strategies to express themselves within the limits of their vocabulary or knowledge of the grammar. The list of strategies that follows should get you off to a good start.\n\nAdd Context.\n\nClick on the Dictionary Search icon (the Magnifying Glass) and enter \"time.\" Check the English lookuv box. Scroll through a few of the entries.\n\nNow look up \"it's about time\" to see the Spanish equivalent.\n\nParaphrase.\n\nEnter \"lessen\" in the English lookup to see the NOTHING FOUND IN SPANISH message.\n\nTry to think of an equivalent word in English. Enter \"diminish\" to see what happens.\n\nCheck Sub-entries.\n\nClick on the Dictionary Search icon (the Magnifying Glass) and enter \"go.\" Check the English lookup box.\n\nDouble click on \"ir\" or click on OK.\n\nYou cannot see the subentries for the Spanish word, so select flip to be able to scroll through the additional information.\n\nCheck the Examples.\n\nThis is particularly useful for verbs. Click on the Dictionary Search icon (the Magnifying Glass) and enter \"pensar.\" Check the Spanish lookup box. Now scroll through the Examples to see what preposition to use.\n\nCheck Notes.\n\nLook up the English word \"weather.\" Double click on the entry with the definition \"tiempo.\" When the entry shows up in the Dictionary, notice that under the entry it says \"See Note.\"\n\nClick on the Note button in the Reference Toolbar for valuable additional information.\n\nUse the Atajo/Grammar. Spanish often uses a grammatical device rather than a word as an equivalent for the English.\n\nClick on the Dictionary Search icon (the Magnifying Glass) and enter \"will.\" Double click on the first item in the Search results box or click on the OK button to open the Dictionary.\n\nThe Dictionary entry indicates the existence of a note and the Note button on the Reference Toolbar has become active.\n\nClick on the Note button to open the note:\n\nScroll through the note using the scrollbar.\n\nThe Atajo task-oriented writing program is based primarily on the notion that students more readily learn to write in a foreign language if they begin to write compositions early in their study of the language. Our experience has shown that students are ready to write short compositions with Atajo after one semester, or approximately 15 weeks, of Spanish study. When elementary-level students are encouraged to write compositions that express personal meaning, they not only gain a sense of confidence in their written language ability, but they also feel less threatened by a composition assignment.\n\nIn addition to the notion that students should learn to write compositions from the beginning stages of language study, the Atajo task-oriented writing program is founded on the idea that students at all levels need explicit guidelines in order to benefit from a composition assignment. We have found that when students are only given a composition topic, they are either overwhelmed with the number of things they could include or, worse, they have no idea at all what to say. In either case, the work involved in coming up with ideas and then organizing them into a comprehensible whole can interfere with the linguistic dimension of the assignment. The general situations and more specific tasks provided in our exercises discourage students from trying to express their sophisticated ideas in limited Spanish as well as from translating directly from English to Spanish. Furthermore, the tasks provide an organizational framework that allows the students to concentrate on communicating a comprehensible message.\n\nFinally, the real-life situations and sample task-oriented exercises presented in the next section provide a model of our developmental writing program. We guide the students through three stages of writing that progress from simple to more complex tasks. These three stages of writing skill development are discussed in detail in Chapter 2.\n\nTask-Oriented Exercises--Stage 1\n\nSituation 1:\n\nYou have been asked to write a complete description of yourself for the new student files.\n\nTasks:\n\nGive your name, age, and nationality\n\nVocabulary: animals, domestic; family members; nationality\n\nGrammar: Uses of ser, Uses of tener\n\nDescribe yourself physically\n\nPhrases: describing people\n\nVocabulary: body, hair, face, etc.\n\nDescribe your personality\n\nVocabulary: personality\n\nConclude with a statement expressing how you feel about your school.\n\nPhrases: expressing an opinion\n\nSituation 2:\n\nYou are writing a letter to your new Mexican pen pal.\n\nTasks:\n\nUse the appropriate letter format.\n\nPhrases: talking about the date, writing a letter (informal)\n\nIntroduce yourself, giving your name, age, and where you live.\n\nVocabulary: nationality\n\nGrammar: Uses of tener\n\nTalk about your family\n\nVocabulary: family members\n\nGrammar: Possessive Adjs.\n\nAsk your new pen pal three questions about himself/herself.\n\nGrammar: Interrogatives\n\nEnd your letter with an appropriate closing.\n\nPhrases: writing a letter (informal)\n\nSituation 3:\n\nYou have been asked to summarize the story of Little Red Riding Hood (Caperucita roja) for Spanish children.

Propose a solution.\n\nPhrases: expressing a wish or desire, expressing hopes & aspirations, expressing wishes or desires.\n\nConclude with conjectures about this problem in the future.\n\nPhrases: hypothesizing, writing a conclusion\n\nThe notion that writing is a process rather than a product is one that most foreign language teachers today embrace. Students learn to write by being taught to reread, revise, and rewrite. After a teacher has indicated the errors in a composition (see Appendix A for correction symbols), students can easily correct and edit their work with Atajo. However, more than merely suggesting where the work needs correction, a teacher can encourage students to embellish their work. By directing students to use more vocabulary from specific categories or to include expressions from the Phrases Note Index, students will learn to focus on both form and content as they write their compositions."
