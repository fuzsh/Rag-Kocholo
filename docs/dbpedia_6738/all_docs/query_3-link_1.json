GQ España\n\nGQ España covers fashion topics like most other magazines, but it also has dedicated sections for news, shoes, la buena vida (the good life), cuidados (self-care) recommendations and “GQ men of the year.”\n\nWhat’s unique about this magazine is that its primary target audience is men.\n\nFor example, the cuidados section gives men masculine beauty and fashion advice, featuring roundups of the new and best colognes.\n\nThere’s also a GQTV section that features videos about very similar topics, organized into series.\n\nBenefits of Learning Spanish with Magazines\n\nSo now you know how to find magazines, you might still wonder what makes them so special as language learning tools.\n\nI mean, why grab a magazine instead of an e-book, newspaper or audiobook?\n\nDiverse content and format. There’s a magazine out there for any topic that interests you, and there are magazines geared toward all ages and Spanish skill levels. They can dive right into a topic and give their opinions unabashedly! This is great for those of us who love straight talk.\n\nThe gang’s all here. Most major magazines are translated or have Spanish editions targeted to specific regions. For example, you’ll find People en Español, Cosmopolitan and more. For many translated magazines, you can even choose versions targeted to specific countries—there’s usually a Mexican Spanish option used through Latin America and a Castilian Spanish one for Europe.\n\nMade for modern readers. The language and content are modern, and the format appeals to our mile-a-minute lifestyles. Stories are either bite-sized or accompanied by pictures to break down and illustrate the text. That means you can easily read a story quickly while traveling or on the go.\n\nStriking imagery provides context for language. Magazines are all about visual appeal. They won’t just lure you in with big, catchy headers—they’ll keep your eyes glued to the page with brilliant, full-color imagery. The images will illustrate key points in the text. Other images, such as in sidebars, advertisements and photo essays, all come accompanied by descriptive captions. All of this makes for an extremely well-supported Spanish learning experience.\n\nTips To Learn Spanish with Magazines\n\nTo start learning with magazines, here are a few quick tips for study time.\n\nJust read. Get your brain more familiar with Spanish by keeping magazines handy, either on your phone, your kitchen table or your bathroom counter, to glance at whenever you have a spare minute. You can also enjoy unwinding with them casually during free time.\n\nMark them up. If you’ve opted for print magazines, keep a pen tucked between the pages to mark new words, phrases and grammar patterns you encounter. You can either look up words as you go, copy them down in a notebook or refer back to your markings later.\n\nUse magazines as a jumping-off point for resources. Magazines love to review and feature other resources. Whether you discover a fashion line you adore or a hot new title in Spanish literature, highlight the cool external resources you discover in magazines and hunt them down later.\n\nDo activities with print magazines. Go kindergarten on those magazines. Chop them up with scissors and create posters or scrapbooks with your favorite texts and images. Tape them up on your bedroom wall or keep them on your office desk.\n\nInteract with magazines. Print magazines sometimes have little quizzes and games, but online magazines offer the most opportunities for interaction. Either way, learn actively by engaging with your magazines. Share outstanding articles on social media, tweet at the magazine’s staff, take virtual quizzes and comment in the forums.\n\nTurn magazines into lessons. An inevitable hurdle when learning with magazines is feeling daunted by large amounts of unfamiliar vocabulary. Download a dictionary app for on-the-go translations. Then get a flashcards app to add your new vocabulary for later study. You can also get FluentU and add your new words to flashcard lists.\n\nFluentU takes authentic videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.\n\nYou can try FluentU for free for 2 weeks. Check out the website or download the iOS app or Android app.\n\nP.S. Click here to take advantage of our current sale! (Expires at the end of this month.)\n\nNo matter your interests or Spanish level, magazines bring a diverse selection to the table. They’re a fun way to ease yourself into reading Spanish—while soaking up the culture, too.\n\nHead to the virtual magazine stands today, check out the latest to hit the shelves and learn Spanish with magazines for native-level immersion!"
