        "text": "Florencia Escudero (FE): Hello everyone. We wanted to begin this by asking you to briefly introduce yourselves and what you do.\n\nLucía Hinojosa Gaxiola (LHG): diSONARE is an editorial project made by me and my partner, Diego Gerard Morrison. diSONARE started because we wanted to find a place to publish weird bilingual poems and essays, and publish both our friends from Mexico City and other places, to start a community where people from Latin America and the U.S. could collaborate. We thought a journal was a good vehicle to create nourishing and syncretic communities. Diego is a fiction writer and a translator, and I am a visual artist and a poet. Because we work in many mediums, we were thinking of translation beyond the medium of words, or literature. A translation of mediums: in between spaces and spaces of friction. So diSONARE is an experimental journal that we started in 2013. We publish one journal per year, and we also do many other projects connected to the journal, including a sound archive, workshops, radio, and performances. Simultaneous to the editorial project, we have many other projects going on. Some of them start and end and start again. It is adaptive and fluid.\n\nStephanie Bezarra (SB): Edgar and I, as Tiempo de Zafra, have been working together since 2016.\n\nEdgar Garrido (EG): We met in New York and started working collaboratively. Tiempo de Zafra at those early stages wasn’t just me and Stephanie. I was also working with my father, who is a tailor and helped us make garments. We were sourcing whatever we could find, because we didn’t have the money to buy fabric and other materials. We would go to places like dollar stores and secondhand shops. Eventually, Stephanie and I put together our first collaboration. We brought pieces that we had worked on with my father and we installed them in front of Banco Popular on 181st in Manhattan, where there is already a big street market. The vendors are all immigrants, so at the time, there were Mexicans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans. It’s different now, but when we were there (and before then, when my grandmother would take me up there), it was this place where you could find all this weird stuff you couldn’t find elsewhere. When we set up our pieces, we were right next to this person selling dollar makeup and fake purses.\n\nSB: We installed the clothes in the middle of the market as a conversation starter. We weren’t really trying to sell anything, we just wanted to talk to people about what we were doing.\n\nEG: Through that we realized that we wanted to be able to do things informally, that there is also something formal in the informal, in the behaviors and attitudes that you encounter. So we decided to keep working alongside the things that inspire us. From that day on, we’ve been collaborating on everything. Then we moved the studio to the Dominican Republic and started collaborating with artists here as well.\n\nSB: In relation to publishing, it’s important to note that before we became a full-blown design studio, we were making more “traditional” art, and also making publications, prints, and zines, in order to get the word out about what we were doing.\n\nEG: It takes time for a project to be ready, but we had la inquietud de hacer cosas, y cuando tú tienes esa inquietud, tú lo haces como sea. When we look back now, it’s clear that all those things are a part of our story, but at the time, we just wanted to make stuff with the materials we found. From there, people started to commission us for certain things, like garments.\n\nFE: You have a collection of religious pamphlets, and you also incorporate a lot of graphic elements into your garments. Can you tell us about this collection?\n\nEG: The culture here es muy religiosa—hay católicos, evangélicos, y cristianos. They always find a way to get their message out. There is this marketing behind the Word of the Lord that is very robust. Here [in DR] it is very interesting.\n\nSB: And you find these pamphlets everywhere—on the floor, people pass them out to us.\n\nEG: We have a pamphlet that a group was passing out that says “La Visa…Al Cielo” with the American thing. In Dominican Republic, for most of the people who haven’t left, one of the dreams is to get your visa and get out of here. The Latin American thing, to want to leave: “nos vamos para América, una vida mejor, un futuro mejor.” There are so many. We have another that says “Lo Que El Dinero No Puede Comprar.” When you look inside, there’s a message: “Placer, pero no el amor/ un esclavo, pero no un amigo/ una mujer, pero no una esposa/ una casa, pero no un hogar/ alimento, pero no apetito/ medicinas, pero no salud/ diplomas, pero no cultura/ libros, pero no inteligencia/ escuelas, pero no educación/ tranquilidad, pero no paz/ la indulgencia, pero no perdón/ la tierra, pero no se compra el cielo.”\n\nLHG: Incredible.\n\nSB: You can relate to it, whether you’re religious or not. A lot of what we do with them is taking them out of context, because people are less likely to pay attention to them when they have this religious connection.\n\nEG: The landscape here also has a lot of graphic elements. People don’t buy an awning for their businesses, they will paint right on the front of the building. I want to show you another pamphlet, which reads, “Lo tenía todo, pero le faltaba Dios”—and it’s a picture of Michael Jackson! When I saw this, I was like, ¡se pasaron!\n\nFE: I love the idea of this unknown person cranking out the graphics and drawings.\n\nEG: We started to appropriate these pamphlets and texts. The same way that the garments are deconstructed, made from various found and recycled garments, we started to deconstruct the messages.Tiempo de Zafra is very inspired by this graphic landscape—it’s not just about wanting to make a graphic T-shirt. Our environment is already that jumble of messages and objects.\n\nLHG: It sounds like you are reading the environment. I often ask myself what is reading, and what is writing? These objects and texts you find are almost like divination systems, or messages talking to you. Like a Tarot deck unfolding in public space.\n\nEG: Exactly. Tú te encuentras mensajes que maybe te guían. Sometimes, if I find one and we already have it, I’ll place it somewhere donde yo sé que alguien va a pasar y se lo va a llevar. Yo me imagino que hay muchas más personas que hacen lo mismo.\n\nFE: That starts to happen in WhatsApp, too. Does anyone have that relative that will pass along these little graphics that read, “Dios te bendiga superpowers today.” It’s on the web now — there are some relatives that will only communicate through those graphics.\n\nSB: It’s so interesting to see how that visual communication is evolving between generations, and how it will keep evolving. The younger people use those stickers, and our parents or uncles, will say “Buen día, que Dios te bendiga,” with the ClipArt caterpillar on a sunflower or something.\n\nEG: I don’t think that the pamphlets are so different from the stickers, in terms of what people want to communicate.\n\nGabriela Collins-Fernández (GCF): In gathering ideas for bringing you all together around independent publishing and collaboration, there were a few markers that Flo and I came up with that could be useful to guide the discussion. Publications have to do with the presentation and dissemination of kinds of knowledge. You have both spoken about this already a little; Lucía in terms of translating beyond mediums, and Edgar and Stephanie in terms of this reading of landscape. What centers of knowledge do you want to bring forth and communicate?\n\nThere is also the question of reproduction and type. In the case of diSONARE, that clearly happens through the journal itself. For Tiempo de Zafra, you could talk about reproduction in relation to a pattern (for making garments)? The pattern itself could be talked about as a kind of publication, or print. There are different kinds of ethics and goals that you have in terms of the reproduction of objects and forms of knowledge. Does being independent play a role in these systems and actions? Are you working in opposition to particular centers? Does this have something to do with what Edgar mentioned earlier, the formality of the informal?\n\nLHG: Any project that has formality can give you structure. But informality gives you another structure, which is more unpredictable. In diSONARE, we are excited about the unpredictability of things. We give agency to things that are more outside of ourselves, the in-between spaces of collaboration or collision; those nodes of coherence that are unpredictable. We also ask ourselves: what is legibility? Who do you have to be legible to? Do you want to be legible, or illegible, which is another way of generating questions and forces which propel you forward. I like that rubric of reading the environment and letting these new forms of communication guide you, expanding into a more layered complexity. What sprouts out of that?\n\nGCF: Are there particular ways you want to be legible or illegible, or places that you want to read this way? Is this an abstract, as well as a practical, concern?\n\nLHG: I think time has to do with it. I’m very interested in the future, and perceiving the past as a future. We don’t know so many things about the past. I am very interested in figures of literature or art in Mexico and in other places that haven’t been explored or seen. In Latin America (maybe everywhere) there is this idea of monumentality—the muralists, for example. But there are many other, less investigated ephemeral artforms and activities, like the millions of private scenes women writers were describing back in the ‘40s, or the work of exiled people. Today, these heaps of memory and history remain invisible, but they are part of the environment—the way we form language, the way we form relationships—that are beyond these monumental monsters. diSONARE is an attempt to bring those layers of time, events, and international conversations between artists, poets, people who have migrated, closer to the surface. Questioning what identity means, within these terms, and the illegibility of that identity.\n\nGCF: Tiempo de Zafra, as a kind of motto, takes into consideration the idea that there is abundance. That what we need for our use is already present, it is a way of looking at the world which is generous. On the other hand, the raw materials that you are using are themselves in this over-excessive state. No matter what, you couldn’t use all of this discarded fabric that you encounter. There’s an interesting tension between the impossible quantities of material in relation to the kind of local knowledge and information that you talk about being erased, and what it means to take certain kinds of actions to mediate between these two.\n\nLHG: In relation to the idea of interventions, I was thinking about the various kinds of projects we receive in diSONARE through our open calls. Sometimes we get proposals for a project that has been thought through very carefully and is presented as a finished work, but we are more interested in the process: how was it conceived? What came before the work itself? We might instead say, “we want to publish this part of your research, perhaps sketches or notes.” We try to curate a process-based approach to ideas. We are also sometimes very cryptic. One of the artists we have worked a lot with [is] Christopher Rey Pérez, que también es poeta y editor. We made a triptych of his work “Anábasis en la Ciudad de México,” an experimental derive exploring the city and its margins, the parallels between narration and walking. We included three different pieces of the whole investigation in three issues of the journal, so the meaning is scattered across the issues.\n\nAnother artist, Daniel Aguilar Ruvalcaba, made a work dealing with Mexican bills. En el billete de doscientos pesos está el poeta Nezahualcóyotl, and on the 100 peso bill is Sor Juana. So we published the serial number of each bill as a form of poetry. Then, another artist, Marcia Santos, read the serial numbers aloud during an improvisational performance. We take things from here and there and repurpose them. We try to think of editing as a kind of radical translation of meaning and language. We try to think of words and language as “raw material,” to reference the term Edgar used.\n\nEG: You see what I’m saying—the whole idea of independent publishing is so much of this process and I’m pretty sure en toda Latinoamérica es así. Porque lo que pasa es [que] cuando el gobierno no está haciendo lo que tiene que hacer, la gente lo va hacer igual.\n\nSB: La gente busca los recursos…\n\nEG: Hay recursos que son información, dinero, conexiones, creatividad. Y hay otros recursos, como decir “lo voy a hacer como sea.” Mucha gente no tiene la iniciativa de hacer las cosas porque necesitan que todo esté perfecto.\n\ndiSONARE is born out of the concept of dissonance, referencing the complexities that feed art & writing in their diverse genres and practices. diSONARE is an experimental editorial platform directed by Lucía Hinojosa Gaxiola and Diego Gerard Morrison. We focus on hybrid art processes in the intersection between poetry and art, as well as translations, fiction and criticism.
