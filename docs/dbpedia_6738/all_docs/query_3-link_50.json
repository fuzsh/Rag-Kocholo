        "text": "When my daughter turned two years old, I bought her a subscription to a French children's magazine called Popi. Admittedly, subscribing to a French magazine for delivery in the USA is costly, and I wondered if it would be worth the expense. But even at that age, my daughter adored receiving Popi and she continues to read those same issues even now at four years old. We switched to Toupie et Chansons the following year; that subscription included four music CDs with the special issues. I'll write specific reviews for those magazines in a future blog post, but for now, here's an overview of the French children's magazines available in the U.S. and how to subscribe. (Children's magazines in Spanish are further down.)\n\nBayard and Milan are currently the only French publishers offering an option to order their magazines using U.S. dollars. You can order through their English website, Frenchmagforkids.com, but the subscription will cost less If you order through the publishers' sales representative in your region. (For example, if you live on the East Coast of the U.S., you can contact Marie-Caroline Russell for a catalog, subscription form, and current price list by mail.)"
