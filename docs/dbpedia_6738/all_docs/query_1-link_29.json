        "text": "|\n\nVery interesting and useful, thank you. To add to the recent discussions:\n\nI am the editor (since 1993) of DIECIOCHO, a journal (now in its 34th year) dedicated to the study of the Enlightenement and Long Eighteenth Century in Spain and Latin America. Here is the website:\n\nhttp://faculty.virginia.edu/dieciocho/\n\nDIECIOCHO believes strongly in mutual respect and professional behavior, and for that reason we promise authors that we will have a double peer review of their submission within 60 days of electronic receipt. My experience as editor is that it is possible to identify evaluators for anonymous review and that the reviewers will complete their work within the allotted time. Our evaluations strive to be respectful and constructive.\n\nIt is unconscionable to ask a colleague to wait for 6 or 12 months for an evaluation of their submission. All of the excuses (“I’m busy,” “I have a lot of work,” “I didn’t have time”) strike me as egocentric whining (who is NOT busy??) and completely unprofessional. We can (and should) do better.\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid T. Gies\n\nCommonwealth Professor of Spanish\n\nEditor, DIECIOCHO\n\n|\n\nThanks to all the contributors for sharing their knowledge, and also to the founder of the blog for facilitating this knowledge exchange. It is a really useful resource.\n\nI hope the query that I am about to make is not outside the remit of this blog.\n\nAs a European scholar, I have been very surprised by the amount of American high quality Hispanic Studies journals that are available in print only. Practically all of the British ones are digitalised. Why this recluctance to embrace an on-line format?\n\nSurely, it impedes the internationalisation of these journals, perhaps contributing to the current divide in Hispanic studies scholarship whereby American and British scholars tend to use only national sources. For example, the Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies seems to have very little impact in America, while certain American journals have not received their deserved attention in Britain.\n\n|\n\nIn light of the wonderful comments and discussion taking place on this blog, I’d like to pose a simple question that may better aid younger scholars moving up or into the field: based on current reputation, how might one rank the top general journals in Hispanic studies? By “current reputation” I mean to underscore the journal’s importance today. In other words, if a journal was great back in the late ’80s and early ’90s, but is a mess right now, it’s overall reputation may be good, but its current reputation would not be good. I think that while humanities scholars generally resist rankings on a subjective basis claiming that they are arbitrary, they can certainly be useful to provide younger scholars with a basis from which to form their opinions as they move up or into the field. I’ve provided my own impression of the top general (accepts studies from all periods and on both sides of the Atlantic) Hispanist journals below. (Note: I’ve excluded places that aren’t exclusively Hispanic studies like PMLA, MLN, MLQ, etc.)\n\n1. Hispanic Review\n\n2. Revista Hispánica Moderna\n\n3. Revista Canadiense de Estudios Hispánicos\n\n4. Revista de Estudios Hispánicos\n\n5. Hispania\n\n6. Arizona Journal of Hispanic Cultural Studies\n\n7. The Bulletin of Hispanic Studies\n\n8. Revista Iberoamericana\n\n9. Hispanófila\n\nPlease, comment in response to this with your own ranking of general Hispanist journals, correcting my omissions, or reorganizing the journals I’ve ranked. I reiterate, I think this exercise, though pedantic and idiosyncratic for established scholars, may be very useful for young scholars trying to understand as best they can how journals are evaluated vis-a-vis other journals in the discipline of Hispanic studies.\n\n|\n\nAre there any journals we’re omitting here that might be included in a so-called “top ten” journal list in Hispanic studies? I’m an American scholar and am familiar with most of these journals, save Hispanófila, but I figure there may be other journals that have similar weight to, say, Revista Canadiense de Estudios Hispánicos. What other journals might we include? For example, the second commenter behind the original “ranking” post seems to suggest a completely different top ten than the one that organizes the journals into tiers. What other “tiers” could we include, beyond the first and second tiers, of general Hispanist journals?\n\n|\n\nWhatever you do – do not submit anything to Tesserae, the Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies, based in the UK. They are incredibly infamous for taking their time with reviews and having little thought on the author. As both a reviewer and author I find the atitude of ‘sitting’ on articles for months on end utterly ludicrous and unprofessional at that. Things ought to be conducted in a much more efficient manner all round I think. Without authors there would be no journal, we all need each other so working together respectfully and with a professional attitude would really improve things.\n\n|\n\nI am surprised by the comment posted on April 10th regarding Tesserae: Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies. I have published with them twice, ten years apart, and on both occasions the pieces went through at the normal speed for journals here in the UK. I did find the editing process a little trying second time round, as I was required to make several pedantic (in my opinion) alterations to wording, but I’d rather know that my contribution has been read closely, not just “waved through”. It’s a good journal, I was surprised to read elsewhere that it has little impact in the US.\n\n|\n\nI recently received an invitation from the journal Humanities (link below) to edit a special edition in my specific field. Hidden in this website is the fact that they have an “article processing charge” of 1400 CHF, which is roughly $1,500 USD. They told me they are willing to to waive it for the editor and well-known scholars, but that means the lesser known folks still foot the bill. Not surprisingly, perhaps, I declined.\n\nThen I thought it is important to remind the junior scholars who read this blog that in our discipline that they should NEVER publish in (or submit to) a journal that has these types of astronomical fees. There are hundreds of journals that will publish your work for FREE, many of which are excellent. In my experience, the most a journal asked me to pay was for a subscription. Book publications are a different story.. The veterans of this blog can feel free to correct me if I am wrong about this.\n\nOf course, also remember look at all parts of the website because that might be something that is easy to overlook.\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/humanities/about"
