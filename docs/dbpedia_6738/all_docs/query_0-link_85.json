        "text": "The articles to be submitted for their publication in the magazine Prolegómenos Derechos y Valores have to fulfill the next criterion:\n\nOnly original writings and unpublished investigation process results will be published.\n\nThe official language of the magazine is Spanish. Articles in English and Portuguese will also be received.\n\nThe submitted articles that fulfill the demanded requirements and are assessed by the editorial and scientific committee, will be subjected to a process of evaluation through arbitration. The designated arbitrators are external and the “double blind” system will be used in order to guarantee anonymity.\n\nThe evaluated articles will be sent back to their authors for making the corresponding corrections, or containing the required comments.\n\nOnce a work is accepted, the author has to transfer the copyright to the Political, Legal and Social Research Center of the Faculty of Law in the Universidad Militar Nueva Granada.\n\nThe contents and profile of the articles have to adjust to only one of the next categories:\n\nArticle of investigation and innovation:\n\nDocument that shows the original and unpublished production, published in a magazine of scientific, technological or academic contents, resulting from investigation, reflection or revision processes, which has been subject of evaluation in pairs. In no case there will be accepted as an article of investigation and innovation contributions such as publications not obtained from investigation, summaries, communications to congresses, letters to the editor, book reviews, bibliographies, institutional bulletins, editorial notes, necrologies, news or translations of articles previously published in other means, opinion piece or conjunction, and similar writings (this even applies in the cases in which it is proved that the mentioned types of contribution have been subject of evaluation in pairs).\n\nIn turn, an article of investigation can be classified in:\n\nArticle of scientific and technological investigation. Document that shows, in a detailed way, the original results of investigation projects already finished. The structure generally used contains four important sections: introduction, methodology, results and conclusions.\n\nArticle of reflection. Text that shows results of investigation finished from an analytic, interpretative or critical perspective of the author, about a specific subject, turning to original sources. It is a type of critical study with results and contributions.\n\nArticle of revision. Document that results from a finished investigation, where results of published and unpublished investigations are analyzed, systematized and integrated, on a field of science or technology, in order to give an account of progresses and trends of development. It is characterized by showing a careful bibliographic revision of at least fifty references.\n\nThe postulated article has to take into account the next formal aspects:\n\nTitle, whose maximum extension is twenty words. The finished investigation project to which the product belongs, the university institution and, if applies, the group of investigation to which the postulated article corresponds, have to be outlined in footnote. Besides, it has to be said if it corresponds to an investigation, reflection or revision article, according to Colciencias typologies.\n\nAuthor(s). In footnote it has to be done a short description about their studies, institutional link and e-mail.\n\nSummary, in the language that the article is written, with a maximum of 150 words. It has to contain the main objectives of the investigation, scope, methodology used and main results and conclusions. It has to be clear, coherent and concise, for which it is suggested to revise and verify data, syntax, spelling, not to make mistakes and not to include bibliographic references.\n\nKey words. Maximum six.\n\nTitle, summary and key words in a second language. They will always be in English, unless the article is written in this language, in which case the second language will be Spanish.\n\nIntroduction. The investigation problem, the objectives, the methodology and an approach to the topic have to be clearly identified. One thousand words, maximum.\n\nConclusions.\n\nWhen graphs or tables are used, they have to be numbered, with their corresponding title and source (quote or own work).\n\nThe maximum extension of the articles is thirty pages, according to the next specifications: Arial 12 points, interline 1,5, letter size and 3 cm margin in all sides.\n\nQuotes and bibliographic references according to APA norms (sixth edition).\n\nThereupon, some examples about APA norms are explained:\n\nAPA norms carry out the quotation inside the body of the text, not in footnote. The bibliography is named references and is placed at the end of the document. The textual quotes with less than 40 words are written between quotation marks (“ ”) inside the body of the text. The textual quotes with more than 40 words are written outside the body of the text and with indentation. In both cases cursive is not used, and the author’s last name, year of publication and page have to be added at the end of each quote.\n\nExample: “The notary carries out a public function, and his behavior is regulated by the legislation corresponding to each State” (Barba, 2014, p. 5).\n\nIf the quote is indirect (paraphrase of the original quote) there are no quotation marks, but the author and the reference year.\n\nExample: For Witker (2011) services are the new objects of international trading.\n\nRules according to the number of authors\n\nOne or two authors\n\nExample of quote in text: (Cotino, 2000) or (Marquez and Galindo, 2010).\n\nExample of reference: Cotino, L. (2012). The right to education as a fundamental right. Special attention to its social benefit dimension. Madrid: Center of Political and Constitutional Studies.\n\nBetween three and five authors\n\nExample of quote in text: (Liñán, López and Mangas, 2012).\n\nWhen there are three, four or five authors, all of them are written in the first quote and in the next quotes only the last name of the first author is written, followed by the abbreviation et al. With the previous example, the subsequent quotes would be: (Liñan, et al., 2012)..\n\nExample of reference: Liñán, J., López, D. & Mangas, A. (2012). Institutions and rights of European Union.
