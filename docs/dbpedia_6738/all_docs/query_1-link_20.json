        "text": "The eighth album from Mendoza indie rock luminaries, who have been in the game for 15 years, kicks off with the breezy and endlessly hummable “Un Par de Árboles,” a laid-back, introspective ditty about the existential search for things we already have. Song by song, Isla de Oro unravels as a charming exercise in restraint; carefully layered guitar, bass, synth, and drum arrangements swirl across mellow tracks like “Olimpica” and “Impecable.” At the center stands frontman Mariano di Cesare, who writes emotional epics about running from inevitability (“La Araña”) and how all that constant movement can lead you anywhere, or nowhere at all (“Mapa”). —R.V.\n\nSofía Reyes has been making huge hits over the past four years, including the 2018 chart-topper “1, 2, 3” with Jason Derulo and De La Ghetto, and the 2019 earworm “R.I.P” with Anitta and Rita Ora. On Mal de Amores, she takes the best of her sound and branches out even farther, adding experimental new tracks that take on new styles and genres. She dives into bachata on “La Bachata,” explores cumbia on the feminist anthem “Mujer,” and incorporates accordions from her native Monterrey on “Gallina.” The 17-song project, with its rainbow cover and Mexican iconography, served as a maximalist, all-encompassing portrait of Reyes and who she’s become. —T.M.\n\nSnow tha Product was asked to deliver a straightforward EP with To Anywhere, but instead, she gave her fans an eclectic, wide-ranging 16-song project, stacked with dembow, R&B, and her signature rapid-fire rap verses. She shows off her skills on the infectious “Sola” with Ceky Viciny, drags an ex on the playful “Not Today” with Juicy J, and builds a flirty, unapologetically queer anthem with Lauren Jauregui on the standout “Piña.” The whole time, she spotlights the maturity she’s found in her lyrics, telling Rolling Stone that the music was a chance to show everything she was going through in her personal life. —T.M.\n\nThe experimental renegades from Combo Chimbita didn’t just expand their sound on IRE; they went deeper into everything they’ve been doing for the past several years. The group has been exploring and blending tons of genres into powerful fusions throughout their last LPs, and they find new strength on IRE’s songs about spirituality and resilience after the pandemic. Breathtaking moments come on tracks like “Oya,” “Mujer Jaguar,” “Babalawo,” and “Me Fui,” which see the band soul-searching through electric guitars and Caribbean rhythms, packing the album with transcendental visions and ideas of hope, rebirth, and renewal. —M.H.\n\nAcross the Latin music industry, the Puerto Rican multi-hyphenate Mora has been a secret weapon as a producer: His credits were all over Bad Bunny’s YHLQMDLG and El Último Tour del Mundo. But he’s stepped into his own after his 2020 debut album, Primer Dia De Classes, and his playful sophomore effort, Microdosis, took him to a new level. Without dampening his razor-sharp rhyming ability, he experimented freely, offering tracks such as the up-tempo dancefloor banger “badtrip :(“ and the woozy breakup ballad “Tus Lagrimas.” The album was a preview of Mora’s interest in electronic sounds; he followed the LP up with Paraíso, inspired by nights in Ibiza. —J.L.\n\nAfter finding success with singles like “Baby Blue” and “San Lucas,” the Mexican singer-songwriter Kevin Kaarl felt stuck. He couldn’t get inspired — until he watched the 1984 film Paris, Texas, starring Harry Dean Stanton, and instantly related to the central character’s struggle to rediscover himself. He began writing rich, bountiful songs that capture an intimate inner journey and toggle from restless to introspective to carefree. “The album is a story of someone who lost interest in himself and then reconnects with themselves,” he told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “It makes you feel more human to know that someone who was lost was able to find themselves again.” —J.L.\n\nCarla Morrison is known for her light, gauzy sound, but she embraced sounds that are vibrant, upbeat, and full of new life on El Renacimiento. The album is her first in five years following a period of difficulty: She almost left music at one point, but she found her way back by letting go and rediscovering her craft. And while pop pivots are notoriously hard to pull off, Morrison never comes off unnatural or strained. Instead, she makes her journey something listeners want to be a part of: “Volví, volví a mí,” she sings on the gleaming opener “Hacia Dentro.” “Volví a existir.” —J.L.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s indie scene has been flourishing over the past few years, and the rebel-minded producer Mediopicky has been one of the most compelling figures at the center of it all, creating mutinous, left-of-center sounds that are entirely his own. His self-titled album collects all of the wild sounds sprouting in his brain and smashes them together, blurring elements of dembow, house, and electronica into one. A major highlight comes when he teams up with the equally brilliant producer Diego Raposo for “Dios Nos Esta Viendo,” a melodic experiment with a face-melting metal touch. —J.L.\n\nHaving already established herself as a leader in Mexico’s growing R&B scene, Girl Ultra decided to launch herself into multiple new directions and test out new sounds on El Sur. She rages on “Punk,” a melodic rock banger with Little Jesus, tries out house-influenced production on the energetic “Bombay,” and shines on the garage-tinged “Para Q te Acuerdes de Mi.” No matter what she’s doing, the project shows that her vocals and charisma can’t be contained to a single genre — and that she’s at her strongest when she gets to do it all. —M.H.\n\nAt first, it seemed like this was going to be a tough year for Feid. The album he’d spent months working on got leaked to the public in the fall, messing up the careful rollout he’d originally planned for December. But instead of getting upset, Feid dropped the album ahead of schedule, playfully titling it Feliz Cumpleaños Ferxxo te Pirateamos el Álbum. His go-with-the-flow attitude — and the music, helmed by Sky Rompiendo and Icon Music — endeared him even more to fans, who loved the way the LP celebrated the best of Medellín’s music scene. In the end, Feid ended up one of the biggest breakout stars of 2022. —L.V.\n\nLos Tigres Del Norte’s classics are timeless, and on La Reunión, they tap into the same poignant, relatable storytelling that have made them música Mexicana heavyweights since the Seventies. On the moving track “La Carta,” they sing about delivering the letter of an undocumented fan to his mother in Mexico. They also draw from the dance-driven energy of their 2004 hit “La Manzanita” on “La Rutina,” which celebrates the daily pleasures of just sipping coffee and enjoying life. On the standout title track, the band details the grueling reunion of estranged siblings after years of absence, proving once again the power of Los Tigres’ narrative and lyrical skills. —T.M.\n\nAfter helping globalize reggaeton music, Daddy Yankee decided to retire with style and give fans one last album, aptly titled Legendaddy. Throughout the anticipated LP, the Puerto Rican pioneer lives up to his G.O.A.T. status while pushing reggaeton to new places: He gives the genre an electronic update on “X Última Vez,” featuring Bad Bunny. Then, on the pulsating “Pasatiempo” with Myke Towers, he works in a sample of Robin S.’s “Show Me Love,” and even manages to embrace funk music on the alluring “Agua,” which credits Nile Rodgers alongside Rauw Alejandro. Each song shows how he’s continued to impact reggaeton even while putting down his mic. —L.V.\n\nOn Tinta y Tiempo, Jorge Drexler turned a creative crisis into one of the most masterful albums of the year. The Uruguayan singer-songwriter started working on the project at the height of the pandemic and found himself stuck as lockdown hit, unable to collaborate and play ideas for friends as he’d done in the past. Luckily, he found ways to finish the music, enlisting help from artists such as Panamanian legend Rubén Blades, who helps him toast to life and love on the bustling “El Plan Maestro.” Drexer also tapped C. Tangana for “Tocarte,” a highlight that won this year’s Latin Grammy for Song of the Year. —L.V.\n\nBad Bunny’s fourth studio album, Un Verano Sin Ti, defined 2022. The 23-song collection delivered a genre-bending exploration of Caribbean rhythms and quickly broke records while making history: It was the album that spent the most time at Number One on the Billboard 200 chart this year, returning to that position again and again over the past several months, even as the world’s biggest-selling artists — Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Harry Styles among them — released career-defining material. Later, it became the first Spanish-language record nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys — all while Bad Bunny broke his own Spotify record and was named the most streamed artist on the planet for the third year in a row.\n\nThe beauty of Un Verano sin Ti is that it was inspired by summers Benito spent growing up in Puerto Rico before he skyrocketed into superstardom. The album is an emotional amalgamation of scenes that are both playful and intimate — the tias asking about las novias, the impromptu chinchorreo after a day at the beach, the realization that staying in the archipelago you call home is no longer an option — and it encompasses the euphoria and pain of being a 20-something-year-old in 2022. It’s safe to say there won’t be a summer quite like the summer of Un Verano sin Ti — unless Bad Bunny decides to outdo himself once again in the future. —F.S.S."
