Tiempo's Spanish course is taught by native teachers.

Based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and curricula, students will comprehensively learn grammar, practice conversation, listening and reading comprehension.

The Director of the Education Division, Mr. Isidoro has a Master in Linguistics from the University of Salamanca, the oldest university in Spain. Taking advantage of his broad of experience in teaching Spanish to foreigners, we offer lessons according to the level of the students.

In addition to group lessons, we recommend private lessons for those who seek a professional career;others who want lessons for a specific purpose or students who cannot take classes at specific times every week. We offer a variety of courses such as conversation lessons for those who want to improve their communication skills and DELE (Diplomas in Spanish as Foreign Language) preparation courses.

The best thing about learning Spanish at Tiempo is that you can also learn about the diverse cultures of Spain and Latin American countries behind the language. Even if you say that those countries speak the same Spanish, in reality the language they speak, their culture and history vary.

Every month, we also plan extracurricular activities with elaborate themes to deepen the studentâs cultural knowledge as well as their Spanish language proficiency.

In addition, there are instructors who come to Japan from various countries, so you have an awesomechance to try Spanish with native speakers. Please feel free to try and learn Spanish in an environment that is rare even in Japan, where you can learn Spanish and the cultures of the Latin American countries every day.

The levels are divided in 6 (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). It is an ideal situation for learning Spanish in a small group with up to 8 people per class. The students actively participate in lessons.And students and teachers can use Spanish in a natural environment. With the latest teaching methods using texts, videos and audios, you will learn Spanish in a real-life environment while staying in Fukuoka.
