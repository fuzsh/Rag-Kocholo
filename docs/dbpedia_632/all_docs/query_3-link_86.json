Here comes my tentative english\n\ntranslation (I am spanish, YES, JUST LIKE PENELOPE!) open to any\n\nimprovements the readers may find necessary.\n\nIt's sweet to die on the sea\n\non the green waves of the sea\n\nThe night he didn't come back was\n\nwas of great sadness to me\n\nSaveiro (Bahia´s typical fishermen boat) came back alone\n\na sad night it was for me\n\nIt's sweet..\n\nSaveiro departed by night\n\ndawn..- it didn't came back\n\nThe handsome fisherman\n\nwas taken by the mermaidof the sea\n\nIt's sweet..\n\nOn the green waves of the sea, my love\n\nHe was drowned\n\nHe made his bridegroom bed\n\non Iemanja's lap\n\nIf you were moved by this beautiful song (which says a lot, all of it\n\ngood, about you) you should buy the CD from which it was taken.It\n\ncontains a selection of the fishermen songs written by Dorival Caymmi\n\nselected and performed with strange beauty by his son Dori.\n\nThe name of the CD is \"tome conta do meu filho que eu também ja fói do\n\nmar\" by Dori Caymmi. EMI 855577 2. The long title, which is a verse of\n\none of the songs, means \"take care of my son, because I alreadywas a\n\nman of the sea\" the prayer of an old fisherman to Iemanjá, to obtain\n\nher protection for his son, also a fisherman.\n\nDori was more than protected by Iemanjá. He has been blessed with\n\nmusic , just like his father.\n\nNacha"
