        "text": "\"Poesia Musicada\" CD Release\n\nDori Caymmi - guitar/vocals, Bill Cantos - piano & keyboard, Mike Shapiro – drums, Jerry Watts – bass\n\nRooted in Bossa Nova with a sound all his own, Dori Caymmi is a world-class, Grammy-winning jazz musician. Following in the footsteps of his iconic father, Dorival Caymmi, his music is a fusion of jazz, pop, and Brazilian strokes that merge into a soothing sound that echo the history of his family. After numerous releases and multiple awards, including the Comenda Tiradentes (the highest honor granted by the Legislature of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais), Dori continues to write, arrange, and play music in his inimitable way, recently releasing Poesia Musicada, a tender memoir to his late father’s memory -- flowing, acoustic guitar-based songs: a calling card back to an intimate place and time in Dori’s artistry.\n\nhttp://www.doricaymmi.com/ingles/cd18.php\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S85c84IIGh8\n\nContact: 650 726-4143 • Email: info@bachddsoc.org\n\n© 2015 Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society"
