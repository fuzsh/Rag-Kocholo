        "text": "Dorival Caymmi, who has died in Rio de Janeiro aged 94, was one of Brazil's best-loved composers, a man whose deep, sultry voice and sublime tributes to his homeland made him something of a cultural ambassador. Born in Salvador, the capital of the north-eastern state of Bahia, Caymmi was brought up surrounded by music. His father was a civil servant who played the guitar, piano and the mandolin. His mother, known as Dona Sinha, enjoyed singing.\n\nCaymmi began his adult life as a journalist, but had started writing songs as a teenager, and in 1936 won his first composing competition. In April 1938, just short of his 24th birthday, Caymmi arrived at Rio de Janeiro's docks carrying his guitar under his arm. Initially he had planned to study law and work in journalism, but his passion for music meant that before long he was performing on the radio shows that had taken root in 1930s Brazil.\n\nIt was at the Rádio Nacional station in Rio that he met his future wife, the singer Stella Maris, as she sung a track by the samba legend Noel Rosa. The pair married in 1940. Caymmi's big break came in the late 1930s when a little-known singer by the name of Carmen Miranda adopted one of his compositions, entitled O Que É Que a Baiana Tem? (What Does the Woman from Bahia Have?). The song helped launch Miranda's colourful Hollywood career and went on to become one of the unofficial anthems of Brazil's north-east. Caymmi's songs were born out of his three greatest passions: the sea, his adoptive home of Rio de Janeiro and the Afro-Brazilian roots of his birthplace, which had been a major destination for slaves from across the Atlantic. Though he never returned there, his music, which he described as fishermen's songs, contained constant references to the Afro-Brazilian gods and traditions of Bahia state.\n\nAlong with his close friend the writer Jorge Amado, who died in 2001, Caymmi was considered one of the greatest representatives of the region's culture. The pair even joined forces to compose one of Caymmi's best-known songs, É Doce Morrer no Mar (It is Sweet to Die in the Sea.)\n\nCaymmi also penned numerous tributes to Brazilian women, and spent much of his life surrounded by the bohemia of Copacabana beach's bars and nightclubs. The number of songs he composed was relatively small: he wrote about 100 tracks and recorded some 20 albums. Yet his music was re-recorded by musicians around the world.\n\nHis three children, Danilo, Dori and Nana, are all well-known performers in Brazil; Stella went into a coma some days before his death, and herself died 10 days after it."
