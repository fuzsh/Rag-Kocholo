The son of legendary Brazilian musician Dorival Caymmi, his work is a gorgeous blend of pop, jazz and Brazilian sensibilities, and over his 50-year career he has released 11 solo recordings and written dozens of scores for theatre, film and television. In recent years, Caymmi has been recognized for his indelible contributions to Brazilan culture, receiving the Ordem do Rio Branco, the highest cultural honor bestowed by the Brazilian government. The two-time Grammy winner leads a crack quintet for his SFJAZZ Center debut.\n\nTickets"
