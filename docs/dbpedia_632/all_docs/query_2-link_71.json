        "text": "Lyrics from “Marina” by Dorival Caymmi (1947)\n\n—\n\nGood Audio Version (Danilo Caymmi)\n\n—\n\nMarina, morena\n\nMarina, you’ve made yourself up\n\nMarina, do anything, but do me a favor\n\nDon’t paint that face that I fancy\n\nThat I fancy, and is only mine\n\nMarina, you’re already pretty\n\nWith what God gave you\n\nI’m annoyed, I’ve grown angry\n\nI can’t speak anymore\n\nAnd when I’m angry, Marina, I don’t know how to pardon\n\nI’ve forgiven many things – you couldn’t find another like me\n\nI’m sorry, Marina, morena, but I’m cross (Repeat)\n\nI’m cross with you, I’m cross with you…\n\n— Interpretation —\n\nDorival Caymmi began this song by writing the final verse: “Eu tô de mal com você” (I’m cross with you, or I’m on bad terms with you). The lines were inspired by Caymmi’s 3-year-old son, Dori, who had just grumpily informed his father, “eu tô de mal com você”; Caymmi found his son’s words poetic and started the song. That’s as far as Dori’s inspiration goes, though: In the song, a jealous husband becomes cross with his wife for wearing makeup, saying he’s already forgiven many things, but this? Unforgivable.\n\nThe subject matter caused Caymmi some trouble. As Stella Caymmi relates in Dorival Caymmi: O Mar e o Tempo, after Caymmi performed the song at a show in Brazil one night, a drunk man approached him claiming to be Marina’s husband, and looking for a fight.\n\nLike most of Caymmi’s songs, “Marina” is exquisitely simple – a testament to Caymmi’s meticulous song-writing process. Because he often spent years on a single song (João Valentão, for example, took him nine years to write), Caymmi’s body of work totaled just over a hundred songs. But as fellow Bahian Caetano Veloso remarked, each of the songs is a “perfect jewel.”\n\nCaymmi’s songs can be split into three categories: Bahian-inspired beach songs and sambas de roda, and urban sambas with a more Carioca tone, of which “Marina” was one of the first. The song, released together with “Lá vem a Baiana,” is one of Caymmi’s greatest hits, and was recorded by four singers — Dick Farney, Francisco Alves, Nelson Gonçalves, and Caymmi himself — which was quite rare at a time when recording studios tended to allow just one singer to release a given song.\n\nLyrics in Portuguese\n\nMarina, morena\n\nMarina, você se pintou\n\nMarina, você faça tudo\n\nMas faça um favor\n\nNão pinte esse rosto que eu gosto\n\nQue eu gosto e que é só meu\n\nMarina, você já é bonita\n\nCom o que deus lhe deu\n\nMe aborreci, me zanguei\n\nJá não posso falar\n\nE quando eu me zango, marina\n\nNão sei perdoar\n\nEu já desculpei muita coisa\n\nVocê não arranjava outra igual\n\nDesculpe, marina, morena\n\nMas eu tô de mal…\n\nDe mal com você\n\nDe mal com você.\n\nMain Sources: A Canção no Tempo: 85 Anos de Músicas Brasileiras vol. 1: 1901 – 1957 by Jairo Severiano and Zuza Homem de Mello, and Dorival Caymmi: O Mar e o Tempo, by Stella Caymmi.\n\nPublished by lyricalbrazil\n\nMy name is Victoria Broadus and I'm currently living in Oberlin, Ohio, where I teach Latin American History at Oberlin College. I learned Portuguese while working toward a Master's degree at Georgetown back in 2008/09, which is also when I began traveling to Brazil. I started this site in late 2011 when I was living in New York City, missing Brazil but fortunate to be surrounded by lots of great opportunities to hear Brazilian music. I wanted to share that music with friends and family and any other readers out there who wonder what the songs they're listening to are saying, and why. From 2012-2017 I lived in Brazil -- first São Paulo for a year, then Rio for nearly five -- before coming back to the United States for my PhD program at Georgetown, which I completed in June 2023.
