He wrote his first hit for Carmen Miranda in the 1930s and lived on to become a grand old man of Brazilian culture.\n\nHe was born in 1914 in Salvador in the state of Bahia in north-eastern Brazil. He took up the guitar and was still in his teens when he wrote O Que ? Que a Baiana Tem? (“What is it about Brazilian Women?”), which was subsequently recorded by Miranda in 1938 and which helped her on her way to becoming a Hollywood star.\n\nThe song also established a romantic pattern."
