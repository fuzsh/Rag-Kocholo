        "text": "Rio de Janeiro, 1939. Carmen Miranda was about to have a fit. Two weeks before filming “Banana da Terra,” which would soon become her sixth and second-to-last Brazilian movie made on her adopted soil (Miranda was Portuguese-born) before bombshell stardom in Hollywood, the producer had yet to choose one final song. At the last minute, a twenty-five-year-old, unknown musician from Bahia, Dorival Caymmi, auditioned his “O que é que a baiana tem?” [what is it that makes baianas so charming?]. “O que é que…” became the movie’s biggest hit. Caymmi had the chance to make an appearance in the movie and to record his first record, a vinyl hit, playing his guitar and singing along with South America’s greatest star. All the copies of the “Banana da Terra” were lost, only “O que é que…” performed by the exuberant hip-swaying Miranda in Bahia-style costume was saved. Watch it on YouTube. Miranda and Caymmi remained friends forever.\n\nSang, danced and loved by Brazilians, young and old, “O que é que…,” included in Miranda’s first Hollywood film “Down Argentine Way” (1940), became a Miranda standard and the first authentic Brazilian music to top the U.S. charts. “O que é que…” was the first of many iconic tunes by the baiano composer with a powerful baritone voice, accompanied by the melodious plucking of his guitar, who topped the pantheon of Brazilian music with his storytelling samba baiano in the folk tradition.\n\nAccording to Ben Ratliff, music critic of The New York Times, Caymmi remains one of Brazil’s most popular musicians, second only to his dear friend Bossa Nova’s Tom Jobim, collaborator in several MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) classics, such as the 1964 vinyl “Caymmi visita Tom” (Caymmi visits Tom), with “Das Rosas”(“Roses and Roses”). Here, some verses translated by American lyricist Ray Gilbert, recorded by the great Sarah Vaughan in her 1978 RCA Victor album “O som brasileiro de Sarah Vaughan”:\n\nRoses, roses, roses\n\nI thank all the roses\n\nThat bloom in the spring\n\nlove is a wonderful thing\n\nThe rest of my life\n\nI will bring\n\nHer roses, and roses and roses of love\n\nThe peaceful-spirited self-taught musician, a charismatic womanizer, also sang with Josephine Baker, Andy Williams and in 1957 with Louis Armstrong at Rio’s Copacabana Palace. He met Walt Disney, willing to use some songs for his animation films to help foment Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy (1933-1945). Appreciated by heads of state, respected by both popular and classical musicians and adored by the public, the man who made love to Bahia in his lovely lyrics and died a nonagenarian in 2005, was also, few remember, a talented painter in his spare time. Marcelo Pallotta, founder of São Paulo’s primary market gallery MaPa, participates this week in the third edition of the ArPa Art Fair at the Pacaembu stadium venue, bringing vintage Afro-Brazilian modernist art, among them a rare selection of Caymmi’s oil paintings.\n\nCoincidently, while I was finishing this piece, his beloved 1957 hit, “Eu Vou p’ra Maracangalha” (“I’m off to Maracangalha”), with its joyful samba rhythm, played on the radio in a piano and drum version. I love it!\n\nMarcelo, first tell us about the focus of your stand in this edition of São Paulo’s ArPa art fair.\n\nIn the present edition we bring the Afro-Brazilian modernism of the 1950s to early 1980s focused on the works of João Alves Oliveira da Silva (1906-1970), tapestry artist Rubico (1906-1970), Sante Scaldaferri (1928-2016) and Dorival Caymmi (1914-2008), who are all from Bahia, except for muralist Sebastião Januário (b. 1939) and Tomás Santa Rosa (1909-1956), a painter, set and costume designer who died in New Delhi. The influence of Afro-Brazilian art is very much alive in contemporary Brazilian art in the genre known as Afro-Futurism.\n\nWhat was going on in Bahia that helped foster the new movement in the arts?\n\nAfter WWII, the redemocratization promoted by Vargas in Brazil in 1945 opened the way for new ideas. Salvador, Brazil’s first capital from 1549 to 1763, became a model of art and education with the founding of the University of Bahia (UB), headed by visionary and humanist dean Edgard Santos, a professor and medical doctor, who invited European intellectuals and avant-garde artists (among them composer Igor Stravinsky), who had trouble finding work in post-war Europe and had socialist or communist ideas of change in mind, to teach at UB. African-American writer James Baldwin visited Bahia. French photographer Pierre Verger and Argentinean artist Carybé moved to Bahia. Along with American pop culture of the 1960s, this cultural exchange was ingrained in the country’s culture and fomented the new wave of artistic ideas of the sixties and seventies such as the Cinema Novo (New Cinema: Glauber Rocha and Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Tropicalism in music (Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Os Mutantes) and the founding in 1960 of the Museum of Modern Art of Bahia in Salvador, officializing modern art in the state, designed by Italian-Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, who also designed the MASP in São Paulo.\n\nWhat are the main characteristics of Afro-Brazilian modernist art?\n\nIt stems from groundbreaking movements: Italian Futurism and French Cubism blended with the ideas of the Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922 (Week of Modern Art of 1922) and elements of Bahia’s rich Afro-Brazilian cultural legacy that emancipates our modernism from its European roots.\n\nNow let’s talk about the late mythical composer Dorival Caymmi, who was also a painter.\n\nPainting was an introspective act of joy to channel another facet of his feelings. Caymmi painted since he was a kid and was also a talented musician with a beautiful baritone voice. In truth, he wished to be a painter but moved on to music, which soon made him an icon of Brazilian MPB (Popular Brazilian Music). His songs became national hits, he composed classics of Brazilian music, made a lot of money and was admired from north to south and among rich and poor from the intellectual elite to a simple man. Much like his lyrics, which told stories easy to understand and conveyed a wide array of emotions, the main themes of his paintings were the sea, the fishermen, the jangada raft, the saveiro fishing boat, palm trees, and the love for the women from Bahia with their warm cinnamon-color skin. He was admired by the period’s most important artists: he attended classes by Clóvis Graciano and Francisco Rebolo, and befriended Carybé, Portinari and Di Cavalcanti, all of them major names of Brazilian modern art. But he had no time for a career in the visual arts because of his phenomenal music career. This was a guy with extraordinary charisma, a Brazilian legend, admired for being a multitalented, sensitive man of the people, who sang, composed, played the guitar beautifully and praised his Afro-Brazilian roots by blending the interracial elements of our culture throughout his seventy-year career.\n\nFinally, what can you say about his paintings?\n\nOne of Caymmi’s quotes on painting says: “I listened to the discussions between abstractionism and figurative art but never reached an opinion. In painting I’m a lyric. I love the harmony of colors. On the other hand, I can’t move away from form.” He admired impressionism and the post-impressionist Paul Cézanne. He painted the Bahia of his songs with a naïve feel and a preference for blue and brown hues. Painting relaxed him in between his tours for large crowds. He never belonged to any gallery—only twice he showed his work commercially in Rio—they were all sold but he didn’t feel at ease with the demands of the art market and dropped out. He already had enough demands from the music business. He didn’t need the money, instead, he preferred giving his paintings away to his friends. When he was out of canvases he painted a painting on top of the other. Dori Caymmi, his celebrated musician son, tells his sister Nana Caymmi, a celebrated singer, [that he] found out years later that a beautiful portrait their dad had made of her when she was a child had been painted over. In 1947, writer Jorge Amado, who symbolizes Brazil’s literature on baianidade (love for things from Bahia), said about his close friend: “I don’t know of any artist above Dorival Caymmi among the baianos who write, paint, sculpt or compose.” Dorival Caymmi was a larger-than-life figure. Newspapers wrote [that] Caymmi “paints his music.”"
