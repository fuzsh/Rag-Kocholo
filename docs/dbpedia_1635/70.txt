Half-Life was the sixth episode of Series 9 of Doctor Who.

Synopsis[]

The year is 2047; government officials and parties across New Yugoslavia have been in a continuous political battle for weeks now. The country stands on the brink of nuclear war, which could be initiated at any moment, with armies preparing their weapons, missiles and nukes.

But then...!

The Croatians have struck Serbia! The war has officially begun! The Doctor, Jake and Emi materialise around five weeks into the battle on a destroyed Bosnian street. Confused by this chaos and destruction, they are soon found and taken to a military base which holds a very deadly weapon, the one to end the war and perhaps end all of humanity in just one flash.

And it’s all being prepared by a scientist obeying his leader, known simply as Aurora.
