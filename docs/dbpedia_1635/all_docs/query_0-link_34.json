Prazosin is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1988.16 It belongs to the class of drugs known as alpha-1 antagonists.\n\nRecently, many studies have evaluated the benefits of this drug in controlling the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated nightmares.4,5,6\n\nType\n\nSmall Molecule\n\nGroups\n\nApproved\n\nStructure\n\nWeight\n\nAverage: 383.4011\n\nMonoisotopic: 383.159354185\n\nChemical Formula\n\nC19H21N5O4\n\nSynonyms\n\n1-(4-Amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-furanylcarbonyl)piperazine\n\n2-(4-(2-Furoyl)piperazin-1-yl)-4-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline\n\nPrazosin\n\nPrazosina\n\nPrazosine\n\nPrazosinum\n\nExternal IDs\n\nCP-122991\n\nIndication\n\nThis drug is indicated for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure). Prazosin can be given alone or given with other blood pressure-lowering drugs, including diuretics or beta-adrenergic blocking agents Label.\n\nPrazosin does not negatively impact lung function, and therefore may be used to manage hypertension in patients who are asthmatic or patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)8.\n\nReduce drug development failure rates\n\nBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.\n\nSee how\n\nBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.\n\nSee how\n\nAssociated Conditions\n\nIndication TypeIndicationCombined Product DetailsApproval LevelAge GroupPatient CharacteristicsDose FormTreatment ofAgitation••• •••••Symptomatic treatment ofBenign prostatic hyperplasia••• •••••Management ofHigh blood pressure (hypertension)•••••••••••••••••••Management ofHypertension••••••••••••Treatment ofHypertension (htn)••••••••••••\n\nContraindications & Blackbox Warnings\n\nPrevent Adverse Drug Events Today\n\nTap into our Clinical API for life-saving information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.\n\nLearn more\n\nAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events with our Clinical API\n\nLearn more\n\nPharmacodynamics\n\nEffects on blood pressure\n\nThe pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effect of this drug includes is a decrease in blood pressure as well as clinically significant decreases in cardiac output, heart rate, blood flow to the kidney, and glomerular filtration rate. The decrease in blood pressure may occur in both standing and supine positions Label.\n\nMany of the above effects are due to vasodilation of blood vessels caused by prazosin, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance 7, Label. Peripheral resistance refers to the level resistance of the blood vessels to blood that flows through them. As the blood vessels constrict (narrow), the resistance increases and as they dilate (widen), and peripheral resistance decreases, lowering blood pressure 14,17.\n\nEffects on sleep disturbance related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\nSome studies have suggested that this drug improves sleep in patients suffering from insomnia related to nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by hyperarousal 5,6. This effect likely occurs through the inhibition of adrenergic stimulation found in states of hyperarousal 13.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nAlpha-adrenergic receptors are essential for the regulation of blood pressure in humans. Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure. Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle 18. These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure 9.\n\nPrazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation. Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure 10.\n\nTargetActionsOrganismAAlpha-1A adrenergic receptor\n\nantagonist\n\nHumansAAlpha-1B adrenergic receptor\n\nantagonist\n\nHumansAAlpha-1D adrenergic receptor\n\nantagonist\n\nHumansUPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2\n\ninhibitor\n\nHumansUAlpha-2A adrenergic receptor\n\nbinder\n\nHumansUAlpha-2B adrenergic receptor\n\nbinder\n\nHumansUAlpha-1 adrenergic receptorsNot AvailableHumans\n\nAbsorption\n\nAfter administration of an oral dose, peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 3 hours Label. There is a linear association between the prazosin dose given and plasma concentration at steady state 11.\n\nVolume of distribution\n\nAbout 0.6 L/kg 11.\n\nProtein binding\n\nHighly bound to proteins Label with 97% binding to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein 11. Prazosin is thought to be mostly (about 80-90%) bound to albumin 15.\n\nMetabolism\n\nIn animals, prazosin hydrochloride is heavily metabolized. This occurs through liver demethylation and conjugation Label. Some studies in humans or human cells in vitro show similar prazosin metabolism 7,12.\n\nHover over products below to view reaction partners\n\nPrazosin\n\n6-O-demethyl prazosin + 7-O-demethyl prazosin\n\nGlucuronide conjugate\n\n2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline + 2-(l-Piperazinyl)- 4-amino-6,7 - dimethoxyquinazoline\n\nRoute of elimination\n\nThis drug is mainly excreted in the bile and the feces Label.\n\nHalf-life\n\nClearance\n\nAdverse Effects\n\nImprove decision support & research outcomes\n\nWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.

There was no fall in blood pressure, and the child recovered without complication Label.\n\nUse in pregnancy\n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies determining the safety of prazosin use during pregnancy. It is considered a pregnancy category C drug. Prazosin should be used during pregnancy only in cases where the benefit outweighs the possible risk to the mother and fetus Label. In specific cases where blood pressure control was emergent during pregnancy, prazosin has been used and no effects on the fetus or neonate were reported Label.\n\nUse in nursing\n\nThis drug is found excreted in small concentrations in human milk. This drug should be used with caution when used during nursing Label.\n\nPathways\n\nNot Available\n\nPharmacogenomic Effects/ADRs\n\nNot Available"
