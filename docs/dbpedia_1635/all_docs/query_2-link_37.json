It isn't going to take place after 2+episodes so it doesn't fit time-line wise but the game is supposed to be just as big as Half Life 2 and Valve is pouring a lot of resources into the game.\n\nJoined\n\nAug 3, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,351\n\nLocation\n\nKansas City\n\nJDR13\n\nSasqWatch\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 21, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n41,098\n\nLocation\n\nFlorida, US\n\nNovember 23, 2019\n\n#8\n\nIt's not Half Life 3. They've been pretty clear about that.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pc...alyx-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/\n\nIt's a completely different protagonist, and it takes place before Half Life 2. In fact, they didn't even plan it as a Half Life game originally. They started using Half Life assets as placeholders during development and eventually decided to make it a spin-off.\n\nI'm still excited about this game though even if I don't play VR. If it's a success, I think it greatly increases the odds of Valve finally doing Half Life 3.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 21, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n41,098\n\nLocation\n\nFlorida, US\n\nLemonhead\n\nKeeper of the Watch\n\nJoined\n\nJune 4, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,010\n\nLocation\n\nThe Great White North\n\nNovember 23, 2019\n\n#9\n\nMaybe Valve realized that they have to start making games again now that they’re getting so much competition from EA Origin, Epic, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Google Stadia(?) all creating they’re own stores, removing some of their games from Steam and doing exclusives.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 4, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,010\n\nLocation\n\nThe Great White North\n\nLemonhead\n\nKeeper of the Watch\n\nJoined\n\nJune 4, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,010\n\nLocation\n\nThe Great White North\n\nNovember 23, 2019\n\n#10\n\nAlso this will probably be the game that pushes millions of people to buy a VR headset. It’s similar to what Valve did with HL2 and forcing people to install Steam to play it. That’s really what kickstarted steam if I remember correctly.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 4, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,010\n\nLocation\n\nThe Great White North\n\nZloth\n\nI smell a... wumpus!?\n\nJoined\n\nAugust 3, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,351\n\nLocation\n\nKansas City\n\nNovember 24, 2019\n\n#11\n\n@jd;13 - yeah, different protagonist and out of order, but if this game had come out before HL2 then this would have been HL2.

As it is, there won't be a HL 3 without Gordon Freeman. He's as much a part of Half Life as Lara Croft is to Tomb Raider or the Space Marine to Doom.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 21, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n41,098\n\nLocation\n\nFlorida, US\n\nThrasher\n\nWheeee!\n\nJoined\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n15,688\n\nLocation\n\nStudio City, CA\n\nJoined\n\nAug 18, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n15,688\n\nLocation\n\nStudio City, CA\n\nIvanwah\n\nKeeper of the Watch\n\nJoined\n\nJune 24, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n907\n\nNovember 25, 2019\n\n#15\n\nI definitely won't buy a VR headset in the near future so I'm not interested in this game specifically. But I am a fan of Half Life series and I see this as good move. I hope they are thinking about this as a test to see how people react to a HL game after all these years and if the reception is good enough, they release a true HL3 that doesn't need a VR headset to be played.\n\nLike I mentioned in another thread, and I know not a lot of pepole will agree with me, I would love to see a fully open world Half Like game set in City 17 and around it. Kind of like Dying Light (I can't wait for Dying Light 2 to come out, btw). I know that is a total opposite of the scripted, linear structure HL1 and 2 have, but I always wanted to know what it would look like.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n907\n\nDez\n\nMan with the hat\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 19, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,476\n\nNovember 26, 2019\n\n#16\n\nThis peaked my intrest since it is a new half-life game!

We seem to get these rumors every few years...\n\n13 Years Later, Valve Is Finally Giving Gamers What They Want Again\n\nThere's evidence that Valve is working on a new single player game. But is it 'Half-Life 3'? Not likely.\n\nHalf-Life 3 might actually be in development, based on a new Valve project leak\n\nHalf-Life 3 is perhaps the most-wanted FPS game ever, and a new leak from an actor seemingly connected to Valve hints at its existence.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 21, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n41,098\n\nLocation\n\nFlorida, US\n\nbkrueger\n\nNothing to see here.\n\nJoined\n\nDecember 26, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n1,991\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\n#18\n\nPlease wake me up again after the next five years.\n\nJoined\n\nDec 26, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n1,991\n\nRedglyph\n\nproud GASP member\n\nJoined\n\nAugust 29, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n11,757\n\nLocation\n\nGood old Europe\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\n#19\n\nHL3 the most wanted FPS?
