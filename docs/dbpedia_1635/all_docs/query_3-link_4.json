        "text": "Essentially, pick a side that I love.\n\nThere are 3 matches; in each, the combatants are in-character and the Half Life verse has all forces working against the Dalek. The Dalek is assumed to start at full power, without access to time-travel/teleportation.\n\nDalek vs. Xen\n\nThe Dalek must exterminate each creature from Xen, or at least exterminate the armies of the Nihilanth. The Nihilanth has the combined forces of Xen from the first Half Life, in addition to several humans for headcrab assimilation and Gordon fucking Freeman, who has each and every one of his weapons from the first Half Life. The battle takes place on Xen. Xen's denizens cannot teleport outside of Xen, but may teleport within the dimension/realm/whatever.\n\nDalek vs. The Combine\n\nThe Dalek is at it again! This time, he appears right off the train in the spot Freeman appeared. The Combine has access to all ground troops and resources seen in Half Life 2 and its expansions, as well as any air support/water support. This time, Gordon Freeman is helping the Combine. He comes with all his weapons from Half Life 2 except the \"super gravity gun\" seen at the end (So he cannot pick up the Dalek).\n\nDalek vs. Entire Half Life verse\n\nEvery single denizen of Half Life, Half Life 2, and the episodes is against the little bugger, save the Gman and his \"employers.\" He starts out in the city plaza of City 17. All the denizens of Xen not in Half Life 2/Episode 1 are located in the White Forest around the city.\n\nEXTERMINATE!!!\n\n(We really need a Dalek smiley)\n\nG-man will find a way.\n\nI have only watched the 9th Doctor Who so i don't know much about the Daleks.\n\nBut there death ray beam seems pretty powerful and i don't know if any Half-life weaponry can penetrate their shields. I guess the Advisor grubs can mind rape them.\n\nWell, I believe a Strider laser cannon could do some damage. Advisors cannot mindrape, from what we know. They use telekinesis of some kind. I'm sure objects fired from the gravity gun could hit the Dalek, since slower moving objects (Like humans) can move through the shield.\n\nThe Death Ray has been shown to have two types of fire in Cult of Skaro issue Daleks, one of which could take out houses in one hit. As well, the Cyberman wrist laser (MUCH WEAKER) can blow up a car in one shot that DOESN'T hit the fuselage.\n\nWell how many Daleks are there now? Because i know at the end of the 9th Doctor Who he blew them up.\n\nBecause if we use every single thing from Half life 2, there is a shit load of mass produced Striders in the Citadel that can take out the Daleks then.\n\nBut Daleks have spacecrafts, and i haven't seen Combine with any so i don't know."
