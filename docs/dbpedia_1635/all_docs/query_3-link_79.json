        "text": "Half-Life 3 is not in development, a Valve voice actor has said.\n\nJohn Patrick Lowrie - who worked on Half-Life 2 - has said that the limitations of motion capture technology are holding up the next game in the hit franchise.\n\n\"As far as I know they are not developing HL3 now for several reasons, among them the mo-cap issue,\" he wrote on his blog.\n\n\"What they might decide in the future depends on lots of different factors. I hope they do, personally, but it has to make sense for them.\"\n\nHe explained that motion capture works well in cut scenes but struggles to perform during interactive gameplay.\n\n\"One of the great things about HL2 is that all of the characters that you meet actually look at you when they talk to you no matter where you go or stand,\" he said. \"With mo-cap you can't do that, at least not yet.\n\n\"Once you film the actor doing something and capture that motion, that's what the character is going to do. This works great in movies, but when you make something interactive it gets way less interactive with mo-cap. So that's one of the things they're working on.\"\n\nHe added that he knows that Valve is \"thinking about\" Half-Life 3."
