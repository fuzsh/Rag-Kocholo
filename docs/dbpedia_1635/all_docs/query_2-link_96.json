        "text": "Remember the rash of celebrity deaths last year? Well this one just affected me more than all of those combined. The voice actor who played Dr. Wallace Breen, of Half-Life 2 fame, has passed away. Sad news is sad.\n\nRobert Culp died after falling in an unnamed Los Angeles park. He was 79.\n\nHe did other stuff besides utterly creeping you out as you fought your way across City 17. Did you know he co-starred, alongside Bill Cosby, on a TV show in the 1960s called “I Spy”? I certainly didn’t know that. He also played Ray Romano’s father-in-law in “Everybody Loves Raymond.”\n\nBut to us gamers, yes, he will forever be known as Dr. Breen, the Earth Administrator who tried convincing us of the futility of resisting the Combine."
