Read on below for more info about who they are and where you've seen the actors before.\n\nDavid Tennant as The Fourteenth Doctor\n\nCatherine Tate as Donna Noble\n\nNcuti Gatwa as The Fifteenth Doctor\n\nNeil Patrick Harris as The Toymaker\n\nJacqueline King as Sylvia Noble\n\nKarl Collins as Shaun Temple\n\nYasmin Finney as Rose Noble\n\nBernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott\n\nJemma Redgrave as Kate Stewart\n\nRuth Madeley as Shirley Anne Bingham\n\nMiriam Margolyes as the voice of Beep the Meep\n\nSusan Twist as Mrs Merridew\n\nCharlie De Melo as Charles Banerjee\n\nJohn Mackay as John Logie Baird\n\nBonnie Langford as Mel Bush\n\nDavid Tennant plays The Fourteenth Doctor\n\nWho is The Fourteenth Doctor? The Doctor is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in space and time in his TARDIS, usually with a companion. The last we saw the Doctor was when Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth incarnation regenerated into the Fourteenth - who, for some reason, has the same face as the Tenth.\n\nThe three new specials will see the Doctor reuniting with his former companion, Donna, while also looking to find out why his old face has returned.\n\nWhere have I seen David Tennant before? Tennant is, of course, best known for playing another incarnation of the Doctor, the Tenth, a role he played from 2005 to 2010, and then again for a one-off appearance in 2013.\n\nOutside of Doctor Who, Tennant has also starred in Good Omens, Staged, Broadchurch, Deadwater Fell, Criminal, Casanova, Jessica Jones, Inside Man, The Sandman, Litvinenko and There She Goes, as well as the films Mary Queen of Scots, Fright Night and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\nCatherine Tate plays Donna Noble\n\nWho is Donna Noble? Donna is the Doctor's former companion. She was a temp from Chiswick when she met the Doctor, being transported into his TARDIS because she had unwittingly become caught up in a plan to destroy the Earth and unleash the Racnoss.\n\nShe later travelled with the Doctor through time and space, but when she touched his severed hand full of regeneration energy, it created a Time Lord/human meta crisis.\n\nThis not only created a new half-human Doctor, who is now sealed away on a parallel Earth but also made Donna the DoctorDonna, filling her head with Time Lord knowledge. The meta crisis was killing her, so the Doctor removed her memories of himself and their travels.\n\nHe warned her family that if she ever remembered him, she would die. A brief brush with danger ensued in the Tenth Doctor's swan song, The End of Time, but Donna survived and went on to marry her boyfriend Shaun Temple, still none-the-wiser as to her time-travelling past.\n\nWhere have I seen Catherine Tate before? Outside of Doctor Who, Tate is best known for her comedy work, in series such as The Catherine Tate Show, Big School, The Office (US), Hard Cell and Queen of Oz.\n\nThe Star Beast cast\n\nJacqueline King plays Sylvia Noble\n\nWho is Sylvia Noble? Sylvia is Donna's mother, who in season 4 was seen to always be quick to put her daughter down. Since then, she's been trying to keep the truth from her secret, in order to protect her - but will she be able to stop Donna from remembering the Doctor?\n\nWhere have I seen Jacqueline King before? King is known outside of her Doctor Who work for appearing in 55 Degrees North, Coronation Street, Holby City, Doctors, Turn Up Charlie and Mammals, among other series and films.\n\nKarl Collins plays Shaun Temple\n\nWho is Shaun Temple? Shaun is Donna's husband, whom she met shortly after her time with the Doctor. He is unaware of her past, travelling with The Doctor, and so is just as in the dark as she is.\n\nWhere have I seen Karl Collins before? Collins has previously appeared in films including The Flash and Attack the Block, while he has also had roles in The Bill, Twenty Twelve, Death in Paradise, Black Mirror, This is England '90, Hollyoaks, Vera, The Larkins, Champion and Culprits.\n\nYasmin Finney plays Rose Noble\n\nWho is Rose Noble? Rose is Donna and Shaun's whip-smart daughter, who we will first meet in The Star Beast. She shares a name with one of the Doctor's former companions, Rose.\n\nFinney previously revealed that Rose is a \"trans icon - a 15-year-old trans girl with a great, supportive family\", while also telling fans to \"envision Heartstopper but fighting aliens\".\n\nAn avid toymaker herself, Rose is even more special than she realises and makes some huge discoveries in The Star Beast.\n\nWhere have I seen Yasmin Finney before? Finney is best known for her role in Netflix's teen drama Heartstopper, while she was also a guest judge earlier this year on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.\n\nRuth Madeley plays Shirley Anne Bingham\n\nWho is Shirley Anne Bingham? The latest scientific advisor for UNIT, Bingham becomes a new ally for The Doctor in the fight against an alien threat to Earth.\n\nWhere have I seen Ruth Madeley before? Madeley has had roles on a number of major TV series, including Fresh Meat, Outnumbered, Cold Feet, Russell T Davies's Years and Years, The Cleaner, Brassic and The Long Shadow. She also played one of the title roles in 2022 TV film Then Barbara Met Alan.\n\nMiriam Margolyes plays the voice of The Meep\n\nWho is The Meep? The Meep is a character first seen by Doctor Who fans in a 1980 comic story, but appears for the first time on-screen in The Star Beast and is looking for help from the Noble family and The Doctor. But what does The Meep really want?\n\nWhere have I seen Miriam Margolyes before? Margolyes has had a long, acclaimed career on both stage and screen, appearing films including Little Shop of Horrors, The Age of Innocence, Babe, James and the Giant Peach, Romeo + Juliet, Mulan, Magnolia, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Happy Feet.\n\nShe has also had roles in series such as Blackadder, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Merlin, Doc Martin and Call the Midwife.\n\nWild Blue Yonder cast\n\nNathaniel Curtis plays Sir Isaac Newton\n\nWild Blue Yonder, the second anniversary special, opens with the Doctor and Donna crash-landing in 1666, and meeting none other than Sir Isaac Newton – who's not quite a Sir yet – played by Nathaniel Curtis.\n\nFans will recognise Curtis as Ash Mukherjee from Davies's acclaimed series It's a Sin.\n\nBernard Cribbins plays Wilfred Mott\n\nWho is Wilfred Mott? Wilf is Donna's grandfather, who helped her and the Doctor in a number of their fights to save the Earth. He also supported the Tenth Doctor during his final battle with the Master, and rang in the end of his incarnation's time, as he delivered four prophesied knocks signalling his doom.\n\nThe Doctor had to take a blast of radiation to save Wilf but said it was his \"honour\" to do so. Cribbins was spotted on set filming a scene for an undisclosed episode, and Tennant said that \"although very sadly he wasn't in those episodes as much as we hoped\", the actor \"was on set with us and Wilfred lives on\".\n\nThe final scenes of Wild Blue Yonder saw Cribbins return, assuring the Doctor and Donna that the rest of the Noble family are safe and that he's keeping watch. It was the only scene Cribbins was able to film before he died last year, with the episode also being dedicated to him.\n\nWhere have I seen Bernard Cribbins before? Cribbins, who passed away last year, had a long and storied career, including an early brush with Doctor Who in 1966 film Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD. He also had roles in multiple Carry On films, The Railway Children, Jackanory, The Wombles, Fawlty Towers, Coronation Street, Old Jack's Boat and Midsomer Murders.\n\nThe Giggle cast\n\nNcuti Gatwa plays The Fifteenth Doctor\n\nWho is The Fifteenth Doctor? The Fifteenth Doctor will be the next incarnation of the Time Lord, following on from David Tennant's Fourteenth, with Ncuti Gatwa taking up the role. Gatwa has previously teased that his incarnation is \"emotionally vulnerable\", and that he \"hides it with humour, but he's lonely\".\n\nWhere have I seen Ncuti Gatwa before? Gatwa first shot to fame for his role as Eric in Sex Education, but he also starred in Barbie earlier this year and will appear in the Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris plays The Toymaker\n\nWho is The Toymaker? The Toymaker is a villain whom Michael Gough previously played in a 1966 First Doctor story. Also known as the Celestial Toymaker, the character was previously seen separating the First Doctor from his companions and forcing them to play childish games before they could return to the TARDIS.\n\nHe vowed vengeance on the Doctor for foiling his plans, and now it seems, finally, he may get it...\n\nWhere have I seen Neil Patrick Harris before? Harris is best known for his roles as the titular character in Doogie Howser, MD and for playing Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother.\n\nElsewhere, he has had roles in The Harold and Kumar film series, The Smurfs film series, Gone Girl, The Matrix Resurrections, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Uncoupled and Russell T Davies's It's a Sin.\n\nJemma Redgrave plays Kate Lethbridge Stewart\n\nWho is Kate Lethbridge Stewart? Kate is the daughter of the Doctor's old friend Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge Stewart, one of the founders of UNIT, The Unified Intelligence Taskforce. She is the chief scientific officer and leader of the organisation and has worked with the Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Doctors.\n\nAs well as appearing in these specials, she is also expected to return during the Fifteenth Doctor's first season.\n\nWhere have I seen Jemma Redgrave before?

John Logie Baird was a real-life Scottish inventor who demonstrated the world's first live working TV in 1926. He went on to found the Baird Television Development Company and invent the first publicly-demonstrated colour TV.\n\nWhere have I seen John Mackay before? Mackay has previously had roles in films such as Judy, Ammonite, Cruella and Living, as well as series including The Hollow Crown, Call the Midwife, Bridgerton and Great Expectations. He also appeared in Russell T Davies's Nolly, playing the same role of John Logie Baird.\n\nBonnie Langford as Mel Bush\n\nWho is Mel Bush?
