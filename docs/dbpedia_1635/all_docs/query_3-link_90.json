        "text": "The Doctor Who showrunner has strong words to anyone who hates the idea of showing the reality of trans people and their families on TV.\n\nRussell T Davies returned to the helm of the beloved sci-fi show last year, with his first episodes coming in the form of three Doctor Who 60th anniversary adventures with David Tennant and Catherine Tate.\n\nHeartstopper fans were ecstatic to learn the brilliant Yasmin Finney was coming on board the Tardis for the anniversary, playing the daughter of Donna Noble.\n\nIt was confirmed that the character of Rose, like Yasmin herself, would be trans, with the actress describing her as someone with a ‘great supportive family.’\n\nThere are just days to go before the public is introduced to Rose, and at a recent press event ahead of first special episode The Star Beast airing, Russell addressed anyone who might be ‘full of absolute hate’ for the character and storyline.\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk and other press, Russell was asked about the inclusion of a trans character and actor, and the Queer as Folk and It’s A Sin creator spoke proudly of the decision.\n\n‘It’s something that’s not just a Doctor Who thing for me,’ he explained.\n\n‘It’s something I and a lot of other writers are keen to do – to be progressive, to reflect more of society.\n\n‘It’s funny, in casting Yasmin there was this 15-year-old mixed-race [trans girl] – there are very few people who fit the casting and it’s like she came down from Heaven and there she was.’\n\nRevealing she was cast before she ever appeared in Heartstopper, Russell said Yasmin does ‘the most amazing job and it’s an actual privilege to work with her and get her on screen.’\n\nHe added pointedly that he knew there were some people ‘full of absolute hate, and venom, and destruction and violence who would like to see that sort of thing wiped off the screen entirely.’\n\nAnd to anyone who held those ideals, he finished to loud applause: ‘Shame on you and good luck to you in your lonely lives.’\n\nIn November last year, Yasmin proudly declared her role in Doctor Who would ‘change the world,’ saying she was ‘happy to be the representation on a show that means a lot to so many.’\n\nShe felt ‘so honoured to be seen by Russell,’ revealing to British Vogue she grew up ‘idolising’ the series.\n\nDoctor Who casting director Andy Pryor said last year that there would be plenty of inclusivity in the upcoming series, saying he likes ‘to cast as inclusively as possible, it’s more interesting.’\n\nHe added to CultBox: ‘If you can’t cast diversely on Doctor Who, what show can you do it on? It goes everywhere, on this planet and others, and you don’t want to see the same kind of people all the time.\n\n‘You don’t want it to be exclusively middle-class white people speaking with RP accents.\n\n‘So right now we’re casting more diversely in terms of ethnicity. We’re casting more disabled actors… But there’s always more we can do.’\n\nDoctor Who: The Star Beast airs November 25 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Another former Time Lord ‘making a comeback’ for new Doctor Who series"
