Digitally restored and remastered, and includes 55-minute featurette \"The Boys from San Miniato: Meeting with Paolo and Vittorio Taviani,\" trailers, and more. In Italian with English subtitles.

Italy, 1971, 87 mins.\n\nDVD | $37.95\n\nYou Laugh (Tu Ridi)\n\nPaolo Taviani/Vittorio Taviani\n\nYou Laugh (Tu Ridi) is a testament to the power of laughter directed by the famed Italian sibling directors, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani (Padre Padrone, The Night of the Shooting Stars). Based on the stories of Luigi Pirandello, You Laugh tells the story of Felice, a man who faces life, death, separation, unification, hope and fear in his quest to recover his dreams.
