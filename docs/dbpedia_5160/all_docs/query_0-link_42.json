Though frequently attending new and retrospective films at the many cine clubs throughout the city in 1961, Perpignani had not a shred of hands-on filmmaking experience and intended to turn the director down. A friend exclaimed that he must have lost his senses to decline such an offer. Perpignani then changed his mind and accepted. The decision altered the course of his life.\n\nThe American director was Orson Welles and the film was The Trial (1962), based on the Kafka novel of the same name, and according to Welles, \"the best film I have ever made.\" (1) Though something of a peregrination through the fire of Welles' harsh, dictatorial methods, Perpignani absorbed the masters' ways of working and approach to scene construction that was to endure for him ever after. It was the unlikely beginning of a five decade, multi-award winning career as one of the most revered and influential editors of film, not only in Italy but throughout the world.\n\nPerpignani's 102 films to date include Night of the Shooting Stars (1983), 11 Postino (1985) and Caesar deve moire (2012), each of which won Best Editing at the David di Donatello Awards (the Italian Oscars). Other important Perpignani edited films are Sotto il Segno dello Scorpione (1969), San Michele Aveva un Gallo (1972), La Polizia Ringrazia (1972), Le Orme (1975), Padre Padrone (1977), The Good Soldier (1982), Kaos (1984), Night Sun (1990), Fiorile (1993), Elective Affinities (1996), Marianna Ucria (1997), Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000), The Lark Farm (2007), Operation Autumn (2012), Wondrous Boccaccio (2015). Over the course of forty-six years, Perpignani cut seventeen consecutive films for iconic co-directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, essentially becoming their house editor.\n\nIn 1963, after returning to Rome from Paris, where the last six months of The Trial were edited, Perpignani was sought out, because of his experience with Welles, by another director. This was Bernardo Bertolucci who, almost exactly the same age as Perpignani, had already directed La Commare Secca (1962) and was looking for a non-traditional editor to cut his next film. Though Perpignani had never edited on his own, Bertolucci chose to work with him and together assemble shots according to rules made as they proceeded. The result was Prima della Rivoluzione (Before the Revolution, 1964), arguably Bertolucci's first masterwork, with an edit in the open spirit of the French New Wave that was as original as it was unpredictable. Perpignani would continue with Bertolucci on two documentaries for RAI (Italian national television): Il canale (1966) and the three part La Via del petrolio (1967), before the features Partner (1968), \"Il Fico Infruttuoso,\" (\"The Barren Fig Tree,\" a segment of Amore y rabbia, a film anthology, 1969), The Spider's Stratagem (1970) and as co-editor of Last Tango in Paris (1972).\n\nWhile making Before the Revolution, Perpignani also met the assistant cameraperson on the production, Vittorio Storaro, and the camera operator, Camillo Bazzoni, close friends seeking to jump start their careers as cinematographer and director respectively with short films that often played before the main fare in Italian theaters. Storaro and Bazzoni soon recruited Perpignani as their editor on these films, some directed by Bazzoni brother Luigi. Two were especially extraordinary: L'Urlo (The Scream, 1966), chosen to represent Italy as Best Short Subject at the Academy Awards and for which Storaro won the Silver Ribbon for Best Black and White Cinematography; and Rapporto Segreto (Secret Report, 1966), a stun ningly executed for:y-eight minute noirish classic that garnered Storaro another Silver Ribbon. Storaro later shot The Spider's Stratagem, The Conformist 1970) and Last Tango in Paris, the first of eigl t films as cinematographer with Bertolucci\n\nThis interview v/as part of my research for the biography of Vittorio Storaro, The Path to Light, to be published by Columbia University Press. The interview was con ducted by Silvia Gallini, a bi-lingual native of Varese, Lombardy and graduate of the AFI film school in Los Angeles. I provided Silvia with a roster of questions but it is her art and film erudition, sensitivity and innate skill as a journalist which makes the interview with Roberto Perpignani a special document in its own right. Silvia also translated the interview from Italian to English. I am grateful to her for such outstanding work. And also to Vittorio Storaro, for putting me in touch with Mr. Perpignani, who at the time was cutting Muhammad: The Messenger of God (2015), a magnificent epic shot by Storaro for two years in Iran but rarely seen in the West.\n\nIt must be added that, as Silvia so deftly elicited, the passion, candor and precision of Mr. Perpignani's recollections of his work, the personalities involved and the art of film editing against a wavering curtain of Italian movie history is something of a captivating marvel.\n\nRic Gentry\n\nSilvia Gallini: Finally, I catch you.\n\nRoberto Perpignani: I just got home; I am in Rome for two days and I am enjoying for a few hours the pleasure of feeling that I'm at home. By the way, let's use the informal mode [of Italian speech].\n\nSG: Are you from Rome originally? Where did you grow up?\n\nRP: Up until I was ten I lived in the center of Rome. My father was a photographer and he lived until I was five. Then my mother had to move and I went to boarding school for two years; then I returned to live with my mother, went on to study painting. I was going to be a painter, then a work offer by Orson Welles appeared, and though I was undecided, people told me I was crazy to give it a second thought. So I went and became somewhat a prey of the experience, because working with him totally changed any perspective for me.\n\nSG: So before you worked with Orson Welles, you had not studied cinema?\n\nRP: Absolutely not. I followed cinema as a young person (who) goes to the cineclub: I'd go watch film(s) with a friend of mine who wanted to be a director, and it was he who said to me when the offer came from Orson Welles: \"Are you crazy?! Why do you hesitate? Grab it!\" At the time I was also studying child psychology and I wanted to be a painter, so I was interested in other things. But once I started working in Orson Welles' editing room in Fregene, near Rome, cutting The Trial for six months there and then six months in Paris, I never looked back. When I returned to Rome a transformation had taken place in me: I was going to work in editing for sure.\n\nSG: Do you have any memory of Orson Welles that can help me understand how he worked?\n\nRP: I wrote on this subject. I answered questions of this kind with Roger Crittenden, from the National Film and Television School [in England], who was a great editor when he was young and is to this day someone with an uncommon lucidity in regards to film history. We are very close friends. He published a series of conversations with European editors and called the book Fine Cuts. (2) He compares European style editing with other styles, particularly the North American style.\n\nSG: Did you already know Bertolucci at that time?\n\nRP: No, I met him [later, for Prima della Rivoluzione]. I came back to Italy from Paris in February or March of 1963. I was looking for a job. With Welles I had been a mere executor, because he cut himself, so I thought that I was looking for an assistant job. I was not an editor for Welles, but his executive arm along with others like Fagiani who shared this experience. Welles used the formal register with us although he called us by name. He'd tell me, \"Faccia!\" (\"Do!\").\n\nSG: Welles spoke Italian?\n\nRP: Yes, Welles spoke Italian and was married to an Italian, the actress Paola Mori. He lived in Italy for years and had a daughter with her, Beatrice, and lived in a villa in Fregene. He had an American accent, quite an unforgettable one, incidentally, but had the language ability of expressing what he wanted to say. So when he told us to do something, we would execute it precisely as he said. Then if by accident I cut a frame of film instead of another one, he'd ask me \"Perche' ha fatto questo?\" (\"Why did you do this?\"), I'd answer instinctively, \"I thought that....\" And Welles each time would reply: \"You must not think.\" Therefore, as you can tell, it was an immensely profound experience, but frustrating each time one tried to affirm one's own participation, one's intelligence, et cetera.\n\nWhat is true is that the level of elaboration, in terms of style, content, expression, was entirely incarnated in Welles. I could risk trying to intuit it, and therefore he was right to say that I was not to think. It's also true that I had a great need to feel absorbed by what I did, but it was impossible for me to say what I was learning from Welles because of my strictly executive role. For a long time people would ask me what had I learned from Welles and I was not able to answer. What I realized later was this: he worked with two moviolas--and I work with two moviolas; Welles marked film in a certain way--and I mark it the same way. I had learned his gestures. Then 1 gave it some more thought and realized that Welles built his sequences progressively to then go to synthesis: I work the same way. Suddenly I realized that Welles had taught me to think. He had denied me to think as much as he had taught me to think! So I owe him the most important thing in the creativity of editing.\n\nSG: What a gift!\n\nRP: An incredible gift indeed. A very intense year with extremely long working days, and an incredible working energy. We hardly slept because we worked in a very tight rhythm, and so even the time itself was a different kind of time, that maybe I could call of \"intense acquisition,\" very involving.\n\nSG: And what was working with Bertolucci like?\n\nRP: Bernardo became curious when he learned that I had worked with Welles and wanted to meet me. Prima della Rivoluzione was his second film. His first one was La Commare Secca (1962) with a (story) by Pasolini and his editor (Nino Baragli) cut it. With La Commare Secca, Bernardo vigorously wanted to embrace research, experimentation, following the Nouvelle Vague. Pasolini was undoubtedly an original director with a very personal concept of directing, different from the general ways of directing that took place in those years; still, Baragli's construction was a traditional one, while the Nouvelle Vague style of editing broke any structure. So Bernardo thought he wanted to cut with someone young, someone who did not have the limitations of a traditional structure. And I in fact, having worked with Welles, had no traditional training. It is also true that I had worked under a dictatorship with Welles, and that did not work with Bernardo because he wanted me to be co-creative: he wanted me to take all the risks and use all the courage that was required.\n\nWe defined this working method early on, when Bernardo gave me a sequence to cut by myself in order to test my own creativity. We are the same age--he is born in March, myself in April 1941--and we were bound to resort to each other and collaborate to find solutions. I still owe him: the courage needed for that film helped me find my true vocation, and its joy of a free style of editing reverberated all through the '60s and the '70s for me.\n\nIt was an editing style that looked for answers that Pasolini defined in [an essay titled] \"Cinema of Poetry.\" There is another essay (by) Pasolini in which he defines Before the Revolution as \"cinema of poetry\" (3) In fact, Bernardo was a poet as well, and had won a poetry prize [the Viareggio Prize] the year before [1962, for In Search of Mystery]. So all these anomalies hinted that something absolutely different was going to take place. In some ways we were protected by the Nouvelle Vague: it showed some directions in which each one of us would go and make discoveries. So the Nouvelle Vague was not a model to copy, but a suggestion, a proposal. So our enthusiasm was authentic: we were not following a school.\n\nSG: You spoke of Bernardo's creative concept of the editing. I'm reading a quote of his where he says that he preferred long cuts.\n\nRP: To this day Bernardo and I love each other like brothers, but what you just said is contradictory, it's bullshit. I say this frankly and I would tell it to his face. If that was true, we would have never created in Before the Revolution a series of anomalies that are everything but long cuts. They are scenes that reflect the dynamics of perception of the eye, of the senses, which have no limitations. Long cuts are one stupendous characteristic of Bernardo's way of shooting; the camera caresses the characters, rides them in a stupendous way. On the other hand, when you work with such a camera style you on one hand live some things as if they could not be different, and other things, like for example Bernardo's Il Pico Infruttuoso, where there were long sequences that we worked on a lot, somewhat building, contradicting, creating effects of synthesis or emotional dynamics. Editing is part of what movies could also express with long cuts and it is simply another way to say, \"These things could be articulated this way also.\" This is something that fascinates me. I adore Bernardo's long cuts, but this has caused some people to call us \"too friendly,\" because I ended up indulging him instead of being the critical, aware editor who could bring different things to the plate. I felt seduced by his imagination. This was all reflected in our collaboration and the results it brought.\n\nIn The Spider's Stratagem there are some purely editorial inventions, and the same goes for Before the Revolution, which became recognizable experiences. This came from the fact that I felt I could jump into the game without hesitation. When I met Bergman's editor Slyvia Ingemarsson at a film seminar we gave in Norway along with [editor] Michal Leszcylowski, who edited [The Sacrifice] for Tarkovsky, she told me that she had watched Before the Revolution the day before. She said, \"It looks like a film of today.\" I looked at her intensely and asked: \"Is that a compliment, or not?\" And she replied: \"Of course it's a compliment!\"\n\nEverything that derived from that in the following years, frankly, became part of the film norm, somehow even in an instrumental way. For example the term \"jump cut\" arrived much later, and also its use in the American movies. I remember the cuts in Apocalypse Now: they are from 1979, not from 1959 (i.e., they arrived twenty years later). We used to call them, like the French, \"faux raccords,\" fake connections, but there was no real name for them in Italian. Later the expression \"jump cut\" prevailed. And by the way, I do not like that term at all. I do not think \"jump\" corresponds to the synthesis of the images that have no naturalistic continuity. \"Jump\" is much more superficial, 1 think. But by the time it became \"jump cut,\" it was not revolutionary anymore; it had become the norm, part of a \"modern\" cinema, less with ties to classic filmmaking and had become a way to re-elaborate the internal time, free associations, and so forth.\n\nI will send you something I wrote in Italian and in English for a film magazine [Bianco e Nero] of the Centro Sperimentale [di Cinematografia, the exclusive Italian national film school]. I didn't think I would write it, but then I wrote these ten pages of research, investigation, the need to go beyond the structure and to look into our abilities of creating linguistic and expressive events that do not necessarily become conventions. I owe all this to the freedom I had in the '60s. Without that freedom, I wouldn't still be writing about research--I wouldn't know what research really is. But I lived it as an essential experience. It was way harder for me to learn conventional editing, later, in the '70s. They told us then that the movies were too difficult, that the audience didn't understand them, that if we wanted to make difficult films they'd broadcast them late at night. We are talking about TV, when it became a co-producer of movies. They wanted us to talk to a broader audience--and it became a condition: we had to reduce our \"eccentricities.\" This essentially turned all cinema into a stereotype from the '80s onwards. It was never the same again. I say this with true regret. And here's a quote from the school of Cuba. On the wall here, I wrote \"Prefiero provocar el futuro.\" That means, \"I do not want to regret the past. I prefer to provoke the future.\"\n\nI doubt that you will find it, but there is something else I wrote called \"Dare Forma Alle Emozioni\" (Giving Shape to Emotions), published by Falsopiano. They asked me to put together a book of writings, and I defended myself saying that I had never written anything, and above all I am not a theoretician. When Gian Piero Brunetta came and asked me for an essay on film editing, which is in the book, telling me that he needed one for the last volume of the History of World Cinema that he curated for [publisher] Einaudi, I told him that one cannot speak or write about film editing. He looked at me and said \"Are you stupid?! With all the film editing theoreticians we've had, how can you say that?\" and I replied, \"Yes, but they are theoreticians, and I am not.\" I am someone who had experiences and speaks of the observation of the phenomenon of editing: I need to show you a sequence in order to explain to you what I mean. I can't define in words what has to be verified on a screen.\"\n\nWhen I taught a six day seminar in Padova to film students, the film history professor, who was Giorgio Tinazzi, told me: \"We are realizing that when we study film criticism and film history we comment on the result: we have it and observe it on the screen with all our attention; but we observe it from outside, while Roberto is taking us behind, inside, in the moment of the expressive definition of a choice.\" And this is editing: you can't not show a sequence.\n\nEven inside that essay I wrote for Brunetta I was forced to define word by word, image by image, what we'd seen on a screen if I could have shown it. And that is absurd. When Brunetta asked me to write the essay in thirty pages, he called me after a month to see where I was at. I told him that I was writing the thirtieth page. He said \"Oh great! So you're done!\" and I said: \"No, I am talking about Griffith.\" I was talking about the beginnings of film editing! In order to talk about editing one has to start from the Greeks, then the Byzantines, then the Renaissance, where the difference between the 1400s and the 1500s is fundamental because the point of view changed. Then photography, then finally I spoke of [Eadweard] Muybridge and all the preparatory phases that lead to cinema. So by the time when I got to editing, editing had arrived, and it gathered all the history of representation, I think. Therefore when we talk about these things I cannot ignore the fact that Piero della Francesca has a point of view different than, say, Tintoretto's.\n\nSG: In respect to Before the Revolution, was it around this time that you met Vittorio?\n\nRP: We met because he was the assistant camera on that film. Camillo Bazzoni was the [camera] operator, the cinematographer was Aldo Scavarda and Vittorio was the assistant. [After several films as an operator], I heard from [Vittorio] that he wanted to be the assistant because the film was promising. And in fact it turned out to be an experience completely out of the ordinary. Also, Scavarda had a notable experience--in 1960 he shot Antonioni's L'Avventura--and had many experiences under his belt, but above all was someone who gave to black and white a sense of great nobility and refinement, with great care for the grays, for example. His work on the grays was very refined.\n\nVittorio and I didn't see a lot of each other on that film. We got to know each other very well immediately after, because Vittorio was tied to Camillo, who was going to be a director, and his brother, who was someone of great sensibility and culture. What I remember was a very strong bond. In family terms as well [Camillo married Vittorio's sister]. And even when the shortest films were realized, Vittorio was constantly present and acted as a facilitator, defended them, encouraged them. He did all he could so that the experience would be exciting for everyone. 1 had become their editor and I once heard Vittorio say, \"I have assimilated editing from Roberto.\" He would sit next to me and tell me that he was going to be my assistant, because it was a way to enter deeply into the moments of choices, of the reasons of the construction of a scene.\n\nDo you know Antonio Monda? He organized a celebration of Italian cinematographers at the Guggenheim Museum [Conversations Between Shadow and Light: Italian Cinematography, April 6-July 28, 2001] (4) and asked me to write something about Italian cinematographers. And I told him to leave me out of it. He insisted and so I wrote it and had a great time writing it, because I discovered how much an editor is connected to the images created by cinematography (i.e., the photographic quality, the quality of the shots) all which makes up the image that appears, often mute, in the era before digital, on the screens of us editors. The image gives the starting emotion from which to begin our role of \"further elaborators.\" Therefore the relationship with the cinematographers is essential to the editor, and in fact I am close friends with many cinematographers: Vittorio, [Giuseppe] Rotunno, [Giuseppe] Lanci.\n\nAnd I have the same relationship with the musicians: the editing must create some positions so that the music can enter, respecting the due expressive timings within a story. In fact, for this film 1 am editing now [Muhammad: The Messenger of God], I met up with [A.R.] Rahman, the composer of Slumdog Millionaire, and told him that I was leaving time for the music, and he said, \"How wonderful! It's the first time I hear an editor being considerate of the film score, when usually films deny music to have its time.\" It's clear that music has a different time of perception, assimilation for listening than that of the images. So the image must allow a relationship of symbiosis with sound.\n\nSG: I wanted to ask you about L'Urlo, another film of beginnings. How was Vittorio in those days, making the short films with Camillo and Luigi Bazzoni?\n\nRP: Ha! L'Urlo is a short, a very short short. With Bach's music. Vittorio was, is, an enthusiast.\n\nVittorio has been the machine of these films. He has a tremendous mastery. In L'uomo, I'orgoglio, la vendetta, directed by Luigi Bazzoni, the same director of Le Orme, photographed by Camillo Bazzoni, Vittorio was the camera operator. To this day I can say, watching, that film, that when the camera movements are so stupendous and exciting, the editing becomes more fulfilling, more exciting. Instead of correcting things you take advantage of the beautiful things that have been made, you understand? This is the essence of how I feel about Vittorio's work.\n\nThen behind all of Vittorio's theories which belong to his persona and each one of us has his or her own theoretical dimensions, but substantially when we work together, the material that I get is of high level, like nowadays when I have in my hands the things Vittorio shot with [Muhammad director] Majid Majidi, and the film exists because there is a high concept of the photography. If you can adjust to that level, it means that you will be able to give your best, like Vittorio in the end always gave his best. It's something I say with pleasure.\n\nVittorio was emotionally a person who just had to express himself by daring, by going beyond. And this thing was shared by many who made films in those days: not only cinematographers, not only editors: there was something justifying the fact that we could feel close to one another. Nowadays in professionalism there is mutual respect, but not fraternity. There's the fact that each professional is him or herself. The really beautiful thing of filmmaking [is] made of gathering, sharing, the perception of different roles in which everyone brings different aptitudes: therefore the capacity of being a different kind of interpreter; still, with the ability of recognizing in the other the contiguous form, that which completes you--no? In fact, this was very beautiful and especially with Vittorio, for I could feel his trepidation next to me. You understand?\n\nSG: Yes, I think so.\n\nRP: You must make a little effort. Don't start from a scheme. Try to surrender. Or you'll end up writing something schematic too. If you say \"I understand,\" but then you haven't, it may be because in all of that there was something different. After all, I rely on fine arts and music, poetry, images, or suggestions that come from the world of perception--sound, intuition, spacial relations, visual beyond objectivity: our brain perceives what we don't see as well (i.e., what reality gives us to somehow complement). We see one thing but we enrich it with our own history. So objectivity is not really common to all: we perceive things differently within settings that are suggestions. An artwork is always a suggestion, a proposal to investigate and deepen. So clearly we have something that guides us; at the same time we are truly beings so called \"unique.\"\n\nAsk me something else. I always sidetrack you.\n\nSG: Back to L'Urlo: did Vittorio and Camillo work with you on the cut?\n\nRP: Yes, yes, they were always there with me. So much so that at one point, as I said, Vittorio sat next to me and told me: \"I'll be your assistant. I'll hold the pieces for you.\" One reason was that we had no money and we could not afford to hire any assistants. I also worked on films where I have to tell the director to come back in a week and I show him what I have done. But always against my will. What really excites me is to share emotions with others. When a director gets up and says: \"Good, when am I coming back?\" On one hand, [he or she] leaves me the freedom to interpret the way I want, but in truth I'd like very much to create a common invention. If it's not the case, it means that that director thinks in schemes. He thinks I'll do a job that he can somehow foresee. But when I will see him a week later I will either give him something he does not expect, or he'll think that what I did is his own work. This is true on one hand, but also not true because he did not participate in my work of interpretation.\n\nSG: Did you meet Luigi Bazzoni at the time of L'Urlo?\n\nRP: We all met each other around that time, sure. Luigi is someone I esteemed very much. I liked him a lot. Very cultured person. Cinema was not lived in a way that was ... I can't think of the word, but in a way in which it was shut off within itself, separated. There's a way to conceive any artwork as an artwork that communicates with everything else. This is something that some directors really communicate to you. For example, now I say to the director of Muhammad what Vittorio and I are doing now: \"This image reminds me of a painting,\" and I showed him a painting of Caravagggio. And he said: \"Ah.\" He did not think that Vittorio, who clearly knows Caravaggio and made a film about him, and uses him as one of his essential references, could reference that image in his film; but it was not the lighting or the photography, but the sense of drama. After all, I know art history so when I see an image I take it to all the possible references.\n\nSG: I also wanted to ask you something about Partner (1968). By the time Bernardo made this film, did you find him changed by then?\n\nRP: In what sense? Bernardo in Partner was at a phase in which he was trying to surrender to a curiosity, as if cinema had no history, no path to take into account. Partner is a film which made absolutely zero money. On the other hand, Before the Revolution made no money as well, probably not even a tenth of what it cost, no matter how little was spent. It's true that Before the Revolution was immediately adopted by the Nouvelle Vague, who spotted a personality in Bernardo that corresponded with all of them for the spirit they'd put in their films. And it's curious that much later I was invited to a convention of editors of the Nouvelle Vague. I asked them: \"Why have you invited me, the only foreigner?\" They said: \"Because you are one of us.\" I was immensely pleased, because I belonged to those editors who had worked with Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Resnais. They considered me someone who had shared the same path. And I was the youngest, because Bernardo and I were twenty-four when we did Before the Revolution.\n\nSG: In regards to the style of Partner, did Bernardo talk to you, prepare you before hand?\n\nRP: It's curious because I am not an editor who is involved with the preparation or in the writing. Still, the editing could become essential and independent starting from the footage (i.e., the footage becomes the condition to recognize the stylistic path, or of a possible style). So it's almost better if the editor arrives after the shooting takes place, so we are not working on something pre-defined, but we work on the potentialities. The editor who does not know the story and meets the film as he watches the footage, can identify and assimilate it independently from any expectation. This is something new. A potential for the growth of something new.\n\nSG: So how was the working relationship between you and Bernardo on Partner?\n\nRP: Very brotherly, of great co-division and sharing. We are talking of 1967, I think, or 1968. Forty-six years have gone by. I remember perfectly the tension while we were cutting a sequence. I remember, for example, the expressive way a character had in his way of walking, which brought to a particular cut. Then we'd cut on the reverse shot or a wider image. There was a strong sensorial identification, not a logical one. When a frame was dictated by a camera move, that camera move became fulfilling, especially if it was well done, well conceived, well photographed, well acted. And at some point you felt that that was the cinema: it was coming to life as an ever-becoming dimension, never schematic. Nothing more exciting in the world!\n\nI was supposed to edit The Conformist [1970], I began watching the footage. Then the producer [Giovanni Bertolucci, the director's cousin] called me and told me that they blamed the financial failure of Partner to the fact that Bernardo had been indulged in everything, even in his irresponsibilities. Therefore they said: \"You and Bernardo are too close friends. We must separate you. You can't make films together.\" Luckily someone I held in high esteem took my place, [Franco] \"Kim\" Arcalli. But Kim was deeply different from me because he was also a writer, a screenwriter. He had a strong expressive and logical strength, while I am more of a feeler, and became more logical later. I am an intuitive, originally, so editing for me was something like creating a painting. I had studied painting and did not know the limits that others could give me. I painted as it came. I was extremely hurt by all that, and then someone asked me to cut an action film, a very academic film, with strong elements: La Polizia Ringrazia (Execution Squad 1972). That was the first film of the Italian police genre. I cut it well, but it was very hard for me because I was used to breaking the rules at every turn.\n\nSG: The Spider's Stratagem, in 1970, (is) the first time that Bernardo and Vittorio worked together as director and cinematographer. Can you describe the basic traits of their relationship?\n\nRP: I saw that they found each other immediately. It was 16mm film, not 35. [In point of fact, The Spider's Stratagem was shot in 35mm]. There was in RAI [Radioteivsione Italiana] a group of very intelligent and you could say \"enlightened\" producers who wanted to create auteur films. Bernardo and the Taviani brothers with San Michele aveva un Gallo, (1971) benefited from this. Bernardo and Vittorio started out together, then Vittorio had to leave The Spider's Stratagem [after five weeks] because he had to work on I don't remember what [The Bird with the Crystal Plumage directed by Dario Argento, 1970], and Franco Di Giacomo took his place. [With Storar] s meticulous instruction], their two photographies blend into each other perfectly. They were able to marry the same spirit, which is where \"professionalism\" denotes when people are able to feel each other's emotions and sensitivity.\n\nI think that is one of the best films by Bernardo, with sublime acting by Giulio Brogi, by Alida Valli. And it was a literary level of fantasy; in fact the story came from Borges. Still, Borges aside, it was a story of Bernardo's land, of that world of the imagination that coincides with everything that formed you, whether it's the opera or the peasant culture: there's everything that becomes the reason for the story. It's a film that I deeply adored, the film that marked the passage from the Sixties to the Seventies. Vittorio had a capacity to enter in Bernardo's filmmaking with an extremely high level of artistic and expressive achievement. Vittorio and Bernardo's filmmaking have coincided and identified in each other for many years.\n\nSG: The pacing of The Spider's Stratagem appears more serene, completely different than that of Partner.\n\nRP: In fact, it's almost a \"cinema of maturity,\" though a maturity of youth, because the actual maturity came later, with The Last Emperor [1987]. Compared to Before the Revolution, a really important ripening had taken place. Before the Revolution was still a cinema of breakage [with tradition], while Spider's Stratagem shows an ability to share a world of expression, without turning it into a stereotype of consumerism or of mainstream cinema. It was still an elitarian type of cinema, but of an elite that was less disheveled. I remember the pleasure of discovering in Bernardo's footage the predisposition to a certain way of editing. There was a maturity of giving a sense of diversification to sequences, as if there was still a trace of experimentation, but an experimentation that had been assimilated. In Prima della Rivoluzione the experimentation is still active; one was waiting for the thrill of the discovery; in Spider's Strategem it became something fulfilled, somehow.\n\nSG: So you could say that the experimentation that Bernardo had assimilated was above all a fruit of his work with you and with Vittorio?\n\nRP: Look, I wouldn't affirm anything about anyone's growth. Bernardo had his growth, and it coincided with mine, and with Vittorio's. These were his collaborators, and they were in syntony and therefore part of that work and that season. It would be wrong to think: \"So that result is a fruit of ...\" It's always fruit of collaboration. There are some sequences where the emotions I had while cutting them coincides with the other who was next to me. I was holding the footage in my hands, but he had produced that material. If things ended up by coinciding ... There have been moments with directors in which they've told me: \"Let's do what is in the material.\" And I've told them: \"But I see other things in the material. Actually, I see more than what you and we've realized that the director was talking from a continuity that went from his imagination, to the writing and to the footage. But this continuity is broken in the editing room: a new evaluation takes place. An intelligent director at that point is open to trying new things. This means that from then on one climbs each other's stairs continuously: \"Then let's try this. If you say that then also ... and we could ...\" Then half an hour later you're talking about something that is not written anywhere. And that thing excites us and becomes the final form. This is a way of working that leads to unforeseen, unschematic forms, which constitute the real value of the finished film.\n\nKeep in mind that I have a very deep desire to do an analysis of Before the Revolution. I want to take the film and put it on the dissecting table and I want to understand a series of things. I talked about it with Bernardo and Roger. I'd like to keep considering these films not as something of the past, but as something that stayed inside of us. In this piece I'm going to send you, you'll see that if Bernardo hadn't provoked me in '63, '64 with this sense of research, of something that had to come out of our intuitive abilities, as if we belonged to a dynamic reality and not a schematic one, if he hadn't thrown me in cold water forcing me to learn to swim.... Those are passages that one carries within for the rest of one's life. To this day I face sequences as a riddle. I do not know what it will look like.\n\nPART II\n\nSG: Thank you so much for another episode of our talk. One thing to discuss is Last Tango in Paris [1972], specifically Marlon Brando's and Maria Schneider's work. How was it for you to create the rhythm of the movie with their [much improvised] performances?\n\nRP: Wait. Let's make one very important point here. If you read the titles of the film carefully, you will see that my credit is \"in collaboration with.\" Here's what happened. I worked uninterruptedly with Bernardo from 1963 up to The Spider's Stratagem. Then for The Conformist I began to watch the footage, but then the so-called \"Production\" found it opportune to find another editor (i.e., an editor with greater experience, maybe authority, more able to be interactive on a level....). What can I say?\n\nFirst of all, that the person they had decided on, Kim Arcalli, a very important name, and who was also a screenwriter. So The Conformist would have had a different history if the editing would not have been made by Bernardo and Kim Arcalli. They then worked towards destroying the structure of the script--which I had read, by the way, and probably would have respected [in the edit]--and anticipated a situation that took place much later in the script, and then the whole film ended up being a flashback. [But earlier] the producer, Giovanni Bertolucci, Bernardo's cousin, one day called me and told me, \"I must tell you that you cannot cut this film.\" I cannot tell you how hurt I was. \"You and Bernardo are too close friends,\" he told me. \"You second Bernardo in what we, as producers, consider defects, like his intellectualisms, some of his peculiarities as an auteur, and this time we have a deal with Paramount, an institution that must respect its plans for financial returns. So Kim Arcalli will cut the film.\" And after they cut [The Conformist], I watched it, and it was objectively well cut. I had nothing to say.\n\nLast Tango was the following film. Kim Arcalli got sick with that tumor, which killed him some years later. Bernardo called me. First he asked me if I was mad at him. I told him that I wasn't, and that I actually loved him very much. He told me that Kim was in the hospital for surgery, probably for a couple of weeks. He asked me if I'd go work on the film, of which they had already cut five reels. I went, worked one month with Bernardo, and cut ten reels. And I'd gotten to the end, but I slowed down before cutting the ending because I knew that Kim was about to come back and I didn't want him to find the film finished. Objectively, that film belonged also to Kim Arcalli. While he had cut The Conformist with all the freedom of revision that he and Bernardo thought they needed, Last Tango was actually written by the two of them. It would've been unpleasant for Kim to come back and find the movie completed.\n\nKim was an editor-screenwriter: he truly cut following screenwriting ideas. My editing fashion was very different (now it may be different still): I was more for style and less for content. So I worked more on the aesthetic of the film, while Kim on the content. My work with Bernardo was very beautiful, very intense. We re-affirmed our mutual friendship and esteem, and Bernardo told someone that he had found me very changed. A year and a half had gone by since The Spider's Stratagem. I had in fact gone through a devastating crisis, first of all. Film was something I had found, thanks to some directors, first of all him, with whom I worked on a provocative type of editing that would reconsider the form of cinema, not so much in an intellectual key but in a potential key. Cinema did not have to resemble itself, but could invent new ways.\n\nMaybe you have seen Sotto il Segno dello Scorpione (1969) by the Taviani brothers, or San Michele Aveva un Gallo (1972). Those and The Spider's Stratagem are cut with the style that was attributable to Before the Revolution by way of Pasolini's considerations, where he spoke of \"a cinema of poetry.\" This was a very gratifying thing--to make a kind of cinema that was not expository but a stylistic elaboration. So, when you ask me about Last Tango, I must tell you all this, or else it may seem that I am stealing someone else's work.\n\nWhen, after a month, I had basically almost finished the film, and with Kim having cut five reels and then the last one, and me having cut ten, in truth, proportionally my work was very important in there. I hadn't just \"lent a hand,\" which was probably initially the intention when Kim went in for intestinal surgery. I was supposed to be only a temporary substitution. I consider myself extremely lucky for having worked on Last Tango. The material was extraordinary. Brando and Schneider were stupendous. She complemented him 100%. There couldn't have been better conditions to make something so profoundly emotional. I can't tell you how happy it made me.\n\nSG: Is it true, though, that there was a lot of improvising by the actors?\n\nRP: I don't know. I generally don't go on sets. I don't share the time of shooting because I like to wait for the film and watch the material and let it talk to me. I have fun this way.\n\nSG: Was there a lot of difference between one take and the next one?\n\nRP: Mmmh ... It was forty-five years ago ... I can tell you that generally there were always things that were pleasant to edit. There was a richness of opportunity and of creativity generated by the material.\n\nSG: Do you remember your first impressions of Marlon Brando's performance in the dailies?\n\nRP: I was excited and moved. I must tell you that I always feel slightly embarrassed when I am asked to talk about Last Tango. I worked on it more than a lot, and at the same time 1 cannot say that 1 edited it, because I am objectively very honest.\n\nSG: And Vittorio's cinematography. Do you remember your first impressions [of that] when you watched the footage of Last Tango? How would you describe it?\n\nRP: It was sensational. Truly gorgeous. It had the courage of becoming chromatic because those were the films in which Vittorio revealed himself. The photography of The Conformist was also stupendous and marvelous. But in Last Tango, it was as if he had an extra courage, as if he had what later became his theories. The courage to create areas of pictorial color: that was a great challenge. And to work with this kind of material makes you feel that the film is not only a realistic representation but is instead something beyond, something that is interpretation.\n\nI think I told you, I am now working on a film shot by Vittorio. I told the director the other day, after five hours and fifteen minutes of viewing a cut, that we had a film. Not only did we have a film, but we had an aesthetic, too, which is marvelous. The photography is greatly important. Then there is the setting. They recreated the Mecca of the sixteenth century, Medina in the sixteenth century. They did incredible things where the aesthetic vision of Vittorio is always extremely punctual, particular and brave. The director told me, \"Vittorio has a type of courage that nobody would have.\" To enter from full sunlight into a dimly lit interior so that while you enter you watch the light exposure change. He does these things with a sort of challenging attitude, and is able to mostly win this challenge, and when this happens it's one of the most magical moments of the film.\n\nThis is one of Vittorio's assets: courage. Courage to create colored backgrounds, warm and cold color fluctuations. I have seen other people's photographies--it is useless to name them--and they are equally great photographies; yet, Vittorio has his own style. In Last Tango the photography was truly beautiful, attractive, particularly in the interiors, but the exteriors always carry a personality in the quality of the images, and with Brando and Schneider it was as if he had dressed them with light. When they are in the apartment, like the scene in the bathroom, their complexion becomes something precious. Or the idea of how to dress her or him with that coat: when photography arrives over something so beautiful, it enhances it.\n\nAnother very original thing was the empty apartment with so few elements. When you work with material of such high level, you are completely fulfilled and feel: \"I am happy to be doing my job.\"\n\nSG: Was there some challenge, some particularly difficult moment in the process of editing Last Tango?\n\nRP: I don't remember. But it all came natural. The material allowed us to ... Actually many parts were sacrificed in the final cut, especially with Jean Pierre Leaud, because the film had to find a balance. The whole film had to be harmonic, so everything had to coincide: images, acting, story, timing. I remember that the five film rolls that Kim edited were cut very well. It's funny, because at the same time, I was aware that it was someone else's hand. I tended to cut aesthetically, while he was content-oriented. He also created an aesthetic, but I looked more at harmony, while he at composition by juxtaposition. Curious thing. Then he later found a way to create a unity in our two styles. Yet, I felt it.\n\nSG: I have here a note on the color \"orange\" that Vittorio used on Last Tango. Do you know if it was created in color-correction?\n\nRP: Surely. But look, that color was there during shooting. Also because in analogic times you couldn't treat colors separately in each frame. You always had to find an equilibrium and so the work on colors and of characterizing areas with respective colors is something created on set with gels and light orientation. So in this sense Vittorio was very brave.\n\nSG: Was this color orange one of his brave inventions?\n\nRP: It was that beautiful idea of working with the sunset light, which is a great idea because it gives an effective warmth to things. If you noticed, that color is a dominant note of the film, not only in those scenes where orange light arrives, but generally there are warm colors in production design. It's funny because we are talking of a film that I saw many years ago, and the images I remember are from way back then from the moviola, not from the screen. I speak of movies the way I experienced them emotionally, as I was cutting them.\n\nSG: So you don't watch your films over many times?\n\nRP: The emotion comes from when I cut them. Right now I have in front of me the big face of a very good Iranian actor. I forgot his name. This image is here to tell me how it wants to be cut, and that's how I will hand it over. My relationship with the images happens here.\n\nSG: Do you remember in particular something about the language of the camera moves in Last Tango?\n\nRP: Stupendous. I adore Bernardo and his camera moves.\n\nSG: How would you describe them, Roberto?\n\nRP: They are an experience to which one must surrender, abandon oneself. Bernardo has an ability to \"seduce\" (i.e., to take with him the viewer). He makes you discover that that character does not exist by himself but he exists in space, in the story. So you follow that and the camera is a constant emotion and it's one of Bernardo's breathtaking characteristics.\n\nThere was a moment when Bernardo asked me, \"Do you remember \"Last Tango...,\" because I was telling him that re had to continue shooting, because he had had a period when he hit a wall. So he asked me, \"Do you remember the image in Last Tango in which Marlon ...\" and while he said, \"Marlon\"--the movie was full of Marlon!--I remembered an image in which Marlon climbs down a staircase, towards the end, and then he runs down and will then enter the room where there will be the dance. It is a frame that I adored for the movement, the courage, the beauty. He said, \"Do you remember that Marlon runs down the staircase?\" and I said, \"Fuck! That's the frame!\" I had imagined the image he was about to mention.\n\nIt was curious because Marlon climbed down the staircase to the left, then he walks under the camera and then reappeared on the right hand side, and ran down and the camera followed him, then at the end of the staircase Marlon kept running towards the hall, and the camera, which couldn't leave the forty-five degree [angle on the] dolly, is forced to stop at the end of the staircase and to watch Marlon as he disappears. It's an image of incredible beauty, which also conveys the impossibility of stopping someone. Something like this, you can only experience it when you see it, only if who conceived it truly put all of himself in the emotions to want to follow someone and then admit that they won't succeed. This is content on top of aesthetic.\n\nBernardo's camera movements are substantially always beautiful, so it's an uncommon type of cinema. It's also true that there are other directors, like Miklos Jancso whom I worked with on Private Vices, Public Pleasures (1976), who was known to do ten-minute long long-takes. He or she who lives cinema as an emotional experience is bound to involve you with his or her passion, which in the edit room asks to be respected and dressed. This is wonderful in Bernardo's films, because you feel that the editing is becoming complementary to something else. It's a way of playing with elegance, which is never superficial in Bernardo, but functional to the story.\n\nSG: What did you think of the footage of The Conformist when you saw it?\n\nRP: When I saw the footage I became enthusiastic. I loved it, and was very hurt when they told me that I wasn't going to cut it. I suffered like a dog. I was in love with the images and the story, the whole thing. I had worked in complete freedom with Bernardo, though I had to adhere to his ability to make poetry with the images. He is a poet. He is the son of a great poet [Attilio Bertolucci]. He found a way to express a part of himself with images.\n\nSG: How would you describe the images in Apocalypse Now?\n\nRP: Stupendous! Marvelous images. I adore Heart of Darkness of which the film is an interpretation. Actually, I loved Conrad too much, and this thing sidetracked me a bit. But Vittorio made me love the film, because his photography is truly remarkable. His photography is always there to give an emotional meaning, but I'm looking for a deeper, visceral type of word ... Vittorio is able to take this out of a film. This gave the film value for me. Vittorio is objectively always able to transfer on screen what the film would like to be, and he puts it into condition of being that. Which is wonderful.\n\nSG: A gift, certainly.\n\nRP: Look, let's stop to talk enthusiastically about Vittorio! Because I always take with a grain of salt all his poetic definitions and all of that which characterizes him. I've also had quite a few arguments with him. One time at the celebration of Italian Cinematographers at the Guggenheim in New York, all the Italian cinematographers were gathered, this was before Vittorio wanted them to be called \"Authors of Photography,\" and I wrote a piece for the catalogue.\n\nSG: Yes, I remember.\n\nRP: Ah, I've already told you this. At any rate, after Vittorio gave his speech he came down and asked me what I thought of it. I told him: \"What a bore!\" He was very witty, because he replied: \"Yes, but you still had to hear it in English!\" I had always seen him so attached to his ideas, so ready to call blasphemous everything that went against them, that I had missed this witty side to him.\n\nSG: So tell me, the first time you saw his images must have been in L'Urlo and Rapporto Segreto.\n\nRP: L'Urlo was directed by Camillo, who was an excellent cinematographer, but Vittorio shot it.\n\nThat was gorgeous black and white. I especially liked when you felt the pictorial ability of black and white. Black and white is a unique challenge: when the entire range of everything that color can create is recreated in black and white, color can come out reductive in comparison. Black and white is not naturalistic, obviously. Color brings with it the maximum enhancement of the so-called concept of \"realism\" because it was the post-war realism and black and white had given meaning to a reality like that of Neo-realism, which was not after aesthetic but gave back the primary emotional facts of experience, of recognizing each other through the images. Black and white gave its own non-color to experiences that lived inside memories as non-colored. \"Colored\" could mean \"absolving\" the events: this way they remained essential thanks to black and white. Vittorio was stupendous in black and white, too. Giovinezza, Giovinezza [Storro's first feature as a cinematographer, directed by Franco Rossi, 1969] was also gorgeous photography.\n\nSG: How did you see the cinematography evolve in these first films like L'Urlo and Rapporto Segreto?\n\nRP: I remember a great passion in our way of working, in all of us. Camillo was a very passionate person. Vittorio was fanatic. I worked day and night identifying completely with what I did. We were like kamikazes. Nothing like professionals: we were only passionate. And we were lucky to work in complete and absolute commitment. We did not need to justify ourselves. We had the same expression on our faces. Sometimes a dazed expression, because we often overworked. We were extremists, and this brought very important results to some of us, like Vittorio.\n\nSG: Did this extremism continue in the films following success?\n\nRP: For Vittorio it was very important to work on the films he did with Bernardo or the ones he did in America. Not counting that, from a broader perspective, as far as I am concerned, I saw cinema stop itself in its path to courage, also because editing, more than photography, received a sort of halt. The public commissioning, TV in the '70s. At the end of the '60s TV produced brave films called \"experimental cinema,\" amongst which The Spider's Stratagem, San Michele Aveva un Gallo, then Gianni Amelio with La Fine del Gioco (1970) and La Citta del Sole (1973). A lot of auteurs and directors that made beautiful films in complete freedom. Then TV felt they needed more accessible films, simpler films to broadcast during dinner, while people ate their spaghetti or their soup. It was the so-called \"cinema for all.\" And that is how the so-called \"audience\" was born. And there is a big difference between the public and the audience. The public chooses you, while the audience chooses you if you are in a condition to be chosen. And to me this meant that cinema lost its courage. This bothered me a lot.\n\nSG: How can things return to that level of experimentation and freedom in your opinion?\n\nRP: I don't remember if we spoke about this, but I am fighting like a beast to create a center for the study of the language of images and sounds, which means to relinquish everything that is conventional and ... Have you read my essay for Bianco e Nero [the oldest film journal in Italy, first published in 1937 by Centro Sperimentale di Fotografia]? You will see there that I get labor pains thinking about those years in which we were off to search for something that wasn't there yet. Now I still wish to search what is not there yet, meaning that cinema has become schematic, atrophied, while we must give it back its freedom as a means of communication. Languages are so vast, so different, so ready to dialogue amongst themselves. I am excited by how music for example can bring me to a stage of images or stories, how the image can relinquish the narrative structure. A new sense of new! Sound too, exchanging experiences in order to create meaningful music. Sound can be elaborated in a non-naturalistic way and become a creative form. And so forth.\n\nVittorio is there to prove this: the image longs to go beyond, or else cinema will tell you what are the limits to respect, and I don't want to respect any limit. My most beautiful years were those in which there were no limits.\n\nSG: Yes. The shocking thing for me is that films like The Great Beauty (2013) get awarded and represent us [Italy] in the US.\n\nRP: I almost had a stroke when I saw The Great Beauty.\n\nSG: Me too. I cried and my boyfriend fell asleep.\n\nRP: It is clear that we need to open new spaces to the imagination but above all to culture. When I hear Fellini's name mentioned in relation to The Great Beauty, frankly, I'd prefer to go watch Fellini. I wasn't crazy for all of Fellini's films, but Fellini was something authentic, while this other one is constructed, and through imitation didn't mean anything to me.\n\nWhen Bernardo got an Oscar [for The Last Emperor] the film got nine! The Academy members are imbeciles. How can you give nine Oscars to a film, while there are others that may deserve an award, too? There's a collective hysteria that takes over during the Oscars.\n\nSG: Last question: In your opinion, how do you think that Vittorio has advanced the nature of cinematography?\n\nRP: Through his personality. Today I was talking to a young assistant, a translator between me and Majid Majidi and I asked him if he knows Robert Capa. I showed him the book [of his photographs]. Of course he was affected, as it happens when the eye meets exceptional images. Vittorio did his part. I adore Diane Arbus: she did her part. Everybody in the history of representation did their part. When my director created beautiful images, which Vittorio photographed, and I told him \"It looks like Giovanni Bellini,\" he did not know who [Bellini] was, being Iranian. Vittorio has assimilated the culture of representation and painting back and forth [in history], and I recognized Bellini in an image, Rembrandt in another, Caravaggio in another one. Nothing escaped Vittorio. He assimilated all of them, carried them inside of himself, then gave himself the strength and motivation to make them live. This is the history of culture: visual, thematic, poetic, linguistic, musical ... it's something that inhabits you and then at a certain point you express yourself according to your choices, which become expressive characteristics. Vittorio is also obstinate. His work is a fruit of his constant research, his intentions, his personality.\n\nNOTES\n\n(1) Orson Welles, interviewed by Huw Weldon for BBC radio, 1962, httcp://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm, referenced February 10, 2018.\n\n(2) Roger Crittenden, Fine Cuts: The Art of European Film Editing.
