        "text": "I would like to remember Paolo Taviani with what I had written in 1977 – immediately after working with him and Vittorio in Father padrone – in the monograph dedicated to them in the Contemporanea Cinema series by Editore Moizzi:\n\nIn his novel Father Master Gavino ledda tells the story of his life: similar, at the beginning, to that of many Sardinian shepherds, taken away from school while still young and raised in the solitude of sheepfolds and pastures; but then characterized by his emancipation, through study, from the patriarchal and immutable order that held him prisoner.\n\nIn search of a story that could show the realization of utopia in reality, the Tavianis decided to make a film out of it: filming began in October 1976, and lasted 8 weeks in the solemn natural settings of Sardinia.\n\nAn uncommon experience both from a cinematographic point of view and for the relationship with such a \"different\" social and human reality, thanks also to the collaboration of numerous Sardinians both as \"actors\" and as collaborators of the troupe.\n\nA \"peasant\", \"southernist\" film, Father Master is above all a film about language:\n\nIn the first part of the film, under the harsh guidance of his father, Gavino as a child must learn to recognise, right from the start, the rustling of the oak tree, the roar of the fountain, the sound of the hooves; victim of mechanisms of segregation and exclusion that sink him ever deeper into loneliness.\n\nMusic is the starting point of Gavino's redemption, who sees his possibility of liberation only in escape.\n\n“Master Father”, a resounding success crowned by the Palme d'Or in Cannes\n\nWith military service the sound is made language; and he continues to study Latin, Greek, and glottology. Only with a clean break can centuries-old subjection be broken.\n\nEven if at the end of the film Gavino Ledda himself, as himself, declares that he had to \"return here to the village, in spite of my father\" because \"far from my lair and my people, I would go back to being mute like when I was in the tanks of Baddevrustana”.\n\nThe resounding success achieved in 1977 with the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival It certainly didn't surprise those who for years have seen Taviani as the bearers of a new way of making cinema.\n\nI was 28 years old when I had the great opportunity to be the assistant director of Father Master - and it was also the first time I worked on a film together with my wife Giovanna Cossia, assistant costume designer to Lina Nerli (Paolo's wife)\n\nAn extraordinary experience for both of us, which pushed us to \"look further\"...\n\nWhen 10 years later we started our project of \"independent video documentarians on development problems\", we took advantage of this extraordinary experience!\n\nAnd in Latin America, in Africa, in the Middle East, in Asia, every time we met local filmmakers, we discovered that they had admired and loved Padre Padrone; and this in itself constituted a link between us and realities that were so different and distant, but which had common roots in the pastoral and peasant world from which we all come."
