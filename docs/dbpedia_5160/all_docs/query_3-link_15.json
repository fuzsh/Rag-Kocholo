        "text": "For over 60 years, brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani helped to define and enrich contemporary Italian cinema. For the two-month Magical Realism series, the BFI looks back over their extraordinary body of work.\n\nDrawing on Italian politics and history, their Tuscan origins, a passion for literature and film, and an absolute belief in the magic of storytelling, the Tavianis have sculpted a unique body of remarkably diverse yet distinctly recognisable films.\n\nDemonstrating considerable ambition in both subject matter and cinematic invention (including a masterful interweaving of multiple narrative strands), their output encompasses ultra-contemporary satire, powerful allegorical period drama, haunting war stories and playful, wickedly humorous literary adaptations of (among others) Pirandello, Tolstoy and Shakespeare."
