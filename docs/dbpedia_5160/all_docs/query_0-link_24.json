        "text": "Over the last five decades, Vittorio Taviani (b. 1929) and his brother Paolo (b. 1931) have created films that explore but challenge their\n\nnative Italy. The brothers have probed political commitments, class\n\nrelations, emigration, family and fate in prize-winning features whose\n\nsubjects range from 18th century aristocrats to their restaging of\n\nShakespeare in a contemporary maximum-security prison, Caesar Must Die.\n\nTheir carefully-reconstructed scenarios have included the harsh poverty\n\nof Sardinia, war-torn landscapes of Tuscany and the new world of Los\n\nAngeles; they have drawn on sources as diverse as Pirandello, Tolstoy,\n\nGoethe, Shakespeare and autobiographical memories. Thus, they have\n\ncreated a cinematic universe that enriches perspectives established by\n\ndiverse masters of Italian cinema like De Sica, Fellini, Visconti, and\n\nAntonioni, yet with their own, very different vision.\n\nInitially attracted to journalism, the brothers were drawn into\n\nfilm by documentarian Joris Ivens with the 1960 production L’Italia non è\n\nun paese povero (Italy is not a Poor Country). Two early films here,\n\nSt. Michael Had a Rooster (1972) and Allonsanfan (1974), chart these\n\nsocial themes as they explore mirroring historical images of radical\n\npolitics and human commitment.\n\nPadre, Padrone brought the Tavianis international renown. It\n\npresents the near surreal harshness of a boy forced by his father into\n\nthe isolated life of a shepherd. An epilogue by the actual shepherd\n\nturned linguist reminds us that reality and stories are never so far\n\napart for the Tavianis, whether in reconstructions of Napoleonic Italy\n\nor fables of World War II. Indeed, realism includes the fantastic, as in\n\nGood Morning, Babylon, where two earlier Italian brothers, immigrants\n\nin America, enter the heady universe of D.W. Griffith’s 1916 epic,\n\nIntolerance as well as World War I.\n\nThe Tavianis also imbue their films with literature. The\n\nenigmatic Luigi Pirandello is a favorite source, represented in two\n\nworks in this program, Kaos and You Laugh. Yet, the brothers have also\n\nreframed foreign classics as insightful commentaries on Italian life,\n\nwhether Shakespeare, Tolstoy (Night Sun) or Goethe, whose chemical\n\ntheories provide notions of love to The Elective Affinities.\n\nOver time, the Tavianis themselves have come to embody Italian\n\nhistory and time themselves, from postwar Italy on the verge of global\n\nboom while torn by class and region, to a nation looking for identity\n\nand purpose in the past to contemporary Italy imprisoned by power and\n\ncorruption. In this program, 40 years of films allow spectators to share\n\nthis dialogue through unforgettable images, sounds and characters.\n\nProgramme\n\nSt. Michael Had a Rooster (San Michele aveva un gallo)\n\nAllonsanfanPadre PadroneThe Night of San Lorenzo (La notte di San Lorenzo)KaosGood Morning, BabylonNight Sun (Il sole anche di notte)\n\nFiorileElective Affinities (Le affinita’ elettive)You Laugh (Tu ridi)"
