        "text": "Taviani brothers, were Italian filmmakers who combined the social concerns and documentary effects of Neorealism with modernist concerns for outstanding, often poetic, visual and aural effects. The notable films of Paolo Taviani (b. November 8, 1931, San Miniato, near Pisa, Italy—d. February 29, 2024, Rome) and Vittorio Taviani (b. September 20, 1929, San Miniato, near Pisa, Italy—d. April 15, 2018, Rome) included their masterpiece La notte di San Lorenzo (1982; The Night of the Shooting Stars).\n\nBoth Taviani brothers attended the University of Pisa. They gained experience for their filmmaking work by writing and staging plays with Valentino Orsini. Inspired by Roberto Rossellini’s Neorealist film Paisà, they began to study and work in cinema. Their first efforts, often undertaken in collaboration with Orsini, were a series of documentaries on a variety of subjects. Un uomo da bruciare (1962; A Man for the Burning), made with Orsini’s collaboration, was their first feature film. It is a portrait of a murdered trade union leader, and its long tracking shots demonstrate what was to become a Taviani trademark. They made one more film with Orsini before striking out on their own in the mid-1960s. I sovversivi (1967; The Subversives) mixes documentary footage with a fictional story about the death of a leader and the end of an era for the Italian Left."
