Workforce supplied trainer Sir Michael Stoute with his first success in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp overnight.

Ridden by Ryan Moore, Workforce became only the sixth horse to add the Arc to victory in the Epsom Derby in the same season.

Bouncing back from a mysterious flop in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Workforce edged out Japanese runner Nakayama Fiesta, with French Oaks winner Sarafina in third.

Stoute, second twice in the Arc, told the BBC: "If you have any ambition from the time you start training you want to win this race.

"This horse was so impressive on Derby day, then perhaps I trained him too hard for the King George...

"I would love to train him as a four-year-old."

Moore added: "He's back to his best. We had a nice run through, he's very brave, the Japanese horse kept at him, but Workforce kept doing enough."
