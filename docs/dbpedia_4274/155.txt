Sean Kinsella of Knockhouse Stud in Kilkenny has acquired Workforce (GB) (King's Best–Soviet Moon {Ire}, by Sadler's Wells) to join his roster as a dual-purpose stallion for 2017. A brilliant racehorse for Sir Michael Stoute and Juddmonte Farms, Workforce joined a select club by winning both the G1 Epsom Derby and G1 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in his 3-year-old season in 2010. He remained in training as a 4-year-old when he won the G3 Brigadier Gerard S. at Sandown before running two high-class races in defeat when finishing second in both the G1 Coral Eclipse at Sandown and the G1 King George VI & Queen Elizabeth S. at Ascot. He retired to stud in Japan at the Shadai Stallion Station where his eldest crop are now 3-year-olds.

“He's a fine, big, strapping horse and will be the first Derby or Arc winner to stand at Knockhouse Stud,” Kinsella said. “He'll put a lot of class into his runners because he was a class racehorse himself. He'll give them plenty of power and acceleration. He'll also give them size, which is very important. He was well supported in Japan and has big crops on the ground there.”

Workforce was repatriated to Europe through agent John McCormack with the previous Japanese ownership syndicate retaining shares in the 9-year-old. Introduced in Ireland at a fee of €4,500 Workforce will join the now five-strong roster at Knockhouse that also includes Notnowcato (GB) (Inchinor {GB}), Libertarian (GB) (New Approach {Ire}), September Storm (Ger) (Monsun {Ger}) and Prince Flori (Ger) (Lando {Ger}).
