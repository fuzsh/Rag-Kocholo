Workforce, the Sir Michael Stoute-trained three-year-old, won the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe yesterday (Sunday 3 October) at Longchamp, Paris.

The record-breaking 2010 Derby winner gave trainer Sir Michael Stoute his first Arc win, after 38 years of trying.

Workforce became only the sixth horse to have won both the Derby and the Arc in the same year.

Following some bumping between runners back in the field, though Workforce wasn’t involved, connections had to wait almost half an hour before the result was confirmed.

After a 7-length victory in the Derby in June, Workforce put in a disappointing performance in the King George at Ascot.

The horse was not confirmed to run in the Arc until Thursday morning (30 September).

But Workforce, ridden by Ryan Moore, settled back in the field before winding his way through to beat the Japanese horse Nakayama Festa by a head.

Earlier in the day five-year-old Goldikova made history with a record-breaking 11th victory in a Group/Grade One race winning the Prix de la Foret.

The Freddie Head-trained Goldikova has now won more Group/Grade One races than any other European trained horse.

Ridden by Olivier Peslier Goldikova beat the Richard Hannon-trained colts Paco Boy and Dick Turpin into second and third respectively.

She now heads to California trying for a third consecutive Breeders’ Cup Mile win.
