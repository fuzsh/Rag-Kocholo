        "text": "Automation doesn’t dictate why we do things; It must dictate how we do them\n\nOctober 29, 2022 | Phil Fersht\n\n10 years since HFS introduced RPA to the industry, and we’re finally focusing on automation as a value-lever that drives business outcomes. The pandemic has shifted the automation focus from creating efficiencies in the back office to delivering immediate business impact, where talent shortages can be overcome, where digital workflows can operate despite broken supply chains, and where businesses can function effectively in their virtual and hyperconnected ecosystems.Read More\n\nEmployees are bored and fearless to move, but see real potential if their leaders realize its no longer 2005\n\nOctober 26, 2022 | Phil Fersht\n\nService provider leaders must get their heads out of the sand and challenge both their clients and their staff to raise the value of their partnerships. The problem ultimately lies with bad leadership, not bad working attitudes.Read More\n\nToday’s work mindset is destroying the very fabric that keeps great companies together\n\nAugust 26, 2022 | Phil Fersht\n\nWith such a global assault on the stability of our lives, shouldn’t this be a time when we find some solace with our colleagues? Isn’t this a time when our bosses and colleagues are people with whom we can share our concerns and find some comfort in working together? Because the more we distance ourselves from our workplace, the more we are cutting off a valuable place that can help us through these challenging times.Read More\n\nWhy many tech and business services CEOs are praying for a recession\n\nJune 05, 2022 | Phil Fersht\n\nThe IT and business services industry is likely to benefit considerably from a global recession as cost-control takes center stage, in addition to the urgent need from enterprises to migrate securely to the cloud, automate processes and get cleaner, quicker access to data. Read More\n\nIt is time to party like it’s 2019 if we’re going to save the services industry\n\nApril 17, 2022 | Phil Fersht\n\nAnyone close to the coal-face of IT and business process services engagements knows it, but few are admitting it: staff attrition is out of control and threatening to destroy the whole fabric of outsourcing if service providers fail to get ahead of it.Read More\n\nOrganizations must blow-up archaic leadership mindsets to stay relevant in post-pandemic reality\n\nFebruary 01, 2022 | Phil Fersht, Saurabh Gupta\n\nThe old way of running businesses is fast eroding as we rethink what constitutes success and ambition. These are the roles – and leadership traits – that will make post-pandemic companies much more in tune with their strategic needs and align them to their business operationsRead More\n\nFive personal changes that will make 2022 more energizing and successful than 2021\n\nDecember 27, 2021 | Phil Fersht\n\nWhat can we do to change it up in 2022, which surely will be better than 2021, which was much better than 2020?Read More"
