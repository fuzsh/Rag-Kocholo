        "text": "UNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM\n\nThis poetic sentiment is how I would describe my encounter with Caprice Arkell, co-owner of the spectacular Varian Equestrian Center located at 1275 Corbett Canyon Rd, Arroyo Grande, Ca. 93420. Simon and Caprice Arkell purchased this sprawling beautiful 200-acre horse ranch in the summer of 2023 after serendipitously viewing it on the Zillow site. Though Southern California is where they currently reside, the Central Coast has always felt like a home away from home. Simon is an alumnus of Cal Poly State University and their daughter Sophie, who is a horse enthusiast herself and currently attending Cuesta college. And Capriceâ€¦well she simply fell in love with the area! ðŸ˜ŠYes, these are all significant memories that have made the Central Coast a part of their heritage. So, what was the catalyst for Simon and Caprice becoming the new owners of the Historic Varian Equestrian Center (formerly known as Varian Arabians)? The answer is nothing short of SERINDIPITOUS! As the couple began dreaming of their next endeavor Caprice noticed the sale of the property. To paraphrase Simon, once we experienced the stunning views of the acreage and learned of its rich historical depth, we felt compelled to pursue and purchase it. As fate would have itâ€¦. one day they were galloping through their lives as established business owners and shortly thereafter they became the new owners of the extraordinary Varian Equestrian Center, founded in the early 1950â€™s by visionary and World Class Arabian Horseman Sheila Varian. Wow! What a beautiful start to a new adventure!\n\nSpeaking of adventurous, I would be remiss if I did not share HOW the Varian Equestrian Center came into existence. Sheila Varian began her famed journey as a world-renowned horseman in1961. As a gutsy young girl, she took the horse world by surprise and became the Reigned Cow Horse Champion at Cow Palace that year. Sheila became the first woman to ride the elusive Arabian horse and would go on to become an Arabian Horse Championship legend. Sheila not only had outstanding riding abilities, superior training techniques, but also became quite famous for her breeding skills with Arabian horses. To this day three of the Arabian horses that she selected from Poland in the early 60â€™s continues to produce Champion horses. In total Shiela Varian bred close to 900 horses throughout her career earning her a place in the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nThe Arkell family themselves are also very passionate about horses and share Sheilaâ€™s UNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM for these majestic animals. Their commitment is to care for and board each precious horse as if it were their own. As you enter the property grounds you get the pleasure of seeing well-groomed mares with their angelic looking colts as they graze on lush green pasture, each stall meticulously cared for by their awesome staff, trainers working diligently and patiently with each horse, and the ranch hands with smiles on their faces, all evidence of the professional and kindhearted setting that the Arkell family have cultivated. It is pure joy in motion! For those considering boarding your horse at the Varian Equestrian Center, just know that they are a FULL-SERVICE equestrian facility. From exemplarily care, highly qualified training sessions and their extraordinary on-site breeding lab, to a magnificent place for your beloved horse to RETIRE in peaceful surroundings. It all speaks of their love and appreciation of the beautiful horses and their owners who care deeply for them. Come and experience this wonderful place!\n\nWorkforce Development Program Facebook Live Stream March Luncheon Presentation\n\nSincerely,\n\nKim Wybenga"
