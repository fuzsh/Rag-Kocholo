        "text": "üì¢ Are there any organizations doing inspiring initiatives within their workplaces around wellbeing? ‚¨á Hot take in social impact: Some of the awards for best employers or most innovative cultures in Canada around mental health and wellbeing that I've been noticing are really NOT centring mental health and wellbeing at all. Two days of personal time a year really doesn't cut it, and neither are pizza days on Fridays. On the bright side, the social sector is doing some transformative things - ex: Co-operators with their inclusive wellbeing strategies made by their own staff, RBC's recent launch that centres financial wellbeing for communities, and Canadian Centre for Caregiving Excellence who is leading self-care for managers leading teams. These topics, and many more, are what we're going to cover in our upcoming Changemaker's Wellbeing Summit happening on March 20-21st, and Future of Good would like to feature and spotlight some more innovative practices around wellbeing. Please reach out to me personally if you, or anyone you know, is interested in co-leading and sponsoring a session around some incredible, inspiring work that other organizations and managers can learn from - because, honestly, it's about time we take this seriously. ‚ô• CC: Shawna Peddle, Olivia Olesinski, Liv Mendelsohn, Elvis Wong, Vishan Persaud, Eden Fineday, Katharine Im-Jenkins, Sarah Saso, CSR-P, Danisha Bhaloo-Shivji, CFRE, Caroline Cagampan-Stoute, Joanne Kviring, Shane Austin, Mauricio Rojas, Amanda Sheehan, + others! https://lnkd.in/gtGf7eHk\n\nüåü Exciting News from our \"From Strength to Strength\" Men's Mental Health and Wellbeing Conference! üåü We are thrilled to spotlight Porteous Groundworks, one of our esteemed sponsors for the upcoming conference.

It‚Äôs time to consider your options. Today, I‚Äôm enjoying a wellbeing day from HSB | UK and Ireland. Here‚Äôs four reasons why wellbeing days should become a standard practice: üöÄ Boosts Productivity: Organisations with higher employee engagement see a +22% increase in productivity. üòå Reduces Stress: long working hours are linked to approximately 745,000 deaths annually from stroke and ischemic heart disease. ü§© Improves Mental Health: Wellbeing days help combat burnout and stress, which can lead to anxiety, and depression. ü§ë Enhances Employee Retention: Replacing an employee costs around ¬£12,000 on average, making retention through wellbeing initiatives financially beneficial. 2 Questions: How does your workplace help to look after your #wellbeing? How would you spend your extra day off to re-charge? ------------------------------- ‚ôªÔ∏è Repost if you want to see more companies investing in your #mentalhealth.\n\nSometimes I think about the legacy I want to leave behind when it‚Äôs finally time for me to step away from adland, and playing some role - however small - in making it the industry with the happiest workers often springs to mind. Not just because workplace wellbeing and mental health are personal passions of mine, but also to ensure advertising is set up to thrive as our people are our greatest asset. That‚Äôs why we at the IPA (Institute of Practitioners in Advertising) are so proud to launch two new initiatives today: The People First Promise and Adland‚Äôs Wellbeing Lab. Details on both can be found at the link below. Leaders can demonstrate their commitment to their people‚Äôs mental health and wellbeing by signing their agencies up to the People First Promise and providing evidence of the excellent work that‚Äôs been done. From there, they‚Äôll be awarded a badge symbolising their duty of care to peers, current employees and future talent. According to new IPA-commissioned data, a majority (78%) of adland employees agree their workplace should be doing more to support their mental health and wellbeing. This is where the Wellbeing Lab comes in, a great repository of best-in-class resources, advice and training that anyone, at any level, can access. The Lab will continue to be updated and I hope its usefulness far outlives my tenure as president. I want nothing more than for adland to be held up as trailblazers in supporting employees, more so than the industries we compete with for talent, and hopefully these new initiatives can play some role in getting there.\n\n‚ùìHow are you taking care of your wellbeing this summer time? üíÜüèΩAs the holiday season approaches, it's essential to prioritise self-care amidst the hustle and bustle.

No, how are you really doing? Wellbeing is seldom static. Some days, we may be flourishing and feel a general sense of joy and contentment with life. Other times, we may be struggling and feel overwhelmed and anxious. An essential aspect of maintaining our wellbeing involves awareness of these ebbs and flows. It means regularly checking in with ourselves and recognising when we need to rest, seek support, adopt an alternative mindset or make adjustments to our routine. For organisations, the same principle applies. Support for employee wellbeing needs to be proactive, ensuring that help isn‚Äôt only available when a crisis level is reached. In doing so, workplaces ensure they aren't just relying on reactive responses. Rather, they are building a culture where wellbeing is sustainable."
