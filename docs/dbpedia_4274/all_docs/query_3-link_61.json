        "text": "Individual involvement\n\nWhile 30.5 percent of U.S. households have a horse enthusiast, only 1.3 percent own a horse. The other 29 percent includes individuals that either participate in horse activities or are spectators at horse events.\n\nIn Minnesota, about 680,000 households have horse enthusiasts, where about 29,000 own a horse. Many Minnesota horse owners take lessons (17 percent), manage barns (17 percent) and train horses (15 percent). Up to 14,000 Minnesota residents volunteer their time towards horse-related activities.\n\nEconomic impacts\n\nUnited States\n\nThe U.S. horse industry directly contributes $50 billion to the economy and provides about 988,000 jobs. Direct contribution refers to economic activity occurring within the horse industry itself, such as horse care or recreation. However, these direct economic activities also prompt additional economic activity outside the horse industry. As a result, the total economic impact of the horse industry in the U.S. is $122 billion and 1.7 million jobs.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThe horse industry also contributes largely to Minnesota’s economy.\n\nThe direct economic impact of the horse industry in Minnesota is $541 million with a creation of 15,113 jobs.\n\nThe total economic impact of the horse industry in Minnesota is $1 billion with a creation of 21,039 jobs.\n\nEconomic impact by breed\n\nQuarter Horses and Thoroughbreds are the two most popular breeds in Minnesota. As a result, these breeds drive the most horse-related economic activity in Minnesota.\n\nQuarter Horses and Thoroughbreds contribute 7,964 jobs and a total value added of $397 million to the economy. Value added refers to the industry’s impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nQuarter Horses and Thoroughbreds bring a total value of $693 million to the Minnesota economy, which includes the value added and the cost of goods used to produce a final product (intermediate expenditure).\n\nEconomic impact by sector\n\nHorses are most commonly used for recreational activities such as lessons and trail riding. Over 10 percent of Minnesota households participate in trail riding and 8.4 percent participate in riding lessons. These activities drive spending on horse care, activity fees and equipment. As a result, recreation in Minnesota contributes 7,181 jobs and a $341 million value added to the economy.\n\nIn addition to recreational activities, many participate in competitive horse events in Minnesota. Competition requires a variety of goods and services including training, specialized equipment and feed, travel arrangements, facilities etc. Furthermore, varying disciplines, age groups and competition levels increase the participation in competitive events and leads to differences in spending. Horse competition in Minnesota contributes 7,666 jobs and a $366 million value added to the economy.\n\nThe third major sector in the horse industry is racing. Minnesota is home to two racetracks that host about 122 live race days. The racing sector drives an array of economic activity including spending on training, breeding, jockey fees, facilities, broadcasting services and wagering. Racing in Minnesota contributes 2,044 jobs and a $123 million value added to the economy."
