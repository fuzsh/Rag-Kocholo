        "text": "As the disruption of the pandemic began to ease last year — with artists returning to the road in force and much needed revenue beginning to flow again — music executives began to talk about the new normal in a business that exceeded $60 billion in 2022, according to Billboard’s estimate of total revenue generated by recorded music, publishing and concert grosses. That’s a condition most of us in the industry understand well: the push and pull of business as usual alongside the challenges of transformation.\n\nChange was afoot. Established players left CEO positions — Motown’s Ethiopia Habtemariam; Universal Nashville and Warner Nashville chieftains Mike Dungan and John Esposito, respectively; Warner Music Group’s Stephen Cooper was succeeded by former YouTube chief business officer Robert Kyncl, whose global perspective and tech-centric focus seem to make him well suited to navigate a business grappling with the ever-growing power of TikTok. No doubt TikTok was also on the mind of Lucian Grainge when he wrote to Universal Music Group staffers in his annual New Year’s letter — a document pored over and dissected by much of the industry — of the need for a new business model to better serve music creators and the companies that support them.\n\nThe industry has talked about globalization for years, but never has it been so evident as in 2022. For the first time in 66 years, the top album on the year-end Billboard 200 was the all-Spanish-language release Un Verano Sin Ti, Bad Bunny’s fourth album, which also earned him the top position on the Billboard Global 200 Artists recap for 2022. The Puerto Rican superstar has been guided by Noah Assad, an independent manager turned multisector mogul who is Billboard’s Executive of the Year.\n\nOf course, the global success of Latin and K-pop artists wouldn’t be possible without the reach of streaming, which continues to change music. The format’s ability to connect artists and audiences across different territories is a key reason that labels are opening offices throughout Africa, South Asia and other regions as A&R executives scour the world for the next international stars. As Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer tells Billboard in this issue, “I don’t take for granted any potential A&R source from around the world now. It is a global business, more than ever.”\n\nThis year, change has also come to Billboard’s annual power list, which reinstates its original title, the Power 100. After much deliberation, Billboard’s editors and reporters have decided to hold a true mirror up to the industry, pinpointing the executives at 100 companies and organizations that exercised the most influence over the past 18 months. The team that compiled this list relied on data anywhere and everywhere it was available, with an emphasis on current market share, revenue, Billboard Boxscore tour grosses and year-end charts and rankings, which are powered by Luminate. (Our methodology is detailed at the end of this list.)\n\nOur format has also changed, focusing on an industrywide top 30 ranking of executives, followed by rankings of the top players in key business sectors. (Those who appear in the top 30 are also ranked in their relevant sectors.) We distilled the number of executives honored at each company to those with the most power. In previous years, we expanded this list to spotlight the industry’s efforts toward diversity and inclusion, as well as its overall growth. This year, though, we decided to show the leadership of the business as it is, not how we wish it would be. And it’s clear that despite all the transformation that has occurred, more is needed.\n\n—Frank DiGiacomo\n\n01\n\nLucian Grainge\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nUniversal Music Group\n\nNow that the dust has settled on UMG’s public listing, Grainge can focus solely on running the world’s largest music company — and business has been booming. In October, UMG reported third-quarter earnings of 2.66 billion euros (approximately $2.9 billion), up 13.3% year over year in constant currency, a fifth-straight quarter of growth since the company spun off from Vivendi in fall 2021. And while the label group’s market share has slipped — with a 33.57% current share in 2022, down from 37.89% in 2021 — it maintained a hold on the charts, with three of the top five most-streamed songs in the United States, six of the top 10 biggest albums of the year in the United States by consumption units and the No. 1 label of the year in current market share in Republic Records. “I think our biggest flaw is making it look easy,” Grainge says. “And trust me, it’s not easy.”\n\nUMG’s past year was as much about setting the table for future success as it was about winning. The company began to see results from its investments in several sectors: spatial audio, with almost half of UMG’s streaming consumption available in the immersive format; streamlined and expanded distribution offerings, with a new global corporate structure for Virgin and a 49% stake in independent distributor [PIAS]; expanded footprints in Africa, India and China; the acquisition of catalogs by Sting, Neil Diamond, Dr. Dre and Frank Zappa, as well as the licensing of North American merchandise rights for The Beatles; and a songwriting platform for TikTok creators, launched with Samsung and Simon Cowell, which is designed to promote new music creation.\n\nGrainge sees more work to do in the coming year. In a speech at the All That Matters conference in October, he warned about the pervasive influence of TikTok amid rights holders’ complaints about low payouts from that platform and urged the record business not to repeat past mistakes by allowing its music on outside platforms without appropriate remuneration. In a letter to staff in January, he called for an “updated model” for the music industry amid the unintended consequences of the streaming revolution, particularly the torrent of songs uploaded to every platform each day. “[We need] an innovative, ‘artist-centric’ model that values all subscribers and rewards the music they love,” he wrote. “A model that will be a win for artists, fans and labels alike, and, at the same time, also enhances the value proposition of the platforms themselves.”\n\nWhat that will look like, however, will require “collaboration with all the players in the music community,” he says. “I’m confident it can be done because it’s in everyone’s interest to move away from a model that, over time, has created bad incentives — which has resulted in an experience that is increasingly frustrating for artists and fans. Look, we’re a music company: We stand for music and artists and I’ve spent my career focusing on quality and artistry, not white noise or 31-second clips or sounds to fall asleep to. Music is important. I’m a big believer in an environment where all artists have a shot.”\n\n—Dan Rys\n\n02\n\nRob Stringer\n\nChairman\n\nSony Music Group\n\nIn Stringer’s sixth year as Sony Music’s chief executive, the label group’s current market share rose from 24.19% in 2021 to 26.99% in 2022, closing the gap between it and industry leader Universal Music Group by half compared with 2021. The gains were due in large part to massive releases by Adele, Harry Styles, Rimas Entertainment artist Bad Bunny and Beyoncé, all four of whom are up for album of the year at the Grammy Awards on Feb. 5. Despite that, Stringer says he’s not satisfied. “I would like to have Rosalía in there as well, and Steve Lacy should be in the album of the year [category], too,” he says. “I’m never happy.”\n\nWhen you look back on 2022, what do you see as emblematic of the year Sony had?\n\nIt was the spread of success — artists from a lot of countries and from a lot of my companies. And that’s always pleasing. But we can get better.\n\nHas the success of Bad Bunny influenced your vision for what popular music can be in 2023?\n\nI don’t take for granted any potential A&R source from around the world now. It is a global business more than ever. And I’m traveling more than ever. I just went to Mexico City. I’m about to go to Australia, Singapore, India and Dubai because the Middle East is opening up for music as well. North America and the U.K. are mainstays of popular music and always will be, but the records are coming from everywhere.\n\nDo you agree with recent complaints about the industry that artist development doesn’t get the attention it needs?\n\nThere’s a mythology that labels are just about slapdash, one-off hits on TikTok. That’s nonsense. Artist development is absolutely at the heart of every single A&R affiliate we have. The best thing to happen is when records kick in with artists with lots of content [already] out there, so then people discover it. Steve Lacy is a perfect example.\n\nWhat’s on the horizon for the music industry in 2023?\n\nThe socioeconomic climate is going to change some things. And I’d like to understand what it means for the sheer influx of money coming into the business — whether that stays in, if the economic headwinds go the other way.\n\n—Andrew Unterberger\n\n04\n\nRobert Kyncl\n\nCEO\n\nWarner Music Group\n\nAfter a decade as chief business officer at YouTube, Kyncl on Jan. 1 took over as the new CEO of Warner Music Group, replacing longtime chief Stephen Cooper. The Czechoslovakia-born Kyncl, who was Netflix’s vp of content acquisitions prior to joining YouTube, is expected to bring a focus on technology to the major. This is his first interview since taking the job.\n\nWhat made you want to move from YouTube to WMG?\n\nI could have gone in many different directions from YouTube. But I saw there how music moves audiences, how it transcends technologies and how it drives culture. In an increasingly digital world, we, the music industry, make people happy, sad, excited — we make them feel. That’s very powerful. WMG is the perfect size. We’re big enough to create change, but also small enough to have plenty of room for growth.\n\nWhat have you learned from your time at YouTube that you think will translate particularly well into running WMG?\n\nHow to help artists, songwriters and labels use technology to build and expand their audience and their brand. Despite having lots to learn about the A&R process, being a champion of artists and songwriters comes naturally to me.\n\nWhat are the biggest opportunities you see for the record business in general?\n\nThe world is becoming more domestic and more global at the same time. It’s fascinating. Unlike in politics, where this can be divisive, in music, different sounds and styles of storytelling are ricocheting off one another, and that’s bringing the world together. The boundaries of genre and geography have been swept away. We are a unifying force. Against that backdrop, music is the killer format for almost every type of consumer entertainment — video, film, gaming, fitness, etc. There are more and more ways for superfans to engage with music and their favorite artists, but it is yet an uncovered opportunity for all of us.\n\nComing from the digital service provider side, what do you think are the biggest mistakes labels are making? How can they better utilize what the DSPs offer?\n\nOne mistake I believe has been the pushback against adding [user-generated content] to Billboard and other charts. In my mind, UGC, whether super short like YouTube Shorts, TikTok or Reels, or longer, is the highest form of fandom and engagement. That a fan would care enough to take a song and create something new with it should be celebrated, not ignored. Without capturing the traction generated by fan-created content, the charts are only a reflection of passive consumption. And that’s an obvious miss, in my opinion.\n\nWhat have you learned in negotiating from the DSP side that you can bring to the label side in terms of licensing agreements?\n\nIn the last few years, we’ve adopted “License when you need it” versus “Do it all at once,” Super Bowl-type of negotiations. And I think that has worked out pretty well. But you can only do that if you build well-aligned, trusted relationships with your partners. I’m proud of what YouTube has done on that front in the last five years or so. Life and careers are long — it’s better to build together.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to most in this new role?\n\nProbably the music-creation side of the business and the creative process. When I was growing up, I played cello and Spanish guitar. I love music. At YouTube, of course, I had a front-row seat to watch artists like Dua Lipa go from blue flame to catching fire all over the world. I look forward to learning from people who really understand talent and help them unleash their potential. And do it over and over again.\n\n—D.R.\n\n07\n\nIrving Azoff\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nThe Azoff Company\n\nJeffrey Azoff\n\nCOO\n\nThe Azoff Company\n\nCEO\n\nFull Stop Management\n\nIn an era of music business expansion, Azoff and company remain at the forefront. For starters, it was a good year to be in the Harry Styles business, as the Full Stop Management client finished 2022 with the fourth-biggest album and the most audio streamed song released that year, Harry’s House and “As It Was,” respectively. The latter also ended 2022 as the most-heard song on U.S. radio and the No. 1 song on Billboard’s year-end global chart. Styles also grossed north of $214 million on the road — a tour that included a historic 15-night residency at New York’s Madison Square Garden. But The Azoff Company is hardly wedded to one act — or even a single business sector. Full Stop alone manages 40-plus clients, including Lizzo, the Eagles, John Mayer and Jon Bon Jovi, and added Cardi B and U2 to the fold. Catalog brand-management company Iconic Artists Group inked deals for the catalog of Stephen Stills to pair it with the 2021 acquisition of David Crosby’s, as well as the rights to assets by Nat “King” Cole and Dean Martin. Performing rights organization Global Music Rights — which represents acts such as Bruce Springsteen, Drake, Pearl Jam, Bad Bunny and Bruno Mars — has continued to exercise its clout, settling a five-year antitrust lawsuit against the Radio Music Licensing Committee in February and filing lawsuits in October against three broadcasting companies over alleged nonpayment of royalties. And the Azoffs returned to the label business by officially launching Giant Music in June with Columbia veteran Shawn Holiday at the helm, signing artists like Tay B, SwaVay, Ayleen Valentine and Cash Cobain. Through The Azoff Company, Irving is also a co-founder and co-owner of venue developer Oak View Group, which announced plans for a $3 billion entertainment district and state-of-the-art arena in Las Vegas, set to begin work this year.\n\n—D.R.\n\n16\n\nCoran Capshaw\n\nFounder\n\nRed Light Management\n\nAs the live sector roared back to life in 2022, Red Light Management — the industry’s largest independent artist-management company — provided plenty of fuel. Capshaw says approximately 250 of RLM’s 400 acts were on the road, with seven of them — Chris Stapleton, Phish, Dave Matthews Band, Luke Bryan, ODESZA, Styx and Brandi Carlile — ranking on Billboard Boxscore’s Top Tours chart of 2022 with a combined gross of over $300 million. Billboard estimates that, all told, RLM acts rang up $700 million at the box office last year, although Capshaw, who doesn’t like to talk numbers with dollar signs in front of them — or give interviews — won’t confirm the figure. He prefers to discuss his artists’ philanthropic contributions. He says Lexington, Ky.-born Stapleton traveled twice to his home state for concerts that raised upward of $4.5 million for charitable initiatives, including the Kentucky Rising flood relief benefit concert, which also featured state natives Dwight Yoakam, Tyler Childers and Patty Loveless. Stapleton also led the winners at the Country Music Association Awards in November, including a record sixth win for male vocalist of the year. RLM client Lainey Wilson took home new artist and female vocalist of the year honors, and Jordan Davis’ “Buy Dirt,” which he co-wrote, won song of the year. Carlile also made headlines when she brought Joni Mitchell to the Newport Folk Festival in July, where Mitchell performed her first full set in more than 20 years. The legend of Laurel Canyon, Calif., is also slated to join Carlile for her three-night weekend engagement at The Gorge Amphitheater in George, Wash., in June. Capshaw, whose business interests include ATO Records and stakes in a number of music festivals, including Outside Lands and South by Southwest (in which Billboard’s parent company, PMC, also holds a stake), says he’s bullish on the live business in the coming year. “Everything that has gone on sale has done really well, with a lot of on-sales to come,” he says of RLM’s planned tours. “We’re very happy that people are continuing to embrace the live experience. Fans are going to shows.”\n\n—F.D.\n\n17\n\nOle Obermann\n\nGlobal Head of Music\n\nPaul Hourican\n\nGlobal Head of Music Operations\n\nTikTok\n\nTikTok is in the midst of renewing its agreements with music rights holders worldwide — and, unsurprisingly, this time the rights holders want more from the Chinese short-form video platform as the renegotiations of those agreements enter the next phase. As Believe CEO Denis Ladegaillerie said in November, he expects a “significant increase” in the Paris-based distribution company’s TikTok payouts. The man leading those talks from TikTok’s side is Obermann, and when asked about the weather in the rooms where these discussions are taking place, he says, “We see sunshine at the end of it.” Obermann knows many of his counterparts in these negotiations, having spent over a decade at Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. “Since tech disrupted the music industry, there has always been friction, concern and a little bit of pumping the brakes,” Obermann says. “We are already paying out a lot of money to music rights holders.” Regardless of whether recorded-music companies are slow-walking deals with TikTok, its influence keeps growing exponentially. Among Obermann’s proudest accomplishments in 2022 was the meteoric rise of artists like Nicky Youre, whose feel-good song “Sunroof,” with dazy, hit No. 4 on the Hot 100; topped the Hot 100 Songwriters chart; and landed Youre a Columbia Records deal after advertisers used it in TikTok videos. The song was available for royalty-free commercial use through TikTok’s commercial music library, and it’s a case study for the kind of win-win-win Obermann says TikTok can offer. “Our ambition is to build a whole suite of music-oriented services that will help drive growth for artists, the music industry and TikTok,” he says. While he declines to discuss details, Obermann says the industry can expect more connections between TikTok and ByteDance’s music-streaming app, Resso, but refutes reports TikTok is building a full-fledged A&R department. While he confirms TikTok has “hired” a handful of A&R staff to work at its music and distribution platform, SoundOn, Obermann says the aim is to get unsigned artists to use SoundOn, which often leads to getting signed somewhere else. As for TikTok’s ongoing negotiations with the United States over data security and reports that states and colleges are banning the app, Obermann declined to comment. “I oversee music, and as a result, I am not involved in these regulatory topics. [They do] not touch my day-to-day,” he says. “What is important to me is that there is an understanding around the really important role that TikTok plays [in] the discovery of new artists and the breaking of artists worldwide.”\n\n—E.D.M.\n\n18\n\nBang Si-Hyuk\n\nChairman HYBE\n\nScooter Braun\n\nCEO\n\nHYBE America\n\nSouth Korea’s HYBE wasn’t caught flat-footed when its cash cow, K-pop group BTS, announced in June 2022 that it would take a hiatus to pursue solo projects and fulfill mandatory military service. The news dropped HYBE’s share price 24.8% the following day and, as stocks fell worldwide, contributed to $2.8 billion of lost market capitalization by October. It could have been worse had “Hitman” Bang, as he’s known professionally, not used the proceeds of HYBE’s $840 million initial public offering in 2020 to begin building a bridge to the United States and beyond. In 2021, HYBE acquired Ithaca Holdings, an umbrella company for Braun’s management firm and Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group, then made Braun co-CEO of HYBE America. (He is now the sole holder of that title.) The deal gave HYBE a footprint in the United States and helped soften the blow of losing BTS. “HYBE America is pivotal to HYBE’s future both strategically, by giving us a footprint in the biggest music market in the world, and in terms of diversifying our capabilities with key assets and talent,” the company said in a statement to Billboard. In the States, Braun client Demi Lovato’s latest album, Holy Fvck, hit No. 7 on the Billboard 200. Big Machine inked a partnership with hip-hop label Blac Noize! Recordings and scored a hit with GloRilla and Hitkidd’s song “F.N.F. (Let’s Go).” Ultimately, though, HYBE is thinking globally. In December, it launched a label, NAECO, in its third hub, Japan, and debuted an international boy band, &TEAM, with members from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. HYBE’s ace in the hole is Weverse, its in-house social media platform. Already key for promoting artists in Korea, Weverse will soon add HYBE’s artists in America and Japan, the company says.\n\n—Glenn Peoples\n\n21\n\nJulie Greenwald\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nAtlantic Music Group\n\nCraig Kallman\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nAtlantic Records\n\nOne way to know what kind of 2022 the newly christened Atlantic Music Group had is to check its stats — its two biggest labels alone, Atlantic Records and 300 Elektra Entertainment, finished the year with a combined current market share of 9.15%. Another is to look at Saturday Night Live, where three AMG artists did double duty as musical guest and host: Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion and Jack Harlow. “They don’t just give that out,” says Greenwald, who was promoted to run AMG in October. Her promotion, she says, “allows Craig to focus on Atlantic, [3EE CEO Kevin Liles] to really rock and run Elektra and 300 [and] I’m here to help wherever I’m needed.”\n\nHow is business?\n\nTo me, it always comes down to the fact that I had a great year with artists. New artists like Fred Again.., established artists like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and Silk Sonic. Lizzo was a quadruple threat — she raps, she sings, she writes her music, she won an Emmy for her TV show [on Amazon Prime], she had an incredible documentary on HBO Max and a concert special on New Year’s Eve. Plus an arena tour that sold out very fast. Jack Harlow sold out arenas and wants to tour this fall. And that is one of the most important stories that we can tell: We’re not just building artists on the streaming platforms. We’re selling the hard tickets — people are coming to their shows.\n\nHow have marketing and promotion changed in the age of TikTok?\n\nYou cannot build a campaign around TikTok. It doesn’t work. You’re building an artist campaign. You need to think about how you have conversations on different platforms where the consumer is listening to or learning about music: TikTok, or Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts. There’s so much choice out there now, and people are scattered. Our job is to grab them and remind them, “Yo, go back and listen to our record.” Because streaming is never, “Oh, we got you one time, and now we’re done.” We’ve got to keep reminding you why you should listen to us while working out, while you’re hanging out — whatever it may be. You have to have the commitment and the belief to build out the plan for 12 months. You’ve got to stay in the fight, man.\n\n—Joe Levy\n\n26\n\nQasim Abbas\n\nSenior Managing Director\n\nDavid Kestnbaum\n\nSenior Managing Director, Private Equity Group\n\nBlackstone\n\nThe global investment company has become a formidable financial player in the music industry, with $950 billion in assets under management, by spending an estimated $2.5 billion using a two-pronged approach. In 2021, Abbas backed Hipgnosis Song Management with $1 billion in funding for song and artist royalty and rights ownership acquisitions — which has become a traditional approach to investing in the music business — while Kestnbaum spent another $1.5 billion to acquire performing rights organization SESAC in 2017 and eOne Music (since renamed MNRK) in 2021, a common private equity practice, albeit one that so far is unconventional in the music industry.\n\nIn London, the Abbas-led Blackstone partnership with Hipgnosis has already spent “$600 million,” he says, to buy catalogs, income streams or both from such acts as Justin Bieber, a $200 million acquisition; Justin Timberlake, Nile Rodgers, Kenny Chesney and Nelly Furtado, as well as the estate of Leonard Cohen. Blackstone also took a stake in the Hipgnosis Song Management operation, which has led to upgrades in its asset-management systems and methodologies. And in New York, Kestnbaum says, his team has “worked closely with SESAC Music Group chairman/CEO John Josephson and its management to drive growth and equity value creation across a variety of business units and revenue streams, while integrating MNRK and production music leader Audio Network under the PRO.” Kestnbaum also says that Blackstone’s investment in Candle Media is funding the expansion of that company’s Moonbug division into a leading young children’s music streaming platform.\n\nAnd in summer 2022, SESAC and Hipgnosis raised $335 million and $220 million, respectively, through bond offerings.\n\n—E.C.\n\n29\n\nRon Bension\n\nPresident/CEO\n\nASM Global\n\nIn the last 18 months, ASM Global opened the Capital One Hall outside of Washington, D.C., and the $70 million esports/concert venue Tech Port in San Antonio, adding to the company’s portfolio of 350-plus facilities that it owns or operates — or both — around the globe. The venue giant, which resulted from the 2019 merger of AEG Facilities and SMG, also landed 17 new management clients, including the Olympia convention center in London, and is more than halfway through one of the largest recreational construction projects in the world: the 69-acre Kai Tak Sports Park in Hong Kong. Bension says the company has had its best revenue year to date, as well as individual venues reporting record years. “We put the full force of our corporate resources to bear in order for [our clients] to succeed,” he says, adding that ASM quadrupled the size of its content acquisition team and doubled the size of its corporate sponsor, global partner and marketing divisions. That growth came despite the COVID-19 Omicron variant wiping out months of events at the beginning of 2022. Conventions, a large part of ASM Global’s business, have still not returned to pre-pandemic levels, Bension says. “When you have the ability to examine metrics across such a broad variety of venues, you can see where the opportunities are,” he says. “We make money when our clients make money.”\n\n—T.M.\n\n30\n\nBrad Navin\n\nCEO\n\nColleen Theis\n\nPresident/COO\n\nThe Orchard\n\nThanks to a combination of savvy partnerships with Rimas Entertainment and G*59 Records, the labels behind streaming powerhouses Bad Bunny and $uicideboy$, respectively, and a presence in fast-growing global subgenres such as the electronic style phonk — which has become increasingly popular in Eastern Europe — The Orchard grew its current market share from 5.6% in 2021 to an impressive 7.1% in 2022. “Our strategy has always been to deliver local music globally — music from anywhere can have value everywhere,” says Navin. “Last year marked our 25th anniversary, and that coincided with also being the most successful year in the company’s history.”\n\nMore companies are offering distribution deals and preaching a global approach. How has increased competition affected your business?\n\nBrad Navin Competition is good. We don’t want to be complacent. But we won’t do bad deals. We do deals that sustain our partners and their artists’ careers as well as the company. We’re always asking ourselves, “Is that real competition, or somebody chasing market share, or an exit while the music’s in a frothy financial place?”\n\nWhat do you think is the biggest challenge the music industry will face in 2023?\n\nColleen Theis We all know there’s a staggering amount of music being released globally every day. Attention spans are short, and the [choices are] overwhelming. We’re rising to the challenge by helping our labels and artists build and solidify their fan bases, using creativity and technology to harness moments and create lasting, loyal relationships that help artists thrive.\n\nSony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said last year that The Orchard was an important part of a strategy of having “a bigger proportion of the net that’s being cast for content” at a time when so much music is released daily. How do you balance quantity with quality?\n\nNavin The Orchard has over 46 offices around the world. And deal flow is as high or higher than ever before. What we’ve seen over the last 25 years is that the kids are out there listening to what they want, where they want, how they want. We’ve got tremendous capability through our supply chain, our technology, our great employees [and] our great label partners to meet that demand.\n\n—E.L.\n\n09\n\nKevin Liles\n\nChairman/CEO\n\n300 Elektra Entertainment\n\nIn June, Warner Music Group announced that Liles, a Warner Music veteran and co-founder of 300 would run 300 Elektra Entertainment, a new entertainment group that encompasses 300, Elektra, Fueled by Ramen and YSL Records, along with four other labels, distributor Sparta and a new film/content division, 300 Studios. It was a vote of confidence for an executive who had kept 300 and its imprints racking up wins while dealing with the May arrests on racketeering charges of two of his biggest stars — Gunna and YSL founder Young Thug. Gunna, who had topped the Billboard 200 in early 2022 with DS4ever and subsequently earned two Grammy nominations, was released from jail in December after cutting a plea deal, but Young Thug, whose birth name is Jeffery Williams, remains behind bars and faces a stiff sentence if convicted of leading a criminal street gang that essentially doubled as a rap collective. In a statement to The New York Times, Liles said that YSL Records “is and always has been exclusively a recorded-music partnership with Jeffery Williams. Nothing I’ve seen has changed my point of view.” Liles also started the petition “Art on Trial: Protect Black Art” on Change.org, which urges the adoption of legislation that would limit prosecutors’ ability to “use rap lyrics as confessions,” he writes in the petition, noting that allegations in the YSL case “heavily rely on the artists’ lyrics”. The petition has collected over 81,000 signatures. As the YSL drama unfolded, 3EE worked Megan Thee Stallion’s second album, Traumazine, to an August No. 5 debut on the Billboard 200, while veteran acts Mary J. Blige and Brandi Carlile notched multiple Grammy nominations. “The recognition we received was not only a testament to the culture-moving artistry we have across our diverse roster,” says Liles, “but our team’s ability to deliver across multiple genres.”"
