        "text": "Expanding the Impact of Second Chance’s Program\n\nInvolving employers directly in Blackburn’s Second Chances program has allowed the industry to give the equine instructor specific feedback about the types of skills businesses value most (TPM Strategy 3). TRF has equine training programs like the one at Blackburn in seven other prison facilities around the country, and thanks to this program’s success, they have asked Mays and her colleagues if they could help duplicate the process elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, Mays and her team also expect to expand the program into other regions and industries in Kentucky. The equine industry will always be an important benefactor of Blackburn’s reentry talent, but recent placements have demonstrated the potential to enhance the talent pipelines of other industries, such as construction and manufacturing.\n\nMays has developed a database to keep track of where Blackburn’s former program participants are hired. She wants to see if this data shows over time that having a meaningful career reduces recidivism and also expects it to reveal which industries are the best targets for second chance employment."
