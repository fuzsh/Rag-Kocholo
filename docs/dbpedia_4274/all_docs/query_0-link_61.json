        "text": "Workforce made a striking winning debut in the opening seven-furlong maiden and the big son of King's Best was introduced into the Epsom Derby betting at 20/1 by Ladbrokes and Victor Chandler, who quote him at the same price for the Newmarket 2,000 Guineas.\n\nSlowly into stride, the Khalid Abdullah-owned Workforce still had considerable ground to make up early in the straight, but he sprouted wings inside the final furlong and a half, eventually proving six lengths too strong for runner-up Oasis Dancer.\n\nStoute's travelling head lad, Jimmy Scott, said: \"We were expecting a good run and he has done it nicely, especially considering that he was drawn in the car park. I imagine that he will run again somewhere this season.\"\n\nRider Ryan Moore was also impressed, but did his best not to get too carried away.\n\n\"He felt nice. I wouldn't say it was the strongest Goodwood maiden, but he's done it very well,\" said Moore. \"He's very straightforward and, all being well, he'll make up into a nice three-year-old.\"\n\nDual Oaks winner Sariska -- a general 14-1 chance for the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe -- pleased connections when working on the watered gallop in Newmarket yesterday, although trainer Michael Bell is keeping his fingers crossed for rain as Longchamp looms.\n\nSariska would have to be supplemented at a cost of â‚¬100,000 tomorrow week, but the main concern would be fast ground, which would lessen the chances of her taking on Sea The Stars.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Lynam is aiming his stable star Duff at the Group Two Victor Chandler Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on October 17.\n\nThe six-year-old gained a deserved success in Group Two company when gamely taking the seven-furlong Park Stakes at Doncaster on September 12.\n\nHe holds an entry in the Diadem Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot on Sunday but is likely to wait for Newmarket, which is run over his ideal trip.\n\n\"Duff is likely to go to Newmarket for the Victor Chandler Challenge Stakes. He has come out of his Doncaster run very well and he's in good form at the moment,\" Lynam said.\n\n\"I was delighted with his victory in the Park Stakes and it made up for two years earlier when he was done on the line. He idled a bit in this season's race but he was in front for a long time -- when he got in front of the stands, he picked up again.\n\n\"He's a very game horse and I think that we've seen that seven furlongs is his best trip now. He's won Listed races over six furlongs and a mile but his two Group performances have been over seven.\n\n\"We are hoping to get an invite to Hong Kong later in the year and he needs sunshine to be at his best. We are aiming at taking him to Newmarket and he should take his chance, providing the ground is not soft.\"\n\nDelegator, Main Aim, Border Patrol, High Standing and Finjaan are other notable entries for the contest."
