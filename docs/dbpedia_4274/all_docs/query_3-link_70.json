        "meta_description": "LEXINGTON, Ky., (Feb.22, 2011) – The University of Kentucky Equine Initiative and the Georgetown College Equine Scholars Program have teamed up to host the 2011 Equine Career Fair March 1 from 4 to 7:30 p.m. EST in the E.S. Good Barn on the UK campus. UK has hosted the annual event since 2009. It is designed to help equine students prepare for a career in the horse industry. The event is not limited to UK students; all students with an equine interest are encouraged to participate. The fair will open with pizza and a welcoming address by Jen Roytz, marketing and communications director for Three Chimneys Farm. Participants can then attend two breakout sessions. Elizabeth LaBonty, lecturer and internship coordinator in the UK equine undergraduate degree program, will lead a session on résumés, cover letters and thank-you notes. Additionally, Essie Rogers, director of education and welfare for the Kentucky Horse Council, will speak about networking in Kentucky’s equine community. Following the sessions, students will have an opportunity to visit with participating companies and organizations to find out more about potential job and internship opportunities. Confirmed participants include Alltech, American Saddlebred Horse Association, Central Kentucky Riding for Hope, Darley Flying Start Program, Fasig-Tipton, Gluck Equine Research Center, Hagyard Medical Institute, Kentucky Equine Education Project, Kentucky Equine Management Internship, Kentucky Horse Council, Kentucky Horseshoeing School, Kentucky Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital, United States Equestrian Federation and United States Hunter Jumper Association. “I am really excited that Georgetown College is partnering with us to host this year’s Equine Career Fair,” LaBonty said. “The past two have been attended by more than 120 students, and it is a great opportunity for students and the industry to interact one-on-one.” “We are eager to partner with UK on the 2011 Equine Career Fair and to expose students to the myriad of job possibilities in the industry, allowing them to network not only with equine entities, but with other students who share the same equine passions,” said Sarah Coleman, executive director of the Georgetown College Equine Scholars Program. Students and potential employers who would like more information about the Equine Career Fair may contact Elizabeth LaBonty at 859-257-2226 or e-mail equineinitiative@uky.edu.
