        "text": "“For centuries, humans have said to horses, ‘You do what I tell you or I’ll hurt you.’ Humans still say that to each other – still threaten, force and intimidate. I’m convinced that my discoveries with horses have value in the workplace, in the educational and penal systems, and in the raising of children. At heart, I’m saying that no one of us was born with the right to say ‘you must’ or I’ll hurt you, to any animal or to another human.”\n\nMonty Roberts International Learning Center (MRILC), located at Flag Is Up Farms in the Santa Ynez Valley, California, is dedicated to promoting gentle, more effective alternatives to violence and force through educational courses ranging from beginner to advanced levels of horsemanship.\n\nThe MRILC is unique from other training facilities because the primary focus of our training curriculum is on equine psychology and behavior rather than riding skills. Students develop a solid understanding of what motivates and influences equine behavior in order to increase their effectiveness in the application of their choice, virtually any discipline of riding, veterinary assisting, farriery, racehorse training and more.\n\nThe Monty Roberts Online University has over 700 quick and easy training and instructional videos, lesson notes, and supportive learning tools – and its growing with a new lesson added every week.\n\nLearn at your own pace with Monty Roberts. Choose the areas of horsemanship you are interested in learning or go exploring for new subjects as well. See for yourself why Horse & Hound magazine named Monty one of the Top 50 greatest horsemen of all time. Monty is recognized by our international equestrian community for his gentle and effective horse training. In addition to lessons by Monty, the Online University features lessons by a host of special guests – pioneers and/or experts in their field, and hosts an ‘Ask Monty’ Q&A forum (accessible without a subscription) where Monty posts a weekly Q&A.\n\nHorsemanship Radio is an online radio show (podcast) dedicated to the exploration of good horsemanship throughout the world. Hosted by Monty’s daughter, Debbie Roberts Loucks, the show includes segments, tips and interviews exploring good horsemanship.\n\nThe MR Online University presents this podcast on the Horse Radio Network.\n\nSince it’s live launch on Horse & Country TV in October 2020, the program has successfully re-homed fourteen horses, with the goal to have at least fifty horses transitioned to new careers through the program in the first year.\n\nIn addition, the MRTHP runs an internship program for trainers from The Right Horse adoption partners to learn the Monty Roberts methods – enabling more horses around the country to be made safe and have a greater chance of adoption in a shorter time frame.\n\nHorse Sense & Healing\n\nHorse Sense & Healing program is designed for veterans (and first responders) suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – or as we like to call it, PTSI – post traumatic stress injury.\n\nThrough Join-Up® and other equine-assisted activities, the Horse Sense & Healing program teaches participants to learn to regulate their emotions and return to their pre-war behavioral selves.\n\nSince it’s inception in 2010, Horse Sense and Healing has helped over 550 veterans and first responders.\n\nLead-Up California\n\nLead-Up® International, launched in 2017, is an original and compelling Leadership Program, developed by a team in Guatemala led by Katie Pokorny, which aims to reach vulnerable youth and create peaceful leaders through workshops with horses.\n\nThe Lead-Up program is based around workshops with horses in which participants are introduced to humane ways of handling and interacting with horses, using Monty’s principles. Participants discover non-violence and non-aggression for themselves through interactions with horses and principally through the experience of Join-Up."
