        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute\n\nAll Gathered for a Big Saturday\n\nSaturday's action sees the winding-up of York's Ebor Festival and a trio of exciting juvenile races at The Curragh and Goodwood, with the Knavesmire venue boasting the most valuable prize in the G2 City of York Stakes. Cheveley Park Stud's TDN Rising Star Audience (GB) (Iffraaj {GB}) is the star attraction in the seven-furlong feature and it is fair to say that he has turned around his fortunes this term with dynamic successes in the G1 Lockinge Stakes and G2 Lennox Stakes. He may have achieved more when winning under...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nRepole Stable's 280k Craven Breezer Benny The Waiter Set for Deauville Debut\n\nObservations on the European Racing Scene turns the spotlight on the best European races of the day, highlighting well-bred horses early in their careers, horses of note returning to action and young runners that achieved notable results in the sales ring. Tuesday's Observations features runners with American connections as well as the half-sister to dual Group 1 heroine Integral (GB) (Dalakhani {Ire}). 14.58 Deauville, Mdn, €30,000, 2yo, c/g, 6fT Repole Stable's 280,000gns Craven Breeze-Up acquisition BENNY THE WAITER (IRE) (Blue Point {Ire}), who first went through the ring for €72,000...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nLatest TDN Rising Star for Dubawi as Formal Dazzles at Newbury\n\nSimply a nice introduction and a placing would have been encouraging for Cheveley Park Stud as they unveiled their unraced homebred Formal (GB) (Dubawi {Ire}) in Newbury's seven-furlong maiden on Thursday evening, so an impressive win for the first foal out of their G1 Falmouth Stakes heroine Veracious (GB) (Frankel {GB}) made her instant TDN Rising Star material. Restrained initially by Jason Watson to race behind the leaders, the 6-1 shot was delivered to swamp Juddmonte's experienced 8-15 favourite Glistening (GB) (Frankel {GB}) without being asked a serious question at...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nPassenger 'Progressing Well' Ahead Of Intended York Return\n\nPassenger (Ulysses {Ire}) could make his eagerly-awaited return to the track in the Sky Bet York Stakes if getting the go-ahead from trainer Sir Michael Stoute. The Niarchos family-owned colt made a thrilling start to his four-year-old campaign, brushing Israr (GB) (Muhaarar {GB}) aside with a degree of ease at Chester in the Huxley Stakes. However, a setback has kept him on the sidelines since, ruling out a clash with Auguste Rodin (Ire) (Deep Impact {Jpn}) in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot and then a Coral-Eclipse showdown...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nPassenger Forced to Miss City Of Troy Clash in Coral-Eclipse\n\nThe Sir Michael Stoute-trained Passenger (Ulysses {Ire}) will miss the G1 Coral-Eclipse at Sandown on Saturday week as he continues his recovery from a setback which ruled him out of Royal Ascot. Sparingly raced as a three-year-old when his standout efforts included an unlucky-in-running third in the G2 Dante Stakes at York and a narrow victory in the G3 Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor, Passenger looked an improved model when returning from nearly nine months off with a smooth win in the G2 Huxley Stakes at Chester in May, beating...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nNiarchos Family's Passenger To Miss Prince Of Wales's Stakes After Setback\n\nNiarchos runner Passenger (Ulysses {Ire}), favoured for the G1 Prince Of Wales's S. at Royal Ascot later this month, will not participate after sustaining a setback according to the owner's racing manager Alan Cooper. Third in the G2 Dante S. and a winner of the G3 Winter Hill S. at three, the 4-year-old colt returned with a 1 1/2-length victory in the G2 Huxley S. at Chester on May 10 for Sir Michael Stoute. Cooper said, \"He has an infection and it would be a race against time to have...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nPrince Of Wales's Stakes Up Next For Improving Passenger\n\nPassenger (Ulysses {Ire}) will look to provide trainer Sir Michael Stoute with a fifth success in the G1 Prince Of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot next month following his triumphant return to action at Chester. Sparingly raced as a three-year-old when his standout performances included an unlucky-in-running third in the G2 Dante S. at York and a narrow victory in the G3 Winter Hill S. at Windsor, Passenger looked an improved model when returning from nearly nine months off with a smooth win in the G3 Huxley S. on the...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nPassenger Strikes Late to Secure Eighth Huxley for Sir Michael Stoute\n\nLast term's G1 Derby 12th Passenger (Ulysses {Ire}--Dilmun, by War Front) continued on his pathway back to the highest level when striking late to secure a record-extending eighth renewal for veteran maestro Sir Michael Stoute in Friday's G2 Huxley S. at Chester. Flaxman Stables' homebred 4-year-old settled into a smooth rhythm, within range of the leaders, in fifth for most of the extended 10-furlong test. Making eyecatching headway on the bridle into contention rounding the home turn, the 7-4 second favourite swept by last term's G2 Princess Of Wales's S....\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nDerby Winner North Light Dies At 23\n\nDerby winner North Light (Ire) (Danehill) was euthanized on Mar. 20 due to complications from laminitis, The Stronach Group announced on Thursday. The 23-year-old stallion had been pensioned since 2020 and will be laid to rest at Adena South in Ocala Florida. Bred and raced by Ballymacoll Stud and trained by Sir Michael Stoute, the son of G1 Prix du Cadran heroine Sought Out (Ire) (Rainbow Quest) won one of two starts at two, and added the G2 Dante S. and G1 Derby in succession during the spring of 2004....\n\n[ Read More ]\n\n'Everything Was Done to Try To Save Him': Derby Hero Desert Crown Euthanised\n\nDesert Crown (GB) (Nathaniel {Ire}), the brilliant winner of the 2022 Derby, has been euthanised at Newmarket Equine Hospital after failing to recover from an injury sustained on the gallops in August. \"Everything was done to try to save him, we thought he was making progress but then he just started going backwards,\" said Philip Robinson, assistant racing manager to owner Saeed Suhail. Trained by Sir Michael Stoute, Desert Crown was bred by Gary Robinson of Strawberry Fields Stud. He made just one appearance as a two-year-old to post a...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nJames Horton to Relocate to Newmarket\n\nAfter parting ways with owner John Dance, conditioner James Horton will return to Newmarket to begin training next term on his own. When leading chaser Bravemansgame (Fr) (Brave Mansonnien {Fr})--co-owned by Dance--was barred from running in the Aintree Grand National meeting early this year, the horse was later allowed to continue his career when Bryan Drew took sole ownership. Dance's other horses, most with Horton, were cleared to run, though under different names, in May but with the announcement Monday of \"further concerns coming to light\", another interim stop had...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nBay Bridge Back With A Bang At Kempton\n\nSir Michael Stoute trainee Bay Bridge (GB) (New Bay {GB}--Hayyona {GB}, by Multiplex {GB}), winless in three Group 1 starts since annexing last term's G1 Champion S., regained the winning thread with a confidence-boosting success in Saturday's G3 Unibet September S. at Kempton. The 8-11 favourite hit the board in both G1 Prix Ganay and G1 Tattersalls Gold Cup earlier in the campaign and went postward this first outing at the 12-furlong trip coming back off a fifth in the G1 Prince of Wales's S. at Royal Ascot.
