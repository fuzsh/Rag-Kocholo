        "text": "27th June 1994\n\nEdmondson Hall opened at 168 High Street Newmarket with three employees. Mark Edmondson, Anna Hall and Julia Martin all of whom are still connected with the practice today. Initially occupying the first floor the business then occupied the second floor as well. Primarily set up to provide Legal Services to the Bloodstock and Racing Industry, the firm quickly expanded to provide across the board legal services and attracted (and needed!) more staff.\n\nDecember 1999\n\nFollowing the firm’s successful expansion Edmondson Hall left the High Street and bought new premises located at 25 Exeter Road Newmarket. The building known as Kisber Villa was named after the 1876 Derby Winner. The firm quickly developed the property and whilst keeping the traditional feel to the original building adapted the property into a comfortable working environment. 25A Exeter Road was later acquired and converted in offices.\n\nAugust 2004\n\nIn August 2004 newly qualified Solicitor Deborah Hargreaves started working in the Litigation Department under Mark Edmondson. Debbie moved to Newmarket from Chichester in West Sussex. She was already a horse racing fan and had ridden and owned horses from a young age. A natural litigator, working at a Boutique Practice that specialised in supporting the Bloodstock and wider equine community was in her words “a perfect start to my career”.\n\nMay 2007\n\nContinued growth of the firm meant exciting redevelopment opportunities at the site on Exeter Road. A steady growth in the workforce provided the need for a separate reception area, boardroom and meeting rooms.\n\n2007\n\nThe brainchild of Mark Edmondson, the firm founded Newmarket Business Day, a corporate day at Newmarket Racecourse and a Networking event encouraging local businesses to sponsor a race and interact with other local businesses.\n\nJuly 2009\n\nThe firm was heavily involved in the Newmarket Festival CIC and later formed its replacement as a registered charity. Newmarket Charitable Foundation was therefore formed in 2021. All work was done Pro Bono as part of the businesses commitment to support the local community. Having been Chair of both the Festival and the Foundation for ten years, Mark Edmondson stood down in 2022 but continued to be involved as honorary President.\n\nJanuary 2011\n\nDeborah Hargreaves joins Mark Edmondson and Anna Hall as an owner of Edmondson Hall.\n\nOctober 2012\n\nDeborah Hargreaves became an Advanced Litigator for PI on 25th October 2012 with APIL.\n\n31st December 2015\n\nFounding Partner Anna Hall retired from Partnership but remained as a valued member of the team in her current role as a Consultant.\n\n2017\n\nEdmondson Hall first sponsors the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes on Ladies Day as part of The July Festival at Newmarket Racecourses.\n\n6th August 2018\n\nCamilla East joins the practice as a Partner and head of Residential Conveyancing. Camilla had worked for many years for several large firms and was based in Cambridge. She and her family are well known and respected within the local farming and agricultural community, with Camilla possessing a wealth of local knowledge, not only in the Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Essex regions but countrywide due to the depth and longevity of her experience.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nWith ambitious expansion plans in motion, the Practice needed additional work space for the growing team. A large, ultra modern extension at our existing site involving substantial additional office space was planned. Construction of the extension began with the demolition of existing buildings, with construction being completed in June 2019 by local contractors P B Doyle Ltd.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nEdmondson Hall merged with the oldest Law firm in Newmarket, Rustons and Lloyd Solicitors which was founded in 1834.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nDeborah Hargreaves is appointed as a Board Member of the Chamber of Commerce, Suffolk Chamber in West Suffolk Board.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nThe firm celebrated 25 years in practice and the grand opening of the new rear extension by Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nJuly 2022\n\nElisabeth Sneade joins the Edmondson Hall team and was appointed Partner on 1st July 2022. “I have worked specialising in family law since qualifying in September 2001. Having spent most of my working career in East Anglia I have known of Edmondson Hall and been aware of the reputation for quality work and outstanding client care. When the opportunity arose to join Edmondson Hall it was a pleasure to meet with Mark and Debbie and hear about their future plans for development. From my perspective it was a good fit and I was pleased to join and enable the transition when from Simon Gummer retired in at the end of March 2022.”"
