        "text": "Watched a replay of the 5.00 Salisbury. As Lydia Hislop pointed out Richard Hughes was perilously close to above shoulder height.\n\nKieran Fox, apart from those who backed his mount, its hard to see what he actually did right in the race, hung away from the whip, didnt pull his whip through, didnt allow his mount time to respond, it was a bit of a horror show and I think he would deserve to be banned under the old rules.\n\nEmployment act. Provisions thereof. Unfair confiscation of earnings. It’s going to be challenged sooner or later, so the sooner the better.\n\nFifteen days and confiscation of fee and winning percentage for four smacks over the odds with a cushioned, aerated whip? Can they be serious? On that scale, eating peas with a knife (on horseback) must be worth at least a week.\n\nIn this case, as Fox claims 3 pounds, he won’t be losing anything at all – it’s his trainer-mentor Michael Attwater who will! Perhaps the first court challenge must wait, as this one is a bit complicated…\n\nIt might be better to wait until someone has a case that has a realistic chance of winning. Once the rules have been introduced and the jockeys are riding when those rules are in force, a flagrant breach of those rules is just that. A sensible lawyer/barrister will attack when he has grey areas, this is a cut and dried breach of the rules.\n\nHaving watched the race a few times Workforce was never close enough to Rewilding for them to have struck into each other, there was some talk that he may have struck into himself but I’m far too sceptical.\n\nIts just was just spin to try and protect Workforce’s reputation and give him a shot at being a flat stallion before being consigned to NH duties. He has the head of a chaser so would have probably done well at Cheltenham or Aintree.\n\nHaving read the debate there does seem a distinct difference between the Flat and National Hunt. That the BHA did not make such a distinction does seem to be a big failing.\n\nThoroughbred horses are bred to race, if the RSPCA considers the sport as cruel it should be seeking to ban breeding not racing as then it will guarantee the cessation.\n\nIt has also been mentioned that true bred National Hunt horses are becoming less and less common. It has lead to a large number of horse racing under National Hunt rules not bred primarily to jump hurdles and fences, therefore to ask such animals to do something for which they are not specifically bred does come perilously close to \"cruel\" by definition.\n\nOn the flat in a big race, the deterrent to a jockey is simply not sufficient. When the winning horse can earn a place at stud, the financial benefits are potentially far more lucrative than by just winning the race. Unless you threaten to take the race away for a breach of the rules, then there is not adequate incentive for all parties to abide by the rules.\n\nI think trying to apply the same principles to Flat and National Hunt race riding does not bode well.\n\nDon’t you feel there’s something to be said for a points \"bonus\" based on race values being added to the race totals to decide the championship? (\"pure\" race values could lead to one jockey winning the championship on a handful of winners).\n\nIn my opinion the true Champion this year is Richard Hughes. It was fascinating to watch him yesterday at Goodwood, riding the rest to sleep from the front (something he and Spencer will have to do more with the new whip rules, which penalise come-from-behind rides) and seemingly exercising control over them – something which only true champions do.\n\nNot for the first time I was strongly reminded of Piggott at his incomparable best. It had something of the same mystique about it.\n\nThe value of winning a race for a jockey is One, nice and uncomplicated, as we now have sales races worth a disproportionate amount your notion does have the markings of the finest Whitehall farce.\n\nWould you not agree that it can be considerably more difficult to win a low grade race on an absolute rogue than a top class race on a top class horse? To decide the jockey’s championship on anything other than numbers would make it an absolute joke.\n\nI tend to think that a jockey’s strike rate gives a better indication of his \"class\" in the saddle. Hughes has certainly been riding very well since midsummer but the overall impression is that we are somewhat deprived of world class pilots at the moment. On Saturday we saw Frankie Dettori and Olivier Peslier show why you would put them on any horse in any race in the world, personally I dont think there are any other European based jockeys that you would do that with at present although I think William Buick can make the transition to that level in the fullness of time.\n\nGiven that Born to Sea has suffered from sore shins there must be every doubt that John Oxx would aim him at Newmarket where the chances of good fast ground are greater than the Curragh. As it stands its probably 20/1 they would look at HQ so 50/1 isn’t so attractive.\n\nAlso Invincible Spirit has yet to sire a horse in this hemisphere to excel over a mile.\n\nInvincible Spirit has sired Allied Powers,a group winner over 12f & Lawman who won the French Derby over 11f.\n\nI can see why the Tsui family paired Urban Sea with Invincible Spirit.IS gets good quality fast 2yo’s who can improve with age.Urban Sea progeny improve with age.Speed on the sire side,stamina on the dam’s isnt that the saying?\n\nOxx stated BTS was going to run again in a Group 3 in Ireland in October,no entries as yet,but if he did line up at HQ next May without a further run,would you be in a hurry to lay him? Having witnessed him romping away with a Listed race at the 1st time of asking his trainer must takeall the praise.\n\nWith the passing away of Urban Sea I hope that BTS turns out to be a fitting legacy for the Tsui family.\n\nIf Born to Sea turned up at Newmarket without setting foot on the racetrack between times, he would have to warrant the utmost respect. For that to happen I strongly suspect the ground would have to be on the easy side of good, which given the excellent drainage at HQ and the time of year it is less than likely. Hence my reasoning that his ante-post price has factored in the strong possibility that his sore shins this year would make connexions reluctant to risk him. As a listed winner he has already done enough to earn a place at stud, should he never race again. Given that Sea the Stars was 9/1 on Guineas day, I would be prepared to oppose his once raced half-brother on the day if he was a shorter price than that and would think as 12/1 or bigger he might be worth a speculative punt.\n\nOf course much depends on how the horse develops during the winter, but as a rule Invincible Spirit’s progeny have not shown their best form early in their 3yo careers.\n\nHarbour Watch looked a colt of potential at Goodwood, but potential is all it is, thus far 116lbs is all you can afford him. Given the times that Crusade and Parish Hall clocked today, you would expect them to be allocated more weight in the Free Handicap. Dabirsim will be champion juvenile unless something runs away with one of the backend races.\n\nCaspar Netscher might be suited to the Breeders Cup although I would be concerned about a sharp turn as he is far from straightforward. His best runs have been with a bit of juice in the ground, I felt he was opposable today on account of the going. He is a tough and admirable sort but I cannot see him being easy to place next year.\n\nThe difference in the ride, Moore grabbed hold of Wading going into the dip, whereas he let Power run downhill and become slightly unbalanced. Whether it made a difference between 1st and 2nd its hard to tell, but the extra time he needed to gather Power meant he had to go round horses rather than have the opportunity to come between them.\n\nAs Pat Eddery always said the dip is where most races are won and lost on the Rowley Mile."
