        "text": "Ryan Moore reckons that he's been \"hyped up\"‚ and Sir Michael Stoute will say only that he is \"looking forward to seeing him back on track\". But although the trainer and jockey might prefer to play things down, there is still much to get excited about as Workforce (2.40) makes his reappearance in theDante Stakes at York.\n\nAs far back as February, Workforce was a name on the lips of many in Newmarket. One day he had reportedly been ruled out of the Derby in favour of a tilt at the Guineas, the next it was the other way around.\n\nMaybe it was his stamina, or possibly lack of it, for the mile-and-a-half trip which was leading connections to delay a decision over his running plans for the season. His sire, King's Best, has tended to produce horses in his own mould and at their best at around a mile: the likes of Proclamation, Creachadoir and sprinter King's Apostle come to mind, although Best Alibi — like Workforce a son of King's Best out of a Sadler's Wells mare — got the trip well, finishing sixth at Epsom and third in the Irish Derby.\n\nGoodwood was the selected location for Workforce's only racecourse appearance so far, where he showed a remarkable turn of foot to win going away by six lengths.\n\nThe opposition may have looked ordinary at the time, but runner-up Oasis Dancer scooped over half a million pounds in a sales race on his next start and looks a Pattern-race performer himself. Moving markedly up in grade and trip, Workforce certainly has plenty to prove at this level.\n\nBut it's not as if Chabal, Cape Blanco or Coordinated Cut don't themselves have questions to answer, and at the price it could pay to take a chance on the selection's potential."
