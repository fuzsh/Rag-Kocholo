        "text": "In the world of cricket, names don’t come much bigger.\n\nMichael Holding is widely regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time who plied his trade in one of the best teams ever seen.\n\nBut cricket isn’t Holding’s only sporting love, racing is a huge passion for the now-retired broadcaster too.\n\n“It started from when I was a kid,” Holding said from his Cayman Islands home on Tuesday’s race day coverage.\n\n“I didn’t know a lot about racing, but my brother, his god-mother owned horses in Jamaica and whenever he went to the track with her, I used to tag along from a pretty young age.\n\n“That’s where my first interest started.”\n\nWhat started as a flirting passion quickly became a love for Holding, who developed a close friendship with legendary Newmarket trainer, Sir Michael Stoute – four decades later the pair are still close mates.\n\n“I loved the athleticism of the horses and I got more and more involved, until I decided to own horses and then of course I got to meet the great Michael Stoute and it all just grew and grew from there,” Holding said.\n\n“When I first met him, he never used a pen or paper, he had a photographic memory and he knew every horse that walked past him, he knew the mannerism of each one, he knew exactly the personality of each one.\n\n“Whenever we meet, I might want to talk horses, he’s not interested in talking horses he wants to talk cricket!”\n\nSir Michael Stoute trained Zaaki before his move to Australia and holding always knew conditions down-under would suit the gelding to a tee.\n\n“Zaaki required certain types of ground, Zaaki was not going to be able to move very well or race very well on soft ground, he wanted ground that was on top of the ground, pretty firm ground,” Holding said.\n\n“Every time he got that in England he’d run well; he didn’t win a lot of races, but he ran well.\n\n“Him going to Australia was perfect, he would always get his ground there, or more times than not.”\n\nDuring an illustrious cricket career, Holding was feared throughout opposition dressing rooms right across the world for more than a decade.\n\n“It was fantastic, I played for the West Indies for 12 years, I enjoyed every year,” he said.\n\n“It was a fantastic era, we had a great team and travelled the world and meet friends, not just meeting people and making enemies, we made friends even though we beat people.”\n\nAfter a decorated career on the pitch and then in the commentary box, Holding has now hung up the microphone, but retirement hasn’t seen the cricket legend slow down, he’s been keeping busy and recently released an eye-opening book.\n\n“At the moment it hasn’t hit me that I’ve retired, because right now I’m doing exactly what I’d be doing even if I hadn’t retired,” Holding said.\n\n“I’m looking forward to having Christmas at home, and just spending Christmas and New Year at home.\n\n“A lot of people have already told me that having read the book they’re changing their entire though processes and are seeing exactly what people have been going through.\n\n“We need a better world in which to live.”\n\nHolding says the next stage of his life involves spending time with family, watching the cricket, and keeping a very close eye on racing around the world, in particular the UK and Australia."
