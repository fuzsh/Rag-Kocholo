        "text": "Although I do realise there has to be a rule to stop owners laying at any time. e.g. After a horse has been backed, other evidence comes to light that the original bet was not a good one. So laying it back. That is and should be against the rules. Although that is not what I believe happened in Harry’s case, it is the reason Findlay should get a penalty. The rules need to be SEEN to be working, and needs to be a deterrent for others. To do nothing would be seen (by some) as a licence to lay, therefore not an option.\n\nThere was no intent as far as I can see. 6 months ban is too much, two or three months may be justified. Harry should be treated the same as anyone else, not better or worse.\n\nIf the rules need to be seen to be working, would two or three months be a sufficient deterrent?\n\nHarry Findlay hasn’t been treated the same as anyone else. It would appear that six months is a lenient sentence, considering he could have been given eighteen months, no?\n\n^^I was on at 10/1 (mentioned it in the Irish 2000 Guineas thread). Arcano is certainly the most interesting runner in the field and would have a massive chance on his Prix Morny win (two Classic winners behind). He’s by Oasis Dream, who can sire good middle distance performers (Midday), by a Daylami mare – I wouldn’t mind seeing Arcano over ten furlongs. The Champion Stakes could be ideal.^^\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of Canford Cliffs and supported him in both Guineas, but will he be as effective on a round course? There’s nothing to suggest he won’t be, but I have a niggling doubt…or maybe I’m just looking for a reason to oppose a short-priced favourite.\n\nMakfi being readily opposed by the majority, I see. An unbeaten, well bred Classic winner being underestimated? Didn’t we learn our lesson last time? What price would he be if trained by Andre Fabre and owned by Khalid Abdullah?\n\nSIYOUNI\n\n(86.72)\n\n86.10 Longchamp 8 furlongs (3.73/Firm)\n\n86.18 Longchamp 8 furlongs (1.82/Good to Firm)\n\n89.48 Longchamp 7 furlongs (4.38/Hard)\n\nAnother horse who looks like having a preferences for a bit of cut and Siyouni has failed to improve over the winter with two runs that have produced exact replicas of his 2 year old ratings which I am afraid he’s just be surpassed by better horses now, I do think he’ll have better chances when stepped up to 10 furlongs on softer ground in his own country.\n\n\"The horse has wintered well and he feels fantastic with a great action.\"\n\nGERALD MOSSE\n\n\"The colt came through the winter in good order. He has had enough work but not too much for this race (Fontainebleau).\"\n\nALAIN DE ROYER-DUPRE\n\nHard to judge the horse after just two efforts this term, Mr.Wilson.\n\nHe was far from fully wound up for his seasonal debut when runner-up in the Fontainebleau (Lope De Vega third) and he had no luck in the Poule d’Essai des Poulains.\n\nHis performance in the Jean Luc-Lagardere, and subsequent form of the race, gives him every chance on Tuesday. He had Pounced (Breeders’ Cup Juvenile), Lope De Vega (dual Classic winner), Dick Turpin (dual Classic placed) and Beethoven (Dewhurst) all behind him that day and he beat them convincingly:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0v8udvQZco\n\nThis horse is all about speed (three times winner over five furlongs) and I don’t think he’d stay too much further – ten furlongs could well be stretching it.\n\nHis action certainly doesn’t suggest he wants it too soft. I actually think he may well improve with quicker ground.\n\nThe trainer seemed very bullish on ATR today and fancies his chances.\n\nI think this renewel of the Prix Du Jockey Club is arguably as strong as our Derby.\n\nAll eyes from these shores will be on Cape Blanco, who beat subsequent Derby winner, Workforce.\n\nI like the leading home fancies, Planteur and Behkabad.\n\nThe former enjoyed a smooth success over Derby third, Rewilding, in April and comes from a smart family.\n\nBelow is a link to the Prix Noailles:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ort-E4VXOGw\n\nBehkabad is another high class, well related sort, courtesy of H H The Aga Khan’s stud. The son of Cape Cross has tasted defeat only once in five outings, although this is a marked step up in class.\n\nThe leading players respective prices for todays\n\nCape Blanco\n\nPlanteur\n\nIce Blue\n\nBehkabad\n\nIf any of the home based fancies take this, the remainder of their season will revolve around Arc day, whereas our colts will more than likely be exposed to a couple of hard races between now and then.\n\nMay be worth taking a price for the Arc if you fancy any of them today. The winner of this will clearly be useful.\n\n‘The debate about whether this was a spectacular performance against a relatively weak field or a downright phenomenal victory is only just beginning.’\n\n~RP ONLINE\n\n———————————————————\n\nA wonderful statement to summarise the success of Workforce.\n\nThe Derby is such a unique contest. Immature, inexperienced 3YO colts, many of whom are tackling the trip for the first time, charging around the undulations of Epsom, surrounded by a cauldron of human anticipation.\n\nIt can make, or break, a colt.\n\nTherefore, The Derby is not always won by the best horse in the field, but the best horse on the day. The one who handles the occasion and the demands of Epsom racecourse shall reign supreme.\n\nIn the past ten years, only four colts have followed up their Epsom heroics:\n\nSea The Stars – Eclipse\n\nHigh Chaparral – Irish Derby\n\nGalileo – Irish Derby\n\nSinndar – Irish Derby\n\nAn even more telling statistic is that Sea The Stars is the only horse during the last seven years to follow up, with the remainder tasting defeat in various contests:\n\nNew Approach – International\n\nAuthorized – Eclipse\n\nSir Percy – Champion Stakes\n\nMotivator – Eclipse\n\nNorth Light – Irish Derby\n\nKris Kin – King George\n\nThe final quartet never even won a race after Epsom.\n\nMany believe that the race takes a lot out of these immature athletes, but a number of beaten horses have gone on to achieve a fair level of success after the first Saturday in June. In my opinion, when the unique demands of the course are replaced by a more conventional track, the winner no longer holds the advantage it enjoyed around Epsom.\n\nWorkforce enjoyed that advantage and subsequently beat:\n\nAt First Sight – a 100-1 pacemaker\n\nRewilding – failed to act down the hill\n\nJan Vermeer – jockey never happy\n\nMidas Touch – failed to handle the course\n\nAl Zir – doubtful stayer\n\nThe burst of acceleration the winner displayed appeared impressive, but at that time he was asked to go past a horse who you could forgive for tiring after he had been out on his own for much of the race.\n\nAs I mentioned in another thread, despite the winner landing the prize by a distance of 7L, he only put a further 3L between himself and Rewilding down the straight, despite the Godolphin colt pitching three furlongs out and clearly not enjoying coming down the hill. Later, Frankie Dettori would say that his colt is ‘more of a Leger horse’.\n\nWhere will Workforce go next? The last horse to attempt the English / Irish Derby double was North Light back in 2004, who was also trained by Sir Michael Stoute. The horse enjoyed a similar path, taking in a Goodwood maiden as a juvenile before tackling the Dante, then Epsom.\n\nThe last five winners have tried their luck over ten furlongs and Workforce clearly isn’t lacking in the pace department.\n\nWorkforce is the most visually impressive winner since Authorized in 2007. There is, however, a distict gulf between the two lists of respective Derby winners I have printed above.\n\nCan Workforce join the likes of Sea The Stars, Galileo, High Chaparral and Sinndar?\n\nHe must first prove he is the best of his generation. Indeed, he could start by proving his superiority over Dante conqueror, Cape Blanco.\n\nAs I mentioned in my last post, the sire of Workforce, King’s Best, was a half-brother to Urban Sea, who was the dam of Galileo and Sea The Stars.\n\nWhat a family!!\n\nWell done to all those who backed the winner. I was impressed with his debut and the Dante showed plenty of promise, but was not convinced about him handling the course.\n\nPlease accept my apology, but I am going to put a dampener on things.\n\nA few things I’ve noticed watching the race again:\n\nIt’s clear from the time of the race that Seamie Heffernan judged his ride to perfection on At First Sight. He set an even tempo from start to finish – not too slow, not too fast. It was a wonderful piece of riding.\n\nBullet Train followed him through, but was beaten far too convincingly for that to be his true running. Henry Cecil’s Oaks duo disappointed yesterday, so perhaps his horses aren’t firing on all cylinders.\n\nWorkforce was the only challenger to emerge from the pack with any conviction. Here’s what I found to be most interesting…\n\nEntering the descent into Tattenham Corner, Workforce and Rewilding were matching strides, Ryan kicked on and the response was almost immediate. Frankie’s horse didn’t appear to handle it too well and lost several lengths. Whilst Workforce appeared to quicken better than anything down the straight, he never dramatically increased his advantage over the eventual third from the three furlong pole, despite Rewilding pitching.\n\nHave a look at the aerial replay and examine the respective positions of these two colts from the three furlong pole. Workforce increased his advantage, but not in the manner I initially thought he did.\n\nWorkforce went past At First Sight well inside the final two furlongs, who you would have thought was coming to the end of his tether by this stage, with the Godolphin colt nearly snatching second on the line.\n\nThe Ballydoyle duo ran hightly respectable races in fourth and fifth, but Johnny said he was never happy on Jan Vermeer and Midas Touch perhaps didn’t handle the course.\n\nThe winner is clearly very, very good, but the best 3YO doesn’t always win The Derby, but rather, the best horse to handle the conditions of the race.\n\nI said in my preview that I considered him more of an Irish Derby type and the race is his for the taking. Looking ahead, I can see him adding a race like the Juddmonte to his CV, although I’m sure Aidan O’Brien will aim Cape Blanco and perhaps St Nicholas Abbey at the York contest. I would fancy Fame And Glory to beat him in the King George (shot me!) and Planteur is my idea of the Arc winner. The Elie Lellouche-trained colt beat Rewilding very comfortably in the Prix Noailles and he held the form up well today, despite not handling Epsom as well as I thought he would.\n\nI said in my preview that Midas Touch would be an ideal Leger type and I maintain that opinion. Jan Vermeer is better than that and Al Zir will be an awesome 4YO.\n\nA great training performance and a great effort in the saddle from Ryan Moore. Well done, Workforce. Should be more to come.\n\nAll the criticism of ‘Aussie’ Jim McGrath makes me chuckle.\n\nIn my opinion, the guy is still the man for the big occasion – and they don’t come any bigger than today.\n\nThey certainly didn’t come much bigger than Sea The Stars attempt at Arc glory last year. He used all of his knowledge and experience to encapsulate the importance of the occasion and his excitement the moment Sea The Stars hit the front spoke for the vast majority of racing fans.\n\nPerfection in equine form? Sea The Stars was.\n\nA lesson in how to call a race of that magnitude. Most definitely.\n\nI expect another vintage call at 16:00."
