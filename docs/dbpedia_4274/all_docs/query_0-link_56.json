        "text": "A horse owned by the Queen is set to start as favourite in Saturday's English Derby, Britain's richest race with prize money of 1.25 million pounds ($2 million Cdn).\n\nCarlton House has been declared for the mile-and-a-half race despite a late scare over a swelling in his near-fore leg. He heads a list of 17 runners for the most prestigious of the five classics in Britain's flat-racing season.\n\nA three-year-old colt trained by Michael Stoute, Carlton House has attracted big interest because of his royal connections and victory in last month's Dante Stakes in York.\n\nThe Queen has entered nine horses in the Derby since taking the throne in 1952. She has yet to land a winner — Aureole came second for her in 1953 — but has a great chance this year, with Stoute a five-time winner of the race and the trainer of 2010 champion Workforce.\n\n\"The Queen will be at Epsom and this will mean a lot to her,\" said her racing manager, John Warren.\n\nMoore was aboard Workforce when he swept home in a record time last year, sealing a double for the jockey after his win in the English Oaks a day earlier.\n\nCarlton House is rated a 7-4 shot by British bookmaker William Hill, with Pour Moi, one of two French horses set to compete, next a 7-2. Recital is third favourite at 5-1.\n\nIrish trainer Aidan O'Brien has five entries for the Derby, which is into its 232nd year.\n\nSeville, runner-up in the Dante, looks to be O'Brien's best chance at 7-1."
