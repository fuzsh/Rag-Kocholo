        "text": "Home\n\nHorse Racing\n\nDesert Crown Ready To Make Long Awaited Return After Nearly A Year On The Sidelines\n\nDesert Crown ready to make long-awaited return after nearly a year on the sidelines\n\nDesert Crown faces stiff competition in the Lotto Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown as he finally makes his return to the track after more than 350 days without a race.\n\nLast year’s Derby hero Desert Crown will make his eagerly-awaited return to action after 355 days on the sidelines in Thursday’s Racehorse Lotto Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown.\n\nTrained by Sir Michael Stoute, the Saeed Suhail-owned colt is unbeaten in three racecourse appearances.\n\nA Nottingham maiden win at two was impressive by any standards, but he stepped up on that to win the Dante at York on his first outing at three and he looked to have the world at his feet when toying with the Derby field at Epsom.\n\nRichard Kingscote was on board that day and maintains the partnership on a horse who has been off the track since due to injury.\n\nNursed along by Stoute, he is now ready to return in a race which the trainer has traditionally used as a starting point for his best middle distance horses such as Pilsudski, Notnowcato and Workforce.\n\nStoute also runs Solid Stone, in the same ownership, who will be ridden by Ryan Moore.\n\nDesert Crown faces far from a penalty kick as another long-absent star returns to action in Hukum. Trained by Owen Burrows, he was last seen winning the Coronation Cup at the Derby meeting but in doing so he picked up an injury which has kept him off the track since.\n\nJane Chapple-Hyam’s Royal Ascot winner Claymore, David Simcock’s Cash and the Keith Dalgleish-trained Chichester returns complete the field.\n\nFrankie Dettori has the ride on Enemy in the Racehorse Lotto Henry II Stakes. Nate The Great, Roberto Escobarr, Sleeping Lion and Princess Anne, trained in France by Hiroo Shimizu, are the other contenders.\n\nSome very highly rated juveniles go to post for the Racehorse Lotto National Stakes, led by James Tate’s Blue Storm.\n\nThe Newmarket race he won on debut could hardly have worked out any better, as Tate explained: “Blue Storm was very taking up at Newmarket. He has been very natural at home and has showed up well all winter.\n\n“We gave him one piece of work just before the Craven meeting, which he showed up nicely in before winning at Newmarket.\n\n“Generally speaking my two-year-olds come on a lot from their first run to their second and if he follows that rule, we have every reason to be excited.\n\n“What is even better is that the second, third, fourth and fifth have all won since, so the form looks great.\n\n“There are not too many negatives and lots of reasons to be optimistic.”\n\nRichard Hannon’s Dapper Valley, Hugo Palmer’s Chester winner Hackman and Charlie Appleby’s On Point all carry tall reputations into the 10-runner contest.\n\nMore Articles"
