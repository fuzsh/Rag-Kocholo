        "text": "Juddmonte Farms is a horse breeding farm, owned until his death on 12 January 2021[1] by Prince Khalid bin Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.[2]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nJuddmonte Farms consists of a variety of individual farms: four in England, two in Ireland, and two in Kentucky, United States.[3] Established in 1977, Juddmonte is highly regarded in particular for their 200-plus broodmare band.[citation needed] The farm has owned five horses named Broodmare of the Year in the U.S. or Britain:[4] Slightly Dangerous, dam of stakes winners Commander in Chief, Warning, Yashmak, Dushyantor and Jibe; Hasili, dam of stakes winners Dansili, Banks Hill, Intercontinental, Heat Haze, Cacique and Champs Elysees; Toussaud, dam of stakes winners Empire Maker, Chester House, Honest Lady, Chiselling and Decarchy; Arrive, dam of Visit and Promising Lead; Binche, dam of Byword and Proviso; and Concentric, dam of Enable.\n\nThe farm's first major victory was in 1980 when Known Fact won the 2,000 Guineas, the first win in that 200-year-old event for any Arab racing owner.[2]\n\nIn Europe, Juddmonte currently stands at stud the stallions Bated Breath, Expert Eye, Frankel, Kingman and Oasis Dream. In the United States, Juddmonte's stallion is Mandaloun, after the death of the prominent Arrogate at age 7.[5]\n\nA number of homebreds have won major races both in Flat and National Hunt racing after leaving Juddmonte. These include Wicklow Brave, son of Beat Hollow (Vincent O'Brien County Hurdle, The Punchestown Champion Hurdle and Irish St Leger); Prohibit, son of Oasis Dream (King's Stand Stakes); Brian Boru, son of broodmare Eva Luna (Racing Post Trophy and British St Leger); Powerscourt, son of broodmare Rainbow Lake (Tattersalls Gold Cup and Arlington Millions); Foreteller, son of Dansili (Australian Ranvet Stakes, Makybe Diva Stakes and Underwood Stakes) and Harlem, son of Champs Elysees (Australian Cup).[6]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nJuddmonte Farms has over the years won a variety of awards related to horse racing.[7] In the United States this includes 16 Eclipse Awards to date, which includes the Top Breeder Award in 1995, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2009, as well as the Top Owner Award in 1992, 2003, 2016 and 2017.[2][8] In 2003, they had a win at the Belmont Stakes, with Empire Maker and also had wins in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf in 2001, 2005 and 2009 with Banks Hill, Intercontinental and Midday.[2] They won the Breeders' Cup Classic with Arrogate in 2016, and the Breeders' Cup Mile with Expert Eye and Breeders' Cup Turf with Enable in 2018.[9]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prince Khalid bin Abdullah has won the British flat racing Champion Owner Title in 2003, 2010 and 2011, with horses such as Oasis Dream, Derby winner Workforce, Byword, Classic winner Special Duty, Timepiece, Twice Over, Midday and 10-time Group 1 winner Frankel, the highest rated thoroughbred racehorse in history[citation needed]. A Champion Owner Title was also achieved in Ireland 1993.[10]\n\nTo date, Prince Khalid bin Abdullah and Juddmonte horses have won 21 Cartier Racing Award titles, also known as the European Horse of the Year Awards. Wins include Horse of the Year (Frankel (twice), Kingman, and Enable), Three-Year-Old Colt of the Year (Commander in Chief, Workforce, Frankel and Kingman), Three-Year-Old Filly of the Year (Banks Hill, Enable), Two-Year-Old Colt of the Year (Zafonic, Frankel), Two-Year-Old Filly of the Year (Special Duty), Top Older Horse of the Year (Frankel, Noble Mission, Enable), Top Sprinter of the Year (Oasis Dream) and the Award of Merit.\n\nIn France, Prince Khalid bin Abdullah has won the French Champion Owner Title in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2015 and 2017.[11][12][13][14] In Ireland the Champion Owner Title was won in 1993.[10]\n\nFour times, at the end of 2011, 2012 and 2016, a Juddmonte Farms horse has led the IFHA World's Best Racehorse rankings: Frankel in 2011–12 and Arrogate in 2016–17.\n\nTrainers and jockeys\n\n[edit]\n\nJuddmonte's regular trainers in Britain include Roger Charlton, Charlie Hills, John and Thady Gosden, and Michael Stoute. In 2016, Ralph Beckett and Hugo Palmer became trainers for Juddmonte in Britain following the death of Sir Henry Cecil and the retirement of his wife, Lady Jane Cecil, after a brief but successful career. In 2006, Dermot Weld became a trainer for Juddmonte in Ireland, and Ger Lyons became a Juddmonte trainer in 2018. In France horses are sent to André Fabre, Henri-Francois Devin and Francis-Henri Graffard. Successful horses on the European scene were often sent late in their three-year-old career to Robert J. Frankel in the U.S. for the bigger purse Grade 1 races. In the 1980s, Juddmonte also enjoyed success with Guy Harwood (father of Amanda Perrett) and Jeremy Tree in Britain and with Maurice Zilber in France.\n\nIn France former French National Hunt Champion Jockey Vincent Cheminaud is currently retained by Juddmonte. In Britain, Pat Eddery, Richard Hughes and James Doyle have been retained to ride Juddmonte horses in the past. In Ireland, Pat Smullen regularly rode Juddmonte horses.\n\nThe Juddmonte Group's CEO is Douglas Erskine Crum. The studs in England are managed by Simon Mockridge, in Ireland by Barry Mahon and in Kentucky by Garrett O'Rourke. Teddy Grimthorpe is employed as Juddmonte's racing manager in Europe, while Garrett O'Rourke is employed as Juddmonte's racing manager in the U.S.[15]\n\nIn the United States, Juddmonte horses—including Classic winner Empire Maker, Aptitude, Flute, Heat Haze, First Defence, Ventura, Sightseek, Intercontinental and former European racers such as Beat Hollow and Champs Elysees were trained by Robert Frankel for more than two decades prior to Frankel's death in November, 2009. They are now being trained by Bill Mott, Brad Cox, Bob Baffert and also by former assistant to Robert Frankel, Chad Brown\n\nMajor wins\n\n[edit]\n\nGreat Britain\n\n1,000 Guineas – Wince (1999),
