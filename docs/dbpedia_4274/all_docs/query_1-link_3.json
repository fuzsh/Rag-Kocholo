        "text": "However, the class of last year's Derby and Arc winner was enough to take the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown.\n\nConnections would not be drawn on where Khalid Abdullah's animal would head next but this was a more-than-satisfactory reappearance in Group 3 company.\n\nJockey Ryan Moore and the even-money favourite were still adrift of Poet with a furlong to run, but he was a length up where it mattered.\n\n\"He has taken a lot of getting fit this time around because he has developed so much,\" said Stoute.\n\n\"I was a little concerned when they turned in, but he did it well in the end. I really want to give it a lot of thought (future plans) and have a sit down with Ryan.\n\n\"I'm sure owner Prince Khalid would like to be informed of our thinking so there's no rush.\"\n\nMoore said: \"He was a little sleepy in the stalls and the race was a bit messy, but I never felt like he was going to get beaten. He has always felt like a horse with more to come, nothing has been asked at home and we didn't ask an awful lot more here.\"\n\nStoute struck again when Tazahum took the Heron Stakes by a nose after flashing across the line with Fury.\n\nThe trainer added: \"He is a horse we have always liked.\n\n\"Now the St James's Palace Stakes would probably be too tough and I'm not sure it would be wise to drop him back to seven furlongs for the Jersey Stakes.\n\n\"That said, we really don't have to go to Ascot if we don't want to.\""
