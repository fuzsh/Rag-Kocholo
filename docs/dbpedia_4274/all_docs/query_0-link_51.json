        "text": "Last updated: 10/3/10 10:44 PM\n\nWorkforce gets the job done in Arc; Goldikova battles back\n\nin Foret\n\nOnly a handful of horses have won the Epsom Derby by as much as Workforce’s\n\nseven-length margin, and none had covered the 1 1/2-mile distance faster,\n\nbut such brilliant displays have proven to be false dawns in the past. He needed\n\nto reproduce that level of form to enter championship territory. The\n\nthree-year-old had hung and looked uncomfortable when runner-up in the Dante\n\nS. (Eng-G2) at York May 13 and, when he dropped out in Ascot’s home straight to\n\nfinish nearly 17 lengths behind Harbinger (Dansili [GB]) in the King George, the\n\nvibes became increasingly negative.\n\nWith that in mind, the Stoute stable went\n\ndown to brass tacks, and Workforce’s recent racecourse spin at Sandown — which\n\ndid not receive glowing reports from those present — was the only public sighting\n\nof the classic hero subsequently. But those who kept the faith in the\n\ntime-honored Stoute magic were rewarded with a starting price that looked\n\nimpossible in the immediate aftermath of the Derby.\n\nKept tight to the rail by\n\nRyan Moore early, Workforce had only a handful of rivals behind at the top of\n\nthe “false straight,” but had gone the shortest way round, and that proved a\n\ncrucial factor as he started his challenge before the quarter-pole. Lope de\n\nVega, who headed the field at the top of the stretch, was tiring when getting\n\nthe worst of the interference that caused the lengthy enquiry, and eventually\n\nwas judged to have been caused by the subsequently disqualified seventh Planteur (Danehill Dancer).\n\nAvoiding the tangle, Workforce surged past to engage Nakayama Festa and\n\nMasayoshi Ebina of El Condor Pasa fame. He had to grind it out, but the colt got\n\nhis head in front before answering every call from his rider in a pulsating\n\nfinale.\n\n“He was back to his best today,” Moore said. “We got\n\na nice run through and, when it all got a bit tight at the top of the false\n\nstraight, there was half a gap there and he was very brave and really quickened\n\ninto it well. The Japanese horse kept at him, but he kept doing enough and has a\n\ngreat attitude. Ascot wasn’t him; this was only the fifth race of his life, and\n\nhe’s won a Derby and an Arc.\n\n“To me, winning the Derby and the Arc\n\nin the same year is obviously something exceptional,” Moore added. “The Derby is the race I\n\nalways wanted to win, but winning a race such as the Arc is probably more\n\nimportant for the horse.\n\n“Everyone knows how good a trainer Sir Michael is, and\n\nhe’s done a great job with Workforce. After the King George, he always said that\n\nif the horse was well he would run in the Arc, and he brought him along\n\nprogressively. We were very happy with him when he worked at Sandown and since\n\nthen he has not stopped improving, so I was confident he would run a great race\n\ntoday.”\n\nStoute was quick to shoulder the blame for Workforce’s disappointing\n\nrun at Ascot.\n\n“Ryan blames himself for Ascot and felt he should have switched\n\nhim off more, but I think I may have trained him too hard for the race,” Stoute\n\noffered. “I said\n\nthat to Prince Khalid afterwards, and I think I was proved right on that, so we\n\ntook a different path this time. I don’t know if I’m likely to train him next\n\nyear, but I’d love to.”\n\nWorkforce’s win represented a fourth for his owner after Rainbow Quest in\n\n1985, Dancing Brave a year later and Rail Link in 2006.\n\n“It’s a\n\ngreat moment,” Racing Manager Teddy Grimthorpe said. “The first two, Rainbow Quest and Dancing Brave, were horses we\n\nbought but the last two, Rail Link and Workforce, are both homebreds and that is\n\na great achievement for Juddmonte and everyone involved.\n\n“There aren’t words\n\nstrong enough to describe the quality of the work Sir Michael Stoute and his\n\nteam have done with this horse — to bring him back at the top after his moderate\n\neffort in the King George and after such a long break between the two races — it\n\nreally is a great training feat. His future will now be discussed by Prince Khalid and Sir Michael and he will most likely stay in training as a\n\nfour-year-old. It is unlikely that he will run again this year.”\n\nEleven years ago, Nakayama Festa’s jockey Ebina was cruelly denied an\n\nArc victory on El Condor Pasa by Montjeu (Ire) close home and it was\n\na case of history repeating Sunday. As he had on that occasion, he adopted\n\npositive tactics in early stretch and once again was run out of it by an elite\n\nthree-year-old.\n\nThe runner-up’s trainer Yoshitaka Ninomiya said, “We’re very\n\nproud with the way the horse has run. He had come on a lot for his last race in\n\nthe Prix Foy (Fr-G2) and we’re very happy. It is most likely we will take him back\n\nhome now and try to have him ready to run in the Japan Cup ([Jpn-G1] November\n\n28).”\n\nThat is\n\nalso the target of compatriot Victoire Pisa (Neo Universe), who was\n\neighth before being promoted to seventh.\n\nSarafina (Refuse to Bend [Ire]), who was seriously impeded at\n\nthe end of the false straight as Midas Touch (Galileo [Ire]) backpedaled,\n\nlooked unlucky after delivering a telling burst of acceleration to swamp her\n\nbetter-fancied fellow Aga Khan homebred Behkabad (Cape Cross [Ire]).\n\nHer rider Gerald Mosse was not using that as an excuse, however.\n\n“It didn’t\n\nreally bother me, as it gave me the opportunity to let her catch her breath,” he\n\ntold PA Sport. “She had a good spurt on her second wind and I’m very pleased.”\n\nBehkabad’s trainer Jean-Claude Rouget said of the Grand Prix de Paris (Fr-G1) winner,\n\nwho was sent off the 9-2 favorite, “He had a wall of horses in front of him at\n\n400 meters and was blocked in, but you know you need luck in this race and I’m\n\nnot disappointed. It is likely that he will go to stud at the end of the year,\n\nbut there is a good chance that as long as we are invited, he will have one more\n\nrace in the Hong Kong Cup ([HK-G1] on December 12) at Sha Tin.”\n\nOn the card in which Zarkava entered legend two years ago, Goldikova was carving her own special mark into history. Were it not for His Highness The Aga Khan’s greatest\n\ndistaffer, the extraordinary Wertheimer homebred would have the 2008 Poule\n\nd’Essai des Pouliches (Fr-G1) to her name. As it is, Churchill Downs will be the stage\n\nfor her bid for immortality as she attempts a third consecutive Breeders’ Cup Mile, which\n\ncould well be run on her favored fast surface.\n\nBeaten by Makfi (Dubawi) when it was this soft in the August 15 Prix Jacques le Marois\n\n(Fr-G1) last time, her trainer had some major concerns whether to chance her\n\nagain in ground so testing, but gave Paris what she wanted when committing to\n\nrun. Straight into the lead and traveling with all her usual gusto in front, she\n\nallowed Regal Parade (Pivotal) past at the quarter-pole with Peslier sitting tight\n\nin a masterclass of cool. As Dick Turpin (Arakan) and the later-closing\n\nPaco Boy were delivered out wide, it was time to go and she duly went through\n\nthe gears with the minimum of fuss.\n\n“Olivier gave her a great ride and she has\n\nsuch a heart for the fight. Once again, I’d like to thank her owners, who have\n\nsportingly kept her in training this season. That was most probably her last\n\nrace in France and the plan has always been to attempt a third Breeders’ Cup\n\nMile, so that is where she goes now.”\n\nTrainer Richard Hannon was again playing\n\nsecond fiddle to Goldikova and told PA Sport, “It was a bit unfortunate coming\n\ninto the straight that we lost ground, because from stall one, she (Goldikova)\n\nhad such a massive advantage. We were boxed in stalls nine and 10. Dick Turpin\n\nran a great race and there will be another day for him and with Paco, we’ll\n\nsleep on it and see about the Breeders’ Cup Mile."
