        "text": "Kentucky has built an image on its storied horse industry, but now a dwindling pool of migrant workers threatens to hold it back.\n\nAs a way to bolster its most vital industries, Kentucky's Chamber of Commerce announced a pilot program to develop a talent pipeline for jobs in the equine industry, as well as the manufacturing, health care, construction and IT sectors.\n\nThe initiative comes at a critical time for the equine industry, said Elisabeth Jensen, executive vice president of the Kentucky Equine Education Project, an industry advocate and partner on the project. The industry has relied upon migrant workers who entered the country illegally as well as legal immigrant labor through the H-2B visa program, which allows a limited number of non-agriculture workers to gain temporary work status.\n\nThe horse industry has used the H-2B program, the most common form of authorization used by foreign nationals in the thoroughbred industry, to employ grooms, hot walkers and equine managers, which organize feeding schedules and veterinary visits for the animals.\n\nAccording to recent Department of Labor statistics, racing’s share of those visas is less than 2 percent, the Courier Journal previously reported. Of the 32,011 positions that were certified during the 2017 fiscal year, only 548 were categorized as “nonfarm animal caretakers.”\n\nTo gain approval for H-2B hiring, an employer must demonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers “able, willing, qualified and available” for the job; that the hiring will not adversely affect wages or working conditions for similarly employed Americans and that the need is “temporary,” the Courier Journal previously reported.\n\nBecause of the additional expenses involved in clearing these hurdles, including advertising and legal fees, multiple industry sources insist that the expenses associated with an imported worker exceed the cost of hiring a local.\n\nBut as unemployment numbers decrease across the country, companies are desperately seeking workers, competing against one another for the 81,000 H-2B visas that the Department of Homeland Security doles out.\n\nRead this: Thousands of immigrants pass through the Southern border. Why are they fleeing their home countries?\n\nThat means that the horse industry cannot rely on its usual stream of workers who arrive in Kentucky on migrant worker visas and must turn to developing a new entry-level talent pool in its own backyard.\n\n\"In 2008-9, there was a huge drop in the industry,\" Jensen said. Today, it provides nearly $4 billion of economic impact to the state and more than 80,000 jobs, she added.\n\n\"The equine industry is of critical importance to our heritage and to our future,\" said Beth Davisson, the executive director of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce's Workforce Center.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is funding the pilot in Kentucky, alongside ones in Tennessee and Michigan. Davisson said that Kentucky's Chamber of Commerce has worked alongside the national chamber on a number of initiatives in healthcare and manufacturing. \"That success and our commitment to the state improving the workforce in our economy was proof to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that we're serious,\" Davisson said.\n\nIn other news: Louisville had worst air quality in country last weekend\n\nThe Kentucky chamber's Workforce Center will hire five new staff members — one in Louisville, plus three other regional staffers and one to specifically deal with the equine industry. These staffers will speak with industry leaders to develop a database of information that seeks to determine what qualifications are necessary for entry-level positions. In the program's second year, they will work with educators to create training programs that will feed those industries' talent pipelines, Davisson said.\n\n\"We'll work different sectors to really understand what their workforce projections are and what is their most critical job need,\" she added.\n\n\"The biggest thing with us is to get information on the jobs that are available,\" Jensen said. The second phase of the program will work more with the labor pool — understanding from potential workers what types of salary and benefits they would need to work in the industry.\n\nAdditionally, the chamber is culling together a group of 20 regional business leaders who will volunteer to raise awareness for the program and connect their local industries with the chamber staff member. Those volunteers will be trained in September, Davisson said.\n\nMore: Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' border prosecutions led to time served, $10 fees\n\nKEEP is helping to fund some of those positions at the Chamber of Commerce, which the chamber is providing all of the training themselves.\n\nJensen said she hopes the project will work alongside existing resources for workforce development in the state, as well as educational programs such as the University of Louisville's and University of Kentucky's equine management program.\n\n\"There isn't really a coordination of any of these different resources,\" she said.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce will host a meeting July 25 with the Louisville Society for Humane Resource Management and Kentuckiana Works to inform the public about the program.\n\nReach reporter Kate Talerico at ktalerico@gannett.com, 502-582-4352 or follow her on Twitter at @k_talerico."
