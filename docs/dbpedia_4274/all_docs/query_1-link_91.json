        "text": "Next Article\n\nRoyal Ascot 2021 provided success for a broad range of sires and broodmare sires, but one mare rose above all others, writes Aisling Crowe\n\nRafha’s sons and grandsons\n\nPrince Faisal’s diminutive Prix de Diane heroine Rafha was the matriarch who reigned over the 2021 Royal meeting – 13 races across the five days featured her name in the pedigrees of at least one of the first three home.\n\nAt Group 1 level she appears in the pedigrees of the winners of three of the meeting’s eight top level races through her stallion sons Invincible Spirit and Kodiac.\n\nInvincible Spirit had a head-start over his half-brother Kodiac in establishing a sire line, which he has successfully achieved in both hemispheres.\n\nHis Group 1-winning son Kingman is one of the best young stallions in Europe and the Juddmonte sire has the top-class miler Palace Pier from his second crop.\n\nPalace Pier gave the newly-formed father and son training team of John and Thady Gosden their first Royal Ascot winner in the first race of the meeting – the Group 1 Queen Anne Stakes.\n\nIt was at the 2020 Royal meeting when Palace Pier announced himself as a miler of distinction with his first Group 1 win in the St James’s Palace Stakes and his victory on Tuesday was his fourth Group 1 success in the silver silks of Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed al Maktoum.\n\nPost-race jockey Frankie Dettori reported that he believed his mount is “one of the best horses in the world”.\n\nThe four-year-old colt was bred by Highclere Stud and Floors Farming out of the Nayef mare Beach Frolic, who was sold for 2.2m guineas at the 2020 Tattersalls December to MV Magnier following the untimely death of the tenth Duke of Roxburghe.\n\nBeach Frolic has a three-year-old Camelot colt named Tiger Beetle, who has been placed on his three most recent starts for\n\ntrainer Sir Michael Stoute and owner King Power Racing, who paid 300,000gns for him through SackvilleDonald at Tattersalls October Book 2.\n\nHer two-year-old colt from the first crop of Highland Reel was sold for 320,000gns to Jamie McCalmont at Book 1 last October and she has a yearling colt from the second crop of Almanzor.\n\nShe was amongst the elite first book of mares covered by Blue Point in 2020.\n\nMayson making ground\n\nCheveley Park Stud’s Mayson may not have garnered as many sire accolades as some of Invincible Spirit’s other stallion sons, but the Group 1 July Cup winner had an excellent Royal Ascot.\n\nHis best son Oxted added a second Group 1 to his CV in the King’s Stand Stakes, while his three-year-old son Rohaan, denied the opportunity to prove he is a bona fide Group 1 sprinter in the Commonwealth Cup because he lacks a crucial part of the male anatomy, took the Wokingham by storm.\n\nMayson also added a winner as a broodmare sire, even though his daughters have had just five runners so far.\n\nThe 2020 July Cup winner Oxted returned to form after a down-the-field run in Saudi Arabia and placed efforts in a Group 3 and a Group 2 at Newmarket and York.\n\nOxted was bred by Homestead Wealth Racing out of the Choisir mare Charlotte Rosina, one of two Group winners during the meeting for the recently retired stallion as a broodmare sire.\n\nCharlotte Rosina has a three-year-old full- brother to Oxted named Chipstead, her most recent foal.\n\nShe was bought for £45,000 by Tom Malone at the 2019 Ascot November Sale and was covered by Cable Bay in 2020 and Blue Point this year.\n\nRohaan: a future Group 1 winner for Mayson?\n\nWokingham Stakes winner Rohaan looks to be a Group 1 winner in waiting for Mayson; his nose victory in the Group 2 Sandy Lane Stakes over Dragon Symbol, first past the post in the Commonwealth Cup (G1), one of the best pieces of early sprinting form in 2021.\n\nAmazingly, the 112-rated Rohaan started his handicapping career off a mark of just 55.\n\nHe was bought by David Evans and Martin Wanless for 20,000gns at the Tattersalls Autumn Horses In Training Sale after he been given two runs as a two-year-old by George Scott. With 12 further runs under his belt since October he is now rated 112.\n\nHe is out of the Acclamation mare Vive Les Rouges.\n\nSignificantly, who is out of Rosebride by Mayson, is one of three winners from the five runners (so far) out of Mayson’s daughters and he took the Palace of Holyroodhouse Stakes for Karl Burke.\n\nBred by Cheveley Park Stud, one of a number of British breeders to enjoy Royal meeting success, he is by Garswood and is line bred 4x4 to the great Pivotal. He is also linebred 5x5 to Storm Bird and to Danzig.\n\nThe Invincible Spirit line also produced a 1-2 in the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes through his first-season sire sons Profitable and National Defense.\n\nBrazen Beau, a son of Invincible Spirit’s leading southern-hemisphere stallion son I Am Invincible, failed to ignite when shuttled to Dalham Hall by Darley for four seasons, but is enjoying something of a renaissance this year, led by the dual Listed winner Logo Hunter.\n\nAt Royal Ascot he sired the Group 3 Jersey Stakes third Vadream and the Listed Windsor Castle Stakes third Boonie, both out of Shamardal mares.\n\nCommonwealth Cup: a family affair\n\nKodiac’s sons are helping him make up for lost time as a progenitor of stallions through the emergence of Kodi Bear last season and the lightning quick start made to his career in 2021 by Ardad.\n\nKodiac himself got on the Royal Ascot Group 1 score-sheet with the assistance of the stewards. They promoted Campanelle to first place in the Group 1 Commonwealth Cup over Dragon Symbol, who would have been a first Group 1 winner for Invincible Spirit’s son Cable Bay.\n\nThe Johnny Murtagh-trained Measure Of Magic took third place and she is from the first crop of Kodi Bear.\n\nCampanelle was winning at a second successive Royal Ascot for Wesley Ward and Stonestreet Stables. Bred by Tally-Ho Stud, who have guided Kodiac from humble beginnings to the top table, Campanelle is out of the Namid mare Janina and was bought for 190,000gns by Ben McElroy at Book 1 in 2019.\n\nJanina has not produced a foal since Campanelle, having been covered by Mehmas in 2019 and Galileo Gold last year.\n\nEmulating his older half-brother Kodiac also had stallion sons sire a 1-2 in one of the meeting’s two-year-old Group contests.\n\nFirst-season sire Ardad broke his Group race duck in the Norfolk Stakes – Perfect Power leading home Go Bears Go, who is from the second crop of Kodi Bear, in the 5f contest.\n\nYoung stallions emerge\n\nThe juvenile Group races gave younger stallions an opportunity to showcase their progeny and the first and season sires grabbed the chances afforded them.\n\nAs already mentioned Invincible Spirit’s sons Profitable and National Defense sired the first two home in the Queen Mary Stakes with Profitable’s daughter Quick Suzy providing her sire and her trainer Gavin Cromwell with first Royal Ascot winners.\n\nQuick Suzy was bred by Oghill House Stud out of the Marju mare Snooze, a winner at three in Italy and a half-sister to Italian Listed winner Aria Di Festa.\n\nThe half-sisters have both provided firstseason sires with their first Group winners – Aria Di Festa is the dam of Aria Importante, a multiple Group winner at two and three by Twilight Son.\n\nQuick Suzy was sold by Cloney Stud to Aoife Dunphy at the Goffs Autumn Online Sale for just €20,000 and was sold privately to Eclipse Thoroughbreds following her success in a 6f Curragh maiden in May.\n\nSnooze has a yearling full-brother to Quick Suzy, a colt foal by Belardo and returned to Profitable this spring.\n\nProfitable, himself a Royal Ascot winner courtesy of his success in the 2016 Group 1 King’s Stand Stakes, has had eight winners at the time of writing.\n\nWesley Ward and Barbara Banke’s Twilight Gleaming, runner-up in the Queen Mary, was the most expensive yearling from the first crop of her sire, the Irish National Stud’s National Defense, winner of the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère at two.\n\nThe filly was bred by the Morrin brothers and sold by their Pier House Stud to Ben McElroy at Goffs Orby Sale at Doncaster for £75,000, she is the out of the Dansili mare Thames Pageant.\n\nShe bred by the Queen and is a half-sister to Reach For The Moon, who finished second in the Listed Chesham Stakes on the final day of Royal Ascot 2021 for Her Majesty.\n\nArdad building on fast start\n\nKodiac’s son Ardad, himself winner of the Listed Windsor Castle Stakes in 2016, leads the European first-season sires’ table at the time of writing with 12 winners from 29 runners.\n\nOne of that dozen is the Group 2 Norfolk Stakes winner Perfect Power, another successful graduate bred by Tally-Ho Stud. He was sold at the Goffs UK Breeze-Up in April for £110,000 to Blandford Bloodstock, having failed to find a buyer at Book 2 last October.\n\nHe is the first foal out of Sagely by Frozen Power, an Oasis Dream half-brother to multiple Group 1 winner Finsceal Beo.\n\nSagely won over 1m2f at three and is out of Saga Celebre, a Peintre Celebre grand-daughter of Saga D’Ouilly, a Linamix full-sister to Group 1 Arc winner and sire Sagamix and to Sage Et Jolie, the Group 2 winning dam of Sageburg.\n\nSagely has a yearling filly by Ardad’s sire Kodiac.\n\nLike his father before him, Ardad appears to be imparting speed into stouter pedigrees. He also sired the Group 2 Coventry Stakes third Vintage Clarets for Perfect Power’s trainer Richard Fahey.\n\nArdad’s paternal half-sibling Kodi Bear is a year further into his stud career. His Norfolk Stakes runner-up Go Bears Go was bred by Finsceal Beo’s owner Micheal Ryan. Kodi Bear also got the Group 1 Diamond Jubilee Stakes third Measure Of Magic from his first crop.\n\nHavana Gold: Royal Ascot glory topping a fine season\n\nHavana Gold’s biggest and best crop are two-year-olds of 2021 and they are certainly making their mark with 11 winners to date, just one fewer than Mehmas and Ardad. Chipotle, winner of the Brocklesby for Eve Johnson-Houghton, took Royal Ascot’s Listed Windsor Castle Stakes for the Tweenhills Stud’s Group 1 Prix Jean Prat winner.\n\nBred by Theakston Stud, Chipotle is the second successive winner of the race out of a mare by Makfi following Tactical in 2020.\n\nHe was bought for just 10,000gns as a yearling by his trainer and Highflyer Bloodstock having been bought back at 4,500gns as a foal by his breeders.\n\nChipotle is the second foal out of Lightsome, whose dam Aunty Mary is a Common Ground half-sister to Attraction, winner of five Group 1 races. Lightsome was covered by Havana Gold again in 2020.\n\nCotai Glory, second to Ardad in the firstseason sires’ table, was a Group 1 runner-up himself at Royal Ascot, and two of his sons gained second placings this year.\n\nEldrickjones was second to Berkshire Shadow in the Group 2 Coventry Stakes, while Dig Two, who shares his broodmare sire with Perfect Power, filled the silver medal position in the Windsor Castle.\n\nSecond season sire success\n\nSecond-season sires Bobby’s Kitten, Awtaad and New Bay also registered their first Royal Ascot winners in 2021.\n\nAwtaad and New Bay struck in threeyear-old handicaps – New Bay’s son Perotto upheld the family form by winning the Britannia Stakes for Marcus Tregoning and Halcyon Thoroughbreds.\n\nBred by China Horse Club he is the first foal out of Tschierschen, an Acclamation half-sister to Roodeye, the dam of last season’s Group 1 Sussex Stakes winner Mohaather and the second dam of Group 1 Queen Anne Stakes winner Accidental Agent.\n\nHalcyon Thoroughbreds and Tregoning, who had obviously liked what they had seen by last September of Perotto, reinvested into the next of Tschierschen progeny, a 2019-born colt by Showcasing. He cost for 30,000gns at the Goffs UK Premier Sale.\n\nAwtaad’s daughter Create Belief won the Sandringham Stakes over a mile to give Johnny Murtagh his first Royal Ascot winner as a trainer.\n\nBred by Laurence Kennedy and sold by Moyfinn Stud at Tattersalls Ireland September Yearling Sale to her trainer, Create Belief is the first foal out of Girl Of The Hour, a winning daughter of Makfi.\n\nHer second dam American Spirit is a Rock Of Gibraltar half-sister to the Derby, Racing Post Trophy and Juddmonte International winner and sire Authorized.\n\nBred in Britain\n\nBobby’s Kitten, the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint winner by Kitten’s Joy, stands at Lanwades Stud and recorded a notable victory in the Group 3 Albany Stakes. The winner Sandrine is from his second crop and is the first Group winner sired by him, and remarkably is the first Royal Ascot winner bred by Kirsten Rausing.\n\n“I bought this filly’s fifth or sixth dam as a yearling at Goffs in 1976 and the family has been with me ever since,” she said. “Everything on her catalogue page from top to bottom, we have bred at Lanwades.\n\n“All my animals are homebred, so it gives me tremendous pleasure to keep the continuity. I also tend to support my own stallions, and this filly is Bobby’s Kitten’s first stakes winner, first Group winner, so we are thrilled with that.”\n\nSandrine is the second foal out of Seychelloise, a winning daughter of Pivotal and Starlit Sands, who was successful in the Group 3 Prix d’Arenberg and second in the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes.\n\nStarlit Sands is by Oasis Dream and out of the Group 3-placed Shimmering Sea, a half-sister to the Group 1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Petoski.\n\nSeychelloise has a yearling colt from the only crop of the ill-fated Roaring Lion and has a colt from the first crop of Group 1 Prix du Jockey Club winner Study Of Man, a stud mate of Bobby’s Kitten at Lanwades.\n\nA good week for Cheveley Park\n\nDuring an excellent meeting for British owners and breeders, Cheveley Park Stud enjoyed success in all facets of their business.\n\nAs owners the red, white and blue silks were carried to success in the Group 2 Duke Of Cambridge Stakes by Indie Angel, a daughter of Dark Angel and Listed winner Indigo Lady, a daughter of Sir Percy, an another Lanwades-based stallion.\n\nBred by Ringfort Stud and Paul Hancock Indie Angel was bought by Capital Bloodstock for 600,000gns at the 2017 Tattersalls December Foal Sale.\n\nIndigo Lady has a two-year-old Churchill half-sister named Miss Clementine, who cost Ed Dunlop and BBA Ireland 90,000gns at Book 2 and a half-sister from the first crop of Blue Point.\n\nCheveley Park also bred the Group 2 Coventry Stakes winner Berkshire Shadow, another one of the three winners by Dark Angel at the meeting.\n\nBerkshire Shadow is the second foal out of Angel Vision, a winning Oasis Dream daughter of the brilliant racemare Islington. She was purchased by Cheveley Park Stud for 600,000gns from the Ballymacoll dispersal in 2017.\n\nAndrew Balding bought Berkshire Shadow for 40,000gns from Cheveley Park Stud at Book 1. Angel Vision was covered by Iffraaj this spring.\n\nThe Cheveley Park stallions past and present also brought much glory to the farm.\n\nWe have already reviewed Mayson’s exploits, but Pivotal, who was retired this spring at the age of 28, was the meeting’s\n\nmost successful broodmare sire with his daughters producing the Group 1 Prince of Wales’s Stakes winner Love, the Group 2 Queen’s Vase Kemari, and the one-two in the Group 3 Albany Stakes as Sandrine and Hello You are out of Pivotal mares.\n\nGarswood now stands in France at Haras de la Huderie, but began his stud career at his birthplace of Cheveley Park Stud. He is sire of the Palace of Holyroodhouse Stakes winner Significantly, who has Cheveley Park’s Mayson as his broodmare sire.\n\nSignificantly was the second winner of the week bred by the Thompsons.\n\nSaturday’s Wokingham Stakes also produced a 1,2,3 success for the Newmarket farm’s stallions as winner Rohaan, already\n\na Group 2 and 3 winner in 2020, is a son of Mayson, while the second and third – Fresh and King’s Lynn – have Kyllachy as their damsires.\n\nA Wonderful Hardwicke Stakes\n\nChris Wright did not breed his Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes winner Wonderful Tonight at his Stratford Place Stud, but the Le Havre filly, a dual Group 1 winner last season, will join the music mogul’s broodmare band when her racing days are over.\n\nHer owner was another prominent British breeder seeing his silks carried to victory for the first time at the Royal meeting and\n\nWright was overwhelmed by the magnitude of Wonderful Tonight’s success.\n\n“I have been running horses here for 40 years, almost every year at least one, sometimes several,” he recalled. “I’ve never ever had a winner at Royal Ascot – lots of seconds, lots of very good horses.\n\n“Culture Vulture, who won a Classic, was second twice, but I’ve never had a winner here. I almost can’t believe it!\n\n“It means everything, actually. There are winners and winners, but a Royal Ascot winner… I’ve won a lot of very good races, but to win at Royal Ascot is like I’ve died and gone to heaven!”\n\nWonderful Tonight was bred by Ecurie la Cauviniere and sold by Anna Sundstrom’s Coulonces Sales to trainer David Menuisier and Crispin de Moubray for €40,000 at Arqana’s 2018 August Yearling Sale.\n\nShe is out of Salvation, a winning daughter of Montjeu and the Listed Lingfield Oaks Trial winner Birdie, who is an Alhaarth half-sister to Fickle, the second dam of the 2,000 Guineas, Derby and Irish Derby winner Camelot (Montjeu).\n\nSalvation is also the dam of the Listed Forever Together Stakes winner Penjade (Air Chief Marshall) and has a three-yearold full-sister to Wonderful Tonight named Chuppy, who has made just one start so far for Fabrice Chappet.\n\nHer two-year-old and yearlings are both by Recorder with the juvenile colt named Ak Ishan, also in training with Fabrice Chappet.\n\nAcclamation: broodmare laurels\n\nRathbarry Stud’s stalwart has enjoyed an excellent spell recently with his sons and grandsons adding to their success and the old man getting in on the act too.\n\nAt Royal Ascot he added another string to his bow, as a broodmare sire, matching the outstanding Pivotal on three winners.\n\nHe looks to have an exciting prospect in Point Lonsdale, who gave Australia his 19th individual stakes winner when justifying favouritism in the Listed Chesham Stakes.\n\nBred by the Brosnan’s Epona Bloodstock and sold by their Croom House Stud to MV Magnier at Book 1 last year for 575,000gns he is a full-brother to Broome, who chased Wonderful Tonight home in the Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes.\n\nThe five-year-old Broome is from Australia’s first crop and was placed in the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère at two.\n\nAs a three-year-old he won the Group 3 Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and was fourth to Anthony Van Dyck in the Derby. Both he and Point Lonsdale are the best two performers from the five winners produced so far by Sweepstake, a daughter of Acclamation who won the Listed National Stakes at Sandown, was second in the Grade 3 Appalachian Stakes at Keeneland and third in the Group 3 Princess Margaret Stakes.\n\nHer dam Dust Flicker is a Suave Dancer full-sister to Group 3 Prix de la Nonette winner Dust Dancer, the second dam of Group 1 winner and stallion Zoffany.\n\nPoint Lonsdale is the 22nd stakes winner out of Acclamation’s daughters, who have three black-type winners from six runners by Australia.\n\nDark Angel tied at the top\n\nAcclamation’s son Dark Angel has surpassed his Dad’s achievements as a stallion with more Group 1 winners than him and he ended Royal Ascot 2021 tied with Frankel with three winners through the week.\n\nA pair of Dark Angel Group 2 winners, including in the highly influential Coventry Stakes, was supplemented by the victory in the Royal Hunt Cup of Real World.\n\nAll three horses were notable also for their connections to major breeding operations.\n\nIndie Angel is owed by Cheveley Park Stud and Berkshire Shadow was bred by Newmarket farm, while the four-year-old Real World is owned and bred by Godolphin.\n\nHe is out of Nafura, a Dubawi half-sister to the Group 1 Queen Anne Stakes winner and sire Dubai Destination and Librettist, who won the Group 1 Prix du Moulin and Prix Jacques le Marois.\n\nNafura is the dam of this season’s Listed Cheshire Oaks winner Dubai Fountain (Teofilo). She has a two-year-old Profitable colt named Home City, who has made two starts for Saeed Bin Suroor, including in the Listed Windsor Castle Stakes.\n\nBreeders enjoy great week with broodmare sire Danehill Dancer\n\nAt Royal Ascot 2021, Danehill Dancer’s success as a broodmare sire was facilitated by sons of Galileo – the Group 1 winners Australia and Gleneagles, who stand alongside their father at Coolmore, and the wins came in successive races.\n\nFirst up for Danehill Dancer’s daughters was Loving Dream in the Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes, a first homebred Royal Ascot winner for Trevor and Libby Harris of Lordship Stud.\n\n“We’ve never had a homebred Royal Ascot winner before,” explained Libby Harris. “It has taken\n\na long time to come so this is a very, very special moment. It really is. It was unbelievable really, the way she battled on, galloped, always quickened when the other horse came to her, she was so game and genuine, it’s just fantastic to see that.”\n\nLoving Dream is a half-sister to the Grade 1 American Oaks third Amandine (Shamardal) and they are out of Kissable, who was a Listed winner and placed in the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes.\n\nShe is from a fine Juddmonte family as a daughter of Kitty O’Shea, herself a Listed winner and a full-sister to the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy and St Leger winner Brian Boru and to Soviet Moon, the unraced dam of Derby and Arc hero Workforce by King’s Best.\n\nAnother of her full-sisters Kushnarenkova is the dam of the triple Group 1 winner Best Solution, a son of Kodiac, who stands at Gestüt Auenquelle following successes which included a win in the Caulfield Cup.\n\nKissable is a three-parts sister to the Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes winner and young Burgage Stud sire Sea Moon.\n\nKissable cost 180,000gns at the 2013 Tattersalls December Mares’ Sale and has a two-year-old Sea The Stars filly named Five Star, who was bought by Mark Johnston for 48,000gns from New England Stud at Tattersalls October Book 2.\n\nShe foaled a full-brother to Five Star this spring and her yearling is by Camelot.\n\nSubjectivist dethroned Stradivarius and derailed his bid to join Yeats with a record-equalling four Ascot Gold Cup victories.\n\nThe four-year-old son of Teofilo was backing up success in the Group 1 Prix Royal-Oak last year and the Group 2 Dubai Gold Cup at Meydan in March for owner Dr Jim Walker and trainer Johnston.\n\nBred by Susan Hearn at Mascalls Stud in Essex, he is also out of the Danehill Dancer mare Reckoning, who was bought at the Tattersalls December Mare Sale.\n\nHearn paid 160,000gns for the mare, who is from the family of the Eclipse and Irish Derby runnerup and now successful NH sire Sholokov, and Soldier Of Fortune.\n\nShe won over a mile as a twoyear-old, and was second once and third twice in three 1m2f Listed races for trainer Jeremy Noseda.\n\nReckoning has produced three black-type performers from four runners with the 2016-born Sir Ron Priestley, by Australia and still an entire, also with Group 1 form to his name. He finished third in the Group 1 St Leger in 2019, and this season has won the Group 2 Jockey Club Stakes and Listed Further Flight Stakes, also for Johnston. He beat three home in the Group 2 Hardwicke Stakes behind Wonderful Tonight.\n\nReckoning’s three-year-old Muhaarar filly Alba Rose races in the same silks as Subjectivist and is a third sibling trained by Johnston, who bought her for 100,000gns at Book 2 in 2019.\n\nShe was third in the Group 2 Rockfel Stakes last season and holds an entry in the Irish Oaks.\n\nSusan Hearn bought back Reckoning’s two-year-old Ulysses filly for 140,000gns at Book 2 and she has joined her half-siblings in Yorkshire.\n\nReckoning has a yearling colt from the only crop of Roaring Lion and was covered by Too Darn Hot in 2020.\n\nHearn’s husband Barry, who runs events such as the World Snooker Championship, spoke afterwards of his pride in his wife’s achievements.\n\n“To have the character to stand your ground and say, ‘I love this business, I love the horses I breed,’ is fantastic. Susan has had the nerve to stick with a very tough game and days like today make it worthwhile. I am very proud of her.”\n\nDANEHILL DANCER’S son Choisir, the first Australian horse to win the King’s Stand Stakes, then a Group 2, and the Group 1 Golden (now Diamond Jubilee) Stakes was also the broodmare sire of two Group winners at Royal Ascot 2021: fellow King’s Stand winner Oxted and Jersey Stakes winner Creative Force.\n\nChoisir was retired at the end of the 2020 southern-hemisphere breeding season.\n\nChoisir shuttled for eight seasons to Coolmore’s Castlehyde Stud, more than enough time to leave an important legacy.\n\nOxted is one of four individual Group 1 winners so far out of Choisir’s daughters and they include the four-time Group 1-winning miler Winter. Three of those four winners have emulated their damsire by winning a Group 1 at Royal Ascot.\n\nChoisir’s daughter Choose Me has proven herself a producer of note for John Tuthill’s Owenstown Stud and this year’s Group 3 Jersey Stakes winner Creative Force (Dubawi) is the third stakes winner that she has produced so far.\n\nChoose Me was bred by Tuthill’s late Aunt Averil Power out of the Hector Protector mare Hecuba (Hector Protector), a purchase from Juddmonte, who won the Listed Fairy Bridge Stakes over 7f at Tipperary and was placed at Group 2 and Group 3 level for the family.\n\nRetired back to her birthplace outside Maynooth, she has produced six winners from six runners to date.\n\nHer best performer so far is the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Persuasive, a daughter of Dark Angel, who was bought by Cheveley Park Stud at the 2014 Goffs Orby Sale for €140,000.\n\nShe is also the dam of Listed Sandown Distaff Stakes winner Tisbutadream (Dream Ahead).\n\nOn the back of Persuasive’s exploits in Group 1 company Choose Me was sent to Dubawi in 2017. The resulting foal is Creative Force, who was sold by Owenstown to Godolphin for €400,000 at Goffs’ Orby Sale in 2019.\n\nTuthill sent Choose Me back to Dark Angel in 2018 and she has a two-year-old colt by him who was bought for 100,000gns at the Tattersalls October Book 1 Sale by Sackville Donald."
