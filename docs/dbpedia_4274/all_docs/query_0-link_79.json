        "text": "Ryan Moore rode his first Derby winner, piloting 6-1 shot Workforce to an impressive victory in the Epsom Classic.\n\nFifth Derby winner for Sir Michael Stoute\n\nRyan Moore rode his first Investec Derby winner, piloting 6-1 shot Workforce to an impressive victory in the Epsom Classic. The colt, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, won by seven lengths in a course record time. Pacemaker and 100-1 outsider At First Sight under Seamie Heffernan was second, with Rewilding third for Frankie Dettori. The King's Best colt was settled towards the rear of the 12-runner field by the champion jockey, as Ballydoyle pacemaker At First Sight set a scorching gallop. The latter held a huge lead turning for home, but Workforce remorselessly reeled him in halfway up the straight and galloped all the way to the line. It was a first success in the world's most famous race for Moore - and the second leg of a Classic double after he secured his first Classic victory on Snow Fairy in Friday's Oaks. Stoute, who had previously trained Derby winners Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003) and North Light (2004), has never made any secret of the regard in which he holds Workforce. He arrived at Epsom on the back of just two starts, an impressive debut win at Goodwood as a juvenile and his second to Cape Blanco in the Dante on the Knavesmire. Aidan O'Brien's Jan Vermeer was sent off the hot favourite under Johnny Murtagh, but could only finish fourth.\n\nClean run\n\nMoore said: \"He had a really clean run, I was happy where I was in the race. We got a dream run and he quickened really well. The ground was fast enough for him, but he's a really good horse and I'm delighted with that. \"This is the most important race to me, it's great to ride for the boss (Stoute) and Prince Khalid (Abdullah, owner). It's a really good day.\" Stoute added: \"The Dante didn't go as we wanted and it was unsatisfactory, but he was seriously good today. \"I'm delighted for Ryan. He's a confident lad, but after he missed Conduit's win in the Leger, I wanted to get the monkey (Classic win) off his back.\" The winner's time of two minutes 31.33 seconds was nearly a second faster than the previous best course and distance time set by Lammtarra in 1995.
