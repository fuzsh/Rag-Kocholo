It was nothing searching, but he moved nicely and was stretching out well.\n\n“We’ve always said since the King George that we didn’t really want to outline any targets because we wanted him to show us that he was back in good form.\n\n“We’re trying to be fair to the horse and he looks like he’s coming back into decent shape, so there’s certainly a reasonable chance he’ll run again this season.\n\n“Obviously the Arc is an eminently suitable race for him. If you’ve won the Derby, the Arc is always a target.\n\n“If he were to go for the Arc I would think he would have a racecourse gallop beforehand.”"
