        "text": "A filly that may well have fuelled Her Majesty’s passion for racing, Carrozza was The Queen’s first British Classic winner only five years into her reign.\n\nTrained at Warren Place Stables in Newmarket by handler Noel Murless, the three-year-old was the 1957 champion of the Epsom Oaks.\n\nSent into the lead in the closing stages of the contest by legendary jockey Lester Piggott, a late challenge by Irish raider Silken Glider ensured that the race had a tight finish, but the Royal filly prevailed.\n\nCarrozza’s success at Epsom helped The Queen finish the 1957 season as Champion Owner.\n\n4 – Highclere (born in 1971)\n\nNamed after the castle that belonged to the Queen’s racing manager – where, interestingly, Downton Abbey is now filmed – Highclere was a top-class filly that not only won a British Classic, but was also highly effective as a broodmare at stud.\n\nBased in West Ilsey, Berkshire, with trainer Dick Hern, the filly’s first appearance of the 1974 season came in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket. In another tight finish, Her Majesty’s filly won by a narrow margin to provide her with a second fillies’ Classic victory – 17 years after Carrozza.\n\nHighclere would also go on to have success in France, winning the Prix de Diane.\n\nHowever, arguably, the filly’s greatest achievement was at stud. Her daughter, Height of Fashion, would go on to produce 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby champion Nashwan and multiple Group race winner Nayef.\n\n3 – Pall Mall (born in 1955)\n\nTrained in Newmarket with Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, Pall Mall would become the first British 2000 Guineas-winning colt for Her Majesty The Queen – despite being unfancied for the contest itself.\n\nEven with a victory in a Classic trial at Thirsk beforehand, The Queen’s Classic contender was a dismissed 20/1 chance.\n\nHowever, with the stable second jockey, Doug Smith, on board, Pall Mall would keep his critics quiet on the Rowley Mile track.\n\nTaking up the lead in the closing stages, the three-year-old colt never looked back – winning by a one and half-length margin. Unfortunately, due to illness, Her Majesty was not present for the victory.\n\nThe Queen would, though, see him at his very best – winning the 1958 and 1959 Lockinge Stakes at Newbury.\n\n2 – Estimate (born in 2009)\n\nEstimate’s career success would let the world see how much racing means to Her Majesty The Queen.\n\nThe Sir Michael Stoute-trained filly was originally an eightieth birthday present from the Aga Khan, but she turned out to be one of The Queen’s best ever horses.\n\nWinner of the Queen’s Vase Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2012, the daughter of Monsun would send the entire country into raptures in the following season’s Gold Cup.\n\nAlongside the Derby, the Royal Ascot feature contest was a prize that Her Majesty was determined to win.\n\nWith Ryan Moore on board, her dream became a reality in 2013. Fighting doggedly in the closing stages, Estimate would claim one of the sport’s biggest prizes by the narrowest of margins at the Berkshire track. The Queen was now a Gold Cup champion!\n\n1 – Dunfermline (born in 1974)\n\nOur number one! It takes a mighty horse to knock Estimate off the top spot, but we believe that Dunfermline was just that.\n\nAfter winning the Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket, Her Majesty’s filly was aimed at the Epsom Oaks as a fancied contender. With the Queen in attendance, Dunfermline stayed on strongly to repel her rivals and win the fillies’ Classic.\n\nThough, it was her performance in the same season’s St Leger that made her shine as a superstar. Up against the short-priced favourite Alleged, Dunfermline was going to be in for an almighty battle.\n\nHer Majesty’s filly, ridden by Willie Carson, was caught up in a tense battle in the dying stages of the race, but it was Dunfermline who won the prolonged duel by a one-and-a-half-length margin.\n\nA double Classic champion, she was also one of the best fillies of the twentieth century. Enjoy the roar for the Royal winner…"
