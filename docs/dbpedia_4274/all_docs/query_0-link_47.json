        "text": "Stoute readily admits he was totally confused after this year’s King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in the summer.\n\nHis progressive four-year-old Harbinger performed way above himself to win the race in spectacular style by 11 lengths, taking him into another stratosphere as a racehorse.\n\nBut, in stark contrast, his three-year-old star Workforce, who had been every bit as impressive in winning the Derby by seven lengths in record time the previous month, ran an absolute shocker.\n\nElation and devastation in a few dramatic minutes – it is rare for one trainer to experience such different emotions in one short race.\n\n“I did a lot of thinking after that,” Stoute admitted in an exclusive interview with Telegraph Sport as he reflected on his achievement of finally winning the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, the one major race in Europe to have eluded him in an outstanding training career that also, of course, embraces the experience of training Shergar.\n\nThat thinking extended to weeks as the trainer set about the task of trying to find out what went wrong at Ascot. It involved an analysis of Workforce’s mental and physical state through 24-hour observation of the horse by Stoute’s highly experienced stable staff.\n\nStoute had 71 days in which to decide whether there was any chance of success with the challenging project to restore Workforce’s confidence, not to mention the colt’s reputation, which had taken such a battering after Harbinger’s 17-length thrashing in the King George.\n\n“We were not going to go to Paris if he wasn’t in good shape. We owed it to the horse himself. It was a hard call,” the trainer admitted in the first hint of the anxiety that surrounded the decision.\n\nSo, was it Workforce’s temperament or a physical deficiency that had been exposed at Ascot? As the Arc preparation started to take shape, Stoute became gradually more optimistic of finding answers.\n\n“It was a process of closing the parameters. I was always happy with his mind. I was training him better,” he said. “Every stage [in the training programme] had to be acceptable. It involved checking blood, making sure that scopes were clear.”\n\nBut, importantly, it also involved altering the colt’s regime.\n\n“Basically, I was less tough on him in his training. His gallops were less frequent, and the serious work was against weaker opposition,” Stoute said. The thought process was extensive, tapping into the experience gained in his 38 years as a trainer to provide the answers.\n\nIt had been a long haul since his arrival at Pat Rohan’s stables in Yorkshire in the 1960s. Rohan thought the young man from Barbados was looking for a job in the racing media, but Stoute harboured ambitions to become the next Noel Murless.\n\nStoute recalled: “There were some wonderful professionals that I regarded highly, but the more I was exposed to the game, Vincent O’Brien became my hero. And he still is today. He was so international, so forward-thinking, a pioneer.\n\n\"I got to know him pretty well. He had a few horses with me, fillies that he owned with Robert Sangster. He was the real maestro in my opinion.”\n\nO’Brien, who died last year, won three Arcs, with Ballymoss (1958) and Alleged twice (1977-78), and is widely regarded as having been the greatest and most skilful trainer of the 20th century. It is in this historical context that Stoute enjoyed his first Arc triumph, performing such wonders with his colt.\n\nHe has wealthy owners providing unswerving support, skilled and loyal staff, and more importantly, he has the horses.\n\nA ballpark figure on the overall value of his 'second lot’ of any normal morning is £10 million."
