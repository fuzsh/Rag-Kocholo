We've got him running to 115, and At First Sight (second) therefore is 116.\n\n\"We thought the winner won easily enough, but instead of calling it seven lengths we have called it eight.\n\n\"We work on one and half pounds per length over a mile and a half (2400m) so he comes out a 12lb better horse than At First Sight, so it puts him on 128.\n\n\"That's very high for a Derby-winning performance.\n\n\"We've had Derby winners eventually get higher than that, obviously See The Stars last year.\n\n\"We put him on 124 (after the Derby) and it was more his Eclipse and Irish Champion Stakes performances that saw him go higher.\"\n\nTimeform provisionally rate Workforce on 132 making it their best Derby-winning performance since Generous in 1991.\n\nWinning jockey Ryan Moore believes Workforce had improved 20lb from his run in the Dante Stakes at York.\n\n\"I have never had a (middle-distance) horse quicken like that and I have never been round the bend at Epsom so quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"He was a different horse from the Dante and must have improved 20lb.\"\n\nThe Irish Derby in three weeks' time is the obvious next port of call for Workforce, although a final decision will not be made until nearer the time.\n\n\"It was a very exciting performance and he's come out of the race absolutely fine,\" said the owner's racing manager, Teddy Grimthorpe.\n\n\"The Irish Derby would look the obvious next step, but we'll just see how the horse takes this race and sit down and make a plan for the rest of the season.\""
