        "text": "WONDERFUL Workforce earned Sir Michael Stoute his fifth Derby success - and jockey Ryan Moore his first - with a brilliant, record-breaking victory at Epsom yesterday.\n\nThe three-year-old smashed the course record in romping to a seven-length success in the world's greatest flat race.\n\nAnd it completed a dream Classic double for Moore after winning the Oaks aboard Snow Fairy on Friday.\n\nA 6-1 chance after finishing second in the Dante at York, the King's Best colt was settled towards the rear by the champion jockey as Ballydoyle pacemaker At First Sight set a scorching gallop.\n\nAmazing The Aiden O'Brien charge held a huge lead turning for home. But Workforce - having only his third start - mowed him down up the straight and galloped all the way to the line to score impressively.\n\nAt First Sight, sent off at 100-1, ran a blinder for second while Rewilding (9-2) was third for Frankie Dettori.\n\nO'Brien's Jan Vermeer was sent off the 9-4 favourite under Johnny Murtagh but could only finish fourth.\n\nMoore said: \"He had a really clean run, I was happy where I was in the race.\n\n\"We got a dream run and he quickened up exceptionally well. He's a really good horse and I'm delighted. This is the most important race. It's great to ride for the boss (Stoute) and Prince Khalid (Abdullah, owner).\n\n\"It was amazing the reception - it's a special day.\"\n\nWorkforce's t ime of two minutes 31.33 seconds eclipsed Lammtarra's record set in 1995 by almost a second.\n\nStoute has a terrific record in the race and Workforce's triumph adds to those of Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003) and North Light (2004).\n\nAnd the master handler said: \"Winning the Derby seems to get sweeter and sweeter and that was a very, very exhilarating display.\n\n\"I wanted to give him two races before the Derby and the one race I did give him didn't work out. But that doesn't matter now.\n\n\"I was under no pressure to run him and he wouldn't have done if Ryan and I didn't think he had a good chance.\n\n\"We will take him home, chill him out, have a chat and see what we do. The Irish Derby is the obvious place to go but let's just see how he comes out of it.\"\n\nStoute added: \"I'm delighted for Ryan. He's a confident lad but after missing Conduit's win in the Leger for us, I wanted to get the monkey (Classic win) off his back.\n\n\"It's been his great ambition to win the Derby and he has put a lot of work into this horse.\" At First Sight's rider Seamie Heffernan said: \"I was second on one of the favourites Fame And Glory last year and I was second on an outsider today.\n\n\"My experience of the course helped and they just let me go.\"\n\nO'Brien said: \"Jan Vermeer lost both his front shoes but the second horse stayed really well. The winner looked exceptional.\"\n\nTrainer Saeed bin Suroor was happy with third-placed Rewilding. He said: \"The horse still needs the experience and he will be better later on in the season.\n\n\"Frankie said a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half is his trip. I don't think he's a Leger horse, he has a lot of speed.\""
