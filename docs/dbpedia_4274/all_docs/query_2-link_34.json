        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute became the winning-most trainer in Royal Ascot history yesterday when, 41 years after his first, Poet’s Word became his 76th winner at the meeting coming home a comfortable victor of the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes.\n\nThe bookmakers may not always have been huge fans of Stoute’s constant stream of winners but Poet’s Word did them a huge favour by beating a lacklustre Cracksman, the 2-5 favourite, who either could not or would not, by 2½ lengths.\n\nIn the space of two minutes, the highest-ranked horse to grace this year’s Royal Ascot went from banker of the meeting to undoubted disappointment of the week. For the nation’s turf accountants, however, it was profit instead of loss.\n\nStoute’s first winner was Etienne Gerard in the 1977 Jersey Stakes. But since Dartmouth won the Hardwicke in 2016, like a batsman stuck on 99, Stoute had been level with the late Sir Henry Cecil on 75 winners.\n\nLast year he ran 16 horses, including a hatful of favourites, but none obliged and although the 72-year-old is not the type of man to settle for second he might have done with seven lengths separating his horse and Cracksman on their previous Ascot meeting.\n\nBut with every stride of yesterday’s race his confidence must have grown for almost as soon as the stalls opened the writing was on the wall for Cracksman with Dettori having to scrub him along just to hold a half-decent position.\n\n“He was not the same horse that I have been riding this spring,” said Dettori, who in 24 hours went from feast to famine. “He was lethargic, never travelling. Usually when he turns into the straight the turbo kicks in but there was nothing.”\n\nIt was telling that the runner-up’s nearest and dearest, John Gosden and Anthony Oppenheimer, both hinted it might be more mental than physical. “The ability is there but I don’t feel he’s being generous with it,” said the trainer. His owner-breeder proposed cheekpieces in the King George.\n\n“I was not confident,” explained Stoute. “He beat us comprehensively in the Champion Stakes but our horse is a model of consistency. He was second in the Irish Champion and ran a blinder in Dubai. He deserved a win at this level.\n\n“I thought he’d win 150 yards into the straight. It [the record] will mean a lot to the stable. Henry was a great friend and accumulated most of his winners when Ascot was a four-day meeting, so I’ve had more cracks at it than he did.”\n\nUnderlining Stoute’s genius was the victory of Expert Eye, winner number 77, in Jersey Stakes. Since he won the Vintage Stakes last August he has done nothing but disappoint but here he was back to his best and scored an impressive win under Australian short-term import James McDonald.\n\nIf Aidan O’Brien, Stoute’s nearest pursuer these days, does not have a winner on the first day of Ascot there is a tendency to think he is having a bad week.\n\nKew Gardens got him off the mark yesterday though, leading home a Ballydoyle one-two-three in the Queen’s Vase.\n\nAnd as good as it was for O’Brien it was also good for the Investec Derby in which Kew Gardens finished ninth, beaten 27 lengths by Masar.\n\nIf the long-term plans of Phoenix Thoroughbreds, who have gone from nought to 150 horses worldwide in a year, come to fruition Coolmore will, by 2022, have been relegated to the world’s second-most successful owner.\n\nRacing’s newest big player, a conglomerate of major investors from around the world, has already made its mark in the sales rings and is now beginning to make its presence felt on the racecourse. Gronkowski was runner-up in the Belmont Stakes while Advertise was only beaten a length in the Coventry on Tuesday."
