        "text": "PATIENCE received its reward as Mustashry gave Sir Michael Stoute an eighth victory in the Group 1 Al Shaqab Lockinge Stakes.\n\nAlthough he has saddled the winner of 15 British Classics in a legendary career that began in 1972, Stoute has consistently excelled with horses that need time.\n\nMustashry, partnered by owner Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum’s No 1jockey Jim Crowley, exemplified his trainer’s skill with a two-and-a-half-length success on his first try in a domestic Group 1 - at the age of six.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what age they are - as long as you can find a peak!” laughed the master of Newmarket’s Freemason Lodge Stable, who captured the one-mile test for older horses for the first time in 1986 with Scottish Reel.\n\nHaving scored twice at Group 2 level last autumn, Mustashry would have been in line for a stallion career - had he not been gelded in the spring.\n\n“We had a lot of encouragement last back and and then this spring his work has been good quality,” added Stoute, improving his own record of seven Lockinge victories, of the 9-1 winner.\n\n“He has come home and he has just progressed and progressed. We knew he was in very good shape - I don’t think we’ve ever had him in better shape.\n\n“You couldn’t be confident he would win the Lockinge, but I thought he had a great chance.”\n\nRoyal Ascot ’s Queen Anne Stakes, another Group 1 for four-year-olds and above, is next for the winner, where he will again cross swords with runner-up Laurens.\n\nThe Karl Burke-saddled filly, seeking a fifth win in the top tier, travelled with menace under jockey PJ McDonald, and the Middleham trainer said: “She’ll come on a fraction - a length or two.\n\n“PJ just thought she changed legs and had a little wobble - just fractionally had a blow - when Jim came to his girth.\n\n“Then, in the last 100 yards, you could see that she got her second wind and stayed on again.\n\n“You’re always disappointed when you get beat but it comes to something when you are disappointed for finishing second in a Group 1.”\n\nMustashry’s victory was the middle leg of a treble for Stoute, completed by Oaks possible Queen Power in the Listed Fillies’ Trial Stakes, and initiated by Crystal Ocean’s two-length margin in the Group 3 Al Rayyan Stakes.\n\nThe 2-9 favourite was backing up his triumph of 2018 and will now attempt to better three Group 1 seconds in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot.\n\n“It was a mess of a race, but he handled everything quite comfortably,” said the five-year-old’s rider Ryan Moore.\n\n“He’s well up to winning a Group 1 - he’s getting better and better.”"
