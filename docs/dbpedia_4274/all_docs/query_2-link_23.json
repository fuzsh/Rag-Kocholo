        "text": "\"Stoute's Arc curse strikes again\" was the headline over many reports about Harbinger's injury on the gallops last weekend. I must have missed the meeting where the racing media conferred official \"cursed\" status on Sir Michael Stoute's record in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Presumably it was before Harbinger, because a curse has to strike at least once before it can be said to strike again.\n\nNever mind. In light of what happened to Harbinger, there can be no doubt, even among those of us who reject superstition, that the trainer has been spilling a lot of salt, breaking many mirrors, has angered some evil spirit or is perhaps up against the fixed will of the racing gods themselves. The next time one of his horses has a recognisable chance in the French race but fails to win, the curse headlines will be everywhere, and rightly so.\n\nConsider his record in other top-class middle-distance races. He has won the Derby, the Eclipse, the King George, the Juddmonte International and the Coronation Cup five times each. He is also a multiple winner of the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the Champion Stakes and the Oaks.\n\nOutside Britain, he has won the Japan Cup, the Hong Kong Vase, the Dubai World Cup, the Canadian International, the Irish Derby, the Irish Oaks, the Irish Champion Stakes, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Grosser Preis von Baden, with more than one success in several of those. He has racked up four victories in the Breeders' Cup Turf.\n\nHow is it possible that a man can produce enough talent to win all that international glory and the vast quantities of prize money that come with it, yet he can't manage a single, solitary success in the Arc?\n\nThe race is the most prestigious in Europe, of course, but it has not presented an insurmountable challenge to British-based trainers. It has fallen to Ian Balding, Barry Hills, Jeremy Tree, Guy Harwood, Michael Jarvis and, three times, to Saeed bin Suroor. Clive Brittain came within a neck of winning it, Marcus Tregoning within three-quarters of a length. Those are all fine trainers but you would imagine there are few races they could crack which Stoute could not.\n\nReportedly, the trainer believes his best chance came and went with Shernazar, Shergar's half-brother who finished unplaced behind Sagace and Rainbow Quest in 1985, having suffered terrible trouble in running.\n\nBelow, I've listed the last five Stoute-trained horses to finish in the first four in the Arc. That means we're missing out horses like Islington and North Light, that ran well without making it into the first four, as well as Opera House and Shahrastani from longer ago. It's interesting to see how dependent Stoute has been on the produce of the late Lord Weinstock's Ballymacoll Stud, without which he wouldn't have had a horse in the first four for 16 years.\n\n1) Ezzoud, 4th in 1994\n\nDespite having won an Eclipse and two York Internationals, Ezzoud was supposed to be a bit of a rogue who wouldn't put it all in. Blinkered or visored for most races, he had managed to unseat Walter Swinburn as they came out of the stalls for the King George.\n\nNow five and having his last race in Europe, Ezzoud tracked the pace on the inside and seemed well placed at the top of the straight, with the pack closing on the tiring Broadway Flyer. There was a brief moment when Ezzoud may have had a share of the lead but, from that point, other challengers proved stronger (or, if you believe his reputation, more resolute).\n\nApple Tree moved up his inside, while Carnegie and Hernando swooped past up the middle of the track. Ezzoud plugged on to be a close fourth, beaten three-quarters of a length at 19-1.\n\n2) Pilsudski, 2nd in 1996\n\nOne of those \"classic Stoute improvers\" people talk about, Pilsudski was confined to handicap company as a three-year-old and didn't get his first chance in a Group One until the month before this Arc, when he won the Grosser Preis von Baden. Unfancied at 22-1, he tracked the winner, Helissio, throughout the race but looked outclassed when that one shot clear in the straight.\n\nPilsudski got tired close home but held on for second place. Those behind included Swain, Shaamit and Pentire.\n\n3) Pilsudski, 2nd in 1997\n\nA year later, Pilsudski had three more Group One wins to his name, including a Breeders' Cup triumph, and was a much more respectable 4-1. Once again, however, he ran up against a brilliant winner. Peintre Celebre quickened away to win by five lengths.\n\nMick Kinane rode Pilsudski with more restraint than Swinburn had the year before but the horse was travelling beautifully and ahead of the winner until the turn for home, when Peintre Celebre whistled past. Pilsudski finished clear of the pack this time, with Helissio and Swain comfortably held. It was the horse's last defeat, as he closed out his career by winning the Champion Stakes and the Japan Cup.\n\n4) Golan, 4th in 2001\n\nThe 2,000 Guineas winner, Golan had been well beaten by Galileo in the English and Irish Derbys. Still, he shored up his reputation in time for the Arc by winning the Prix Niel over the course and distance three weeks before and was sent off at 15-2.\n\nHe tried gamely under Kieren Fallon but struggled to see out the trip on soft going. He made it to second early in the straight but never looked able to match Sakhee, a runaway winner, and lost two places close home.\n\n5) Conduit, 4th in 2009\n\nThe horse who finally won Stoute a St Leger, Conduit had also won a Breeders' Cup Turf and a King George. That's an impressive roll call of major races but Conduit was still an 8-1 shot for the Arc because he was up against Sea The Stars. He had trailed John Oxx's runner by five lengths in the Eclipse and few believed he could turn it around.\n\nFor much of the race he ran alongside Sea The Stars but took longer to pick up after the turn for home and took a tougher route around the outside of the pack. By the time the line came, he was running on strongly and could have gone past Youmzain and Cavalryman in a few more strides. Sea The Stars, meanwhile, had won by an easy couple of lengths."
