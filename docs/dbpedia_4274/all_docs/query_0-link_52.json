We’re very happy with his condition and it looks a particularly strong renewal of the Arc this year. It’s disappointing we’re having this Indian summer in Paris.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.
