        "text": "Zacinto is peaking at just the right time to give Sir Michael Stoute a remarkable sixth Coral-Eclipse triumph in 17 years at Sandown this week.\n\nThe Newmarket trainer, on a high after landing his fifth Derby with Workforce three weeks ago, first won the 10-furlong showpiece with Opera House in 1993.\n\nSince then his record in the race is unmatched, so there is plenty of confidence behind Zacinto even though he is still seeking his first Group 1 victory.\n\nThe Khalid Abdulla-owned colt has always promised to be a top-level performer.\n\nHe went a long way towards justifying his reputation when winning the Celebration Mile at Goodwood and chasing home Rip Van Winkle in the QEII Stakes at Ascot last September.\n\nThose performances were made even more meritorious by the fact that he had missed the first half of the season through injury.\n\nThey also persuaded Stoute to send him to California for the Breeders' Cup Mile, but misfortune struck again as he pulled up lame on the home turn.\n\nAs a result he's been a bit of a slow burner this season, with the trainer anxious to bring him back gradually, but the signs are he's ready to catch fire now he makes the long-awaited step up in trip.\n\n\"We had been thinking of moving him up to 10 furlongs for the Champion Stakes last autumn but he ran so well in the QEII that we decided to keep him to a mile and go for the huge prize-money in America,\" said Stoute.\n\n\"That didn't work out and it's true he's not enjoyed the best of luck so far, but I still have plenty of faith in him.\n\n\"Both his work at home and the pick of his performances on the track suggest he's a very good horse when he's right.\"\n\nA poor reappearance effort in the Lockinge - \"he got very uptight in the racecourse stables beforehand and never ran his race\" - was followed by a much more encouraging display in a hot renewal of the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot, in which he finished just over four lengths fourth to Goldikova and Paco Boy.\n\n\"I was very pleased with that in light of what had happened at Newbury. As I'd suspected that first run had taken the freshness out of him and he behaved himself impeccably.\n\n\"I thought it was a good run in the circumstances. The oppositon was very strong and he just lacked a bit of pace in that company.\n\n\"We've been looking forward to running him over a longer trip for a while and, mentally, he's ready for it now.\"\n\nZacinto will help form a powerful two-pronged assault by Abdulla, who also has the Henry Cecil-trained Twice Over lined up for the race.\n\nWinner of last year's Champion - the race Zacinto sidestepped last year - he underlined his wellbeing with a fast-finishing second to Byword, also Abdulla-owned, in the Prince Of Wales's at the royal meeting.\n\nThat didn't look a great renewal, though, with two 40-1 shots close behind, and while Twice Over sets the benchmark, the stage is set for a relatively unexposed horse such as Zacinto to take the starring role next Saturday.\n\nSTOUTE'S ECLIPSE STARS\n\n1993: Opera House\n\n9-2 1994: Ezzoud 5-1\n\n1997: Pilsudski 11-2\n\n2001: Medicean 7-2\n\n2007: Notnowcato 7-1"
