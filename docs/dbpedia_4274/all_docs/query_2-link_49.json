        "text": "It’s a fair bet that few point-to-point jockeys have ridden winners in the Caribbean, but Joe Stevenson has!\n\nUnlike many subjects of this series, 41-year-old Joe arrived late on the pointing scene and didn’t ride his first winner between the flags until he partnered Ultra Viers to success at Garthorpe in April – over 15 years after his last success under rules! Jake Exelby caught up with Joe to find out about his varied career in racing and his passion for team chasing.\n\nHow did you get into racing in the first place?\n\nI’m from Nottingham originally and have worked in racing on and off since I was 16. I saw an advert in a local paper and went to work for Michael Chapman at Market Rasen – I don’t think I even knew what a jockey was! That was in the era of (one of Michael’s more prolific horses, running 144 times in total) Non Vintage – I learnt to ride on him.\n\nI then moved to Karl Burke’s, floated around Newmarket for a bit, then took out my jockey’s licence aged 20 to ride for Philip Pritchard, near Cheltenham. I had my first winner for him on Blueshaan at Hereford in May 2002. After that, I went to Richard ‘Bomber’ Marvin’s and had a few rides on the flat as an apprentice. When I was 22, I saw an ad in a paper again for riders in Barbados and thought it would be an experience.\n\nJoe on his first rules winner - Blueshaan at Hereford\n\nTell me about your time riding in Barbados\n\nI was based with Bill Marshall, who used to train over here and was serial champion trainer in Barbados. I arrived on a Thursday and had to sort out my visa before having four rides on the Saturday – I hadn’t even sat on a horse in the country until I was legged-up on the first! I had about 50 rides and two winners – I even rode a horse owned by Sir Michael Stoute, who is Barbadian himself. We were flattened on the bend but not beaten far.\n\nJoe winning on Feet On Flames in Barbados\n\nThey only race at Garrison Savannah once a fortnight and it’s a great way of life, On non-racing days, they do track work, like in America. You’re not given the horses’ names – just a list of numbers. You’re finished by 8am because of the heat, so I was on the beach the whole time, sunbathing and swimming.\n\nJoe winning on Noble Import in Barbados\n\nI also rode in Jamaica and Trinidad. The track there was like the old Southwell surface, but even deeper. You’d go flat out for 100 metres then be off the bridle!\n\nDo you have any funny stories from your time riding there?\n\nThe funniest thing I’ve ever seen was a jockey who hadn’t ridden to instructions being chased down the course by Bill Marshall… on a mobility scooter!\n\nWhy did you leave racing for a time and how did you get back into it?\n\nI came back from Barbados because of issues with my weight – they rode lighter over there – and went to work for Robin Dickin. I rode one winner over hurdles for him but struggled to get rides and stopped in my late twenties. I wanted to go back to being an amateur but was too old at the time – they didn’t change the rules until a few years later. I got an HGV licence and started driving lorries for a living, then about eight years ago, I got offered a job by the late John O’Neill, who trained near Towcester, and got back into it full-time.\n\nJoe riding for the late John O'Neill\n\nI started riding in points in 2019 and am now head lad for Ben Case.\n\nJoe on Belles Benefit for Ben Case\n\nYou own and train horses as well – talk me through them\n\nI’ve had Bite My Tongue since I started pointing. I used to train pointers (unofficially) in my 20s, so I thought I’d give it a go with him. He showed promise in his first season but didn’t want to know recently so has been retired but will make a great team chaser. I also have Trojan Star, who’ll be back next season and I own Miss Connaisseur, who’s trained by Ben under rules. She’s been placed twice and I’m hoping to ride her in amateur races on the flat.\n\nJoe on his Trojan Star\n\nHow did you get the connection with Phillippa Taylor (trainer of Ultra Viers)?\n\nPhillippa trains just across the road from where John used to, and she had Finula – who I rode every day – with him. I used to look after her hunters and exercise her pointers – Guttural, Idee De Garde and Ultra Viers – if her daughters (fellow riders Phoebe and Verity) weren’t around. I was due to ride them in points before Covid came along, then I would have ridden Guttural the day Zac Baker won on him at Edgcote, but it clashed with the Team Chasing Championships! I had four team chasers of my own, rode for other people and was getting seven or eight rides a week – I’d barely have that many a season in points!\n\nJoe with Phillippa after Ultra Viers won at Garthorpe\n\nTell me about your involvement with team chasing\n\nI ride for Team Ride Away and we’re up there with the best. One of my fellow riders is Charlotte Alexander, who used to ride in points and who has team chased the likes of Earthmover, Denman and now Silviniaco Conti. I used to have Scots Grey, who won the Aintree Foxhunters with Richard Burton, and now ride Melon – who was second at four consecutive Cheltenham Festivals for Willie Mullins – and San Cassiano, who won 13 on the flat for Ruth Carr.\n\nJoe team chasing Aintree Foxhunters winner Scots Grey\n\nJoe team chasing Melon\n\nJoe team chasing his current star, San Cassiano\n\nWhat were your conflicting emotions when you were just beaten on Ultra Viers at Kimble (pictured above), then won at Garthorpe?\n\nAfter Garthorpe, I had to pinch myself – it felt like my first winner all over again. At Kimble, I was gutted. I didn’t realise it was Charlie (Case, son on Joe’s employer!) who’d beaten me by a head until I saw the colours. It’s completely different to team chasing, where you have to wait until the last riders have finished (to find out the winning time). I was back team chasing the day after Garthorpe, but fell and broke my wrist, which is why I haven’t ridden him since.\n\nJoe with Ultra Viers after winning at Garthorpe\n\nWhat are your ambitions in pointing?\n\nI’m not planning on giving up yet! Just to ride a few more winners and, mainly, to train a winner.\n\nWhich other jockeys do you admire and why?\n\nRuby Walsh is my all-time favourite. In points, I like the way Amber Jackson-Fennell has set herself out – she was clever to stop early last year and stay as a novice and she threw everything at it this year to try and win the title (she was pipped by Molly Landau at Umberleigh last weekend).\n\nWhat would you do if you were in charge of the sport?\n\nI’d do my best to stop professional trainers taking all the prizes with highly rated horses. If you’re a smaller yard, you don’t have much of a chance, especially in Maidens, which takes some of the fun out of it. I don’t disagree with giving opportunities to young jockeys, but it’s meant to be an amateur sport.\n\nHow would you encourage more horses?\n\nI’d bring the costs of qualification down. People are packing it in, not just because they don’t see the point if they’ve got no chance of having a winner, but because of the cost.\n\nWhat would you do if you weren’t involved with horses?\n\nI’d probably still be driving lorries, although I was offered a job as a trainee chef on a cruise ship when I was younger, because I was good at Home Economics at school – I’d have liked to have done that.\n\nDo you have any hobbies outside racing?\n\nJust team chasing – no non-horsey hobbies. Although I play pool. Am I good? Well, I used to play for a team, but now I just play at my local, the Hare & Hounds in Wardington.\n\nWhat about music? Do you have a favourite band or singer?\n\nI wouldn’t have a clue and I’m terrible with names. I just listen to the radio and sing along to Britney Spears!"
