I was delighted to win the Oaks but this is the most important race for me and to win it for the boss (Stoute) too is even more special.\"\n\nWorkforce's owner, Saudi Arabian Prince Khalid Abdullah, had won the race twice previously, the last time in 1993 with Commander in Chief but this was a special one for him.\n\n\"All winners are great to have but the manner in which Workforce won is very special,\" Prince Abdullah said.\n\nMoore had plenty of work to do as the 12 runner field entered the finishing straight as At First Sight - the pacemaker for favourite Jan Vermeer - had a 10 length advantage and showed no signs of stopping under Jamie Heffernan.\n\nMoore, though, ate bit by bit into the Aidan O'Brien-trained runner's lead and with just under two furlongs (400m) to go drew level and passed him and from then on it was just a case of how far he would win by.\n\nAt First Sight stayed on bravely and got a deserved second place while Rewilding, under Frankie Dettori, ran on well.\n\nJan Vermeer, who had replaced St Nicholas Abbey as favourite for the race last week after the latter was withdrawn, ran fourth without ever threatening to give O'Brien a third win in the race.\n\nAnother Godolphin runner Alzir was sixth, though, he was fortunate to have three-time Derby winning jockey Fallon on board.\n\nThe troubled Irishman - who was having his first ride in the race since 2006 - had got stuck in traffic and then left his family in the car while he took a train and then a taxi to the track arriving barely an hour before the race.\n\nWorkforce's equine rivals would probably have wished that the same problems had been encountered by him on the way to the racecourse."
