        "text": "Olivier Peslier has been named as the jockey to ride Harbinger in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on Saturday week.\n\nThe experienced Frenchman will renew an association with the trainer Sir Michael Stoute, which saw him partner Ask to finish third in the race last year behind Conduit and Tartan Bearer.\n\nRyan Moore has been on board the four-year-old in all of his starts so far, but will partner the Derby winner Workforce and the fascinating head-to-head clash between the stablemates dominates the ante-post betting for the Betfair-sponsored contest.\n\nStoute confirmed the booking this morning, just hours after William Hill had raised eyebrows when installing Peslier as their 5-4 favourite to take the ride despite the fact that Frankie Dettori and Kieren Fallon had previously been thought to be the leading contenders.\n\nHowever, whereas Dettori may have a commitment to partner Godolphin's Cavalryman in the same contest and Fallon has barely had a ride for Stoute since his comeback at the end of last year, Peslier has a previous association with both trainer and owner having partnered the Stoute-trained Delilah to win the Princess Royal Stakes at Ascot in 1997.\n\nOwner Highclere Thoroughbred Racing's managing director Harry Herbert said this morning: \"We are thrilled that Olivier will be riding Harbinger. He is a world-class jockey and we have enjoyed a number of successes over the years. He will ride Harbinger in a piece of work this weekend and hopefully we are now all set for the big race on the 24th.\"\n\nWorkforce is currently trading at just under even-money for the race on Betfair, with Harbinger a 100-30 chance. The Irish Derby winner Cape Blanco, who beat Workforce in York's Dante Stakes in May, is next in the market at 11-1."
