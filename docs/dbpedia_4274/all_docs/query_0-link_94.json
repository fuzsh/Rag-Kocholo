        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute’s runner has been a ‘talking horse’ throughout the winter months and will have to prove himself at this higher level if he is to go to Epsom for the Derby next month as a live contender.\n\nHe has only one run on his record – a Goodwood maiden last September – but he was mighty impressive in slamming his rivals by six lengths and more.\n\nFitness won’t be a factor as Stoute is sure to have him pretty near 100 per cent fit for this seasonal debut.\n\nSARISKA (2.10) completed the English-Irish Oaks double last season and should have too much class for her Middleton Stakes rivals. She hasn’t been seen since last October but goes well fresh and won on her juvenile debut.\n\nRIEVAULX WORLD (1.40) can get punters off to a flyer in the opener. His trainer Kevin Ryan has been in sparkling form from the first day of the season and Rievaulx World showed he was returning to something like his best when a fairly close-up seventh at Epsom last time."
