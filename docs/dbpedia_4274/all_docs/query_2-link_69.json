        "text": "If the old pals could not bring the Caribbean weather to Royal Ascot, West Indies cricket legend Michael Holding did at least bring good fortune to his great mate Sir Michael Stoute, whose Crystal Ocean delivered an 80th Royal meeting winner for the Barbados-born trainer.\n\nHolding, working here this week for Sky Sports Racing, is a summer fixture at Stoute’s Newmarket yard, and celebrated victory in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes with as much gusto as he once showed in terrifying English batsmen.\n\n“A tremendous win,” he said of Crystal Ocean. “Stoutey always thought he had a Group One win in him and this was a great ride and performance. Delighted to see that horse finally get a major race.”\n\nHolding and Stoute have been firm friends since 1985 and the former cricketer is never happier than when watching the horses work out of Stoute’s Freemason Lodge Stables.\n\n“I had horses in Jamaica with a trainer called Nigel Nunes, and his daughter married a Bajan friend of mine. I was over in England playing at Derbyshire and my friend called up and said, ‘would you like to come and meet Stoutey?’ and I said, ‘you bet: name the day and the time, I’ll be there.’\n\n“I would go out on the gallops with him and then since I started working for Sky Cricket in 1998 I rented, and later a bought, a place in Newmarket. I absolutely love it. I am there from late May until September every year. Every morning up at half five, watch them work, then we have breakfast and the second lot go out.”\n\nFor Holding, it is not so much the thrill of the race day but the pleasure of watching the horses being trained that he loves.\n\n“I hardly ever come racing. I’ve been to Royal Ascot only once before this week. I got invited by someone who you definitely can’t refuse,” he laughed, referring to an invitation from the Queen, open-top carriage ride and all. “But other than that, I am not so bothered for coming to the track but I love to be out on the gallops, rain or shine, watching those athletes, the beauty and the grace of the horses.”\n\nBeauty and grace were two of the attributes you could certainly apply to the way Holding played his own sport, with of course the fear factor that he instilled in opponents that gave him one of the great nicknames: Whispering Death. But he makes observations neither whispered nor otherwise in his residence at Stoute’s.\n\n“I don’t have a role at all,” he said. “I am just a big fan. I don’t advise or anything like that, I might leg up a few of the lads or lasses or maybe hold the reins when they are washing the horses, but that’s about it. And one thing about Michael: when he is watching his horses, you do not interrupt him.”\n\n“I used to be quite an emotional gambler. When I first came to be associated with Michael’s stables I wanted all of his horses to win, so I’d have a bet on almost anything. I’m a bit more sensible now.”\n\nWorking for Sky this week has given Holding a chance to enjoy his passion for racing, and he even achieved the hardest feat in the sport when he got a laugh out of Ryan Moore in an on-air interview.\n\nThe week has also been a welcome relief from the performances of Holding’s old cricket team, which have been a long way short of Group One class. “I thought West Indies would do better in this World Cup,” he said. “I didn’t think they could lose to a team like Bangladesh.”\n\nFor Holding this week, though, a mere distraction from the main event of being sport’s coolest, best-loved superfan."
