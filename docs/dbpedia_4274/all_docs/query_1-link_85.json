For three-year-olds; entire colts 9st 2lb, fillies 8st 13lb. 94 entries. Value to winner £909,628.40\n\n1st DESERT CROWN Richard Kingscote 5-2 Fav\n\n2nd HOO YA MAL David Probert 150-1 2½ lengths\n\n3rd WESTOVER Rob Hornby 25-1 Head\n\nAlso ran: 4th Maskela (Andrea Atzeni) 66-1; Changingoftheguard (Wayne Lordan) 9-1; Stone Age (Ryan Moore) 7-2; Nahanni (Adam Kirby) 25-1; Nations Pride (William Buick) 15-2; West Wind Blows (Jack Mitchell) 40-1; El Habeeb (J.

Stone Age was a strong alternative at 7-2, as the pick of Aiden O’Brien’s three, having won the Leopardstown Derby Trial Stakes. While Godolphin’s Nations Pride, supplemented for £75,000 after winning the Newmarket Stakes by 7 lengths from Hoo Ya Mal drifted from 6’s to 15-2.\n\nWith Desert Crown the last to be loaded, the 17 runners got underway on good going. After 2 furlongs, West Wind Blows and Changingoftheguard took them along from Glory Daze, Star of India and Stone Age. At the top of the hill the front two maintained their lead while Desert Crown was nicely placed on the outside of the pack. There was little change rounding Tattenham Corner until passing the 3-pole where Changingoftheguard gave way to HooYa Mal, while Desert Crown cruised up on the outside, Richard Kingscote sending him clear two furlongs out. Meantime, Rob Hornby on Westover, suddenly blocked by a closing wall of horses, had to pull out and round to make his challenge. Desert Crown by now 3 to 4 lengths clear and easing down with plenty in the locker, went on to win by 2½ lengths. Hoo Ya Mal, a 150-1 shot, held on to second by a head from the fast finishing Westover.\n\n17 ran. Time 2m 36.38 sec\n\nThe winner was bred by Strawberry Fields Stud, owned by Saeed Suhail and trained by Sir Michael Stoute, his sixth Derby winner from Newmarket, Suffolk.\n\nThe winner, DESERT CROWN, had won 3 races from 3 starts: EBF Maiden Stakes, Nottingham, Dubai Dante Stakes, York, Cazoo Derby, Epsom.\n\nThe sire, NATHANIEL b.c. 2008 by GALILEO ex MAGNIFICENT STYLE, won 4 races (from 11 starts): St Helens Maiden Stakes, Haydock, King Edward VII Stakes, Ascot, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, beating WORKFORCE, (2011), Coral-Eclipse Stakes, Sandown.

She has bred 5 winners from 5 runners incl. FLYING THUNDER b.g. 2015 by ARCHIPENKO, won Premier Cup, Sha Tin.\n\nDesert Crown and Richard Kingscote return in Triumph\n\nFor more Racing History see Michael’s Books for Sale.\n\nAt around 8.40, on Tuesday, 8 February, 1983, a time before electronic security gates and CCTV cameras, an armed gang of six or more men broke into the Aga Khan’s Ballymany Stud, near Newbridge, County Kildare. Three of them, masked and armed, forced their way into the house, bludgeoning down Bernard Fitzgerald at the front door and holding the family at gunpoint in the kitchen.\n\n“We have come for Shergar. We want £2 million for him.”\n\nShergar’s groom, Jim Fitzgerald, father of Bernard, was then ordered to help load the stallion into their horsebox, while two further gunmen were detailed to guard the groom’s family. Shergar was then towed away and never seen again.\n\nMeantime, Jim Fitzgerald was put into a car, driven around for three hours and on receiving the password for negotiations, was pushed out on to a quiet road a few miles from home. Strangely, it was eight hours before the Garda were informed of Shergar’s kidnapping, Fitzgerald later telling Chief Superintendent James Murray of the Newbridge Police that the gangsters always referred to each other as Cresswell!\n\nThat evening, the story was broadcast by Alistair Burnet on ITV’s News at Ten, explaining the repercussions within the Thoroughbred Industry. Shergar, whose value was assessed at £10 million, had previously been syndicated into 40 shares; 34 sold to investors at £250,000 each, with the remaining six shares held by the Aga Khan. In return, shareholders would hope to receive a foal each year.\n\nThe £2 million ransom demand, was on realisation of the multiple ownership, subsequently reduced to £40,000. However, the kidnappers received no payment and Shergar was never found. On 16 June, it was reported that the insurers, Lloyds of London, having received no further contact from the kidnappers, had agreed to pay £7 million to the owners’ syndicate, on the presumption that Shergar was dead.\n\nFor the record, Shergar, was a rich bay colt of 15 hands 3, with a white blaze and four white socks. Bred by his owner the Aga Khan, he was by Great Nephew (the sire of the 1975 Derby winner, Grundy), out of Sharmeen by Val de Loir.\n\nSent to trainer Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Shergar ran twice as a juvenile, winning the Kris Plate at Newbury on his debut and following up with a 2½ length second to Beldale Flutter in Doncaster’s Group 1 Futurity Stakes, after which 33-1 could be obtained about his chance in the Derby.\n\nReappearing in the spring, Shergar impressively won the Sandown Classic Trial by 10 lengths and the Chester Vase by 12 lengths. Meanwhile, a week before the Derby, his main rival, Beldale Flutter, was involved in a freak training accident on Newmarket Heath, falling heavily on a road, sustaining serious injuries to his knee and ribs, so causing his withdrawal from the Derby and sending Shergar’s odds tumbling to 10-11.\n\nWith the opposition now considerably weaker, Lester Piggott’s mount Shotgun (second to Beldale Flutter in the Mecca-Dante Stakes), became second favourite at 7-1. Others for small money were Kalaglow, winner of the Heath Stakes, and Glint of Gold, successful in the Warren Stakes at Epsom and the Derby Italiano.\n\nOn a hot, sunny Derby Day, with the police in shirt sleeves, 18 runners went to post on good-to-soft ground.\n\nAt the top of the hill Riberetto led from Silver Season with Shergar two lengths away third.\n\nEntering the straight, Shergar joined the leaders and cruised into an unassailable lead.\n\nAt the two-furlong marker he was four lengths clear, a furlong later, the distance had doubled, until eventually eased down in the hands of 19-year-old Walter Swinburn, he won by 10 lengths – the greatest winning distance in the history of the race.\n\nThe placings were all but irrelevant, but for the record Glint of Gold finished second, two lengths ahead of Scintillating Air.\n\nStrangely, the time, 2 min 44.21 sec., was the slowest since Airborne in 1946, which, may have been due to the ground, the quality of Shergar’ s opponents, the ease of his victory, or all three.\n\nShergar went on to win the Irish Derby by four lengths from Cut Above, and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes by four lengths from Madam Gay. In the St Leger, however, he made no impression in the final quarter-mile and finished a disappointing fourth behind Cut Above and Glint of Gold.\n\nShergar did not run in the Prix de l’ Arc de Triomphe as planned and retired to stud forthwith. His first and only crop included Authaal, winner of the Irish St Leger, and Maysoon, placed in both the One Thousand Guineas and Oaks.\n\nFurther evidence in the Shergar kidnapping mystery came to light in a piece published by Racing Post on 20 May, 1998. It stated:\n\n“Sean O‘Callaghan, a senior member of the Provisional IRA who later turned informer, backs up the findings of the security report commissioned by Shergar‘s owner the Aga Khan. O ‘Callaghan reveals the kidnap plot was hatched in prison by a former bookie‘s clerk and republican veteran, who was head of a special operations team set up to raise money for Sinn Fein and buy weapons for the IRA. ”\n\nIn published extracts from O’Callaghan’s book “The Informer”, he stated:\n\n“Shergar was loaded into a horsebox and driven off towards north County Leitrim …The horse threw itself into a frenzy in the horsebox, damaging a leg and proving impossible for the team to control. He was killed within days, even though the IRA kept up the pretence he was alive. ”\n\nSadly, the kidnapping of Shergar is what most people are now left with, therefore I would like to redress the balance with the memory of his record 10 length victory at Epsom. Long may it last.\n\nFor more Racing History see Michael’s Books for Sale.\n\nTo see Michael’s interviews go to the foot of About Michael\n\nWho won the Derby ? – Spreading the News\n\nThe most dramatic change in the history of the Derby has been in the speed and the method by which the result has been transmitted.\n\nFrom when Sir Charles Bunbury’s Diomed won the first Derby in 1780, it took a few years and some notable winners for the racing fraternity to acknowledge and promote the Derby.\n\nCertainly, the 12th Earl of Derby’s success with Sir Peter Teazle in 1787 helped and later, when Champion won both the Derby and St Leger in 1800, the race begun to be accepted as an elite prize.\n\nThe final acknowledgement, however, came in 1827, when the Derby, Oaks and St Leger were grouped together in the Racing Calendar as “The Three Great Races”.\n\nIt follows that, for the first 40 years, the majority of people who wanted to know the result of the Derby had to be at Epsom. In the meantime, the staff of the training stables left behind would have to wait for the returning parties to be told who had won. As the prestige of the race grew, so did the outside interest in the betting. Stagecoaches would bring details of the race to the Coaching Inns, although carrier pigeons were sometimes quicker and kept the result ‘confidential’ in places where betting would sometimes continue for a week after the race.\n\nIn 1830, the year the great Priam won the Derby, the railways took communications a giant step forward. Louis Henry Curzon describes an incident in his book “The Blue Ribbon of the Turf”, that not only gives the feel of the times, but, exposes the lengths that gamblers would go to in order to gain an advantage.\n\n“Priam! It’s Priam that’s won I tell you. I heard the guard say so.”\n\nIt must have been on the Saturday forenoon after the Derby of 1830 (the race run the previous Thursday) that I heard these words spoken by a stableman at one of the Hotels in the town of Haddington. I did not at the time know to what they related, being then a boy of some six years or so at school there. I soon became enlightened by a bigger boy, who told me Priam was a horse, and that it was the Derby it had won.\n\nNext year some of us boys took such an interest in the race that half a dozen went two miles out of town to learn the news of Spaniel’s victory. A man on horseback was before us, but we heard him get the tip, and, setting spur to his horse he galloped off to Edinburgh with the news by a cross road at full gallop. And next Derby the same man I noticed was again in waiting…”\n\nCurzon later explains the mystery. “After leaving Haddington, by which town the mail came to Edinburgh, I discovered why a man on horseback had come there – a distance of 17 miles – to obtain from the guard the news of ‘what had won’. On some occasions there were as many as five messengers employed to bring on the news of what horse had won the Derby…. and the speed of their horses, were able on some occasions to beat the stage-coaches by as much as 25 minutes, which enabled those who had arranged the express to do a good deal of business…”.\n\nIn conclusion, the ‘sting’ took place in the Black Bull in Edinburgh, where up to 100 people would be waiting, “most of whom had backed something for the race and betting would go on till the mail reached the post-office. Meantime, two or three in ‘the know’ had ample opportunity for laying the horse that had lost the race and backing the one that had won it.”\n\nFifty years on, technology had produced the ‘ticker-tape’ and when the American owned and bred Iroquois, won the Derby in 1881, the transatlantic telegraph sent the coded message ‘IROPERTOW’ to the New York Stock Exchange, informing them the result: first IROquois, second PERegrine and third TOWn Moor. After which, bedlam broke out, quickly followed by chaos, when all Wall Street came to a halt and for a few minutes the New York Stock Exchange ceased trading entirely.\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century, ‘communications’, or later, ‘the media’, focused their attention on the Derby with the following innovations:\n\nIn 1895, the Derby, with a record attendance of 750,000, was filmed by the English pioneering cinematographer Birt Acres; this the earliest piece of moving film in existence, shows just 50 seconds of Sir Visto’s Derby victory with the crowds rushing across the course after the finish.\n\nWhen at Racing Post I had the privilege of verifying details of the footage, then part of a collection owned by Ray Henville, a retired civil servant, before it featured on the TV show Schofield’s Quest.\n\nIn the early 1900’s, it was just possible, to hear a commentary on the Derby by a “cat’s whisker” radio. However, from 1931, BBC radio commentaries became an annual event. Also in 1931, the BBC made a crude attempt to televise the race, when a camera stationed at the winning post recorded the horses as they finished. This however, was the first TV recording of any sporting event in the world!\n\nIn 1913 the Gaumont Company set up cameras at Tattenham Corner, historically capturing the suffragette tragedy. Then from 1919, Pathe News recorded the race, and with very few exceptions these can still be seen on You Tube.\n\nFollowing on, many TV Companies have televised the Derby including the BBC, Channel 4, ITV and more recently Racing TV, from which people can watch the race on their phones and place their bets in running.\n\nFrom pigeons and stage coaches, sending the Derby result has come a very long way.\n\nFootnote: Priam was the greatest horse of his era, winning14 of his 16 races. At stud he sired three Oaks winners in four years, including Crucifix, who also won both the One Thousand Guineas and the Two Thousand Guineas. Sent to America, Priam was their Champion Sire four times in five years from 1842-1846.\n\nFor more Racing History see Michael’s Books for Sale. To see Michael’s interviews go to the foot of About Michael\n\nWilliam Powell Frith was born in Aldfield, North Yorkshire in 1819, and although keen to be an auctioneer, was encouraged by his parents to take up art.\n\nAs a lad of 16, armed with a portfolio of drawings, he was accompanied by his father, an innkeeper in Harrogate, on a 24 hour stage-coach journey to London. There he studied at Sass’s Art School, going on to win a place at the Royal Academy Schools in 1837, and becoming a full Academician in 1852. Success quickly followed when Queen Victoria bought the first of his large scale narratives, Ramsgate Sands.\n\nOn his first visit to a racecourse – Hampton – in 1854, he was struck by the contrast of human life there. In particular, a gypsy family enjoying a large Fortnum and Mason’s pie and to his horror an unsuccessful punter attempting to cut his own throat.\n\nFrith’s first attended Derby Day in 1856, and whilst he admitted to having no interest in the race, he spent the afternoon studying the people – the card sharps and ‘thimble riggers’, the acrobats, minstrels, gypsy fortune-tellers, young bucks and carriages filled with beautiful women. Later, with the assistance of Robert Howlett’s photographs of Derby Day crowds lining the straight, he began work on the painting\n\nOn seeing the sketch for Derby Day, Mr Jacob Bell paid Frith £1,500 to paint him the picture and a Mr Gambart paid him a further £1,500 for the copyright of the engraving.\n\nThe work was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858, after which Frith wrote:\n\n“When the Queen came into the large room, she went at once to mine; and after a little while sent for me and complimented me in the highest and kindest manner. She said it ‘was a wonderful work’, and much more that modesty prevents me repeating.”\n\nFrith’s painting proved an enormous attraction at the Exhibition as snippets from his diary tell:\n\nMay 2 – Private view. All the people crowd about the “Derby Day”.\n\nMay 3 – Opening day of the Exhibition. Never was such a crowd seen round a picture.\n\nThe secretary obliged to get a policeman to keep people off. He is to be there from eight in the morning. Bell applies to the Council for a rail which will not be granted.\n\nMay 7 – To the Exhibition. Knight tells me a rail is to be put round my picture. Hooray!\n\nMay 8 – Couldn’t help going to see the rail, and there it was sure enough; and loads of people.\n\nAfter the Exhibition, the owner of the copyright, Ernest Gambart, organised a huge publicity campaign, sending the painting on tour, first to the provinces then to Europe, finally culminating in a tour of the United States and Australia. At that time, very few paintings had achieved comparable fame and it was generally recognised that Frith had faithfully captured the manners, dress and behaviour across the classes at a world famous event. Walter Sickert, the post-impressionist painter, said in 1922, the painting was, “the most popular…. the most unaffectedly enjoyed picture in the collection,” of the National Gallery.\n\nTo appreciate the painting in detail I have divided it in to four sections below, together with a close-up picture of the horses being saddled in front of the new grandstand.\n\nThe tents on the left housed various gambling set ups including E O, a form of roulette where the individual numbers were replaced by an E for even numbers or an O for odd numbers, each paying even money with one zero for the house. This prevented the owners from paying out large sums on individual numbers.\n\nIn the centre a thimble rigger plies his trade, while to the right of the pennyless boy, card sharps tempt you into another “easy money” card game. Above the white dog an accomplice shows the money he has supposedly won. Meanwhile at the foot of the next picture, gypsy children cradle a baby.\n\nWilliam Dorling, a local printer, produced from 1825, a racecard known as “Dorling’s Genuine Card List” – a seller of which can be seen holding the card aloft to the left in the picture. The racecard, revolutionary at the time, not only gave the list of runners, but also their owners, pedigrees, jockeys, colours and, for the major races, the ‘state of the odds’. The point of sale for these racecards was The Spread Eagle in Epsom’s main street. There in the courtyard of the last coaching stop before ascending the hill to the course, assembled owners, grooms, jockeys, together with some of the darkest element of the betting fraternity\n\nIn 1845, with the Epsom Grandstand running at a loss, William’s son Henry, a prominent share holder in the new grandstand, came up with the proposal, with support from Lord George Bentinck and negotiations with the Grand Stand Association Committee, to put the racecourse back on a sure footing. This that all races be saddled in front of the Grandstand (see below); proposing an additional £300 to the prize fund and making improvements to the lawn and accommodation in the Grandstand. Previously, saddling had taken place in ‘The Warren’, where the horses surrounded by well-wishers often prevented the jockeys finding their mounts, so causing considerable delays.\n\nThe move became an instant success, insuring a packed Grandstand of 5,000, in order to see what was popularly known as ‘The Preliminary Canter’.\n\nThe more wealthy racegoers now enjoyed the benefit of seeing the horses saddled, then cantered down the straight and back to the start.\n\nBehind the fashionable ladies and the hungry boy, the horses are about to turn back to the grandstand in what was known as “The Preliminary Canter.”\n\nIt was generally accepted that although very few of the crowd saw much of the racing, the attraction was just being there!\n\nBarefoot gypsies try to sell a posy to rakish toff and his embarrassed companion, while a character under the coach reaches out for the dregs of a bottle. In the background an acrobat balances on a tall pole for pennies.\n\nDespite his wonderfully observed painting, Frith was not really interested in horseracing and across the scene there are no sign of the bookmakers. However, years later, an etching study of rails bookmakers at Ascot, entitled The Road to Ruin appeared in 1879.\n\nAlthough Frith appeared to be a pillar of Victorian society, like most artists he was far from an open book.\n\nLiving with his wife Isabelle in the London district of Bayswater, they had 12 children. Nevertheless, unbeknown to Isabelle, William started another family with Mary Alford only a mile away, where he sired a further seven children. For many years, Isabelle had no suspicion of her husband’s infidelity, until one day, when he was supposed to be on holiday in Brighton, she caught him posting a letter close by their home. What agreement they came to was never published, but soon after Isabelle died in 1880, William married Mary.\n\nWilliam Powell Frith died on the 2nd of November 1909 at his residence in St Johns Wood, and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, in North Kensington, London.\n\nFor more Racing History see Michael’s Books for Sale."
