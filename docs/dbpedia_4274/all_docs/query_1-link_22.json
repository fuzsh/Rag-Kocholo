        "text": "PARIS — A battle of the sexes. Age taking on experience. A champion defending his title. An outsider looking to hit it big. A battle for national pride.\n\nIt’s all coming soon — not to a theater but to a racecourse, where it will play out in live action in less than three minutes.\n\nThe 90th running of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday in Paris is the season-ending championship of European thoroughbred horse racing, and it is the most prestigious trophy on the calendar. It is also the richest, with a total purse of €4 million, or $5.4 million, of which €2.3 million goes to the winner.\n\nThat means there is usually no shortage of drama, and the edition this year is serving up plenty of story lines. The favorite to win is likely to be a four-year-old filly called Sarafina, who was third in the race last year.\n\nSarafina has six victories to her credit, three of them at the highest Group 1 level, and she has never been out of the money.\n\nIn the Arc last year, she finished a closing third to Workforce and Nakayama Festa, fighting back strongly after being nearly brought down on the final bend by a horse rapidly tiring and dropping back through the field. Both Nakayama Festa and Workforce will be back this year, but Sarafina looked to be in top form when winning the preparatory Prix Foy at Longchamp on Sept. 11.\n\nSarafina has age and sex going against her. In the past 89 editions of the race, only 18 have been won by fillies, and 10 of those champions have been three years old; only seven were four and one was five. The last filly to triumph was Zarkava in 2008 — when she was three.\n\nThat means a challenge from Galikova will be a serious possibility.\n\nGalikova is the three-year-old little sister of the turf legend Goldikova, three-time winner of the Breeders’ Cup Mile and holder of 14 Group 1 titles. Galikova broke out of her sister’s shadow this year with four victories from five races, including the Group 1 Prix Vermeille at Longchamp on Sept. 11.\n\nWhile Galikova seems to share her sister’s will to win, she is definitely her own horse, with a bigger build, a more calm character and a pedigree made to last the classic distance of 2,400 meters, or a mile and a half.\n\nBut on Sunday, Galikova will be up against tougher competitors than she has faced so far. She and Sarafina will have to run their best to get close to So You Think, a star in Australian racing who has set Europe on fire this year.\n\nSo You Think is a five-year-old son of High Chaparral who has 12 victories from 17 starts and seems to fly home effortlessly. A two-time winner of the Group 1 Cox Plate in Australia, So You Think came to Ireland for the 2011 season, where he most recently won the Irish Champion Stakes on Sept. 3. He was pressed to the line in that victory by a four-year-old filly called Snow Fairy, who also will line up for the Arc.\n\nSnow Fairy won the Group 1 Hong Kong Cup last December, but has been unlucky in three races this year.\n\nSo You Think, bred in New Zealand, will be running over a trip of 2,400 meters for the first time. He did run longer, when he finished third last year in the Melbourne Cup, a marathon of 3,200 meters. But the bulk of his racing — and his victories — has been at distances of 2,000 meters and less. Nonetheless, he is a big, well-built horse who seems to adapt to any conditions he meets, and he will be tough to beat on Sunday.\n\nTrying hard to do that is the aptly named Workforce, the winner last year.\n\nThe four-year-old son of King’s Best, he runs his races true to his name: head down and doggedly working hard. He finished just behind the flashy So You Think at Sandown on July 2 in the Group 1 Coral Eclipse Stakes, and finished second again, this time to Nathaniel, in the King George at Ascot on July 23. He has not run since then, but his trainer, Michael Stoute, has said he is confident the horse is ready for the Arc.\n\nOnly six horses have managed to win the Arc twice, the last being Alleged in 1977 and 1978. Working against him is the weather, which has been unseasonably hot and dry this week, and there is no rain forecast before Sunday. Workforce does his best work on soft ground, and he will not get that for the Arc this year.\n\nThe trainer of the three-year-old Nathaniel, John Gosden, considered running the colt in the Arc, but decided against it because of the firm ground. He will likely target a race at “Champion’s Day” at Ascot in mid-October.\n\nIt is not only Europeans who dream of lifting one of racing’s biggest prizes: Japanese owners have had their eye on the Arc for the past decade or so and have sent two of their best horses over this year: Nakayama Festa and Hiruno d’Amour. The former nearly won last year, battling Workforce to the line only to fall short by a head. But he finished fourth and last to Sarafina in his preparatory race at Longchamp on Sept. 11, putting his Arc ambitions this year in doubt.\n\nHiruno d’Amour finished just a nose behind Sarafina in the same race. Hiruno is a four-year-old son of Manhattan Café, a multiple Group 1 winner in Japan but unplaced in the Arc when he tried in 2002. Hiruno notched Group 1 victories in Japan in April and May before shipping to Europe to acclimatize and train for the Arc.\n\nBoth of the Japanese horses will be considered outsiders on Sunday.\n\nThe final field may also include another outsider, Meandre, who was the surprising winner of the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris in July. Before that race, his best performance was a Listed race victory, but he beat both the French Derby winner Reliable Man and the Curragh Classic winner Treasure Beach in the Grand Prix, sparking immediate talk of the Arc.\n\nReliable Man got his revenge on Sept. 11 in the Prix Niel, where he finished two lengths clear of his rival. Reliable Man’s reliable performance should give him the edge over Meandre on Sunday. Whether he is good enough to beat So You Think and Sarafina remains to be seen. Stay tuned.\n\nGina Rarick trains racehorses near Paris."
