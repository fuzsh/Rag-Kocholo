        "text": "ANNAPOLIS, MD – The Board of Public Works today approved an agreement to transfer ownership of Pimlico Race Course from The Stronach Group to the State of Maryland. The historic agreement guarantees the home of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, establishes Pimlico as the year-round home of thoroughbred racing in Maryland, and creates a year-round hub of economic activity in Baltimore’s Park Heights community.\n\n“When it comes to projects with generational impact, our administration has made it clear that we aren’t just focused on closing a deal – we’re focused on driving economic development in all of our communities,” said Gov. Moore. “Just days before the 149th running of the Preakness Stakes, we have reached an agreement that will keep horse racing at Pimlico for generations and will deliver economic prosperity for the City of Baltimore. Thank you to the General Assembly, the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority, The Stronach Group, 1/ST and the Maryland Jockey Club for their partnership in getting this agreement to the finish line.”"
