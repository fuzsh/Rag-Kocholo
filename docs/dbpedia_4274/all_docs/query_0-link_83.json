        "text": "HE’S not much of a party animal, Ryan Moore – which is a pity, because he’s been on board a couple of animals well worth raising a glass to this week.\n\nThe Derby-winning jockey had never won a Classic until Friday afternoon, when he piloted Snow Fairy to glory in The Oaks.\n\nAfter being congratulated on that victory, Moore grumbled: “Well, it’s not the Derby is it?”\n\nYesterday, before the largest British sporting crowd of the year at Epsom Downs, it certainly was the Derby – and this time even the infamously downbeat ­champion jockey was a little merrier.\n\nWorkforce, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, thundered to a track record, seven lengths clear of pacesetter and 100-1 shot At First Sight.\n\nMoore, 26, had been ­threatening to become a half-sized Colin Montgomerie – always top of the order of merit but never winning a truly big one.\n\nAt least he didn’t have to wait as long as his National Hunt ­counterpart Tony McCoy, who finally won the Grand National two months ago, at the 15th time of asking.\n\nMoore was roared home by many in the 120,000 crowd – from Her Majesty and the top-hatted toffs in the Queen’s Stand, to the beer-swilling punters around Epsom’s travelling fairground.\n\nBut he only had eyes for his baby son Toby, held by Ryan’s father Gary – a former jump ­jockey and a trainer in both codes – who greeted them by the ­finishing line within a minute of his finest moment.\n\nTossed\n\nYet when the party streamers went off at the presentation ­ceremony, Moore disdainfully tossed them off his shoulders as if to say, ‘what’s all the fuss about?’\n\nAccording to all who know him, he’s an active Hokey-Cokey ­dodger, this fella, deadly serious about his art and with every ­reason to be.\n\nMoore rode his first winner, over jumps, 10 years ago – and admitted that, as a kid, it was the National he dreamed about.\n\nHe said: “Me and my brother used to ask each other whether we would rather win the Derby or the National and I always said the National – but I stopped growing and then the goalposts changed.\n\n“This is a very special day. I was travelling beautifully and the horse quickened up really well.\n\n“It’s a day I will always ­remember. It’s the most ­important race and it’s been really nice to get a great reception from my family, friends and weighing-room colleagues.”\n\nDad Gary added: “I was proud of Ryan anyway, but this is what he always wanted to achieve.”\n\nMoore became the first man since Kieren Fallon six years ago to record an Oaks-Derby double and Workforce the first horse to win this race after being beaten in the Dante Stakes at York.\n\n“Ryan was always confident the Dante was a one-off,” insisted Stoute, who was knighted for ­service to ­tourism in Barbados – not, it sounds, the most difficult of knighthoods to have won.\n\nBut as a racehorse trainer, there are few who wouldn’t doff their caps to him. Workforce, a 6-1 shot owned by Prince Khalid Abdulla, is Stoute’s fifth Derby winner – the first being the great Shergar.\n\nHe was 10 lengths adrift ­coming round Tattenham Corner but raced through the gears to ­overhaul each-way marvel At First Sight.\n\nSmashed\n\nThe winning time of two ­minutes 31.33 seconds over the mile-and-a-half trip smashed the previous track record set by Lammtarra in 1995.\n\nStoute said: “Ryan has ridden him a lot and educated him a lot. I’m so pleased that Ryan has won it because he’s put in a lot of work on the horse. It’s always a team effort and we’ve paid the colt a lot of attention since his work at Lingfield which told me he was dead right for the Derby.\n\n“Ryan has a lot of natural talent as well as a very good racing brain, while he’s also very ambitious. He was confident the colt would ­handle the track.”\n\nHis success meant another year of waiting for Irish trainer Aidan O’Brien – after long-time ante-post favourite St Nicholas Abbey pulled out last Tuesday and race favourite Jan Vermeer faded to fourth.\n\nO’Brien has not sent out a Derby winner for eight years, ­although his frontrunner ­threatened to steal it until Workforce hammered his way past down the hill."
