Like many states and industries around the country, the equine industry in Kentucky is struggling to find qualified workers to fill its workforce ranks. Because of that, KEEP has teamed up with the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Workforce Center to address the shortage of qualified equine workers on a state level.

Through donations of both time and finances, these entities have helped create a culture shift in the equine industry that focuses on career education, community relations, and the growth of the industry as a whole through workforce development.
