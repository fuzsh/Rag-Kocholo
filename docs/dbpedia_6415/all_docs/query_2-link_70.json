        "text": "The other day I viewed Volker Schlöndorff’s The Ninth Day (2004), based on Jean Bernard’s death-camp diary. (Bernard was among the clerics imprisoned by the Nazis in the “priest block” in Dachau.) Although an admirer of some of Schlöndorff’s other work (most recently, The Legend of Rita, 2000, brilliantly written by Wolfgang Kohlhaase and Schlöndorff), I objected to this particular film on many grounds, not the least of which is its nauseatingly graphic portrayal of Nazi barbarism against Catholics. This material struck me as gratuitous; I did not need to have my nose rubbed into it. Depressed by the experience of seeing Schlöndorff’s film, I began to wonder whether I had seen too many Holocaust films. Was there anything left for me to be shown on the matter? Reality sometimes accommodates our needs, providing an antidote to the poison we’ve ingested. Fateless—Sorstalanság (literally, Fatelessness)—struck me in this light. From Hungary, Lajos Koltai’s first effort as a filmmaker—Koltai has been a superlative cinematographer for many years (Pál Gábor’s Angi Vera, 1978, Péter Gothár’s Time Stands Still, 1982, Giuseppe Tornatore’s Malèna, 2000,and numerous films by István Szabó, including Confidence, 1980, Mephisto, 1981, and Being Julia, 2004)—is based on the novel by Nobel Laureate Imre Kertész, who also wrote the script.* Koltai claims he had never wanted to direct until he read Kertész’s semi-autobiographical novel. After finishing the book, he says, he saw in his mind the film he now wanted to make. I believe him.\n\nFateless neither generalizes nor sentimentalizes the death-camp experience; rather, it particularizes it. It is 1944 Budapest, and the Nazis have taken over the Hungarian government. (Hungary, incidentally, had sided with Nazi Germany in the war.) The father of the protagonist , 14-year-old Gyuri Köve (soulful Marcell Nagy), is being sent to a “labor camp” the next day. For the moment, this is enough for the boy to cope with, but it launches the whole journey of events beyond comprehension that befall him, turning his ordinary adolescent life upside down. Gyuri is taken out of school and, en route to work one day, he is removed from the bus along with other boys and deported to Auschwitz, the first stop for him in a series of German camps, including Buchenwald, marking what is meant to be his fatal destination. Gyuri, sufficiently secularized so as not even identifying himself as Jewish, has already resisted the idea of his participation in a “Jewish fate.” He will be “fateless.” At Auschwitz, his lie that he is sixteen, the first instance of his fateless existence, spares him from immediate extermination. What on one level is a kind of denial is, on another level, a transcendence of his vulnerable predicament. Gyuri’s imaginative capacity to rise above his circumstance, not the Nazis or their brutality, will define his existence and enable him to endure and survive. Surrounded by the deaths of so many others, the boy comes to embrace this article of understanding: “I could be killed—anytime, anywhere.” This acceptance frees him to live in unliveable circumstances, becoming his mental, spiritual, existential “edge.”\n\nFor Gyuri, we may say, the death camp experience becomes his life, providing him with the substitution for family with which he must make do. It isn’t the disruption of his life; it is his life, and the experience provides him with support, kindness and compassion as well as terror and cruelty. When he returns home from Buchenwald, it is to a new world—literally, because home is not as he has remembered it; it has unalterably changed. Moreover, he brings to his homecoming not just his memory of the experience he shared with other prisoners of the Nazis but also the continuity of his interior life, which had made part of his experience in the camps entirely his own. This aspect of his reality chastises us for our assumption that “the death camp experience” was a uniform, monolithic thing—an experience that all the surviving prisoners of the camps shared. It chides us into realizing that this assumption, without our meaning for this to occur, has led us to sort-of dehumanize the detainees in our mind. Gyuri’s own response to what has so recently occurred stands for the variety of humanity that survived in the camps despite attempts to crush it, reminding us afresh of how terribly painful liberation proved to be for many—that it, too, was yet another uprooting.\n\nGyuri’s liberation by Allied Forces signifies his survival of his “last stop.” Gyuri returns home emaciated, in more than appearance, a ghost back from the dead. In Budapest, people want him to forget the ordeal he has undergone. There is no forgetting, however. (Gyuri explains that he “can’t give orders to his memory.”) Gyuri will survive painful memories of his ordeal, just as he survived the ordeal itself, by accepting these as part of the journey of his existence—not a disruption; not a derailment; not a debasement. Of course, he has been assisted by his youth; unlike many of his elders, he had little sense of self-determination to lose, to have taken away from him. On the other hand, he has had to grow up quickly, which has meant finding a way, privately, secretly, to assert self-determination in small ways within the confines of his incarceration and potentially ultimate vulnerability. His intuited method for surviving thus far will continue to assist his survival throughout the balance of his life.\n\nThis is remarkable stuff, made all the more so by the fact that Gyuri’s death-camp experiences, drawing upon Kertész’s own, generate happy memories as well as unhappy ones. Indeed, it is almost as though his return to Budapest, which Gyuri now finds a strange, unsympathetic environment, were the real disruption of his life. He even misses—this is his word—the “happiness” of the camps. In these camps we have witnessed unspeakable cruelty and horror, and have inferred a good deal more; but we have also seen the boy’s being protected by other inmates, sharing with them simple pleasures, and even being nursed back to health from the brink of death in the infirmary of one of the camps. Just as one must take the bad along with the good, one must also take the good along with the bad. It is self-defeating to be at war with one’s own existence. Gyuri knows that no one will ever ask him about the “happy” aspect of his death-camp experience, and therefore it will remain private, secret, without outlet. It will never stop being part of his reality.\n\nKertész has provided the film with one of the wisest scripts one can even dream of encountering, and Koltai has filmed it in an impressionistic style. We observe Gyuri observing the sights and sounds around him, and we observe what he is observing. For the most part, Koltai keeps the camera at a sufficient distance to bring an objective spirit to Gyuri’s intimate—hence, subjective—experience. The highly particular nature of Gyuri’s observations, authenticated by Kertész’s firsthand experience, brings to mind Roman Polanski’s marvelous The Pianist (2002), based on Holocaust survivor Wladyslaw Szpilman’s memoir. Indeed, there seems to be a spiritual connection between these two films—the first, detailing how one person survives while eluding capture, and the other, detailing how another person survives in captivity. There is a subtle dreamlike quality to both films suggestive of the unreality of the reality in which either protagonist finds himself immersed. While lesser films balance objective and subjective, and documentary and fictional, elements, Fateless very nearly seamlessly blends these. Only occasionally these elements separate out. Fateless certainly indulges in none of the gaudiness, cartoonishness, bug-eyed melodrama or crass sentimentality that so disfigure Schindler’s List (Steven Spielberg,1993) and trivialize the Holocaust.\n\nAssisted by his color cinematographer, Gyula Pados, Koltai has made a film of austere beauty that is correlative to the beauty of the world, whatever its political and historical disgraces, and to the sanctity of Jewish experience, including—especially—the Holocaust. Gradually these two artists—Koltai and Koltai’s Koltai—drain the color from their images, achieving an increasingly monochromatic visual aspect that suggests to me, at least, the gradual seeping of the death-camp experience into Gyuri’s blood and bones. The seeming repression of color represents, then, an increasingly profound absorption of experience. Some critics have reasonably related this to the dehumanizing nature of the death-camp experience, but I read all this a little differently. For me, Gyuri’s embrace of his existence, however dehumanizing the Germans labor to make it, certifies, deepens and sustains his humanity. The color that we increasingly cannot see, I am suggesting, is correlative to the beauty of Gyuri’s spirit, which we also cannot see.\n\nA recurrent motif in the film is mud—in effect, the earth that might swallow up Gyuri at any moment. It is a visual translation and projection of his realization that he “could be killed—anytime, anywhere.”\n\nFinally, I must pay homage to Koltai’s homage to the tram ride in F. W. Murnau’s Sunrise (1927). Near the end of the film, Gyuri’s trip through the Budapest to which he has returned reveals a Budapest totally unlike the Budapest he left behind near the beginning of the film. Like Gyuri, like his youth, the city of his year-ago life is terribly damaged by the war. This is another aspect of Gyuri that we do not see, for he will not parade it, nor will he submit to it, be vanquished by it. It may rattle around in his mind for the rest of creation, but it won’t determine his destiny, if he can help it. Gyuri, instead, has staked out his integrity. He will strive to stay fateless.\n\n* Kertész won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002 “[f]or writing that upholds the tragic experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.”\n\nB(U)Y THE BOOK\n\nMY BOOK, A Short Chronology of World Cinema, IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FROM THE SANDS FILMS CINEMA CLUB IN LONDON.
