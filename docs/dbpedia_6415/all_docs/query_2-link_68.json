        "text": "More Politics, More Fiction\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nYour appealingly conceived Sept. 13 feature on political novels might disappoint some readers for ultimately confining itself to so few of the great political novels of the last 100 years.\n\nHere are some titles that might help redress your focus on a mere handful of books: Robert Coover’s “The Public Burning” and Philip Roth’s “The Plot Against America” and, moving abroad, Arthur Koestler’s “Darkness at Noon,” Alberto Moravia’s “The Conformist,” Thomas Mann’s “Dr. Faustus,” Boris Pasternak’s “Doctor Zhivago,” Mario Vargas Llosa’s “Conversation in the Cathedral,” V. S. Naipaul’s “A Bend in the River,” Yukio Mishima’s “Runaway Horses,” George Orwell’s “1984” and Nicholas Mosley’s “Hopeful Monsters.”\n\nAlexander Hicks\n\nAtlanta\n\n♦\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThere is a back story to Klaus Mann’s novel “Mephisto,” which is not noted in Margaret Atwood’s delightful short essay about reading the novel while living in Germany in 1984 (“Politics in Fiction,” Sept. 13). The novel is a roman à clef based on the legendary German actor and director Gustaf Gründgens, who had worked with Mann in the theater and briefly married his sister Erika, before making a Faust-like pact with the Nazis and becoming a protégé of Hermann Göring and director of the Prussian State Theater.\n\nMann committed suicide in 1949. A rehabilitated Gründgens resumed his career in postwar Germany. I recall seeing him as a teenager perform Friedrich Schiller’s “Don Carlos” in the early 1960s in Hamburg’s Deutsches Schauspielhaus, where he served as director. And of course Mann’s novel inspired Istvan Szabo’s brilliant film adaptation in 1981 of “Mephisto.”\n\nSynnöve Trier\n\nBrooklyn\n\nThe Silent Half\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI enjoyed reading Jon Meacham’s overview of histories of white supremacy in your Sept. 6 issue, and the facing review of Seyward Darby’s “Sisters in Hate.” I’m sure most other educated, liberal readers of The Times did as well. These are well-researched, necessary histories of a crucial thread within American politics. But they probably don’t explain everything.\n\nFifty percent of Americans identify as “politically disengaged.” Some of them no doubt consciously align with the white supremacist tradition in American history; others do so unthinkingly, by default. Still others probably resist it in diffuse and internally contradictory ways. Until critics (historians, sociologists, journalists) successfully grapple with the race politics of this very large, very banal middle of the bell curve, we are unlikely to have a fully informed discussion of the topic.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
