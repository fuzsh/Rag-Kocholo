        "text": "NEW DELHI: Critically acclaimed Hungarian film director Istvan Szabo, American filmmaker and actor Martin Scorsese will be conferred with the first Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement Award at 52nd edition of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) to be held in Goa next month.\n\nWhile Szabo is known for his masterpieces like Mephisto (1981) and Father (1966), Scorsese is one of the major figures of the New Hollywood era, widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential directors in film history.\n\nFor the first time ever, IFFI has invited major over-the-top (OTT) players to participate in the festival. The minister has informed that OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, Voot and Sony Liv are participating this year.\n\nIt will also organize the India premiere of ‘The Power of the Dog’ by Jane Campion, which is based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage. It has also proposed to organize a special screening of film ‘Dhamaka’, including an introduction of the film by key talent of the film Kartik Aaryan and a preview of Episode 1 of ‘Aranyak’, an upcoming crime thriller series starring Raveena Tandon and Ashutosh Rana.\n\nSpeaking about the development, Thakur said that the trend of watching movies on OTT is on the rise and IFFI is embracing new technology and providing a platform for the industry artists to interact with OTT players.\n\n“India is a land of story tellers; our tales have captured the imagination of the world. India’s wide variety of stories rightly makes us the ‘Content Subcontinent’,” he added.\n\nThe minister further announced that for the first time ever, films from five BRICS nations will be showcased through the BRICS Film Festival alongside IFFI.\n\nThakur said that ‘The King of all the World’ (El Rey de Todo El Mundo) directed by Carlos Saura will be the Opening Film and this will also be the film’s international premier.\n\nOne of the attractions of the festival this year will be recognition to 75 ‘creative minds of tomorrow’, which is to mark 75 years celebration of India’s independence –Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.\n\nThakur said that IFFI would provide a platform to young budding talent from across India to connect with mainstream cinema filmmakers and the industry. 75 creative minds (under 35 years) will be invited to interact with industry leaders and attend master classes at the festival.\n\nThese youngsters will be selected through a competition for young filmmakers from around the country. The competition aims to provide a platform to 75 young filmmakers, actors, singers, scriptwriters, and others to showcase their talent at a globally recognized event."
