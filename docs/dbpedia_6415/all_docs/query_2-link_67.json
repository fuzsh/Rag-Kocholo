        "text": "WILLIAM FOX, the Founder of Fox Film Corporation\n\nWilliam Fox, who was born as Fried Vilmos in 1879 in a small Hungarian village called Tolcsva, worked as a producer and founded Fox Film Corporation.\n\nWhen he was just nine months old he and his family emigrated to the United States because they could not make a living in Hungary. There they changed their names to Fox, their mother’s maiden name. As he was so young when they moved, Fox never learned to speak Hungarian.\n\nHe grew up on the worst streets of New York and had to start working at the age of 8 as a servant in a lavatory. In the States he had eleven siblings but only six of them survived because of their poor conditions. He even stopped going to school at the age of 11.\n\nHe later started working as a salesman in the fur garment industry, but after saving up a few thousand dollars he got out and invested in the film industry by buying a nickelodeon in Brooklyn. By the end of the year he owned a whole chain of them as well as a production company which was the start of his empire. He laid down the foundation for the Hollywood studio system by organizing Fox Film Corporation and the Fox West Coast Theatres chain, creating the star culture, and for freeing the industry from Thomas Edison’s monopoly.\n\nDuring his work in Hollywood he hired many Hungarian actors, writers and creatives with whom he worked closely. Although he never returned to Hungary, he sent a news filmmaker to his hometown to shoot some footage, which he later showed to his family in the States. In 1999 a memorial tablet was made in his honour that hangs on the wall of Fox Film Studio’s screening room, and is made of the famous Hungarian Herendi porcelain.\n\nHis former home has just been recently discovered in Tolcsva, and is waiting to be rebuilt into a Museum in his honour which is expected to highly boost the tourism of this little town. He contributed greatly to the art, technology, and business of the film industry. Up to this day he is considered a pioneer in the film industry.\n\nDue to the stock market crash of 1929, alongside several legal issues, as well as a car accident forced him into a long struggle to fight bankruptcy and eventually Fox lost control of the Fox Film Corporation through a hostile takeover in 1930.\n\nIn 1941 he even served a few months in prison for bribing a judge during the liquidation of his holdings. After that, Fox was forced to retire from the film business as he was blacklisted. He died in 1952 at the age of 73 in New York. None of his former film industry colleagues attended his funeral. Even though he had to sell his interests in the ’30s, his legacy lives on in the name of 20th Century Fox and his films that influenced the lives of millions.\n\nADOLPH ZUKOR, the Founder of Paramount Pictures\n\nAdolph Zukor became one of the fathers of the Hollywood film industry by founding Paramount Pictures. He started from nothing, but he accomplished everything he ever wanted to. Thanks to his hard work he became one of the founders of the American film industry.\n\nHe was born in a Hungarian town called Ricse in 1873, where his parents owned a small shop. He became an orphan at the age of 7.\n\nHe was an exceptional student, but had to start working at the age of 12 while still attending night school. When he turned 15, he decided to travel and emigrate to the United States completely alone. At that time he just finished elementary school and never went back to high school afterward. With just a few bucks sewed into the lining of his coat, Adolph Zukor arrived in New York in 1889.\n\nOnce in the states, he first took a job he could get at a furrier. In his free time he played baseball, and constantly sang Hungarian songs with other immigrant boys. Over the years he saved up a few thousand dollars, and returned to Hungary for a visit, after which he married Lottie Kaufman, who was also a Hungarian immigrant.\n\nIn the 1910s and 20s his career reached its peak, he became one of the most influential people in Hollywood by founding Paramount Pictures and building a whole realm of cinemas and studios around it. But even then, he always kept in touch with his hometown. He even sent money to build a school in Ricse, and to the people in need. He helped his hometown in any way he could.\n\nAlthough he spent most of his life in the United States, he never forgot his hometown and country, where he came from. Perhaps the most expressive and famous legend about him is that he had an inscription on the wall of his office that said: “It is not enough to be Hungarian” - to which he was quoted to add in a low voice: “but it may help.”\n\nIn 1932, Paramount went bankrupt and Zukor left his role as president and became chairman of the board.\n\nAdolph Zukor was a pioneer in the industry, he saw the future and possibilities of the motion picture before most people did. Zukor even got an Academy Award in 1949 for his life achievements. He wrote his memoir in 1953, which is called The Public Is never Wrong. He retired from Paramount in 1949, but held the role of chairman emeritus until his death in 1976 at the age of 103.\n\nToday, Paramount is the fourth oldest surviving film studio in the world.\n\nCurtiz was born in 1886 in Hungary where he later studied the art of filmmaking and directing. Curtiz decided to leave when the Hungarian film industry was nationalized in 1919.\n\nHe first worked in Vienna and moved to America in 1926, where Jack Warner hired him as a director. In the States he directed many classics like The Adventures of Robin Hood, Mildred Pierce and of course Casablanca, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director. Even today the American Film Institute considers Casablanca as the third greatest American movie ever made. But this wasn’t his first Oscar nomination. He had been nominated four times before for Captain Blood, Angels with Dirty Faces, Four Daughters and Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz also worked with such actors as Elvis Presley, Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart.\n\nHe never fully learned English which is a huge part of the anecdotes of him. The most famous story of him is that during a shooting he said: „Bring on the empty horses!” by which he meant bring the horses without riders, but it made his colleagues laugh very hard.\n\nHis most successful period was when he worked for the Warner Brothers and after the 40s, when he tried to become a freelancer, his career began to decline. Still, he continued directing films until his death in 1962. During his career he directed more than 50 films in Europe and more than a hundred in the States.\n\nAndrew G. Vajna, the producer of Rambo and Terminator\n\nAndrew G. Vajna, or as many simply call him Andy Vajna, was one of the most important Hollywood producers of the second half of the 20th century. He was the executive producer of the Rambo series, Terminator 3-5, Die Hard with a Vengeance and Evita, as well as the founder of Carolco Pictures and Cinergi Productions.\n\nAlthough he reached such success in Hollywood, the beginning of his life was extremely tumultuous. In 1956, after the defeat of the Hungarian Revolution by the Soviet Army, he emigrated to the U.S. at the age of 12 with the assistance of the Red Cross. The experience of his parents allowing him to leave to start a new life alone on another continent at such a young age, unquestionably had an enormous influence on his personality, forming it to become driven, inventive, innovative and fearlessly enthusiastic. After learning English, he went on to study cinematography at the University of California. But instead of diving into the film industry, he started to work as a hairdresser and then went to Hong Kong to start a high-quality wig business, which became a huge success.\n\nSelling his company in Hong Kong gave him the financial stability to purchase cinemas in the Far East and to start Panasia, a highly profiting venture dealing with film distribution. He then sold this company of his, to found Carolco Pictures with Mario Kassar in 1976. Starting as a small office with only the two of them and their partners as secretaries, they set out to deal with distribution, funding and selling films on a global scale.\n\nAlongside his Hollywood success, he always sought to connect with Hungary, even before the political change. He was one of the first to bring large scale Hollywood productions to Hungary when as the producer of Red Heat, he took the crew and cast to the other side of the Iron Curtain in 1988. With the political change only a few years away, the change was more tangible in Hungary, making shooting easier here than in Moscow, where they were denied filming permits even for one scene. But Andy’s recklessness was not stopped by that; the most important members of the crew flew to Moscow, where they illegally shot a scene in the Red Square. The production of the film in Hungary was significant because it gave opportunities to many Hungarian actors and generally offered an extraordinary experience for the inhabitants of Budapest to witness a Hollywood production in the making for the first time in their lives.\n\nAfter selling his part of Carolco due to disagreements with his partner, Vajna founded Cinergi Productions in 1989, so that he could continue his passion of independent film production and distribution, which he based on close relations with his creatives partners. But Vajna continued to be on good terms with Carolco and even collaborated as producer of Terminator 2, another of the company’s landmark movies.\n\nVajna’s Cinergi participated in distribution with The Walt Disney Company for nine years. He produced some key films through this company, such as Die Hard with a Vengeance, the third movie of the series, that gained the largest box office success of 1995. He also bought the rights to the story and produced the enormously successful historical musical feature film Evita in 1996. The brilliant super-production stars Madonna as the Argentine president's wife for which she received a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and the film also received awards for Best Picture and Best Original Song. Next to filming on location in Buenos Aires, many key scenes were filmed in Budapest as well. In this period he also worked on other productions with countless other star actors like Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery and Danny DeVito. But regardless, many of the films were not able to gain a sufficient amount of financial success, leading to the company closing in 1998.\n\nLately, a heated debate has evolved surrounding Szabó, since the Hungarian Filmacademy Association has given him a lifetime achievement award in 2020, but a well-known Hungarian historian stood out against this due to Szabó’s spy activities from 1957 to 1963. After the political change, the Hungarian public learned that he wrote reports on the anti-government activities at the Hungarian Film University and specifically on his classmates. After graduating, he continued to report on his fellow directors and actors with whom he collaborated. This was during the period of retaliation after the 1956 revolution when imprisonment and executions were everyday matters in the dictatorship. Following finishing his spy activities at the age of 26, he was constantly granted opportunities to shoot feature films in an era when other talented filmmakers had to wait many years to shoot if they were not collaborative with the Communist Party.\n\nThe news of Szabó’s activity as a communist informer broke in 2006, but he and many others stated he reported with the intentions of defending people. Regardless of his intentions, it is a truly relevant question, whether a director’s film lifetime achievements can be awarded to someone whose first half of his carrier was supported by a dictatorial system, due to his secret reports against his fellow filmmakers. The wider public is provided only limited access to the archive of reports, which makes it quite impossible to be able to certainly decide whether Szabó’s reports were made with good intentions or not.\n\nAnd Many, Many Others...\n\nWe could introduce countless Hungarians who work or worked in the Hollywood film industry, but unfortunately we only have space and time to mention a few more.\n\nYou might know that the protagonist of the legendary Some Like it Hot with Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, was also Hungarian. You might know that, because in the last few decades of his life he took great interest in his Hungarian heritage, along with her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nHis parents were born in Hungary but emigrated to America. Curtis himself could only speak Hungarian until the age of six, which made it difficult for him to start his schooling. With her daughter, Tony Curtis even helped finance rebuilding the Synagogue of Budapest in the 1990s. He also founded the Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture. Furthermore, he promoted the tourism of Hungary in several commercials.\n\nIf you are a fan of the classic Hollywood, you might have heard about George Cukor, the master of romantic movies. Yes, he also had Hungarian blood running through his veins. His parents were also immigrants from Hungary, but Cukor himself was born in New York. He directed such cult classics as The Philadelphia Story, My Fair Lady and Romeo and Juliet. He is also known for playing a huge part in Katharine Hepburn’s rise and success.\n\nFrank Darabont is an American director, screenwriter and producer of Hungarian heritage, whose life story is a typical example of the adventurous and dangerous lives of the Hungarian emigres of the 1956 Revolution. His parents had to flee the country with the infant Darabont hidden in a picnic basket, according to his recollection, arriving in Chicago and then Los Angeles at the age of five. He grew up to become a filmmaker nominated for three Academy Awards and a Golden Globe, renown for adapting Stephen King’s works, such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist to screen. Darabont is also widely respected for developing and executive producing the first season of The Walking Dead horror series and creating the neo-noir TNT series Mob City.\n\nJoe Eszterhas, screenwriter, who after being born in a Hungarian village, ended up in an Austrian refugee camp during the Second World War and then moved with his family to the poor immigrant area of Cleveland, New York. In the 1970s he worked for Rolling Stone and wrote his first screenplay for F.I.S.T. starring Sylvester Stallone. He continued to write the scripts of such cult films as Basic Instinct, Flashdance and Jagged Edge. He also wrote the movie Showgirls’ script, for which he was given an award for the worst screenplay. Paradoxically, as time went on this film still became so popular among the public that it is one of MGM’s top 20 all-time bestsellers. Still, all the scripts he wrote in the next decade never got produced. After a long period of failure, at least one of his scripts finally got produced in 2006. The producer was Andy Vajna, a Hollywood filmmaker also born in Hungary. For this production, they when back to Hungary for shooting the Hungarian language film called Children of Glory, about the 1956 revolution in Budapest.\n\nKlasky Csupo Inc. was founded and is lead by Gábor Csupó and his ex-partner Arlene Klasky. Csupó was born and grew up in Budapest, but escaped the Communist regime in 1975 at the age of 23, moving firstly to Sweden and then to the United States. Klasky Csupo Ins. is one of the world’s most famous animation studios based in Hollywood. Its success peaked in the 1990s, when working on the pilot and first three seasons of world-famous The Simpsons, for which Csupó decided on the series’ characteristically weird colouring. The next huge success came after producing Rugrats, one of Nickelodeon’s first animated shows. They also created Duckman and made further animated series, movies and commercials, even winning an Emmy award.\n\nIn the last few years, films made in Hungary have also been successful in Hollywood, winning Oscars and other internationally renown awards.\n\nMade in 2015, Son of Saul is an Oscar-winning Hungarian film that revisits the topic of the Holocaust in such an innovative and reformative manner, that it shocked the mainstream film industry and audience. Both its story and its unique visual language was inspired by files about and photographs made by members of the Sonderkommando, work units made of prisoners at German Nazi death camps. They were the people forced to do the work behind the constant extermination of the prisoners. The exceptional way that the DOP Erdélyi Miklós and Director Nemes Jeles László use one unusual close-up framing throughout the film brings the world of the deathcamp uncannily close to the viewer, without showing violence and death upfront."
