        "text": "What's new on the small screen\n\nSam Peckinpah: The Legendary Westerns Collection (box set): Ride the High Country; The Wild Bunch; The Ballad of Cable Hogue; Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\n\n18, Warner Home Video, 6 discs, £29.50 (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid special edition available alone, £15.99)\n\n\"I don't suppose there's any other way we could work this out?\" In Sam Peckinpah's dying West, there isn't. Because he's wearing a deputy's badge, the shaggy-bearded oldster Alamosa Bill (Jack Elam) has to step outside and face Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson), a charismatic blue-eyed killer.\n\nIn other words, he must meet his maker. \"The law's a funny thing, ain't it?\"\n\nThe two have just shared a meal with a friendly family, and their sad, perfunctory duel is watched by their hosts and their children. Once Bill, unavoidably plugged, has breathed his last, Billy saddles up and rides away, to the charmed, elegiac incantation of Bob Dylan's Knockin' on Heaven's Door.\n\nFor, in Peckinpah's belated vision, the frontier is closing and, as civilisation creeps in, the men of the gun have to compromise or die.\n\nYoung as he is, Billy has death in his eyes, and a wise little smile that sees the end of the road approaching. His old fellow-outlaw and father figure Pat Garrett (James Coburn) has cynically grasped the dirty dollars of the new era: \"This country's getting old, and I aim to get old with it.\"\n\nPat Garrett is of 1973. In 1970 Peckinpah had made the amazing curate's-egg comedy Ballad of Cable Hogue with Jason Robards, a farcical, hit-and-miss allegory of American success and defeat with touches of Benny Hill vulgarity and yet a stoical resignation (\"No trouble, jest dyin'\") when modern life runs Hogue down.\n\nPeckinpah seemed to have been unbalanced by the sensational reception of The Wild Bunch (1969), his defining film and possibly his best.\n\nIt's again a bloody, bleak elegy, and again a story of love between two men and of murderous betrayal. With a crew of Hollywood western veterans - William Holden and Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine and Edmond O'Brien - Peckinpah absorbs the lessons of Sergio Leone and crafts a paradoxical, immensely influential de-romanticisation of the West as cynical, brutal, treacherous and misogynistic.\n\nYet he re-romanticises it by the back door, disturbingly, in a crescendo of balletic slo-mo blood-spurts. \"The strange thing,\" said Peckinpah, \"is you feel a great sense of loss when these killers reach the end of the line.\"\n\nIt's true, partly because The Wild Bunch is a story of redemption, dignified by the simple rituals of combat and comradely affection. When these whoring, boozed-up renegades choose to take their long, slow walk into danger and die in defence of their Mexican colleague, against hundreds of expendable federales, they go out in style.\n\nLooking further back, that post-Vietnam bloodletting can seem a debased version of the more traditionally redemptive sacrifice at the end of Peckinpah's beautiful second film, Ride the High Country (1962). It's less grandly ambitious, but possibly his most perfect movie.\n\nOld-time gunmen Steve Judd (Joel McCrea, 57) and Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott, 64) seek a purpose riskily transporting gold from a vicious mining town in a new century of automobiles and municipal benches.\n\nThe pathos and delicacy of the interactions of these watery-eyed, rheumatic old friends shows Peckinpah capable of rare moral complexity and passion. \"All I want is to enter my house justified,\" says Judd. At the end of this autumnal, richly human masterpiece, we feel he does. Philip Horne\n\nMephisto\n\n15, Ind DVD, £15.99\n\nThe brilliant Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer was little known off the European stage until this astonishing tour de force in 1981's Oscar-winner for best foreign film.\n\nIt's a role Olivier might have killed for. Brandauer plays Hendrik Hoefgen, an ambitious provincial actor in the final days of the Weimar Republic, who abandons his Left-wing ideals to make it big on the Berlin stage.\n\nHis rise to fame - which sees him courting, to his secret disgust, senior members of the Nazi regime - is a pact with the devil requiring all his expertise as a performer, until he finds himself essentially playing demonic Mephistopheles to his own deluded Faust.\n\nIstván Szabó's film, from the novel by Klaus Mann, is a near-masterpiece about pretence and politics, about an actor burying himself under so many layers of persona that he forgets who he is.\n\nIt's also a remarkably convincing study of the slippery slope towards fascist conformity in the 1930s. When Hoefgen suggests mounting a Nietzschean vision of Hamlet as man of action, you know for sure he's betrayed everything he ever believed in.\n\nNo extras, which is a pity, but the film's an absolute must. Tim Robey\n\nThe General\n\n15, Warner Home Video, £13.99\n\nJohn Boorman's Irish film noir about the working-class Dublin mastercriminal Martin Cahill, who was \"executed\" by an IRA gunman in 1994, is a glittering, inspired masterpiece.\n\nIt's in superb black and white, and packed with bizarre, unforgettable images.\n\nMost surreal is the way Cahill (\"the General\"), magnificently played by Brendan Gleeson, protects his identity from the media and his feelings from the Garda by constantly covering his face with a large, splayed-out hand, one bug-eye staring madly out at the world in self-parodic defiance.\n\nIn its jazz-driven narration of this inveterate showman's astonishing and audacious exploits - stealing Vermeers and raiding high-security jewellers, taunting his police opponents (especially Jon Voight's Inspector Kenny) and outwitting everyone - The General imparts to its grim urban settings the poetic lustre of a tribal legend, as of a modern Finn MacCool.\n\nIt's told with the gusto of an Irish storyteller, but also with a tragic awareness of the ruthlessness and damage in this intoxicating criminal career: Boorman, who lives in Ireland, was himself burgled by Cahill. PH\n\nParadise Now\n\n15, Warner Home Video, £17.99\n\nIn the warm evening sun, two friends sit on a hillside smoking, drinking and talking about girls. They could be young men anywhere, except for one thing - the next morning they are planning to blow themselves up in Tel Aviv.\n\nArab-Israeli director Hany Abu-Assad's Oscar-nominated tale of two Palestinian suicide bombers, Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman), may not seem instantly appealing, but it proves absorbing and refreshingly unpreachy.\n\nTaut and elegantly made, it features outstandingly expressive performances from the increasingly desperate Suliman and the startlingly green-eyed Nashef.\n\nIt helps that the political is rendered personal: Said is shown to be motivated by his father's disgrace as an Israeli collaborator, Khaled by his frustration at the limitations the occupation places on his everyday freedoms.\n\nThis makes the film's uncomfortably sympathetic view of the prospective terrorists easier to digest.\n\nWhatever your reaction to its politics, Paradise Now is a vital, timely and rare portrayal of a seemingly irresolvable conflict - and an engaging depiction of two men trapped within it. Laura Barnett\n\nHostel\n\n18, Sony, £19.99\n\nThe rate is particularly high for tampering with Americans - we sure do hate them over here, seems to be the message - but the movie's inept lack of emotional involvement or likeable characters scotches any suspense.\n\nRoth, a loudmouth protégé of Quentin Tarantino, contributes several thuddingly juvenile commentary tracks in which the word \"cool\" generally comes into play whenever someone's having bits cut off them.\n\nYes, zealous critics have tried to find parallels with Abu Ghraib, but they're clutching at straws, frankly: Hostel is horror cinema at its most blatantly pornographic, xenophobic, dim, grim and subtext-free. Avoid it like the Black Death. TR\n\nTime Bandits\n\nPG, Anchor Bay Entertainment, £15.99\n\nInterviewed in the extras, director Terry Gilliam says that, back in 1981, his intention was to make a film \"intelligent enough for children and exciting enough for adults\".\n\nIf you're returning to his hugely entertaining fantasy adventure for the first time as a grown-up, you'll see just how brilliantly he succeeded.\n\nFrom the moment a scruffy, squabbling bunch of dwarfs tumbles through a time hole and out of the wardrobe in 11-year-old Kevin's suburban bedroom, to the final apocalyptic battle between good and evil, Gilliam's tale (co-written by Michael Palin) bubbles with bright ideas and visual wit. There are even a few entertaining philosophical posers to grapple with.\n\nKevin (Craig Warnock) joins the Bandits (designers of shrubbery during the Creation) as they career through history, encountering Ian Holm as a height-obsessed Napoleon, John Cleese playing Robin Hood as if he were the Duke of Kent, and Sean Connery's Scottish-accented Agamemnon.\n\nRalph Richardson is delightful as a dithering Deity and David Warner hilarious as the Evil One."
