        "text": "BERLIN — Oskar Roehler is breathing new life into the classic story of “Faust.”\n\nThe helmer will direct the pic for Tele Muenchen Group and its production subsid Clasart.\n\nMoritz Bleibtreu (“The Baader Meinhof Complex”) is set to play Mephisto, the only part so far cast in the production.\n\nHigh-profile cinematic adaptations of the German legend include F.W. Murnau’s 1926 film and Peter Gorski’s 1960 version, which starred Gustav Gruendgens (whose own career was the basis for Klaus Mann’s novel “Mephisto” and Istvan Szabo’s 1981 Oscar-winning adaptation, starring Klaus Maria Brandauer).\n\n“Faust” marks Bleibtreu’s fourth outing with Roehler. In addition to 2004’s “Agnes and His Brothers” and 2006’s “The Elementary Particles,” Bleibtreu stars as Joseph Goebbels in Roehler’s upcoming “Jud Suess — Film ohne Gewissen,” alongside Tobias Moretti and Martina Gedeck (“The Baader Meinhof Complex”).\n\n“Jud Suess” is the story of Ferdinand Marian, the actor who appeared in Veit Harlan’s notorious anti-Semitic, Nazi-era film, “Jud Suess,” about the rise and fall of 18th-century German-Jewish financier Joseph Suess Oppenheimer.\n\nConcorde will release “Jud Suess” next year."
