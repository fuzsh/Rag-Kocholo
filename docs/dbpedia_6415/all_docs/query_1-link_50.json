        "text": "Each month, the programmers at the Criterion Channel produce incredible line-ups for their subscribers. For June, the Channel will feature films from Billy Wilder, Terence Davies, Fronza Woods, and more!\n\nBelow you’ll find the programming schedule for the month, along with a complete list of titles that Criterion has in store for us.

Both a powerhouse singer and an actor of staggering emotional range, Judy Garland was the consummate entertainer, a born-in-a-trunk show-business lifer who grew up before the eyes of America and who could embody girl-next-door innocence, vivacious vitality, and tremulous vulnerability with equal conviction. The combination of her dazzling talent and tragic offscreen struggles endeared her to a generation of gay fans—and one hundred years after her birth, Garland remains the most famous musical leading lady in the history of Hollywood. This selection of the beloved MGM films that defined her early career—including collaborations with her frequent costars Mickey Rooney (Girl Crazy) and Gene Kelly (For Me and My Gal, Summer Stock) and director and husband Vincente Minnelli (Meet Me in St. Louis, The Pirate)—celebrates the awe-inspiring artistry of a once-in-a-generation performer.\n\nBabes in Arms, Busby Berkeley, 1939\n\nZiegfeld Girl, Robert Z. Leonard, 1941\n\nFor Me and My Gal, Busby Berkeley, 1942\n\nGirl Crazy, Norman Taurog, 1943\n\nPresenting Lily Mars, Norman Taurog, 1943\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis, Vincente Minnelli, 1944\n\nThe Clock, Vincente Minnelli, 1945\n\nThe Harvey Girls, George Sidney, 1946\n\nEaster Parade, Charles Walters, 1948\n\nThe Pirate, Vincente Minnelli, 1948\n\nIn the Good Old Summertime, Robert Z. Leonard, 1949\n\nSummer Stock, Charles Walters, 1950\n\nMicrobudget Movies\n\nNo budget? No problem! Short on cash but flush with inspiration, these resourceful filmmakers prove that passion and creative vision can turn scarcity into opportunity. From the ultimate in B-noir sleaze (Detour) to counterculture sensations from the indie underground (Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, Eraserhead) to early masterpieces from celebrated international auteurs like Chantal Akerman (Je tu il elle), David Lynch (Eraserhead), Jim Jarmusch (Stranger Than Paradise), Richard Linklater (Slacker), and Jia Zhangke (Xiao Wu), the films in this collection—all made for $150,000 or less—make a little go a long way, refusing to let their shoestring budgets hamper their artistic invention.\n\nDetour, Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945\n\nPather Panchali, Satyajit Ray, 1955\n\nShadows, John Cassavetes, 1959\n\nCarnival of Souls, Herk Harvey, 1962\n\nChafed Elbows, Robert Downey Sr., 1966\n\nThe Shooting, Monte Hellman, 1966\n\nNight of the Living Dead, George A.

Davies’s acute emotional sensitivity remains no less piercing when applied to stories of women colliding against the social forces of their time, as seen in the sublime romantic drama The Deep Blue Sea and the stirring Emily Dickinson biography A Quiet Passion, which feature revelatory performances from Rachel Weisz and Cynthia Nixon respectively.\n\nChildren, 1976\n\nMadonna and Child, 1980\n\nDeath and Transfiguration, 1983\n\nDistant Voices, Still Lives, 1988\n\nThe Long Day Closes, 1992\n\nThe Neon Bible, 1995\n\nOf Time and the City, 2008\n\nThe Deep Blue Sea, 2011\n\nSunset Song, 2015*\n\nA Quiet Passion, 2016\n\n*Available July 1\n\nQueersighted: The Musical!\n\nFeaturing a conversation between series programmer Michael Koresky and Criterion web editor Andrew Chan\n\nThere is an assumption—or, often, a stereotype—that the musical is an inherently gay genre. The strange reality is that, in terms of characters and themes, queer representation is historically quite scarce within the film musical, a genre that largely revolves around heterosexual romance. In this edition of Queersighted, host Michael Koresky and special guest Andrew Chan, editor of Criterion’s online magazine, Current, discuss a selection of tuneful standouts—from the golden age of Hollywood to deconstructed French homage to Taiwanese experimentation—that queer the movie-musical form, whether through subtext, via thrilling subversion, or by virtue of the queer auteurs behind them.\n\nThe Pirate, Vincente Minnelli, 1948\n\nGentlemen Prefer Blondes, Howard Hawks, 1953\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort, Jacques Demy, 1967\n\nOriginal Cast Album: “Company,” D. A. Pennebaker, 1970\n\nVictor/Victoria, Blake Edwards, 1982\n\nA Chorus Line, Richard Attenborough, 1985\n\nGolden Eighties, Chantal Akerman, 1986\n\nThe Hole, Tsai Ming-liang, 1998\n\nDirected by Ulrike Ottinger\n\nFeaturing a new introduction by the filmmaker, part of the Channel’s original Meet the Filmmaker series\n\nDefiantly unconventional, extravagantly stylized, and gleefully transgressive, the sprawling cinematic pageants of Ulrike Ottinger swirl avant-garde provocation, inquisitive ethnography, punk surrealism, and baroque theatricality into some of the most wondrously unclassifiable spectacles of the New German Cinema. Whether seeing Cold War Germany’s divided capital through radically imaginative eyes in her early Berlin Trilogy or exploring the Mongolian steppes and the Bering Sea in her more recent documentaries, Ottinger blends fantasy and observation in her stunning, painterly images. Lesbian pirates (Madame X: An Absolute Ruler), Dorian Gray in drag (Dorian Gray in the Mirror of the Yellow Press), self-flagellating leather daddies (Freak Orlando), and an ennui-stricken socialite drinking herself into oblivion (Ticket of No Return) are just some of the outré (and always outrageously costumed) oddballs populating the Ottinger canon, which audaciously reimagines what cinema can be and for whose gaze it is made.\n\nProgramming consultant: Nellie Killian\n\nLaocoon & Sons, 1972\n\nMadame X: An Absolute Ruler, 1977\n\nTicket of No Return, 1979\n\nFreak Orlando, 1981\n\nDorian Gray in the Mirror of the Yellow Press, 1984\n\nJoan of Arc of Mongolia, 1989\n\nTaiga, 1992\n\nPrater, 2007\n\nChamisso’s Shadow, 2016\n\nParis Calligrammes, 2020\n\nBilly Wilder’s 1940s\n\nAlthough, or perhaps because, he was born in Austria, writer, director, and Hollywood legend Billy Wilder saw America more clearly than most, probing its absurdities, hypocrisies, and self-delusions with a witty and often devastatingly cynical eye. This selection from his 1940s prime brings together two frequently overlooked World War II gems (the dynamic espionage thriller Five Graves to Cairo and the sophisticated romantic comedy A Foreign Affair) and two of his undisputed masterpieces: the definitive film noir Double Indemnity and the intense, groundbreaking study of alcoholic self-destruction The Lost Weekend.\n\nFive Graves to Cairo, 1943\n\nDouble Indemnity, 1944\n\nThe Lost Weekend, 1945\n\nA Foreign Affair, 1948\n\nCRITERION COLLECTION EDITIONS\n\nPremiering June 1\n\nRound Midnight: Criterion Collection Edition #1122\n\nPaying tribute to the Black expat musicians who found refuge in postwar France, Bertrand Tavernier’s majestically melancholy love letter to the heyday of American bebop is one of the best jazz movies ever made.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: A rare behind-the-scenes documentary; an interview with critic Gary Giddins; a conversation with music producer Michael Cuscuna and author Maxine Gordon, widow of musician Dexter Gordon; a panel conversation featuring Tavernier; and more.\n\nDouble Indemnity: Criterion Collection Edition #1126\n\nBilly Wilder set the standard for film-noir fatalism with this seductively sordid James M. Cain adaptation, one of the most wickedly perverse love stories ever told.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Audio commentary featuring critic Richard Schickel; an interview with film scholar Noah Isenberg; a conversation between film historians Eddie Muller and Imogen Sara Smith; Billy, How Did You Do It?, a 1992 film by Volker Schlöndorff and Gisela Grischow featuring interviews with director Billy Wilder; and more.\n\nSeconds: Criterion Collection Edition #667\n\nRock Hudson is a revelation in this sinister science-fiction freak-out from director John Frankenheimer.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FEATURES: Audio commentary featuring Frankenheimer, a program on the making of the film, a video essay by film scholars R. Barton Palmer and Murray Pomerance, an interview with Frankenheimer, and more.\n\nEXCLUSIVE STREAMING PREMIERES\n\nJune 1\n\nFire Music\n\nAlthough the free-jazz movement of the 1960s and ’70s was met with heated controversy, its pioneers—brilliant talents like Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, and John Coltrane—are today acknowledged as central to the evolution of jazz as America’s most innovative art form. Fire Music showcases the architects of a revolution in sound whose radical brand of improvisation pushed harmonic and rhythmic boundaries and produced landmark albums like Coleman’s Free Jazz: A Collective Inspiration and Coltrane’s Ascension. A treasure trove of archival footage conjures the kaleidoscopic world of the 1960s jazz scene along with incisive reflections by critic Gary Giddins and a number of the movement’s key players.\n\nJune 2\n\nKaren Dalton: In My Own Time\n\nWith her plaintive, bluer-than-blue voice, singer Karen Dalton rose to prominence within the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s—though her rough-edged authenticity stood out even within that storied bohemian world. Idolized by contemporaries like Bob Dylan and younger musicians like Nick Cave, Dalton discarded the traditional trappings of success and instead lived a defiantly unconventional life, one committed to her artistry. Since most images of Dalton have been lost or destroyed, this poignant documentary uses Dalton’s dulcet melodies and interviews with loved ones to build a rich portrait of this singular woman and her hauntingly beautiful voice.\n\nJune 14\n\nChameleon Street\n\nFeaturing a new introduction by Criterion curatorial director Ashley Clark, part of the Channel’s original Spotlight series\n\nWinner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1990 Sundance Film Festival—yet criminally underseen for over three decades—Chameleon Street recounts the improbable but true story of Michigan con man Douglas Street, the titular “chameleon” who successfully impersonated his way up the socioeconomic ladder by posing as a magazine reporter, an Ivy League student, a respected surgeon, and a corporate lawyer. Distinguished by a dexterous performance and daring direction from actor-writer-director Wendell B. Harris Jr., this audacious dark comedy trains an incisive lens on the roles that race, class, and performance play in the formation of American identity. Piercingly funny and aesthetically mischievous, Chameleon Street is a newly restored landmark of independent filmmaking.\n\nCRITERION ORIGINALS\n\nJune 8\n\nSecrets of the Hollywood Archives: Forbidden Planet\n\nOne of the most influential science-fiction films of the 1950s, Forbidden Planet shaped the evolution of the genre for decades to come with its groundbreaking production design, special effects, and electronic score. In this edition of Secrets of the Hollywood Archives, Oscar-winning visual-effects artist Craig Barron and sound designer Ben Burtt pull back the curtain to reveal the movie magic behind what they describe as the most iconic spaceship-landing scene in film history.\n\nJune 16\n\nObservations on Film Art No. 47: Reflections in and on Yi Yi\n\nOne of the first masterworks of the twenty-first century, Edward Yang’s Yi Yi is an at once epic and intimate portrait of a year in the life of a Taiwanese family. It is also, as Professor Jeff Smith argues in this edition of Observations on Film Art, a valentine to the transcendent possibilities of cinema. Exploring Yang’s subtly sophisticated use of framing, reflections, and the techniques of rear projection and superimposition, Smith reveals how the director uses these uniquely cinematic devices to draw our attention to the moments of ephemeral beauty that pass, almost unnoticed, across our everyday field of vision.\n\nCELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH\n\nPremiering June 1\n\nLGBTQ+ Shorts\n\nStories of self-discovery, self-acceptance, and the simple but radical, often dangerous act of just existing as a queer person are on display in these empathetic and innovative shorts, which reflect the wide spectrum of experiences that make up the LGBTQ+ rainbow.\n\nAudience, Barbara Hammer, 1982\n\nThe Salt Mines, Carlos Aparicio and Susana Aikin, 1990\n\nTranseltown, Myra Paci, 1992\n\nThe

of a Black butch lesbian, the debut feature from Campbell X puts a brash and bracingly contemporary spin on the romantic-comedy formula.\n\nZero Patience\n\nInspired by the story of Gaëtan Dugas—the gay French Canadian flight attendant wrongly blamed for being “patient zero” in the North American AIDS epidemic—John Greyson’s daring and controversial New Queer Cinema classic reimagines an episode of queer persecution as a subversive camp musical.\n\nLilting\n\nHong Khaou’s debut feature boasts extraordinary performances by martial-arts legend Cheng Pei Pei as Junn, a Cambodian-Chinese mother grieving the untimely death of her only son, and Ben Whishaw as her son’s lover, Richard.\n\nVictor and Victoria\n\nThis dazzling musical romance from the final days of Weimar Germany is every bit as charming and outrageous as its famous American remake, calling to mind the sly sex comedies of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder.\n\nThe Delta\n\nIra Sachs’s doomed romance moodily evokes the wide space between dreams, desires, and fulfillment in post–Vietnam War America.\n\nMore LGBTQ+ films featured in this month’s programming:\n\nTerence Davies: A Retrospective\n\nQueersighted: The

beauty, pain, and power.
