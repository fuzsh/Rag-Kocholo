        "text": "The event in Watton, founded more than 140 years ago, is one of the oldest one-day agricultural shows in the country.\n\nAttractions at this summer's showcase including a Shetland pony derby, sheepdog demonstrations, vintage cars, a brass band and dancers.\n\nBut with farming heritage at the heart of its appeal, there were also traditional livestock displays and competitions, culminating in the \"Champion of Champions\" title - won by a Welsh sow named Bonnie, shown by Kristina Cullington from Lenwade.\n\nThe livestock judging process was explained to the public in a Main Ring demonstration, which was one of the new ideas for 2024.\n\nPaul Chubbock, one of the show's directors, said: \"Everybody is buzzing. It was a super, fantastic show.\n\n\"Certainly the [attendance] numbers were up on last year, people were enjoying themselves and there was lots of nice feedback.\n\n\"It is an agricultural show, that is the heart of it. I would use the same word again - the animal section was buzzing. We had a large amount of young handlers, and there were lots of youngsters coming forward to claim their prizes, which is great to see.\n\n\"Some were asking the judges: 'How did you judge my sheep, and how could we make it better?' There was a lot of engagement, the judges didn't just walk off after the competition.\n\n\"We also had some Dexter cattle and obviously everyone was really happy to see cattle back at the show after a bit of a break.\n\n\"People are serious about their animals and they want them to be the best in the show, but the overall thing is it is fun rural entertainment. That is what it is all about.\"\n\nMr Chubbock said among the most popular events in the Main Ring were the Shetland Derby, where youngsters race ponies around the arena, and an unusual sheepdog demonstration - rounding up ducks and geese instead of sheep.\n\nThe show also raises money for charities and community groups, and Mr Chubbock said he wanted to thank its sponsors, traders and volunteers, as well as the committee for \"all the hard work they have done over the year to make the show work\".\n\nWAYLAND SHOW LIVESTOCK CHAMPIONS 2024\n\nCATTLE.
