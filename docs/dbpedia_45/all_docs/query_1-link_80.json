        "text": "Wayland is a semi-rural community located in the MetroWest region of Eastern Massachusetts, in Middlesex County just 18 miles from Boston, 26 miles from Worcester and 203 miles from New York City. Wayland is bordered on the west by Sudbury and Framingham, on the south by Natick, on the north by Concord and Lincoln and on the east by Weston. Wayland is accessible and attractive as a suburb to the City of Boston and to the businesses and industries located along the Route 128 with convenient access to the Massachusetts Turnpike.\n\nThe meadows and marshes along the ten-mile course of the Sudbury River through Wayland have been kept relatively unspoiled and are now the object of private and public efforts to maintain them in their natural state. They are still full of wild life and are beautiful to see. They provide an open, rural setting and contribute to the attractive features and uniqueness of this almost purely residential town.\n\nWayland is the home of two public golf courses, Wayland Country Club and Sandy Burr Country Club both located on Route 27. There is a town beach located on Lake Cochituate that offers swimming and a boat launch to its residents and guests. Wayland is also fortunate to have other recreational areas such as Mill Pond for fishing, pine-forested picnic areas and many conservation areas for hiking and horse riding trails. In addition, Wayland promotes outdoors athletic activities and provides well equipped basketball courts, ten tennis courts, ice-skating areas, a swimming pool, and several playgrounds.\n\nThe Wayland Public School system is regularly ranked as one of the top ten school systems in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The schools strive to maintain a strong academic curriculum. In addition, the Wayland Public School Childrenâ€™s Center provides full childcare service from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm in a healthy and safe environment for children in grades K-5 every school day. Additional childcare programs are available during school vacations and the summer.\n\nThe Town of Wayland is located in the MetroWest region, situated at the halfway point between Boston and Worcester. Wayland is just one of nine communities that comprise MetroWest, the others are Ashland, Framingham, Holliston, Hopkinton, Natick, Sherborn, Southborough and Sudbury. MetroWest is a region rich in history and natural beauty, and offers visitors and residents alike, a vast array of opportunities for such activities as shopping, sightseeing, dining and entertainment.\n\nAttractions within MetroWest include Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, the oldest continuously operating inn in America, and the peaceful Sudbury River, which provided waterpower for the grain and textile mills that once dotted its shores. The Framingham/Natick stretch of Route 9 features literally hundreds of retail establishments of all kinds as well as fine and casual dining, making it a premier shopping destination. Just bordering the MetroWest region is another premier shopping destination located in Wellesley, which offers a broad array of upscale dining and shopping, with many small shops and boutiques along Routes 135 and 116. Outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the abundance of parks, forests, lakes and nature preserves in the region. History buffs can travel back in time to our country's earliest days when they visit nearby landmarks commemorating skirmishes that marked the beginning of the American Revolution. And art lovers will enjoy the variety of museums and galleries they'll find here.\n\nKnown as the \"Crossroads of New England\", MetroWest is easily accessible by air, rail and bus. Both Boston's Logon International Airport and the Worcester Regional Airport are just 30 minutes away, and the area is served by major highway interchanges - including Interstate 495 and 95, Route 9 and the Massachusetts Turnpike (Route 90)."
