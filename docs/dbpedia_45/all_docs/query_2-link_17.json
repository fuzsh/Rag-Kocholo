        "text": "There are statements that seems very logicial and sensible, but are they actually true? Like in chess, a move can look very logical seeing 5 moves in the future, but it can easily actually be a blunder seeing more.\n\nFor example, there is a sensible argument: \"typing fast won't make you a good programmer, because you spend most the time thinking\". This sounds very logical and sensible, but the truth is the faster you get your idea on to the screen, the more time you can spend thinking about what's wrong with it and how to improve it, you will learn more things and become better faster. I can believe someone to be an ok or even good programmer with bad typing-speed, but I am very confident that you will never be great without a fast typing-speed, your time is just too limited.\n\nThe more time past, the very sensible idea of ensuring good security by having the compositor having a final say in everything sounds good, but in the end it just won't allow certain good UX to be done, like the multiple windows app problem. So is the idea of Wayland actually the best? X is bad, its problem is already recognized while people are still developing it. However, I felt like wayland get a pass because there are so much time resources already putting into it, so many code was written and review with certain ideals, that it is just too late for re-thinking.\n\nIn the end, I felt like the best actual thing is a compromise somewhere between X and Wayland, but like for many other things, we human tend to think the opposite of something bad is good and just have to go too far in another direction, and these will become valuable examples for the future generations to learn from, to improve and to propose something better.\n\nI felt like there eventually be a 3-4 years period where wayland is dominant, but people will be frustrated enough and something else will pop up."
