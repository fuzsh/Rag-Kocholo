The parade will step off from the Wayland Middle School at 11:00 a.m. and proceed along Main Street (Route 27 South) to Commonwealth Road (Route 30 West) and end at Wayland’s Lakeview Cemetery in Cochituate.\n\nThis year’s parade Grand Marshal will be Wayland resident Matthew Karpacz, Chair of Troop 1 Wayland Scouts of America. Troop 1 will have a special float in the parade to commemorate their 100th anniversary.\n\nWayland’s Ceremony of Remembrance will follow at the conclusion of the parade in Lakeview Cemetery (80 Commonwealth Road – Route 30 – Wayland, MA) at approximately 11:30am. The ceremony will honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation.\n\nThis year’s ceremony will feature a number of speakers, including a reading of the Gettysburg Address by Wayland High School junior, Alexander Irwin.\n\nThe Keynote Address will be given by Lieutenant Colonel Andrew R. Ballow, Commander, US Army Garrison Natick, Natick Soldier Systems Center. Lt. Col. Ballow assumed command of the U.S. Army Garrison, Natick Soldier Systems Center on June 30, 2023. A native of Buffalo, New York, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Infantry in 2005. Lt. Col. Ballow holds a Bachelor of Arts in political science and public policy from Syracuse University, and a Master of Science in defense analysis from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He is a Green Beret and has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and across Africa and Europe.\n\nThe patriotic music program will be performed by the Wayland High School and Wayland Middle School bands. The Memorial Day Ceremony of Remembrance will conclude with the playing of Echo Taps, a Rifle Salute by the American Legion Post #133 Firing Detail, and Benediction given by Reverend Rebecca Cho, Community United Methodist Church.\n\nIn the event of rain, the parade will be canceled and the Memorial Day Ceremony of Remembrance will be held indoors, at 11:00am in the Wayland Middle School Gymnasium. We welcome all who can attend. We also invite those unable to attend in person to view the live recording of the Ceremony of Remembrance on WayCAM.
