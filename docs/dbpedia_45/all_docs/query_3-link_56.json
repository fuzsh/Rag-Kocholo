Better site design includes conserving and protecting natural areas and open space, reducing impervious cover, and using natural features for stormwater management.\n\nCLEARING\n\nAny activity that removes the vegetative surface cover.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND WASTE MATERIALS\n\nExcess or discarded building or site materials, including but not limited to concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste at construction sites that may adversely impact water quality.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nThe modification of land to accommodate a new use or expansion of an existing use, usually involving construction.\n\nILLICIT DISCHARGE\n\nAny direct or indirect discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system and municipal storm drain system that is not composed entirely of stormwater, except for projects exempted by this bylaw or regulations issued thereunder. The term does not include a discharge in compliance with an NPDES stormwater discharge permit or resulting from fire-fighting activities.\n\nIMPERVIOUS SURFACE\n\nAny material or structure on or above the ground that prevents water infiltration to the underlying soils. \"Impervious surface\" includes without limitation roads, paved parking lots, sidewalks, stone patios, decking, and rooftops.\n\nINFILTRATION\n\nThe movement of water downward into the soil. Infiltration is important to replenishing the groundwater.\n\nLAND-DISTURBING ACTIVITY\n\nAny activity including clearing, the removal of trees and other vegetation that causes a change in the position or location of soil, sand, rock, gravel, or similar earth material.\n\nLOCAL GENERAL PERMIT\n\nWork permitted by right under this chapter, providing that there is an approved erosion and sediment control plan for the land-disturbing activity.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS STORMWATER MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nThe policy issued by the Department of Environmental Protection, and as amended, that coordinates the requirements prescribed by state regulations promulgated under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, MGL c. 131, § 40, and the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, MGL c. 21, §§ 23 through 56.\n\nMUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4) or MUNICIPAL STORM DRAIN SYSTEM\n\nThe system of conveyances designed or used for collecting or conveying stormwater, including any road with a drainage system, street, gutter, curb, inlet, piped storm drain, pumping facility, retention or detention basin, natural or man-made or altered drainage channel, reservoir, and other drainage structure that together comprise the storm drainage system owned or operated by the Town of Wayland.\n\nNATURAL VEGETATED STATE\n\nGround covers of native plants species and other trees, shrubs, and/or grasses that are not mowed more than twice a year.\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENT\n\nAny construction or land disturbance of a parcel of land that is currently in a natural vegetated state and does not contain alteration by man-made activities.\n\nNON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION\n\nPollution from many diffuse sources caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into water resource areas.\n\nNPDES PERMIT\n\nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, a permit program of the Clean Water Act administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE PLAN (O & M) PLAN\n\nA plan setting up the functional, financial, and organizational mechanisms for the ongoing operation and maintenance of a stormwater management system to ensure that it continues to function as designed.\n\nOUTFALL\n\nA pipe or conduit discharging water.\n\nOWNER\n\nA person with a legal or equitable interest in property.\n\nPOST-DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe conditions that reasonably may be expected or anticipated to exist after completion of the land development activity on a specific site or tract of land. Post-development refers to the phase of a new development or redevelopment project after completion and does not refer to the construction phase of the project.\n\nPRE-CONSTRUCTION\n\nAll activity in preparation for construction.\n\nRECHARGE\n\nThe replenishment of underground water reserves.\n\nREDEVELOPMENT\n\nAny ground surface disturbing construction, alteration, demolition, or improvement of a parcel of land that currently lacks a natural vegetated state and contains alterations by man-made activities.\n\nRUNOFF\n\nWater from precipitation, rainfall, snowmelt, or irrigation, which flows broadly over the ground surface as opposed to a channel. Also called \"stormwater runoff' or \"direct runoff.\"\n\nSEDIMENT\n\nMineral or organic soil material that is transported by wind or water from its origin to another location; the product of erosion processes.\n\nSEDIMENTATION\n\nThe process or act of deposition of sediment.\n\nSITE\n\nAny lot or parcel of land or area of property where land-disturbing activities are, were, or will be performed.\n\nSLOPE\n\nThe incline of a ground surface expressed as a ratio of horizontal distance to vertical distance.\n\nSOIL\n\nAny earth, sand, rock, gravel, or similar material.\n\nSTABILIZATION\n\nThe use, singly or in combination, of mechanical, structural, or vegetative methods, to prevent or retard erosion.\n\nSTORMWATER\n\nRunoff from precipitation or snowmelt, surface water and drainage.\n\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND LAND DISTURBANCE PERMIT (SMLDP)\n\nThe permit issued following a review of an application, plans, calculations and other supporting documents, which is designed to protect the environment of the Town of Wayland from deleterious effects of uncontrolled and untreated stormwater runoff.\n\nSTRIP\n\nAny activity that removes vegetative ground surface cover, including, but not limited to, tree removal, clearing, grubbing, and storage or removal of topsoil.\n\nTOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS)\n\nA measure of the sediments in a unit volume of water. Small particles of mineral and organic matter that are suspended within water runoff. TSS does not include sediment fractions larger than two millimeters in size.\n\nVERNAL POOL\n\nAny confined basin or depression not occurring in existing lawns, gardens, landscaped areas, or driveways, which normally holds water for a minimum of two continuous months during the spring and/or summer, contains at least 200 cubic feet of water at some time during most years, is free of adult predatory fish populations, and provides essential breeding and rearing habitat functions for amphibian, reptile, or other vernal pool community species. In addition this definition, shall include any vernal pool certified by the Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) of the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.\n\nWATERCOURSE\n\nA natural or man-made channel through which water flows or a stream of water, including a river, brook, or underground stream.\n\nWATERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH\n\nAll waters within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, including, without limitation, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, springs, impoundments, estuaries, wetlands, coastal waters, and groundwater.\n\nWAYLAND'S WETLANDS AND WATER RESOURCES PROTECTION BYLAW\n\nChapter 194 of the Town Code.\n\nWETLAND RESOURCE AREA\n\nAreas specified in the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act and/or in Wayland's Wetlands and Water Resources Bylaw."
