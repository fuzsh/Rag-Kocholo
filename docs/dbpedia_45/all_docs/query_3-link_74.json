        "text": "Weston (Wayland) Â¶\n\nWayland is a protocol for communication between a display server and its clients. A Wayland server uses the Wayland protocol to communicate with a GUI program, which is a Wayland client . A Wayland server is also called a Wayland compositor , as it also acts as a compositing window manager.\n\nThe Weston server, usually just called Weston , is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor. It manages the displays, including composition of their contents, support for their input device events (touch screen, mouse, keyboard, etc.), and their settings (wallpapers, resolution, multi-monitor display, etc.).\n\nWeston is lightweight compared to X11, and is fast as a compositor. It is suitable for many embedded and mobile use cases.\n\nThe current release of Jetson Linux supports Weston 6.0."
