Everything's working fine but there is one small thing which is annoying me.\n\nI have installed the minimal installation and then installed additional packages I wanted. Among them Firefox which has been installed as snap version.\n\nIf I login using Wayland, the first time I try to start Firefox I can see only a black screen. If I quit the application and I start the application again then it's working fine. This happens if I try to run Firefox by clicking the icon on the left or if I start Firefox from the terminal windows by typing firefox.\n\nAfter some checks, I have noticed that this happens only in Wayland. If I start with Xorg then this problem does not occur.\n\nHere the info about the Firefox version installed:\n\nname: firefox summary: Mozilla Firefox web browser publisher: Mozilla✓ store-url: https://snapcraft.io/firefox contact: https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla license: unset description: | Firefox is a powerful, extensible web browser with support for modern web application technologies. commands: - firefox - firefox.geckodriver snap-id: 3wdHCAVyZEmYsCMFDE9qt92UV8rC8Wdk tracking: latest/stable/ubuntu-22.04 refresh-date: 4 days ago, at 06:30 CET channels: latest/stable: 110.0-3 2023-02-16 (2356) 252MB - latest/candidate: 110.0-3 2023-02-14 (2356) 252MB - latest/beta: 111.0b2-1 2023-02-17 (2370) 192MB - latest/edge: 112.0a1 2023-02-18 (2373) 197MB - esr/stable: 102.8.0esr-2 2023-02-16 (2364) 185MB - esr/candidate: 102.8.0esr-2 2023-02-16 (2364) 185MB - esr/beta: ↑ esr/edge: ↑ installed: 110.0-3 (2356) 252MB -\n\nIs there any log where I can get some more information about this behavior?\n\nI found in the internet, on a post on reddit.com, someone reporting the same issue. Any suggestion?\n\nKind regards, Al"
