» Unique New York: 17 foods from Upstate NY that we all love

We listed three in Rochester because of its size. As with our other similar dining guide lists, these are not necessarily the best restaurants in each place, but rather they offer a tasty sampler of diners, steak houses, sub shops, lakefront restaurants, pizza and wing joints, historic inns, taverns and sports bars. Some are tourist meccas; some are off the grid. Some elegant and some, well, not so elegant. But all are places for a delicious bite to eat. Happy dining in the Mighty 585!

Albion: 39 Problems

Clever name for a great restaurant. Upon starting the eatery, the owners soon found out that there were more problems than they had planned to deal with (hence “39 Problems”). Not a large place, but the food is excellent here and it gets awfully comfortable sipping a signature cocktail at their long bar. Featured Pick: Smoked Prime Rib (served Friday and Saturday until gone). Comes with au jus and two sides, or upgrade to a side of Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese.
