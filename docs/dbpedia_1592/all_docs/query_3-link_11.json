        "text": "Brazilian cheese\n\nMinas CheeseCountry of originBrazilRegionMinas GeraisSource of milkCowTexturesemi-softFat contentDepends on varietyAging timeDepends on varietyCertificationNo Related media on Commons\n\nMinas cheese (queijo minas or Portuguese: queijo-de-minas, pronounced [ˈkejʒu (dʒi) ˈmĩnɐs], literally \"cheese from Minas\") is a type of cheese that has been traditionally produced in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.[1]\n\nIt comes in three varieties, named queijos-de-minas frescal (fresh),[2] meia-cura (half-aged) and curado (aged). A fourth variety, branded queijo padrão (\"standard\" cheese) has been developed more recently and can be found in nearly all supermarkets and grocery stores in Brazil. It is similar to frescal, but not as immensely juicy, soft and mild, and also generally less salty.[3]\n\nMinas cheese is made from cow's milk according to traditional recipes. It used to be matured naturally in open air or, much less often, over a cooker to dry with the heat. Mainly used for people who want to have a healthier diet, recommended in diets and even for people with gastritis.\n\nFrescal cheese (as the name implies) is served quite fresh, about 4–10 days after preparation, still white and tender. Good frescal must be juicy, soft, and slightly granulated (instead of rubbery), with a mild taste. The saltiness of its taste might vary widely across producer.\n\nIt is not good for cooking, except with beef or pork (the juice helps change its taste), or, as an ingredient to a wider recipe, grilled with sauces such as soy sauce until rubbery. It can be used to make sandwiches, pastries, and crêpes, but it gets slightly rubbery instead of stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked onions, tomato, as well as salad rockets, cooked spinach and other strong-tasting vegetables.\n\nCurado cheese is ready for consumption when the juice has evaporated and the cheese has solidified and acquired a yellowish tint. Good curado cheese must have a white core, punctured with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a stronger taste, tending to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used for a huge variety of dishes of all types, including pastel de queijo and the famous pão de queijo (cheese bun).\n\nFrescal cheese is often served with goiabada, a sweet product made out of guavas similar to quince cheese. When these two flavors are combined it is known as Romeu e Julieta, and this combination can be eaten as it is or used in a wide variety of dishes like cake, pie or ice cream. Frescal cheese also pairs well with other forms of fruit preserve or Doce de Leite.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazilian cuisine\n\nRequeijão\n\nCoffee production in Brazil\n\nList of Brazilian dishes\n\nList of cheeses\n\nCachaça"
