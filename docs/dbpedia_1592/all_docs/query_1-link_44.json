        "text": "There are plenty of reasons to visit Evora. That is why it has always been one of the favorite destinations in Portugal for national and foreign tourists. This list shows only one of the possible top 10 reasons to visit Evora. Get inspired.\n\nVisit Evora – Location\n\nWhere is Evora? In the heart of Alentejo, halfway between Lisbon and the Estremadura region of Spain.\n\nSo, if there weren’t enough reasons to visit Evora for the beauty of the city, its location makes it the ideal starting point to visit Alentejo and its cities, villages and landscapes; taste its food; know its history; rest or live an adventure on the plains or in the ocean.\n\nWhoever travels in Portugal between the Algarve and the North of the country or between the region of Lisbon and Spain (towards Madrid) must come to Evora. Don’t just pass through. Stay for a few days.\n\nVisit Evora – World Heritage Unesco\n\nEvora was considered a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1986. According to this organisation, Evora is a museum-city with roots dating back to roman times. The golden age happened in the 16th century, when the portuguese kings lived here.\n\nSome of the highlights in Evora are the architecture of the white houses, the tiles and the balconies. These features make Evora the best example of a city in the prime of the History of Portugal after the destruction of Lisbon in the 1755 earthquake. It was also in Evora that the inspiration was found to build portuguese cities in Brazil, such as Salvador da Bahia.\n\nUnesco also mentions other strong reasons to visit Evora: the old wall, the Aqueduto da Água de Prata Agua de Prata Aqueduct, medieval buildings like the cathedral, convents, palaces, churches, squares. Come and see these places with your own eyes.\n\nVisit Evora – Culture\n\nThe cultural attractions in Evora are much more than just traces of the past, although places such as the Colégio do Espírito Santo in the University of Evora or the “Fresco Route” (which shows us the baroque period of Evora) are, on their own, invitations you just can’t say no to.\n\nIn the past years, more and more Evora museums and other points of interest on a cultural level were born, making this city in Alentejo an amazing place to visit even in hot, cold or rainy weather.\n\nBuildings like the beautiful Teatro Garcia de Resende (Garcia de Resende Theatre) and a few others all over Evora host events related with the arts; theatre, puppets, painting, short films,… The Conservatório Regional de Évora (Regional Conservatory of Music in Evora), Eborae Música, frequently organises classical music shows.\n\nThe Museu de Évora Evora Museum permanently displays a collection of archaeology, art and the assets from the convents of Evora. Apart from that, it also has temporary exhibitions about various topics.\n\nThe quality of the newly-opened cultural centre of the Fundação Eugénio de Almeida, Eugénio de Almeida Foundation, is at an international level with excellent temporary exhibitions held in a renovated building with a strong past behind it, since it was once used as the Palace of Inquisition (Palácio da Inquisição).\n\nFor those who appreciate culture and are looking for a reason to visit Evora, do not leave without getting to know the Evora Cathedral Sacred Art Museum (Museu de Arte Sacra da Sé de Évora), the Traditional Arts Centre (Centro de Artes Tradicionais), the Coach Museum (Museu de Carruagens) and other small spaces easy to find in the city. So that you fall even more in love with the Alentejo.\n\nVisit Evora – Food and Wine\n\nTo eat and drink the magnificent products from the Alentejo region is surely well up in the list of priorities for the tourists who visit Evora. The gastronomy of Alentejo is one of the richest, most notorious in Portugal and a worthy representative of the mediterranean diet.\n\nEating Alentejo style\n\nIn Evora and its surroundings it is easy to find a restaurant to taste delicious food served with the world-wide reputed wines of the region of Alentejo. Among many traditional delicacies, the following dishes still manage to stand out, almost invariably seasoned with condiments grown in Alentejo (coriander, mint, pennyroyal, oregano, olive oil, garlic, onions, laurel leaves,…).\n\nAppetizers: mature cheese, sausage, olives, prosciutto.\n\nSoup: bacon, dogfish, purslane, tomato.\n\nMain dishes: ensopado de borrego (lamb stew), cabeça de xara, pezinhos de porco de coentrada, açorda à alentejana (bread soup), gaspacho à alentejana (gazpacho), game dishes, pork crumbs, (migas com carne de porco), sargalheta.\n\nDessert: trouxas de ovos, pão de ló, queijadas de Evora, filhós enroladas, queijadas de requeijão, bolo de mel, queijinhos do céu de Mora, pastéis de toucinho de Arraiolos, pão de rala, sericaia and other sweets made with eggs, almonds and squash.\n\nDon’t forget to try the Alentejo bread, dense and tasty, at lunch or dinner time or as part of a sandwich to start your day of have a mid-afternoon snack. In the pastries and cafes, pick one (or two) cakes from the amazing portuguese pastry and/or a chicken pot pie.\n\nA lot of the delicacies suggested here are only available in certain seasons of the year. This means that, to taste them all, you will have to come back and visit Evora again. Why not between January and April, to follow the event “Route of Traditional Flavours” (Rota de Sabores Tradicionais) in restaurants, pastries and gourmet shops? Your sense of taste will be forever thankful.\n\nDrinking wine from Alentejo\n\nIn the Evora Tourism Region we can find as many as 5 of the 8 wine-growing sub-regions in Alentejo. This means that you will be able to taste amazing wines with the title V.Q.P.R.D. (Vinho de Qualidade Produzido em Região Demarcada, a “quality wine produced in a specified region”) produced in this region or another one in Portugal. Try them out in one of the wine bars or in any restaurant in Evora.\n\nThe wines which the grape varieties in Evora give us are called Pêra Manca, Cartuxa and Monte dos Pinheiros, coming from Adega da Cartuxa (Cartuxa Winery). It is part of the Rota dos Vinhos do Alentejo (Alentejo Wine Route), which allows every person who loves drinking to get to know the wineries and taste different wines all over Alentejo. One more reason to drive on the open roads taking you to or from Evora along the plains.\n\nWhile you are staying in Evora, visit Vinhos do Alentejo space (Alentejo Wines). Accept the invitation and learn about wine-grape varieties and Enotourism in Alentejo.\n\nVisit Evora – Megalithic Monuments\n\nSince prehistoric times, Man has been staying in the region of Evora because of its natural characteristics. So, this is one more reason to visit Evora and its remote past, which make it the Capital of the Iberian Megalithic.\n\nPlaces like Anta Grande do Zambujeiro (dolmen), Cromeleque dos Almendres (cromlech) and Menir dos Almendres (menhir) are only a few prehistoric traces near the city which are part of the Megalithic Circuit in Evora. To complement your visit, go to the interpretation centre Megalithica Ebora, in Convento dos Remédios, where you will get to know two essential periods of the formation of the city of Evora, the megalithic period and the roman period.\n\nVisit Evora – Tranquility\n\nEvora and the whole Alentejo are extremely inviting for those who look for tranquility in their visit.

They all had and still have a function. But they are also the perfect souvenir to take home after you visit Evora and a form to appreciate the art which shows us the ancient way of living.\n\nOf all the beautiful pieces that you will find in the Museu do Artesanato e do Design de Évora (Handicraft and Design Museum of Evora) and in the many handicraft shops in the city, the most precious highlights go to objects made of clay, iron, cork, leather and horn. And also the tableware, the lace, embroidery and tapestry ones.
