        "text": "Being a citizen or resident of Portugal now comes with free access to 37 museums, monuments, and palaces across the country for 52 days a year. And the best part is? You get to choose the days.\n\nWider Access to Culture\n\nIn an effort to promote cultural heritage and accessibility, the Portuguese government has just announced this new initiative, effective immediately. Previously, free access was restricted to Sundays and holidays, a policy implemented by the government of António Costa. The new government, led by Luís Montenegro, has expanded this initiative, allowing visits on any day of the week. This change aims to spread visitor numbers more evenly throughout the week, reducing weekend overcrowding and long queues.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTo benefit from this program, citizens and residents only need to present their citizen or resident card and NIF (tax identification number) at the ticket office of the museum or monument they wish to visit. This day will then be deducted from their annual quota of 52 free access days. Any free access day allows free access ALL day, which means that you can visit multiple museums and monuments for free on the same day.\n\nSee 16 Sites for Free in Lisbon\n\nThe Lisbon metropolitan area alone is home to 16 of these 37 cultural facilities. Notable sites include:\n\nMonastery of the Jerónimos\n\nMuseum of Popular Art\n\nNational Museum of Archaeology\n\nNational Museum of Ancient Art\n\nMuseu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea — Museu do Chiado\n\nMuseum of Ethnology\n\nMuseu Nacional do Azulejo\n\nNational Museum of Theatre and Dance\n\nNational Costume Museum\n\nMuseu Nacional dos Coches and Picadeiro Real\n\nAjuda National Palace\n\nNational Pantheon\n\nBelém Tower\n\nHouse-Museum Dr. Anastácio Gonçalves\n\nNational Palace of Mafra, Mafra\n\nNational Museum of Music, Mafra\n\nIt’s important to note that this free access applies only to heritage sites managed by the central state. Many other museums and monuments, particularly those under municipal management, such as those overseen by Lisbon Cultura, have their own rules and tariffs. Lisbon Cultura, for example, offers free access through the Culture Pass for young people up to 23 years old and seniors over 65.\n\nWhen You Can Visit Sintra for Free\n\nResidents of Portugal will continue to enjoy free access to parks and monuments managed by Parques de Sintra on Sundays and holidays. To take advantage of this offer, visitors must present their citizen or resident card at the monument’s ticket office on the day of their visit. Parques de Sintra oversees the following sites:\n\nPena National Palace\n\nThe Moorish Castle\n\nNational Palace of Sintra\n\nMonserrate Palace\n\nCapuchos Convent\n\nQueluz National Palace\n\nChalet and Garden of the Countess of Edla\n\nVilla Sassetti\n\nCabo da Roca Lighthouse\n\nOther Sites You Can Now Visit for Free\n\nConvent of Christ in Tomar\n\nSagres Fortress in Vila do Bispo\n\nMonastery of Alcobaça in Alcobaça\n\nBatalha Monastery (Monastery of Santa Maria da Vitória) in Batalha\n\nMuseum of Alberto Sampaio and extension at the Palacete de Santiago in Guimarães\n\nMuseum of Lamego in Lamego\n\nJosé Malhoa Museum in Caldas da Rainha\n\nMuseum of Ceramics in Caldas da Rainha\n\nNational Museum of Resistance and Freedom in Peniche\n\nNational Museum of Conímbriga in Condeixa-a-Velha\n\nNational Museum of Machado de Castro in Coimbra\n\nNational Museum of Soares dos Reis and Casa-Museum Fernando de Castro in Porto\n\nFrei Manuel do Cenáculo National Museum and Mercês Church in Évora\n\nGrão Vasco National Museum in Viseu\n\nThe Queen D Museum. Leonor and extension in the Church of Santo Amaro in Beja\n\nPaço dos Duques, Guimarães Castle, and Church of São Miguel do Castelo in Guimarães\n\nThe Museum D. Diogo de Sousa in Braga\n\nMuseum of Biscainhos in Braga\n\nMuseum of Terra de Miranda in Miranda Douro\n\nAbbot of Baçal Museum in Bragança\n\nMuseum Dr. Joaquim Manso in Nazaré\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe new Portugese government emphasized that free access is a cornerstone of the government’s cultural program. The goal is to increase the number of visits and allow wider access to Portugal’s cultural sites. While there are concerns about potential loss in revenue, the expectation is that the increase in tourists will help balance out the cutural investments. Citizens and residents of Portugal, we hope that you enjoy wider access to these incredible cultural sites. Now that you can visit for free, which museum are you going to visit first?\n\nPortugal – land of fine wines, golden beaches, and a rich history that stretches to the ends of time. However, there is a deeper layer, long before the Moors and the Romans. We’re talking about Portugal’s Celtic roots, a heritage often obscured by the civilizations that followed, but still vibrant in the hills and valleys of our country.\n\nThe Celts, a group of warrior and spiritual tribes, spread across much of Europe during the Iron Age, notably in the first millennium BC. Their presence in Portugal is marked by fortifications, monuments, and rituals that still intrigue and fascinate today. To feel the true essence of this heritage, you need to venture beyond the usual tourist routes and immerse yourself in the places where Celtic ruins still remain.\n\nCastro de São Lourenço\n\nLet’s start our journey in the north, at the São Lourenço hillfort. Located in the parish of Vila Chã, in Esposende, this is one of the best-preserved hillforts in the country. Its walls and circular stone houses speak of a time when the community lived in harmony with nature but was also under constant threat of invasion. Walking along the winding paths that lead to the top of the hill, it is easy to imagine the Celtic warriors watching over the valleys below, always ready to defend their territory.\n\nThe view from the summit is breathtaking, a reward for those who dare to explore its heights. The stones that form the houses and walls tell stories of lives lived in times of uncertainty and courage. The site is also the scene of historical re-enactments and cultural events that aim to bring ancient times to life.\n\nCitânia de Briteiros\n\nNot far away, in Guimarães, we find Citânia de Briteiros, one of Portugal’s most impressive archaeological sites. This large Celtic settlement was excavated at the end of the 19th century by Francisco Martins Sarmento and revealed a complex network of streets, houses, and community buildings. The stones engraved with enigmatic symbols and the communal hot springs reveal an advanced and spiritual civilization. Here, you can imagine the rituals that united the community.\n\nThe local museum complements the visit, offering artifacts and information that put the daily life of the ancient Celts into context. The thermal baths, in particular, are a fascinating window into the hygiene and social practices of the period.\n\nCastro de Santa Trega\n\nWe continue northwest, on the border with Galicia, where the Castro de Santa Trega (or Santa Tecla) stands imposingly over the River Miño (also known as the River Minho). Although it is technically in Spanish territory, its proximity and historical importance make it an essential stop for understanding the Celtic influence on the Iberian Peninsula. This huge settlement offers breathtaking views and a palpable sense of history. The remains of the houses and walls are complemented by a series of museums and exhibitions that bring Celtic life to the fore.\n\nThe climb up the hill is an experience in itself, with winding paths taking visitors through breathtaking scenery. At the top, the ruins offer a clear view of the social and architectural organization of the Celts. The panoramic view of the River Miño and the Atlantic is breathtaking, providing a sense of connection with the ancient inhabitants who also contemplated these same landscapes.\n\nSete Cidades\n\nIn the heart of the Alentejo, we find the Sete Cidades settlement, one of Portugal’s oldest and most mysterious hill forts. Located near Viana do Alentejo, this archaeological site dates back to the Iron Age and is shrouded in legend and mystery. The partially excavated ruins suggest a robust Celtic community that prospered thanks to agriculture and trade. The remains of fortifications and dwellings demonstrate the ingenuity and resilience of this ancient people.\n\nThe Alentejo, with its vast landscapes and open skies, provides a unique setting for exploring Celtic ruins. The tranquillity of the place allows for deep reflection on life in ancient times, and the lack of tourists makes the experience even more authentic. The local legends, passed down from generation to generation, add a touch of mystery and fascination to the place.\n\nMoorish Castle\n\nAlthough the name suggests a different origin, the Moorish Castle in Sintra actually has roots dating back to Celtic times. Situated on top of a green hill, this castle offers breathtaking panoramic views and an aura of mystery. Before the Moors arrived and built the castle, the site was sacred to the Celts, who erected a strategic fort there. The ancient energies can still be felt as you walk along the ramparts and contemplate the vast landscape below.\n\nSintra, with its peculiar microclimate and enchanting landscapes, provides the perfect setting for exploring the ancient Celtic ruins. The castle, with its towers and imposing walls, evokes a sense of majesty. The trails that surround the site are ideal for hiking, offering an intimate connection with nature and history.\n\nCitânia de Sanfins\n\nIn the municipality of Paços de Ferreira is the Citânia de Sanfins, an important Celtic settlement that stands out for its complexity and preservation. The ruins of this settlement are vast and include walls, dwellings, and an acropolis. Excavations have revealed artifacts that offer a detailed insight into the life of the Celts, from domestic utensils to weapons and ornaments.\n\nThe Citânia de Sanfins is a site of great archaeological and historical interest. The adjoining museum displays many of the finds and offers an in-depth understanding of Celtic culture. Guided tours are recommended for those who want a more enriching experience, which allows for full immersion in the history and legends of the site.\n\nMonte Mozinho\n\nMonte Mozinho, also known as the “Dead City”, is one of the largest hillforts on the Iberian Peninsula. Located in the municipality of Penafiel, this archaeological site covers an extensive area and has a complex network of streets and buildings. Excavations have revealed an advanced social structure, with well-defined residential, commercial, and religious areas.\n\nExploring Monte Mozinho is a unique experience, with its ruins offering a clear view of life in Celtic times. The site is surrounded by beautiful natural landscapes, which provides a peaceful and picturesque environment. The well-marked trails make it easy to explore, and the presence of information panels helps to put the historical importance of the site into context.\n\nCitânia de Santa Luzia\n\nIn Viana do Castelo, the Citânia de Santa Luzia is another fascinating example of a Celtic fort. Located on top of a hill, it offers panoramic views over the surrounding region. The ruins include walls, dwellings and communal areas, showing a well-structured social organization.\n\nThe site is easily accessible and popular with visitors looking for an enriching historical experience. The ruins are well preserved, and it’s easy to explore at your own pace. The proximity to other tourist attractions in Viana do Castelo makes it an ideal destination for a day trip.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBeyond the physical ruins, the Celtic influence persists in Portuguese traditions and customs. Festivals and rituals, such as the São João Festival in Porto and the celebration of the Summer Solstice, have deep roots in ancient Celtic rites that celebrated fertility, the harvest, and the eternal cycle of nature. The circle dances, bonfires, and offerings are an echo of times gone by, a living link to our ancestral past.\n\nThese traditions are particularly evident in rural regions, where ancient customs are fervently maintained. Folk music and dances often incorporate elements dating back to Celtic practices, which create a tangible connection between the present and the past. Taking part in these celebrations is a way of experiencing the living heritage of the Celts in Portugal.\n\nThe preservation of Celtic ruins in Portugal is an ongoing challenge. Modernization and development threaten many of these ancient sites, but there is a growing effort to protect and promote this heritage. Archaeological and cultural organizations are working to ensure that these relics are not only monuments of the past, but also sources of inspiration and knowledge for future generations.\n\nCalouste Sarkis Gulbenkian was one of the wealthiest men of the early 20th century and moved to Portugal during the middle of World War II. When he died in 1955, he left nearly his entire fortune to a foundation to be headquartered under his name in Lisbon. Here are nine incredible facts about this one-of-a-kind individual whose foundation continues to fund arts and culture to this day in Portugal.\n\n1. Gulbenkian was born into a successful Armenian family.\n\nCalouste Sarkis Gulbenkian was born on March 23, 1869, in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) to an Armenian family. His father and uncle ran an import/export business trading carpets, wool, and kerosene from the Caucasus. By the time Calouste was 23, the family business had joined a network of family-based trading partnerships across the Ottoman Empire. Even before Calouste was born, the family supported the construction of schools, churches, and hospitals.\n\n2. Calouste Gulbenkian bridged East and West through his business.\n\nGulbenkian was highly educated. He studied engineering at King’s College London, graduating in 1887, and later pursued further studies in petroleum engineering in Baku, Azerbaijan, one of the early centers of the oil industry. His fluency in Armenian, French, and English helped him in his negotiations with diplomats around the world.\n\n3. He realized the potential of oil in the Middle East early on.\n\nGulbenkian played a crucial role in the development of the Middle Eastern oil industry. He brokered the landmark 1907 agreement that led to the formation of the Royal Dutch Shell company, becoming one of the first to realize the vast potential of Middle Eastern oil reserves. Gulbenkian was the driving force behind the creation of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) in 1912, which was a consortium of the largest European oil companies aiming to gain the rights for oil exploration and development of the Ottoman Territory of Mesopotamia.\n\n4. His nickname is “ Five Percent.”\n\nGulbenkian earned his nickname, “Mr. Five Percent,” by securing a 5% share in almost all major oil companies in the Middle East, including the Turkish Petroleum Company. This strategic move made him an immensely wealthy man and a key player in the global oil market. He famously stated, “”Better a small piece of a big pie, than a big piece of a small one.”\n\n5. He had one of the most impressive art collections in the world.\n\nGulbenkian was an avid art collector. His collection included over 6,000 works by Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, and Degas, among others. Today, his extensive art collection is housed in the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, which attracts art enthusiasts from around the world. We recommend that you visit just for the René Lalique collection alone.\n\n6. He was truly a citizen of the world.\n\nThroughout his life, Gulbenkian lived in multiple countries, including Turkey, France, the United Kingdom, and Portugal. His cosmopolitan lifestyle and ability to adapt to different cultures contributed to his success as an international businessman.\n\n7. He had diplomatic and negotiation skills like no other.\n\nGulbenkian’s negotiations and diplomatic skills were legendary. He was able to navigate the complex political and economic landscapes of his time, forging partnerships and agreements that benefited all parties involved. He became the financial and economic adviser to the Turkish embassies in London and Paris, and later, chief financial adviser to the Turkish government and a director of the National Bank of Turkey.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire was being dismantled, Gulbenkian was right at the center of negotiations for which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. As part of the deal, Gulbenkian secured 5% rights for himself.\n\n8. Once he moved to Portugal, he never left again.\n\nIn 1942, in the middle of World War II, Gulbenkian fled from France to Portugal, where he lived in a luxurious suite in the Aziz Hotel in Lisbon until his death in 1955. He became a naturalized Portuguese citizen and later received the Grand Cross of the Order of Christ from the Portuguese government for his services to the country.\n\n9. Upon his death, he left most of his fortune to Portugal\n\nWhen Gulbenkian died, his fortune was estimated to be between US$280 million and US$840 million. In his will, he left his art collection and the majority of his fortune to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which was mandated to be set up after his death and be dedicated to the promotion of the arts, philanthropy, science, and education.\n\nToday, it is one of the wealthiest charitable foundations in the world and hosts numerous initiatives and institutions and initiatives including the Gulbenkian Commission, the Gulbenkian Science Institute, the Gulbenkian Prizes, and the Gulbenkian Orchestra, which is next to the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon.\n\nNever forgetting his Armenian legacy, Gulbenkian gave back to Armenian communities worldwide throughout his life. The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation’s Armenian Communities Department distributes scholarships to Armenian students pursuing their education all over the world. The Foundation also supports the preservation of the Armenian language as well as Armenian societies and culture.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCalouste Gulbenkian played a pivotal role in the 20th century through his work in the oil industry. His life was marked by keen business acumen, philanthropy, and a passion for art and culture. Without the German invasion of France in WWII and Portugal’s neutrality, the Gulbenkian name would likely never have become part of Portuguese history. Today, it is an indelible part of Portugal’s legacy\n\nPortugal’s history as an official country stretches back almost 900 years, and a study in 2020 revealed that modern humans settled in what is now central Portugal as far back as 41,000 years ago! This long history resulted in entrenched agricultural methods with food preparation passing from generation to generation and perfecting the art of certain practices over time. Portugal’s most famous food – the pastel de nata – was created before the 18th century by Catholic monks in Lisbon’s Jerónimos Monastery. As of 2021, Portugal had 94 food and drink products granted a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Let’s look at 9 of the best Portuguese foods and dishes with PDO status that are still under the radar compared to bacalhau and francesinha. You may want to take some home with you on your next trip to Portugal!\n\n1. Ameixa d’Elvas (Elvas Plums)\n\nThe Ameixa d’Elvas is a green, oval-shaped plum known locally as Abrunho. It is believed that it came from France and has been popular since the time of Prince Alphonse Henry, the first king of Portugal. In 1834, José Guerra began to grow these plums on a large scale. Ameixa plums won a bronze medal at the 1855 Paris Exhibition, and, by 1875, they started being exported around the world. In just under 150 years, the Elvas plums have received 203 international and national prizes. Give them a try on your next trip to Portugal and then bring some jarred plums home with you!\n\n2. Azeite de Moura (Moura Olive Oil)\n\n“Azeite de Moura” is a distinguished extra-virgin and virgin olive oil produced from Galega, Verdeal, and Cordovil olives. This oil is characterized by its unique chemical and sensory properties. The composition includes up to 20% Verdeal, a minimum of 35-40% Cordovil, and the remainder Galega.\n\nHarvested at full ripeness, the olives are processed within 48 hours to maintain quality. The oil is yellow-green with a fruity aroma and rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. Produced in Moura and surrounding areas, the region’s Mediterranean climate and soil create a distinct olive oil, which has been celebrated since Roman times.\n\n3. Castanha da Terra Fria\n\nCastanha da Terra Fria PDO refers to the chestnuts of Castanea sativa Mill, including varieties such as Longal, Judia, Côta, Amarelal, and others. Each batch contains 85% of one variety, with the rest comprising other listed varieties. These chestnuts can be pounded, frozen, candied, or preserved in syrup under the PDO designation.\n\nThe chestnuts are harvested by hand from the ground to ensure complete maturation, with no mechanical methods used. They are characterized by their elongated elliptical shape, reddish-brown shiny color, and long dark lines. With 70 to 95 nuts per kilogram, these chestnuts are known for their intense flavor. Production is limited to specific parishes in Vila Real and Bragança.\n\nThe Castanha da Terra Fria PDO has deep historical roots in its region, and they were vital for the survival of local rural communities. The chestnut tree was crucial for nourishment in Roman times, long before the introduction of potatoes to Portugal in 1789.\n\n4. Manteiga dos Açores (Azorean Butter)\n\n“Manteiga dos Açores” is butter made exclusively from pasteurized cow’s milk cream from the Azores, without lactic fermentation, food coloring, or preservatives. It boasts an intense color, aroma, and fresh taste due to its high betacarotene content. The butter’s unique qualities stem from cows grazing year-round on Azorean pastures. Produced and packaged in the Azores, this butter has been popular since the 16th century. By 1896, Azorean butter was already a commercial success, with a good amount of sales by the Leopoldina dairy factory.\n\n5. Mel da Serra de Monchique (Honey from Serra de Monchique)\n\nThe Mel da Serra de Monchique PDO is a honey produced by Apis mellifera Iberica bees, sourced from the nectar of local flowers such as lavender, heather, eucalyptus, orange blossom, and medronho (the strawberry tree). This honey, characterized by its dark yellow color and delicate flavor, is rich in natural mineral salts and features a slight bitter aftertaste from the medronho pollen.\n\nProduced without artificial feeding, the honey is harvested between May and July and purified through filtering and centrifugation. This process ensures that Mel da Serra de Monchique PDO retains its unique qualities. Beekeeping in this region dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries when it was a primary income source. It was introduced and promoted by the Romans in the Algarve.\n\n6. Pêra Rocha do Oeste (Rocha Pear of the West)\n\nPera Rocha do Oeste is a pear variety, Pyrus communis L., originating from the Rocha variety in the Sintra commune around 150 years ago. This Portuguese pear has white, sweet, non-acidic, juicy flesh with a soft texture and distinctive aroma. Cultivated in the west region, it thrives under specific local conditions and requires winter cold to develop properly.\n\nHarvested in late August, its production area includes Sintra and surrounding communes. The pear’s cultivation spread from a natural tree on Mr. Rocha’s farm and earned a recognition at the 1932 National Congress on Pomology.\n\n7. Sal de Tavira (Tavira Salt)\n\nSal de Tavira / Flor de Sal de Tavira PDO is a manually harvested sea salt from the Tavira salterns in the Atlantic Ocean. This unrefined, additive-free salt is available as Sal de Tavira PDO, which forms breakable cubic crystals, or as Flor de Sal de Tavira, which consists of fine, alternating layers that easily disintegrate into fine crystals.\n\nThe production involves three areas: storage for water and impurity decanting, evaporation for salt concentration, and crystallization for manual salt collection. Rich in sodium chloride, iodine, and oligoelements, this salt is harvested without washing or additives. Tavira’s salt production dates back to at least the 4th century BC, and it was integral to food preservation and fishery activities. Despite industrial declines, traditional salt production methods have been preserved through generations.\n\n8. Queijo Serra da Estrela (Serra da Estrela Cheese)\n\nQueijo Serra da Estrela PDO cheese is crafted from the milk of Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira sheep. It is a cured cheese, available in two forms: the semi-soft, white-yellowish Queijo Serra da Estrela, and the semi-hard to extra-hard, brownish-orange Queijo Serra da Estrela Velho. The cheese is renowned for its delicate, clean, slightly acidic flavor and pleasant, persistent, slightly spicy taste. It is the oldest Portuguese cheese recognized internationally for its taste and quality.\n\nThe production process begins with sheep milking, followed by milk filtration, heating, and salting. Thistle flower Cynara cardunculus is added to form curd, which is manually cut and filtered. After molding, pressing, and salting, the cheese undergoes two maturation phases, totaling up to 45 days for Queijo Serra da Estrela and 120 days for Queijo Serra da Estrela Velho. This cheese, deeply rooted in Serra da Estrela’s hills, has been internationally recognized since Roman times and mentioned in medieval literature. It reached Lisbon and Porto in 1885 and provided a nutritious food source for the great explorers on their voyages.\n\n9. Requeijão Serra da Estrela\n\nRequeijão Serra da Estrela PDO is a creamy, slightly lumpy cheese made from the whey of Serra da Estrela cheese. It uses raw milk from Bordaleira Serra da Estrela and Churra Mondegueira sheep, occasionally incorporating milk from Serrana or Jarmelista goats. Shaped like a rough cylinder and weighing 150 to 400 grams, this white cheese is consistent, easy to cut, and melts in the mouth with an agreeable taste and aroma. It received its DOP distinction in 2005.\n\nThe production involves heating the whey, sometimes with added sheep’s milk, to precipitate the proteins, forming ‘flakes’ that are skimmed or sieved. Traditionally collected in chestnut branch baskets, these flakes are now gathered in inert containers. Requeijão Serra da Estrela PDO is appreciated for its high protein and low-fat content and can be enjoyed alone or with various accompaniments. It is produced in several municipalities across the Viseu, Coimbra, Guarda, and Castelo Branco districts."
