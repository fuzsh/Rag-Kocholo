        "text": "A recipe for Waffle de Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread Waffles)! These cheese-based waffles come together quickly for a delicious, gluten-free breakfast or snack.\n\nDisclosure: This post contains Amazon affiliate links. If you purchase something through the link, I may receive a small commission at no extra charge to you.\n\nWaffle de Pão de Queijo are quite the fun variation of the Brazilian Pão de Queijo. Polvilho Azedo (sour manioc starch) is whisked together with milk, vegetable oil, egg, Minas cheese and Parmesan to create a thin batter, then heated in a waffle iron until golden and cooked through.\n\nThe resulting savory waffle has a fantastic chewy and stretchy texture with cheese in every bite. It is also naturally gluten-free.\n\nWe paired the Waffles de Pão de Queijo with Doce de Leite (Dulce de Leche, Chad’s favorite) and Requeijao (Brazilian Cream Cheese, my favorite). Other options include butter, Goiabada (guava paste), jam, maple syrup, or simply on their own.\n\nYou can even use them as the savory base for poached eggs and open-face sandwiches.\n\nA Few Tips\n\nThe batter should be thin enough with pieces of shredded cheese throughout to easily transfer to the heated waffle iron. If too thick to pour, add a little more milk.\n\nFor the mini waffle maker, I used a 1/4 cup (60 milliliter) scoop to transfer the batter. Larger waffle irons may require 1/3-1/2 cup (80-120 milliliters).\n\nGrease the waffle iron by brushing with vegetable oil between batches to prevent sticking and help create a golden, crispy exterior.\n\nThe texture is best warm from the waffle iron. Want to serve the waffles all at once? Preheat an oven to 250˚F (120˚C) and arrange the cooked waffles in a single layer on a baking sheet. Keep in the warm oven until all the batter is prepared.\n\nThe amount of waffles created will depend on the type of waffle iron. My parents gave me a mini waffle maker a few years ago and the kids enjoy the smaller size. This recipe makes about 10-12 miniature waffles, but closer to 6 standard sized.\n\nNotable Ingredients\n\nI used Polvilho Azedo (Brazilian sour manioc starch) as the base for the Waffle de Pão de Queijo. This starch is created by grinding and fermenting cassava root into a fine powder. It can be found in the baking/flour section of markets with Brazilian/Portuguese ingredients.\n\nIf unavailable, you can swap for tapioca starch (Polvilho Doce) in the gluten-free section of larger grocery stores. It will just have a slightly more dense texture. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid.\n\nQueijo Minas (Minas cheese) is a type of semi-soft white cheese from the Minas Gerais state in southeastern Brazil. It is made from cow’s milk and can be frescal (fresh), meia-cura (half-aged), or curado (aged) depending on length of ripening.\n\nIf unavailable, you can swap for queso fresco or low-moisture mozzarella.\n\nFor those in the DC area, I have been able to locate both the starch and cheese at European Foods Import Export in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nI also found the Requeijão at European Foods Import Export, but if unavailable Olivia’s Cuisine has a homemade recipe.\n\nThis recipe was originally posted on February 16th, 2015 and updated in November 2022.\n\nWaffle de Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread Waffles) Recipe"
