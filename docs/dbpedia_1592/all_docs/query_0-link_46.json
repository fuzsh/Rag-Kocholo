        "text": "Before I get going, I guess I should address the question of spelling. You know those super spicy peppers that make curries hot? Well there are a bunch of different spellings: chili, chile, chilli. According to Wikipedia, the word originates from the Nahuatl word “chīlli”, so I’m going with the chilli / chillies form.\n\nAnyway, a little while back, my friend Patrick from Como Sur put me on to a pretty cool article at the Saveur website – a Chilli Pepper Guide listing more than 40 varieties. It’s pretty cool, with nice pictures and descriptions, but I noticed that only a couple of Brazilian varieties were on the list. Well, in the interests of filling in the blanks, I thought I’d give you my thoughts on a few of those fiery beauties that grace the pimenta stalls of Rio’s street markets.\n\nPimenta Malagueta\n\nAccording to received wisdom, the Malagueta is Brazil’s hottest chilli (though see following entry). It is a favourite of bars and restaurants who make their own chilli oil. To make your own, take a handful of these little firebrands, trim off the stalks, then soak them in oil for a few days. The end result is a deliciously fragrant hot oil for drizzling over bolinhos de bacalhau, pasteis and other tasty Brazilian snacks. Heat scale: 9.5/10\n\nPimenta Coração de Galinha\n\nThese pretty chillies only recently started appearing in the street markets I visit. The market traders all call them coração de galinha (chicken hearts) and they do vaguely resemble their namesakes. During my most recent research trip, I picked a few of these up and took them home for a tasting/spice-level check. I cautiously cut one up, removed the seeds, cut a piece of flesh the size of a apple seed and gingerly placed it on my tongue.\n\nI made it across the kitchen, from the chopping board to the sink, in just under a second and managed to eject the piece of molten lava a few milliseconds later. It took my mouth about 20 minutes and 3 spoonfuls of requeijão to recover… I couldn’t say for sure, but I suspect these could be even hotter than Malaguetas. 9.5/10\n\nPimenta Cumari\n\nThese tiny yellow peppers look a lot like the Peruvian Aji Charapita peppers, but also resemble another type called Bode Amarela. Either way, these are also seriously hot (I gave it an 8/10 on my scale of how traumatic it was to touch a raw piece to my tongue. Not quite as bad as the Coração de Galinha, but still worthy of respect).\n\nPimenta Dedo de Moça\n\nThis translates as “Little girl’s fingers” – nice. These are great all-purpose chillies. I recently used them to make a sweet chilli jelly which goes very nicely with cheese and coldcuts. If you chop these fellows up and forget about it, you’ll have a nasty reminder later on. 7.5/10\n\nPimenta Pitanga\n\nAnother variety that I have only noticed recently in the markets. And finally I found a pepper which didn’t make me want to rip my own tongue out after a taste-test. I have these pretty peppers a 5/10 for heat and they had a nice flavour that would work well in a salad dressing or salsa. They call them pitanga because they resemble the fruit of the same name. 5/10\n\nPimenta de Cheiro\n\nAccoding to my market traders, the ‘Fragrant Chilli’ comes in two forms, one spicier than the other. Looking at them, I don’t really believe that they are the same pepper – they look completely different – but the vendors call both peppers Pimenta de Cheiro, so I’ll list them together. The plumper, yellow peppers (on the right below) often have some pretty decent heat (6/10), the green, crinkly ones have almost no heat at all (2/10). The green ones are also popular in Baiana and Nordestina cuisine. Both have a lovely floral flavour.\n\nPimenta Cambuci\n\nAlso known as Chapeu de Frade or Chapeu de Bispo (Nun or Bishop’s hat), we are now entering the safe zone. These big, interestingly shaped peppers have a fresh flavour, crunchy, juicy texture and just pedestrian levels of spice. 1/10\n\nPimenta Biquinho\n\nI think of this one as the gateway chilli – start your kids on these before they move up to more serious peppers. These sweet chillies with their cute little beaks are full of fresh chilli flavour but have no heat whatsoever. Pick up a jar of pickled biquinhos and serve as a snack alongside olives and nuts at your next party. 0/10\n\nSo there you have it – a mini-guide to the chillies you’ll find in Rio’s street markets. I think that has gotten all the chilli nerdery out of my system for another 6 months. Let me know if I’ve missed any varieties."
