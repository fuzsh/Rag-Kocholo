        "text": "List of cheeses by place of origin\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of cheeses by place of origin. Cheese is a milk-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.\n\nHerbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is normally formed from adding annatto. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as queso blanco in Latin America.\n\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into existence.[1]\n\nIn this list, types of cheeses are included; brand names are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese.\n\nAfrica\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: African cuisine\n\nBenin\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Benin cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Wagasi Northern Benin A soft cow's milk cheese commonly made by the Fulani people that is sold in many units in Parakou, a city in Central Benin.[2]\n\nEthiopia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ethiopian cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Ayibe A local cheese that is mild and crumbly.[3][4] It has little flavor on its own, and is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food.\n\nMauritania\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Mauritanian cuisine\n\nName Image Region Description Caravane cheese The brand name of a camel milk cheese produced in Mauritania by Tiviski,[5] a company founded by Nancy Abeiderrhamane in 1987.

This is a cow milk cheese exclusive to the Central North region, more specifically, around Kolašin town. This is due to the specific composition of flora that free-ranging cows feed upon on the upland pastures, as well as to the microclimatic conditions of the locality. The attempts to make this cheese elsewhere following the same recipe have failed. The producers from this region are proud of their cheese, and for years have been trying to initialize the procedure for the protection of geographic origin.\n\nThis cheese is very valued as a delicacy in whole of Montenegro, and it is one of the most expensive fresh cheeses on the national market. The name of this cheese is derived from its specific texture. Thin, sometimes almost transparent, layers create a leafy structure, and make strings when the cheese is pulled apart. It has a pleasant mild fragrance. It does not contain high levels of fat, so its taste is mild and light.All producers make it in a similar manner, although every family has their own small secret that distinguishes their cheese, of which they are rather protective. What is known is that this cheese is made by combining the skimmed and whole cow milk. After adding the rennet, which makes milk curd, the cheese is drained and then frequently turned and folded. It is this manipulation that creates thin layers – leaves – that give it a characteristic texture.\n\nPljevaljski sir[57] A type of best semisoft cheese made of cow milk, produced in Northern Montenegro town of Pljevlja.
