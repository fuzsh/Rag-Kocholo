        "text": "The structure development of a soft cheese curd model has been studied in relationship to its rheological properties and its biochemical characteristics (pH, amount and partition of minerals, casein proteolysis) at different technical steps including cutting, drawing, three turns and demoulding. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe structural changes during the drainage of a fat-free soft cheese. The micrographs provided visual evidence of changes in the casein matrix from casein particles aggregated in clusters to uniform strands observed at the demoulding. The initial increase of loss tangent and of the exponent of the power law between G&#39; and G&quot; and frequency (that were maximal at the second turn) was related to the solubilization of micellar calcium phosphate, while intact caseins and large casein fragments accumulated in the curd. After the second turn, the strength, Youngs&#39; and loss moduli of the curd increased greatly. The hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-case...\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate proteolysis development and peptide changes during the storage period of Beyaz (White) cheese which is produced from various types of milk, such as sheep, goat and cow milk. Three types of cheese were produced using goat, sheep and cow milk, and all analyses were performed in duplicate. Proteolytic changes were observed in cheese on the 1 st day, 3 rd , 6 th , and 9 th month. The total protein was investigated through using water-soluble nitrogen, soluble nitrogen in 12% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), soluble nitrogen in 5% Phosphotungstic acid (PTA), and free amino acids. Proteolytic changes and peptide formations were observed during maturation by HPLC. While the total protein was 14.33% in sheep Beyaz cheese on the 1 st day, this value decreased during the maturation period and reduced to 6.9% in the 9 th month. These values were 13.55 and 7.95 for cow cheese and 16.30% and 7.95% for goat cheese, respectively. The water-soluble protein value increased during the maturation period. The value was 1.41% in sheep cheese on the 1 st day, and increased to 6.24% in the 9 th month. These values were 2.16% and 4.92% for goat cheese, and 1.79% and 8.53% for cow cheese, respectively. 12% TCA soluble nitrogen had been 0.211% at the beginning and was 0.51% in the 9 th month. The ripening value based on 12% TCA changed between 9.41%-47.22%. 5% PTA soluble nitrogen changed between 0.075%-0.25 %. The ripening value based on 5% PTA changed between 3.34-23.14. Changes in concentration of total free amino acids during cheese ripening were tracked. In water soluble extracts of cheese, the presence of free amino groups in all ripening stages was detected. It is observed that amino acids and smaller peptides-have concentration significantly (P<0.05) increased during ripening. The total free amino acid was found as 0.24 mg lysine g-1 in sheep cheese, 0.215 mg lysine g-1 in goat cheese and 0.208 mg lysine g-1 in cow cheese at the end of ripening period.\n\nThe effect of homogenization and fat reduction in combination with variable heating conditions of cow milk on the characteristics of Quark-type cheese were investigated. The mean composition of full-fat cheeses was 71.96% moisture, 13.95% fat, and 10.31% protein, and that of its reduced-fat counterparts was 73.08%, 10.39%, and 12.84%, respectively. The increase of heat treatment intensity increased moisture retention and improved the mean cheese protein-to-fat ratio from 0.92 to 1. Homogenization increased the moisture and protein retention in cheese, but the effect was less intense for milk treated at 90 °C for 5 min. The extended denaturation of whey proteins resulted in harder, springier, and less cohesive cheese (p &lt; 0.05). Treatment of milk at 90 °C for 5 min resulted in higher residual lactose and citric acid and lower water-soluble nitrogen contents of cheese (p &lt; 0.05); the latter was also true for homogenization (p &lt; 0.05). Storage did not affect the composition an..."
