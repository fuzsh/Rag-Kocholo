        "text": "The objective of this study was to assay the bacterial status and nutritional-cum sensory properties of West African Soft Cheese treated with 3 levels (1%, 2% & 3%) of ethanol and ether extracts of Moringa oleifera leaf, using a 2*4 factorial design. The results indicated that 2% and 3% moringa leaf ethanol extract had the highest inhibitory potential against bacteria population (p<0.05). The proximate analysis revealed that 1% ethanol extract-treated samples had the highest levels of crude protein and ash while the control cheese had significantly higher moisture and fat content (p<0.05). Sensory analysis of the various samples revealed that analysts preferred the cheese preserved with 3 % ethanol extract. It can thus be concluded that the use of ethanol extract of moringa leaf as a Cheese preservative leads to improved microbial stability and nutritional quality, as well as higher sensory acceptability.\n\nVariability of quality of product makes cottage cheese production unattractive to urban populations. Meanwhile demand for value-added dairy products is on the increase in the urban areas. This study investigated the effect of moringa seed extract (0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%) supplementation on the yield and quality of cottage cheese prepared from fresh cow milk coagulated with latex from Callotropis procera. Yield, milk coagulation time, pH, moisture content, percentage protein, percentage fat, phosphorous and ash content of cottage cheese were determined. The pH of cottage cheese increased with increase in moringa seed extract. The control sample gave a pH of 6.52, whiles 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% concentrations of moringa seed extract gave pH values of 6.54, 6.55, 6.56 and 6.62 respectively and their difference were significant (p&lt;0.05). Yield of cottage cheese also increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) with increase in concentration of moringa seed extract. The 500mls of milk yielded 18....\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Moringa oleifera and Pure honey in improving the shelf life of cheese. The cheese samples were purchased from a local market in Ilorin, Nigeria and treated with Moringa oleifera oil (Treatment B), Pure natural honey (Treatment C) while cheese kept in the whey was the Control (Treatment A, without any treatment). The changes in the chemical composition (crude protein, dry matter, ash and ether extract), sensory qualities and microbial count (total viable count, characterization and identification of microbes) were examined for 28 days. After the third day, the cheese sample kept in the whey (Control) had fermented and in about fourth and fifth days gave an offensive odour compared to other Treatments (B and C). The result revealed a significant difference in the chemical composition between the Control and other Treatments (B and C). The flavour and texture were significantly higher for the biological treated samples (Treatments B and C) compared to the Control (Treatment A). The taste and texture were greater in Treatment C compared to Treatments B and A which are similar (p>0.05). The flavour was offensive and overall acceptability was poor in the Control (Treatment A) while the best flavour and overall acceptability was noted in Treatment C. It is enough to note that the flavour of Treatment B was similar to that of C (p>0.05). The total viable count was higher in the control (A) compared to that of B and C due to the spoilage of the sample after the third day. It can be concluded from this study that treatment of West African soft cheese sample with Moringa oleifera oil and pure natural honey had no negative effect on all the parameters evaluated hence, the simple technique should be encouraged so as to enhance the nutritional value and improve the shelf life of soft cheese\n\n3 Abstract: Dry leaves of Moringa oleifera (DLMO) were added to Labneh cheese at concentration 1, 2, or 3%. Subsequently, the chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties of Labneh cheese during storage 3 weeks at 5±1°C were determined. Nutritional and biological values of Labneh were evaluated when fresh. Addition of DLMO had considerable effect on Total Solid (TS), protein, acidity, carbohydrate and ash. The highest values were recorded with Labneh fortified with DLMO (innovative Labneh). The addition of DLMO had a significant effect on carbohydrate. Acidity increased gradually for all treatments during storage. The highest values were obtained with Labneh fortified with DLMO. Labneh fortified with DLMO can be considered as a good source of minerals (Ca, Fe, Zn and Si) and vitamins (A, B1, B2 and E). The results indicated that total counts were higher in Labneh fortified with DLMO. Yeast & mould and coliform bacteria were not detected in Labneh fortified with DLMO when fr...\n\nThis study was carried out in the milk processing units at College of Animal Production Science and Technology, Sudan University of Sciences during September 2014-January 2015. The chemical and sensory characteristics of Sudanese low-fat cheese were investigated as affected by different levels of gum Arabic and storage period. Three hundred and fifty liters (350) of standardized milk with (3%, 2.5% and 2%) of fat were prepared after purchase full cream milk from a private farm at Al Haj Yousif, Khartoum North. Seven treatments were carried out as follows: First treatment is the control in which cheese milk had no additive (3%) of fat. In the second and third with 3% of fat, fourth and fifth with 2.5% of fat and sixth and seventh with 2% of fat, 0.5 and 0.75% of gum Arabic were added respectively to cheese milk before pasteurization then low-fat cheese was made and stored at refrigerator (4°C) for 120 days. Physicochemical and sensory evaluation was done for the cheese samples at day zero, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days intervals. The cheese statistical analysis obtained that gum Arabic significantly (P< 0.05) affected the chemical composition of the cheese. The results also showed that crude protein fat, total solids, pH, volatile fatty acid and ash were significantly (P< 0.05) affected by both levels of gum Arabic and storage period. The results obtained there were significantly differences (P<0.05) between control cheese and the other with 0.5 and 0.75 gum Arabic respectively in all parameters.\n\nIndia stands number one position in milk production of 165.4 million MT/ annum in 2016-17 (Anonymous, 2017). Dairy farmers can add value to their milk by processing and marketing their own products, such as cheese, yogurt, butter, ice cream, and farm-bottled milk. Many consumers are willing to pay a premium for locally produced, high-quality, farmstead dairy products and may further enhance the market potential. A trend has been observed amongst customers towards minimally processed, highly nutritious, health promoting and flavour enriched food (Mitra and Ghosh, 2017). Fermentation is the oldest and most economical method in food preservation and value addition to milk. Fermented milk provides all the milk components modified through the process of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. The conversion of part of lactose to lactic acid during fermentation, destabilize the casein by lowering the pH and their by enhance the International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Scien..."
