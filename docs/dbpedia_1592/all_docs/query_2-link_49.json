        "text": "Sniff, sniff.\n\nShog's nose wrinkled. The unthinkable had happened. Someone - and he knew exactly who it was - had just cut the cheese1.\n\nHe had been calmly sitting in his office, working - the folks over at Cooking.SE were having a bit of a salty2 discussion on meta - when someone in the office had released a foul, lingering odor.\n\nAnd since he worked from home, it was of course him.\n\nWith the smell grating3 on his nerves, Shog decided to take the prudent course of action and exit the room, at least until the pungent smell had dissipated. I'll just go get a snack, he decided.\n\nHe opened the door of his office and walked down to his kitchen.\n\n\"Pickles...\" he said, scanning the shelves. \"No. Appear to be out.\"\n\nHe glanced over at where he usually kept his baking experiments. Unfortunately, mold appeared to be well on its way towards gaining sentience there.\n\nHis tomato patch was still unripe.\n\nOpening the fridge was a slight improvement. Here there was half a watermelon rind4, a few slices of pizza, and... a rotten orange, emitting malodorous fumes. In his fridge. It seemed like Shog's nose was in for a rough day.\n\nHe sigh and decided to just grab the pizza. He pulled it out, walked over to the microwave, and was about to pop a slice in when he heard a sound behind him. His back stiffened. Slowly, he wheel5ed around.\n\nA heavy weight struck his head, and Shog knew no more.\n\nCatija6 watched as her toddler, screaming, lay on the floor, beating his fists on the rug. Having a temper tantrum. Naturally. She couldn't wait until he matured7 a little.\n\n\"It's okay, Ben!\" she said, trying to calm him down. \"I'll only be out for a few hours. Your father will be here soon.\"\n\nShe turned to the babysitter, who was eyeing the kid on the floor warily. \"I'm sorry... he's not usually like this,\" she told her, frowning. \"I don't know why he's having a melt8down now.\"\n\nThe teenager gave a nervous grin, flashing braces.\n\n\"It's okay, ma'am, hopefully I can handle it.\"\n\n\"You have my phone number?\" Catija asked.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" the sitter confirmed.\n\n\"Good. I shouldn't be back later than 11, and Andy should be here by 5. His bedtime is 7:30.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" the girl said, making a note on her large purple phone.\n\nCatija took one last look at the screaming child on the floor, picked up her bag, and walked out, closing the door behind her.\n\nIt was a warm day for the fall... but then again, it was Texas.\n\nAs Catija walked down the street, a taxi pulled up next to her. The window rolled down.\n\n\"Need a ride, ma'am?\" the driver asked, his face obscured by a large pair of sunglasses.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" she started to decline. But before she could finish, a chemical-doused rag was thrust out the window, and her sight faded to black.\n\nThe man in black paced around the room. The Swiss9 gentleman had just been informed that the capture of the man known as Shog9 and the woman known as Catija had been smoothly executed, and that the pair was now being held. The team he had sent had done a gouda10 job.\n\nNow he could finally execute the next stage of the plan. He smiled as he dialed the phone.\n\nPizza. Everything was black. Microwave. Headache.\n\nShog groggily opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor in a dark room.\n\nHe sat up, rubbing his eyes. There was a large lump on the back of his head, probably because the head in question had recently had a slight disagreement with a heavy object.\n\nAs his eyes adjusted to the gloom, he could start to make out several things about his surroundings.\n\nhe was not alone\n\nOn the other side of the room, still out cold, was his new colleague, Catija. Apart from her, though, there was nobody in the room that he could see.\n\nhe was apparently in a cheese factory\n\nAll around him were refrigerators, filled with cheese wheels, still aging. There was also a table stacked with what appeared to be containers of shredded cheese.\n\nOdd, he thought. Why would cheese be left out like that?\n\nNot in a fridge it would spoil. Unless...\n\nHe crossed the room, heading over to the table to look more closely at these containers. As he passed by her, Catija started to stir. \"Wh- what...\" she mumbled. Her eyes shot open.\n\nShe took a minute to look around her. She was in a small room that was reminiscent of a storage facility. There was large refrigerators around her. And her co-worker Shog - with a rather large lump on his head - standing next to a table, holding a container of shredded cheese.\n\n\"I'm thinking this might not actually be cheese.\"\n\nCaught off guard, Catija turned her head to look at Shog. \"What?\"\n\n\"This might not be cheese,\" he repeated. \"Look. It's not in the fridge, and it doesn't really look like cheese.\"\n\nShe walked over to look. He was right. The \"cheese\" was too white, thin, and long to be cheese. It looked more like strips of paper.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said. \"It looks like... shredded11 paper.\"\n\nBefore he could respond, she popped open the container and grabbed what was in there. Paper.\n\nShe upended the container onto the table. Pieces of paper fluttered down to land in a messy pile.\n\n\"It looks like... a puzzle,\" Shog realized. And without needing further discussion, they set to reconstructing the puzzle.\n\nWhen they had finished, things weren't exactly clearer.\n\nTHE NAME OF THIS SEMI-HARD, PALE YELLOW CHEESE IS FORMED OF TWO PARTS. ONE IS THE STAGE OF A CELESTIAL OBJECT. THE OTHER IS A GEOGRAPHIC OBJECT NEAR A BODY OF WATER.\n\n_ _ _ _-_ _ _ _ | _ _ _\n\nTHIS AUSTRIAN, SEMI-HARD CHEESE HAS A TWO-WORD NAME. THE FIRST IS A RELATED TO AN IMMENSE GEOGRAPHICAL PHENOMENON. THE SECOND IS RELATED TO LUKE SKYWALKER.\n\n_ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _\n\nDETESTED BY MANY, THIS CHEESE IS AMONG THE OLDEST ON THE PLANET, AND, IN THE UNITED STATES, WAS OFTEN ILLEGALLY REPLACED BY WOOD.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nTHE INFAMOUS CHEESE CASU MARZU - MADE USING MAGGOTS - COMES FROM THIS MEH ITALIAN CHEESE.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nTHIS CHEESE'S FIRST NAME MAY BE SIMILAR TO A NEW STATE IN THE US AND THE HOME OF BILBO BAGGINS, BUT IT'S ALSO THE NAME OF A DOG (AND THE NAME OF AN ENGLISH PLACE). THE SECOND MAY BE SAD, BUT IT'S ALSO FUNKY AND SKY-HIGH.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _\n\nWHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE.\n\nTHIS IVORY-COLORED CHEESE MAY NOT REQUIRE TWO, BUT THE DANCE IT SHARES A NAME WITH CERTAINLY DOES.\n\n_ _ _ _ _\n\nTHIS MOLDY CHEESE MAY BE DELICIOUS, BUT YOU MAY BE TEMPTED TO, INSTEAD, SAY \"EW\". AFTER ALL, THAT'S ITS NAME.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _\n\nTHIS SEMI-HARD CHEESE IS ALSO A CELESTIAL STAGE, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE IT.\n\n_ _ _ | _ _ _ _\n\nTHIS NUTTY CHEESE'S NAME IS TWO WORDS. ONE IS PROBABLY IN YOUR DINING ROOM. IT MAY HAVE A CLOTH ON IT. THE OTHER IS NOT QUITE METAL, BUT NOT BLUE EITHER. IT'S NEXT TO A HARD PLACE, THOUGH.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _\n\nTHIS YELLOW CHEESE IS WARM ALL ROUND - IT'S SMOKEY, SPICY, AND HOT. YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND IT IN THE HEARTH, TOO, WHERE IT'S ALSO FAIRLY WARM.\n\n_ _ _ _\n\nCan you help Shog and Catija by solving the puzzle and finding out what the answer is?\n\nI warn you: The answer is cheesy.\n\n1An idiom for passing gas.\n\n2Salty cheese, yum.\n\n3A pun on grating cheese.\n\n4Ever heard of cheese rinds?\n\n5Cheese wheels!\n\n6Apparently, there's a cheese called Cotija.\n\n7On the other hand, most cheeses are rather mature...\n\n8Cheese melts. I admit this one was rather poor.\n\n9Holey puns!\n\n10I'm sorry. This one was obligatory.\n\n11Shredded cheese. Works well on pizza.\n\nEver seen one of those \"which breed of dog/Harry Potter character/programming language would you be\" personality quizzes?\n\nI decided to give a cheese-focused quiz to the Stack Exchange sites. (Well, not all the sites. Just the 15 at the top of the list of sites, and a handful of others.) Here are the results:\n\nStack Overflow\n\nFeta\n\nIt is, after all, the oldest cheese (or, at least, the closest modern equivalent).\n\nMathematics\n\nMozzarella\n\nOne of the world's most popular, yet not talked about much. Also, often associated with pizza.\n\nStack Overflow in Russian\n\nКоралл\n\n'cause it's Russian, see?\n\nUbuntu\n\nPepper Jack\n\nA popular, friendly introduction to something out of the mainstream.\n\nStack Overflow in Spanish\n\nManchego\n\nAnd this one's Spanish.\n\nSuper User\n\nCottage cheese\n\nLike Stack Overf—um, I mean, feta—it's one of the earliest cheese types.\n\nStack Overflow in Portuguese\n\nRequeijão\n\nBrazilian and Portuguese. C'mon, keep up.\n\nStats\n\nGouda\n\nNice enough, if kinda mild.\n\nPhysics\n\nEdam\n\nPretty cool, for those who know enough to get past the outer shell.\n\nUnix & Linux\n\nFive-cheese blend\n\nKind of a mixture of multiple similar topics.\n\nServer Fault\n\nDomiati\n\nAn early variant again... and a bit of a salty one.\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nCheddar\n\nOften feels extra sharp.\n\nGeographic Information Systems\n\nBlue cheese\n\nWhat really makes this special and distinctive from other cheeses/sites? An emphasis on sticking pins in things.\n\nMagento\n\nPecorino Romano\n\nUseful for making other things better, but not exactly a cheese people are enjoying mouthfuls of on its own. (See also Worldbuilding, below.)\n\nTeX and LaTeX\n\nProvel\n\nKind of a specialty. People who like it tend to be really into it.\n\nEnglish Language & Usage\n\nNeufchâtel\n\nA relatively old style; it's got a reputation for elitism in some circles.\n\nApple\n\nGorgonzola\n\nGreat with apples. If you don't have apples, maybe don't bother with this one.\n\nEnglish Language Learners\n\nCream cheese\n\nCovers territory originally owned by Neufchâtel/EL&U, but has evolved into its own distinct entity.\n\nMathOverflow\n\nAmerican\n\nCue semantics argument over whether this entry is technically qualified/eligible to be on the list.\n\nBlender\n\nQueijo Computadorizado de Duarte\n\nTake a moment to be amazed at what is clearly the best answer to this question. It's so awesome I don't even care that I'm giving free advertising to a competitor.\n\nSharePoint\n\nGovernment cheese\n\nWhether deservedly or not, it's got some negative connotations.\n\nCode Review\n\nMuenster\n\nVery pleasant, and can be applied in a wide variety of situations. Adding even just a little bit of this will greatly improve pretty much anything.\n\nTravel\n\nPaneer\n\nSomehow, it seems foreign and accessible at the same time.\n\nHome Improvement\n\nParmigiano-Reggiano\n\nA bit rough around the edges, but overall, it's solid.\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy\n\nPimiento cheese\n\nA fun cheese, if a little too spicy at times.\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nEmmentaler\n\nBetter known to many by another name. (Never forget Programmers SE! (Or, for the true OGs, Not Programming Related.))\n\nRole-Playing Games\n\nColby Jack\n\nA blend of two different groups (sorry, couldn't figure out how to work in a literal RAW vs. unpasteurized joke), but they work together well.\n\nStack Overflow in Japanese\n\nSakura\n\nA cheese from Japan. Seriously, you haven't figured out how this works yet?\n\nWorldbuilding\n\nNacho cheese\n\nThis is just for fun for most people, but for a few, it's a livelihood. (Kinda the opposite of Magento.)\n\nArqade\n\nSkyrim goat cheese wheel\n\nStarted out as an unremarkable component of a larger, established franchise, and quickly turned into an Internet phenomenon (for example).\n\nPuzzling\n\nBergkäse\n\nHard and nutty.\n\nMi Yodeya\n\nNon-animal-rennet cheese\n\nAre you kosher, but still want to have your cake cheese and eat it too? This is for you.\n\nSeasoned Advice\n\nÉpoisses de Bourgogne\n\nHas the quality demanded by epicures, yet is accessible enough for all.\n\nPhotography\n\nBlue Stilton\n\nMeets all the usual criteria, and looks real good doing it, too.\n\nInterpersonal Skills\n\nMilbenkäse\n\nIt's debatable how many people are legitimately interested in this and how many just want to gawk at a pile of excrement. Nevertheless, if the stories are to be believed, it could solve some real problems.\n\nArts & Crafts\n\nCotija\n\nOkay, this doesn't really have anything to do with A&C, I just wanted to make the easy Catija joke.\n\nCommunity Building\n\nLymeswold\n\nIt sounded like a great idea on paper, but it's pretty much died off.\n\nVeganism & Vegetarianism\n\nNon-dairy cheese\n\nNot yet mature, and rarely used.\n\nMeta Stack Exchange\n\nVieux Boulogne\n\nReally off-putting at first, but it does have a small, devoted—one might say \"cult-like\"—following.\n\nNeedless to say: marmots love cheese. (This is taken from here and done with a typesetting system that is often said to be only good for equations. The spurious black lines in the holes come from the conversion to an animated gif, and are not there on the pdf file that gets created when the following code gets compiled with pdflatex.)\n\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=3.14mm]{standalone} \\usetikzlibrary{3d} \\usepackage{tikz-3dplot} \\makeatletter % https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/48776/121799 \\tikzoption{canvas is xy plane at z}[]{% \\def\\tikz@plane@origin{\\pgfpointxyz{0}{0}{#1}}% \\def\\tikz@plane@x{\\pgfpointxyz{1}{0}{#1}}% \\def\\tikz@plane@y{\\pgfpointxyz{0}{1}{#1}}% \\tikz@canvas@is@plane } \\makeatother \\newcommand{\\DrawVerticalPart}[3][]{% \\draw[fill=yellow!30!orange,#1] plot[variable=\\x,domain=#2:#3,samples=30,smooth] ({4*cos(\\x)},{4*sin(\\x)},0) -- ++(0,0,2) -- plot[variable=\\x,domain=#3:#2,samples=30,smooth] ({4*cos(\\x)},{4*sin(\\x)},2) --cycle; } \\newcommand{\\CheesePiece}[1]{\\ifcase#1 \\or% 1: xz face \\begin{scope}[canvas is xz plane at y=0,transform shape] \\filldraw[fill=yellow!80!orange] (4,2) -- (4,0) --(0,0) -- (0,2) -- cycle; \\foreach \\x/\\y/\\r in {0.4/0.6/0.3, 0.5/1.3/0.2, 1.5/0.5/0.4, 1.5/0.5/0.4, 2.1/1.5/0.3, 2.5/0.8/0.2, 3.3/1.1/0.3} {\\shade[ball color=yellow!80!orange,opacity=0.2] (\\x,\\y) circle (\\r);} \\end{scope} \\or% 2: yz face \\begin{scope}[canvas is yz plane at x=0,transform shape] \\filldraw[fill=yellow!80!orange] (-4,2) -- (-4,0) --(0,0) -- (0,2) -- cycle; \\foreach \\x/\\y/\\r in {-0.4/0.6/0.3, -0.5/1.3/0.2, -1.5/0.5/0.4, -1.5/0.5/0.4, -2.1/1.5/0.3, -2.5/0.8/0.2, -3.3/1.1/0.3} {\\shade[ball color=yellow!80!orange,opacity=0.2] (\\x,\\y) circle (\\r);} \\end{scope} \\or% 3: top \\draw[fill=yellow!30!orange] plot[variable=\\x,domain=0:270,samples=90,smooth] ({4*cos(\\x)},{4*sin(\\x)},2) -- (0,-4,2) -- (0,0,2) -- (4,0,2); \\or% 4: bottom \\draw[fill=yellow!30!orange] plot[variable=\\x,domain=0:270,samples=90,smooth] ({4*cos(\\x)},{4*sin(\\x)},0) -- (0,-4,0) -- (0,0,0) -- (4,0,0); \\fi} \\begin{document} \\foreach \\X in {0,5,...,355}%{45,135,225,315} {%\\tdplotsetmaincoords{120+20*sin(\\X)}{-135+45*cos(2*\\X)} \\tdplotsetmaincoords{90+30*sin(\\X)}{\\X} \\begin{tikzpicture} \\path[use as bounding box] (-6,-3) rectangle (6,5); \\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\\xtest}{sign(cos(\\tdplotmainphi+90))} \\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\\ytest}{sign(-cos(\\tdplotmainphi))} \\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\\ztest}{sign(cos(\\tdplotmaintheta))} %\\node[anchor=north west] at (-6,5) {\\X,\\xtest,\\ytest,\\ztest}; \\begin{scope}[tdplot_main_coords] \\ifnum\\xtest=1 \\CheesePiece{2} \\ifnum\\ytest=1 \\CheesePiece{1} \\DrawVerticalPart{0}{\\tdplotmainphi-180} \\DrawVerticalPart{\\tdplotmainphi}{270} \\else \\DrawVerticalPart{0}{\\tdplotmainphi-180} \\fi \\else \\ifnum\\ytest=1 \\CheesePiece{1} \\DrawVerticalPart{\\tdplotmainphi}{270} \\else \\DrawVerticalPart{\\tdplotmainphi}{\\tdplotmainphi+180} \\fi \\fi \\ifnum\\ztest=1 \\CheesePiece{4} \\else \\CheesePiece{3} \\fi \\end{scope} \\end{tikzpicture}} \\end{document}"
