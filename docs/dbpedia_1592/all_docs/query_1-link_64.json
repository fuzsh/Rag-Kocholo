        "text": "CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO\n\nCheese Balls is one of the most famous and appreciated Brazilian finger foods. It is an easy, nutritious and cheap recipe, that always enjoys great popularity among guests of all ages.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the dough:\n\n• 500 ml milk\n\n• 1 level tablespoon salt\n\n• 50 g butter\n\n• 300 g all purpose flour\n\n• 30 g grated Parmesan cheese\n\nTo shape the cheese balls:\n\n• 250 g stretched-curd cheese, cut into cubes\n\n• all purpose flour 00\n\n• 1 or 2 eggs, beaten with a pinch of salt\n\n• breadcrumbs\n\n• peanut oil for frying\n\nPreparation method\n\nHeat milk, butter and salt together in a large pot.\n\nOnce the mixture begins to bubble lower the heat and add all of the flour at one time. Mix vigorously with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps, until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan and forms a compact and elastic ball. It only takes a few minutes. Turn off the fire, add the grated cheese and stir well to combine. Let it cool down. You can make this dough the day before, cover it with plastic wrap and store in the fridge.\n\nTo make the dough more malleable, knead it by hand just a little.\n\nDivide the dough into small balls (about 18 g each). Press the dough down to make a hollow in the centre of each ball. Place a cheese cube into each dough hollow and fold the dough up to enclose the cube.\n\nRoll stuffed balls into flour, then egg, beaten with a pinch of salt, and then into the breadcrumbs.\n\nDeep fry only a few pieces at a time to avoid lowering the oil’s temperature. To test frying oil temperature dip a toothpick into it, if you see bubbles start to form around the toothpick your oil is hot enough to fry. Fry until golden brown and crispy, drain on absorbent paper and serve immediately, very hot.\n\nNotes:\n\n• They can be heated in a gas oven or in an electric oven.\n\n• They can be frozen before frying; you can fry them either frozen or thawed.\n\n• You can coat the cheese balls by passing through water with a little all purpose flour or by passing through very cold water (almost iced) and breadcrumbs.\n\nYield: 45 cheese balls.\n\nPosted on: 18 May 2017\n\n“Sabor Brasil” is now a book with hundreds of traditional recipes interspersed with tales and stories in a fascinating journey through knowledge and taste.\n\nBesides illustrating ingredients and culinary procedures, it tells the story of recipe origins, often linked to a specific geographical area and the influence of cultures that come from afar. It tells how food is perceived by the Brazilian people and describes both the places where it is eaten and the rituals that accompany it.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOOK CLICK HERE\n\nThis is a practical handbook created to familiarize yourselves with the Brazilian language and the melting-pot culture of Latin America’s largest country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE\n\nIn “www.saborbrasil.it” it could happen material on which the Author’s Rights could lie over and was picked up from public sources that are accessible to anyone.
