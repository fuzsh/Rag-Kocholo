        "text": "Background Biodiesel production has increased dramatically over the last decade, raising the need for new rapid and non-destructive analytical tools and technologies. 1H Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) applications, which offer great potential to the field of biodiesel, have been developed by the Phyto Lipid Biotechnology Lab research team in the last few years. Results Supervised and un-supervised chemometric tools are suggested for screening new alternative biodiesel feedstocks according to oil content and viscosity. The tools allowed assignment into viscosity groups of biodiesel-petrodiesel samples whose viscosity is unknown, and uncovered biodiesel samples that have residues of unreacted acylglycerol and/or methanol, and poorly separated and cleaned glycerol and water. In the case of composite materials, relaxation time distribution, and cross-correlation methods were successfully applied to differentiate components. Continuous distributed methods were also applied...\n\nThis review discusses the theory and applications of the Continuous Wave Free Precession (CWFP) sequence in low-field, time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR). CWFP is a special case of the Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) regime that is obtained when a train of radiofrequency pulses, separated by a time interval Tp shorter than the effective transverse relaxation time (T2*), is applied to a sample. Unlike regular pulsed experiments, in the CWFP regime, the amplitude is not dependent on T1. Therefore, Tp should be as short as possible (limited by hardware). For Tp &lt; 0.5 ms, thousands of scans can be performed per second, and the signal to noise ratio can be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude. The amplitude of the CWFP signal is dependent on T1/T2; therefore, it can be used in quantitative analyses for samples with a similar relaxation ratio. The time constant to reach the CWFP regime (T*) is also dependent on relaxation times and flip angle (θ). Therefore, T*...\n\nTime domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are well-known non-destructive characterization techniques that are used to evaluate food quality. Time domain NMR is primarily based on relaxation and diffusion measurements from the signal coming from the whole sample whereas MRI enables visualization of the interiors of intact foods on a macroscopic scale without disturbing the sample based on the differences on relaxation and diffusion. A common perception that using NMR/MRI for testing food is costly is no longer valid with the advances in low-field bench top NMR/MRI instruments. This short review paper discusses the most recent developments and examples of time domain NMR and MRI based sensors for different food applications.\n\nThis study shows the use of time-domain (TD)-NMR transverse relaxation (T2) data and chemometrics in the nondestructive determination of fat content for powdered food samples such as commercial dried milk products. Most proposed NMR spectroscopy methods for measuring fat content correlate free induction decay or echo intensities with the sample&#39;s mass. The need for the sample&#39;s mass limits the analytical frequency of NMR determination, because weighing the samples is an additional step in this procedure. Therefore, the method proposed here is based on a multivariate model of T2 decay, measured with Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence and reference values of fat content. The TD-NMR spectroscopy method shows high correlation (r = 0.95) with the lipid content, determined by the standard extraction method of Bligh and Dyer. For comparison, fat content determination was also performed using a multivariate model with near-IR (NIR) spectroscopy, which is also a nondestructive ...\n\nThis review covers recent developments in the field of non-invasive techniques for the quality assessment of processed horticultural products over the past decade. The concept of quality and various quality characteristics related to evaluating processed horticultural products are detailed. A brief overview of non-invasive methods, including spectroscopic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hyperspectral imaging techniques, is presented. This review highlights their application to predict quality attributes of different processed horticultural products (e.g., powders, juices, and oils). A concise summary of their potential commercial application for quality assessment, control, and monitoring of processed agricultural products is provided. Finally, we discuss their limitations and highlight other emerging non-invasive techniques applicable for monitoring and evaluating the quality attributes of processed horticultural products. Our findings suggest that infrared spectroscopy..."
