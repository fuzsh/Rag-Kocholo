        "text": "The buying process is affected by many aspects, in which consumer’s age is certainly an important feature to be considered. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese on the purchasing behavior of different age groups of consumers in order to obtain marketing information that aid in increasing sales of Requeijão cheese.\n\nThree focus groups were created, each one composed of ten participants. The first group was aged 18-30 years old, the second group included people aged 31-50, and the third group participants were aged between 51 and 70 years old. Requeijão cheese labeling and packaging was presented to all groups to facilitate a discussion. A moderator asked participants in the three groups about the factors on the packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese that influence their desire to purchase. Seven final themes were analyzed by thematic analysis: packaging, color and images on label, information, lid, price and brand.\n\nThe factors of greatest importance that influenced purchasing for the first and second group were glass packaging and color labels. Groups 2 and 3 preferred a packaging size of 250 g, an aluminum cap protected with a plastic cap, information, and affordable prices. Group 1 demonstrated high interest in 220 g packaging, metal lid and brands. Group 3 preferred plastic packaging. All groups were attracted by images on labels related to the product origin. The results from this study may be advantageous for creating marketing strategies to increase sales of Requeijão cheese and similar milk products that are sold in comparable ways.\n\nConcept and attitudes toward packaging and labeling have changed in modern times. The present study demonstrates how consumers of different age groups have divergent opinions about packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese, factors that have huge influences in the purchasing of this product. The results from this study will aid in creating marketing strategies to increase sales of Requeijão cheese and similar milk products that are sold in similar conditions. The findings will also assist manufactures in creating bonds with costumers once packaging and labeling might be produced in accordance with the preference of each age group of consumers, and consequently makes the visual aspects of packaging more attractive to them.\n\nThis study collected information about the most features in packaging and labeling of Requeijão cheese that attract consumers in the food buying process. There are many companies that sell Requeijão cheese. Then, it is necessary to understand the needs of consumers in relation to packaging and labeling of similar products, to make it more competitive in the market and to meet the expectations of consumers in order to create bond with them."
