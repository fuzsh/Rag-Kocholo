The Geneva School, a K4â12 Christian classical school in Winter Park, will open a new 59,000-square-foot upper school facility on its 40-acre campus on Seminola Boulevard, Casselberry in August 2019.

Expansion Plans

This phase of construction is the second in Genevaâs overall campus expansion plan, which began with a $6 million state-of-the-art athletic facility located on Seminola Boulevard. The athletic facility, which officially opened in November 2016, includes soccer, softball, baseball, and practice fields, a full-size track with facilities for field events, as well as tennis and beach volleyball courts.

The new building will be home to students in 7th-12th grade. For a season, the school will be on two campus locations serving one mission. Grammar students (K4â6th grade) will remain at the schoolâs current campus on Semoran Boulevard in Winter Park. As enrollment grows on both campuses, plans are in place for a third phase of construction on the new property to enable the entire school to be together on one campus.

âGenevaâs expansion is a game-changer for the school,â said Board Chairman John Riley. âOur current footprint in Winter Park has capped enrollment at about 500 students for several years. Itâs been frustrating to turn away potential students and their families. We are excited about the potential for growth in our student population. Our teachers are thrilled about the new resources and space. In fact, they have already been dreaming about new ways to enhance academic programming.â

Think Deep

The design of the middle and high school facility supports Geneva’s mission of teaching students how to think deeply and speak persuasively. In addition to classroom and office spaces, the design includes a full-sized gymnasium, locker and weight rooms, multiple science labs, and a black box performance theater that will include state-of-the-art amenities for lighting, sound, and audience seating. Other interesting features include a daVinci Lab used for group discussion, creative collaboration, and student thesis presentations, as well as a collaborative (multi-purpose) industrial space for drama set design, science experiments, large art projects, and digital photography shoots. Other adjacent spaces include an art lab with a kiln and sound-treated music rooms for lessons and practices.

Inspiration

Since the founding of The Geneva School in 1993, the faculty, staff, administration, and board members have relentlessly pursued this one mission: inspiring students to love beauty, think deeply, and pursue Christ’s calling. This will not change. Teachers and staff are excited about implementing the mission using new spaces in new ways to engage the hearts, minds, and imaginations of their students.
