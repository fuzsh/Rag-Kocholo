        "text": "Christian college in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.\n\nThis article is about the school in Pennsylvania. For the school in Tasmania, see Geneva Christian College. For the New York school once known as Geneva College, see Hobart and William Smith Colleges.\n\nReformed Christianity portal\n\nGeneva College is a private Christian college in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1848, in Northwood, Ohio, the college moved to its present location in 1880, where it continues to educate a student body of about 1400 traditional undergraduates in over 30 majors, as well as graduate students in a handful of master's programs. The only undergraduate institution affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), the college's undergraduate core curriculum emphasizes the humanities and the formation of a Reformed Christian worldview.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneva College was founded in 1848 in Northwood, Ohio, by John Black Johnston, a minister of the RPCNA. The college was founded as \"Geneva Hall\", and was named after the Swiss center of the Reformed faith movement. After briefly closing during the American Civil War, the college continued operating in Northwood until 1880. By that time, the college leadership had begun a search for alternate locations that were closer to urban areas. After considering several locations in the Midwest, the denomination chose the College Hill neighborhood of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. The college constructed its current campus on land donated by the Harmony Society. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was completed in 1881.\n\nThe Rapp Technical Design Center was completed in 2002. A major project to reroute Pennsylvania Route 18, which runs through the campus, was completed in November 2007.[4] Improvements to Reeves Stadium and the construction of a campus entrance and pedestrian mall were completed in 2009.[5]\n\nPresidents\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Black Johnston (1848–1850)\n\nWilliam Finney George (1850–1852)\n\nJames Renwick Willson Sloane (1852–1856)\n\nCalvin Knox Milligan (1856–1858)\n\nJohn Calvin Smith (1858–1860)\n\nNathan Robinson Johnston (1865–1867)\n\nSamuel John Crowe (1867–1871)\n\nWilliam Milroy (1871–1872)\n\nHenry Hosick George (1872–1890)\n\nWilliam Pollock Johnston (1890–1907)\n\nWilliam Henry George (1907–1916)\n\nRenwick Harper Martin (1916–1920)\n\nArchibald Anderson Johnston (1920–1923)\n\nMcLeod Milligan Pearce (1923–1948)\n\nCharles Marston Lee (1948–1956)\n\nEdwin Cameron Clarke (1956–1980)\n\nDonald William Felker (1980–1983)\n\nEdwin Cameron Clarke (1983–1984)\n\nWilliam Joseph McFarland (1984–1992)\n\nJohn H. White (1992–2004)\n\nKenneth A. Smith (2004–2015)\n\nCalvin L. Troup (2016–Present)\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo bodies oversee the administration of the college, the Board of Corporators and the Board of Trustees; while the Corporators are the legal owners of the college, in practice most authority is delegated to the Trustees, who are elected by the Corporators. Both Boards drafted the philosophical basis on which the college rests, known as the Foundational Concepts of Higher Education.[6] The RPCNA still takes an active sponsorship and oversight role in the college: the college president, chaplain, and chairman of the Department of Biblical Studies must be members of the RPCNA, and all members of the Board of Corporators and the majority of the Board of Trustees must be RPCNA members. All professors and lecturers in the Department of Biblical Studies must subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith, and all full-time faculty and staff members must submit a written statement confessing faith in Jesus Christ and the Christian religion.\n\nThe university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2014 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students.[7]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneva offers undergraduate degree programs in the arts and sciences, such as elementary education, business, engineering, student ministry, biology, and psychology. In 2006, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) rated the Business and Accounting undergraduates in the 95th percentile amongst American colleges.\n\nGeneva offers a Degree Completion Program (DCP) for degrees in Human Resource Management, Community Ministry or Organizational Development for adult students mainly at off-campus locations. Geneva also established the Center for Urban Theological Studies in Philadelphia and has sister colleges in Taiwan (Christ College) and South Korea (Chong Shin College and Theological Seminary).\n\nGeneva also offers graduates studies in several fields and degrees including a Master of Business Administration, a Masters of Science in Organizational Leadership, Masters of Education in Reading or Special Education, and Masters of Arts in Counseling or Higher Education.\n\nGeneva established the Center for Technology Development in 1986 for providing research, prototyping and technical support to local industries and entrepreneurs. The center was awarded first prize in the Consolidated Natural Gas Company's Annual Award of Excellence competition in 1990.\n\nOnline Courses\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneva partners with Portage Learning to offer online college courses on their platform. These online college courses are offered to visiting students seeking to transfer courses to their home institution where they intend to pursue a degree. Courses completed prior to matriculation may be used by Geneva students to fulfill degree requirements.[8]\n\nAffiliations and accreditations\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneva College is a member institution of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Council of Independent Colleges,[9] and National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[10] Accreditations include the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs, and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. The chemistry degree is certified by the American Chemical Society.\n\nAthletics\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneva's sports teams are called the Golden Tornadoes. The college is a dual member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III and National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) Division I.[11] The Golden Tornadoes compete as a member of the Presidents' Athletic Conference. Geneva was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for many years and competed in the now-defunct American Mideast Conference. Geneva joined the NCAA as a provisional member in 2007 and during the transition process was not eligible for post season play or conference Player of the Week honors until gaining membership in July 2011.[12]\n\nThe school offers a range of men's and women's varsity sports, including football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, cross country, tennis, and soccer.[13]\n\nGeneva has also offered rugby as a club sport since 1994.\n\nSee List of Geneva Golden Tornadoes head football coaches\n\nFootball competition began in 1890 under head coach William McCracken. Over the years, the football team has amassed an all-time record of 496 wins, 437 losses, and 48 ties with five appearances in the Victory Bowl. The current football coach is Geno DeMarco.\n\nCulture and traditions\n\n[edit]\n\nStudents must attend a designated number of weekly college-sponsored chapels to qualify for graduation. Alcohol is banned from the campus, and tobacco use is restricted from the entire campus. Greek letter fraternities and sororities are not permitted.\n\nOne of the earliest college basketball games in the United States occurred at Geneva College on April 8, 1893, when the Geneva College Covenanters defeated the New Brighton YMCA.[14] Geneva commemorates this event through the athletic slogan of \"The Birthplace of College Basketball\". Geneva also has one of the oldest basketball courts in collegiate sports in the Johnson Gymnasium.\n\nGeneva was founded by Scottish and Scots-Irish immigrants. Many names of campus buildings and areas bear Scottish names:\n\nThe main meeting area of the Student Center is called Skye Lounge after the Isle of Skye.\n\nThe restaurant-style eating area is called The Brig, short for Brigadoon, commemorating a play about a mythical Highland village.\n\nGeneva sports teams were nicknamed the Covenanters until the 1950s. Members of the RPCNA are sometimes referred to as Covenanters because the denomination traces its roots to the Covenanting tradition of Reformation era Scotland. The modern sports nickname of Golden Tornadoes commemorates the \"Golden Tornado\" of May 11, 1914, when a major tornado struck the college, most notably taking the gold colored roof from the top of Old Main, which was the origin of the associated color. Although the storm caused significant damage to the campus, there were no serious injuries. College students and faculty rejoiced at what they believed was a sign of God's mercy.\n\nGeneva's traditional sports rivalry is with Westminster College in nearby New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.[15]\n\nHomosexual behavior is prohibited in the student handbook; students must confess and change their behavior or be suspended.[16][non-primary source needed]\n\nFacilities\n\n[edit]\n\nOffices and classrooms\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexander Hall—Admissions, financial aid, alumni relations, institutional advancement, and public relations offices (first floor) and main dining hall (second floor).[17]\n\nAlumni Hall, the primary music building, including music department offices[18]\n\nFern Cliffe, faculty offices for political science, humanities, history and English departments[19]\n\nJohnston Gym, built in 1911, Johnston Gym is primarily used for music and band purposes.

The college also owns a few smaller houses nearby campus, primarily for upperclassmen, that are available depending on residential need.[38]\n\nLegal actions\n\n[edit]\n\nCareerLink\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 15, 2006, the college filed a federal lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, alleging that a decision by the state to block the college from participating in the state sponsored CareerLink job service amounted to a violation of the college's First Amendment rights. Although the state argued that the college's requirement that faculty and staff members subscribe to the Christian religion amounted to discrimination, the lawsuit was settled. Geneva's right to access to CareerLink was restored and the college retains a statement on its employment applications stating \"Compliance with Geneva's Christian views is considered a bona fide occupational qualification ... and will have a direct impact on employment consideration.\"[39]\n\nObamacare\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, the college sued the federal government over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") contraceptive mandate, which requires employers to provide health insurance coverage for their employees that includes contraception, which Geneva College \"considers abortion, abortifacients and embryo-harming pharmaceuticals\" and objects to on religious grounds.[40] The college, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom in the litigation, prevailed in its case, obtaining a permanent injunction in 2018.[40][41]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nJosie Badger, Ms Wheelchair America in 2011\n\nJoyce Bender, CEO, President, and founder of Bender Consulting Services, Inc.
