        "text": "All students can thrive when introduced to the classical pedagogy, no matter their academic background. With many years to test this premise and with many students entering at various grade levels from all different kinds of educational backgrounds, we can heartily attest to positive outcomes for all kinds of students. Yes, the curriculum is rigorous and ahead of many public and independent schools, but we find that our expert faculty and small class sizes engage students in a love for learning and a confidence to explore in new and creative ways.\n\nWhile we do not intentionally select, recruit, or otherwise aim for a diverse population, we are able to achieve great diversity in our student body as a result of the ethnic diversity of the city, the financial aid we provide, and the large geographic range of our reach. The wide-ranging diversity of our school creates a unique and uplifting learning environment.\n\nWhile there is no restriction on applicants, it should be noted that the School exists because of Jesus Christ and for the glory of God, as outlined in our Statement of Values. Our families must agree in writing and adhere to our Statement of Faith as part of the application process, since a lack of sincere support for the Christ-centered framework taught at Geneva School would be both confusing and detrimental to the student.\n\nThe namesake city Geneva, Switzerland, has come to be known as one of the influencing cities of the Reformation and the birthplace of classical education. The city of Geneva in the 1500s wielded cultural, social, religious, educational, and political influence over its region and over other parts of Europe. Christian classical education flourished there and contributed to the changes brought about in the world.\n\nWe are committed to making the education at Geneva School as affordable as possible for families. With our graduated tuition schedule and tuition rates nearly half of comparative independent schools in New York, the value of an education at Geneva School is hard to match. Our excellent faculty, vibrant community, and access to the city's top cultural institutions make Geneva School a truly unique learning environment. We offer need-based financial aid in order to make the School accessible to as many as possible.\n\nAll interested families are encouraged to attend a virtual information session as the first step in the application process. We look forward to inviting you into our classrooms to observe the beauty of a classical Christian education following the virtual information session and as part of subsequent admissions steps. You may apply beginning September 1 and attend any of our scheduled virtual information sessions. If you are applying outside the admissions season, you can schedule a one-on-one virtual information session with a member of our Admissions team after the application is submitted.\n\nBeginners must be 3 years old by August 31. Junior Kindergarten children must be 4 years old by August 31. Kindergarten students must be 5 years old by August 31. All applicants will be assessed to determine placement and readiness, in order to ensure their success at Geneva School.\n\nBeginning September 1, school applications for the following year may be accessed via Admissions. See our admissions timeline for assistance as to when to apply; the earlier the better. We have a recommended application deadline of December 15.\n\nThe amount of financial aid varies based on need. All applicants interested in financial aid must apply for aid through TADS in the admissions section of our website. Our financial aid committee looks at each family's ability to pay and makes a determination of an award based on many factors.\n\nBeginners Threes and Fours meet five days a week from 8:30AM to 11:30AM or 12:15PM to 3:15PM.\n\nJunior Kindergarten meets five days a week from 8:30AM to 3:00PM.\n\nKindergarten and above meet five days a week from 8:20AM to 3:15PM.\n\nGeneva School does not currently have the resources or programs to assist children with special needs. If the need is mild, however, it may be possible for the child to succeed at Geneva School.Ã‚"
