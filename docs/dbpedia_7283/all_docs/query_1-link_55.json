Each college may have specific criteria and deadlines that must be met.\n\nAdmissions requirements can include submitting transcripts, standardized test scores, letters of recommendation, and personal statements.\n\nTo set yourself up for success, we suggest gathering all necessary documents and preparing a compelling application highlighting your achievements, experiences, and future goals. Seek guidance from teachers, counselors, or mentors who can provide valuable insights and assistance throughout the application process.\n\nBy submitting a well-prepared and thoughtful application, you increase your chances of gaining admission to colleges with free tuition programs.\n\nAdditional resources for students\n\nIn addition to accessing free tuition or the benefits of Questbridge programs, students can take advantage of other programs that expand access and opportunities for success. We’ll cover two of our favorite opportunities now.\n\nSummer bridge programs\n\nMany colleges and universities offer structured summer programs for incoming students to support their academic and social transition to the institution. These cohort-based programs serve as a supportive \"bridge\" from your high school to your four-year college experience.\n\nSummer bridge programs are often designed to serve communities of students with limited access to higher education, including students of color, students in the first generation of their family to complete a bachelor's degree, students from low-income households, and students whose backgrounds are underrepresented in particular academic disciplines.\n\nSome summer bridge programs may even allow you to earn college credit or satisfy degree requirements before your first year. While other programs provide financial assistance, sometimes called \"startup grants,\" through a stipend, grant, or purchased technology.\n\nClick this link to read more about summer bridge programs and how they can help you better access and succeed in college.\n\nFly-in and diversity programs\n\nMany colleges and universities would like to enroll more students from first-generation, lower-income, or minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds, so they will host events focused on culture and diversity to increase representation from underrepresented student groups.\n\nThese overnight or multi-day events, often known as ‘fly-in programs,’ let you experience campus up close so you can get to know the students and faculty who bring the college to life.\n\nFor prospective students, fly-ins and diversity visit programs typically occur in the spring of junior year or fall of senior year before you submit your college applications. There are also fly-in and visit programs created to help admitted students decide where to enroll in the spring of senior year.\n\nYou can read more about fly-in and diversity programs here.\n\nLearn your chances of admission with Appily\n\nAs you navigate the college application process, you'll want to make confident decisions based on facts. You can use Appily's chances calculator to calculate your chances of getting into any college."
