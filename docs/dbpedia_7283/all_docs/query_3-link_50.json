        "text": "An 85-year-old woman died Feb. 20 after an alligator grabbed her dog in a St. Lucie County community along Florida's East Coast.\n\nWitnesses called 911 and firefighters recovered the woman's body from a pond. A contracted nuisance alligator trapper captured the alligator, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nSpanish Lakes Fairways residents said the alligator grabbed the woman's dog and she struggled to get the dog away before falling victim herself.\n\nAlligators are a common sight around Florida, although the number of attacks, especially fatal ones, is low.\n\nWoman killed saving dog from alligator:Wildlife officials investigate woman's death in 'alligator bite incident' at golf community\n\nDisney alligator attack:Officials recover body of toddler after attack at Disney resort\n\nAn attack that gained national attention was the death of 2-year-old Lane Graves, which happened almost seven years ago. In June 2016, Lane was grabbed by an alligator as he played in about a foot of water at the Seven Seas Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa in Orlando. Both his parents rushed to his aid but were unable to save their son.\n\nA lighthouse statue was erected a year later near where the incident happened to honor Lane.\n\n\"The lighthouse sculpture has been installed to help spread awareness of the Lane Thomas Foundation, which was established to provide assistance and support to families whose children need organ transplants,'' a Disney spokesperson told USAT TODAY.\n\nHow many alligators are there in Florida?\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million alligators are in Florida and can be found in all 67 counties, according to FWC.\n\nThey can be found in practically all fresh and brackish water bodies and occasionally in salt water.\n\nWhy do alligators bite people?\n\nAlligators seldom bite people for reasons other than food, according to the FWC. Female alligators may protect their nests by hissing and opening their mouths to frighten intruders but rarely bite people.\n\nAlligator bites are most likely to occur in or around water. Although alligators can move quickly on land, they are not well adapted for capturing prey out of the water.\n\nHowever, they can lunge at prey within a few feet of the shoreline. Alligator bites can result in serious infection, and victims should seek immediate medical attention if bitten.\n\nHow many people have been bitten by alligators in Florida?\n\nIn 2021, seven people received major bites and two received minor bites from alligators, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. The figures are the latest in which numbers are available and may not include incidents still under investigation.\n\nMajor bites are those in which the victims' injuries required medical care. Minor bites are those in which the victims' injuries were superficial and required no treatment or only first aid.\n\nThe last reported death associated with an alligator before the attack in St. Lucie County was in 2019.\n\nFWC documents 26 alligator fatalities in Florida from wild alligators\n\nCan't see the report on alligator attacks?\n\nFrom 1948 to 2021, 442 unprovoked bite incidents have occurred in Florida. Twenty-six of the bites resulted inpeople being killed by wild alligators.\n\nA total of 303 people have received major injuries and 139 have received minor injuries over the same time period.\n\nThe deadliest year on record for deadly alligator attacks was in 1993, when two people were killed.\n\nIn 1977, 13 people received major injuries, followed by 11 in 2001 and 10 in 2017.\n\nWhat are the chances of being bitten by an alligator?\n\nOver the last 10 years, Florida has averaged eight unprovoked bites per year that are serious enough to require professional medical treatment.\n\nThe likelihood of a Florida resident being seriously injured during an unprovoked alligator incident in Florida is roughly only one in 3.1 million, according to FWC.\n\nWhat is a nuisance alligator?\n\nAn alligator may be considered a nuisance if it's at least 4 feet in length and believed to pose a threat to people, pets or property.\n\nAlligators less than 4 feet in length are not large enough to be dangerous to people or pets, unless handled.\n\nThere is a condition, though. If there's an alligator under 4 feet is found in your swimming pool, on your porch, under your car, or in a similar situation, a nuisance alligator trapper can be contacted.\n\nThe FWC does not relocate nuisance alligators. Why is that?\n\nRelocated alligators often try to return to their capture site. They can create problems for people or other alligators along the way.\n\nIs it illegal to feed alligators?\n\nMost alligators are naturally afraid of humans but may lose that fear when people feed them. Feeding alligators teaches them to associate people with food.\n\nFor that reason, it is illegal to feed wild alligators.\n\nWhat should you do if you're bitten by an alligator?\n\nIf an alligator bites you, the best thing to do is fight back, providing as much noise and resistance aspossible.\n\nHitting or kicking the alligator or poking it in its eyes may cause it to release its grip. When alligators seize prey they cannot easily overpower, they will often let go and retreat.\n\nSeek immediate medical attention if bitten by an alligator. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.\n\nHow big are Florida alligators?\n\nFemale alligators rarely exceed 10 feet in length. Males get much larger.\n\nThe Florida record for length is a 14 foot 3-1/2 inch male from Lake Washington in Brevard County. The Florida record for weight is a 1,043 pound (13 feet 10-1/2 inches long) male from Orange Lake in Alachua County.\n\nTips to avoid alligators\n\nBe aware of the possible presence of alligators when in or near fresh or brackish water\n\nClosely supervise children when they are playing in or around water.\n\nNever swim outside of posted swimming areas.\n\nSwim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn.\n\nDo not allow pets to swim, exercise or drink in or near waters that may contain alligators or in designated swimming areas with humans. Dogs are more susceptible to being bitten than humans because dogs resemble the natural prey of alligators. The sound of dogs barking and playing may draw an alligator to thearea.\n\nNever feed or entice alligators.\n\nDispose of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; do not throw them in the water.\n\nObserve and photograph alligators only from a safe distance.\n\nNever remove an alligator from its natural habitat or accept one as a pet. It is illegal and dangerous to do so. Handling even small alligators can result in injury.\n\nStay safe:5 ways to avoid getting attacked or killed by a Florida alligator\n\nWho do you call if you're concerned about an alligator?\n\nCall the Nuisance Alligator Hotline at 866-FWC-GATOR (866-392-4286)."
