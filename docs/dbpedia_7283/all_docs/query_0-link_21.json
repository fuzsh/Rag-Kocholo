        "text": "Public university in Tallahassee, Florida, U.S.\n\n\"Florida State\" redirects here. For the U.S. state, see Florida.\n\nNot to be confused with University of Florida.\n\nFlorida State University (FSU or, more commonly, Florida State) is a public research university in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Chartered in 1851, it is located on Florida's oldest continuous site of higher education.[15][2]\n\nFlorida State University comprises 17 separate colleges and 58 centers, facilities, labs, and institutes that offer programs of study, including professional school programs.[16] In 2023, the university enrolled 43,701 students from all 50 states and 135 countries.[17] Florida State is home to Florida's only national laboratory, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, and was instrumental in the commercial development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.[18] Florida State University also operates the John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the nation's largest museum/university complexes.[19] The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).[20]\n\nThe university is classified \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[21] The university had research and development (R&D) expenditures of $414 million.[22] Per 2022 National Science Foundation data the university ranked 82nd out of 890 evaluated institutions.[23] The university has an annual budget of $3 billion and an annual estimated economic impact of $15.5 billion.[24]\n\nFlorida State has a collaborative relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and is allowed to use the name Seminoles and certain imagery.[25][26] FSU's intercollegiate sports teams, known by their \"Florida State Seminoles\" nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Florida State's varsity teams have won 19 all-time national athletic championships in nine sports.[27]\n\nHistory\n\nFlorida State University is traceable to a plan set by the 1823 U.S. Congress to create a higher education system.[29] The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the primary system by providing for land allocated for the schools.[30] In 1845 Congress passed the law admitting Florida as the 27th state. In a supplementary act to the law granting admission, Congress authorized two townships to host seminaries, one east and one west of the Suwannee River.[31]\n\nIn 1851, the Florida Legislature authorized the Seminaries to be awarded to the two towns offering the best school support. The legislature declared the purpose of these institutions to be:\n\nthe instruction of persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching all the various branches that pertain to a good common school education; and next to instruct in the mechanic arts, in husbandry, in agricultural chemistry, in the fundamental laws, and in what regards the rights and duties of citizens.[32]\n\nWhile the East Seminary was settled in Ocala in 1853, the West Seminary state institution opportunity created a contentious fight between the towns of Quincy, Marianna, and Tallahassee.[33] Quincy dropped out of the competition in the following years, while Marianna and Tallahassee refused to yield. Failing to resolve the impasse, the conflict was returned to the governor and legislature for resolution. In 1854, as an incentive to the state, Tallahassee re-established an old school for boys, now called the Florida Institute, and combined the school with land and buildings. The legislature finally awarded Tallahassee with the West Seminary in 1856. The governor signed the law on January 1, 1857.[34][35] In October 1858 the school was made coeducational by incorporating the Female Institute, which was located nearby.[36]\n\nThe West Florida Seminary was located on the former Florida Institute property. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee.[37][38]\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction\n\nDuring 1860–1861, the legislature amended the 1851 law and started military instruction for students, partly due to the desire to protect the instructional staff from conscription, which would have closed the school.[39] During the Civil War, the seminary became \"'The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute.'\" [40] Enrollment grew to around 250 students. The school arguably became the state's largest and most respected educational institution.[40] In 1865, at the Battle of Natural Bridge south of Tallahassee, cadets from the school joined active-duty Confederate troops in the defensive line.[41]\n\nThe cadets were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson and led into battle by Captain D.W. Gwynn.[43][44] Some reports show the cadets played a minor role in the battle defending artillery pieces.[45] The combined Confederate forces defeated attacking Union forces leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces.[46][47]\n\nAt the surrender of Florida, Union military forces disarmed the cadets and used campus buildings as barracks until September 1865. The school then reopened and resumed its academic purpose.[48][49] The FSU Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) is authorized to display a battle streamer Natural Bridge 1865.[50] FSU is one of four institutions that can display a military battle streamer.[51]\n\nFirst state university\n\nIn 1883, the institution officially known as the West Florida Seminary was organized by the Board of Education as The Literary College of the University of Florida. (In the terminology of the time, schools were divided into seminaries and literary institutions; the name does not imply a focus on literature.) Under the new university charter, the seminary became the institution's Literary College and was to contain several \"schools\" or departments in different disciplines.[52] However, in the new university association the seminary's \"separate Charter and special organization\" were maintained.[53] Florida University also incorporated the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery, and recognized three more colleges to be established at a later date.[52] The Florida Legislature recognized the university under the title \" University of Florida\" in Spring 1885 but committed no additional financing or support.[32][54] Without legislative support, the university project struggled. The institution never assumed the \"university\" title,[54] and the association dissolved when the medical college relocated to Jacksonville later that year.[52]\n\nAccording to Doak Campbell, Florida State University's fifth president, \"During the first 50 years...its activities were limited to courses of secondary-school grade. Progress was slow. Indeed, it was not until the turn of the [twentieth] century that it could properly qualify as a collegiate institution.\"[55] In 1901, it became Florida State College.[32]\n\nBuckman Act\n\nThe 1905 Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into a school for white men (University of the State of Florida), a school for white women (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students).[56] The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the character of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. The school's early and major benefactor, James Westcott III, willed substantial monies to support continued operations.[57] In 1911, his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the state, stating the change in character was within the intent of the Westcott will.[58]\n\nBy 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the US. It was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored.[61][62] Florida State was the largest of the original two state universities in Florida until 1919.[63]\n\nReturn to coeducational status\n\nReturning soldiers using the G.I. Bill after World War II stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field.[32] By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University.[64] The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College.[65] The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added, including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing, and Social Welfare.[66] Strozier Library (1956),[67] and Tully Gymnasium (1956)[68] were built at this time.\n\nActivism\n\nCivil Rights\n\nAfter many years as a whites-only university, in 1962, Maxwell Courtney became the first African-American undergraduate student admitted to Florida State.[70] Fred Flowers joined the FSU baseball team as the first African-American athlete in university history in 1965.[71] In 1968 Calvin Patterson became the first African-American player for the university football team.[72]\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s Florida State University became a center for student activism especially in the areas of racial integration, women's rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War.[73][74] The school acquired the nickname \"Berkeley of the South\"[75] during this period, about similar student activities at the University of California, Berkeley. The school is also said to have originated the 1970s fad of \"streaking,\" said to have been first observed on Landis Green.[76][77]\n\nIn 1972 Margaret Menzel, a professor in the biology department, led a class-action lawsuit charging discrimination against women in pay and promotion.[78][79] The case was settled in 1975 with an agreement that the university would establish a task force to investigate bias against women at the university and to revise its anti-nepotism policy so as to not discriminate against the wives of university employees.[80] Bill Wade, a gay male student, was elected Homecoming Princess using the name \"Billie Dahhling\" in 1980.[81][82] While Wade's election may initially have been more college prank than protest, the controversy of the social acceptance of homosexuality was evident at FSU in the 1980s.[81][83] Official university policy established in 2013 prohibits discrimination against multiple protected groups, including the LGBT community.[84]\n\nMedicine and Preeminance\n\nThe Florida Legislature approved the creation of the allopathic Florida State University College of Medicine in June 2000 due to a need for medical doctors, especially in primary care fields.[85] It was the first medical school approved in the United States in almost two decades.[86] The King Life Sciences Building, located next to the College of Medicine, was added June 2008, to complement medical research with research in related fields.[87]\n\nIn 2013 the Florida Legislature and the Florida Board of Governors designated Florida State University and the University of Florida as the first two \"preeminent universities\" among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida.[88][89] The status is based on objective criteria and must be earned annually.[90] The shared goal of having top national universities in Florida is highly political, often centering on the use of the term \"flagship,\" a poorly defined and frequently inflammatory informal title.[91][92]\n\nCampus\n\nMain campus – Tallahassee\n\nThe state acquired the land of the main campus from the City of Tallahassee in January 1857 when the Florida Institute was transferred.[93][35] The main campus consists of 485.87 acres (2.0 km2).[93] Outside Leon county the university owns more than 1,715 acres (6.94 km2).[94] The main campus is bordered by Stadium Drive to the west, Tennessee Street (U.S. Route 90) to the north, Macomb Street to the east, and Gaines Street to the south.[95] The Westcott Building is the school's readily identifiable structure at College Avenue and S. Copeland Street.[96] The Westcott location is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida and is the home of Ruby Diamond Concert Hall which serves as the university's primary performance venue.[97][98][99]\n\nHistoric student housing residence halls include Broward, Bryan, Cawthon, Gilchrist, Jennie Murphree, Landis, and Reynolds and are located on the older eastern half of campus.[95][100] Newer residence hall complexes, Ragans and Wildwood, located near the athletic quadrant; and DeGraff Hall, located on Tennessee Street.[95]\n\nOn and around the Florida State University main campus are seven libraries: Robert Manning Strozier Library, Dirac Science Library named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Florida State University professor Paul Dirac, Claude Pepper Library, College of Music Allen Music Library, College of Law Research Center, College of Medicine Maguire Medical Library and the FAMU/FSU Engineering Library.[102] Strozier Library is located at the center of the campus and is open extended hours during Fall and Spring semesters.[103]\n\nNext to the Donald L. Tucker Center, the College of Law is between Jefferson Street and Pensacola Street.[95] The College of Business is in the heart of campus near the FSU Student Union and across from the HCB Classroom Building. The science and research quad is located in the northwest quadrant of the campus.[95] The College of Medicine, King Life Science buildings (biology) as well as the Department of Psychology are located on the west end of campus on Call Street and Stadium Drive.[95]\n\nLocated off Stadium Drive in the southwest quadrant is the University Center, which encloses Doak Campbell Stadium and Bobby Bowden Field.[95] The stadium seats 79,560 spectators.[105] Doak Campbell Stadium is contained within the brick facade walls of the University Center.[95] It is reportedly the largest continuous brick structure in the United States and one of the largest in the world.[106] The brick complex also houses offices of the university, the registrar,[107] the Dedman School of Hospitality,[108] and classrooms.[95]\n\nThe FSU Southwest Campus was acquired by the university in 1930 and was formerly known as \"The Farm\".[93][109] It encompasses another 740 acres (3.0 km2) of land off Orange Drive.[95][110] The southwest campus currently houses the Florida A&M University – Florida State University College of Engineering, which is housed in a two-building joint facility with Florida A&M University.
