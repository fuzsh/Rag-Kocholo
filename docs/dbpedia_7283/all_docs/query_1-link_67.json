New Mexico hosts the Opportunity Scholarship and the Lottery Scholarship, open to all New Mexico residents and new high school graduates.\n\nIvy League schools such as Princeton University, Harvard University and Yale University take things one step further by offering a completely free college education for students from families that make less than $100,000.\n\nStudents looking to pursue health professions also have options for tuition-free and completely free medical school and tuition-free nursing school.\n\nThe University of Olivet is one of a few nursing schools offering free tuition for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN). The university announced a free tuition scholarship for qualifying Registered Nurses (RNs) who would like to take online five 8-week terms to earn their BSN.\n\nThe university is addressing the national nursing shortage and adjusting to more employers requiring or strongly preferring nurses with bachelor's degrees.\n\nThe Albert Einstein College of Medicine announced it will give all students free tuition starting August 2024 and all current fourth-year students tuition reimbursement for the spring 2024 semester thanks to a $1 billion donation.\n\nIn most cases, students need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to qualify for free tuition and fees and, in some cases, the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile.\n\nStudents who may be undocumented, qualify under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), or qualify under the DREAM Act may not be eligible for the FAFSA. Instead, some states offer state financial aid applications to help these students with college financial aid.\n\nHere are some of the schools working to make college free for qualified students.\n\nColleges and Universities Offering Tuition-Free Degrees\n\nLast Updated: June 13, 2024 at 3:58 P.M.
