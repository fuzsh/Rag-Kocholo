        "text": "Introduction\n\nVideo of Waco at 25: as they remember it\n\nIn May 1992, ATF began an extensive investigation of David Koresh (a.k.a. Vernon Wayne Howell) and the Branch Davidians, a cult group residing on a large and rural property near Waco, Texas. ATF's investigation centered on Koresh and the Davidians being involved in the illegal manufacture and possession of machineguns and the illegal manufacture and possession of destructive devices, including bombs and grenades. ATF's investigation showed that the group acquired:\n\n136 firearms, including assault rifles and handguns\n\n700+ magazines for those firearms\n\n200,000+ rounds of ammunition\n\n110 upper and lower receivers for AR15/M16 rifles\n\nGrenade-launcher attachments for AR15/M16 rifles\n\n400+ empty M31 rifle grenades, along with black powder and other explosive chemicals\n\nThe investigation included: interviews with former cult members; inspection and interview of a federal firearms dealer; review of documentation showing the purchase of large quantities of AR-15 rifles, ammunition and inert grenades (which can be converted to live grenades); and records from interstate shippers. An ATF undercover agent became an associate member of the Davidians, although with limited access to their compound. Sufficient evidence was gathered to allow for the issuance of federal arrest and search warrants in February 1993, to arrest Koresh and search the compound.\n\nATF special agents from the Dallas, Houston and New Orleans Field Divisions were assigned to execute federal warrants at the Branch Davidian compound on February 28, 1993.\n\nVideo of Waco Interviews: A Retrospection 25 Years Later\n\nThe Davidians were alerted to the impending raid by a local postman, who was also a cult member. The heavily armed, cult members were waiting in ambush as the agents unloaded from their vehicles. Koresh was outside on the porch, as the agents approached telling him they had a search warrant and instructing him to \"get down,\" he retreated inside the house. Gunfire burst through the door, as the agents approached, one agent was wounded.\n\nAs a result of the 2 1/2 hour long gunfight, four ATF agents were killed; 20 ATF agents wounded from gunshots or shrapnel and eight agents suffered other injuries. A cease-fire followed and Koresh released 24 members (mostly children, but none of his own) from the compound. A 51-day stand-off ended when the Davidian Compound erupted in fire(s) set by cult members, as law enforcement attempted to force them out by introducing tear gas into the building on April 19. The fire destroyed the compound and more than 70 residents were killed, many from gunshot wounds apparently inflicted by fellow cult members. Nine cult members escaped the fire and were arrested, while eight of those members were later convicted in federal court on various firearms and/or other charges; and all were sentenced to various lengths of imprisonment.\n\nA subsequent investigation by the Departments of Treasury and Justice regarding the actions of law enforcement agents during the siege determined that some tactics and decisions were poorly executed; and certain actions by ATF were criticized. However, the September 1993 U.S. Department of Treasury Administrative Review concluded: \"...the agency is made up of dedicated, committed and experienced professionals, who have regularly demonstrated sound judgment and remarkable courage in enforcing the law. ATF has a history of success in conducting complex investigations and executing dangerous and challenging law enforcement missions. That fine tradition, together with the line agents' commitment to the truth and their courage and determination has enabled ATF to provide our country with a safer and more secure nation under law.\""
