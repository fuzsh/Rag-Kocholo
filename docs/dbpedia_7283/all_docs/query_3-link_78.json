        "text": "The Internet has become a prominent part of every day life. From searching for recipes to make dinner to buying new products for your bedroom to watching your favorite shows, the Internet has become an integral part of our daily routines.\n\nBut it hasn’t always been as refined as it is today. The Internet timeline is an intricate and complex development that has led to the Internet as we know it today.\n\nKeep reading to learn a brief history of the Internet. And don’t forget to subscribe to our newsleter for the latest information on all things digital marketing!\n\n1969: Arpanet\n\nArpanet was the first real network to run on packet switching technology (new at the time).\n\nOn October 29, 1969, computers at Stanford and UCLA connected for the first time. In effect, they were the first hosts on what would one day become the Internet. The first message sent across the network was supposed to be “Login”, but reportedly, the link between the two colleges crashed on the letter “g”.\n\n1969: Unix\n\nAnother major milestone during the 60’s was the inception of Unix: the operating system whose design heavily influenced that of Linux and FreeBSD (the operating systems most popular in today’s web servers/web hosting services).\n\n1970: Arpanet network\n\nAn Arpanet network was established between Harvard, MIT, and BBN (the company that created the “interface message processor” computers used to connect to the network) in 1970.\n\n1971: Email\n\nEmail was first developed in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson, who also made the decision to use the “@” symbol to separate the user name from the computer name (which later on became the domain name).\n\n1971: Project Gutenberg and eBooks\n\nOne of the most impressive developments of 1971 was the start of Project Gutenberg. Project Gutenberg, for those unfamiliar with the site, is a global effort to make books and documents in the public domain available electronically–for free–in a variety of eBook and electronic formats.\n\nIt began when Michael Hart gained access to a large block of computing time and came to the realization that the future of computers wasn’t in computing itself, but in the storage, retrieval and searching of information that, at the time, was only contained in libraries.\n\nHe manually typed (no OCR at the time) the “Declaration of Independence” and launched Project Gutenberg to make information contained in books widely available in electronic form. In effect, this was the birth of the eBook.\n\n1972: CYCLADES\n\nFrance began its own Arpanet-like project in 1972, called CYCLADES. While Cyclades was eventually shut down, it did pioneer a key idea: the host computer should be responsible for data transmission rather than the network itself.\n\n1973: The first trans-Atlantic connection and the popularity of emailing\n\nArpanet made its first trans-Atlantic connection in 1973, with the University College of London. During the same year, email accounted for 75% of all Arpanet network activity.\n\n1974: The beginning of TCP/IP\n\n1974 was a breakthrough year. A proposal was published to link Arpa-like networks together into a so-called “inter-network”, which would have no central control and would work around a transmission control protocol (which eventually became TCP/IP).\n\n1975: The email client\n\nWith the popularity of emailing, the first modern email program was developed by John Vittal, a programmer at the University of Southern California in 1975. The biggest technological advance this program (called MSG) made was the addition of “Reply” and “Forward” functionality.\n\n1977: The PC modem\n\n1977 was a big year for the development of the Internet as we know it today. It’s the year the first PC modem, developed by Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, was introduced and initially sold to computer hobbyists.\n\n1978: The Bulletin Board System (BBS)\n\nThe first bulletin board system (BBS) was developed during a blizzard in Chicago in 1978.\n\n1978: Spam is born\n\n1978 is also the year that brought the first unsolicited commercial email message (later known as spam), sent out to 600 California Arpanet users by Gary Thuerk.\n\n1979: MUD – The earliest form of multiplayer games\n\nThe precursor to World of Warcraft and Second Life was developed in 1979, and was called MUD (short for MultiUser Dungeon). MUDs were entirely text-based virtual worlds, combining elements of role-playing games, interactive, fiction, and online chat.\n\n1979: Usenet\n\n1979 also ushered into the scene: Usenet, created by two graduate students. Usenet was an internet-based discussion system, allowing people from around the globe to converse about the same topics by posting public messages categorized by newsgroups.\n\n1980: ENQUIRE software\n\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research (better known as CERN) launched ENQUIRE (written by Tim Berners-Lee), a hypertext program that allowed scientists at the particle physics lab to keep track of people, software, and projects using hypertext (hyperlinks).\n\n1982: The first emoticon\n\nWhile many people credit Kevin MacKenzie with the invention of the emoticon in 1979, it was Scott Fahlman in 1982 who proposed using 🙂 after a joke, rather than the original -) proposed by MacKenzie. The modern emoticon was born.\n\n1983: Arpanet computers switch over to TCP/IP\n\nJanuary 1, 1983 was the deadline for Arpanet computers to switch over to the TCP/IP protocols developed by Vinton Cerf. A few hundred computers were affected by the switch. The name server was also developed in ’83.\n\n1984: Domain Name System (DNS)\n\nThe domain name system was created in 1984 along with the first Domain Name Servers (DNS).\n\nThe domain name system was important in that it made addresses on the Internet more human-friendly compared to its numerical IP address counterparts. DNS servers allowed Internet users to type in an easy-to-remember domain name and then converted it to the IP address automatically.\n\n1985: Virtual communities\n\n1985 brought the development of The WELL (short for Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link), one of the oldest virtual communities still in operation.\n\nIt was developed by Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant in February of ’85. It started out as a community of the readers and writers of the Whole Earth Review and was an open but “remarkably literate and uninhibited intellectual gathering”.\n\nWired Magazine once called The Well “The most influential online community in the world.”\n\n1986: Protocol wars\n\nThe so-called Protocol wars began in 1986. European countries at that time were pursuing the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), while the United States was using the Internet/Arpanet protocol, which eventually won out.\n\n1987: The Internet grows\n\nBy 1987, there were nearly 30,000 hosts on the Internet. The original Arpanet protocol had been limited to 1,000 hosts, but the adoption of the TCP/IP standard made larger numbers of hosts possible.\n\n1988: IRC – Internet Relay Chat\n\nAlso in 1988, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was first deployed, paving the way for real-time chat and the instant messaging programs we use today.\n\n1988: First major malicious internet-based attack\n\nOne of the first major Internet worms was released in 1988. Referred to as “The Morris Worm”, it was written by Robert Tappan Morris and caused major interruptions across large parts of the Internet.\n\n1989: AOL is launched\n\nWhen Apple pulled out of the AppleLink program in 1989, the project was renamed and America Online was born. AOL later made the Internet popular amongst the average internet users.\n\n1989: The proposal for the World Wide Web\n\n1989 also brought about the proposal for the World Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nIt was originally published in the March issue of MacWorld, and then redistributed in May 1990. It was written to persuade CERN that a global hypertext system was in CERN’s best interest. It was originally called “Mesh”; the term “World Wide Web” was coined while Berners-Lee was writing the code in 1990.\n\n1990: First commercial dial-up ISP\n\n1990 also brought about the first commercial dial-up Internet provider, The World. The same year, Arpanet ceased to exist.\n\n1990: World Wide Web protocols finished\n\nThe code for the World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee, based on his proposal from the year before, along with the standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs.\n\n1990: The first search engine\n\nAlso in 1990, Alan Emtage, a college student in Montreal, created the first search engine for a school project. The search engine was known as the Archie Index.\n\n1990s: The first photo shared on the Internet\n\nRemember Tim Berners-Lee? He’s making waves again, sharing the first photo on the Internet. It featured a group of singers known as Les Horribles Cernettes.\n\n1991: First web page created\n\n1991 brought some major innovations to the world of the Internet. The first web page was created and, much like the first email explained what email was, its purpose was to explain what the World Wide Web was.\n\n1991: First content-based search protocol\n\nAlso in the same year, the first search protocol that examined file contents instead of just file names was launched, called Gopher.\n\n1991: MP3 becomes a standard\n\nAlso, the MP3 file format was accepted as a standard in 1991. MP3 files, being highly compressed, later become a popular file format to share songs and entire albums via the internet.\n\n1991: The first webcam\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of this era, though, was the first webcam. It was deployed at a Cambridge University computer lab, and its sole purpose was to monitor a particular coffee maker so that lab users could avoid wasted trips to an empty coffee pot.\n\n1993: Mosaic – first graphical web browser for the general public\n\nThe first widely downloaded Internet browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993. While Mosaic wasn’t the first web browser, it is considered the first browser to make the Internet easily accessible to non-techies.\n\n1993: Governments join in on the fun\n\nIn 1993, both the White House and the United Nations came online, marking the beginning of the .gov and .org domain names.\n\n1994: Netscape Navigator\n\nMosaic’s first big competitor, Netscape Navigator, was released the year following (1994).\n\n1994: The first secure ecommerce transaction\n\nWhere would the world be without ecommerce? We can trace secure online transactions back to 1994, when the first item was purchased securely online.\n\nThe item may have been a Sting CD, sold for $12.48 on Dan Kohn’s NetMarket. However, the Internet Shopping Network suggests they completed an online transaction for computer equipment a month prior to this CD purchase.\n\n1995: Commercialization of the Internet\n\nFollowing the first secure Internet transactions, 1995 is often considered the first year the web became commercialized.\n\nWhile there were commercial enterprises online prior to ’95, there were a few key developments that happened that year. First, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption was developed by Netscape, making it safer to conduct financial transactions (like credit card payments) online.\n\nIn addition, two major online businesses got their start the same year. The first sale on “Echo Bay” was made that year. Echo Bay later became eBay. Amazon.com also started in 1995, though it didn’t turn a profit for six years, until 2001.\n\n1995: The development of cryptocurrency\n\nWhat better way to complement ecommerce than with the invention of cryptocurrency? David Chaum, a computer scientist and cryptographer, created DigiCash in 1995, which went on to pave the way for Bitcoin and other forms of digital money.\n\n1995: Geocities, the Vatican goes online, and JavaScript\n\nOther major developments that year included the launch of Geocities (which officially closed down on October 26, 2009). The Vatican also went online for the first time. Java and JavaScript (originally called LiveScript by its creator, Brendan Eich, and deployed as part of the Netscape Navigator browser – see comments for explanation) was first introduced to the public in 1995. ActiveX was launched by Microsoft the following year.\n\n1996: First web-based (webmail) service\n\nIn 1996, HoTMaiL (the capitalized letters are an homage to HTML), the first webmail service, was launched.\n\n1996: The creation of social media\n\nBeyond webmail, the Internet also gets more social in 1996 with the creation of the first social media platform. Andrew Weinreich created Six Degrees, which features all our favorite social media hallmarks, including individual profiles and connections with friends.\n\n1997: The invention of Wi-Fi\n\nToday, Wi-Fi is almost synonymous with the Internet, and we can trace its official creation back to 1997.
