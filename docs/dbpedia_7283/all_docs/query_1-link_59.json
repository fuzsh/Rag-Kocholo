        "text": "The Geneva Center\n\nSeminole State College's Geneva Center is now home to Seminole County's only fully operational Public Safety Training Complex and Driving Track. All the law enforcement officers in Seminole County – more than 1,000 – will train at the Center at least once a year. Another 200 Seminole State criminal justice students will use the facility each year.\n\nFor years, Seminole County law enforcement officers and Seminole State students trained in closed parking lots or at police academies in other counties. Seminole State identified a need for an improved, convenient training facility and partnered with Seminole County and the cities of Altamonte Springs, Casselberry, Lake Mary, Longwood, Oviedo, Sanford and Winter Springs in 2005 to develop the Geneva Center. Together, the county and cities donated more than $250,000 to help fund the new classroom building at Geneva, funds that were matched by the state."
