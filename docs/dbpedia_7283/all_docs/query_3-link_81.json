        "text": "Any way you look at it, 1993 was a whirlwind year. As a nation we got to know a new president, and as a state we strengthened through rebuilding from Hurricane Andrew _ 1993 brought turmoil and triumph, both locally and nationally.\n\nSome surprising events found their ways onto the calendar. Michael Jackson, the guru of goodness, was dethroned by horrific accusations of child abuse, while the leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, was exalted for his efforts for world peace _ talk about turning the tables.\n\nWe made a list of the things and people that we found important and broke them up into four categories. We put together some of the things you may not find in People or Time, but in our world Beavis is just about as important as Clinton _ and football is just as important as the French democracy.\n\nNotable events of 1993: Michael Jackson's child abuse charges; Hurricane Andrew recovery; Bill Clinton's first year as president; Kanika's first year of college; Michael Jordan dips on the National Basketball Association; Jurassic Park makes dinosaurs look cool; Chicago Bulls three-peat, winning their third successive NBA title; Florida State wins a national college football championship; Toni Morrison wins the Nobel Prize in literature; the PLO and Israel sign a peace agreement; Gators win the SEC; Charlie Ward wins the Heisman trophy (and the heart of every woman in Tallahassee); Leon successfully makes a pot roast; Fan Man makes history by dropping in on the Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe fight.\n\nNotable things that didn't happen in 1993 but should have: Holyfield and Bowe double up on Fan Man (now, even we would have paid to see that); Elvis not sighted at Burger King wearing cut-off shorts and flip-flops; Taco Bell makes Wild Sauce a permanent part of its menu (Ewww!); Jimmie \"J. J.\" Walker makes a comeback; Shaquille O'Neal is chosen as an All-Star player (will he ever get his props?); For What It's Worth gets syndicated nationally; Rush Limbaugh gets a life; Madonna shuts up.\n\nSome things that never change _ whether it's 1973 or 1993: Watching Miracle On 34th Street makes you kinda believe Santa Claus is real (You're kidding, Kanika); YMCA IS STILL A HIT! (I don't know what radio station you're listening to, Leon!); report cards always come right before a long vacation; Chick-Fil-A samples always taste better than the real sandwich; the good girls always fall for the no-good, trouble-making, unemployed, beer-drinking, arm-wrestling, womanizing guys (Leon, my guy doesn't fit that description); good guys always want \"to just be friends\" or \"take time out to find themselves.\" (What? Kanika, that's the oldest line in the book: \"find themselves.\"); all your socks are never there when you fold your laundry; Fred Flintstone's suit; Doritos make your breath stink; church is crowded on Easter.\n\nSome surprising things that happened during 1993! Tina Turner, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton were played at live parties, and well received!; Oprah lost the weight and kept it off! Way to Go Big O!; Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett got married.\n\nWell, that's our list; did it match yours? We know it didn't match People's or Time's, but in a lot of ways we think our list is representative of much of teenage America. We're old enough to understand the importance of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel signing a peace treaty, yet we're young enough to chill out with a good episode of Beavis and Butt-Head. Yeah, this is a stage of life that we can definitely deal with.\n\nKanika Jelks is a freshman at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee. Leon M. Tucker is a sophomore at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Got a problem for Kanika and Leon? Call Timesline (numbers are on 2D), punch category 8970 and leave a message."
