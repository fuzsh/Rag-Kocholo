        "text": "Our experience at the Geneva School has been nothing but amazing. We have two children at this school and we are constantly amazed at how much they are learning. They come home singing songs, reciting scripture, and teaching us about things that happened in history that I never learned in elementary school! This school has a rigorous and well-rounded curriculum that expertly incorporates and intertwines math, literature, history, science, art, and music for a rich learning experience for our kids. Not only does this school care about how my child is doing academically, but they are equally, if not more, invested in my child's spiritual well-being and growth as a loving and truth-seeking Christian. This school is teaching solid Biblical truth, which is rare to find at many Christian schools these days."
