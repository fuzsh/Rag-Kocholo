        "text": "Advertisements\n\nHello! We are future Florida residents who are looking for opinions from parents, friends, etc. about their experience with Christians schools in the Orlando metro area. During a recent visit to Orlando we stopped by Masters Academy (Oviedo, FL) and really liked the school. We didn't visit Geneva School (Winter Park, FL), but after watching their videos online, we would like to visit them and learn more about them.\n\nDo you have experience with any of these schools? Or Both? What was/is the experience for your child? Is there any other Christian school that is comparable to these too, but closer to Orlando/Kissimmee that you recommend?\n\nThank you for your advice and recommendations. We want to narrow our choices of schools to facilitate where to look to buy a home. Have a great day."
