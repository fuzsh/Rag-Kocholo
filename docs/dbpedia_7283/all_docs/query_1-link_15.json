        "text": "Advertisements\n\nHello,\n\nJust looking at private schools. I'm not opposed to a Christian school as long as they welcome children of all religions, my primary concern is with the quality of education. I toured the First Academy and they interjected mentions of Jesus and God in all conversations with me, basically singing praises through the entire tour. I wasn't sure if that's really how it is there, or if they were trying to make a point to someone who was not religious or of a different religion. I toured another Christian private school in central Florida and you would have thought it was a secular school.\n\nI'm interested in learning about the Geneva School and other similar private schools in central Florida, but I'm trying to understand where my children are actually welcome and which private Christian schools are more moderate in their emphasis on religion. I don't have time to tour them all. Can anyone give some insight?\n\nThanks!"
