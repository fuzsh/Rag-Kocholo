        "text": "Young\n\nI think we’re ready to begin. We’re very pleased to have this oral history interview for the Clinton Presidential Oral History Project with Secretary Warren Christopher and Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott. I’ve asked both these gentlemen how they should be addressed and Strobe Talbott suggested His Excellency. Mr. Christopher suggested Chris, if it serves our purposes. Our purpose is informality and candor. So, the deference and respect is still there even though the first name is used.\n\nIn our little get together before the meeting, we did go over the ground rules. Just let me repeat that everybody in this room understands our policies in this project, which means that nothing said in this room goes out of the room until such time as each of the respondents has a chance to review the transcript, edit it to his satisfaction, and make such stipulations as he wishes concerning the time of its release.\n\nWe also discussed generally what we’d like to cover in the interview. Chris and Strobe are both flexible. We like to have free-flowing discussion, but we have to start someplace. I have asked Strobe about the possibility of a further interview concentrating on areas that will not get covered here, and he is agreeable to our working that out at a convenient time for him. We’ll see how far we go today in this duo.\n\nIf you’d like to say a few words at the beginning, I think we’ll dispense with the voice ID, we’ll get that sooner or later, I think. If you’d like to start with how you got connected with the Clinton administration. We’ve read your accounts in the book, which seem pretty complete, but there may be something you’d like to add to that. We can start there or you can start way back to your entry into politics.\n\nChristopher\n\nJim, I guess your question raises a question in my mind, that is, if something is said in the book, it’s not necessary for me to say it here?\n\nYoung\n\nYes, I think you can assume we have read what’s in the book so you needn’t recount it, except those points you wish to give special emphasis to or add something to.\n\nChristopher\n\nMy involvement with the Clinton administration came, as so many things in my life, as a surprise, an unexpected development in my life. I had no idea I’d become so deeply involved in the Clinton administration. As I do recount in the book, my friend Mickey Kantor asked me if I would introduce then-Governor Clinton at a fundraising endeavor in California, and because I’d been convinced over the prior three months that Governor Clinton was the best of the available candidates, I agreed to introduce him. So much flowed from that particular evening that came as an unexpected surprise. It surprised me that growing out of my very brief contacts with Governor Clinton at an event at Kantor’s house, coupled with that evening, they asked me to become involved in, and ultimately to head, the search for the Vice President.\n\nSo, as I say, Jim, my involvement was unexpected and a surprise, and the depth of it came to surprise me, and it does even in retrospect.\n\nYoung\n\nDo you have any clue as to why Clinton would have chosen you for the Vice Presidential vetting?\n\nChristopher\n\nProbably a large factor was Mickey Kantor’s recommendation. Kantor and I had just finished working on the very large study called the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department following the Rodney King episode, and I think Clinton also liked the time we spent together in Los Angeles. I understood he liked my introduction at the fund-raiser and he and I spent about an hour talking in the afternoon in which he, in his usual way, drained me dry of all the memories I had about working for other Presidents.\n\nYoung\n\nWas he easy to get to know or difficult, just for these first contacts?\n\nChristopher\n\nHe is one of the easiest people to be with that you can possibly imagine. He has all the skills of a very expert and experienced politician coupled with a kind of personal grace that always makes you feel, when you’re talking to him, like you are the most important person in the world.\n\nRiley\n\nCould you tell us a little bit about your relationship with Mickey Kantor and how did you first come to know him and to develop confidence in his sense of Clinton’s suitability to be President?\n\nChristopher\n\nMickey Kantor and I were fellow lawyers in Los Angeles and had been involved together in various aspects of Los Angeles civic life. He and I were both informal advisors to Tom Bradley, the five-term mayor of Los Angeles, really a gigantic figure in Los Angeles. I came to know Mickey Kantor in the way that you probably do your close colleagues, somebody you work with and over time come to admire. We were not intimate friends, but we were good friends and had worked together in enough causes so that I had quite a lot of confidence in him. His background in public interest law was impressive to me.\n\nBut I would have to say that my opinion of Clinton was not primarily dependent upon Mickey Kantor, but my own evaluation as it grew toward the end of 1991 and into 1992. In addition, I agreed to introduce him because I felt in a sense obligated to Kantor for the support he’d given me in connection with the Independent Commission. That was a very tough struggle. Mickey’s help to me in obtaining unanimous commission support for the reforms we recommended and for the removal of Chief [Daryl F.] Gates was something that I felt very warm about, and so when he asked me to do this introduction, it was not entirely a sense of my political judgment but also sense of personal obligation.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nYou and Bill Clinton were almost like opposite figures. I mean, in a sense, here’s a young, untested Governor from Arkansas who is sort of meteor-like on the national stage, although a lot of people did know him but didn’t know him very well. You’d been through all the Washington wars, with the Justice Department, with Cy [Cyrus] Vance and all the rest. Your ages were very dissimilar at this particular time. Did you have a sense—I don’t want to ask you to psychoanalyze the President, maybe Strobe has got an idea about this—that he was kind of consciously maybe or unconsciously seeking to align himself with some establishment figure who had all of the credentials and so forth that he did not have at that particular time?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, as you implied, Don, we were, and are, quite different people. So it was a source of some surprise and amazement to me that we hit it off as well as we did. I think our working relationship was primarily established in connection with the search for the Vice President. I had watched Vice Presidents in the time that I had in government before. I watched the progression from the very distant relationship between [John F.] Kennedy and [Lyndon] Johnson, which I didn’t know nearly as well. I was not close to Kennedy. But I nevertheless observed it when I was working with Undersecretary of State George Ball.\n\nThen I observed the difficult relationship between Johnson and [Hubert] Humphrey. It was perhaps less distant than the relationship between Johnson and Kennedy, that is, the relationship between Johnson and Humphrey blew hot and cold. But then, I’ve also observed the relationship between [Jimmy] Carter and [Walter] Mondale, which was light-years different. Carter gave Mondale an office in the White House and brought him into the councils of government to a much greater degree than Humphrey had been, but not, I thought, to what I would regard as the ideal partnership, working relationship. And so, in my conversations with Governor Clinton in trying to describe the process we would go about and how he should formulate the criteria for a running mate, I was aided by having observed these progressions of closer and closer relationships and thinking it had not reached its epitome by any means, had still some distance to go. And I think that was helpful in my discussions.\n\nI remember one night as we were fairly far into it, Governor Clinton asked me if I would, at our next meeting, describe to him what I thought the ideal relationship between the President and the Vice President should be, and I did that at the next meeting. I can perhaps sum it up by saying, I thought it should be Mondale plus.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nSo do you think that that discussion set the tone in the relationship between the two of you from then on?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, the first meeting I had with President Clinton, with Governor Clinton on the subject of the Vice Presidency took place in Tallahassee, Florida, when Kantor and I flew down to meet with him at breakfast after he had come in from a run and after a preceding day and night of campaigning. At that time, I outlined what I thought should be the procedure and we then discussed who should be on the list of people to be interviewed. I think that meeting, as much as anything, Don, set the tone for how we would operate in the future. He listened very intently, very carefully, to how I thought the procedure should work, and then we turned to names. We had a list of names and he added and subtracted.\n\nI found in that meeting a willingness on his part to listen, to make changes, to make adjustments, but then to give me a fairly broad degree of discretion within the parameters that he had laid out. That meeting set a tone for our subsequent relationship. I found out that I could have confidence that if he once blessed a general process that he would stick by it and that he would follow it carefully. He’d listen to all my reports, subsequently, with great care but he didn’t try to micromanage the process once he had signed off.\n\nYoung\n\nThis is somewhat of a diversion, but could you compare that with President Carter, the delegation? You were managing the hostage crisis, the hostage release negotiations. Was that a similar relationship where he would delegate and give you a fairly free hand and listen intently? Was Bill Clinton very different in this respect, just from this one little incident?\n\nChristopher\n\nJim, I felt I had broad discretion within parameters on the hostage crisis as well. Negotiations were moving very rapidly, especially in those last 13 days in Algiers, and the whole approach was changed in the last week. I felt confident that President Carter would adjust to a difference in the approach. So I would not make a differentiation between the degree of delegation in that particular instance, but I would say that in general President Carter was considerably more detail oriented than President Clinton was.\n\nYoung\n\nThat helps. Did the idea—was it Governor Clinton’s idea—did he propose to you or suggest to you the Vice Presidential assignment, or did you propose it to him, or suggest to him that this was something you would need to address? How did it start? At his initiative or at your prompting?\n\nChristopher\n\nIt was certainly not at my prompting. I think it was a combination of Mickey Kantor talking to him about it and then Mickey’s relaying to me Governor Clinton’s desire that I proceed and that we come to Tallahassee and lay out the project.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWhat about the next step? I mean, you did the transition, did it just sort of logically flow out of the Vice Presidential thing, or was that a surprise as well? Now you knew him a bit better.\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, the Vice Presidential selection went on over a period of time, as you know. We formed this list, I think of 38 people, and the narrower list was a list of 15 on whom detailed memoranda were done. I reported to President Clinton as we went along on how those memoranda were coming, the development of them as well as the interviews, so by the time we reached that decision, we’d spent quite a lot of time together.\n\nIn connection with the transition, I was in Little Rock for the last week before the election itself, when there was a growing confidence as to how the election might come out. But at that time there had been no decision made as to who would head the transition. Mickey Kantor had enlisted the general counsel of Occidental Petroleum to take a leave to begin the planning of the transition, and he had done a lot of good work, his name was Gerald Stern. I was there in Little Rock basically to consult on general transition matters. As you know, at that time the leadership of the transition became controversial—as in many campaigns, there are controversies within the campaign. So it was a surprise to me when after the President was elected he resolved the contention between his staff members by moving outside of the staff and asking Vernon Jordan and me to head the transition.\n\nThat came about unexpectedly and again, as the product, I think, of Governor Clinton, then President-elect Clinton, being hesitant to move in the direction of either one of his staff persons.\n\nRiley\n\nCould we focus, before getting completely into the transition a little more, on the Vice Presidential selection process. You said that there were 38, thirty-some-odd people that were on the original list. Do you recall being surprised by either the way the list was put together or any individual names on that list? And I guess the same question would hold true for the more refined list of 15 or so.\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, it was an intensely interesting experience for me to sit there that morning in Tallahassee with President Clinton and two or three of his key traveling party and Mickey Kantor. Mickey and I had formed sort of a checklist of names to be considered. We weren’t presumptuous enough to want to make that the list, but rather we suggested here are some names that ought to be considered. So the strike-ons and strike-offs were very interesting. I would say, Russell, that the principal additions to the list were people outside of my ken, people who the Governor had known in politics or people in minority groups who he wanted to make sure were interviewed during that period. So it was a real educational process for me.\n\nBut without too much self congratulation here, I think the key names on the list and the list of the 15 didn’t involve very many surprises. I’d looked at all of the names that had been mentioned. You know many people had their name mentioned as possible, in this magazine or that magazine. I tried to assess what the most likely names were in the period before I went to Tallahassee. So we were pretty well centered on those who were the greatest possibilities.\n\nI want to ask, as we stand here, if Strobe Talbott remembers anything about that period and the Vice Presidential selection process from his friendship with Governor Clinton.\n\nTalbott\n\nNo, Chris, quite simply I don’t, for the simple reason that I was almost hermetically sealed off. In due course, probably when we have our own free-standing discussion, I’ll give you the kind of counterpart answers to the ones you heard from Chris about my own association with the President, which goes back much earlier.\n\nBut during the ’92 experience, I was recused from being involved in the campaign because I was still functioning as a journalist and had an understanding with Governor Clinton that we would talk from time to time, but not about politics or the campaign. We made exceptions once or twice when the subject was Russia and we can come to that in due course. Also, my wife was working full time for Hillary’s [Clinton] part of the campaign. But I had absolutely no interchange with him or indeed with anybody else on all of that.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nChris, one thing you said a minute ago made me sit up in my chair, when you mentioned people who had been mentioned by magazines and so forth. There is in Washington, as Strobe knows, what we call the great mentioner as to who gets mentioned. I never thought that it had any effect at all, but it seems like it had some effect in putting these people on a list.\n\nChristopher\n\nWell if the great mentioner mentioned somebody, I didn’t want Governor Clinton to think I hadn’t done my homework, so if the great mentioner had mentioned somebody I would say to him, Do you want him on or off the list?\n\nOberdorfer\n\nDid you all have somebody, some student or aide or somebody compile who had been mentioned by different publications?\n\nChristopher\n\nWhat is this some student or aide? I was doing this myself. [laughter]\n\nOberdorfer\n\nSo you had to go through, or you went through magazines and newspapers and clipped out who—\n\nChristopher\n\nSure. One likes to get prepared. If I was going into a meeting that was, you know, going to be part of history, I burned a little midnight oil.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you, in preparation for this, consult with others who had been responsible for Vice Presidential selection in the past?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, I benefited greatly from talking with the lawyer who had been advisor to Governor [Michael] Dukakis and he was generous to share with me the process that he had gone through. And I read some books on the Vice Presidential selection process as well.\n\nYoung\n\nDo you think Clinton was looking for somebody in the Vice Presidency with Washington experience? Was that very important to him, did you think? Not the only factor, but a factor that weighed since he himself had no Washington connection?\n\nChristopher\n\nHe regarded it as a plus, but he never laid that down as an absolute criterion.\n\nKnott\n\nYou mentioned in your book that you defied conventional wisdom by selecting—you know, you have a presidential candidate from Arkansas, a Vice Presidential candidate from Tennessee—did you wrestle with that one? So far as the lack of any regional balance?\n\nChristopher\n\nYou know, we have a pronoun problem here. I didn’t make those decisions, the Governor made them, but I recommended to him that I thought factor had been overweighed in prior times, that I regarded an attempt to balance the ticket as old think. Especially with the advent of television in which a candidate becomes known almost instantaneously. The important thing is to have the right ingredients there when they become known and not try to make either geographical or ideological balance the principal criterion, or a principal criterion.\n\nNaftali\n\nWhen did you meet Hillary Clinton?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, if you talk about formally meeting Hillary Clinton, I can’t say, but I first met with her in a working relationship when we began the Cabinet selection process. I had formerly met with her, no, of course that’s not true—obviously we’ll correct this record, I met with her first in connection with the Vice Presidential selection.\n\nNaftali\n\nThat’s what I was—\n\nChristopher\n\nIn which she was in one or two of the meetings and was in around the edges at least of the final evening where the running-mate choice was made. So I had met her then.\n\nNaftali\n\nDid you talk with her about this, or again was she just simply in the room, perhaps adding a comment here and there?\n\nChristopher\n\nIt was a group discussion in which she participated, but I would say in quite a reserved way. I always assumed that she had other opportunities to make her point.\n\nRiley\n\nThere were other members of a committee, or co-chairs. Did the other two co-chairs play a role similar to your own, or—?\n\nYoung\n\nThat was Vernon Jordan and Madeleine Kunin.\n\nChristopher\n\nThey played the role of advisors and played a very strong supportive role, but I interviewed every one of the potential candidates with one exception. Vernon Jordan interviewed Colin Powell. From my days as a trial lawyer, litigation lawyer, I had developed a strong sense of wanting to see face-to-face, go eyeball-to-eyeball with the people who I would be recommending to the President-elect. So I really wanted to do that myself and I did, and I shared with Vernon and Madeleine the results of those interviews as we went along. So the Governor always had the benefit of their views through me and probably separately as well. On at least one occasion Vernon and I flew to a city where the Governor was campaigning to give our report to him.\n\nYou know, it’s hard to remember how intense the time pressures are in campaigns and how little time the candidate has even for an important thing as Vice Presidential selection. So my reports to him were made usually at the end of a long day of campaigning when he would set aside some time to meet with me and I would go to wherever he was on the campaign trail. And Vernon, I recall, at one time did that. So they were heavily involved as members of the committee, but wanting to do the interviews myself, I did.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you have any recollections of any historically important information from those conversations that you had that would be important to get on the record? I know you had brief characterizations in your book, but I didn’t know whether there were some things that you thought at the time you might not want to publish that now would be the appropriate time to talk about. Any candidates reluctant to proceed? Conversations that you had about their sense about the viability of the campaign? Things of that nature.\n\nChristopher\n\n[long silence] I believe that I have recorded most of the things that I would be prepared to say now. I was disappointed, as I think you can see from the book, by Bill Bradley’s reaction and his reluctance to have it known that he was going to be interviewed and his considerable hesitation to become involved in the process. Now, with the advantage of some more years of development, I think you can see that he has assayed a number one position for himself, which is not to be criticized, and that he was trying to evaluate whether this might be a step forward or not for him. It also, I think, bore out that the sense of his being somebody who felt comfortable in being a loner.\n\nThe hesitance of Senator [Jay] Rockefeller to participate I thought was quite a different category. He thought that he had family obligations that precluded his running, but he was quite open in wrestling with it and being a very helpful advisor on the whole process. And I recorded the conversations I had with Governor [Mario] Cuomo, which indicated his reluctance to have any further analysis made of his own record.\n\nNaftali\n\nLet me ask—\n\nYoung\n\nGo ahead, Tim.\n\nNaftali\n\nBefore we move on to Cabinet selection, I’d like to ask you a bit about that early conversation with the Governor where he drained you of your historical knowledge. It’s always interesting to know the lessons that leaders derive from their predecessors and I was wondering—what kinds of historical questions was he interested in? What were his concerns? As he was thinking about the presidency, which he might or might not win—he’s a reader and he has quite a strong interest in history. So what was he interested in? What was he asking about?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, he was particularly interested in President Johnson and how it was to work for President Johnson, how President Johnson had achieved the legislative victories that he had. You know, President Clinton, as Strobe can tell you in much more graphic detail than I can, President Clinton absorbs information and you quite often don’t know what purpose he’s absorbing it for. Part of it is just his tremendous curiosity, but also he’s taking it on board. So he asked me about the working relationship that I had with Johnson, whether there were difficult times and how Johnson approached legislative issues. How Johnson felt about the riots. So we went over the working relationship. He seemed particularly curious about that. More curious than he was about Carter.\n\nNaftali\n\nDid he ask about Vietnam at all? About foreign policy and how that affects Presidents?\n\nChristopher\n\nWe did not talk about specific issues. It was talking about style and attitudes and approach to the presidency.\n\nRiley\n\nStrobe, in your conversations with him was he asking you questions about historical knowledge of the presidency also? Were your conversations completely family matters and things of that nature?\n\nTalbott\n\nAside from personal connections, he associated me with one issue and one country and that was Russia, and it was really only on that subject that he ever got below the surface.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay.\n\nTalbott\n\nHe was always interested in basically two aspects of whatever the Russia issue of the day was. One was what was the trend, was the move away from the Soviet Union reversible or not? He was interested in that for both historical reasons and also because it had a direct bearing on the viability of his own campaign. And second, how the administration of the day was handling it, which is to say he was interested in my assessment of the Bush administration’s response.\n\nBut I want to stress that really, these were exceptions that prove the no-substance rule, and the only two that I recall were, one, even before he announced his candidacy, which was in August ’91—shortly before he announced his candidacy when the attempted coup took place in Moscow, and the second was in October. No, actually there were three. The second was in late March, early April of ’92, when the question was how should he use a speech he was going to be giving in New York on aid to Russia where he sensed both that there was a strategic opportunity with Russia and a political opportunity vis-à-vis Bush. And the third was in October of ’92 when he was getting wind that there might be an October surprise: the Bush administration would pull off a strategic arms reduction agreement that would furnish Bush with his credentials as a foreign policy President. So one topic.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay.\n\nYoung\n\nSo let’s get back to the transition, turn back. Here’s a new President without much Washington experience on his own account, who has a short amount of time to form a government, so to speak, and your role in that, but also your observations of that transition, because Cabinet selection isn’t the whole story of forming a government. There’s also the question of your own staff and the policy preparation.\n\nThe reputation, of course, among many analysts is that it was a pretty chaotic transition as a way of forming a government, and a lot of mistakes were made, not in forming a Cabinet but in other aspects of it. So, let’s start with your piece of that action and make sure that we’ve got that straight. Is it correct to say that your charter, in terms of advising him about the forming of this Cabinet, was more or less the same, and the relationship was more or less the same, as your charter to do the advising and investigating for the Vice Presidential selection?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, it had some similarities, Jim, but there were some important differences. In the Vice Presidential selection search we started with a finite number of people and did a lot of research on them and then narrowed the list and perhaps added a few as we went along, but very few. And that was quite a different process than was followed for the Cabinet selection. President Clinton did say, when he asked me to undertake that process, that he wanted the same kind of in-depth evaluation as had been applied to the Vice President—adapted, not applied, but adapted—to the search for the Cabinet. So as I’ve recorded, every Cabinet position was in effect a mini-search of a kind. The names were drawn from a half-day-long meeting, or a day-long meeting we would have on each Cabinet department, at which I would be the focal point in terms of taking notes. But the discussion would come from the President-elect and the Vice President-elect and other key advisors who were around the table in the den of the mansion in Little Rock.\n\nAnd so, in each instance we would get together a list of I would say between six and ten names and then apply in-depth research from the public record about those six to ten as a way of narrowing the list. So it had some similarities to the process of the Vice President, but nevertheless it was a process recreated for each Cabinet, each Cabinet list. It isn’t as if there was a pool of, say, a hundred names for all Cabinet positions. There was a separate list for each one.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd the consultative part of this with Clinton and with [Albert, Jr.] Gore? They were both involved?\n\nChristopher\n\nThey were both involved and attended religiously. The meetings wouldn’t happen unless they were there. There were others who were in those meetings, as I reported, but they were the key people. And Hillary attended many of those meetings as well.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you elaborate on the internal competition? This is something you touched on in the book about who would be the controlling force during the transition process, the Little Rock group and then others.\n\nYoung\n\nIs this with reference to the Cabinet selection?\n\nRiley\n\nYes, with the Cabinet selection and the overall formation of the government. With [George] Stephanopoulos and [James] Carville pushing one kind of agenda in competition with others. How were you dealing with that and how was that being manifest at this particular time?\n\nChristopher\n\nFirst of all, I was not in the campaign, as I’ve indicated to you. So I was blessedly saved from knowing first-hand all the internal strife and what camps were involved and who was up and who was down. So I might see things like that reflected, but I couldn’t say that I could perceive that in the Cabinet selection on a day-to-day basis. It clearly had been apparent in the decision of the President to ask Vernon Jordan and me from outside to head the transition rather than going with one or the other of the campaign staff. It was also apparent in the selection of the Chief of Staff of the White House and in the postponement of that selection, which as I recorded, I thought was one of the things that led to the criticism that you’ve mentioned, Jim, of the difficult start-up that he had. But it did not seem to affect the day-to-day discussions of choices of Cabinet members. As far as I could tell, there wasn’t a Stephanopoulos list of Cabinet members and somebody else’s list.\n\nRiley\n\nYou also touch on the fact—I think you touched on this. It may be that I’m confusing this with another of the readings, but the concern among some that there was a kind of allergy to people who had served in the Carter administration. Did you see much of that in the discussions that you were making? Did there seem to be a sense that at the Cabinet level, they wanted to move beyond that?\n\nChristopher\n\nThere was an interesting tension on that subject. There was a reluctance, I think, to overpopulate the Cabinet with people who had been, as you say, Jim, retreads. On the other hand, that’s where the experience lay. And so you always had to balance those two factors and I saw people almost consciously balancing those factors and thinking there had to be some new and creative ideas, but nevertheless hoping for somebody that would bring the experience of the earlier time.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWhen the job of Secretary of State—what you’ve written sort of suggests, at least in my reading of it, that it seemed like you’re talking, you present all these people and suddenly he turns to you and says, No— like Uncle Sam— I want you. But did you have any kind of idea beforehand from some comment he dropped, or just from knowing the general situation, that it might end up with you as the person?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, I was certainly surprised at the way it came about. I can’t honestly say that it never crossed my mind, but when I began the process of helping on the Cabinet I thought I had taken myself out of the Cabinet derby.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nHow did you do that?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, I said to the press that—or at least I have said since then, and said to the President-elect—that I could conduct this operation for him only if I wasn’t a candidate because I thought it might import a kind of a bias that went along the course of the process. He didn’t challenge that at the time that I first said it, but when he came to make the decision, he thought that was not something that should bind him.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nDid you think that you might want the job, or not? Did you ever ponder that question?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, I certainly wasn’t ready for the question when he posed it, but one tries in this kind of an oral history not to try to dupe history, and having been Deputy Secretary of State and having been disappointed once before, I can’t say that the thought never crossed my mind. It would be a little disingenuous for me to say that.\n\nYoung\n\nLooking at it more or less superficially and in retrospect, it almost seems halfway predictable that because there was a logical progression from the Vice Presidential search to the Cabinet search, to instill a new charter with the President—\n\nChristopher\n\nIt didn’t seem so to me at the time. [laughter] If you look at the list of people who were under consideration, it was a formidable list of people. It’s the best appointed job in the world, and there are quite a few people who would have been willing to do it.\n\nYoung\n\nI’m sure of that, but did Clinton or Gore know any of them? Or Clinton, as in the sense that he had come to know you and the nature of your work and the way you went about doing things.\n\nChristopher\n\nI think he knew many of them better than he knew me.\n\nYoung\n\nLet’s look at the list here.\n\nChristopher\n\nThat’s what I’m getting—\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWhere are we here?\n\nYoung\n\nWe’re looking at Chances of a Lifetime.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nI know that, what pages are—\n\nChristopher\n\nWe’re in the 170s.\n\nNaftali\n\n172.\n\nYoung\n\n[Samuel] Nunn wanted it, I understand.\n\nNaftali\n\nNunn, [Les] Aspin, [David] McCurdy, then McCurdy played the dirty trick.\n\nChristopher\n\nThen on page 175, the list included Colin Powell, whom he knew but not well; Lee Hamilton, who he knew quite well; Bill Bradley, who he knew less well; Paul Sarbanes, who he knew from Congress; David Boren, who he knew quite well; and Sam Nunn, who he knew very well from being in the Democratic, what is that, the new conservative—\n\nTalbott\n\nThe Democratic Leadership Council?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes.\n\nYoung\n\nDLC.\n\nChristopher\n\nHe knew me in a fairly narrow relationship, as someone who helped search for a Vice President.\n\nYoung\n\nBut he did have a working relationship with you, which he may not have had with some of the others.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nYou said here you spent a sleepless night thinking about the whole thing. What was the—what did you have to ponder, what was so difficult about it?\n\nChristopher\n\nI suppose it’s the nature of my personality, that however obvious a decision would be I would think I would have to go through it very carefully to reach it. Maybe it was obvious from the first moment that he asked that I would say yes, but I’ve been in government a lot, I’d imposed on my family a lot. I was far from a wealthy person, and I was—I had a rather settled pattern of life in California, so I had some weighty personal considerations to take into account.\n\nYoung\n\nBut it was an exciting prospect.\n\nChristopher\n\nIt was a very exciting prospect.\n\nYoung\n\nVery exciting, the first post-Cold War—okay.\n\nNaftali\n\nI just wanted to ask another personality question. At that time did you talk to Cyrus Vance as you were thinking about this? Were you in touch with him at this time?\n\nChristopher\n\nI talked only to my family. I didn’t feel that—I didn’t talk to anybody other than my family. It was a fairly sensitive piece of information.\n\nNaftali\n\nNo question.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nThat leads into another question and I don’t know if you want to move to this, but actually, from Tim’s question, when you’re thinking about the job, not only before it, but as you’re undertaking it, one usually has some kind of models as to what the job should be or how you should do it. You had been Cy Vance’s deputy and you saw him operate in the job for four years, or until he left and [Edmund] Muskie came in. Do you think that that was a model that was in your mind? Or, when you thought about how you were going to do the job as Secretary of State, was there some other way you were thinking of how to accomplish this important task?\n\nYoung\n\nCould I interrupt at this point and ask that question to stay right there for a moment and go back to the transition for a moment. You did record and did say in your books, that you felt it was a mistake that the selection of the White House—at least the Chief of Staff—was so long delayed, and that apparently the delay in the selection of the Chief of Staff or certain senior staff people in the White House was an impediment to a good start. Do you want to elaborate on that a little bit and explain why, why there was that delay? Did the President decide, I need a Cabinet before I need anybody else, or did he have problems selecting the White House staff? Was it a tactic, a strategy, or a dilemma for him?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, let me tell you first, Jim, why I think it’s important that the Chief of Staff be selected first. We have a unique system in our country, in which there is no continuing staff in the White House on a policy level. The President comes in and the offices are all vacant, the desks are clean, so the White House has to be staffed from the ground up. The time between election and inauguration, which was shortened for good reasons, doesn’t give the President and the Chief of Staff very much time to organize the White House and to get things running, so I think the President ought to choose the Chief of Staff as soon as possible, to start filling those offices and getting some papers on the desk so he can get his administration underway when January 20th comes. So every day that the Chief of Staff of the White House is not named is a big loss.\n\nNow, contrast that with the departments. The State Department, for example, is a continuing bureaucracy of not only size but talent. Any Secretary of State is going to rely very heavily on the Foreign Service and is going to find most of the offices filled and most of the desks heavy with paper except for the seventh floor. So I think the lead time is so much more easily managed in the departments than it is in the White House. There is a fundamental policy reason there now. The reason for the delay, and maybe you can ask President Clinton about this some time, but I think was primarily because of a delay in his formulating what kind of a structure he wanted in the White House and then who would be the key person.\n\nThere was a good deal of discussion at that time as to whether there should be any one Chief of Staff or whether he should try to operate on a kind of a roundtable system, like Franklin Roosevelt apparently did in an earlier day, or whether he should identify a Chief of Staff. That was fairly briskly resolved, I think, that there should be one. But then he had a great deal of difficulty coming to a decision and I think there was—at least as I viewed it from the outside in many conversations about it—some tension between wanting somebody who he knew well and was comfortable with on the one hand, and on the other hand somebody who had a lot of Washington experience and who could bring to it not so much personal familiarity with him as familiarity with the issues and personalities in Washington.\n\nThere was, in addition to that, the problem that when he made the decision for Chief of Staff he was making probably one person reasonably happy and also reasonably miserable, and several people unhappy for not having been chosen, or not having their nominee chosen.\n\nRiley\n\nDid he ask your opinion about these general structural matters, this sort of round table versus Chief of Staff?\n\nChristopher\n\nEverything was open, except the choice of the person he held pretty closely.\n\nRiley\n\nRight. And you advised him—can you tell us what your advice to him was on the general structural issue?\n\nChristopher\n\nI thought that there should be a single person, a single focal point. That’s primarily on the domestic side. There should—obviously, one person should be in charge of running the White House.\n\nYoung\n\nIn many administrations, his was no exception, there appears to be a competition within the campaign staff—I remember Carter’s quite well, Jack Watson versus Ham [Hamilton] Jordan. And the attempt to recruit people with Washington experience sometimes gets in the way of people who feel deserving, that they deserve it, that they were loyal in the campaign. And it is—I’m just trying to get your take on Clinton’s own thinking about that, as to whether he had a model or was up in the air about it for a while.\n\nChristopher\n\nI think he was up in the air about it. But ultimately he made the choice of somebody who he had a working relationship with, was comfortable with.\n\nYoung\n\nThere was also a tremendous turnover, looking ahead in the staff, in the White House staff. Very few long-term servers in there. Okay—\n\nRiley\n\nI wanted to ask about a couple of the appointments—\n\nYoung\n\nWe’re going to get back to Don’s question—\n\nOberdorfer\n\nThat’s all right\n\nRiley\n\nThis is still transition.\n\nYoung\n\nStill transition?\n\nRiley\n\nSo it’s before that, if—There are two or three items, one is—There was a question about Mickey Kantor’s appointment as Trade Rep, which you say was an inspired choice, and yet—\n\nChristopher\n\nI think I answered yes—\n\nRiley\n\nI didn’t realize my questioning was that awful. It’s not the first time I’ve cleared a room, by the way.\n\nChristopher\n\nThe question on the floor had to do with Mickey Kantor.\n\nRiley\n\nRight, thanks. Don, forgive me for dialing back and I promise we’ll come back to this, but the question about Mickey Kantor was, from the outside, it’s a little surprising that Clinton didn’t find a position for Kantor that would have placed him in more direct—I wouldn’t say greater responsibility, but maybe even a White House position, given how he had relied on Kantor, at least through your testimony, at certain key intervals during the campaign. I’m wondering if you would care to comment on that? Is it the case that the importance that he perceived NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] would have meant that he considered this a crucial appointment from his perspective, or—\n\nChristopher\n\nReputations in campaigns and in a time of tension like that tend to wane and wax and for reasons that I never fully understood, Mickey’s reputation was waning at that time. Carville and the others from that wing had become dominant in the last month of the campaign, and when Mickey was not made director of transition, a post with which he had some earlier identification, it was probably some indication that his reputation was at that point on the wane. So as we went through the Cabinet selection process, I was surprised to find that his name was not more prominently mentioned, but it wasn’t.\n\nHe might have been a candidate for Attorney General but it soon became clear to me that that position had been essentially committed intellectually to being a woman. So I was pleased and relieved when his name came up for Trade Representative; but it was more in the sense of matching his skills with the desire that he be in the Cabinet in an important position, rather than, I think, some evaluation as to the long term significance of the role of TR, Trade Representative.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay, you touched on the Attorney General appointment. One of the things that really is striking in looking at your discussion of what had happened, before even the Zoë Baird situation arose, is the extent to which the administration was having a tough time, as it were, pitching that position to some other prospective candidates. Could you comment on why it was so difficult for the administration to find someone who was interested in what, from the outside, would appear to be one of the plum positions of an administration?\n\nChristopher\n\nMy understanding was that Vernon Jordan, who would have been quite a clear and obvious choice, reached the conclusion that he did not want to come into the Cabinet and communicated that. After that had been communicated, the field was narrowed to women. Trying to find a leading Democratic woman who had experience at that level proved to be difficult. It was not so much that it was difficult to interest people in the position, but it was difficult finding people who met the qualifications.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is on 164 of Chances of a Lifetime, if I could probe, as you’re looking.\n\nChristopher\n\nYou go ahead and ask your question.\n\nRiley\n\nThe follow-up question was about Vernon Jordan’s decision that he didn’t want to be under consideration. Was that, do you know if that was a personal decision based on concerns about something like confirmation, or—\n\nChristopher\n\nI never knew exactly why Vernon took himself out. I think he felt that the entire process was such that he did not want to subject himself to it at that stage in his life. I was going to say, maybe here is a little piece of follow up for history if not of great importance, but I record on page 164 that Court of Appeals Justice Pat [Patricia] Wald was sounded out for the job and indicated a hesitance about it and concern about her retirement rights and sent word she wanted to be drafted. She, after my book came out, wrote me to say that that was not her attitude about it, saying in a not very aggressive or sharp way that it didn’t reflect her views.\n\nThat caused me to go back and look at my notes, and indeed I found I had received a call from someone who purported to speak on her behalf, taking exactly the position that I set forth on page 164. And when I wrote her that at some length, she wrote back courteously and pleasantly saying it’s amazing what people will say on your behalf. She didn’t disclaim the fact that this person, who had been quite an advocate of hers, had overstated her views. So I think it’s fair to her to say, and it’s not a very big point, that some of these things on page 164 didn’t reflect her views although she unquestionably was concerned about her retirement rights and wanted to have a special statute enacted.\n\nNow, she has had a very distinguished career both before and since. She wrote me from the Hague tribunal where she performed with great distinction as well, but it was difficult to match the great opportunities and responsibility of the job with women, Democratic women, who were available. The Zoë Baird situation, I had put her name forward as a possible White House counsel because she had served in that office under Lloyd Cutler and both Lloyd and I recommended her for that role. When there was difficulty finding the right candidate for Attorney General, suddenly her name was moved over from one list to the next. I think the public perception is she became my candidate for Attorney General and that’s wrong, at least by that one nuance.\n\nKnott\n\nYou mentioned earlier that, I believe you were referring to the President being intellectually committed to having a woman as Attorney General. Were there other instances of that? I know he wanted the Cabinet to look like America. Were there other specific positions that you felt had to be filled either by a woman or a member—\n\nChristopher\n\nNo, it was just in the air that the Attorney General ought to be a woman. Can’t say that anybody announced that as a criterion, but non-women candidates didn’t get nearly as much attention as the women candidates.\n\nRiley\n\nI think it was in Elizabeth Drew’s characterization of the transition that she does make claims that Hillary Clinton had a fairly sizable role there. Did you witness this in the transition period?\n\nChristopher\n\nThat she had a sizable role in the transition?\n\nRiley\n\nYes, and in staffing in particular, and possibly even the Attorney General’s position.\n\nChristopher\n\nShe was in many of the meetings in the den in the mansion in Little Rock, and occasionally would express her views, and when she did they were always very pointed and cogent, but she did not seek to play a dominant role by any means. As I say, she probably had other ways to make her views known. But I would characterize her as playing a very prominent and helpful role. She knew a lot of people in the United States. She contributed to those meetings and I would say she was in more than half of them.\n\nRiley\n\nI have only one more transition question, I promise we can go on to more interesting things. That is, with respect to the economic summit. There was—some people voiced concerns that the President was, that there was an awful lot of energy invested in that particular enterprise at a time when the energy might have been better invested in the appointments process itself. Did you have a view at the time about the desirability of diverting energy into that particular exercise?\n\nChristopher\n\nI regarded that as above my pay grade. Basically the President had been elected to do something about the economy and if I had been asked I certainly would not have objected to his spending his time that way. Mickey Kantor organized that. I thought he did an excellent job. I heard those, and I read those concerns, but I think it was time well spent. I think that the public saw the President operating effectively and showing his capacity as a listener, so I regard those criticisms as being understandable but not solidly based.\n\nSince we’re talking about the economic side, if you don’t mind my diverting for a moment here, I think the assembling of the economic team is an unappreciated aspect of the transition period. A great deal of time was spent on it and I think that the team that he assembled was really quite extraordinary in its depth and competence. Having persuaded Lloyd Bentsen to become Secretary of the Treasury was an important step in the President obtaining credibility. Having persuaded Bob Rubin to become first head of the National Economic Council meant the President had somebody who Lloyd Bentsen was prepared to work with in the White House who could be right next to him constantly. And then having persuaded—\n\nRiley\n\nLaura Tyson?\n\nYoung\n\nWas Laura Tyson the original—\n\nNaftali\n\nGene Sperling—\n\nChristopher\n\nI’m on the deputy OMB [Office of Management and Budget]—\n\nNaftali\n\nAlice Rivlin—\n\nChristopher\n\nHaving persuaded Alice Rivlin, who was passed over for being head of OMB but then to become deputy head and then to serve so well in subsequent positions, and having persuaded, as you say Laura Tyson to come in, he had a first rate economic team that served him very well and enabled him to make what I think was the crucial decision of the first year and that was to deal with the deficit.\n\nThat was important not just domestically, but it was very important internationally. It’s hard to overestimate the degree of credibility the President gained internationally by taking steps to balance the budget, and I think he owed that to both his own determination but the presence of Lloyd Bentsen and Bob Rubin and Leon Panetta steeled him to make that very difficult decision and changed the whole course of the administration, I think, and put it on a much sounder track. I hope historians will pay more attention to that series of choices and that decision in the first year.\n\nYoung\n\nWas there any, I shouldn’t say comparable, was there any thought in the selection of Cabinet as to how the Cabinet member in a certain area, Secretary of State, would relate to people in the White House? Was there any thinking about what a foreign policy team would look like, like there was an economic team?\n\nChristopher\n\nI think there was a concern to make sure you had people who could work in a harmonious relationship. It was not so much policy-based as it was personality based, in the foreign policy team. The economic team was built more around strength than it was around a particular policy. For example, we didn’t sit in the den in Little Rock and say, We have to get through a bill to deal with the deficit. But he wanted people who would have the strength to make the difficult decisions and carry them out.\n\nYoung\n\nWere there discussions also about the foreign policy team based on strength?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, I think there were discussions based upon experience and knowledge in the relevant areas. The most difficult decision, because one was made easier by the President’s precipitous action toward me, the most difficult remaining decision was Secretary of Defense, where, for some reason, the list seemed very thin, especially since evidently Sam Nunn was unwilling to do that. I say evidently because I was screened off from some of the Clinton-Nunn conversations because Nunn, speaking in retrospect, apparently wanted to be Secretary of State.\n\nYoung\n\nThey were looking for Democrats with relevant experience and it was thin because there weren’t many, beyond Nunn, were there?\n\nChristopher\n\nThat’s correct. The Democrats had been out of office for a long time. You had the four years of Carter, but that goes back to that tension I mentioned before, that interesting tension of not wanting too many retreads. As a result, the only place where you could find people with real experience was the Congress—and that led people to look to Capitol Hill. Sam Nunn was an obvious choice and didn’t want it, and I don’t mean that Les Aspin was not a well-established figure in the field, but you get beyond Les and there were not very many outstanding candidates.\n\nKnott\n\nWas David McCurdy in play then?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, McCurdy was in play. I think—\n\nYoung\n\nYou mentioned that—\n\nChristopher\n\nThat a junior Congressman was under consideration very seriously for Secretary of Defense is an indication that the bench was not very deep. Then as I report in the book, McCurdy made a very fundamental mistake by launching what appeared to be a campaign against Les Aspin, not attacking Les directly but by raising questions about who would succeed him as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, saying that he (the probable successor) was an unpredictable, or unreliable person. You have to be careful what arguments you make, especially in Washington, because it proved to be a very serious setback for McCurdy.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nI’m quite sure it was an African-American.\n\nNaftali\n\n[Ron] Dellums? Was it Dellums?\n\nChristopher\n\nAnd McCurdy was unwilling to be, for reasons that have never been clear to me, to be head of the CIA. He had single shotted Secretary of Defense.\n\nNaftali\n\nHe was offered the job of CIA?\n\nChristopher\n\nI don’t know whether McCurdy was ever formally offered it but certainly he’d have been high on that list.\n\nYoung\n\nThere wasn’t anyone from the private sector, corporate experience or defense, that was a Democrat or had the relevant experience? Eisenhower used to recruit his people from General Motors, or GE or something like that. I just wondered if that was a consideration, a head of a big organization.\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, that was certainly given consideration and one person was talked to and he wanted to find a way to preserve his stock options, but we couldn’t find any way to do that.\n\nNaftali\n\nWas there any consideration given to choosing a Republican? I mean later a Republican would actually have the job.\n\nChristopher\n\nYou know, flowing through all the Cabinet discussions was the possibility of choosing a Republican, which President-elect Clinton certainly would not have ruled out on an a priori basis, but it never seemed to bubble beyond the generality.\n\nNaftali\n\nYou mentioned something very interesting about General Powell, that he was considered for the Cabinet and he felt it would be an act of disloyalty to his President to agree. Were you one of the ones who had a conversation with the general?\n\nChristopher\n\nNo, those were conducted by Vernon Jordan. He reported back that General Powell still had eight months to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The report that I remember was that he thought it would be inconsistent with his obligation to the troops, which is always a major consideration for Colin Powell, as well as to the President who had put him in that position.\n\nIt’s perhaps easier to understand that now, in retrospect of his identifying himself so as a Republican.\n\nRiley\n\nForgive me for raising this and having not been in the room when the question was asked, but were there other Republicans—\n\nYoung\n\nYes.\n\nChristopher\n\nI think the person, the stock option, the person who was concerned about his stock options was a Republican. He was considered for other Cabinet positions, but he would also have been quite qualified for this one.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd was there any thinking before you actually took office, or went into the confirmation process, about how the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor would relate to each other, or any sense of which strengths, what kind of strengths you need in each post? Or was that thinking compartmented, separate thinking about those two posts?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, someone has alluded to this earlier, there was no doubt that we were all focused on the difficulty between [Zbigniew] Brzezinski and Vance, and determined to avoid that kind of a public display of an adversarial character. And in a sense, Jim, there didn’t have to be much discussion. Tony Lake was a likely choice for being National Security Advisor, long before I—not long before, but I guess some time before I had any relationship with President Clinton—Tony Lake had been his National Security Advisor during the campaign along with Sandy Berger. That was a relationship that was quite in place when I arrived on the scene. I had known Tony, of course, from the Carter days, and it was an unspoken and then a spoken premise of our relationship that we would not have a messy public difference of opinion. Strobe, do you, can you comment on that aspect of it, the choice of Tony? Any discussions you might have had with the President about that?\n\nTalbott\n\nAny discussions I had came several years later when the issue arose of what to do with that post in the second term. They don’t change, either the content or direction of what Chris has told you. There is something that is more than rumor but less than something that I know first-hand, which I’m sure you all have come across, and that is that Sandy Berger, who had a more long-standing relationship with Governor Clinton, had been part of the small group of friends that tried to urge him to run in ’88, deferred on the job himself and strongly recommended to Governor Clinton that he go with Tony, who was somebody who had a bit more visibility. Sandy, of course, had been Tony’s deputy on the policy planning staff in the Carter administration. Nothing I’ve ever heard from Tony or Sandy, who I know better, is an iron-clad confirmation of that, but certainly doesn’t disabuse me of thinking that’s the case.\n\nNaftali\n\nI recall that one foreign policy specialist who was associated with Governor Clinton in the election was Michael Mandelbaum. He didn’t end up on the team. I just recall that he was someone who—no one spoke for the Governor, of course—but was associated with the Governor during the campaign but didn’t turn up in the national security team. Is there a story to that?\n\nTalbott\n\nYou want me to do that one, Chris?\n\nChris\n\nYes, we know the details on that, yes, why don’t you do that.\n\nTalbott\n\nThis is, I should put on the record I guess here, I don’t know what you call it, a point of personal interest. Mike Mandelbaum was, at the time, and had been for quite a number of years, an extremely close friend of mine, one of my very closest. We had known each other since we were undergraduates at Yale. We both went to graduate school in England, although different universities. We had collaborated on articles and even on a book for the Council on Foreign Relations, and we saw a great deal of each other during the campaign in which he was actively involved and I was not, although I did suspend my recusal to write an article for Time magazine about Clinton’s difficulties with the draft, because I had personal knowledge of that episode unlike anybody else’s and I wanted to put it on the record. Mike worked with me on that.\n\nTo make a long and for me painful story short, he had high hopes that he would be given a very senior job in the White House close to the President, probably national security advisor. Secretary Christopher offered him a job that I at least don’t consider to be chopped liver, which was the directorship of the policy planning staff, and that was at the same time that Secretary Christopher was talking to me about what became the New Independent States job. I saw a lot of Mike during that period and he was more than disappointed at only being offered a job in the State Department, and didn’t want that or anything else, except what he had felt might be his due, and therefore chose to stay out.\n\nIn fact, there was an opportunity later to have brought him in, once again on the policy planning staff. He still wanted to stay out and of course he not only stayed out, but became a fairly vocal critic of administration policy on a number of fronts.\n\nChristopher\n\nTim, I offered him the job as head of policy planning which I thought, and think, is one of the best jobs in the State Department, with pretty high hopes and some expectation that he would take it. I was surprised and disappointed when he turned it down. That’s kind of the end of that story. He’d been very active before and I’m puzzled by what developed since then.\n\nNaftali\n\nThanks.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWell, going back to the previous question. Did you have a model? Before you took the job. As Strobe knows, and I’m sure you know, there are different ways to operate the job of Secretary of State and practically everybody who has been in the job in recent years has done it a little bit differently. Some of it depends on the circumstances, but also it depends on the kind of prior experience and ideas that people bring to it as to how they want to do the job. So I guess the question is, did you have a model and if so, what was it?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, Cy Vance will always be a model for me, both personally and professionally. I greatly admired his personal style, or maybe I should say lack of style, admired the way he conducted himself in relation to others. So that affected me. Looking further back, I have great admiration for the way [Dean] Acheson conducted the State Department and before him [George C.] Marshall, so that the Marshall-Acheson duo is the one that I focused on very extensively. I’ve written that Acheson’s experience of combining both a career in the law and a career as Secretary of State is one that energized me from the time of law school.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nAs I think you refer to in the book, Acheson wrote a memoir called Present at the Creation, the creation of the Cold War policy, and here you are, the first—I guess you could say Jim Baker, but he was in the process of liquidating the Cold War—the first real post-Cold War President, Cold War Secretary of State. Other than just throwing that label out for us guys, the ink-stained wretches in the press, was that really something you thought about, the fact that we’re in a different situation now with respect to US activities in the world after the Cold War? Is it something that made any difference as far as you were concerned?\n\nChristopher\n\nAbsolutely. There seemed to me, and the President, that there was a new family of problems that we needed to address. There were problems like epidemics—AIDS as an example; like environmental problems; like economic chaos; like terrorism. A family of problems that could only be addressed through international action, where the capacity of any one country, even as powerful a country as the United States, was likely to be inadequate. So I think that that caused us to say in the post-Cold War period, which is really a mouthful, that we needed to concentrate on those structures, that kind of architecture which would enable us to address the family of problems that was likely to be the central core of the issues before us in the forthcoming years.\n\nSo it was not accidental that one of the first foreign policy steps that the President took was to convene a meeting of the Asia-Pacific leaders for the first time it had ever met at that level, at Vancouver. He took a number of other steps, and I don’t want to prolong these answers by making speeches, but he took a number of steps, I think, which indicated that he understood that there was a new interdependence of nations in addressing the family of problems that would beset us in the time of our super power dominance. So the architecture of the Clinton administration needs to be seen in those terms as we moved to more and more structures that recognize the interdependence of nations.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWhat do you mean by architecture?\n\nChristopher\n\nWhat I mean by architecture is the many international organizations that the President pressed for. In Europe he pressed for the expansion of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization], which sought to carry out his dream of a unified Europe. In Asia he pressed for the annual meeting of the leaders of Asia and the ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] regional forum. In the trade area, the pressure for the completion of the Uruguay round, which looking back, is something that has not gotten the attention I think it deserved. In this hemisphere the effort to achieve the ratification of NAFTA, which was a big fight in our time, the summit of the Americas, which tried to bring together the democracies in Latin America—many, many examples of a new architecture that emphasized the importance of international collaboration and cooperation in addressing this new family of problems. That’s what I mean by architecture. Strobe, maybe you can add to some—\n\nTalbott\n\nAt some point perhaps, Jim, when you’re more into the summing up or looking back stage, I think that what Chris has sketched out can be elaborated, about NAFTA. I would just add one anecdotal point to this question of Acheson looking over our shoulder. When Chris moved into the Secretary’s office, he, like all Secretaries, had the option of selecting which portraits of his predecessors would hang on the walls. He had Cy Vance’s picture and Dean Acheson’s. Did you also have General Marshall?\n\nChristopher\n\nNo.\n\nTalbott\n\nWho was the—\n\nChristopher\n\nOnly those two.\n\nTalbott\n\nAnd I can remember, I know that Acheson was there and it stands to reason obviously from what Chris has said and what you know that Vance’s would be there. I can remember, on a number of occasions, sitting in Chris’s outer office, you know the—\n\nChristopher\n\nThe ceremonial office.\n\nTalbott\n\nAnd sitting next to Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, and we had a kind of running joke between us that we wondered what Acheson was thinking. It’s a wonderful portrait; it captures a kind of severity and sardonic look on his face. What was he thinking as he watched us deal with the problems at hand? We characterized those problems and our role in them as being present at the recreation.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd he smiled.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat kind of a smile?\n\nTalbott\n\nWell, it was hard to tell. What kind of a smile was the question.\n\nYoung\n\nWell, there are a number of ways we can go from here. Did you feel the need—did you consult with Cy Vance after you got the job?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, I consulted with him from time to time about personnel decisions. There came to pass, as they say in the Bible, the only point of disagreement there has ever been in my relationship with Cy Vance and that was over the Vance-Owen plan for Bosnia. If you recall Vance and [Lord David] Owen had recommended a plan that would divide Bosnia into ten enclaves. Very elaborate governing structure with respect to those ten enclaves. The conclusion of our administration was that, admirable as that effort was, the plan was not workable, and it fell to me from time to time to make that point. It wasn’t that we didn’t support the general idea of finding a solution, but we did not support the plan because of its complexity and we were at that point not prepared to commit troops to the effectuation and implementation of that plan. I think in subsequent times Cy and I repaired our relationship, although unhappily Cy not too long thereafter drifted into the terrible illness called Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nYoung\n\nGetting back to starting up. You were asking about models. What about staffing? Were you given a pretty free hand in choosing your people? I’m thinking of the under Secretary, was it Clifton Wharton—\n\nChristopher\n\nDeputy.\n\nYoung\n\nAnd others.\n\nChristopher\n\nI advocated within the administration that the Cabinet Secretaries should not be entirely free to select their own subordinates. I’d seen that model at work and it has a nice ring to it, but it doesn’t work out very well if you find subordinates with greater loyalty to the Cabinet officer than to the President, or subordinates that feel that they can criticize the White House with some impunity. So I urged and I think it was really carried out, that it be a joint responsibility between the Cabinet officer and the White House. Dick Riley, who was basically responsible for sub-Cabinet appointments, the interviews for them and so forth, in Washington, carried that out.\n\nIn my own case, my choices for the positions other than deputy were almost completely free from outside influence. Cliff Wharton was somebody under consideration for various positions in the government and I was strongly encouraged to take him as deputy, and did. But except for that one example, and maybe two or three other times when in the course of the four years I was urged by the White House to bring somebody in, never over my strenuous objection, I was given quite a free hand to—I always went through the process of explaining, justifying, clearing the choices with the White House because I thought that was the right thing to do.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nOne of the things that I think is a disaster for the US government in staffing the administration is now the incredible time it takes between identifying somebody—not the Secretary of State, but almost everybody below that—and getting them in the job. It seems to have increased greatly, even in the Clinton administration, because of the White House counsel’s office and all this regal nonsense and Congress and Zoë Baird and you name it. So now it’s become—even today there are people who are not confirmed. And it’s not all the Congress. I mean, a lot of it is also the administration’s slowness and all this sort of thing. I’m sure you must have been frustrated by this in part. Was there any attempt to cut through this somehow?\n\nChristopher\n\nDon, that’s one of the real problems of our democracy at the present time, the length of time it takes, but also the discouragement of able candidates because of the gap and the lead time and the process. Many people simply don’t want to subject themselves to the burden and the risks of the process in which a single issue can derail a nomination, or a single flaw in a person’s background, almost a blemish, seems to be enough to do it. And yes, there are dozens of efforts to streamline the process and to make it more efficient, and none of them so far are successful.\n\nYou know, one little thing that would be a great help is to have a common application so that you don’t have to fill out separate lengthy applications for Congress and for the White House and for the FBI. I think it all could be computerized and much more effectively done. Just to take one simple idea. Brookings I think has had a study of this.\n\nTalbott\n\nPaul Light has got something called the Presidential Appointment Initiative.\n\nOberdorfer\n\n[Al] Kamen keeps referring to it in his column. I thought, you know, if there was one—we’ll discuss this at lunch because it has nothing to do with your oral history.\n\nYoung\n\nWe’ll go on to your next question then.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nWell, you know, one of the things, I speak now as a former journalist and Strobe is sitting next to me as a former journalist, we all know that the crucial question for the Secretary of State is how is his interaction with the President of the United States. It’s shot down, some Secretaries of State, such as Alexander Haig, and others, it’s limited what they’re able to do or want to do. You have, as Secretary—we all write Secretary Christopher did this or Secretary Vance or Secretary Shultz did x, y, and z, but we know intellectually somehow, that that represents some kind of agreement or interaction within the government in which you have the President, you have to have him on board. Then you have a whole bunch of other influences, you’re not a free agent in the sense that you could just decide one morning what you want to do. In your case, how did you operate your relationship with the President, and other people at the White House who represent him, to maximize the possibility that you could get clearance or backing for the things that you thought should be done?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, I was determined to work within the system and respect my other Cabinet colleagues. So basically foreign policy decisions were reached through the structure set up in the White House, through the National Security Council, in meetings of the NSC or of the subgroups of the NSC, and importantly through the regular meetings between the key members of the foreign policy team: the National Security Adviser, the Secretary of Defense, the head of the CIA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We met weekly and we would hash through most of the difficult decisions in those weekly meetings.\n\nThere would also be meetings for example, subject matter meetings. The meetings on Haiti began down in Little Rock and continued through 1994 and thereafter. Those would be meetings in the sit [situation] room. I wrote fairly regular night notes to President Clinton and there were sometimes actions taken on those, although I tried to respect the process by not asking for decisions on night notes except on rather rare instances, but used them to inform the President as to directions I thought we ought to take, or where we might be going.\n\nMy relationships with the President were always very easy and cordial. I’m sure he has—I credit the reports that he has a temper but I’ve never had it displayed toward me. Don, one of the ways the Secretary of State frequently works is in connection with the meeting of foreign leaders. Once, twice, three times a week, the President meets with a foreign leader and Secretary of State is a key person in the preparation for those meetings, as well as at those meetings, and I would frequently stay after. He’d ask me to stay after and we’d discuss either the meeting or something else. That whole congeries of approaches to decision making, but by and large I would say we respected the process and worked through the process, the NSC process, and decisions came out of that process. Strobe, you went through it all with me—\n\nTalbott\n\nReally I can’t think of much to add. Clinton is a funny combination of a guy who likes to interact personally with people but also, as has been noted earlier, a voracious reader and Chris’s night notes to him often came back with barely decipherable proof that the President had read them and reacted to them.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nThere’s a perception that early on in the administration he wasn’t paying much attention. This is David Gergen’s book. He says In the Cold War, presidents typically spent at least 60% of their time on foreign affairs, with Bush— meaning the first Bush —the figure could rise to 75%. Clinton early on reversed the tables. Domestic affairs probably consumed 75% of his time, foreign affairs less than a quarter. Foreign embassies were outraged that the heads of government could not get on Clinton’s calendar. When a small plane crashed on the White House lawn, people joked it was the CIA Director, Jim Woolsey, trying to get an appointment. No President for more than half the century was so cavalier toward the larger world.\n\nThen it says that now he was in trouble— this was written in about 1993, I mean, it is about 1993 —Clinton listened more carefully to his National Security Advisor, Tony Lake, and Secretary of State Christopher. They told him he had the capacity to be a strong foreign policy President, but he had to engage, stop flitting in and out. Each day should begin with a thorough briefing. Regularly he should meet with his whole NSC. Once a week he should sit down privately with his Secretary of State. Schedules should include foreign policy, etc. Clinton accepted some of their recommendations. I don’t know if you recognize that. Was it really Clinton, or this is from a guy who was partly—he was not on the inside then, but he was on the inside within a few months after that.\n\nChristopher\n\nWhen did he actually come in?\n\nOberdorfer\n\nI think it was some time in the late spring of ’93.\n\nTalbott\n\nSounds too early.\n\nRiley\n\nSounds too early, I don’t think it was—let’s check a little bit.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nAnyway, whenever it was, he came in at some point and that’s what he was—that’s his book, his retrospective.\n\nChristopher\n\nDon, I think it’s not an apt characterization of the President. There’s no doubt that in the early months he did emphasize domestic issues, as he very well should have. As I said earlier, I regarded one of the most important foreign policy issues was getting our domestic house in order. When I took my first trip around the world to various capitals, I was being besieged in one capital after another: Are you going to get your economic house in order? Indeed, it is kind of ironic to think that one of the places I got that lecture the most was in Japan, in view of the fact that recently we’ve been trying to get them to improve their economic performance. In 1993 people thought the United States was going down the tubes, that we were going to be beaten out economically by Japan and by other countries and that we were receding as a great power. So I embraced the President’s idea of spending maybe a predominant amount of his time on domestic affairs.\n\nThe complaints from foreign ambassadors that they couldn’t get their chief of state in to see the President, those complaints will exist every single year of every presidency. If the President devoted 90% of his time to foreign policy, you’d still have ambassadors complaining they couldn’t get their chief of state in. After all, the President can only see so many of the 150 members of the United Nations in any given year. One visit a week is about as much as the President can do in any kind of a substantial meeting, maybe two.\n\nFor myself, I understood the President was focused on domestic matters in the first year or so, but I think inattention to important issues of foreign policy is something I would never attribute to him. Strobe, what was your experience?\n\nTalbott\n\nYes, I have a view on this. I think the paragraph in Gergen’s book that you read is complete and total crap and when I get a chance to look at the transcript I will redact that and make it read not an apt characterization.\n\nYoung\n\nThat’s what we heard.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nIt was the conventional wisdom, pretty much.\n\nTalbott\n\nYes, but this is presumably history that we’re—\n\nYoung\n\nThis is exactly one of the reasons why, because those things—\n\nTalbott\n\nJust as—I’ll leave it to Chris whether the law is sometimes a fool, but conventional wisdom is sometimes crap, and that’s certainly the case here. I was working, on Chris’s behalf, on one issue which was a rather important issue, and that is the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe consistent intensity of Clinton’s interest in and involvement in that issue was stunning and it went back to the transition. Clinton and I re-engaged substantively after Chris had called me and asked if I would come in the State Department. Even though Clinton was in the process of putting together a government, presiding over the economic summit in Little Rock and all that kind of thing, he was fascinated by what was going on in Russia, which was a lot. He was getting regular intelligence briefings in Little Rock and was calling me up at all times of day or night, particularly night, unfortunately for me, to ask about what was up with [Boris] Yeltsin. When I saw him on New Year’s at the Renaissance Weekend it was all he wanted to talk about. And it wasn’t just idle curiosity. It was: what do we do about this?\n\nEarly on, which is to say February, when Richard Nixon—and this actually might be a theme that at some point you’ll want to come back to, the kind of strange affinity that developed between the two of them—when Richard Nixon came through and wanted to get some advice to Clinton, Clinton called me to ask about my own conversation with Nixon, talked to him directly. As we prepared for the Vancouver Summit, which was on the third or fourth of April of that year, we started months in advance obviously and one of the key questions was what to do about assistance for Russia and the other countries, but it was primarily Russia. Clinton—Chris, you remember, he presided over at least two meetings in the Cabinet or the Roosevelt Room. Those meetings went overtime. He was pumping us with questions and he was pumping us with exhortations to do more than we had recommended.\n\nYou know, Chris emphasized earlier the importance of dealing with the deficit as THE job to be done in the first administration, and doing a lot more in the way of assistance for Russia and the former Soviet Union obviously cut against the priority of eliminating the deficit, and yet Clinton wanted to do it. Sometimes there were objections from Stephanopoulos and others, you know, Don’t even talk about this because first of all it is politically controversial and secondly it would be fiscally damaging to what you’re trying to do in the budget, and Clinton basically blew them off, made a case for the strategic importance of it.\n\nI don’t entirely understand why the impression came about that he was disengaged from foreign policy. Partly because people alleged it. Partly it was a kind of misunderstanding on the part of a lot of those who traffic in conventional wisdom, including in Gergen’s case, somebody who came in after the fact. Misunderstanding of his style. I mean, it had kind of a—what shall I say?—kind of a casual, unstructured quality to it. To wit, he would call up at 11 o’clock or midnight to talk something through. That didn’t go through the Chief of Staff’s office and therefore maybe in some sense it doesn’t exist in terms of the record. But it was stunning how on top of all that he was, both for informational purposes and also for driving the policy process.\n\nRiley\n\nCould I ask a follow up, oh I’m sorry, please—\n\nYoung\n\nYou’re looking at—\n\nChristopher\n\nI’m looking—Strobe, I was trying to remember the time when Yeltsin dissolved the Parliament, March 12, 1993.\n\nTalbott\n\nAnd the weekend we spent in the White House.\n\nChristopher\n\nHere was an issue in which the President had to make a decision. Would he support Yeltsin despite his dissolving the Parliament and taking some actions that on the surface seemed to be anti-democratic? And the President spent an enormous amount of time on that issue and the follow up to that issue. Really, I think it undercuts the notion that he wasn’t involved in those issues. Nineteen ninety-three was a pretty important year as far as Yeltsin’s survival was concerned.\n\nTalbott\n\nYes, and as for foreign leaders, you can either discount or qualify, whatever way you see fit, the importance of that region of the world, but we wanted to get several leaders from the non-Russian former republics to the Oval Office, because we were trying to send a strong signal that it wasn’t a Russia only policy and we were interested in promoting the independence of all fifteen former republics. Stanislav Shushkevich, the President of Belarus, and Eduard Shevardnadze are just two that come to mind. I’m sure if we go back over the record there were others. Now, we had some difficulty with the scheduling office, just as we had some difficulty with both the domestic political advisors and the economic people on the assistance package for Russia. But even the Russia wonks undershot how much money we as a government should put on the barrelhead in order to stimulate the G7 to do more during the Tokyo Summit. Clinton pushed us up to whatever the final figure was, 1.2 billion dollars, I think.\n\nNaftali\n\nCan we probe that just for a minute, that’s—I believe the administration had Richard Nixon lobby for it on Capitol Hill, lobby for the assistance package.\n\nTalbott\n\nWell we didn’t need to ask him. The Clinton-Nixon relationship obviously had its complications in its origins, but even during the ’92 campaign, when one of the very few foreign policy issues on which Clinton decided it was politically prudent as well as responsible to go after Bush—one of course was Bosnia, but the other was on aid to Russia. And the fact that Nixon was criticizing Bush for doing too little came up a number of times, I remember. So I’m not sure that they were talking to each other then, but they certainly started talking to each other in February 1993 and I have no doubt, in fact I think I remember that Nixon did talk to Bob Dole and others about the importance of supporting the administration’s Russia aid package. I don’t think it was so much at Clinton’s prodding though.\n\nRiley\n\nI wanted to ask a question that is something we probably would want to get into in much greater detail with you in another session, but it relates very much to this, and that’s about your judgment of Clinton’s native interest in foreign affairs as he’s coming into the White House. You’ve known him for a long time. Was he somebody that you felt had a kind of cultivated interest in foreign affairs? Or sort of—again, the conventional wisdom on this is Clinton was primarily somebody for whom domestic politics was his all-consuming passion.\n\nTalbott\n\nWell, Jim, if you feel it’s in order, I’ll do a short version on that now and then we—\n\nYoung\n\nAll right.\n\nChristopher\n\nAnd I’d also like—\n\nYoung\n\nYes, Chris’s take on that too.\n\nTalbott\n\nYou want to go first?\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, I think it’s basically a canard. Clinton’s interest in foreign matters goes back to his days as a student at Oxford and his travels in Europe. It is certainly true that his 12 years as Governor of Arkansas meant that he dealt in the context of his day-to-day life with domestic issues, and few Presidents will ever come into office with more knowledge about domestic matters than Clinton. But the nature of the man is that there is nothing that goes on that doesn’t interest him, and whenever he is confronted with a new area, suddenly he becomes very interested in it and reads about it and assembles his information in a way that is not sort of IBM orderliness, but nevertheless I found he took an interest in every foreign policy issue that came up.\n\nIn addition to that, he seemed to have insights about the politics of countries that were just amazing. I read about Secretaries of State who wanted to keep the President out of their matters so that he didn’t mess it up. Well, I never felt that way about Clinton. I always was anxious to get him into any matter because I knew that he would add an extra 15 or 20% to whatever the bureaucracy and I would provide for him. So I just think it’s a canard that he wasn’t interested in foreign affairs. He did have a priority in 1993, but that priority was frequently interrupted by things like the March events that we’ve talked about in Russia as well as the October events when you may remember basically the effort to take over the Russian Parliament by [Aleksandr Vladimirovich] Rutskoi, is that right?\n\nNaftali\n\n[Ruslan] Khasbulatov.\n\nChristopher\n\nAnd that dramatic scene there. When those things came along he dealt with them and not impatiently.\n\nNaftali\n\nCan I ask, before Strobe, you want to—\n\nTalbott\n\nLet me just, if I could just tag on something to what Chris has said. As long as I’ve known him, which was since September 1968, it’s been clear that Jack Kennedy was his model. He was hoping to emulate Kennedy in many ways. He was with me, and I think with others, interested in the full range of Kennedy’s presidency, but particularly Kennedy as a foreign policy President and how Kennedy dealt with the Cold War and with [Nikita] Khrushchev. His mentor on the Hill of course was J. William Fulbright, who was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and he’s a graduate of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown. His curricular interest at Oxford in the PP & E [Politics, Philosophy and Economics] program was to write a thesis on the USSR [Union of Soviet Socialist Republics] and alternative futures for the USSR—by the way, an essay that should somehow be included in the record that you’re putting together. I know it’s in the Clinton library.\n\nHis reading interests were particularly 19th century British history and especially Robert Blake’s biography of [Benjamin] Disraeli. As Governor of Arkansas, and I saw quite a bit of him during that period, his overarching intellectual passion, almost, was how you could elevate a poor, backward, remote southern state by plugging it into the global economy. So, I think again, all of that is by way of background of what he brought to his presidency—there was a lot of momentum behind what he brought into the presidency in terms of interest in the outside world.\n\nYoung\n\nWas this evident to you also in your early conversations with him on foreign policy?\n\nChristopher\n\nI never had any doubt of his great interest in this. I also never had any doubt that his first priority, in the first year, was to do something about the economy, as I said—\n\nYoung\n\nBut not to the exclusion.\n\nChristopher\n\nBy no means, not the exclusion.\n\nNaftali\n\nOne of the interesting challenges for any biographer, presidential biographer, is to see how Presidents learn and how their ideas change with time and experience. When you had those initial conversations, Mr. Secretary, with President-elect Clinton, about becoming Secretary of State, did he express any cardinal principles, any set of objectives that he hoped foreign policy under his administration would achieve?\n\nChristopher\n\nYou know, it’s difficult for me to remember how those things evolved. There was nothing very formal about our conversation of my becoming Secretary of State. He didn’t give me a thirty-minute exposé of what he wanted to accomplish. But as we moved into the period of my working out the first message that I would give to the Congress when I had my confirmation hearings, I began then to see evolve this importance of international architecture, the importance of international organizations, the growing interdependence, coupled with a sense that he had, I think, of the importance of improving relations with each of the major powers. It was a very, very inclusive sense of importance, which was reflected in, as I say, in my confirmation testimony, as we begin to work through the issues. There were some foreign policy issues that came up during the transition period in which people would come down from Washington to brief us on those and that had occasioned some of the earlier conversations as well.\n\nTalbott\n\nThe first face-to-face conversation I had with him after Secretary Christopher had tapped me for a job in the administration was in South Carolina at this Renaissance weekend, and he had a five-point set of instructions basically, a plan of how he wanted to approach Russia, the former Soviet Union. It doesn’t stand up all that badly by the way, if you look at it eight years later.\n\nI mean, he had thought it through and knew—and by the way, it was kind of an interesting intersect between what Chris was saying about his overall priority and his plan for Russia. The model was it’s the economy, stupid. Whatever else we do, we have to work on the issue of the Russian post-Soviet economy.\n\nYoung\n\nYour talk, your testimony, your opening statement at your confirmation hearing—my question is, was the preparation of that statement the result of some conversations that you had with Clinton? And rather than ask if he had some cardinal principles to give you, did you understand what he resonated with, what his aspirations and ambitions were for the United States in the world that gave you significant clues?\n\nChristopher\n\nYes, when I formulated that testimony I had very much in mind the conversations we’d had in Little Rock and the general themes that I thought he’d want to emphasize. After a passage of, I guess now almost a decade, I can’t point to which conversation it was in Little Rock that—one gets from President Clinton a general sense of things that doesn’t always translate very well into a—it’s not like a box to be checked on a decision paper, but just a general mood.\n\nYoung\n\nThat’s what I’m trying to get at, what many people have missed, I think.\n\nChristopher\n\nThe mood about the unification of Europe, which is a predominant theme for him and illuminated so much about the expansion of NATO, and trying to include Russia within the West and bring Russia into the big eight, making it the big eight rather than seven. All of those things flow from his dream that Europe would, at some time in his time or soon thereafter, not have these contentious blocs, not have the central corridor of nations that has given rise to so many wars, but be a unified set of countries with common economic goals and much interchange between the two. An awful lot that I saw in his reactions about Europe trace back to that, including the risks he was prepared to take in Bosnia.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nGetting back to the Gergen thing—he alleges, and it was commonly written at the time—I retired in April of ’93 so I wasn’t writing it, thank goodness—that there were very few meetings of the foreign policy principals either as an NSC or with the principals in which he actually participated and that there was a lot of frustration by his senior advisors of getting him deeply engaged. Maybe, I don’t know if Russia came up. Did you feel that at all, Chris, or is this just coming out of some nowheresville?\n\nChristopher\n\nI think it’s all part of what became sort of a common allegation that the President was not as deeply involved in foreign policy as the sixty people that write columns in Washington think he ought to be. You’re never going to quite feed that columnist machine an adequate amount. It is certainly probably accurate that there were not very many formal meetings of the National Security Council, but he met, as I said, once or twice a week with the foreign policy team, in advance of, and in connection with a foreign visitor. Those often became broader meetings, and he received regular reports from the meeting of the foreign policy principals.\n\nYoung\n\nExcuse me, those were the weekly meetings you referred to earlier?\n\nChristopher\n\nThe weekly meetings, and he also received many memos from Tony Lake, which were the result of things that worked their way up through the process at the deputies’ meeting and so forth. And there’s no doubt that a good many more or less routine foreign policy decisions came to him on paper and he checked off the box on that. But there’s no doubt there was a common allegation that the White House was not being run in as orderly a way as it should have been. I think that was one of the things that resulted in the change of Chiefs of Staff, Don, but that was an endemic problem. It wasn’t primarily focused on foreign policy, it was a problem of operating style that did need some correction, and I think it was corrected.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nDuring your four years there did the operating style develop, change, or was it pretty much what it was in the first year?\n\nChristopher\n\nNo, it certainly tightened up. The number of people in meetings decreased. The regularity of meetings was improved—in the sense that meetings would start on time and end on time. Leon Panetta did a lot to improve those, although you have to deal with the personality of a very curious President who was not prepared to end meetings if his curiosity had not been satisfied.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nOne heard—\n\nChristopher\n\nThat’s one of the things you earn when you’re President.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nI heard secondhand, sometimes third hand, this is off of what you said, of meetings that they had about some foreign policy issue in which it would be like, it was described to me like a graduate seminar or something like this, the President being the guy asking the questions, or the center obviously of attention, and they’d go on and on for a long period of time, and at the end there didn’t seem to be any decision out of it. It was kind of frustrating to people that—the usual model, I guess it’s the Eisenhower model, the decisive general, where you’d have the discussion and he’d say, We’re going to do X or Y. But, particularly early, there are these reports. I don’t know how true they are.\n\nChristopher\n\nWell, there were certainly meetings that went on too long, but I would really challenge the notion that there was anything wrong with it, with the President saying, I’m going to step back from this and think about it, and then make his decision afterward, perhaps on paper or after he had the national security staff narrow down the options. I was never troubled by his not reaching a decision in a meeting and I just underscored the fact that if there was a fault about meetings that went on too long, or rambled too much, it was by no means exclusive to the foreign policy establishment. I think it was much more likely to have been in domestic affairs, where his knowledge and curiosity is so enormous.\n\nOberdorfer\n\nIn a sense there’s a contradiction between the idea that he didn’t spend any time on it, and that his meetings went on too long.\n\nTalbott\n\nColin Powell I think uses—one of the most quoted passages from Colin Powell’s book is the line about graduate bull sessions.\n\nChristopher\n\nRight, clearly those two had different operating styles. The Pentagon has a different operating style than the White House has.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you seem to be a very ordered, organized person too. You didn’t find yourself frustrated by disorder?\n\nChristopher\n\nAnybody who has served in government as long as I have and said he was never frustrated is not telling you the truth.\n\nRiley\n\nSo nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nChristopher\n\nNothing out of the ordinary. One of the requirements of being able to serve in government at high levels is being able to stand frustration.\n\nTalbott\n\nLet me just throw in one other thought here. Chris has already said, The President is the President, he gets to decide what the style is, and Secretaries of State and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, they’ve got to get used to it. But the other thing is, Clinton likes to ask questions. He likes to impersonate the critics of a policy option. So there’s a kind of a—there’s a Clinton version of the Socratic approach in these meetings where he would—you know the expression the murder board? He got to be the murder board, and the people presenting the policy options had to defend it. And I saw over and over again where first of all the degree of coherence, cogency and persuasiveness of the answers tilted his decision in a way that the advocates would want.
