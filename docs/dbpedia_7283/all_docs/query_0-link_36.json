This event will be most comprehensive international event on bleeding disorders in 2024 and will bring people with bleeding disorders and other stakeholders together in one place. The Congress will take place at the IFEMA Convention Centre in Madrid—a world-class venue in a world-class city that’s easily accessible to international travelers. On behalf of the WFH and the global bleeding disorders community, we are thrilled to welcome you back to in-person gatherings for an unparalleled opportunity to connect, learn, and collaborate.\n\nIf you are a person with a bleeding disorder, a family member, healthcare professional, researcher, policy maker, advocate, or industry member—Congress is for you! The program will cover the latest developments and innovations in our field, from healthcare issues to the challenges ahead for the management and treatment of hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, rare factor deficiencies, and inherited platelet disorders. This aspect of the Congress—of bringing the best and brightest in our field together in one place—is critical to foster new ideas and approaches.\n\nYour participation in the WFH 2024 World Congress will help the WFH continue to deliver the programs and events that are so critical to our community, especially in countries that have limited resources. So, join us as a delegate, speaker, volunteer, or sponsor and be part of this exciting event. You will be making a difference just by coming and networking with other professionals.\n\nOn behalf of the WFH and Fedhemo, we extend a warm welcome to the global community. Let’s work together in the name of Treatment for All in Madrid in April 2024.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCesar Garrido\n\nPresident\n\nWorld Federation of Hemophilia\n\nDaniel-Aníbal García Diego\n\nPresident\n\nFederación Española de Hemofilia\n\nThe information on the WFH website is provided for general information purposes only.
