In the second year, participants take advanced level courses with a focus on our three core themes: building a global advantage, leading responsibly, and managing transformation. At the end of the second year, participants work in groups on the EMBA Capstone Project, which brings together their acquired knowledge and skills to apply it to advance recommendations to local business in Geneva. Since 2006, the Geneva EMBA has been accredited by the Association of MBAs (AMBA), one of the world’s leading authorities on post-graduate business education, demonstrating its continuing commitment to excellence in management education. With its continuous AMBA re-accreditation, the Geneva EMBA confirms itself in the top 2% of Business Schools globally.",
