Imagine a school that approaches education as a journey of information and discovery. Imagine a school that prayerfully partners with parents in the work of academic, spiritual, physical and social growth of every student. Imagine a school that believes education matters, for it has the ability to shape people and therefore cultures, for generations. Imagine a school whose graduates leave confident in their abilities because they know who they are and whose they are as they pursue the work that God has called them to do with excellence and for His glory.\n\nThe Geneva School admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. The Geneva School does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school administered programs."
