        "text": "Click on an event name to access news, data, and resources for regional flood events that involved a national coordinated USGS response.\n\n2022\n\nHurricane Ian\n\n2021\n\nHurricane Ida - Hurricane Ida made U.S. landfall near Port Fourchon as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 29., 2021, second only to Hurricane Katrina in strength to make landfall in Louisiana. Ida weakened slowly as it moved inland over Mississippi and the Appalachians with heavy precipitation and tornadoes. It joined a frontal system as it moved over the Northeast U.S. with intensifying winds and rainfall leading to flash flooding in areas that were already saturated by previous storms. Hurricane Ida caused significant damage and 87 deaths along its path from Louisiana to Massachusetts.\n\n2020\n\nHurricane Delta - Delta was the 10th named storm to make landfall in the U.S. - and the 4th in Louisiana - in a single year, both records. After an extremely fast intensification and then weakening, it made U.S. landfall near Creole, Louisiana, on Oct. 9, 2020, as a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nHurricane Sally - Sally first made landfall in Key Biscane, Florida, on Sept. 12, 2020, moving west into the Gulf of Mexico. Sally turned northeastward and intensified, making landfall again near Gulf Shores, Alabama, on Sept. 16.\n\nHurricane Laura - Laura passed over Puerto Rico on August 22, 2020, as a tropical storm, then rapidly intensified as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico. It made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, on August 27 as a Category 4 hurricane and moved inland over Arkansas, Kentucky, and Maryland.\n\nHurricane Marco - Marco, a short-lived Category 1 hurricane, moved west along the Louisiana coastline on August 24, 2020.\n\nHurricane Isaias - Notable for its large tornado outbreak, Hurricane Isaias followed the eastern coast of Florida and Georgia until it made landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, as a Category 1 on August 4, 2020, and moved up the East Coast.\n\n2019\n\nHurricane Dorian - Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 hurricane, took nearly two weeks (August 24 - Sept 7, 2019) to pass from the Caribbean to Canada.\n\n2018\n\nHurricane Michael - Hurricane Michael made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on October 10, 2018, as a Category 5. It caused catastrophic flooding and wind damage across Central America and the Southeastern U.S., particularly the Florida panhandle.\n\nHurricane Florence - Hurricane Florence's rains caused severe freshwater flooding as it stalled over North and South Carolina in September 2018.\n\n2017\n\nHurricane Nate - Capping off an intense 2017 hurricane season, Nate made landfall on the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts on October 7.\n\nHurricane Maria - Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a strong category 4 hurricane, with winds of 155 mph that knocked out power for the entire island.\n\nHurricane Jose - Even though Hurricane Jose never made a direct impact on the United States in September 2017, it generated large waves along its entire path and coastal effects have been felt from Florida to New England.\n\nHurricane Irma - Hurricane Irma was the first major hurricane to hit Florida since Hurricane Wilma struck in 2005.\n\nHurricane Harvey - On August 25, 2017 Category 4 storm Hurricane Harvey struck Texas, causing an estimated $125 billion in damage.\n\nPacific Winter Floods - The 2017 flood season began with atmospheric rivers pouring rain over large areas of California, Nevada, and Oregon.\n\nMidwest Spring Floods - Large portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Arkansas experienced widespread springtime flooding.\n\n2016\n\n2015/2016 Winter Floods - Widespread flooding from severe December 2015 rainfall affected large sections of the central and southern United States. Stress on the Nation's major rivers continued into 2016, as portions of the Ohio River, Missouri River, and Mississippi River threatened to match or exceed 2011 levels.\n\nJanuary Noreaster - A strong winter storm brings record-setting storm surge to the mid-Atlantic.\n\nSouthern Spring Floods - Spring rains cause flooding across areas of Texas, Louisiana Arkansas, and Mississippi.\n\nAugust Louisiana Floods - Rainfall across Louisiana including amounts above 30 inches in some locations resulted in record-setting flooding.\n\nSeptember Northern Plains Floods - More than 12 inches of rain fell in northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota, and southwest Wisconsin during a 24-hour period on September 22 and 23, 2016. Wisconsin streamgages saw floods in the 10- to 100-year range.\n\nHurricane Matthew - A severe hurricane crossed Cuba and the Bahamas on its way toward the Florida coast.\n\n2015\n\nSummer Central Floods - Repeated high-intensity storms wiped out drought conditions across much of Texas while Oklahoma experienced the single largest month of rainfall ever recorded. Soon after, farm-belt States and the Ohio River valley endured an unusually wet summer.\n\nAutumn Appalachian Floods and Hurricane Joaquin - While Hurricane Joaquin threatened from the South Atlantic Ocean, weeks of persistent and sometimes heavy rain soaked the Appalachian States. USGS crews prepared for the double-threat of inland flooding and potential coastal flooding and damage from the Hurricane. Joaquin eventually passed by with moderate effects on the coast while USGS crews remained occupied with the inland floods.\n\n2015/2016 Winter Floods - Widespread flooding from severe December 2015 rainfall affected large sections of the central and southern United States. Stress on the Nation's major rivers continued into 2016, as portions of the Ohio River, Missouri River, and Mississippi River threatened to match or exceed 2011 levels.\n\n2014\n\nApril floods in Alabama and Florida - Heavy rains over Southern Alabama and the Florida panhandle brought peak-of-record flooding on Bayou Marcus Creek and over $21 million in damage to Escambia County infrastructure.\n\nJune floods in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa - Peak-of-record flows in northern Minnesota's Rainy River Basin kept USGS crews busy while record floods further south in the Big Sioux River Basin left their mark in South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa.\n\nAugust-September Southwest flood events - Heavy August rains followed by remnants of Hurricane Odile in September brought major flooding to parts of Arizona.\n\nDecember Pacific Coast flood events - Regional flooding, including flash floods, heavy snows in the mountains, high winds, and mudslides visited Oregon, Washington, and California. Although widespread rain provided much-needed water, it did not alleviate the long-term drought in California.\n\n2013\n\nSeptember Southwest Floods - Heavy mid-September rains brought major flooding to parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.\n\nMay-June Midwest Floods - Late May and early June brought additional flooding to Iowa, Missouri Illinois, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.\n\nApril-May Midwest Floods - Heavy rainfall (locally as much at 8 inches in some locations) fell across parts of Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana in mid-April, resulting in major flooding on several rivers. Late snow-melt in the northern midwest added to the flooding in late April and early May.\n\n2012\n\nHurricane Isaac - USGS scientists, engineers, and technicians worked along the Gulf coast in response to Hurricane Isaac, deploying and maintaining 188 storm tide sensors and real-time streamgages in anticipation of Isaac's arrival. The USGS, in concert with our partners, is providing scientific assessments of the challenges wrought by Isaac.\n\nHurricane Sandy - Following on the heels of Hurricane Isaac, Hurricane Sandy gave USGS scientists, engineers, and technicians another opportunity to deploy storm tide sensors and real-time streamgages, this time, in over 224 locations.\n\n2011\n\nApril 2011 Arkansas Flood - The summer of 2011 brought historic flooding to Arkansas. In addition to the massive floodwaters that coursed down the Mississippi River, unusually heavy rainfall caused backwater flooding and levee failure along the Black and White Rivers as well.\n\nApril 2011 North Dakota Flood - On April 6, 2011, warmer-than-expected temperatures, combined with some light rain, initiated the melt process. Soon, record-breaking floodwaters came coursing down the Missouri, Red, and Souris Rivers, leading to massive flooding and even forcing some North Dakotans to flee their homes.\n\nMay 2011 New Madrid Floodway - In response to dangerous flood levels near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) activated the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway (New Madrid Floodway in USGS literature) at 10:03 pm on May 2, 2011 by detonating explosives along a stretch of the Mississippi River levee just downstream of Cairo, Illinois.\n\nMay 2011 Louisiana flood - USGS crews from the Louisiana Water Science Center deployed stage sensors and rapid deployment real-time streamgages in the Morganza floodway in anticipation of the operation of the floodway, which was opened May 14, 2011 at 3:00pm. The USGS also made streamflow, water quality, and sediment concentration measurements in association with the Bonnet Carre' spillway upstream of New Orleans.\n\nMay 2011 Memphis, Tennessee flood - The USGS Tennessee Water-Science Center worked in cooperation with FEMA, USACE, National Weather Service, and local agencies to provide emergency real-time surface-water stage gages at critical locations in Shelby County.\n\nSummer Missouri River Basin flood - USGS crews from Montana to Missouri watched closely as a higher-than-average snowmelt runoff combined with heavy spring rains advanced down the Missouri River system. Large reservoirs managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are carefully managed with the help of data from the USGS streamgaging network to control flood levels.\n\nHurricane Irene - The USGS deployed stage sensors and rapid deployment real-time streamgages along the East Coast in anticipation of Hurricane Irene. USGS measurements and geospatial products are valuable tools for providing scientific assessments to decision makers both during the event and for future planning after the event.\n\nTropical Storm Lee - USGS personnel respond to the second major storm in 2 months as Tropical Storm Lee adds 20 inches of rain to an already wet season.\n\nClick on an event name to access news, data, and resources for regional flood events that involved a national coordinated USGS response.\n\n2022\n\nHurricane Ian\n\n2021\n\nHurricane Ida - Hurricane Ida made U.S. landfall near Port Fourchon as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 29., 2021, second only to Hurricane Katrina in strength to make landfall in Louisiana.

The USGS also made streamflow, water quality, and sediment concentration measurements in association with the Bonnet Carre' spillway upstream of New Orleans.\n\nMay 2011 Memphis, Tennessee flood - The USGS Tennessee Water-Science Center worked in cooperation with FEMA, USACE, National Weather Service, and local agencies to provide emergency real-time surface-water stage gages at critical locations in Shelby County.\n\nSummer Missouri River Basin flood - USGS crews from Montana to Missouri watched closely as a higher-than-average snowmelt runoff combined with heavy spring rains advanced down the Missouri River system. Large reservoirs managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are carefully managed with the help of data from the USGS streamgaging network to control flood levels.\n\nHurricane Irene - The USGS deployed stage sensors and rapid deployment real-time streamgages along the East Coast in anticipation of Hurricane Irene. USGS measurements and geospatial products are valuable tools for providing scientific assessments to decision makers both during the event and for future planning after the event.\n\nTropical Storm Lee - USGS personnel respond to the second major storm in 2 months as Tropical Storm Lee adds 20 inches of rain to an already wet season."
