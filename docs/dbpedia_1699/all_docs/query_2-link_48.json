        "text": "Jon Card — who drummed in Canadian punk and hardcore bands D.O.A., the Subhumans, SNFU and Personality Crisis — has died. He was 63.\n\nNo cause of death has been reported at this time. The news was shared by D.O.A. on social media, the band revealing that Card had died yesterday (April 8). \"RIP old friend,\" they wrote.\n\nCard was born in Zweibrücken, Germany, while his father was stationed in the Royal Canadian Air Force. The drummer spent the majority of his youth in Calgary, and founded the band Plasticide there in his teenage years. He eventually joined cult-favourite Winnipeg band Personality Crisis and played on their 1983 album, Creatures for Awhile."
