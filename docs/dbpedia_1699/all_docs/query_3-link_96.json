        "text": "The year 1983 began like any other year in Canada's West Coast province. Then suddenly everything changed when the newly elected provincial government announced an avalanche of far-right legislation that shocked the country. In response, a resistance movement called Solidarity quickly formed across British Columbia uniting social activists, trade unionists and people who had never protested before. The movement rocked social foundations resulting in massive street protests, occupations, and plans for an all-out general strike. Filled with revealing interviews and lively, insightful prose Solidarity goes behind the scenes of one of the greatest social uprisings in North American history. In revisiting this one singularly dramatic event, Solidarity chronicles the history of 20th century British Columbia, exploring its great divides and alliances, cultures and subcultures, and conflicts that continue into the 21st century.\n\nThe book is lively, engaging, and highly informative about what was going on behind the scenes. - Labour/Le Traivail: Journal of Canadian Labour Studies\n\nA compelling portrayal of the landscape that roused dozens of groups - diverse in age, culture, and beliefs - to work together.
