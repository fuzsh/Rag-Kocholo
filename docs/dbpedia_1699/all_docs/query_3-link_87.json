Discover now January and February 2023 punk news! A friend called the meganews the way bands and others have a chance to say “Hey we exist!” as Maximum Rocknroll used to do, and we absolutely cannot let go of this archival work. The meganews work is long and laborious, but what can we say… Your feedback gives us the energy to go on and we invite you to give us your opinions by writing to us. We will always be happy to reply!\n\nHOW CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR NEW RELEASES?\n\nIf you are a label, a publisher, a band and want to let us know about your new releases, or simply know about something new, you can:\n\n– Fill out this form.\n\n– Add our address info@radiopunk.it to your mailing list.\n\nWe say when a release is available in our distro. For orders or info contact us via DM on instagram or via e-mail atinfo@radiopunk.it. See full catalog here.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nPunk is an attitude for us, if it was only music we would’t have opened, so not merely musically punk topics are welcome – this is why you can also add Antifa, against repression demonstrations, etc. – if they share the attitude. Militant hip hop, ska, blues, and songwriting are welcome provided that they share with punk spaces and values that are its basis.\n\nIMPORTANT! Listening and discovering new stuff is cool, but if you can buy the physical copy to support bands and labels and if you have the opportunity to donate, every little help is actually a big help.\n\nWould you like to help us make our meganews better?

A hard, liberating record in which they tried to render the mixture of emotions that has accompanied them in the past years by juxtaposing more scratchy tracks. Among the tracks of “Il Tempo Di Un Momento” they vented frustrations and anxieties between the distortions of the title track and La Risposta, and then sought some peace lulled by the suggestions of quieter, more contemplative tracks. Whether skapunk rants or gentle rocksteady, “Il Tempo di un Momento” recounts the myriad feelings that have overwhelmed the band in recent years: it is about stalled projects, broken dreams, bewilderment and loneliness, but also the joy of finding each other, hugging, dancing and starting to make music together again.\n\nBand: Home Front\n\nVideo: Faded State\n\nAlbum: Games Of Power out on March 3\n\nSubgenre: punk, new wave, rock n roll\n\nPhysical format: LP\n\nFrom: Canada\n\nLabel: la Vida es un mus\n\nWhere to listen\n\nAvailable in our distro: not available\n\nInfo: due out March 3, the band’s album mixes punk, new wave, indie, pop, rock n roll into a truly unique and brilliant formula.

This production is dedicated to all humble, hard-working people, the worker, the farmer, the laborer, the miner, and all those struggling for a better quality of life.
