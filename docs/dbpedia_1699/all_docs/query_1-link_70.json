        "text": "The Edmonton Free School\n\nSaturday 19 May 1:30PM\n\nLocation: Humanities 1-14, The University of Alberta\n\nAll-Ages, All-Welcome\n\n“Punk and Protest: Laws, Counterculture, Action!”\n\nIn the late-1970s and early 1980s, the Vancouver punk scene was a vibrant and diverse community. We’ll look at originators like Joey “Shithead” Keithley, his group DOA, and another local band called The Subhumans. Gerry “Useless” Hannah, The Subhuman’s bass player, was a member of the activist group Direct Action. These dissenters were arrested by the RCMP for attacks against property, which sparked a media firestorm. We’ll also discuss Vancouver participants in relation to the wider punk milieu, and the 1980s’ counterculture as a whole.\n\nReadings:\n\nAmerican Hardcore, pp. 256-260.\n\nThe Philosophy of Punk, pp. 112-114.\n\nI, Shithead, pp. 125-127.\n\n“The Vancouver 5”\n\nHannah’s Maximum Rocknroll column, 1984.\n\nToronto Star, 15 October 1982, p. A1\n\nToronto Star, 15 October 1982, p. A3.\n\nPlaylist:\n\nDuff McKagan recalls the Pacific Northwest punk scene\n\nChris Arnett: The FuriesThe Skulls move to Toronto\n\nVancouver punk scene’s D.I.Y. recording history\n\nHenry Rollins on DOA\n\nThe Stiffs – “Fuck You”\n\nDishrags – “I Don’t Love You” live 1979DOA – “Disco Sucks”\n\nDOA – “World War III”\n\nThe Subhumans – “Firing Squad”\n\nThe Subhumans – “Slave to my Dick”\n\nDOA – “Trial by Media”\n\nWhen you’re doing historical research, you can be pretty rest assured of a few things:\n\n1) You’re going to have to read a lot of books.\n\n2) You’re going to have to spend a lot of time in the library.\n\n3) You’re going to have to spend a lot of time in the archive (this is different from the library, but only slightly).\n\n4) You’re going to have to forgo any sort of social interaction for long periods of time.\n\nSometimes, though, depending on your topic, you have to get creative with your methodology. Such was the case when Joey “Shithead” Keithley played an afternoon gig at the Black Dog in Edmonton. The frontman for the seminal Vancouver punk band D.O.A., Keithley was a major part of the punk milieu during the 1980s (and ever since). So in the name of historical understanding, I had to put down my book, venture out of the library, and walk past the archive and head to the pub. Once there I had to order a pint from the barman, sit down in front of the stage, and utilize the handy coasters on the table to carry out my important research.\n\nThis was the result:\n\n(more…)\n\nNow then, here’s part III. You may have noticed that the theme of this blog is supposed to be about the American underground music scene. BUT here I am yattering on about a Canadian band, and “direct actions” that occurred in Canada. Well fear not: This is the part of the story that explores the wider punk community and that means I bring in AMERICA.\n\nWell, eventually I might mention them, so read on!\n\n(more…)\n\nNow then, here’s part deux. So I promised I’d show how there were links between Direct Action and the underground punk scene in Vancouver. Well actually, the links even extended through the overall punk network in North America, but before we go into that wider story I have to tell you this: Gerald Hannah, member of Direct Action and was also known as Gerry Useless, and he was a founding member of the Vancouver band the Subhumans. Not to be, of course, confused with the Subhumans.\n\n(more…)"
