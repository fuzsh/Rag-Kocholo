        "text": "Here’s the rest of my Top Ten Favorite Albums. These are the ones I would grab first if my collection was on fire. These are albums that I can listen to no matter what time of day it is, no matter what mood I’m in, no matter how many times I’ve heard them before.\n\n5. David Bowie – The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars (1972)\n\nDavid Bowie’s concept album has been hugely influential. The lightning bolt logo Marilyn Manson used during his Antichrist Superstar days looks very similar to the one Bowie used during his Ziggy Stardust tour. Beyoncé’s I Am…Sasha Fierce is similar to Ziggy Stardust in that it’s a concept album based on an alter ego. Ziggy Stardust is the album that got me into David Bowie and it is still my favorite album of his. The concept itself, something about an androgynous rock star and outer space, has always been lost on me without reading someone else’s explanation. It’s been said that the album has social commentary, but I find that to be a broad term that you can apply to almost anything. None of that matters anyway when you have an album this solid and enduring. I’m not sure what else to say about it that hasn’t already been said somewhere else.\n\n4. Budgie – Never Turn Your Back On A Friend (1973)\n\nYet another 1970’s three-piece powerhouse on my Top Ten list. Being from suburban Pennsylvania and having grown up in the late 1980’s/early 1990’s, my friends and I found out about Budgie from Metallica’s cover of “Crash Course In Brain Surgery” on their The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited. Somewhere along the line I heard their cover of “Breadfan” on a bootleg cd of Metallica demos. Over the years I’ve been fortunate to find Budgie’s essential first five albums on vinyl. They are all the Budgie you really need and whenever they show up in record stores in my area they sell very quickly. Later efforts such as If I Were Brittania I’d Waive The Rules and Impeckable are somewhat disappointing. Never Turn Your Back On A Friend is the best of the first five records. The most challenging aspect of playing it is listening to the whole album without going back to play “Breadfan” just one more time.\n\n3. The Subhumans – Incorrect Thoughts (1980)\n\nNo, not the British band, this is the Canadian band called The Subhumans. I first heard them in elementary school listening to my sister’s copy of the Alternative Tentacles Records punk comp Let Them Eat Jellybeans. Originally issued on a Canadian record label called Friends Records, the album was later remixed and reissued without the band’s permission by a label called CD Presents. In 2005 The Subhumans reunited but were unable to get the rights back to the material for reissue, so they went back to the studio and re-recorded the songs. In 2010 they were released them as an album called Same Thoughts Different Day. Incorrect Thoughts – whatever incarnation you choose – should have a place in every collection of classic punk rock. But it flies undeservedly below the radar for many music fans. It is edgy yet melodic punk music with rock and roll undercurrents and intelligent lyrics. A follow-up album No Wishes No Prayers was released posthumously in a limited run of 1000 copies in 1983 on SST records after the band broke up.\n\n2. The Monks – Black Monk Time (1966)\n\nOne of the most unusual bands to be featured on the Rhino Records Nuggets cd box set, this is one group that was way ahead of their time. They have a musical style all their own. Driving rhythms with odd timing, and a lineup that includes an electric banjo make for music that defies description. At times it sounds like Calliope music from another planet. The vocals are wild and raspy, sometimes howling out strange lyrics. And it’s all very infectious and highly listenable, if you’re not afraid to venture outside of your comfort zone a little. Black Monk Time first pressings are highly elusive and you may expect to pay well into the triple digits for one. But the good news is that Light In The Attic has released a beautiful double LP version and it sounds crystal clear. A compilation double album of mostly demo material called The Early Years 1964-1965 is also available.\n\n1. Roky Erickson and The Aliens – The Evil One (aka Five Symbols) (1980)"
