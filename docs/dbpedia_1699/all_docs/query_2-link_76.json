Take your choice in how to label them – Punk, UK82, Crusty, etc, – there lies the attraction and consequent reason for their popularity, the band epitomizes non-conformity and connects with people in many different scenes.\n\nForming in 1980, recording and releasing a series of live and demo cassette tapes on their own Bluurg label, they continued to release music throughout the 80’s – building a powerhouse of a back catalog that completely stands the test of time.\n\nTheir debut LP ‘The Day the Country Died’ (1983), with its Orwellian influence, is considered by many to be a classic and has sold in excess of 100,000 copies. The second album, ‘From the Cradle to the Grave’, came swiftly the following year (1984), and although the same frenetic pace is in evidence, this marks a significant musical development for the band.\n\nIn 1985 Subhumans broke up, citing the usual musical differences, although had managed to release a third, maybe ironically entitled, LP ‘Worlds Apart.’ A final LP was released posthumously in 1986, ‘29:29 Split Vision,’ a further demonstration of how far the band had come musically from their initial leanings.\n\nDick Lucas subsequently joined Culture Shock and then formed political ska-punk band Citizen Fish in 1990, both bands releasing many albums, and still playing today. Subhumans had a couple of reunion shows in the nineties, before a more permanent return for the 21st century, including several major tours of the US, the first resulting in the ‘Live in a Dive’ LP.\n\nThe Subhumans then released a further studio album in 2007, ‘Internal Riot,’ again on Bluurg Records. The band is still passionate and angry, illustrated by Dick saying “Being in a band is the source of most of my passion and drive! The live experience of sharing it with people keeps it ongoing, the release of anger, frustration and initially negative/destructive states of mind is a release from the downward spiral of keeping it all bottled up and it feels positive/constructive as a result.”\n\nIn 2019, Subhumans released their latest record “Crisis Point” on Pirates Press Records, an album that displayed ferocity and poignancy which demonstrated why Subhumans have been one of the most famed punk bands of the last half-century. Filled with the same energy that Subhumans have embodied since the early 80s, “Crisis Point” took its place alongside their other classic records as a fan-favorite album.\n\nUpon the release of Crisis Point, Subhumans have toured Europe and the U.S. extensively, including an appearance as part of Pirates Press Records’ “Rock The Ship” event where they played aboard an aircraft carrier, which can be recapped in this video."
