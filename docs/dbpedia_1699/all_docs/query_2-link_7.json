I have been getting the old 7\"s but was curious how the 2008 vinyl remasters sound.\n\n...or go with original 80's pressings or even the mid 90's which is a mix of what I had. Anyone own both 80's and 90's and compare those? Any major differences? For this I don't mind minor, I will get whatever. But if one is clearly better I would like it.\n\nanyone?\n\nI picked up a few 80's pressings. a bit noisy. but Worlds Apart and Split Vision are as good as I remember. now I am really curious how the remasters sound. loss of dynamics and louder? more punchy? cleaner?"
