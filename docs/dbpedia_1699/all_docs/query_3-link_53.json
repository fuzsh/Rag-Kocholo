        "text": "Paula Maust\n\nIn 1855, Sarah Mary Fitton (c.1796–1874) anonymously published a harmony book covering topics ranging from the rudiments of Western classical music theory to chromatic harmony. Structured as a series of thirty-six conversations between Mother and Edward, Conversations on Harmony was intended “to explain the rules of Harmony, in so simple a manner, as to bring their practical application within the reach of young students, and, also to increase the pleasure of mere lovers of music by enabling them to understand, in some degree, the theory of ‘sweet sounds.’”[1] The book was quite successful: it received praise from numerous critics, was printed in several editions, and was translated to French by Fitton herself and distributed in Paris. Fitton was likely born in Dublin and presumably educated by her father and the local organist. She worked as a governess and author throughout the UK and Paris, publishing children’s books, scientific works, and a primer on reading music.\n\nConversations on Harmony emerged at a time when musical literacy and effective pedagogical methods were of growing importance to the English public. Substantial parliamentary funding coupled with significant educational reform in the late 1830s ensured that most English citizens would learn the fundamentals of music in school. A plethora of singing schools and musical societies across the UK also attracted thousands of adult pupils from all social classes, and lectures by musical specialists drew massive crowds. By 1856, a London periodical noted that “Thousands have now some practical knowledge of the rudiments of harmony where hundreds did not possess it twenty years ago.”[2] During the same time period, the conversation book genre emerged as a pedagogical method that would be more effective than rote memorization. Music theory books structured as a dialogue between a student and teacher were certainly not a new idea. Conversations on Harmony, however, falls into a distinct genre of nineteenth-century instructional conversation books that were nearly all authored by Englishwomen and intended for educating children and the public on topics such as the political economy, mineralogy, church polity, and science.[3] Most of these books featured conversations between a mother and her children or a female teacher and her pupils.\n\nAlthough a dialogue between a mother and child might be considered rudimentary or even insignificant, a closer examination of Conversations on Harmony reveals that Fitton was, in fact, actively engaged in some of the most critical midcentury scholarly discourses in the field of music theory. After thirty-five conversations on rudiments, harmony, melody, and voice-leading, Fitton concludes Conversations on Harmony with analyses of excerpts by Beethoven, Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart. Mother’s final remark to Edward is “And now you will not find it difficult to analyze, in the same manner, any piece of music, vocal or instrumental,” to which Edward responds: “I cannot tell you what pleasure it gives me, to be able to distinguish the nature of all the notes, of which music is composed.”[4] Perhaps this seems unsurprising given Fitton’s clear objectives in the book’s preface. Yet the study of harmony as a means of simply understanding music, rather than as a practical tool to aid in improvisation and composition, was a newly-emerging concept at the time. Until Albert Day’s 1845 Treatise on Harmony, most English harmony books were primarily thoroughbass and counterpoint manuals that were based on slightly expanded versions of Rameau’s theories.[5] Day’s radical new theories on free chromaticism resulted in the publication of numerous critiques in the ensuing decades, which formed a burgeoning body of scholarship focused more on harmonic analysis and theory than on thoroughbass and counterpoint. [6] As such, Conversations on Harmony was published at the perfect convergence of a progressively more musically literate public and the emergence of musical analysis as a scholarly discipline.\n\nA noteworthy example of public music theory, Conversations on Harmony was repeatedly lauded for both its clarity and its inherent pedagogical value to students and teachers. The Daily News even asserted that the book filled a much-needed gap in the literature, noting that\n\n“Treatises on the theory of music…when merely elementary, are too general in their explanations and too scanty in illustration to be of much service to anybody; and when more pretentious in design, they assume too much previous information…to suit the generality of amateurs. It has always appeared to us that there was still wanting a work on this subject more suitable to average comprehensions…This desideratum we think the ‘Conversations on Harmony’ has well supplied.”[7]\n\nOne particularly effective method that renders the book successful is the variety of conversational strategies Fitton employs to create a nuanced dialogue. For example, Mother occasionally provides an explanation of one concept that includes new terminology or notational symbols, naturally inspiring Edward to broach the next topic. When comparing compound and simple meters, Mother provides the following example of quadruple meters (Figure 1).\n\nEdward then replies “In our last example of Common Time you forgot to write any notes in the bar.” Mother goes on to say “I placed a sign there, called a Rest, instead, which represents the value of that bar. A particular kind of sign, or rest, is used to supply the place of each sort of note…”[8]\n\nPerhaps Fitton’s most impactful contribution to nineteenth-century public music theory was the extraordinary clarity of her prose. The Musical World declared that “The rule of fifths and octaves is the pons asinorum of young musicians. We never before saw it so thoroughly well explained as in this [Fitton’s] treatise.”[9] The rule of fifths and octaves is explained by Fitton in five concise rules, each with an accompanying illustration. Fitton’s Rule #4, for example, is “Two parts must never, on any account, form either two intervals of a perfect fifth, or two intervals of an octave, in succession, not even by contrary movement.”[10] (Figure 2).\n\nBy contrast, Day writes four separate rules to illustrate this single concept, each of which is more verbose than Fitton’s one rule. For example, one of Day’s rules is “Octaves by contrary motion, or what is equivalent thereto, the progression from an octave to an unison or from an unison to an octave (though allowed by most writers), should not be used, as the richness of the harmony would be thereby destroyed.”[11]\n\nMaking complex harmonic concepts accessible to a broad public readership is no small task, and that Fitton’s Conversations on Harmony so successfully achieved this aim is a testament to her thorough understanding of effective pedagogical strategies and her skillful prose. Conversations on Harmony and other examples of public music theory call to mind issues of accessibility. Undergraduate harmony courses have often been used as a means of gatekeeping, yet many of the most advanced concepts in those courses are presented with extraordinary clarity in Fitton’s conversations. While there is no perfect way to reach every student, books like Conversations on Harmony can serve as critical reminders that there are many creative and accessible ways to teach “the theory of ‘sweet sounds.’”\n\nBibliography\n\nCherubini, Luigi.

Fitton’s book received at least eight substantial reviews in the months after it was published, most of which engaged substantially with the theoretical content of the book and praised Fitton’s clarity. On November 17, 1855, The Musical World’s review asserted that “It is quite equal to any book we know of its peculiar scope, and superior to many in its clear exposition of details. By its help, the young student will without doubt, gain a satisfactory foothold, at least, within the limits of a not easily accessible subject.” Likewise, the review of the book in the November 3, 1855 Leicester Chronicle praised Fitton’s “lucid simplicity” and elevated the book’s credibility by mentioning “two of the best judges of musical sciences:” Cipriani Potter (the Principal of the Royal Academy of Music and the book’s dedicatee” and Vincent Novello (the book’s printer).\n\n[10] Fitton, Conversations on Harmony, 61.\n\n[11] Alfred Day, Treatise on Harmony (London: Harrison and Sons, 1885), 12.\n\nStefano Mengozzi\n\nProf. Long’s recent observations on hexachordal solmization raise several issues that cannot be fully teased out in blog format. The one overarching question I would like to pose for an initial response is the following: I have no doubt that solmization “just makes sense” as a method for singing Renaissance polyphony, and that it has changed Prof. Long’s understanding of Renaissance polyphony substantially. But why is it so, precisely? Which mechanism(s) or musical relationships does solmization trigger in the mind that wouldn’t otherwise surface? I suggest that solmization works not because it mirrors the hexachordal structure of the music, but rather because it highlights the affinity of the diatonic pitches at the fourth and at the fifth in a heptachordal, two-semitone universe—Guido’s rationale for introducing the syllables to begin with.[1] The very notion that Western music of the pre-modern era was hexachordally-coded (often tacitly assumed when not explicitly stated) is not easily reconciled with the observation that both the modal system (no matter which one) and the grammar of counterpoint unquestionably assumed the octave as the basic yardstick, to which the hexachord could only take second seat. Thus, the “mental map of musical space” that we may newly construct after re-familiarizing ourselves with Guido’s method is unlikely to be a hexachordal one, as Prof. Long appears to suggest throughout her blog. The practice of solmization itself points to such a conclusion: singing all semitones as mi-fa will not and should not erase the aural recognition of the different positions of the diatonic semitones within the modal octave, appropriately marked by the different litterae E-F and B-C (or A-Bb). More importantly, hexachords do not reflect pitch hierarchies, which are key to marking the beginning and the end of diatonic segments, especially those claiming structural priority: the same pitch will often fall on two different syllables, just as the same syllable will often indicate different pitches. In fact, since the hexachords overlap with one another, it is virtually impossible to tell where one ends and where the next begins.\n\nIn Giovanni Maria Lanfranco’s Scintille di musica cited by Prof. Long (Lanfranco 1533), the two lambda-shaped graphs of the “Scala delle mutationi di be quadro” and “del be molle”complicate author’s own reference to “sounds conceived in the mind by means of the six singable syllables”[2] (see Figs. 1 and 2 below):\n\nTranslation of the caption: “For the reasons given above, on the first [lowest] note of the scale we will say ‘fa’ because it falls on F, a ‘stable’ pitch of the ‘Scala di be quadro.’[3] On the second we will say ‘sol’ and on the third ‘re’ because it coincides with a point of mutation, as shown by the black note, which will always correspond to ‘re’ when ascending. On the highest note one says ‘fa’ because it is also on F. When descending we will say ‘la’ on the black notes, as they are found in the places of regular mutations.”\n\nTo begin, in response to an important point in Prof. Long’s blog, these graphs point to the two Scale as mutually exclusive, confirming Lanfranco’s heptachordal conception of diatonic space despite his own wording elsewhere in the treatise. More specifically, such diagrams provide a different angle into Renaissance notions of diatonic space than the more familiar genre of introductory gamuts (such as the one from Gumpelzhaimer’s Compendium musicae, shown at the end of Prof. Long’s blog, or the one from Lanfranco 1533, p. 6), in that they show the actual yoking of letters and syllables in the fray, rather than as abstract sets placed in different portions of the graph. Even though there are no actual syllables in the two graphs, we may surmise that singers would have superimposed them onto the ladder more or less in line with Lanfranco’s instructions: that is to say, by singing every black note as re going up and as la going down, and by properly “deducing” the syllables of the other notes, the scala will be intoned with the correct sequence of tones and semitones (this should not suggest that the syllables are needed to achieve that result). One notable point here is that ut, often described as the root of each hexachord,[4] is never actually used in the Scala di be quadro and is deployed only on the lowest F of the Scala del be molle. Furthermore, it is important to realize that the black notes punctuate the ladder alternatively after four and five notes—a “limping” pace that by itself betrays the primacy of the octave and its asymmetrical internal division into a tetrachord and a pentachord.[5] Regular periodicity occurs only in seven-note cycles (as in G-re and g-re, or a-la and A-la).\n\nThus, Lanfranco’s singer is invited to rely on a transposable set of six syllables to cover the entire diatonic terrain, but since the necessary mutations take place every four or five notes, those are the de facto audible segments of musical space that for better or worse impact musical experience. It would be a stretch, in my view, to imagine that Renaissance singers (let alone listeners) would have inferred the rest of the hexachord when singing only portions of them in practice. One might well infer la of the old hexachord when singing re of the new one, but what about the ut below that new re? What would be the musical import of such hexachordal inferences, anyway? Furthermore, the fact that one almost never touches the outer pitches of the hexachord going up (ut and la), while stepping repeatedly on la on the way back, appears to be entirely non-consequential. In short: Lanfranco’s graphs show that the syllabic hexachords populating the standard medieval and Renaissance gamuts do not play a role qua hexachords, and are not meant to be audible as such; rather, they are comparable to identical pieces of raw fabric to be cut up and partly discarded in order to fit a pre-determined shape.\n\nFor a more plausible insight into the kind of hearing promoted by solmization we may turn to Guido’s notion of affinitas: according to that key doctrine, Dis similar to A in that they both have the same sequence of tones and semitones above (TSTT), though they differ on the quality of the third below (minor for D, major for A in the “Scala di be quadro”). Thus, they may be both labeled re for sight-singing purposes, and marked with the same black note in the graphs of mutations, though they ultimately have different positions within the uneven portions of fourths and fifths in those same graphs. Only pitches in the same position in the 7-note wheel (D-re/d-re or A-re/a-re) are diatonically identical, which is why they are labeled with the same littera AND syllable. So, when singing a D protus melody it is surely revealing, and even music-analytically interesting, to place la on both D and A as the occasion demands it: the solmization has cognitive significance in that it highlights the close diatonic relationship of those two pitches within the octave, so close indeed that A was regarded as a viable protus ending. Similarly, Guido’s method draws attention to the same relationship of affinitas at the fourth or fifth between the other pairs of pitches in the gamut.\n\nOne should be weary of generalizing too broadly after looking at one graph, of course. Yet, in my view there is significant evidence elsewhere suggesting that the placement of the ut-la segments on litterae a fourth or fifth apart (beginning on F, C, and G) was more consequential for medieval and Renaissance musicians, and more revealing of how a brain on hexachordal solmization actually functions, than the mere size of those segments.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBabb, Warren, transl. 1978.

The responses ran the gamut of systems — some folks grew up on fixed do, others on moveable do with la-based minor, others developed idiosyncratic systems based on their instruments, others learned hand signs. But one theme was consistent in all of the responses: whatever system we learned as young musicians, it profoundly shaped the way we hear and understand music, because it helped us build out our personal mental map of musical space. But how?[1]\n\nOver the last few years, I’ve learned how to sing Renaissance music using hexachordal solmization (with the help of user-friendly resources by Anne Smith (2011) and Elam Rotem). My hope was that learning this skill would help me understand sixteenth-century music better, and indeed solmization has completely changed how I hear, sing, and interpret this repertoire. The hexachord system comes with its own assumptions and opportunities that are distinct from those of contemporary fixed and moveable do, and I’ve found that hexachordal solmization just makes sense when I’m singing a Lasso motet from parts, or, more anachronistically, analyzing a Marenzio madrigal in score.\n\nSome scholars (e.g. Mengozzi 2010) have critiqued the application of rudimentary sixteenth-century pedagogy to sixteenth-century repertoire. Professional musicians surely did not sight read music on syllables, so why should we assume that syllables were compositionally meaningful? I believe that our internalized sense of tonal space shapes how we hear and play, regardless of whether or not we explicitly (or mentally) articulate syllables in our own professional practice. Indeed, some 16th-century music theoretical sources confirm the centrality of this kind of implicit knowledge in contemporary thought. For instance, Italian music theorist Giovanni Maria Lanfranco (1533), paraphrasing Gaffurius, noted:\n\nAny piece can be sung in three ways. The first is to solfa, and to utter the name of the notes, that is, ut re mi fa sol la, as schoolboys do. The second is just to utter the sound and the note conceived in the mind, leaving out the name of the syllables, as musical instruments do. The third, which pertains to singers, is the application of the words of the songs to the sounds conceived in the mind by means of the six singable syllables. (qtd. in Dean 1996)\n\nLanfranco’s testimony suggests that the act of “conceiving music in the mind” is indeed the work of conceptualizing the relationships of the solmization syllables, and using the scalar context they provide to accurately render notated music audible.[2]\n\nBut what kinds of affordances does implicit knowledge of hexachordal solmization provide? What follows are a few reflections on how hexachordal solmization illuminates the nature of sixteenth-century tonal space.\n\nFirst, solmization systems interact in productive ways with the diatonic environments they are designed to teach. If contemporary moveable do solfege reflects the seven-note diatonicity of the major scale and its capacity for transposition around the circle of fifths (via the doctrine of key signatures), then hexachordal solmization reflects the more flexible diatonicism of the Guidonian gamut, which is not a seven-note system but an eight-note system, where both B fa and B mi (that is, B-flat and B-natural) are viable diatonic pitches. The principles of mutation (and the mutation shortcut of fa super la) ensure that both B-flat and B-natural are equally accessible under the cantus durus system (with no signature); one is not a substitute for or alteration of the other. Composers often strategically exploit the contrast between these degrees for text expressive or formal ends (Long 2023). The multivalence of B fa B mi is also reflected in the distinct structure of modal collections—specifically, the ways that certain degrees, like the sixth in the Dorian mode, tend to be treated flexibly. The hexachords, the gamut, and the modes emerge as three distinct yet interconnected ways of thinking about pitch relations in sixteenth-century music, and we often need to triangulate them to get a full picture of the structure of a particular motet or mass movement.\n\nSecond, hexachordal solmization and the Guidonian gamut are tied to the notation of specific pitches—Renaissance musical thought is firmly rooted in the dual systems of cantus durus and cantus mollis (the void and one-flat systems), and the hexachords on G, C, F, and B-flat that support these systems. The hexachord system is not infinitely transposable (the existence of fictive, chromatic hexachords notwithstanding); my capacity to solmize (and indeed my conception of Renaissance tonal space more broadly) is inseparable from the notated pitch levels of Renaissance sources (regardless of the actual frequencies at which these works were performed). This kind of “notational absolute pitch” (for want of a better term) has significant ramifications for the tonal structure of Renaissance music. For instance, flats and sharps are not treated the same under hexachordal solmization. In most accounts, flats are solmized “fa” automatically; on the other hand, sharps don’t affect solmization at all (Berger 1987). Accordingly, Renaissance musicians sang, felt, and understood that the “intermingled” sharps that created cadences (leading tones and Picardy thirds) were different in kind from the more structural flatward mutation that motivated rules-of-thumb like fa super la (cf. Baragwanath 2020). A related phenomenon involves the notion of “tonal compass” (Crook 1998). We tend to assume that the pitches available to composers are regulated by the limitations of keyboard instruments tuned in meantone temperament. But they are also regulated, conceptually, by solmization. The mutations required to introduce flats mean that motets and mass movements seldom include more than one flat beyond the signature. But composers will use up to four sharper notes—so works in cantus mollis (the one-flat system) tend to extend no further flatward than E-flat, but as far sharp as G-sharp.\n\nFinally, hexachords provide a framework for navigating the diatonic system rooted in linear rather than vertical relationships. (One way to understand this distinction is to observe that octave equivalence is downplayed in hexachordal solmization: we might sing the G below middle C as ut and the G an octave above it as sol, acknowledging the distinct melodic contexts of these two degrees within the ambitus of their respective voice parts. The distinct solmization syllables we apply here do not compromise a composer’s capacity to treat a G ut/G sol simultaneity as an octave.) Attending to linear solmization patterns pays huge dividends in performance. For instance, the imitative exposition of a motet often involves a soggetto which appears at two (or even three) pitch levels with the same solmization—this technique was so common that Renaissance theorists even gave it a special name, fuga, as distinct from imitazione (Haar 1971, Long 2023). Such solmization patterns certainly facilitate group sight singing, but they also lay bare the contrapuntal structure of dense canonic passages in real time (and indeed facilitate the composition of such passages). But these patterns also help singers trained in solmization to internalize stock melodic patterns, to feel the unique characteristics of different modal collections, and to navigate melodic relationships that occur at multiple pitch levels without invoking unwieldy concepts like modulation or modal commixture.[3]\n\nI’m fascinated by the unique affordances of hexachordal solmization as it was learned and practiced by sixteenth-century musicians, and how the hexachordal system exists in symbiosis with both modal theory and the polyphonic repertoire. And I’m struck by the staying power of this 1000-year-old pedagogical method, which has been modified and manipulated dozens of times to suit changes in musical style, from its initial conception in the eleventh century to the two-hexachord system advocated by sixteenth-century pedagogues (Mengozzi 2010) to the eighteenth-century solfeggio tradition (Baragwanath 2020) to the modern pedagogical drama between advocates of do-based and la-based minor. We have much to gain from considering in more detail how our solmization systems interact with and even shape their attendant musical styles and the ways that composers, singers, and other musicians navigate these styles.\n\nImages\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBaragwanath, Nicholas. 2020.

Dolby thought up a music video concept and pitched it to his producers first, then wrote a dance track to go with it. The strategy worked. A few years later, Dolby and collaborators created another set of viral hits: a file format called Rich Music Format (RMF), followed by a plugin called Beatnik which enabled users to create original music (Herring 2014). The Beatnik plugin soon became a cornerstone of early Internet music theory culture, as programmers used it to create a wide range of music theory learning programs that could be distributed over computer networks in the 1980s and ‘90s.\n\nIn this blogpost, I describe how North American music theorists in the 1970s-90s were “blinded by science” during the Internet revolution, which both disconnected them from many humanities fields as well as afforded them material and social benefits. This relatively early investment in the Internet from music theorists led to a rise in perceived scholarly legitimacy and a steady increase of institutional support for “music theory” as a position and an activity. This blogpost is a companion to my recent chapter “Music Theory and Social Media” (2022), which offered an overview of “music theory” as it circulates on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit. There my focus was recent (post-2000) examples of music theory online, such as discussion groups, trends, memes, and clickbait. Here I discuss an earlier era of music theory on the English-language Internet, pre-2000.\n\nThe social media music theorists of today, whether they know it or not, are building on a lineage of Internet music theorists going back at least to the 1970s. Early Internet music theorists used their own version of Dolby’s prescient pop strategy; they adopted new media in its nascent state to create viral music theoretical tools that built the foundation for social media music theorists with millions of clicks and views in 2022.\n\nDigging into archives, interviews, digital media histories, and a range of online material, I map some of the sources that would constitute a history of music theory on the Internet. These include the first music theory lessons transmitted via networked computing, interactive websites, email lists, and electronic journals.\n\nMusic Theory and the Proto-Internet\n\nThe Internet is a confluence of technology and human influence, of inclusions and exclusions—a constantly shifting network of people and things. The term “Internet” was first used in a computer program report in 1974 as a shorthand for Internetwork (Cerf et Al. 1974).[i] The origins of networked computing (“the Internet”), however, are not traceable to any particular person or invention, rather to a series of interrelated happenings and to relationships between technologies, people, and organizations. Histories of the Internet often wrongly imply that predecessor networks were built primarily for government purposes. The case of music theory demonstrates why such an implication is misleading. While some parts of early networked computing were tied to government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense, others were not. One such example was the PLATO system, an emergent computer network which began at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UI), and spread to other learning institutions in the 1970s-1990s.[ii]\n\nSome of the first online music theorists were those who created music theory software for PLATO or were schooled by the PLATO system. PLATO’s instruction materials covered a range of subjects, from elementary math to university-level chemistry and, starting in 1970, music and music theory (Dear 2017, 175-191).[iii] PLATO was also a cornerstone in the history of cyberculture, being a testing ground and fountainhead for a range of significant cyberculture concepts, including message boards, forums, emailing, direct messaging, picture-based languages (the first digital emojis were created on PLATO IV in 1972 by Bruce Parello, a UI student), remote screen sharing, and interactive gaming.\n\nA team at the UI School of Music, led by G. David Peters, worked from 1970-1994 on a PLATO-delivered system of online music instruction. PLATO had a voice synthesizer called Votrax and a synthetic woodwind instrument called the Gooch Synthetic Woodwind, named after inventor Sherwin Gooch (later renamed the Gooch Cybernetic Synthesizer). Its music theory lessons were similar to flashcards, with questions such as “What note is a major third above G?”\n\nPLATO’s music instruction materials were tested by dozens of UI professors in their music theory courses (Dear 2017, 186-7). Later they were adopted by other institutions, such as University of Delaware, University of Hawaii, and Indiana University. Delaware acquired PLATO terminals in the 1970s, including the music lessons called GUIDO.[iv] Hawaii gained telephone access to four ports on the University of Illinois’ PLATO System in May 1977.[v] Indiana adopted in the 1980s the PLATO system of music dictation drills, keyboard lessons, ear training, composition instruction, and theory exercises. A version of PLATO was created for Apple II in the 1980s, leading to more widespread usage of the system, and a larger platform for testing different kinds of music lessons.\n\nMusic Theory Online: The First Music Theory E-Journal\n\nAs computer networking became more widespread in the 1980s, researchers in a range of mostly-STEM fields began experimenting with digital publishing. By 1990, major scientific organizations were embracing the idea that e-journals could compete with traditional print journals. The hope for these e-journals was that they would initiate a major shift in the nature of scholarly communication. Patricia A. Morgan, director of publications for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, put it this way: “It’s a race. We want to be first” (Wilson, 1991).\n\nMusic theorists also strived to win “the race.” Members of the newly-formed Society for Music Theory (SMT) were interested in developing music theory publications to help legitimize the society. As a handful of academic theorists were tuned to happenings in STEM fields, they began to float the idea of an electronic journal.\n\nTheir e-journal would need a digital distribution method. Other e-journals were distributed through email lists—something the SMT had in “smt-list”, the list-serv created in 1990-1991 by Lee Rothfarb and Jane Clendinning.[vi] Rothfarb took the lead, going to the UNIX administrator at Harvard, Tom Heft, with a “cool idea” for an online music theory magazine. Heft was enthusiastic and helped Rothfarb with programming exercises in exchange for music theory help on bass guitar.[vii]\n\nMusic Theory Online (MTO) published its first essay, “Schoenberg at the Movies: Dodecaphony and Film” by David Neumeyer, in February 1993. The SMT Executive Board voted to make MTO an official SMT journal in 1994. When Rothfarb moved from Harvard to Santa Barbara in 1994, he moved the entire operating system with him and stayed with MTO until 1999, when he became department chair and handed off journal leadership.[viii]\n\nExperimental Music Theory Projects on the Early Internet, 1980s-1990s\n\nIn the 1980s, the Internet became a testing ground for a range of different kinds of music theory projects. College courses that taught programming skills to musicians began to emerge, such as those created by Elizabeth Marvin and Aleck Brinkman.[ix] As personal computing became more feasible, followed by home Internet access, users used the net to create their own music theory content such as original websites, software, and plugins. Some formed communities on bulletin boards or forums. Others took on teaching roles through web portals such as America Online (AOL).\n\nPoundie Burstein began using the online portal AOL in 1991 after starting a faculty job in music theory. He received an email from AOL inviting him to be a music theory tutor in exchange for free AOL access, and signed up. Over time, more tutors joined in, which led to more attention—and more problems. There was no system for moderation, and no way to organize content or handle problematic messages. Trolls and spam flooded the site and eventually it was abandoned.[x]\n\nIndividual creators avoided spam death by staying off of major platforms, such as the programmers who made and distributed their own music theory software online. Keith Kothman, a faculty member at the University of Miami in the 1990s, was one. Kothman came across the Beatnik plugin in 1998, which came with a downloadable set of General MIDI sounds that could be controlled via JavaScript (JS).\n\n“I used it to program intervals and chords as objects, with built-in context for practice and clues,” Kothman recalls. “For example, a m7 wants to resolve to a 3rd, like in V7 – I. With Beatnik, I could play individual tones with JS code, embedded in the web page.”[xi]\n\nSeveral hundred miles away, Lee Azzarello was a student at Antioch College in Ohio, using campus Internet service to organize discussions around the music programming language SuperCollider.[xii] On the now-defunct platform Hotline, Azzarello created the group “Falling Forward,” named after a hardcore punk band from Louisville, which attracted people interested in techno music, “glitch” computer art, outsider music theory, and algorithmic composition. This group continued on after Azzarello turned to other projects and continued to exist until the demise of the Hotline platform.\n\nMore music theory websites flourished in the late 1990s. José Rodriguez Alvira launched the interactive website teoria.com in 1997, as a complement to his music theory courses at the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico. musictheory.net was launched in 2000 with lessons, exercises, and different kinds of music theory calculators. In 2005, Timothy Cutler and Patricia Gray created the first Internet database of music theory examples, entitled musictheoryexamples.com. Cutler and Gray regularly receive fan mail from users based in North America, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Israel/Palestine, Great Britain, and Australia.[xiii] These are just a few examples of the online world of music theory as it was emerging.\n\nConcluding Thoughts: What Can Music Theory Do Online?\n\nNewer Internet users may not remember a time when emailing, web browsers, bulletin boards, and online journals were truly novel, nor may they think to question the existence of networked computing, online music theory conferences, or participatory musical activities on the Internet—what Paula Harper (2019) has called “viral musicking.” Even scholars occasionally misinterpret the status of the Internet, presuming it to be perfectly global, available to everyone, representative of the human population, or a stable ground of meaning. One of the paradoxes of the Internet is that it is at once a top-down organized system and a user-generated one, and this is true at many different scales.\n\nObserving rarified corners of Internet history, such as the music theory corners, can be a way of recognizing and contemplating such paradoxes. The Internet and the Society for Music Theory (SMT) both emerged around the same time. Given the connection between the early Internet and the Society for Music Theory (SMT), my research suggests that internet-generated discourse has contributed in shaping North American music theoretical discourse writ large. Members of the SMT had no special talent for computing, yet they made extensive use of computer networking long before most other humanities fields thought to do so. They created email lists and e-journals, and kept them active for decades. The SMT’s successful use of the early Internet had rippling effects on the meanings and uses of “music theory” in the United States, and globally. Since the formation of the SMT, similar societies have formed in France, Belgium, Italy, Croatia, the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, and Russia. Hiring patterns in North American higher education have changed: Prior to the late 1970s, music theory was mainly taught by composers, performers, or musicologists. The SMT promoted the idea that music theory should be taught by professional music theorists.[xiv] This effort to create careers and publishing opportunities for theorists has been well-documented, yet the significance of the Internet to these advocacy goals remains under-researched.\n\n“Music theory” is a multi-faceted and ever-changing discursive object online, bound up with complex and often contradictory logics propagated by software designers, academics, entrepreneurialism, piracy, individual user preference, algorithmic operations, and what Shoshana Zuboff (2019) calls Surveillance Capitalism—an Internet-enabled economic order in which user data is harvested for profit—all of which affects music theory beyond the net in turn. In other words, the Internet has become a significant site for music theory, which is affecting how music theory is being conceived beyond the Internet, even and perhaps especially when the Internet appears to be a mere tool for networking.\n\nIn 2022, music theory does not look like academic music theory for most people. It looks like conversations on Reddit; online “think pieces” about popular songs, artists, and trends; video essays by online creators. Academic music theorists have much to learn by acknowledging that the history of music theory is partially being written by people who are not within the academic realm. The Internet is another place for people to reinvent continuously what music theory can be: it might be an approach to fundamentals, a strictly intellectual enterprise, an embodied practice, a songwriting method, a way of communicating about sound, or something else entirely.\n\nBrinkman, Aleck R. and Elizabeth W.

In the late-1980s, Lee Rothfarb and Jane Clendinning heard from colleagues in the sciences about lists of email addresses that connected researchers within a field. In 1990, at the SMT meeting in Oakland, Rothfarb and Clendinning set up a table with a yellow legal pad to collect email addresses for what would become the first email directory for theorists. Clendinning took the list home, typed it up, and emailed it as a text-only file to Rothfarb, who took it to the Harvard Science Center Computer Administration which was next door to the music building. Together they created the text-only mailing list “smt-list” (later “smt-talk”). This was used to messages, follow discussions, and create sublists on a range of topics (e.g., set theory, tonal harmony). Eventually they found a method to archive the texts, so people could read back through old threads. For further reading, see Rothfarb (2014).

Among the twenty musical instruments is a set of sixty-five bronze bells suspended from a wooden support. Each bell is almond-shaped and emits two distinct pitches depending on the strike point. They have low inharmonicity and rapidly self-damp, making them ideal for accompanying voices and other instruments (Bagley 2005, 54–55). The middle registers contain twelve distinct pitches per octave. The pitches divide the scale more-or-less equally. Pairs of pitches separated by 3, 4, or 7 units form intervals that sound consonant, without fitting any standard European tuning system particularly closely (Lehr 1988).\n\nEach strike point is cast with a gold-inlaid inscription classifying its fixed pitch. Four root labels are identical to modern pentatonic ones: gong (^1), shang (^2), zhi (^4), and yu (^5). The fifth modern label, jue (^3), appears as well, but does not directly refer to an additional root four units above gong. Instead, jue is a suffix that indicates a transformation, in the Lewinian sense: it raises any of the four roots to which it attaches by four units. Labels for the remaining four chromatic pitch classes are generated by a second suffix, zeng, which maps those same roots upward by an additional four units. The generation of the chromatic system as a cross product of four roots and three suffixes (ø, jue, zeng) is isomorphic with the generation of the same system by transpositional combination of an all-combinatorial [0257] tetrachord with an [048] augmented triad.\n\nThe inscriptions also report a range of relative functions for each pitch. The surfaces of the larger bells, where writing space is sufficient, indicate a range of pentatonic functions for both of their constituent tones. Isomorphic to those inscriptions would be the Western understanding that, for example, the E bell functions as ^1 of the E scale, ^2 of the D scale, ^3 of the C scale, ^4 of the A scale, and ^5 of the G scale (where the scales are pentatonic). An analogous range of pentatonic functions is reported by the inscriptions on a set of 41 chime stones, also twelve to an octave, found in the tomb.\n\nI first learned of the Zeng bells from two articles (1979-80) by Yuan-Yuan Lee in Chinese Music, a publication of the Chinese Music Society of North America, and then subsequently from an archaeological monograph and a collection of metallurgical essays (von Falkenhuasen 1993; Chen et Al. 1994). In 1997, I was invited to participate in a plenary session for the annual meeting of the Society for Music Theory. Rightly guessing that this would be the biggest live audience I would ever have the opportunity to address, I picked up what I thought was a big stick, and waved it around in a slightly obnoxious way that I thought would focus some sustained attention. “One might expect,” I puffed, “that the level of interest that such a discovery might arouse in a scholarly community that identifies its domain by conjoining the terms ‘music’ and ‘theory’ might be tantamount to, say, that of a community of astronomers upon the discovery of a new moon for Jupiter. What does it say about our discipline that, for the last twenty years, we collectively yawned at or slept through this discovery, leaving its exploration to the archaeologists and materials scientists?” (Cohn 1998, par. 23). I waited for a response. But my bell rapidly self-damped, and my home field carried on with its hibernations.\n\nTwo recent developments make the Zeng bells newly relevant a quarter-century later, prompting me to what I hope is a better timed and more effective intervention. First, there is interest in responding to the global turn in the humanities, of which any reader of this blog will be keenly aware. Second, I discovered a 2005 article by Robert Bagley, a Princeton professor (now emeritus) of Chinese archaeology. If Google Scholar is to be trusted, The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory has received as yet zero citations by music theorists. Hence my only slightly ironic boast of having made a “discovery,” rather than of having merely read an article that I downloaded onto my laptop.\n\nBagley evocatively describes the inscriptions as “a book about musical scales with a demonstration CD tucked inside the back cover” (2005, 58). As such, they are “the earliest texts about music theory presently known from China” (41). The inscriptions indicate that Zeng theorists were interested in the chromatic universe as a repository for twelve (notionally) equally distributed transpositions of the pentatonic scale, each comprised of definite pitches with well-defined functions. For a modern-day music theorist trained in Western music, this last phrase rolls off the pen so naturally that it takes work to see the teeming heap of concepts, mostly independent of one another, that it compresses. Bagley does this work, unpacking the claim into what are, by my count, seven sub-claims: (1) definite pitches having (2) well-defined functions with respect to (3) twelve distinct (4) pentatonic scales, (5) co-related by transposition, and (6) evenly distributed across a gamut of (7) octave-equivalent pitches representing twelve pitch classes (72). None of this can be taken for granted, as the way that musical systems were bestowed by nature.\n\nBagley situates the Zeng bells as an ostentatious culmination to a 1,500-year-old bell-forging culture. The pointed-ellipse technology was already perfected around 2,000 B.C. Early bells were created one at a time for functional purposes, such as tracking cattle or raising alarms. No later than 1100 B.C., single bells began to be gathered to court “from the field” in order to anchor the tuning of instrumental and vocal ensembles, eventually forming small musical consorts that were acoustically matched to each other, but visually motley. One consort, dated to the 11th century B.C., chromatically filled a half-octave, suggesting an early standardization of the chromatic reservoir. Assuming that the documentary evidence from the fifth century BC also applies to bell consorts six centuries earlier, we can imagine what priorities guided the matching of bell frequencies to form pentatonic scales: maximization of acoustic consonances, certainly, but also the transposability by substitution of a single bell one unit away, for example {CDEGA} => {CDFGA} => {CDFGBb}. There is no reason to believe that pentatonic modulations occurred mid-piece, and Bagley shows that, at least in the case of the chime stones, such modulations would not have been practical. The twelve distinct pentatonic transpositions, each bell serving as the gong of its own scale, likely responded to a range of cosmological, political, or social considerations.[i]\n\nBagley (2005; 2015) argues that the closure of the 12-tone chromatic reservoir results from the fixed-pitch properties of bells. By comparison, although the seven diatonically tuned pitches of the Mesopotamian harp afford the same chain of fifth-related transpositions, by incremental retuning of single strings (Rahn 2022), each string’s infinitely continuous tuning creates no incentive to circumscribe the pitch universe and close it back to its origin. A more complicated comparison is presented by the Greek system of tonoi, first described a century after the Zeng bells were entombed, which affords at least twelve distinct transpositions, and close back to their origin (Hagel 2009, 44). Andrew Barker (1987, 107; 1989/2, 26) has suggested that this system may have arisen in response to the increasingly central position of the aulos, whose pitches are fixed like bells, but are also to some extent varied by embouchure and air pressure, partial-hole fingering, and eventually mechanical attachments (see also Hagel 2009, 337). However, knowledge of these systems is assembled indirectly, from spotty documentary evidence, most of it 500 years after the fact, supplemented by poorly preserved musical instruments, and iconography.[ii] By contrast the aural and documentary evidence of the Zeng bells is unimpeachable, backed as it is by robust metallurgical collateral, due to a 2,500-year life underground and underwater.\n\nI am grateful to Robert Bagley and David Cohen for suggestions and information.\n\nBagley, Robert. 2005. “The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory,” Proceedings of the British Academy 131: 41–90.\n\n——————. 2015. “Ancient Chinese Bells and the Origins of the Chromatic Scale.” Zhejiang University Journal of Art and Archaeology 2: 57–81.\n\nBarker, Andrew. 1987. “Text and Sense at Philebus 56a,” Classical Quarterly 37.1: 103–109.\n\n——————–. 1989.

Chung\n\n[…] Continuation of Part I […]\n\nMusic theoretical judgments help to articulate Ligon’s understandings of the human as a category also in a somewhat later portion of his book devoted to careful empirical documentation of local flora and fauna. Describing an evidently thrush-like bird, he indulges some musings about quarter tones:\n\n[It is] the colour of a Feldefare [fieldfair, Turdus pilaris], but the head seemes too big for her body, and for that reason they call her a Counsellor; her flying is extream wanton; and for her tune, ‘tis such as I have not heard any like her, not for the sweetnesse, but the strangenesse of it; for she performes that with her voice, that no instrument can play, nor no voice sing, but hers; and that is, quarter notes, her song being composed of five tones, and every one a quarter of a note higher then other. Mr. John Coprario, a rare composer of Musick, and my dear friend, told me once, that he was studying a curiosity in musick, that no man had ever attempted to do; and that was, of quarter notes; but he not being able to go through with it, gave it over: But if he had liv’d to have gone with me to the Barbadoes, this bird should have taught him.\n\n(1657, 60)\n\nFor Ligon, the Counsellor bird’s quarter tonal singing seems at first to imply a notion of species difference. The musically knowledgeable (then, just as now) could have easily refuted him, but Ligon describes the Counsellor’s quarter tonal song as that which human instruments cannot play, nor human voices sing.\n\nBut what began as an observation of putatively inhuman ability transfigures itself by the time the passage quoted above concludes with mention of the composer John Coprario. Ligon ventures that perhaps Coprario could have developed quarter tonal abilities if he could have just voyaged to Barbados to study with the Counsellor bird. An interesting rhetorical substitution has taken place. While Ligon’s description of the Counsellor bird’s quarter tonal song began stationed at the notion of the bird’s inhuman abilities, it ends by betraying a rather different notion of quarter tonal scales and intervals as merely non-English rather than non-human. But for colonial powers in the early modern Atlantic, the non-human and the non-European were intertwined categories.[1] Thus, in Ligon’s narrative, the concept of quarter tonal sound polices species, geographical, and emergent racial boundaries; and his description of the Counsellor bird alludes further to certain early modern European attitudes, which held that non-Europeans like Macow were notionally animal until proven otherwise.\n\nI am interested, ultimately, neither in condemning Ligon for being a person of his time who acquired, chafed sometimes against, and participated in its prejudices—nor in excusing him for that very fact. One point I am interested in making concerns how music theoretical knowledge and its categories, for Ligon, were part of his rhetorical machinery for reiterating some of his prejudices. But I am certainly uninterested in endorsing what I would consider to be the trite conclusion, which I shall merely describe: that Ligon, laden with the anthropological condescension customary to people like himself, nevertheless articulated a limited form of recognition towards an enslaved African and alluded to an alternate possibility to the racial animus of the colonial project. The most reflection-worthy and vexing takeaway from Ligon’s True and Exact History is not the lesson about reading historically distant subjects in proper view of their historical distantness, but a rather more disquieting possibility with eminently 21st-century relevance: that the seemingly recuperative idioms of liberal, humanist recognition can function both as explicitly benevolent judgments and implicitly as mechanisms that in fact help to advance rather than counteract projects of domination—there is actually no contradiction between these.[2] As Columbus once wrote, in his own explicitly recuperative gesture of proto-liberal humanist recognition, the intelligence he discerned in the Indigenous Taíno he met at landfall in 1492 attested for him to their potential as “good and intelligent servants.”[3] For Ligon, likewise, his admiration for Macow’s abilities was continuous his belief in the viability of enculturating enslaved people into English norms (and into English Christianity as well). One broader discursive effect of Ligon’s narrative and its musical observations is that they acted to police lines of anthropological difference that rendered non-Europeans as sub-humans or non-humans by nominating individuals like Macow as exceptions to that colonial principle, thereby presuming that ontological demarcation in the process. As music theorists continue unearthing colonial concepts in music theoretical texts and their circulation, it is worth remembering as well to excavate how music theoretical concepts circulated in colonial texts to advance colonial dominion.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nCharry, Eric. 1996. “Plucked Lutes in West Africa: An Historical Overview.” The Galpin Society Journal 49: 3–37.\n\nCoulthard, Glen Sean. 2014.

Chung\n\nAmong early modern colonizers’ narratives of the invasion and expropriation of the so-called New World, a great many and perhaps most devoted some space to documenting the musical and performance customs among the Indigenous people they encountered there and the enslaved Africans they brought there. Occasionally, even (indirect) music theoretical judgments surfaced in colonizers’ writings and their translations. For instance, ideas of Indigenous musics being poorly tuned and inharmonious helped their authors articulate broader societal and ontological judgments of non-Europeans—whose musicking always carried metaphysical, social, theological, extramusical significances to European ears.\n\nNot counting the many musicians who arrived in the Americas to establish colonial churches, one of the most musically learned authors who documented the project of advancing European settlement in the Americas was surely Richard Ligon, whose A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados (1657) offers the 17th century’s most detailed window onto the English colonial project in the Caribbean. A royalist, he left England in 1647 during its period of civil wars and bought a 50% stake in a sugarcane plantation in Barbados. Ligon was no musical slouch: he rubbed shoulders with those involved in the musical life of the crown, and was a close friend and, eventually, estate executor to the composer John Coprario (1570–1626)—a favorite of the royal family.[1] He even brought a theorbo (a long-necked lute) to Barbados.\n\nAmong scholars within and outside of music studies, one of Ligon’s most cited discussions concerns his musical encounter with a West African man named Macow (also spelled “Macaw” in the literature) enslaved on the plantation, whom he refers to as the “chiefe musition” and keeper of the plantain grove on the plantation. About the aforementioned theorbo, Ligon records that one day:\n\nHe [Macow] found me playing on a Theorbo, and sinking to It which he hearkened very attentively to; and when I had done took the Theorbo in his hand, and strooke one string, stopping it by degrees upon every fret, and finding the notes to varie, till it came to the body of the instrument; and that the neerer the body of the instrument he stops, the smaller or higher the sound was, which he found was by the shortning of the string, considered with himselfe, how he might make some trial of this experiment upon such an instrument as he could come by, having no hope ever to have any instrument of this kind to practise on. (1657, 48–49)[2]\n\nScholars have noted how Ligon assumed, in a prejudiced trope that persists today, that Africans do not practice musics involving deliberate pitch, counterpoint, and harmony.[3] In an ambivalent moment of both explicit admiration and implicit assumptions of Macow’s benightedness as a non-European, Ligon interpreted Macow’s encounter with the instrument as a demonstration of his technical ingenuity with an instrument utterly foreign to him. Ligon was unaware that West African musical cultures have used many such instruments, like the kora, gunbri, and seperewa.[4] Macow, however, as an expert practitioner of the traditions he belonged to was demonstrating an ingenuity of a completely different kind than what Ligon imagined, because he would have recognized the general principle of the theorbo’s construction from past sonic experiences on the continent he was born on.\n\nThis passage is noteworthy in a music theoretical sense because of how it alludes to quadrivial musica speculativa and its own instrumentarium. For the musically knowledgeable among the readers of his text (such as, perhaps, his friends among royal musical circles), the image of Macow stopping and striking a single string of the theorbo at various intervals would have recalled traditions of monochord experimentation and the high prestige of speculative canonics. Perhaps Ligon himself, with his own musical knowledge, pictured Macow as the musicus calculating string lengths and interval ratios before the monochord. The allusion to speculative music theoretical discourses of tuning and monochord experiments here functions to render Macow’s behavior legible within staunchly European regimes of comprehensibility.\n\nThe next episode in Ligon’s narrative is equally remarkable for its early modern crossing of anthropological judgments with music theoretical understandings of scales, solmization, and tuning and temperament. A day or two later, Ligon finds Macow in the plantain grove building a wooden idiophone. Macow was:\n\nsitting on the ground, and before him a piece of large timber, upon which he had laid crosse, sixe Billets, and having a handsaw and a hatchet by him, would cut the billets by little and little, till he had brought them to the tunes, he would fit them; for the shorter they were, the higher the Notes which he tried by knocking upon the ends of them with a sticke, which he had in his hand. When I found him at it, I took the stick out of his hand, and tried the sound, finding the sixe billets to have sixe distinct notes, one above another, which put me in a wonder, how he of himselfe, should without teaching doe so much. I then shewed him the difference between flats and sharpes, which he presently apprehended, as between Fa, and Mi: and he would have cut two more billets to those tones, but I had then no time to see it done, and so left him to his own enquiries. I say this much to let you see that some of these people are capable of learning Arts.\n\n(1657, 49)\n\nThere are numerous music theoretical conditions of possibility for how Ligon developed this passage. Ligon had to draw on understandings of hexachordal solmization to probe Macow’s hearing, understanding, and craftsmanship. Believing that Macow had no prior understanding of melodic instruments, Ligon was astonished because he thought that showing Macow his theorbo just one or two days earlier instantly enabled Macow to grasp the pitch domain of musical sound itself. Susan Scott Parrish’s analysis of this passage holds that Ligon believed Macow was mimicking the gamut of the theorbo, meaning that Ligon judged the intervallic dispositions and temperament of Macow’s instrument to be similar enough to that of his theorbo—if he indeed was interpreting the situation as Parrish describes.[5] Macow, however, was instead executing an instrumental design familiar to him perhaps to reciprocate Ligon’s organological show and tell. Ligon’s backhanded admiration for Macow and the seemingly benevolent gesture of pronouncing Macow as an exception to certain assumed “rules” about the character, abilities, and cultures of African societies is premised upon Ligon’s inability to understand musical pitch variation as a meaningful possibility among African musical practices.[6] It was with the help of music theoretical judgments that Ligon skeptically and provisionally extended some measure of anthropological inclusion and human recognition to Macow in the passage quoted above.\n\n[1] As reported by Christopher D. S. Field, “Musical Observations from Barbados, 1647-50,” The Musical Times 115, no. 1577 (1974): 565.\n\n[2] In this essay, I quote a handful of passages from Ligon’s original text. Orthographically, I have preserved 17th century spelling and punctuation, but I have converted instances of the long “s” (ie. “ſ”) to the standard “s.”\n\n[3] See Erich Nunn, “‘A Great Addition to Their Harmony’: Plantation Slavery and Musical Exchange in Seventeenth-Century Barbados,” The Global South 10, no. 2 (2016): 34–35.\n\n[4] Ligon was evidently unaware of work by Richard Jobson who, in 1623, published observations of stringed instruments in Gambia, as recorded by Dena J. Epstein, “The Folk Banjo: A Documentary History,” Ethnomusicology 19, no. 3 (1975): 350. Eric Charry notes that “Lutes have been played in West Africa since at least the fourteenth century, when both Al-‘Umarī and Ibn Battūta noted that they were used in royal ceremonies in old Mali” in Charry, “Plucked Lutes in West Africa: An Historical Overview,” The Galpin Society Journal 49 (1996): 3.\n\n[5] See Susan Scott Parrish, “Richard Ligon and the Atlantic Science of Commonwealths.” The William and Mary Quarterly 67, no. 2 (2010): 239.\n\n[6] This elevation of pitch over the time domain of music, of course, persists in all Euro-Western music theory curricula (though not without challenge in at least some classrooms).\n\n[…] Continuation: Part II […]\n\nMarcel Camprubí\n\nArabic music theory from the Abbasid period (750–1258) is a rich and sophisticated tradition that incorporates ancient Greek thought into autochthonous Arabic musical theorization and practice. Extant Arabic theoretical writings on music, which survive from the 9th century onwards, were penned by theorists mainly active in Baghdad. [1] Al-Fārābī (d. 950), author of the mighty Great Book on Music and two smaller works on rhythm, is arguably the most prominent theorist from the period.[2]\n\nThe last decade has been rightly characterized as a silver age in Arabic manuscript studies. Numerous studies have investigated the history of reading practices and knowledge transmission in the Arabic context through close scrutiny of details and paratextual information in handwritten sources.[3] The increasing digitization of Arabic manuscripts in European, North American, and Middle Eastern collections has undoubtably contributed to this trend. A correlative phenomenon has been the revalorization of the historische Hilfswissenschaften, the technical disciplines such as paleography employed to make historical evidence legible and thus, meaningful. This arsenal of techniques, once dismissed as ancillary due to being applied with naïve positivism, is being reclaimed as central to the historical project.[4]\n\nMy research focuses on the use of notation in Arabic musico-theoretical works, an area that is not well served by the existing printed materials.[5] Due to silent editorial interventions, modern editions and translations of early Abbasid writings on music present notated examples through means other than those appearing in the manuscripts. My contribution here draws attention to the kind of insights that can be gleaned when engaging with the manuscripts themselves.\n\nGreek Notation in al-Fārābī’s Great Book on Music?\n\nJamāʿa (جَماعة), a note collection or “scale,” is one of the topics that al-Fārābī addresses in the last section of his Great Book on Music. Twelve such collections, employing different genres of tetrachords within the framework of a double octave, known today as the Greater Perfect System, are visually presented in twelve double tables: the first table lists the fifteen notes of each collection and its particular intervallic configuration; the second indicates the consonances and dissonances among the pitches of the collection.[6]\n\nWhile there is much to be said about this passage of the Great Book, I want to focus on a detail that appears in just one of the extant manuscripts of al-Fārābī’s magnum opus: Istanbul, Köprülü Kütüphanesi, ms. 953; the surviving copy with the most reliable readings.[7] I present here the first table for the first jamāʿa or collection in the manuscript (Figure 1) alongside a rendering in English (Figure 2).\n\nAl-Fārābī’s jamāʿa tables work as follows: the first column consists of letters from the Arabic Abjad alphabet assigned to each note or scale degree; the second gives the name of such notes; the fourth numerically represents the pitches in the collection; and the fifth displays the intervallic relationships between consecutive notes as ratios. What distinguishes manuscript Köprülü’s rendering from that of other copies of the Great Book is the third column, featuring what appear to be modified letters from the Greek alphabet.\n\nThese signs in al-Fārābī’s Great Book resemble the notation signs of vocal music employed in the treatises of Greek theorists such as Alypius, Aristides Quintilianus, Gaudentius, and Bacchius (3rd and 4th century CE).[8] A tentative interpretation of the signs in al-Fārābī’s table may be as follows: the signs in rows 4–11 appear as a reversed psi (ψ), chi (Χ), pi (Π), reversed phi (φ), sigma (Σ), omega (ω), mu (μ), and reversed tau (Τ); in row 2 a delta (δ); rows 14–15 could be a modified omicron (ο) and epsilon (Ε). Yet, while a few individual signs can be matched to those appearing in Greek sources, al-Fārābī’s set of signs does not coincide with the ones featured in Greek notation tables. (See Figure 3 for an illustration of such tables).\n\nDespite the elusive relationship between al-Fārābī’s and Greek notation tables, Gaudentius’ Harmonic Introduction (῾Αρμονικὲ εἰσαγωγἐ) suggests that this is a possibility worth entertaining. Al-Fārābī’s numerical representation of pitches—column 4 in the table (see Figure 1 and 2)—has a precedent in Chapter 15 of Harmonic Introduction, in which Gaudentius describes this very same procedure to introduce two diagrams that are unfortunately absent in the extant manuscripts.[9]\n\nYet, divergences between Gaudentius and al-Fārābī might outweigh their ostensible similarities. Gaudentius, in the section of his Harmonic Introduction devoted to ancient Greek musical notation, argues that there cannot be a single notation sign for each note, i. e. proslambanomenos, hypate hypaton, etc. Given that different tetrachordal configurations produce dissimilar pitches, one requires a unique sign to specifically represent each of them.[10] Yet, what we find in al-Fārābī’s Great Book is precisely the opposite: all the jamāʿa tables in the Köprülü manuscript present the same identical set of signs, no matter what kind of tetrachord is employed. Therefore, in al-Fārābī’s tables these signs do not represent pitches, but rather act as a shorthand for notes as scale degrees, a function that the Arabic letters in column 1 already fulfill.\n\nThe letter-like signs in al-Fārābī’s Great Book appear as a puzzling vestige of his Greek sources. Yet, precisely identifying and substantiating al-Fārābī’s intellectual debts to specific ancient Greek writings is no simple task. While I continue working on this, I would very much welcome thoughts and feedback (camprubi@princeton.edu).

The manuscript was part of the initial collection of Köprülü Library in Istanbul, which opened its doors in 1678.\n\n[8] Greek texts in Jan, Musici scriptores graeci and Zanoncelli, La manualistica (with Italian translations). English translations in Quintilianus, On Music, tr. Mathiesen; and Mathiesen, Greek Views, 47–85.\n\n[9] Jan, Musici scriptores graeci, 343–44; Mathiesen, Greek Views, 76–7. The procedure is straightforward: taking the Proslambanomenos as starting point and assigning a certain number to it, one proceeds to allocate numerical values to the rest of scale degrees according to the specific interval ratios. The caveat is that one needs to choose an integer for the Proslambanomenos that is large enough to allow for all subsequent divisions without resulting in fractional numbers. A plain example in the table above is the octave relationship (2:1) between Proslambanomenos (1620), Mese (810), and Nete hyperbolaion (405).\n\n[10] Mathiesen, Greek Views, 79.\n\nYasemin Gökpınar\n\nIn his Great Book on Music, Abū Naṣr al‑Fārābī (d. 339/950) appeals to the science of nature (physics) and in particular to Aristotle’s lectio to reject the idea that planets and stars could generate music.[1] He thus opposes not only Pythagorean and Platonic doctrines, but also several of his predecessors within the Islamicate tradition, Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb al‑Kindī (d. c. 256/870) and Iḫwān aṣ Ṣafāʾ (ca. 10th century).[2] Instead, through a thorough training in Aristotelian writings and ideas, al‑Fārābī proposes a rather modern approach for his investigation of music. This approach will be the topic of this blog post.\n\nAmong al-Fārābī’s four surviving works on music, the Great Book on Music (Kitāb al-Mūsīqī al-kabīr) is certainly one of the most important. In the Latin Middle Ages, however, only the small chapter on music in his Iḥṣāʾ al-ʿulūm (De scientiis) was known. In it, he writes about the classification of the sciences and their respective objects. Music is counted among the mathematical sciences, which he lists in the following order: Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music, Weights and Engineering.\n\nIn the chapter on music he says the following:[3]\n\nوأمّا علم الموسيقي فإنّه يشتمل بالجملة على معرفة أصناف الألحان وعلى ما منه تؤلّف وعلى ما له ألّفت، وكيف تؤلّف، وبأي أحوال يجب أن تكون حتّى يصير فعلها أنفذ وأبلغ. والذي يعرف بهذا الاسم علمان:\n\nأحدهما علم الموسيقي العملية والثاني علم الموسيقي النظرية.\n\nفالموسيقي العملية هي التي شأنها أن توجد أصناف الألحان محسوسة في الآلات التي لها أعدّت إمّا بالطبع وإمّا بالصناعة. والآلة الطبيعية هي الحنجرة واللهاة وما فيها ثمّ الأنف والصناعية مثل المزامير والعيدان وغيرها. والصاحب الموسيقي العملية إنّما يتصوّر النغم والألحان وجميع لواحقها على أنّها في الآلات التي منها تعوّد إيجادها.\n\nWa-ammā ʿilmu l-mūsīqī fa-innahū yaštamilu bi-l-ǧumlati ʿalā taʿarrufi aṣnāfi l-alḥāni wa-ʿalā mā minhu tuʾallafu wa-ʿalā mā lahū ullifat, wa-kayfa tuʾallafu, wa-bi-ayyi aḥwālin yaǧibu an takūna ḥattā yaṣīra fiʿluhā anfaḏa wa-ablaġ. Wa-llaḏī yuʿrafu bi-hāḏa l-ʿilmi ʿilmānī: aḥaduhumā ʿilmu l-mūsīqi l-ʿamaliyyati wa-ṯ-ṯāniyyu ʿilmu l-mūsīqi n-naẓariyya.\n\nFa-l-mūsīqi l-ʿamaliyyati hiya llatī šaʾnuhā an tūǧada aṣnāfu l-alḥāni maḥsūsatun fi l-ālāti llatī lahā uʿiddat immā bi-ṭ-ṭabʿi wa-immā bi-ṣ-ṣināʿa.

What is understood by this designation are two sciences: The first is the science of practical music, the second the science of theoretical music.\n\nPractical music has for its object that which is found in the kinds of melodies which can be perceived on instruments furnished for them either by nature or in an artificial manner. The natural instrument consists of the larynx, the uvula and of what is in it, then: the nose; and the artificial [instruments] are, for example, woodwind instruments, lutes, and others. The practical musician shapes the tones and the melodies and everything that belongs to them only insofar as they are produced by means of the instruments whose use is customary.\n\n(al‑Fārābī, Le recensement des sciences. Al‑Ihsāʾ, ed. Amor Cherni (Paris: Alburaq, 2015), 151, 153; the translation from the Arabic and the following ones are my own.)\n\nHere, al‑Fārābī gives a definition of the science of music, the division into practical and theoretical music, and a further explanation of both of them. First, he establishes the criterion for the identification of practical music, which is strictly related to the locus of sound production: natural and artificial instruments (By “natural instruments” he means those parts of the human body involved in the production of vocal sounds; by ‘artificial’ he means actual musical instruments.) In other words, practical music is limited to the music that can be generated instrumentally.\n\nHe then moves to music theory, which he initially deems to be independent of musical practice:\n\nوالنظرية تعطي علمها وهي معقولة وتعطي أسباب كلّ ما سأتلف من الألحان لا على أنّها في مادّة بل على الإطلاق وعلى أنّها منتزعة عن كلّ آلة وعن كلّ مادّة.\n\nWa-n-naẓariyyatu tuʿṭī ʿilmahā wa-hiya maʿqūlatun wa-tuʿṭī asbāba kulli mā taʾtalifu minhu l-alḥānu lā ʿalā annahā fī māddatin bal ʿala l-iṭlāqi wa-ʿalā annahā muntazaʿatun min kulli ālatin wa-kulli mādda.\n\nTheoretical [music] adds science to [practical music], [science] that is intelligible, and it gives reasons for everything that can be composed of the melodies, not on the basis of their material, but in an absolute [sense], and detached from any instrument and any matter.\n\n(al-Fārābī. Le recensement des sciences, ed. Cherni, 153.)\n\nIn his Great Book on Music, however, music theory and practice seem to entertain a closer relationship:\n\nوفيه يتبيّن ما يوجد من الأشياء التى لُخّصت في كتاب الاسطقسات محسوسًا في الآلات المشهورة وإحصاء ما اعتيد أن يحسّ فيها وما قد يمكن أن يوجد منها في هذه الآلات محسوسًا وإن كانت العادة لم تجرِ به..\n\nWa-fīhi yutabayyanu mā yūǧadu mina l-ašyāʾi llatī luḫḫiṣat fī kitābi l-isṭaqisāti maḥsūsan fi l-ālāti l-mašhūrati wa-iḥṣāʾu ma ʿtīda an yuḥassa fīhā wa-mā qad yumkinu an yūǧada minhā fī hāḏihi l-ālāti maḥsūsan wa-in kānat al-ʿādata lam taǧri bih.\n\nIn [this chapter], the things that are summarized in the book on the elements are clarified [in] a sensually perceptible [way] by means of [the execution] on widespread instruments: the comprehension of what one has become accustomed to perceive on them; what can be found sensually perceptible [by the theory] on these instruments, and – if it was so common – what did not occur on them.\n\n(al‑Fārābī. Kitāb al‑Mūsīqī al‑kabīr, ed. Ḫašaba and al‑Ḥifnī (Cairo 1967), 493)\n\nAl-Fārābī asserts that the music-theoretical foundations he laid in the book on the elements would be better understood through the perception of music. What he does not say, but can nevertheless be deduced implicitly, is that this perception is caused by artificial musical instruments, not by the human voice. The following chapters of his book clarify that theory is easier to demonstrate on artificial instruments because their material conditions, such as the length of the string or the pipe, are easier to represent than those of the human vocal apparatus.\n\nHe then lists in three points what a ‘comprehension by perception’ would involve, namely 1) comprehension of the music [generally played] on the instrument in question, 2) comprehension of what [parts] of the theory can be made perceptible on an instrument independently of its actual use, and 3) comprehension of what is unusual to play on the instrument in question.\n\nEspecially important for my argument is point 2). Here al‑Fārābī moves away from the Pythagorean claim of absoluteness of music, by saying that musical instruments can be used to make theory perceptible, and thus more understandable, independently of the actual use of the instrument.\n\nMoreover, in the chapter on musical instruments, al-Fārābī not only elaborates on how to follow theoretical points on each instrument, but he also tells us about the common musical practices of his time. In this way, he bridges the gap between theory and practice, a connection that gets reinforced in the section of the Great Book on the art of composition, owing to his comprehensive understanding of music.\n\nTo come back to al‑Fārābī’s rejection of the ‘harmony of the spheres,’ we can say that his approach is quite scientific in that while he provides a definition of music abstracted from practice, he turns back to practical music as what makes theory more comprehensible. So the planets cannot sing, but the instruments can! In this sense, his approach is similar to that of Ptolemy, who, while stating that reason is preferable to senses, he concedes that theoretical choices must be verified by perception.[4] However, unlike al‑Fārābī, Ptolemy still relies on the Pythagorean assignments of musical ratios to planetary relationships. Al‑Fārābī’s ideas about music theory and practice will find him a successor in Ibn Sīnā[5] (d. 428/1037).\n\nBibliography\n\nBarker, Andrew. Greek Musical Writings.
