        "text": "On the whole...I think youth culture and music would be much poorer. Random effects off the top of my head...\n\nA number of musicians who died as some result of their lifestyle would still be alive. Darby Crash from the Germs comes readily to mind.\n\nThere would be a weaker vegan/vegetarian movement. Much of PETA and similar organizations derive a significant amount of their membership from the straight edge movement and other punk subsets that encourage animal rights and dietary restrictions.\n\nThere would be a slight, maybe even noticeable increase in drug abuse rates in certain age groups without the existence of Ian Mckaye, Minor Threat, the straight edge movement and its varying degrees of fanaticism, and bands that carried that ideal further than Mckaye ever intended (Earth Crisis, I'm looking in your direction).\n\nTim Armstrong, of Rancid and Operation Ivy fame would be long dead. The only reason he got off of junk and other hard drugs was that Matt Freeman coaxed him into forming Rancid after Operation Ivy broke up to give him something else to do besides enter altered states of consciousness.\n\nFat Mike from NOFX...probably would have eventually straightened out and become a blue collar worker, albeit a somewhat successful one if he applied to business sense he showed with Fat Wreck Chords, his personal label. NOFX has kept him on large amounts of drugs and made him into an increasingly mediocre musician and something of an asshole.\n\nThe idea of anarchy, whether you define it as petty vandalism and cursing off high school teachers, or as complex theorizing, activism and reading Chomsky and AK Press shit would be much less popular among youth, without the influence of Crass, the Subhumans, Conflict and other anarcho-punk and UK 82 punk bands.\n\nAaron Cometbus, of Crimpshrine and Cometbus zine fame, would probably end up some kind of more noticed writer or journalist. He is quite a talented writer and highly intelligent, so perhaps without the involvement in the 924 Gilman Street/ East Bay scene, he ends up doing something mainstream and profitable.\n\nRacists would have less music to reinforce their views without the oi/skinhead subculture. No Skrewdriver, no Condemned 84, no Last Resort, no 4-Skins...that's about the only part of this WI I could live with.\n\nNo bands that aren't really punk but take alot of cues from it. Goodbye Nirvana. So long Smashing Pumpkins. Nice knowing you every godawful pop-skater band from Blink-182 to that thing I forget the name of that I saw on MTV in my friend's basement yesterday but sucked hard.\n\nGlen Danzig would be still be an angry and violent loner, but he would not be a rich angry and violent loner in this ATL, without the revenues from from actually being in the Misfits, doing Danzig and \"Mother\" and getting paid for allowing Jerry Only to do the Misfits, use the name and leave him well alone. Also, a town near where I live, Lodi, would not be famous as the origin of the Misfits.\n\nHenry Rollins would be an abrasive and unpleasant, but observant motivational speaker...much as he is now. Except Black Flag and the Rollins Band would not have ever existed.\n\nIn terms of Bad Religion...Greg Graffin would be a college professor (he is in OTL), but that is all he would be. No Suffer. No Generator. No Epitaph Records. Brett Gurewitz would somehow die from drug addiction, which he would not have broken out of without the motivation of transforming Epitaph Records from the propagator of some of my favorite music from high school and the engine of the Vans Warped Tour into a pseudo-major label that produces music I cannot stand for the most part.\n\nSkateboarding would be much, much less popular without punk. No skate shops. No Vans Warped Tour. No skate-punk bands, be they Suicidal Tendencies, NOFX, Pennywise, the Suicide Machines or whatever kids skate to now that those bands have gotten less popular.\n\nBilly Joe Armstrong and every other member of Green Day would probably some variant of white-trash in the vicinity of San Francisco without Green Day taking them from teenagers in the East Bay scene to massive sellout rock stars who kiss U2's ass and who haven't put out anything worthwhile after Dookie.\n\nIncidentally, we would be spared the Offspring. (Fine, Smash was good. That was it. And it was in 1994.)\n\nSka would be the province of people in Jamaica and never mixed with punk. No Specials. No Selecter. No Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Less Than Jake, etc.\n\nThough he would not have died as he did in OTL, if Sid Vicious has a similar personality, he will still, very likely perish and in the same time frame of his life.\n\nPeople would no hum \"Rock the Casbah\" before getting laid without The Clash.\n\nAnd...if I still exist in this timeline...and I still have the same friends...we would not have been to all those shows, played in those bands, done all those stupid but entertaining things, gotten all those peircings or unnatural hair colorings, had all those injuries...you get the idea.\n\nThis gets my vote for Dystopian TL of the Year Award, by the by.\n\nOn the whole...I think youth culture and music would be much poorer.

Clothing styles would be hugely different with out the emo and glam styles running around for teens"
