        "text": "Canadian punks invigorate\n\nLET’S GO is a Punk Rock band from Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. Formed in 2018, Smile is the follow-up to 2022’s Disposable Year.\n\n(Smile is) a dark lament to the greed that lives in the hearts of men…\n\nfrom album promo\n\nWait, is that a double-bass drum? Certainly sounds like it, and it’s one of the qualities that sets LET’S GO apart from your run-of-the-mill skate-punk outfit. Varying vocalists is unusual for the genre, too, and, happily, they embrace the trend towards a fiery guitar solo. Top that off with a plethora of hooks and gang shouts, and we have a very juicy prospect indeed. They’re certainly tight, as evinced on opener Rectified, a brief blaster with harmonies, gang shouts aplenty, and the first of many scorching solos, while State Of Decay throws a plaintive THE WEAKERTHANS vocal into the mix. There are some genuine stone-cold classics too: über-anthem Overboard‘s BAD RELIGION beginnings give way to unexpected vocal interjections, gang back-ups and a weird, metally rock bridge, while the ragged bounce of Our Song is surely an instant, singalong gig hit. The utterly addictive Never Gonna Die barrels into the number one slot, a mid-paced anthem with an energised chorus and multiple vocalists, and Salted Snow and Smile both tip a wink to PROPAGANDHI, though LET’S GO lean heavier on the anthemic atmospheres. Pixels hits differently with a gentle slacker intro, building to a riffy punk song before things get serious on the SHRUG DEALER-esque Goon Tune, featuring some neat metal guitar licks and peculiar phrasing.\n\ninstated by the lower class\n\nwho’s compass has been bent\n\ncapitalist policies protect the one percent\n\ntwisted by their hate, misled to vote against themselves\n\ndiggin’ our own graves, fuck off we’ll see you all in hell\n\nwhy must we kill what we don’t understand\n\nwe’re bleeding through\n\nyou’re poisoning the well\n\nfuck you we’ll see you all in hell\n\nfuck you so see you all in hell\n\nGoon Tune\n\nAt once angry, defiant, uplifting and invigorating, LET’S GO take elements of PROPAGANDHI, THE BOUNCING SOULS, and a little rough ‘n ready OFF WITH THEIR HEADS, adding enough of their own oddly compelling shit to turn out something truly head-turning. The genre continues to surprise.\n\nReleased November 24th 2023 on High End Denim Records"
