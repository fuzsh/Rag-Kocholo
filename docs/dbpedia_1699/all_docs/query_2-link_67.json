        "text": "Note: this is an archived copy of Paul Routenburg's excellent Killed By Hype site which was previously located at http://plaza.powersurfr.com/paul/punk.html and http://ca.geocities.com/kbd77@rogers.com/punk.html. It contains a lot of great information about punk records so I decided to keep it alive here after the demise of GeoCities.\n\nPunk Rock Canada\n\nSince the appearance in 1993 of a discography called Smash The State written by Frank Manley, Canadian punk has become more widely known, harder to find, and generally expensive when you do find it. There are a lot of good Canadian records but in many cases the hype has taken over. Get the 3 Smash The State LPs and you'll have a lot of the more over-rated (and overpriced) Canadian 7\"s in their entirety. Killed By Death #26 also focuses solely on Canadian records, some good, some not so good.\n\nRecords worth finding that aren't on the Smash The State LPs include The Action, Active Dog, Cardboard Brains 1st EP, Da Slyme (the double LP as well as the CD), Demics 12\", the 1st Diodes LP, Discords, Dishrags (particularly their 2nd but just go buy the CD), some early D.O.A., Forgotten Rebels 12\" and In Love With The System LP (if you're one of those obnoxious politically correct punks you might want to avoid them however), Genetic Control, K-Tels, No Exit LP, Platinum Blonde (the only release of theirs worth bothering with - after this one they signed to a major label and became more concerned with their hair than their music), Riot 303, Rude Norton, Shriek, 63 Monroe 1st 12\", Slander LP (an under-appreciated record), Slow, all Subhumans releases, Swindled (Henry says this one is essential. It is a very good record.), Ugly (the 7\" is weak but the CD rocks), Viletones 7\"s (though the LP is weak), the 1st 2 Teenage Head LPs (on the first get the original version, the remixed one sucks which unfortunately is what is on the CD), and the Vancouver Complication LP.\n\nFor pop-punk fans the Allies, Curtains, Extroverts, Modern Minds (which features Moe Berg before he went on to bigger but not always better things), Pointed Sticks (just get the CD, it has all the 7\"s tracks and a few from the LP but the LP is kind of weak anyway), Sinners, 222 and Wayouts are worthwhile. For good spazz art-punk the first Braineaters EP (recently reissued) is a keeper. In the \"weird but weird in a good kind of way\" category there's Jolly Tambourine Man. There is even a video to one of the songs which appears rarely on the Canadian equivalent of MTV.\n\nOne good thing about the popularity of Canadian punk is the number of CD issues with a lot of previously unreleased material from the Pointed Sticks, Young Canadians, Modernettes, Curse, Dishrags, B Girls (not punk but fun 50s - 60s style bubblegum pop), Demics, Forgotten Rebels, Mods, Ugly, Viletones and the Secrets. The Secrets??!! What the hell were they thinking? Even if the band does include members from the Viletones and Diodes, the Secrets fucking suck!\n\nI haven't been particularly impressed by most newer Canadian bands but the Real McKenzies from Vancouver were a fun band, especially live. The best release to get is the cassette, the CDs are good but don't quite have the punch of the cassette. Even that doesn't come close to the energy of their live shows. For the \"street punk\" crowd the Glory Stompers and Systematics, both from Edmonton, are worth a listen.\n\nThere are a number of newer Canadian releases listed here though many of them aren't particularly good. For a while I tended to pick up just about any release that looked punk or seemed interesting (trying to support homegrown talent, I guess). I eventually got tired of accumulating a bunch of mostly crap, so I just taped the best of the lot and got rid of them. If you're interested in more about the current Canadian punk scene then you might want to check this out.\n\nAction\n\n12\" EP [TV's On The Blink / Downtown Bus / Waiting For The Man / Do The Strangle] (Montreco, 1978)\n\nTV's On The Blink / Do The Strangle [on Killed By Death #26 LP]\n\nVery good rockin' punk from Ottawa.\n\nRating: 8\n\nActionauts\n\nVagabond / Hash Assassin 7\" (Zulu, 1983)\n\nParty Dog [on Last Call 2CD, Canada, 1988]\n\nOK powerpop. The Last Call track is better than both 7\" tracks.\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nActive Dog\n\nRat Race / Good Filthy Fun 7\" (Active Dog Productions, 1979)\n\nGood Filthy Fun [on Killed By Death #17 LP]\n\nNothing Holding You / Fun While It Lasts [on Vancouver Complication LP, Canada, 1979]\n\nNothing Holding You [on Last Call 2CD, Canada, 1988]\n\nAll songs are very good (though over-rated by collectors) punk-pop. Band included future Pointed Sticks and Modernette.\n\nRating: 8\n\nActive Glands\n\ndemo recordings [She's A Tease / I'll Be Me / Clifford Robert Olson / Surgery / Dive / Hooray For The U.S.A. / Do Something / ? / Heavy Metal Freak / Royalty] (c1983)\n\nVery good melodic punk-hardcore. From Vancouver. Surgery is a great song. Too bad this was never released on vinyl.\n\nRating: 7.5\n\nAircuts\n\nRadioactivity / Sheila 7\" (Barnet, 1980)\n\nThe A side is cute quirky pop/new wave. The B side is pop and not very interesting. From Vancouver.\n\nRating: 6\n\nAKA\n\nRed Therapy 12\" EP [God / City Drugs / 634 Dog / Ragged Andy's / Fear / Mental Timebombs] (Seouldog, 1980)\n\n634 Dog [on Last Call 2CD, Canada, 1988]\n\nSomewhat of a spastic jazz-no wave mixture. The International Discography of the New Wave also lists the 2 tracks on the Who Cares? LP (USA, 1981) by AKA as being by this band. They're not.\n\nRating: 6\n\nA.K.O.B.\n\nAnother Kind Of Blues EP [Explosion Blues / Diddling With One's Own Thing Blues / What's Going On Blues / Officer Friendly Blues / Plastic People Blues] (Undergrowth, 1985)\n\nFairly mundane medium speed hardcore with some sort of blues twist to it.\n\nRating: 5\n\nAllies\n\nNight In The City / Talkin' About My Girl 7\" (End, c1980) [no ps]\n\nNight In The City [on Smash The State - Volume 3 LP, Canada, 1999]\n\nThe A side is a good punk/powerpop mix. The B side is tamer with interesting lyrics. From Toronto.\n\nRating: 7\n\nArson\n\nLivin' With The White Folks / Coho? Coho! 7\" (Motor, 1979)\n\nPretty Girls [on Smash The State - Volume 1 LP, Canada, 1994]\n\nWe've Got To Get Out Of This Place [on No Pedestrians LP, Canada, 1980]\n\nQuite good punk, especially the B side. Both songs along with a bonus track are available on the Smash The State - Volume 1 LP so no need to pay $100+ for the 7\". The Animals cover on the No Pedestrians compilation LP is rather mediocre.\n\nRating: 8\n\nArtificial Life\n\nEP [Death Dive / Fateful Day / Right To Live, Right To Die / Generic Jailer / (unlisted)] (own label, 1988)\n\nAverage hardcore punk from Winnipeg.\n\nRating: 6\n\nAsexuals\n\nFeaturing ... EP [New World / B.F.D. / Where's The Bus / Wake Up] (OG, 1984)\n\nBe What You Want LP [Be What You Want / Contra Rebel / Trash Zone / Mind Contraction / 3 Chord Speed / C.F.R. / We Seek No Glory / Too Slow / Asexual / Mr. Useless / Ego Trip / Iraq, Iran / Mr. Rat / Weekend Alky] (First Strike/Psyche-Industry, 1984)\n\nContemporary World LP [Where Were You / Take A Look Around You / Contemporary World / Circus / Up Close / Social Education / Stop The City / Death From Above / So Alone / The Times They Are A Changin'] (Psyche-Industry, 1985)\n\nLove Goes Plaid / Beautiful 7\" (RPN, 1992]\n\nlive [? / Something Else /Wake Up] (Kingston, Ontario, 1984)\n\nThe 1st EP is basic hardcore except for Wake Up which is more traditional punk. The 1st LP is a similar hardcore and punk mix while the second LP is more melodic punk. Their later releases (at least 2 LPs, Dish and Exile From Floontown) are more pop with some punk and not especially memorable.\n\nRating: 6.5 [EP and 1st 2 LPs]\n\nAuthority Fails\n\nWe Wanna Be Heard EP [Hear Our Voices / Vu d'en bas / Riot On / Music Is Stronger Than Love] (En Guard, 1992)\n\nMediocre hardcore punk. Riot On is a reasonable song, the others are disposable.\n\nRating: 5\n\nAV\n\nEP [Dying In Brooklyn / Cliche / Little Old Man / All Sane] (Quintessence, 1978)\n\n1/4 To 8 [on Vancouver Complication LP, Canada, 1979]\n\nAll songs are some mix of artpunk and pop. This is the first release on the Quintessence (later Zulu) label, one of the big indie labels in the Vancouver scene. There were various line-ups, two members of the band that recorded the Vancouver Complication track went on to the Pointed Sticks.\n\nRating: 6 [7.5 for the compilation track]\n\nB Girls\n\nFun At The Beach / 'B' Side 7\" (Bomp, 1979)\n\nWho Says Girls Can't Rock CD ['B' Side / Hearts In His Eyes / Heartbreaker / Alibi / Who Says Girls Can't Rock / Boys Are Drinking / Two Hearts / Alibi / Jealousy / Fun At The Beach / Two Hearts / Angel Doesn't Shoot A Gun / Mystery / Alibi / Big Girl / Savage Fever / Chinese Rocks / Long Distance Love / Fun At The Beach] (Other People's Music, 1997)\n\nRecorded between 1977 - 1981. Band formed in a washroom after a Thin Lizzy concert. Not punk, and I'm not sure they really \"rock\" but they do some good 50's and 60's style fun pop a la the Shangri-Las. The 7\" tracks are included (in remixed form) on the CD. The rest are previously unreleased (or were they released on an LP?), some are live. I've seen mention of an LP released on Bomp - anyone know if this exists?\n\nRating: 7.5 [if their style is your kind of thing]\n\nB-Sides\n\nEP [Bedtime For Ronald / Underground Radio Stars / She's A Raver] (RadioActive, 1981)\n\nInvasion Of The Money Snatchers / Much Too Serious 7\" (RadioActive, 1981)\n\nRed To Black LP [She's A Raver / Red To Black / Run And Hide / No Can Do / State Of Emergency / Bedtime For Ronald / Regular Guy / b-side Shuffle / Emotions / Late At Night] (RadioActive, c1981)\n\nSpy vs. Spy / Underground Radio Stars [on Vancouver Independence LP, Canada, 1980]\n\nPop-ska. Spy vs. Spy is a good instrumental track, She's A Raver and Underground Radio Stars are probably their other better tracks. Otherwise nothing to get too excited about.\n\nRating: 6\n\nBad Luck No. 13\n\nLes Enfants Terribles EP [Ex-Teenage Rebel / T.O. Boys / The Power & The Glory / I'm] (NIM, 1993)\n\nOne of the few 90's Canadian bands I don't mind. Better than average typical punk rock.\n\nRating: 7\n\nBAMFF\n\nThe Uncanny / Mini Crisis 7\" (own label, 1983)\n\nExperimental artsy fartsy stuff.\n\nRating: 4\n\nBangkok\n\nEve Of Destruction / Planet Of My Own 7\" (Thai Fi, 1981)\n\nThe only thing worth noting about this is that the band included Mickey Skin of the Curse. The A side is a Barry McGuire cover, which is barely tolerable. The other song plain stinks.\n\nRating: 3\n\n(Battered) Wives\n\nUganda Stomp / Giddy 7\" (Bomb, 1979)\n\nSex & Drugs & Rock'n'Roll / Pass Out 7\" (Bomb/Epic, 1979)\n\ns/t LP [Daredevil / I Want It All / Get What I Can / Uganda Stomp / Suicide / Angry Young Man / You Better Be Right / Lovers Balls / Everybody Loves A Loser / Freedom Fighters] (Bomb, 1979)\n\nUganda Stomp is a slightly amusing take on the state of affairs in Idi Amin's Uganda. The B side of the 1st 7\" is probably their best punk song. The second 7\" (which came only in copies of the Cigarettes LP (their 2nd, not listed since I didn't think it was worth keeping)) is pretty good, including the Ian Dury cover. Most of the s/t LP isn't that good, maybe the 1st side is good for a listen every 6 months or so. Due to protests from womens' groups they shortened their name to just The Wives. The 1st LP comes on red (most common), black and clear vinyl. There's also a live LP (Live On Mother's Day).\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nBeach Mutants\n\nPolka Dot Pyjamas EP [You Have To Be The Best / I Need Dope / Rambo / My Masturbation] (Snippy Guy, 1986)\n\nRather mediocre hardcore punk. I Need Dope is acceptable, My Masturbation is an idiotic take on a Who song, the rest is pretty forgettable.\n\nRating: 4\n\nBenzene Jag\n\nFuck Off 1984 / Love Recession 7\" (Star, 1983?)\n\nA side is anthemic, sort of punk rock. Nothing special. The other song is pretty much crap.\n\nRating: 3\n\nArt Bergmann\n\nCrawl With Me LP [My Empty House / Our Little Secret / (We Want) The Most Wanted / Man In Town / Don't Be Late / Runaway Train / Final Cliche / Crawl With Me / The Junkie Don't Care / Ill Repute / Inside Your Love / Charity] (Duke Street, 1988)\n\nSexual Roulette LP [Bound For Vegas / Sexual Roulette / Bar Of Pain / The Hospital Song / Sleep / Dirge No. 1 / Swamp Food Thing / Gambol / (She) Hit Me / More Blue Shock / Deathwatch] (Duke Street, 1990)\n\nWhat Fresh Hell Is This? CD [Beatles In Hollywood / Another Train Song / In Betweens / Buried Alive / Guns & Heroin / Some Fresh Hell / Contract / Jones / Demolished / Nearer My God To Thee / Dive / Stop The Time] (Sony, 1995)\n\nThese solo records came after stints in a number of Vancouver bands, starting with the Schmorgs in 1976. Then came the K-Tels (renamed the Young Canadians), Los Popularos and Poisoned. Both LPs feature some excellent songs (rock, not punk). There is a s/t 3rd solo LP from 1991 which I heard once and don't really remember at all. The comeback release in 1995, while not up to the 1st 2 releases, has some OK rockin' tunes. It is truly unfortunate that talent such as Art's remains in relative obscurity compared to pustules such as Bryan Adams. In 1991 he made a cameo appearance in the Bruce MacDonald film, Highway 61.\n\nRating: 8 (1st 2 LPs), 6 for the CD\n\nBeyond Possession\n\nTell Tale Heart EP [Tell Tale Heart / What's The Matter / Skater's Life / No Religion / Vengeance / (Dying Fast)] (Fango/Rooter, 1985)\n\nSlightly above average (though I'm not a fan of the genre) skate-core. There are 2 versions of the EP, one with 5 songs, one with 6. There is also an LP from 1986, called Is Beyond Possession, which is considerably more metal sounding than the EP. There is also a CD that was released about 1996 with (I think) the EP, LP and comp tracks.\n\nRating: 6.5 [for the EP]\n\nBig Black Puppets\n\nFalse Hopes [on split 7\" with Wasted Lives] (Spoken, 1979)\n\nFalse Hopes [on Smash The State - Volume 2 LP, Canada, 1995]\n\nDecent punk. You can find it on the Smash The State - Volume 2 LP. Includes a to be Modernette and a couple future Pointed Sticks.\n\nRating: 7\n\nBill Of Rights\n\nEP [No Rights, No Chance / Decide / Drunk Government] (No Rights, 1984)\n\nMeltdown 85 EP [The Core / Blind Society / C-9 / What Do You Say / A Shot In The Ass / Conquest For Wilbur] (No Rights, 1985)\n\nNot too exciting slightly melodic punkcore.\n\nRating: 5.5\n\nBitter Reality\n\nDemo recordings [no titles] (c1982)\n\nA White Man (In Babylon) / Tellin' Me Goodbye 7\" (Alarm, 1983)\n\nPunk name ... Punk sleeve ... Punk music? Not! Quite dull. The demo recordings are somewhat better, don't know what happened on the 7\".\n\nRating: 3.5, maybe 6 for the demos\n\nBlack Boot Trio\n\nEverything Is Gonna Be All Right ... CS [Everything Is Gonna Be All Right / Don't Say Yes / Love Is A Splendid Thing / I Don't Love You Anymore / Almost Living In Los Angeles / Drinking Too Much / Fit For A King (Booze & Pills) / Bus Song / Many Young Men Consider Themselves Cowboys / My Boots Are Black] (own label, 1992)\n\nCountry cow-punk. Sometimes amusing lyrics, not wildly talented, but a fun band. From Ottawa. Not much else, musically or otherwise, has come from there recently. They have other cassette and CD releases as well.\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nBlank Generation\n\ndemo recordings [no titles] (1980)\n\nThe Last Generation 12\" EP [Reaction / World Situation 80s / Last Generation / J.W.G. / Anguish / Shoot To Kill / Dew Line] (Gus Whitney, 1981)\n\nDecent punk, though the keyboards get annoying at times. Their demo recordings (some are versions of 12\" tracks) are generally better than the ones on the 12\". For some reason they have more kick and the keyboards are less obnoxious.\n\nRating: 6, 7.5 for the demos\n\nBlanky\n\nEP [Apple of My Eye / Happy Tree / Hollow / Camino] (Green Pepper, 1994)\n\nA mix of pop, punk, jazz, noise and probably everything else.\n\nRating: 5.5\n\nBliss\n\nEP [Baby I'm Yours / Green Shine / Dear Friend / Black Red] (Patois, 1991)\n\nFairly heavy jazzgrungecore (or something). Not great, not awful. From Montreal. At least one other release as well, and there's at least one other band of the same name.\n\nRating: 5\n\nBlue Peter\n\nTest Patterns For Living 12\" EP [Same Old Place / Out With The Boys / Living In The Eighties / Time & Money / Do The Robot / Cloak & Dagger / Factory Living] (Ready, 1979)\n\nRadio Silence [from 7\"] (1980)\n\nLiving In The 80's [on Powerpearls Vol. 5 LP, Germany, 1999]\n\nThe 12\" EP is good punky new wave. Following that they became pretty much just bad pop/new wave.\n\nRating: 7 [for the 12\"]\n\nBonus Boys\n\nEvery Time I See A Car Like Yours Go By / Wasting Our Time 7\" (Tsunami, 1979)\n\nI Want To Work In A Bank / Confusing Ourselves 7\" (Tsunami, 1980)\n\nMundane pop-rock from Vancouver.\n\nRating: 5\n\nBop Cats\n\nEP [Kiss Good-Bye / Cool Off Baby / Train Kept A Rollin'] (Attic, 1981)\n\nRockabilly. 2 tracks are live, John Catto of the Diodes plays on one of them which is why it is listed here. They also released other 7\"s and at least one LP.\n\nRating: 6\n\nBraineaters\n\nEP [Braineater / Funtime / Last Date / Rock Rock / Edge] (Wrong World, 1979) (reissue, Super Electro, 1996)\n\nPlanet X 10\" flexi [Modern Man / Kid Stuff / Closet Case / Screw You / London Town / Wrong World / Johnny] (no label, 1980)\n\nHyde Park / School Girl 7\" (no label, 1981)\n\nThe 7\" EP is really good punk/artpunk. Includes Buck Cherry (Modernettes) and \"Art Bormann\" (K-Tels/Young Canadians). It was reissued in 1996, even keeping the 8.5 x 11\" format sleeve. The 10\" flexi, while not as wild as the EP is still worthwhile. All the sleeves were individually designed and hand painted and can be quite attractive. The 7\" single (which sometimes came with a huge foldout poster) is mostly slow droning electronics and effects. The name later changed to I, Braineater with essentially one man (Jim Cummins) doing it all.\n\nRating: 9 (the EP), 7 (the flexi) and 5 (the 7\")\n\nBrontocrushrock\n\nA Titanic Mistake / I Don't Want You / Organizations of Power / Page Three / Iguana [Next Five Songs EP] (Irate Faction, 1989)\n\nPassable melodic punkcore.\n\nRating: 5.5\n\nBrand New Unit (BNU)\n\nEP [Summertime / Deep Inside / City] (3 Minute Mile, 1992)\n\nBetter than average 90's punkcore. There are other releases as well.\n\nRating: 6\n\nBubai Skull\n\nInsex EP [Eelmonkey / Diamondback / Gun Shy / Wickerman] (Cinnamon Toast, 1992)\n\nGood hard rockin' band. Not punk but still good.\n\nRating: 7\n\nBum\n\nDebbiespeak / Bullet 7\" (Lance Rock, 1992)\n\nGo Crazy 7\" [Your Disciple / Weekend] (Au Go Go, 1992]\n\nAt The Well / Pool Hall Richard 7\" (Lucky, 1992)\n\nMrs. Rock & Roll / I Won't Look Back 7\" (One Louder, 1994)\n\nLift Up Your Hood [split EP (Tattoo Dave) with The Smugglers] (Top Drawer, 1994)\n\nA Promise Is A Promise / Don't Come Close To Me [from split 2x7\" with Teengenerate] (Lance Rock, 1994)\n\nWanna Smash Sensation LP [Debbiespeak / Your Disciple / When She Walked / The Eternal Ideal / Wedding Day / Bent On Being Bent / I Hardly Breathe / Mallory / Instant Kool Ayd / At The Well / A Promise Is A Promise / I'm Not One / No Idea...] (Popllama/Munster/1+2, 1993)\n\nI Am Superwoman CD [Your Name Was Next To Mine / I Wanna Be / Weekend / Bent On Being Bent / 1983 / Got Yourself Together / Don't Come Close To Me / Your Disciple / Oh No / My Pal] (Au Go Go, 1994)\n\nFor the most part the 7\" tracks and the 1st LP kick some serious bum. Very good rockin' punk including Misfits (Bullet) and Dictators (Weekend) covers. The split EP with The Smugglers features a DMZ cover and a joint effort with the Smugglers, a Stones cover (Hang Fire). The CD is a mix of material from 1992 - 1994 and just doesn't grab me the way the 7\"s and 1st LP did. Some tracks (those already known from previous releases) are fine, others are somewhat weak. I think there was at least one subsequent release which I didn't bother with since the mixed results of the CD made me lose interest. I never did get their 1st 7\" (Promise Is A Promise / Wedding Day) from 1991 but since those tracks are on the 1st LP I long since stopped caring about it.\n\nRating: 8 (everything except the CD which is a 6)\n\nBunchofuckingoofs\n\nNo Problem, So There's No Solution 2x7\" EP [Alcoholiday Turned Alcoholocaust / Too Bad // Creating Criminals To Create Employment / Exploding Gluebags /// Religion Made By Hypocrites // Putting Us Down / Preprogrammed (This One's For You) / Total Breakdown] (Back Alley, 1986)\n\nRough hardcore punk. They've been around the Toronto scene for years and have other releases after this.\n\nRating: 6\n\nBureaucrats\n\nFeel The Pain / Grown Up Age 7\" (VIP, 1980)\n\nFeel The Pain / Grown Up Age [on Smash The State - Volume 3 LP, Canada, 1999)\n\nGrown Up Age [on Break The Rules #9 LP, Germany, 1999]\n\nFeel The Pain [on Powerpearls Vol. 1 LP, Germany, 1999]\n\nToday & Everyday [on Rot 'n' Role LP, Canada, 1979]\n\n2 really good tracks on the 7\" and another one on the compilation LP. Half of the 7\"s were issued sleeveless though someone did (much) later do a 2 piece reproduction on heavy paper stock. Original sleeves are slightly oversized, glossy white paper with black printing, glued on 3 sides. 500 such sleeves, apparently, not 200 as some people might want you to believe. And there was only one sleeve design, not 2 as has been rumoured.\n\nRating: 8.5\n\nCads\n\nEP [Do The Crabwalk / Born Yesterday / Over My Dead Body / Sex Was The Only Way Out] (Bi-R, 1978)\n\nDo The Crabwalk [on Killed By Death #20 LP]\n\nDecent punk-pop, sort of like the Diodes but not as good.\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nCannibal\n\nTryin' / Wasted Lives 7\" (no label, 1985)\n\nNot sure if these guys were from Vancouver or maybe Seattle? Tryin' is sort of punk with a hard rock feel. The B side (Wasted Lives) reminds me of a bad Motorhead song.\n\nRating: 4\n\nCardboard Brains\n\nEP [I Want To Be A Yank / Can Stress Kill? / Stepping Stone / Living Inside My Head] (Brainco, 1977) [untitled, often known as the White EP]\n\n12\" EP [Caesar Drives A Fast Car / Out, Out, Out / And So I Hide / The Rescue Crew] (Brainco, 1979) [untitled, often known as the Black EP]\n\nLive At The Edge LP [And So I Hide / Have You Seen The Boy In The Gutter With The Broken Mind? / Is That Why? / Summertime! / The Monster In Ed / Babies Run My World / Jungles / Caesar Drives A Fast Car / Ermie Has Feelers] (Canadian Music Development Corporation, 1982) [recorded live April 26, 1981]\n\nBabies Run My World / Jungles [on Last Pogo LP, live, 1978]\n\nStepping Stone [on Killed By Death #26 LP]\n\nJohn Paul Young and Cardboard Brains CD (Meg Entertainment, 1998) [Caesar Drives A Fast Car / Out, Out, Out / And So I Hide / The Rescue Crew / Babies Run My World (live) / Jungles (live) / Stepping Stone / Can Stress Kill? / I Wanna Be A Yank / Living Inside My Head / Ermie Has Feelers / Have You Seen ... / Our Time Escapes / Is That Why? / Summertime! / The Monster In Ed / The Girl Spells Grief / Angels With Dirty Faces / The Boulevards of Hope / Worlds Within A Dream / Have You Seen ... (live) / Ermie (live) / Surrender To The Void]\n\nSometimes billed as John Paul Young and The Cardboard Brains. The first EP is an excellent punk record. The 12\" EP and live LP are much more art/new wave than punk with considerable use of synthesizers. While they are not bad records they are dismissed by most punk purists. John Paul Young also did a solo LP (The Life of Ermie Scub) in 1980 which includes several tracks which appear on the live LP. The CD contains remixed versions of the 7\" and 12\" EPs as well as a selection of other tracks. Go here if you're interested in getting a copy.\n\nRating: 9 for the 7\" EP, 7 for the other records\n\nCelebrity Drunks\n\nHolly Jolly [from 7\"] (Amok, 1988)\n\nSome obscure indie thing, at the time I happened to think this song was pretty good funky punk.\n\nRating: 6\n\nCeramic Hello\n\nClimatic Nouveau / Theatre Matrix 7\" (Mannequin, 1981)\n\n2 man synth art/pseudo-industrial junk. There is also an LP.\n\nRating: 5\n\nChicken Milk\n\nEP [You Get Nothing / Outside My Window / Sink] (Fans of Bad Productions, 1993)\n\nFleece [from This Ain't The Hot Fudge Show EP] (Fans of Bad Productions, 1992)\n\nFemale punk.

The insert for the Come Out Come Out CD even has a remake of the D.O.A. Hardcore 81 LP cover ... Cuddlecore 94. They have other releases after this but I lost interest.

Mostly OK. Their side of the split 7\" with The Diodes isn't music, it's vocalist Mickey Skin offering her opinion on a monologue by a pretentious art theorist that is heard in the background. She basically suggests where he can put his theories. The 7\" tracks both appear on the Killed By Death #26 LP and the CD.

Great mix of punk, almost hardcore, and general goofing around. You'll even find some Beefheart influence and some country stylings mixed in. The LPs come in another group's LP jacket with the band name spray-painted on it. Side A was recorded in a studio in 1978, side B in 1979. Sides 3 and 4 are live recordings from 1979. The CD is a complete show from 1984 though a lot of the material was written several years earlier. The playing may be more proficient but the punk spirit is definitely still there.

The first LP is a very good punk rock record. Most of the first LP was included on the second LP (3 tracks were left off, 2 of them are on the CD). The second LP also has some worthwhile tracks. After this they became more thrashy, metallic and I lost interest. They are still going, in some version at least. Their less than subtle lyrics landed them in court in the late 1980's on obscenity charges. Hey, look at us, we're (trying to be) shocking. Yawn. The cover of the first LP was used as the cover for Break The Rules #8. Some copies of the Toxic Shock pressing of the second LP come on orange vinyl.

The 12\" is top notch punk rock. The LP is tamer, though the songs are still good. Many of them appear on the CD in live versions. The CD consists of the 12\" tracks, 3 1978 studio recordings and live sessions from 1978 and 1979. There are also 2 7\"s which are just tracks from the LP and don't have picture sleeves. Of interest only for nerdy collectors.\n\nRating: 8.5 (the 12\"), 8 (the CD) and 7 (the LP)\n\nDesperate Minds\n\nHype / Do Your Part / 555 Prey TV [from A Chance To Feel Emotions Alive EP] (Chikara, 1986)\n\nLast Night I Had The Strangest Dream LP [Brothers & Sisters / Nobody Knows / Stuck On 45 / Miami / Writing On The Wall / Corpus Christi // I'm Not Such A Sweet Thing / ...and I Cried / Maybe I'm Just Naive / Strive For More] (Chikara, 1988)\n\nLike most of the Chikara label releases this is hardcore with a rock edge to it.

The 3rd one is very lame in comparison. The Survivors LP is a collection of material dating from 1977-81 is mostly OK. There were a number of 7\"s issued, some promos, all with LP tracks, and only the Red Rubber Ball / We're Ripped one had a picture sleeve.

The second CD is post-1983 and with the exception of I, Braineater, NoMeansNo, and Slow it is mostly decent indie rock. However, the first disc and booklet alone make this worth getting.) Rating: 8 (1st CD), 6 (2nd CD).

Mostly the originals are better than the cover versions. The crummy sound of the LP doesn't help either. The Von Zippers, Mants, Forbidden Dimension, Mudhoney, Teenage Kicks and Puritans are the best of the lot. Cub and Junior Varsity particularly suck. An interesting concept but I prefer the original versions.)

Asexuals/Change of Heart split EP (1990) Change of Heart are total garbage. Brian's Children Cut Her Hair/Oh Yeah 7\" (1979) Fuckin' hippie shit. Anyone who calls this punk and charges more than $1 for it hasn't a clue what punk is. Anyone who pays more than 50 cents for it is a clueless moron who deserves to be parted from their money. Capitalist Alienation s/t 12\" (1987) Crusty hardcore crap. Crisis of Faith split EP with Chokehold (1991) Thrashcore. The American Dream ... LP (1991) More of the same, or is it just the same song played over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Chokehold EP (1992) see Crisis Of Faith. Corpusse Delusions LP (1988) Synthesizer death drone. Death Of Gods A World Of One, Divided By All EP (1988) Generic HC. Direct Action Trapped In A World LP (1984) Damn-Age LP (1988) Both are basic boring hardcore."
