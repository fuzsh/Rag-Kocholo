        "text": "This page is about the UK punk rock band. For information about their Canadian namesakes see The Subhumans (Canadian band).\n\nThe Subhumans are an anarcho-punk band formed in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, UK in 1979 by Dick Lucas, who had formerly been in local bands including The Mental and Stupid Humans.\n\nThe band released a demo in 1981 which was heard by members of the band Flux of Pink Indians, who were so impressed that they offered the Subhumans a chance to put out a record on their newly formed Spiderleg label. Shortly afterwards the Subhumans began to release material on their own Bluurg Records label.\n\nAfter the Subhumans split up Lucas formed the bands Culture Shock and Citizen Fish. The Subhumans occasionally reform for live performances, including at least two major tours of North America in the 21st Century, (Live in a Dive is a product of the first) and they continue to command a strong cult following.\n\nDiscography\n\n\"Demolition War\" (EP, Spiderleg Records 1981)\n\n\"Reasons for Existence\" (EP, Spiderleg Records 1982)\n\n\"Religious Wars\" (EP, Spiderleg Records 1982)\n\nThe Day the Country Died (LP, Spiderleg Records 1983)\n\n\"Evolution\" (EP, Bluurg Records 1983)\n\n\"Time Flies But Aeroplanes Crash\" (12\" EP, Bluurg Records 1983)\n\nFrom the Cradle to the Grave (LP, Bluurg Records 1984)\n\n\"Rats\" (EP, Bluurg Records 1984)\n\nWorlds Apart (LP, Bluurg Records 1985)\n\nEP-LP (LP, re-issue of first 4 EPS 1985)\n\n29:29 Split Vision (LP, Bluurg Records 1986)\n\nTime Flies + Rats (LP, \"Rats\" and \"Time Flies\" EPs re-issued together, Bluurg Records 1990)\n\nUnfinished Business (CD, unreleased old tracks, recently recorded, 2000)\n\nLive in a Dive (CD/LP, Fat Wreck Chords 2004)\n\nSee also\n\nPunk ideology\n\nExternal link\n\nOfficial website for Subhumans and Citizen Fish (http://www.citizenfish.com/)\n\nTabs for Subhumans at Tablature Wiki (http://tablature.wikicities.com/wiki/Category:Subhumans)de:Subhumans_(England)"
