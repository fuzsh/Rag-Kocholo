        "text": "It’s no secret that I get nerdy about punk rock history, Canadian punk rock history in particular. It makes what Supreme Echo is doing all the more exciting for me. Arguably, the most famous Canadian punk rock song is “Fuck You.” The song has been a long-time staple in DOA’s set list, but it first appeared on The Subhumans’ self-titled 12” EP. The truth of the matter is that it wasn’t The Subhumans song originally, either. It belonged to The Stiffs. In fact, this single was all set to become the first Vancouver punk put to vinyl in 1978, but before it could be released Gerry and Mike broke up the band to start The Subhumans with Wimpy and Dimwit, taking some songs with them. The record contains the studio tracks for the original release, a demo recording of another song, and a practice recording from Chuck Biscuit’s house for a grand total of seven songs. Of course, the studio tracks sound better than the practice recordings, but I find it amazing how a basement tape from 1978 can sound as good as it does. The Subhumans may very well be my favorite band of all time, and I was shocked to learn that another one of their classic songs, “Oh Canaduh,” was also originally a Stiffs song. I had no idea! Another quality punk rock history lesson from Supreme Echo. I consider this required listening. –Ty Stranglehold (Supreme Echo, supremeecho.band"
