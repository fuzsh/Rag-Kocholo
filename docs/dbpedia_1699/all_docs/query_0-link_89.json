He’s a social outlaw and a political radical, a mountain man, a goldminer, a father and a Canadiana folk music hero. Mostly he just wants to kick ass when showtime arrives using his unique cross-over of Waylon style outlaw-country pickin and down home Stompin Tom attitude towards all things Canadiana.\n\nHe can play you hours of songs about life in the north, including many of the Canadiana Classics. He’s released 5 recordings including the album Transgression Trail which topped the Canadian College and Independent radio charts in 2010, the same album with the song Greyhoundin Guitar Man which CBC Radio 3 voted one of the most Canadian songs of the year.
