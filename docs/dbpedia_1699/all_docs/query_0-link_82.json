        "text": "UK-based crust legends DISCHARGE played their final Canadian show last night at the Rickshaw Theater in Vancouver, British Columbia. Singer JJ announced yesterday that himself and lead guitarist Bones had been detained upon entering the country – whereby JJ was advised that he was permanently banned from entering Canada. JJ posted this statement on Facebook last night:\n\n“Well… I’m permanently banned from Canada. Criminal charges from 20 years ago. However they let me in to play the show for a “low” cost of $200 as long as I leave the country after we play. Bones made it in by the skin of his teeth…Tezz / Rainy not allowed back in the USA. Karl Morris ‘Egghead’ from The Exploited, UK Subs etc. will be filling in on bass for us. Doesn’t look like Discharge will ever be allowed back in Canada… so looks like tonight will be our last Canadian show. All USA shows still on… see ya soon!”\n\nThe show in Vancouver was the first date of the band’s highly anticipated North American tour – the remaining US dates are going ahead as planned starting in Seattle, Washington State today. Support will be coming from EYEHATEGOD and TOXIC HOLOCAUST.\n\nGuitarist Tezz and bassist Rainy are permanently banned from entering the USA therefore are not playing on this run, Karl ‘Egghead’ Morris ex. THE EXPLOITED, UK SUBS is filling in on bass.\n\nThe band have a few UK shows planned including playing as special guests to experimental post-metal pioneers Neurosis in London, as part of NEUROSIS’ 30 year celebrations.\n\nNov 8th – London, Koko (special guests to Neurosis w. Subhumans)\n\nDec 18th – Ashton-Under-Lyne, Witchwood\n\nJan 15th – Norwich, Waterfront (special guests to UK Subs)\n\nDISCHARGE announced their signing to Nuclear Blast late last year, releasing critically acclaimed studio album ‘End Of Days’ this April to widespread critical acclaim.\n\nDischarge’s influence on the metal scene is undisputed. Their 1982 debut album ‘Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing’ is constantly cited as a classic in extreme music while the likes of Metallica, Anthrax, Sepultura andMachine Head have all covered their songs. They are a British hardcore punk band formed in 1977, characterised by a minimalistic approach to music and lyrics. A heavy, distorted and grinding guitar-driven sound and raw, shouted vocals, with lyrics on anarchistic and pacifistic themes.\n\nThe band’s 1982 debut album, ‘Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing’, went to number two in the UK Indie Charts and number 40 in the UK Album Charts. In the early 1980s, numerous Discharge singles and EPs landed in the top 10 of the UK Indie Charts, including the 1981 EP ‘Why?’ and the 1982 single ‘State Violence State Control’.\n\n‘Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing’ paved the way for thrash metal, black metal, crust punk, grindcore and various extreme metal subgenres. The musical genre of d-beat is named after Discharge and their distinctive drumbeat.\n\nDischarge are: Jeff Janiak (JJ) – vocals, To‎ny Roberts (Bones) – lead guitar, Terry Roberts (Tezz) – rhythm guitar, Roy Wainwright (Rainy) – bass, Dave Bridgewood – drums"
