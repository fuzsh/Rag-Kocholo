It should be listened to really loud and at least once per week. If you like punk, it is sound candy.\n\nProduced by Crass Productions. Engineered by Dick Drake.\n\nPhoto's by Don Denton and Lynn.\n\nPressing of 500.\n\ndead wax: Side A: \"A45/35 A\", \"KPG\" and \"3538 (2)\" & Side B: \"A45/35 B\", \"KPG\" and \"3539 (2).\n\nOh Canaduh has been covered by a number of punk bands including a great rendition by Nomeansno, but there is NOTHING like the original.\n\n-Robert Williston"
