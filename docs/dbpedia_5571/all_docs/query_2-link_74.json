        "text": "A weird year for me. My son was hospitalized for a month in February and we spent the next few months trying to get everything back to some semblance of normalcy. The album I played on repeat during those days, Big Thief, is now forever linked with that horrible experience. Linked with sleepless nights sleeping head to toe with my wife on a cot that's built for .5. With shitty room service food and some really good empanadas they served in the cafeteria. With the overpowering smell of medicine and off brand wipies and the sound of his heart rate monitor going off because he couldn't keep that dumbass cord around his big toe. As good as the album is, and as much as I enjoyed listening to it in the weeks leading up to the hospitalization, I found myself pushing it further and further away as the year went on. I don't know the last time I played it, or even any song from it. It's a bit too painful to go back to at the moment. Not sure when I'll revisit it.\n\nThe rest of my year, aside from a few albums that I'll rank below, found me closed off from new music. I played a few new albums when I cut the grass or cooked dinner, but I mostly reverted to old favorites in a playlist. I typically spend any free time I have at work playing new music, but I rarely found myself reaching for anything new. Keith Jarrett was my most listened to artist of the year, with Talk Talk and the Blue Nile not far behind. Ambience, silence, creating a mood over lyrics. I got more into jazz this year and have been playing a lot of Coltrane and Miles Davis and Bill Evans. Idk if that has to do with the events of earlier in the year or me just becoming old and boring. I played the Big Thief album enough in the first month of the year to have them in my top 3, haha.\n\nAlbums\n\n1. Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain, I Believe in You\n\n2.
