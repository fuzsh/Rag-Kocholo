        "text": "If there were ever an odd choice for the opening act at a Janes Addiction concert, I think Rolo Tomassi would have to take the crown. It was the sort of “screamo” that I really can’t stand. But the irony is that the music behind the screams was actually quite good. They were a talented band, they were just playing music that I can’t understand. It’s just bland. I’d rather eat sand. OK I’ll stop.\n\nOpening with a growling instrumental, the bass of Eric Avery echoing around the room, there was only one word I could think of: Awesome! Bass MATTERS in Jane’s Addiction and I like it. And with the original lineup on tour for possibly the last time ever, it wasn’t surprising that the setlist that followed was full of the material they produced together. Unfortunately this meant no material off of Strays, which was a bit of a pity, but understandable.\n\n“Been Caught Stealing” “1%” and “Ocean Size” were highlights of the main set, with “Stop!” ending it in epic fashion. Perry Farrell was flamboyant and hilarious as he strolled around the\n\nstage, often surrounded by half naked women on an entertaining stage\n\nset up. Indeed, you couldn’t have a Jane’s Addiction show without some of\n\nPerry’s famous theatrics! The girls screamed loud, meanwhile, for a shirtless Dave Navarro – who was often fondled by the front man. From where I was standing, it looked like Dave was wearing a shitload of makeup, but maybe that’s just how he looks? He nonetheless showed us all that he was still an outstanding guitarist – and of course Stephen Perkins showed his sweet drumming skills. The originals were back and what a joy it was to experience!\n\nAfter a long a loud call for an encore, “Jane Says” was pulled out as expected, and then for “Chip Away”, which ended the show, all members jammed on the drums until they all left the stage. This was AMAZING. What a way to end the show! And with such energy built up, you wouldn’t be too surprised by what happened next: after teasing us with dimmed lights, the venue turned the lights back on – BUT NO ONE MOVED. It was amazing. The crowd stomped, chanted, remained still for 5 minutes – and incredibly, they stopped packing up and the lights went back off. The audience was getting a second encore! This was amazing! But alas, this was not to be – after a cruel tease, the lights returned – but STILL no one moved.\n\nThe roar was electrifying – we weren’t an angry mob, we were just so blown away by the show that we wanted more. And AGAIN the lights went off – but the bastards never returned. Didn’t your mothers tell you it was cruel to tease? But somehow you couldn’t help but leave satisfied – not only was a pretty amazing experience to original lineup playing as well as you would have hoped – but then have the crowd respond like that? Well I for one will never forget this night.\n\nFull Setlist:\n\nUp The Beach\n\nMountain Song\n\nHad A Dad\n\nThree Days\n\nWhores\n\nThen She Did…\n\nBeen Caught Stealing\n\n1%\n\nOcean Size\n\nTed, Just Admit It…\n\nStop!"
