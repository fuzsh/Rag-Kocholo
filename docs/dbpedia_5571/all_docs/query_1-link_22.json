        "text": "Now I'm not to sure what the Mathcore genre is, but that is what Rolo Tomasi are categorised as. Personally, I see them more as an experimental rock band who interpret electronic instruments into their sound to produce the most unique sound in music I've heard in a long time.\n\nIt's funny too because their music is so diverse, yet the band are straight from the Arctic Monkey land of Sheffield. They shadow Evanescence to some extent, but suddenly there is a screamo cry like nothing you ever heard before which sends you into confusion. 'Kasia' is the best song of theirs which shows you everything you need to know about this band and their live performances. Oddly enough I cant imagine sitting in my room with my earphones in and listening to this band, it would be to unnerving and I wouldn't be relaxed. But with all the components of their sound toppled on top of each other live, from the fast paced synthesize, the soft voice female singing, to the heavy bass guitar, the band cover all aspects of live performing.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nReally enjoyed the concert, the band definitely gave it their all and it paid off. A lot of the songs were from the new album, Grievances, and thankfully they played Funereal and All That Has Gone Before together, as those songs do not sound complete without one another. For the encore they played Party Wounds (their most popular track, and arguably their best) and left presumably everyone in the audience with a sweet taste in their mouths. Tomassi really know how to create a wild crowd, and I think James Spence's vocal contributions at the forefront of the stage really highlighted the vivid atmosphere of the gig.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAwesome. have waited seven years for this band to visit this neck of the woods . it was well worth the wait. Their take no prisoners approach to playing is something to behold. it was especially great to note how important the bass player was in anchoring all the other instrumentation together . Loved the prog delivery overlaid with stunning vocals from the singers . Was riveted to the spot throughout .\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
