The album is full of lighter, more gentle moments to contrast the darker side to it and none more so than this.”\n\nVocalist Eva Korman added, “The narrative side to the video is about the constant cycle of change.

The End Of Eternity\n\n——-\n\nMORE ON ROLO TOMASSI:\n\nFormed in 2005 this quintet’s early material blended hardcore with kitschy synths and nonsensical song structures. However, the group shaved off its more oddball qualities in favour of shoegaze and dream-pop on subsequent releases.This sound is beautifully demonstrated with Dillinger-style freak-outs transition to lush soundscapes at a moment’s notice. Anchored by the Spence siblings’ complementary singing voices, the group perfectly blur the barrier between tranquility and destruction.\n\nThey have worked with US super producer Diplo and performed on Channel 4 TV live with Biffy Clyro (watch that HERE), they have played the SXSW Festival, released an album through IPECAC after catching the ear of Mike Patton and their last album is on around 7 million streams on Spotify alone. This most recent album from 2018 ‘Time Will Die And love Will Bury It’ was released to a flurry of praise an acclaim, landing it as the 2nd highest review score for the year on Metacritic (gaining a 92/100). Following previous tours and shows with the likes of Faith No More, Biffy Clyro, Dillinger Escape Plan, Architects, The Bronx and Gojira in 2019 (as main support), the band have established themselves as a live tour-de-force, now a headline prospect not only in their home territory of the UK and the EU, but also Australia, Japan, Russia and the USA.\n\nThere is no band on Earth quite like ROLO TOMASSI."
