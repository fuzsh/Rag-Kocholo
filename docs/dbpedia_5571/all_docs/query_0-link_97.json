        "text": "Rolo Tomassi is a British progressive metal band from Sheffield. They have been active since 2005 and their new record, Where Myth Becomes Memory, is their sixth full-length album. It is the follow up to their critically acclaimed 2018 album, Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It. The group is known for their sonic and energetic live performances, as well as their stark and consistent artistic aesthetic.\n\nTheir new record, Where Myth Becomes Memory, is a grand display of immaculate musicianship, intricate songwriting, and raw emotion. There is a consistent theme throughout the record which is accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful grand piano. The attention to detail in the recording is astonishing, as you can hear the individual cadence of each key being pressed in. The album feels like a living, breathing work of art.\n\nWhere Myth Becomes Memory will be available everywhere 4th February, 2022"
