        "text": "1.\n\nTowards Dawn 03:44\n\n2.\n\nAftermath 03:52 video\n\nIn practice past, I'm closing off Untethered by visions Unfamiliar All lines of sight Obstructed by light For what lies beneath And remains on the surface Don't blame all that is lost We revive ourselves I'll break it off Severing all ties I won't look back Fragments must realign Dimming the sparks That burned so bright We'll never know how this could be To build it up and break it off There's more to keep and less to leave behind There's more to lose and more to try and find Don't blame all that is lost We revive ourselves Unafraid of the aftermath The bones of what's below will never grow\n\n3.\n\nRituals 03:24 video\n\nThis creation of doubt won't hold back Lulled by safety Lured into these acts Caught and suffocated but refusing to expand from that Passionate Seared into the past Unavoidable, laid bare to caution There is no forgiveness here You'll find it's not all what it seems So pinch to feel the pain Clawing for a sweet escape Until I feel again You'll find it's not all what it seems So pinch to feel the pain Blessed to feel the sweet escape Until I fall again One waste to cause wreckage Nothing can restore But will I ever overcome all that has gone before? You'll find it's not all what it seems So pinch to feel the pain Clawing for a sweet escape Until I feel again You'll find it's not all what it seems So pinch to feel the pain Blessed to feel the sweet escape Until I'm born again\n\n4.\n\nThe Hollow Hour 07:28\n\n5.\n\nBalancing The Dark 03:59 video\n\nStrike, illustrate Cease, every moment grey I concur Retracting these splinters Take, navigate Disarm, in cycles crawl on I concur Retracting these splinters Etched always Lasting, reacting In movements so permanent I concur Retracting these splinters Etched always Lasting, undying A score unmarked There is no way to compose the unchartered and unknown The concept of a world without, the severity of it all To comprehend the fragility Lost in the harshness of endless Cursed by what will embody Lost in the harshness of endless The cruelty of that which is cherished\n\n6.\n\nAlma Mater 03:10\n\nA finite line that's hard to see and it aways moves away from me I don't want to wait for anything Waste away instead of vanishing Time will die and love will bury it Time will die and love will bury it Aimless strives to try and reach this Will not stir me from this sickness Stay wondering With this reckoning Watch it go by, just to give in The rush of waves I'm flooded in the running Drifting with this one constant The wish to change is washed away The outer bounds are out of reach Is it true it's everlasting? Stay wandering There is no place for peak Everything I thought could be Shouldn't be within my reach It comes in waves I long for it and I feel empty I watch it go by and I feel nothing Floating in hope, persisting to glow Give flight to this fever or don't At fates command, what could we become when desire is all undone?\n\n7.\n\nA Flood Of Light 08:20\n\nAnd I fall, into your open arms Soundly embraced here When I fail Fall into your open arms Soundly embraced here When I'm lost Plot threads for a patchwork quilt I've been searching for… Presence in a wandering heart Kept like secrets Forces bind us with no exception In my absence I have not forgotten The shadows we create Fall, in those arms again And there you are always After all this time when I'm my most lost An anchor, eternally grounding me to navigate A darkness, until a light so blinding burns through the fog Its never in doubt After all this time when the rain comes down An anchor, eternally grounding me to navigate Whats left behind, what lies ahead It can take the worst to find out But there you are always\n\n8.\n\nWhispers Among Us 05:10\n\nHoping to delay every exchange Altering state or staying the same Transform and reshape, in the midst of all this Not yet finished, so much will to fight it A misprediction, these differences don't sit well Somewhere between what is next and what has been Ease of recollecting Never to project it Harboured and held to We stretch to fit Are taught to drift The succession of the inevitable When it tears, when it ruptures, prepare It's fleeting and transient and all that is definite It becomes clear to us only in retrospect Idly engage, in rooms left to wait Lapses forgotten, here to remain Tempted by fate Outshine the grey, get carried away Aimlessly searching , forever stray Unfolding As it should\n\n9.\n\nContretemps 08:16\n\nA hidden depth to burden endlessly Golden memories and sainthood And the following fall through For a certain certainty Of what the end of this will be There's a weight that rests here And underneath innocence Rising up, raised to confront Imperfections shining through Where I wanted to hold you It's defective, let us leave it In perished walls and ceilings Uncompromising Torn and crushed So cold but pure So long Granted, I'm plagued Left untreated and empty Demanding breath and being Carved always and binding These ordered occasions, a flowing entity Is drifting back to me Locked in a farewell with what I've caused With what I forced These similarities, boundless in their might Weathered with dismay, the irreversible and eternal Overthrown, those sins do not pardon your own Woven into veins No binding can fray It's pressed into these bones No bonds here will break Links along a chain It's pressed into these bones\n\n10.\n\nRisen 05:37"
