        "text": "Photo Credit: Andy Ford\n\nRolo Tomassi have released their new track Closer (Daniel Avery Edit), taken from their forthcoming Closer (The Edits) EP.\n\nSpeaking about the edit and remix project, Rolo Tomassi say: “It was great to get the opportunity to have an artist like Daniel Avery produce this edit of the track. We’re big fans of his own work so jumped at the chance to have him work on it. Similarly with ATTLAS, who has taken take ‘Closer’ and opened it up to a whole new audience with his incredible remix. It’s just so exciting to hear these other artists take elements from our songwriting and make something entirely new.”\n\nThe EP features Daniel Avery, ATTLAS and Ki Oni/Luke Elliott edits of Closer, the track originally featured on their album Where Myth Becomes Memory which was released earlier this year.\n\nCloser (The Edits) is set for release on 5th August 2022 via MNRK and is available to pre-order HERE."
