        "text": "Since 2005, Sheffield, England's Rolo Tomassi have shown remarkable stylistic breadth and on their new single, \"Drip,\" which comes off the newly announced 2022 album, Where Myth Becomes Memory, they meld mathcore with shoegaze, dream pop and tinges of black metal to craft a dynamic, episodic journey into just under six minutes of music.\n\n\"This is a really important album for all of us,\" said co-vocalist and keyboardist James Spence. \"Of anything we've done, it's the one I'm most proud of,\" he continued, \"I think it's the most ambitious and creative that our band has ever sounded and something that we've all needed to get through the last few years. We can't wait to share it and to have you help us bring it to life.\"\n\n\"Drip\" speaks directly to Spence's claims with uncertainty at every moment as the track, which comes on the heels of the previously released 2021 single \"Cloaked,\" opens with a rigid, pounding downbeat and droning feedback for a full 90 seconds before everything goes into full throttle. As the song progresses, calmer, more ethereal moments take over, offering a brilliant sense of contrast.\n\nWatch the video below and view the Where Myth Becomes Memory artwork and track listing further down the page. Look for the record to be released on Feb. 4 on MNRK and pre-order your copy here.\n\nRolo Tomassi, \"Echo Chamber\" Lyrics\n\nOn the worst days it’s growing, growing so slowly\n\nWhat to embody? A plea for the remedy\n\nForced into a place that never felt like home\n\nAnd if it takes me here then where is there left to go?\n\nTo strike before it’s all too late\n\nPut to rest, all souls are safe\n\nExisting in the maze\n\nMemory is imperfect\n\nTake my hand, let’s slip beneath the surface\n\nOn the worst days I slip, as deceitful as hope is\n\nWalking on a knife edge, I traced the line and I leapt\n\nIt’s been strange and stranger still\n\nFreed from the fears that paralyse\n\nAlways distaste, always regret, the least of it\n\nA revelation into reality unspoken\n\nBetween the signs and the sounds, taking shape encompassing\n\nAll things begin and end here\n\nWhat it means to be\n\nIn the aftermath of tragedy\n\nWhat it means to be\n\nFinally uncaged and I lost my way\n\nUnderstanding the relevance of the eclipse\n\nWhen I can’t forgive\n\nNothing is ever enough\n\nRolo Tomassi, \"Echo Chamber\" Music Video\n\nRolo Tomassi, Where Myth Becomes Memory Album Art + Track Listing"
