        "text": "We dont typically look to pop albums to answer our cultural moment, let alone to meet the soul hunger left in the wake of global catastrophe. But occasionally, an artist proves the form more malleable and capacious than we knew. With Laurel Hell, Mitski cements her reputation as an artist in possession of such power - capable of using her talent to perform the alchemy that turns our most savage and alienated experiences into the very elixir that cures them.\n\nHer critically beloved last album, Be the Cowboy, built on the breakout acclaim of 2016s Puberty 2 and launched her from cult favorite to indie star. She ascended amid a fever of national division, and the grind of touring and pitfalls of increased visibility influenced her music as much as her spirit. Like the mountain laurels for this new album is named, public perception, like the intoxicating prism of the internet, can offer an alluring façade that obscures a deadly trapone that tightens the more you struggle. Exhausted by this warped mirror, and our addiction to false binaries, she began writing songs that stripped away the masks and revealed the complex and often contradictory realities behind them.\n\nShe wrote many of these songs during or before 2018, while the album finished mixing in May 2021. It is the longest span of time Mitski has ever spent on a record, and a process that concluded amid a radically changed world. She recorded Laurel Hell with her longtime producer Patrick Hyland throughout the isolation of a global pandemic, during which some of the songs slowly took on new forms and meanings, like seed to flower. Sometimes its hard to see the change when youre the agent of it, but for the lucky rest of us, Mitski has written a soundtrack for transformation, a map to the place where vulnerability and resilience, sorrow and delight, error and transcendence can all sit within our humanity, can all be seen as worthy of acknowledgment, and ultimately, love.\n\nPompeii, Cate Le Bons sixth full-length studio album and the follow up to 2019s Mercury-nominated Reward, bears a storied title summoning apocalypse, but the metaphor eclipses any dissection of immediacy, says Le Bon. Not to downplay her nod to disorientation induced by double catastrophe  global pandemic plus climate emergencys colliding eco-traumas resonate all too eerily. What would be your last gesture? she asks. But just as Vesuvius remains active, Pompeii reaches past the current crises to tap into what Le Bon calls an economy of time warp where life roils, bubbles, wrinkles, melts, hardens, and reconfigures unpredictably, like lavaor sound, rather. Like she says in the opener, Dirt on the Bed, Sound doesnt go away / In habitual silence / It reinvents the surface / Of everything you touch.\n\nPompeii is sonically minimal in parts, and its lyrics jog between self-reflection and direct address. Vulnerability, although obscured, challenges Le Bons tendencies towards irony. Written primarily on bass and composed entirely alone in an uninterrupted vacuum, Le Bon plays every instrument (except drums and saxophones) and recorded the album largely by herself with long-term collaborator and co-producer Samur Khouja in Cardiff, Wales. Enforced time and space pushed boundaries, leading to an even more extreme version of Le Bon's studio process  as exits were sealed, she granted herself permission to annihilate identity. Assumptions were destroyed, and nothing was rejected as her punk assessments of existence emerged.\n\nEnter Le Bons signature aesthetic paradox: songs built for Now miraculously germinate from her interests in antiquity, philosophy, architecture, and divinitys modalities. Unhinged opulence rests in sonic deconstruction that finds coherence in pop structures, and her narrativity favors slippage away from meaning. In Remembering Me, she sings: In the classical rewrite / I wore the heat like / A hundred birthday cakes / Under one sun. Reconstituted meltdowns, eloquently expressed. This mirrors what she says about the creative process: as a changeable element, its sometimes the only point of control a circuit breaker. Shes for sure enlightened, or at least more highly evolved than the rest of us. Hear the last stanza on the album closer, Wheel: I do not think that you love yourself / Id take you back to school / And teach you right / How to want a life / But, it takes more time than youd tender. Reprimanding herself or a loved one, no matter: its an end note about learning how to love, which takes a lifetime and is more urgent than ever.\n\nTo leverage visionary control, Le Bon invented twisted types of discipline into her absurdist decision making. Primary goals in this project were to mimic the religious sensibility in one of Tim Presleys paintings, which hung on the studio wall as a meditative image and was reproduced as a portrait of Le Bon for Pompeiis cover. Fist across the heart, stalwart and saintly: how to make music that sounds like a painting? Cate asked herself. Enter piles of Pompeiis signature synths made on favourites such as the Yamaha DX7, amongst others; basslines inspired by 1980s Japanese city pop, designed to bring joyfulness and abandonment; vocal arrangements that add memorable depth to the melodic fabric of each song; long-term collaborator Stella Mozgawas jazz-thinking percussion patched in from quarantined Australia; and Khoujas encouraging presence.\n\nThe songs of Pompeii feel suspended in time, both of the moment and instant but reactionary and Dada-esque in their insistence to be playful, satirical, and surreal. From the spirited, strutting bass fretwork of Moderation, to the sax-swagger of Running Away; a tale exquisite in nature but ultimately doomed (The fountain that empties the world / Too beautiful to hold), escapism lives as a foil to the outside world. Pompeiis audacious tribute to memory, compassion, and mortal salience is here to stay.\n\nThe past few years have seen Le Bon emerge as a much lauded and sought-after collaborator, producing albums for contemporaries such as Deerhunter (Why Hasnt Everything Already Disappeared?), John Grant (Boy From Michigan), and forthcoming albums from both Devendra Banhart and H. Hawkline. Shes not so much a gun for hire as a multi-faceted artist and producer who can both steer the ship and tap into a collective mindset; in 2019, she joined John Cale for a three-night live stretch in Paris, and 2021 will see a bass appearance on the track \"If I Don't Hear from You Tonight\" from Courtney Barnett's Things Take Time, Take Time. As Bradford Cox aptly notes about Le Bon, \"there are artists who look inwards or outwards, and then there are the very rare ones who transcend either location.\"\n\nThree years after the release of her critically acclaimed debut, Putting On Airs, Nashville-raised singer-songwriter Erin Rae shares an intimate, honest, and playful version of herself through her sophomore album Lighten Up. Produced by Jonathan Wilson, and recorded in the musically hallowed grounds of Californias Topanga Canyon, the album represents a sonic and inner shift for Rae. In it, she embraces more of her influences, like baroque-pop, cosmic country, and indie-folk songs while mirroring a more compassionate self-view she calls accepting my humanness.\n\nAlthough she grew up in a musically oriented family, Raes pursuit of music happened by accident. After being gifted a Martin acoustic guitar on her 18th birthday, Rae decided to drop out of college after just one semester. Her goal at the time had little to do with making music into a career, and everything to do with spending more time and energy with the community of musicians and writers she knew back home. Looking back on those days, she recalls the initial high of playing live at an open mic during winter break and realizing, this is how I connect with people. I have to pursue this. Rae has continued to connect with people through her music ever since, performing at mainstays like Newport Folk Festival, Red Rocks Amphitheater, and sharing stages with Father John Misty, Hiss Golden Messenger, Jenny Lewis, Jason Isbell, and Iron & Wine. The success of Putting On Airs also earned her a nomination for Emerging Act of The Year at the 2019 Americana Music Awards alongside other trailblazing artists like Yola, Jade Bird, and J.S. Ondara. When the Covid-19 pandemic called a halt to touring, Rae took advantage of the opportunity to revel in a wide range of musical influences she had absorbed since the making of Putting On Airs, sitting in an un-rushed space while deciding which direction she wanted to take her music next.\n\nThough Rae says the core of her work will always stem from the songwriting she was raised on, the making of Putting On Airs with collaborators Jerry Bernhardt, Dan Knobler, and Dominic Billett inspired her to deepen her music exploration outside the traditional Americana box and listen to records in a broader way. It opened up a sonic world to me that I had always enjoyed, but that felt mysterious. The process of making my last record allowed me to visualize how recorded sounds come to be, so returning to recordings of beloved artists like Feist, Judee Sill, Wilco, became exciting all over again. I could suddenly imagine what was happening in the room to create what I was hearing on the recording. This newfound excitement led Rae down many rabbit holes, particularly a deep-dive into English psych-folk artists like Kevin Ayers and Pete Dello And Friends, as well as songwriters like Gene Clark, Scott Walker, and Jesse Winchester. That expansive discovery of musicality led her to connect with Wilson, known for his work with artists like Father John Misty, Jenny O., and Roger Waters. Their shared love for the cinematic pop of the Walker Brothers, Bobbie Gentry, and the folk stylings of Margo Guryan created a solid foundation to create together, so Rae flew to Wilson's Five Star Studios in February 2021. Wilson called on musicians Jake Blanton (Bedouine, The Killers) and Drew Erickson (Weyesblood, Father John Misty) to contribute bass, keys, and string arrangements, and played drums and lead guitars himself. Erin invited friends Kevin Morby and Meg Duffy of Hand Habits to contribute, and Wilson's longtime friend Ny Oh to sing some of the background vocals. The result is a fresh, authentic, and singular collection of recordings that are clearly rooted in a classic \"canyon\" sound. Lighten Up also showcases a new level of personal growth for Rae, and invites listeners to share in the results of her work towards self-acceptance. My last record was a lot of self-assessment and criticism, and trying to kick old habits and ways of relating to people, Rae acknowledges. This one is about blossoming, opening up, and living a little more in the present moment. Accepting what it is to be human.\n\nIn the lead single, Modern Woman Rae celebrates womanhood and femininity in all of its forms, countering outdated beliefs over driving drums and rocking guitars and inviting an inclusive perspective through her cheeky lyrics come see a modern woman. With Lighten Up and Try a song that embodies the albums title, as well as its ethos, Rae dwells on the process of opening up to love and to life, and the vulnerability that comes with that process. Expounding on the songs meaning, Rae shares, This song for me just feels like celebrating the vulnerability of living. Saying yeah, No one really knows what theyre doing. You just have to try.\n\nIn the measured track, Mind - Heart Rae outlines the dangers of codependency, and through the straightforward lyrics, the mind is fucked but the heart is pure, she meditates on the unreliability of thoughts. Both of my parents have practiced meditation throughout my life following different traditions. This song for me is essentially using mindfulness to detach from habitual patterns of thought and behavior, and reconnecting to the heart, the intuition. In True Loves Face she opens to the potential of love and the choice to not flee from it over retro melodies, affirming through her bell-like vocals, I will know it when I see it / I will not turn it away. And in the psychedelic Candy + Curry Rae balances awakening and being centered in the present moment, with a soundscape that invites the listener to relax and enjoy the ride. With Lighten Up, Rae hopes to give listeners the opportunity to borrow what shes learned, that there can be a lightness when things feel heavy and that even our darkest corners can allow us to shine. I hope this record encourages people to be a little softer towards themselves. Rae shares. If [Lighten Up] gives people listening the space to feel more tender towards themselves and move in the world from that place, that would be the dream for me."
