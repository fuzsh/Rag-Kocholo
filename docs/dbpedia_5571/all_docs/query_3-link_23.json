I think it’s the most ambitious and creative that our band has ever sounded and something that we’ve all needed to get through the last few years. We can’t wait to share it and to have you help us bring it to life.”\n\nWhere Myth Becomes Memory will be the first album to be released in their new contract with E-one records.
