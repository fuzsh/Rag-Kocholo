        "text": "Brand new single 'Cloaked' is out today.\n\nThe band have already announced a special hometown show at Chalk in Brighton on the 12th November, tickets on sale now.\n\nROLO TOMASSI are back. Following the recent announcement of a hometown show at Chalk in Brighton on November 12th, the band can now reveal they have signed to eOne (High On Fire, Black Label Society, The Contortionist) AND today release their massive, brand new single and video, 'Cloaked'. Watch the new video - HERE\n\nJames Spence (vocals and keys) on the signing - \"We’re thrilled to be signing with eOne Heavy for this new record. It was an easy decision for us and they’ve been a dream to work with. We’re looking forwards to everything that follows.\"\n\nOn the signing, Scott Givens, the SVP of rock and metal at eOne explains - \"Rolo Tomassi are a band that we have long wanted to have on your roster. We are thrilled they have chosen us to be their label partners.\"\n\nEva Spence (vocals), now based in her new home in New Jersey, USA - \"We're excited to finally share new music after spending the last two years working on our new record. Writing has been essential for us this past year in the absence of playing live, we can't wait to get back on the road and hope to see you at a show soon.\"\n\nCo-lead vocalist James Spence explains a bit more about the new video - \"David and James who worked on the video really helped us to bring to life the themes of the song. The narrative visualises the process of change within us with every new experience we have. The themes of dualism and identity are explored through the contrasting colours and the movements of the characters.\"\n\nLive wise, ROLO TOMASSI recently announce their first live event in 2 years, set to take place at Brighton Chalk 12th November, 2021. The band will be joined at this exclusive event by very special guests Devil Sold His Soul. They have also already been announced on next years Complexity Festival on 12th Feb 2022 in Haarlem, Netherlands .\n\nWatch this space for a lot more live news soon."
