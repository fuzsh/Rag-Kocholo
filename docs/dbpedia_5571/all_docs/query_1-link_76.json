Their stage presence is amazing, their music is amazing, and the crowd and atmosphere was amazing.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAwesome. have waited seven years for this band to visit this neck of the woods . it was well worth the wait. Their take no prisoners approach to playing is something to behold. it was especially great to note how important the bass player was in anchoring all the other instrumentation together . Loved the prog delivery overlaid with stunning vocals from the singers . Was riveted to the spot throughout .\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nReally enjoyed the concert, the band definitely gave it their all and it paid off. A lot of the songs were from the new album, Grievances, and thankfully they played Funereal and All That Has Gone Before together, as those songs do not sound complete without one another. For the encore they played Party Wounds (their most popular track, and arguably their best) and left presumably everyone in the audience with a sweet taste in their mouths. Tomassi really know how to create a wild crowd, and I think James Spence's vocal contributions at the forefront of the stage really highlighted the vivid atmosphere of the gig.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
