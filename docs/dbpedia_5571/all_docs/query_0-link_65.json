        "text": "The UK's most exciting new heavy band, HERIOT, will support experimental metal legends Rolo Tomassi on their Europe 2023 tour, alongside Holy Fawn.\n\nDates:\n\nFeb 03: BE Antwerp Trix\n\nFeb 04: DE Hamburg Headcrash\n\nFeb 05: DK Copenhagen Pumpehuset\n\nFeb 07: DE Berlin Maschinehaus\n\nFeb 08: CZ Prague Underdogs\n\nFeb 09: HU Budapest Durer Kert\n\nFeb 10: AT Vienna Arena\n\nFeb 11: DE Munich Orangehouse\n\nFeb 12: DE Cologne Artheater\n\nFeb 13: NL Den Bosch Willem Twee\n\nFeb 15: UK London Electric Ballroom\n\nTickets: https://tinyurl.com/eurotourtickets\n\nThe news follows HERIOT's recent tour with Zeal & Ardor - and the band will also cap off their staggeringly-successful 2022 with a weekend run with Boston Manor.\n\nReleasing their globally-critically acclaimed debut EP, Profound Morality in April, HERIOT played to packed tents at Download Festival, 2000trees, Bloodstock, ArcTanGent, gathering a legion of fans in the process.\n\nDates with Boston Manor:\n\nDec 08: UK Leicester O2 Academy\n\nDec 09: UK Bournemouth Old Fire Station\n\nDec 10: UK Tunbridge Wells, The Forum\n\nProfound Morality is out now via Church Road Records, available here:https://bfan.link/profound-morality\n\nHERIOT are a blistering, vicious, visceral new group, having made their mark with their titanic singles 'Dispirit', 'Recreant', 'Cleansed Existence', ‘Near Vision/Enter the Flesh’, as well as their monstrous cover of Machine Head's 'Ten Ton Hammer' over the course of 2021.\n\nThe band’s output across the last year has led to heads being turned across the metal world, all blown away by HERIOT’s unrelenting take on the new heavy. Fully-focused and with a razor-sharp edge, the awe-inspiring double-vocal attack of Jake Packer and Debbie Gough on vocals is all-conquering; the titanic support of Erhan Alman (guitar) and Julian Gage (drums) rock-solid.\n\nProfound Morality reflects different aspects of human behaviour in our modern society. How far people push their moral boundaries to achieve what they want; outdated modes of living and beliefs that harm our contemporary life; life and death and how fulfilment can be achieved, be that helping or hurting peers; and how this shapes tyrants of industry, and a clear separation of class and wealth.\n\nHERIOT have deservedly been grabbing attention with all four pairs of hands, weaponising metallic sludge and hardcore, unholy levels of distortion, speed and gut-punching talent. Elements of Nails, Knocked Loose, Code Orange, and Vein combine and collide to exhilarating new effect, to create a new sound that is truly groundbreaking, fully worthy of the notice the band are achieving.\n\nIn their short recent history HERIOT have caught the attention of Metal Hammer, Rock Sound, Brooklyn Vegan, Kerrang!, Revolver, and Knotfest, among many others. Acclaimed as \"one of the most promising young bands in modern metalcore\", HERIOT have supported Rolo Tomassi and Svalbard on their respective UK tours, and performed at Download, 2000trees, Bloodstock, ArcTanGent and more in 2022.\n\nHERIOT are:"
