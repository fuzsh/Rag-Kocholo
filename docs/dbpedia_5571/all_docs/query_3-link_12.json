        "text": "American post-hardcore band\n\nRollo Tomasi is an American post-hardcore band from Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBand history\n\n[edit]\n\nRollo Tomasi formed in October 1999 by Neil Sandler, Craig Olson, and Neil Keener after Olson and Sandler's previous band Traluma had disbanded. Sometimes compared to bands like Helmet and The Jesus Lizard,[1][2] as well as Sandler's previous bands, Traluma and Gauge, Rollo Tomasi blend tight rhythms and aggression with a healthy nod to the early, post hardcore bands of the mid-90s DC scene.[3][4]\n\nTheir name was taken from the film L.A. Confidential, in which a police officer creates a fictional character, Rollo Tomasi, to personify all the bad guys who think â€œthey can get away with it\".[5]\n\nIn November 2011, James Staffel of Yakuza replaced original drummer Craig Olson. In October 2013, bass player Jeff Larsen took over second guitar duties from the departing guitarist Matt Fast, and Chris LaFrombois (formerly of the Reptoids) joined the band on bass. Since the fall of 2016, Brad Bischoff has been the bass player.\n\nMembers of Rollo Tomasi have been in other notable bands, including The Sky Corvair, Gauge, Yakuza, Planes Mistaken for Stars, Brokeback, Hanalei, and Treaty of Paris.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fear Is Unsafe (Shakefork Records, 2019)[1]\n\nCoward (Shakefork Records, 2010)[2]\n\nWork Slow Crush Foes (Underground Communique Records, 2005)[3]\n\nHe Who Holds You (Divot Records, 2001)[3]\n\nCompilation appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Kenna Rae (Shakefork Records, 2011)\n\nThe World I Know - A Tribute to Pegboy (Underground Communique, 2006) [6]\n\nLive on WLUW 88.7 FM (2004)[7]\n\nSalute - A Tribute to the Fallen and the Survivors of September (Paper Crane Records, 2001)\n\nBand members\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
