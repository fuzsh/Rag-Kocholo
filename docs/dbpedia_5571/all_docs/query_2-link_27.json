        "text": "Rolo Tomassi have announced details of their sixth album, ‘Where Myth Becomes Memory’.\n\nThe Sheffield five-piece, who have defied genre pigeonholes at every turn since forming in 2005, released ‘Cloaked’, their first new track since 2018’s critically-acclaimed fifth record ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It’, back in August. They’ve now followed it with punishing second single ‘Drip’. You can hear it below.\n\nFounding member James Spence said of the new record: “This is a really important album for all of us. Of anything we’ve done, it’s the one I’m most proud of. I think it’s the most ambitious and creative that our band has ever sounded and something that we’ve all needed to get through the last few years. We can’t wait to share it and to have you help us bring it to life.”\n\nLed by Spence’s sister, vocalist Eva Korman, Rolo Tomassi have carved out a reputation as one of Britain’s most unpredictable and consistently ambitious outfits, emerging from mathcore beginnings to record a debut album with Diplo and go onto flirt with progressive rock (2010’s ‘Cosmology’), metalcore (2012’s ‘Astraea’) and string sections (2015’s ‘Grievances’). Kerrang! called ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It’ “a classic…with the longer songs in particular allowing the band free rein to indulge every experimental urge.”\n\nSpeaking on ‘Drip’, guitarist Chris Cayford said: “When we start the writing process for each record, we always wait for the first song that clicks. It feels similar to our music but is also intangibly different to the extent we know it’s the next step and we need to build the album around it. This was the song that did that.”\n\nThe band will play four UK dates in February, taking in Nottingham, Manchester, Bristol and London. You can see those dates below."
