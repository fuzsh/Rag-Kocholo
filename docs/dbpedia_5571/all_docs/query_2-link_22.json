        "text": "As an attorney and former prosecutor, I feel I must comment on the recent dismissal of the criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the accidental shooting and tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. I firmly believe that *all* attorneys must follow the law, our professional ethics rules, and be honest and forthcoming in all duties as officers of the court and as advocates for our clients. That is how we as a society have determined we can fairly arrive at a result we all can agree is \"Justice.\" However, *prosecutors in particular* should be held to the highest standards and MUST absolutely follow the law and the rules. There is *NEVER* a reason to withhold or hide evidence from the defense. Ever. It is inexcusable, intolerable, and unforgivable. It makes me sick to think any of our fellow humans were convicted and sentenced in a case where prosecutors withheld evidence - and it was probably exculpatory evidence or why would it have been withheld? To my fellow prosecutors, your job is not to convict. Your job is to bring *all* of the evidence to the fact-finder in accordance with the laws and rules of our justice system and let the fact-finder do its job. You are stewards and protectors of the justice *system.* You are not adversaries of the People who are \"Defendants.\" There is no Justice here. Not for Ms. Hutchins' family, who probably counted on the prosecution to secure what felt like justice for their wrongfully killed loved one, and not for Alec Baldwin who no doubt has suffered from the stress of this impending prosecution for years, in addition to the weight of the reality that his co-worker tragically died at his hand. If he was not criminally culpable, he is now deprived of a proper acquittal. The prosecutors ensured that *everyone* in the courtroom lost today. I cannot change what happened, but I commit to working towards creating a more honest and ethical profession in every way I can during my lifetime and being the change I want to see in the world. https://lnkd.in/eyMFPFA2\n\nContext is everything. I'm always cautious of partial stories. ‚è± I'd like to know what happened in the moments leading up to the start of the video and what happened afterward. We live in a world where everyone wants to be the first to comment. People often jump to conclusions and can ruin lives by running with a story before they have all the facts. In fact, research indicates that false information spreads six times faster than factual information. Then, when the full story emerges, those same people almost never apologize or share the updated details. This is a very interesting clip üëü and would make a great opening scene for a movie üé¨ . #SeekTheTruth #FullStory #ContextMatters #ResponsibleJournalism #Misinformation #MediaEthics #ThinkBeforeYouSpeak #FactCheck #SocialMediaResponsibility #MediaLiteracy\n\nüö®üö®Breaking News: Alec Baldwin‚Äôs Case Dismissed for Prosecutorial Misconductüö®üö® Alec Baldwin's case has been dismissed by a judge due to prosecutorial misconduct. I was on Court TV this morning discussing this significant development. Yesterday, testimony revealed that ammunition, potentially explaining the live round that killed the cinematographer on the set of \"Rust,\" was dropped off at the police department. However, this crucial evidence was not included in the \"Rust\" case file but placed in another case and was not provided to the defense until now. Today, the judge held hearings, calling multiple witnesses. It was discovered that the reason the ammunition was not connected to the \"Rust\" case was due to failed communication attempts with the individual who provided it, despite his clear statement linking it to the incident. Consequently, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice due to this serious oversight. This decision also impacts the case of Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer who was previously convicted and is currently serving her sentence. Her attorneys are likely rushing to file an urgent motion for her release. This situation is a reminder of the importance of proper evidence disclosure by police and prosecutors as mandated by the Constitution.
