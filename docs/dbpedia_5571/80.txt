ROLO TOMASSI

Rolo Tomassi are a female-fronted British band NME dubbed “mathcore noise bastards (and bastress).”

The band, which hails from Sheffield, formed in 2005, and takes their name from the film L.A. Confidential. While Rolo Tomassi has toured the U.S. with Jane’s Addiction, joined Dillinger Escape Plan on their European outing and saw their 2010 album, Cosmology, produced by Diplo. Pitchfork said singer Eva Spence is, “equally comfortable singing in a glassy, ethereal coo and a glasses-shattering screech.”
