Indeed, it occupies a supreme place in the Syrian Church in general, and in the Eastern Church in particular. Thus, we decided to fulfill his desire by writing this history for which we exhausted considerable labor and pain. We titled it Dufaqat al-Tib fi Tarikh Dayr al-Qiddis Mar Matta al-‘Ajib (Gushes of Perfume in Writing the History of the Monastery of the Marvelous St Matthew). The book treats the chronicles of the monastery since its establishment in the latter part of the fourth century until the present. May the noble reader find it a spiritual example of asceticism, sacrifice and piety and raise his mind high above the preoccupations of this life and unite it with God At our patriarchal residence in Damascus September 1, 1961\n\nxiii\n\nTRANSLATOR’S INTRODUCTION St. Matthew’s Monastery north of Mosul, whose history is detailed in this book, is perhaps the most ancient religious institution in Iraq. It is a miracle that despite the adversities brought upon this country since the fourth century by the Persians, Muslim Arabs, Mongols, Turks, and Roman Catholic missionaries of the Vatican, who unscrupulously strove to bring the Eastern churches, including the Syrian Orthodox Church, to which the monastery belongs, under the authority of the pope, this monastery has remained resolute to this day and has defied the woes of time. In the eighteenth century the monastery faced further misfortune from the marauding Kurds in the vicinity who attacked it several times, killing its monks and pillaging its property and its invaluable library. In 1871, they viciously assassinated its courageous superior, Bishop Cyril Denha. The monastery perches on a peak of the mountain called Maqlub because of the uneven formation of its rocky strata. It is also called St. Matthew’s Mountain because St. Matthew lived in it, and al-Faf Mountain because in the past it was inhabited by thousands of anchorites. To the citizens of Mosul and the neighboring villages, it is known as Dayr Shaykh Matti (Shaykh Matti’s Monastery). The story of St. Matthew and the building of his monastery in this mountain is recorded in this book. Originally written in Syriac, it was first published by Rev. Paul Bedjan together with the story of St. Behnam in Acta Martyum et Sanctorum 2 (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1891):397–441, with the title “Mar Behnam and His Sister Sarah.” Elias Behnam, a young monk from St. Matthew’s Monastery who died at an early age in 1941, found a copy of the story in a seventh-century Syriac manuscript at the monastery’s library. He translated it into Arabic and published it with the title Qissat al-Qiddis Mar Matta (“Story of St. Matthew”: [Mosul: Umm al-Rabi’ayn Press, 1938] reprinted at Baghdad: Mu’in Mahfouz Press, 2004). Unfortunately, the translator offered no information about his source beyond stating that the manuscript dates xv\n\nxvi\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nback to the seventh century. But his marginal comments, derived from later Syriac sources, shed more light on the life-story of St. Matthew and Mar Behnam. The account the author, Patriarch Jacob III, presents about St. Matthew is more extensive and informative. It covers not only St. Matthew’s life story but an in-depth physical and spiritual description of the monastery as an outstanding institution which played a significant role in the history of the Church of the East. From this account we learn about its monks and superiors, its magnificent school and library. Most important, the author offers an insight into the prominence of the monastery as a Seat of the Maphrianate, rivaling the Maphrianate of Takrit. He vividly portrays the strength of Syriac Christianity in Mesopotamia, both before and after it gradually began to fade because of the impact of Islam. While the author lauds the role of the monastery’s monks for their emphasis of knowledge, their contribution to known sciences in their time, and their role in the dissemination of the Gospel, he censures them for their reckless and arbitrary abuse of the monastery’s position and the privileges granted them by some patriarchs. Although he does not explicitly describe the harm they caused the church, one comes to recognize that the repugnant behavior of some recalcitrant monks who pandered to the Muslim governors of the district of Nineveh for immediate selfish gain caused considerable damage to the Syrian Church. From the author’s narrative we learn that St. Matthew’s monastery was the pride of the Church of the East. As a Seat of the Maphrianate, it received the full attention of its superiors, who rebuilt its fallen structures, planted orchards in its vicinity, and drew water to it from far away fountains to meet the need of its occupants. They resisted the attacks of the marauding Kurds and rebuilt what they had destroyed. Above all, they preserved learning in the monastery until the modern era. As a religious monument the monastery was until recently the subject of admiration of both Christians and Muslims. Motivated by genuine religious faith, many women sought the spiritual intercession of St. Matthew to have sons. Indeed, my mother appealed to the saint to intercede on her behalf to grant her a male child, promising to call him Matti, honoring the saint’s name. As a young attorney in 1947, I\n\nTRANSLATOR’S INTRODUCTION\n\nxvii\n\nwas asked to defend a Muslim citizen in the courts of Mosul. Much to my surprise, I learned he was called Matti (Matthew), a strictly Christian name Muslims never use. When I asked why, he said that his mother lost many children in infancy. Her neighbors told her to appeal to Shaykh Matti (St Matthew) to grant her a son. She did so and vowed that if the child survived, she would call him Matti. In translating this book I have tried to follow the author as closely as possible, but sometimes, I have felt constrained to tone down hyperbolic phrases and eliminate redundances. Throughout, the author uses the term “church,” by which he means the Syrian Orthodox Church. He also uses the tem “Church of the East” to denote that part of the Syrian Church lying east of the Euphrates river. In the past it covered present-day Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan up to the border of India. The western part of the same church covered Syria proper and southern Turkey. A term often used in the book is that of Maphryono (plural Maphryone), a Syriac word meaning “Fruitful.” As the Syrian Church spread eastward to Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration of this vast church from Antioch, and later from other locations in Syria, was rendered difficult by geographical and political considerations, particularly the continuous warfare between Persia and the Byzantine Empire. This situation led the Patriarch of Antioch to establish the dignity of a Catholicos or Maphryono to administer the Church of the East. The Maphryono had the authority to ordain bishops, metropolitans and other clergymen, but he was subject to the patriarch. The original seat of the Maphryono was the city of Takrit, but in the seventh century was moved to St. Matthew’s Monastery. This shift created a conflict between Takrit and the monastery, weakening the church. In modern times, as monasticism declined and monastic life became a thing of the past, St. Matthew’s Monastery, lost its position as a place of retreat. It is not even suitable to be a school where boys can continue their education. As far back as 1892, one writer said that St. Matbhew’s Monastery “would be a gloomy place for a lot of boys.” 1 1\n\nOswald H. Parry, Six Months in a Syrian Monastery (1895, rpt. Gorgias Press, 2004), 270. TRANS.\n\nxviii\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nThe monastery’s last school, opened in 1923, survived a little more than a decade. Today this once monumental church institution is inhabited by only two monks. However, it remains an attraction for summer vacationers from Mosul and its neighboring villages. In 1946, a group of concerned Syrians of Mosul intended to open a summer resort in the monastery, but the project failed to get off ground.\n\nSOURCES 1– The life-story of St. Matthew, Syriac MS. 2– The life-story of the martyr Mar Behnam in Paul Bedjan, Acta Maryrum et Sanctorum (Syriac), Vol. 2 (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1891). 3– The letter of St. Simon of Beth Arsham on Barsoum of Nisibin and the introduction of Nestorianism to Persia (Syriac). 4– The Ecclesiastical History of John of Ephesus in Syriac. 2 5– John of Ephesus, The Life-Stories of Syrian Ascetics. 6– The letter of Patriarch Mar Athanasius 1, to the monks of St. Matthew’s Monastery in, Chronicle of Michael Rabo in Syriac. 3 7– The letter of Patriarch John of the Sedros to Mar Marutha of Takrit in Michael Rabo, Chronicle in Syriac. 8– The reply of Mar Marutha to Patriarch John in Michael Rabo in Syriac. 9– An account found in St. Matthew’s Monastery concerning the chain of the laying of the hand in Micahel Rabo. 10– The canons of the Second Council of St. Matthew’s Monastery in 628 contained in a unique copy completed in 1204 which is now at the Library of Syrian Patriarchate, in Syriac. 11– The letter of Maphroyono John I, of Takrit in Michael Rabo. 12– Letter of the learned Rabban Dawud bar Paul in Syriac. 2\n\nSee John of Ephesus, Part Three of the Ecclesiastical History of Mor (Saint) John Bishop of Ephesus, (Syriac text) ed.

MATTHEW’S MONASTERY St. Matthew’s Monastery enjoys a broad fame in the countries of the East in general, and in the Syrian Orthodox Church in particular. Such fame could be attributed to a variety of reasons, namely, its beautiful location, glorious air and refreshing water. At one time it accommodated thousands of monks who pursued monastic life. It also gained wide fame for the miracles of its founder who healed hundreds of afflicted with sicknesses and woes. It contains the remains of prominent church dignitaries. 11 It was the center of learning for thousands of monks, and housed a magnificent library. Many eminent patriarchs, maphryone and metropolitans graduated from its famous school. In addition, St. Matthew’s Monastery enjoyed superlative privileges, which afforded it a singular place in the Syrian Orthodox Church of the East. Thus, it played a significant role on the stage of ecclesiastical history and the dissemination of the Gospel’s message. In the following chapters we shall detail these matters and impart to the noble reader an idea about the splendid characteristics of this remarkable monastery in past ages. It is a small wonder that it is the most famous and ancient of all the monasteries of the East because of its antiquity, great number of its monks, religious learned men and durability. 12 11\n\nEspecially Bar Hebraeus.

MATTHEW’S MONASTERY This mountain was known in our church sources as al-Faf, a Syriac term meaning thousands, because of the several thousands of monks and ascetics who inhabited it in the past, 13 especially in the fifth century, the golden age of the monastery. Later, it came to be known as St. Matthew’s Mountain 14 or Jabal Maqlub because of the uneven formation of its rocky strata. It is a high mountain of numerous canyons, windings, gullies, crevices and caverns. The monastery perches on a peak 3400 feet above sea level. Together with the two mountains of Ba’shiqa and Mar Daniel (near Bartulli), it forms a splendorous panorama, since it is the biggest and highest of the other two. Its sharp slopes are characterized by rocky protrusions and deep valleys hard to traverse or climb. They are spread by tiny mounds separated by earth covered depressions. Its top is almost level covered with a stratum of earth marked by vestiges of ancient\n\nsalem, 1936): 221–224.

Oswald H. Parry who visited the monastery in 1892, says that “Mar Mattha is in general known by the name of Sheikh Mattai, in accordance with the frequent custom of sheltering a Christian saint beneath a Muslim title.” See Oswald H. Parry, Six Months in a Syrian Monastery (London, 1895, rpt. Gorgias Press, Piscataway, N.J., 2001), 263. Mr. Parry, a short visitor, cannot be faulted for this statement.

The mountain is rich with building materials like lime, stones, marble and common earth. 15 From the top of the mountain the onlooker enjoys a panorama of picturesque sceneries. Some are peculiar to it, while others stretch beyond. Of peculiar natural sceneries, are its enormous protruding rocks looking like high and impregnable towers. They overlook its elevations in perpendicular or in inclined position. Between them hang clusters of bushes and tiny trees jutting out of the sharply narrow crevices. Its fascinating valleys, commonly called gullies, are expansive. Of these is the steep valley known as Wadi Jahannam (Gehenna’s Valley) of utmost beauty and charm for its countless colorful rocks, glorious breeze and variety of flowers in addition to the thick bushes and herbage. 16 Of the picturesque scenes seen from every direction are the mountains of Ba’shiqa and Bartulli (Mar Daniel or ‘Ayn al-Safra’ mountain), and the series of the Sinjar Mountains with their snow covered tops in both winter and summer. In the far horizon, lies the city of Mosul, the historical ruins of Nineveh, the several gullies and villages, the Tigris river, the Greater Zab, the-Khazer, and the Gomul rivers, and the boundless plains of Mosul clothed in the spring with a gorgeous green attire. At night, Mosul appears a blaze of light as seen by a plane soaring over its sky. In the fall, the city’s sky is clear and free from summer sand storms The mountain’s elevations, trails, gorges, precipices and charming curvatures, teem with oak trees, terebinth, zu’rur (Cataegus azarolus), figs, grapes, pears, cherries, pomegranates and sumac. .The mountain abounds with various plants and shrubs from which natives of the neighboring villagers extract medicine to treat soars, boils, bellyache and heart and eye diseases. The mountain abounds with thyme, mint, absinthe, hyssop, marshmallow (Althaea Officinalis), mustard, clover, samarma (a kind of tea), chicory, chamomile, melilot and woodworm.\n\n15\n\nSee the report of the Establishing Association of the Resorts of the Mountain of Mar Matta (Mosul, 1946). 16 I have personally been through this valley. It deserves more the name of Wadi Paradise (Paradise Valley) than Gehenna Valley. TRANS.\n\n8\n\nHISTORY OF ST.

The narcissus, red anemones, iris and lilies, stand haughtily flirting their coquetry while the drops of dew on their surface produce a shimmer pleasing to the eye and comfort to the mind. The autumn, too, adorns its elevations and gorges with beautiful flowers. As to oleander, its blossoms in both summer and fall. Water in the mountain’s gorges meanders between the papyrus, reeds, oleander and bushes. How enchanting is the chirping of nightingales and flocks of sparrows which inhabit the mountain!\n\nCHAPTER THREE: THE LOCATION OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY Thirty five kilometers north-east of Mosul, the ancient and glorious St Matthew’s Monastery perches like a lion on a peak of the high al-Faf mountain. It overlooks the ruins of Nineveh and the boundless plains of Mosul along the banks of the Tigris river (one of the rivers of the Garden of Eden), and the mountains and mounds of the city of glorious past. It appears as if it is wandering by eye to scout those far away regions in order to offer their inhabitants a profound lesson of the legacies and memories of their immortal past. From its exalted pulpit, it informs us about the law of Hamurabi (between 1728 and 1686 B.C), the might of Sargon (721–705 B.C.), the majesty of Sennacherib (705– 681 B.C.), and Ashurpanibal (626 B.C.), the tyranny of Nabuchenezzar (605–562 B.C.), the prudence of Cyrus (about 560–529), the battles of Darius (336–330 B. C.) and Alexander (56–32 B. C.), and other mighty men of the East immortalized by history. Yes, by its deep silence, the monastery still inculcates to us the chronicles of the genius of the city of Nineveh that splendorous mistress of glory whose multitudinous 17\n\nUntil World War I, the mountain was crowded with oak trees which were then, cut off. It seems from the metrical ode of Abu Nasr of Bartulli, superior of the monastery in the thirteenth century, that the gorges and curvatures of the mountain were, since its founding, crowded with trees.\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n9\n\nlegions conquered far away countries, and the magnificent Babylon drunk with the beauty of its miraculous Hanging Gardens, and how, like other kingdoms, fell off the pinnacle of glory and buried in the ashes of time Why should not it be so, since it portrays for us Chosroes I, Anusherwan (531–579 A. D.) sitting in his lofty Diwan (Palace of the Throne) receiving the gifts of the Roman Caesar, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (754–775 A. D.), the envoys of Charlemagne, the Caliph al-Mamun (786–833 A. D.) debating learned men, the grammarians of al-Kufa and Basra setting the rules and desinential inflection of grammar, and the Syrian translators and physicians translating for their Arab brethren the philosophy of the Greeks. Moreover, St. Matthew’s Monastery provides us with the chronicle of the Christian message transported from this country by caravans of missionaries or, by travelers passing through, into the farthest regions of India and China. It relates the chronicles of the great Patriarchs of Antioch and the Maphryone of the East who set foot in these countries and built few hundred churches and monasteries inhabited by thousands of monks and ascetics. By their faith, hope and devotion, they gathered the scattered Syrian faithful into a single communion. Specifically, St. Matthew’s Monastery presents to the sons of the Syrian Church the noble memories of monks and ascetics who lived in its mountain, its gorges, caves and cells, using rocks and earth their bed. They spent a great portion of the night wakeful praying and shedding tears. Their innocent souls still hover without seizing over the summits and gorges of the mountain. All of these matters are brought back to memory by the great St. Matthew’s Monastery with its towering mountain and gorgeous location which captivate the heart.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: THE CLIMATE OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY The mountain of St. Mathew’s Monastery is free from malaria carrying mosquito. It has two climates drastically different from each other. One, is the climate of its open roof which differs from that of its base or flat surface. The other, is the climate of the places within the mountain. Thus, the climate of the nave of the monastery’s church, the Naqut (the water-dripping grotto), the Junayna (orchard or garden) and the rooms which are untouched by the sun, is cooler than that of\n\n10\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nopen places. 18 In the spring the mountain is endowed by God with utmost beauty. St. Matthew’s Monastery perches on a peak of the mountain as has been said earlier. 19 It is 2100 feet above sea level. Its climate is dry and pleasant, and its breeze is pure. It is good for the restoration of health. In the spring, the monastery is engulfed by picturesque nature while the salubrious breeze rises from the depth of its valley filled with pleasant fragrance. In the summer, nothing could be more beautiful than its mornings and evenings as the temperature fluctuates between 25 and 30 Celsius. At the mountain’s surface and summits the temperature average is 21 Celsius. 20 For this reason, many people from the cities and villages of Iraq rush to it to seek comfort during the hot summer months. The monastery’s water is refreshing. It is pumped from the Junayna to the east part of the monastery with a capacity of 80 cubic meters a day. It is stored in a large cistern located at the upper part of the monastery and distributed through pipes to the rooms. Another source of water, west of the monastery, is called al-Naqut. It is a large cave from whose ceiling water drips. In addition, there is a large cistern with the capacity of 2420 cubic meters for storing rain water.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: ST. MATTHEW’S LIFE STORY Before discussing St. Matthew’s life story, we would like to say a word about the source we have used. The copy containing St. Matthew’s life story was, undoubtedly, written in classical Syriac by a monk from the monastery in the seventh century. 21 This, however, does not mean that 18\n\nSee the Report of the Establishing Association of the Resorts of St. Matthew’s Mountain (Mosul, 1946). 19 Oswald Parry says that the Monastery was “clinging like a swallow’s nest against a wall.” See Oswald Parry, Six Months in a Syrian Monastery, 266. TRANS. 20 The Report of the Establishing Association of the Resorts of the Mountain of St. Matthew’s Monastery. 21 The first to translate St. Matthew’s life story based on this sevencentury Syriac source, was the monk Elias Behnam (d. 1941). His booklet entitled Qissat al-Qiddis Mar Matta (The Life-Story of St. Matthew), was first\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n11\n\nthere was no other story of St. Matthew prior to this century. It is unlikely that a monk of this monastery, which housed thousands of monks in the fifth century, did not write down the life story of this saint who founded it. Indeed, there must have been a need to write down his life story in order to leave a remarkable legacy of asceticism, piety and perfection for future generations. It is also probable that the manuscript containing St. Matthew’s life story was destroyed, with other manuscripts, by the wicked Barsoum of Nisibin who set the monastery on fire in 480 A. D. Some meddlesome copyists, however, interpolated in the surviving St. Matthew’s life story unhistorical information. 22 This includes that St. Matthew died in 622 of the Greeks /311 A.D, while he passed away in the second half of the fourth century, or the beginning of the next, most likely in 411 A.D. This is corroborated by a date inscribed on the wall of the Church of Mar Behnam in Jazirat ibn ‘Umar indicating that Mar Behnam was martyred in 382 A.D. It is well known that Mar Behnam was martyred because of his conversion to Christianity by St. Matthew. The interpolated copy also says that at the funeral of St. Matthew the clergy chanted the manitho (hymn) of Mar Severus of Antioch 23 despite that Mar Severus died in 538, quarter of a century after the time of St. Matthew. Moreover, the copy mentions that Emperor Julian the Apostate persecuted the monks of Amid because of the definition of faith by the Council of Chalcedon (451 A. D.), whereas St. Matthew lived more than fifty years before this council, and that the one who persecuted the monks of Amid because of Chalcedon, was the Chalcedonian Emperor Justin (d. 518) and not the heathen Emperor Julian (reigned 361–363). published by Umm al-Rabi’ayn Press: Mosul, 1938, rpt., Baghdad: Mu’in Mahfouz Press, 2004. It is astonishing that the author, Patriarch Jacob III, failed to mention him or his booklet in a footnote or the bibliography. TRANS. 22 See Elias Behnam, Qissat al-Qiddid Mar Matta, 1. TRANS. 23 This hymn of Mar Severus of Antioch which begins thus, “I glorify you the King and the Only Son and Word of the Heavenly Father, etc.” is chanted by the Syrian Church at the beginning of the celebration of the Holy Eucharist until this day. TRANS.\n\n12\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nCHAPTER SIX: ST. MATTHEW: THE SYRIAN ASCETIC St. Matthew was born to a wealthy and pious family in the village of Abjershat north of Diyarbakr (modern Turkey) in the first quarter of the fourth century. He had two sisters and a brother named Zachariah. While still young, his father passed away and he entered the Monastery of Mar Sergius and Bakus in the neighborhood of his village. He spent seven years at this monastery studying the Psalms and other parts of the Scripture. The monastery was small and inhabited only by five monks and a pious ascetic superior. St. Matthew left for the Monastery of Zuqnin known, then, for excellent discipline, its famous library and learned teaching staff. 24 After acquiring a good portion of knowledge, he left the monastery and wandered through the lands hoping to find venerable ascetics with whom he could share living. He came upon four monks living near a water fountain and stayed ten days with them. Having admired their way of life he decided to remain in their company. The monks renovated an old dilapidated hut for him to live in. Then came the persecution of monks by Emperor Julian the Apostate (361–363). St. Matthew and several of his companions left and settled on the bank of the Khabur river where they built a small monastery. Soon they departed to the Eastern country (present day Iraq). They were twenty five monks, most famous of whom following St. Matthew, were Mar Z’ura, Mar Sergius, Mar Hananya, Mar Nisa, Mar Zakai, Mar Abrohom, Mar Daniel, Mar Barsoum and Mar Saba of Thella. St. Matthew, Mar Zakai and Mar Abrohom settled with other ascetics in al-Faf mountain where they built huts. They also built a monastery where they met and celebrated the Holy Eucharist. 25 God honored St. Matthew with miracles and healing the sick. He was sought by patients afflicted with different diseases. As his healing power spread far and wide, the faithful flocked to his abode in the mountain for blessing and healing. Meantime, his virtuous mother entered a convent to spend her last days. His sisters and his brother Zachariah remained in the world. Zachariah married and had two daughters who, following their mother’s death, entered a convent. 24 25\n\nBehnam, Ibid., 5. TRANS. Behnam, 9–10. TRANS.\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN: ST. MATTHEW PROSELYTIZES PRINCE BEHNAM AND HIS SISTER, PRINCESS SARAH In the fourth century, the Persian kingdom was divided into several provinces 26 ruled by a governor 27 appointed by the Persian King of Kings. One of these satrapies was Athur 28 whose seat of government was the city of Nimrod. In the middle of the fourth century, the satrap of the Persian King Shapur was Sennacherib, called by Emperor Julian the Apostate in his letter to St. Basilius the Great, “the grandson of Darius.” 29 One day Sennacherib’s son, Behnam, went on a hunting trip with forty mounted companions. Far away, they spotted a big stag 30 which they chased to the foot of the mountain. But the stag fled into the caverns of the mountain where St. Matthew lived and could not be seen. Tired of the chase, Behnam and his companion rested for the evening at a water spring. 31 At night an angel appeared to Behnam saying that the Lord of Heaven had chosen him one of his own, and that he should climb the mountain to meet a saint named Matthew whom God has endowed with miracles who will guide him to the right path. In the morning, Behnam related the dream to his companions who climbed the mountain and were led to the cave where St. Matthew lived. St. Matthew was motivated by the Holy Spirit to receive them. He preached to them the word of life (the Gospel) and accompanied them to their city to heal Behnam’s sister Sarah who was inflicted with leprosy. Behnam left some of his companions with St. Matthew, entered the city and went up to his father’s home. He told his mother of the dream and she responded by asking him to take his sister to St. Matthew. The saint prayed and struck the ground with his staff and immediately a spring of water gushed forth. He baptized Sarah and she 26\n\nSatrapies. TRANS. Called satrap.

He also baptized Behnam and his companions and returned to his cell in the mountain. Behnam and his companions returned to the city having been converted to the true faith (Christianity). Although Sarah was healed, her father found it difficult to accept the conversion of his son and daughter to Christianity. He rebuked them and threatened to punish them if they did not recant, but to no avail. When they left his presence, Behnam called his forty companions and urged them to meet with St. Matthew for more counsel. Meantime, he and his sister fled the city. Someone informed Sennacherib that his children have rebelled against him, and together with his son’s companions, fled the city. Outraged, Sennacherib ordered that all of them should be killed. Chasing after them, his men found them at a mound and slaughtered them. As they were about to cremate their bodies, the ground cleft and swallowed them. 32 Shortly afterwards, the queen built a dome over this place known as the Pit’s Dome as shall be seen shortly. An inscription on the wall of the Church of Behnam in Jazirat ibn ‘Umar denotes that Mar Behnam was martyred in 382 A.D. 33\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY Following the tragic death of Prince Behnam, Princess Sara and Behnam’s companions, Senacherib was touched by Satan and was inflicted with a noxious disease. The angel of God appeared to his wife in a dream promising that if she believed in the Lord Christ her husband would be healed. She took Sennacherib to the place where the martyrs were slaughtered. At night, her son Behnam appeared to her in a dream begging her to summon the man of God and teacher of truth, St. Matthew, who was residing in the mountain and he would heal the king provided that she and her husband believed in Christ. Sennach32\n\nThe place is believed to be the one the Syrian villagers of Bartulli and Qaraqosh call “Dakdakitha,” a colloquial Syriac term meaning reverberation because those who walk over it hear a resonance of the ground. 33 The whole story is detailed in Behnam, Ibid., 12–21\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n15\n\nerib’s wife summoned St. Matthew who stood in her presence with five monks and exorcized the devil from the king. When the king regained sanity he believed in the message of St. Matthew and was baptized with a host of soldiers and citizens of his city. Moreover, a great number of sick people flocked to St. Matthew to be healed. When the king offered St. Matthew money, the saint refused to take it but requested him to build a church and a monastery in the mountain where he resided saying that a great number of monks would join him. The king agreed and built a great monastery and a church. He even had cisterns dug to store winter water. The capacity of one of these cisterns was 2420 cubic meters. He also built a strong wall around the monastery and opened a path leading to it which is still used by visitors to this day. It is known as Tappeke, a colloquial Syriac term for Tboyo or Tboyotho, meaning “Ascent.” From the monastery, the path looks serpentine because of its many windings. The highest part of it is 2100 feet above sea level. Sennacherib spent commendable efforts in building it. 34 Most likely, the boundaries of the monastery extended eastward to the Junayna (garden), westward to the Outer Beit Qadishe (the Outer House or Burial of Saints), northward to the mountain’s elevation and southward to the longest winding of the path. The domes of the altar and the Beit Qadishe (The House or Burial of Saints) within the church are still intact. The cave or cell overlooking the Junayna where St. Matthew lived is also still intact and often visited by people. It contains an altar hewn in rock. Probably, this cell which lay within the wall of the monastery was built by Sennacherib. Many Syrian believers of the Nineveh district donated money and labor for the building of the monastery’s church. Similar donations were made by people from far off countries. 35 In the course of building the church, a young man age fourteen, fell under a big rock rolled off a cart. It is said that the cart’s wheels also rolled over him and he was thought to be dead. But he was not harmed because of the supplication of St. Matthew.

A third boy fell down from the top of the church to the ground and was not harmed. 36\n\nCHAPTER NINE: ST. MATTHEW’S COMPANIONS As previously said, St. Matthew journeyed to the East with twenty four monks, the names of the most prominent of them have been already mentioned. 37 We also learn from St. Matthew’s life story that of these companions, Mar Z’ura, went to Baremman 38, Mar Sergius to Balad, Mar Saba to Beth Tella and Mar Daniel to the mountain which bears his name. In 570 A.D., the Catholicos of the East, Mar Ahudemeh, built a monastery in the Barren Mountain (the Mountain of Sinjar in north Iraq) named after Mar Z’ura and Mar Sergius. Each of Mar Zakai, Mar Abrohom and Mar Daniel built a monastery bearing his own name.\n\nSAINT MAR ZAKAI Mar Zakai first lived in a small cell hewn of rock overlooking the grotto of al-Naqut (The cave of dripping water). It still exists. Then, he built a hermitage at the base of al-Faf’s mountain in the deep valley known today as Wadi Mar Abrohom (Mar Abrohom’s Valley) located in the northern part of the mountain. People still live in this valley. Unexpectedly however, the monastery fell into the hands of the Yezidids 39 who converted it into a shrine of their own faith. Upon visiting it, one may deduce that its dome was built late in the fourth century similar to that of the Beit Qadishe at St. Matthew’s Monastery. Next to the ruins of the hermitage is a village called “Muhammad Rashad.” Following St. Matthew’s death, Mar Zakai succeeded him as superior of the monastery. In his time the queen, mother of the martyr 36\n\nThe Life-Stories of St. Matthew and Mar Behnam, ed. Paul Bedjan. See also Behnam, Ibid., 22.

The work hardly commenced when her son appeared to her in a dream advising her to contact the saints who were residing in the mountain and choose for the work those worthy to handle the martyrs’ remains. Since Mar Zakai was busy with the management of the monastery and could not carry out this great project alone, he asked Mar Abrohom and two companions to undertake the work with the cooperation of the queen. He returned to St. Matthew’s Monastery leaving the two monks in charge of the monastery’s visitors. Meantime, a believing Persian named Ishaq (Isaac) visited the monastery with his slave who had been touched by a demon. When the slave was healed 40 Ishaq offered to build a church and a few rooms around the Pit’s Dome. The monks informed Mar Zakai of the miracle and of Ishaq’s offer. Mar Zakai asked Mar Abrohom to undertake the new project which he performed with great competence as shall be seen later. Before returning to the monastery, Mar Zakai passed away and was buried in a private tomb next to that of St. Matthew.\n\nMAR ABROHOM This saint helped Mar Zakai in the administration of the Monastery of St. Matthew. Mar Zakai commissioned him the building of the Pit’s Dome in collaboration with the queen, Mar Behnam’s mother, as said above. Mar Zakai with two monk companions presented himself to the queen who honored him. She summoned experts and proceeded to the place of the remains of the martyrs. As they offered prayers, Mar Abrohom saw a light shining out of the entrance of the cavity where the remains were laid. He also smelled a pleasant aroma rising out of the place. He descended the cavity with the queen and the companions and found the martyrs lined up beside each other except Mar Behnam and his sister Sarah who were separate from the rest. The queen touched the bodies of her beloved children for a blessing. Then, Mar Abrohom built a small temple, or dome, over the remains of the martyrs. He placed the bodies of Mar Behnam and Sarah in marble urns 40\n\nMost likely by Mar Behnam. TRANS.\n\n18\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nmade ready by the queen and kept in the eastern wall of the cistern. Upon bidding the queen farewell, she offered him money but he refused to take it. Finally, he yielded to her insistence to have him build another church for monks in the mountain to perpetuate her memory. Accepting her gift of money, Mar Abrohom set off to St. Matthew’s Monastery leaving behind the two monks at the Pit’s Dome to care for the visitors. At a place known then as Kokhyotho located in a gorgeous valley in the northern part of al-Faf’s mountain, he built a beautiful church and a monastery known until today by his name. 41 Later, Mar Zakai commissioned Mar Abrohom with another undertaking. This time it was the building of rooms around the Pit’s Dome for visitors in response to the desire of the Persian believer (Ishaq) as said above. Taking a few monks with him, Mar Abrohom proceeded to the Pit’s Dome. After listening to the believing Persian, he offered him spiritual advice, especially since Mar Abrohom was well versed in the Scripture. On the next day, he sent a word to the queen informing her of the intention of the believing Persian Ishaq and begged her for support. She wrote back of her full support and donation of a great amount of money for the project while knowing that he was not in need of it. As Mar Abrohom proceeded to build a temple above the opening of the cistern, Mar Behnam appeared to him in dream advising him to build the temple some distance from the cistern. Heeding Mar Behnam’s advice, Mar Abrohom built the temple surrounded by a wall. Also, he built rooms for the sick. When the project was completed, Mar Abrohom transferred the remains of the martyrs Mar Behnam and Sarah to the new temple. He left the remains of the forty companions in the Pit. Hence, the place was called the Pit’s Monastery. After Mar Zakai passed away, Mar Abrohom returned to al-Faf’s mountain invited by the elderly monks of St.Matthew’s Monastery to become their superior. He held this position until his death. 42 41\n\nThe walls of Mar Abrohom’s Monastery still stand but the roofs have fallen to the ground.

The ruins of the monastery could still be seen.\n\nCHAPTER TEN: THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MAR BEHNAM’S MONASTERY At the beginning, this monastery was a shrine visited by the sick for healing. Not until the twelve century did it become a genuine monastery by the effort of Syrian Orthodox monks from St. Matthew’s Monastery. Since then, it came to be mentioned by the history of the Syrian Orthodox Church of the East. It was among the monasteries in the district of Nineveh under the jurisdiction of St. Matthew’s Monastery. Since its establishment up to1893, this monastery was Syrian Orthodox. Its superiors, the maphryone and metropolitans buried in it, were Syrian Orthodox. Indeed, The Book of Life, church calendars and the manuscripts which contain Mar Behnam’s life story, or mention of him, whether in the East or in the West, were Syrian Orthodox. Moreover, all those who composed metrical odes or wrote husoyos (supplicatory prayers) and panegyrics in his praise, or arranged divine services for his festival like Abu Nasr of Bartulli, Patriarch Behnam of Hidl and others, where Syrian Orthodox. In fact, prominent writers like Abu Nasr of Bartulli and Patriarch Behnam of Hidl, who composed odes, panegerics and husoyos (supplicatory prayers) praising Mar Behnam, or those who were named after him, were Syrian Orthodox. Moreover, the digitaries who founded churches and monasteries in Tripoli, Egypt, Arbil, Mardin, Damascas and Jerusalem in his name were Syrian Orthodox. 43 43\n\nIn 1951, the learned Syrian Catholic Chorepiscopus Aphram ‘Abdal wrote a book containing available chronicles about the venerable Mar Behnam. But he preferred to use the term “Syrian” exclusively for his own Syrian Catholic Church which, now, owns this monastery. Indeed, by the term “Syrian” ‘Abdal meant our Syrian Orthodox Church and not his denomination known today in Iraq as Syrian Catholic. Strangely, he did not call anyone of our saints as “Mar,” a Syriac term meaning Saint. In fact, in the\n\n20\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nThe evidence that Mar Behnam’s Monastery belongs to the Syrian Orthodox Church is as follows. First, there is absolutely no mention of this monastery in the calendars of the Syrian Catholic Church. Second, the attempt of Joseph Qudsi, the Syrian Catholic Metropolitan of Jerusalem, to change the festival of Mar Behnam into only a commemoration on April, 25 1776. Third, the attempt of the Syrian Catholic metropolitan Joseph Dawud to change the name of the church of Mar Behnam in Damascus to that of St. Paul (sic). 44 Certainly, the martyr Mar Behnam belongs exclusively to our Syrian Orthodox Church. Indeed, when in 1839, the schismatic Syrian Catholic Church usurped Mar Behnam’s Monastery, it continued to honor the saint following the tradition of its mother Syrian Orthodox Church. Moreover, the Chorepiscopus Aphram ‘Abdal admitted implicitly that Mar Behnam’s Monastery belonged to us (Syrian Orthodox) prior to 1839. He cited a statement of the Danish traveler Carsten Niebhur who wrote in 1776, “I visited in the company of some Christians a monastery of the Jacobites (sic) a distance of six hours near the village of Qaraqosh. 45 By the term Jacobites, Niebhur meant the Syrian Orthodox. The epithet of Jacobites was applied to the Syrian Orthodox by their opponents for sheer bigotry. What proves that Mar Behnam’s Monastery belonged to us Syrian Orthodox, is a statement of Rev.\n\ncopy transcribed in 1917 by the monk Joseph, now at London’s Library, he deleted the term “Mar” with the result that Mar Barsoum’s Monastery became Barsoum’s Monastery. See Aphram ‘Abdal, Tarikh Mar Behnam al-Shahid (History of the Martyr Mar Behnam), p. 37. ‘Abdal applied the term “Mar” to the Nestorian saints calling Yuhanna of Daylam as “Mar Yuhanna of Daylam,” and Isaac of Nineveh as “Mar Isaac of Nineveh.” Furthermore, when Patriarch (Aphram) Rahmani, (a Syrian Catholic), mentioned these churches, he said, “Our great church in Damascus,” and “Our great church built by the Christians of Tripoli,” or “The churches built in Mardin, Jazirat ibn ‘Umar and Egypt.” Obviously, Rahmani found it offensive to admit the excellence of the Syrian Orthodox people who built these churches. So, he said “they were built by Christians.” See Majallat al-Athar al-Sharqiyya, 3, 39. 44 Aphram ‘Abdal, Tarikh Mar Behnam al-Shahid, 32 and 47. 45 ‘Abdal, p. 118.\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n21\n\n‘Abdal that in the latter part of the fifth century, the Christian East was divided into two groups, the Nestorians and the Monophysites. 46\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN: MAR DANIEL BUILDS HIS MONASTERY Mar Daniel is one of the ascetic companions of St. Matthew. He built a monastery in the mountain near the village of Bartulli known as Mar Daniel’s Monastery. Today, the mountain is known as Jabal ‘Ayn alSafra (Yellow Spring Mountain). Mar Daniel’s Monastery was built on top of the mountain in a beautiful spot in the latter part of the fourth century. From all directions, it overlooks the vast plains of Nineveh, Mosul and Marga. It was attended by many monks, and, for more than ten centauries, remained an abode of asceticism and devotion. In church history it is called Upper Mar Daniel’s Monastery because there was another monastery below known as Lower Mar Daniel’s Monastery, a convent for nuns. 47 In the Middle Ages, the monastery was known as Dayr alKhanafis “The Beetles’ Monastery.” By this same name, too, it was mentioned by al-Khalidi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. In the middle of the thirteenth century, the learned Bar Hebraeus referred to it by this name. 48 Yaqut al-Hamawi, quoting al-\n\n46\n\n‘Abdal, Ibid., p. 57. The translator would like to add the following. Mar Ignatius Aphram Barsoum I, Syrian Patriarch of Antioch and all the East (d. 1957), says that “The Monastery of Mar Behnam the martyr, known as the Jubb Monastery (The Pit’s Monastery) near the village of Qaraqosh, was built in the latter part of the fourth century. It became an Episcopal Seat in the sixteenth century until the faction which seceded from the Syrian Church usurped it in 1839. See Patriarch Aphram Barsoum, “Lum’a fi Tarikh alUmma al-Suryaniyya fi al-Iraq” (A Glimpse of the History of the Syrian Nation in Iraq), al-Majalla al-Patriarchiyya (The Patriarchal Magazine), nos. 7 and 8, 3 (Jerusalem, 1936): 202.

See Bar Hebraeus, The Chronography of Abu’l Faraj Bar Hebreaeus, ed.\n\n22\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nKhalidi, calls it Dayr al-Khanafis (The Beetles’ Monastery). Al-Khalidi says that this monastery lies to the west of the Tigris river. It is built on top of a high mountain. It is a small monastery inhabited only by two monks (sic). It is enjoyable because it stands high above the surrounding villages and overlooks the rivers of Nineveh and Marj. Villagers journey to it once a year to celebrate its festival. A mysterious phenomenon about this monastery is that each year for three days its walls and roofs become blackened by tiny beetles creeping like ants. When these days draw near, the monks take out the furniture, food and other stuff to protect them from the beetles. When the three days are over, they were returned to their former places in the monastery. I say this because I have seen so many people relate this phenomenon. I know of no one in those regions who denies it. However, God knows best. 49 Al-Khalidi’s saying that Mar Daniel’s Monastery is small and was inhabited by no more than two monks, is open to question. In 1261, a quarter of a century after the time of Yaqut al-Hamawi, the faithful Syrians of Basekhraye and other villages in the district of Nineveh, fled to this monastery for refuge because of lack of safety in the district and Mosul. 50 At the end of the thirteenth century Maphryono Barsoum alSafi 51 and his retinue stayed in it for sometime. Also, at this monastery al-Safi received a delegation from Patriarch Ignatius V, Bar Wuhayb carrying a letter to Mansur, lord of Mardin. 52 Indeed, its ruins which still stand show that it was a large monastery. Moreover, the cistern, hewn in rock on its western side, is too large. As to the phenomenon of beetles, these creatures still appear on its walls during its festival on October 20 during the prayer of the tishmesht chanted at the close of the Mass. They may look dainty but are rather strange creatures. Mar Daniel’s Monastery possessed considerable endowment lands, fields, vineyards, and plantations on its eastern, western and northern Ernest A.

Their boundaries are still marked. Since the fourteenth century, however, its chronicles have been obscured. Even after it fell into ruins, the Syrians of the Bartulli, both clergy and laity, kept attending it to celebrate the Holy Eucharist at the festival of Mar Daniel. This tradition is observed to this day.\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE: MAR DANIEL’S MONASTERY IN THE IRAQI COURTS The schismatic Syrians of Mosul led by their Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal, challenged the established right of the Syrians of Bartulli to this monastery and its properties. Through the leadership of their venerable Chorepiscopus Elias Sha’ya, the Syrians of Bartulli opposed them and gained a verdict from the Iraqi Court of Cassation in Baghdad dated 12/22/1948, resolving that the Monastery (of Mar Daniel) is an endowment of the Syrian Orthodox Church of Bartulli. On the strength of this verdict, the properties of the monastery were recorded in the government registers. Following is a copy of the court’s verdict: Presidency of the Iraqi Court of Cassation- Baghdad No. 287/Cassation Case/1948 The Iraqi Court of Cassation came into session on 12/22/1948 by the following judges: Hasan Rida, Mustafa al-Ankali and ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Khayyat, who are authorized to judge in the name of His Majesty the King of Iraq, and issued the following verdict: The Plaintiff, Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal, in his capacity as the administrator of the endowment properties of the Syrian Catholics. The Defendants, the Chorepiscopus Elias Sha’ya and the Minister of Finance in relation to his office. On 11/18/1946, the President of the Sixth Committee of Lands Survey of Mosul, issued a decision to the effect that the piece of land No. (1) of district 113 of the Mountain of ‘Ayn al-Safra, is a governmental land registered in the Tapo (Recorder of Deeds), under the jurisdiction of the Waqf, endowment lands, of the Syrian Orthodox denomination. Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal, appealed the decision of the Sixth Committee of Lands Survey in Mosul demanding that the said decision of the Appellate Court be rescinded and the said piece of land be considered a property of the Syrian Catholic denomination, and\n\n24\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nthat the defendants should bear the court fees. Likewise, the Ministry of Finance appealed the case No. 8/48 against the defendant, the Chorepiscopus Elias Sha’ya, and against the said piece of land. After combining case No. 8/47 and case No. 84/47 on 29/4/1947 in one case under No. 47/84, the Appellate Court of Lands Survey issued a contradictory decision against the defendants, the Ministry of Finance and the Chorepiscopus Elias Sha’ya, and in absentia, against the plaintiff, Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal, rejecting the appeal of Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal against the Chorepisocpus Elias Sha’ya and the Ministry of Finance and the appeal of the Ministry of Finance against the Chorepiscopus Elias Sha’ya. It ratified the appealed decision for its conformity with the law. On 5/31/1947 Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal appealed the case to the Iraqi Court of Cassation asking that the decision of the Appellate Court of Lands Survey be reconsidered and then rescinded. The Court of Cassation issued a verdict No. 120 Cassation/48, dated 2/4/48 rejecting the appealed decision and returned it to the Appellate Court to consider it more carefully because the appealed decision seemed incorrect. The Court of Cassation reasoned that the Appellate Court has confirmed the decision of the President of the Committee of Lands Survey regarding the piece of land No. (1) of the district No.113, under discussion, as a government land charged, according to the Recorder of Deeds, to Mar Daniel’s Monastery, while the decision of the President of the Committee of Lands Survey was only connected with the monastery’s land tax, and considered it a bona fide charitable land endowment not as the Appellate Court said in its decision that it forms a part of the monastery’s ruins. This, the Court of Cassation reasoned, is a legal error which affects the legality of the appealed decision. Thus, it decided to return the case to the Appellate Court for reconsideration. The Appellate Court of Lands Survey of Mosul reconsidered the case. Following the resolution of the Court of Cassation, the Appellate Court issued a contradictory decision No. 84/47, dated 9/27/1947 against the plaintiff, Metropolitan Jirjis Dalllal, and in absentia against the Minister of Finance, confirming the resolution of the President of the Committee of Lands Survey that the piece of land No. (1) of the district No. 113 is a part of the ruins of the Monastery of Mar Daniel which belongs to the Syrian Orthodox denomination, and that it should be registered in the name of the said denomination as a charita-\n\nBOOK ONE\n\n25\n\nble endowed land characterized as a genuine endowment of this denomination, not like other endowment property usually associated with family heirs. The court further rejected the appeal and charged the plaintiffs with bearing court fees. Still not convinced with the last verdict of the Appellate Court, Metropolitan Jirjis Dallal asked that it should be reconsidered by the Court of Cassation claiming that, in the past, his denomination and that of the Syrian Orthodox were one denomination called Syrian, but then split into two. This division caused a great deal of conflict and litigation concerning the possessions and properties of these churches. Finally, the case was settled by the Court of Cassation in its decision No. 508, dated September 15, 1926 which contained the general principle of settling the conflict between the two denominations. Dallal contended that despite the referral of this decision to the Committee of Land Survey, the committee overlooked it and also overlooked the decision of the Appellate Court. His appeal was dated 10/17/1948. After further scrutiny and deliberation, it appeared that the piece of land, under litigation, is a veritable endowment property belonging to the defendant, the Syrian Orthodox denomination on which it celebrated religious ceremonies, and that it was its possession since ancient times. Thus, the appealed decision (of the Appellate Court) is in conformity with the law, and the objections of the plaintiffs (Dallal) are invalid. Therefore, it is resolved to dismiss these objections, and ratify the said decision (of the Appellate Court) and charge the plaintiffs court fees. Issued on December 22, 1948. 53\n\n53\n\nOn a wall of this monastery could still be seen a Syriac inscription in the Istrangelo script indicating that its founder was Mar Daniel. See Majallat al-Athar al-Sharqiyya, 3, 11.\n\nBOOK TWO: ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY IN THE FIFTH AND SIXTH CENTURIES CHAPTER ONE: THE GOLDEN AGE OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY The period between 400 and 480 A.D., is considered the golden age of St. Matthew’s Monastery. In it its goals and discipline it reached perfection. From time to time, St. Matthew visited the monks who were scattered over the caves and gorges of the mountain, preaching, healing, encouraging and advising them to shun temptations. Also, he inculcated them love and true faith urging them to produce good fruits and lift up their minds to the highest heaven. 54 Abu Nasr of Bartulli praised the excellent traits of St. Matthew especially his serenity, meekness, sound judgment, chastity, kindness, purity, sanctity, courage, pleasant communication, long vigils, devotion, incessant thankfulness, love, happy mien and desire to make others feel comfortable. 55 Upon his death in late fourth or early fifth centuries, St. Matthew was succeeded by his friend Mar Zakai as a superior of his monastery. Other venerable superiors followed who raised high the banner of devotion. Their chronicles, however, were effaced because of the calamity which afflicted the monastery by the Nestorian Barsoum of Nisibin in 480 A.D., as shall be seen shortly. Be that as it may, we are able to determine that thousands of seekers of piety and ascetic life flocked to this monastery in this golden period. They followed the same path of St. Matthew and attained the highest degree of virtue. They excelled in religious sciences, spiritual philosophy and knowledge derived from 54\n\nSee Abu Nasr of Bartulli’s metrical ode on St. Matthew. Abu Nasr of Bartulli, Ibid., and Behnam, Qissat al-Qiddis St. Matthew (The Life-Story of St. Matthew), 2. TRANS. 55\n\n27\n\n28\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nthe manuscripts stacked up in the monastery’s library. Church history avers that the number of these ascetics exceeded seven thousand in this golden age. 56 Thus, the monastery’s reputation resonated throughout the lands and the monastery became chief of the monasteries of the East. It became also the focus of the Syrians of Iraq and Persia until the fourth quarter of this century when its sun began to set.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY AND THE PRECIPITATE NESTORIAN STORM In the first half of the fifth century, the Nestorian heresy maintaining two persons and natures in the Lord Christ after their ineffable union, that the Virgin Mary was not the Mother of God, and the Lord Christ who was crucified and died was a mere man since, at the crucifixion, his divinity separated from his humanity, disturbed the entire church. The First Council of Ephesus met in 431 A. D., and condemned Nestorius and his heresy. However, Nestorius was supported by a number of bishops from Syria and by the majority of professors of the School of Edessa, especially Barsoum Bishop of Nisibin, who expended considerable effort in propagating Nestorius’s heresy. About 480, Barsoum found opportunity to chastize the believers of Persia. He slandered them to the Persian King Phiruz as spies in his country for the Roman (Byzantine) kingdom. He also informed Phiruz that he will not have peace until they sever their relations with the Christian Byzantines. Accordingly, Phiruz had the Catholicos Baboyeh crucified. He furnished Barsoum with a contingent of soldiers to march throughout Iraq and the entire Persian kingdom punishing the believers who did not accept his Nestorian heresy. Upon his arrival in Arbil (in northern Iraq), its bishop fled as did other bishops who fled to the Jazira or to Armenia Then, Barsoum attacked St. Matthew’s Monastery whose monks fled to hide in the gorges and caverns of the mountain. St. Bar Sohde, metropolitan of the monastery and the district of Nineveh, together with twelve monks, could not escape and fell into Barsoum’s 56\n\nThe life-story of St. Matthew still in manuscript form, and the life-story of Mar Behnam in Bedjan, Acra Martyrum et Sactorum, 2 (Leipzig, 1981), and the metrical ode of Abu Nasr of Bartulli.\n\nBOOK TWO\n\n29\n\nhands. Barsoum set the monastery on fire which consumed its church vessels, furniture and, mostly, its precious library. He drove his victims to Nisibin and detained them in the house of a Jewish man. He returned to the district of Nineveh and killed at the Monastery of Bezanitha (modern village of Bahzani north of Mosul), ninety priests. The number of those he killed was 7300 souls. 57 Upon returning to Nisibin, Barsoum promised to instal Bar Sohde a chief metropolitan of the East if he subscribed to his idea (heresy). Bar Sohde refused, and Barsoum had him stoned and the monks crucified. The aforementioned Jew converted to Christianity by a miracle which God wrought by Bar Sohde who healed and baptized his son. The body of the martyr Bar Sohde was transported to the district of Nineveh and buried first in the Monastery of Bezanitha according to his instructions. 58 It was then moved to St. Matthew’s Monastery and interned next to St. Matthew’s tomb. In 499, several monks returned to St. Matthew’s Monastery and issued twenty two canons whose original copy still existed in Bar Hebraeus’s time (thirteenth century). 59\n\nCHAPTER THREE: THE CHURCH OF THE EAST IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NESTORIAN STORM Unboundedly, the Nestorian storm sapped the energy of the Orthodox Church of the East. It almost obliterated it if it were not for God who provided men to salvage it by their blood. Although the Nestorians controlled most of the dioceses in Iraq and Persia, still a good number held on to the orthodox faith with avid tenacity. Of these, were Takrit and Armenia from which the tyrant Barsoum of Nisibin turned away discomfited. When the storm abated, this afflicted church rose to action to gather up its scattered sons and dress its fatal wounds.\n\n57\n\nSee the letter of Mar Marutha of Takrit to Patriarch John of the Sedros in Michael Rabo (the Syrian), Chronicle, 2: 427, and Bar Hebreaus, Ecclesiastical History, 3: 63–71. 58 See the letter of Mar Marutha of Takrit to Patriarch John of the Sedros in Michael Rabo (the Syrian), Chronicle, 2: 427, and Bar Hebreaus, Ecclesiastical History, 3: 63–71. 59 Bar Hebraeus, Ibid., 3: 78.\n\n30\n\nHISTORY OF ST. MATTHEW’S MONASTERY\n\nDuring this difficult time, God raised for the church an energetic clergyman, Mar Simon, nicknamed the Persian Disputant, renowned for his knowledge and zeal. He exerted considerable effort to aid the church and defeat its enemies. History tells us that Qabadh, who succeeded his father Phiruz, as the king of Persia, learned the truth about the Nestorians, and thus his hatred towards them increased. This encouraged Mar Simon to obtain a decree from Qabadh allowing him to roam the lands and encourage the faithful. He collected the seals (endorsements) of the Syrian Orthodox, the Armenians and the Greeks who did not fall into the Nestorian trap, stamped by Qabadh’s seal and deposited in Takrit. 60 Mar Simon carried the banner of the Gospel to Hirat al-Nu’man proselytizing a great number of Arabs and building a church for them. He reconverted at Ctesipon (al-Mada’in, south of Baghdad) many heretics and then journeyed to the country beyond Persia to guide the heathens and Magians to Christianity. Before 503 A.D., the bishops of the East installed him as bishop for his native Beth Arsham, a town adjacent to Seleucia. But when the Nestorians saw the church revived, they continued to slander the orthodox to Qabadh as spies of the Romans (Byzantines). Qabadh believed the Nestorians and persecuted the orthodox severely. Mar Simon journeyed to Constantinople imploring the believing Emperor Anastasius (reigned 491–518) to send an ambassador to Qabadh to stop their persecution. 61 In 511, Mar Simon wrote in Syriac a comprehensive letter about the tyrant Barsoum of Nisibin and the propagation of the Nestorian heresy in Persia and the destruction of the School of Edessa. 62 It is the 60\n\nJohn of Ephesus, Lives of the Eastern Saints, 1: 154–156. Ibid., 137–158; Severus Jacob Tuma (the author), Tarikh al-Kanis alSuryaniyya al-Antakiyya, 2 (Dar al-Kutub: Beirut, 1957): 284–285. 62 Mar Simon of Beth Arsham detailed the chronicles of Barsoum of Nisibin and the infiltration of Nestorianism into Persia, but he eschewed mentioning the persecution by Barsoum for political reasons, especially that Phiruz’s son was then on the Persian throne. Why shouldn’t he do so since the Nestorians kept slandering the orthodox as spies of the Byzantine kingdom? Indeed, the same thing was done by Mar Marutha of Takrit in the year 628 when he appeared with some Eastern bishops before Patriarch Athanasius 1, who asked him to provide them with a glimpse of Barsoum’s persecution, but 61\n\nBOOK TWO\n\n31\n\nmost authentic and veritable source of these two incidents because its author was an eyewitness. 63 The Nestorains’ slander continued. Mar Simon, the bishops and superiors of monasteries in Persia were arrested. They were detained for seven years until the ambassador of the King of Ethiopia interceded on their behalf and they were released. 64 In 530, Qabadh died and was succeeded by his son Chosroes 1, Anusherwan (531–579). In his time, between540 and 544, a great number of orthodox from Antioch and the neighboring villages of Edessa moved to Persia. Thus, the number of the orthodox in the land of the East increased. They even built a church in Seleucia. 65\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: THE CHURCH OF THE EAST AND THE LEGAL LAYING OF HANDS (ORDINATION) We have already seen that Armenia escaped faith corruption by the tyrant Barsoum of Nisibin. It remained firm in the orthodox faith and continued the lawful succession of Catholicoses. In his letter, Mar Simon of Beth Arsham mentioned that thirty three bishops from Ghurzan with their rulers and notable men, and thirty two bishops from Persian Armenia with their Marzipans were, at the time of writing this letter, orthodox who opposed the Nestorian heresy. Furthermore, in his letter to Patriarch Mar John of the Sedros, Mar Marutha of Takrit wrote that Barsoum of Nisibin moved from Ctesiphon (alMada’in) to Bajermi (Beth Garmai). Some bishops fled (for fear of him) to the Jazira and others to Armenia. When Barsoum came to Arbil (Adiabene), its bishop also fled. And when no chief priest was left in our country (modern Iraq), seven monks went to Antioch and received the laying of hands. 66 They returned to their country without publicizhe did not. However, he did provide information when Patriarch John of the Sedros wrote to him inquiring about the persecution. This, however, happened after the Arab conquest of Persia and the fall of the persecuting Persian kingdom. See Michael Rabo, Chronicle, 2: 423–424. 63 Assemani, Bibliotheca Orientalis, 1: 29. 64 John of Ephesus, Lives of the Eastern Saints, 1: 152–153. 65 Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical History, 3: 85–87. 66 Were ordained bishops.

It appears from the lifestory of Mar Simon that in his time there were in the East a number of bishops other than him. This is evident by their celebration of his ordination as bishop shortly before the year 502, and that they were imprisoned with him in Nisibin. Furthermore, five of them appeared with him, under different circumstances, in a debate called for by the Nestorian Catholicos Babai (497–503). 69 This is clear evidence that the Nestorians could not subjugate all the bishops to their authority. Through these bishops the Church of the East continued the legal laying of the hands However, four years after the death of Mar Simon of Beth Arsham in 540 at Constantinople, there was no bishop in this church except Qaris or Qaliros, bishop of Sinjar, to whom the believers flocked from all directions to receive ordination. 70 In his previously mentioned letter, Mar Marutha said, “When the wicked Barsoum (of Nisibin) died, the Armenian catholicos visited our country and revived the episcopal laying of hands. 71 The learned Bar Hebraeus informs us that this catholicos was the Syrian Mar Christophorus who at this time achieved fame for his apostolic zeal. But when he learned that some monks joined St. Matthew’s Monastery, he journeyed to it and chose one of them, Garmay, a venerable monk, and ordained him a metropolitan to succeed the martyr Bar Sohde. 72 Christophorus authorized Garmay to ordain a successor and bishops with the same authority as that of the Catholicoses of the East. 73 Christophorus, then, went to the district of Nineveh and ordained the monk 67\n\nMichael Rabo, Chronicle, 2: 426–427.

In the year 559, Mar Jacob Baradaeus, the Ecumenical Metropolitan, inspected the Church of the East, and was honored by Chosroes. He ordained Mar Ahudemeh a general metropolitan, i.e., Catholicos of the East. Mar Ahudemeh strengthened the believers and preached Christianity to the Arab tribes leading many of them to the true faith. He ordained for them priests and deacons and built churches called after the names of their tribes and leaders. He also built two monasteries, one, ‘Ayn Qunni, near Sinjar in which were deposited the relics of the martyr Saint Sergius; the other, J’atni, near Qronta, a village parallel to Takrit. He issued canons for these monasteries to promote piety. At Takrit, Mar Ahudemeh proselytized some Magians of whom was a prince from the royal family 75 and called him Jirjis (George). His action angered King Chosroes who cast Mar Ahodeme into prison and had him beheaded on Friday August 2, 575. He is considered the first Catholicos of the East since the Nestorians usurped the Catholicate Seat. Mar John of Ephesus, a contemporary of Mar Ahudemeh, said, “The orthodox installed a catholicos by the laying of the hand of the blessed Mar Jacob, bishop of the orthodox, a thing which has not happened in Persia. But it did happen and the believers had their own catholicos until this day.” 76 Mar Ahodemeh was succeeded by Mar Qam Yeshu’ in 578. 77 Qam Yeshu’ was the teacher of our new church in Seleucia.

MATTHEW’S MONASTERY AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS SPIRITUAL LIFE The scanty information about St. Matthew’s Monastery left for us by changing circumstance during this thorny period, is unsatisfactory. Yet, still it provides not a bad synopsis of the renovation of the monastery and the revival of its monastic life. The first thing which attracts our attention is the return of some monks to the monastery at the end of the fifth century as the Nestorian storm subsided. We also learn that the monks resumed former activity and issued twenty two canons affecting the monastery’s different aspects of life. When these canons, became well known in the East, the Catholicos of the Armenians Mar Christophorus, a Syrian by origin, journeyed to the monastery around 544 and restored the episcopal office by ordaining the monk Mar Garmay a successor to the martyr Bar Sohde. This indicates that the monks returned to the monastery and rebuilt it after it had been destroyed by fire (set by Barsoum of Nisibin) and resumed their usual monastic life. Although these canons are extinct, they still serve as evidence of injecting a new spiritual life into the monastery. As to the continuation of the monastery’s episcopate, it was perpetuated by the Syrian historians based on the account found in a manuscript at St. Matthew’s Monastery. 79 According to this account, “After Barsoum inflicted persecution on St. Matthew’s Monastery and set it on fire, Mar Christophorus, Catholicos of the Armenians, journeyed to the monastery and found only a small number of monks scattered like pigeons in its hallways. Discovering that the monastery’s bishops, including Bar Sohde, metropolitan of the monastery and the districts of Athur and Nineveh, had been killed along with Baboy, Christophorus chose Garmay, a 78\n\nBar Hebraeus, 3: 101 and 109. There is no credibility to Rahmani’s translation of the account he quoted from Mar Mikha’il al-Kabir (Michael Rabo), because it has no connection with the original Syriac text. See Majallat al-Akhbar al-Sharqiyya, 3: 12. 79\n\nBOOK TWO\n\n35\n\nman known for his virtue, and ordained him a metropolitan.” 80 Syrian historians also mention the consecutive bishops who occupied the Episcopal Seat of St. Matthew’s Monastery, to be mentioned in another chapter. We may deduce from this account the following: First, after setting St. Matthew’s Monastery on fire, the number of its monks dwindled compared to the thousands of monks it has accommodated in the past. Second, the reason which urged the Catholicos of the Armenians to ordain a metropolitan for the monastery was the fact that the countries of Athur and Nineveh had no bishops. It has already been said that some of these bishops were killed together with St. Baboyeh, Catholicos of the East, and Bar Sohde, while others either fled or departed to their Lord. Third, the martyr Bar Sohde was not only the metropolitan of St. Matthew’s Monastery, but also of Athur and Nineveh. 81 In other words, Bar Sohde was the Archbishop of these regions which clearly indicates that, since its golden age, the monastery enjoyed a supreme position in the Church of the East.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: ST.
