        "text": "Since the Arab world represents a highly strategic area, many foreign powers have launched their own Arabic-speaking TV channels to spread their views and outlook on major world events.\n\nIn other words, الرَّأي العـــــــام (public opinion) of Arab nations has become, more than ever, المصلحــــة القوميـــــــة (the national interest) of many powers in the world.\n\nسكـــــــاي نيـــــــوز عربيـــــــة (Sky News Arabic) is the newcomer among the Arabic-language Satellite channels who address the Arab world from “foreign skies.”\n\nRupert Murdoch, the well-known tycoon of Fox News fame and fresh shareholder of Rotana (the Arab world’s largest “entertainment company”), controls nearly half of British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), parent company of Sky News Arabic.\n\nThe co-owner of the newly-launched Arabic-speaking channel is Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, half brother of the current UAE president. He is also the owner of Manchester City Football Club, and is described by the British press as having US President Obama “on speed dial”!\n\nShortly after invading Iraq, the US pushed for Al-Hurra (in Arabic “الحُــــــرَّة“, which stands for “The Free“), the brainchild of American businessman Norman Pattiz while he was still sitting on the board of a Government information agency, the new face of the now-defunct USIA (United States Information Agency.) Today, Pattiz switched to the board of the government outfit which operates the well-known Los Alamos National Laboratory. How much Al Hurra has been effective in winning over the hearts and minds of Arab viewers is still up for debate, although a 2010 WikiLeaks cable quotes two Saudi media executives in a meeting with a US official at a Starbucks in Jeddah as saying: “The American programming on MBC and Rotana is winning over ordinary Saudis in a way that al-Hurra and other US propaganda never could.” It remains unclear, however, whether the two Saudis were referring to Desperate Housewives or the fifth season of Jersey Shore.\n\nAlthough the British government recently cut public funding to the BBC, it decided to maintain its sponsorship of BBC Arabic, in order to “continue its valuable work in the region.” This is not the first time the British government attempts to address the Arab world: It tried and failed to do so back in the mid–1990s, when it concluded a partnership with a cousin of the former Saudi King to launch an Arabic version of the BBC. However, a documentary of the parent company deemed too critical toward the ruling Saudi family brought that partnership to an abrupt end, prompting the journalists of the short-lived British channel to join what was soon to become Al Jazeera.\n\nSimilarly, France launched “France 24 Arabic.” It seems that the French desperately needed their voice to be heard in Arab lands, especially in the Maghreb region where the youth are more often than ever switching from French channels like TF1, France 2, and M6, to Arabic-speaking channels like Al Jazeera.\n\nThrough its state-owned RIA Novosti which controls the channel “روسيـــــــــــــا اليوم” (“Russiya Al Yawm“, or “Russia Today“), Russia presents its view of the world to Arab audiences. This channel has for some time hosted Al Jazeera’s former Moscow correspondent, Akram Khuzam, who subsequently left to work for the American “Al-Hurra.“\n\nVery fluent Arabic-speaking Chinese journalists for China’s CCTV Arabic\n\nCCTV Arabic broadcasts the official Chinese views—with very fluent Arabic-speaking Chinese journalists!"
