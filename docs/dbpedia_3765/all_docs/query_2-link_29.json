        "text": "Weekly Report on Israeli Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (30 December 2021 – 05 January 2022)\n\nIsraeli Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\n\n30 December 2021 – 5 January 2022\n\nIOF shoot and Kill Palestinian with mental health issues on Haris intersection, northern Salfit\n\n16 Palestinians wounded, including 5 children and 1 in critical condition, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\n\n8 IOF shootings reported against agricultural lands, and 4 against fishing boats in the Gaza Sea\n\n103 IOF incursions in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem: 78 Palestinians arrested, including 7 children\n\nDemolitions and notices in occupied East Jerusalem: 5 houses demolished, 2 of them self-demolished; 5 other establishments demolished, including a medical center; several demolition and cease-construction notices served against Palestinians in the city\n\nDemolition notices served against 8 houses, a mosque, a civilian establishment in Bethlehem; and 8 tents removed in Tubas (2 residential and 6 for cattle)\n\nSettler-attacks in the West Bank: damage includes cutting of trees and attacks on Palestinian vehicles and houses\n\nIOF established 35 temporary military checkpoints in the West Bank and arrested 1 Palestinian\n\nSummary\n\nIsraeli occupation forces (IOF) continued to commit crimes and multi-layered violations against Palestinian civilians and their properties, including raids into Palestinian cities that are characterized with excessive use of force, assault, abuse, and arrests against civilians. This week’s events witnessed an escalation in Israeli demolitions and demolition notices against Palestinian properties. Meanwhile, the Gaza Strip has entered its 15th year under occupation and closure, as Israel has continued to exercise the worst known collective punishment in human history, exacerbating humanitarian hardships across the territory.\n\nIOF shooting and violation of right to life and bodily integrity:\n\nDuring the reporting period, IOF killed a Palestinian with mental health issues and wounded 16 civilians, including 5 children, as they continue to exercise excessive use of force in the West Bank. On the 31st of December 2021, IOF killed Amir Atef Khader Rayan, a 36-year-old male with mental health issues. Rayan was killed near Haris intersection in northern Salfit, allegedly for attempting a stab attack. Filed investigations indicate that the victim was several meters away from where the Israeli soldiers stood, meaning he did not pose any form of threat to them. This crime reflects the unjustifiable leniency in IOF shooting standards and a disregard for Palestinians’ lives.\n\nAdditionally, PCHR documented the following incidents:\n\n3 Palestinians wounded, including one in critical condition in Jerusalem;\n\n2, including 1 child, wounded in Nablus;\n\n11, including 4 children, wounded in Qalqilya.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, PCHR documented 8 instances of IOF opening fire, and 4 shootings on fishing boats.\n\nIOF incursions and arrests of Palestinian civilians: IOF carried out 103 incursions into the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem. Those incursions included raids of civilian houses and shootings. During this week’s incursions, 78 Palestinians were arrested, including 7 children.\n\nDemolitions:\n\nPCHR documented 13 incidents:\n\nOccupied East Jerusalem: 5 houses demolished, including 2 self-demolished, in Sur Baher, Silwan and Beit Hanina. A commercial facility was self-demolished in the old city. Wide-scale distribution of demolition notices against houses, commercial and agricultural establishments. Also, IOF disbursed summonses against Palestinians, issued a cease-construction order of a mosque, and confiscated a tin-plated greenhouse in Isawiya. A commercial barracks demolished, and a container confiscated in al-Za’im. A health center used as a Covid-19 vaccination hub was also demolished in Jabel Mukaber, as well as 2 barracks used for cattle in Anata.\n\nBethlehem: demolition notices served against 8 houses, a mosque, and a civilian facility in Nahalin.\n\nTubas: 2 residential tents removed, as well as 6 others used for cattle, along with 80 steel barriers, and 15 cattle feeders in the northern Jordan valleys.\n\nSettler-attacks:\n\nPCHR documented the following attacks by settlers in the West Bank:\n\nNablus: Palestinian lands in Burin attacked; 46 olive trees cut; a vehicle struck, and its windshield shattered; civilian homes attacked in Burqa.\n\nHebron: a house attacked in Tel Rumeida.\n\nIsraeli closure policy and restrictions on freedom of movement:\n\nThe Israeli occupation authorities continued its collective punishment measures against the Gaza Strip as the 15-year Israeli closure imposed on the territory deepened the population’s humanitarian and living crises. Unemployment has skyrocketed at 45% of the population, 63% of whom are youth.\n\nMore than half of the Gaza Strip’s population suffer from poverty, as the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics data shows that 53% of the Gaza Strip population is impoverished and more than 62.2% are food insecure, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nAdditionally, IOF continued to divide the West Bank into separate cantons with key roads blocked by the Israeli occupation since the Second Intifada in 2000, restricting civilian movement with temporary and permanent checkpoints, where civilian are also subjected to arrests, especially at al-Karama border crossing located alongside the Palestinian-Jordanian border.\n\nShooting and other Violations of the Right to Life and Bodily Integrity\n\nThursday, December 30th, 2021:\n\nAt approximately 00:00 on Thursday 30th of December 2021, IOF arrested Mohammed Rateb Sar’awi (30) and his cousin Malek ‘Issa Sar’awi (27) after they raided Adam Housing Compound in Kafr ‘Aqab village, north of occupied East Jerusalem’s Old City. During the incursion, tens of young men gathered near the compound and threw stones and empty bottles at IOF, who immediately fired live and rubber-coated bullets at them. As a result, three were wounded with live bullets; one of them sustained serious wounds. They were identified as follows: Mohammed Nafez Farhan was wounded with a bullet in his abdomen and sustained serious wounds while Eyad Mohammed al-Shahrouri and Samed Mohammed ‘Afanah were wounded in their lower limbs. All of them were taken to Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah to receive medical treatment.\n\nAt approximately 07:30, IOF stationed along the border fence east of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza Strip, opened fire at the agricultural lands. No casualties were reported.\n\nAt approximately 21:00 IOF arrested Monther al-Rowidi (21) and Ihab Abu Sneinah (19) after raiding and searching their houses during their incursion into al-‘Ain neighborhood in Silwan village, south of occupied East Jerusalem’s Old City. During the incursion, tens of young men gathered at the neighborhood entrance and threw stones and empty bottles at IOF and their vehicles. They set fire to an Israeli police watchtower with surveillance cameras. IOF immediately attacked the protesters and fired rubber-coated metal bullets and teargas canisters at them. The clashes continued in their neighborhood for hours and extended to Beer Ayoub neighborhood, where intense clashes broke out between dozens of young men and IOF, which drowned the neighborhood with skunk water.\n\nFriday, December 31st December 2021:\n\nOn Friday morning, 31st of December 2021, IOF killed a Palestinian with a disability (a mental disorder), near Haris village intersection, north of Salfit. They claimed that he has attempted to carry out a stabbing attack. Statements collected by the victim’s family refute the Israeli allegation, and IOF have yet to release any images or videos of the incident despite the abundance of surveillance cameras at the site.\n\nAccording to information obtained by PCHR’s fieldworker, at around 09:00, IOF stationed near Haris village intersection, north of Salfit, opened fire at a person after he stepped out of his car and headed towards a bus station, where IOF were standing. As a result, he was wounded, fell on the ground, and was left to bleed to death. IOF announced that they blocked an attempted stabbing attack by a Palestinian at the intersection stating that he stepped out of his car with a knife in his hand and ran toward the Israeli bus stop, and that the IOF opened fire at him, killing him. No injuries were reported among the soldiers.\n\nFollowing the incident, IOF closed the intersection and roads in the area and blocked traffic. They stopped the car that carried the Palestinian victim and arrested its driver, later identified as ‘Omar Mohammed ‘Ali Abu ‘Ali (19) and his cousin Mohammed Abu ‘Ali (25), who was also in the car at the time. Later, the person killed was identified as Amir ‘Atef Khader Rayyan (36), a father of five. Rayyan’s body remains in Israeli custody. According to the family, the victim had a mental disorder that was diagnosed a year ago and was in therapy.\n\nThe driver, ‘Omer Abu ‘Ali, Ameer’s brother in-law, told the victim’s father before his arrest that Amir asked him to drive him to the hospital; he asked him to stop at the intersection as he needed to vomit. Amir got out of the car and ran towards the bus station, where the soldiers were standing. They opened fire at him, wounding him in the abdomen.\n\nAccording to field investigations, there were meters between the place where IOF stationed and the place where the victim was targeted. This means that there was no imminent threat to the soldiers’ lives and proves IOF’s unjustified lenient shooting standards in disregard with Palestinians’ lives, noting that a similar incident ocurred at the same intersection last year.\n\nAt approximately 10:20, IOF stationed along the border fence east of al-Bureij in central Gaza Strip, opened fire and teargas canisters at the shepherds. No casualties were reported.\n\nAt approximately 12:15, a peaceful protest took off Bita Park, southeast of Nablus, towards al-Houta area to the east of Mount Sabih, east of the village, where IOF established “Avatar” settlement outpost 8 months ago. The protestors raised Palestinian flags and chanted slogans against the Israeli occupation and settlers. When they arrived, they were surprised with IOF taking their positions near the Mount, so intensive clashes broke out. The protesters fired stones at IOF, who continued to fire live and rubber-coated bullets as well as teargas canisters at the protesters. During the clashes, which continued until around 16:00, 2 Palestinian civilians, including a child, were wounded bullets in their lower limbs and were taken to the Rafidia Governmental Hospital in Nablus for treatment while others suffocated due to teargas inhalation, but were treated on the spot.\n\nAt approximately 12:30, IOF stationed at the southern Qalqilya checkpoint suppressed a protest organized by dozens of Palestinians. IOF chased the protesters, and clashes broke out. IOF fired sponge-tipped bullets, teargas canisters and sound bombs at them. As a result, 5 protesters were wounded with bullets, including a child; all of them were wounded in the limbs except one in the abdomen.\n\nAt approximately 14:30, IOF suppressed a weekly protest against the occupation and settlement activity in Sheikh Jarrah, north of occupied East Jerusalem’s Old City, and attacked the protesters by pushing and beating them.\n\nDozens of Sheikh Jarrah residents and international activists gathered at the main entrance to the neighborhood as usual on Fridays and took off to the eastern side of the neighborhood. However, IOF prevented them from moving forward and chased them into the eastern and western sides of the neighborhood. IOF surrounded them from all sides and prevented them from approaching the land of Salem family, who is threatened with forced displacement. After IOF suppressed the protesters, dozens gathered in the western side of the neighborhood in solidarity with the Salem family and raised Palestinian flags and pictures of Salem’s family. They chanted slogans in Arabic, English and Hebrew against the occupation, settlement and displacement of Sheikh Jarrah’s families, and others in solidarity with the people of Silwan, Bil’in, Bita, prisoners, and Jerusalem. IOF surrounded the activists, beat, and pushed them, confiscated Palestinian flags, and beat Mohammad Khader Abu al-Hummus (56), an activist, after breaking his crutch.
