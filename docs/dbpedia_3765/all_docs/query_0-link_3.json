        "text": "Russia Today, the newly launched international satellite news channel, is to start broadcasting in Arabic as well as English.\n\nAccording to the channel's director, Sergei Frolov, the Kremlin-funded station designed to promote Russia abroad will launch the Arabic-language service by the end of the year.\n\nThe Arabic version of the original Russia Today channel, which was launched in December last year, is to be run by the former al-Jazeera executive Akram Khuzam.\n\nMr Khuzam quit his previous post as the Moscow bureau chief at the Qatar-based channel last year after being charged with \"insulting Muslims\" by local Islamic leader Geidar Zhemal.\n\nThe 24-hour news channel currently broadcasts \"Russian views on world and domestic events\" in English to satellite audiences in across the world.\n\nA spokeswoman for the channel said discussions were also under way about a Spanish-language version.\n\nRussia Today currently employs nearly 600 domestic and foreign journalists and runs correspondent bureaux in London, Paris, Jerusalem and Washington with a Cairo office also planned.\n\nThe station transmits to the US and Canada via the IA5 satellite, via Hotbird 6 to Europe, and via the Taicom 3 satellite to Asia, Africa and Australia. In Russia viewers can watch Russia Today as a part of the NTV-plus package.\n\nÂ· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
