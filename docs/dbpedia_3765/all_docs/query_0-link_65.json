        "text": "Azerbaijan, Baku, Dec. 23 / Trend , U.Sadigova/ Although Turkey did not bring clear positive results in the indirect talks between Syria and Israel, the country significantly eased EU and USA's task on further dialogue.\n\n\"The Middle East needed a strong mediator. EU and U.S. can make new in these negotiations based on the results earlier achieved by Turkey,\" Yossi Mekelberg, Associate Fellow in the Middle East Programme of the British Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), told Trend by telephone from London.\n\nSince May, Syria and Israel after an eight-year-break have held four rounds of indirect talks mediated by Ankara. But last week the official Damascus refused to resume the fifth round of talks, arguing that political instability in Israel and the upcoming PM elections are the reason.\n\nOn Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert paid an official visit to Ankara to discuss the indirect talks with Syria.\n\nDespite the efforts made by Turkish mediators in the Syria-Israel dialogue, the parties failed to enter into direct negotiations.\n\nThe main subject of discussions remains the return to Damascus of Golan Height occupied by Israel in 1967 and annexed in 1980.\n\nThe peculiarity of Turkey as a mediator is that both countries have confidence in it and it has strong ties both with Damascus and Tel Aviv.\n\nDespite Ankara's six-month efforts to bring Damascus and Tel Aviv to direct negotiations, Syria and Israel are still blaming each other for slowing down a truce.\n\nIsrael accuses Syria of close cooperation with Iran, especially in the military field, and sponsoring Hamas and Hezbollah pursuing striking anti-Israeli policies. Israel's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that a truce will be out of the question until Syria cuts these relations.\n\nFor its part, Damascus insists on full return of the Gollan Heights right up to the shore of the Lake Kinneret - Israel's main fresh water tank.\n\nHowever, after the restoration of relations between Syria and the European Union this summer, Damascus and European countries, notably France, said that they want EU to be involved in the negotiations.\n\nBut the nomination of the European Union as a mediator in negotiations with Israel does not mean that Syria is against Turkish presence, said Akram Khuzam, a political analyst of Al-Jazeera TV channel.\n\n\"On the contrary, Syria welcomes Turkey's mediation and wants the process to go on at one level with EU, Turkey, USA, and Russia,\" Khuzam told Trend by telephone from Damascus.\n\nIn summer, Syrian president said that U.S. mediation in the talks would be possible only after George W. Bush leaves the White House.\n\nTurkey enjoys good credibility in the international arena, so the fact that the issue is being resolved through the mediation of Ankara proves the international importance of the Syria-Israel negotiations, said Arab analyst.\n\nThe French President Nicolas Sarkozy, one of the first European Presidents to restore relations with Syria, welcomed Ankara's mediation in the Syrian-Israeli dialogue and said Europe is ready to get involved in this process.\n\n\"Europe's interest in assisting Damascus in dialogue with Israel is that EU views Syria as a live strategic point,\" Khuzam said.\n\nAnkara re-considers its future role in these talks as Ankara's mediation efforts failed.\n\nAnkara is less likely to move talks ahead, therefore whether Turkey will mediate in future is not known yet, independent Turkish political expert Mustafa Ozcan said.\n\n\"Turkey did not help address main problem -return of Golan Heights,\" Ozcan said to Trend by telephone from Istanbul.\n\nHowever, regardless of results of the Turkish mediation, Israeli political circles welcome Ankara's role.\n\n\"Ankara lays a special emphasis on unique ties with Israel. These relations can play an important role in Israeli's reconciling with the Arab neighbors,\" a source in the Foreign Ministry of Israel, who wanted to keep name anonymous, said to Trend .\n\nHe said participation in the Syrian-Israeli dialogue is necessitated by Turkey's willingness to gain recognition as major peacekeeper in the Middle East.\n\nAppreciating Europe's strive, especially that of France, to assume the role of mediator in this dialogue, Paris tries to find \"the golden mean\" in Israel-Syria talks, a source added. Meanwhile, the official Tel Aviv does not oppose Europe's intervention and believes that Ankara's mediation is worth appreciation, diplomatic sources in Israel said.\n\nThe other goal pursued by EU in mediating in talks is use relations with Damascus to solve other conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n\"Once Syria-Israel conflict is solved, Lebanon-Israel relations will also normalize,\" Arab analytic Khuzam said.\n\nDamascus obviously supports Lebanese Hezbollah whose activities are targeted against Israel. The activities of the party have provoked civil wars in Lebanon several times. It summer of 2006, it launched war with Israel.\n\nIsraeli air forces made several air strikes on Beirut and other Lebanese territories to eliminate members of the party. The air strikes claimed the lives of over 1,500 Lebanese civilians.\n\nMoreover, in case of reconciliation of Damascus with Tel Aviv, the negotiations on Palestine-Israeli conflict will move forward to next stage, Khuzam said.\n\nBesides Iran, Syria is one of the sponsors of Hamas, Palestinian resistance movement, who fires shells on Israel as a response to the blockade of the Gaza strip.\n\n\"It has been known for a long time that Europe's goal in the Middle East is the peace with Syria,\" he said.\n\nA.
