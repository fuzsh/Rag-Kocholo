        "text": "A Bayesian Approach to the Paleomagnetic Conglomerate Test\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeslop, David; Roberts, Andrew P.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe conglomerate test has served the paleomagnetic community for over 60 years as a means to detect remagnetizations. The test states that if a suite of clasts within a bed have uniformly random paleomagnetic directions, then the conglomerate cannot have experienced a pervasive event that remagnetized the clasts in the same direction. The current form of the conglomerate test is based on null hypothesis testing, which results in a binary \"pass\" (uniformly random directions) or \"fail\" (nonrandom directions) outcome. We have recast the conglomerate test in a Bayesian framework with the aim of providing more information concerning the level of support a given data set provides for a hypothesis of uniformly random paleomagnetic directions. Using this approach, we place the conglomerate test in a fully probabilistic framework that allows for inconclusive results when insufficient information is available to draw firm conclusions concerning the randomness or nonrandomness of directions. With our method, sample sets larger than those typically employed in paleomagnetism may be required to achieve strong support for a hypothesis of random directions. Given the potentially detrimental effect of unrecognized remagnetizations on paleomagnetic reconstructions, it is important to provide a means to draw statistically robust data-driven inferences. Our Bayesian analysis provides a means to do this for the conglomerate test.\n\nIdentifying Provenance of Archaean Basal Conglomerates: An Evidence from Sigegudda and Bababudan Conglomerate Quartzites, India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitra, A.; Dey, S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGeochemical characteristics of clastic sedimentary rocks deposited and later preserved in ancient supracrustal sequences of Archaean terrain are competent representation of their source rocks in provenance. These rocks usually sample a wide geographic area and bear signature of subsequently destroyed and dismembered terrains. In this study the quartz pebble conglomerate-quartz sandstone association of Sigegudda and Bababudan belt of western Dharwar craton (WDC), Southern India have been studied to understand the nature of their provenance. Both Sigegudda and Bababudan belt represent younger (2.8-2.6 Ga) greenstone sequences of WDC. They start with a prominent band of conglomerate-quartzite lying over Palaeo to Meso Archaean Peninsular Gneiss (3.35-3.29 Ga) with older Sargur greentone (3.35-3.28 Ga) enclaves along an unconformity. Here, we present a comprehensive provenance (mainly source rock characterization) study of major and trace element composition of low to moderately metamorphosed basal siliciclastics of the younger greenstone sequences of WDC. Chemically they are enriched in Th, U, HFSE (Hf, Nb, Zr) and depleted in Sc, Co, Cr and Eu content with elevated La/Sc and Th/Sc values depicting a differentiated felsic source. This is further supported by fractionated LREE (10.64 - 14.66), significant negative Eu anomaly (0.67 - 0.55) and nearly flat HREE indicating granitoid rocks as source. In La-Th-Cr/100 and La-Th-Sc triangular diagram, quartz arenite field overlap with the Peninsular Gneiss and plotted far away from the mafic-ultramafics of Sargur. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of arenites of Sigegudda (71) and Bababudan (75), Peninsular Gneisses (avg-50) and Sargur group (avg-30) implies their derivation from the underlying gneisses associated with a prolonged weathering. The presence of a thick conglomerate-quartz sandstone association with differently sized quartz in their framework and matrix, depicts the development of a stable craton in\n\nMartian fluvial conglomerates at Gale crater.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilliams, R M E; Grotzinger, J P; Dietrich, W E; Gupta, S; Sumner, D Y; Wiens, R C; Mangold, N; Malin, M C; Edgett, K S; Maurice, S; Forni, O; Gasnault, O; Ollila, A; Newsom, H E; Dromart, G; Palucis, M C; Yingst, R A; Anderson, R B; Herkenhoff, K E; Le MouÃ©lic, S; Goetz, W; Madsen, M B; Koefoed, A; Jensen, J K; Bridges, J C; Schwenzer, S P; Lewis, K W; Stack, K M; Rubin, D; Kah, L C; Bell, J F; Farmer, J D; Sullivan, R; Van Beek, T; Blaney, D L; Pariser, O; Deen, R G\n\n2013-05-31\n\nObservations by the Mars Science Laboratory Mast Camera (Mastcam) in Gale crater reveal isolated outcrops of cemented pebbles (2 to 40 millimeters in diameter) and sand grains with textures typical of fluvial sedimentary conglomerates.

M.; Forni, O.; ...\n\n2016-03-16\n\nThe Curiosity rover has analyzed various detrital sedimentary rocks at Gale Crater, among which fluvial and lacustrine rocks are predominant. Conglomerates correspond both to the coarsest sediments analyzed and the least modified by chemical alteration, enabling us to link their chemistry to that of source rocks on the Gale Crater rims. Here, we report the results of six conglomerate targets analyzed by Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer and 40 analyzed by ChemCam. The bulk chemistry derived by both instruments suggests two distinct end-members for the conglomerate compositions. The first group (Darwin type) is typical of conglomerates analyzed before sol 540; it hasmoreÂ Â» a felsic alkali-rich composition, with a Na 2O/K 2O > 5. The second group (Kimberley type) is typical of conglomerates analyzed between sols 540 and 670 in the vicinity of the Kimberley waypoint; it has an alkali-rich potassic composition with Na 2O/K 2O < 2. The variety of chemistry and igneous textures (when identifiable) of individual clasts suggest that each conglomerate type is a mixture of multiple source rocks. Conglomerate compositions are in agreement with most of the felsic alkali-rich float rock compositions analyzed in the hummocky plains. The average composition of conglomerates can be taken as a proxy of the average igneous crust composition at Gale Crater. Finally, the differences between the composition of conglomerates and that of finer-grained detrital sediments analyzed by the rover suggest modifications by diagenetic processes (especially for Mg enrichments in fine-grained rocks), physical sorting, and mixing with finer-grained material of different composition.Â«Â less\n\nGeological and Hydrodynamical Examination of the Bathyal Tsunamigenic Origin of Miocene Conglomerates in Chita Peninsula, Central Japan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTachibana, Toru; Tsuji, Yoshinobu\n\n2011-06-01\n\nA conglomerate appears on a rocky coast called \"Tsubutega-ura Coast\", located on the southwestern coast near the southern tip of the Chita Peninsula, Aichi Prefecture, central Japan. The conglomerate belongs to Miocene sedimentary rocks termed the Morozaki Group. The conglomerate includes meter-scale boulders, indicating that it was formed by an extraordinary event. In the geological investigation, we observed that the conglomerate shows alternate changes of paleocurrent directions between seaward and landward. This feature is supposed to be formed by tsunami currents. In the hydrodynamical investigation, we obtained following results: (1) the lowest limit of a current velocity to move a boulder of about 3 m in diameter would be about 2-3 m/s, (2) the speed of tsunami currents reproduced by tsunami simulation exceeds 3 m/s at 300 m in depth when the tsunami is generated by a gigantic earthquake with magnitude 9.0 or more, (3) the transport distance of the boulder would be several hundred meters to several kilometers by one tsunami event caused by a gigantic earthquake. We conclude that tsunamis best explain the formation of the conglomerate deposited in upper bathyal environments about 200-400 m depth, both from geological and hydrodynamical viewpoints.\n\nJelly Bean conglomerate (lower Permian): record of a forebulge in southeastern Arizona\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nArmin, R.\n\nThe most incongruous stratigraphic unit the Earp Formation (Pennsylvanian-Permian) is the Jelly Bean conglomerate (JBC), a unit rarely more than 5 m thick, but occurring over 15,000 km/sup 2/. The JBC consists mostly of clast-supported chert-pebble and limestone-clast conglomerate, litharenite, and pebbly sandstone, whereas most of the Earp Formation is marine limestone, siltstone, and shale. The JCB lies on eroded siltstone or limestone, and is capped conformably by siltstone. The JBC is probably a braided-stream deposit as indicated by presence of fluvial dunes and ripples, amalgamated bar and channel conglomerates, imbricated clasts, channeled underbeds, and lack of point bars. PaleocurrentsmoreÂ Â» were generally southward. The thinness and widespread occurrence of the JBC suggest a uniform, gentle paleoslope down which the streams flowed. Deposition of the JBC occurred at about the climax of the Marathon phase of the Ouachita orogeny in west Texas and northern Mexico. The age and location of the JBC, which fringes cratonic North America, indicate that it was related to the late Paleozoic convergence of North and South America, and may have resulted from flexural forebulging caused by thrusting in the Marathon orogene and associated sedimentation in a foredeep.Â«Â less\n\nSilicosis in Workers Exposed to Artificial Quartz Conglomerates: Does It Differ From Chronic Simple Silicosis?\n\nPubMed\n\nPaolucci, Valentina; Romeo, Riccardo; Sisinni, Antonietta Gerardina; Bartoli, Dusca; Mazzei, Maria Antonietta; Sartorelli, Pietro\n\n2015-12-01\n\nRecently, a number of reports have been published on silicosis in workers exposed to artificial quartz conglomerates containing high levels of crystalline silica particles (70-90%) used in the construction of kitchen and bathroom surfaces. Three cases of silicosis in workers exposed to artificial quartz conglomerates are reported. The diagnosis was derived from both the International Labour Office and the International Classification of HRCT for Occupational and Environmental Respiratory Diseases (ICOERD) classifications and cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In 2 cases, levels of respirable silica greatly in excess of recommended standards were measured in the workplace, and cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid highlighted a prevalence of lymphocytes, meeting criteria for the diagnosis of accelerated silicosis. The prevention of pneumoconiosis caused by the use of innovative materials, such as artificial conglomerates with high crystalline silica content must be addressed. Copyright Â© 2014 SEPAR.

Although geologists have focused on the study of deformed conglomerates for several decades, some problems of the process and mechanism of deformation, such as the development of structures in pebbles and matrix, are still not understand well. Numerical modelling provides a method to investigate the process of deformation, as a function of different controlling parameters, up to high strains at conditions that cannot be achieved in the laboratory. We use the 2D numerical modelling platform Elle coupled to the full field crystal visco-plasticity code (VPFFT) to simulate the deformation of conglomerates under simple shear conditions, achieving high finite strains of â¥10. Probably for the first time, we included the effect of an anisotropy, i.e. mica-rich matrix. Our simulations show the deformation of pebbles not only depends on the viscosity contrast between pebbles and matrix but emphasises the importance of interaction between neighbouring pebbles. Under the same finite strain shearing the pebbles of conglomerates with high pebble densities show higher Rf and lower Î¦ than those of conglomerates with a low density pebbles. Strain localisation can be observed at both the margin of strong pebbles and in the bridging area between the pebbles. At low to medium finite strain, local areas show the opposite (antithetic) shear sense because of the different relative rotation and movement of pebbles or clusters of pebbles. Very hard pebbles retain their original shape and may rotate, depending on the anisotropy of the matrix. Ï-clasts are formed by pebbles with moderate viscosity contrast between pebble and a softer matrix. By contrast, Î´-clasts are not observed in our simulations with both isotropic and anisotropic matrices, which is consistent with their relative scarcity in\n\nPreliminary report on radioactive conglomerates of Middle Precambrian age in the Sierra Madre and Medicine Bow Mountains of southeastern Wyoming\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHouston, Robert Stroud; Graff, P.J.; Karlstrom, K.E.; Root, Forrest\n\n1977-01-01\n\nMiddle Precambrian miogeosynclinal metasedimentary rocks o# the Sierra Madre and Medicine Bow Mountains of southeastern Wyoming contain radioactive quartz-pebble conglomerates of possible economic interest. These conglomerates do not contain ore-grade uranium in surface outcrops, but an earlier report on the geochemistry of the Arrastre Lake area of the Medicine Bow Mountains shows that ore-grade deposits may be present in the subsurface. This report describes the stratigraphy of the host metasedimentary rocks and the stratigraphic setting of the radioactive conglomerates in both the Sierra Madre and Medicine Bow Mountains, and compares these rock units with those of the Blind River-Elliot Lake uranium district in Canada. The location of radioactive .conglomerates is given so that further exploration may be undertaken by interested parties.\n\nOutbreak of silicosis in Spanish quartz conglomerate workers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPÃ©rez-Alonso, ArÃ¡nzazu; CÃ³rdoba-DoÃ±a, Juan Antonio; Millares-Lorenzo, JosÃ© Luis; Figueroa-Murillo, Estrella; GarcÃ­a-Vadillo, Cristina; Romero-Morillo, JosÃ©\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjectives: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of an outbreak of occupational silicosis and the associated working conditions. Methods: Cases were defined as men working in the stone cutting, shaping, and finishing industry in the province of CÃ¡diz, diagnosed with silicosis between July 2009 and May 2012, and were identified and diagnosed by the department of pulmonology of the University Hospital of Puerto Real (CÃ¡diz). A census of workplaces using quartz conglomerates was carried out to determine total numbers of potentially exposed workers. A patient telephone survey on occupational exposures and a review of medical records for all participants were conducted. Results: Silicosis was diagnosed in 46 men with a median age of 33 years and a median of 11 years working in the manufacturing of countertops. Of these cases, 91.3% were diagnosed with simple chronic silicosis, with an abnormal high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) scan. One patient died during the study period. Employer non-compliance in prevention and control measures was frequently reported, as were environmental and individual protection failures. Conclusions: The use of new construction materials such as quartz conglomerates has increased silicosis incidence due to intensive occupational exposures, in the context of high demand fuelled by the housing boom. This widespread exposure poses a risk if appropriate preventive measures are not undertaken.

It lacks stable muddy layers and sophisticated classification of the sedimentation periods and the proportion of sedimentary layering in each period has long been a difficult task for geologists. In addressing this problem, this paper attempts to introduce the theory of climatic cycles driven by astronomical periods from astronomical stratigraphy on the basis of the characteristics of the sedimentation under the turbidity current in the region of study. Through studying the conditions for the formation of the conglomerate layer and the factors of control, we pinpoint the formation of the layer in chronology and differentiate the cycle interface and correlation in the same formation period. Milankovitch analysis is conducted on the sedimentation of the conglomerate layer in the region of study to determine if the stratigraphy cycle of the region is primarily controlled by the eccentricity cycle and calculate MSC1 and MSC2 thicknesses of 189.3 m and 78.05 m, respectively. Milankovitch theory is the primary tool used in the analysis, in conjunction with petrographic analysis. The stratum at the {{{{S}}}4}{{u}} is classified into four IV-grade sequences and 11 V-grade sequences. The information on the dominant cycle frequency is used for wave filtering of the well logs and to determine the significant Milankovitch wave log. With the data from this curve, we may compare the stratigraphy cycle with the characteristics of the standard cycle and classify and compare the sedimentation periods of the conglomerate layers in further detail.\n\nThe Effect of Petrographic Characteristics on Engineering Properties of Conglomerates from Famenin Region, Northeast of Hamedan, Iran\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhanlari, G. R.; Heidari, M.; Noori, M.; Momeni, A.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTo assess relationship between engineering characteristics and petrographic features, conglomerates samples related to Qom formation from Famenin region in northeast of Hamedan province were studied. Samples were tested in laboratory to determine the uniaxial compressive strength, point load strength index, modulus of elasticity, porosity, dry and saturation densities. For determining petrographic features, textural and mineralogical parameters, thin sections of the samples were prepared and studied. The results show that the effect of textural characteristics on the engineering properties of conglomerates supposed to be more important than mineralogical composition. It also was concluded that the packing proximity, packing density, grain shape and mean grain size, cement and matrix frequency are as textural features that have a significant effect on the physical and mechanical properties of the studied conglomerates. In this study, predictive statistical relationships were developed to estimate the physical and mechanical properties of the rocks based on the results of petrographic features. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression was used in four different steps comprising various combinations of petrographical characteristics for each engineering parameters. Finally, the best equations with specific arrangement were suggested to estimate engineering properties of the Qom formation conglomerates.\n\nBreccia-Conglomerate Rocks on Lower Mount Sharp, Mars Stereo\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2016-08-19\n\nThis stereo scene from the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover shows boulders composed, in part, of pebble-size (0.2 to 2.6 inches, or 0.5 to 6.5 centimeters across) and larger rock fragments. The size and shape of the fragments provide clues to the origins of these boulders. This image is an anaglyph that appears three dimensional when viewed through red-blue glasses with the red lens on the left. The separate right-eye and left-eye views combined into the stereo version are Figure 1 and Figure 2. Mastcam's right-eye camera has a telephoto lens, with focal length of 100 millimeters. The left-eye camera provides a wider view, with a 34-millimeter lens. These images were taken on July 22, 2016, during the 1,408th Martian day, or sol, of Curiosity's work on Mars. For scale, the relatively flat rock at left is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The rock in the foreground at right is informally named \"Balombo.\" The group of boulders is at a site called \"Bimbe.\" The Curiosity team chose to drive the rover to Bimbe to further understand patches of boulders first identified from orbit and seen occasionally on the rover's traverse. The boulders at Bimbe consist of multiple rock types. Some include pieces, or \"clasts,\" of smaller, older rock cemented together, called breccias or conglomerates. The shapes of the inclusion clasts -- whether they are rounded or sharp-edged -- may indicate how far the clasts were transported, and by what processes. Breccias have more angular clasts, while conglomerates have more rounded clasts. As is clear by looking at these boulders, they contain both angular and rounded clasts, leading to some uncertainty about how they formed. Conglomerate rocks such as \"Hottah\" were inspected near Curiosity's landing site and interpreted as part of an ancient streambed. Breccias are generally formed by consolidation of fragments under pressure. On Mars such pressure might come from crater-forming impact, or by deep burial and exhumation\n\nNational Uranium Resource Evaluation. Volume 1. Summary of the geology and uranium potential of Precambrian conglomerates in southeastern Wyoming\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKarlstrom, K.E.; Houston, R.S.; Flurkey, A.J.\n\n1981-02-01\n\nA series of uranium-, thorium-, and gold-bearing conglomerates in Late Archean and Early Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks have been discovered in southern Wyoming. The mineral deposits were found by applying the time and strata bound model for the origin of uranium-bearing quartz-pebble conglomerates to favorable rock types within a geologic terrane known from prior regional mapping. No mineral deposits have been discovered that are of current (1981) economic interest, but preliminary resource estimates indicate that over 3418 tons of uranium and over 1996 tons of thorium are present in the Medicine Bow Mountains and that over 440 tons of uranium andmoreÂ Â» 6350 tons of thorium are present in Sierra Madre. Sampling has been inadequate to determine gold resources. High grade uranium deposits have not been detected by work to date but local beds of uranium-bearing conglomerate contain as much as 1380 ppM uranium over a thickness of 0.65 meters. This project has involved geologic mapping at scales from 1/6000 to 1/50,000 detailed sampling, and the evaluation of 48 diamond drill holes, but the area is too large to fully establish the economic potential with the present information. This first volume summarizes the geologic setting and geologic and geochemical characteristics of the uranium-bearing conglomerates. Volume 2 contains supporting geochemical data, lithologic logs from 48 drill holes in Precambrian rocks, and drill site geologic maps and cross-sections from most of the holes. Volume 3 is a geostatistical resource estimate of uranium and thorium in quartz-pebble conglomerates.Â«Â less\n\nGeology and recognition criteria for uranium deposits of the quartz-pebble conglomerate type. Final report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nButton, A.; Adams, S.S.\n\n1981-03-01\n\nThis report is concerned with Precambrian uraniferous conglomerates. This class of deposit has been estimated to contain between approximately 16 and 35 percent of the global uranium reserve in two rather small areas, one in Canada, the other in South Africa. Similar conglomerates, which are often gold-bearing, are, however, rather widespread, being found in parts of most Precambrian shield areas. Data have been synthesized on the geologic habitat and character of this deposit type. The primary objective has been to provide the most relevant geologic observations in a structural fashion to allow resource studies and exploration to focus on themoreÂ Â» most prospective targets in the shortest possible time.Â«Â less\n\nPrecambrian uranium-bearing quartz-pebble conglomerates: exploration model and United States resource potential\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHouston, R.S.; Karlstrom, K.E.\n\n1979-11-01\n\nUranium has been discovered in fluvial quartz-pebble conglomerates in most of the Precambrian shield areas of the world, including the Canadian, African, South American, Indian, Baltic, and Australian shields. Occurrences in these and other areas are shown. Two of these occurrences, the Huronian supergroup of Canada and the Witwatersrand deposit of South Africa contain 20 to 30 percent of the planet's known uranium reserves. Thus it is critical that we understand the origin of these deposits and develop exploration models that can aid in finding new deposits. Inasmuch as these uranium-bearing conglomerates are confined almost entirely to rocks of PrecambrianmoreÂ Â» age, Part I of this review begins with a discussion of Precambrian geology as it applies to the conglomerates. This is followed by a discussion of genetic concepts, a discussion of unresolved problems, and finally a suggested exploration model. Part II summarizes known and potential occurrences of Precambrian fossil placers in the world and evaluates them in terms of the suggested exploration model. Part III discusses the potential for important Precambrian fossil-placer uranium deposits in the United States and includes suggestions that may be helpful in establishing an exploration program in this country. Part III also brings together new (1975-1978) data on uranium occurrences in the Precambrian of the Wyoming Province. Part IV is a complete bibliography of Precambrian fossil placers, divided according to geographical areas. In total, this paper is designed to be a comprehensive review of Precambrian uranium-bearing fossil placers which will be of use to uranium explorationists and to students of Precambrian geology.Â«Â less\n\nEarly cretaceous topographic growth of the Lhasaplano, Tibetan plateau: Constraints from the Damxung conglomerate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Jian-Gang; Hu, Xiumian; Garzanti, Eduardo; Ji, Wei-Qiang; Liu, Zhi-Chao; Liu, Xiao-Chi; Wu, Fu-Yuan\n\n2017-07-01\n\nConstraining the timing of early topographic growth on the Tibetan plateau is critical for any models of India-Asia collision, Himalayan orogeny and subsequent plateau development in the Cenozoic. Stratigraphic, sedimentological and provenance analysis of the Lower Cretaceous red-beds of the Damxung Conglomerate provide new key information to reconstruct the paleogeography and the tectonic evolution of the Lhasa terrane at the time. The over 700-m-thick Damxung Conglomerate documents distal alluvial fan to braidplain sedimentation passing upward to proximal alluvial fan sedimentation. Deposition began near sea level, as documented by limestone beds occurring at the base of the unit. Zircon U-Pb dating of interbedded tuff layers constrain deposition age at ca. 111 Ma. Abundance of volcanic clasts, Cretaceous U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes of detrital zircons yielding mainly negative ÉHf(t) values together with paleocurrent data indicate an active volcanic source located in the North Lhasa subterrane. Pre-Mesozoic-aged zircon, recycled quartz and (meta) sedimentary rock fragments increase up-section, indicating progressive erosional exhumation of the Paleozoic sedimentary/metasedimentary basement. The Damxung Conglomerate thus records a significant uplift and unroofing stage in the source region, implying initial topographic growth on the Lhasa terrane at early Albian time. Early Cretaceous topographic growth on the Lhasa terrane is supported by the stratigraphic record in the Linzhou basin, the Xigaze forearc basin and the southern Nima basin. In contrast, marine strata in the central-western Lhasa terrane lasted until the early Cenomanian (ca. 96 Ma), indicating diachronous marine regression on the Lhasa terrane from east to west.\n\nMountain big sagebrush communities on the Bishop Conglomerate in the eastern Uinta Mountains\n\nTreesearch\n\nSherel Goodrich; Allen Huber\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe Bishop Conglomerate forms broad, gently sloping pediments that include a mantle or veneer of coarse gravel and some cobble over underlying formations.

Neoproterozoic foliated slates (\"Anguiano Schists\") crop out under up to 300 m thick, unfoliated quartz-rich conglomerates (\"Anguiano Conglomerates\") and quartzites which are stratigraphically ca. 600 m below the oldest, paleontologically dated, pre-trilobitic Cambrian layers (likely older than 520 Ma). The Anguiano Conglomerates contain mm to cm grainsized well-rounded pebbles of various types including monocrystalline quartz, detrital zircon and tourmaline-bearing sandstones, black cherts and metamorphic poly-crystalline quartz aggregates. The undeformed matrix is made of much smaller (diagenetically overgrown) monocrystaline quartz grains and minor amounts of accesory zircon, tourmaline and mica. Black chert pebbles exhibit microstructural evidence of brittle deformation (microfaults and thin veins of syntaxial fibrous quartz). These and the fine-grained sandstone pebbles can also exhibit ductile deformations (microfolds with thickened hinges and axial planar continuous foliations), too. Polycrystalline quartz pebbles exhibit a variety of microstructures that resulted from syn-metamorphic ductile deformations. These are recognisable under the petrographic microscope and include continuous foliations, quartz shape fabrics, various types of subgrain or recrystallized new grain microtextures, and lattice preferred orientations (LPOs). Conventional characterization of quartz fabrics (after oriented structural sections) is challenged in conglomerate pebble thin sections by the difficulty of unraveling in them the complete structural reference framework provided by foliation (whose trace can be unraveled) and lineation orientation (which cannot be directly identified). Quartz in various metamorphic polycrystalline pebbles was studied with the Electron Back\n\nDrill-hole data, drill-site geology, and geochemical data from the study of Precambrian uraniferous conglomerates of the Medicine Bow Mountains and Sierra Madre of southeastern Wyoming\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKarlstrom, K.E.; Houston, R.S.; Schmidt, T.G.\n\n1981-02-01\n\nThis volume is presented as a companion to Volume 1: The Geology and Uranium Potential of Precambrian Conglomerates in the Medicine Bow Mountains and Sierra Madre of Southeastern Wyoming; and to Volume 3: Uranium Assessment for Precambrian Pebble Conglomerates in Southeastern Wyoming.

This study concerns the upper, deep marine part of the Rosario Formation , which includes several slope channel systems, one of these, the San Fernando channel systems consists of five channel complex sets (CCS1 to CCS5), each characterized by three filling stages. Stage I consists of predominantly clastÂ­ and matrix-supported conglomerates, with subordinate medium to coarse grained sandstones. Stage II consists of units of clast-supported conglomerates with subordinate medium to coarse-grained sandstones, separated by mainly thinly-bedded turbidites (intercalation of thin beds of fine-grained sandstones and mudstones). Stage III consists mainly of hemipelagic mudstones. The main objective of this research is to determine source area and to compare the coarse fraction and finer fraction (fragments <2 cm) from conglomerates of each channel set, combining provenance methodology such as heavy minerals, clast counting, geochemistry, bulk petrography and U/Pb in detrital zircons by LA-ICPMS and SHRIMP. The heavy minerals assembly identified were Ca amphibole, epidote, clinozoisite, titanite, garnet, tourmaline, apatite, rutile and zircon, among them amphiboles are by far the most abundant detrital mineral. Clast counting and petrographic characterization showed that the pebble fraction of the conglomerates is constituted at least 18 different, and the majority being composed by pyroclastic, porphyritic volcanic and sandstone rocks. Bulk quantification indicates that the main provenance tectonic mode of the fine fraction of the conglomerates can be interpreted as dissected magmatic arc, with subordinate uplifted basement and recycled orogenic contributions. The preliminary conclusion is that the sedimentary supply to the Rosario Formation was mostly derived from volcanic and plutonic rocks of\n\nSedimentology and stratigraphy of the Kanayut Conglomerate, central and western Brooks Range, Alaska; report of 1981 field season\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNilsen, T.H.; Moore, T.E.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe Upper Devonian and Lower Mississippian(?) Kanayut Conglomerate forms a major stratigraphic unit along the crest of the Brooks Range of northern Alaska. It crops out for an east-west distance of about 900 km and a north-south distance of about 65 km. The Kanayut is wholly allochthonous and has probably been transported northward on a series of thrust plates. The Kanayut is as thick as 2,600 m in the east-central Brooks Range. It thins and fines to the south and west. The Kanayut forms the middle part of the allochthonous sequence of the Endicott Group, an Upper Devonian and Mississippian clastic sequence underlain by platform limestones of the Baird Group and overlain by platform limestone, carbonaceous shale, and black chert of the Lisburne Group. The Kanayut overlies the marine Upper Devonian Noatak Sandstone or, where it is missing, the marine Upper Devonian Hunt Fork Shale. It is overlain by the marine Mississippian Kayak Shale. The Kanayut Conglomerate forms the fluvial part of a large, coarse-grained delta that prograded to the southwest in Late Devonian time and retreated in Early Mississippian time. Four sections of the Kanayut Conglomerate in the central Brooks Range and five in the western Brooks Range were measured in 1981. The sections from the western Brooks Range document the presence of fluvial cycles in the Kanayut as far west as the shores of the Chukchi Sea. The Kanayut in this area is generally finer grained than it is in the central and eastern Brooks Range, having a maximum clast size of 3 cm. It is probably about 300 m thick. The upper and lower contacts of the Kanayut are gradational. The lower Kanayut contains calcareous, marine-influenced sandstone within channel deposits, and the upper Kanayut contains probable marine interdistributary-bay shale sequences. The members of the Kanayut Conglomerate cannot be differentiated in this region. In the central Brooks Range, sections of the Kanayut Conglomerate at Siavlat Mountain and Kakivilak\n\nEffects of grinding and humidification on the transformation of conglomerate to racemic compound in optically active drugs.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiyarom, S; Yonemochi, E; Oguchi, T; Yamamoto, K\n\n1997-04-01\n\nThe effects of grinding and humidification on the transformation of conglomerate to racemic compound have been investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy for leucine, norleucine, valine, serine, tartaric acid and malic acid. Racemic physical mixtures were prepared by physical mixing of equimolar quantities of D and I. crystals using a mortar and pestle. Ground mixtures were obtained by grinding the physical mixtures with a vibrational mill. Humidification was performed by storing the physical mixtures and the ground mixtures in a desiccator containing saturated aqueous salt solutions at 40 degrees C. When physical mixtures of malic acid, tartaric acid and serine were ground, the XPD peaks of the racemic compounds were observed. The XPD patterns of humidified physical mixtures of these compounds also showed the formation of the racemic compounds. This indicated that grinding or humidification of malic acid, tartaric acid and serine induced the transformation of conglomerate to racemic compound crystals. When, on the other hand, the physical mixtures of valine, leucine and norleucine were ground, peaks of racemic compounds were not detected in the XPD pattern. After humidification of the ground mixtures of valine, leucine and norleucine, however, the XPD peaks of racemic compounds were observed. DSC and IR studies revealed consistent results. We concluded that grinding or humidification of malic acid, tartaric acid and serine could induce the transformation of a conglomerate to racemic compound. In contrast, humidifying after grinding was needed to bring about the transformation in leucine, norleucine and valine.\n\nAchiral-to-chiral transition in benzil solidification: analogies with racemic conglomerates systems showing deracemization.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Hachemi, Zoubir; Arteaga, Oriol; Canillas, Adolf; Crusats, Joaquim; Sorrenti, Alessandro; Veintemillas-Verdaguer, Sabino; Ribo, Josep M\n\n2013-07-01\n\nExperimental results show that benzil (1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanedione), an achiral compound that crystallizes as a racemic conglomerate, yields by solidification polycrystalline scalemic mixtures of high enantiomeric excesses. These results are related to those previously reported in this type of compounds on deracemizations of racemic mixtures of crystal enantiomorphs obtained by wet grinding. However, the present results strongly suggest that these experiments cannot be explained without taking into account chiral recognition interactions at the level of precritical clusters. The conditions that would define a general thermodynamic scenario for such deracemizations are discussed.

Asymmetrical anticlines with steeply dipping east flanks and gently dipping west flanks are superimposed on the upwarp. These subsidiary structures trend north. The uranium ore bodies are localized in conglomeratic sandstone of the Upper Triassic Shinarump conglomerate that fills channels scoured in the underlying Lower and Middle (?) Triassic Moenkopi formation. These channels range from relatively narrow and shallow ones 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep to much broader and deeper ones 2,300 feet wide and 70 feet deep. Two types of channels can be distinguished-r-a short-type less than 2 miles Iong 5 and a long-type traceable for distances greater than 2 miles Plant matter in the form of trees, branches,'and twigs was deposited with Shinarump sediments in the channels. It is suggested that when the Shinarump conglomerate was invaded by mineralizing solutions the uranium ore was deposited primarily in localities formerly occupied by the plant material. Further, it is suggested that the short channels are more likely to have ore accumulations than long channels.\n\nGeochemistry of carbonate cements in surficial alluvial conglomerates and their paleoclimatic implications, Sultanate of Oman\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBurns, S.J.; Matter, A.\n\n1995-01-02\n\nEarly diagenetic carbonate cements are a common feature of Quaternary alluvial conglomerates in Oman. Cements are formed in the vadose and, more commonly, phreatic zones from near-surface groundwaters. In drainage areas underlain by the Semail Ophiolite, groundwaters have Mg{sup 2+}/Ca{sup 2+} ratios greater than two, and cements are often dolomite or high-magnesium calcite in addition to low-magnesium calcite. In drainage areas underlain by limestone, groundwaters have Mg{sup 2+}/Ca{sup 2+} ratios of around one or less and cement mineralogy is nearly always low-magnesium calcite. The oxygen and carbon stable isotopic ratios of the cements vary widely, from {minus}10.6{per_thousand} to +3.0{per_thousand} PDBmoreÂ Â» and from {minus}10.0{per_thousand} to +0.7{per_thousand} PDB, respectively. Cement {delta}{sup 18}O values principally reflect variation in rainfall {delta}{sup 18}O over a time scale of several thousand years. Rainfall and cement {delta}{sup 18}O values probably are inversely correlated with the amount of rainfall, which is related to the frequency and intensity of the Indian Ocean monsoon. Thus, cement {delta}{sup 18}O is potentially a proxy indicator of relative rainfall and monsoon activity. For each of three sampling areas, {delta}{sup 13}C is positively correlated to {delta}{sup 18}O. Cement {delta}{sup 13}C values are also related to rainfall amount because rainfall controls the plant population. Greater plant respiration of isotopically depleted CO{sub 2} to shallow groundwaters and burial of organic material in conglomerate deposits results in lower cement {delta}{sup 13}C values compared to periods of lesser plant activity.Â«Â less\n\nAbsolute configuration and crystal packing chirality for three conglomerate-forming ortho-halogen substituted phenyl glycerol ethers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBredikhin, Alexander A.; Gubaidullin, Aidar T.; Bredikhina, Zemfira A.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nThree conglomerate-forming ortho-Hal (Hal = Cl, Br, I) substituted phenyl glycerol ethers 1- 3 were investigated by single-crystal X-ray analysis, and the absolute configuration for all substances was established.

Two different types of crystal packing were evaluated for these very much alike compounds.

It was found that the solubilities of racemic and enantiomeric diols rac- and (R)-1 depend strongly on temperature. The ternary phase diagram of the guaifenesin enantiomers in water in the temperature range between 10Â°C and 40Â°C was constructed. Clear evidence was obtained that rac-1 crystallizes as a stable conglomerate. The Meyerhoffer coefficient for the guaifenesin-water system is more than two and strongly depends on temperature. Neither crystalline hydrates nor polymorphs were detected within the range of conditions covered. Metastable zone width data with regard to primary nucleation were also collected for rac-1 and (R)-1. On the basis of the knowledge acquired, the resolution of racemic guaifenesin by preferential crystallization from solution could be realized successfully.

Macrophages in adipocytes, and hypoxia in adipose tissue have been suggested to explain how obesity can relate to oxidative stress. The straight line hypothesis using the lactic acid trap construct has been put forward to explain how proton imbalance can relate to obesity. Proton imbalance has been also reported to associate with the production of reactive oxygen species by inhibition of mitochondrial energy production. This review brings together existing literature and concepts to explain how obesity can relate to oxidative stress via protons, uniquely for itself or, as often observed, in conglomeration of additional diseases.

Adam; BÄ k, Marta; Wessely, Godfrid\n\n2009-04-01\n\nInvestigations were carried out on foraminiferids and radiolaria from redeposited clasts within the conglomerates of the Konradsheim Formation (Gresten Klippen Zone) in the area of the PÃ¶chlau hill, east of Maria Neustift. These shales and marls are of Middle to Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous age. In the latter clasts, foraminiferal assemblages with Tritaxia ex gr. gaultina as well as radiolaria species Angulobracchia portmanni Baumgartner, Dictyomitra communis (Squinabol), Hiscocapsa asseni (Tan), Pseudodictyomitra lodogaensis Pessagno, Pseudoeucyrtis hanni (Tan), Rhopalosyringium fossile (Squinabol) were found. In one block from the uppermost part of the sequence there is an assemblage with Caudammina (H) gigantea, Rotalipora appenninica and Globotruncana bulloides. However, the brecciated character of this block and occurrence near a fault suggest that it was probably wedged into the conglomerates of the Konradsheim Formation during tectonic movements. In pelitic siliceous limestones below the Konradsheim Limestone radiolarian assemblages of Middle Callovian to Early Tithonian age were found. They enable correlation with the Scheibbsbach Formation. In a marly sequence, above the conglomeratic limestone, the foraminiferal assemblages contain taxa from mid-Cretaceous up to Paleocene. The present biostratigraphic investigation confirmed the previous stratigraphic assignments and imply clearly that the sedimentation of deposits similar to the Konradsheim Formation also occurred at the end of the Early Cretaceous and deposition of conglomeratic limestones within the Gresten Klippen Zone, and especially within the Konradsheim Formation, was repeated several times during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.\n\nPink manganian phengite in a high P/ T meta-conglomerate from northern Syros (Cyclades, Greece)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAltherr, Rainer; Soder, Christian; Panienka, Sandra; Peters, Daniel; Meyer, Hans-Peter\n\n2013-11-01\n\nA new occurrence of Mn-rich rocks was discovered within the high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic rocks on the Palos peninsula of Syros (Greece). Near the summit of Mount PrÃ­onas, a meta-conglomerate consists of calcite (~63 wt%), pink manganian phengite, blue-purple manganian aegirine-jadeite, microcline, albite and quartz. In addition, it contains abundant braunite-rich aggregates (up to ~1.5 cm in diameter) that include hollandite [(Ba0.98-1.02K<0.01Na<0.02Ca<0.03) (Mn{1.02-1.52/3+}Fe{0.38-0.88/3+}Ti0.29-0.92Mn{5.11-5.76/4+})O16], barite and manganian hematite. Due to metamorphic recrystallization and deformation, the contacts between clasts and matrix are blurred and most clasts have lost their identity. In back-scattered electron images, many aegirine-jadeite grains appear patchy and show variable jadeite contents (Jd10-67). These pyroxenes occur in contact with either quartz or albite. Manganian phengite (3.41-3.49 Si per 11 oxygen anions) is of the 3T type and contains 1.4-2.2 wt% of Mn2O3. At the known P- T conditions of high-pressure metamorphism on Syros (~1.4 GPa/ 470 Â°C), the mineral sub-assemblage braunite + quartz + calcite (former aragonite) suggests high oxygen fugacities relative to the HM buffer (+7 â¤ ÎfO2 â¤ + 17) and relatively high CO2 fugacities. The exact origin of the conglomerate is not known, but it is assumed that the Fe-Mn-rich and the calcite-rich particles originated from different sources. Braunite has rather low contents of Cu (~0.19 wt%) and the concentrations of Co, Ni and Zn are less than 0.09 wt%. Hollandite shows even lower concentrations of these elements. Furthermore, the bulk-rock compositions of two samples are characterized by low contents of Cu, Co and Ni, suggesting a hydrothermal origin of the manganese ore. Most likely, these Fe-Mn-Si oxyhydroxide deposits consisted of ferrihydrite, todorokite, birnessite, amorphous silica (opal-A) and nontronite.

Present paleocurrent directions from the Upper Cretaceous Jalama Formation of the Santa Ynez Mountains are north-directed; these forearc sediments (Great Valley sequence) contain magmatic arc-derived conglomerate clasts from the Peninsular Ranges in southern California. Paleocurrents in the lower Eocene Juncal and Cozy Dell Formations are south-directed. This juxtaposition is best explained by 90/degrees/ or more of clockwise rotation of the WTR microplate, so that Upper Cretaceous forearc sediments sourced from the Peninsular Ranges magmatic arc were depositedmoreÂ Â» by west-directed currents. Eocene sediments were derived from an uplifted portion of the western basin margin and deposited by east-directed currents. Franciscan olistoliths in the Upper Cretaceous sediments indicate deposition adjacent to an accretionary wedge; conglomeratic clasts recycled from the Upper Cretaceous sequence, and radiolarian cherts and ophiolitic boulders in the Eocene strata indicate derivation from an outer accretionary ridge.Â«Â less\n\nNew permian fusulinids from conglomerate mesa, southeastern inyo Mountains, east-central california\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStevens, C.H.; Stone, P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn the Conglomerate Mesa area in the southeastern Inyo Mountains, east-central California, a series of distinctive fusulinid assemblages ranging in age from late Artinskian to Kungurian or Roadian was developed in units 7-10 of the sedimentary rocks of Santa Rosa Flat (part of the Owens Valley Group). The fauna of unit 7 shows some eastern Klamath Mountains affinity, but most of the species in unit 7 and the lower half of unit 8 are highly endemic and comprise three new genera with 12 new species, two unusual unassigned forms, and two other new species assigned to previously described genera.

With\n\nThe Oakland Conglomerate: a Hayward Fault Teconite?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStrayer, L. M.; Allen, J. R.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe Late Cretaceous Oakland Conglomerate (OC), a coarse-grained cobble and sandstone unit of the Great Valley Sequence is a tectonite. Faulted and shattered cobbles and well developed grain-on-grain contact features between clasts are ubiquitous and penetrative throughout conglomeratic lenses. The OC outcrops east of the Hayward fault (HF) and adjacent to the Chabot fault in the East Bay Hills. It overlies the Knoxville Formation and may have been buried beneath 4-6 km of younger units. The OC is a proximal submarine fan deposit with sediment sourced to the ancestral Klamath and Sierra Nevada. Clast types are dominated by volcanics, granitoids, as well as numerous quartzites, perhaps reflecting complex provenance:Klamath and pre-Sierran arc and pre-Cretaceous Basin and Range. And although there was a significant interval between the Late-K deposition of the OC and the inception of San Andreas faulting in the Bay Area, its 1-2 km proximity to the HF in the Oakland Metropolitan area strongly suggests that much of the brittle-plastic deformation within the OC may be due to earthquakes upon the nearby Hayward fault. Clasts with the OC are frequently shattered, fractured or faulted. Most have grain-on-grain contact features on their surfaces regardless of whether they are matrix or grain supported. Faulting in the cobbles ranges from outcrop scale, penetrative and often conjugate shear fracture sets that run through both cobbles and matrix (if present), to closely spaced en-echelon faults that clearly deform cobbles, and radially shattered specimens with nearly conical conjugate shear fractures that are clearly the result of point loading due to grain-on-grain contact. There are at least 3 types of contact structures, ranging from: 1) Type-H, bright circular halos with little or no surface dimpling, likely the result of intense microfracture at the contact; 2) Type-S, shattered, rounded 'firing-pin' structures that have pulverized, depressed contact that is the locus of\n\nMonitoring the fall of large atmospheric ice conglomerations: a multianalytical approach to the study of the Mejorada del Campo megacryometeor.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrellana, Francisco Alamilla; Alegre, JosÃ© Ma Ramiro; Cordero PÃ©rez, JosÃ© Carlos; MartÃ­n Redondo, Ma Paz; Delgado Huertas, Antonio; FernÃ¡ndez Sampedro, Ma Teresa; Menor-SalvÃ¡n, CÃ©sar; Ruiz-Bermejo, Marta; LÃ³pez-Vera, Fernando; RodrÃ­guez-Losada, JosÃ© A; Martinez-Frias, Jesus\n\n2008-04-01\n\nCertain local atmospheric anomalies, such as the formation of unusually large ice conglomerations (megacryometeors), have been proposed to be a potential natural hazard for people and aviation, as well as geoindicators for fingerprinting larger-scale atmospheric environmental changes.

Synergistic effects are thought to be caused by rapid adsorption on the PAC surface followed by diffusion to the TiO(2) surface and photocatalytic degradation. The Freundlich constant K(F) was used for comparing the sorption properties of the three substances and it was found that K(F) for clofibric acid was 3 times lower than for carbamazepine and iomeprol, regardless of the kind of PAC used. A PAC with a distinct tendency to form conglomerates was selected so that a high percentage of the PAC surface was in direct proximity to the TiO(2) surface. The photocatalytic degradation of the pharmaceutically active compounds studied followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Synergistic effects only occurred for clofibric acid (factor 1.5) and an inverse relationship between adsorption affinity and synergistic effects was found. High affinity of the target substances to the PAC surface seemed to be counterproductive for the photocatalytic degradation.\n\nField-induced refractive index variation in the dark conglomerate phase for polarization-independent switchable liquid crystal lenses.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilton, H E; Nagaraj, M; Kaur, S; Jones, J C; Morgan, P B; Gleeson, H F\n\n2014-11-01\n\nLiquid crystal lenses are an emerging technology that can provide variable focal power in response to applied voltage. Many designs for liquid-crystal-based lenses are polarization dependent, so that 50% of light is not focused as required, making polarization-independent technologies very attractive. Recently, the dark conglomerate (DC) phase, which is an optically isotropic liquid crystalline state, has been shown to exhibit a large change in refractive index in response to an applied electric field (În=0.04). This paper describes computational modeling of the electrostatic solutions for two different types of 100Â Î¼m diameter liquid crystal lenses, which include the DC phase, demonstrating that it shows great potential for efficient isotropic optical switching in lenses. A feature of the field dependence of the refractive index change in the DC phase is that it is approximately linear in a certain range, leading to the prediction of excellent optical quality for driving fields in this regime. Interestingly, a simulated microlens is shown to exhibit two modes of operation: a positive lens based upon a uniform bulk change in refractive index at high voltages, and a negative lens resulting from the induction of a gradient index effect at intermediate voltages.\n\nLate Cretaceous volcanism in south-central New Mexico: Conglomerates of the McRae and Love Ranch Formations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChapman-Fahey, J.L.; McMillan, N.J.; Mack, G.H.\n\nEvidence to support Late Cretaceous volcanism in south central New Mexico is restricted to a small area of 75-Ma-old andesitic rocks at Copper Flats near Hillsboro, and volcanic clasts in the McRae (Late Cretaceous/Paleocene ) and Love Ranch (Paleocene/Eocene). Formations located in the Jornada del Muerto basin east and northeast of the Caballo Mountains. Major and trace element data and petrographic analysis of 5 samples from Copper Flats lavas and 40 samples of volcanic clasts from the McRae and Love Ranch conglomerates will be used to reconstruct the Cretaceous volcanic field. The McRae Formation consists of two members: the lowermoreÂ Â» Jose Creek and the upper Hall Lake. The lowermost Love Ranch Formation is unconformable in all places on the Hall Lake Member. Stratigraphic variations in clast composition from volcanic rocks in the lower Love Ranch Formation to Paleozoic and Precambrian clasts in the upper Love Ranch Formation reflect the progressive unroofing of the Laramide Rio Grande Uplift. Volcanic clasts in the McRae and Love Ranch Formations were derived from the west and south of the depositional basin, but the source area for McRae clasts is less well constrained. Stratigraphic, chemical, and petrographic data will be used to reconstruct the volcanic complex and more clearly define magma genesis and metasomatism associated with Laramide deformation.Â«Â less\n\nDetrital U-Pb zircon dating of lower Ordovician syn-arc-continent collision conglomerates in the Irish Caledonides\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nClift, P.D.; Carter, A.; Draut, A.E.; Long, H.V.; Chew, D.M.; Schouten, H.A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Early Ordovician Grampian Orogeny in the British Isles represents a classic example of collision between an oceanic island arc and a passive continental margin, starting around 480??Ma. The South Mayo Trough in western Ireland preserves a complete and well-dated sedimentary record of arc collision. We sampled sandstones and conglomerates from the Rosroe, Maumtrasna and Derryveeny Formations in order to assess erosion rates and patterns during and after arc collision. U-Pb dating of zircons reveals a provenance dominated by erosion from the upper levels of the Dalradian Supergroup (Southern Highland and Argyll Groups), with up to 20% influx from the colliding arc into the Rosroe Formation, but only 6% in the Maumtrasna Formation (~ 465??Ma). The dominant source regions lay to the northeast (e.g. in the vicinity of the Ox Mountains, 50??km distant, along strike). The older portions of the North Mayo Dalradian and its depositional basement (the Annagh Gneiss Complex) do not appear to have been important sources, while the Connemara Dalradian only plays a part after 460??Ma, when it supplies the Derryveeny Formation. By this time all erosion from the arc had effectively ceased and exhumation rates had slowed greatly. The Irish Grampian Orogeny parallels the modern Taiwan collision in showing little role for the colliding arc in the production of sediment. Negligible volumes of arc crust are lost because of erosion during accretion to the continental margin. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.\n\nDevelopment of cataclastic foliation in deformation bands in feldspar-rich conglomerates of the Rio do Peixe Basin, NE Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNicchio, Matheus A.; Nogueira, Francisco C. C.; Balsamo, Fabrizio; Souza, Jorge A. B.; Carvalho, Bruno R. B. M.; Bezerra, Francisco H. R.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this work we describe the deformation mechanisms and processes that occurred during the evolution of cataclastic deformation bands developed in the feldspar-rich conglomerates of the Rio do Peixe Basin, NE Brazil. We studied bands with different deformation intensities, ranging from single cm-thick tabular bands to more evolved clustering zones. The chemical identification of cataclastic material within deformation bands was performed using compositional mapping in SEM images, EDX and XRD analyses. Deformation processes were identified by microstructural analysis and by the quantification of comminution intensity, performed using digital image processing. The deformation bands are internally non homogeneous and developed during five evolutionary stages: (1) moderate grain size reduction, grain rotation and grain border comminution; (2) intense grain size reduction with preferential feldspar fragmentation; (3) formation of subparallel C-type slip zones; (4) formation of S-type structures, generating S-C-like fabric; and (5) formation of Câ§-type slip zones, generating well-developed foliation that resembles S-C-Câ§-type structures in a ductile environment. Such deformation fabric is mostly imparted by the preferential alignment of intensely comminuted feldspar fragments along thin slip zones developed within deformation bands. These processes were purely mechanical (i.e., grain crushing and reorientation). No clays or fluids were involved in such processes.\n\nInterlocking Detachable Coil Embolization by Technique of Dumbbell-Shaped Framing and Filling and Bridge Formation Under Balloon Dilatation for Huge Conglomerate Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKawai, Nobuyuki, E-mail: nobkawai@wakayama-med.ac.jp; Sato, Morio, E-mail: morisato@mail.wakayama-med.ac.jp; Minamiguchi, Hiroyuki, E-mail: hiromina4@hotmail.com\n\nA 60-year-old woman presented with a conglomerate pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) size 8.2 Multiplication-Sign 7.2 cm on chest X-ray.

This study presents, for the first time, a two-phase (CO 2 and brine) flow visualization under reservoir conditions (10âMPa, 50âÂ°C) for a highly heterogeneous conglomerate core obtained from a real CO 2 storage site. Rock heterogeneity and the porosity variation characteristics were evaluated using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Multiphase flow tests with an in-situ imaging technology revealed three distinct CO 2 saturation distributions (from homogeneous to non-uniform) dependent on compositional complexity. Dense discontinuity networks within clasts provided well-connected pathways for CO 2 flow, potentially helping to reduce overpressure. Two flow tests, one under capillary-dominated conditions and the other in a transition regime between the capillary and viscous limits, indicated that greater injection rates (potential causes of reservoir overpressure) could be significantly reduced without substantially altering the total stored CO 2 mass. Finally, the capillary storage capacity of the reservoir was calculated. Capacity ranged between 0.5 and 4.5%, depending on the initial CO 2 saturation.\n\n[Medical conglomerates].\n\nPubMed\n\nAustruy, P; Alexandre, L; Richard, F\n\n1988-01-01\n\nCommunity hospitals is undergoing rapid consolidation into network of private corporations providing health care services.

This deposit type has had a controversial history in regards to genetic models. However, most researchers conclude that they are paleoplacer deposits that have been modified by metamorphism and hydrothermal fluid flow subsequent to initial sedimentation.The deposits are found exclusively within fault-bounded depositional basins. The periphery of these basins commonly consists of granite-greenstone terranes, classic hosts for lode gold that source the detrital material infilling the basin. The gold reefs are typically located along unconformities or, less commonly, at the top of sedimentary beds. Large quartz pebbles and heavy-mineral concentrates are found associated with the gold. Deposits that formed prior to the Great Oxidation Event (circa 2.4 giga-annum [Ga]) contain pyrite, whereas younger deposits contain iron oxides. Uranium minerals and hydrocarbons are also notable features of some deposits.Much of the gold in these types of deposits forms crystalline features that are the product of local remobilization. However, some gold grains preserve textures that are undoubtedly of detrital origin. Other heavy minerals, such as pyrite, contain growth banding that is truncated along broken margins, which indicates that they were transported into place as opposed to forming by in situ growth in a hydrothermal setting.The ore tailings associated with these deposits commonly contain uranium-rich minerals and sulfides. Oxidation of the sulfides releases sulfuric acid and mobilizes various metals into the environment. The neutralizing potential of the tailings is minimal, since carbonate minerals are rare. The continuity of the tabular ore bodies, such as those of the Witwatersrand Basin, has allowed these mines to be the deepest in\n\nDetrital Zircon U-Pb Analysis of the Liuqu Conglomerate Along the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture Zone, and Implications for the Mode and Timing of Collision Tectonics in Southern Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXie, Y.; Dilek, Y.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Liuqu Conglomerate (LQC) along the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone (YZSZ) in Southern Tibet is a terrestrial deposit that provides significant spatial and temporal constraints for the timing and nature of collisional events in the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan-Himalayan orogenic belt. The 10-km-wide (N-S) LQC is exposed discontinuously for more than 1000 km in an E-W direction, and is tectonically overlain to the north by the Cretaceous Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere along a S-vergent thrust fault system and to the south by Triassic-Jurassic metamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic rocks of the Tethyan Himalaya along N-vergent reverse-thrust faults. The major facies of the LQC are the matrix-supported to clast-supported conglomerates. The matrix is poorly to moderate sorted red quartz sandstone, mudstone and sub-rounded pebble to cobble-sized clasts. The clast lithology present in central and southern parts includes dark red sandstone, siltstone and mudstone greyish-green shale, grey phyllite and slate with their provenance in the Triassic Tethyan Himalaya to the south. The clastic material making up its stratigraphy in the northern part of the LQC includes quartz sandstone, radiolarian chert, minor dolerite, gabbro and peridotite derived from the Cretaceous ophiolite. Here we report in-situ detrital zircon U-Pb age analysis of sandstone from the LQC near Liuqu area. 163 concordant U-Pb ages obtained from sample 22-LQ-15, 27-LQ-15 and 35-LQ-15 show the youngest age is 307Â±13 Ma with discordance of -17.02%, and the oldest zircon grain is 3362 Â±51 Ma with discordance of 2.63%. Statistically, the age spectrum of these zircons from the three sandstone samples display a prominent peak centred in 935 Ma, a large peak around 516 Ma, and two small clusters around 2429 Ma and 2772 Ma. The zircon U-Pb results provide evidence of age clusters of the sandstone in LQC are consistent with the detrital U-Pb age signature of the sandstone in Tethyan Himalaya.

As a result, oil-sweep efficiency critically depends on the direction of the pressure gradient. However, contrary to expectations, the total amount of trapped oil due to the effect of capillary trapping does not depend on the magnitude of the pressure gradient within the examined range.

Some researches, however, have defined the time of rapid denudation as simply rock uplift and have neglected the fact that the rock denudation recorded by fission track (FT) data was controlled by both surface incision and rock uplift. The incision of the Yarlung Zangbo River had a significant influence on uplift history inversion in Southern Tibet. This paper simulated the bedrock denudation and river incision histories using apatite fission track (AFT) data sampled from the Gangdese conglomerate belt, which is located in the middle of Southern Tibet, and analyzed the geological meaning of the AFT age of each sample. The results showed the following: (1) In the early Miocene (22-16 Ma), both the value of the denudation rate and the incision rate were high (0.56 mm/yr and 0.24 mm/yr). (2) In the middle-late Miocene, the incision rate (0.12 mm/yr) was similar to the denudation rate (0.09-0.11 mm/yr). (3) The historical model between river incision and bedrock denudation revealed a significant difference in the denudation rate during the period ca. 8-6 Ma. Combining these data with previously published thermochronological ages and synthesizing these ages with regional geological, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1) In the early Miocene, the denudation event probably was caused by a combined result of Indian plate rollback and the incision of the Yarlung Zangbo River. (2) In the middle-late Miocene, the denudation rate was consistent with the incision rate, which suggested that the denudation episode was caused by climate change associated with Asian monsoon intensification. (3) After 8 Ma, the stable and slow incision rate indicated that regional drastic uplift had ceased. The paleo-elevation of the research area had approached, and even exceeded, the present-day elevation in the late Miocene.\n\nDiamonds in an Archean greenstone belt: Diamond suites in unconventional rocks of Wawa, Northern Ontario (Canada)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKopylova, Maya; Bruce, Loryn; Ryder, John\n\n2010-05-01\n\nDiamonds typically are found on Archean cratons entrained by younger Phanerozoic kimberlites. In contrast, Wawa diamonds are hosted in \"unconventional\", non-kimberlitic rocks that formed contemporaneously with the mafic and sedimentary rocks of the Archean Michipicoten Greenstone Belt (MGB). We studied two diamond suites that occur within the 2.9-2.7 Ga greenschist facies rocks of MGB located in the southwest portion of the Superior Craton (E. Canada). The first diamond suite henceforth referred to as the Wawa breccia diamonds (384 stones), are hosted in the 2618-2744 Ma calc-alkaline lamprophyres and volcaniclastic breccias, contemporaneous with pillow basalts and felsic volcanics of MGB. The second suite, the Wawa conglomerate diamonds (80 crystals), are hosted in the 2697-2700 Ma poorly sorted sedimentary polymictic conglomerate which is interpreted as a proximal alluvial fan debris flow in a fan-delta environment. The majority of the diamonds was found within the matrix of the conglomerate. The diamondiferous breccia occurs 20 km north of the town of Wawa, whereas the conglomerate is found 12 km northeast of Wawa. Diamonds from the 2 occurrences were characterized and described for provenance studies. Both the breccia and conglomerate diamonds show similar crystal habits, with the predominance of octahedral single crystals and ~ 10% of cubes. The conglomerate diamonds are significantly less resorbed (no resorbtion in 43% of the stones) than the breccia diamonds (8% non-resorbed stones). In both suites, only 21-24% show high degrees of resorption. The majority of crystals in both suites are colourless, with some yellow, brown and grey stones. Conglomerate diamonds had a wider variety of colours that were not seen in the breccia diamonds, including green and pink. The breccia diamonds contain 0-740 ppm N and show two modes of N aggregation at 0-30 and 60-95%. Among the breccia diamonds, Type IaA stones comprise 17%, whereas IaAB stones make up 49% of the\n\nEvidence and dating of mid-Cretaceous tectonic activity in the San Rafael Swell, Emery County, Utah\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nEaton, J.G.; Kirkland, J.I.; Kauffman, E.G.\n\n1990-04-01\n\nEvidence of tectonic activity in the form of recycled conglomerates has been found in middle Cretaceous deposits on the western flank of the San Rafael Swell. These conglomerates, present in the upper part of the Dakota Formation and in the overlying basal Mancos Shale (Tununk Member), are separated by an earliest Turonian unconformity. The conglomerates appear to be derived from the Lower Cretaceous Buckhorn Conglomerate, or similar conglomerates, which were re-exposed by latest Cenomanian uplift. Coarse clastics provided to the nearshore facies of the Dakota Formation by coastal rivers are preserved as a coarsening upward sequence. Continued uplift eventually causedmoreÂ Â» a local marine regression by temporarily inhibiting the initial (latest Cenomanian) transgression of the Greenhorn Sea. In subaerially exposed environments pebbles and cobbles from the Buckhorn were distributed across the coastal floodplain by rivers. These clasts were reworked into a basal lag deposit when renewed transgression of the Greenhorn Sea occurred during the late early Turonian.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of processing sorghum grain on dairy calf performance.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdelgadir, I E; Morrill, J L\n\n1995-09-01\n\nTwo trials evaluated the effect of sorghum grain processing on dairy calf performance. In trial 1, Holstein calves (n = 76; .5 to 8 wk of age) were fed one of three calf starters that contained either raw, roasted (exit temperature of 135 degrees C), or conglomerated sorghum grain. The conglomeration process consisted of grinding the grain, adding water, pelleting the mixture, and then roasting it. Raw and roasted sorghum grains were ground through a 3.2-mm screen and then included in complete pelleted starters; conglomerated sorghum grain pellets were mixed with the other pelleted ingredients of the starter. Processing did not enhance calf performance or affect selected ruminal and blood metabolites. In trial 2, roasted and conglomerated sorghum grains were ground through a 3.2-mm screen, and each was included in a pelleted starter fed for ad libitum intake to Holstein calves (n = 48) from .5 to 8 wk of age. Calf performance was not affected by method of grain processing, and ruminal and blood metabolites were similar; however, 22% of calves on the conglomerated sorghum grain starter bloated during the postweaning period, which probably resulted in reduced feed intake from wk 6 to 8. Measures to prevent bloat may be necessary to realize a potential benefit of conglomerating sorghum grain for calves.\n\nSynthrusting deposition of the Pennsylvanian and Permian Strathearn Formation, Northern Carlin Trend, Nevada\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTheodore, T.G.; Berger, V.I.; Singer, D.A.; Harris, A.G.; Stevens, C.H.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe middle Upper Pennsylvanian and middle Lower Permian Strathearn Formation belongs to the overlap assemblage of the Antler orogen in Nevada. At Beaver Peak, near the Carlin Trend of gold deposits, it contains synorogenic conglomerate deposits associated with emplacement of a regionally extensive, 1-km-thick tectonic wedge that is floored by the Coyote thrust. Normal marine conodont biofacies throughout the Strathearn Formation suggest middle shelf or deeper, depositional environments. The allochthon floored by the Coyote thrust has been thrust above a middle Upper Pennsylvanian, lower conglomerate unit of the Strathearn Formation. A middle Lower Permian upper conglomerate unit, the highest unit recognized in the Strathearn Formation, as well as similarly aged dolomitic siltstone, onlap directly onto Ordovician quartzarenite of the Vinini Formation that makes up most of the Coyote allochthon. Quartz grains and quartzarenite fragments of variable roundness and shape in the conglomerate units were derived from the presently adjoining tectonic lobe of mostly quartzarenite that advanced southeast (present geographic coordinates) during the late Paleozoic into the developing Strathearn basin. Chert fragments in the conglomerates probably were derived mostly from Devonian Slaven Chert, including a widespread thick me??lange unit of the Slaven Chert in the footwall of the Coyote thrust.Lithologic and shape ratio data from approximately 4200 clasts at 17 sites of the two major conglomerate units in the Strathearn Formation at Beaver Peak are roughly similar in that they contain only chert and quartzarenite clasts, and chert clasts predominate in both units. They differ in the relative proportion of the two lithologies whereby quartzarenite clasts increase sixfold in the upper unit (middle Lower Permian) versus its content in the lower conglomerate unit. Relations at the unconformity between the upper conglomerate unit and its underlying quartzarenite shows quartzarenite\n\nElucidating tectonic events and processes from variably tectonized conglomerate clast detrital geochronology: examples from the Hongliuhe Formation in the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, NW China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCleven, Nathan; Lin, Shoufa; Davis, Donald; Xiao, Wenjiao; Guilmette, Carl\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis work expands upon detrital zircon geochronology with a sampling and analysis strategy dating granitoid conglomerate clasts that exhibit differing degrees of internal ductile deformation. As deformation textures within clastic material reflect the variation and history of tectonization in the source region of a deposit, we outline a dating methodology that can provide details of the provenance's tectonomagmatic history from deformation-relative age distributions. The method involves bulk samples of solely granitoid clasts, as they are representative of the magmatic framework within the provenance. The clasts are classified and sorted into three subsets: undeformed, slightly deformed, and deformed. LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology is performed on zircon separates of each subset. Our case study, involving the Permian Hongliuhe Formation in the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, analyzes each of the three clast subsets, as well as sandstone detrital samples, at three stratigraphic levels to yield a profile of the unroofed provenance. The age spectra of the clast samples exhibit different, wider distributions than sandstone samples, considered an effect of proximity to the respective provenance. Comparisons of clast data to sandstone data, as well as comparisons between stratigraphic levels, yield indications of key tectonic processes, in addition to the typical characteristics provided by detrital geochronology. The clast data indicates a minimal lag time, implying rapid exhumation rates, whereas sandstone data alone would indicate a 90 m.y. lag time. Early Paleozoic arc building episodes appear as Ordovician peaks in sandstone data, and Silurian-Devonian peaks in clast data, indicating a younging of magmatism towards the proximal provenance. A magmatic hiatus starts in the Devonian, correlating with the latest age of deformed clasts, interpreted as timing of collisional tectonics.

In the lower third of the formation, arkosic sandstone and conglomerate are interstratified with tuffaceous deposits. Some tuffs might have been deposited as primary, nonwelded to partially welded ignimbrites or fallout tephra. Many of the tuffaceous deposits represent redeposited material that formed tuffaceous sandstone, and many of these deposits contain arkosic grains that represent mixing of different source matieral. Arkosic sandstone, and especially conglomerate (some with maximum clast lengths up to 1 m), represent intermittent incursions of coarser plutoniclastic fan deposits into other finer grained and mostly volcaniclastic basin deposits. After deposition of the 18.78 Ma Peach Spring Tuff, the amount of tuffaceous material decreased. The upper two-thirds of the formation has arkosic sandstone and conglomerate interstratified with two olivine basalt lave flows. locally, conglomerate clasts in this part of the section have maximum lengths up to 1 m. Many tuffaceous and arkosic sandstone beds of the Spanish Canyon Formation have tabular to broad (low-relief) lenticular geometry, and locally, some arkosic conglomerate fills channels as much as 1.5 m deep. These bedforms are consistent with deposition in medial to distal alluvial-fan or fluvial environments; some finer-grained deposits might have formed in lacustrine environments.\n\nUranium deposits at the Jomac mine, White Canyon area, San Juan County, Utah\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTrites, A.F.; Hadd, G.A.\n\n1955-01-01\n\nazurite, and chalcanthite occur locally with the uranium minerals.
