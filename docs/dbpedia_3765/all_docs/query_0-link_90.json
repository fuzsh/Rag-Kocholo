Early Muslim scholars were able to communicate with their Western counterparts through contacts made during the Crusades; at Muslim universities and centres of learning in Muslim Spain (al-Andalus, or Andalusia) and Sicily to which many European students went for education; and at the universities and centres of learning in Europe itself (such as Salerno, Padua, Montpellier, Paris, and Oxford), where Islamic works were taught in Latin translations. Among the Muslim scholars well-known in the centres of learning throughout the world were al-Razi (Rhazes), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Tbn Rushd (Averroes), al Khwarizmi and Ibn Khaldun. Muslim scholars such as these and others produced original works in many fields. Many of them possessed encyclopaedic knowledge and distinguished themselves in many disparate fields of knowledge. In view of this, the Center for Muslim Contribution to Civilization was established in order to acquaint non-Muslims with the contributions Islam has given to human civilisation as a whole. The Great Books of Islamic Civilization Project attempts to cover the first 800 years of Islam, or what may be called Islam's Classical Period. This project aims at making available in English and other European languages a wide selection of works representative of Islamic civilisation in all its diversity. It is made up of translations of original Arabic works that were produced in the formative centuries of Islam, and is meant to serve the needs of a potentially large readership. Not only the specialist and scholar, but the non-specialist with an interest in Islam and its cultural heritage will be able to benefit from the series. Together, the works should serve as a rich source for the stiidy of the early periods of Islamic thought. In selecting the books for the series, the Center took into account all major areas of Islamic intellectual pursuit that could be represented. Thus the series includes works not only on better-known subjects such as law, theology, jurisprudence, history and politics, but also on subjects such as literature, medicine, astronomy, optics and geography. The specific criteria used to select individual books were these: that a book should give a faithful and comprehensive account of its field; and that it should be an authoritative source. The reader thus has at his disposal virtually a whole library of informative and enlightening works. Each book in the series has been translated by a qualified scholar and reviewed by another expert. While the style of one translation will naturally differ from another as do the styles of the authors, the translators have endeavoured, to Vlll AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADTTH the extent it was possible, to make the works accessible to the common reader. As a rule, the use of footnotes has been kept to a minimum, though a more extensive use of them was necessitated in some cases. This series is presented in the hope that it will contribute to a greater under- standing in the West of the cultural and intellectual heritage of Islam and will therefore provide an important means towards greater understanding of today's world. May God Help Us! Muhammad bin Hamad Al-Thani Chairman of the Board of Trustees About THis Series This series of Arabic works, made available in English translation, represents an outstanding selection of important Islamic studies in a variety of fields of know- ledge. The works selected for inclusion in this series meet specific criteria. They are recognized by Muslim scholars as being early and important in their fields, as works whose importance is broadly recognized by international scholars, and as having had a genuinely significant impact on the development of human culture. Readers will therefore see that this series includes a variety of works in the purely Islamic sciences, such as Qui°an, hadiih, theology, prophetic traditions (sunna), and jurisprudence [fiqh). Also represented will be books by Muslim scientists on medicine, astronomy, geography, physics, chemistry, horticulture, and other fields. The work of translating these texts has been entrusted to a group of professors in the Islamic and Western worlds who are recognized authorities in their fields. It has been deemed appropriate, in order to ensure accuracy and fluency, that two persons, one with Arabic as his mother tongue and another with English as his mother tongue, should participate together in the translation and revision of each text, This series is distinguished from other similar intercultural projects by its distinctive objectives and methodology. These works will fill a genuine gap in the library of human thought. They will prove extremely useful to all those with an interest in Islamic culture, its interaction with Western thought, and its impact on culture throughout the world. They will, it is hoped, fulfil an important role in enhancing world understanding at a time when there is such evident and urgent need for the development of peaceful coexistence. This series is published by the Center for Muslim Contribution to Civilization, which serves as a research centre under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad al-Thani, the former Minister of Education of Qatar who also chairs the Board of Trustees, The Board is comprised of a group of prominent scholars. These include His Eminence Sheikh Al-Azhar, Arab Republic of Egypt, and Dr Yousef al-Qaradhawi, Director of the Sira and Sunna Research Center. At its inception the Center was directed by the late Dr Muhammad Ibrahim Kazim, former Rector of Qatar University, who established its initial objectives. The Center was until recently directed by Dr Kamal Naji, the Foreign Cultural Relations Advisor of the Ministry of Education of Qatar. He was assisted by a Board comprising a number of academicians of Qatar University, in addition to a consultative committee chaired by Dr Ezzeddin Ibrahim, former Rector of the University of the United Arab Emirates. A further committee X AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH acting on behalf of the Center has been the prominent university professors who act under the chairmanship of Dr Raji Rammuny, Professor of Arabic at the University of Michigan. This committee is charged with making known, in Europe and in America, the books selected for translation, and in selecting and enlisting properly qualified university professors, orientalists and students of Islamic studies to undertake the work of translation and revision, as well as overseeing the publication process.

Translator's Introduction c Ulum al-hadlth (or Him al-hadith, usul al-hadith, etc.) is the broad designation which includes all of the various disciplines making up the study of hadlth. 1 Among the works in this field are certain guidebooks which attempt to summarize the entire range of this material to allow students to understand the terminology of the collectors of hadlth and to validate the methods of these collectors. Ibn Ha jar al- c Asqalani (773/1372-852/1449) presents a brief survey of the history of this sub-genre in the introduction to his Nuzhat al-nazar* his commentary on his own Nukhbat al-fikar. The ancient and modern experts had many works about the terminology of the hadlth scholars. Among the first to compose a work on this subject was the judge Abu Muhammad al-RamahurmuzI. His book was al-Muhaddith al-fasil. 3. However, he was not thorough. Abu c Abd Allah al-Hakim al-Nisaburi [was another one of the first] but he did not revise and properly arrange [the material]. 4 Abu Nu c aym al-Isbahani followed him. He did make a supplement (mustakhraj) to the book of [al-Hakim al-Nisaburi], but he left some things for his successors, Abu Bakr al-Khatib al-Baghdadi came after them. He composed a book he called al-Kifayd? on the rules of transmission and another on the guidelines [of transmission] which he called al-jfami c li-adab al-shaykh wa-'l-samfi? Few were aspects of hadlth on which he did not compose a monograph. As Abu Bakr b. Nuqta 7 put it, \"Everyone who is fair knows that the scholars of hadlth after al-Khatib are dependant on his books. \" Some 1 For a brief discussion of this genre, see the article \"Usui al-hadlth\" in The -Encyclopaedia of Islam (2nd edn., Leiden, 1953 ff.). The most thorough treatment of the development of this literary genre remains William Marcais' introduction to his translation of Nawawfs al-Taqrib wa-l-taystr li-ma^rifat sunan al-Bashtr al-Nadhir y which originally appeared in installments in Journal Asiatique and was later issued as a separate volume under the title Le Taqrib de en-Nawawi (Paris, 1902). 2 (Benares, 1394/1974), 3-4.

Al-Qadi c Iyad composed a short book which he called al-Ilma® and Abu Hafs al-Mayanajl [that is al-Mayyanishl] wrote a pamphlet which he entitled Ma layasa c u al-muhaddith jahluhu? With the perspective given to him by the passage of two centuries, Ibn Hajar al- c Asqalan! regards Kitab MaWifat anwa*- Him al-hadxih, more popularly known as the Muqaddima^ of Ibn al-Salah al-Shahrazuri as the most influential work on the study of hadlth: u The people took it up and followed its method. The versifiers, epitomrzers, supplemented, abridgers, critics and proponents of it are innumerable.\" Library catalogs bear witness that for the next few centuries the belief prevailed that the market could always bear another synopsis, in either verse or prose, of the contents of Ibn al-Salah's work. Indeed, it would be no exaggeration to say that to this day most traditional hadlth scholarship is directly or indirectly based on this one work.

Speaking specifically about the area of Shahrazur, the contemporary historian Yaqut (d. 626/1229) noted the rapaciousness of the Kurds inhabiting the surrounding mountains and the town's exceptional fertility in talented scholars. He makes particular reference to two famous Shafi c ite families with roots there, the Banu 'l-Shahrazuri 12 and the Banu c AsrOn, both of which supplied judges to the Zangids, Ayyubids and others. 13 Ibn al-Salah does not seem to have been able to lay claim to any blood connection to either of the prominent Shafi c ite families of al-Jazira, although his father had studied under Sharaf al-Diri b. Abl <Asrun (493/1100-585/1189), who later went on to become a very prominent figure in Zangid Syria. Ibn al-Salah began his training in law under his father' 4 in Irbil, the capital of one of the minor principalities which lay between the Khwarazmians in the East and Ayyubids in the West. The sources do not tell us when he arrived there or how long he stayed. However, one cannot help but feel that some elements of his basic religious outlook were forged in this period. As was the case with Shahrazur, Irbil as portrayed in TcPrikh Irbil 15 of Ibn al-Mustawfi (564/1169-637/1239) enjoyed a much more vigorous intellectual life than one would expect to find. The ruler of Irbil after 586/1190 was a former lieutenant and brother-in-law of Saladin, Muzaffar al-Din Gokbori. 16 As was the case with so many rulers in this period, he took an active interest in religious matters. To judge on the basis of where he spent his money, Gokborfs outlook appears to have been a form of conservative Sunnism which supported traditional manifestations of piety even when they lacked scriptural authority. The scale of his celebrations of the birth of the Prophet finds few parallels in Islamic history. 1:377-8; Mahmud al- ( Adawl, Kitab at-Ziyarat bi-Dimashq, ed.

He also financed good works in Mecca and Medina and contributed to the construction of the main mosque of the Hanbalites in the Damascene suburb of al-Salihiya. Ibn al-Salah continued his education in Mosul, which by this time was one of the last outposts of the Zangids, a dynasty which originated in northern Iraq and had controlled Syria and Egypt until the advent of the Ayyubids. There, Ibn al-Salah, before \"his mustache sprouted,\" tackled the popular manual of c Iraqi Shafttsm, Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi*s al-Muhadhdhab fi 'l-furii\\ under the tuition of Ibn Samln (523/1129-588/1192). The pinnacle of his early academic career was reached when he became a teaching assistant of c Imad al-Din b. Yanus (535/ 1 140-608/121 1), 17 the leading ShafWte scholar of the city. There was great interest in hadlth in northern Iraq at this time. The most famous member of the Zangid dynasty, Nur al-Din, founded the world's first school of hadlth in Damascus, the Dar al-hadith al-Nuriya, in 566/1170, Schools of hadlth had also recently been founded in Irbil and Mosul. Therefore, Ibn al-Salah's interest in the subject of hadith was probably awakened at an early age. It should be noted that even in this era the study of hadith was not a normal element of the curriculum of the typical student of law. Commentators had occasion* to deplore the ignorance of hadith of legal scholars. We are told that in general the only hadlth the jurists knew were the ones cited in their legal manuals and these were often viewed as unauthentic by the specialists. 18 After his time in Mosul, Ibn al-Salah made a lengthy journey to the major scholarly centers of the East, including Baghdad, Nishapur, Marv, Qazwin and Hamdan. Despite its crucial importance, this period of his life is particularly obscure and we know little more than the names of the teachers he met. Individuals like Ibn al-Sam<ani (537/1143-618/1221), Furawi (ca. 522/1128-608/1212) and al-Mu 5 ayyad (or perhaps al-Mu>ayyid) al-TusI (524/1130-617/1220) are now nothing but placeholders in obscure isnads, but in their day they enjoyed international prestige because they had comparatively short isnads. Their prominence is reflected in the fact that their reports are the only ones for which Ibn al-Salah quotes the isnad in externa in the Muqaddima. The first time we hear of Ibn al-Salah in the Ayyubid lands, where he would spend the rest of his life, is when he was appointed to the professorship of the Asadiya law school 19 in Aleppo. Presumably he took the reins of this Shafi c ite law school shortly after the death of his predecessor in 608/1211. It appears that he did not occupy the position very long and he may have left as early as 17 For this individual and his family, see Halm, Awbreitung, 188—9, 18 For example, Abu Shama, Mifammil, 3:28-9; Laknawl, al-Ajwtba al-fadila li-'l-afila al- c ashara al-kamila, ed. c Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda (Aleppo, 1384/1964), 29-33, 19 For this school, see Ibn Shaddad, al-AHaq al-khatira fi dktkr umara? al-Sham wa-'l-Jaztra^ vol. 1, part 1 (Aleppo), ed- Dominique Sourdel (Damascus, 1953), 103 — 4. TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xvn 610/ 12 13, 20 The reason for this is nowhere specified, although we may assume that his departure was amicable since the post remained in the hands of his family. What Ibn al-Salah did next is unclear. Dhahabl asserts that he studied in Damascus around 613/1216, 21 a terminus post quern apparently established by the death of the judge Ibn al-Harastani (520/1126-614/1217), who is said to have been one of his teachers. We next find Ibn al-Salah taking up the professorship of the Salahiya law school in Jerusalem in 615/1218, in the wake of his predecessor who had been ousted by the Ayyubid prince aWMu^zzam ^sa in Damascus for protesting his decision to legalize the sale of w ine. 22 The Salahiya had been established by Saladin in 588/1 192 in the Church of St Anne and it was the first Ayyubid foundation after they captured the city from the Crusaders. 23 It is described as one of \"the exalted positions in the kingdom of -Islam,\" 24 and Ibn al-Salah seems to have been successful in his tenure there and may have comfortably continued there indefinitely. As it turned out, he taught there scarcely a year before the Crusades intervened. Al-Mu^zzam found himself incapable of protecting the city, so to decrease its military value he ordered the dismantling of its walls. Despite many protests, the demolition began on 1 Muharram 616/19 March 1219 and this led to a mass exodus from the city. Ibn al-Salah joined the \"great mob\" who \"abandoned their possessions and belongings and dispersed in every direction throughout the area.\" 25 Unexpectedly, Ibn al-Salah found himself out of work and on his way to Damascus. 26 The Ayyubid prince al-Mu c azzam was given control of Damascus in 594/1198. He first ruled in the name of Saladin's son al- c Aziz and then in the name of his own father, the brother of Saladin, aMAdil. Al-Mu<azzam took over in his own name upon his father's death in 615/1218. He stands as one of the more spectacular figures of Islamic history. A scholar of certain attainments, he was determined to place his personal mark on the intellectual life around him. His most enduring legacy may be the book ascribed to him, The Missile Hitting its Mark in al-Khatib's Liver {al-Sahm al-musib ft kabid al-Khatib)* 1 a polemical tract refuting the attacks against Abu Hanlfa (d. ca. 150/767) made by the Shafi c ite 20 Dominique Sourdel, \"Les Professeurs de Madrasa a Alep aux Xlle-XlIIe siecles d'apres Ibn Shaddad,\" Bulletin d* etudes orientates, 13 (1949-51): 102, n. 30. 21 Dhahabi, Sf>r, 23:142. 22 Nu<aym],Z)<jm, 1:83. 23 For this school, see <Ulayml, Uns, 2:41, 101-18; c Abd al-Latif al-Tibawi, \"Ba<d al-madaris al-Islamiya fi 'J-Quds a]-shar]f fl akhir aJ-qarn aJ-tasi* al-hijrl,\" Majallat Majma 1 al-lugha al^Arabiya bi-Dimashq 58 (1403/1 983) :239^K>. 24 tUlaymi, f/«j,2:41. 25 <Ulaymi, Uns y 1:402. 26 Asnawi (Tabaqat, 133) and Ibn Kathlr (Tabaqat, 2:857) claim that Ibn al-galah did not settle in Damascus until 630. 1 can think of no way to account for this obviously incorrect statement. 27 Published as Kitab al-Radd <ala Abi Bakr al-Khafib al-Baghdadi (Cairo, 1351/1932). xviii AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH al-Khatib al-Baghdadl (392/ 1002—463/ 1071). The book is interesting for a number of reasons, not least for what it reveals about its putative author's preoccupations. The charge to which it responds first and at greatest length is that the imam of the Hanafites had a deficient knowledge of the Arabic language, (Of the eponyms of the four main schools of Sunnite law, Abtl Hanlfa was the only one who was - like al-Mu c azzam ^ not an ethnic. Arab.) Hanafisrn and the Arabic language were the twin passions of al-Mu c azzam's life. Al-Mu'azzam's Hanafisrn is a mystery both in its origin and its form. He, and his son following in his footsteps, were the only Hanafites in a dynasty that was otherwise Shafrite. When asked how he alone in his family happened to be a Hanafite, he flippantly replied, \"Do you not wish that there be a single Muslim among you?\" 2 * He studied Hanafite law under Jamal al-Dln 2 * al-Haslrl (546/1151-636/1238), the most prominent Hanafite of his time in Damascus, and composed, with the help of a ghostwriter, a commentary on Shaybanf s a!-jfdmi c al-kabir y a standard work on Hanafite law, 30 However, in the increasingly conservative spirit of his age, al-Mu<azzam seems to have later moved toward a purer Hanafisrn centering on the school's eponym; one is tempted to say, a fundamentalist Hanafisrn. He commissioned a work called al-Tadhkira, a ten-volume digest of the. doctrines of AbQ Ilanlfa stripped of the accretions of his students and later followers. Sibt b. al-Jawzl (581/1185 or 582-654/1256) tells us that \"he was never separated from [this book], whether on a journey or at home. He read it continuously and wrote on the back of each volume, tc Isa b. Abl Bakr b, AyyGb [aWVIu^zzam] has completed learning [this volume].' \" J1 His missionary zeal led him to found a Hanafite law school, the Mu^zzamiya, in the Hanbalite enclave of al-$alihlya in 621/1224. His activities in the realm of the Arabic language were less provocative. He sponsored a great lexicographical compilation based on a number of earlier works, 32 Not content to savor his pleasures in private, he paid cash prizes to students who had mastered certain grammatical and lexicographical texts, which did temporarily stir up some interest in these books.\" Al-Mu^zzam's reign was an age of relative liberalism. Jews and Christians were allowed to hold public office and build additions on their houses of worship. Wine was legalized so that it could be taxed. The so-called \"sciences of the Ancients\" (for example, philosophy and Logic) were cultivated and al-Mu'azzam 28 Laknawl, al-FawaHd al~bahiya ft tarcljim al-Hanaftya (Beirut, n.d.), 152-3. 29 Not \"Fakhr al-Din,\" as occurs in Sibt b. al-Jawzl f Mir* at al-zaman, 8(2): 644. 30 Mtr>at al-zaman, 8(2): 645. 31 Mir>at al-zaman, 8(2):647.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xix himself was a friend of the speculative theologian Amidi (551/1156-631/1234): What al-Mu<azzam could not bring himself to tolerate was the strict literalism advocated by some of the local Hanbalites and their restive followers. The profile of the hanbalites in Damascus had been considerably heightened in 551/1156 by arrival of Hanbalite refugees fleeing the Crusaders from the area around the Palestinian village of Jamma^l. 34 Their common origin as well as their close family ties gave the immigrant Hanbalites a cohesiveness which allowed them to exert far greater influence than their numbers warranted. Their migration to the Damascene suburb of al-Salihiya, which began in 553/1158, only served to prolong and strengthen their unity, which, one imagines, would have rapidly broken down if they had continued to live in the midst of the greater Damascene society. In al-$alihiya they created a vigorous Hanbalite intellectual life which would hardly have been augured by the group's rural origin. Two of the greatest names in Hanbalism emerged from this milieu, Ibn Qudama (541/1147-620/1223) and <Abd al-Ghani b. <Abd al-Wahid (541/1146-600/1203). Despite their suburban exile, the Hanbalite refugees continued to play a role within the city walls. Al-Mu^zzam was eventually obliged to grant the Hanbalites a mihrab of their own in the Umayyad Mosque, the religious center of the city. This became their base for menacing the local Ash^rites. Fakhr al-Dln b. c Asakir (550/1155-620/1223), Ibn al-Salah's unhappy predecessor at the Salahiya in Jerusalem, had retired to Umayyad Mosque. As an Ash^rite, he was obliged to make circuitous detours to avoid walking near the Hanbalites for fear that they would commit an outrage on his person. 35 Al-Mu'azzam's special antipathy for the Hanbalites is illuminated by his famous showdown with the aforementioned c Abd al-Ghani in 595/1199 * c Abd al-Ghani had traveled very extensively and it seems that no one with a religious text to transmit escaped his attention. A pathological troublemaker and career martyr, throughout his life we detect an eagerness to undergo a mihna, or trial, like the one the imam Ahmad b. Hanbal suffered at the hands of the c Abblsid caliph al-Ma'mOn and his successors, a subject he treated in a monograph. 37 He chose Isfahan, the hometown of the Ash<arite Aba Nu^ym al-l§bahanl Ibn Tfllun, al-Qala>id al-jawhariya ft ta y rikh al-Salihiya, ed.

In Mosul he taught c Uqayirs Kit ah al-Dtf-afa* al-kabir, which contains an uncomplimentary account of Abu Hanifa, In response, the local Hanafites rose up and had him put in prison. He would have been put to death had a quick-thinking friend not removed the objectionable pages from the book before his enemies could get their hands on it. In al-Mu^zzam's Damascus, c Abd al-Ghanl chose the venue of the Umayyad Mosque to announce his anthropomorphic doctrines based on a literal reading of the Qui°an, Inevitably, this incited the non-Hanbalites and they carried their protest to al-Mu'azzam and his Commander of the Citadel. A legal opinion was issued declaring c Abd al-Gham to be an unbeliever and innovator who was not to be left at large among the Muslims. When personally examined, c Abd al-Gham refused to back down. It was ordered that his minbar be smashed and the Hanbalites were evicted from the Umayyad Mosque. c Abd al-Gham must have thought that he had finally found his al-Ma^un in al-Mu c azzam. 39 Alas, the prominent establishment Hanbalite al-Nasih b. al-Hanball (554/1 159-634/1236) inopportunely spoiled the tableau by raising a mob and threatening mayhem. At this point the army was called out to protect the Hanafite prayer area. Within hours the Hanbalites were allowed, to resume their position in. the Umayyad Mosque. c Abd al-Ghanl was obliged to seek martyrdom in Egypt, where he died in 600/1203 on the eve of another banishment. This would not be a welcoming environment for Ibn al-Salah. Although his views were by no means as extreme as those of c Abd al-Ghani - an innate conservatism kept him from indulging in the provocative positions of the most radical Hanbalites - they were markedly different from those of al-Mu'azzam. [Ibn al-Salah] was a traditionalist following a good doctrine. He abstained from the tendentious interpretation of the theologians. He believed in what was established by the texts. He did not go beyond the texts and he accepted their literal meaning. 40 According to a titbit of gossip picked up in Mosul by Ibn Khallikan (608/121 1-681/1282), who was himself a native of Irbil, Ibn al-Salah missed his 38 c Abd al-Ghanl wrote a book entitled Tabyin al-isaba li-awhUm hasalat fiMaWifat al-$ahaba ti-Abi Nu^aym\\ see Ibn Rajab, Dhayl, 2:8, 19; Sakha wi, Path al-Mughith falaj shark Al Fiyat al-hadith H-Wraqi, 2nd edn, 3 vols (Medina, 1388/1968-1389/1969), 3:85; id., al-Nan bi-l-tawbikh li-man dhamma ahl al-ttfrikh, ed.

As a youth he secretly studied Logic under the brother of one of his first teachers, Kamal al-Din b. Yflnus (551/ 1 156-639/1242), a Shafi c ite prodigy of learning who taught Shaybani to Hanafites, the Gospel to Christians and the Torah to Jews, He made no progress and when Kamal al-Din advised him, \"People think well of you and they ascribe irreligion to everyone who studies this subject. You will spoil their opinion of you and not get anything out of this subject/' he was willing to drop it. 41 Ibn al-Salah would later sourly dismiss Logic as \"pompous words which God has made superfluous for all sane people.\" 42 Despite his ideological handicap, Ibn al-Salah did what he could to catch the princely eye in Damascus, In 620/1223 we find him among the scholars attending a lesson held to commemorate the internment of al-Mu^zzam's father in the Greater c Adillya. He could not yet occupy one of the places of honor on either side of al-Mu^zam, but he did manage to maneuver himself into a prime position in the second rank, directly in front of him. 43 Sibt b. al-jawzl refers to Ibn al-Salah's predicament in his self-serving obituary of him. 44 Sibt, the grandson of one of history's greatest Hanbalites, Abu *1-Faraj b. al-jawzl, had seen which way the wind was blowing and converted to Hanafism. He then succeeded extraordinarily in insinuating himself into the good graces of al-Mu'azzam. He writes that Ibn al-Salah buttonholed him at a shrine in a suburban park and asked him to intercede on his behalf with the prince: \"Ask him to give me a school!\" Sibt says that at the time al-Mu^zzam specifically disliked Ibn al-Salah, but does not make clear whether this was because of Ibn al-Salah's generally conservative outlook or due to some particular offense on his part. Sibt claims that he kept after the prince and eventually reconciled him to Ibn al-Salah. Ibn al-Salah's networking finally paid off when he assumed the professorship of the Rahawiya in 622/1225. Nevertheless, a rather obscure incident reveals that even now his .position remained vulnerable. The school's founder was a wealthy merchant known as Ibn Rawaha, who lived in the school. After his death in 623/1226 (or 622), the famous Sufi ibn <Arabi (560/ 1 165-638/1240) and Abu M-Hasan Khaz<al (ca. 547/1152-623/1226), the head of the shrine of C AH b. al-Husayn, Zayn al^Abidin, in Damascus, came forward and claimed that Ibn Rawaha enjoined them \"at night\" - in the form of an apparition? — to bear witness on his behalf for the removal of Ibn al-Salah. This led to a complex series of events, which none of the sources cares to unravel. Involved seem to have been Ibn al-Salah's refusal to allow the burial of the founder within the precincts of the school and some extremely restrictive stipulations placed on the running of the institution, which apparently could not be enforced. A provision forbidding Jews, 41 Ibn Khallikan, Wafayat, 5:314; Subki, Tabaqat, 8:382. 42 Dhahabi, Sryflr, 23:143. 43 Aba Shama, Dkayl, 132-3. 44 Mtr'dt al-zaman, 8(2):758, reading madrasatan instead of madrasatahu. sxii AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH Christians and extremist Hanbalites from setting foot in it is cited, Ibn al-Salah weathered the storm and seems to have held the position until his death. 45 Al-Mu^zzam died in 624/1227 at the age of forty-seven and was succeeded by his son Dawud, who continued his policies. Two years later Dawud was pushed out by his uncle al-Ashraf Although al-Mu^zzam and al-Ashraf were born only a day apart, rarely have brothers shown more marked contrasts. While the high-flying al-Mu^zam was conversing with philosophers and philologists in the sunny gardens of Damascus, al-Ashraf was campaigning ceaselessly in the icy north, extending and defending the Ayyubid domains. The acquisition of the sandal of the Prophet was his major cultural achievement. While visiting his nephew in the summer of 625/1228, it dawned on al-Ashraf that there was more to life than freezing and fighting and he resolved to take Damascus. 46 When he finally did, he immediately put his own stamp on the city. If al-Mu^zzam was al-Ma J mOn, al-Ashraf was al-Mutawakkil. Public morality was restored, non-Muslims were put in their place and the rational sciences were forbidden. Al-Ashraf renounced the sin taxes (if not the sins): wine was formally forbidden. The additions to the church of Maryam were torn down and the Christian superintendent of the treasury was humbled. As for the unholy pursuit of philosophy and science, Abu Shama writes, Study of the sciences of the Ancients had become widespread during the last years of the reign of al-Mu c azzam b. Abl Bakr and in the reign of his son Dawud and that became more common until God extinguished it in the reign of al-Ashraf. 47 The great Amidi was put under house arrest, perhaps on the basis of a famous legal opinion given by Ibn al-Sa!ah himself. 48 In this more congenial climate, Ibn alrSalah's career took off. The year 628/1231 was particularly notable. This was when he made the pilgrimage to Mecca 49 and became the first professor of the Inner (or Smaller) Shamlya. 50 The 45 Ibn Shaddad, al-AHdq al-Khatira fx dkikr umara* al-Shdm wa-l-Jazira: Tdtrikh madtnat Dimashq, ed.

TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION XXlll founder of the school, Sitt al-Sham Zumurrud KhatQn, was one of the grand ladies of the Ayyudid family. A sister of Saladin and al- c Adil, she had blood ties to over thirty Ayyubid princes. She devoted her life to good works and every year spent large sums of gold on potions and medicines which were produced in her house in the city and distributed to the populace. She had earlier founded a large school of Shafi c ite law outside of the city walls and before her death in 616/1220 she arranged to have her house, located near the Blmaristan al-Nuri, converted into the school of Shafi c ite law where Ibn al-Salah taught. Ibn al-Salah reached the peak of his career when al-Ashraf made him the first professor of the Dar al-hadith al- Ashraftya, one of the two schools of hadith founded by al-Ashraf, One of these, the Ashraftya al-Barranlya, was located in the suburb of al-Salihiya and put under the control of the local Hanbalites. 51 The inner Ashraftya, where Ibn al-Salah taught, was located within the walls of the city of Damascus, near the main gate of the Citadel and was given to the ShafWtes. It was constructed on the site of the former home of the prominent general Sarim al-Din Qiymaz al-Najml (d. 596/1200), which al-Ashraf purchased in 628/1231 and renovated over the course of two years. 52 The 6pening of the school in 630/1233 coincided with the arrival of the elevated hadith transmitter Ibn al-Zabldl (d. 631/1234) from Baghdad, who was feted by al-Ashraf during the month of Ramadan and presided over the recitation of Bukhari's §ahih in the newly opened hadith school. Ibn al-Salah died in his chambers at the Ashraftya on 25 Rabi c II 643/19 September 1245, during the Khwarazmian and Egyptian siege of Damascus. The blockade caused a severe famine within the city and a number of prominent scholars were carried off. Nevertheless his funeral was very well attended. Ceremonies were performed in the Umayyad Mosque and the crowd followed the funeral procession to the city gate known as Bab al-Faraj. Inside of the gate, the ceremonies were re-enacted. Then a brave group of men hitched up their gowns and hastily delivered his remains to its burial site at the edge of the cemetery known as Maqabir al-Sufiya. In later years, his tomb was visited as a site of blessing and it was said that a prayer made there would be fulfilled. The Muqaddima Ibn al-Salah intended the Muqaddima to be a basic introduction to the study of hadith. This book is an en try way into the study of hadith, an attempt to make clear its main and secondary issues and to explain the terminology, aims 51 For this school, see Nu<ayml, DSris, 1:47-55; Ibn Julum, $alihlya, 1:155-64; <Almawl, Tanbih, 12-13; Ibn Kinan, Muruj, 3«M0; c Abd al-Qadir Badran, Munadamat al-atlal wa-mmamarat al-khayal, ed.

Ignorance of these matters greatly impairs a transmitter. This book is - God willing - worthy of receiving attention before any other. 53 The Muqaddima began as a series of individual lectures which were only later placed in the present arrangement. 54 In composing the Muqaddima, Ibn al-Salah drew heavily on the works of most of his predecessors in the field and the final product bears an especially strong resemblance to al-Hakim al-Nlsaburl's Kitab Ma c rifat c ulum al-hadith. Considering this, it should not surprise us to read that at one point in his life Ibn al-Salah undertook to write a commentary on al-Hakim's book. 55 We may safely surmise that the commentary , which he never completed, grew into the Muqaddima. Ibn al-Salah made no attempt to conceal his debt to al-Hakim. He gave his work, popularly known as the Muqaddima, an almost identical title, Kitab Macrifat anwa c Him al-hadith^ and adopted al-Hakim's conceit of dividing the study of hadlth into a number of individual categories (sing. natP% although he thoroughly reorders them and adds thirteen new ones, bringing the total to sixty-five. How can we explain the astonishing success of this work, since it clearly broke little new ground in terms of its basic format? Where the Muqaddima did represent more of a departure from its predecessors was in its style. Abu Bakr b. Musaddi (ca. 593/1196-663/1264) described how it appeared to contemporary eyes; [Ibn a!~Salah] composed a fiqhi book on the sciences [of hadlth] and followed a theoretical course in its laws. He used to favor reason over reports (athar) and analogy over anecdotes (khabar). In [this work] he prepared principles of which no clear representation had [hitherto] been made. 57 Ibn al-Salah wrote the Muqaddima like a law book rather than a hadlth book. Most notably he eschewed the ponderous habit of most of the writers on hadlth of quoting earlier authorities at length. Writers on hadlth had hitherto been averse to speaking in their own voice, adding only a sentence or two of their own composition here and there to highlight the significance of the quoted material, In addition to making their books long-winded and cumbersome, this taxed the reader's patience and attentiveness. Although the Muqaddima still includes a good deal of quoted material, it does so much less than its predecessors. The easier style probably contributed greatly to the popularity of the work. 53 Muqaddima^ 436. 54 Ibn Bajar ascribes the deficiency he perceives in the arrangement of the book to this procedure; Nuzhai al-nazar, 5, 55 Ibn Rushayd, Aftf tf/-fcyto, 3:218. 56 Ibn al-Salah knew the title of al-Hakim *s work to be Kitab Macrifat anwa c ^lum al-hadith, see Muqaddima, 213. 57 IbnRafiS T&rlkh, 132. TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION xxv This Translation I have relied largely on two modern editions of Ibn al-Salah's text, Nur al-Din c Itr's c Ulum al-hadith li-Ibn al-Salah (Damascus, 1387/1966) and the late c A 5 isha <Abd al-Rahman's Muqaddimat Ibn al-Salah (2nd edn, Cairo, 1989). In the instances where I was able to consult the relevant manuscripts, it appears that in most cases the readings that Professor c Itr gives are to be favored where they disagree. Nevertheless, the copious supplementary material Professor c Abd al~Rahman provided makes her edition indispensable to the serious student, Two procedures I have adopted may require some explanation. I have been sparing in the use of brackets to indicate material not present in the original text, especially when it is merely a question of meeting the demands of English usage, I have used brackets when supplying additional elements to names mentioned in the text in the hope of rendering them more easily identifiable to the reader, when providing short explanatory notes, when the material supplied is more extensive and when it seemed to me to be more open to dispute. I should also draw attention to a practice I have adopted in an effort to render the text clearer to the average reader. Ibn al-Salah did not have at his disposal that great scholarly convenience, the footnote. He therefore had to incorporate his digressions in the body of the text. In the instances where these are relatively lengthy or interrupt the flow of the argument, I have distinguished them by presenting them as an indented text block. Despite all appearances to the contrary, I have attempted to keep the footnotes to a minimum. The Muqaddima amply exemplifies what Professor Franz Rosenthal has called the philnomynous character of Islamic scholarship. I have tried to identify all of the individuals mentioned in the text at the first appearance of their name. Ibn al-Salah cites a number of extremely obscure, usually very early, figures as illustrations of particular phenomena. In the cases where little seems to have been known about the person, apart from the characteristic which prompted Ibn al-Salah to mention him, I have merely provided a reference to the entry on him in one or two of the standard biographical dictionaries. Ibn al-Salah quotes extensively from his predecessors. Where he provides a clue about the specific written source from which he drew the quotation, I have attempted to provide adequate bibliographical information. It should be noted that in almost every instance there is some variation, usually minor, between Ibn al-Salah's rendering of the quoted passage and the way it appears in the modern printed edition of the same text. In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the help I received from others. A generous grant I received from the American Philosophical Society allowed me to travel to Syria and Egypt in the summer of 1996. Professor Raji Rammuny, the coordinator of the series in which this volume appears, has shown great patience and helped me overcome a number of obstacles. Professor c Abd al-Rahman (perhaps better known under her nom de plume \"Bint al-ShatP\") freely provided valuable assistance and advice. I would especially like to express xxv i AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH my gratitude to Professor Rosenthal. He has on occasions too numerous to mention allowed me to benefit from his vast expertise on questions both general and specific. To him I dedicate this translation. Author's Introduction \"Our Lord, give us mercy from You and grant us guidance in our affair.\" 1 Praise - the most complete and highest praise - be to God, the Guide for those who seek His guidance, the Guardian of those who fear Him and the One who suffices for those who seek His approval. The most perfect prayers and blessings on our Prophet, the other prophets and the family of each so long as someone asks for His forgiveness and invokes His mercy. Amen! Amen! The science of hadith is one of the best of the excellent sciences and one of the most beneficial of the useful disciplines. Manly and virile men — that is, thorough and complete scholars - love it and the only people who dislike it are contemptible and base. It is one of the sciences with the greatest relevance to the various other sciences, especially applied law (fiqh) y which is the central science. For that reason, the errors of those writers on applied law who are unfamiliar with the science of hadith are numerous and the imperfections in the remarks of those scholars who forsake it are plain. Formerly the stature of hadith was exalted. The throngs of hadith students were massive and the capabilities of the experts 2 in the discipline and the transmitters of hadith were high. Through their living the different sciences of hadith were made vital, through their continued existence the branches of the various sub-disciplines of hadith were kept fresh and the abodes of hadith were occupied by its students. These students and experts have now died off and the sciences of hadith have been obliterated to such an extent that the practitioners in hadith are only a tiny band, few and weak in number. For the most part, in taking up hadith they are concerned with nothing more than hearing them heedlessly, and in recording hadith they do not expend more effort than to write them down defectively. They toss aside the various sciences of hadith through which the stature of hadith became exalted and they have made themselves remote from the bodies of knowledge which made it magnificent. Just when someone examining a difficulty in the science of hadith could hardly find anyone capable of explaining 1 Q_ur>an 18:10. 2 Huffaz (sing. hafiz)\\ Later scholars attempted to define the qualifications theoretically necessary for a transmitter of hadith to earn this designation; see, for example, Ibn Hajar aMAsqalani, al-Nukat *-ala Kitab Ibn dl-$alak y ed. Rabl c b. Hadl ( Umayr, 2nd edn, 2 vols (Riyadh, 1408/1988), 1:268; Sakha wl, al-Jawaktr wa-l-durar ft tarjamat skaykk al-hlam Ibn Hajar, ed.

I beseech, entreat and humbly pray to God, the Great - in whose hand lie harm and benefit and granting and forbidding - , seeking His favor by every means and requesting His intercession in every way, that He make this book replete in that regard - and more replete - and that He make it ample for all of that - and more ample - and that He make the reward for it and the benefit of it great in this world and the next. God is near and He answers our prayers. I will have no success without God, Upon Him I rely and to Him I turn repentantly. This is a list of the Categories of hadith: 1.

The generations of transmitters and scholars {macrifat tabaqat al-ruwat wa- l-tulama*) 64. Transmitters of hadith and other scholars who were clients (macrifat al-mawali min al-ruwat wa-'l- c ulama?) 65. The residences and lands of transmitters {macrifat awtan al-ruwat wa-buldanihim) That is the last of the Categories but it is not the last of what is possible in that regard. The science of hadith can be divided into countless categories, since the states and characteristics of hadith transmitters and the states and characteristics of hadith texts are endless. Every one of these states and characteristics deserves to be mentioned separately and requires its own specialists — for each is a Category in its own right - but that would be an endless task. God is enough for us and an excellent protector. Category 1 Sound HadIth i (Ma c rifat al-sahih min al-hadith) Know - may God enlighten you and me - that hadith, in the view of the scholars of this discipline, fall into the divisions of \"sound\" (sahih), \"fair\" (hasan) and \"weak\" {daHj). The sound hadith is a \"supported\" hadith {al-hadith al-musnad), the isnad of which coheres continuously through the transmission of one upright and accurate person from another up to its point of termination. The sound hadith can be neither \"anomalous\" (shadhdh) nor \"defective\" (mu c allal). These descriptions exclude the \"loose\" (mursal)^ \"interrupted\" {munqafi% \"problematic\" (mu^dal) and anomalous hadith; the hadith containing an impairing defect {Hlla)\\ and the hadith the transmitter of which suffers from any variety of discreditation (jarh) - these are Categories which will be discussed below, God (He is blessed and exalted) willing. This is the hadith which is indisputably judged to be sound among the scholars of hadith. Sometimes the scholars of hadith differ over the soundness of certain hadith, either because of their disagreement over whether these characteristics are found in them or because of their disagreement in stipulating the necessity of some of these characteristics, as in the case of the loose hadith. When they say, \"This is a sound hadith,\" what is meant is that its support (samd) is cohesive and it possesses the rest of the aforementioned characteristics. The standard of the sound hadith does not require that it be definite that the hadith is sound in reality, since this standard admits the hadith that a single upright transmitter is alone in relating and this type of hadith is not one of the reports (akhbar) which the Community unanimously agreed to receive with acceptance. In the same way, when they say regarding a hadith that it is \"unsound,\" this is not a definite statement that it is actually a falsehood, since it may in reality be a truth. All that is meant is that its isnad is not sound according to the aforementioned standard. God knows best. Some Important Notes L Sound hadith fall into the categories of \"agreed upon\" {muttafaq c alayhi) and \"disputed\" {mukhtalaf fihi) y as was noted above, and they also fall into the categories of \"well known\" {mashhur) and \"rare\" {gharib), and categories in between. The grades of sound hadith vary in potency according to the degree that the hadith possesses the aforementioned characteristics upon which soundness is based. In view of this, sound hadith can be divided into innumerable subcategories. For this reason, we think it is better to refrain from judging any isnad or hadith to be the absolutely most sound^ although a number of the authorities in hadith have ventured into that morass and their opinions were therefore contradictory. 6 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE liADITH We heard 1 that Ishaq b, Rahawayh 2 said, \"The soundest of all isnads is Zuhri 3 from Salim* from his father.\" 5 We also heard something similar from Ahmad b. HanbaL 6 We heard that c Amr b. c All aLFallas 7 said, 'The soundest isnad is Muhammad b. Sinn* from 'Ablda\" from c All. MI ° We heard something similar from 'All b. aI-MadfnI J ' and this view was related from others as well. There are some who specify the transmitter from Muhammad [b. Slrln], some making him AyyQb al-Sakhtiyanl 12 and others Ibn c Awn. IJ One of the things we hear from Yahya b. Ma c ln 14 is that he 1 Ruwina: In his TabaqUt al-fuqakiP al-ShafiHya (ed. Muhyl al-Dln <Ali Najlb, 2 vols, Beirut, 1413/1992, 1:77), Ibn al-§alah explained that he used this term in the instances where he had an isnad which for the sake of brevity he did not reproduce.

His hadlth criticism and legal opinions have been collected in a number of works and a very large collection of hadlth, called \"musnad\" is ascribed to him; EP, 1:272-7; Sezgin, GAS, 1:502-9. 7 AbQ Ilafs <Amr b. <AIl al-Fallas was born around 160/776 and died in 249/863; Dhahabl, Styar, 11:470-72. 8 AbQ Bakr Muhammad b.

When, in the personal hadlth collections\" and other books which are in circulation, we encounter a hadlth sound in regard to its isnad, but we do not find it included in either of the two §ahlhs or designated as sound in any of the other well-known and authoritative compositions (mu}annafat) of the leaders in hadlth; we do not presume to judge it conclusively as sound. These days it is no longer feasible for someone to apprehend sound hadlth on his own by merely examining isnads. This is because in every isnad of that kind of hadlth you find among its transmitters someone who merely relied upon what was in his book in its transmission and lacked the level of retention, accuracy and exactitude stipulated for sound hadith. So, for the recognition of sound and fair hadlth, the matter reverts to relying on what the authorities in hadlth designated as such in their well-known and authoritative compositions, which have been rendered safe from alteration and corruption by the circumstance that they are widely known. The continuance of the chain of the isnad - by which this Community (may God augment its glory) has been distinguished - has become the principal reason for the circulation of isnads apart from [those in the authoritative collections]. Amen! 3 . Bukharl - that is, Aba £ Abd Allah Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari al-Ju'fi, a client of the JuTite tribe - was the first to compose a collection containing only sound hadlth. Abu '1-Husayn Muslim b. al-Hajjaj al-Nlsaburl al-Qushayri M - a member of the tribe of Qushayr - followed him. Although Muslim took hadlth from Bukhari and studied under him, he did share most of his teachers. 2 ' The books of Bukharl and Muslim are the soundest books after the august book of God [that is, the Qjirtfn]. The statement we repeatedly heard from Shafrt (God be pleased with him) - and others related it with different wording - : \"I do not know of a more correct book of religious knowledge in the world than the book of Malik [that is, al-Muwatfa'T was made by him before the books of Bukharl and Muslim came into existence. The book of Bukhari is the sounder of the two in regard to being a collection of sound hadlth and also the more useful. There is nothing wrong with the statement we heard from the expert Abu <All al-Hafiz 27 Apt* al-hadith: Tahanawi defines put (pi. apt*) as \"a book collecting the hadlth of a single individual;\" Kasfohaf isftlakSt al-funun, 2 vols ([Istanbul], 1317), 1:206. Students frequently gathered the hadlth of a particular transmitter in this form to bring to his class for audition and occasionally these works found their way into general circulation. Some of the most mwwnedjfe* are listed in Hajji Khalifa, Kashf, licols 583-90 and Muhammad b. Ja'far al-Kattanl, al-Risata al-mustatrafa bi-bayan mashhur kutub al-sunna al-mmharrafa, 3rd edn (Damascus, 1383/1963), 86-94. 28 In addition to his $ahlh (published several times), Muslim (d. 261/875) composed a number of important works on the study of hadlth, several of which will be mentioned in the course of the present translation; Ef, 7:691-2; Sezgin, GAS, 1:136-43. 29 From the fact that Muslim studied under Bukhari, the scholars of hadith would as a matter of course have inferred that Muslim belonged to the generation after that of Bukharl, rather than the same one, as was actually the case. IBN AL-SALAH AL-SH A H RAZU RI 9 al-Nisaburi 30 (the teacher of the expert Abu c Abd Allah al-Hakim 31 ): \"There is no book on earth sounder than the book of Muslim b. al-Hajjaj,\" and there is nothing wrong with the doctrine of the North African scholars who prefer the book of Muslim to that of Bukhart; if what is meant is that the book of Muslim is superior since no unsound hadith are mixed into it. After the introductory chapter of Muslim's book, only sound hadith are enumerated in it and they are not coupled with hadith like those occurring in the chapter headings of Bukharl's book for which he did not provide isn5ds meeting the standard stipulated for sound hadith. It does not necessarily follow from this that the book of Muslim is superior to the book of Bukharl in what pertains to the essence of a book of sound hadith. If what is meant by these views is that the book of Muslim is sounder as a book of sound hadith, it redounds against whoever says it. God knows best. 4. Bukharl and Muslim did not include all of the sound hadith in their Sahihs and they did not take it upon themselves to do that. In fact, we often heard* that Bukharl said, U I put into Kitab al-Jdmi* (Comprehensive Collection; that is, his Sahih) only what was established as sound and I left out some sound hadith for fear of prolixity.\" We heard that Muslim said, U I did not place here\" - that is, in his book, the §ahih - \"all of the hadith I consider to be sound. I put here only those hadith they accepted unanimously.\" 32 He meant - and God knows best - that he only put in his book the hadith which in his opinion met the standards of the hadith unanimously regarded as sound, even if in the opinion of certain people some of these hadith do not appear to meet these standards. The expert Aba c Abd Allah b. al-Akhram JJ said, \"Few are the well- established hadith that escape Bukharl and Muslim,\" - that is, in, their books. One should say that they are not few. Al-Mustadrak c ala 'l-Sahihayn 24 (The Supplement to the Two $ahlhs) of Abu c Abd Allah al-Hakim is a large book which includes a good deal of what escaped their notice. Even if an 30 AbQ <All al-Husayn b. 'All al-Nlsaban (277/890-349/960) was one of the great hadith scholars of his age and is best known, as this passage indicates, for being the mentor of al-Hakim al-Nlsabarl; DhahabI, Siyar, 16:51-9. 31 Aba <Abd Allah Muhammad b. <Abd Allah (321/933-405/1014), also known as al-tUkim al-NisabOrl and Ibn Bayyi c , was one of the most prolific authors on the subject of hadith during the fourth/tenth century. Two manuals of hadith from his pen have survived. The larger, Kitab Ma^rifat Hilum al-hadith, Ibn al-§alah used as a model for the Muqaddima. His shorter manual, al-Madkhal ila mcfoifat al-Iklil, has been edited and translated by James Robson (London, 1953); EP, 3:82; Sezgin, GAS, 1:221-2; EIr, 1:250-51. 32 Al-jfami< ahattik, & vols (Istanbul, 1329-33), 2:15 (K. al-Salat). 33 The sources ascribe a number of works with interesting titles to AbQ <Abd Allah Muhammad b. Ya<qub b. Yosuf al-Shaybinl al-Nlsaburi (250/864^344/955). Regrettably, none of them seems to have survived; Dhahabi, Siyar y 15:466-9. 34 4 vols (Hyderabad, 1334—42). 10 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH argument may be made against Abu c Abd Allah al-Hakim regarding some of his hadith, many of his sound hadith remain untainted. Indeed, Bukhari said, \"I have one hundred thousand sound hadith and two hundred thousand unsound.\" The total in his book Sahih is 7,275 hadith, including some repeated hadith. It has been said that with the omission of the . duplicates the total is four thousand. In their 35 opinion, however, this figure may include the accounts {athar) of the Companions and Followers, 36 and often a single hadith related with two isnads is counted as two hadith. The augmentation of the sound hadith beyond the contents of the two books: those who seek this should obtain their additions from the hadith clearly designated as sound in one of the famous, authoritative compositions of the leaders in hadith - like AbQ Dawud al-Sijistanl, 37 Abu ^sa al-Tirmidhl, 38 Abu c Abd al-Rahman al-Nasa*!, 19 Abu Bakr b. Khuzayma, 40 Abu 'l-Hasan al-Daraqutni 41 and others. For this, it is not enough that the hadith merely be found in the books of Abu Dawud, Tirmidhl, Nasa'I and the rest of those who brought together sound and other hadith in their works. In contrast, the mere presence of a hadith in the books of those of them who stipulate that the hadith they collect be sound — like the book of Ibn Khuzayma - does suffice. We regard in the same fashion the material found in the books providing versions of the hadith in the book of Bukhari and the book of Muslim (God be pleased with them) with variant isnads 42 - like the 35 The antecedent of this pronoun appears to be those who provided the figure of four thousand. 36 In the broadest sense, the Companions {$aftaba) were the early Muslims who had contact with the Prophet, although the exact form of contact required was disputed. The Followers {Tabten) were the students of the Companions; see EP y 8:827-9 and 10:28-30. These two groups are discussed in depth below, in Categories 39 and 40. 37 Abu Dawud Sulayman b. al-Ash'ath al-Sijistani (202/817-275/889) was the compiler of the famous Kttab al-Sunan (published several times); Ef, 1:114; Sezgin, GAS, 1:149-52. 38 The hadith collection of Aba <lsa Muhammad b. <Isa b. Sawra al-Tirmidhi (210/825-279/892) is commonly called al-J&mfi al-sahih, although Ibn al-$alah would prefer simply al-JamP. It is available in a number of editions; Ef, 4:796-7; Sezgin, GAS, 1:154—9. 39 Abu c Abd al-Rahman Ahmad b. Shu<ayb al-Nasa>l (215/830-303/915) was born in Nasa in Khurasan and traveled extensively, collecting and teaching hadith, before settling in Egypt. His famous tiadlth collection is now known as Kttab al-Sunan (published several times); £/ 2 , 7:969-70; Sezgin, GAS, 1:167-9. 40 AbQ Bakr Muhammad b, Ishaq b. Khuzayma al-Nisaburi (223/838-311/924) was a famous * expert in hadith. His Mukhiasar al-Mukhtasar min al-Musnad al-sahih is popularly known as Sahih Ibn Khuzayma (ed. Muhammad Mustafa al-A'zami, 2 vols, Beirut, 1391/1971); Sezgin, GAS, 1:601. 41 Abu 'l-Hasan <AlI b. Umar al-Daraqutnl (306/919-385/995) composed a hadith collection named Kitab al-Sunan (4 vols, Cairo, 1386/1966) and a number of other works concerning the study of hadith; EP y 2:136; Sezgin, GAS, 1:206-9. 42 Al-kutub al-mukharraja ^ala kitab al-Bukhari wa-kitab Muslim', Sakhawl defined \"istikhraj™ - the form of the word later scholars preferred to takhrij - as follows: \"An expert takes, for instance, the Sahih of Bukhari and he presents the hadith from it one by one with his own isnads, without stipulating for himself that the transmitters be reliable;\" Path al-Mughith, 1:39, IBN AL-SALAH AL-SHAHRAZURI 11 books of Abu c Awana aUsfaraylnl * Abu Bakr al-lsma'lll, 44 AbQ Bakr al-Barqam 45 and other works - which completes the abridged hadlth and provides commentary on many of the hadlth of the two Sahihs. A considerable amount of this kind of material is found in al-Jfam < bayn al-Sahihayn {The Union of the Two Sahlhi) of AbO c Abd Allah al-Humaydi. 46 The expert Abu c Abd Allah al-Hakim occupied himself with augmenting the number of sound hadlth beyond the contents of the two Sahihs. He collected [the fruit of his research] in a book he called al-Mustadrak in which he placed the hadlth not found in either of the two §ahihs which he regarded as meeting the standard of the two teachers [that is, BukhSri and Muslim] - that is, they had included material from the transmitters of the hadith in their book - or as meeting the standard of Bukhari alone or that of Muslim alone. In addition, al-Hakim included the hadith that his own efforts led him to regard as sound, even if they did not meet the standard of either Bukhari or Muslim. He is liberal in interpreting the standard of the sound hadlth and free in applying it. It is best that we take a moderate position regarding him. We say: A hadith he reckons to be sound, if we do not find it regarded as sound by any other authority, is, even if it is not sound, a fair hadith to be cited as a proof and acted upon, unless a defect positively determining its weakness appears in it. In this respect, the Sahih of Abu Hatim b. Hibban al-Busti 47 (God bless all of them) is similar to it. God knows best. 5. The books providing versions of the hadith in the book of Bukhari or the book of Muslim (God be pleased with them) with variant isnads; the authors of these books did not take it upon themselves to match Bukhari and Muslim in regard to the exact wording of the hadith without addition or omission. This is 43 The book of Abu c Awana Ya^Qb b. Ishaq al-Isfarayini (d. 316/928) was named al-Musnad al-mukharraj Wtf Kitab -Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj (published as Musnad Abi ^Awana, 2 vols, Hyderabad, 1362-3); Sezgin, GAS, 1:174. 44 The book of Abu Bakr Ahmad b. Ibrahim al-Isma'ili (277/890-371/981), al-Mustakhraj <ala 'l-Saftih, was based on Bukharl's work; Sezgin, GAS y 1:202. 45 Aba Bakr Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Barqani (336/948-425/1034) was a teacher of al-Khatib al-Baghdadi; EIr y 3:821. The title of the work referred to here seems to have been al-Jam* bayn al-$akihayn\\ see Hajjl Khalifa, Kashf l:col. 599. 46 AbQ <Abd Allah Muhammad b. Abi Nasr al-Humaydi (ca. 420/1029-488/1095) was an Andalusian scholar who traveled to the East and died in Baghdad; Brockelmann, GAL, 1:413, SuppL, 1:578-9; EP 3:573-4. For a description of h\\^Jam\\ see Hajji Khalifa, Kashf Ixols 599-600. 47 AbQ Hatim Muhammad b.

Shu<ayb al.Arna'at, 18 vols, 1408/ 1988); EP, 3:799; Sezgin, GAS, 1:189-91. j 12 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE H ADITH because in pursuit of elevation of isnad 48 they related these hadlth from sources other than Bukhari or Muslim and thus some variation in wording occurs in them. This is also the case with the hadlth authors included in their own independent compositions - like al-Sunan al-kabir {Great Book ofSunnas) of Bayhaql,\" Shark at-Sunna {Explanation of the Sunna) of Abu Muhammad al-Baghawl 50 and others - for which they say, \"Bukhari\" - or \"Muslim\" - \"included it.\" Nothing more may be inferred from that other than that Bukhari or Muslim included the archetype {a$l) of that hadith, it being probable that there is a difference in wording between the two versions. There may also be some variation in the meaning and I have in fact found some hadlth in which there is a degree of variation in regard to the sense. When that is the case, you may not transmit a hadlth from these books, saying, \"It occurs in this form in the book of Bukhari\" - or \"the book of Muslim\" - unless you compare its wording [with the version given by either Bukhari or Muslim to verify this] or the author who provides the version with the alternate isnad has said, \"Bukhari included it with this wording.\" These works differ from the abridgements of the two Sahihs. The authors transmit in their abridgements the wording of the two Sahihs, or that of one of them. However, one of these works, Humaydi al-Andalusi's al-Jam c bayn al-$ahihayn, does include additional supplementary material for some of the hadlth, as we mentioned above. Occasionally a person who does not know better transmits something he finds in this book as if it were from one or both of the Sahihs, and he falls into error because it is one of these additions not present in either of the two $ahihs. Two benefits are derived from the aforementioned versions with variant isnads of the hadlth in the two books [that is, the Sahihs of Bukhari and Muslim]. The first is elevation of isnad. The second is the augmentation of the extent of the sound hadlth by their additional words and their supplements to some of the hadith. The soundness of these additions is established by these variant versions, because these versions come with isnads established in one or both of the Sahihs and emanate from that well-established source. 51 God knows best. 48 <UIQjp atesnSd: The fewer intermediaries mentioned in an isnad, the more \"elevated\" it was considered; see below, Category 29. 49 AbO Bakr Aljmad b. al-Husayn al-Bayhaq] (384/994-458/1066) was an important Shafi'ite who wrote a number of works on hadlth, including his al-Sunan al-kabir (published as Kit&b al-Sunan aUkubra, 10 vols, Hyderabad, 1344-55); Brockelmann, GAL, 1:446-7, Suppl, l:6ia-19; EP, 1:1130. 50 Aba Muhammad al-Husayn b. Mas<Od b. Muhammad al-Baghawl (433/1042-516/ 1 122) was a pious scholar who worked hard to popularize the study of hadith. Shark al-Sunna (ed. Shu<ayb al-Arna'Ot and Muhammad Zuhayr al-Shawlsh, 16 vols, Damascus, 1390/1971 flf.) is one of his most famous works; Brockelmann, GAL, 1:447-9, SuppL, 1:620-22; EP, 1:893. 51 Sakhawl asserts that the mukkarrij was obliged to select the versions of the had»h with isnads which were identical to the original ones for as many links as possible, unless there was a compelling reason not to do so; Fatk al-Mugkith, 1:39. It has been asserted (pace Ibn al~$alah) IBN AL-SALAH AL-SHAHRAZORI 13 6, The hadith that Bukhari and Muslim (God bless them) provide with an uninterrupted isnad in their books: these beyond a doubt represent the material they judged as sound. There is doubt about some of the \"suspended\" hadith (mu c allaq); that is, the hadith with an isnad from the beginning of which one transmitter or more is omitted. The majority of these are in the book of Bukharl; there are very few in the book of Muslim. We should say: These and similar hadith which contain an expression decisively and conclusively indicating their ascription to the person from whom they are \"suspended\" - for example, \"The Messenger of God (Peace be upon him) said (qala) such and such,\" \"Ibn c Abb3s 52 said such and such,\" \"Mujahid* 3 said such and such,\" \" c Affan 5+ said such and such,\" \"Qa c nabl 55 said such and such,\" \"Abu Hurayra 56 related (rawa) such and such,\" and similar expressions - are judged to be established as actually coming from that person. On the basis of all of these expressions, it is determined that the person to whom Bukharl ascribed the hadith spoke and related [the text that follows]. Bukharl would not have deemed it permissible to state this [that is, to use these unequivocal expressions] without qualification unless it was established in his view that the hadith came from the person to whom it is ascribed. If the transmitter from whom the hadith is suspended is not a Companion, the judgement regarding the soundness of the hadith depends on the cohesiveness of the isnad between that person and the Companion. The phrases containing no decisive and conclusive indication in their wording - for instance, \"Such and such was related from (ruwiya c an) the Messenger of God (Peace be upon him),\" \"Such and such was related from X,\" \"On this topic we find such and such from ( c an) the Prophet (Peace be upon him),\" and similar expressions: none of them contains any decisive indication establishing it as coming from the person to whom Bukharl ascribed it, because expressions like these are also used with weak hadith. However, Bukhan's inclusion of this kind of hadith among the sound hadith provides an indication of the soundness of its archetype which one can be comfortable with and rely upon. (God knows best.) Indeed, few of Bukharl's suspended hadith fail to attain the standard of the sound hadith and in his book these are found in certain places in the headings that the soundness of the isnads of the alternate versions was confirmed only insofar as they were identical to those in the two Sahiks; W. Marcais, Taqrib y 9, n. 3. 52 Abu 'l-'Abbas ( Abd Allah b. c Abbas (d. ca. 68/687) was a Companion of the Prophet who was especially expert in the interpretation of the Qur'an; EP, 1:40-41; Sezgin, GAS, 1:25— 8. 53 Abu M-Hajjaj MujShid b. Jabr al-Makki (ca. 21/642-ca. 104/722) was best known as an expert in the Qur>an; EP, 7:293; Sezgin, GAS, 1:29. 54 Abu tUthman <Afifon b. Muslim al-$affrr (ca. 134/751-220/835) was born in al-Basra and taught hadith in Baghdad; Sezgin, GAS, 1:102. 55 Aba <Abd ai-RahmSn <Abd Allah b. Maslama aWja'nabi; (ca. 130/748^221/836) was a long-time student of Malik; DhahabI, Styar, 10:257-64. 56 The Companion AbQ Hurayra al-Dawsl (d. ca, 59/679) was a major transmitter from the Prophet. There is considerable controversy surrounding the other elements of his name; EP, 1:129. \\ 14 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF THE HADITH of the chapters, not in the substance of the book and its prime subject matter as indicated by the title he gave it, al-Jamfi al-musnad al-$alpih al-mukhtasar min utnUr Rasul Allah wa-sunanihi wa-ayyamihi {The Comprehensive Collection of Supported Sound Hadith Summarized from the Actions, Practices and Battles of the Messenger of God), The applicability of Bukharl *s statement, \"I put into Kitdb al-Jamfi only what was established as sound,\" goes back to the distinction which we explained. The same is true of the applicability of the statement of the expert Abo Nasr al-Wa^ll al-Sijz!, 57 \"Scholars, the jurists and others, unanimously agree that if a man had sworn to divorce his wife if not all of the hadith related from the Messenger of God (Peace be upon him) in the book of Bukharl were established as being authentically from him and said by him, there would no doubt about it: the man did not break his oath and the wife remains as before in his snare.\" This is also true of the statement of AbQ c Abd Allah al-Humaydi in his book al-Jam* bayn al-Sahfhayn, \"These two [that is, Bukharl and Muslim] are the only old authorities (God be pleased with all of them) we found who clearly expressed soundness to us in all of what they brought together.\" All of that refers to the substance and the prime subject of the book and the texts in the chapters, rather than the chapter headings and the like, because in some of these chapter headings there is material that is absolutely not sound. An example of this is Bukharl' s chapter on the hadith concerning the thigh where he relates from Ibn c Abb3s, Jarhad, 58 and Muhammad b. Jahsh 59 from the Prophet, \"The thigh is one of the privy parts.\" 60 Another example is his remark in the first of the chapters concerning the major ablution, \"Bahz b. Hakim 6 ' said from his father from his grandfather from the Prophet, \"God most deserves that one have shame before Him,\" 62 and this definitely fails to meet Bukharl 's standard. For that reason, Humaydl did not include it in his al-Jam*- bayn al-Sahihayn. So note that, for it is significant yet not readily apparent. God knows best. 57 The most important work of the anti-Ash<arite polemicist AbQ Nasr ^Ubayd Allah b. Sa<ld b. Hatim al-Wa>ili al-Sijz! was at-Ibana al-kubra, in which he argued that the Qui^an is uncreated. He died in 444/1052 in Mecca; Dhahabl, Siyar, 17:654-7. 58 Abu c Abd al-Rahman Jarhad b. Rizah (or Khuwaylad) al-Aslaml was a Medinese Companion who died in 61/681; Ibn <Abd al-Barr, al-htfab ft matrifat al-A$tt$b, ed. <All Muhammad al-BajawI, 4 vols (Cairo, n.d.), 1:270-71. 59 As a child, the Companion Aba c Abd Allah Muhammad b, c Abd Allah b. Jahsh al-Asadi joined his family in emigrating to Ethiopia. After their return to Mecca, they emigrated to Medina; Ibn <Abd al-Barr, htx^ab, 3:1373-4. 60 Kitab al-Jamt ahahih, ed. Ludolf Krehl and T.W. Juynboll, 4 vols (Leiden, 1862-1908), 1 : 105 (K. al-Salat, B. Ma yudhkaru fi 'l-fakhidh). 61 The hadith transmitter Abu ( Abd akMalik Bahz b. Hakim ai-Qurayshl died sometime before 1 50/767; Dhahabl, Siyar, 6:253. 62 Kitab al-JamP ahahih, 1:79 (K. al-Ghusl, B. Man ightasala c urySnan). IBN AL-SALAH AL-SHAHRAZCRI 15 7 Since the question of the recognition of sound hadith ultimately reverts to the material the authorities included in their compositions which are responsible for declaring them to be sound, as mentioned above, the need to direct our attention to the subcategories of sound hadith is, as a consequence, urgent. a. The sound hadith included by both Bukhari and Muslim. b. The sound hadith included only by Bukhari, that is, as opposed to Muslim. c. The sound hadith included only by Muslim, that is, as opposed to Bukhari. d. The sound hadith which meet the standard of both of them, but which were not included by them. e. The sound hadith which meet the standard of Bukhari, but which were not included by him. f. The sound hadith which meet the standard of Muslim, but which were not included by him. g. The hadith regarded as sound by others, but which do not meet the standard of either Bukhari or Muslim. These are the main subcategories. The highest is the first, and it is one which t"
