        "text": "In this article, we study some properties of anti-fuzzy sub-semigroup, anti fuzzy left (right, two sided) ideal, anti fuzzy ideal, anti fuzzy generalized bi-ideal, anti fuzzy interior ideals and anti fuzzy two sided ideal of regular semigroup. Also, we characterized regular LA-semigroup in terms of their anti fuzzy ideal.\n\nOur aim in this paper is to characterize anti-fuzzy subsemigroups,anti-fuzzy generalized bi-ideals and anti-fuzzy bi-ideals of a semigroup S. We define certain subsets of S, [0, 1] and Sx [0, 1]. The relationships between sets of anti-fuzzy points and the certain subsets of Sx [0, 1] are investigated. Some interesting characterizations of anti-fuzzy subsemigroups, anti-fuzzy generalizedbi-ideals and anti-fuzzy bi-ideals of semigroups are investigated by using the certain subsets of S, [0, 1] and Sx [0, 1].\n\nIn this paper the concept of anti fuzzy ideals of a Γ-semigroup has been introduced and some important characterizations have been obtained. Among other results a regular Γ-semigroup has been char-acterized in terms of anti fuzzy ideals. Finally we show that the set of all the anti fuzzy ideals of a Γ-semigroup forms a semilattice."
