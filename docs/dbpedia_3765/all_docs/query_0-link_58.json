        "text": "Conglomerates of Stopnik\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJoÅ¾e Äar\n\n2003-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In the area between Stopnik, [ebrelje and Pick of [ebrelje the Ladinian clastic, carbonate and volcanogenic rocks, in the thickness of more then 600 m, are very diversely developed. They are situated on diferent structural blocks bounded by the middle Triassicfaults and overlay partly eroded Anisian dolomite in the footwall. Variegated volcanogenic sedimentary rocks with conglomerate lenses comprising the middle part of the Ladinian succession in the broader sorounding of Stopnik are very important for paleogeographicinterpretation of the area. Ten conglomerate lenses were separated in the middle of volcanoclastic and volcanogenic rocks on the [ebrelje structural block. Cross sections of the conglomerate lenses are some 10 m to 550 m long and 15 to 60 m thick. Their axes arearranged in the direction NW-SE. In the lower and upper part of the lithological succession in the lenses prevail conglomerates with more ordered internal structure, denser packing of pebbles and more distinct bedding but in the middle part of the succession in lensesprevail sandy conglomerates and pebbly sandstones with less ordered internal structure, less denser packing of pebbles and less distinct bedding. The pebbles consist of diferent types of limestone, dolomite, volcanic rocks, tuffs, tuffaceous sandstone and conglomerate.They represent prevailing resedimented lower Ladinian rocks. The described sedimentary rocks are interpreted as a product of alluvial fan and fan delta sedimentary complexes, which were transgressively covered by tuffaceous muddy marine sediments passing intothe Cordevolian dolomite.\n\nThe underinvestment problem under conglomeration\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJacques A. Schnabel\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This theoretical paper explores whether the underinvestment problem is aggravated or ameliorated by the formation of a pure conglomerate. It establishes that the answer depends critically on the volatility of corporate assets. If volatility is low, conglomeration ameliorates the underinvestment problem, whereas if volatility is high, conglomeration aggravates the underinvestment problem. These analytical results are then invoked as a potential explanation for the ambiguous conclusions of empirical studies that delve into the existence of a conglomerate discount.\n\nMarket discipline and incentive problems in conglomerate banks\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nBoot, A.W.A.; Schmeits, A.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis paper analyzes the optimal conglomeration of bank activities.

Rounded pebbles in the conglomerates indicate substantial fluvial abrasion. ChemCam emission spectra at one outcrop show a predominantly feldspathic composition, consistent with minimal aqueous alteration of sediments. Sediment was mobilized in ancient water flows that likely exceeded the threshold conditions (depth 0.03 to 0.9 meter, average velocity 0.20 to 0.75 meter per second) required to transport the pebbles. Climate conditions at the time sediment was transported must have differed substantially from the cold, hyper-arid modern environment to permit aqueous flows across several kilometers.\n\nThe corporate centre in a financial conglomerate : governance under fundamental industry changes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFiole, Eelco Rokus Willem\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIn part 1, we discuss 1) the fundamental changes in the financial services industry, 2) financial conglomerate structures and 3) value-based-management.

It presents a strategic and economic analysis of diversification strategies and the growing interface between different types of financial firms. On the basis of a solid analysis of theoretical foundations and practical value, the book develops basic concepts of creating the future: especially solutions in managing risks and fresh ideas for the development of integrated financial services. The structure of the book is logical: starting on theoretical foundations (section 1, part A) and examining the economic value of All Finance and Financial Conglomerates (part B), leads to creating a concept for the future (part C). Case studies add additional practical value to this research. The review of the subject is completed by aspects of risk management in this sector and by political guidelines for the EU single market (section 2). The book builds further on ...\n\nSome metallogenic features of the Huronian and post-Huronian uraniferous conglomerates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRuzicka, V.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nUraniferous conglomerates with syngenetic mineralization are restricted to lower Proterozoic sediments. The depositional environment was near volcanic centres; excessive sulfur, a product a volcanic and postvolcanic activity, apparently caused sulfurization of some minerals and of hydrocarbon. The sedimentary syngenetic origin of uranium mineralization may be illustrated. The cycle starts with deposition of coarse grains of quartz, continues with the deposition of a mixture of finer grains of quartz and pyrite with distinct graded bedding, is followed by deposition of monazite and brannerite, and ends with deposition of fragmented fine grains of uraninite embedded in sulfur-rich hydrocarbon. This situation apparently testifies to the fact that the carbonaceous material is a product of algal mats that existed in quiet times between cycles of sedimentation. The succeeding cycle again starts with the deposition of coarse grains of quartz. Uraniferous conglomerates with epigenetic mineralization are localized in regions containing rocks with higher contents of uranium. Primary concentration of uranium minerals in these source rocks can also be syngenetic. Deposition of uranium took place by one or more epigenetic processes: adsorption, complexing, precipitation, or redox changes according to the degrees of solubility and stability of uranium compounds. Evidence of these mentioned features is based upon studies on the Huronian uraniferous conglomerate from Elliot Lake, Canada, and on the late Precambrian and Paleozoic radioactive conglomerates from the eastern Ural Mountains and Enisey Crest region, USSR\n\nUraniferous quartz-pebble conglomerates in South Africa\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nvon Backstroem, J.W.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to give a short background statement summarizing data on the Dominion Reef Group, the Witwatersrand Supergroup, and the Ventersdorp Contact Reef, with particular reference to the close relationship of gold and uranium with sedimentary features as well as the mineralization, conditions of deposition, and the nature of the quartz-pebble conglomerates\n\nCONGLOMERATE ROCKS \"BRECCIA VERDE ANTICA\" ARCHAEOLOGY, PETROLOGY, DETERIORATION AND TECHNOLOGY OF QUARRYING AT HAMMAMAT QUARRIES IN THE EASTEREN DESERT.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\ndr.HESHAM ABBAS KMALLY\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available One of the most interesting of the monumental rocks of Egypt is the green conglomerates of the Hammamat valley which was used for bowls, vessels, sarcophagus and other objects, from a very early period. The quarries of wadi Hammamat produced the green ornamental stone known in Roman period as \"Breccia verde antica\". Generally the ancient conglomerate was used occasionally in Egypt at pharaonic time and late period, but it was quarried chiefly by the Roman for export to Italy. The conglomerate rocks range from coarse to fine conglomerates. They are composed of great assortment of rock fragments such as meta-sediments, meta-volcanic and granites. Some pebbles of the coarse conglomerates are previously deposited conglomerates. Pollution, humidity or moisture, solar radiation, rainfall and groundwater represent important factors for disintegration of green conglomerate rocks. Many types of destruction have been noted such as micro-cracks, fractures, joints, exfoliation, crumbling, discoloration, leaching and staining with iron oxides. The conglomerate rock sometimes changes into fragmented, soft residual and parent matter of the soil. Moreover, individual grains of feldspar and quartz begin to become loosened and the rock shows superficial granular disintegration due to, growth of salts and physiochemical weathering\n\nCavitated Conglomerate Mass in Silicosis Indicating Associated Tuberculosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPedro Martins\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Silicosis is the most common occupational lung disease worldwide. It leads to respiratory impairment and may have associated infections that decrease pulmonary function. We describe the case of a 55-year-old man with chronic silicosis who presented with hemoptysis and a cavitated conglomerate mass. The final diagnosis was silicotuberculosis.\n\nEstimation of immune cell densities in immune cell conglomerates: an approach for high-throughput quantification.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNiels Halama\n\n2009-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Determining the correct number of positive immune cells in immunohistological sections of colorectal cancer and other tumor entities is emerging as an important clinical predictor and therapy selector for an individual patient. This task is usually obstructed by cell conglomerates of various sizes. We here show that at least in colorectal cancer the inclusion of immune cell conglomerates is indispensable for estimating reliable patient cell counts. Integrating virtual microscopy and image processing principally allows the high-throughput evaluation of complete tissue slides.For such large-scale systems we demonstrate a robust quantitative image processing algorithm for the reproducible quantification of cell conglomerates on CD3 positive T cells in colorectal cancer. While isolated cells (28 to 80 microm(2 are counted directly, the number of cells contained in a conglomerate is estimated by dividing the area of the conglomerate in thin tissues sections (< or =6 microm by the median area covered by an isolated T cell which we determined as 58 microm(2. We applied our algorithm to large numbers of CD3 positive T cell conglomerates and compared the results to cell counts obtained manually by two independent observers. While especially for high cell counts, the manual counting showed a deviation of up to 400 cells/mm(2 (41% variation, algorithm-determined T cell numbers generally lay in between the manually observed cell numbers but with perfect reproducibility.In summary, we recommend our approach as an objective and robust strategy for quantifying immune cell densities in immunohistological sections which can be directly implemented into automated full slide image processing systems.\n\nConglomerate memory and cosmopolitanism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSusannah Ryan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Under what conditions do countries and cultures considered radically different find a basis for allegiance and kinship? What part does memory play in this process? This article responds to these questions in two ways: 1 Through Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah Arendt, I propose that when an other appears in empathetic discourses that both honor difference and cite shared human experiences, seemingly irreconcilable people can develop a sense of mutual responsibility and 2 Conglomerate memory, memories that fuse together others through common pains, contributes to such an appearance. To illustrate this point, I turn to Congolese voices as they are articulated in online American discourses; although currently, authors of online texts typically rely on traditional narrative forms that position Central Africa as incommensurate to Western civilizations, the Internet's worldwide accessibility and intertextual capacities render it a place primed for developing international collectives by connecting memories while maintaining difference.\n\nGeological and Hydrodynamical Examination of the Bathyal Tsunamigenic Origin of Miocene Conglomerates in Chita Peninsula, Central Japan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTachibana, Toru; Tsuji, Yoshinobu\n\n2011-06-01\n\nA conglomerate appears on a rocky coast called \"Tsubutega-ura Coast\", located on the southwestern coast near the southern tip of the Chita Peninsula, Aichi Prefecture, central Japan. The conglomerate belongs to Miocene sedimentary rocks termed the Morozaki Group. The conglomerate includes meter-scale boulders, indicating that it was formed by an extraordinary event. In the geological investigation, we observed that the conglomerate shows alternate changes of paleocurrent directions between seaward and landward. This feature is supposed to be formed by tsunami currents. In the hydrodynamical investigation, we obtained following results: (1) the lowest limit of a current velocity to move a boulder of about 3 m in diameter would be about 2-3 m/s, (2) the speed of tsunami currents reproduced by tsunami simulation exceeds 3 m/s at 300 m in depth when the tsunami is generated by a gigantic earthquake with magnitude 9.0 or more, (3) the transport distance of the boulder would be several hundred meters to several kilometers by one tsunami event caused by a gigantic earthquake. We conclude that tsunamis best explain the formation of the conglomerate deposited in upper bathyal environments about 200-400 m depth, both from geological and hydrodynamical viewpoints.\n\nEogenetic caves in conglomerate: an example from Udin BorÅ¡t, Slovenia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLipar Matej\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Udin BorÅ¡t is a karstified terrace of carbonate rock, which is of fluvioglacial origin, and is situated in the north-western part of Slovenia. There are 15 registered caves, which have been interpreted as caves in conglomerate, while karst of Udin BorÅ¡t itself was interpreted as conglomerate karst, shallow karst or isolated karst. In this article, caves in Udin BorÅ¡t have been interpreted as eogenetic caves. Based on porosity and bedding material, different types of caves and cave passages have developed. Four general types of eogenetic caves found in Udin BorÅ¡t are; linear stream caves, shelter caves, breakdown caves and vadose shafts.\n\nNinety years of mining and metallurgy in TrepÄa-sever conglomerate (part I\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNikoliÄ Branislav\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Present company TrepÄa-Sever is formed by foreigners after the bombing of Serbia and Monten former TrepÄa Conglomerate located in northern part of Kosovo and Metohija, namely in three municipalities: North Kosovska Mitrovica, ZveÄan and LeposaviÄ.

In LeposaviÄ flotation, ores of Kopaonik mines are processed, while financial and commercial services are located in the North Kosovska Mitrovica.\n\nUltrastructure and electrophoretic protein pattern of a nuclear fraction enriched in interchromatin granule conglomerations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKrzyzowska-Gruca, S.; Zborek, A.; Gruca, S.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nRats were injected with a cytostatic 1-nitro-9/3'-dimethylpropyloamine/acridine.2HCl to induce aggregation of interchromatin granules (IG). The conglomerations of IG were well preserved in isolated liver nuclei and in nuclear structures deprived of chromatin. This feature enabled obtaining a nuclear fraction enriched in IG. The method consisted in extraction of isolated nuclei with a non-ionic detergent and digestion with DNase I in a high ionic strength. Each step of isolation was ultrastructurally monitored using both the routine electron microscopy as well as a preferential staining of IG with bismuth. Presence of spots of tightly packed granules within IG conglomerations in the final fraction like in the nuclei in situ was a good ultrastructural marker of IG. The resulting fraction consisted predominantly of IG conglomerations. Their preferential staining with bismuth was well preserved. Minute amounts of fibrillar material originating from nuclear matrix and residual nuclei could be observed. Protein composition of the fraction enriched in IG was studied by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrotransfer, nitrocellulose filters were fixed with glutaraldehyde and stained with bismuth method in order to identify IG proteins. The results of ultrastructural and cytochemical studies in comparison to electrophoretic protein pattern are discussed.\n\nUnderstanding the unusual reorganization of the nanostructure of a dark conglomerate phase\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nNagaraj, M.; Jones, J.

Final report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nButton, A.; Adams, S.S.\n\n1981-03-01\n\nThis report is concerned with Precambrian uraniferous conglomerates. This class of deposit has been estimated to contain between approximately 16 and 35 percent of the global uranium reserve in two rather small areas, one in Canada, the other in South Africa. Similar conglomerates, which are often gold-bearing, are, however, rather widespread, being found in parts of most Precambrian shield areas. Data have been synthesized on the geologic habitat and character of this deposit type. The primary objective has been to provide the most relevant geologic observations in a structural fashion to allow resource studies and exploration to focus on the most prospective targets in the shortest possible time.\n\nGeology and recognition criteria for uranium deposits of the quartz-pebble conglomerate type.

The minimum age of the Rainy River Conglomerate is constrained by the 147 +2 -1 Ma (Latest Jurassic) emplacement age of the One Mile Gabbronorite (new name: previously western Buller Diorite). The ages and chemistry of five of the granitoid clasts are broadly compatible with derivation from rocks that are now represented by Triassic plutons of the Median Tectonic Zone (Median Batholith), although ages as young as 180 Ma are slightly outside the range of the latter as currently exposed in New Zealand. The age (273-290 Ma, 237 +/- 3 Ma) and chemistry of the other two clasts (one each from Rainy River Conglomerate and Barretts Formation) suggest derivation from the Brook Street Terrane. Similarity in stratigraphic age, depositional characteristics, granitoid clast ages and composition between Rainy River Conglomerate and Barretts Formation suggests that they are broadly correlative and collectively overlapped a combined Brook Street Terrane - Median Batholith (MTZ) before the Late Jurassic (147 +2 -1 Ma). Sedimentary overlap may also have continued across to Middle Jurassic conglomeratic strata in the Murihiku Terrane to the east of the Brook Street Terrane. A U-Pb zircon age of 261 +/- 2 Ma is reported for Pourakino Trondhjemite of the Brook Street Terrane.

There are real-world applications of this problem in various disciplines. Solving this problem is harder when there is occlusion among the elliptical objects, since in general these objects are considered as part of the bigger object (conglomerate. The solution to this problem focusses on the detection and segmentation of the precise number of occluded elliptical objects, while omitting all noninteresting objects. There are a variety of computational approximations that focus on this problem; however, such approximations are not accurate when there is occlusion. This paper presents an algorithm designed to solve this problem, specifically, to detect, segment, and count elliptical objects of a specific size when these are in occlusion with other objects within the conglomerate. Our algorithm deals with a time-consuming combinatorial process. To optimize the execution time of our algorithm, we implemented a parallel GPU version with CUDA-C, which experimentally improved the detection of occluded objects, as well as lowering processing times compared to the sequential version of the method. Comparative test results with another method featured in literature showed improved detection of objects in occlusion when using the proposed parallel method.\n\nThoughts about uranium-bearing quartz-pebble conglomerates: a summary of ideas presented at the workshop\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSkinner, B.J.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA summation of papers given at the Workshop on the Genesis of Uranium- and Gold-Bearing Precambrian Quartz-Pebble Conglomerates held at Golden, Colorado, on October 13-15, 1975, is presented. Seven pertinent topics, chosen by the author, are compiled from the several papers and are critically discussed. The time of formation of these deposits is between 3- and 2-billion years ago. The uraniferous conglomerates appear to be of fluvial origin and the known uranium reserves are plotted along an idealized fluviatile system. The source areas for the placers are related to 3 billion year old granites, greenstones and metamorphic rocks of the cratons - these most probably were located paleogeographically in a polar region. The role of diagenesis in the formation of uranium ores is discussed with respect to oxygen content of Precambrian atmospheres and of subsurface waters. The effect of subsequent metamorphism and recrystallization upon indigenous pyrites and kerogen is related. Finally characteristics of known uranium deposits are correlated to suggest a strategy to be employed while prospecting for undiscovered uranium ores.

Based on the situation that the region presents, the specific situation of the municipality of Berisso which is part of the conglomerate will be looked into, in order to carry out an in-depth analysis of these types of policies' effective implementation forms and strategies on the municipal level. The Permanent Home Survey (EHP - INDEC, information provided by the Municipality and documents on Employment Policies and Programs will be used in order to complete this work.\n\nOrnithopod and Sauropod Dinosaur Remains from the Maastrichtian Al-Khod Conglomerate, Sultanate of Oman\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnn S.

The very fragmentary state of preservation of the dorsal vertebra makes specific attribution difficult, but it shows remarkable similarities to the rhabdodontid dinosaurs Rhabdodon and Zalmoxes.\n\nSome aspects of the genesis of heavy mineral assemblages in Lower Proterozoic uranium-gold conglomerates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nClemmey, H.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nSome genetic models for Lower Proterozoic gold- and uranium-bearing pyritic conglomerates favour a modified placer origin in which low levels of atmospheric oxygen are used to account for the survival of uraninite and pyrite. There are many difficulties with such models. New evidence concerning the genesis of the deposits is derived from a clast of ferric iron clay thought to represent a precursor sediment of the Witwatersrand Basin. Reworking of such clays and transport of a magnetite and ferric clay assemblage with subsequent sulphidation, could account for the porous pyrites, the absence of magnetite and the lack of hydraulic equivalence of the mineral grains in the conglomerates. The presence of oxygen, as indicated by the ferric iron clasts, would account for the evidence of mobility of uranium and of gold and would enhance their extraction from source rocks; particularly the release of gold from a precursor auriferous iron formation source. It is suggested that some aspects of the genesis of uranium deposits of the Witwatersrand and Elliott Lake may be similar to those of the Phanerozoic 'Roll Front' ores involving interaction between oxidizing uraniferous groundwaters and previously sulphidized and reduzate facies sediments. (author)\n\nGenesis of uranium-gold pyritic conglomerates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMyers, W.B.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe ancient pyritic ore conglomerates have a common origin best exemplified by the Witwatersrand deposits. All contain detrital pyrite and uraninite, which are unstable in modern oxygenated environments and were deposited in a reducing atmosphere. The Rand reefs are not similar to modern gold placers. Placers result from the near incapacity of streams and currents to transport coarse gold. Placers as rich as Rand reef occur only in narrow paystreaks within 15 kilometers of a coarse-gold source. The board dispersion of gold in the reefs is due to solution transport of metal complexed as aurous sulfide, leached anoxygenically from crustal rocks, probably from sea-floor basalt, and precipitated by a slow reaction driven by the radioactive decay of detrital uraninite. Radiolysis of water on shallow marine unconformities resulted in diffusion of hydrogen to the atmosphere and a slight excess of hydroxyl free radical in the reef environment. The mild oxidizing tendency slowly dissolved uranium, precipitated gold, and oxygenated thucholite. These actions define a maturing process. A uraninite placer accumulating on an unconformity becomes progressively converted to a gold reef with little residual uraninite. The most mature reefs tend to grade toward the thucholite-seam type, very thin but exceedingly rich in gold. A combination of chemical attack and physical reworking accounts for the general thinness of mature reefs. Pyrite, like uraninite, decreases in abundance with increasing maturity; buffering by pyrite moderated the oxidative depletion of uranium. Where pyrite was scanty or absent, uraninite was completely dissolved by the effects of radiolysis and no ore formed\n\nINVESTIGATION OF CEMENT CONCRETE CONGLOMERATE SOLIDIFICATION PROCESS BY IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY METHOD\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS. N. Bandarenka\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available One of the most prospective directions in preservationÂ and increase of service live ofÂ road pavements is a construction ofÂ automobile roads with cement concrete surface. Modern tendencies for provision of road construction quality presuppose a necessity to control processes of solidification and subsequent destruction of the material while forming and using cement concrete conglomerate being considered as a basic element of the road surface.Â Multiyear practical experience of Â automobile road operation using cement concrete pavements reveals an importance for monitoringÂ such processes as formation and destruction of cement concrete materials. An impedance spectroscopy method has been tried out and proposed as a tool for solution of the given problem.Experimental samples of cement concrete have been prepared for execution of tests, graded silica sand and granite chippings with particle size from 0.63 to 2.5 mm have been used as a fine aggregate in the samples. Dependencies of resistance (impedance on AC-current frequency Â have been studied for samples of various nature and granulometric composition. The Gamry Â G300 potentiostat has been used for measurement of complex impedance value. A spectrum analysis and calculation of equivalent circuit parameters calculation have been carried out while using EIS Spectrum Analyzer program.Comparison of impedance spectra for the prepared cement concrete samples have made it possible to reveal tendencies in changing spectrum parameters during solidification and subsequent contact with moisture in respect of every type of the sample. An equivalent electrical circuit has been developed that Â characterizes physical and chemical processes which are accompanied by charge transfer in cement concrete conglomerate. The paper demonstrates a possibility to use an impedance spectroscopy for solution of a number of actual problems in the field of cement concrete technology problems. Particularly, the problems\n\nCross-sector diversification in financial conglomerates: simulations with a fair-value assets and liabilities model\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJacob A. Bikker\n\n2002-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Risk diversification is one of the many reasons for cross-sector mergers of financialinstitutes. This paper presents a fair-value type asset and liability model in order to identify diversification effects for financial conglomerates (PCs under various shocks. My analysis for the Netherlands reveals that diversification effects on PCs of especially interest rate shocks are very strong. In principle, substantial diversificationeffects argue for lower capital requirements for PCs. However, there are other non-negligible risks run by PCs to consider, namely contagion risk, regulatory arbitrage andcross-sector and TBTF moral hazard risks, which have not yet been quantified.\n\nStable isotope compositions of quartz pebbles and their fluid inclusions as tracers of sediment provenance: Implications for gold- and uranium-bearing quartz pebble conglomerates\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVennemann, T.W.; Kesler, S.E.; O' Neil, J.R. (Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor (United States))\n\n1992-09-01\n\nOxygen isotope compositions of pebbles from late Archean to paleo-Proterozoic gold- and/or uranium-bearing oligomictic quartz pebble conglomerates of the Witwatersrand district, South Africa, and Huronian Supergroup, Canada, were determined in an attempt to define the nature of the source terrain. The [delta][sup 18]O values of quartz pebbles within any one sample typically vary by [approximately] 4[per thousand] or more, but occasionally by as much as 8[per thousand], even for adjacent pebbles within the same hand specimen. In addition, adjacent quartz pebbles of widely contrasting [delta][sup 18]O values also preserve distinct isotopic signatures of their fluid inclusions. This overall heterogeneity suggests that the pebbles did not undergo significant oxygen isotope exchange after incorporation in the conglomerates. Therefore, oxygen isotope analyses of such quartz pebbles, in combination with a detailed investigation of their mineral and fluid inclusions, can provide a useful method for characterizing pebble populations and hence dominant sediment source modes. Comparison of values found in this study with [delta][sup 18]O values of quartz from Archean granites, pegmatites, and mesothermal greenstone gold veins, i.e., [delta][sup 18]O values of sources commonly proposed for the conglomerate ores, suggests that uranium is derived from a granitic source, whereas gold has a mesothermal greenstone gold source. Low [delta][sup 18]O values of chert pebbles (9[per thousand] to 11.5[per thousand]) relative to those expected for Archean and Proterozoic marine cherts (commonly [ge] 17[per thousand]) effectively exclude marine cherts, and therefore, auriferous iron formations and exhalatives, as likely sources of gold.\n\nStable isotope compositions of quartz pebbles and their fluid inclusions as tracers of sediment provenance: Implications for gold- and uranium-bearing quartz pebble conglomerates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVennemann, T.W.; Kesler, S.E.; O'Neil, J.R.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nOxygen isotope compositions of pebbles from late Archean to paleo-Proterozoic gold- and/or uranium-bearing oligomictic quartz pebble conglomerates of the Witwatersrand district, South Africa, and Huronian Supergroup, Canada, were determined in an attempt to define the nature of the source terrain.

Twenty-two samples from the three borehole cores were analysed in triplicate for twenty-six elements, and, including standards, a total of 2000 determinations were made. Statistical analysis of the results obtained for twenty-four elements shows a successful back-classification of 98 per cent, whereas, if the conglomerates or quartzites are treated separately, 100 per cent success is obtained. When the present data are used for classification of the samples from the three cores analysed during the first phase of this project, 100 per cent accuracy of classification is achieved by use of only ten selected elements. The objects of this investigation have therefore been met successfully, and extension to further strata and to sampling beyond the confines of the mine is justified [af\n\nMicrodistribution of Thorotrast conglomerates in lymph nodes and radiation exposure of single lymphocytes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSteinstraesser, A.; Kemmer, W.; Muth, H.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nIn Thorotrast patients, chromosome aberrations of lymphocytes from peripheral blood are to be used as a biological dosimeter. To get a significant dose-effect relationship it is necessary to estimate the absorbed dose of a single lymphocyte during its exposure time. In individual cases only average values can be calculated, based on assumptions of special distributions of Thorotrast. At first effects of the size of Thorotrast conglomerates and of their space distribution on the Î±-radiation dose distribution in their surroundings are described in a model. Then this model is transferred to the real dimensions and the histological structures of lymph nodes bearing Thorotrast. In some individual cases the microdistribution of Thorotrast has been determined in lymph nodes. Some of these results are demonstrated. According to these Thorotrast distributions, calculation of real absorbed dose of lymphocytes are performed. These values can be used for setting up a dose-effect relationship for biological dosimetry\n\nThe clasts of Cretaceous marls in the conglomerates of the Konradsheim Formation (PÃ¶chlau quarry, Gresten Klippen Zone, Austria)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nÅlÄ czka, Andrzej; GasiÃ±ski, M. Adam; BÄ k, Marta; Wessely, Godfrid\n\n2009-04-01\n\nInvestigations were carried out on foraminiferids and radiolaria from redeposited clasts within the conglomerates of the Konradsheim Formation (Gresten Klippen Zone) in the area of the PÃ¶chlau hill, east of Maria Neustift. These shales and marls are of Middle to Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous age. In the latter clasts, foraminiferal assemblages with Tritaxia ex gr. gaultina as well as radiolaria species Angulobracchia portmanni Baumgartner, Dictyomitra communis (Squinabol), Hiscocapsa asseni (Tan), Pseudodictyomitra lodogaensis Pessagno, Pseudoeucyrtis hanni (Tan), Rhopalosyringium fossile (Squinabol) were found. In one block from the uppermost part of the sequence there is an assemblage with Caudammina (H) gigantea, Rotalipora appenninica and Globotruncana bulloides. However, the brecciated character of this block and occurrence near a fault suggest that it was probably wedged into the conglomerates of the Konradsheim Formation during tectonic movements. In pelitic siliceous limestones below the Konradsheim Limestone radiolarian assemblages of Middle Callovian to Early Tithonian age were found. They enable correlation with the Scheibbsbach Formation. In a marly sequence, above the conglomeratic limestone, the foraminiferal assemblages contain taxa from mid-Cretaceous up to Paleocene. The present biostratigraphic investigation confirmed the previous stratigraphic assignments and imply clearly that the sedimentation of deposits similar to the Konradsheim Formation also occurred at the end of the Early Cretaceous and deposition of conglomeratic limestones within the Gresten Klippen Zone, and especially within the Konradsheim Formation, was repeated several times during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.\n\nThe occurrence, origin and stratigraphic significance of bone-bearing mudstone pellet conglomerates from the Beaufort group in the Jansenville district, Cape Province, South Africa\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTurner, B.R.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe lack of useful lithostratigraphic markers in the Beaufort Group in the southern Karoo Basin has focused attention on the biostratigraphy of the sediments. As a result a more refined scheme of biostratigraphic classification is now possible which may prove useful in fixing the stratigraphic position of the uranium mineralized horizons. The most important mineralized horizon in the Beaufort West area (contains about 90 per cent of all known uranium occurrences) is associated with the Pristerognathus/Diictodon assemblage zone, but the way in which this relates to the important uranium occurrences farther east, between Graaff-Reinet and Jansenville, is uncertain because of the lack of biostratigraphic control. Vertebrate remains have recently been found in mudstone pellet conglomerates in Beaufort channel sandstones along the Bullrivier in the Jansenville District, in an area that is extensively mineralized. The sandstones were deposited as point bar sands within a meandering river system flowing towards the north-east. The rivers drained a dry, arid to semi-arid alluvial plain and were characterized by fluctuating discharge and periods of low or negligible flow. These conditions promoted flood scour and fill activity and the deposition of internal mudstone pellet conglomerates. Hydrodynamic considerations suggest that estimates of bone transport velocity from their hydrodynamically equivalent quartz sphere is of limited value and can seldom, if ever, be applied to fossil bone accumulations. Identification of the bones from the conglomerates indicates that they belong to the Dino-cephalia biozone and not the overlying Pristerognathus/Diictodon zone. This suggests that the lower part of the Beaufort succession (formerly the Tapinocephalus zone) extends farther east than previously thought, and that the main mineralized horizon in this area occurs lower down in the succession than that around Beaufort West\n\nThe straight line hypothesis elaborated: case reference obesity, an argument for acidosis, oxidative stress, and disease conglomeration?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerkemeyer, Shoma\n\n2010-07-01\n\nStudies report on the association between obesity and oxidative stress, with and without additional diseases. Macrophages in adipocytes, and hypoxia in adipose tissue have been suggested to explain how obesity can relate to oxidative stress. The straight line hypothesis using the lactic acid trap construct has been put forward to explain how proton imbalance can relate to obesity. Proton imbalance has been also reported to associate with the production of reactive oxygen species by inhibition of mitochondrial energy production. This review brings together existing literature and concepts to explain how obesity can relate to oxidative stress via protons, uniquely for itself or, as often observed, in conglomeration of additional diseases.

Paris\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Tsunamis related to volcano flank collapse are typically a high-magnitude, low frequency hazard for which evaluation and mitigation are difficult to address. In this short communication, we present field evidences of a large tsunami along the southern coast of Mauritius Island ca. 4400 years ago. Tsunami deposits described include both marine conglomerates and coral boulders up to 90 m3 (> 100 tons. The most probable origin of the tsunami is a flank collapse of Piton de la Fournaise volcano, RÃ©union Island.\n\nChemical composition of granite uraninites and of quartz-pebble-conglomerates-type uranium deposits: evidences for a placer-type origin for these deposits; Composition chimique des uraninites des granites et des gisements d'uranium de type conglomerats a galets de quartz: evidences pour une origine de type placer de ces gisements\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDuhamel, I.; Cuney, M.

These data display positive correlations between uranium enriching and that of thorium, rare earth notably. They compare the geochemical signature of uraninites of these conglomerates with that of granitoid uraninites of same age which could be their source. Measurements have been performed with an electronic microprobe for uranium oxide species and a ionic microprobe for rare earth contents. Different types of uranium-bearing minerals are identified which correspond to different mechanisms and origins of formation of uraninites\n\nMonitoring the fall of large atmospheric ice conglomerations: a multianalytical approach to the study of the Mejorada del Campo megacryometeor.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOrellana, Francisco Alamilla; Alegre, JosÃ© Ma Ramiro; Cordero PÃ©rez, JosÃ© Carlos; MartÃ­n Redondo, Ma Paz; Delgado Huertas, Antonio; FernÃ¡ndez Sampedro, Ma Teresa; Menor-SalvÃ¡n, CÃ©sar; Ruiz-Bermejo, Marta; LÃ³pez-Vera, Fernando; RodrÃ­guez-Losada, JosÃ© A; Martinez-Frias, Jesus\n\n2008-04-01\n\nCertain local atmospheric anomalies, such as the formation of unusually large ice conglomerations (megacryometeors), have been proposed to be a potential natural hazard for people and aviation, as well as geoindicators for fingerprinting larger-scale atmospheric environmental changes. On March 13th 2007, at approximately 10:15 am, an ice chunk weighing about 10 kg fell from the clear-sky and crashed through the roof (around 15 m) of an industrial storage house in Mejorada del Campo, a town located 20 km east from Madrid. The megacryometeor monitoring follow-up and the original investigation presented here includes, for the first time, both logistic and scientific collaboration between the Laboratory of the Environment, Criminalistic Service (SECRIM, the Spanish \"Guardia Civil\") and academic and scientific institutions (universities and the Spanish National Research Council). We propose that the management procedure of the incident, along with the detailed scientific research and combination of analytical methodologies in different laboratories, can serve as a protocol model for other similar events.\n\nPhotocatalytic degradation of clofibric acid, carbamazepine and iomeprol using conglomerated TiO2 and activated carbon in aqueous suspension.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZiegmann, Markus; Frimmel, Fritz H\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe combination of powdered activated carbon (PAC) and TiO(2) has been tested for synergistic/antagonistic effects in the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine, clofibric acid and iomeprol. Synergistic effects are thought to be caused by rapid adsorption on the PAC surface followed by diffusion to the TiO(2) surface and photocatalytic degradation. The Freundlich constant K(F) was used for comparing the sorption properties of the three substances and it was found that K(F) for clofibric acid was 3 times lower than for carbamazepine and iomeprol, regardless of the kind of PAC used. A PAC with a distinct tendency to form conglomerates was selected so that a high percentage of the PAC surface was in direct proximity to the TiO(2) surface. The photocatalytic degradation of the pharmaceutically active compounds studied followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Synergistic effects only occurred for clofibric acid (factor 1.5) and an inverse relationship between adsorption affinity and synergistic effects was found. High affinity of the target substances to the PAC surface seemed to be counterproductive for the photocatalytic degradation.\n\nA polÃ­tica bancÃ¡ria do regime militar: o projeto de conglomerado (1967-1973 The finance policy of military regime: the conglomerate project (1967-1973\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Pedro Macarini\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Este artigo examina a polÃ­tica bancÃ¡ria e financeira conduzida por Delfim Netto de 1967 a 1973, a qual se revestiu de caracterÃ­sticas especÃ­ficas.

It is examined the tendency to banking concentration, very intense in those years, as well as the acute centralization process which led to the constitution of financial conglomerates, thus transforming the financial structure in a way not foreseen by the banking and financial reforms of 1964. Both processes reflected the new course of economic policy since 1967, having as its major objective to induce the formation of a new form of private capitalist organization - the conglomerate, integrating banking and industry -, which would led to the consolidation of a segment of big national private firms. The article seeks to collect the available evidence about that strategic project developed during a phase of the military regime.\n\nDevelopment of cataclastic foliation in deformation bands in feldspar-rich conglomerates of the Rio do Peixe Basin, NE Brazil\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNicchio, Matheus A.; Nogueira, Francisco C. C.; Balsamo, Fabrizio; Souza, Jorge A. B.; Carvalho, Bruno R. B. M.; Bezerra, Francisco H. R.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this work we describe the deformation mechanisms and processes that occurred during the evolution of cataclastic deformation bands developed in the feldspar-rich conglomerates of the Rio do Peixe Basin, NE Brazil. We studied bands with different deformation intensities, ranging from single cm-thick tabular bands to more evolved clustering zones. The chemical identification of cataclastic material within deformation bands was performed using compositional mapping in SEM images, EDX and XRD analyses. Deformation processes were identified by microstructural analysis and by the quantification of comminution intensity, performed using digital image processing. The deformation bands are internally non homogeneous and developed during five evolutionary stages: (1) moderate grain size reduction, grain rotation and grain border comminution; (2) intense grain size reduction with preferential feldspar fragmentation; (3) formation of subparallel C-type slip zones; (4) formation of S-type structures, generating S-C-like fabric; and (5) formation of Câ§-type slip zones, generating well-developed foliation that resembles S-C-Câ§-type structures in a ductile environment. Such deformation fabric is mostly imparted by the preferential alignment of intensely comminuted feldspar fragments along thin slip zones developed within deformation bands. These processes were purely mechanical (i.e., grain crushing and reorientation). No clays or fluids were involved in such processes.\n\nDefinition of a magnetic susceptibility of conglomerates with magnetite particles.

One of productive approaches to definition of a magnetic susceptibility Ï of these particles consists in receiving experimental data of a susceptibility of disperse samples ã Ï ã with a disperse phase of these particles. The paper expounds and analyses the results of experiments on defining (by Faraday method in a magnetic field with intensity H = 90-730 kA/m) the magnetic susceptibility ã Ï ã of disperse samples (conglomerates) with a given volume ratio Î³ of magnetite particles (Î³ = 0.0065-0.25). The corresponding families of concentration and field dependences are provided alongside with discussing the applicability of linear and exponential functions to describe these dependences. We consider the possibility of defining single particles susceptibility Ï (with simultaneous obtaining field dependence of this susceptibility) by the commonly used relation Ï = ã Ï ã /Î³ both at relatively small (preferable for accuracy reasons) values Î³ - to Î³ = 0.02â¦0.025, as well as at increased values Î³ - up to Î³ = 0.25. The data Ï are provided depending on H and correlating with known data at H matter magnetic susceptibility Ïm (for the case when the particles are traditionally likened to balls with the characteristic for them demagnetising factor equalling 1/3) complies with the anticipated inverse function Ïm â¼ 1/H in the studied area H (where magnetization M expressed as M = ÏH reaches saturation M = Const).\n\nTwo-phase flow visualization under reservoir conditions for highly heterogeneous conglomerate rock: A core-scale study for geologic carbon storage.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Kue-Young; Oh, Junho; Han, Weon Shik; Park, Kwon Gyu; Shinn, Young Jae; Park, Eungyu\n\n2018-03-20\n\nGeologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is considered a viable strategy for significantly reducing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere; however, understanding the flow mechanisms in various geological formations is essential for safe storage using this technique. This study presents, for the first time, a two-phase (CO 2 and brine) flow visualization under reservoir conditions (10âMPa, 50âÂ°C) for a highly heterogeneous conglomerate core obtained from a real CO 2 storage site. Rock heterogeneity and the porosity variation characteristics were evaluated using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Multiphase flow tests with an in-situ imaging technology revealed three distinct CO 2 saturation distributions (from homogeneous to non-uniform) dependent on compositional complexity. Dense discontinuity networks within clasts provided well-connected pathways for CO 2 flow, potentially helping to reduce overpressure. Two flow tests, one under capillary-dominated conditions and the other in a transition regime between the capillary and viscous limits, indicated that greater injection rates (potential causes of reservoir overpressure) could be significantly reduced without substantially altering the total stored CO 2 mass. Finally, the capillary storage capacity of the reservoir was calculated. Capacity ranged between 0.5 and 4.5%, depending on the initial CO 2 saturation.\n\nQuartz-pebble-conglomerate gold deposits: Chapter P in Mineral deposit models for resource assessment\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTaylor, Ryan D.; Anderson, Eric D.\n\n2018-05-17\n\nQuartz-pebble-conglomerate gold deposits represent the largest repository of gold on Earth, largely due to the deposits of the Witwatersrand Basin, which account for nearly 40 percent of the total gold produced throughout Earthâs history. This deposit type has had a controversial history in regards to genetic models. However, most researchers conclude that they are paleoplacer deposits that have been modified by metamorphism and hydrothermal fluid flow subsequent to initial sedimentation.The deposits are found exclusively within fault-bounded depositional basins. The periphery of these basins commonly consists of granite-greenstone terranes, classic hosts for lode gold that source the detrital material infilling the basin. The gold reefs are typically located along unconformities or, less commonly, at the top of sedimentary beds. Large quartz pebbles and heavy-mineral concentrates are found associated with the gold. Deposits that formed prior to the Great Oxidation Event (circa 2.4 giga-annum [Ga]) contain pyrite, whereas younger deposits contain iron oxides. Uranium minerals and hydrocarbons are also notable features of some deposits.Much of the gold in these types of deposits forms crystalline features that are the product of local remobilization. However, some gold grains preserve textures that are undoubtedly of detrital origin. Other heavy minerals, such as pyrite, contain growth banding that is truncated along broken margins, which indicates that they were transported into place as opposed to forming by in situ growth in a hydrothermal setting.The ore tailings associated with these deposits commonly contain uranium-rich minerals and sulfides. Oxidation of the sulfides releases sulfuric acid and mobilizes various metals into the environment. The neutralizing potential of the tailings is minimal, since carbonate minerals are rare. The continuity of the tabular ore bodies, such as those of the Witwatersrand Basin, has allowed these mines to be the deepest in\n\nU-Pb ages in zircon of the Grao Mogol diamond-bearing conglomerate (Espinhaco supergroup): implications for the diamond origin in the Espinhaco range in Minas Gerais\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChaves, Mario Luiz de Sa Carneiro; Silva, Marcio Celio Rodrigues da; Babinski, Marly; Scholz, Rixcardo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Espinhaco Range in the Grao Mogol region, center-north of Minas Gerais state, is composed by fine grained quartzites with large cross stratifications (Resplandescente Formation), which are covered with erosional unconformity by monomictic conglomerates, and medium to coarse grained quartzites (Grao Mogol Formation), both units belonging to the Espinhaco Supergroup, of Proterozoic age. At the locality known as 'Pedra Rica' (signify Rich Rock, an old diamond digging), rocks of these formations were sampled and separated detrital zircons to acquire U-Pb by Laser Ablation Inductively LA-ICPMS) ages. The analyzed grains are rounded to slightly rounded and show oscillatory zoning. The obtained results indicate a maximum depositional age of 1,595Â±20 Ma for the Resplandescente Formation, and 1,052Â±50 Ma for the Grao Mogol Formation. The comparison between the obtained data and the available ages for the Diamantina region and proximities, in the same diamond province, indicates a strong evidence for the existence of at least two primary mineralizing events in the basin, in the age range of 1.35 to 1.05 Ga.

The northern source area is traditionally connected with the Silesian Ridge, whereas the position of the southern one is still under discussion. A source area situated SE of the Magura Basin supplied the Eocene pebbly para-conglomerates containing partly exotic material. The studied clastic material contains fragments of crystalline rocks, and frequent clasts of Mesozoic to Palaeogene deep and shallow-water limestones. Numerous mica schists, scarce volcanites and granitoids as well as gneisses, quartzites and cataclasites were found in the group of crystalline exotic pebbles. Monazite ages of \"exotic\" mica-schist pebbles from the Tylicz, Zarzecze and Piwniczna-Mniszek sections document the Variscan 310Â±10 Ma age of metamorphic processes. The provenance of these exotic rocks could be connected with a remote source area located SE of the Magura Basin, which could be the NW part of the Dacia Mega Unit. The idea is strongly supported by palaeotransport directions from the SE, the absence of material derived from the Pieniny Klippen Belt, the presence of shallow water limestones, typical facies of the Median Dacides belt and metamorphic age distribution proved by monazite dating.\n\nThe geological position, sedimentary record and composition of the Tylicz Conglomerate (Late Eocene-Oligocene): stratigraphical and paleogeographical implications (Magura Nappe, Polish Outer Carpathians)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOlszewska, Barbara; Oszczypko, Nestor\n\n2010-02-01\n\nDuring the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene the Magura Basin was supplied with clastic material from, non-existing today, source areas situated on the northern and southern margins of the basin. The northern source area is traditionally connected with Silesian Ridge, whereas the position of the southern one is still under discussion. The Upper Eocene-Oligocene pebbly mudstones of the Tylicz/Krynica facies zone contain exotic material derived from the south-Magura source area. The studied pebbles and clasts contain fragments of crystalline rocks, derived from a continental type of crust, and frequent clasts of Mesozoic to Paleogene deep and shallow-water limestones. Volcanites, rarely granitoides as well as schists, gneisses, quartzites and cataclasites were found in the group of crystalline exotic pebbles. The isotopic ages of \"exotic\" pebbles from the Tylicz section document a Variscan age of plutonic and metamorphic rocks. The composition of the Tylicz exotic conglomerates occupied the transitional position between the Jarmuta/ProÄ (Maastrichtian-Lower Eocene) and Strihovce (Eocene) exotic pebbles. The provenance of these rocks could be connected with Eocene exhumation of the SE sector of the Magura Basin basement. Another possibility can be explain by supply of siliciclastic material from a SE source area (Dacia and Tisza Mega-Units) and carbonate material from a S source area (ALCAPA Mega-Unit: Central Carpathian Block and Pieniny Klippen Belt).\n\nDiversification as a Circumvention Strategy to Institutional Constraints in China\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nXie, Peihong; Li, Xin; Wu, Sibin\n\nWhile unrelated diversification (i.e., conglomeration) is deemed value-destroying in the West, many Chinese private firms have been enthusiastically pursuing such a growth strategy. Conventional institutional view of diversification sees conglomerates as responses to market imperfections...... in emerging economies and believes conglomeration is value-creating because conglomerates can effectively fill the institutional voids in the emerging markets. Our literature review shows that the conventional institutional view on conglomeration mainly focuses on the value-creating aspects while neglects...... the socially counterproductive rent-seeking aspects of conglomeration strategy in institution-weak countries (Khanna & Palepu, 2000). In this paper, we fill the gap by examining some unconventional diversifications and point out their rent-seeking nature in China.

Within this stratigraphic sequence, the name Buttress Conglomerate was used to describe volcanic conglomerates at Porphyry and Buttress Points that contained rounded clasts of plagioclasephyric intermediate volcanic rocks. Stratigraphically, the volcanic conglomerate at Porphyry Point forms sharp contacts with the underlying Arnott Basalt (Haumurian) and overlying Tokakoriri Formation (Teurian). The volcanic conglomerate at Buttress Point, however, is entirely fault-bounded. Clasts from each unit were collected and U-Pb zircon dated using the TIMS and ELA-ICP-MS methods. A trachyandesite clast collected at Buttress Point gives an age of 96.9 Â± 1.6 Ma, whereas a rhyolite clast collected at Porphyry Point gives an age of 61.4 Â± 0.8 Ma. Petrological, geochemical, and stratigraphic data suggest that erosion of the clasts closely followed volcanism, and that these ages accurately reflect the depositional ages of the conglomerates. Conglomerates at Porphyry and Buttress Points have been formally renamed the Porphyry Point Member of the Tokakoriri Formation and the Buttress Point Conglomerate, respectively.

Their lithosomes are intercalated by claystones of late Thanetian (Zones P3 - P4, early Ypresian (Zones P5 - E2 and late Ypresian to early Lutetian (Zones E5 - E9 age. Claystone interbeds contain rich planktonic and agglutinated microfauna, implying deep-water environments of gravity-flow deposition. The basin was supplied by continental margin deposystems, and filled with submarine landslides, fault-scarp breccias, base-of-slope aprons, debris-flow lobes and distal fans of debrite and turbidite deposits. Synsedimentary tectonics of the SÃºÄ¾ov-DomaniÅ¾a Basin started in the late Thanetian - early Ypresian by normal faulting and disintegration of the orogenic wedge margin. Fault-related fissures were filled by carbonate bedrock breccias and banded crystalline calcite veins (onyxites. The subsidence accelerated during the Ypresian and early Lutetian by gravitational collapse and subcrustal tectonic erosion of the CWC plate. The basin subsided to lower bathyal up to abyssal depth along with downslope accumulation of mass-flow deposits. Tectonic inversion of the basin resulted from the Oligocene - early Miocene transpression (Ï1 rotated from NW-SE to NNW-SSE, which changed to a transpressional regime during the Middle Miocene (Ï1 rotated from NNE-SSW to NE-SW.

As deformation textures within clastic material reflect the variation and history of tectonization in the source region of a deposit, we outline a dating methodology that can provide details of the provenance's tectonomagmatic history from deformation-relative age distributions. The method involves bulk samples of solely granitoid clasts, as they are representative of the magmatic framework within the provenance. The clasts are classified and sorted into three subsets: undeformed, slightly deformed, and deformed. LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronology is performed on zircon separates of each subset. Our case study, involving the Permian Hongliuhe Formation in the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, analyzes each of the three clast subsets, as well as sandstone detrital samples, at three stratigraphic levels to yield a profile of the unroofed provenance. The age spectra of the clast samples exhibit different, wider distributions than sandstone samples, considered an effect of proximity to the respective provenance. Comparisons of clast data to sandstone data, as well as comparisons between stratigraphic levels, yield indications of key tectonic processes, in addition to the typical characteristics provided by detrital geochronology. The clast data indicates a minimal lag time, implying rapid exhumation rates, whereas sandstone data alone would indicate a 90 m.y. lag time. Early Paleozoic arc building episodes appear as Ordovician peaks in sandstone data, and Silurian-Devonian peaks in clast data, indicating a younging of magmatism towards the proximal provenance. A magmatic hiatus starts in the Devonian, correlating with the latest age of deformed clasts, interpreted as timing of collisional tectonics.

In the lower third of the formation, arkosic sandstone and conglomerate are interstratified with tuffaceous deposits. Some tuffs might have been deposited as primary, nonwelded to partially welded ignimbrites or fallout tephra. Many of the tuffaceous deposits represent redeposited material that formed tuffaceous sandstone, and many of these deposits contain arkosic grains that represent mixing of different source matieral. Arkosic sandstone, and especially conglomerate (some with maximum clast lengths up to 1 m), represent intermittent incursions of coarser plutoniclastic fan deposits into other finer grained and mostly volcaniclastic basin deposits. After deposition of the 18.78 Ma Peach Spring Tuff, the amount of tuffaceous material decreased. The upper two-thirds of the formation has arkosic sandstone and conglomerate interstratified with two olivine basalt lave flows. locally, conglomerate clasts in this part of the section have maximum lengths up to 1 m. Many tuffaceous and arkosic sandstone beds of the Spanish Canyon Formation have tabular to broad (low-relief) lenticular geometry, and locally, some arkosic conglomerate fills channels as much as 1.5 m deep. These bedforms are consistent with deposition in medial to distal alluvial-fan or fluvial environments; some finer-grained deposits might have formed in lacustrine environments.\n\nMicrobiological aspects of granular methanogenic sludge\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDolfing, J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe settling characteristics of anaerobic sludge are enhanced by the formation of microbial conglomerates.

A long-term, nationwide analysis from Switzerland.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nvon Wyl, Viktor; Beck, Konstantin\n\n2016-03-01\n\nCommunity rating in social health insurance calls for risk adjustment in order to eliminate incentives for risk selection. Swiss risk adjustment is known to be insufficient, and substantial risk selection incentives remain. This study develops five indicators to monitor residual risk selection. Three indicators target activities of conglomerates of insurers (with the same ownership), which steer enrollees into specific carriers based on applicants' risk profiles. As a proxy for their market power, those indicators estimate the amount of premium-, health care cost-, and risk-adjustment transfer variability that is attributable to conglomerates. Two additional indicators, derived from linear regression, describe the amount of residual cost differences between insurers that are not covered by risk adjustment. All indicators measuring conglomerate-based risk selection activities showed increases between 1996 and 2009, paralleling the establishment of new conglomerates. At their maxima in 2009, the indicator values imply that 56% of the net risk adjustment volume, 34% of premium variability, and 51% cost variability in the market were attributable to conglomerates. From 2010 onwards, all indicators decreased, coinciding with a pre-announced risk adjustment reform implemented in 2012. Likewise, the regression-based indicators suggest that the volume and variance of residual cost differences between insurers that are not equaled out by risk adjustment have decreased markedly since 2009 as a result of the latest reform. Our analysis demonstrates that risk-selection, especially by conglomerates, is a real phenomenon in Switzerland. However, insurers seem to have reduced risk selection activities to optimize their losses and gains from the latest risk adjustment reform.\n\nWavelet-Based Proc"
