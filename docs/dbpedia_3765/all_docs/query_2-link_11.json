The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency.

The new party is called the \"Social Democratic Party\" and\n\nits founding document says its establishment comes within the framework\n\nof the keenness to strengthen the institution of the modern state within\n\nthe boundaries of social constitutional democracy.\n\nThe document says: \"The party is considered a fundamental building block\n\nto move ahead towards the strengthening of democracy on the\n\nparliamentary and local levels, through establishing the practice of\n\ndemocracy based on wide-scale participation with the aim of serving the\n\nhomeland and the citizen, by adopting the approach of positive consensus\n\nbetween the different politicians within the framework of the\n\nconstitution and the higher interests of the country.\"\n\nThe document explained that the formation of the party, which holds the\n\nmotto of \"freedom, justice, development\" is considered an ambitious and\n\ncivilized national act that envisages contributing to national political\n\nwork in an environment of democracy.\n\nIt is worth noting that the party's founders include Syrian Parliament\n\nMember Muhammad Barmu, Syrian businessman Zahir Sa'd-al-Din, and some\n\nSyrian youths and intellectuals, in addition to Samirah al-Masalimah,\n\nformer editor-in-chief of Tishrin, and Syrian media figure Akram Khuzam.\n\nThe new party called for upholding the republican system in light of a\n\nconstitution that reinforces the civil, democratic, plural state, and is\n\naimed at achieving social justice, in a manner that would strengthen the\n\nunity of the national soil and guarantee the coherence of the Syrian\n\nsociety.\n\nIt is worth noting that many Syrian figures are preparing to announce\n\nthe formation of new political parties. The new parties law prohibits\n\nthe establishment of any party on a religious, tribal, regional, group,\n\nor professional basis, or on the principle of discrimination based on\n\nrace, sex, or colour. Moreover, the party is prohibited from being a\n\nbranch or affiliated with any non-Syrian party or political\n\norganization.\n\nWithin the context of the western pressures exerted on the Syrian\n\nregime, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on the \"states\n\nthat continue to buy Syrian oil and gas, the countries that continue to\n\nsend arms to Al-Asad, and the countries that provide political and\n\neconomic support to Al-Asad to enable him to carry out his barbaric\n\noperations to make decisions that will allow them to enter history from\n\nthe correct door.\"\n\nIn a news conference with her Norwegian counterpart Jonas Gahr Stoere in\n\nWashington, Clinton responded to a question on the progress Washington\n\nhas made in convincing Europe, India, or China to limit their relations\n\nin the field of energy with Syria by saying \"watch us\" and you will know\n\nthe developments.\n\nMost of Syria's hard currency revenues come from the oil industry, which\n\nproduces 380,000 barrels per day. She repeated that \"President Al-Asad\n\nhas lost the legitimacy to command the country, and it is obvious that\n\nSyria is better off without him,\" according to her. She emphasized that\n\nthe United States is keen on obtaining a global reaction \"so that no one\n\nwithin the Syrian regime can claim that the United States alone or the\n\nwest is leading the campaign against Damascus,\" adding that \"rather, the\n\nentire world\" will lead the campaign.\n\nCommercial sources in London had said to Reuters that the Swiss\n\ncompanies Vitol and Trafigura for oil trade are supplying Syria with\n\noil. Some commercial sources who are aware of these deals said that the\n\nSyrian oil marketing company, SYTOL, has agreed to purchase two\n\nshipments of petrol, each 30,000 tons, one from Vitol and the other from\n\nTrafigura, in a bid on the oil market that was closed this week.\n\nFor its part, the Netherlands has announced that it is applying to the\n\nEuropean Union to impos e tougher sanctions on Syria by adding the names\n\nof other individuals to the list of sanctions and imposing restrictions\n\non companies owned by the state. Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal\n\nsaid in a statement: \"We must cut off the oxygen from the regime by\n\npursuing profitable companies owned by the state in the banking and\n\ntelecommunication sectors.\" He considered that \"Al-Asad has lost\n\nlegitimacy.\"\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a news conference with\n\nhis Egyptian counterpart Muhammad Kamil Amr in Berlin: \"Germany is one\n\nof the states with international interests which supports imposing\n\nsanctions and pressures others to impose sanctions, because reaching a\n\npolitical solution also means that the pressure on the government will\n\nnot decline, but increase. Therefore, we will look closely into\n\nClinton's suggestions.\" He reiterated that Syria \"will be a better place\n\nwithout Al-Asad.\"\n\nFor his part, Amr said: \"We believe that there is no military or\n\nsecurity solution for the situation in Syria. The solution must be\n\nthrough negotiations and through dialogue with all sides. The truth is\n\nthat the Syrian leadership proposed very reasonable conditions for the\n\nnegotiations at the beginning, such as the cancellation of the emergency\n\nlaw, starting to write a new constitution, and starting national\n\ndialogue. However, unfortunately these positive principles were\n\naccompanied by the rise in violence. Shedding blood is unacceptable. We\n\nhope that they will put an immediate end to the bloodshed, and we hope\n\nthat a sound process for national dialogue will start with specific\n\ndates in order to fulfil the peoples' desire for freedom and dignity.\"\n\nSource: Al-Manar Television website, Beirut, in Arabic 0000 gmt 13 Aug\n\n11\n\nBBC Mon ME1 MEEauosc 160811 jn\n\n(c) Copyright British Broadcasting Corporation 2011\n\n--\n\nChris Farnham\n\nSenior Watch Officer, STRATFOR\n\nAustralia Mobile: 0423372241\n\nEmail: chris.farnham@stratfor.com\n\nwww.stratfor.com"
