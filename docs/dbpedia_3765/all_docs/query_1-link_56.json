        "text": "Neoproterozoic Evolution and NajdâRelated Transpressive Shear Deformations Along Nugrus Shear Zone, South Eastern Desert, Egypt (Implications from FieldâStructural Data and AMSâTechnique)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHagag, W.; Moustafa, R.; Hamimi, Z.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe tectonometamorphic evolution of Nugrus Shear Zone (NSZ) in the south Eastern Desert of Egypt was reevaluated through an integrated study including field-structural work and magnetofabric analysis using Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) technique, complemented by detailed microstructural investigation. Several lines of evidence indicate that the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust within this high strain zone suffered an impressive tectonic event of left-lateral transpressional regime, transposed the majority of the earlier formed structures into a NNW to NW-directed wrench corridor depicts the northwestern extension of the Najd Shear System (NSS) along the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The core of the southern Hafafit dome underwent a high metamorphic event ( M 1) developed during the end of the main collisional orogeny in the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). The subsequent M 2 metamorphic event was retrogressive and depicts the tectonic evolution and exhumation of the Nugrus-Hafafit area including the Hafafit gneissic domes, during the origination of the left-lateral transpressive wrench corridor of the NSS. The early tectonic fabric within the NSZ and associated highly deformed rocks was successfully detected by the integration of AMS-technique and microstructural observations. Such fabric grain was checked through a field-structural work. The outcomes of the present contribution advocate a complex tectonic evolution with successive and overlapped deformation events for the NSZ.\n\nGeophysical investigations of a geothermal anomaly at Wadi Ghadir, eastern Egypt\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMorgan, P.; Boulos, F. K.; Hennin, S. F.; El-Sherif, A. A.; El-Sayed, A. A.; Basta, N. Z.; Melek, Y. S.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nDuring regional heat flow studies a geothermal anomaly was discovered approximately 2 km from the Red Sea coast at Wadi Ghadir, in the Red Sea Hills of Eastern Egypt. A temperature gradient of 55 C/km was measured in a 150 m drillhole at this location, indicating a heat flow of approximately 175 mw/sqm, approximately four times the regional background heat flow for Egypt. Gravity and magnetic data were collected along Wadi Ghadir, and combined with offshore gravity data, to investigate the source of the thermal anomaly. Magnetic anomalies in the profile do not coincide with the thermal anomaly, but were observed to correlate with outcrops of basic rocks. Other regional heat flow and gravity data indicate that the transition from continental to oceanic type lithosphere occurs close to the Red Sea margin, and that the regional thermal anomaly is possibly related to the formation of the Red Sea.\n\nHydrogeochemical evolution of inland lakesâ water: A study of major element geochemistry in the Wadi El Raiyan depression, Egypt\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMohamed, Essam A.; El-Kammar, Ahmed M.; Yehia, Mohamed M.; Abu Salem, Hend S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWadi El Raiyan is a great depression located southwest of Cairo in the Western Desert of Egypt. Lake Qarun, located north of the study area, is a closed basin with a high evaporation rate. The source of water in the lake is agricultural and municipal drainage from the El Faiyum province. In 1973, Wadi El Raiyan was connected with the agricultural wastewater drainage system of the Faiyum province and received water that exceeded the capacity of Lake Qarun. Two hydrogeological regimes have been established in the area: (i) higher cultivated land and (ii) lower Wadi El Raiyan depression lakes. The agricultural drainage water of the cultivated land has been collected in one main drain (El Wadi Drain) and directed toward the Wadi El Raiyan depression, forming two lakes at different elevations (upper and lower). In the summer of 2012, the major chemical components were studied using data from 36 stations distributed over both hydrogeological regimes in addition to one water sample collected from Bahr Youssef, the main source of freshwater for the Faiyum province. Chemical analyses were made collaboratively. The major ion geochemical evolution of the drainage water recharging the El Raiyan depression was examined. Geochemically, the Bahr Youssef sample is considered the starting point in the geochemical evolution of the studied surface water. In the cultivated area, major-ion chemistry is generally influenced by chemical weathering of rocks and minerals that are associated with anthropogenic inputs, as well as diffuse urban and/or agricultural drainage. In the depression lakes, the water chemistry generally exhibits an evaporation-dependent evolutionary trend that is further modified by cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate minerals.

Seven species were previously recorded from Egypt: M. magna (Invrea, 1965), M. mahunkai Argaman, 1994, M. morawitzi (Radoszkowski, 1888), M. nigriventris (Invrea, 1960), M. nitida (Bischoff, 1920), M. savignyi (Klug, 1829) and M. sinaica (Invrea, 1963). Macroocula brothersi Gadallah & Soliman, sp. nov. (Egypt, Wadi Shab, Red Sea) and M. salehi Gadallah & Soliman, sp. nov. (Egypt, Wadi Shaghab, Aswan) are described and illustrated. The subspecies M. nitida nitida (Bischoff, 1920) and M. nitida patrizii (Invrea, 1932) are raised to species level. An illustrated key and a faunistic list of Macroocula species are given.\n\nNature of the Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary in Sinai, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nObaidalla, Nageh A.; Abdel-Maksoud, Nasr A.; Hosny, Atef M.; Mahfouz, Kamel H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe P/E boundary is studied at eight stratigraphic sections in Sinai, Egypt, which are nearly distributed in a stratigraphic profile from north to south as follows: Al-Hasanah, Sudr Al-Hitan, Wadi Sudr, Al-Thamad, Abu Qada, Wadi Matulla, Wadi Nukhul and Wadi Feiran. This study includes field, litho- and bio-stratigraphic analyses that enabled to delineate several hiatuses which may be due to the occurrence of tectonic activity that may be related to the echo of the Syrian Arc Orogeny at the P/E boundary. Generally, in Egypt the P/E boundary is marked by the occurrence of distinctive five beds, named by El Dababiya Quarry Member. At Wadi Nukhul, Wadi Matulla and Wadi Feiran sections, El Dababiya Quarry Member is well represented and the P/E boundary is conformable and resembles the GSSP section. Although El Dababiya Quarry Member is represented at Al-Hasanah section, the P/E boundary is marked by the occurrence of a minor hiatus at the end of Paleocene. Moreover, at Al Thamad section, El Dababiya Quarry Member is partially represented. On the other hand, at Sudr Al-Hitan, Wadi Sudr and Abu Qada sections, El Dababiya Quarry Member is completely absent due to a major hiatus.\n\nFlash Floods Simulation Using a Physical based hydrological Model at the Eastern Nile Basin: Case studies; Wadi Assiut, Egypt and Wadi Gumara, Lake Tana, Ethiopia.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaber, M.; Sefelnasr, A.; Yilmaz, K. K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFlash flood is a natural hydrological phenomenon which affects many regions of the world. The behavior and effect of this phenomenon is different from one region to the other regions depending on several issues such as climatology and hydrological and topographical conditions at the target regions. Wadi assiut, Egypt as arid environment, and Gumara catchment, Lake Tana, Ethiopia, as humid conditions have been selected for application. The main target of this work is to simulate flash floods at both catchments considering the difference between them on the flash flood behaviors based on the variability of both of them. In order to simulate the flash floods, remote sensing data and a physical-based distributed hydrological model, Hydro-BEAM-WaS (Hydrological River Basin Environmental Assessment Model incorporating Wadi System) have been integrated used in this work. Based on the simulation results of flash floods in these regions, it was found that the time to reach the maximum peak is very short and consequently the warning time is very short as well. It was found that the flash floods starts from zero flow in arid environment, but on the contrary in humid arid, it starts from Base flow which is changeable based on the simulated events. Distribution maps of flash floods showing the vulnerable regions of these selected areas have been developed. Consequently, some mitigation strategies relying on this study have been introduced. The proposed methodology can be applied effectively for flash flood forecasting at different climate regions, however the paucity of observational data.\n\nWadi el-Sheikh: A new archaeological investigation of ancient Egyptian chert mines\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article provides an overview of the first results from archaeological investigations at Wadi el-Sheikh in Egypt by the University of Vienna Middle Egypt Project. Chert was an important raw material used to produce tools, implements and jewelry in ancient times. Wadi el-Sheikh was exploited over thousands of years as it was probably the most important source of chert in Pharaonic civilization. The results of our new investigations that involved surveys and test excavations indicate the presence of large scale mining activities in the first half of the 3rd Millennium B.C.E. which allow for detailed insights into the amount of raw material extracted, the mining methods used and the lithic products manufactured in this area. These aspects are contextualized on the background of ancient Egyptian state-organized resource acquisition strategies and economy.

That is widely used geophysical tool for the purpose of assessing the groundwater potential and siting the best locations for boreholes in the unconfined Nubian Sandstone aquifers within the study area. This has been done using thirteen 1D Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) surveys. 1D-VES surveys provide only layered model structures for the subsurface and do not provide comprehensive information for interpreting the structure and extent of subsurface hydro-geological features. The integration of two-dimensional (2D) geophysical techniques for groundwater prospecting has been done to provide a more detailed identification for the subsurface hydro-geological features from which potential sites for successful borehole locations are recognized. In addition, five magnetic profiles were measured for basement depth determination, expected geological structures and thickness of sedimentary succession that could include some basins suitable for groundwater accumulation as groundwater aquifers.\n\nChemical and isotopic constraints on the origin of Wadi El-Tarfa ground waters, Eastern Desert, Egypt.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSultan, M.; Sturchio, N. C.; Abdel Hady, Y.\n\n2000-10-01\n\nWe evaluated the use of the renewable ground water resources of the Eastern Desert to develop sustainable agriculture in Upper Egypt, an alternative that could alleviate some of Egypt's dependence on water from the Nile River. Ground water from shallow aquifers in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, near the intersection of Wadi El-Tarfa and the Nile River, was analyzed for chemical compositions, stable isotope ratios, and tritium activities. The ground water has a range in total dissolved solids of 300 to 5000 mg/L. Values of {delta}D and {delta}{sup 18}O range from -10 to +34 %o and -2 to +5.2 %o,moreÂ Â» respectively, and defines a line having a slope of 5.7 that intersects the meteoric water line at about {delta}D = -15% on a plot of 8D versus {delta}{sup 18}O. These findings indicate that the water might have been derived by a combination of evaporation of and salt addition to regional precipitation. Only one sample could have been derived directly by evaporation and transpiration of modern Nile River water. Salinization of the ground water could have occurred through dissolution of marine aerosol dry fallout, carbonate minerals, gypsum, and other trace evaporitic minerals at and near the ground surface. Tritium activities ranged from 0.04 to 12.9 TU (tritium unite), indicating that all but one of the samples were derived at least partly from precipitation that occurred within the last 45 years. These data indicate that Nubian Aquifer paleowater is not a significant component of the shallow aquifers of this portion of the Eastern Desert. The most likely source of this ground water is sporadic flash flood events yielding locally voluminous recharge that accumulates in coarse sediments and fractured rock beneath alluvial channels. The magnitude of this renewable ground water resource and its potential for supporting sustainable agriculture require further investigation.Â«Â less\n\nStructural interpretation of aeromagnetic data for the Wadi El Natrun area, northwestern desert, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbraheem, Ismael M.; Elawadi, Eslam A.; El-Qady, Gad M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Wadi El Natrun area in Egypt is located west of the Nile Delta on both sides of the Cairo-Alexandria desert road, between 30Â°00â§ and 30Â°40â§N latitude, and 29Â°40â§ and 30Â°40â§E longitude. The name refers to the NW-SE trending depression located in the area and containing lakes that produce natron salt. In spite of the area is promising for oil and gas exploration as well as agricultural projects, Geophysical studies carried out in the area is limited to the regional seismic surveys accomplished by oil companies. This study presents the interpretation of the airborne magnetic data to map the structure architecture and depth to the basement of the study area. This interpretation was facilitated by applying different data enhancement and processing techniques. These techniques included filters (regional-residual separation), derivatives and depth estimation using spectral analysis and Euler deconvolution. The results were refined using 2-D forward modeling along three profiles. Based on the depth estimation techniques, the estimated depth to the basement surface, ranges from 2.25 km to 5.43 km while results of the two-dimensional forward modeling show that the depth of the basement surface ranges from 2.2 km to 4.8 km. The dominant tectonic trends in the study area at deep levels are NW (Suez Trend), NNW, NE, and ENE (Syrian Arc System trend). The older ENE trend, which dominates the northwestern desert is overprinted in the study area by relatively recent NW and NE trends, whereas the tectonic trends at shallow levels are NW, ENE, NNE (Aqaba Trend), and NE. The predominant structure trend for both deep and shallow structures is the NW trend. The results of this study can be used to better understand deep-seated basement structures and to support decisions with regard to the development of agriculture, industrial areas, as well as oil and gas exploration in northern Egypt.\n\nPalaeogeographical type of the geological heritage of Egypt: A new evidence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSallam, Emad S.; Ruban, Dmitry A.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe geoconservation and geotourism potential of Northeast Africa and, particularly, Egypt is big, but the knowledge of geosites of this territory remains limited. Another urgent task is establishment of the geological heritage of different types. The literature review and the personal field experience permit to propose several geosites that reflect the geological history of Egypt. These include El-Goza El-Hamra, Gebel Qatrani and Birqash, Khashm El-Galala, Wadi El-Hitan, Kom El-Shelul, Wadi Araba, Gebel Umm Bisilla, Maadi Petrified Forest, Dababiya Quarry, and Atud. The noted geosites represent all six main subtypes (facies, palaeoecological, ichnological, taphonomic, event, and geoarchaeological) of the palaeogeographical type of the geological heritage. Their rank varies between local and global. The entire palaeogeographical heritage of Egypt is of international importance. It is argued that three kinds of geodiversity are linked to this heritage. These are determined by the number of subtypes in the country, the co-occurrence of subtypes in the geosites, and the combination of the palaeogeographical and other geological heritage types. The proposed palaeogeographical geosites can be employed successfully for the purposes of geoconservation and geotourism. Presumably, the importance of archaeological objects for tourism activities in Egypt may facilitate attractiveness of the palaeogeographical heritage.\n\nDetermining heterogeneous deformation for granitic rocks in the northern thrust in Wadi Mubarak belt, Eastern Desert, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKassem, Osama M. K.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nFinite-strain was studied in the mylonitic granitic and metasedimentary rocks in the northern thrust in Wadi Mubarak belt to show a relationship to nappe contacts between the old granitic and metavolcano-sedimentary rocks and to shed light on the heterogeneous deformation for the northern thrust in Wadi Mubarak belt. We used the Rf/Ï and Fry methods on feldspar porphyroclasts, quartz and mafic grains from 7 old granitic and 7 metasedimentary samples in the northern thrust in Wadi Mubarak belt. The finite-strain data shows that old granitic rocks were moderate to highly deformed and axial ratios in the XZ section range from 3.05 to 7.10 for granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The long axes (X) of the finite-strain ellipsoids trend W/WNW and E/ENE in the northern thrust in Wadi Mubarak belt. Furthermore, the short axes (Z) are subvertical associated with a subhorizontal foliation. The value of strain magnitudes mainly constants towards the tectonic contacts between the mylonitic granite and metavolcano-sedimentary rocks. The data indicate oblate strain symmetry (flattening strain) in the mylonitic granite rocks. It is suggested that the accumulation of finite strain was formed before or/and during nappe contacts. The penetrative subhorizontal foliation is subparallel to the tectonic contacts with the overlying nappes and foliation was formed during nappe thrusting.\n\nPaleoenvironmental analysis and paleobiogeography of the Langhian-Serravallian succession in Wadi Trakee, westcentral Sinai (Egypt): An implication for Mediterranean and Paratethys faunal exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIed, I. M.; Nagwa Ibrahim, A.; Abd-Elaziz, M. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper aims to determine the probable paleoenvironments (ecozones) of Miocene sediments at Wadi Trakee, westcentral Sinai, Egypt. To achieve this work, both benthonic and planktonic foraminiferal assemblages were identified. Six paleoecologic zones (ecozones) are distinguished from Wadi Trakee Miocene succession in west-central Sinai; open marine environments were predominated during the deposition of these sediments; occasionally lagoonal. Great oscillation in sea level represented by lagoons and open marine conditions were prevailed in the earliest Langhian that came after the latest Burdigalian sea regression this was followed by great sea transgression phase and open marine environments during the latest Langhian. Serravallian Sea came after sea regression and a short hiatus preserved at the end of Langhian and ended by lagoons environments in the latest Serravallian. Seventy-one species of the identified benthic foraminifera indicate the Langhian, whereas forty-eight species recorded from the Serravallian. Due to the great similarity between the identified fauna with the previously recorded from the Paratethys countries, it can be suggested that high rate of faunal exchanges occurred and sea connections between the Mediterranean and Paratethys were occurred during these ages. Two unconformity surfaces are detected, the first lies within the Langhian while the second lies at the end of the Serravallian. Thirty-two planktonic foraminiferal species are also recorded from the Langhian - Serravallian succession that helped us to subdivide the studied succession into two planktonic zones; these zones correlated with the international schemes for biozones in the subtropical areas and the Mediterranean regions.\n\nHydrologic analysis of the challenges facing water resources and sustainable development of Wadi Feiran basin, southern Sinai, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhmed, Ayman A.; Diab, Maghawri S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWadi Feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern Sinai (Egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture, tourism, and industry. The present challenges against development include water runoff hazards (flash flooding), the increasing water demand, and water scarcity and contamination. These challenges could be mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate management, thereby promoting sustainable development. Strategies include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and artificial recharge of aquifers. This study uses a watershed modeling system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin's water resources. Rainwater-harvesting techniques could save more than 77% of the basin's runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and aquifer recharge. A guide map is provided that shows possible locations for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. Appropriate measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application of agro-chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in groundwater. Stringent regulations should be implemented to prevent wastewater disposal to the aquifers in the study area.\n\nConservation planning as an adaptive strategy for climate change and groundwater depletion in Wadi El Natrun, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSwitzman, Harris; Salem, Boshra; Gad, Mohamed; Adeel, Zafar; Coulibaly, Paulin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn drylands, groundwater is often the sole source of freshwater for industrial, domestic and agricultural uses, while concurrently supporting ecosystems. Many dryland aquifers are becoming depleted due to over-pumping and a lack of natural recharge, resulting in loss of storage and future water supplies, water-level declines that reduce access to freshwater, water quality problems, and, in extreme cases, geologic hazards. Conservation is often proposed as a strategy for managing groundwater to reduce or reverse the depletion, although there is a need to better understand its potential effectiveness and benefits at the local scale. This study assesses the impact of water-conservation planning strategies on groundwater resources in the Wadi El Natrun (WEN) area of northern Egypt. WEN has been subjected to groundwater depletion and quality degradation since the 1990s, attributed to agricultural and industrial groundwater usage. Initiatives have been proposed to increase the sustainability of the groundwater resource in the study area, but they have yet to be evaluated. Simultaneously, there are also proposals to increase the extent of arable land and thus demand for freshwater. In this study, three water management scenarios are developed and assessed to the 2060s for their impact on groundwater resources using a hydrogeologic model. Results demonstrate that demand management implemented through an optimized irrigation and crop rotation strategy has the greatest potential to significantly reduce risk of groundwater depletion compared to the other two scenariosâ\"business as usual\" and \"30% water-use reduction\"âthat were evaluated.\n\nUranium-series dated authigenic carbonates and acheulian sites in southern Egypt\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSzabo, B. J.; McHugh, W.P.; Schaber, G.G.; Haynes, C.V.; Breed, C.S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nField investigations in southern Egypt have yielded Acheulian artifacts in situ in authigenic carbonate deposits (CaCO3-cemented alluvium) along the edges of nowaggraded paleovalleys (Wadi Arid and Wadi Safsaf). Uranium-series dating of 25 carbonate samples from various localities as far apart as 70 kilometers indicates that widespread carbonate deposition occurred about 45, 141 and 212 ka (thousand years ago). Most of the carbonate appears to have been precipitated from groundwater, which suggests that these three episodes of deposition may be related to late Pleistocene humid climates that facilitated human settlement in this now hyperarid region. Carbonate cements from sediments containing Acheulian artifacts provide a minimum age of 212 ka for early occupation of the paleovalleys.\n\nThe Contemporary Land Mammals of Egypt (Including Sinai).\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-08-15\n\nlibyca and adult male and female Ictonyx striatus erythreae .............. 400 49.

In the early 20th century, ostrich farming was very important for production of ostrich feathers and documents were produced to perfect the art of procuring the plumes from the birds and subsequently processing them. Pharaohs used ostrich feathers for adornment. Of 43 provinces, 12 were featured in 2003-2004 as farming ostriches: Alexandria, Al-Behera, Al-Dakahlia, Al-Wadi Al-Gadid, Aswan, Cairo, El-Sharkia, Geiza, Ismailia, Kafr-El-Sheikh, Matrouh and Nubaria. Abattoirs and tanneries specialising in ostrich handling are limited to two. Egypt has numerous strengths and opportunities to develop its ostrich sector. Rising meat prices suggest that fresh ostrich meat is unaffordable to many locals. Funds may be allocated to local advertising campaigns to promote ostrich meat; provision of incentives to farmers; and improving the capacity of abattoirs.\n\nNatronolimnobius aegyptiacus sp. nov., an extremely halophilic alkalithermophilic archaeon isolated from the athalassohaline Wadi An Natrun, Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Baisuo; Hu, Qingping; Guo, Xiaomeng; Liao, Ziya; Sarmiento, Felipe; Mesbah, Noha M; Yan, Yanchun; Li, Jun; Wiegel, Juergen\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAn obligately aerobic extremely halophilic alkalithermophilic archaeon, strain JW/NM-HA 15 T , was isolated from the sediments of Wadi An Natrun in Egypt. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and rpoB' gene sequences indicated that it belongs to the family Natrialbaceae of the order Natrialbales. The closest relatives were Natronolimnobius baerhuensis IHC-005 T and Natronolimnobius innermongolicus N-1311 T (95.3 and 94.5â% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). Genome relatedness between strain JW/NM-HA 15 T and its neighbours was evaluated using average nucleotide identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average amino acid identity with the values of 75.7-85.0, 18.1-20.0, and 70.2-71.0%, respectively. Cells were obligately aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile, Gram-stain-negative and chemo-organotrophic. The strain grew in the presence of 2.57âM to saturating Na + (optimum 3.25-4.60 M Na + ), at pH 55âÂ°C 7.5-10.5 (optimum pH 55âÂ°C 9.0-9.5), and at 30-56âÂ°C (optimum 52âÂ°C). The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, methylated phosphatidylglycerolphosphate and two phospholipids. The complete genome size of strain JW/NM-HA 15 T is approximately 3.93âMb, with a DNA G+Câcontent of 64.1âmol%. On the basis of phylogenetic features, genomic relatedness, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, strain JW/NM-HA 15 T was thus considered to represent a novel species within the genus Natronolimnobius, for which the name Natronolimnobius aegyptiacus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JW/NM-HA 15 T (=ATCC BAA-2088 T =DSM 23470 T ).\n\nProvenance and sequence architecture of the Middle-Late Eocene Gehannam and Birket Qarun formations at Wadi Al Hitan, Fayum Province, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnan, Tarek; El Shahat, Adam\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe Middle-Upper Eocene Gehannam and Birket Qarun formations at Wadi Al Hitan (Valley of Whales) in Fayum Province of Egypt are dominated by marine siliciclastic sediments. Sedimentation took place in synclinal basins that were inherited from the Late Cretaceous tectonism. The siliciclastic sediments accumulated in low energy open shallow marine shelf. Most of the siliciclastics are heavily bioturbated by Thalassinoides. The abundance of unstable and moderately stable heavy minerals suggests that the Middle-Upper Eocene clastics were largely derived from the weathered regolith of the exhumed basement rocks of the Red Sea mountains. The ultrastable heavies were mainly recycled from positive landmass that bound the Eocene basins. Two sequence boundaries were observed in the studied succession. The first boundary lies within a rhizolith bearing-sandstone unit that occurs at the boundary between the Gehannam and Birket Qarun formations. The second sequence boundary occurs within the upper part of the Birket Qarun Formation, in a shale horizon bioturbated by Thalassinoides. Three 3rd order depositional sequences were recognized. These sequences may be formed due to tectonic activity that started in the Late Cretaceous and may be rejuvenated again during the Eocene time. Also emergence activities that were active during the Eocene led to the formation of the picked sequences by changing relative sea level. The recorded systems tracts are transgressive systems tract (TST), highstand systems tract (HST), and falling-stage systems tract (FSST).\n\nNew radiocarbon dates on the cereals from Wadi Kubbaniya\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWendorf, F.; Schild, R.; Close, A.E.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nIn 1978, three carbonized grains of barley and a carbonized grain of einkorn wheat were found in a buried hearth at a Late Paleolithic site at Wadi Kubbaniya in Egypt. In 1981, two large clusters of barley seeds, which were identified as six-row barley and thus domestic, were found at a nearby site of comparable age. Numerous grinding stones, presumed to have been used for processing the cereals, were found in these and other sites, often deeply buried, and 30 radiocarbon dates placed the occupations between 18,500 and 17,000 radiocarbon years ago. These finds led us to suggest an earlymoreÂ Â» origin of food production, with implications for the initial development of complex societies. Several barley seeds were analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy to determine the maximal temperature to which they had been subjected before burial. Six barley seeds and three small pieces of wood charcoal were dated directly by using a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer.Â«Â less\n\nStrain analysis and microstructural evolution characteristic of neoproterozoic rocks associations of Wadi El Falek, centre Eastern Desert, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKassem, Osama M. K.; Rahim, Said H. Abd El; Nashar, El Said R. El\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe estimation of finite strain in rocks is fundamental to a meaningful understanding of deformational processes and products on all scales from microscopic fabric development to regional structural analyses. The Rf/Ï and Fry methods on feldspar porphyroclasts and mafic grains from 5 granite, 1 metavolcanic, 3 metasedimentary and 1 granodiorite samples were used in Wadi El Falek region. Finite-strain data shows that a high to moderate range of deformation of the granitic to metavolcano-sedimentary samples and axial ratios in the XZ section range from 1.60 to 4.10 for the Rf/Ï method and from 2.80 to 4.90 for the Fry method. Furthermore, the short axes are subvertical associated with a subhorizontal foliation. We conclude that finite strain in the deformed granite rocks is of the same order of magnitude as that from metavolcano-sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, contacts formed during intrusion of plutons with some faults in the Wadi El Falek area under brittle to semi-ductile deformation conditions. In this case, finite strain accumulated during superimposed deformation on the already assembled nappe structure. It indicates that the nappe contacts formed during the accumulation of finite strain.\n\nOrigin and recharge rates of alluvial ground waters, Eastern Desert, Egypt.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSultan, M.; Gheith, H.; Sturchio, N. C.\n\n2002-04-12\n\nStable isotope and tritium analyses of shallow ground waters in the Eastern Desert of Egypt showed that the waters were derived largely by evaporation of regional precipitation and at least partly from precipitation in the past 45 y. To estimate the ground water recharge rate, we developed an integrated hydrologic model based on satellite data, geologic maps, infiltration parameters, and spatial rainfall distribution. Modeling indicated that during a severe 1994 storm, recharge through transmission loss in Wadi El-Tarfa was 21% of the precipitation volume. From archival precipitation data, we estimate that the annual recharge rate for the El-Tarfa alluvial aquifermoreÂ Â» is 4.7 x 10{sup 6} m{sup 3}. Implications for the use of renewable ground waters in arid areas of Egypt and in neighboring countries are clear.Â«Â less\n\nPsammomys obesus Cretzschmar, 1828 and zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sinai Peninsula, Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorsy, T A; Sabry, A H; Rifaat, M M; Wahba, M M\n\n1996-08-01\n\nIn the Middle East, the fat sand rat Psammomys obesus is the most important reservoir host of zoonotic cutaneous leishmamiasis (ZCL). It is the most incriminated host in outbreaks. Two P. obesus caught in Wadi El Gedeiret (Al Arish, North Sinai) were found naturally infected with Leishmania major as indicated by enzyme electrophoresis. In Egypt, the already known reservoir hosts are Gerbillus pyramidum I. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, 1825; Meriones crassus Sundevall, 1984 and Meriones sacramenti Thomas, 1922.

Its richness in archaeological artifacts makes it a valuable site. It has a valid claim to be the first nation state, as indicated by the Palette of Narmer discovered in its main mound. Geological and hydrogeological investigations at the Hierakonpolis Temple Town site documented nearly a 4.0-m water table rise from as early as 1892 to the present. In addition to the rising water levels, the increase of both subsoil water salinity and humidity threatens and damages fragile carvings and paintings within tombs in Kingdom Hill, the foundation stability of the site, and the known and still to be discovered artifact that recent pottery finds dates at least 4,000 BCE. Representative rock and soil samples obtained from drilled cores in the study area were chosen for conducting detailed grain size and X-ray analysis, light and heavy mineral occurrences, distribution of moisture and total organic matter, and scanning electron microscopy investigations. Mineralogical analysis of clays indicated that the soil samples are composed of smectite/illite mixed layers with varying proportions of smectite to illite. Kaolinite is the second dominant clay constituent, besides occasional chlorite. Swelling of the clay portion of the soil, due to the presence of capillary groundwater, in contact with buried mudbrick walls expands and causes severe damage to important exposed and buried mudbrick structures, including the massive ancient \"fort\" believed to date from the Second Dynasty (from 2,890 to 2,686 BC). The \"fort\" is 1.0 km south of the Temple Town mounds near to confluence of Wadi Abu Sufian. Groundwater samples from the shallow aquifer close by the intersection of Wadi Abu Sufian and the Nile flood plain were analyzed for chemical composition and stable isotope ratios.

Here we describe a new genus and species of marine catfishes (Siluriformes; Ariidae), Qarmoutus hitanensis, from the base of the upper Eocene Birket Qarun Formation, based on a partial neurocranium including the complete left side, partial right dentary, left suspensorium, two opercles, left pectoral girdle and spine, nuchal plates, first and second dorsal spines, Weberian apparatus and a disassociated series of abdominal vertebrae. All of the elements belong to the same individual and some of them were found articulated. Qarmoutus gen. nov. is the oldest and the most complete of the Paleogene marine catfishes unearthed from the Birket Qarun Formation.

Mountains of granite and sandstone rise next to valleys filled with red sand. Some of the mountains reach a height of about 1,700 meters (5,600 feet) above sea level, and many have near-vertical slopes. So alien is this landscape, itâs nicknamed âValley of the Moon,â and it has served as the film set for a movie about Mars. Yet nomadic people have lived here for thousands of years. Declared a protected area in 1998, this unearthly landscape is Wadi Rum. The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASAâs Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite captured this natural-color image on July 27, 2001. The scene includes part of Wadi Rum and an adjacent area to the east. East of the protected area, fields with center-pivot irrigation make circles of green and brown (image upper right). As the earth tones throughout the image attest, the area is naturally arid, receiving little annual precipitation and supporting only sparse vegetation. Between rocky peaks, the sandy valleys range in color from beige to brick. Ancient granite rocks dating from the Precambrian underlie younger rocks, and some of these basement rocks have eroded into rugged, steep-sloped mountains. The granite mountains have risen thanks partly to crisscrossing fault lines under the park. Overlying the granite are sandstones from the Cambrian and Ordovician Periods, as well as loose sands. Lawrence of Arabia, who fought in the Arab Revolt of 1917â1918, made frequent references to Wadi Rum in his book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Likewise, a prominent feature of the protected area is named after the book. Several popular sites in Wadi Rum bear Lawrence of Arabiaâs name, but whether he actually visited those sites is uncertain.

The Wadi was subject to severe thunderstorms on 17 and 18 January 2010 followed by an extreme and violent flood that had not been known in Sinai since 1980. The flood claimed six victims, injured tens of people, and devastated vital infrastructure and hundreds of houses. Hydrologic characteristics of the Wadi are not fully understood due to substantial lack of the detailed hydro-meteorological information. Hence, remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to provide better spatial understanding of rainfall characteristics and drainage basin response. The study was based on the analysis of the TRMM images and 6 hourly average HYDIS data of rainfall analyses. A hydrological model was constructed using ASTER DEMs. The empirical black box model was used depending on the curve number approach to predict stream runoff. Landcover and hydrological soil groups were identified from the Landsat ETM+ mosaic using multispectral supervised classification. The curve numbers were adjusted to ARC I (dry condition) as the total rain in a 5-day period preceding the storm were very low (â¤5 mm). We found, that the Wadi received a total rain volume of 665.4 x 106 m3. Most of it fell on 17 January, when the rain intensity ranged between 4-8 mm/hr. The estimated total surface runoff Q was 123.3 x 103 mm and the total runoff volume was 124 x 106 m3 that constitutes 18.8 % of the total rain volume. The results are in agreement with the observed values in the Wadi and highly required for many applications related to water harvesting and flood protection studies.\n\nKarst in Wadi Bani Khalid, Oman\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbdelaziz, Ramadan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThere are several important in Oman.

With 350 hr of cryogenic temperatures, lunar nights present a challenge to robotic survival. Insulation is imperfect, so it is not possible to passively contain enough heat to stay warm through the night. Components that enable mobility, environmental sensing and solar power generation must be exposed, and they leak heat. Small, lightweight rovers cannot store enough energy to warm components throughout the night without some external source of heat or power. Thermal wadis, however, can act as external heat sources to keep robots warm through the lunar night. Electrical power can also be provided to rovers during the night from batteries stored in the ground beside wadis. Buried batteries can be warmed by the wadi s heat. Results from analysis of the interaction between a rover and a wadi are presented. A detailed three-dimensional (3D) thermal model and an easily configurable two-dimensional (2D) thermal model are used for analysis.\n\nWadi As-Sirhan, Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2012-07-09\n\nAcquired by NASA Terra spacecraft on in 2011, this image shows the Wadi As-Sirhan Basin in northwest Saudi Arabia, which has been steadily developing agricultural fields using center pivot irrigation by tapping into fossil ground water.\n\nFloristic diversity and vegetation analysis of Wadi Arar: A typical desert Wadi of the Northern Border region of Saudi Arabia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOsman, Ahmed K.; Al-Ghamdi, Faraj; Bawadekji, Abdulhakim\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWadi Arar in the Northern border region of Saudi Arabia is one of the most important Wadis of the Kingdom. The present study provides an analysis of vegetation types, life forms, as well as floristic categories and species distribution. A total of 196 species representing 31 families of vascular plants were recorded. Compositae, Gramineae and Leguminosae were the most common families. Therophytes and chamaephytes are the most frequent life forms, indicating typical desert spectrum vegetation. The distribution of these species in the different sectors of the Wadi as well as the phytochoria for the recorded species is provided. Ninety-one species (46.5%) are typical bi-regional. Furthermore, about 105 species (53.5%) are mono- or pluriregional taxa. The highest number of species (136 or 69.5%) was recorded for annual plants, while the lowest number of species (60% or 30.5%) was recorded for perennial, short perennial or annual to biennial species.

But in the past 20 years ago it becomes one of the most tourist sites in Egypt. The basement complex is composed mostly of biotiteaplite-granite, mica-aplitegranite, granodiorite, quartzdiorite, alaskite, and diorite. Based on correlation with similar igneous in the most southern part of Sinai and the Red Sea area. Wadi Dahab composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks and the coastline is formed of the fragments of its rocks, mixed with fragments of coral reef and fluvial deposits of Wadi Dahab. The morphology of Dahab coastline is characterized by hooked marine spit, which composed of fluvial sediments carried by marine current from wadi Dahab mouth, this spit encloses shallow lagoon, but the active deposition on the lagoon bottom will evaluate it into saline marsh. This paper dealing with the evolution of Dahab spit and lagoon during the Holocene in addition to the recent time for last 100 years, and it impacts of the future management of the coast area. The coastline mapping during the period of study depends upon GIS technique for data were collected during field measuring by using total station, aerial photo and satellite image interpretation as well as soil sample dating.

S.; Mccauley, J. F.; Grolier, M. J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe fluvial and mass wasting origin of the particles in the eolian deposits, the segregation of these materials on the basis of grain size, and the migration of those particles capable of saltation to areas of accumulation in lowland basins of the Sahara are suggested as analogs for the formation and accumulation of 'sand' sheets and dunes on the northern plains and in the polar erg on Mars. Outliers of the Martian plateau in the fretted terrain are seen as having been dissected, at least initially, by channels whose upstream portions are incised in the uplands. The Martian 'wadis' possess many geomorphic peculiarities similar to those of the Gilf (Gilf Kebir Plateau, southwest Egypt) wadis, and like the Egyptian features they have been attributed to mass wasting. Even though basal sapping and removal of debris by wind have almost certainly modified the Martian features, their deep incision in the plateau and their inferred northward extensions in the northern plains are thought to require not only initial downcutting by fairly energetic streams but also prolonged and long-distance flow of water.\n\nClimatic, eustatic, and tectonic controls on Quaternary deposits and landforms, Red Sea coast, Egypt\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nArvidson, R.; Becker, R.; Shanabrook, A.\n\n1994-06-10\n\nThe degree to which local climatic variations, eustatic sea level fluctuations, and tectonic uplift have influenced the development of Quaternary marine and fluvial landforms and deposits along the Red Sea coast, Eastern Desert, Egypt was investigated using a combination of remote sensing and field data, age determinations of corals, and numerical simulations. False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a {approximately}10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cuttingmoreÂ Â» through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. Further, three distinct coral terraces are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with the following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/Th ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadi-related terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., {approximately} 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes. 33 refs., 18 figs., 2\n\nSoil seed bank in different habitats of the Eastern Desert of Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomaa, Nasr H\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe floristic composition and species diversity of the germinable soil seed bank were studied in three different habitats (desert salinized land, desert wadi, and reclaimed land) in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Moreover, the degree of similarity between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation was determined. The seed bank was studied in 40 stands representing the three habitats. Ten soil samples (each 25Â ÃÂ 20Â cm and 5Â cm depth) were randomly taken per stand. The seed bank was investigated by the seedling emergence method. Some 61 species belonging to 21 families and 54 genera were identified in the germinable seed bank. The recorded species include 43 annuals and 18 perennials. Ordination of stands by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) indicates that the stands of the three habitats are markedly distinguishable and show a clear pattern of segregation on the ordination planes. This indicates variations in the species composition among habitats. The results also demonstrate significant associations between the floristic composition of the seed bank and edaphic factors such as CaCO3, electrical conductivity, organic carbon and soil texture. The reclaimed land has the highest values of species richness, Shannon-index of diversity and the density of the germinable seed bank followed by the habitats of desert wadi and desert salinized land. Motyka's similarity index between the seed bank and the above-ground vegetation is significantly higher in reclaimed land (75.1%) compared to desert wadi (38.4%) and desert salinized land (36.5%).\n\nA new genus and species of marine catfishes (Siluriformes; Ariidae) from the upper Eocene Birket Qarun Formation, Wadi El-Hitan, Egypt\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWadi El-Hitan, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, of the Fayum Depression in the northeast part of the Western Desert of Egypt, has produced a remarkable collection of Eocene vertebrates, in particular the fossil whales from which it derives its name.

In total five graves were excavated. Preservation was excellent including human and other organic materials (hair, leather, textiles). Preliminary scientific dating points to the period between the second and fourth centuries AD.

The study confirms the existence of Pleistocene loess sediments along the Wadi. Wadi Gaza is characterized by meandering features along its course. The watershed of Wadi Gaza is estimated to cover more than 3500 km2 of the Northern Negev Desert and the Hebron Mountains as well as the small catchment sub-area in the Gaza Strip itself. Storm water drains the hills and mountains of Hebron and the northern Negev desert, accumulates in the Beer-Sheva area, crosses the Gaza Strip and discharges into the Mediterranean Sea. In winter the Wadi Gaza brings about 20 million cubic meter of rainwater into the area. Field investigations demonstrate the existence of loess sediments in the Wadi Gaza area, deposited during the dry periods that affected the area during the Pleistocene. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) applied for the Gaza Strip confirmed the existence of three Kurkar ridges within the Gaza Strip. Arranged from west to east (i) Sheikh Ejlin Ridge extends up to the current coastline in the west, (ii) Al Montar Ridge occurs near the armistice line in the east and (iii) Bait Hanon Ridge of which a part is present to the northeast of the Gaza Strip and a part to the east of the armistice line (the intermediate part not being accessible for observation due to political reasons. It is considered as a security zone).

K.; Arvidson, R. E.; Sturchio, N. C.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nNorth Africa has undergone drastic climatic changes over the past several hundred thousand years. The timing of humid intervals called pluvials was investigated by uranium-series disequilibrium dating of travertines from the Kurkur Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt. The youngest and best dated travertines (70-160 ka) are found in Wadi Kurkur and include spring and lacustrine units exposed as 2 to 3 m high terraces. Travertines having an age of approximately 191-220 ka are exposed by differential erosion as linear mounds produced by spring systems over fracture zones in ancient wadis. The oldest travertines, having ages >260 ka, are extensive, cap limestonemoreÂ Â» units above the oasis, and were deposited in paludal and lacustrine environments. Oxygen isotope ratios were measured for the wadi travertines ({delta}{sup 18}O values ranging from 16.7 to 19.1{per_thousand} SMOW) and for spring mound travertines (18.5-20.5{per_thousand}). Equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation calculations indicate that the Kurkur travertines were deposited from waters having {delta}{sup 18}O values similar to ancient Western Desert groundwaters ({approx} -11{per_thousand}). The ages of the travertines correspond to times of monsoonal maxima, eustatic sea level high stands and interglacial maxima. Rainfall producing these groundwaters (and travertines) was significantly fractionated during atmospheric transport, in contrast to modern meteoric waters (-2.09{per_thousand}), implying a distant source for the pluvial waters. Increased precipitation, recharge of Western Desert groundwaters, and resultant travertine deposition are interpreted to be consequences of Milankovitch insolation cycle forcing, through enhanced Atlantic and Indian Ocean monsoons during interglacial time periods.Â«Â less\n\nMonitoring and assessment of the groundwater quality in wadi Al-Arish downstream area, North Sinai (Egypt)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMasoud, Alaa A.; Meswara, Ebtesam A.; El Bouraie, Mohamed M.; Kamh, Samir Z.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAt a rate of 3 samples a year over 7 years (2008-2014), groundwater quality indicators for 294 samples from 14 groundwater supply wells located on the delta of Wadi Al-Arish, North Sinai (Egypt) were measured and analyzed. The prime objective was to characterize significant and sustained trends in the concentrations of the pH, TDS, Total Alkalinity, Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, NO3-, K+, Pb2+, Al3+, and fecal coliform (FC). Detection and estimation of trends and magnitude were carried out applying the nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Thiel-Sen trend statistical tests, respectively. Geostatistical kriging implemented in ArcGIS 10Ã was appraised for the spatial distribution of the indicators and their sustained trends. Factor analysis was applied to identify significant sources of quality variation and their loads. Average contents of all indicators exceeded the permissible limits except for Mn. Violation of groundwater quality standards clarified emergence of FC (99.6%), Pb2+ (76.8%), TDS (60.2%), Al3+ (56.6%), NO3- (46.5%), Fe2+ (37.5%), and Mn2+ (14%). Out of the 14 wells, notable upward trends (deterioration) were significant (>95% level) for Mg2+ (100%), TDS (78.5%), NO3- (71.42%), Zn2+ (42.85%), pH (14.28%), K+ (14.28%), and 7.14% for Al3+ and FC. Ranges of attenuation rates (mg/l/year) varied for TDS (52.61-37.59), Mg2+ hardness (3.81-0.14), K+ (0.58-1), pH (0.004-0.027), total alkalinity (-1.89-13.18), NO3- (1.47-0.69), Al3+ (0.002-0.011), Fe2+ (-0.001-0.016), Mn2+ (-0.00004-0.01), Pb2+ (-0.00001-0.002), Zn2+ (0.049-0.018), and FC (5.25-22) in cfu/100 ml. Out of the 14 wells, well no. 9 showed the largest increasing attenuation rates (mg/l/year) that marked NO3- (1.47), K+ (0.58), pH (0.004), and Al3+ (0.002). TDS showed the largest rates of increase of 52.61, and 28.26 for well nos. 5 and 9, respectively. FC showed the highest rate of deterioration of 5.25 in well no. 10. Zn2+ recorded strong deterioration rates of 0.049, and 0.046 for well nos. 12 and 9, respectively\n\nHolocene evolution of Dahab coastline - Gulf of Aqaba, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorab, Magdy\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDahab is a little Bedouin-village in Sinai Peninsula on the east coast of the Gulf of Aqaba and it lies approximately 90 km north of Sharm-el-Sheikh City. Dahab means \"gold\" in the Arabic language; over the past 20 years it has become one of the most visited tourist sites in Egypt. The basement complex is composed mostly of biotite aplite-granite, mica-aplite granite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, alaskite, and diorite. This composition correlates to similar igneous rocks in the most southern areas of Sinai and the Red Sea. Wadi Dahab is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks and the coastline is formed of fragments of its rocks mixed with fragments of coral reef. The morphology of Dahab's coastline is characterized by a hooked marine spit composed of fluvial sediments carried by marine currents from the mouth of Wadi Dahab. This spit encloses a shallow lagoon, but the active deposition on the lagoon bottom will turn it into saline marsh. This paper investigates the evolution of the Dahab spit and lagoon during the Holocene and over the last 100 years, as well as the potential impacts of future management of the coastal area. The coastline mapping during the study was dependent on GIS techniques and data were collected by using total station, aerial photographs and satellite image interpretation as well as soil sample dating.\n\nLunar Thermal Wadis and Exploration Rovers: Outpost Productivity and Participatory Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSacksteder, Kurt; Wegeng, Robert; Suzuki, Nantel\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe presentation introduces the concept of a thermal wadi, an engineered source of thermal energy that can be created using native material on the moon or elsewhere to store solar energy for use by various lunar surface assets to survive the extremely cold environment of the lunar night. A principal benefit of this approach to energy storage is the low mass requirement for transportation from Earth derived from the use of the lunar soil, or regolith, as the energy storage medium. The presentation includes a summary of the results of a feasibility study involving the numerical modeling of the performance of a thermal wadi including a manufactured thermal mass, a solar energy reflector, a nighttime thermal energy reflector and a lunar surface rover. The feasibility study shows that sufficient thermal energy can be stored using unconcentrated solar flux to keep a lunar surface rover sufficiently warm throughout a 354 hour lunar night at the lunar equator, and that similar approaches can be used to sustain surface assets during shorter dark periods that occur at the lunar poles. The presentation includes descriptions of a compact lunar rover concept that could be used to manufacture a thermal wadi and could alternatively be used to conduct a variety of high-value tasks on the lunar surface. Such rovers can be produced more easily because the capability for surviving the lunar night is offloaded to the thermal wadi infrastructure. The presentation also includes several concepts for operational scenarios that could be implemented on the moon using the thermal wadi and compact rover concepts in which multiple affordable rovers, operated by multiple terrestrial organizations, can conduct resource prospecting and human exploration site preparation tasks.\n\nAnalysis of Solar-Heated Thermal Wadis to Support Extended-Duration Lunar Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBalasubramaniam, R.; Wegeng, R.

R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe realization of the renewed exploration of the Moon presents many technical challenges; among them is the survival of lunar surface assets during periods of darkness when the lunar environment is very cold. Thermal wadis are engineered sources of stored solar energy using modified lunar regolith as a thermal storage mass that can enable the operation of lightweight robotic rovers or other assets in cold, dark environments without incurring potential mass, cost, and risk penalties associated with various onboard sources of thermal energy. Thermal wadi-assisted lunar rovers can conduct a variety of long-duration missions including exploration site surveys; teleoperated, crew-directed, or autonomous scientific expeditions; and logistics support for crewed exploration. This paper describes a thermal analysis of thermal wadi performance based on the known solar illumination of the moon and estimates of producible thermal properties of modified lunar regolith. Analysis was performed for the lunar equatorial region and for a potential Outpost location near the lunar south pole. The results are presented in some detail in the paper and indicate that thermal wadis can provide the desired thermal energy reserve, with significant margin, for the survival of rovers or other equipment during periods of darkness.\n\nAnalysis of Solar-Heated Thermal Wadis to Support Extended-Duration Lunar Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBalasubramaniam, R.; Gokoglu, S.; Sacksteder, K.; Wegeng, R.; Suzuki, N.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe realization of the renewed exploration of the moon presents many technical challenges; among them is the survival of lunar-surface assets during periods of darkness when the lunar environment is very cold.

The area examine is shown by the distribution of sample localities on the accompanying map. No mineral deposits of economic interest were seen. The terrain is one of broad plains and low hills that extend westward from the base of a prominent erosional scarp which forms the western edge of the Arabian Plateau. Streams cutting headward into the low-dipping massive sandstone of the Plateau have carved deep canyongs with vertical walls, and outliers of the sandstone are preserved as buttes and erosional forms of varied shapes. There are no permanent settlements in the mapped areas. The one road leads up a tributary of Wadi Qaraqir to some date gardens at the base of the sandstone cliffs. A well-travelled caravan route crosses the passes at Al Khuraytah to reach the Plateau H. St. John Philby strongly recommended that a road be constructed through these passes to provide direct access from Tabuk to the Red Sea coast. Burton (1878) was probably the first European to visit the area. He was searching for mineral deposits and he also located some Nabatcan ruins. Philby in company with R. G. Bogue, U. S. Geological Survey, explored the scarp in the Wadi Qaraqir valley and drove northwestward to Al Khuraytah pass. The geology of the Wadi Qaraqir quadrangle shown on the geologic map of the Northwestern Hijaz (Brown and others, 1963) was compiled from Bogue's work. Our work consisted of making traverses around the hilly area and up accessible wadis. We examined the rocks along the traverse routes and visited target areas that had been selected by examination of aerial photographs. Samples of wadi sediment were collected from fault zones, granite contacts, and areas that showed some evidence of hydrothermal alteration\n\nWater exploration using Magnetotelluric and gravity data analysis; Wadi Nisah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAboud, Essam; Saud, Ramzi; Asch, Theodore; Aldamegh, Khaled; Mogren, Saad\n\n2014-12-01\n\nSaudi Arabia is a desert country with no permanent rivers or lakes and very little rainfall. Ground water aquifers are the major source of water in Saudi Arabia. In the Riyadh region, several Wadies including Wadi Nisah store about 14 Ã 106 m3 of water, which is extracted for local irrigation purposes. In such areas, the water wells are as shallow as 200-300 m in depth. The importance of Wadi Nisah is because the subsurface water aquifers that are present there could support the region for many years as a water resource. Accordingly, in this study, we performed a Magnetotelluric survey using a portable broadband sounding system (MT24/LF) to evaluate the ground water aquifer at great depths. We collected 10 broadband Magnetotelluric sounding stations (1 station/day) with an interval of about 2-3 km reaching a profile length of about 25-30 km along Wadi Nisah. Additionally, we used available gravity data to image the subsurface structure containing the aquifer. MT results indicated a low resistivity layer, associated with alluvium deposits, which was defined at a depth of about 1-2 km and extended horizontally about 15 km. Gravity data analysis was used to model this resistivity layer indicating a basement surface at 3-4 km depth.\n\nThe effects of kinds of lumus and the storage period on the quality of patin wadi based on the results of nutrient tests\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDewi, Indah Sari; Hastuti, Utami Sri; Lestari, Umi; Suwono, Hadi\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWadi is the processed product of fish, due to local knowledge of the Dayak community, made of fresh fish with salt and lumus. The efforts to increase the quality of wadi as a kind of food were based on local knowledge, and are still ongoing. It is one of the ways to conserve wadi existence in the middle of the modern culture. It is important to add a variety of spices in suitable amounts as the innovation in producing wadi. People process wadi by using lumus made of rice and corn. Lumus gives a special taste and aroma t o wadi, furthermore, the effects of kinds of lumus and their concentrates, and the storage period on the nutrients of wadi are not known yet. This research used patin fish (Pangasius sp), white rice (Oryza sativa), white sticky rice (Oryza sativa var.glutinous), and corn (Zea mays) as the kinds of lumus. Each kind of lumus is mixed with fresh patin fish in different concentrations: 15%, 25% and 35%. The results of nutrient tests include measures of protein, carbohydrate, and fat, and show that patin which has been processed into wadi has more nutrients than fresh patin. The storage period and the varying concentrates of lumus effect the level of nutrients in patin wadi.\n\nGeological and geochemical studies in the Wadi Bidah District, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSmith, C.W.; Waters, B.C.; Naqvi, M.; Worl, R.G.; Helaby, A.M.; Flanigan, V.J.; Sadek, H.S.; Samater, R.M.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nGeological and geochemical followup studies of airborne electromagnetic anomalies in the Wadi Bidah district, southwestern Saudi Arabia, did not reveal metals of economic grade. Investigation of an anomaly enclosing the Rabathan ancient mine disclosed tightly folded and sheared Proterozoic tuffaceous rocks interlayered mostly with chert, dolomite, carbonaceous rocks, and volcanic wacke including cherty iron-manganese formations slightly anomalous in copper and zinc. Three drill holes placed to test anomalies within these formations yielded negative results. Studies of a long, narrow anomaly north of the Rabathan area indicated a similar geological environment. This northern area also contains limited zones that are highly anomalous in copper and zinc and extensive zones that are slightly anomalous in those metals. Drilling was not undertaken in this area. The Bilajimah airborne electromagnetic anomaly west of Wadi Bidah coincides with a broad synclinorium of layered felsic turfs and gossans. Geochemical studies indicated slightly anomalous copper, zinc, and silver values in gossans within the anomaly area. Two drill holes intersected carbonaceous rock that contained approximately 15 percent pyrrhotite and traces of sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Two geophysically anomalous areas west of Wadi Bidah surround ancient mines at Mahawiyah and Khayal al Masna'ah. Results of geochemical sampling at these workings were positive. An airborne electromagnetic anomaly located in the Assifar area in the southwestern corner of the Wadi Bidah district is underlain principally by metasedimentary rocks that include large linear zones of cherty iron-manganese formation and a few gossans .containing secondary base metal minerals. Detailed mapping and sampling of the Mulhal ancient mine, located west of Wadi Bidah, revealed two types of polymetallic gossans : (1) stratiform deposits interlayered with ignimbrites and mafic volcanic rocks and (2) barite-bearing gossanous material in shear\n\nAn Extension of Analysis of Solar-Heated Thermal Wadis to Support Extended-Duration Lunar Exploration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBalasubramaniam, R.; Gokoglu, S. A.; Sacksteder, K. R.; Wegeng, R. S.; Suzuki, N. H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe realization of the renewed exploration of the Moon presents many technical challenges; among them is the survival of lunar surface assets during periods of darkness when the lunar environment is very cold. Thermal wadis are engineered sources of stored solar energy using modified lunar regolith as a thermal storage mass that can supply energy to protect lightweight robotic rovers or other assets during the lunar night. This paper describes an extension of an earlier analysis of performance of thermal wadis based on the known solar illumination of the Moon and estimates of producible thermal properties of modified lunar regolith. The current analysis has been performed for the lunar equatorial region and validates the formerly used 1-D model by comparison of predictions to those obtained from 2-D and 3-D computations. It includes the effects of a thin dust layer covering the surface of the wadi, and incorporating either water as a phase-change material or aluminum stakes as a high thermal conductivity material into the regolith. The calculations indicate that thermal wadis can provide the desired thermal energy and temperature control for the survival of rovers or other equipment during periods of darkness.\n\nWhen was irrigation first used in Bat (Wadi Sharsah, northwestern Oman)?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFouache, E.; Desruelles, S.; Eddargach, W.; Cammas, C.; Wattez, J.; Martin, C.; Tengberg, M.; Cable, C.; Thornton, C.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe extensive archaeological site of Bat, registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1989, is situated within the Wadi Sharsah and around the modern village and palm grove of Bat, approximately 24 km from the modern city of Ibri in northwestern Oman. The archaeological remains from the Bronze Age excavated by the Bat Archaeological Project are located in two main areas. The northern area consists of a chain of low limestone hills cut by wadi tributaries leading to the main Wadi Sharsah. It is characterised by an exceptionally high density of graves from two successive Bronze Age periods: Hafit (ca. 3100-2700 BCE) and Umm an-Nar (ca. 2700-2000 BCE). South of the Bat cemetery, in the flat part of the valley, there are several large circular structures (known historically as \"towers\") and remains from both Hafit and Umm an-Nar periods, as well as later periods. Geomorphological mapping of the floodplain, associated with archaeological survey, have identified walls suggesting that during the Umm an-Nar period there was a system of irrigation which controlled flood water. Sedimentological, malacological, C14 dating and micromorphological studies of a 10 m long and 2.5 m high section located 143 m northeast of the Tower 1146 on the left bank of a small tributary of the Wadi Sharsah provide strong arguments for the presence of an irrigation system that began before the Hafit period. Botanical macro-remains collected during the excavation of early Bronze Age structures at Bat further indicate the presence of date palm gardens since the early 3rd millennium BCE allowing the cultivation of several crop species, in particular cereals. Most generally, the global palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from our data supports a model of a general trend of aridification from Bronze to Iron Ages.

A.; Abd El-Naby, H.; Dawood, Y.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe fate and transport of heavy metals and radioelements in groundwater aquifers in five wadis located in the Al Qunfudhah and Wadi Haliy quadrangles were investigated. These wadis are an important source of water to the Red Sea coastal plain. Copper, zinc and other base-metals mineralization occur at eastern parts of these quadrangles that dominates the water catchments area of these wadis. Water, rock and soil samples were collected from all wadis and they were analyzed for major, trace elements, heavy metals and stable isotopes. The chemical and isotopic results showed active water/rock interaction. The preliminary investigation of the data analyses showed some samples with high heavy metals and uranium contents. Generally, the uranium and heavy metal contents are higher in samples collected from the upstream area of each wadi where the crystalline rocks are exposed and direct contact with the runoff. The uranium contents were as high as 120 ppb in some water samples. These elevated values are mainly due to two factors water rock interaction and concentration through evaporation. It was also observed to have elevated heavy metal contents near mining activates, which suggests that these mining activates are playing an important role in mobilizing the heavy elements and in turn affecting the water quality in these wadis.\n\nGeophysical investigations in the Bi'r Idimah-Wadi Wassat area, Saudi Arabia, Part One\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAllen, R.V.; Davis, W.E.\n\n1969-01-01\n\nThe area is near latitude 18Â°20'N., longitude 44Â°20'E, about 20 Km south of Bi'r Idirah (Fig. 1). Most of the area lies in a wadi bounded by low hills that reach elevations near 1250 meters and rise as ranch as 50 meters above the wadi floor. The gossan is exposed in the wadi and near the crests of a few hills in the southern part of the surveyed area. It is underlain by andesite porphyry and greenstone intruded by granitic rocks, and appears to have been displaced laterally by faulting in the central part of the area. An inclined test hole north of the offset cut massive pyrite between depths 98 and 141 feet, 250 and 260 feet, and between depths 299 and 351 feet. This test and the character of the gossan suggest that the mineralized zone continues southward for a considerable distance.\n\nAssessment of future variability in extreme precipitation and the potential effects on the wadi flow regime.\n\nPubMed\n\nGunawardhana, Luminda Niroshana; Al-Rawas, Ghazi A; Kazama, So; Al-Najar, Khalid A\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate how the magnitude and occurrence of extreme precipitation events are affected by climate change and to predict the subsequent impacts on the wadi flow regime in the Al-Khod catchment area, Muscat, Oman. The tank model, a lumped-parameter rainfall-runoff model, was used to simulate the wadi flow. Precipitation extremes and their potential future changes were predicted using six-member ensembles of general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Yearly maxima of the daily precipitation and wadi flow for varying return periods were compared for observed and projected data by fitting the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution function. Flow duration curves (FDC) were developed and compared for the observed and projected wadi flows. The results indicate that extreme precipitation events consistently increase by the middle of the twenty-first century for all return periods (49-52%), but changes may become more profound by the end of the twenty-first century (81-101%). Consequently, the relative change in extreme wadi flow is greater than twofolds for all of the return periods in the late twenty-first century compared to the relative changes that occur in the mid-century period. Precipitation analysis further suggests that greater than 50% of the precipitation may be associated with extreme events in the future. The FDC analysis reveals that changes in low-to-moderate flows (Q60-Q90) may not be statistically significant, whereas increases in high flows (Q5) are statistically robust (20 and 25% for the mid- and late-century periods, respectively).\n\nPhase 3 geophysical studies in the Wadi Bidah District, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFlanigan, V.J.; Sadek, Hamdy; Smith, C.W.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nDetailed geophysical measurements have been made in the Rabathan area, Wadi Bidah district, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, at the site of diamond drill holes RAB-1, -2, and -3; these measurements suggest that the causative source for the anomalous EM (electromagnetic) and SP (self-potential) responses is probably highly conductive zones of Precambrian siliceous-carbonaceous rocks. Although many of the zones are no more than a few meters wide, they commonly contain 50 to 80 percent carbonaceous material and locally abundant pyrite. In places, several thin layers of highly concentrated carbonaceous material interlayered with chert form a multiple conductive zone that is seen in the geophysical data as complex anomaly patterns. In the geologic environment of Wadi Bidah, massive sulfide-bearing zones cannot be distinguished from siliceous-carbonaceous zones on the basis of the EM-SP responses. In North America in similar environments, complex resistivity methods used in experimental research have successfully discriminated between sulfide and carbonaceous conductors. Tests of such methods in the Wadi Bidah district are recommended. Geologic, geochemical, and geophysical data at the Jabal Mohr prospect suggest the possibility of mineralized rocks at depth over a possible strike length of 400 m.\n\nQuaternary alluvial deposits of Wadi Gaza in the middle of the Gaza Strip (Palestine): Facies, granulometric characteristics, and their paleoflow direction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUbeid, Khalid Fathi\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe Quaternary rocks of the Gaza Strip mainly consist of clastic sedimentary rocks. In Wadi Gaza, the outcropping rocks consist of brownish fine-grained deposits, sandstones, and conglomerates. The deposits have been studied from a genetic point of view, and six facies have been described: (i) graded clast-supported conglomerates, (ii) cross-bedded clast-supported conglomerates, (iii) sandy matrix conglomerates, (iv) cross-laminated medium-grained sandstones, (v) graded coarse-grained sandstones, and (vi) massive sandstones. The field work observations and granulometric analysis show that the sphericity of the grains increase toward the west, where its value ranges from â¼0.64 in the east to â¼0.70 in the west. In addition, the grain forms tend to be disc shape in the east, whereas they tend to be disc-to spheroid shape in the west, and they become well rounded to well sorted toward the west. Moreover, the features, geometry, and spatial relationship among these facies suggest that the Wadi Gaza was meandering wadi fed from Beir Sheva and the Northern Negev in the southeast of Gaza Strip through Wadi Al Shallala and Wadi Sheneq and from Hebron mountains in the West Bank at the east through Wadi Al Shari'a alluvials. Within the Gaza Strip, paleocurrent data ranges from 210Â° to 310Â°, indicating a mean a paleoflow direction to the W (276Â°) and a median value about 275Â°. The sedimentary rocks in the Wadi Gaza are considered to be deposited in two periods of climate conditions: the coarse-grained rocks were deposited during the period of wet condition before 12.4 ka age, whereas the eolinite fine-grained rocks were deposited during semiarid climate conditions which are younger in age than 12.4 ka.\n\nEgypt.\n\nPubMed\n\n1987-12-01\n\nAttention in this discussion of Egypt is directed to the following: geography; the people; history; government and political conditions; the economy; defense; foreign relations; and relations between Egypt and the US. The population totaled 50.5 million in 1986 with an annual growth rate of 2.8%. The infant mortality rate is 102/1000 (1986), and life expectancy is 58.3 years. Located in the northeastern corner of Africa, Egypt has a land area of about 1 million square kilometers and is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Libya, Sudan, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, and Israel. Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. Egyptians are a fairly homogenous people of Hamitic origin. Mediterranean and Arab influences appear in the north, and there is some mixing in the south with the Nubians of northern Sudan. Egypt has been a unified state for over 5000 years, and archeological evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for considerably longer. The constitution of Egypt provides for a strong executive with authority vested in an elected president who can appoint 1 or more vice presidents, a prime minister, and a cabinet. Egypt's legislative body has 458 members -- 448 popularly elected and 10 appointed by the president. Power is concentrated in the hands of the president and the National Democratic Party's majority in the People's Assembly, but opposition parties organize, publish their views, and represent their followers at various levels in the political system. The process of gradual political liberalization begun by Sadat has continued under Mubarak. In fiscal year 1987 the gross domestic product (GDP) reached about US$30 billion. Agriculture and services each contribute about 1/3 of GDP; the remainder comes from industry, petroleum, mining, electricity, and construction. At this time, the Egyptian economy faces several challenges. In 1986 the government of Egypt initiated a major review of economic policy and initiated an economic\n\nShelf architectures of an isolated Late Cretaceous carbonate platform margin, Galala Mountains (Eastern Desert, Egypt)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScheibner, C.; Marzouk, A. M.; Kuss, J.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nAn asymmetrical carbonate platform margin to basin transect has been investigated in the Upper Campanian-Maastrichtian succession of the Galala Mountains, northern Egypt. Identification of systems tracts and their lateral correlation was possible in slope sections only, whereas the monotonous chalk-marl alternations of the basinal sections could not be subdivided with respect to sequence stratigraphic terminology. The platform asymmetry is expressed by varying large-scale depositional architectures exhibiting a rimmed platform with a sigmoidal slope curvature in south-easterly dip-sections and a ramp with a linear slope curvature in south-westerly dip-sections. The rimmed platform is subdivided into a gentle upper slope and a steep lower slope. The platform formed as a result of the initial topography that was controlled by the tectonic uplift of the Northern Galala/Wadi Araba Syrian Arc structure. The calculated angles of the steep lower slope of the rimmed part range from 5 to 8Â°, whereas the ramp part has an angle of less than 0.1Â°.\n\nHydrogeochemistry and groundwater quality assessment along Wadi Al Showat, Khamis Mushiet District, Southwest Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlhumidan, S. M.; Alfaifi, H. J.; Ibrahim, E. K. E.; Abdel Rahman, K.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn the present study, the hydrochemistry and geologic characteristics of the shallow groundwater aquifer along Wadi Al Showat, Khamis Mushiet District, Southwest Saudi Arabia was evaluated and assessed. Along this wadi the fractured/weathered basement rocks house significant quantity of groundwater that usually used by local people for agricultural and domestic purposes. Assessing and evaluation of the quality of the groundwater in such shallow aquifers is very important; especially the groundwater is generally occurred within the fractured basement rocks at shallow depths, thus exposing the groundwater to surface or near-surface contaminants is expected. For this purpose hydrochemical and biological analysis was conducted for 25 water samples collected from the available shallow dug wells along the studied wadi. The study reveals that the groundwater quality changed due to the agriculture and urbanization practices along the wadi. The effect of domestic waste water and septic tanks was obvious. In addition, the field investigation indicates that the basement rocks in the area is dissected by two main sets of fractures that oriented in the west-northwest and east-west directions. In some places, the basement rocks is intruded by coarse-grained, quartz-rich quartzite grained monzogranite, and pegmatite veins that have a coarse-grained weathering product, therefore, they tend to develop and preserve open joint systems between the granitic blocks. These fracturing system are important from the hydrogeological point of view, as they facilitate the storage, water flow movement through them and also facilitate the vertical infiltration of the surface pollutants. These results led to a better understanding of the groundwater characteristics that is important in groundwater management in the study area.\n\nDesert Wadis and Smoke from Kuwait Oil Fires, Saudi Arabia\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1991-01-01\n\nSmoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires obscures the view of the desert wadis, Saudi Arabia (29.5N, 42.5E). During the brief Gulf war between Iraq and the Allied forces, many of the oil wells in Kuwait were destroyed and set afire. For several months, those fires burned out of control, spewing smoke and ash for hundreds of miles in many directions depending on the altitude, time of year and the prevailing winds.\n\nOrigin of the Sinai-Negev erg, Egypt and Israel: mineralogical and geochemical evidence for the importance of the Nile and sea level history\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMuhs, Daniel R.; Roskin, Joel; Tsoar, Haim; Skipp, Gary; Budahn, James R.; Sneh, Amihai; Porat, Naomi; Stanley, Jean-Daniel; Katra, Itzhak; Blumberg, Dan G.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe SinaiâNegev erg occupies an area of 13,000 km2 in the deserts of Egypt and Israel. Aeolian sand of this erg has been proposed to be derived from the Nile Delta, but empirical data supporting this view are lacking. An alternative source sediment is sand from the large Wadi El Arish drainage system in central and northern Sinai. Mineralogy of the Negev and Sinai dunes shows that they are high in quartz, with much smaller amounts of K-feldspar and plagioclase. Both Nile Delta sands and Sinai wadi sands, upstream of the dunes, also have high amounts of quartz relative to K-feldspar and plagioclase. However, Sinai wadi sands have abundant calcite, whereas Nile Delta sands have little or no calcite. Overall, the mineralogical data suggest that the dunes are derived dominantly from the Nile Delta, with Sinai wadi sands being a minor contributor. Geochemical data that proxy for both the light mineral fraction (SiO2/10âAl2O3 + Na2O + K2OâCaO) and heavy mineral fraction (Fe2O3âMgOâTiO2) also indicate a dominant Nile Delta source for the dunes. Thus, we report here the first empirical evidence that the SinaiâNegev dunes are derived dominantly from the Nile Delta. Linkage of the SinaiâNegev erg to the Nile Delta as a source is consistent with the distribution of OSL ages of Negev dunes in recent studies. Stratigraphic studies show that during the Last Glacial period, when dune incursions in the SinaiâNegev erg began, what is now the Nile Delta area was characterized by a broad, sandy, minimally vegetated plain, with seasonally dry anastomosing channels. Such conditions were ideal for providing a ready source of sand for aeolian transport under what were probably much stronger glacial-age winds. With the post-glacial rise in sea level, the Nile River began to aggrade. Post-glacial sedimentation has been dominated by fine-grained silts and clays. Thus, sea level, along with favorable climatic conditions, emerges as a major influence on the timing of dune\n\nRelationships between ground and airborne gamma-ray spectrometric survey data, North Ras Millan, Southern Sinai Peninsula, Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoussef, Mohamed A S\n\n2016-02-01\n\nIn the last decades of years, there was considerable growth in the use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometry. With this growth, there was an increasing need to standardize airborne measurements, so that they can be independent of survey parameters. Acceptable procedures were developed for converting airborne to ground gamma-ray spectrometric measurements of total-count intensity as well as, potassium, equivalent uranium and equivalent thorium concentrations, due to natural sources of radiation. The present study aims mainly to establish relationships between ground and airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data, North Ras Millan, Southern Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The relationships between airborne and ground gamma-ray spectrometric data were deduced for the original and separated rock units in the study area. Various rocks in the study area, represented by Quaternary Wadi sediments, Cambro-Ordovician sandstones, basic dykes and granites, are shown on the detailed geologic map. The structures are displayed, which located on the detailed geologic map, are compiled from the integration of previous geophysical and surface geological studies. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
