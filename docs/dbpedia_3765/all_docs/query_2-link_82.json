        "text": "The announcement by Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas that general elections would be held for the three Palestinian national institutions prompts various questions. Along with widespread hope for intra-Palestinian renewal and reconciliation, there are doubts that improvement would be possible after the elections, given the coronavirus crisis, public distrust of both political leaderships-Fatah and Hamas, and inter-organizational suspicion. Above all, the question is where Abbas is heading, as he took on extensive powers before announcing the election. Can relations be restored with the Biden administration if there is a possible integration of Hamas into the Palestinian Authority? Or is Abbas trying to steer the process to a direction of his liking? Israel, which has no interest in Fatah failing and Abbas losing the election, must examine the unfolding dynamic with the relevant security channels and allies in the international arena, and at the same time draw a new, realistic political and economic horizon. On January 16, 2021, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas issued a presidential order announcing elections for the three Palestinian national institutions-the presidency, the Legislative Council, and the Palestinian National Council. The order stipulates that the elections will be held in stages, from May to August 2021. The previous election order was issued in 2009, and was revoked less than 120 days later due to the split between Fatah and Hamas. This is the first attempt to hold elections for the Palestinian National Council, which since its inception has seen most of its members appointed and not elected. The order was issued at a time the Palestinian system is suffering an acute internal and external crisis, after years of the Trump administration pushing the Palestinian issue into a corner, the coronavirus pandemic, and harsh public criticism of both the Fatah and Hamas leaderships. Abbas, who stopped security coordination with Israel during the Trump era, was quick to renew it after Biden's victory in the US presidential election, which in turn halted reconciliation efforts between all Palestinian factions. Hamas waived its demand to hold elections for all three institutions on one date-presented as a condition in the reconciliation talks-and this paved the way to the planned elections.\n\nThis document wants to contribute to the understanding of the transition of Hamas modus operandi from being centered on armed fighting up until the al Aqsa intifada, to becoming mainly political in the aftermath, though not giving up its military threat. Hamas history is summarized in its 3 main phases corresponding to the first intifada, the Oslo process and the al Aqsa intifada. The moment in which this process of turnaround becomes evident is the period of the 2006 elections. Two arguments justifying this transition process are presented: first the leading generation renewal occurred in 2004 after Israel eliminated the old guard by selective killings, and secondly the many documents that Hamas presented before and after the elections to show its new political approach. The author believes that 2006 was a spectacular opportunity for the international community to bring Hamas to the negotiation table. This chance failed for a series of reasons, as analyzed in this paper, among others the tensions of intra-Palestinian parties, the refusal of the US and Israel to believe in Hamas turnaround sincerity and the complexity of the Palestinian issue.\n\nSince winning the majority in the Palestinian legislative council in 2006 and seizing power in Gaza in 2007, Hamas’ location in power has posed a serious challenge to its ability to govern without sacrificing its ideological positions. Various factors such as the obligations of governance, regional polarization, the struggle for power against Fatah, the international environment, and the Israeli occupation have affected their governance. Hamas in Power: The Question of Transformation discusses the changes in Hamas’ stance towards the borders of the Palestinian statehood (Two States Solution), the armed resistance, and the peace process. It also attempts to explain Hamas’ perceptions of these issues after assuming power and becoming a government. Covering key topics such as peace, power, governance, and ideology, this reference work is ideal for policymakers, government officials, diplomats, researchers, scholars, academicians, practitioners, instructors, and students."
