        "text": "\"We work in all regions where we see potential political and economic benefits,\" Lavrov said. He cited Latin America and Africa, aside from the former Soviet republics, as regions of diplomatic interest because they attract Russian business.\n\nWhen asked who Russia's allies and foes are today, Lavrov named the countries of the Collective Security Treaty (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) as allies of Moscow. He said it was sometimes hard to distinguish allies from foes, obviously referring to relations with some Western countries. Russia does not have real enemies, and \"we do our utmost\" to avoid having even potential foes, he said.\n\nLavrov believes it is premature to sound alarms in regard to the threat of U.S., European, and Chinese expansionism, which could diminish Russia's influence in the global arena. \"First of all, we must strengthen our own state,\" the foreign minister said.\n\nHe referred to the concept of \"global democracy under U.S. guidance\" as \"hardly realistic\" and said the formation of a multi-polar world was underway.\n\nLavrov said the current strain in relations between Russia and the European Union was caused by objective difficulties in the process of European expansion. Moscow has already questioned the EU about preparations for a new agreement in 2007, which will be the 10th anniversary of the present agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU. Lavrov said the new agreement should focus more on Russia's interests during the next stages of EU expansion.\n\nHe also said Russia does not intend to be the main player in post-Soviet territories. However, no other country should attempt to monopolize the influence on these territories, either, he said.\n\nNezavisimaya Gazeta\n\nGeorgia may force Abkhazia to accept Russian troops\n\nGiven the situation in the Caucasus, Russia should have substantial combat-ready forces there, and Georgia's persistent attempts to squeeze Russian military bases out of its territory may turn Abkhazia (a self-proclaimed republic in Georgia) into a Russian militarized zone, Akhmed Bilalov, first deputy chairman of Russia's State Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties with compatriots, told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta Wednesday.\n\nIn recent months, Georgian officials have spoken of the impossibility of continuing peace talks with Abkhazia. Abkhazian officials have interpreted this as a signal to prepare for another war. \"In this context, the readiness of Abkhazian President Sergei Bagapsh to accept Russian military units that would be pulled out of Batumi and Akhalkalaki looks justified,\" Bilalov said.\n\nHe also said Moscow has a chance to make a deal in this situation. \"Russia may reject the offer of Bagapsh, if Tbilisi respects Russia's request not to allow other foreign countries to have military bases in Georgia,\" Bilalov said.\n\nThe attempt to solve the problem by incorporating Abkhazia into Russia may seriously aggravate Moscow's relations with Georgia and the international community, he said. But various asymmetric answers can be found if Georgia does not show the will to solve the Abkhazian problem peacefully. \"For example, Abkhazia can be incorporated into Belarus after a referendum in the two republics. Belarus is Russia's ally in the Union State. In this situation, Russian citizens living in Abkhazia will be protected, and Moscow will avoid accusations of imperial ambitions,\" Bilalov said.\n\nVedomosti\n\nRussia's electric power monopoly plans to increase energy exports to China\n\nRussia's electric power monopoly, RAO UES Rossii, intends to export more electricity to China, the Vedomosti daily reported Wednesday. According to the proposed agreement, the company would be able to earn $2 billion a year from the new project. However, the effort would require a $7-15 billion investment.\n\nAlexander Kozlovsky, head of the Far Eastern division of Inter RAO UES, said an agreement with China's state electric grid corporation would stipulate an increase in electricity exports to 20 billion kWt/hr, and up to 50 billion kWt/hr in the future. However, new electric power stations and electric grids will be needed in order to meet China's requirements for at least 30 billion kWt/hr a year, RAO UES representative Marita Nagoga said. In the coming months, the electric power monopoly will prepare its first feasibility studies, she said. In particular, the company will have to decide whether the electricity will be supplied from Siberia or the Far East. In the initial stages, idle capacities and electric power stations under construction, in particular, the Bureya electric power station, are expected to be used to expand electricity exports, Anatoly Yanovsky, head of the fuel and energy department of the Ministry of Industry and Energy, said.\n\nThe cost of electricity in China will be a benchmark for the electric power monopoly, head of the Russian-Chinese Center for Trade and Economic Cooperation Sergei Sanakoyev said. Electricity costs 4-6 cents per kW in China. Consequently, RAO UES will be able to get $0.8-$1.2 billion a year for 20 billion kW/hr and about $2 billion for 50 billion kW/hr, Antanta Kapital analyst Denis Matafonov said.\n\nHowever, the Russian electric power monopoly will also have to invest a large amount of money. It will have to build electric power stations with a capacity of several thousand megawatts. RAO UES will need to spend $2-$5 billion to supply 20-30 billion kW/hr a year, vice president of Trust investment bank Andrei Zubkov said. According to his estimate, another $1.5-$2 billion will be required to build electric power grids. General director of Integrated Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin estimated the expenses for the delivery of 50 billion kW/hr to China to be $10-$15 billion.\n\nToday RAO UES exports electricity to China within the framework of border trade, Nagoga said. The Heihe province received 338.48 million kW/hr of electricity from Russia in 2004 and is expected to receive 500-550 million kW/hr in 2005. RAO UES Rossii can increase electricity supplies under this contract to 5 billion kW/hr by 2009-2010.\n\nIzvestia\n\nKaliningrad legislature advocates visa-free travel for EU citizens\n\nThe Kaliningrad regional legislature wants to introduce visa-free travel for EU citizens, the Izvestia daily said Wednesday. This measure would also help solve the Kaliningrad transit problem. Currently residents of Kaliningrad must have simplified visas and passports when traveling from this Baltic enclave to mainland Russia through Lithuania. The bill was submitted to the Russian parliament for consideration.\n\nThe regional legislature first sent such proposals to the State Duma in December 2002. \"The State Duma viewed this as a harmful and separatist initiative,\" the bill's author Vladimir Yezhikov said. \"Most of my colleagues supported the bill in February 2005.\" The deputies want to grant visa-free access to foreigners who will spend up to 90 days in the region. The bill's authors hope that EU countries will then allow visa-free travel to mainland Russia and back.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry's regional mission reacted negatively to the idea. \"A visa-free regime is premature,\" foreign ministry official Nikolai Belovol said.\n\nThe regional legislature has its own argument. The latest opinion poll shows that two-thirds of all local residents want to live in Russia. However, they want the region to have its own legislation with regard to EU countries.\n\nKommersant\n\nForeign journalists comment on Russia's English-language TV channel\n\nToday's Kommersant daily published journalists' comments on the new state-run, English-language TV channel that is to be launched before the end of the year by RIA Novosti.\n\nGisbert Mrozek, chief correspondent for the Rufo (Germany) agency's Moscow bureau: I have enough information in Russian. However, foreigners who do not speak any Russian might find the information presented by the Russian government interesting. The main thing is how the channel is organized and how politicized it is going to be. Germany has something similar - the Deutsche Welle (German wave) channel.\n\nMichel Viatto, head of the AFP office in Russia and the CIS: I do not need it really, but it is basically a positive move, as the more journalists there are, the more questions they ask the authorities, and the higher the pressure on the latter. The authorities are not concealing their participation in the project, so [people's] trust in the project will depend on the journalists.\n\nTagawa Minoru, Moscow bureau chief of the Japanese Akahata newspaper: I don't know, I can read and understand Russian. It is interesting that a government-sponsored channel will be broadcasting for foreigners, as it is a way of propaganda.\n\nAkram Khuzam, Al-Jazeera's Moscow bureau chief: I hope the channel will present information in an unbiased and balanced way and employ professional journalists. If the channel is like all the others, Westerners will not watch it. Russia still has freedom of speech, but the media works under restrictions, and I fear that the Kremlin is launching this channel for propaganda purposes. Russia does not need propaganda, and the West even less so.\n\nSeva Novgorodtsev, Russia's BBC radio host: I think it is \"a belch\" of the old foreign broadcasting concept based on the principle that we have money and we will go on air worldwide, and you will be listening. Nobody but ideologically twisted people listen to it. The channel will only be a success if the authors of the project have enough truth to tell. Otherwise, the idea is doomed. There are no purely image-oriented, state-run channels abroad."
