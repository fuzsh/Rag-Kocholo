        "text": "According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ),\n\nAhmad Mohamed Mahmoud, a journalist for state-owned Egyptian newspaper Al-Ta'awun has died from gunshot wounds\n\nsustained Jan. 28. He was said to have been the victim of sniper fire as he\n\nfilmed a confrontation between security forces and demonstrators in Cairo.\n\nCPJ came out with a list Friday of 10 additional incidents,\n\nbrining its total to \"at least 101 direct attacks,\" according to the\n\ngroup, including detentions, attacks on newsroom facilities and hacking of Al\n\nJazeera's Arabic-language Web site.\n\n\"It is stupefying that the government continues to send\n\nout thugs and plainclothes police to attack journalists and to ransack media\n\nbureaus,\" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa\n\nprogram coordinator, in a statement.\n\nAl Jazzera earlier said its Cairo bureau had been ransackedand equipment destroyed by \"thugs.\"\n\nBelow are 10 more incidents CPJ has compiled and confirmed,\n\nwith CPJ saying it is still investigating \"numerous other reports.\"\n\nPeter Beaumont,\n\nforeign affairs editor at the U.K. Observer, and Jack Shenker, a Guardian\n\nreporter, were stopped today while trying to enter Tahrir Square, the Guardian\n\nreported. The paper said they were intercepted by government forces, forced to\n\nkneel facing a wall, and interrogated. Beaumont was quoted by the Guardian as\n\nsaying: \"Although the square itself is calm, things around the periphery are\n\nvery different. We were taken at a checkpoint and led to the Ministry of the\n\nInterior ... We were held for two hours ... and we were both warned that if we came\n\nanywhere near the square again, things wouldn't go so nicely for us.\"\n\nAl-Hurra's Cairo\n\nbureau was targeted on Thursday, the U.S. government-funded station told CPJ in\n\nan e-mail. Men stormed its offices and \"threatened to kill Al-Hurra's two\n\non-air journalists-Akram Khuzam and Tarek El Shamy-if they didn't leave the\n\nbuilding,\" the station said in a statement. The bureau was immediately closed.\n\nTwo correspondents\n\nfor Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Robert Tait and Abdelilah Nuaimi, were\n\ndetained in Cairo, the U.S.-government funded station reported. \"We call on the\n\nEgyptian authorities to release our correspondents and their equipment\n\nimmediately,\" RFE/RL News Director Jay Tolson said.\n\nAndrew Henderson, a\n\nphotographer working for UAE-based daily The National, was attacked on Thursday\n\nby a group of young men who broke his camera equipment, National reporter Hugh\n\nNaylor told CPJ in an e-mail. \"Were it not for a bit of help from the military,\n\nhe would likely have been mauled to death by an angry mob,\" he told CPJ. Naylor\n\nhimself was punched several times in the head \"by some angry, plainclothes\n\nyouth standing near the foreign ministry yesterday,\" he said. \"I will credit\n\none apparent Mubarak loyalist for essentially saving my life. While pretending\n\nto be angry at me and taking my passport, he walked me away from the crowd and\n\nback safely to my hotel.\"\n\nAl-Jazeera's Arabic\n\nwebsite was hacked today, the station reported on the air. According to a\n\nstatement from the station, \"For two hours this morning (from 6.30 am-8.30am\n\nDoha time), a banner advertisement was taken over and replaced with the slogan\n\nof ‘Together for the collapse of Egypt,' which linked to a page criticizing\n\nAl-Jazeera.\" A spokesman for Al-Jazeera said that engineers \"moved quickly\n\nto solve the problem,\" The Guardian reported.\n\nAl-Jazeera's Cairo\n\noffice was stormed today by Mubarak supporters, the station reported on the\n\nair. Its office was vandalized and it equipment was set afire.\n\nProminent Egyptian\n\nBlogger Wael Abbas tweeted today that he was detained and later released by\n\nmilitary forces.

He left Egypt today and tweeted:\n\n\"At the airport and there was even a ticket. Kicked out, so i am not happy\n\nbecause i failed to do my job.\"\n\nNPR reporter Lourdes\n\nGarcia-Navarro was attacked on Wednesday, the station reported. Garcia-Navarro\n\nwas preparing a piece about the impact of demonstrations on the daily lives of\n\nEgyptians when she and her colleague, Ashraf Khalil, were surrounded by dozens\n\nof men. \"We were asked if we were Israeli spies, or employees of the Arabic\n\nnews network Al-Jazeera, who have been a particular target of the authorities\n\nhere. It began to get heated and they wouldn't let us leave,\" Garcia-Navarro\n\nsaid. She added that Khalil was punched repeatedly in the face.\n\nAndrew Butters of\n\nTime magazine was attacked on Thursday. \"I was grabbed by a young guy with\n\na club who hauled me over to an improvised checkpoint,\" NPR quoted him as\n\nsaying.
