        "text": "Who has never been struck by the omnipresence of icons in Orthodox churches? Sometimes depicting Christ, Mary, the apostles or other saints, they form an integral part of the Orthodox liturgy.\n\nIn fact, the veneration of saints is a dogma of the faith formulated at the Seventh Ecumenical Council in 789.\n\nThat Council ruled that the faithful may address prayers to saints requesting them to intercede before God while making use of images to assist in doing so.\n\nThe Orthodox Church\n\nSaints thus play a major role in the Orthodox tradition as they do in the Catholic Church.\n\n“The saint is a person, who has understood, while still living, how to reveal the life to come,” said Father Jivko Panev, an Orthodox priest of Macedonian origin.\n\n“Sainthood is a manifestation of that Christian eschatology, which is the foundation of our hope,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, the process of recognizing a saint is very different in the Orthodox Church, which does not have a formal process of canonization.\n\n“Certainly there is a discernment and an investigation but the process is not as formalized as it is in Rome,” Father Panev said.\n\n“Once a sufficient number of elements, including miracles and testimonies, have been gathered, the church in the saint’s place of origin recognizes him or her by a Synodal act that it then sends to other churches,” he said.\n\nThe Orthodox world shares a number of its saints with the Catholic Church, starting with all those saints of the first millennium prior to the schism of 1054, which separated the Christian world into West and East.\n\nSince then, many other saints have been recognized by the Orthodox Church, particularly the martyrs of the Russian Church, victims of the Soviet regime.\n\nIs there a specifically Orthodox kind of sainthood? The “folly of Christ,” a particular form of Russian mysticism, does not seem to have an equivalent in the Western world.\n\nIn any event, Father Panev said, “for both Catholics and Orthodox, one cannot speak of saints without reference to the church.”\n\nThe Protestant world\n\nExcept for the Anglican Church, Protestantism differs from other Christian faiths in its refusal of a cult of the saints.\n\nTo understand this refusal, it needs to be placed within the context of a 16th century theological debate on salvation.\n\nAccording to the Reformers, salvation is not the fruit of one’s works nor of human merit but is uniquely a gift of divine grace.\n\n“By denying the logic of merit, Protestants challenged the cult of the saints,” said Michel Bertrand, a Protestant pastor and theologian.\n\nMoreover, according to Guilhen Antier, who teaches dogmatics at the Protestant Institute of Theology, “this practice has no biblical foundation whereas the Reformers aimed to base their practice on Scripture.”\n\nNot venerating saints thus primarily signified a refusal to recognize any intermediary other than Christ between God and humankind.\n\n“In Protestantism, there are many exemplary witnesses to the Word of Christ but they are not regarded as intercessors,” Pastor Bertrand adds.\n\nWhile Protestants, unlike Catholics and Orthodox, do not pray to the Virgin Mary or the saints, this is primarily because of their “Christocentrism.”\n\nSainthood is thus not a taboo word for Protestants, who place great emphasis on personal sanctification.\n\nTo a certain extent, the word “saint” is even regarded as a synonym of the word “Christian.”\n\n“A saint is the person who is in a relationship with God,” Pastor Bertrand said.\n\n“However, God is the only one who knows who is in relation with him!” he said. “No other person, no other institution — not even the church — can know this!”\n\nThe “communion of saints,” which Protestants also confess, unites all believers beyond death — or at least those whom God regards as believers.\n\n“However, this is based on faith and not virtue,” said Antier.\n\nThus, there may not be a total correspondence between those who belong to the instituted church and those who God knows, he said. From a Protestant point of view, the communion of saints goes far beyond confessional belonging."
