        "text": "Evangelicals take the Bible seriously and believe in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. The term “evangelical” comes from the Greek word euangelion, meaning “the good news” or the “gospel.” Thus, the evangelical faith focuses on the “good news” of salvation brought to sinners by Jesus Christ.\n\nConversionism\n\nthe belief that lives need to be transformed through a “born-again” experience and a life long process of following Jesus\n\nBiblicism\n\na high regard for and obedience to the Bible as the ultimate authority\n\nActivism\n\nthe expression and demonstration of the gospel in missionary and social reform efforts\n\nCrucicentrism\n\na stress on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross as making possible the redemption of humanity\n\nDefining Evangelicals in Research\n\nEvangelicals are a common subject of research, but often the outcomes of that research vary due to differences in the methods used to identify evangelicals. In response to that challenge, the NAE and LifeWay Research developed a tool to provide a consistent standard for identification of evangelical belief.\n\nThe NAE/LifeWay Research method includes four statements to which respondents must strongly agree to be categorized as evangelical:\n\nThe Bible is the highest authority for what I believe.\n\nIt is very important for me personally to encourage non-Christians to trust Jesus Christ as their Savior.\n\nJesus Christ’s death on the cross is the only sacrifice that could remove the penalty of my sin.\n\nOnly those who trust in Jesus Christ alone as their Savior receive God’s free gift of eternal salvation.\n\nResearchers are encouraged to use the method, with proper citation to NAE/LifeWay Research.\n\nDownload the Methodology (PDF)"
