        "text": "World Christianity\n\nThere are more Christians than adherents of any other religion; at the beginning of the twenty-first century Christianity embraces approximately one-third of the world’s population. This proportion has not changed much since 1900, but in the twentieth century massive changes in the distribution of Christians occurred. A drastic decline in the number of Christians in Western Europe and, to a lesser degree, in North America has been offset by enormous gains in Asia (where Christianity has multiplied 15-fold since 1900) and Africa (where it has multiplied 42-fold). Whites now comprise only a minority of Christians worldwide.\n\nRooted in virtually every culture on earth, Christianity has taken on forms unfamiliar to someone exposed only to the more common forms of North American Christianity, such as Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Some Christian expressions—such as Armenian Orthodoxy, Ethiopian Orthodoxy, and the Thomas Christianity of South India—are very ancient and closely bound up with non-European cultures. Others are independent churches founded over the past century by prophets, particularly in Africa, drawing deeply from their local culture and pre-existing religious beliefs. About 19 percent of Christians worldwide are reckoned to belong to such indigenous churches, most with few or no ties to European or North American denominations."
