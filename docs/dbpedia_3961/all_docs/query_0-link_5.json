        "text": "Protestants are not a single ecclesiastical denomination with common beliefs. Rather, Protestantism is a collective term for all Christian religions that split from the previously Roman Catholic Church in protest. The largest Protestant groups today are Lutherans, Reformed Christians, Anglicans and Baptists. Since the Reformation, however, countless other churches and communities have emerged, all of which belong to Christianity but are independent in their own right.\n\nHistory of origins\n\nProtestantism has its origins in 16th century Europe. The Reformation period began in 1517 with Martin Luther, who published his 95 Theses in Wittenberg, Germany. Luther was thus the first to publicly criticize the Catholic Church, speaking out against indulgences, celibacy and the Papal States in particular. In addition, he later demanded in 3 extensive writings that the state take on further tasks in the social and educational sectors because the Roman Church of the time was incapable of reform.\n\nDuring the 16th century, several clergymen throughout Europe took up Luther's concerns. A second Reformation came from John Calvin in Basel and Geneva. A Protestant movement was also formed in Scotland, starting with John Knox. In the Netherlands, it was started by Jacob Praepositus in Antwerp."
