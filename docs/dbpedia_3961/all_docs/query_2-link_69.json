        "text": "You are here: » Christianity in View » Introduction to Protestantism » Denominations\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn contrast to the Roman Catholic Church, where interpretation of scripture is carried out by the Pope and his Bishops, Protestantism encourages ‘Private Interpretation’ of scripture by the individual. As a direct result, differing denominational groups have emerged, each holding to distinctive doctrines. Each regards itself as part of the ‘Invisible Church’ i.e. the union of believers on earth and in heaven, known only to God.\n\nThere are also growing numbers of non-denominational churches. This term, while implying non-alignment with a specific (Protestant) denomination is also usually understood to mean a church in agreement with the Five Solae of Protestantism. An example are the Vineyard group of Churches.\n\nDownload (PDF).\n\nThe mainstream Protestant denominations may be roughly grouped into nine families:\n\nNOTES:\n\n1. “Reformed” in this context includes churches who adhere to a Presbyterian (synodical) form of church polity (governance). Some Reformed churches adhere to Congregational polity and these are listed separately.\n\n2. The position of the Anglican church as a Protestant denomination is disputed, with some viewing it as a via media or “middle way” between the Catholic and Protestant traditions.\n\n3. The Baptist denominations are generally considered to lie within Protestantism, though some argue that the practice of “believers baptism” i.e Baptism on confession of faith by the candidate preceeds the Reformation and therefore Baptist churches should not be grouped in this manner."
