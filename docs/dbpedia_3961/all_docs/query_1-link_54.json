        "text": "This volume is a translation, revision, and enlargement of my Dutch study Protestantisme als wereldwijde vernieuwingsbeweging (1945–2020), published in 2021. It describes and analyzes Protestantism as a worldwide renewal movement that shrinks in many Western nations, but grows in many non-Western nations. After the Cultural Revolution in China (1966–1976), the Protestant Movement grew so vastly in this nation that people started to talk about ‘the Protestant fever.’ This volume strives to be an in-depth study of both the decline and the growth of post-war Protestantism in six continents. But this volume is unable to give a conclusive answer to the burning question: ‘Why growth in some continents and nations, and shrinkage in others?’\n\nThe present study is directly connected with the course of my life. I was born before the Second World War (1938) and baptized in the Netherlands Reformed Church as a child (1939). I have taken part in the worldwide Protestant Movement since my studentship (1957), and professionally after the defense of my dissertation at Leiden University and my ordination as a Reformed minister in the Hague (1971). I got the nice opportunity to teach in Indonesia (1971–1980), the Netherlands (1982–2008), the USA (2004), and occasionally elsewhere. In Utrecht University, I have been the promoter of 41 Th.D. candidates, originating from thirteen nations in five continents. In other words, I have fifty years of experience in the broad field of the history of World Christianity which is described and analyzed in this panoramic study.\n\nI have acknowledged the contributions of the many scholars and friends who helped me to publish the Dutch volume. Their names are mentioned in the foreword of the Dutch edition. At this place I express my sincere thanks to all people who have assisted me in transforming the Dutch edition into an English monograph. I would like to thank the editorial board of the Studies in the Intercultural History of Christianity for permitting me to publish once again in this series, and Frau Ute Winkelkötter and the production team of Peter Lang as Publishing House for its kindness, including its help to correct my Dutch English. Also thanks to my oldest son Christian J. B. Jongeneel who once again has taken care of the layout of the manuscript. Finally, I am thankful to the institutions who have generously funded this project.\n\nI dedicate this study to the memory of the known and unknown Protestant Christians who expressed their faith, hope, and love to God and humanity, and for that simple reason were discriminated, oppressed, tortured, and martyred. ←15 | 16→ I have paid a lot of attention to their witness and service, wondering whether my own faith would be strong enough to live with continuous threats, to endure long-lasting loneliness in prisons, and to be ready for martyrdom.\n\nJan A.B. Jongeneel,\n\nProfessor Emeritus Indonesian Christian University Tomohon (UKIT)\n\nProfessor Emeritus Utrecht University (UU)\n\nPaying Attention to ‘Protestantism’\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century Christianity has more adherents than any other religion, worldview, or ideology: ca. 30 à 33 % of the world population. Islam holds the second position: ca. 20 à 23 % of the world population. In the past century Islam grew quicker than Christianity. But Protestantism continued to grow inside Christianity. Today ca. 10 à 12 % of the world population is Protestant. In all nations Protestantism is present, either ‘above-ground’ or ‘underground.’ It influences countless individuals and people groups in all continents.\n\nScholars published more about worldwide Christianity than about worldwide Protestantism. This historical-systematic study corrects this one-sidedness. It offers a panoramic survey of Protestantism as a 500-year-old renewal movement in the history of Christianity and in world history. For practical reasons it merely describes and analyzes the postwar period: from 1945 until today. It places Protestant facts and values in an ecumenical framework, showing full openness to the views of both non-Protestant fellow Christians and the adherents of other religions, worldviews, and ideologies. The methodological restriction to ‘Protestantism,’ or ‘the Protestant People’s Movement,’ is not the result of a negative attitude towards other Christian denominations and other religions and ideologies. It is the result of making appropriate choices. The academic work of the present author is characterized by a lifetime participation in various interdenominational, international, and cross-cultural networks and activities at home and abroad.\n\nDefining ‘Protestantism’\n\nThe term ‘Protestantism’ can be used in different ways. Many scholars view ‘Protestantism’ as that form of Christianity which is neither Oriental/Eastern Orthodox, nor Roman Catholic, nor marginal/sectarian Christian. Others do not include ‘Anglicans’ and/or ‘Independents’ in ‘Protestantism.’ Their quite narrow definition of ‘Protestantism’ has the advantage of extra specification inside worldwide Christianity, but the disadvantage of fragmentation, and consequently confusion. The present study supports the wide definition. It treats Anglicans and Independents as ‘Protestants.’ But it refers to ‘Anglicans’ and ‘Independents’ as specific branches of ‘Protestantism’ if there is a need to do ←25 | 26→ so. In the next chapter more attention will be paid to the favored broad understanding of the term ‘Protestantism.’\n\nWillem van de Pol, Professor of ‘the Phenomenology of Protestantism’ at the Roman Catholic University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, introduced the term ‘World Protestantism,’ parallel to the older term ‘World Christianity.’1 The present study uses the term ‘World Protestantism’ and ‘Worldwide Protestantism’ interchangeably. But it does not make use of the connected terms ‘Global Protestantism’ and ‘Pan-Protestantism.’2\n\nIn one way or another ‘World Christianity’ and ‘World Protestantism’ are connected with the ‘World Church,’ largely embodied in the World Council of Churches (WCC) at Geneva, Switzerland (1948).3 The World Church, established in the first century of the Christian/common era, is the oldest intercontinental organization. Today it is the greatest volunteer movement on earth. The widespread Protestant People’s Movement also counts millions of volunteers.\n\nThe present study pays more attention to the worldwide developments in Protestantism than to the trends in the thousands of local Protestant churches and organizations. But it takes into account that the unity and diversity of World Protestantism is rooted in, and shaped by the many local Protestant communities in the cities and in the countryside of all nations.\n\nThe Term ‘Protestantism’ Derived from the Latin Word ‘Protestatio’: Witness and Protest\n\nAt first the term ‘Protestant’ was an invective, but in the course of the times it became a title of respect and honor. It owes its origin to the use of the Latin noun ‘protestatio = (1) testimony, witness, (2) protestation, protest’ on the Diet at Speyer in Germany (1529). This word is derived from the Latin verb ‘protestari = (1) to testify, to bear witness, (2) to protest.’←26 | 27→\n\nAt the Diet at Speyer (1526), the German estates met in the absence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. They unanimously agreed that each German ruler along with his subjects has the right to ‘live, govern and carry himself as he hopes and trusts to answer to God and His Imperial Majesty,’ until a general council convened. Three years later this large council took place at Speyer. King Ferdinand of Bohemia and Hungary, the Emperor’s representative, and the Roman Catholic estates wanted to revoke the decisions taken in 1526 and to maintain the church’s doctrinal and liturgical standards. But the Protestant estates appealed to the protestatio principle: unanimously taken decisions cannot be overturned by the votes of a majority. Moreover, they emphasized that they were bound to their conscience in matters of God’s honor and mankind’s salvation. The Roman Catholic majority rejected the protestatio. As a fatal consequence of this decision, a separation of the parties involved took place and ‘Protestantism’ was born. It became a renewal movement of (1) protest against religious intolerance and (2) witness. It testified that Christians always and everywhere are obliged to obey the ‘Lord of lords and King of kings’ (Rev. 17:14), more than ecclesiastical authorities and emperors.4\n\nIn the past centuries prominent Roman Catholic and Protestant believers have tried to improve the ecclesial relationships. But they were not very successful in their achievements. In the twentieth century a breakthrough took place. The Ecumenical Movement, embodied in the World Council of Churches (1948), and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1966) initiated a new era. The World Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church published the document Common Witness (1984), which can be viewed as the end of the era of antagonism and polemics.5 This innovative development urged all Protestants to rethink their witness and their protest. They widened their horizon and started to ‘protest’ all Christian and non-Christian persons, organizations, and governments who in one way or another legalize and practice religious intolerance. They combined this broad ‘protest’ with in-depth ‘witness.’ In recent history their witness is based upon (1) the Bible as religious authority, and (2) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), proclaimed by the United Nations Organization, as secular authoritative source.←27 | 28→\n\nProtestantism as Movement of Aliens and Members of the Household of God\n\nScholars described and interpreted Protestantism in various ways. Conrad Mönnich, Lutheran church historian at the University of Amsterdam, published a book in Dutch on the early history of Protestantism, entitled Aliens and Transients (1980).6 He derived this title from the words spoken by King David in Israel to characterize himself and his people: ‘aliens and transients’ (1 Chr. 29:15). Anabaptists wholeheartedly agreed with Mönnich and added that it is also appropriate to understand contemporary Protestantism in this way.7 But other authors feel more at home with the apostle Paul, who witnessed in one of his letters to the non-Jewish Christians in the Roman Empire: ‘You are no longer strangers and aliens, but citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God’ (Eph. 2:19–20).8 In today’s global setting some Protestants still regard themselves as ‘aliens and transients,’ and others as ‘members of the household of God.’ These different views are influenced by local insights and personal experiences. Protestant believers in majority settings may be less inclined to see themselves as ‘aliens and strangers’ than fellow believers who daily experience discrimination and persecution.\n\nThe Biblical term ‘aliens and transients’ must not be confused with the term ‘foreign religions.’ Some South and East Asians regard Christianity and Islam as ‘foreign religions,’ whether or not linked to their fear and hatred of foreigners in general (xenophobia). In India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other adherents of Hindutva nationalism merely want to recognize the religions that originate from the banks of the Indus and Ganges. Also some Chinese people label Christianity as a ‘foreign religion,’ because it was not born at the banks of the Yangtze. Christians in both India and China reject these biased opinions, emphasizing that their religion was not born in Europe or America, but in Asia: Jesus and his disciples were Asians. Moreover, the first preachers of the Gospel in India and China did not come from the Western world, but from Syria. Indian and Chinese Christians view themselves as ‘citizens’ of both the kingdom ←28 | 29→ of God and their native country. In a similar way African Christians oppose the stipulation that Christianity is a ‘foreign religion’ on African soil.9\n\nJesus himself was in Egypt, Africa (Mt. 2:13–15)."
