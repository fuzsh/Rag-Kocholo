        "text": "These are just a few of the questions to probe as we shape a lively and compelling life of worship and witness for the years ahead. We are navigating uncharted territory both for churches and for our society. There are no simple fixes. Though I focus here on the experience of mainline Protestants, I can imagine that my friends in historic black churches and in Roman Catholic parishes face similar challenges of future identity.\n\nThose of us raised in the last days of the Protestant epoch have a special vocation after living through much struggle and change. We baby boomers might better be known as the Transitional Generation. Of course, every generation has a special calling for its time, and it is for us now in our later years to serve the role of community memory, to raise wise questions that point the way; like Moses we will not see the end of this journey. The young are the inheritors of this wonderful faith tradition. They will be looked to for leadership into the future.\n\nIn its best moments this faith tradition has been willing to be vulnerable and abandon patterns of privilege and power in order to share in community much more widely than anyone could have dreamed. The central story of the mainline Protestant churches should not be one of decline but one of further commitment to unity and justice, forged with creative intentionality.\n\nThat creativity must shape a community by ethics and liturgy, with a message that brings to our community and our children a clear and distinct story of what it means to live Protestant Christian lives in religiously plural and secular societies. The challenge is to move beyond an excessively individualistic piety as well as the old monochromatic notions of unity that were a form of cultural domination, and instead live into new notions of unity and freedom that come from sharing community with others. For that day I live in hope.\n\nCongregational vitality faces embattled times, according to a new FACT2008 national survey of church life.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008, fewer congregations claimed to have spiritual vitality, strong finances, and a clear sense of mission. Fewer claimed worship attendance growth of 2 percent or more.\n\nOnly 19 percent said their current financial health is excellent, compared to 31 percent in 2000 (the FACT2008 survey pre-dates the market collapse of late 2008).\n\nThe study said mainline Protestant congregations face a special challenge, because their memberships are significantly older than other faith families. In nearly six of every ten mainline congregations a quarter or more of participants are 65 or older. This is nearly three times as great as for evangelical Protestant congregations.\n\nBut this periodic survey records bright spots too. Pockets of church vitality disclose a pattern of key ingredients for strong church life, including openness to change, clarity of purpose, attentiveness to new members, and appreciation of volunteers.\n\nIt found vitality especially among congregations - port of lay volunteers. Such congregations are more likely to extend invitations to new people to become involved in introductory classes, take roles in worship (reading, singing, taking up offering), and get involved in a social ministry. These congregations also are more likely to provide training for volunteers.\n\nSource: Fact2008, a product of the Cooperative Congregational Studies Partnership, a multifaith coalition of American faith communities affiliated with Hartford Seminaryâ€™s Hartford Institute for Religion Research.
