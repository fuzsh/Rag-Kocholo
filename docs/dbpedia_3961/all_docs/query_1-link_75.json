        "text": "THE OLD ORDER\n\nBefore Henry VIII’s break with the papacy in the 1530s, the Roman Catholic Church was all powerful in England. Only a small, persecuted minority questioned its doctrines. The early years of Henry’s reign also saw traditional religious practices – such as pilgrimages, saints’ holidays and religious plays – enthusiastically observed, together with the continued building and embellishment of churches that had been a major feature of the reign of his father, Henry VII.\n\nBut when Henry declared himself Supreme Head of the Church in England in 1533, following the Pope’s refusal to sanction his divorce from Katherine of Aragon, his decision initiated the Reformation of English religion. With it came the sweeping away of institutions that symbolised medieval Catholicism – and monasteries became the main focus of the king’s attack.\n\nThe monastic impulse was long past its peak: excepting those run by stricter orders like the Carthusians, monasteries had become property-owning corporations – some very rich – with few inhabitants. Rievaulx Abbey, North Yorkshire, which had about 650 monks at its peak, had only about 20 by the 1530s; massive Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk, had only ten.\n\nSome smaller abbeys had already closed because of a lack of recruits when Henry VIII forcibly suppressed all monasteries between 1536 and 1540.\n\nREACTION AND ACCELERATION\n\nThe Suppression of the Monasteries was largely accepted in the south, especially by those who acquired monastic lands. But in parts of the north it provoked the 1536–7 Pilgrimage of Grace, the largest peacetime revolt in English history.\n\nBut although Henry had rejected papal authority, he remained wedded to Catholic doctrine, and burned Protestant ‘heretics’. Real religious change only began to speed up under the radically Protestant Edward VI (r.1547–53), before being reversed when the Catholic Mary I (r.1553–8) tried to restore the old order, burning nearly 300 Protestants in the process.\n\nTHE CHURCH TRANSFORMED\n\nFor ordinary worshippers, the rapid changes to parish churches between 1538 and 1558 must have been bewildering. Shrines, images of saints and other ‘popish’ trappings were destroyed, removed or (as was the case with the medieval paintings at Binham Priory, Norfolk) whitewashed over.\n\nUnder Mary, these were renewed or replaced by royal command, only to be removed again when the Protestant Elizabeth I succeeded in 1558.\n\nThe Reformation similarly resulted in striking changes to religious practice – and in time, belief.\n\nThe Bible was now accessible to all literate people in English translations. Instead of being spectators at Latin Masses, congregations became participants in English-speaking services that focused on sermon-preaching, Bible readings and set forms of prayer. From 1549 these were formalised in the hugely influential Book of Common Prayer."
