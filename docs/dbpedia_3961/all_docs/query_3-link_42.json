        "text": "What Is A Non-denominational Church?\n\nA non-denominational church is a Christian church that holds no connection with the recognized denominations and mainline churches such as the Baptist, Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran, or Methodist churches. Church denominations are larger organizations that hold a particular identity, set of beliefs, and traditions. In denominational churches, the broader organization may set forth directives on leadership structures, membership, and dogma. In non-denominational churches, each church makes decisions on various parts of church life for itself.\n\nNon-denominational churches first arose during the latter half of the 20th Century. Although there are now many of them in several countries all over the world, it was here in the United States that they first started to appear. The reasons behind the establishment of a specific non-denominational church would depend upon the particular circumstances and ideas of its founders but, for the most part, these churches arose out of a desire for independence and a need to return to the biblical basics of Christianity, removed from the doctrinal and sometimes political affiliations that many long-established denominational churches had accumulated over the years.\n\nWhat Do Non-denominational Christians Believe?\n\nAlthough the answer to this question can vary from church to church, non-denominational Christian churches generally believe that the Bible should be the authority that dictates teaching, worship, and other aspects of church life. Instead of following beliefs set out by a larger organization, non-denominational churches rely on scripture to guide dogma. They are led by members of the church congregation (often a group of elders in the church), reflecting a belief that a church is a community of believers rather than a hierarchy.\n\nThis is in contrast to most denominational churches, many of which have codified doctrinal principles that are not necessarily grounded in the bible. Rather, these doctrines are formulated through substantial annotation and interpretation of the scriptures, as well as – occasionally – more secular considerations. In the view of non-denominational churches, these doctrinal extrapolations are not necessary and, in some cases, can constitute a distraction from, or an overcomplication of God’s word.\n\nMany denominational churches also have established hierarchical structures led by a formal priesthood. Although non-denominational churches do have pastors and elders who work to guide and assist the congregation in their relationships with God, and they do believe that there are those individuals who have a special anointing to teach, their structures are much less formal and the door is always open to any members of the congregation who feel a calling to participate in the life of the church.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of foundational beliefs that bind all non-denominational churches together in the broader Christian fellowship. The cornerstone of these is the belief in Jesus Christ as the Son and earthly incarnation of God, as well as His crucifixion, resurrection and prophesied second coming. This is a belief, of course, that non-denominational churches share with all Christians. Another central belief, as has already been mentioned, is that the Bible is God’s word in a literal sense and that it is perfect as it stands, without any need for additions or further explications of doctrine. The Christian life, therefore, as far as non-denominational churches are concerned, is one grounded in biblical principles, not in ritual or dogma.\n\nIn regard to matters relating to central features of Christian doctrine, such as the priesthood, communion or the Eucharist, and sacraments such as marriage, baptism and funeral practices, non-denominational churches often have a lot in common with later, non-episcopal Protestant churches, as distinguished from those doctrines espoused by the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church or the American Episcopal Church (which was formed from local branches of the Church of England after the Revolutionary War). In most cases, non-denominational beliefs in this regard are highly simplified compared to those of older churches, emphasizing the basic biblical teachings at their core.\n\nPros and Cons of Non-denominational Churches\n\nThere are various pros and cons of joining a non-denominational church. Here are some of the common ones:\n\nBecause each independent congregation can decide what the church believes and practices, the church can change and adapt to society. When a practice becomes outdated, the church can respond appropriately and adapt to serve their community and congregants. Being able to address the congregants’ concerns without answering to a central organizational leadership can help the church decide their path. This ensures that the congregants have an opportunity to influence the growth and development of the church. It also means that these churches are dynamic and responsive, and have a low risk of getting stuck in dogmatic considerations that may not have any relevance in the lives of their congregants.\n\nNon-denominational churches can attract members from mainline churches who no longer agree with specific practices and traditions while remaining within the broader Christian church sphere. Very often, people who have been raised in denominational churches maintain their belief in Jesus and biblical principles, while finding themselves at odds with their church’s longstanding rituals and dogmas. By attending a non-denominational church, they can continue to worship outside of the frameworks they have come to doubt or dislike.\n\nUnfortunately, independent non-denominational churches may not have access to the resources that a larger organization can access. These resources include financial contributions but extend to leadership and teaching experience, mentorship and support, and notability and influence. All of these aspects can help a congregation to grow, reach more potential members, and become a sustainable entity.\n\nNon-denominational churches may suffer when there are clashes within the organization, whether it be about practical matters concerning the operations in the church or more substantial questions of belief, practice, and dogma. If different preachers within a non-denominational church disagree substantially from each other, the church may be split into factions because there is no larger organizational structure to assist in settling contentious issues in a congregation. The hope is that such disputes can be settled by recourse to the Bible itself, but differences in interpretation can often be more difficult to solve. While this does demonstrate a laudable openness to discussion and debate among the elders of non-denominational churches, at its extremes it could possibly result in fragmentation and a lack of unity. Well-established churches circumvent such issues through a solid grounding in God’s word as a foundational document, together with a willingness to discuss doctrinal differences and smooth them out as quickly and as amicably as possible.\n\nNon-denominational Churches and millennials\n\nOne major strength of Christianity has always been its ability to maintain its central principles while continually adapting to the shifting needs of Christians as times change. Even some of the world’s older churches, while sometimes remaining relatively dogmatic, have been able to adapt in order to reach people better. In our current times, the 2000-year-old beliefs of Christianity have to contend with the post-modern, free-flowing and often technocentric mindsets of the millennial generation, which has little patience for ritual and tradition. Millennials are defined by a general distrust of established rules and institutions – or at least an extreme flexibility towards them – that exceeds that of any previous generation. The attraction of non-denominational churches for millennials thus stems from the view that these individuals often have about society. Because millennials are less likely to hold fast to traditions and enjoy having the freedom to make choices, they can find a congregation that resonates with them. With doctrinal differences no longer a consideration, discovering the right church becomes a more personal matter of finding people with whom an individual can fit in, and/or church leaders whose style and approach are most relatable to them.\n\nNon-denominational churches have the freedom to worship in different ways. These churches often worship with modern forms of music and are more likely to engage with congregants beyond the physical church space on social media and other church-organized events. There are also usually leaders within the church who specialize in interacting with younger generations and relating to their concerns and life challenges as peers, rather than as authority figures. This holds a great deal of appeal to millennials, who may otherwise feel that their thoughts and questions are not understood by priests and church elders.\n\nThe appeal for the millennial church-goer is understandable because the focus is more relational and less institutional. Congregants can break away from traditions and live out their individualism in their worship and religious affiliations.\n\nWhy you should try a non-denominational church\n\nNon-denominational churches bring people from all walks of life together. Because there is no specific denominational affiliation, your background, upbringing, and culture won’t be the dictating factors for worship. Your love for Jesus will be what connects you to others in the church. If you’re looking for a place of worship where the community is hands-on in creating the church experience, you should visit your local non-denominational church.\n\nIf you’re looking for a non-denominational church, Grace Church is eager to welcome you.
