Belly laugh your way through student improv performances. Trek through the Adirondack wilderness on a La Vida expedition.\n\nCharter a club for something you love. Enjoy concerts and theatre performances on campus. Rally on the quad for a snowball fight or Gull Pond for a beach campfire. And through it all, build lasting friendships.\n\nLife-giving faith\n\nJoin fellow Christians from diverse backgrounds who all want to deepen their relationship with Jesus, learn from one another and prepare to be a powerful witness for Christ in the world.\n\nJust imagine what you can learn when youâ€™re surrounded by a wide variety of Christian traditions in worship, prayer, discipleship and service."
