For example, a High Church Anglican or Lutheran has more in common with an Orthodox theologian than with a Baptist theologian. Amid this diversity, however, it is possible to define Protestantism formally as non-Roman Western Christianity and to divide most of Protestantism into four major confessions or confessional families—Lutheran, Anglican, Reformed, and Free Church.    The largest of these non-Roman Catholic",

The Lutheran churches in Germany, in Scandinavian countries, and in the Americas are distinct from one another in polity, but almost all of them are related through various national and international councils, of which the Lutheran World Federation is the most comprehensive. Doctrinally, Lutheranism sets forth its distinctive position in the Book of Concord, especially in the Augsburg Confession. A long tradition of theological scholarship has been responsible for the development of this position into many and varied doctrinal systems. Martin Luther moved conservatively in this reform of the Roman Catholic liturgy, and the Lutheran Church, though it has altered many of his liturgical forms, has remained a liturgically traditional church. Most of the Lutheran churches of the world have participated in the ecumenical movement and are members of the World Council of Churches, but Lutheranism has not moved very often across its denominational boundaries to establish full communion with other bodies. The prominence of Lutheran mission societies in the history of missions during the 18th and 19th centuries gave an international character to the Lutheran Church; so did the development of strong Lutheran churches in North America, where the traditionally German and Scandinavian membership of the church was gradually replaced by a more cosmopolitan constituency.\n\nAnglicanism\n\nThe Anglican Communion encompasses not only the established Church of England but also various national Anglican churches throughout the world. Like Lutheranism, Anglicanism has striven to retain the Roman Catholic tradition of liturgy and piety, and, after the middle of the 19th century, the Oxford movement argued the essential Catholic character of Anglicanism in the restoration of ancient liturgical usage and doctrinal belief. Although the Catholic revival also served to rehabilitate the authority of tradition in Anglican theology generally, great variety continued to characterize the theologians of the Anglican Communion. Anglicanism is set off from most other non-Roman Catholic churches in the West by its retention of and its insistence upon the apostolic succession of ordaining bishops. The Anglican claim to this apostolic succession, despite its repudiation by Pope Leo XIII in 1896, has largely determined the role of the Church of England in the discussions among the churches. Anglicanism has often taken the lead in inaugurating such discussions, but in such statements as the Lambeth Quadrilateral (1886) it has demanded the presence of the historic episcopate as a prerequisite to the establishment of full communion. During the 19th century and especially in the last third of the 20th century, many leaders of Anglican thought were engaged in finding new avenues of communication with industrial society and with the modern intellectual. Meanwhile, the strength of Anglicanism in the New World and in the younger churches of Asia and Africa confronted this communion with the problem of deciding its relation to new forms of Christian life in these new cultures.\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, a number of theologically liberal developments in Anglican churches in the United Kingdom and in North America aggravated fault lines not only between traditionalists and liberals but also between the more traditionally Anglican areas (the U.K., the U.S., and Canada) and the countries of the Global South—those of Africa, Asia, and Latin America—where the majority of the world’s Anglicans lived. The ordination of women as priests and bishops by the American, Canadian, and English churches faced stringent objections from African and Asian churches as well as from English, American, and Canadian theological conservatives. When the Rev. Gene Robinson, an openly homosexual man in a noncelibate relationship, was ordained a bishop in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) in 2003, traditionalists around the globe dissented, and the ordination of other openly gay clergy and the blessing of same-sex unions by some congregations further incensed conservatives. In June 2008, having decided to skip the decennial Lambeth Conference taking place the following month, traditionalists held the Global Anglican Forum Convention (GAFCON) in Jerusalem, issuing a declaration of traditional Anglican values. Later that year, U.S. and Canadian traditionalists left their respective national provinces (churches), and in 2009 they launched the Anglican Church in North America, which immediately appealed for recognition by the Anglican Communion, whose leadership was compelled to retrench and seek a means of reconciling conflicting interpretations of Anglican tradition."
