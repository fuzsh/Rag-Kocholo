        "text": "Not My Type (Pas son Genre)\n\nDirector: Lucas Belvaux\n\nWriter: Lucas Belvaux\n\nProducer: Agat Films’ Patrick Sobelman\n\nU.S. Distributor: Rights Available\n\nCast: Emilie Dequenne, Loic Corbery, Anne Coesens\n\nBelvaux is, unfortunately, one of those exciting director’s that isn’t often discussed in the US, though he’s directed an enjoyable trilogy of films starring Catherine Frot (a great actress that doesn’t receive the attention she deserves in the English speaking realm) and a 2009 thriller, Rapt. While his last film, 2012’s 38 Hours (also known as One Night) was a bit dry, (though some last minute cast changes with Charlotte Gainsbourg dropping out may have upset proceedings) we’re looking forward to his latest offering based on the Philippe Vilain novel.\n\nGist: Clement, a young Parisian philosophy professor, is transferred to Arras for a year. Far from Paris and its nightlife, he doesn’t know what to do with his free time. Then he meets Jennifer, a pretty hairdresser who becomes his lover. Free love and free hearts, they could live a beautiful love story together if it weren’t for the gaping social and cultural divide between them.\n\nRelease Date: This title will see domestic release in April, so we’re hoping this somehow snags US distribution or gets some festival love closer to home.\n\n[related]Top 200 Most Anticipated Films of 2014[/related]"
