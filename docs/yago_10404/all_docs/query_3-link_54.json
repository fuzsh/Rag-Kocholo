        "text": "This is our Land\n\nFrance, Belgium – 2017 – 114 min – Color – Scope – 5.1 – Not Rated – Drama\n\nIn French with English Subtitles\n\nSynopsis\n\nMarine Le Pen was defeated in the French election that brought Emmanuel Macron to power, but her far right-wing party, with its nationalist, anti-immigrant platform, lives on to feed the fear and resentment that begot Donald Trump’s election. THIS IS OUR LAND is a fictionalized story of an attractive working-class single mother in the North of France who naively agrees to run for mayor, representing the Patriotic Bloc. Lucas Belvaux, who previously directed RAPT, a terrific thriller about a French politician’s kidnapping, deals with another type of kidnapping here: With the help of a charming André Dussollier as the town’s esteemed physician, the Populists’ rhetoric seizes control of the minds of the electorate. With Catherine Jacob as the blonde-bobbed leader who never met an angry crowd she couldn’t make angrier.\n\nDirected by\n\nLucas Belvaux\n\nCAST\n\nEmilie Dequenne, André Dussolier, Guillaume Gouix, Catherine Jacob, Anne Marivin, Patrick Descamps\n\nCREW\n\nDirector Lucas Belvaux Screenplay and Dialogues Lucas Belvaux and Jérôme Leroy Cinematography PIERRIC GANTELMI D’ILLE\n\nProducers SYNECDOCHE, ARTEMIS PRODUCTIONS\n\nREACTIONS\n\n“The film is a shoo-in for Stateside distribution, since Belvaux’s theme is the cinematic equivalent of all those articles trying to understand the disgruntled white voters who supported Trump.”— Variety\n\n“[WILL] inspire spirited audience discussions in cinema lobbies — and beyond.”— Hollywood Reporter\n\n“This Is Our Land is essential viewing for its damning critiques” – Film Inquiry\n\n“This is our Land » is not only a great entertainment, it is also a powerful warning”. – 20 Minutes\n\nREAD\n\n“INSIDE FRANCE’ MOST CONTROVERSIAL MOVIE OF THE MOMENT”\n\nAWARDS AND FEST\n\n2017\n\nIstanbul international film festival\n\nRotterdam International film festival"
