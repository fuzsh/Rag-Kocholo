Last month, The Matrix trilogy was completed; in a fortnight we'll have the last instalment of The Lord of the Rings; and in between we've seen the three episodes of Lucas Belvaux's sequence, culminating in Trilogy Three (After Life).\n\nUnlike the Wachowski brothers' films and the Tolkien trio, which proceed chronologically, Belvaux's movies are less a triptych than a palimpsest, being superimposed on each other as they cover the same set of events over a couple of days in Grenoble.\n\nBenjamin Franklin remarked to his fellow founding fathers: 'We must indeed all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.' I think Belvaux's pictures do hang together and, indeed, only the first in which Bruno, a ruthless terrorist, returns to Grenoble after 15 years in jail, is truly free-standing. The pattern that emerges is that of three schoolteachers and their trouble with men - Jeanne (Catherine Frot), a former associate of Bruno; Agnès (Dominique Blanc), who harbours Bruno while her policeman husband pursues him; and the supposedly happily married Cécile (Ornella Muti), in whose mountain chalet Bruno is hidden.\n\nWith each part of the trilogy, our view of the characters changes as we see them from different angles. Bruno, the unreconstructed terrorist stuck in the past (played by Belvaux himself), is the person we initially identify with. By the end, he has become a plausible monster, alien to us. And the movie culminates in a deeply affecting scene involving a couple who, for much of the way, are rather unsympathetic. It's all rather like Odd Man Out rewritten by Alan Ayckbourn.\n\nBased on a Michael Crichton novel, the preposterous Timeline sees David Thewlis invent a machine for transporting objects through space and discovering a time warp that leads to fourteenth-century France. Through this 'wormhole' (my dictionary tells me such things might actually exist), he sends a party of archaeologists to the Dordogne where a war is going on between the French and the English.\n\nAs the chief archaeologist, Billy Connolly has never been in anything so funny - albeit unintentionally so - and the dialogue is priceless. 'Do we look like quantum wormhole specialists?' asks one archaeologist. 'Trust me, we're in 1347 France,' says the ex-US marine leading the expedition.\n\nS.W.A.T., a lively, mindless police thriller based on a TV series of some years back, takes few pitstops during two hectic hours spent racing around Los Angeles. It's principally concerned with a specialist team, selected by veteran S.W.A.T. sergeant Samuel L. Jackson, escorting a swaggering young European Mafia boss who has gone on TV, promising $150m to whoever rescues him from the Feds. Almost every crook in LA, as well as some cops, aims to take him up his offer. Colin Farrell makes his fourth screen appearance this year as a dedicated cop of great integrity.\n\nMore interesting and exciting than S.W.A.T. is Robert Schwentke's Tattoo, a bleak German thriller set mostly at night in Berlin during the monsoon season and much indebted to The Silence of the Lambs and Seven. An obsessed, middle-aged inspector (Christian Redl) and his tearaway young partner (August Diehl) are searching for a serial killer who's murdering men and women and flaying their bodies.\n\nThis leads them into a bizarre subculture of decadent connoisseurs who collect stretches of tattooed skin either bought off living people or stripped from corpses. You could cut the film's murky atmosphere with a scalpel and there are some stunning images like that of the beautiful blonde standing in the rain at night, her soaked white dress becoming diaphanous to reveal that she is tattooed from her shoulders to her ankles.\n\nThe title of the lugubrious Danish-Scottish co-production Wilbur (Wants to Kill Himself) has the parenthetic explanation of its eponymous hero's self-destructive preoccupation in order that you won't go in expecting an exciting tale of aeronautical pioneers. In fact, this movie about two Glaswegian brothers running their late father's second-hand bookshop - one of them dying of pancreatic cancer, the other bent on committing suicide - never gets off the ground. Everyone is weird, whimsical or dim, and it's difficult to guess what its Danish director (ex-Dogme associate Lone Sherfig) is after, or why Scottish Screen became involved in such an odd enterprise.\n\nA below-average Disney animated feature, Brother Bear is a tale told by an Inuit about a young Indian in the Pacific North West who's turned into a bear by the spirit of his dead brother. He's being punished for having killed a bear and the aim is to make him respect nature and attain wisdom. It's sentimental stuff with the occasional good joke and some soaring, inspirational songs by Phil Collins that attempt to take you up where you belong.\n\nFinally, two British movies. The low-budget thriller The Late Twentieth, the directorial debut of Hadi Hajaig, centres on a young Londoner who fails to come to the aid of his girlfriend when she's murdered by an armed robber in a convenience store. He subsequently goes insane and seeks redemption by pursuing malefactors, principally a drug dealer he witnesses killing a young woman. It is a choppy, flashy picture that moves fast and, like its protagonist, keeps falling down and getting up again. As a calling-card movie, it appears to have served its purpose because Hajaig is apparently in pre-production on a more expensive and seemingly more interesting film."
