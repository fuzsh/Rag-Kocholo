        "text": "About\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s, a disparate group of filmmakers in Paris reinvigorated cinema with offbeat and energetic approaches to filmmaking. A moment rather than a movement, what became known as the nouvelle vague or French New Wave brought together film enthusiasts who broke away from tired formulas and experimented with new approaches to narrative, genre, the cinematic image, montage and sound. With the advent of lightweight camera equipments, high speed film and portable location sound recording equipment, they burst out of the studio into the streets and cafes, and to explored the cinematic possibilities of the city, riffed on Hollywood genre cinema, and also responded to a volatile political context that included wars in Indochina and Algeria as well as the rise of the mass student protests of May '68. Presented with the generous support of the French Embassy in Australia, 'Breathless: French New Wave turns 50', curated by Kathryn Weir (Australian Cinémathèque), includes films by Claude Chabrol, Jacques Demy, Jean Eustache, Jean-Luc Godard, Louis Malle, Chris Marker, Jean-Pierre Mocky, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, Jean Rouch, François Truffaut, Agnès Varda and many others. The cinema of May '68 is featured in an associated program curated by Adrian Martin (Rouge, Monash University) which brings together many rare films from before, during and after the events. In 'New Wave Paris: Paris vu par...', Gilles Rousseau (Forum des Images, Paris) showcases the strong relationship between the nouvelle vague and the streets of Paris, a primary location for so many iconic films of the period. Over the last decade in France an explosion of young filmmakers working with limited means has been dubbed the 'New New Wave'; Joe Hardwick (University of Queensland) has selected a program of powerful 'New New Wave' films from young French filmmakers who have again marked their generation.\n\nList of Works"
