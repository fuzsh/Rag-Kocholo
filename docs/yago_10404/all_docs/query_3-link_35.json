(Event in French)\n\nInfluenced during his early acting days by directors such as Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol and Alain Bergala, Lucas Belvaux moved to the other side of the camera in 1991 with his first film “Parfois trop d’amour”. A trilogy (“Un couple epatant”, “Cavale”, “Apres la vie”) and a Louis Delluc prize later, Lucas Belvaux has brought his incisive vision to our screens. His last two films, “Rapt” and “38 temoins” confirmed his place as a major author in Belgian cinema.\n\nWednesday 13 June at 17:00 - Flagey - studio 1\n\nPractical information\n\nDate and time: 13 June 2012\n\n17h - rencontre avec Lucas Belvaux\n\n18h - Screening of BXLX24\n\n18h30 - cocktail\n\nPlace: Flagey - Studio 1\n\nFree entrance depending on space available - reservation preferred.\n\nInformation: Action culturelle de la SACD - avanweddingen@sacd.be"
