        "text": "The French Film Festival UK is the only festival dedicated to French and Francophone cinema. The 28th FFF 2020 was all due to set off again on a tour of 28 independent Art House cinemas from Aberdeen to Plymouth but unfortunately in early November, a second lockdown was announced. With cinemas suddenly closed, FFF@home was an innovative venture to view a small selection of movies on line with great success.\n\nAs a special Springtime treat, the FFF has launched another season of FFF@home, featuring exclusive online screenings of six films available to view over three weekends this month.\n\nRichard Mowe, director and co-founder of the Festival, said: “We wanted to make sure that audiences did not miss out on some of the most anticipated films of the Festival due to the Covid disruption … and now they’re available to view online as part of the extended Festival. Bon film!”\n\nFollowing the recent Golden Globes and the shortlist for the Academy Awards – the 93rd Oscars – announced on the 15,th March is movie month indeed. This online mini FFF is launched most appropriately on 12 March – the date when the French film industry celebrates the best new films, actor and creative achievements at the César awards.\n\nTickets to access your FFF@home cinema are available to purchase in advance – full details below. There’s an extra bonus too with subtitled conversations with the directors for a virtual FFF experience. All films are in French with English subtitles and available for 48 hours from the screening date and time listed in the schedule.\n\nAs an enticing taster, here is a snapshot of the French movies on offer across wartime drama, crime thrillers, comedy and romance.\n\nFriday 12th March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nLOVE AFFAIR(S) (Les Choses qu’on dit, les choses qu’on fait)\n\nOfficial Selection at Cannes 2020 and Best Film nomination, Césars 2021.\n\nThe French title is translated as “The Things We Say, the Things We Do,” and is a classic romantic tale of two strangers thrown together by chance, set against the lush green French countryside. Exploring their notions of what real love is, the chemistry between Daphne and Maxime covers a rich tapestry of emotion. Directed by Emmanuel Mouret, the film has been described as “a more serious “Love Actually” pitching between the sexy and the silly, the philosophical and farcical.”\n\nSaturday 13th March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nNIGHTSHIFT (Police)\n\nDirected by Anne Fontaine and based on a novel by Hugo Boris, Night Shift focuses on three Parisian police officers charged with escorting a foreigner to Charles de Gaulle airport to be sent back to his homeland. “Am I a good cop or not?” the moody, gritty narrative, told from different points of view, explores the line between professional duty, personal conscience and moral values. A highly dynamic and stylised blend of realism and impressionism. Nightshift was premiered at the Berlinale Special Gala, 2020.\n\nFriday 19 March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nHOMEFRONT (Des Hommes)\n\nOfficially selected for Cannes 2020 and for Deauville Film Festival 2021\n\nIn 1960, Bernard, Rabut, Février were called up to fight in the Algerian War, and returned two years later to France. Fast forward a few decades to a birthday party, when an incident triggers memories for the veterans who have kept silent about what they saw, felt and endured. Directed by Lucas Belvaux, the different voices and perspectives are artfully intertwined as the men confront the past and how the traumatic African experience shaped their lives. “It’s a film about the wounds of war rather than the war itself.”\n\nSaturday 20th March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nMAMA WEED (La Daronne)\n\nSet in Paris, this comedy caper stars Isabelle Huppert as Patience Portefeux, a French-Arabic interpreter working for the anti-narcotics Police squad, when she unwittingly becomes involved in the drug trafficking world. “Huppert is a chameleon of an actress and the transformation from world-weary translator to drug kingpin is remarkable, donning a leopard-print hijab, gold chain and massive shades. Her whimsical, light-hearted performance gives Patience an irresistible charm”. Mama Weed is directed by Jean-Paul Salomé.\n\nFriday 26 March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nTHE TRANSLATORS (Les Traducteurs)\n\nDirected and co-written by Régis Roinsard, this is an ingenious literary Agatha Christie-style whodunit in which a multi-lingual group of translators are all suspected of stealing a future best seller. This is the upcoming release of the final book in the Daedalus trilogy, which has been a global sensation. “The script is filled with twists, red herrings, false clues. Roisnard’s meticulous sense of craft and you get an altogether slick package. A thrilling ride which will satisfy audiences who appreciate a good bookish mystery.”\n\nSaturday 27 March, 7.30pm (available for 48 hours)\n\nIN BED WITH VICTORIA (Victoria)\n\nIn this stylish Parisian Romcom, directed by Justine Triet, Victoria is a thirty-something, divorced, single mother, juggling her work as a criminal lawyer, family life and trying to find love again. At a rather drink-fuelled wedding, she meets an old friend Vincent, who is soon charged with attempted murder, and also bumps into a former client, Sam, a drug dealer. “ An amusing watch, this has freshness and naturalism .. with just enough kookiness to set itself apart from the pack.”\n\nThis latest FFF@home season is presented in partnership with the new platform INDY On Demand powered by Shift72 and films can be viewed on all browsers and devices.\n\nYou can purchase each film separately with tickets priced at £8 or the Festival Pass gives access to all six films for £40. There are concessions for 16-25s. Films are available for 48 hours from the release date and time of the screening. Once you have bought your ticket and pressed PLAY, you have 48 hours to watch the film as many times as you like!.\n\nJust like in a cinema, space is limited so make sure you book tickets in advance to ensure of the best seat in the house. Then time to make a large tub of popcorn and settle down to enjoy FFF@home.\n\nBrowse all movie info, watch trailers and book your tickets here:\n\nhttps://frenchfilmfestival.org.uk/2021/whats-online-in-march/"
