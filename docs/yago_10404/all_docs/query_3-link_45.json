        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Director , Screenwriter more\n\nBelgian nationality\n\nBirth November 14, 1961 (Namur, Belgium)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAfter completing his schooling at the boarding school in Philippeville (Belgian province) where his father was an administrator, Lucas Belvaux decided, at the age of 16, to abandon his studies and leave for Paris, in order to become an actor. Enrolled in a private course, he quickly met an agent who allowed him to find his first roles in TV films.\n\nIn 1981, Lucas Belvaux made his film debut, as a rebellious young man, in Allons z’enfants , the anti-militarist plea by Yves Boisset . Seen at Losey and Zulawski , the actor toured in 1985 with two masters of the New Wave, Claude Chabrol ( Chicken with vinegar , in which he plays an overly talkative postman) and Jacques Rivette ( Hurlewind , variation around the work of Emily Brontë ). Between naivety and romanticism, Lucas Belvaux plays a rock lover in Désordre , Olivier Assayas ‘ first feature film in 1986, and a notary clerk who seduces Madame Bovary in Chabrol ‘s adaptation of Flaubert ‘s masterpiece (1991). ).\n\nAt the beginning of the 90s, Lucas Belvaux moved behind the camera. Author of a first intimate work that went a little unnoticed ( Sometimes Too Much Love ), he won the favor of critics and the public with For Laughs! (1996), offbeat vaudeville which reveals its sense of casting ( Jean-Pierre Léaud / Ornella Muti ). Building on this success, he embarked on a triptych composed of a comedy ( Un couple astonishing ), a thriller ( Cavale ) and a melodrama ( After Life ), the main characters of each film becoming the secondary characters of the other two. The Louis-Delluc Prize will crown this project in 2005, as fun as it is ambitious.\n\nLucas Belvaux continues to act, with Hervé Le Roux ( We call it… spring ), Akerman ( Tomorrow we move ), Christian Carion ( Joyeux Noël ), Régis Wargnier ( Leave quickly and come back late ) or Robert Guédiguian ( The Army of Crime ), its producer via the company Agat Films . He also plays one of the main roles in his sixth feature film as director, The Reason of the Weaker(2006), humanist thriller filmed in his native Belgium. Drawing his inspiration from social reality, he made a film for television on alternative forms of economy ( Nature contre nature ) and a fiction on the Elf affair ( Les Prédateurs ).\n\nA committed artist, in 2009 he signed, for the big screen, Rapt , a harsh and intense work led by an unrecognizable Yvan Attal (the actor lost 20 kilos to be credible as a sequestered businessman), according to a fact various resounding: the kidnapping of Baron Empain. He reunited with the actor in 2012 for his new production, 38 Witnesses , also with Sophie Quinton and Nicole Garcia in the cast, for a story of murder disrupting the life of a couple.\n\nAfter tackling a lighter register with the romantic comedy Pas son genre , Lucas Belvaux delivered Chez Nous in 2017 , focusing on the functioning of the French far right and its worrying power of seduction among people. For the occasion, the filmmaker reunites with actress Emilie Dequenne who starred in Pas son genre. Three years later, he tackled a difficult subject again with Des hommes , a drama set against the backdrop of the Algerian War led by Gérard Depardieu , Catherine Frot and Jean-Pierre Darroussin ."
