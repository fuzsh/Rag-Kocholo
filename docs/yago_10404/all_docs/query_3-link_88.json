        "text": "Trilogy: One\n\n(114 minutes, 15)\n\nDirected by Lucas Belvaux, starring Catherine Frot, Lucas Belvaux, Dominique Blanc\n\nOwing more to the thematic connections of Kieslowski's Three Colours series than the episodic triumvirates of The Matrix or Lord of the Rings, Lucas Belvaux's acclaimed Trilogy comprises three films in three genres (thriller, comedy, melodrama), connected by incidental characters who collectively prove that nobody is a bit part player in the story of their own life. Although viewable in any order, British distributors have opted to dub this first thriller, Cavale/On the Run, as Trilogy: One, a calling card for the series which unfurls over the coming month.\n\nThis raw and urgent tale of an escaped anti-capitalist terrorist (played by Belvaux himself) attempting to restart an anachronistic urban revolution leaves the viewer panting for more. From the harsh efficiency of the opening escape to the Seventies-inflected nihilism of the ice-cold ending - via Taxi Driver-style interludes of solitary weapons fetishism and outbursts of functional violence - Trilogy: One hits all the right buttons.\n\nMost impressively, the very contemporary theme of rebels succumbing to domestic bliss only to be haunted by the ghosts of a violent past is brilliantly personified by Jeanne (Catherine Frot), a 'good mother' torn between aiding a former comrade and protecting her new family. Imagine the 'school's out' scene from Tarantino's vacuous Kill Bill: Volume One played straight rather than for postmodern thrills and you'll get some sense of the intelligent tension evoked by Belvaux's gem. Urged along by the menacing strings of a lurking double bass score which pursues our anti-hero from the streets to the hills, this is a first class first instalment for Trilogy, and a tough act to follow for Two and Three, whose central characters we have now met and wish to know better."
