        "text": "French New Wave artists like Francois Truffaut, Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard opened many people’s eyes to movies.\n\nBut before them there was Jean Vigo, Jean Renoir and Marcel Carne, just to name a few.\n\nOver the years, France has continued to turn out great films, although, unfortunately, they have become harder to see as art houses close.\n\nRecently, though, as the Oscar-winning best picture “The Artist” proved, the French still know how to open people’s eyes.\n\nSo, Francophiles, celebrate. On Monday, at the Directors Guild Theater Complex, the 16th Annual City of Lights, City of Angels film festival begins an eight-day run with the North American premiere of “My Way” (“Cloclo”).\n\nFlorent-Emilio Siri’s biopic of iconic French singer Claude Francois is already a hit in France. The pop star, by many accounts, was eccentric, to say the least. He died in 1978, at age 39, bizarrely electrocuted in a bathtub, setting off a wave of grief from his adoring fans. If the film’s title sounds familiar, Francois co-wrote the original song that became the basis for the Frank Sinatra hit.\n\nThe closing film, April 22, will be “The Intouchables,” a hit comedy starring veteran French actor Francois Cluzet and Cesar winner for best actor, Omar Sy. It’s an odd-couple comedy, the story of an aristocrat, Philippe (Cluzet), who becomes paralyzed and picks a young man from the projects (Sy) to be his companion even though the youth has no pity for the rich man.\n\nAltogether, the festival will present 34 features and 21 shorts, including 10 North American and U.S. premieres, and 14 West Coast premieres.\n\nOther highlights include 13-time Cesar-nominated drama “Polisse,” directed by actress Maiwenn; “Americano” from writer/director/co-star Mathieu Demy, with Salma Hayek; “Farewell My Queen,” directed by Benoit Jacquot; “The Minister,” written and directed by Pierre Schoeller; the 3-D presentation of “A Monster in Paris,” an animated feature from Bibo Bergeron (the family film will be dubbed in English); the thriller “38 Witnesses,” written and directed by Lucas Belvaux; and “The Art of Love,” a comedy from writer-director Emmanuel Mouret.\n\nThere also will be a tribute to screen legend Yves Montand, with a rare presentation of the restored “Call Me Savage” from director Jean-Paul Rappeneau.\n\nFor this year’s Carte Blanche program, Oscar-winning writer-director Alexander Payne selected “Hotel du Nord” directed by Marcel Carne; and the film noir series will include the West Coast premiere of “Paris by Night,” from Philippe Lefebvre.\n\nWriter-director-actress Julie Delpy will be honored on Thursday with a screening of her new film, “Le Skylab.” She will be on hand – as will a number of the filmmakers throughout the week – to discuss her movie.\n\nThe festival will officially close April 23 with the screening of the two award- winning features and two winning shorts as determined by audience votes."
