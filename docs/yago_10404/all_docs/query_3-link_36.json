It begins with lawyer Alain (Morel) showing up late for his surprise birthday party. His wife (Muti) is disturbed by his strange behavior. Could he be having an affair? She asks Agnès if her husband Pascal (Melki), a police inspector, would keep an eye on him. But when Alain sees Pascal and Cécile together, he forgets all about his imminent operation. Evidently, his wife must be cheating on him. It makes no sense to pretend this is a discrete film. It's the grand design that's so compelling, the prismatic effects of genre, the correspondences, connections and coincidences the triptych throws up.” – Time Out. 35mm. Approx. 97 min.",
