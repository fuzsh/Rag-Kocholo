        "text": "An Austin man was sentenced to 35 years in prison Friday for the 2011 stabbing death of his wife.\n\nJames Boggs III, 46, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in Travis County District Court for killing his wife, Cynthia Hegemier-Boggs, in their South Manchaca home. The pair had been married for about eight years at the time of the incident. Hegemier-Boggs' brother, Ricardo Valenzuela, said in court Friday that he was able to forgive Boggs for the murder.\n\n\"Your life is done, and with that, I can find peace,\" he told Boggs in the courtroom. \"And in that peace, my peace, I can say I forgive you so I can go on with my life.\"\n\nHegemier-Boggs, 49, was found stabbed to death from what investigators called a \"frenzied attack\" on Aug. 1, according to an indictment filed the day after the murder.\n\nBoggs told police officers that he and his wife had been arguing and that he had spent the night in his car to give the pair some space, according to the court document. The couple frequently fought, records state, and Boggs threatened to kill his wife with a baseball bat in 2010.\n\nOn the afternoon of Aug. 1, after trying in vain to reach his mother by phone, Hegemier-Boggs' adult son went to her home. When he arrived, the affidavit states, Boggs greeted him bare-chested and holding a bloody knife.\n\n\"Boggs, while bloodied and wielding a knife, asked (the son) if he wanted to see her corpse,\" records state.\n\nOn Friday, Boggs walked into state District Judge Cliff Brown's courtroom in his gray and black, striped prison uniform to take his plea deal while about a half-dozen of Hegemier-Boggs' family members looked on.\n\nValenzuela took a few minutes to address Boggs from the witness stand in the allocation part of the trial.\n\nHegemier-Boggs was a good sister, daughter, mother, friend and confidante, he said. Prison, he said, would deliver Boggs a harsh punishment for his crimes.\n\n\"Where you're going is a place where there is no love, no trust,\" he said. \"There is no rest or real peace.\"\n\nContact Andrea Ball at 912-2506"
