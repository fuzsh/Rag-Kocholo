I just finished watching the segment of Dr. Richard Boggs, Melvin Eugene Hanson, and John Hawkins and their insurance scam and murder of Ellis Henry Greene in California in 1988.\n\nFilmRise: Season 2, Episode 10\n\nAll three were convicted, though Hawkins was a lighter sentence as his role was the insurance scam, not the murder. I know he is alive and has since been released. Boggs died in prison in 2003.\n\nHanson was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. However, he is not found with the California inmate locater, nor have I found any record of him passing away. If alive, he is 79-81 years old.\n\nHas anyone heard that he has died?"
