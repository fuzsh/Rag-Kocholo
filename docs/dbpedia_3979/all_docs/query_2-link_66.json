        "text": "With a song in his heart and a smile that could brighten the gloomiest of days, it was a pleasure to know and love Frank Boggs. A hard working man, Frank lived with integrity and by the values for which he was raised. He helped anyone in need, always offering a helping hand. Frank was a survivor in the true sense of the word. He survived through the battles war, and a bout with cancer. He was grateful for the family entrusted to his care, and with ways all his own, conveyed his love for them in numerous ways. In them he found his greatest joy as he leaves lasting memories to be forever treasured.\n\nThe year 1929 was a time of mixed blessings in our nation. While prohibition was law of the land, families enjoyed the debut of Amos and Andy, and became thrilled by the first public television demonstration. Although the fall of the stock market was the beginning of the Great Depression, many found much to be thankful for. For Thomas and Mary J. (Widup) Boggs of Whitley County, Indiana, nothing was as exciting as the blessed birth of their little boy, Frank, born on December 22, 1929.\n\nBorn in Thorncreek Township, young Frank grew up on the very farm that had been in his family for years. His father farmed and raised cows while his mother was a busy homemaker. Frank was one of nine children in his bustling household which included his brothers, Jim, John, and Richard, and sisters, Martha, Jane, Margy, Jean, and Nancy. Despite the tumultuous times of the Great Depression, Frank led a typical life of a young boy growing up on his family's farm. He experienced many adventures of childhood there, but the main focus was on farm chores, including milking the cows. Frank's father served as the Trustee of Thorncreek Township and knew well the value of education. In fact, he was instrumental in the building of the Thorncreek Township School where Frank and his siblings attended.\n\nDuring the height of World War II, Frank attended Columbia City High School where he played on the school's football team. Even though the war had come to a thankful end by the time he graduated in 1948, Frank felt the call to duty and joined the U.S. Army. He enlisted twice, beginning in July of 1948. For a time he served as an Honor Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and also stood rank at the funeral of General Pershing. As an infantry squad leader in a heavy weapons company, Frank went on to serve as a paratrooper during the Korean War with the 187th Division. A proud and honorable Veteran, Frank gave his all, and then some.\n\nFollowing his honorable discharge from the service, Frank returned home to Indiana where he met his future wife, Sherrill D. Allen who captured his heart. They began dating, fell deeply in love, and were happily married in Warsaw, Indiana on November 1, 1952. Frank supported his new bride working the family farm where in time he purchased two acres from his father to build the home where he and Sherrill began a family of their own. This would become their forever home together where numerous memories were made and cherished. With two wonderful daughters and a loving wife under his wing, Frank made a good home for his family. He raised Deborah and Wendy with pride, and taught them the value of hard work, as well.\n\nFrank was a lifetime member of Grace Lutheran Church where his family faithfully attended. As a family they took several vacations and road trips, but one of the most memorable for Frank was the time he took them to Washington, D.C. He was proud of his military duties in and around the city, and was excited to show them around. When he took Sherrill and the girls to the Pentagon Building for lunch in the cafeteria, he told them they may even have the opportunity to eat with four star generals. After waiting 30 minutes just to get up to the cashier, Sherrill soon realized Frank stepped away. When getting to the head of the line to pay, she discovered she didn't have any money. After juggling a tray of food, two children, and her belongings, she finally spotted Frank sitting at a table full of generals. He was already eating his favorite thing- stew, but as she hollered for him, Frank leapt up, knocking his stew into the air! It caused quite a commotion, and with everyone staring at them, Frank soon had everyone laughing.\n\nA fine example of all a devoted husband and dedicated father should be, Frank was always a hard worker. He believed in paying cash for things on the spot, and it wasn't uncommon for him to work two or three jobs to purchase a car or other items needed. Frank worked at the Dana Corporation of Fort Wayne for 37 years. Well admired there, he was known well for serenading his co-workers with the song, \"Happy Birthday on their special day. He also enjoyed singing the infamous tune to friends. One friend refused to tell Frank when his birthday was, so Frank decided to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him every day until his friend finally relented. Frank would even make up songs just to bring a smile to someone's day. After retiring he helped Sherrill out at her flower shop, Anything Groes, and when delivering flowers, he would also sing to the folks. Being the Democratic supporter that he was, Frank was invited to Oak Pointe in Columbia City where then Presidential nominee Barack Obama was meeting some of Whitley Countys residents. Even while there, Frank had the pleasure and opportunity to sing.\n\nAfter retiring, Frank kept busy working out and exercising at the YMCA. He enjoyed playing solitaire on the computer, and liked looking up his stocks. Frank will be remembered for many things, but when Frank Boggs comes to mind, they will always remember his singing, and the smile on his face. He was always willing to help anyone, and would do absolutely anything for his great-grandchildren. As a cancer survivor of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, it was his great-grandchildren who saw him through the battle. He treasured these special people in his life, and wanted to make sure he was around to see them grow up.\n\nHaving lived a life of honor and integrity, Frank was someone extra special in the lives of all he came in contact with. He rarely met a stranger, and was a friend to many. Most importantly, Frank counted his family and friends as his greatest treasure. Deeply missed, he will be long remembered for the many memories he leaves behind.\n\nFrank D. Boggs, 84, of Columbia City, Indiana passed away on Saturday, December 13, 2014 at Parkview Regional Medical Center in Fort Wayne from injuries sustained in a two car accident. Survivors include his wife of 62 years, Sherrill Boggs; daughters, Deborah K. (Mike) Reed and Wendy S. (Ed) Miller, both of Columbia City; granddaughters, Correne (Gannon) Ramy and Holly Miller, both of Fort Wayne, and Angela (Robert) Dillon and Robin Reed, both of Columbia City; great-grandchildren, Lake Dillon, E.J. Cucinelli, Kale Dillon, Kela Dillon and Norah Ramy; his brother, Richard Boggs of Toronto, Canada; and sisters, Margy Stillpass of O'Fallon, MO, Jean (Bob) OKeefe of Largo, FL, and Nancy (Norm) Hartmann of Fort Wayne. He was preceded in death by his parents; brothers, Jim Boggs and John Boggs; and sisters, Martha Hicks and Jane Trimmer.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, December 19, 2014 from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. at DeMoney-Grimes, a Life Story Funeral Home, 600 Countryside Drive, Columbia City where his funeral service will take place at 10:00 a.m. Saturday, December 20, 2014 with Pastor Jason Denniston officiating.
