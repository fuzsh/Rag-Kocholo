        "text": "The founders of an athletic clothing chain and a California doctor were charged Friday with murdering a man in a $1 million insurance swindle in which the dead man was deliberately misidentified as one of the founders.\n\nMelvin Hanson, co-founder of the Just Sweats chain; his partner, John Barrett Hawkins, and Dr. Richard Pryde Boggs of Glendale were charged with murdering Ellis Henry Greene, 32.\n\nMr. Green's body was found in Dr. Boggs's office April 16 and was misidentified as that of Mr. Hanson.\n\nMr. Hanson, 47 years old, who was arrested last week carrying Mr. Greene's driver's license, is being held in a Columbus, Ohio, jail on grand theft charges under a $5 million bond. Mr. Hawkins, 25, who under the terms of Mr. Hanson's will collected $1 million in benefits on Mr. Hanson's supposed death, remains at large. Dr. Boggs, 56, was arrested Friday and held without bail pending arraignment Monday.\n\nMr. Hanson was believed dead until mid-1988, when the police in California discovered that he was not the man who had died in Dr. Boggs's office.\n\nThe discovery and the fact that Mr. Hawkins had cashed $1 million in life insurance checks prompted the authorities to seek Federal warrants for the arrests.\n\nThe authorities say that Mr. Hanson's death was faked to collect the insurance money.\n\nThe murder charges against the three men allege special circumstances that make them eligible for the death penalty. The special circumstances are murder for financial gain and aiding and abetting.\n\nTen charges were filed against each man, including murder, conspiracy to commit murder, insurance fraud, grand theft, and assault with a stun gun.\n\nDr. Boggs told the police that he believed the man found dead in his office was Mr. Hanson. He said the man died after complaining of chest pains. Mr. Hawkins had the body cremated the next day.\n\nThe police later discovered that a thumbprint from the corpse did not match the one on Mr. Hanson's California driver's license. The body, which resembled Mr. Hanson, later was identified as that of Mr. Greene, a former Ohioan who lived in California.\n\nMr. Hanson and Mr. Hawkins are also accused of stealing about $2 million from Just Sweats, a Columbus-based chain they founded in 1985. The company has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code."
