        "text": "Helen Mae Boggs OBITUARY\n\nHelen Mae Boggs Helen Mae Boggs, long time resident of Downey passed away August 16, 2005. She was 87. Born in Duluth, Minnesota on March 29, 1918, she was raised by her paternal grandparents, Minnie and Alva Howerton. She joined her father, Earl, in Oklahoma City at age 19 where she began singing with the local bands. Known at “Boots” she met and married famed steel guitarist, Noel Boggs and together, they came to California where Noel accepted a contract to play with ” The Spade Cooley Band”. They moved to Downey in 1951 where Helen raised their three children and Noel continued with his career. He passed away in 1974. A consumate people person, Helen enjoyed her involvement in what was then the Toastmistress Organization, later becoming International Toastmasters. Her ease in front of an audience coupled with her delightful wit gave her many opportunities as a fashion show commentator, book reviewer and mistress of ceremonies. Not just satisfied with developing her own c areer, she was actively involved in her community serving on the fledgling boards of the Downey Children’s Theater, as well as the local Soroptomist Club, PTA boards for Spencer Williams Elementary, West Junior High School and Earl Warren High School. She was the Executive Secretary for the Downey Parks and Recreation District for many years as Downey grew from a sleepy asparagus patch to a busy town with high ideals. As her children grew Ms. Boggs shared her love of community and helping others as a volunt eer for the American Cancer Society. Her talents were well suited to the organization as she served as a Director for the Society in Downey. She touched people’s lives and hearts in profound ways with her abilities to recruit volunteers and guide the unit into greater service. At her retirement dinner from the American Cancer Society, the City of Downey proclaimed it Helen Boggs Day. This honor was added to a growing list of civic recognitions and awards. Always a good listener, Helen could fund raise and m end hearts simultaneously. She finally did retire at age 80, after serving as Church secretary for Downey Memorial Christian Church. She spent the next three years living in Palm Desert, but needed to return to her friends and surroundings of her hometown. In 2003 she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease and has spent the remaining years at Silverado Senior Living in Costa Mesa, California. She lived with Alzheimer’s, loving all the activity and care of Silverado and it’s staff. She remained compassionate and engaging to the end. Helen loved to laugh and will be remembered by everyone for her sense of humor, her love of people, her passion for helping others. She is survived by her three children, Noel Paul Richard Boggs of Las Vegas, Nevada; Sandra Kathleen Robertson, a.k.a. Dannielle, of Leesburg, Indiana; Debra Sue Jalhoun of Goleta, California; and only granddaughter, Erryn Brooke Blake of Warsaw, Indiana. Zrelak Family Mortuary of Downey will be handling the burial plans. She will be laid to rest in Ro se Hills, at 1 PM, on Saturday, August 20th. A memorial service will be held at Downey Memorial Christian Church, on Florence Ave in Downey, at 1:30 PM on Sunday, August 21st. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that people call a loved one and tell them a funny memory, a loving thought, an observance of their wonder in life. Helen would love that.
