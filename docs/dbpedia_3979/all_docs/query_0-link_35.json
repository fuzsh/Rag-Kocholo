        "text": "CAGLIARI, Sardinia -- An Italian appeals court Saturday granted a U.S. request for the extradition of an American wanted in the murder of an AIDS victim, who was picked up at a bar and killed in a scheme to defraud an insurance company of $1.5 million.\n\nWhen the two-day court hearing opened Friday, the accused American for the first time admitted he was John Barrett Hawkins, 28, a partner in an Ohio athletic clothing business.\n\nHawkins is wanted in California on charges of murder and conspiracy in insurance fraud and in Ohio for theft.\n\nCalifornia police accuse Hawkins of complicity in the April 1988 murder of Ellis Henry Greene, 32, an AIDS victim who was picked up at the Rawhide bar in North Hollywood and murdered, allegedly by Dr. Richard Boggs.\n\nBoggs was Hawkins' accomplice in the alleged insurance fraud, in Glendale, Calif. Hawkins and Boggs then claimed that Greene was Melvin Hanson, Hawkins' partner in the Ohio clothing business, whose life was insured for $1.5 million, with Hawkins as the sole beneficiary.\n\nHawkins allegedly had the body cremated, collected the insurance money and then fled abroad, leaving his car abandoned at the airport of Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAfter an insurance detective uncovered the fraud, Hanson and Boggs were arrested and jailed and Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Hawkins.\n\nItalian police arrested Hawkins Aug. 2 aboard his 45-foot catamaran Carpe Diem in the tiny tourist port of Cannigione, in northeast Sardinia.\n\nHawkins claimed he was Glen Donald Haweon, a British citizen born in Northern Ireland. But four days after his arrest a Cagliari court confirmed his identity as Hawkins, partly on the basis of a white birthmark on his lowerabdomen.\n\nThe U.S. application for Hawkins' extradition was long delayed by judicial procedure, complicated by the fact that Italian law bans extradition of a murder suspect to a country that has the death penalty. The objection was lifted when the U.S. Embassy in Rome gave the court formal assurance that Hawkins would not be sentenced to death.\n\nBut Hawkins' Italian defense lawyer announced he would appeal the extradition order before the Cassation court, Italy's highest court of appeal, meaning the extradition would be delayed pending the high court's ruling.\n\nOn Jan. 2 Hawkins tried to escape from Cagliari's Buoncammino jail. He sawed through the bars of his jail cell and under cover of darkness used a rope made of knotted sheets to lower himself to the prison courtyard, which is surrounded by a high wall.\n\nBut he made some noise jumping the last few feet to the ground and prison guards caught him in the courtyard.\n\n'I have never harmed anybody,' Hawkins told reporters. 'When the murder was committed I was in Ohio.'"
