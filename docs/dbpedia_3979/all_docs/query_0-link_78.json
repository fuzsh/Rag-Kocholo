        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9 -- An Ohio businessman was convicted of murder Wednesday for his part in a complex plot to kill a California man and use his body to collect nearly $1.5 million in insurance money. A Superior Court jury convicted Melvin Hanson, 53, of first-degree murder of Ellis Green, 37, and of the special circumstance of killing for financial gain. The same jury will determine whether Hanson will be sentenced to death or to life without the possibility of parole in a penalty phase set to begin Aug. 21.. But the panel deadlocked on the murder charge against Hanson's business partner and alleged accomplice, John Hawkins, 32. The panel also failed to reach a verdict on one count of insurance fraud against both men. On Tuesday, the jury had convicted Hansen and Hawkins of conspiracy to commit murder, fraud and grand theft. A third defendant, Harvard-educated neurosurgeon Dr. Richard Boggs, was convicted of murder in 1990 and sentenced to life in prison. Hawkins and Hanson were partners in a failing Columbus, Ohio, athletic clothing firm, Just Sweats. Defense attorney Henry Hall said Hanson decided to stage his death and split the money with Hawkins to keep the business afloat and they planned to get a body from a hospital or morgue for the scheme. Prosecutors said Boggs killed Greene in his Glendale office, then dialed 911 to report that Hanson had died. Hanson's credit cards and birth certificate were found on the body. An autopsy initially indicated the victim had died of natural causes.\n\nHawkins flew into town, had the corpse of his 'business partner' cremated and then filed the insurance claims. But an insurance investigator asked for fingerprint verification and a check showed the body was not Hanson's but that of Green, a North Hollywood bookkeeper. Friends said Greene was last seen on April 15, 1988, drinking at several bars. Boggs claimed he didn't kill Greene but misidentified his body because Hanson had threatened to expose his homosexuality and ruin his medical practice if he did not sign a phony death certificate. Hanson and Hawkins fled the country after collecting the insurance money. Hanson was arrested as he crossed back into the United States from Mexico and Hawkins was arrested on the Italian island of Sardinia."
