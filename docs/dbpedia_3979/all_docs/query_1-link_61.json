        "text": "By the time he celebrated his 25th birthday, John Hawkins was flying high as the co-owner of Columbus-based Just Sweats, a clothing retailer with 22 stores in Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nPropelled by a series of seemingly ubiquitous TV commercials - all of which featured the wavy-haired, always-smiling entrepreneur - the chain's annual sales were approaching $10 million. Would-be franchisees were lining up, and major players in the athletic-wear industry were looking to invest.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the man who was once a household name across central Ohio is living with his mother in an RV park in San Diego. And, after 25 years of uncharacteristic silence (aided by two decades behind bars in California), the one-time pitchman is talking again.\n\n\"I got more attention that I should have gotten - more attention than most 25-year-olds get - and it went to my head,\" the self-described narcissist said, opening up about his past in an hourlong interview, portions of which will air at 11 tonight on WBNS-TV (Channel 10).\n\n\"My focus was always on being successful.\"\n\nHawkins said the $1.5 million insurance scheme that landed him in prison initially seemed like an easy way for him and his business partner, Melvin Hanson, to get what each wanted: \"He was going to get all the money, and I was going to get his shares in the company.\"\n\nTheir plan called for the heavily insured Hanson to fake his own death - with the help of Hanson's physician, a California neurologist named Richard Boggs - so that the insurance settlement would go to Hawkins, the sole beneficiary.\n\n\"The doctor would purchase a cadaver from a medical school or a teaching hospital, identify the body as my business partner, sign the death certificate 'natural causes' and send the body to a mortuary,\" Hawkins said. \"My role was to have the body cremated, scatter the ashes at sea and collect the insurance money.\"\n\nBoggs, however, didn't buy a body. In April 1988, he picked up a man at a bar, suffocated him and then told police that the man - supposedly Hanson, his patient - had died during a visit to his office. The \"patient\" was actually Ellis Greene, who, by sheer coincidence, had grown up in Ohio.\n\nLess than three months later, Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. sent Hawkins a check for $1 million. Within days, though, investigators determined that the dead man's fingerprints did not match Hanson's, which authorities had on file. Two other insurance companies refused to pay smaller claims filed by Hawkins.\n\n\"At that point, I pressed the panic button and ran,\" Hawkins said. \"They call it the 'Mad Cash Dash.' I went around to all the banks in Columbus and got as much money as I could.\"\n\nHaving withdrawn close to $400,000 from Just Sweats' accounts, Hawkins fled the United States and bought a sailboat so he could move easily from place to place. It was named Carpe Diem, Latin for \"seize the day.\"\n\nHawkins partied almost nonstop, seeking the comfort of alcohol and women. He insists he wasn't trying to elude police so much as trying to escape the guilt he felt because of Greene's murder.\n\n\"I was lost - really lost.\"\n\nAfter three years, Italian authorities, acting on a tip from someone who'd seen a segment about Hawkins on The Oprah Winfrey Show, found the fugitive on his boat, anchored off the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.\n\nHanson and Boggs, who'd been arrested in 1989, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Boggs died in 2003 at age 69. Hanson, 72, is incarcerated at the California Men's Colony, a minimum- and medium-security facility in San Luis Obispo, according to California's inmate database.\n\nHawkins was found guilty of fraud, theft and conspiracy to commit murder. His prison sentence: 25 years to life.\n\n\"The most horrible thing is losing your freedom - and being separated from the people you love,\" he said.\n\nTo help overcome the loneliness of incarceration, Hawkins got involved in a program designed to help troubled teens. He described it as \"an opportunity to give back and make amends.\" It also helped him secure his early release in March 2012.\n\nWhile he's thrilled to be free, Hawkins said adjusting to life outside prison has been challenging at times. He had to learn to use a computer. His mother had to talk him into getting a cell phone. Eighteen months passed before he went on a date.\n\nHawkins now spends part of each day at a beach near the RV park, basking, he said, in the seemingly infinite space and freedom the ocean represents. He also makes time to speak at any school that will have him, doing his best, he said, to steer young people away from the bad choices he made.\n\nHawkins said he still thinks about Greene every day.\n\n\"My actions caused immeasurable devastation in (his) family's life,\" he said.\n\nEven so, for the most part, Hawkins is at peace with the past and with himself.\n\n\"I just feel very blessed to have a second chance.\"\n\njerry.revish@10tv.com"
