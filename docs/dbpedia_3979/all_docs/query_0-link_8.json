        "meta_description": "Doctor of Death: With Richard Boggs. California neurologist, Dr. Richard Pryde Boggs, calls paramedics when \"myocarditis\" claims one of this patients, Melvin Eugene Hanson, while in his office. Hanson had informed friends he has a serious heart condition and recently relocated to be under Dr. Boggs' personal care. On April 16, 1988, when EMT/police arrive at the scene, they become suspicious at once, since this doctor is not a cardiologist, sees the patient unusually early in the morning, should have sent Hanson an ambulance and met him at an ER, rather than advising he drive to an unequipped office. More telling, the body's temperature doesn't coincide with time of death. Many other inconsistencies occur, statements do not check out and protocol is not followed. Thereon, a thorough investigation is launched. It soon is exposed that Melvin Eugene Hanson had a $1.5 million dollar life insurance policy in the name of his partner, John Barrett Hawkins, of Studio 54 fame. The latter positively identified Hanson's body. Also, due to age and \"natural cause of death,\" Hawkins was able to insist on Hanson's quick cremation. Thus, no autopsy can be performed to search for further clues. Therefore, the insurance company must honor their policy and pay Hawkins. Shockingly, though, while inspecting the claim, they rapidly discover through photographs and personal information that the deceased may not even be Hanson, but a \"John Doe\" victim. If so, where is the real Melvin Eugene Hanson? John Hawkins has now disappeared. How are they connected to Dr. Boggs and why?",
