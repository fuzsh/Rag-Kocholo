Joining the U.S. Airforce right out of High School, Rick served proudly before settling in Southern California where he raised six children before making his way east to live near his sister. It was there he met the love of his life Lil Bit (Pat); they married in 2007 and lived a full life in Kasson, MN.\n\nRick enjoyed riding his Harley, wheeling, BBQing, and spending time with all his great family and friends. In 2021, Rick and Pat fulfilled their dream of living on a lake and purchased a lake home outside of Danbury, WI. Rick was known for his great stories, talking to anyone that would listen which led to his nick name “He who talks a lot,” his giving of nicknames to friends and family, and his now famous greetings.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents; brothers; sister; and a son.\n\nRick is survived by his wife of 15 years, Lil Bit (Pat); his stepmother, Jeanie Boggs; daughter, Angie Boggs; sons, Randy, Darrell, Buddy, James (Amy), and Richard Boggs, sons, Michael Pariana (Abbie) and Adam Friederichs; 17 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren; along with many friends.\n\nRick was never shy to tell his family and friends he loved them before parting, it was always very important to him. His final “Love you Bye” is in the planning stages and details will be shared on social media for family and friends.\n\nArrangements were entrusted to Swedberg-Taylor Funeral Home.\n\nLast Update: Mar 08, 2023 12:12 pm CST"
