STANLEY BOGGS Stanley Marvin Boggs was born in Chico, California, on October 11, 1929, to William Everett and Madge Richardson and died on May 19, 2012, in Chico, California. He was 82.

He is survived by his brother, Richard Boggs; sons, David and Mike; and daughter, Sandra.

Stanley served in the Naval Reserves from 1947-1955 and was very proud of his family members who served their country in the military. He was a long-time employee of the telephone company and stayed close with his coworkers after retirement.

Stanley was a father first and a teacher secondthroughout his lifetime, he has taught many people how to hunt and fish. He was respected as the “go to guy” by his family and friends. He was an avid rifle hunter and bow hunter and traveled to many different states to hunt large game and try different fishing holes. Stanley created many special memories for his family and friends telling stories, sitting at dinner in his trailer or around a campfire at a favorite camp. He was very interested in his family’s genealogy and this passion took him and Beverly all over the United States doing research.

He taught his children and many of his grandchildren how to drive a car and also how to work on those cars. He was quick to offer assistance no matter the task or the situation. He was kind and loving and always had PopTarts in his cupboard for his grandchildren.

A memorial service for Stanley will be on Saturday, June 2, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. at Chico Bible Fellowship at Arbutus and 5th Avenue in Chico.
