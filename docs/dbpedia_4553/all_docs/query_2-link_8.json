        "text": "Just a reminder to all who are still interested in a new LPFM station for their organization. Thursday (September 28) is the last full day I am taking Show of Interest requests at REC for application handling. Please visit https://LPFM.app to start the process. We will have the following requirements from the get go: * The organization must already have an active corporate status with any state. (Make sure you let us know which state it is) * You must already have a tower/antenna site picked out and you use that site in your search. * You must have assurance from the site owner or their authorized representative to use that site in the event of a grant. You will need to provide us with their name and telephone number (we are not going to call them, but it needs to be on the application). Additional tips: * Please get an FRN from the FCC CORES system. You will need your organization's IRS EIN to fill out that form. * Think about your organization's educational statement. The FCC will need to know, to get you through the process: (1) what educational objectives does your organization have before broadcasting and (2) how will a radio station advance those educational objectives. * Knowing your proposed technical parameters, such as how high of a tower you will be able to place at a location if there isn't one already there or knowing what heights are available on an existing tower will be very helpful. * Gather your board members information including name, their title, their residential address, their telephone number and email address. Qualifications: * Organization must either have their headquarters location or 75% of the board members with the local area. * Local area is considered within 20 miles, except in counties considered Nielsen Audio top-50 metro market counties where the distance is 10 miles. * Board members should have no past felony arrests, not previously engaged in pirate radio, have no other AM/FM/TV broadcast ownership holdings or board memberships and are not denied student loans and other federal benefits because of past drug convictions.\n\nAfter the Digital Markets Act entered into force, I received questions from non-EU game devs trying to determine if the rights and safeguards brought by the act also cover them. Leading global talent and some of the best public funding instruments are no longer the only key reasons to have a studio in the EU. If you have a studio in the EU, you have the right and means to fight back when a gatekeeper platform removes your game from an application store. Therefore, these Commission's preliminary conclusions on Apple's non-compliance and notification of further investigations on Apple's compliance with DMA are crucial. They demonstrate that the Commission is taking action to ensure that the new rights of game developers are correctly implemented and that the Commission is taking the feedback from stakeholders like EGDF seriously. If you have any further concerns about Apple's Core Technology fee, Apple's user journey to download and install games outside the Apple Appstore or the eligibility requirements for launching your own third-party application stores or making your games available for sideloading directly from the web, do not hesitate to share them with the Commission. If you are afraid of sharing the information directly, EGDF is more than happy to share feedback with the Commission on your behalf. https://lnkd.in/ghjth6P3\n\nI am thrilled to announce the return of Flash.gr, a stalwart in the realm of information dissemination.

Unfortunately, instead of being influential, WISPA is woefully mismanaged by good ol’ boys who are lining up at the trough in search of government handouts. 🐷 WISPA Group 2.0 is a parody group. Unlike the legacy WISPA Group, this group values free expression and outside opinion. We are not trying to force consensus. This group also understands the importance of vendors. We do not prohibit vendors from sharing their WISP related products and services. Instead we encourage it! This is an unmoderated group which means the algorithms will decide what content is relevant and the First Amendment (and Facebook's Terms of Service) will decide what is allowed. If you don't like what someone has to say, scroll, unfollow, or block. You don't get to control the conversation for everyone else. https://lnkd.in/eGeBh9YE\n\n🔒 Lock In Your Membership Rate for 3 Years at Just $200/Year! 🔒 For most of my career, I didn't feel the need to join a community of designers. Working alongside other creatives was my norm. But as the industry evolved, so did my work environment.
