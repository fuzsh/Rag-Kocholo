        "text": "X (formerly Twitter) can no longer be accessed in the Mac App Store, suggesting that it has been officially delisted.\n\nSearches for both “Twitter” and “X” on Apple’s platform no longer surface the app. The URL no longer works, either. Instead, it displays a pop-up message indicating that it is unavailable. This means new users can no longer download the service, instead having to rely on the browser-based version.\n\nSome who already have the app installed reported they can still use it. Others, meanwhile, have reported that utilizing the iPad version on MacOS could potentially cause its own issues.\n\nX has not confirmed when the app was delisted and has not yet responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\n\nToday may mark the end of the company’s Mac app — which many users have complained was buggy. After Elon Musk rebranded Twitter to X in 2023, the new name was implemented across all platforms except for the Mac app, which had not seen an update in roughly a year.\n\nIt’s unclear if X plans to disable functionality for the Twitter for Mac app altogether. We’ll update when more information is available."
