        "text": "Learning a new language can be complicated, especially if you don’t have anywhere to practice the new vocabulary and language rules you’re learning.\n\nThis week Duolingo announced a new partnership with Twitch that might make finding that practice space a little easier.\n\nWith the new partnership, Duolingo has identified a number of streamers as Insiders, which are part of the Global Ambassador program, just like Hosts and Contributors on the platform. None of them are language experts, but they are multilingual or are working on learning a second language as well, and they encourage viewers to practice the languages that they know in Twitch chat.\n\nDuolingo has all of the Verified Streamers listed here as well as what languages they speak or are learning.\n\nIf you’re learning a new language, then trying to speak it in actual conversations rather than just through a language learning course can be invaluable. Duolingo is great for helping you get basic vocabulary and grammar down, but something like this can be great for getting a little practice in as well."
