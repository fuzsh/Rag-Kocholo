Why?\n\n0:01:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthank you. Now there's Leo Laporte and Velvet, also looking sharp.\n\n0:01:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nCan I take you to your table, sir Mikah Sargent? Party of two. Every time I wear a tux this is a perp for those listening purple velvet tux that I got for last year's TWIT cruise to Alaska, so probably still soaked with COVID. But anyway, every time I wear a tux I feel like I don't look fancy, I look like a Mater D, because these days all the only people you see wearing a tux are service personnel.\n\n0:02:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nright yeah, and the only people wearing three piece seats suits are wedding goers.\n\n0:02:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, but you know what you did this last week to me. I thought, I better wear the tux. This is going to do it again, who knows? Anyway, this is the show where you answer your computer or technology questions, your pewter question? It's the Sharp Dress Tech Guys episode. What is this 1997. That can't be, do you?\n\n0:02:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nremember 1997? Wow, I cannot believe we're on 1997. Let's see Five. Yeah, I do, I do. I remember getting Ringworm that year. I remember Such fond memories, so nostalgic it was in California.\n\n0:03:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd at that point, they still had sandboxes.\n\n0:03:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI was Mary Faye Pendleton school.\n\n0:03:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, wait a minute.\n\n0:03:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, wait a minute. How old were you? I would have been five, 97. Five years old.\n\n0:03:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nUgh, ok, yeah, never mind, let's stop talking about the year of the Ringworm Five years old.\n\n0:03:27 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI thought you were an adult.\n\n0:03:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI thought, oh, he came out to California to visit us or something In 97?\n\n0:03:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI forgot how young you are. That's wow If you think I'm 40 and I look like this. That is very kind of you. You look every bit of 31 or whatever you are, I will be 31 this year.\n\n0:03:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet us tell you the phone number 888-724-2884. 888-724-2884. We are live Sundays, 2 to 5 PM Eastern, 11 to 2 Pacific. So if you're watching at that time, you can call right now. Actually you can call anytime. Maybe you leave a voice message if we're not here, but you will get through Absolutely.\n\n0:04:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nCan they zoom us? They can. They can zoom us by going to calltwittv. We suggest going to it on your mobile device, because if you do, you've got the phone that has the camera and the microphone right there. So you head to calltwittv in your browser of choice, give the browser permission to access your camera and your microphone and you will go into a waiting room where we will have the opportunity to bring you up on stage. We ask that you do raise your virtual hand in Zoom. There is a button to do so. Trevor does, trevor does and Micah from Maine does. Yes, maine and Micah as well, and that is because we do have people who just like to tune in on Zoom and watch the show.\n\nSomebody just sit there like J-O-I-O-G, j-o-i-o-g, which is supposed to be his rap name. Yeah, I think so, yeah, and so that's a great way to get in touch. Or you can also email us at at twittv. When you email us there with your question or your audio or your video, that is also an opportunity to get on the show and also work out Leo's rotator cuff.\n\n0:05:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nBecause I stick the email back here. Hey, mark German's newsletter came out this morning, 5.10 am, october 22nd. Why is he working on this? I know why. Why are you so busy? Headline Inside Apple's big plan to bring genitive AI to its devices? Yawn, but wait, watch, go back to my screen, because watch, way down, way down upon the swanee river.\n\nApple's iMacs and MacBook Pros are in short supply. Rights Mark German, who is, we gotta say, the most reliable rumor guy of all, ahead of planned launch at the end of the month. So Apple's last updated the iMac in April of 2021. Since then, news about a follow-up model has been as elusive as a PowerBook G5. I don't even know. I don't get the reference. In an era of in-house Apple chips, it's rare for a Mac to go this long without an upgrade. It's been 900 days. This was never the plan. They wanted to do a larger and even Mark had even said this pro-focused iMac soon after the little 24-inch iMac launched. You know, of course. I know why this happened Because Lisa just replaced her iMac Pro or Intel iMac Pro with the 24-inch iMac. So of course, apple's going to know. Perfect timing.\n\nI'm told, says Mark German again reliable source the company tabled the iMac Pro plan a while ago due to cost concerns. Anyway, a new iMac is finally on the way. The company is readying the updated 24-inch that's not the 30. Apple's planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month.\n\n0:07:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOn the 30th or the 31st is the desk.\n\n0:07:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's Halloween. Don't do it on Halloween. I don't want to see Tim Cook in us. Spooky what costume would Tim Cook wear?\n\n0:07:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSnoopy or something. Yeah, yeah, he do a.\n\n0:07:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nMaybe you look like Bono. You have Bono dresses, tim Cook, that'd be funny.\n\n0:07:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWith the finger touch, the infamous finger touch. So awkward. Et fun home. Anyway, what a shocker. Yeah, because we thought that at this point there wouldn't be any new announcements. But yeah, could see some MacBook Pros and a new 24-inch iMac.\n\n0:07:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nI do want to reiterate. There is a MacBook Pro no one should ever buy, absolutely. There is 13-inch, because it is not good. I don't know why you should either get the 14 or 16 when it comes out. The problem is they'll probably. If they're going to push a 13-inch, this would be when they do it. So we just want to give you proactively. Don't get your hopes up. If they put out a 13, don't buy it. I actually made a note to myself some months ago, leo. I said do not buy a new MacBook until a 14-inch M3. And this I said to myself self with an OLED screen, but a mini LED screen would be the next thing, would be OK.\n\n0:08:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo OLED, or better, well, oled. I guess they're not. Yeah, it's too good. Micro.\n\n0:08:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nLED probably would be better than OLED, but I don't think they're going to do that. But a mini LED would be pretty good, not as good as OLED, I think. Anyway, I made a note, so I wouldn't like you know how Odysseus had his men tie him to the mast so he could hear the sirens singing, and wouldn't be? I know the sirens will be singing on October 30. So tie me to the mast, tie you to the mast, and even if I say, but I have to have it, you say no, you don't. No, leo, you said you wouldn't do it. Thanks, I needed that. A little note from a little. This is kind of an inside note to listeners of our shows and viewers of our shows.\n\nEero Plus has an ad blocker right, it does you use it, I do yes, and it apparently is blocking some of our servers. I've heard it's blocking CacheFly, which is our CDN, as you know from all our ads, but it may also be blocking Libsyn, which it does our advertised cast. They host some of our content. Podsites, which is Spotify, ad analytics. Podscribe most of our stuff doesn't have that in it or Memberful, which is for club twit folks. So we're not sure what they're blocking, but we have a blog post by our own, patrick De La Hante. If you go to this week or twittv and look at the blog post, eero Plus Update Made Blog Podcast, it'll tell you what to whitelist. And Eero, when we called them, said well, if you're having problems, would you have? If you're listeners are having problems, you have them. Contact us at supporteerocom. So I would like to get at there's no reason, cachefly should be blocked.\n\nI can understand if they want to block some ad networks.\n\n0:10:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI have actually had some issues with the ad blocking that Eero does anyway. As you know, my partner has a PlayStation 5 and their.\n\n0:10:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nI bought it for him as a gift. It was a gift, let me get some credit for crying out loud, and so as you know, as you very well know, gave it to him yes.\n\n0:10:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat was the point.\n\n0:10:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd so I know, but the point was only known to me.\n\n0:10:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLook, sometimes people want to share that with the world.\n\n0:10:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh you didn't know you were protecting, I was protecting, just my generosity, because I might be one of those people who gives with the left hand without the right hand knowing Exactly. I wanted to let you in charge of that Both hands. Both hands get to know.\n\n0:10:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo point is playing on the network or whatever and getting notifications saying that the network is not able to connect in some ways, and this and that and the other, and I would toggle off Eero's ad blocking and then it would start working. So it's blocking stuff that it shouldn't be blocking. I ended up going into the AdList or the Allow List, rather, and adding a bunch of PlayStation server things and we have also created you can go to twittv slash allow list, which will now contain the various domains that you should add to Twittv slash allow list.\n\n0:11:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll one word, All one word, All one word, lowercase, that's so you know what to tell your ad blocker, whatever it is, if you want to get, if you're having trouble getting our podcasts, I promise you we're not doing anything nefarious or evil or wrong. We just different people host the shows. We've got almost everything's on cash fly, but some of it's on Libsyn and that is so we can use their Advertise Cast which puts ads in empty slots, that kind of there's. You know, look, folks, I've told you before advertising and podcasting has gotten very tricksy. For some reason, podcast advertisers advertise, are decided they don't like podcasts. Everybody wants to be on Marquez Brownlee's YouTube channel. Yeah, a lot of YouTube, not us anymore.\n\nSo, as a result, you know we have to do whatever we can because they're making demands, but we will never, I promise you we're not gonna spy on you. We really try to keep this as limited as possible and we can't because it's a podcast and because it's Sunday. You know, nfl day, big Sunday.\n\n0:12:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI see what's on your screen.\n\n0:12:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou see it's a big Sunday. Just want everybody to know Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey's relationship definitely isn't a fling. Okay, just wanted everybody to know that in tech news that's the hot tech news. Okay, you could stop now. We actually have a big event coming up on Tuesday. That's right, qualcomm. So we've talked a lot about how great we think the M1 chips, the M2 chips, are in the Apple. Their Apple Silicon has just leapfrogged over everybody else and really I love these M1 based machines or M2 based machines. But Microsoft and Intel and everybody else says, well, you know, we can do this, we can do this, we can do this we can do it.\n\nIntel is yet to Qualcomm, which makes ARM chips for phones but also makes and I think has an exclusive with Microsoft for ARM chips for Windows. On ARM has said we have licked it, we figured it out and we can make a chip every bit as good as apples. Watch us Snapdragon X. They are having their annual Snapdragon event is Tuesday. Keynote is at noon on Tuesday Pacific, 3 pm Eastern. We will stream it. We'll cover it because I think it's gonna be important, so you're gonna start a little bit early. On iOS today that is correct.\n\n0:13:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, 8.30 as opposed to nine. We'll start a little early.\n\n0:13:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd Mac break weekly will start now or early, 10, as opposed to 11. This is all Pacific time, and immediately after Mac break weekly, the Qualcomm event, followed by security. Now. So a little program of note, and I think this is. We'll see.\n\n0:14:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe may be wrong, right, but I know that the Windows watchers of the world are also interested in what Snapdragon is doing. They would love.\n\n0:14:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nI mean, can you? I mean, I mean, I'd like it for Linux too. If you wanna use a PC, why should you not get the efficiency and the performance of Apple Silicon Do?\n\n0:14:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nyou think that this could also push forward, in a way, Mac gaming? If the Windows side of thing is things that suddenly run on ARM chips and that becomes more viable, could we then see gaming developers really start to focus on ARM chips as the basis of what they're doing? You think that would have an impact at all?\n\n0:14:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, no okay, mostly because Apple has a completely different technology for graphics the metal Metal, yeah, versus the DirectX that's used on Windows and I you know really this is a complicated subject. Most games are developed on game engines, either the Unreal Engine or Unity. Unreal Engine doesn't outrun an Apple. Most of the best games on Windows are running on Unreal Engine, so those will never run an Apple because it's complicated, it's hard to port it over to Unity. A lot of unit games do run an Apple, but not all so. And then if you're not using an engine, then you're writing your own kind of graphics engine and you're probably gonna base it on DirectX, which does not work on Apple, as opposed to Apple's metal, which does not work on Windows. So there's more than just the instruction set of the processor, unfortunately. I wish it weren't so. However, you know we're seeing some pretty good games on the AMX side. Slowly but surely.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is on Macintosh, which is nice.\n\n0:15:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah.\n\n0:15:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's one of your favorites, isn't John Ashley? I believe it is.\n\n0:15:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI haven't been playing him. My girlfriend, Lindsay, has been playing the heck out of it, though she is six campaigns in D. Wow. She hasn't beated the game yet, though I know our own. Anthony Nielsen, also very much likes that, and Paris Martino is a big Baldur's Gate fan.\n\n0:16:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh sweet yeah, all right, enough of us gabbing away. John Ashley, producer man, we've got Dick D Bartola we're gonna celebrate. One of the reasons we're dressed up Dick is celebrating his 78th birthday this week, so we've got Dick coming up. We're gonna celebrate his birthday party at noon. Right, yeah, and I think we should do some calls. But do you think maybe I should take a commercial break here? Is it too soon?\n\n0:16:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI wouldn't say no, personally.\n\n0:16:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, yes, that's what I like a producer with convictions, ha ha ha ha.\n\n0:16:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI'm yes, let's take it. A convicted producer, a conviction, yeah, he is Okay.\n\n0:16:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell so, when you guys, when you guys hired me, never convicted, never, let's just say Never.\n\n0:16:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOnly charged, never convicted. That's the name of my autobiography.\n\n0:17:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nHa ha ha ha, I feel like Jerry Lewis. In this outfit You'll never walk alone. Our show today brought to you by. I'm so actually thrilled to have these guys. Wix web agencies you're gonna love this one.\n\nLet me tell you about Wix Studio. It's the platform that gives agencies total creative freedom to deliver complex client sites while still smashing deadlines. How Well. First, let's talk about the advanced design capabilities.

Find out more at wix.com/studio. Thank you, wix. Thank you. Where does donuts go With those donuts? Burke came in here. Well, it's not fair. When I'm doing a commercial, you come in here with a striped box and then you leave before the commercial's over. You know full well. I cannot stop to say.\n\n0:18:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's why it was the perfect time. It's like he planned it.\n\n0:18:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nI guess that's probably the right way to go. Who should we start with here?\n\n0:18:49 - Caller\n\nI feel like we have to go with the main man.\n\n0:18:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMicah.\n\n0:18:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nMain man Micah. Main man Micah, welcome to the tech guy show. Come into our Stargate main man Micah. He is the one of the co-hosts of the airplane guy podcast and is an airplane aficionado and probably agrees with me that I will never fly Southwest again. Actually, I will. The next flight I'll be going down to Las Vegas. That's the easiest way to get Vegas from here. Hello, main man Micah.\n\n0:19:21 - Caller\n\nHello, can you hear me? Am I unmuted and is everything working? Everything?\n\n0:19:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nappears to be working.\n\n0:19:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe read you five by five, echo Bravo Got cleared for takeoff.\n\n0:19:32 - Caller\n\nFirst I need to apologize. I didn't get the invitation. I didn't realize it was formal, formal night. I'm underdressed, I just feel awful. I shouldn't be attending.\n\n0:19:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, actually you're perfect, because the theme tonight is under the sea and you are over the sea. That's a beautiful shot out of an airplane window, I think.\n\n0:19:53 - Caller\n\nThank you. That's someplace over Newfoundland on my way back from London last time. That's gorgeous.\n\n0:19:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, you know, it's so funny how I was thinking this is. I was taking off, did a lot of flying this last couple of days. We're hurtling through the air at 600 miles an hour, five miles above the ground.\n\n0:20:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's like we take it for granted. Yeah.\n\n0:20:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nLike no big deal.\n\n0:20:15 - Caller\n\nDon't you hate it. It drives me nuts. Everybody has their windows down. They're looking at their screen Nobody's looking. Nobody has any idea or cares, and it really kind of drives me crazy. On the 787s, the flight attendants can control the windows and they can darken them so that you can't look out whether you want to or not.\n\n0:20:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou can't open that up, huh.\n\n0:20:35 - Caller\n\nWell, no, you can't. If they do it for everyone although if you're very kind to the flight attendants, as I am, and have given them a gift ahead of time and say, you know, I'd really like to be able to look out they can individually control you.\n\n0:20:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's another thing on Southwest that it's like it doesn't have begging. On one flight they said, hey, thanks for the candy guy in a one. Oh, wow, Anybody else. Oh, wow. And then I'm getting on the flight and a guy says I'm a NASA, I work at NASA. Here have some stickers and pins I forget you got to. You now have to bribe flight attendants. That's part of the deal, johnny Jett. Now wait a minute.\n\n0:21:09 - Caller\n\nYou don't have to bribe them, but it's a nice thing to do because they work incredibly hard. Their job is not easy at all. Then and I don't know if I'll say this on the air and you can bleep me if you have to, but I always tell them I really, really want to thank you because I know you're not here to kiss my, You're here to save it.\n\n0:21:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's right, they try every once in a while. They say you know, we're not waiters, we are, we are safety personnel, that's our first job. No, I know. And they don't even get paid till their planes and you know door closes and stuff. It's just a. Anyway, I appreciate it. We had very nice. Southwest always has fun flight attendance, so I like that. That's always fun.\n\n0:21:47 - Caller\n\nSouthwest is great for what it is, but you have to remember what it is. And if you're going to fly, you know, a couple of hours it's wonderful, but if you're going to be flying cross country, you know, as you were saying before the show, leo, at our age and at our size, you want to be flying in business class. It's just the way it's got to be, you know.\n\n0:22:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah it's too bad, but that's, that's probably the case. What can we do for you, main man Micah?\n\n0:22:12 - Caller\n\nWell, I was calling about a couple of things that you spoke about last week, and I think I have a solution for one of your callers. Love that you had a recorded call from someone who was trying to find a way to use his GPS for his daughter that wouldn't re-root her, and I've got two really simple solutions, and maybe neither one would work because you guys didn't think of them, and that's why I'm a little concerned.\n\n0:22:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe've also got a lot of email chiefly turn off connectivity and then use the downloaded map. But I mean you want your phone to work. But anyway, what is your solicit suggestion?\n\n0:22:47 - Caller\n\nWell, that was mine. You turn off Wi-Fi and you turn off your, your phone, and you have the map downloaded. And cellular and you have the map downloaded and then you're all set. It won't reroute because you can't.\n\n0:22:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt has no idea what's going on.\n\n0:23:00 - Caller\n\nYeah, exactly, it's perfect, although then if you need your phone, you have to, you know, get in the settings and turn your cellular network back on. That's the simplest one, but the one that's slightly more expensive. And actually the thing that I use is I have a separate GPS in the car. Nothing works better from my perspective than a Garmin GPS. It's a much better system than any of the phone systems that I've used and better than anything built into any of the automobiles. It's designed specifically for that and you can. If you power it up without the antenna on it, you're going to get the route and it's going to be the same route each time. And it's a separate screen, which is pretty good, because that way you don't have your phone screen in front of you that's giving you text messages and all these other things that are coming in while you're driving the Garmin maps can be updated, but it is not online.\n\n0:23:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo it's using. It has the GPS satellite radio, obviously, so it can see where you are, but it's doing the map calculation internally on device right? So exactly yeah.\n\n0:24:04 - Caller\n\nNow some of them also have an antenna built into the power supply so that it can receive updates and traffic updates and it might re-root you. But you just get a standard power supply line for $5 and plug it into your well, they don't call them cigarette lighter adapters anymore but plug it into that power port and then you're all set.\n\n0:24:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nI needed a GPS because I was driving all over Providence and New England. Cities are crazy because they're old and so the streets are all kind of nutty and the drivers are even nuttier. And so I was really reliant, totally reliant on I used Apple Maps on car play and it did a good job, but I, you know, I, found myself feeling guilty. For instance, it always tries to put me on the highway and I didn't want to go on the highway and I always felt guilty, ignoring. Now merge into the freeway when I go straight. But you know the good thing about Apple Maps, it doesn't do that kind of passive, aggressive rerouting, it just silently continues on. Garmin does that, though I bet rerouting.\n\n0:25:10 - Caller\n\nYeah, it will do that. And I mentioned Garmin. There are other brands. I just happen to really like Garmin. I've always used them and I have a couple of them, and in fact I'm heading to Tampa in a month and gonna bring one with me for my rental car, because I just think it's a lot simpler than having to use my iPhone. Good answer, okay, there's two ways. That was one reason why I called. I called for another reason I took a little bit of offense when you were talking with Rod Pyle last week because you were besmirching Boeing, and while Boeing the current Boeing perhaps does deserve to be besmirched, you need to remember that.\n\n0:25:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, that's who we were besmirching. We weren't besmirching Boeing, old Boeing. We were besmirching him for the 737 MAX Fiasco, which admittedly was a misstep on their part. And mostly Rod was besmirching them for how poorly they've done the latest aerospace projects for NASA.\n\n0:26:06 - Caller\n\nWell, I can talk about the 737 MAX a little bit if you want to, but that wasn't all Boeing, tell me good stuff about. Boeing, but Boeing is not Boeing anymore. That's what you need to remember. In 1997, boeing, this incredible company run by great engineers, merged and was taken over by McDonald Douglas, this terrible company run by accountants. And McDonald Douglas bought Boeing and kept the Boeing name, that's sure. So Boeing is really McDonald Douglas right now.\n\n0:26:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nBecause you're right. I mean I love flying in the 747. I love the 777. Isn't it amazing that for years the 727 is the workhorse of airline, just went for 30 years and now I'm always happy to fly a 737. I did fly a MAX this week and I feel fine now. I know they fixed them, but you're right, I mean they made you know. What I do miss is the DC 10, which was a McDonald Douglas. I thought that was a great plan, am I wrong?\n\n0:27:08 - Caller\n\nAnd the DC 10 had horrible problems at first. There was this is one of the examples is that the DC 10 was competing with the L 10 11. At the same time they were both coming out, they were both three engine jets and McDonald Douglas was building the DC 10 at the same time that Lockheed was building the L 10 11. And the word at the factory they wanted to get the DC 10 out so quickly and ahead of the L 10 11 that the rumor at the factory, what everybody was saying was fly before they roll, meaning that they wanted the DC 10 in the air and with the airlines before the L 10 11 even rolled out of the hang of the first time.\n\n0:27:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd they rushed it so quickly. Nobody flies DC 10s anymore. Like they hold that, you still see the 727s, but nobody's flying a DC 10 anymore.\n\n0:27:58 - Caller\n\nWell, the DC 10 is a very old aircraft and it was retired. The MD 11, I think FedEx is retiring them now. That was a derivation of it, also a TriStar, but they just don't need the three engines anymore. You can do the same thing with a bigger plane with just two engines. It's best with fuel. But the last aircraft that the real Boeing designed was a 787. And while there were some problems with that, they were technology problems based on the new battery technology that they resolved very, very quickly, right. But everything else since then the max etc and so on, were McDonald Douglas designs.\n\n0:28:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nI only know airplanes from the back seats and and I, so I don't have any other knowledge, but I know which ones I like to fly on and I love the Dreamliner.\n\n0:28:43 - Caller\n\nI really I'm the 787 and the A350, if you're going long distance, that's the plane you want to be on, because they can keep the cabin pressure at a lower altitude, a higher pressure, with more moisture in it, and you feel so much more refreshed so yeah, anytime you're flying overseas. If you can possibly get on one of those to definitely do that, I do. I think I wanted to go ahead Go ahead.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to tell you is that you are correct, is that it's not a technical thing, it's just a courtesy thing. If you're in the middle seat, you get both arms. Aha.\n\n0:29:16 - Caller\n\nThat's how it goes.\n\n0:29:17 - Caller\n\nIt's common courtesy, that's, it's well-known common courtesy among frequent flyers, but most of the little old ladies that are flying.\n\n0:29:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nSouthwest. She didn't know that, just don't know. And nor did Marshawn Lynch on my life. I was, I was. I told Mike I was flying like this. I just, you know, I use Flighty, which is a wonderful app, the best app in the, isn't it great, absolutely fabulous.\n\n0:29:40 - Caller\n\nIt's Ryan who designed that.\n\n0:29:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nUnbelievable and I use it because of you and Johnny Jett both both singing its praises and it's like 25 bucks a year but but if you fly it at all, it's really worth it. You often know before the gate knows whether you're going to be delayed. But I just got my Flighty passport and I don't know how it knew. But I have traveled 489,000 miles, almost half a million miles, 48 days, three hours in the air, 78 airports, 28 airlines I can't remember how many countries, 50 or 60 countries. So thank you, I didn't even know Flighty was keeping track of this 48 days.\n\nWell, let me give.\n\n0:30:20 - Caller\n\nFlighty. Just one more or maybe two more little plugs, because people don't realize how great it is. Yeah, it's $25 a year, but I think it's only $10 a month and you can subscribe for month to month. So if you're not a regular traveler, you can just get it when you're going and have it for that month and then stop the subscription.\n\n0:30:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nI just want to reward them because it's just such a great app. I just want to give them my money.\n\n0:30:42 - Caller\n\nIt's absolutely super and it's constantly being developed. And I can also tell you that I'm very, very fortunate in that I have friends that are dispatchers. So if I have somebody, if I'm flying someplace and there's an issue, I can get in touch with my friend and he can tell me well, this is delayed or that's delayed or whatever. And I had that happen maybe a year ago where there was some horrible weather up here in Portland and I had to get down to Charleston and the flight was delayed and delayed and delayed and I called my friend to see what was going on and he said oh no, no, it's going. And then I got the message from flighty that said, no, it wasn't then and it's. Later he texted me and said oh no, it isn't.\n\n0:31:22 - Leo Laporte\n\nI found out before he knew. Yep, it's amazing. It's only iOS, sad to say, but if you are using iPhone flighty and you fly a lot, there's no substitute. And it works on the Apple Watch too, so I was keeping track of everything on my Apple Watch. It was just really.\n\n0:31:38 - Caller\n\nAnd even if you're not flying, it works great with. If you have friends that are flying, you need to keep track of them. You can send your friends your flight itinerary. They can see what's going on. Yeah, I do that. I sure you up the airport yeah.\n\n0:31:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhen I'm on my way home, when I'm leaving in the plane, I share my itinerary. I don't, I didn't know there were 78 airports in the world, let alone 28 airlines. But I don't, and I also don't know how flighty knew this, because I've only been using them for a few years, but I guess they must have asked the airlines or something. Anyway, I was very, I was impressed with this. Thank you, main man Micah. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Great talking with you. Take care, bye, bye, I think of Trevor. What do you think?\n\n0:32:18 - John A.\n\nLet's do Trevor.\n\n0:32:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right, that's what I'm thinking. We're thinking, great minds thinking alike. Trevor's had his hand. Join us in the.\n\n0:32:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nStargate oh, I think Trevor might have accidentally hung up because Trevor was in the on-air room and now Trevor is gone. We lost Trevor.\n\n0:32:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nWho else should we? Should we talk? Should I should I? Should we do a voicemail? Let's do a voicemail. Or an email Voicemail time. Hi Leo and Micah. This is Charles in Chicago. Hi Charles.\n\n0:32:52 - Caller\n\nI have a question about carplay from Apple. Of course I use it religiously and every time I get in the car and plug my phone it tries to navigate me home automatically and drives me bananas. I don't need it to navigate me home, I know where home is. Could you tell me if there's a way to turn that quote feature off?\n\n0:33:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat quote feature.\n\n0:33:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's a great question. You know, I mistakenly favorited the hotel that we were staying at in Lisbon last spring and every time I get in the car it says do you want to go to Lisbon? And I say no, thank you very much. How do we? I got rid of that, by the way, by unfavoriting that hotel, so no longer asked if I want to go there. Yeah, how do we change this behavior?\n\n0:33:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's a little annoying, so because your home is listed as in in iOS land, is it a?\n\nfavorite. It's not that it's a favorite, it's that it's a frequent location. Buried deep within the settings, in your privacy settings, there is a section marked frequent locations, and it usually is your work in your home, and Apple, over time, realizes oh, this is the person's home, this is their work, and that's why it's doing that. If you turn off Siri suggestions for carplay, though, then you should no longer see this, but what that means is that you're turning off all Siri suggestions. So if, for example, you have a home kit garage door that whenever you get close to your home, it pops up on your thing, if that won't be there, if you have calendar events that are about to pop up, that won't be there. But if you just want to excuse me, remove your home as this thing that that iOS, and therefore Siri and therefore carplay, knows about, then you can do that in your settings.\n\n0:34:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm surprised that it starts the navigation each time, though. Have you ever experienced that? I've never experienced that.\n\n0:34:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo I think what our caller is actually talking about is it doesn't go as far as to start the navigation where it's talking to you, but what it will do is because I've had this happen a number of times it will show the route and it will show your plans along the route, so it's not actually navigating.\n\n0:35:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's just saying, in case you want to go there. Yeah, and if you tapped it, it would start navigating. Yes, exactly.\n\n0:35:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo I think that's a nice feature, right In a way. I almost feel like I hate to say it, but maybe just get over it. It's not really. I know, I know, but it's not really doing anything. It's just happening in the background. It's showing it. Yeah, it's just showing it. So if you can ignore it, then you know nothing is changing. But if it's just it's grinding your gears, then you can go into your settings, to the privacy settings, go into your locations and remove it from the house.\n\n0:35:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nI do have to say. Scooter X is posted a medium article. Stop Apple Maps on CarPlay from automatically navigating home. I wonder if some of them actually are starting the navigation.\n\n0:35:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, this is what I was talking about showing serious Okay.\n\nSo yeah, this is this was the also serious suggestions for CarPlay, right, yep, you open settings, you navigate to maps and then Siri and search and then toggle it off for maps, turn off the suggestions. Yeah, so that's good. This, this, that very specific thing, is a little bit newer where. It used to be that if you turned off serious suggestions for CarPlay it would turn off all of those automatically happening things. But now you can go into settings, you can tap on maps and then just turn them off for maps.\n\n0:36:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo it's not really navigating, it's just showing. It's just showing you. Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah, when the little round annoying if it said turn left right, it started talking.\n\n0:36:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut yes, I have never had it do that, it's only ever just shown my navigational route.\n\n0:36:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nI see you've pushed a button, john. Should I? Should we go to the wireless caller? Were you talking? You didn't push a button. I want to say hi to Wave 13. I'm picking up Wave 13. I'm picking up the waves, the miracle waves, because Wave 13., wave. Hey, can you hear us? Yeah, hi so. I was wondering.\n\n0:37:02 - Caller\n\nI have a new phone now, but a while ago in my phone it just like quit out, like it died, and then I just didn't turn on after I charged it Is there anything wrong with it.\n\n0:37:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt sounds like the screen went dark and you had to turn it on in order for it to work.\n\n0:37:25 - Caller\n\nLike it died and then like I tried to turn it on again and then didn't turn on it sounds like the battery might have gone.\n\n0:37:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt sounds also like what happened to Lisa when she did the update. Oh, it could be that. So when you charge it, it doesn't take a charge. By the way, what's your first name? I don't want to call you Wave 13, unless you want me to. Tyler, skyler, skyler or Tyler. Okay, well, bye.\n\nYou got to go to work. Okay, I think her mom. I think her mom was. You know, one of the reasons I had to pick her up is because she did what we keep trying to tell people. She was on her phone. I could see her on the camera swiping and stuff and I wanted to.\n\n0:38:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI thought oh, this is good, but maybe the rule was not to say your name and then so you had to get off. Oh, maybe, or maybe she to work, you know, I sound like they were going in the mall.\n\n0:38:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know. I just that's what I thought.\n\n0:38:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut yeah, there are then two options. You can do a force if you're still listening out there. You can do a force restart on your phone If it is the issue that Lisa had, or if you try to plug it in, it's not getting a charge. It might be that the battery has just gone bad.\n\n0:38:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey do sometimes, if it's an older phone, they only have a certain number of charges they can do. Yeah, well, thank you for calling. Anyway, it was worth a try, okay.\n\n0:38:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nTrevor is back now. We could try All right, oh good.\n\n0:38:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, let's see if we can get Trevor on Musta musta. You know, sometimes when we to say your name, you jump and you push the wrong button and hang up.\n\n0:39:02 - Caller\n\nAll right, trevor Yep, it is real, apart and the tech guys.\n\n0:39:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou don't remember Mike's name?\n\nIt's okay, don't get the guy a complex. He's gonna be, you know, I'm gonna be long gone. Mike is such a young guy. I'm gonna be long gone. He's gonna be hosting this show for years. So be nice to Micah, he's gonna be the tech guy by himself, Maybe. If you would just like to put a picture of me, I would love to Just a little, a little framed photo. Oh, your little people. We could have had those. Oh yeah, what happened to my little people? Does somebody eat my people? Oh, no, they're not candy. You got ahold of your people. What can we do for you, trevor?\n\n0:39:46 - Caller\n\nOh, my journey is still going for getting the Living with Disabilities podcast going oh it's this Trevor, hi Trevor, good to talk to you. Yeah, so I think about emailing you about a couple things, but then it's like you get too many emails.\n\n0:40:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nI can never answer emails. Yeah, that's. That's a yeah.\n\n0:40:06 - Caller\n\nBut basically I've looked, I went through looking for podcast posts and it's just all one solution. I don't want it. I spoke to the buzz Because I'm moving in a higher time.\n\n0:40:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe are now using Libsyn for some of our shows, and I'm a big fan. Libsyn started hosting. What's wrong with them?\n\n0:40:28 - Caller\n\n150 bucks a month. What they? Used to be free. Okay, my pictures that I have I'm posting 22 days a month, times three hours.\n\n0:40:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, that's why you pay for storage on Libsyn, not for bandwidth.\n\n0:40:48 - Caller\n\nI have a VPS. I get like four to eight cents a gigabyte.\n\n0:40:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, we talked about this before you could host it on your VPS.\n\n0:40:56 - Caller\n\nYeah, so the last two things I have to work out now is to do the how to do the RSS screen also make the site and then to go to all the providers and then boxing, going through pot tracker, did you?\n\n0:41:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nlook at anchor FM Spotify solution ever Spotify is terrible. Okay, I'll take your word for it.\n\n0:41:19 - Caller\n\nYeah, but now I'm now I'm into the stuff that's really thinking about. Like, how did the live show and I'm looking at I want to go get, look at Wirecast Pro and now they've gone to a subscription, only surprise, you can't buy it anymore. Yeah, yeah, I think you know it's funny because Libsyn when they first started.\n\n0:41:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey started roughly when we started in 2005 and they were free. But I know they no longer have a free plan that starts at $5 a month and I suspect that what's happened is bandwidth is not free and in the early days, you know, maybe everybody was trying to grow rather than make money, but eventually, trust me, you have to make money. So once they, once you know, once the blush wears off, it's time to start charging, and I think that it's yeah, I don't.\n\nI don't know if anybody does it for free, except for anchor FM and what is nice one of the nice things about anchor is that they will do your RSS for you. So in the early days of podcasting, let me, let me put on my old man hat. In the early days of podcasting we did it by hand.\n\nI was literally, because an RSS feed is an XML file. It's like HTML, it's a markup language and if you look, you can actually look at an RSS file. You can look at ours if you want. If you just open it in your browser, you could see all the text. It's just a formatted text and you can do it by hand. It's a pain, but you can't. For a long time there were a number of programs that would do it for you so you could enter, fill out forms and they'd write it, but honestly, it's too easy to make mistakes. It's too easy to make mistakes.\n\nAnd I think that's why I like anchor, and that's that's because they'll do everything for you. They'll make it possible for your show to be everywhere.\n\n0:43:12 - Caller\n\nBut for doing the video is the issue. Thing is well, they don't. I'm looking at what I'm looking at Wirecast Pro, because I need separate channels or anything I have like we call it the. I have my audio coming in, you know, before microphones.\n\n0:43:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love you, but this is you have such a specific issue and we've talked before and I don't really think we can, I can help you here, because it's just so specific and it's, I think, you're just going to have to figure this one out on your own. I'm sorry to say. I've told you some ideas. You know some things I think work, but that's yeah, there's almost a point.\n\n0:43:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthere's got to find some give in a way, and so there's the opportunity to, if you want to do, think about starting out, maybe you host your video part on YouTube and you do the audio part.\n\n0:44:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nActually, youtube might be a great place. They actually do some video as well as audio, only podcasts.\n\n0:44:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRight Now they've got, I think Google, of course, is bringing over podcasting to YouTube itself, so I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see even more from them. But yeah, perhaps exactly what you're looking for you're not going to find and you've got to make some compromises somewhere, and we've provided some different tools you can use to get what you want for the most part.\n\n0:44:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nBy the way, anchorfm is now called Spotify for podcasters, and I actually haven't tried the new features yet, so I don't know how it's changed. I'm not sure either. Yeah, I had a podcast. I still have a podcast on there called Leo on the line. It was my emergency escape hatch. If everything falls apart, I thought, well, I can always do that and I can just call people up.\n\n0:45:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a lie on the line. You remember.\n\n0:45:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nLeo, I'm on the line right now. Tell me something and I hang up and do another one like that. Hey, you know who's on the line, who's on the birthday boy. But before we say hello to Dickie D to celebrate his birthday, I want to tell you a little bit about sponsor Mylio. We love Mylio. Have you been playing with it? Of course, I put everything in Mylio now, yeah.\n\nSo I think a lot of us are looking for a way to organize all of our photos, to keep track of them, to sort them, to preserve them for future generations and preserve them for ourselves, and there have been, in the past, some great solutions. For a long time, I used to Picasso. I loved that. Then Google bought it and killed it. I used Lightroom with Adobe and then Adobe started wanting you to store your photos in their cloud, not going to do it. I've recommended Google Photos, but a lot of people don't want to store these precious photos on somebody else's servers. You got to find out about Mylio. Mylio is fantastic. Mylio is the smart way to organize your photos, to share your photos, to keep track of your photos. It's free, on a single platform, so you can try it, make sure it works for you and you don't have to store your photos in somebody else's cloud. Now Mylio has a cloud that you can store them in. You can also. Mylio has built-in encryption, so it's safe for you to use Mylio with Google Drive or iCloud or OneDrive or any, or Dropbox or anywhere else as a backup solution, because they're encrypted, no one can see them.\n\nMylio is the solution to digital management and I should really say it's called Mylio Photos. It's for photos and videos and even documents, and when you set it up, I set it up so it imports everything from Instagram, everything from Flickr, everything from Facebook, everything from iPhoto, everything from my documents folder. I love that, so I don't have to even think about it Mylio. Whenever I take a picture on a phone Android or iOS or I make a new document, it all gets into Mylio. Mylio has OCR optical character recognition built in, so it knows the text in a PDF file or a photo. You could search that way. It's got incredibly very sophisticated cataloging. For instance, it'll automatically on device by the way, it's not doing this in the cloud assign AI smart tags to your files. Dynamic search quick filters makes it possible to find specific photos very, very fast. You'll have to train it on people's faces, but what I did is I. I trained on a few faces and then it goes through all.\n\nI have 200,000 photos in Mylio. In fact, I wanted to get everything out of Google Cloud, out of Google Photos, so I did a takeout. Google Photos takeout Mylio ingests. It removes the duplicates. It even makes it easy for you to edit a photo either. In Mylio.\n\nThey have good photo editing tools, but you can also say edit this in and then substitute your editor right there. They just added a spaces tool, which is great for mom, because I can now put her in a space and she can see the photos I share with her, but she can't see the photos I don't share with her. You can create custom categories in a quick collection that's easy to share so you can share with other Mylio photos users. You can even collaborate on editing, managing. You can have, let's say, you've got a wedding or an event. You can have a Mylio space for that event that everybody can upload to. And again, yeah, you could do that in Google, but you're not giving the photos to Google Exactly. I love the option to keep spaces private, either with passwords or pins. I get extra security when sharing my spaces. I love Mylio photos.\n\nMylio photos. Try it free on one device and with a Mylio photos plus subscription, all your devices can connect in one library iOS, andrew, android, mac, windows. No cloud storage required. It's they sync peer to peer with offline storage. I don't need to rely on the cloud to keep files accessible through devices. I actually use my Synology NAS for the backup. I can also create new backup systems and know they're secure. Works great with your NAS. Or, as I said, encrypt and then put it on Dropbox.\n\nDownload Mylio today for free my L I O and see what's got us so excited. This is just to me, life changer.

Make that your master device, but it's up to you free mylio.com/twit. Thank you, Mylio. Thank you to Burke, who felt so guilty that during the last ad he brought me half a donut. Is that chocolate cake donut? He's taking care of me. That's what he's doing. Thank you, burke. I'm going to save that for my cup of coffee later.\n\nOh, a nice little dip. Yeah, I was in the land of Duncan and I didn't go to Duncan once. Really, yeah, honestly, that shows restraint. It was real restraint, because there's a Duncan on every quarter of the college. I mean not kidding, it's worse as Starbucks. There are dunkins everywhere, all over. Sometimes there's dunkins inside of dunkins. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, happy birthday, boy Dick DeBartolo. Happy birthday to you, thank you very much we dressed up for you, Dickie D.\n\n0:51:00 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, I can see that I would say. I said to Dennis why are they dressed like that? He said birthday glow. It's just, it's on for days.\n\n0:51:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt is. I'm glowed up, all glowed up, all glowed up for you, dickie D. For you, dickie D, happy birthday. Did you have a good what it was? Thursday?\n\n0:51:19 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nIt was Thursday. Yeah, dennis had his surprise party with about 500 people. No Two open bars, what? No, you're lying. And as he walked in I said oh my God. He said yeah, it's for you. And I said did they misprint the sign? Cause it says welcome to PEPCOM.\n\n0:51:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nAh, those sign painters. They messed up. It was for you the chocolate fountain and everything. Just for you and a number of other tech journalists.\n\n0:51:51 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nSo PEPCOM was on your birthday. That was nice of you, yeah, so that was a perfect way to celebrate it, cause I like gadgets and I like food, and they had both those things.\n\n0:52:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, they realized PEPCOM is used to be just along with CES, but now they do it all year round. And they realized the best way to get tech journalists to come and cover new products is to feed them. Yeah, and they feed them quite well actually. Yeah, they do.\n\n0:52:21 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nNo, absolutely. It's very funny. There was a toy event last year where there was food and when you went to the table it said the food is I'm sorry, but it's only for exhibitors.\n\n0:52:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, okay, no, sorry yeah.\n\n0:52:38 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThis year. I went to that event and I think there were maybe 20 of us. Yeah, that's why.\n\n0:52:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah yeah, it is a big part of press events. So you have brought us back virtually two fabulous gadgets.\n\n0:52:54 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, you know, I didn't know about either one. The first one is called Locks Box. I asked where the salmon was, but it happens.\n\n0:53:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nL-O-X-X.\n\n0:53:05 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nL-O-X-X Now I could use this, but of course in a city there's no room for it. So Locks Box goes on your porch or wherever you want. You screw it down so they can't just take the box. And the box is Wi-Fi, cell and Bluetooth enabled. And the guy said what's different about Lock Box? Because there are other systems out. There is you register each delivery service that you use, but with Lock Box they make it so the last four digit of your tracking number is all it needs. That's clever.\n\n0:53:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd of course the delivery guy has that.\n\n0:53:54 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nExactly and then it will phone you or, if you don't have a LTE service, it'll, through your home Wi-Fi, send you a text. It's very clever, yeah. And I said to the guy what if the guy comes and opens the box? The box stays open, unlocked for a minute and there's a package in there and he takes it. I said unlikely because of regular delivery service. He said well, we have the exact time that the box opened, we know exactly where the package came from and the service, of course, will know who the driver was for that. So I said it's highly unlikely that someone's gonna take your package. This is. I mean, they know that we can track it.\n\n0:54:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe have all our packages delivered to our porch and it's safe because we're on a dead end and we're in a safe neighborhood.\n\n0:54:46 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nBut if you, you have all your packages delivered Right to the porch.\n\n0:54:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah for him.\n\n0:54:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHe's saying it's okay. Just the other day, right down the street from where I live because I got a notification on the like community app, I was flabbergasted. This I felt kind looking older woman who had her dog with her walks up with absolute utter no concern at all. Walks up to this person's porch. Sees this big it was a big package on this person's porch.\n\n0:55:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe porch must have had a camera. Yes, they had a camera.\n\n0:55:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nExactly so they were able to share this and with I kid you not, I will just say a grin. There's perhaps some words I wanna use before that, a certain kind of grin on her face proceeds to pick up this very large package, while she puts down the leash from her dog and hoist it and carry it away with the dog trotting behind her. And I thought, if I ever saw this person, I would never believe that they would ever steal a small package, let alone a gigantic package.\n\n0:55:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's been porch piracies become a big problem. Yeah, a lot of people.\n\n0:55:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah.\n\n0:55:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo this actually really looks like a good product. I think they've solved all the issues.\n\n0:56:03 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nSo there's a four cubic foot one, I think is 399. And then there's an eight cubic foot one which is $449, $50 more.\n\n0:56:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, so this is only for somebody who really has been losing packages in his like turn of the era?\n\n0:56:20 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, exactly, and they have, I think, a $2 subscription for a month you have to pay for it, cause they would have to contact the APIs for the shipping places and all that kind of stuff. So ongoing web services, Exactly. The other thing was bizarre. It turned out that this company has been around for 20 years, but the woman said they only built electric saws big installations for corporations.\n\n0:56:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh great, you're recommending a table. Saw, we're gonna have a bunch of four-fingered listeners here. No, not in this case. What?\n\n0:56:57 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nNo, not no. They have a little one minute video. I also put the link to it on my website. That shows you how it works, and I was hoping oh, you can hear this, if we want.\n\n0:57:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right, let me turn on the audio. Yeah, yeah, oh, you know what? My audio is not going to the right spot.\n\n0:57:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nPlease tell me they do the hot dog finger thing oh.\n\n0:57:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nGod, yes, what's the hot dog finger thing?\n\n0:57:22 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nExactly because the saw is running at 4,000 RPM. Yes. There's a little bit of electricity in the blade and when it senses like skin, in five milliseconds a break, which is this big aluminum block comes up and stops the saw dead in five minutes Before it got here and I'm not gonna test it Now, when that happened.\n\n0:57:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nHa, ha ha. What the Look at that.\n\n0:57:55 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nSo you will probably have a small nick, but you'll have a finger. And also it lowers the saw under the table Once the break hits, it also lowers it and shuts the motor off.\n\n0:58:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow, Now that.\n\n0:58:11 - Caller\n\nIt looks like it breaks the break. Oh, here comes the hot dog here you go, here you go. Yeah, this is so that they don't test it themselves.\n\n0:58:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey're like look, it works, but we're not gonna use our actual fingers. You know, I have to tell you no, no.\n\n0:58:22 - Leo Laporte\n\nAfter years on the screensavers and our producer, paul Block, who really liked a stunt, I could tell you it's a good thing this didn't come out when we were doing the screensavers, because he would have made me do it. Oh no, with my finger. Oh, what are you kidding me? He would do anything for ratings. We, we, we. Maybe you don't remember. Remember, yoshi, we had a guy. Come on with a taster.\n\n0:58:42 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nNo fingers, Yoshi, wasn't it Well?\n\n0:58:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nyes, but he tased. He said Yoshi got tased on the show because it's like it's spectacle, it's good TV. And I could guarantee you Paul would have seen this and go oh yeah, you're gonna do it too, Leo. No way, Yikes.\n\n0:59:02 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, no, you know what? I was on Good Morning America covering it for the Miami Boat Show, and the guy had a canoe with a giant motor in the back and wings that flipped out so that you could row and then take off and fly. And the guy the director said so, Dick, we want this as your exit, Okay you'll. You'll fly out Sure, and I'm thinking is he crazy?\n\n0:59:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nTV baby.\n\n0:59:38 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nAnd fortunately the sound man said are you crazy? You won't hear a thing. Can you hear that motor?\n\n0:59:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHe can't hear it and I said Saved by the sound, yes, and also they invented headset deck.\n\n0:59:53 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nBe aware, if the wind is more than three miles an hour, you'll be going where the wind goes, not where you want it to go.\n\n1:00:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nWait, remember seeing that. I'm trying to see if I can find it the morning show, morning TV show where the reporter had on one of those jet packs that you fly with with water, oh yeah, or in the water. Remember that. Let me see if I can find it. Well, it didn't go well. That's what happened.\n\n1:00:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMy favorite news while he's looking, my favorite news reporter one is when a woman is going to a place that makes wine and they are actually mashing the grapes.\n\n1:00:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh yeah, I remember this one, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:00:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd she decides to cheat by having the other person stop while she quickly smashes the grapes and then unfortunately falls out of the grape smashing area and it cuts back. It got worse and worse. Yeah, it was bad. And then she screamed yeah, she makes some sounds and they're like oh, no, this is from channel 69, I don't know where this is.\n\n1:00:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nFox News. Here we go. Good morning everybody. Oh, that's the temperature. Oh, at a point. Show the morning news starts. Look over there. And it starts right now, oops.\n\n1:01:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt starts right now. That could have been me.\n\n1:01:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nI could just see you, and that's myself. Wow, well, I'm glad that somebody's had the good sense. But that's TV for you, Dick. Anyway, this song. So what's the name of this? The saw thing. Oh Saw. Stop S-A-W-S-T-O-P. And boy, if you're using a table saw, you probably should have this. Do you have to buy their table saw, or is it? You know what?\n\n1:01:44 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThe woman said actually Chad said that his father had worked as a shop teacher and the school bought one of these and originally you could attach it to a regular saw, but I think that's not available anymore, so I probably tried to start out. Maybe they couldn't control how well you installed it.\n\n1:02:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that could be. Oh yeah, that's a good point, but you know what, for 900 bucks it's not a terribly expensive table saw. And just having that, how much are your fingers?\n\n1:02:13 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nAnd it's also very feature-laden. I don't use power tools, but it has a rack and pinion fence and the high-low shelf things that I'd use.\n\n1:02:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh yes, the high-low shelf.\n\n1:02:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know any of that stuff, yeah.\n\n1:02:28 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nAll I know is it cuts wood. I'll ask Paris Martin no and not fingers.\n\n1:02:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nShe's taken a woodworking class, so she might know something about this. I'll ask her about it on this week. Oh, that's good. Yeah, she's. By the way, I can announce it here yes, our new host, stacey Higginbotham, left us on this week in Google. She actually left all podcasting to go to work as a policy person at Consumer Reports. We're very proud of Stacey, but it left a pretty big hole on this week in Google and we've been searching and we found, I think, a great replacement. She can't, nobody will ever replace Stacey, but she's gonna be great in her own right part. Paris Martin no, from the information, is gonna be our third me, Jeff Jarvis, aunt Pruitt and now Paris Martin no, joining us on this week in Google. Great, and she's a woodworker. Well, I don't know if she's a woodworker. She told us she was taking a class, so I'll ask if they have the. If the saw, stop and if not, stand back. Stand back. Thank you, dickie D. Happy birthday.\n\n1:03:29 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nOh, you know what. This is in the mail to you. Unfortunately, it didn't get here in time for the show. The cover is so good oh we should.\n\n1:03:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe cover is great, dick's website is gizwizbiz and of course you're gonna go there to find links to the two products you just mentioned. But you, after you do that, you're gonna go to the what the heck is it? Contest. It ends soon. It ends, just a couple of about a week In the October.\n\n1:03:53 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, halloween, you're playing for this Bobby issue.\n\n1:03:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe Bobby issue. It looks like Barbie to me, but okay, whatever you say. I'm just teasing. Look at that. There's Alfred E Newman as Ken. That's great. He's a perfect Ken.\n\n1:04:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd that that item is clearly the what the heck is it A peppermint disc holder? Oh yes, it's holding a peppermint. Good, good, good oh my God, it's.\n\n1:04:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou gave it away.\n\n1:04:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThe peppermint's right in there.\n\n1:04:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nEither that or it's a peppermint porthole Could be on your peppermint Barbie shop.\n\n1:04:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\n1:04:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nOr it's a hypnosis, a hypnotist's monocle oh yeah, look into my eyes I did.\n\n1:04:38 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThat could be because I bought 500 of them. Oh no, they got you. Yeah, the guy said you want to buy one of these, and then a box Is that a big hint?\n\n1:04:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nDid you just give us a big hint? There are 18 autograph copies of Mad Magazine. Up to six for the right answer, up to 12 for the best wrong answer. Judges decisions are final and you'll win the Mad Magazine with Barbies dud date, alfred on the cover. Is this clearance sticker actually part of the cover?\n\n1:05:07 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nNo, I love that. I emailed Susie, who puts the the cover's original for this issue. The insides are reprinted, but I love that. That clearance sticker, Because Mad is $5.99, but that's it just makes it seem so funny. Oh, that's so clever.\n\n1:05:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's nice they're doing new covers, I mean, and I like that. You know, honestly, Mad Magazine, the older stuff is the best stuff anyway.\n\n1:05:35 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nAnd new Foldins.\n\n1:05:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd new Foldins. What are you, what is your article in this?\n\n1:05:41 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nLet's see the Teen Rage knit with teenage knit with mutant turtle.\n\n1:05:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, that never gets old. They just got a new movie came, just came out.\n\n1:05:51 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, exactly. So the timing's good People. If you don't watch the movie too carefully, you could think my satire is the new movie.\n\n1:05:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nGizWizbiz is Dick's website. His podcast, gizwiztv with OMG. Chad Dick, happy, happy birthday.\n\n1:06:09 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThank you guys, I'll see you in a month. All right, thank you, dickie, take care birthday and I'll see you at the GizFiz. We love the Giz. Good thing you, micah.\n\n1:06:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, yeah right after this we can Google. Every Wednesday we do the GizFiz for club members. If you're not a club member, you should be. You really that's. Do it for Dick, don't do it for me, do it for Dick. $7 a month gets you ad, free versions of all the shows, gets you the Discord channel where you can chat and it gets you special shows just for the club. Like this guy here, dick DeBartoloz, gizfiz, if you want to see the Giz, I would say seven bucks a month's worth it just for that. You just go right, go to club, join club Twitter twittv, slash club twit. Thank you so much, dickie D. Thank you, not trooper.\n\n1:06:58 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nOkay, guys, thanks so much. Bye, bye, bye, bye.\n\n1:07:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAll righty Is she break time or is it time for phone call?\n\n1:07:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's fantastic Is the wireless caller I'm gonna pick up Home.\n\n1:07:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nFrank Kim. That's not a right name, but I'm gonna pick up that person. You gonna pick it up or should I?\n\n1:07:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's been picked up. It's been picked up.\n\n1:07:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's been picked up. And now Star six, if you have not.\n\n1:07:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nHello Kim or Frank. Which is it? I'm guessing it's Frank.\n\n1:07:34 - Caller\n\nHello. Hey, Frank where you calling from. Hey, I'm asking again. I'm sorry, I was just learning how to unmute. Where are you calling from today? I'm calling from Nebraska, all right.\n\n1:07:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWelcome to the show.\n\n1:07:48 - Caller\n\nThe corn husk is still. I have an issue. You got it. You got it. I've been listening to you for a lot of years. I'm about the same age as you are, so I'm not near as tech savvy, so you gotta bear with me here. Longest drive I ever took was route 80 through Nebraska.\n\n1:08:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat just. There's a lot of corn in Nebraska. I never ended. It was a long trip.\n\n1:08:09 - Caller\n\nYeah, but if you get off I-80, there's a whole lot of other countries you could see and you wouldn't know you're in the same state, I bet yeah, all right, I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n1:08:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat's your question?\n\n1:08:19 - Caller\n\nOh no, no problem. Hey, I enjoy the BS. I just don't want to take up your important time here.\n\nI have an issue hey we have a show title, I will get you to say it. Oh yeah, you do. There you go. No BS right. Yeah, okay, I've got a problem I'm sure you've never, I'm sure you've never had before and I wish I knew and had a solution for it. I have a Phillips DVR. You know, I live out in the country so I get over the air so I record that way. You know it's got a hard drive in it and it's probably 12, 14 years old. The issue I have with it is the remote control. I have to put it in the refrigerator to get it to work. What I told you it was unique.\n\n1:09:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love this.\n\n1:09:05 - Caller\n\nLet me ask does it have replaceable? It's a little too to work when it's cold and not warm.\n\n1:09:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's interesting. The batteries normally does it have replaceable batteries in it?\n\n1:09:15 - Caller\n\nIt does have replaced the batteries. I've done everything under the sun and it's getting worse as it gets older. I first discovered it by accident. Thank, you.\n\n1:09:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI needed to know this. How did you know to do this?\n\n1:09:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's what I needed to know, Well let me just put this in the freezer.\n\n1:09:30 - Caller\n\nYeah, well, I do that now. I hope this isn't a too sensitive conversation. Since I live in the country, I can go outside to do certain things. Well, once I was struggling with it and couldn't get to work, I put it in my pocket and went outside.\n\n1:09:44 - Caller\n\nAnd it worked when you came back, because it was winter.\n\n1:09:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow.\n\n1:09:48 - Caller\n\nExactly, exactly. So I started experimenting, but I have to say that's very. I actually put it in the refrigerator and it worked Very astute of you to say While it would work when it was cooler Just cooler weather here in the house, but now it's getting to be it's refrigerator. When I pull it out of the refrigerator or the freezer, it works instantly. It works great for a couple of minutes until it warms up enough, and then it absolutely the remote absolutely will not work.\n\n1:10:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo there are some cases where stuff won't work unless it gets warm. We call that a cold solder, where there's a solder joint that wasn't properly done. But when it gets hot really, I mean really hot and kind of remelts it, it works, it makes the connection. But cold, that's an interesting one. Sounds like a busted cap. I'm gonna say it's a capacitor, right.\n\n1:10:38 - Caller\n\nYeah, so it's like leaking probably, and then when you cool it, it's probably hardening again.\n\n1:10:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, so, and this is not uncommon- you guys were my last resort.\n\n1:10:47 - Caller\n\nI spent hours on the internet and everything else and can't find an answer.\n\n1:10:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf you search for bad capacitor, you'll see there were a lot. There was a period of time when there were a lot of motherboards and other devices with poorly manufactured capacitors and they'd start to leak or they'd fail. Now, let me think about this. He probably I mean you're not gonna be able to open up the remote. By the way, that was Benito. We missed you, Benito. Yeah, thank you, We'll get him back. Thank you, he's the busted cap guy. So, no, you probably can't desolder that cap and replace it, though. Right, that's the problem.\n\n1:11:26 - Caller\n\nI mean that's Well, could you? Probably not. I have not. I can take the remote apart. Here's what I would do.\n\n1:11:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nI take the cover off of him. Get on eBay. In fact, it looks like scooter X has already found your replacement on eBay, wow.\n\n1:11:39 - Caller\n\nEven this, this old machine, huh.\n\n1:11:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, this is $175 for the whole thing, but I wonder if you could just find the remote by itself. Yeah, it's probably a bad capacitor on the remote and when it's chilled it works again.\n\n1:11:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBecause isn't it the difference of the metal expanding or contracting based on the temperature right?\n\n1:12:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, well, the way capacitors work. They have liquids inside it. What a capacitor does is it holds, it stores electricity. It's like a little battery in a way, right, oh?\n\n1:12:12 - Caller\n\nsure.\n\n1:12:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, another good idea. Another good idea is to get a programmable remote and replace that old one by programming the functions into a programmable remote. So you put the remote in the freezer and then let it chill down and get the new one ready and there's a button that says program it and take it out of the freezer and press the start. You know the power on button program that you could power all the buttons. Get my button gear.\n\nYeah, I think you need to replace the remote. In other words, once a capacitor goes bad, it's only gonna get worse. In fact, it is right, you have to chill it more each time, right?\n\n1:12:54 - Caller\n\nIt is, it is, and I probably should just replace it. But you know what this is getting hard to find for us. You know, us old people live out in the country and just have TV antennas, decent DVRs where, yeah, yeah, nobody makes them for over the air.\n\n1:13:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere are still some OTA DVRs from other companies that are new. If that Phillips dies on you, a Channel Master, makes them really excellent DVRs for over the air, specifically for this. I think they may be one of the last companies that are still doing that Channel Master.\n\n1:13:27 - Caller\n\nYep, no, there's not too many, or some of them. They're just a little teeny tiny box that look kinda like a road or something. Yeah, that's like this, I'm not sure how that?\n\n1:13:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's the Silicon Dust HD Home Run. Yeah, and it records on. Yeah, that's kind of an interesting one, because you can use that to one box to connect to your antenna and then it puts it out over your network, your internet, your LAN, so you can see watch TV everywhere in the house on that one connection to the internet. That's from Silicon Dust, the HD Home Run In between 1999 and 2007, which is exactly, by the way, when you bought that Phillips DVR, I'm gonna guess there was a in fact.\n\n1:14:02 - Caller\n\nYou're right.\n\n1:14:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm sure it's probably that old yeah, Time goes by faster the older we get, as you know, wikipedia has an article called capacitor plague higher than expected failure rate of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors between 1999 and 2007, due to faulty electrolyte composition that caused corrosion. So a lot this happened to a lot of motherboards Ultimately could cause a fire. I think you don't have to worry about it because your battery powered so you're not putting a lot of voltage through that thing, right, but I think Benito's got. I think Benito nailed this one.\n\n1:14:44 - Caller\n\nI think you're right. It makes sense because of all the other things I've tried to think and tried to research. That does make sense and I guess my first instinct on that was usually things when they expand, you get from heat, you get one, but if they're liquid in the cooling, you know, create a problem or corrosion, like you said.\n\n1:15:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nHere the seven symptoms of a bad capacitor Problems. Turning on this is from upgradedhomecom A burning smell from your unit that would be more like an AC. Random shutoffs, delayed AC actions, no cold air. This is all for an air conditioner Higher energy bills, no voltage. But of course in a remote control you'd get some of the same intermittent symptoms, and cooling it down might make that capacitor work for a little while, but in the long run I think you're gonna have to get a universal remote and replace it, and that's what I'm gonna do, by the way.\n\n1:15:46 - Caller\n\nThat's the best, because the DVR works great.\n\n1:15:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nyet here's an answer from chatGPT. Wow, um, user5205 asked chat. Maybe I should ask chatGPT. That's interesting. What did you? Why is I seem to have a problem here? What did you ask your chatGPT? I wonder what the problem is. Let me try it. My remote control stops working, but when I bring it outside to the cold air it starts working again. Why? Let's see what. Let's see what, chatgpt asks Interesting observation.\n\n1:16:37 - Caller\n\nThere could be a few reasons why your remote control behaves this way.\n\n1:16:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nOops, I turned it down. Yes, she thought a battery too. Oh, crumb, this wants to do an SOS call. Nevermind, I'll read what user5205 came up with. Some remote controls have a this is another solution, by the way, rubber or silicone button membranes beneath the buttons. These membranes can degrade or become less responsive over time. Cooling the remote can temporarily improve the electrical conductivity of the materials and make the buttons work more reflectively. So maybe that's it Now. Remember, chatGPT is just making stuff up Right. So who knows? But actually that kind of makes sense.\n\n1:17:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIn a way, you could wonder yeah, perhaps the silicone, the contact on the back of the silicone, that needs to touch the contact on the chip itself, something there has degraded. And then that's the part where it's just kind of like hand wavy and because of cold, then the connections will be better.\n\n1:17:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, maybe yeah, or maybe yeah, maybe yeah. I don't know Exactly, I don't know, I don't know, and I guess I probably should have.\n\n1:17:44 - Caller\n\nThe very first thing I did before I found out it was cold was to take because it's easy to take apart four screws, because I was. My first thought was those connections on that silicone pad were bad, but it didn't make any difference.\n\n1:17:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, oh well, that's good to know then yeah, no, so it's gotta be the capacitor.\n\n1:18:02 - Caller\n\nI'm really comfortable.\n\n1:18:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm liking that answer and then you're not gonna be able to really fix that, because it's a little circuit board in there and you're not gonna desolder the capacitor in place. Although you could, it might be a flat spot.\n\n1:18:11 - Caller\n\nEvery time I touch one of them, it's a disaster anyway.\n\n1:18:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut you could just get a universal remote and program it while that thing is still working.\n\n1:18:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, before it goes all the way, yeah, and you have to I don't know send it to space to get it to work. Hey thanks for the call.\n\n1:18:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI appreciate it. Has winter come to Nebraska yet, or?\n\n1:18:36 - Caller\n\nNope, not yet. We've had a couple freezers, but we've also been close to 90s the last few days, so it's kind of one of those up and down it's crazy.\n\n1:18:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's crazy. Frank, a real pleasure, thanks for calling us and a great question. I love that it was a fun question, I love that, and he gave us a show title. Yes, indeed, take care, frank.

I've been having so much fun. She was listening to that whole ad, my favorite.\n\nOh my goodness, I wonder what she thinks.\n\n1:23:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWell it processes. My favorite new feature is that chat GPT can take your prompts for Dolly and then turn them into something that will make the best prompt for Dolly.\n\n1:23:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo you can, you can customize your graphics prompt. Oh, she's still listening. Let's see what she. She's what, what is she Interesting?\n\n1:23:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou're saying she Well, listen to her. Well, because, yeah, I mean as opposed to it.\n\n1:23:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, listen to her. She sounds just like Scarlett Johansson. You wouldn't call. Sorry, I'm having issues.\n\n1:24:02 - Caller\n\nRight now. Our systems are experiencing heavy load. Please try again later.\n\n1:24:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nPlus, you just sent me seven minutes and 10 seconds of nonsense. Did you see that article she? Did say investing in a universal remote is a practical solution.\n\n1:24:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere you go. Yeah, she got that from us, though it's see, now you've got me saying she, it got that from us, though probably from listening to us say yeah.\n\n1:24:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nShe's. She's got the whole conversation with Frank on here. Wow, I love this, though, because you're right, I know it's a machine, yeah, and it's not even a very bright machine, it's, it's it sounds like. Scarlett Johansson.\n\n1:24:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's pretty cool. Mine's a guy, I've got mine.\n\n1:24:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou like it you want to have a guy. Yeah, she sounds like a depressed Scarlett Johansson. Yeah.\n\n1:24:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nA little low, low. What is that? Low energy, yeah, but there's another low adrenaline, low adrenaline, do you?\n\n1:24:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nsuffer from low adrenaline.\n\n1:25:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJust taking a while.\n\n1:25:02 - Caller\n\nI'm just a digital assistant, so I don't have emotions, feelings or physiological responses like adrenaline. However, I can provide information on adrenaline and it's effective.\n\n1:25:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nSee this is the problem I have with it it's gassy, it keeps on going. Yeah, they should stop at that first sentence. It does, but then it goes off for another eight paragraphs about adrenaline. I didn't ask it about adrenaline, I'm asking about her. Anyway. It it her, just like the movie. All right, moving on, who should we talk to next?\n\n1:25:33 - Caller\n\nUh, let's go with J Ohio G.\n\n1:25:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nJ in the G, j to the G in the Ohio of the G of the J of the Ohio, j Ohio, g, ohio, did. Am I supposed to do something? No, no, no, I got it. J to the G to the Ohio, ohio, hello, hey, j.\n\n1:26:18 - Caller\n\nHey, how's it going? It's good. How are you? Doing pretty good, Doing pretty good Um where are you going?\n\n1:26:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nHi, yeah, thank you, poor Micah, so often left out.\n\n1:26:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, I was going to say I really like your voice.\n\n1:26:34 - Caller\n\nJ, oh, thank you. Um, oh, sorry, I'm actually right now outside of us. Cincinnati Ohio, nice, oh, northeast I love, since he, um, yeah, yeah, I'm actually kind of interested in checking out the chili I've. I was born in Ohio but I've never been able to really enjoy some of these other. You've never had Cincinnati chili, no no, wow, it's not very good.\n\n1:27:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's. They put cinnamon in it. It's not my, it's a little. It's different if you're used to regular normal chili and then you can get it one way, two way, three ways, whether it's got beans and onions and spaghetti and spaghetti and the chili. That's five way yeah.\n\n1:27:14 - Caller\n\nI've heard. I've heard, I'm, I'm. I'm not saying I'm not going to turn it down, but you know I am interested in trying new foods. That's why I love traveling. But I don't know if the spaghetti is really my cup of tea, but I'm going to have to try it.\n\n1:27:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou got to go to skyline, get the skyline chili. Three, four or five way. There it is, it's good, it's just it's not like other chili in the rest of the world. It's just not like other. It's a little cinnamony, it's interesting. Anyway, I, I, you know what, let's all go, let's go out and and have some. What can we do for you, jay, okay, for you. I was a little bit skeptical about it but I, I enjoyed it.\n\n1:27:50 - Caller\n\nI felt it when we opened our doors, didn't see that Well. Well, first I do have a kind of a response. You like you and, oh Actually, great title, I can't wait to see it on the podcast. But, micah, you had a message that came in against of the email of a person who wanted to take pictures with her phone and have it automatically documented with the time and date on the photo itself.\n\n1:28:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that.\n\n1:28:20 - Caller\n\nYeah, that was sometimes back, but I heard it when I was on vacation. On my flight home From my cruise, I realized I do have an app just like that. Oh, it's called open cam. Open cam, oh yes, and there's an option in the settings photo settings saying you know, timestamp photo.\n\n1:28:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nInteresting, so you use that instead as your camera. Is this it. Mark Harman open camera. Is this it.\n\n1:28:47 - Caller\n\nYes, mark army.\n\n1:28:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, so and it and so that's a setting. That's actually a great solution and it's been updated. It was updated in August of this year, so it's that yeah, fairly recent, and I can see you could even see right here the, the timestamp that it's put on there. That's, that's cool, awesome, thank you for this. What a good solution. Where did you go on your cruise?\n\n1:29:09 - Caller\n\nPart of a Mardi Gras to Actually, you know it. I need my wife here for this, because all I know is I had great fun, lots of food and, oh, puerto Rico was a first stop.\n\n1:29:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, I love that. Oh, so it was a Caribbean, was Western Caribbean.\n\n1:29:23 - Caller\n\nYes, just Puerto Rico. And what Grand Turk and another stop, yes, fun.\n\n1:29:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, isn't that fun.\n\n1:29:30 - Caller\n\nYou know, I do have one of the question though. Yes, you got me interested when you're talking about the my little Leo program. Yes, and you know I love photography. It's kind of my you know passion project. But I also love to keep the raw files and I've always had problems with one kind of like an online data manager or, you know, basically backup service that will do the raw files at a reasonable cost. But also, I was interested Is there anything under Linux that is like Mylio, or is there? Yeah, Mylio. Onto boom to.\n\n1:30:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nI've talked to Mylio. I said guys, you got to make a Linux version for me and and JG over here, so you're primarily Linux, yes, yeah. No, yeah, they don't currently have a Linux version and so that is an issue. Of course, you can keep it on your phone. I'm sure you have iOS or an Android as a phone and it works on both of those. What would I use? This is the problem.\n\nWhen Picasso went away, there really weren't any great. We call this a category dam. Digital asset management, damn, damn. And all Photographers need a system, a damn system, because that, you know, there's got to. You have a lot of photos and, among other things, you want to pick the ones that are the best, Prioritize those. You want to be able to scan through them. If you do a wedding, you want to be able to scan through all the shots and go that one is a three star, that's a five star, quickly and easily, and then you want to be able to edit them, and a Good digital asset management solution will do all that. By the way, I don't even so many features of Mylio. They have a great ranking system that is fast and easy. You know, one click so that you are one tap of the button so you can really do that. That's a great dark room. Maybe, I don't know, on on, I don't know if a good damn for Linux actually. Yeah.\n\n1:31:34 - Caller\n\nI know I've looked at. I think it's dark tail, what?\n\n1:31:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou're referring to.\n\n1:31:36 - Caller\n\nYes, I'm sorry, yes, yeah, I live at dark table and to me it seems so powerful for photo editing. I never really got a chance to really do it for management because I'll just do folders and Lay with a folder and then inside of folders, of course, either the time and date or the location that I was taking pictures at, whether it's California or New York or or Texas and maybe something for Thanksgiving with you know all the photos from there.\n\n1:32:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou see here that this shot of the interface where you can give it stars, it does, and you can categorize them. It is, it is. I think they're trying to make a lightroom clone, basically.\n\n1:32:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it was actually suggesting that you could use lightroom on the web.\n\n1:32:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, no, no, don't go with that, let's not go crazy. It's not being saying. I think dark table is probably the tool I would recommend is the one I've used for years. Yeah, there's a dark room on a Mac. I always confuse, confuse it to. But dark table is very mature. It's an active development. They've done a great job. It does raw and, depending on whose raws you're using it, it does a very good job of interpreting it. I've always been impressed by dark table, which, by the way, is available, I think, on Mac and Windows as well. It's a really interesting. They say it's a workflow application and raw developer, so maybe it isn't tuned to be a digital asset management Tool. I think maybe you're right. Folders and all of that might be the way you end up doing it. I wish there were. I really wish there was something. There were a milio on Linux, because that's that's the way to do it. There's sponsor we should mention. Okay, so I don't other than that, other than the dark table, I don't have any other recommendations. That's the one, okay.\n\n1:33:26 - Caller\n\nWell, look, I appreciate it. Thank you for giving my 15 seconds of a fame, and y'all take care.\n\n1:33:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nThank you for calling back. I love talking to you. Where are you going next? Where are you going next? Oh, um.\n\n1:33:39 - Caller\n\nI'm a truck driver, so I'm I'm gonna delivery just around the corner from here and I'm gonna probably go back to North Carolina.\n\n1:33:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nNice, all right. And then in your travels, do you have a plan? You know, because when you get off a cruise, there's nothing more depressing like vacations over. I need where, where's. Where's my next meal gonna come from? I'm gonna have to make it so. So I always plan my next trip before the. So I know I have something to look forward to, have you planned your next trip yet.\n\n1:34:08 - Caller\n\nYeah, um, what I do? I'm a, I'm a glass hauler, so I pretty much have a dedicated route almost. But a lot of places I've been to I've been to before, so I know where to stop, I know where to park, I know you know when they're going to uh, unload me, so that's why you haven't had season out of chili, you don't have time.\n\n1:34:25 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou gotta get to the next place, so what?\n\n1:34:27 - Leo Laporte\n\ndo you say glass? What do you mean? Glass like pains of glass?\n\n1:34:31 - Caller\n\nBasically, yeah, what I carry is I wish I had my trailer with me, but I'm going to the gym Today. I have a free day today, nice. But what I carry is from the manufacturer to the people who will cut it down, make windows and doors Um and mirrors out of how?\n\n1:34:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nwhat an interesting specialty.\n\n1:34:48 - Caller\n\nYeah, because you have to drive really careful. Yeah, yeah, well, careful than not. Yes, yeah, that's very cool.\n\n1:34:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nOf course Of course you talk to say Somebody tells me to haul glass, I'll think of you. Jg, thank you.\n\n1:35:06 - Caller\n\nWhat I will say is you know you talked to Samuel Sammon I know I listened to him because of you and he talks about potholes in in michigan. Glass can't handle the potholes if you do it right. So you know it takes a little bit of a Skill if you will.\n\n1:35:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's terrifying. I know I'd be like yeah, oh no, you're making me go through.\n\n1:35:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nHave you ever lost a load?\n\n1:35:26 - Mikah Sargent\n\nof glass. That is a good question.\n\n1:35:28 - Caller\n\nNot a full load, but I've had to dump off a few pieces.\n\n1:35:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, Can you hear it when it when it's going? Can you hear smashing glass in the back?\n\n1:35:36 - Caller\n\nYes, yes, just like you probably heard in all the cartoons and movies, you know what glass sounds like and whether it's a crack or it's a whole load up at all. Yeah, yeah, you're going to turn heads and kind of worry, it's not on you.\n\n1:35:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, just I can imagine my face, just to be like oh, that happens how much fun to talk to you, jg Thank you for calling.\n\n1:35:56 - Caller\n\nI appreciate it, thank you. All right, take it easy, guys. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.\n\n1:36:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut he said he I wonder if his business card says I haul glass, it should, it should, it's good, good Should. Um, I'm gonna do this. My rotator cuff is. I was about to say you need to kind of stretch that rotator cuff a little bit out.\n\nYeah there you go Good form, good form seven seven ten you ever do that You're on a date Only as a joke. I remember in the old days when I was a young man, that was the way. That was the way. All right, let's see iphone 15 pro max camera assessment. This is mike from orlando, florida. Hello, mike, I would like an assessment of the camera, the lenses and the quality of the images. I've watched many videos from what I consider reputable photographers. Some like it a lot, some think it's garbage. Okay, what do you think? Compared to past iphone cameras, I'm very happy with the iphone. I have a 15 pro max, as you do too, and I think it's gorgeous. Now I just got also the, the pixel 8 pro, which is google's latest, and I would say and dx o mark might agree that maybe the pixel 8 is a little bit better.\n\n1:37:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut neither with google's computational photography Is as well like and I think you nailed it.\n\n1:37:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's why some photographers don't like these.\n\n1:37:27 - Mikah Sargent\n\nExplain what that is so computational photography is this idea that we take what is actually there and then we augment it, we, we make it look better, we make slight adjustments to it, we make changes to it that are Blanketed under this term. Ai, right, and it is In. I think for the average person, it is a thing that you see and you go. I love this because it's trying to make a photograph for you. That, in general ways, is a very pleasing photo. But a photographer, a person who is looking with their eyes and is trying to capture something exactly as it is, who takes a photograph and has the computational photography magic happen, they see a photo that is not what they expect. They see a photo that has been taken and made in a, in effect, fake, because it has these, these additional changes made to it, and I think that's the difference at the heart of what apple is doing and what google is doing, and honestly, on the google side, I think it ends up being a Thing that pleases more consumers. Yeah.\n\n1:38:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, and I think the the week. Third is samsung, which really over photo processes. Yeah, and you might hear a lot of photographers saying they don't like how the samsung looks, but remember, these camera phones are not Made for the same audience. As a professional photographer, you wouldn't shoot a wedding with a camera phone, right, and you want more. You want more control and that's why you would use a professional digital camera. But a lot of most people who using smartphone cameras are, you know, doing it for instagram, right?\n\n1:39:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd we that's. The thing, too, is that so many of us are taking photographs in what Actual professional photographers would call low light settings, because a lot of us are taking photos indoors, and even just being indoors, even with lights turned on into space, still ends up being what is technically low light, and so you think about having these photographs that if we were taking them With with a professional camera, even if we bumped up the iso and we did this into that without more lighting, it's gonna look pretty Grainy and bad. What our photo, what our cameras are able to do, though our phone cameras are able to do, is take something that isn't a low light and make it look better, like some photos that you took recently this is uh when I was in Rhode Island, we had an amazing hammer.\n\n1:39:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow this was. I was actually testing the camera. This is the iphone 14 or 15 pro max, because it was very dim. Now you have to hold the camera steady. But look at, for instance, look at the background, look at the lights, the bokeh. The bokeh on this was gorgeous. This is not portrait mode. Um, the detail is c"
