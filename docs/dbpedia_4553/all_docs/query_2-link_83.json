        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nPenelope\n\nFor over two weeks, she has been getting to know George and she can see he is actually a decent man. He is very discreet about her arrangement with Colin, although he expresses his disagreement with it and advises her to eventually tell the truth.\n\nShe could see it was good for Colin to have him near. He help him the same way Nico and Agatha helped her when Thomas was born, giving him pieces of advice on how to handle certain things when it comes to a baby.\n\nThomas was starting to crawl, he was slow and still unsure of how to proceed so he only managed to move a small distance before laying to the ground again. This meant he would need a new wardrobe which Colin was eager to purchase not letting her pay for anything.\n\n“You took care of everything for three months, please, let me do this for you both,” Colin said to her when they went to the modiste and he started to ask for more clothes than she planned\n\nShe ended up accepting it with a sigh and her heart skipped a bit when Colin smiled widely at her. She has been able to keep her distance for three months now but it was getting harder every day, especially since he was trying so hard to at least be her friend again. Penelope admits she misses her friendship with him, it was so simple back then. She can’t help but laugh affectionally when she sees him get excited about a small milestone Thomas reached. Maybe she can lend him their son’s journal so he can read the first three months of his life, she was still thinking about it.\n\n“Colin, he just turned seven months, he will grow out of these clothes in no time, it’s too much” She exclaimed laughing when she saw how many orders he was putting\n\n“On the contrary, I think it’s not nearly enough!” He responded with a cheeky smile\n\nThe modiste laughed and said she could always put it away until she had another son, which made her blush and Colin looked at her longing with his ridiculous and adorable puppy eyes.\n\n“Just…no yellow,” She said and exited the shop in haste\n\nTwo days after they visited the modiste she was in the Drakos garden reading on her favourite bench facing the ocean view while Colin was inside with Thomas and George when she felt someone grab her by her shoulder making her jump and gasp loudly. She almost threw her book towards whoever scared her until she turned and saw who it was.\n\n“Harris?!”\n\n“A bit skittish are we Anne?” He said laughing\n\n“You…horrible man!” She said punching him in his arm with her book as he continued laughing, “You scared me to death”\n\nHe chuckled, “Ah come on gorgeous, I would never let you perish, I would just simply give you mouth-to-mouth to bring you back” He winked at her suggestively\n\n“You are incorrigible!” Penelope whispered amused\n\nHe took a step closer, “You know you love it, Annie”\n\nShe blushed but took a step back from him, “I thought you were going back to Scotland since I didn’t hear from you after our last letter”\n\n“I encountered some problems with the business and had to delay my trip two more weeks” he flirtatiously smiled, “sorry to disappoint you”\n\nShe rolled her eyes, “It’s good having you back, Harris”\n\nHe snorted, “How have you been? How’s the little lad?”\n\nShe sighed remembering everything that had happened since Harris left. He was only gone a little over three months but felt like a year.\n\n“Did something happen?” He said losing his smile\n\n“Oh, no, we are fine, truly, it’s just that, uhm…okay yes, something happened”\n\nHe crossed his arms and furrowed his eyes, “Annie, you are making me worry, are Nico and Aggie okay? I was told they were out but—”\n\n“Harris no! They are fine, it’s not about them, it’s about me”\n\n“Okay, then what is it?”\n\nShe took a deep breath, sat down beside him, and told him about her brother-in-law showing up and how it had changed the dynamics with everyone. She mentioned his resemblance to Thomas and the bond they were forming.\n\n“Annie, that’s incredible, especially for Thomas. You had me worried for a minute there with how serious you were” He laughed, “And from what you have told me he seems happy to be providing for his nephew”\n\nShe was still not used to people calling Thomas Colin’s nephew, it felt wrong and always made her shiver. She can only imagine how Colin feels about it.\n\n“Yes, he is, although sometimes he goes over the board with the things he gives him, I don’t know where I’m going to put all his clothes and toys if he keeps up like that”\n\nHarris snorts, “Can’t blame him, if my only brother passed away and then I found out he had a child I would spoil him too”\n\nPenelope smiled awkwardly at his comment. Sometimes, she wishes she had a George with whom she could talk about how she was feeling. Now she can understand Colin’s bond with the older man. She and Harris catch up for a little while about his trip, he sometimes tries to flirt with her but she doesn’t feel comfortable reciprocating which is weird since she didn’t have any problems doing it three months ago.\n\nShe knew she couldn’t delay introducing him to Colin since Harris wanted to see Thomas, so they walked together to the drawing room where George, Colin, Thomas and Jane were. She heard her son's laughter and she smiled.\n\nWhen they entered the room Thomas was being tickled by George on the couch as Colin watched smiling and laughing beside them. Jane was in an armchair knitting as she smiled at the scene. Penelope was glad that Thomas was already warming up with George.\n\n“Harris!” Jane gasped standing up to walk towards him and hug him\n\n“Jane! Good to see you” He kissed her temple lovely, Jane always considered Harris like her little brother which Penelope finds adorable\n\nColin and George approached them with Thomas on George’s arm, she was about to speak when her son recognised Harris and started laughing in delight extending his little arms towards him.\n\n“Little lad! God, you’re so big” Said Harris taking him from George and hugging him\n\nShe noticed how Colin furrowed his eyes and assessed Harris, his shoulders were tense and he turned to look at her with questioning eyes.\n\nPenelope cleared her throat, “Harris, this is Colin Bridges, my late husband’s brother” She turned to look at Colin, “Colin, this is Harris MacTavish, he’s a good family friend”\n\n“A pleasure to meet you,” Said Harris cheerfully extending a hand towards him\n\nColin looked down at Harris's hand and then back at him, he exhaled through his nose and shook his hand nodding one time his head but saying nothing. Penelope found his behaviour out of character.\n\n“And this is George Hogarth, he is one of Colin’s good friends”\n\nHarris did the same with George and shook his hand as the older man smiled at him, at least someone had good manners, she thought.\n\n“Well, Annie was not joking when she told me this little lad looked like his uncle,” Harris said as he bounced Thomas gently on his arms as he looks at Colin\n\n“Annie?” Colin asked\n\nHarris chuckled, “Ah, sorry, Anne, I always call her Annie” he winked at Penelope\n\nShe snorted and blushed a little rolling her eyes. Thomas saw Penelope and cried out “Mama” as he extended his arms. Since the first time he said his first word he couldn’t stop saying it whenever he could. She took him and everyone went to sit down.\n\nColin\n\nWho the fuck was this man? He didn’t like him one bit, especially how his son seemed to be familiar with him. He dares to sit beside his Penelope and talk to her like they were intimate friends. He couldn’t even eat anything from all the delicious pastries and sandwiches they brought because he couldn’t stomach it. Watching his son pay attention to this man and completely ignore him as he talks about how he met Thomas when he was just a little thing was making him feel murderous.\n\nAlso, Penelope seems way too comfortable with this Harris, he doesn’t like it at all. His hands are way too friendly around her, touching her shoulder or her back every once in a while. For the first time since finding them, he wanted a drink.\n\n“So, Harris” Colin started, “when did you say you were leaving for Scotland?”\n\n“I didn’t,” Harris said arching an eyebrow, “since I’m planning to stay the remaining of the year”\n\nJane cried out delighted, “What wonderful news o philtate!”\n\n“Nico and Aggie are going to be thrilled by this,” said Penelope as she bounced Thomas on one leg\n\nHe clenched his jaw and growled slyly, George who heard him nudge him with his elbow discreetly on his ribs.\n\nGeorge cleared his throat as he took a sip of his tea, “The missus must not be so happy by the news”\n\n“Fortunately there is no missus to worry about” Said Harris amused\n\n“Oh, no even a special lady back home?” Asked George\n\nHarris snorts, “Back home? God no, a special lady…perhaps” He turns to look at Penelope out of the corner of his eye quickly as she helps Thomas to bounce on his feet on the floor distracted by what he just said\n\nHe saw red.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something when a maid appeared at the door requesting Janes's assistance with the menu for tonight’s dinner. She excused herself and left the three (and a half) men alone with Penelope. Colin turned to look at Thomas being fed a small piece of biscuit by Harris.\n\n“It seems Thomas is very well acquainted with you” Colin said a bit too aggressively\n\nHe seemed not to notice or ignore his tone, “Yes well, like I said, I met him when he was just a tiny little bean, I’m just glad he remembered me”\n\nPenelope laughed, “I don’t think it’s possible to forget you, Harris”\n\n“And why is that Anne?” Asked Colin exasperated\n\nShe frowned her eyes, “Because he is an excellent friend and helped me a lot with Thomas when he was available the same way Nico and Aggie did”\n\n“Oh so like a brother, right? Since Nico and Aggie are basically your parents”\n\nHarris chuckled, “I wouldn’t go as far as to say a brother”\n\nPenelope sighed, “It’s different, Colin”\n\n“Oh, different?” He asked leaning on his knees with his elbows, “Why would be different Anne? You never had a brother, won’t it be nice to have one?”\n\n“I already have three brothers and you already met them” She said referring to the Drakos children\n\n“Now it can be four!” He said smiling sarcastically\n\n“I already have a sister with Jane, I’m good” Added Harris amused\n\n“Besides, I don’t see Harris as a brother”\n\nColin’s jaw was so tense he felt it would snap at any moment, “Then how do you see him, Anne?”\n\n“I already told you, as a good friend” She sat Thomas beside her as he played with his colour cubes minding his own business and Harris smiled at her\n\n“You mean a good friend like you were with Eloise or a good friend like you were with the father of your child?” He asked viciously making Penelope gasp outraged\n\n“Colin!” Said George firmly but he ignored him\n\n“Who’s Eloise?” Aked Harris taken aback\n\nShe turned to look at Harris trying to fake a smile “It was a friend back in London that I lost contact with a year before leaving”\n\n“Oh, a friend? Not a good friend?” Colin asked mockingly\n\n“What’s the matter with you, Colin?”\n\n“Okay look” Harris intervened, “I know that Anne was your brother’s wife, so I understand this…protectiveness. But she is a grown free woman who can make her own choices regarding who she allows to enter her life”\n\nOh, how Colin wanted to kill him with his own hands. He can see right through him and it’s evident that he wants her. With just the way he looks at her anyone can notice it just like he can see he is a total rake. He won’t stand for having that kind of people near his son as an example.\n\n“It matters because by doing that they also enter my so—nephew’s life!”\n\n“You think Annie will let just anyone approach Thomas? She’s an excellent mother”\n\nHe snapped, “She let you in when clearly you want more than friendship, what I’m supposed to think?!”\n\n“Colin!” George and Penelope screamed at the same time\n\nHarris laughed. He had the audacity to laugh in Colin’s face as if he just told the most hilarious joke in the world.\n\n“Lad, if I didn’t know better I would say you were the husband all along” He wiped a tear that was about to fall from his right eye, “I know she is your sister-in-law but, what if I do want more than friendship with Annie? She is a beautiful woman who any man would be lucky to have”\n\n“Harris…” Penelope started\n\n“So you admit it then?” Colin interrupted, “You admit you are around Anne because you want something more”\n\nHarris snorted and shrugged, “She knows it since we met”\n\nHe felt his blood boil. Does this mean that they…NO! He’s not going there, he can’t even start to imagine the possibility of his Penelope with this low-class rake. He couldn’t take it anymore, the little resistance he had to keep calm jumped out of the window and stood up.\n\n“WHAT THE HELL ANNE!” He yelled, “YOU KNOW AND STILL ALLOW HIM TO BE CLOSE TO YOU?!”\n\nBefore anyone could answer Thomas started crying since he got scared of Colin’s sudden scream. Penelope sprang into action to calm her son and George grabbed Colin’s arm with force and dragged him out of the room at an incredible speed.\n\nHe tried to fight the older man's grip on him but was so out of control that George managed to keep him close until they were outside the house.\n\n“Keep walking!” George growled as he guided him to his lodgings\n\nOnce inside George slammed the door and yelled, “DID YOU LOST YOUR GODDAMN MIND COLIN?!”\n\n“What?! Why me?! He is the one who—“\n\n“You behaved like a jealous husband and a lunatic!”\n\nThat felt like a stab to his heart, “She is the mother of my child, George!”\n\n“Oh, and that means you own her?!”\n\n“Of course not! But she is allowing that rake to get close—“\n\n“You made your kid cry with your outburst, for God's sake!”\n\nHe flinched a little, “If that fat twit wasn’t there it would have never—“\n\nHe sighed loudly, “Let’s not pretend this is about Harris being around your son when it’s about him being around Penelope!\n\nHe groaned frustrated cursing, “Didn’t you see the way he was looking at her?!“\n\n“Of course I saw it, he was not trying to hide it!”\n\n“Exactly! He had no shame whatsoever, he’s the lowest of the rakes I—“\n\nHe sighed loudly, “And Penelope didn’t mind it!”\n\nHe stared at him for a few seconds, “What?”\n\n“Colin…” He took a breath, “It didn’t seem like the first time he was behaving like that with her”\n\nHe rolled his eyes, “Well of course not! He just admitted he is pursuing—“\n\n“Colin! She was comfortable with him”\n\nHis breath caught in his throat, “What’s that supposed to mean?”\n\nGeorge looks at him with…pitty? No, it can’t be, he has never looked at him like that. A part of him knew what he was trying to say, which made him sick to the stomach. George doesn’t know his Pen, he doesn’t know what he is talking about. Right?\n\nHe started to pace around the room like a cadge animal, he could feel his hand shake and in his mind, a thousand possibilities were running around. He could kill for a whiskey right now to calm down.\n\nGeorge was looking at him with his arms crossed while reclining into the nearest wall. He was allowing Colin time to digest everything that just happened.\n\nColin shook his head rapidly, “No, no, no, it’s—Penelope wouldn’t do that”\n\nGeorge sighed, “Colin…”\n\nHe turned to look at him, “No! It’s impossible, it can’t—“\n\n“Why on earth would it be impossible?”\n\n“Because—“ He slides his hand through his hair, “She is…Pen”\n\nGeorge scrunched his face and looked at him like a two-headed person, “That doesn’t make any sense whatsoever”\n\n“Neither is she with that…” He growled instead of saying his name\n\n“No, it does make sense…no! Let me speak!” George scolded Colin when he saw he was going to interrupt again, “She believed in her heart that you never loved her because of what happened, which I don’t blame her. She was so convinced that she preferred to keep running into an unknown country than turn around to London once she found out she was with child. She never thought she was going to see you again because it never crossed her mind that you would go after her at some point. After all, she supposedly gave you back the freedom you desperately wanted. So, no one can blame her for indulging in some…distractions”\n\n“Dis—“ Colin whined with pain, “She would never step so low to…bed an evident rake”\n\nGeorge frowned his eyes and looked at Colin with fire in his eyes, “You are one Goddamned hypocrite Colin Bridgerton!\n\nHe looked at him outraged, “Excuse me?!”\n\n“Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn’t bed a harlot before you set sail to find her!”\n\n“I did not! The last woman I bedded was Pen!” He roars\n\n“Oh, okay, so that means you never stood in a single brothel in all those seven months, right?”\n\nHe choked and frizzed. George arched an eyebrow and smirked while Colin couldn’t find any words to say.\n\nGeorge shook his head in disappointment, “That’s what I thought” he turned around and started to make his way towards the front door\n\n“It’s different!” Colin managed to say\n\nGeorge gave a humourless laugh as he turned to look at Colin, “Different? My God, please, enlighten me, why different?”\n\n“I didn’t touch them!”\n\nHe snorted, “Jesus, Colin…so you only went to what? Watch?”\n\n“No, it’s—I just—Is not like that…”\n\n“Oh! Of course not!” he said sarcastically, “they used their mouths on you, isn’t it?” Colin’s expression was the answer George needed, “Right, but, hey! You didn’t touch them!” He said mocking him\n\n“I didn’t! And I didn’t allow them to touch my body either!” He said taking a step towards him\n\n“Are you—“ George squeezed his eyes with the palm of his hands and sighed defeated throwing his head backwards and groaning, “They touched your cock, son. That is part of your body! You were touched, and I can bet a lot of money on this, by several women throughout the months you were in London! And guess what? You also touched them back, not with your hands, but you were sure as hell balls deep in their mouths!”\n\nHe got close to Colin and pointed a finger at him at his face level, “So don’t give me that shite of Penelope stepping so low with ONE single man when you are the one who made her feel she had no choice but to run away to avoid trapping you and start anew!”\n\nColin froze and stared at him with teary eyes. George took two steps back until he turned around and grabbed the doorknob to exit and paused for a few seconds, his shoulders were tense. He turned his face a little so Colin could see the side of his face.\n\n“Think about what you did, son. This is not the road that will lead you back into her arms but further away, you will have to apologise.” He opened the door and took a step out before stopping again, “I’m taking a walk around the bayside, you are welcome to join me if you wish to” With that he exited the house and closed the door\n\nColin was feeling too much at once—regret, anger, sorrow, frustration. His son's scared face when he shouted was clear in his mind. Seeing Penelope with Harris made him lose his sanity even more than when she was being courted by Lord Debling. And yes, in a way George was right. He did seek satisfaction in brothels when the memories were too much and drank himself silly.\n\nA tear ran down his cheek and he wiped it fast. He looked around and saw Thomas's cradle, children’s books, rattles and small toys. For the last two weeks, Penelope has been letting him spend some nights with his son, he could even see her eyes soften from time to time whenever he succeded in getting a laugh out of her. Now he suspects will be back to the starting line with how he acted earlier and the single thought was making him spiral. Three months of work were thrown away in a second because he couldn’t control his jealousy and lost his temper. Thank God Nico and Agatha were not in the house when it happened. If George wasn’t there to take him away…it scared him to think about what would have happened.\n\nHe knew he was going to lose his mind if he stayed inside his lodgings, and he couldn’t see Penelope or his son right now for obvious reasons.\n\nHe started at the front door for a few seconds more and decided to follow George.\n\nPenelope\n\nShe sees how George dragged Colin out of the room in haste as she tried to calm her son in her arms. Harris was beside her extremely quiet.\n\nPenelope was trying to swallow her anger as much as she could as she walked around the drawing room bouncing Thomas and humming a lullaby. That seemed to be working since his cries were subsiding. She sat down again, placing Thomas between Harris and herself. She gave him some toys to distract him and a small biscuit, which did the trick, and his tears stopped completely. She cleaned his little chubby face with a handkerchief and he laughed a little.\n\nPenelope turned to look at Harris, who seemed lost in his thoughts, his face very serious as he stared at nothing in particular on the floor.\n\n“Harris” She called him gently and he turned to look at her, “I’m extremely sorry for what happened, I don’t know why he acted this—“\n\n“That was not normal brother-in-law behaviour, Anne” He interrupted her and she felt a shiver run down her spine with his serious tone. She had never heard him sound like that before and the fact that he was calling her Annie anymore should not be good, “That was the behaviour of a jealous man. Who is very much in love”\n\nHer breath got caught and try to hide her panic that was starting to rise to the surface at a fast speed. She wanted to strangle Colin for putting her in this situation. Why would he act like a complete madman? She opened her mouth a few times trying to say something but nothing was coming out.\n\nHe sighed, “I would never judge Anne, I hope you know that. He has been here for three months now and he resembles your late husband, a lot, I would never blame you for starting an affair with your brother-in—“\n\n“Oh God, Harris no, stop!” She begged mortified, “I’m not having an affair with Colin!” She whispered-shouted\n\n“Annie, it’s okay, truly, I know how to keep—“\n\n“My God!” She hides her face in her hands as she supports her elbows on her knees, “I swear I’m not, you must believe me”\n\nHarris took her hands away from her face gently and lowered them to her lap as he gave her a smirk.\n\n“In that case, he wishes for one, Annie, the moment you introduced us he never stopped throwing daggers with his eyes at me” He laughed, “I was having fun teasing him actually”\n\n“Harris MacTavish! Was that the reason you were more flirtatious than normal?!” She scowled him\n\nHe smiled cheekily and laughed out loud when Penelope hit him with a pillow, “I couldn’t help it! It was so easy to get a reaction out of him!”\n\n“Incorrigible!” And gave him one more hit letting him take the pillow away to the other side\n\nShe cleaned the crumbs around Thomas's mouth since he already finished his small biscuit, helped him drink a bit of water and let him continue exploring his colour cubes.\n\n“But seriously Anne, something doesn’t make sense here, no man would act that way towards a woman who doesn’t reciprocate his feelings or at least had something with her in the past” Harris was back to his serious tone and expression, “and you said you meet him only once on your wedding day, so either you had an affair with him that day, which I doubt, or you are not telling me something”\n\nPenelope started to shake and looked away from him. Harris is a smart man who is almost impossible to fool. And he already suspected there was something deeper than what they showed to everyone. She wanted to cry and shout at Colin for ruining the life she had here, she knew that he would sooner or later because that’s his speciality. If Harris is right and he is acting like a jealous man…God! She wanted to scream. He has no right to be jealous, they are not even friends!\n\nCan she even trust Harris with the truth? She really considers him a good friend and it would hurt her to lose him, and even worse if he tells Nico and Agatha.\n\nShe felt how he grabbed one of her hands with his to get her attention, “Annie, whatever it is you can trust me, I’m serious when I say I know how to keep a secret and I will never, ever, judge you”\n\nWas she really going to do this? Can she actually trust Harris with this? If what he says is true then she will finally have a friend she can talk to about her situation and would be discreet. But she has been burned many times for trusting the wrong people.\n\nShe really doesn’t want to leave this place but she would have to do it if Harris turned her in with everyone she loves. She prays it doesn’t come down to that, it would make her hate Colin and she doesn’t want to hate Thomas's father, it would not set a good example and she swore he would never go through what she did with her parents.\n\nWith her mindset, she told Harris to call Jane so she could take Thomas for a while. If she is going to tell him the truth it would not be inside the Drakos property.\n\nOnce they were outside, she took him to the bench where she had met Nico and where Colin had come up with the whole facade of being her brother-in-law.\n\nShe was really nervous but he assured her by holding affectionately one of her hands and smiling at her. She took a deep breath and once she started to speak it was like a damp broke and all the water came rushing down with no way of stopping it.\n\nHe never interrupted and never let go of her hand. She didn’t hold back anything— her friendship with Colin, her unrequited love, the Bridgertons, her family, Whistledown. Nothing was left unsaid. She even explained her fear of telling everyone the truth since it was the first time she had ever felt this kind of love and acceptance.\n\nWhen she finished he took his hand away from her slowly and stood up facing the ocean as he hugged himself. She understands it was a lot to take in so she didn’t say anything and let him be.\n\nIt was perhaps five minutes in which Harris was standing there but they felt like an hour for Penelope. He turned around towards her and sat down in his previous place but with his eyes still on the horizon and with his forearms supported by his legs. He didn’t look angry or surprised, his face was expressionless and she couldn’t decide if that was better or worse than any reaction.\n\n“I’m going to hurt him” He finally said\n\n“What?”\n\nHe straightens his back and turns to look at her, “Next time I see him, I’m going to hurt him”\n\nHe stood up from the bench again and Penelope did the same, “Harris, there is no need to—“\n\n“He made you feel like you were not worth it, Annie! No man who calls themselves a gentleman will ever do something as low as that!” He growled\n\n“You need to understand that what I wrote in Whistle—“\n\n“The one where you saved him from that wretched woman trying to trap him you mean? Or the one where you saved his sister and entire family from complete and total ruin against the Queen?” He asked grimly\n\n“It was not only that Harris, I told you—“\n\n“You only wrote what was already being said among hushed voices, you never lied about anything, if they cared so much about their secrets being exposed they would have never talked about them so carelessly in a forsaking ball!\n\nHe took a deep breath, sighed with a groan and lay his hands above the stone wall that separated them from the cliff towards the sea. She approached him and imitated his posture but with her eyes on him.\n\n“So you don’t…hate me?” Penelope asked shyly\n\nHe turned to look at her in shock, “Hate you? Why on earth will I hate you?”\n\n“I lied to everyone Harris, I was—“\n\n“He made you feel like you had no choice, I couldn't possibly hate you for what you had to do to survive! Him, however…”\n\n“Wait! So you are not even angry at me?” Penelope asked incredulously\n\nHe turned his whole body towards her with murderous eyes, “That is exactly why I hate that arsehole so much now”\n\nShe flinched a little for the cursed word, “What?”\n\n“He claimed to love you and the moment he found out you were actually a human being with flaws and secrets he treated you like a pest! And not only him but his sister as well. That’s why you were on the edge of a panic attack before telling me the truth, you were afraid I was going to react the same way”\n\nShe was fidgeting with her fingers, “I—well—“\n\n“It was not a question Annie” He said holding her shoulders with his hands gently, “If the person I loved my whole life and best friend were capable of such treatment I would expect everyone around me to have the same behaviour”\n\nShe was grateful that Harris wasn’t looking at her with pity. He had sympathy in his eyes and that made her feel comfortable. She was prepared to have him scream and leave her standing there alone with a broken heart. Now she would have someone to talk to who knows the whole truth.\n\n“Can we please keep this to ourselves?” She asked him with pleading eyes\n\n“If that is what you wish I will respect it but Annie, Nico and Agatha will not—“\n\nPanicked ran through her body, “No! Please! Don’t tell them, it would kill me to lose them!”\n\n“Annie, trust me, they—“\n\nTears ran down her eyes, “Harris, please you said you will respect my wish!”\n\n“And I will! I’m just trying to tell you that if they know—“\n\nShe held onto his coat with both fists, “They can’t know! Harris, they are not you, I can’t bear losing them, I beg you, please…”\n\nHe was looking at her with concern in his eyes until he enveloped her around his arms and hugged her tightly, “Shhh, it’s okay, I got you” he reassured her caressing her head\n\nShe was sobbing against his chest, “Don’t tell them…please…promise me”\n\nHe held her even tighter, “I promise Annie,”\n\nShe let herself cry while Harris hugged her, she didn’t know how much time she was wrapped around his arms but it felt safe.\n\nHer face was buried in his chest so she never noticed that while Harris was reassuring her and holding her so gently his eyes were screaming bloody murder as he looked straight to where he knew Colin’s lodgings were.\n\nThey walked together to the Drakos house once Penelope calmed down and cleaned her tears with Harris's handkerchief. The Drakos were already there and she spent the rest of the day with them. George sent a note that he and Colin would not be able to attend dinner and she felt relieved. She knows she will have to talk to him eventually but tonight was too soon to even look at his face and not snap at him.\n\nThat night with only the Drakos, Harris and her son at the dining table she pretended that her life was still the same as it had been four months ago…before Colin Bridgerton put her world upside down once again."
