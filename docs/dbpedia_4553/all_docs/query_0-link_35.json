Time codes refer to the approximate times in the ad-supported version of the show.\n\n00:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's time for Twit this Week in Tech. Larry Magid is here, Denise Howell, our favorite internet attorney. Elwynn Thomas, is here from the San Francisco Business Times. We are going to talk about the amazing AI music how far we've come and how crazy AI is. It makes it possible to create a self-running propaganda machine for a little more than a hundred bucks. The passing of a great physicist who changed our understanding of the world around us, and the FCC brings back net neutrality. All that and a lot more coming up next on a great Twitter. Stay here.\n\n00:38 - Benito (Other)\n\nPodcasts you love from people you trust. This is TWIT.\n\n00:51 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThis is TWIT this Week in Tech, episode 975. Recorded Sunday, april 14th 2024. You don't want to make Gandhi mad. It's time for Twit this Week in Tech. Oh, I love this show because I love this panel. Owen Thomas is back from the San Francisco Business Times. Hello, owen.\n\n01:18 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nHello from non-zombified downtown San Francisco.\n\n01:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, it's hot, it's happening, it's hip. It's where all the cool kids are. They go to lunch at South Park. They watch movies at the IMAX at the Metreon. They like to go into the Bank of America building for brunch Right.\n\n01:36 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nActually, the new hotness is Ikea's Sally Hall. It is plant forward, it is, you know, it's got pop-ups. It's got Bergara bar, where I had a beyond meat patty with some slaw and vegan fish roe, which I didn't even know was a thing, but it was tasty, do they ever do, like Swedish meatballs with lingonberries or something, or like impossible meatballs with lingonberries or something, or like impossible meatballs.\n\n02:05\n\nSo there is an Ikea deli that's like in the Ikea store but adjacent to the food hall and they've got your plant balls, they've got your regular Swedish meatballs. They're not pushing the plant like so heavily that you can't get a Swedish meatball. Because I think if you shop at Ikea and you don't have a plate of Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce, the universe folds into itself. It is the greatest.\n\n02:31 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIf you shop at Ikea, you'll never get out of Ikea. My only problem is if you need to get into an Ikea. If you try getting out of one, you have to walk the entire store. Yeah, they're clever.\n\n02:42 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's Larry Magid, president and CEO of Connect Safely, longtime CBS radio commentator. Great to have you, Larry, and I heard the discord, the distaff sounds of the wonderful Denise Howell attorney at large.\n\n02:58\n\nI've learned that this taff, which for years I used as kind of you know kind of commonplace way of referring to women, is very, very demeaning, so I'm not going to do that anymore. I apologize, I thought I was being literary or something. Anyway, good to have you all. We've been playing before the show and I apologize ahead of time because every musician in the audience goes crazy but this week two not one, but two AI-generated music sites just took off. One's been around for a while sunocom, in fact I think it's related to OpenAI because Microsoft offers it in their copilot Bing plug-ins and then another one called UDIO, which I just realized is audio without the A or studio without the ST. Both of them are, in this case, generating music.\n\n04:02 - Benito (Other)\n\nThere's one simple bit. Oh, you're using me, sorry, I was going to UDIO and I wound up generating music. There's one simple bit oh you're using me.\n\n04:06 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nsorry, I was going to UDIO and I wound up generating sound.\n\n04:10 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nBut what's impressive about these and this has been look, there's the naysayers who say yeah, of course, for AI to generate art or music which is kind of imperfect by design and not hard to measure its success. These are perfect choices, because a hallucination in a song or a hallucination in art, you know, just looks interesting as opposed to hallucination when you're writing a pleading for the Supreme Court, which is not interesting but in fact offensive to the court is a little bit more challenging. But I have to say I'm very impressed by both of these. Now, benito, who's an actual musician, says you say they're not musical.\n\n04:55 - Benito (Other)\n\nIt's not art.\n\n04:56 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's not art. Well, we know it's not art. It's AI. Any more than an AI short story is art right.\n\n05:01 - Benito (Other)\n\nYeah, I mean then, if it's not for art, then it's pretty much disposable music, right?\n\n05:05 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, a lot of music these days is disposable. You ever been to a Las Vegas casino? I absolutely agree with that. Here is German Klezmer from Suno. And, by the way, not only can it play in different styles, it can speak different languages. Now you may say that's not musical, but if that showed up on my Pandora playlist I would not immediately go oh, there's something wrong with my radio. Right, that's Suno. I think Suno does largely a better job than Udio. This is Udio.\n\n05:55 - AI Music\n\nYou spilt a coffee on my dog, ain't no mistake. You dropped that brew, yeah, on my furry friend today.\n\n06:04 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThat's terrible. I think that's terrible. I think that's a philosophical question as to whether it's art. I mean by Webster's definition of art. I suspect it isn't art.\n\n06:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think Benito may be right. But but what is art anyway, right?\n\n06:20 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWhat is art? I mean if it creates things that we enjoy watching, listening to, reading. Is it not art? I don't know.\n\n06:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHere's the thing that is kind of blowing me away. So I played with Suno last December on Windows Weekly and we made a Christmas song. I'll play a little bit of it, because it's too much, too horrible to listen to much of.\n\n06:43 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI've heard worse things on the radio.\n\n06:47 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah, especially at Christmas time. Yeah, really.\n\n06:50 - AI Music\n\nI can't believe it's true Mistletoe and presents all the joy that you bring.\n\n06:56 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's just, it's not. It sounds like a robot. Fast forward literally four months later and it's making. Well, I'll play something. Um, I'll play some, some stuff I made earlier for our shows. Uh uh, jeff jarvis wanted me make a song about cachoy pepe. Wow. That's pretty good. It's written in opera.\n\n07:47\n\nAbout Cacio e Pepe. And it does this in under a minute. Right, I mean you might say, well, yeah, obviously it's under a minute, but I don't. I'm pretty impressed. This is a song I wrote for our friend Craig Newmark of Craigslist. He's a pigeon fancier. In fact he's taken his vast fortune that he made on the backs of putting newspapers out of business with their classified ads. No, that's sorry, craig. The vast fortune he made out of a really useful tool called Craigslist and is one of his charities. He has many charities, including some good journalistic charities. One of them is pigeons. He likes pigeons, so I wrote him a song.\n\n08:23 - AI Music\n\nIn the land of the internet. There was a man named Craig. He had a passion for pigeons, like no one could explain.\n\n08:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNow, that's good, harmony.\n\n08:36 - AI Music\n\nHe sailed the west-west ocean in search of pigeon. Lore His love for these feathery friends forever to explore.\n\n08:47 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI asked it for a sea shanty.\n\n08:49 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI was going to say New mock pigeon man.\n\n08:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNow all I'm saying is in three months, very noticeable progress to the point where, okay, maybe you know, when you look at Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, if you look closely you might see some weird things that you go, that's probably an AI. I'm not saying they're perfect, I'm not saying they're duplicating human effort, but I am impressed. Am I wrong to be impressed?\n\n09:15 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI want to know how much computing power this is consuming oh the lights went down in Boston.\n\n09:22 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWhen I did it, I mean I'm sure a ton right. The lights went down in Boston when I did it, I mean I'm sure a ton right. This is completely untenable from an environmental point of view.\n\n09:30 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nHow many trees should Leo now plant? That's a lot.\n\n09:36 - Benito (Other)\n\nExactly.\n\n09:36 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nyeah, that's an example, I don't know if are we going to put all of the crypto universe out of business and salvage this music. I mean, somebody's out there using cycles anyway.\n\n09:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo yeah, and all AI is. Well, we know this and this is a problem and I think that because it costs these companies money, they are strongly incented to solve this. That's one of the reasons I think there's a push for on device AI and so forth. I don't you know. I don't know how much this uses, but you're right, I'm blithely spending on my children's future to make sea shanties about Craig Newmark, I admit it.\n\n10:13 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAnd so much of it is venture backed, right, right. It's funny to me, like when AI gets into real economics. It's kind of like when you suddenly discovered you couldn't get a lift in downtown San Francisco for $2.99 anymore.\n\n10:26 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIt also depends on whether their servers are using coal or hydro or other renewables to generate the power. So I mean, in theory we might be able to make that up with renewables. But you're right, I mean AI is you know? I remember in the early days of computers, remember the paperless office, oh yeah, and the promise that computers were going to save us so many of the world's resources. And I don't think it turned out quite that way.\n\n10:50 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNo, so, setting the admittedly problematic energy use aside, I guess the thing that I'm most interested in is ai is making progress in very interesting leaps and bounds. Yes, is that right? Or no is it? Is it yet it's not. Look, I think it's a mistake to say we want agi, we want, uh, general intelligence. Uh, I don't think we we need or want that, and maybe we won't even be able to get that, but is?\n\n11:21 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nit it useful. Well, like you, I've been at this technology beat for, in my case, over 40 years, and I've seen a handful of major paradigm shifts, and this is definitely one of them. On par with the World Wide Web I guess I'd put the Mac as one of the paradigm shifts or the graphical interface this is huge. I mean, I've seen more progress in the last year in many ways than I've seen in the last 10 years. So I I would agree with you, I think, I think, I think you know not just this, but all of the ai products that we're seeing are are blowing me away. You know, it kind of makes it make covering tech interesting again.\n\n11:57 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nFrankly, uh, last year there was a story, uh, about deep mind. Google's uh, ai, the one that you know created a chess playing machine machine that could beat Garry Kasparov and a go-playing machine that could beat Lee Sudol. It found 2.2 million crystal structures in material science, which is 45 times larger than the number of different crystal kinds we've unearthed in the entire history of science. Now, that was the story in November. The story that came out this week is yeah, but most of those crystals no big deal, like ho-hum, and I guess in a way that's kind of the whole story of AI. In general, it comes up with this amazing stuff, but maybe it's not going to change the world.\n\n12:51 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI don't know now, I think it is I, I think it's going to get integrated into so much of what we do that you know the, the, whether it's music and art, or you know discoveries, like you were saying, crystals, or medications or compounds, crystals that could become medications right, I mean it's connecting the dots in ways that are faster and more comprehensive than we're able to do on our own.\n\n13:20 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAnd I'd argue the ho-hum is actually what AI is really good at.\n\n13:25 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's really good, that's true.\n\n13:27 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAI and drug discovery. You're like, you know, it's kind of like those 2.2 million crystal patterns, like you just need to identify as many compounds as possible and then figure out which ones might have therapeutic applications. And you know, like that's always been a computer-assisted process in modern times. But AI of millions of financial files a la the Panama Papers, and finding patterns like what are the common LLCs, what are the common entity names that are shared across these files, because you could do that by hand it would take centuries. So you can do investigations much more efficiently. You can do investigations realistically that you could not have done five years ago, three years ago, even one year ago.\n\n14:30 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight, and that applies in the legal field, in so many fields where data, you know, and making sense of data, is a huge job that is overwhelming for humans on their own.\n\n14:41 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, and not to mention diagnostics. I mean, some of the things that we're going to see in medicine are going to blow us away. It's already beginning. We're going to just see a lot of that. I mean, I have a feeling the idea of a radiologist looking at an X-ray is going to become so passe within a very short time, when AI can analyze an X-ray, know exactly what it's looking at.\n\n15:11 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nBut I suspect the radiologists will need to know like oh, this AI model always misidentifies this kind of tumor and you know and knows how to like enter. You know enter a prompt that, like, deals with those you know quirks of the system. You know that's where the radiologists will move.\n\n15:26 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nRight, and sadly, there'll probably be people, some die, some people will die between now and the time they get it right, and they'll never have it 100 percent right, I mean. So it's not going to be a smooth, everything's perfect, but where it's going is very impressive, very promising.\n\n15:40 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think this, this deep mind crystal research, is almost a template for what is happening everywhere, which is in November, google comes out they say we've created 380,000 new crystal structures more than humankind has created in all the history of science. And then, a month or two later, this is the article that came out this week in chemical materials. They took a random sample of the structures that say none of them meet the three-part test. Uh, that material scientists care about credible, useful and novel, so they've came up with a lot of junk. Now I'm willing to bet that somewhere in those 380 thousands of crystals there are some new crystals that are credible, useful and novel. We don't know yet they haven. Scientists haven't gone through all 380,000. But that is a template for what we are seeing now and a way to temper our expectations.\n\n16:36\n\nI've watched AI because I've been through a few AI winners in my time and as you have too, larry. I'm sure you guys are too young, but Larry and I remember you know the big hype about AI. That happened first happened in the fifties, and then the sixties and the seventies and the eighties, and in every case our hopes were dashed and it turned out Eliza wasn't all that good at being a cyclist.\n\n16:57 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI remember that Well hey.\n\n17:00 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI, I, I. I'm old enough to have hand typed aped Eliza code into my Apple.\n\n17:05 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nTV. But even at that point we all had realized, yeah, this is trivial and not that useful. But I think what's happened this time is we're starting to see some amazing things, like that music I just played for you, as long as we understand what the limits are and we don't get to this point where it's going to replace humans or it's going to be as smart as humans. Maybe it will, I don't know, but it already is incredibly useful if you temper your expectations Right.\n\n17:34 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nRight, and I also don't think it's going to destroy humankind the way some people are claiming as well. That's the other hype around this. You know we're seeing the positive hype and the negative hype. I think it's going to be. You know there's going to be problems and there's going to be great successes. But it's not going to change the world overnight. But boy, it's taking us in some really amazing directions.\n\n17:52 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI predict we'll look back on the AI doomers and we'll realize at least for some of them, like Sam Altman and Elon Musk, it was a way of hyping. Oh, absolutely, it was like oh this is so good it could destroy humankind.\n\n18:06 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWatch out and also trust us. We know what we're doing. The new guys, the startups. They're the ones you have to worry about.\n\n18:17 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo we are in a Gartner hype cycle with AI, with all new technologies, where we get really high and then it goes down and then it comes back. I think we're now coming towards the useful part of it, where we temper our, we don't have the high expectations that are going to take over for humans, and then I'm going to have a robot in the kitchen washing my dishes anytime soon, or a self-driving car that can come pick me up, take me where I'm going and then I get out without any human intervention. That was another thing, that really hasn't happened.\n\n18:48\n\nWe can talk about that later. Well, we can talk about it now, but I do think that there are. That doesn't mean that those cars aren't useful. So we learned that both Cruise and Waymo in San Francisco had far more human interventions than we'd expected. You know, back at the home office, the guy saying oh, yeah, yeah, Drive around that cone. We also learned, you know, Amazon just dropped their uh uh, just take out stuff where you walk, just walk out of the store. Because it turned out they had a thousand people in India looking at every single video to make sure that there was properly charged. It was very human driven.\n\n19:23 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, well, the the reason I said talk about that is that one of the pitches that I made is uh, I just did a story, a story about the new tesla, the 2024 model 3, which, believe it or not, I bought, and much to the chagrin of many of my anti-elon friends and I do, you know?\n\n19:39\n\nThe funny part is, you know, I was actually kicked off twitter's safety advisory board by by elon, so it's not like I'm a friend of his, but you have had multiple Teslas, right? Well, I bought my second Tesla. I know you had one and got rid of it, but I've been beating up on this new self-driving 12.4, the new version that actually came out like two days ago. And I have to say, leo, you can complain all you want and talk about all the things that it does wrong and can't do, but what it does is absolutely amazing and you got to watch it. It can make a mistake, but it really does work. It even made a u-turn for me the other day, which is pretty wow awesome, wow, a three-pointer, or all the way around all the way up.\n\n20:21\n\nYeah, I guess it was all the way around.\n\n20:23 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt doesn't always work if it does a three-pointer, then I'll be impressed.\n\n20:27 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nRemember, this is a car driving itself, a car that a consumer can buy for $38,000. That's what the new Model 3 costs if you buy the short-range version, and on any road. I mean, I drove it on dirt roads, I drove it on alleys. Did you have 12.3? I have 12.4. I had three, I had three and now I have four.\n\n20:47 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo that's what I'm asking Is there a big jump? Cause Elon saying like this is what did he say? 12.4 is another big jump in capabilities.\n\n20:55 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI haven't seen a big jump yet. I've seen some improvements, but, um, I think 12 point whatever is it, is it made it was a major light leap from 11. I mean, that's all I can say for sure. Yeah, at least in my tip. Yeah, and you know, again, I'm not about to sit in the back seat and let it take me somewhere. I, I'm definitely very much on top of it but well, that's, I guess, what I'm saying.\n\n21:17 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nin fact, that's exactly what the point I'm making, which is we've tempered our expectations. We know it's not going to drive us everywhere Right, it's assisting us, but it is a very useful partner in assisting us.\n\n21:32 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWell, frankly, unlike what a lot of people say, it's dangerous. I actually feel a lot safer, especially on the highway, when I'm making a lane change and I've got all these cameras looking out for you to make sure that I'm not going to hit somebody as I make that lane change. So I use it and my eyes and my mirrors and so far it's never made a mistake on the highway like that. It once almost drove over a mattress. It has made some mistakes.\n\n21:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, who hasn't almost driven over a mattress, exactly?\n\n22:00 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIt's never been a close call on a lane change.\n\n22:02 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's okay if the mattress is in the highway. It's different if the mattress is at home. Let's just say there's a qualitative difference in the driving. I've had my car. I had a Tesla which my wife called Christine because it would try to hit her in the head, it would drive her off the road, oh yeah you had the Model X.\n\n22:26\n\nYeah, I had the Model X. So that was a long time ago. That was five years ago or something. Um, I now have a i5, which bmw, which has also very similar adas, assisted driver stuff, but it I was driving down the road and the freeway off-ramp came along and it started going that way. I had to grab the wheel, nothing but that's your. So that's the thing. And I bet you, larry, you don't close your eyes. Of course not, you're paying attention. My wife does.\n\n22:57\n\nShe's closing her eyes because she's in the passenger seat. She's scared as hell.\n\n23:01 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nNo, I'm paying attention.\n\n23:02 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYou're paying attention and maybe even keeping your hands on the wheel. Unlike the Tesla, my Ford and the BMW have cameras watching you and the BMW man you look over here it goes. Hey, pay attention. I mean, it really shouts at you.\n\n23:14 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThe Tesla has that too. It has both two things you have to hold the steering wheel.\n\n23:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's a torque sensor in the steering wheel.\n\n23:20 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nTorque, yeah, and on the new 2024, the torque. You don't have to put as much torque, which is nice, because it used to. It used to ding me all the time and I have to have my hands on the wheel.\n\n23:28 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI don't like it, just doesn't know but yeah, no, I, even my totally non-self-driving car does that and and it's annoying as heck I?\n\n23:38 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI feel like we still have this is still better than nothing. Or is it that the only risk is that humans will ascribe too much, that people will say, oh, I don't have to write songs anymore, I'm just going to have the ai do it, or paint paintings anymore, I'm gonna have the ai do it right article.\n\n23:54 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI don't think the, I don't think the creative impulse goes away at all. I was. I was thinking about this question of whether AI is art that I think Larry had brought up in our pre-show chat. And you know, one definition of art is commercial art. It's the use of skill and experience to create, you know, an artwork which might be like a logo, it might be a billboard. You know that is. It's not maybe artistic or artful, but uh, you know it's like we need a lot of that kind of, you know, our like artistic product.\n\n24:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nLet me give you a good example. I asked, uh suno, to make us some music on hold, music, that art. No, that's not it. Where did I put this? Muzak, yeah, muzak. And you know what? It's fine, it's fine. Now, if I were Kenny G, I might be a little worried. Okay, there are some kind of. There are people who make a living out of, kind of generic music.\n\n25:07 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nLeo, that reminds me of the time Marissa Mayer was CEO of Yahoo and she got caught on a hot mic complaining about the hold music that Yahoo was playing before an investor call, you know, and AI just had not arrived in time, you know, in timely enough fashion. Here's the.\n\n25:25 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think this is this is the waiting music that I had. This is AI generated. This is indistinguishable from the music I hear when I get a massage.\n\n25:38 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI was going to say I feel like I'm in the spa.\n\n25:39 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIt's in the spa Better than a lot of music Right Like it's, it's music art.\n\n25:42 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nNo, If you write music for a living, it's better than a lot of music.\n\n25:45 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nBut Brian like, is Muzak art? No, if you write Muzak for a living, I would be worried. Hey, it's.\n\n25:49 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nMcDonald's food. I mean, how do you, that's right? How do you?\n\n25:53 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nWell, I mean, you're on to something In addition to you know needing to worry about the socioeconomic damage that these tools are doing just by generating them, but also you know the IP landscape and personal data landscape is far from settled about all this what's going to be acceptable and what's not.\n\n26:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI know the patent office has said that you cannot copyright or patent an invention by an AI. That's correct, isn't it?\n\n26:29 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI'm not sure what the patent office has done. Oh okay, yeah, the copyright office made a statement along those lines Okay, yeah, okay.\n\n26:37 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI don't know about patents. I couldn't have ChatGPT write something for me and then copyright that article Correct.\n\n26:44 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nIf it's solely, and, Denise, please correct me if I've got the detail wrong, but I believe the Copyright Office has said if it is solely AI authored it will not accept it and if you used AI assistance, it wants you to disclose that. That's my understanding Interesting.\n\n27:01 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nThat's my understanding, yeah, and again, I feel like this is all a moving target at this point. That that's one data point, but what I'm also driving at here is what of course trains these systems and how we're coming to accord around that.\n\n27:21 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIf I were to ask you, I I don't know who won the election and I'm not trying to be controversial here and you would say all was won by biden. Did you actually look at the federal database that showed who won? Good point that's because good point, you saw it on cnn, you read it. That's right time I saw it in reliable sources yeah, right.\n\n27:40\n\nIf you were to read me the paragraph from the new york times which said that he won the election, then I could question whether that would be plagiarism. But knowledge is knowledge. In fact, I know that, I know. I mean, I know what's going on. We know that facts cannot be copyrighted.\n\n27:54 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWe know that Right Exactly Only the treatment of facts.\n\n27:57 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nSo how can companies like the New York Times, or anybody else, object to ChatGPT using their knowledge any more than if you or I were to say something that we know because we read it in the New York Times?\n\n28:11 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight, its lawsuit is about verbatim Right. Well, that segments yeah.\n\n28:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd they had to really jump through hoops to create those verbatim segments, things like here's the first four paragraphs of the article. What would the fifth be? I mean, look, no one's going to do that to read the New York Times. They're going to buy the New York Times. This is a legitimate question if you're a creator. And look, all four of us are creators. We write, we publish, we do work that is creative work. So I understand creators' discomfort.\n\n28:44\n\nI guess the fundamental question there's a couple, but one question is is there a? Because all the copyright and patents all about society's benefit, the benefits of it exclusively, but ultimately it becomes part of the public's property and everybody can use it. That's why there's terms on copyrights and patents. And until that law, by the way, until that was established, creators felt like they owned it forever. So it really was attempt to limit the power of creators, to control their inventions, so that society ultimately could benefit. I think now, and this is the fundamental question, does society benefit from AI ingesting this content? And then there's also the question is an AI reading the New York Times any different from the human reading in New York Times? Some say yes, some say no. So those are, these are fundamental questions, I guess as a society we have to answer. Denise, you're an attorney. Does the law speak to this at?\n\n29:51 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nall Pieces of the law speak to pieces of this, and that's what's making this all really interesting right now and trying to, you know, sort of shoehorn current reality into our existing legal framework and and see how it goes. I think it's just really interesting and I'm not sure that there's a one-to-one match. In all cases, you have an article in the rundown that I thought was fascinating about Vonna.\n\n30:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, let me. Let me take a little break, cause that's a good good place to pause, and we'll talk about that. I also want to talk a little bit about my experience in chess, because it was more than 20 years ago now that computer beat the best player in the world. Computers have widely, for two decades now, been agreed that computers are better than humans. At chess Go, something similar has happened, but I want to talk about something surprising that's happened in both games.\n\n30:44\n\nI must say we're lucky to have a very wise and tech-savvy Supreme Court which will clear this all up for us, oh Lord Well you know, that's a whole other topic, not just the US Supreme Court, but can courts and legislatures in general do a good job of this? And I think really it's societal moress. Ultimately they have to reflect. We have to decide as a society and then the laws and the jurisprudence will reflect that, but we haven't even decided as a society what we think about this, and that's really what this conversation is for us and our audiences, and you all are informed technology users. There's no agreement, even among our panelists, about this, but we need to come to some consensus before we can expect the law and jurisprudence to reflect that. So this is part of the conversation that has to happen. It's a good conversation. Denise Howell is here. Her new podcast is at hearsayculturecom. How's that going?\n\n31:44 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYes, it's going well. The last time I was here our feeds were not fully functional. Now all our shows have their own feed, yahoo, yahoo, I have two shows up on my solo show, which is called Uneven Distribution, and more in the pipeline that are coming out in the next month or so.

It's Vanna.\n\n35:53 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nV-A-N-a. What is vanna? Well, it looks like an interesting sort of as jock would say, vrm play uh, where users are recognizing hey, our data is our own and we want to manage it and we want to get compensated for it and we want to decide who's using it and how. It's pretty timely.\n\n36:09 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWhen Reddit IPO'd, they let us know that Google had paid them I think it was $60 million for access to all the Reddit data. What is the Reddit data? Our posts? There is no data from Reddit. It's all the people posting around, just like twitter and facebook and everywhere else, uh. So I think there were some people who said, gee, you know, uh, why should reddit make 60 million? So vanna is gonna is well, in theory, we'll see wants to let you take your reddit data and rent it out to train ai and you get paid. Is this viable, I wonder?\n\n36:48 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nthe. The problem I always see is that um like the actual value per user of that data is so minimal. Yeah, here's your 32 cents right it's, you know, it's kind of like, you know, like spotify royalties for most musicians, unfortunately, or, like you know, it's not not worth the cost of cutting the check. Basically now.\n\n37:12 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI guess google already has your data, but there are plenty of other people who would like to use, uh, that data who don't have deals with reddit, so you could make them individual deals, and I would guess what vanna wants to do. By the way, they've raised a lot of money. What I would guess Vanna wants to do is aggregate a bunch of people's data right, and then offer it as a bundle to Hugging Face or whoever you know, or OpenAI, and then distribute it out.\n\n37:41 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI mean the. You know the value of Reddit is real. If you do a Google search, often one of the auto-suggests will be to add the keyword Reddit to your search. In other words, people have figured out that the general web search results, Google returns, are junk. What you want is the Reddit discussion about that topic, and that will get you the real answer.\n\n38:04 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI have to say I don't think Vanna is really viable for that very reason, but I do think it's important to recognize that there is that Reddit's making money on our data, as is Twitter.\n\n38:16 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nFor what reason? The money reason, the 32 cent reason?\n\n38:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, it's just too small.\n\n38:20 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah.\n\n38:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah.\n\n38:22 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI just know, I don't know. I just I feel like this is looking at something that's going to be more widespread and, yeah, it's not going to be a lot of money, but anything that can replicate and give users more control, I think is a good thing. Yeah.\n\n38:38 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nReddit banned the Vanna subreddit. That's funny.\n\n38:45 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nIt's also I want to push back a little, go ahead. I'm sorry. I want to push back a little bit on what Owen said about Reddit. Reddit has great information, but Reddit is made up of people and unlike us, I'd like to say unlike professional journalists they're just people. They're great people and they're average people and they're trolls and they're idiots and they're liars, and you know they're just. You have to take everything you read on Reddit with a grain of sand. Just like AI information right.\n\n39:12 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nIt's all hallucination and Wikipedia, you know, which is super valuable, but you have to.\n\n39:20 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nDid you? Yeah, that's right. I mean, humans are full of misinformation. Your neighbor, ask your neighbor of any variety of questions, and they will give you any variety of answers, and you would be prudent to suspect each answer, right, yeah, get you know, but you Critical thinking is so important. You made such a good point, though, larry, that we, we only know who won the election because we not because we went to the federal election database, right, but because we read the New York Times or watched CBS Evening News, right. We're trusting some other person to do that.\n\n39:57 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nAnd in the case of the 2020 election, there are places where you might go and get the wrong information that millions of people believe Right, and that's another aspect of this.\n\n40:07 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt does raise the question what is truth, what is reality?\n\n40:12 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nVirtual or real or artificial, you saw this Go ahead.\n\n40:16 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI think that is something that all of the AI developers are concerned with as well. Right, that we're trying to give you something that is reliable and that you can. Then we then that it relies on information itself that is reliable, and I don't know, it's a huge mountain to climb, but necessary and it changes.\n\n40:38 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nwe learned, as we learned during covet 19 what science says is accurate on day one may be questioned on day two, and you know that's just the nature of science as well.\n\n40:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHere's a challenging article from yesterday's Wall Street Journal how I built an AI-powered self-running propaganda machine for $105. Wow, the author, jack Brewster, calls it a pink slime site, which is I like the name. He says he has no expertise. What he did was he went to Fiverrcom, which is freelance developers hang out there a developer, I guess 105 to write a website that would automatically take articles from mainstream news outlets, rewrite them according to a specific political preference and publish them on the pink slime site. Within a few weeks, he said, I could even start earning programmatic ad revenue from my partisan AI content farm.\n\n41:45\n\nHe hired a guy with excellent ratings 5.0 rating of 293 reviews, paid him $80. A young Pakistani, he said he's around 30 years old. He communicated with him by instant message. The programmer said I'll create an automated news website, auto blog. If you're looking for an automated website to generate passive income without any effort, my gig is your best choice. Here's his. Here's his fiverr. By the way. If you're looking for somebody, here's his fiverr listing. He's an seo expert from there. Uh, all I had to do was answer a few questions about what kind of site I was looking for, the topics I wanted the site's articles to cover, the domain and site hosting added $25 to the total. That's where he got $105. Costs nothing to operate. It Runs itself automatically. Dozens of articles a day. In fact, this is one of 500 sites this developer has created.\n\n42:48 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nEach project takes him two or three days to complete he spent thousands of dollars on our web developer every year.\n\n42:57 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI mean 80 dollars, 80 dollars, uh. So the site he created, uh, which he doesn't put a link to uh specifically designed to support one political candidate against another in a real race for the US Senate. So he gave it a very specific focus and yet he's able to get a dozen or more articles a day for this pink slime site.\n\n43:28 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI mean he could, he could have done this as a documentary to the various people with various agendas that are just out there doing this, not to show that it can be done, but for whatever their agendas are. So I mean, I don't think any of us were surprised that this was possible or as easy as it was. It's it's you's good that he's writing about it and making more people aware.\n\n43:49 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHere's the prompt he wrote for the AI you have to write engaging news story of a minimum 300 words on the topic from a conservative perspective. Promote Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, if you can, and the site is called the Buckeye State Press. Sounds legit Buckeye State Press, I'd believe it. Ohio, bernie moreno, if you can, and the site is called the buckeye state press. Sounds legit buckeye state press, I'd believe it. Ohio, big, big senatorial campaign going on there. Um, here's a, here's a look at this. How, bernie? How is bernie moreno leading ohio's preparations for monday's total solar eclipse? Bernie moreno upholds ohio law and police cruiser window tint violations. How will conservative leader bernie moreno handle traffic during the april 8th solar eclipse?\n\n44:34 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nvery topical, very topical, wow, um what's amazing about this stuff is it's always been possible and this has always been done, but the fact that technology makes it cheaper and easier and anybody can do it today yeah, that's, that's the news story, really, the fact that he did this for next to nothing and to your point about critical thinking, if somebody's looking for traces of ai, it's not hard to find right.\n\n45:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nso this site isn't going to fool somebody who's looking for who knows what to look for? Yeah right, who knows what to look for? Yeah Right, who knows what to look for. For instance, in its version of an article, it took an article published from the Lorraine Morning Journal announcing awards for the state's top basketball players and rewrote them. In a stunning turn of events, senate candidate Bernie Moreno has emerged as a strong supporter of high school basketball in ohio. Particularly stunning turn of events. Now, if you I think if you were a relatively eyes open reader, you might go. Well, wait a minute, hold on. Not, I mean, look at my in-laws would go. Oh yeah, bernie, he's great he loves state high school basketball.\n\n45:53\n\nBuckeye State Press rewrote an article about a winning lottery ticket, taking it from a Fox affiliate TV affiliate in Cleveland, stating as the excitement of the Powerball jackpot continues to captivate the state, let us also remember the importance of supporting leaders like Bernie Moreno, who work tirelessly to ensure a bright future for Ohio. Go ahead.\n\n46:14 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nSo one interesting thing that comes to mind about this, and relates to what's going on with Google and its various link tax struggles, is there needs to be some vet of this kind of information that's out there. You know, what is Google going to make of this guy's sites? Is it going to link to them? Is it? Is it going to show up in search results for news? I doubt it.\n\n46:39 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI don't know what kinds of measures Google's goes through to ensure that Bernie and his love for basketball get demoted to low rankings by the way, jack brewster, in an effort show how easy this is to switch allegiance, then said rewrite all of this to support sherrod brown, bernie marino's opponent, and within, with a slight tweak to the prompt, the site began churning out pro brown articles. Yeah, um, I think this is. This is all, as you say. This is not new. This is only problematic in the volume and the ease with which, with which it could be and the cost it's become so affordable.\n\n47:22 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, I mean that's, that's that's part. I mean I love things being affordable, but it's scary to me that thinks that anybody with a couple of hundred dollars can create massive amounts of misinformation in ways that will convince some people. You know, the barrier to entry is just low these days.\n\n47:40 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAnd the thing is people are not going to go to a website like this and scour all the articles and look for patterns that give it away as AI. They're going to see one article in a social feed out of context. Right, that's right. I mean, I know part of my job is keeping up with, obviously, business news in the Bay Area. I do a Google News search on terms like San Francisco Bay Area, et cetera. In the Bay Area, I do a Google News search on terms like San Francisco Bay Area, et cetera, and there are definitely sites that show up in the Google News search that I have not heard of, that I would not source a story from and I can tell, because there are like five repeats, that there's some maybe syndication, maybe straight up copying going on. So you know, unfortunately Google News is not as trustworthy as I think it needs to be in terms of the sources it allows.\n\n48:35 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, I find my own articles sometimes plagiarized through Google News on sites that should not be ranked by Google News. I don't know how they got into Google News' database, but they're clearly plagiarizing.\n\n48:47 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah, it'd be fun to talk to somebody from Google about that, because I remember back in the day, the very early days of blogging, when it was very hard to get your site or your outlet included in Google News and it was a big victory when you could Right and now maybe not so much I'll have to reapply because I got turned down the first time I applied.\n\n49:10 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, well, we're heading towards. I'm going to take a break. We'll talk about this, the California Journalism Preservation Act. Our good friend Jeff Jarvis has written a really good piece about why this proposed link tax would not only not save journalism, it would be bad for journalism and bad for Google, and Google's response has been swift and, I think, a little terrifying. We're going to talk about that in just a moment. It's great to have Denise Howell here, hearsayculturecom, owen Thomas from the San Francisco business journal, my friend Larry Magid. Connecting safely, still connect safe. Is this full-time now for you?\n\n49:55 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, I do other things. I still write a weekly column for the Mercury news. But yeah, it's, it's a full-time job. It sounds like kind of almost a mission of love, like a personal mission as opposed to it is yeah, and it's just a great team of people and to be able to kind of watch technology evolve and watch the risk revolve and also the ways in which we are dealing with them. It's been really interesting. I do enjoy it.\n\n50:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHave you written about or talked about Jonathan Haidt's book?\n\n50:26 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI have not published anything yet, but I've certainly talked a lot about it with a lot of people, including some people who question some of his journalism and some of his research. I should say, you know, one of the things that Jonathan Haidt has done is he's seen a correlation between the rise of the smartphone and mental health issues. But, as anybody who's taken a sociology course knows, correlation is not the same as causation, so he's not factoring in all of the other things that may be contributing to mental health issues, nor is he factoring in, in my opinion, all of the wonderful things that happen as a result of technology and young people having access to phones and social media. So it's very nuanced. It's not something that you can easily, you know, create a soundbite to describe what goes on in terms of youth and risk and technology and unfortunately, I think he's got to boil down to a very simple soundbite and it's more complicated.\n\n51:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, we've talked about this quite a bit on previous shows. The book is the Anxious Generation how the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. And we also talked about Candace Oger's article in Nature. She's one of the researchers who says no, no, it's correlation, not causation. Exactly, it's correlation for sure. And Haidt has come on Twitter and has very strongly defended himself and saying no, no, we, we have plenty of studies that show causation. It's. It's so difficult.\n\n51:54\n\nYou know I was talking to my son the other day about you know he's a big fan of the Huberman podcast and you know Noel Yuval Harari's Sapiens. I think I gave him Sapiens and I said you should always be careful when you read something that makes a lot of sense and just seems so right, even more than you would normally vet it Because your natural disposition to go. That's got to be true. It just feels right and of course, it feels right that all this time these kids are staring at these little screens has to be bad for them. But I would say it requires even more proof.\n\n52:33 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nRight and it is bad for some people. Look, I like to think of it. When people say social media is like tobacco, I say it's more like chocolate. Nobody should consume too much chocolate. It's bad if you consume too much. Some people shouldn't consume chocolate at all because you know they may have a medical condition or something that would make that very dangerous. But most people can consume moderate amounts of chocolate and be relatively healthy. And I think that you can point to some edge cases of horrible things happening that you can link to social media and smartphones. But you can also point to millions and millions of cases where horrible things didn't happen and edge cases where wonderful things happen. So you know, yeah, there's probably some causation, but I think he oversimplifies the process based on my reading.\n\n53:15 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, he yeah, it's worth reading the back and forth on Twitter because Jonathan's really got a lot of points, but I think Candace Audra has points and it's hard to know exactly what's right. He says. Height says look, because one of the first things we've all pointed out is this is the moral panic that happened when books started being published, when radio came out, when TV came out. You and I, larry, grew up when rock and roll was causing our brains to rot, and it seems like every generation is upset about what the previous generations into is just another moral panic. And he says yeah, it's reasonable to say that, but on the other hand, sometimes things really are bad yeah, like the rise of teen smoking or gun violence, and they really, you know it's not moral panic. We should pay attention to them. And so that's the question Is this which is this?\n\n54:25 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nyou'll find my presentation on the history of technology, moral panics and it goes back to socrates worrying about the impact of writing on memory and, of course, screening the loom and the railway. You know, the railroads were going to create insanity because anybody who traveled at that speed was going to have a mental breakdown and probably attack people on the in the railway car. I mean, there's a lot of that. But on the other hand, you're absolutely right, we we didn't worry enough about smoking. I don't think we worry enough about gun violence, we didn't worry soon enough about automobiles being dangerous. We are now. So you know, yeah, there are things that are very dangerous and there are dangers of social media. It's not 100 percent safe, right, and I think chocolate's a good analogy.\n\n55:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think that's a very good. By the way, this is a great little slideshow. This is a talk that you give.\n\n55:05 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, it is. It's a talk I've given a couple times now I love this.\n\n55:09 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI've been looking for something like this so I could use on the show, because we talk about this all the time. Jeff Jarvis even has a little moral panic video that we play.\n\n55:21 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI did a podcast with Jeff Jarvis. It's a part of our Are we Doing Tech Right podcast and Jeff was great.\n\n55:25 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, he's really good. Yeah, video games are going to destroy our youth.\n\n55:30 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nAnd don't forget the Millennium Bug. What that's going to do to the world?\n\n55:32 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah right, and yet it's reasonable to say there are things that can't cause harm. And Haidt says this is one of them Right? I don't know.\n\n55:40 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah, I think I mean his big thing is, one of his big things are getting phones out of classrooms, and I just it strikes me as a really draconian solution there. There may be very good reasons why someone needs to use technology in a classroom. Why is the computer in front of them much different than the phone that they would otherwise be using, front of them, much different than the phone that they would otherwise be using? And, um, you know, I mean I just think there it maybe is a too much of a soundbite and too much of a okay, if we only do this, then we'll solve the problem, and I just don't think it's that easy.\n\n56:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's a complex problem. That's really the truth. Yeah, yeah, uh, let's take a little break. We'll come back with more.

I said I would talk a little bit about my own experience with AI and chess.\n\n01:00:08\n\nI remember when Deep Blue beat Kasparov, the world champion, there was a real tremor in the chess world. Everybody thought, oh, that's it, the game's over. And who's going to want to play when you know a machine could beat you? And instead of killing chess, it actually to some degree boosted it. There certainly is an issue with cheating. It's a widespread issue, especially online. When you're playing an online game, because it's hard to know whether the person you're playing against is using the help of a computer. But in head-to-head, in-person board competitions, it's fantastic. But in head-to-head in-person board competitions, it's fantastic.\n\n01:00:43\n\nI'm watching right now the candidates' matches going on to choose the next challenger to the World Chess Championship. So it's the strongest players. How many is it? Six, I think Eight of the strongest players playing each other head-to-head. It's really dramatic. It's very exciting.\n\n01:01:02\n\nThe commentators have access to computers and when they show the screen. I'll just show you real quickly. On YouTube you can watch the play by play when you're watching it on the screen. Let me go back in time a little bit here, see if I can. Well, I'm getting the wrong video. Youtube's been doing this to me a lot lately. There we go. I guess the game's going on right now. You can see there's this bar on the left, white is almost has a one game. The computer says Now the players don't know, the players don't know what's happening, but the computer knows. And then afterwards the players use the computers to do analysis, to look at what's happening. It's really cool. It's a really cool use.\n\n01:01:50\n\nSo the same thing happened in Go. Not so long ago AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, one of the top Go players in the world, and there was this tremor went through the Go world. Go is a Japanese game, actually frankly much more difficult to solve than chess, it turns out. Article in Scientific American this week the AI's victories in Go inspire better human play. Go had been a little stagnant.\n\n01:02:18\n\nApparently Go had been a little stagnant. Apparently People had kind of decided well, this is the best way to respond in a certain situation and seeing what the surprising, in many cases moves that the computer used kind of gave a nudge to Go, and players are now more innovative. They are coming. This is David Silver, a researcher at DeepMind. It's amazing to see that human players have adapted so quickly to incorporate these new discoveries into their own play. The results suggest humans will adapt and build upon the computer's discoveries to massively increase their potential. I think that's very encouraging that AI in at least these games is not driving players away, but exciting them and stimulating them and giving them new ways to play and exciting new ideas to think about.\n\n01:03:11 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight, and it sounds like it's almost serving a coaching function.\n\n01:03:15 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAbsolutely For the players who are diligent enough to go back and review their games and believe me, if you're not, you're not going to do well in the world. You know the best players are absolutely using computer coaching.\n\n01:03:28 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYou know, there's a history of this. I remember when it was presumed that the ability to communicate electronically would cut down on travel, and in fact the travel industry is busier than ever and has been on a steady increase, except during the pandemic. And so it's very often that we fear somehow technology is going to interfere with more analog experiences, you know, going out to dinner. There's so many examples I can think of that have not happened, and technology has actually correlated with better things happening than what was predicted, what was feared.\n\n01:04:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd also AI in these games anyway, isn't perfect. When you get to this level, at the highest possible level, sometimes the humans are better than the AI. Sometimes Not enough to beat the AI, but enough times that you don't accept the AI suggestion always as the best move. So again, it's another case of human-machine interaction that is actually beneficial to the humans, I think. Anyway, I said I would talk about that, so I bring that up from my own experience.\n\n01:04:32 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThere are times when I actually find chat GPT can do a better job than I do, coming up with a particular paragraph or two. I've yet to see it write an entire article that I think is better than what I could write. But I find elements of it where, yeah, I wish I had thought of that, I wish I had been that creative. So, you know, maybe it makes me better at what I do. Maybe I have to work harder to compete against it.\n\n01:04:55 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAnd we are professional creators and communicators and you know a lot of people are not that good at writing say an apology letter to their spouse.\n\n01:05:06 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI'm not good at that either. Oh boy, how about an apology song? But no.\n\n01:05:13 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI didn't mean to interrupt your point, no, no, no, it's just that it's like you know, like most of us are not songwriters, but you know, if you really want to say like I'm sorry, have AI write your spouse a song.\n\n01:05:26 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYou know in that, in that presentation that Leo was showing you that I did about moral panics, all of the graphics were created using using generative AI and I couldn't draw a stick figure, if you know, if my life depended on it. So that was an example where I did use AI to enhance a creative product in a way that made it a lot better.\n\n01:05:45 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nWould you have hired an illustrator? Otherwise no, I would have had sucky images.\n\n01:05:50 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI would have had nothing. I would have grabbed things off the Internet I'm not sure what.\n\n01:05:53 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nYeah, I mean I am concerned about. There are professional illustrators who… Right, that's the downside.\n\n01:05:56 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYeah, professional illustrators who Right, that's the downside, yeah.\n\n01:06:00 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nWired Magazine, for example, said that they would not use AI-generated images because they are in the business of creating not just words but images for their covers, for their stories. And they said, no, we are going to pay humans, as we have done, unless it is a story specifically about AI artistic output and what that looks like, and you need to actually show the thing that you're talking about.\n\n01:06:29 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nSome of the images that I left in the presentation actually are absurdly inaccurate, and I did that to point out that they do make a lot of mistakes. And what was there as an image of Donald Trump? And he had six fingers in his hand.\n\n01:06:42 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nOh, fingers are. Fingers are like an infamous AI tell, and I'm weird, they're getting better.\n\n01:06:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nby the way, as soon as that became an issue, the stable diffusion and others started training on hands and they've got mid journey and stable diffusion Now. You're rare to see a bad hand.\n\n01:07:00 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nThat's almost a sign of previous generations it is interesting to to think about, like how, as humans, did we learn to recognize hands. By the way, humans are famously bad at drawing hands. Like it's hard, I can't have to teach.\n\n01:07:15 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYou know, mickey mouse has three freaking fingers oh, I really think that we're in this stage too. I mean, I'm we all remember when using a calculator or using a spell checker or a grammar checker was, you know, cause for hand ringing and and possible accusations of cheating. And now I think it's come full circle.\n\n01:07:39 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nAnd if you don't grammar check your english paper before you turn it in, your teacher should lean into more like where we should put more of our efforts as a you know, as a technology industry into is you know what are the, what are the assistive technologies? If you think about, you know, an accountant having a calculator by her side doing numbers very quickly, like, can AI be like that, something we have by our side helping us, not replacing us?\n\n01:08:25 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nNo, I agree with you. What bothers me a little bit is both Microsoft Word and all the Google products will offer to write it for you, and that actually does concern me, the idea that they would buy almost by default, saying no, larry, you don't have to write this letter, we'll write it for you.\n\n01:08:39 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nBut this is not aimed at you as a writer. This is aimed at business professionals who aren't writers and who want to communicate something Because this is a business product really and maybe don't feel competent to create it or just want the assistance of the AI to write it. They may rewrite what the AI writes.\n\n01:09:00 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI think this is very popular among business folks because sometimes I'm on my phone and you know, if the choice is, like swipe, to complete it with Gmail, I always let Gmail complete it. Right.\n\n01:09:14 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nThe one thing that causes me concern about that in the business setting is people don't get as adequately trained as they used to right. They can just punt on on being able to do it themselves and let AI do it, and and that's, that's not great.\n\n01:09:30 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, but uh, spell checkers has created a generation of kids who can't spell right Does your son spell.\n\n01:09:37 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWell, I'm not in that generation. I forgot.\n\n01:09:39 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, my daughter, I'm a great speller, my mother's a great speller my daughter can't spell to save her life because she never had to, she just didn't yeah.\n\n01:09:50 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI mean he's not as bad as he used to be and he's got a vast vocabulary and he's a good writer.\n\n01:09:59 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, yeah, exactly. He knows how to write he vocabulary and is a good writer. Yeah, yeah, exactly, he knows how to write, he just doesn't know how to spell right.\n\n01:10:04 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI can't drive a wagon and I suppose you know, 200 years ago I would have had to if I wanted to get somewhere yeah, were any of you the kind of kid who you know would would know.\n\n01:10:16 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nKnow how to spell a word, but not how to pronounce it, oh yeah absolutely, I still am sometimes, yeah, spell a word, but not how to pronounce it. Oh yeah, absolutely. I still am. Sometimes, yeah, because you only read it in a book that's right Now. Now, of course, you can just find a YouTube video with the pronunciation of any word imaginable.\n\n01:10:30 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nAs a radio person, I have to do that often because there's a lot of names I can't pronounce.\n\n01:10:34 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nit just based on reading them how do we, how do we bottle that secret sauce that we all trust those youtube videos, and they're pretty dead on, you know what means that they have to be accurate, but they are um, yeah, there's some, um some really good youtube pronunciation videos out there.\n\n01:10:56 - Pronounce!\n\nLet me just uh, I think let's see here this is how to pronounce youtube, looking at how to pronounce the name of our favorite social media platform. We'll be looking at how to say more brand names that too many mispronounce as well, so make sure to stay tuned to the channel Sounds like AI.\n\n01:11:15\n\nSo how do you say it? Well, there are at least two different ways of pronouncing it. Being owned by Google and started in the US, you could argue that it should be said the American English way, which is as YouTube, u-tube. So note the T sound here and the Tube sound YouTube.\n\n01:11:39 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI love that there's an alternate. I can't wait.\n\n01:11:48 - Pronounce!\n\nIt is often said as YouTube Tube. Yeah, youtube YouTube British English.\n\n01:11:54 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYou know what drives me crazy about that video? It's so typical.\n\n01:11:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHow do you pronounce Google? Wait a minute, let's see, oh God.\n\n01:12:02 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nGoogle. Google.\n\n01:12:04 - Pronounce!\n\nGoogle, google, google, the most famous and the most popular of all search engines in the world. We are looking at how to pronounce Google, google, google, google. Here are many more videos on how Google Google. Here are many more videos Okay.\n\n01:12:26 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWhat drives me crazy about these YouTube videos, this one included, is how long it took them to give you a three second answer.\n\n01:12:32 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nOh, I know, I know, is it something about?\n\n01:12:34 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nkeeping you a mile longer.\n\n01:12:36 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI don't know what it is, is but that's. But that's what happens when um you reward uh stuff, um, for you know, like more ads if it's longer right drives me nuts.\n\n01:12:50 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nwhen I, when I when I want information, I'm hoping I can read it, but google always sends me to youtube and then you start out with the with the you know the bumper, and then the guy has to say what's up, and then they take forever to tell you it. Then they have to pitch you on subscribing, and this is information that could probably have been translated in 20 words in a written text.\n\n01:13:10 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nLet me just see here. This is how you pronounce the names of famous actors oh yes, Archie Kidkicker Pitch perfect cup song. Archie Kidk Song Archie Archie Kid, georg Clowney. Georg. Clowney. Georg Clowney. This is one of my favorite YouTube channels. It's pronunciation manual Lipodio. Oh my.\n\n01:13:52 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nGod, you know, siri, no joking. Does this all the time to me? Oh yeah.\n\n01:13:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt probably watches this YouTube video All the time to me.\n\n01:14:03 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nOh yeah, it probably watches this YouTube video.\n\n01:14:08 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI've got yoga in my calendar and Siri tells me time to leave for Vinayasa NDS Radio. In the day used to have people on staff who were experts at pronouncing things. I could call them up and they would know how to pronounce any word or any language. That's a great job.\n\n01:14:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIs that like their full-time job, or that's just their?\n\n01:14:22 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\ngood. I don't know it wasn't the full-time job, but there was always somebody on staff that knew how to pronounce.\n\n01:14:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's like the AP style manual. It should be a you know, cbs pronunciation manual. Exactly.\n\n01:14:33 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYou've hit on something so cool there, and that is that technology gives birth to forms of humor that didn't previously exist, that youtube channel being a wonderful example. I think there's a lot more opportunities and outlets for satire nowadays than there used to be just because it's so easy to publish.\n\n01:14:55 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nPrior to youtube, that code wouldn't even exist, right? You're not gonna put that on cbs, right? Um, there's, yeah, and I think that that's a problem with it's kind of what you raised, larry, with jonathan heights, there's there stuff is that there's also this huge benefit you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater and in fact, I would submit and certainly jeff jarvis does that the benefit outweighs the negatives. We can find solutions for the negatives, but the benefits are amazing. You know, one of the reasons we've talked a lot about podcasts struggling, but one of the reasons they're struggling is because there are so many of them, yeah, which?\n\n01:15:30\n\nis good right you have. You know, when I started, you know we were one of the first 10 podcasts in the world back in 2005, 2004, uh, so there weren't a lot of choices, so we got a lot of listeners. But as time goes by, the first 10 podcasts in the world back in 2005, 2004. So there weren't a lot of choices, so we got a lot of listeners. But as time goes by, there are literally millions of podcasts. There's guaranteed at least one show. That's just right for you, and it may not be ours, and that's fine, that's just. But you know, I would love it if there were only 10 podcasts in the world and I would have one tenth of the audience, of the total audience. But it's not, and that's good, that's in the long run.\n\n01:16:07 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThere was a time when there were 10 podcasts and you probably didn't have any audience at that point. I mean, you know, the fact is that the audience is big and it's it's probably bigger, but well, the pie is expanding faster.\n\n01:16:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThe slices are getting smaller. Right, right, right right, regardless. You know we had more in the earliest days, in the first year of Twit. We would average a quarter million listeners. We're about half that. We're about half that. Interesting, but I'm not happy with the numbers we have now, given that there are almost an infinite number of podcasts you could listen to, I'm very grateful for those of you who listen to this one.\n\n01:16:43 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nBut what I? When I pointed out there was a time when there were no podcasts and there were zero.\n\n01:16:46 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI agree yeah.\n\n01:16:47 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThe only choice you had was terrestrial radio. Basically, right, you want to listen? Yeah, no, and I have.\n\n01:16:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd as somebody like you who broadcast on terrestrial radio for years, I've I value the fact that there was nowhere else you could go. In fact, am radio got hurt because in a big city like San Francisco there were 70 stations and only five of them made money. Everybody else lost money. And I happen to be lucky enough to work for one of the ones that was made One of the big ones, KCBS. I was on KGO and KSFO.\n\n01:17:16 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nOf the first 10 podcasts, how many were about tech? All, of them All of them, it was Adam Curry.\n\n01:17:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nDaily. Source. Actually that's not true. Remember Don and Drew, the couple that lived in the Minnesota farmhouse, somewhere farmhouse, and they would talk about their lives. That was a very early show that did very well, but most of them were about tech.\n\n01:17:35 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah, that was back at the time, too, when you had the most followers on then Twitter.\n\n01:17:39 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, yeah, that's a good example, because in 2007, I think, kevin rose and I were in a battle for the most followers on twitter. I had 5 000 and we were going back and forth and then and this is when everything changed ashton kutcher showed up and he went to like a million, and then it was a fight between him and CNN for the most, and Kevin and I were in the distant dust.\n\n01:18:09 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nUsed to be that if you Googled Larry, I would come out on top Very brief time and then the page came around.\n\n01:18:19 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nNo, I was the top Google result for denise for many, many years. Wow, yeah, but long, long ago, folks, you are you are listening to internet royalty there, you go royalty, royalty was that?\n\n01:18:33 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nwhat is that? Is that? Am I on top? That's 32 000 followers. That's pretty good. I, by the way, I thank all my however many followers who actually bought a blue check, because I am now once again, without paying a single penny and without participating in Twitter at all, a blue check. Elon has brought back the blue checks for people who have.\n\n01:18:57 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nHow do you get that? Do you have so many followers?\n\n01:19:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, this started this last week. 2,500 paid followers will get you Twitter premium, and then 5,000 paid followers will get you Twitter premium plus. I'm proud to say.\n\n01:19:12 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nBut unpaid followers won't Most of my followers, I'm sure they get you nothing.\n\n01:19:17 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nOh, I see. So it's all about how many of your followers have bought the blue check Wow.\n\n01:19:23 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI have four hundred ninety two thousand followers on Twitter, I'm sure, 90 percent of which are bots, but but enough. Actually used to be five hundred fifty thousand, so I think there's either people noticed. I'm not here anymore. Look at this. I've deleted all my tweets. I'm not here anymore. Look, look at this.\n\n01:19:42 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nI've deleted all my tweets. Wow, it's funny, I almost. I almost wonder, like whether having a blue check is a is a good thing or a bad thing.\n\n01:19:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI mean, well, okay, that's another development. So early on when he gave last week, when he started giving people, uh, checks, a lot of people Molly White and others said, no, I don't want to check. You know, it's a mark of the mark of Satan. And then they would tweet things like I didn't pay for this, honest. And so in this map, I think on Wednesday or Tuesday maybe it was on Tuesday one of our hosts was showing me how to turn off the blue check so you can go into your account settings and turn off the blue check. But, as it turns out, elon didn't want you to do that, so he's taking that feature out.\n\n01:20:29 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nyou can, oh wow you can no longer turn off the blue check but he's, he's so completely devalued and the you know the blue check check in his kind of Well, he's trying to revalue it, isn't he Right?\n\n01:20:45\n\nI mean, I guess, but how do you distinguish between someone who has paid for their check versus someone who has a certain number of followers who have paid for their check? Right, and what is the honor of having 2,500 people who pay for their blue check following you? Why is that notable? I mean, at least I get from a financial perspective. At least that's more aligned than let's just verify journalists or let's just verify politicians or let's just verify politicians. But you know, I think it's still very hard to convince X users that a blue check means anything anymore.\n\n01:21:28 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nBut what it used to mean actually was simply that you are who you say you are, that you really are Leo Laporte, not somebody claiming to be Leo Laporte. Right. And that's really what. That was the only original meaning of it, but it kind of became a status symbol after a while.\n\n01:21:43 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight, and that's what Facebook and Instagram still operates in that ecosystem Right.\n\n01:21:50 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI wonder if what X has done has devalued the Instagram blue check. Are people less trusting of blue checks elsewhere because of?\n\n01:21:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nyou know Instagram's blue check is expensive. Do you have a blue check, do you?\n\n01:22:02 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nhave to pay check to pay for it. Oh yeah, I have one on facebook that I didn't pay for. It just happened, I assume. I think that's the original idea, right, is that?\n\n01:22:10 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nwe have independently verified that this person is who they say they are. That's the real value of it. Anything, anything other than that?\n\n01:22:18 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nit's certainly and I have to say having had a blue check on Twitter and having a blue check on Facebook has not in any way improved my life. It doesn't mean anything at the end of the day. No Other than you can't harder to impersonate you, Although people still do impersonate people.\n\n01:22:34 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYes, I think that's a big benefit. Well, you could pay $8 to impersonate somebody. That's the funny thing.\n\n01:22:40 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThat's the funny thing.\n\n01:22:41 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThey should check your ID. They don't. No, they don't. Anybody can be anybody. Let's take a break and then we come back. I do want to talk about the California Journalism Protection Act, which is going to do anything but, and Google's response, which is somewhat draconian. Larry Magid, denise Howell, owen Thomas, great to have you, great to have all you listening Our show today, brought to you by ExpressVPN, the only VPN I recommend, the only VPN I use.\n\n01:23:14\n\nIf you ever read the fine print Google just lost a big lawsuit over this that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode. It says, right there, your activity might still be visible to your employer, your school, your Internet service provider. Incognito mode is anything but and Google admits it To really stop people from seeing the sites you visit. You need to do what I do. You need to use ExpressVPN. Seeing the sites you visit. You need to do what I do. You need to use ExpressVPN.\n\n01:23:44\n\nThink about the times you've used public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, at work, at an airport. Terrifies me. With that ExpressVPN, every site you visit could be logged by the admin of that network, even in incognito mode. That does nothing. Do you really want anybody anywhere to see what you've been looking at. It also exposes you to security risks. If there's a bad guy in that same network, there's all sorts of things they can do. What's more, your home internet provider, at all times, can see and record your browsing data, and in the US they're legally allowed to sell that data at advertisers. That's a big profit center for all the big ISPs. That's why, at home, at work, on the road, at the airport, at the coffee shop, you need ExpressVPN.\n\n01:24:32\n\nExpressvpn encrypts all of your network data, reroutes it through a network of secure servers so that your private online activity stays just that private. There's an app for all your devices, even things like smart TVs. They sell routers, but it'll go on many other routers. It goes on Windows, mac, linux. It works on iOS. It works on Android. The app is great. It has a big button Turn it on. You tap to connect and your browsing activity is secure from prying eyes. It comes up for me all the time when I'm at airports especially. I'm always very nervous. Always turn on ExpressVPN.\n\n01:25:02\n\nWhen we were in Mexico, I used ExpressVPN to watch TV in the US because I couldn't watch it in Mexico. There's just a lot of reasons why it's a good thing to have. Just have it on your device. You'll be glad. Stop letting strangers invade your online privacy. Improve your security. Avoid geographic restrictions.\n\n01:25:18\n\nProtect yourself at expressvpncom slash twit. Expressvpncom slash twit. If you use that link, you'll get three extra months free. With a one-year package it brings the price down below $7 a month. It's very affordable and well worth it. Expressvpncom slash twit. Expressvpncom slash twit. We thank them so much for their support.\n\n01:25:44\n\nSomebody is uh telling me that in fact, I didn't know this. Uh, when you sign up for a paid account, twitter asks you for id. So, uh, I I mean it's good. If you say you're mclo, I'm sure you are McLovin. Who else would you be Right? I have seen lots of complaints on Twitter about the really draconian captures that Twitter uses, and you have to do dozens of them. It seems well, at least, at the very least, annoying.\n\n01:26:20\n\nLet's talk about the California Journalism Protection Act. Google has decided this is kind of a shot across the bow, right, considering the cjpa, which would create a link tax that would require google to negotiate a fee to sites that it shows snippets for in its search results. Um, google says and this is in the keyword blog we've long said this is the wrong approach to supporting journalism. If passed, here's the shot across the bow. Cgp, cjpa, may result in significant changes to the services we can offer California and the traffic we can provide to California publishers. They are just to demonstrate right now, for a limited number of users, no longer sending those users when they search for news to those sites. Sending those users when they search for news to those sites which they did this in. Where is it? Spain? I think they did it in France and it's always been very effective. Now you have a site that probably benefits from Google's search traffic, owen, but also probably would love some revenue from Google. Where?\n\n01:27:47 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\ndo you come down on the CJPA? I think in this case I really can't speak for the San Francisco Business Times or our parent company, because those decisions are made like way up above my head. But I will say this is kind of the playbook that Google and Meta have used in Australia, canada, spain, other jurisdictions where there's been some proposal for a link tax, and it has usually led to publishers backing down. I also question whether you know and again not speaking, not speaking for myself or my own, you know, like my own personal interests here, but I question how important news content is to Google's business.\n\n01:28:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, we know Facebook was happy to turn it off. They don't care.\n\n01:28:39 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nYeah, I mean, you know what Facebook has said and they've played this out in newer products like Threads is that you know like, hey, political content is a turnoff. It generates division, like people just want to relax, hear from their friends. You know, have a good time, see pretty photos, and I kind of get that. You know Google has even talked about a real phenomenon, which is that a lot of people, especially younger users, have kind of news fatigue. Where they are, you know, like the news is a bummer and you know again, especially political news.\n\n01:29:17\n\nI think business publications like the Business Times might be in a different situation, because we're serving readers who have an active need for the information we're giving them, and because we are paywalled and people are generally subscribing to us and seeking us out, maybe visiting us directly. A publication like that might, in theory, be less affected. But you know, I think it's. I think there are serious questions about the future of news and how it gets funded. I'm not sure that. I'm not sure that Google really serves itself in the long run by threatening to not serve readers search results that those readers want.\n\n01:30:07 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nThat seems like a pretty strange and self-defeating response. So can I get into the nitty gritty here, the details? I haven't read the proposed act yet but, leo, maybe you know just from the coverage. Are they you said something about snippets? Um, are they? You said something about snippets? So is that the issue that portions of the articles are being shown and might discourage people from clicking through and actually going to the site if they're just using headlines? Is that a better uh solution here? Sorry, leo, you were up. Did you even hear me? No, I'm not sure he did.\n\n01:30:54 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nGoogle says and I credit them a little bit when they say this it was certainly the case in Australia, where it was Rupert Murdo and hedge funds who've been lobbying for this bill and could use funds from the cgapa to continue to buy up local california newspapers, strip them of journalists and create more ghost papers that operate with a skeleton crew to produce only low cost and often low quality content. They say this is a grab by the already successful rich publishers. It's not to support journalism, it's to support them.\n\n01:31:24 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nYou know, as a not rich publisher, I'm very grateful to Google. Driving traffic to either it's my site or if I write. For a while there was writing for Forbes and you know where I got paid based on traffic and a lot of my traffic came from Google and I appreciated it. I'm not sure I followed. Maybe that, maybe, Leo, you just gave the explanation why these conglomerates are so opposed to this, but to me it's free advertising.\n\n01:31:51 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNow, you would think that Google and this is Google's point we drive more traffic. Watch when we turn off the spigot, see how you feel.\n\n01:31:58 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nRight, that's right, that's why I'm always excited when my stuff comes up high on google news, right?\n\n01:32:02 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nyou know I love it and I, you know, I, I don't. And this is why I'm asking you guys, because, look, I don't. If they did it a podcast, I might have a different point of view, but I don't think the snippets that they publish are sufficient to keep people from visiting the site, or are they?\n\n01:32:17 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nand on the snippet. I mean, if it's, if you're looking for just a headline who won the election, and that's all you care about.\n\n01:32:22 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYou don't need more and you probably wouldn't visit the site anyway, right, you wouldn't do it.\n\n01:32:30 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nBut if you care about why they won the election, you're going to want to read on. Industry should be worrying about. Isn't it more like the wholesale usage of articles by AI models where there is no intent of ever sending you to the website? You know? Google, at least, is trying to send you to a publisher's website.\n\n01:32:52 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI don't like that either. I mean, the New York Times is suing OpenAI for that. So you're right, that's another cause for concern. But I'm sure they're able to be concerned about two things.\n\n01:33:01 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nWell, the other, the other issue there's a lot of free stuff out there, and if all you want is a shallow, you know, kind of rendition of the news from a site you might or might not be able to trust, you're going to find it anyway. I mean, certainly, if you look at CNN's free, I think we'll continue to be free. There's a lot of which is a legitimate site, but there's a lot of stuff there that you can get anyway, and I think that if these big sites start basically getting blocked from Google, it's going to hurt them in the long run.\n\n01:33:30 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nRight, and look, I think people know by now I am not a huge fan of Google anymore. I think Google has become well and shitified. Frankly, they're going for the profit at the cost of users. In fact, there was a new study just came out from researchers at Leipzig University. They asked the question is Google getting worse? We've all kind of anecdotally I think experienced this. You know the Google search results are worse than they used to be. They examined 7,392 product review queries on Google, bing and DuckDuckGo and they did it over a year. The research showed spam sites are hyper-prevalent showing up at the. So Google's not doing a good job of blocking spam showing up at the top of google rankings in what is quote, a constant battle end quote between the sites and search engines. In other words, they write search engines seem to be losing the cat and mouse game that is seo spam.\n\n01:34:36\n\nUm, I also just think when you go to a Google search, I don't use Google anymore. I use a page search site called Kagi K-A-G-I. That is um Harry McCracken. My friend uh recommended this uh and uh. I've been using it and it's not. I think it's 10 bucks a month but there's no ads. And so you know if you search for um tennis shoes on Google A lot of ads.\n\n01:35:02\n\nA lot of sponsored hits. That's an ad. That's a Nike ad, I think Dick's Sporting Goods. The organic search results are well below the fold. Yep Right.\n\n01:35:14 - Larry Magid (Guest)\n\nThat's also true on Amazon. If I'm looking for a particular product at Amazon, I've got to hunt through all of these would-be products that are trying to capitalize on that product name to find the one that I actually want to buy, in fact, at this point.\n\n01:35:26 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nGoogle's turned this into a shopping site. It's even got the Amazon style filter by department brand price. I mean, this is a shopping site.\n\n01:35:35\n\nGoogle's put together a shopping site. Now, maybe because I'm searching for tennis shoes, google reasonably says oh well, obviously you're in the market to buy tennis shoes. We should show you our Google crafted shopping site, I guess. Let me go to Kagi and do the same search. See what I get. Again, I pay for this, so there's no ads, but this is more what I would. This is like how Google search results used to be, in fact. I'm still getting a drink.\n\n01:36:02\n\nYeah, yeah, I'm still getting. Yes, this does not use Google at all. I'm still getting, by the way, nike and the dicks at the top based on page ranks. I'm getting some listicles, but I think I'm getting more organic search results here at this point. A lot of stores, this point, a lot of stores. Uh, some articles about tennis shoes are actually showing up. It isn't quite so clearly a shopping site. It's probably, uh, because it's tennis shoes that it's really looking this bad, but I don't know. I feel like google, am I wrong? Is google getting, not getting, not getting worse?\n\n01:36:39 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nWell, I answered my own question on the actual text of the proposed law.\n\n01:36:46 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh good, let's go back to that. Yes.\n\n01:36:48 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nAnd it doesn't distinguish between snippets or links.\n\n01:36:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThey're all included, See a link is not stealing any traffic at all.\n\n01:37:00 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight, it's not stealing any traffic at all, right, so it the text is uh, whether the platform links to, displays or presents an eligible digital journalism providers news articles, works of journalism, and if they do, then they're subject to the tax so that's clearly a grab, a money grab right, because a link doesn't in any way hurt you, it only helps you, and so they basically want Google to pay for the links to news.\n\n01:37:24 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nGoogle says only 2% of our search traffic is about news, by the way, and you know the eligible digital journalism provider that you know?\n\n01:37:33 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI wonder about that because there are a lot of upstart news that are filling in news deserts. Right, they're maybe small nonprofit newsrooms, former journalists you know journalists who formerly worked at a mainstream newspaper that cut jobs, starting starting their own publications. You know who is deciding who's?\n\n01:37:56 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nthere. There are tons and tons of definitions in this proposed law, and an eligible digital journalism provider is an eligible publisher or eligible broadcaster that discloses its ownership to the public. That seems weird, a weird definition.\n\n01:38:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's hedge funds, right. A weird definition. That's hedge funds, right. I really. I think Google is fairly credibly right that this is something written by hedge funds who want to use this as a way to jumpstart.\n\n01:38:30 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nI'm not sure.\n\n01:38:32 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nOkay, here we go. More definitions Qualifying publication. They're just trying to. They're trying to have a pretty broad definition here of who's going to get paid.\n\n01:38:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAs long as, as long as the people who wrote this, the lobbyists who wrote this, get included, they're probably happy.\n\n01:38:53 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nRight.\n\n01:38:53 - Owen Thomas (Guest)\n\nExactly Denise are there first amendment implications in having to disclose your ownership?\n\n01:39:02 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nI would say yeah, oh, that's interesting. Yeah, that's interesting and I think there are first amendment implications and chumley pointed this out in irc of the government telling google how to present its search results.\n\n01:39:14 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYou know that's arguably its it's commercial speech yeah, jeff jarvis wrote a uh, a um analysis of it, uh, which he had published on his medium blog. If you want to uh read it, uh, he was commissioned to write this. Uh, we should point out um by, let me see, if it says um was commissioned by the California Foundation for Commerce and Education, which is basically the California Chamber of Commerce. They did not exercise control over the content, although they did compensate Jeff to write this, but he wrote a very nice, I think, and it probably worth your time especially you, denise, as an attorney 41-page summary of what this is and why it's bad for journalism.\n\n01:40:02 - Denise Howell (Guest)\n\nYeah, we'll definitely read it yeah it's on his. If we go back to that 2% thing. That boggled me. Do you think it's? True. It's not true in my case, I mean I think I primarily use. Oh yeah, no. I primarily use it to find articles I can actually access that aren't be"
