        "text": "Note: Radius Targeting is currently only available for accounts in the US and Japan. To gain access to Radius Targeting, please reach out to your account manager.\n\nYour ads will show to all locations selected, even if they're from the same geography. For example, if you choose to target your campaign to the United States and California, your ads will show to everyone in the United States. If you want only to target individual regions, be sure to only add those regions as targeting criteria to your campaign.\n\nNote:Â Self-serve advertisers are limited to targeting users in countries where the X Ads product is available, and not all of the countries listed in the geo locations index. For a list of countries available for targeting, please seeÂ this article.\n\nXâs geo targeting is based on someoneâs recent location. This is a combination of current location and recent location history. X uses several signals - including IP address and GPS signal - for determining whether someone is in a particular geographic location. These signals inform sophisticated machine-learned models that predict a userâs location. More on XâsÂ data collection for ads.Â\n\nWhat if the location I'm trying to target isn't available?\n\nIf the location you enter does not populate, we recommend adding the closest region or area to target. Some countries do not have as granular targeting options (metro, postal code, region) available at this time.Â\n\nWhy am I seeing impressions served outside my geo location targeting?\n\nMake sure you didn't alter your campaign targeting post-launch. You can do this by clicking into your campaign and click the \"History\" tab. This will show the dates and times you made changes to your campaign. If you add geo location targeting post-launch, impressions would be served all over the world during that intial time of serve.\n\nAdditionally, you may notice that in some instances, the sum of all locations does not account for all of the campaign spend. This is due to the small attribution loss we experience when breaking out billing and targeting data. Please note that every ad impression has in fact served to your targeting specifications, but there is a 1-3% loss in the segmented spend data we display in the dashboard. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes.Â\n\nÂ\n\nGeo location, gender, language, and age targeting are all subtractive, or \"AND\", targeting types. This means thatall the parameters you set for these targeting types will be respected.\n\nFor example, if you choose United States + Males + 18 and up, your campaign impressions will only serve to males 18 + up who are in the United States. Even if you add on additional targeting, such as keyword or interest targeting, only 18 and up males in United States who also meet your keyword or interest targeting will be eligible to be served the ad.Â\n\nGeo location, gender, language, and age targeting all help you be precise in who you're serving ads to. However, because they're \"AND\" targeting types, each one you layer on decreases the audience size your campaign can serve to. It's important to make sure your other targeting types are sufficiently large enough so that your campaign doesn't struggle to serve to users.Â\n\nÂ\n\nYou can view your campaigns' audience breakdown by locations, keywords, handles, behaviors, gender, language, platform, and interests.\n\nFirst, click into a campaign and navigate to the \"Audience\" tab to view audience details. To export data at the audience level, click on the \"Export\" button on this page.\n\nNote: when viewing your campaign by age, language, geo location, and gender targeting, you will usually see a lower number of total impressions, engagements, or spend on the top-line campaign level than when you add up all of the individual ones listed below. This is because if a single person views your campaign and fits into multiple categories, their engagement and impression will be counted under both.Â\n\nFor example, if you target the age bucket 18 and up, your campaign will be served to users who fit into the age bucket 18 and up. However, the impression served to someone who fits in the 18 and up bucket might also fit into the 13 and up bucket. Their single impression will be reported in both the 18 and up and 13 and up rows.Â Your ads will not be served to people who don't have the targeted criteria you selected. You're only charged once, if the person makes the billable action and is within your targeting parameters.Â"
