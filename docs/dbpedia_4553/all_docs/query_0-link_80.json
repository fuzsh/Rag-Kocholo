        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nWaking up next to Charlie Spring was a delectable experience — that much Nick had become well acquainted with. Even more so, waking up next to Charlie Spring after finally getting to kiss him? That was an entirely incomparable acquaintance. It was like that scene in Ratatouille, when Remi has sampled the cheese and the strawberry separately and feels that he’s in heaven; but then he experiences the two of them together at once and is taken away to another, entirely unprecedented planet altogether.\n\nIt was almost achingly saccharine when Nick’s eyes fluttered open on their own accord Saturday morning, with no necessity for an alarm clock to rip him from one of the best sleeps of his life. His body just knew, without having to be told, that he wasn’t going to want to miss this, that he would want a moment alone to soak it all in during his favourite time of day. The sun was just scarcely breaching the horizon, smudging it that pale, dusty yellow that blends so naturally with the cool, blue-grey of January on the coast of England.\n\nA mere shard of light was lurking through the narrow crack of space left open between Charlie’s black out curtains, and when mixed with the soft, rotating colours of their diffuser-night light combo, it was enough lustre for Nick to be able to admire Charlie to his heart's content. This wasn’t a new experience, awakening with Charlie lying across his body, cheeks pink from sleep and plush lips faintly parted from the pressure of their face squished against Nick’s chest. What would be new was that when Charlie woke from their idle slumber, adorably groggy, and beautifully, beautifully near, Nick would be allowed to lean down and capture their nectarous lips in a kiss — because he could do that now.\n\nEvery time Nick closed his eyes, he could recall their first kiss with perfect clarity. It was as fresh as a photograph from an old film camera coming to life in a dark room. The memory of Charlie climbing onto his lap was so clear that Nick could almost assume he’d written the moment himself.\n\nNick toyed with that thought for some time while he watched Charlie’s back rise and fall with every deep, comatose breath that ended with an endearing whistle of air puffing through his pink lips. With the way Charlie’s head was angled, every billow of air danced over Nick’s collarbone and tickled down to the spew of auburn hairs at the top of his chest. The same hairs that the pads of Charlie’s fingers were resting on with the partially unfurled fist docked right over Nick’s heart. It was a simple syrup of circumstances, nothing but a basic touch and the heat of their feelings combining to make this a morning out of Nick’s most sought after dreams.\n\nNick’s eyes traced the cutting curve of Charlie’s cheek, the full arch of his brows, and the way his lashes fanned out against his skin. The soft, multicoloured light of the diffuser painted Charlie’s features in hues of lavender, teal, and rose, making him appear almost ethereal — not much unlike his typical state in Nick’s eyes.\n\nAt some point the sun had crossed the border of the horizon and fully disclosed itself to the morning sky. Around that same time, a hungered vibration stirred in Nick’s stomach that was sure to wake Charlie if Nick didn’t get to them first. He lifted his arm that wasn’t buried by the weight of Charlie and slid his hands through Charlie silken curls with deft fingers, cupping the back of their head while leaning down to press a tender kiss to their forehead. His lips hardly met skin, mostly the free-spirited locks of hair that commanded presence wherever Charlie went. There was the faintest hitch in Charlie’s breath before they crawled even closer to Nick, shifting until they were almost entirely planked on top of him. Nick couldn’t help but giggle; though they’d only woken up together a handful of times now, Nick knew better than to expect an immediate stirring from Charlie. The weight was as comforting as the body of another human could be, every point of contact brought with it a sweet, intimate air of peace that whisked Nick away to his own personal cloud nine.\n\n“Char,” Nick whispered. He stroked his hand up and down through Charlie’s hair, scratching his scalp lightly with every downward pass.\n\nCharlie groaned in response. It wasn’t petulant, moreso an adorable reluctance that let Nick know it was safe to continue — carefully — despite any protests.\n\n“Char, I’ve got to wake up or my stomach is going to blow, it’s beginning to sound like a volcano.” Nick kept his voice quiet and steady, wanting to ease Charlie into consciousness as best he could. In reality, Nick knew that he would stay like this forever. He would allow himself to waste away in this moment if it meant spending his last ticks of his clock under the soothing weight of Charlie, listening and feeling the steady thump of his heartbeat. Even with their chests pressed so firmly together, Nick could feel the tug of the invisible string linking their hearts. He traced the contours of Charlie’s body with his fingertips and watched as the string danced subtle movements in time with every motion like he was controlling a marionette.\n\n“But ’m cozy,” Charlie garbled. He lifted his head just barely to reposition it into the junction of Nick’s neck.\n\nNick smiled at the feeling, holding Charlie’s head still and revelling in the tickle of their lips brushing against the border of his auburn stubble under his jaw. Charlie must have sensed how pleased Nick was by the subtle movement, because in the next moment, he began to move his lips more intentionally. He kissed down the side of Nick’s neck to his shoulder and back again before settling on a space with coordinates marked between Nick’s throat and the corner of his jaw. When Charlie’s lips parted narrowly on their next move, Nick’s fingers contracted reflexively and resulted in a faint tug of the hair gripped between his fingers. Charlie hummed pleasantly and pulled back, eyes hooded with a melange of sleep and pining.\n\n“You’ve got my attention,” Charlie muttered before leaning in and catching Nick’s lips. The kiss was slower and felt far more intentional than the night before, like they were taking the time to learn one another in a way that felt inconsequential last night. Charlie kissed Nick with a purpose and rigour that Nick savoured almost desperately. Nick was already addicted to the taste of Charlie’s lips — from the perfect, velvet bow of their top lip to their incredibly soft and full bottom lip. Charlie’s hand ran up and over Nick’s chest, slipping behind his neck to pull him deeper into the kiss, a not so subtle demand for more. Their bodies pressed flush together under the light weight of Charlie’s linen duvet that had pooled down at their waists. Somewhere along the line, Nick had entirely forgotten that he had been hungry and that his goal in waking Charlie up had been to acquire breakfast. Now, another taste of Charlie was all that he craved. Nick wrapped his lips around Charlie’s like he was pulling the juice from the core of a peach, savouring every drop of sweetness extracted how one would delight in their final meal.\n\nThe kiss was slow and indulgent, packed with a devotedness that kept Nick’s heart pounding at a perilous pace. When the two finally pulled apart, their foreheads pressed together as their breath hung mingled in the space between their mouths. Nick’s eyes were half mast and a dazed smile fabricated on his kiss-swollen lips as he dropped his head back onto a feather pillow with a merry sigh. Charlie rolled off of Nick and onto his back, groaning contentedly as he stretched out his aching muscles still stiff with slumber.\n\nNick glanced over at Charlie, his heart swelling with affection just at the sight of him. The way his chest rose and fell with each breath, faintly laboured from the exertion of their kiss; the way his red and kiss-bitten lips pulled up in a gratified smile. It was all so perfect.\n\n“Perhaps mornings aren’t so terrible after all,” Charlie sang, turning back towards Nick while their fingers ghosted over the sliver of skin in between Nick’s sweats and the lifted hem of his vest.\n\n“I’ve tried to tell you as much,” Nick teased. He twisted over onto his side to face Charlie and nearly jumped out of his skin when the action caused Charlie’s hand to slip fully under his top and land on Nick’s bare waist. His hand was cool but the touch seared Nick’s skin. Nick’s breath hitched, his eyes widening at the unexpected contact and his expression a mix of surprise and delight.\n\nCharlie’s lips twisted into a vexatious smile. “You alright there?” They asked as they slowly moved their hand, fingers skating indiscernible patterns on Nick’s skin.\n\n“Yeah, just… yeah,” Nick admitted breathlessly as Charlie’s fingers continued on their tender exploration.\n\nHe took a moment to really consider the feeling of Charlie’s touch on his bare skin — how he’d never felt anything quite like it before and how the silent communication offered by such a simple touch was deafeningly loud. Every slow drag of their fingers was the swipe of a paintbrush over canvas, conveying a deep, artistic emotion that words could never capture. Touches before Charlie had been nice , they’d been exciting and at times even a little thrilling. But when Nick closed his eyes now, allowing himself to become fully immersed in the moment — in Charlie — he felt passion and creativity in their fingertips dragging over his hip that he’d only ever imagined in his wildest dreams. His mind drifted to times he had longed for this kind of connection, all the moments spent with a partner whose touch sparked more anxiety than desire. Knowing those days were behind him was an emotional anchor that allowed Nick to relish peacefully in this space with Charlie.\n\nWhen the two of them finally emerged from bed and lackadaisically made their way day the stairs, the furious rumbling of Nick’s stomach had returned in full force. He swiftly scarfed down a day-old muffin while he got the coffee machine up and running for Charlie and dug out the ingredients he needed to make them a pancake breakfast. The whole process felt so familiar, just existing like this in one another’s space in this casual and inseparable way that would lead any onlookers to believe they’d be doing so all their lives.\n\n“Question,” Charlie mused, resting his chin on the palm of his hand as he watched Nick prepare him yet another meal.\n\n“Answer,” Nick responded cheekily, never lifting his eyes from the stainless steel measuring cup in his hand as he scraped away a mound of excess flour back into its container to ensure a perfectly flat surface.\n\n“Will I ever be required to make food when I’m in your presence? It’s okay if I will be, it’s just that I’m beginning to get a little used to this whole private chef treatment and if you’re not careful I might start expecting it.” Charlie’s tone was teasing but Nick could see the faint flush under his skin that gave away his true feelings.\n\n“Honestly, unless I’m deathly ill, probably not. I like to do it.” Nick shrugged, and it was true, cooking and baking was his favourite way to show affection to those he cared for. Knowing about Charlie’s relationship with food made it all the more special; Charlie trusted him with a sensitive part of his life gave him an indescribable feeling of honour that only made him more pleased to carry on with the act.\n\n“Then who am I to deny you that simple pleasure? Especially when you look so good doing it.”\n\nNick flushed, nearly letting the egg in his palm slip between his fingers. The realisation that there was no reason for Charlie to beat around the bush with their flirting any longer got his skin buzzing. The wall between them had been beat down the night before and now nothing at all stood in the way of them shamelessly flirting in the comfort of Charlie’s home; there was no space left for guilt or questioning.\n\n“You’re so easy to fluster,” Charlie teased, chuckling as they sipped from their steaming mug of coffee.\n\n“I mean, can you blame me?” Nick sputtered, dropping a dollop of butter into the heated frying pan and swirling it around. The sputtering sizzle of the melted oils sounded reminiscent of the tingling taking place under Nick’s skin. He glanced over his shoulder, feeling his cheeks heat up under Charlie’s amused gaze.\n\n“And whatever do you mean by that?” Charlie smirked, setting down their mug of coffee and approaching Nick. They waited until he had poured the first round of pancake batter into the pan to spin Nick around with their hands on his hips.\n\n“I mean, well,” Nick sputtered, motioning vaguely toward Charlie with his free hand. “Just… look at you, you’re-” Nick cut himself off, gingerly shaking his head in disbelief and unable to find the right words to express the extremely potent effect Charlie constantly had on him.\n\n“I’m… what?” Charlie dug, looking up at Nick through his thick eyelashes, batting them slowly above his challenging stare.\n\nIt was a brilliant question, in all honesty. What was Charlie? Nick didn’t have the words, there really wasn’t any verbal way to elucidate the effect of Charlie’s presence on Nick. So — because he could do so now — he showed him instead.\n\nWith his hands on Charlie’s waist, Nick walked them back until they knocked into the kitchen island, wetting his lips with a swipe of his tongue before seizing their mouth in a bruising kiss. It was urgent and fast and hungry as Nick was fueled by everything he didn’t know how to profess. Charlie returned the feverous kiss with firm and insistent lips, demanding and giving in equal parts as Nick. Soon enough, Nick craved to be closer, to somehow manoeuvre himself even further into Charlie’s space despite the fact that a slip of paper wouldn’t fit between them right now. In a swift motion, Nick hoisted Charlie by the waist and set them down on the marble countertop, stepping into the newfound space and feeling Charlie’s legs curl around him. They fell into the newness together like they’d discovered the garden of Eden, pure and untouched — a paradise of sensation that was unravelling before their eyes with every new taction. Nick kissed Charlie like he’d never get a chance to voyage these grounds again, let Charlie kiss him like he was the first flower they’d ever seen come into bloom and the last one they’d ever have the chance to pick.\n\nNick commanded control with his body, pulling Charlie against him as though the counter beneath them didn’t exist to hold them up. His strong arms enveloped Charlie, drawing them closer and creating an unbreakable connection. There was no mistaking though that Charlie was in governing the kiss itself. With their hand anchored in Nick’s copper hair, they dictated the angle and the pressure, the pace and the depth of each kiss; Nick was powerless to do anything but go where Charlie took him. He let himself be taken from in a way he had never been allotted the freedom to enjoy with other partners. There was a thrilling liberation in surrendering control to someone in this way, in trusting Charlie to lead Nick wherever they desired. Nick revelled in it. He didn’t care if the quiet moans elicited by Charlie licking into his mouth came across as desperate, because the reality was that he was desperate for Charlie.\n\nSo desperate that his other senses had gone offline entirely, requiring Charlie to shove Nick away and turn him toward the pancake that had begun smoking on the burner behind him.\n\n“Oh fuck!” Nick scrambled to flip the pancake, groaning when it revealed a crisp, charcoal surface that smelt like the ashen remains of a fire pit. “I’ve never burnt a pancake in my life,” Nick complained, poking at the charred surface with the spatula and cracking open the blackened shell to reveal the dried out innards of the crumbly batter. “I’ve never burnt anything in my life!”\n\n“My bad.” Charlie smiled innocently. He slipped off the counter top and ran a hand through his tousled, black hair. He was a picture of innocence right then, and Nick marvelled at the way he was able to appear so casual after a kiss that had altered Nick’s own brain chemistry.\n\n“Can I help at all?” Charlie queried.\n\n“You can help by sitting there and looking pretty while you drink your coffee and not distracting me,” Nick mumbled. His heart was pumping so rapidly he was sure it would burst if Charlie stepped into his space again regardless of the action’s intent.\n\n“I thought me being here and looking pretty was the problem?” Charlie jested, with a chafing smile that left Nick feeling a pull towards jumping into a frigid pond in the dead of winter to cool himself down.\n\n“You’re going to be the death of me, Charlie Spring,” Nick groaned, pouring a new round of batter into the frying pan and keeping a diligent eye on it.\n\n___\n\nThey were lying on the couch together after Nick found success in his second round of pancakes, stomachs full from the breakfast and warm from the proximity of their bodies. The longing for Charlie to be as close as possible at all times consumed Nick, a thirsting, insatiable hunger that gnawed at the boundary of his every thought. Even when the thoughts were mild in their content, not so sinful as the ones that ravished his minds as they kissed, Nick’s entire body would rise in temperature until the glass of the thermometer cracked under the pressure. His body’s reaction to Charlie was so intense that even the gentle coo of them asking Nick if he fancied a cup of tea churned wildly in his stomach.\n\n“I would love a cup, thank you.” Nick grinned, though it quickly turned into a pout when Charlie lifted himself away from Nick’s embrace and sauntered off toward the kitchen. Nick stewed with that thought, the idea of missing someone who was still technically there. It was unnerving; the very concept that it was even viable to feel such a response when the person you’re missing is just round the corner and could be summoned at the drop of a hat. He toyed with the concept, kneading it between his palms and fleshing it out to make any sort of sense of it all before coming up short and resigning to just accept that Charlie currently existed at the centre of his universe.\n\nWhen Charlie returned a few minutes later, the two of them sat facing one another on the couch, knees bumping together while they idly chatted about anything and everything that came to mind. The domesticity that purred between them fluttered in Nick’s chest like fall leaves in the wind. Their conversation flowed readily, touching on past memories, future plans, and the small, mundane details of their unique day-to-day lives. Nick’s heart swelled with a delectation he hadn’t known he was capable of, he’d never experienced learning someone to this degree — or even wanting to. Nick relished the simple moments like this with Charlie, soaking up their laughter, rich and genuine, it was a melody that resonated deeply within Nick, it was a song he could only dream to have written. The benevolence of Charlie’s presence could not be any starker of a contrast to the fiercely cold air outside that had seemingly sunk its claws into January until the bitter end of the month. Nick set his mug down and used his now free hand to slide over and rest on top of Charlie’s. He ran his thumb lightly over the smooth ridges of Charlie’s knuckles as they finished the last drops of their own drink, thinking that nothing so sunny had ever happened in the month of January.\n\nWith their mugs empty and their stomach’s warmed once more, Charlie shifted backwards into the L-shaped corner of the couch and motioned for Nick to sit against his chest. Nick agreed, while threads of pink weaved through his freckles. Another act unfamiliar to him, being held by a partner who didn’t presume Nick to have a preference for holding . Despite the discrepancy in the size of their frames, Nick fit perfectly in Charlie’s arms, he slipped between their legs and rested his head back against Charlie’s shoulder while their arms crossed over Nick’s midsection. He revelled in it, being cared for in the way that Charlie offered simply yet insistently.\n\n“So,” Charlie started, pressing a chaste kiss to the side of Nick’s head. “I thought it would probably be wise of us to have a conversation since you’re heading back to London tomorrow.”\n\nNick could have never explained the plummeting feeling of his heart dropping into the pit of his stomach when Charlie’s words touched his ears. They’d come across so casually, like there wasn’t a crushing weight to them; the air became suffused with an invisible tension that pressed against Nick’s chest with the force of a dozen metric tons. He’d gone from the pinnacle of comfort to the nadir of alarm in a matter of seconds. It was clear to him that Charlie felt Nick’s body go stiff, because they hurriedly pulled him tighter against their chest and leaned down to press their cheek against Nick’s.\n\n“Darling, you’ve just gone so tense,” Charlie murmured, unhurried like dripping honey laced with sugary crystals of concern.\n\n“Sorry, I just…” Nick cleared his throat, hesitant about how truthful to be with his fear and unwilling to frighten Charlie off with the depth of his own emotions. He realised quickly that he had no idea how to express his fears clearly.\n\n“Are you expecting me to say something bad?”\n\n“I–” Nick started, biting his tongue again. “I don’t know…”\n\nHe really didn’t. Nick’s thoughts were tangled in knots of unease.\n\nHe actually hadn’t the faintest clue what Charlie was going to say to him and therein lies all of his insecurities. The unknown, the crossroads where staying or going were the only two options with perfectly equal chances of being selected had left Nick feeling deathly insecure.\n\n“Nick…let me rephrase,” Charlie started, running his hands soothingly up to Nick’s chest and holding them there over his pulsating heart. “I’d like to talk to you about our feelings for one another. How we’re going to navigate those while this is all very new, and while we’ll only be seeing each other sporadically. I also think it’s important to discuss since we are both in the public eye, especially with you just coming out and probably having extra attention on your dating life. I want to talk because I care about you, and about us.”\n\nNick felt part of the weight on his chest rise and be washed away by Charlie’s comforting words. He was still on edge; a natural discomfort with open and honest communication that came from years of unhealthy relational contact and a strict lack of boundaries on his part. It was all a little foreign to him, this idea that one could seek to speak about the state of a relationship in a positive way, with no ulterior motives or lust for power.\n\nThis was a good thing. Charlie is safe.\n\n“Right…okay, yeah that’s probably a good idea,” Nick muttered, slightly embarrassed and feeling like he was learning how to talk all over again — and he was, in a way.\n\nHe had to keep reminding himself that this was good, that despite the storm of thoughts swirling chaotically through his mind, dissecting all of the possible routes this talk could take, talking openly with the person you like is essential. Talking with a partner wasn’t synonymous with dread and anger and being scolded — at least, it didn’t have to be, not anymore.\n\n“I’m sorry for frightening you, darling. You don’t need to fear talking with me, I promise. I only want for us to be on the same page, does that sound okay?” Charlie’s question came with an exotic peace of mind for Nick. They meant it, they were genuine in their inquisition of Nick’s comfort and were he to say no, that he was not okay, Charlie would cease action until he was.\n\nNick nodded warily, feeling a little foolish about the way he needed such comforting. Charlie didn’t appear bothered in the slightest though, even with their head positioned behind Nick, he could feel their smile against his cheek, wide and true.\n\n“Can I ask what your fear was when I mentioned talking? What were you worried that I would say?” Charlie checked again now that Nick had begun to settle in his arms once again while his hands still shielded Nick’s heart in a protective coat of arms.\n\nNick considered it for a moment, giving his answer the dedication it deserved, that Charlie deserved. He thought back to just a moment earlier, to the miscellany of thoughts whirling in his clouded mind and tried to search for one that jumped out as the ringleader — the queen bee of his troubled outlook who knew of his mind’s own plan better even than himself.\n\n“I guess my first thought was probably that you’d say it was just physical for you…that you didn’t want anything more than that and that it’d be better if we just kept it as such,” Nick whispered, like the words were laced with shame. He was beyond grateful that Charlie couldn’t see his face from this angle but his eyes still darted to the ground shamefully as the admission hung heavy between them.\n\n“Let’s start there then,” Charlie cooed, kissing Nick’s head again and holding his lips there for quite some time. “I promise you, Nick, that is so far from the truth. You are not just a warm body to me and you never have been. If I just wanted someone to get under after Max, I wouldn’t have chosen someone so lovely, and if I had chosen you for that purpose alone, I would have kissed you a lot sooner.”\n\nNick nodded slowly, allowing the words to sink into his skin like SPF and layer him with a protective sheen. His heart skipped a beat at the sincerity in Charlie’s tone and suddenly the vulnerability of Nick’s confession felt miles away. “You’ll have to forgive me, I’m not very familiar with communication like this when it comes to relationships, or dating, or… whatever.”\n\n“There’s nothing to forgive. As you know though, I’m a yapper, so I communicate frequently.” Charlie chuckled and Nick managed to pull one out as well, stepping delicately into the steaming bath of Charlie’s reassurance and allowing the tingling warmth to cage him entirely and seep into every pore on his skin.\n\n“And that’s good! Just something for me to get used to, I want to be able to communicate with you too… properly.” Nick sighed, mostly in relief as he worked to ease himself into this talk.\n\n“Willingness is all I need, darling. The ease and comfort will come with time. So, is it safe to assume then that this is also more than a physical attraction for you?”\n\n“Yes,” Nick answered in an instant with a deft finality to the word. “More than safe, the safest, like an overbearing mother with her child crossing the street levels of safety.” Nick rattled on, almost concerned that Charlie would even feel the need to ask such a thing given the desperate way Nick had stuck to him since their first meeting.\n\n“Careful, I’m going to get the impression you’re quite fond of me or something,” Charlie teased, and Nick could tell that he was doing everything in his power to ease his mind and wade him first into the shallow end of this conversation.\n\n“I’m so fond that it’s a little embarrassing,” Nick admitted, bringing his hands up to layer over Charlie’s on his chest.\n\n“Not in the slightest, I’m right there with you,” Charlie established. “And that’s precisely why I think this talk is so important. We both obviously developed feelings quite quickly, and while that’s natural and there is nothing wrong with that, I think we’d be remiss to ignore what each of us are going through right now — you, in particular.”\n\nNick felt his heart drop for the second time, though not as dramatically as the first. He tried finding solace in Charlie’s admission of feelings, in his promise that this was set to be a positive talk, but the newness in Charlie’s openness was stronger than Nick’s mind and he was once again left feeling on the brink of sinking into the deep end all alone.\n\n“I’m a little confused where that leaves us,” Nick confessed, his voice shaking as he forced his head above the water’s surface.\n\n“What I mean is that I care very deeply about you Nick, and it’s because I care so deeply that I think we should take a bit of time together to date before we go about making anything official. And… I’m going to go on a bit of a tangent here because I want to make sure I’m being very clear so please bear with me. Having true and genuine feelings for you so quickly doesn’t frighten me, I’m not fretful of liking you, but it does make me fearful of losing you. On the surface, regardless of anything else, we’ve both just gotten out of long term relationships, and while both of our partners were not the right person for us, that doesn’t just erase all of that time together no matter how we are feeling toward them respectively right now. So from that end, I want us to both feel like we are completely ready to commit to a relationship when we do so together — because I do want that with you Nick. On top of our twit exes, there are a number of additional layers in your life right now that I know you are dealing with and will be dealing with for a while. That isn’t to say that they are reasons I wouldn’t date you, but they are reasons that I know are extremely mentally taxing for you. I know I’m rambling on and I’ll give you the floor here now but I just want to be so absolutely crystal clear that I am not interested in seeing anyone else, I only want to date you; and it is so important to me that we both aren’t carrying forward our recent past relationships into this new one together — not because we couldn’t handle it, but because we shouldn’t have to.”\n\n“Oh,” Nick breathed. He wasn’t confused, it was the exact opposite, actually. He was completely and utterly clarified . Nick had never felt more firm of a grasp on someone else's feelings in his life; he was blown away, in short, by the mere idea that anybody could care so deeply and so exhaustively about his feelings and his heart. Charlie had already put more effort into Nick over the past month of simply knowing one another than Natalie had over the span of five years.\n\n“Good ‘oh’?”\n\n“Bloody brilliant ‘oh’.” Nick shook his head, searching desperately for words that could mirror Charlie’s own. “I…I’m really just floored that you could possibly feel as strongly for me as I do for you. I thought I was a bit mad, honestly.”\n\n“And you thought I was normal?”\n\n“Well, when you put it that way…” Nick chuckled, feeling soothed by the road the conversation had taken, just as Charlie had expressed that it would. All of Charlie’s words had turned into a soothing balm for his tizzied nerves, the knots in Nick’s stomach unravelled and smoothed into ironed sheets that relaxed his knotted shoulders.\n\n“Did I help to ease your nerves about this chat, darling?”\n\n“Very much so…” Nick affirmed, his voice softening with each word. He couldn’t help but smile, allowing his once tense neck to drop back onto Charlie’s shoulder now that his fears had mostly subsided. Charlie had this magical way of unravelling the tangled mess of Nick’s mind with just a few carefully chosen words, turning Nick’s anxieties into loose leaves carried easily away with nothing but a gentle breeze. “Can I ask though what exactly you meant when you said that we should date before making things official?”\n\n“Of course you can. What I meant by that was that all of this ,” Charlie motioned between Nick and himself. “Everything that’s transpired since we met has been fueled by the newness and excitement and then the buildup to us kissing, and I just want to be sure we both take the time to really get to know each other as someone who we want to be our partner. Like I mentioned earlier, us both being in the public eye means that regardless of how private we choose to be, we won’t be able to keep everyone in the dark for long. So, if and when we are ready to let anyone in on the fact that we’re together, I’d want us to both be a thousand percent certain that we are in it for the long haul, does that make sense?”\n\n“It does, and I’m very grateful that you are so smart because of the way that I am…my personality it…it’s quite addictive for lack of a better word, and that can lead to me being quite impulsive. So, as sure as I am about you and about us, I know that it’s smart to do it this way, and make sure we’ve given it the consideration it deserves.”\n\n“I think it sounds like we’ll balance one another out quite splendidly then.” Charlie smiled, and Nick could hear it so clearly even when he couldn’t see it. Their optimism was galvanising, a smooth, rich liquid that solidified to form a formidable, protective layer around Nick’s heart.\n\n“Can I ask another question? It’s a bit needy and insecure of me but I’m feeling very comfortable in my vulnerability in your arms right now, so…” Nick hesitated, his fingers tracing patterns from Charlie’s wrist up to his inner elbow, seeking reassurance in the warmth of their skin.\n\n“First of all, you don’t need to ask for permission to ask me a question, ever. Second, I’m so pleased that you’re comfortable there because I quite like it as well.” Charlie contracted his arms, an additional, silent promise that Nick was safe cradled in this moment of intimacy.\n\n“Do you regret that we kissed? Or like, should we not continue to do that while we are just dating and not… dating? Does that make any sense?” He wanted to curl in on himself. The question hadn’t sounded quite so desperate in his own mind as it did out loud.\n\n“Nick, this is going to sound entirely unserious but I could not be more sincere with what I’m about to say if I tried. If you stop kissing me, I’m going to kill myself,” Charlie stated firmly, pulling a throaty laugh from Nick who was instantly soothed by the jesting response. “Personally, I will not be stopping with that anytime soon unless you want me to. We’re both adults here, I know how I feel about you and I’m more than positive that feeling is only going to grow with this time together. Just because we are being responsible in considering our own well-being before diving into a committed relationship with one another, why should that mean we aren’t allowed to feel good in the process?”\n\n“Oh, thank fuck,” Nick sighed, turning in Charlie’s arms and kissing him almost desperately as his system flooded with relief. He’d survived the conversation and come out feeling more confident than ever about Charlie’s feelings as well as his own.\n\nIn no time, the kiss faded into a soft, conjoined laughter that reflected the affection and sincerity of which had lifted the weight of Nick’s uncertainty. It was all replaced with a joyous certitude fuelled and carried forward by their mutual glee fluttering about the room like confetti falling from the ceiling.\n\nCharlie’s eyes sparkled with mirth and something deeper, something honest and soul-bearing that let Nick know it was safe to feel comfortable here — that nothing bad would come of letting Charlie break down all of his carefully constructed walls one by one.\n\nThe two of them would face anything that came their way together.\n\n___\n\nThe first week of dating Charlie went by much in the same fashion as the last few weeks of whatever it was they were doing in the lead up to this. One change that Nick was quick to pick up on was Charlie’s flirtatious behaviour being upgraded from general audiences to PG-13. There were a lot more selfies, innuendos, and memes about how a man’s tongue down his throat would cure his mental illness. Luckily for Nick, he was able to adjust to the increased brazenness of Charlie’s toyings in his own presence alone while Tara was away on a girls’ trip to Spain.\n\nBeing home alone wasn’t as mocking as it had initially been when Natalie had taken her leave. The rooms and the walls didn’t sneer at Nick each time he rounded a corner, and the quiet didn’t feel quite so deafening. The sharp, lonely edges of the home that used to belong to two softened into blunt, dull memories. The silence faded into a stillness that brought comfort to Nick, brought him the space to think and desire on his own accord what he wanted his home to feel like.\n\nCharlie had introduced him to Pinterest when Nick had last been in Brighton, and Nick had spent this entire week of solitude curating a board of idea’s that he and Charlie were to go shopping for the next day when they arrived in London for a visit. Nick was certain most of the things that caught his eye on the app didn’t match one another in the slightest, but he trusted Charlie not to let him ruin his home with too many poor choices.\n\nThough Nick’s routines were much the same as they had always been, there were small rituals and amendments he made that had never been possible with Natalie around. He baked something nearly every morning, taking one of the day’s creations for himself before walking the remainder to the shelter just a few blocks down the street. He spent far more time writing lyrics or perfecting the chords to songs on his guitar or piano. Home was slowly but steadily becoming serene, something he’d only known for a brief few years in childhood once the initial sting of his father’s absence had dulled.\n\nIn tandem with his desire to create a home from the four walls of his house, Nick was on a mission to do the same with his body and mind. Vessels which had long since been running on fumes and the stern preferences of another; he was determined to make them his own again beyond the brick and mortar on display to the public. Nick’s journey of self-reclamation was about soul and sinew, about forging an identity that was uniquely and freely his.\n\n___\n\n“I’m Nick, I’m twenty-six years old, and I’ve been sober for twenty-seven days.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges on Nick’s journey to self-love was not feeling a crushing wave of defeat at each AA meeting he attended when he would announce his progress to the room. Hearing the word days from himself had only narrowly become easier in the recent weeks. He was now able to get the words out without outwardly cringing at the sound of his own voice, even if the guilt was just as stark in his mind. Despite the discomfort, Nick engaged in the prompts, he listened to the stories of the other healing souls in the room and he silently thanked the people in his life who helped him to still be here. He thanked himself for not giving up when it would have been so easy to do.\n\n“I’ve been alone a lot this week, more than I have been since my relapse. So that’s been my biggest challenge of the week, being alone with my thoughts and being the one there to help myself if they take a turn. It’s been hard but it’s been healing, trusting myself to be on my own and be okay.” He didn’t feel a need to lie in the way he had during his early days of AA a decade ago. Instead, Nick found power and solace in his truth; he acknowledged and understood that one can’t heal through a lie.\n\n“Can I ask a question of Nick? Is that allowed here?” The inquiry came from a man named Maurie. He was thirty-seven years old and had been sober for two and a half months, if Nick remembered correctly from his share the week prior. His chestnut hair was perfectly coiffed, streaked with just a few subtle, wiry silver strands, the sides were cropped close to his scalp, and he was dressed cleanly and professionally with his hands clasped tightly in his lap. He looked uncomfortable, mostly — the creases and bags around his eyes betrayed his perfect aura of put togetherness and the stiffness with which he shifted against the hard, cold plastic of the chair beneath him stripped him of any air of confidence.\n\n“If Nick is comfortable with taking a question, then that is entirely alright; Nick?” Ken, today’s meeting chairperson, agreed, turning to Nick with the offer.\n\nNick nodded in agreement, watching Maurie’s eyes shift nervously between himself and the linoleum floorboards.\n\n“You don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to, I was just curious really and I’m not even certain why, but…does being in the public eye in the way you are make it easier to stick with this? Like, knowing that so many people are watching you all the time, or does it make it harder because of all the pressure?”\n\nNick was a little taken aback by the question, not because it was absurd by any means, but primarily because it wasn’t something he’d ever really considered. Did it help him or hinder him to have so many eyes on his life at all times, particularly now when his following had been let in on the details of his past? Would he find encouragement in knowing that millions of strangers were waiting with baited breath on his success or downfall? Or would it widdle him down and push him towards unsavoury decisions?\n\n“I have to say I’ve never really considered the effect it has on me. If I were to give my best guess, I’d say that the only weight it carries is in the aftermath. For me, and I know for many others, even the devotion from our most cherished loved ones isn’t always enough to keep us on the straight and narrow, so I can’t say that the watchful eyes of people I don’t know has any stronger of an effect than say… my mum. With that being said, it definitely weighs on me heavily post-relapse. Even though I hadn’t yet shared my past with my followers when I relapsed at the beginning of the month, nor back when I was in my teens, it still felt like I had let the whole world down. At the same time I’m sure many in my position — whether in the spotlight or not — feel that same weight, so I can’t say for certain that it’s any different than what you or anyone else here has felt before.”\n\nMaurie and the meeting chairperson both smiled and thanked Nick for his share before carrying on with the rest of the meeting. Nick did his best to follow along, but found his mind returning to the question he’d been posed. He wondered if being more forthright with his journey online as it was happening would give him strength in his devotion to change or cause him greater distress. It was certainly something to consider, more than likely within the four protective walls of Leonard’s office.\n\n___\n\nThe week dragged on, it was one of the most mentally draining spans of days that Nick could remember. Between multiple AA meetings, therapy sessions, coffee chats with Melanie, and working on his album, Nick had expected the days to fly by. He was quickly learning though that there was a difference between dissociating through long days, and actually living them. But even though moving through these days with an astute consciousness of their impact was taxing on Nick, that didn’t stop him from taking note and enjoying in the fruits of his laborious efforts. Each plum plucked from the tree of Nick’s commitment to consciousness brought with it a far deeper understanding of his addiction. When his longest stretch of sobriety began half a decade ago, Nick wasn’t helping himself, he was helping Natalie. He didn’t attend meetings and therapy because he wanted to be better. He went to appease the masses and to provide a stable partnership for somebody he thought loved him. Now, in the silence of his home, with his piano under siege by the tips of his fingers, Nick understood what it meant to heal himself for himself. The unhurried comprehension came to him at the speed of a cliffside eroding over the span of decades. For so long, he had shaped his actions, thoughts, and even his dreams to fit the goals and expectations of others; he had donned their approval like a coat of arms, but it wasn’t durable. It was frail and paled in comparison to anything sturdy enough to withstand the weight of his burdens. The smiles and nods of validations from those around him had become the only measures of his worth until he’d seen them to exhaustion and they’d eroded away to expressions imperceptible.\n\nNow that he’d begun his travels in a new direction offered up at the crossroads of his life, Nick was finding pride and contentment in his own validation. The early days of his journey were fraught with discomfort of course, the same as any new employee during their first week on the job. The sound of his own praise was vile at first, cringe-inducing to the point of nearing concession, but as the final week of January opened, Nick found new life in his own company to an extent that he’d never been familiar with. His mind that had once been unaccustomed to self-affirmation began to question its own judgement and intuition far less frequently, trusting in Nick to take them where he saw fit. He persisted in spite of the initial, hollow attempts at self-praise, whispering affirmations into the mirror, jotting down small victories in a new journal separate from his song book, and slowly but surely cultivating a garden of self-worth that was blooming with grace before his eyes.\n\nIt helped of course that Charlie was arriving that very evening. Tara had conveniently — and only slightly at the beckoning of Nick’s recommendation — chosen this week to pay a visit to her mum.\n\nChar💛: I think I have a secret admirer\n\nChar💛: Some lovely gentleman had a car waiting for me when my train got in, knew where I was headed and everything\n\nI was about to act confused and pretend it wasn’t me but that felt mean\n\nI can’t wait to see you x\n\nChar💛: I most certainly would have stop dropped and rolled into the dirty streets of London and for that you never would have been forgiven.\n\nChar💛: Do you fancy me or something?\n\nFancy? No\n\nMildly obsessed? Yes xx\n\nChar💛: Don’t make me blush, the colour doesn’t match my outfit x\n\nWhat are you wearing? 🫣\n\nChar💛: Wouldn’t you love to know!\n\nI would, actually x\n\nChar💛: Soz, wouldn’t want to make my admirer jealous\n\nChar💛: Speaking of, I’ve just arrived! Ta ta for now x\n\nNick rolled off the couch so forcefully that he nearly took a tumble over the coffee table. He sprinted toward the door and pulled it open right in the nick of time for Charlie to mount the final step leading up to the home.\n\nThe sight of Charlie was an instant comfort for Nick. They struck him like the first rays of dawn after a long, sleepless night, only Charlie's luminance didn’t sting an unwelcome burn on tired eyes. Instead, their light was soft and considerate, easing into every crevice of a room and breaking up the darkness inch by inch. Everything about Charlie was invigorating, from the light offered through their cyanic eyes, to the ease and comfort of their quietly assured disposition, and the unparalleled uniquity of their natural, unforced empathy. Charlie embodied everything good in the world to Nick, and on top of it all, he was exceptionally gorgeous.\n\nNick pulled Charlie and his two hefty bags inside his home before either of them had a chance to utter a greeting. The moment the door clicked shut behind them, Nick dropped the bags and replaced them with Charlie, lifting him up in a crushing hug and spinning the two of them around thrice. When Charlie’s feet touched back to the ground Nick only pulled him in closer, mumbling half a dozen I missed you’s into Charlie's hair, against his cheek, in the crook of his neck, anywhere his lips could reach.\n\nAs the two of them were apt to do, their first night was spent in the serene privacy of Nick’s home, just them together enjoying one another's company with more take-out than either of them truly needed. The aromas of their favourite Indian dishes filled the air around them, soft spices and mildly bitter zest. They spent the majority of the night together on Nick’s sofa, legs tangled beneath a soft throw blanket while the conversation between them flowed as effortlessly as ever. Nick’s eyes never once strayed from Charlie’s face, drinking in every expression, every flicker of emotion that crossed their features and holding the mental images near and dear to his heart for the next time they’d be apart.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, with their batteries fully recharged, Nick and Charlie set off into the city to begin Nick’s home makeover.\n\nShopping in London in January meant that the city was riddled in a blend of post-holiday calm and the vibrant pulse of the city’s ever-bustling streets. The air was crisp and cool, carrying with it the scent of recent rain and the promise of snow that hadn’t actually come to fruition in more than two weeks' time. The store windows were still dressed in the remnants of festive displays, beckoning shoppers with the allure of their remaining winter sales and their brightly coloured signs proclaiming ‘clearance’ and ‘50% off’ that drew in crowds eager to snag a bargain amidst the debt of the holiday season. The breath of every shopper without a wool scarf wrapped around the bottom half of their face was visible in the frigid air, mocking the puffs of cigarette smoke pumping through the lips of every second sidewalk loiterer.\n\nMuch to Nick’s gratitude, Charlie had come into the day with a plan set in stone for all the best stops. They tread through an eclectic mix of vintage ships and upscale home boutiques, filling bags with linens, various decor pieces, and order slips for some larger items that would need to be delivered.\n\nThe day turned out to be far more therapeutic than Nick had expected. On the surface, the idea of spending an entire day out in the city shopping had done nothing to entice him — the crowds, the noise, the attention, the endless decisions… it all seemed bland and overwhelming. The exceptions to those faults were of course Charlie’s company and the promise of a refreshed home environment that felt like his own, both of which resolved to hold a larger weight than Nick had hoped for them. As it turned out, home decor shopping wasn’t so terrible when you got to pick your own items and curate a unique space for yourself alongside the person you were hopelessly falling for.\n\nEach shop they visited presented a new opportunity to discover something that resonated with him, something that could transform his home from a mere place of existence into a welcoming sanctuary. Nick found himself drawn in by pieces that he never would have considered before: an almost rustic coffee table with intricate carvings, a set of vibrant throw pillows that gave a pop of colour to his neutral couch, a piece of abstract art that resonated with him in a way he couldn’t quite articulate. Furthermore, for every new addition to his home, Nick and Charlie came across a dozen outlandish items that induced moments to rejoice in shared laughter while arguing over which one of them simply must add the decor to their home.\n\nAs they neared their last stop, Nick carried with him a sense of accomplishment and enthusiasm. The possessions he’d purchased were more than decorations, they were expressions of his personality and tastes and the prospect of going home to a space that felt truly like his own was incredibly satisfying.\n\n“There it is.” Charlie pointed across the street to the shop they’d plugged into their apple maps. “They’re supposed to have some really gorgeous bedding here.”\n\nThe exterior was charming, with large glass windows displaying elegantly arranged bed linens, pillows, and throws in an array of colours and textures. The refined display beckoned passersby with its promise of a sanctuary where comfort met style. Above the door, a sign promised luxury and comfort within, inviting all those who entered to experience a touch of indulgence. Nick followed Charlie inside, weaving through a few patrons mingling at the entrance whose conversations muddled with the soft ambient music playing throughout the store.\n\nThe store was meticulously organised and a little intimidating. Charlie led Nick to the sheets first, located near the back of the shop as they muttered something about needing to build the bed from the inside out. Charlie had been a world of help throughout their venture, though he would only offer up his firm opinion or advice when solicited by Nick.\n\n“Linen is what I have now, right? I like the texture of those,” Nick remarked. He ran his fingers over a set of lilac linen sheets that felt both cool and soft to the touch.\n\n“Oui, everything on your bed is linen. It’s the best choice in my humble opinion, soft, breathable, and durable,” Charlie replied with a knowledgeable nod.\n\nNick raised an eyebrow, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “You’ve been studying your French, I see.”\n\n“Day and night.” Charlie preened.\n\n“C’est très impressionnant, mon cher. Avez-vous appris autre chose?”\n\nCharlie cleared his throat, a blush creeping up his cheeks as he turned abruptly away from Nick. “ Right ,” he muttered, trying to regain his composure. “Moving on. What colour are you on the hunt for? It looks like you’ll have your pick of the rainbow here.”\n\nNick chuckled at the sudden bashfulness. “I was thinking sort of a grey-blue? Something calming like that.”\n\nCharlie sorted through a rack before coming up with two hangers, each with their own set of blueish-grey linen sheets strung over them. He held the two spreads up on either side of his face to allow Nick a clear look at their unique shades in the light.\n\nNick inspected the fabrics intently. To the left of Charlie’s face hung a spray of linen that matched the tone of a stone settled near the bottom of a stream which rushed under a cloud-covered sky. It pulled far more streaks of grey than blue into its weaving but was a brilliant shade nonetheless. Nick tracked his eyes then across Charlie’s face, the only path to reach the second cloak of linen. Charlie’s eyes, once just two pearls of alluring, stormy blue, extended beyond his face and spilled over onto the robes of linen. It was like someone had mixed paints to Charlie’s shade exactly and proceeded to dip-dye the sheets until they’d created an identical match.\n\nNick was mesmerised by the likeness.\n\nHe found himself drawn into the folds and waves of the fabric, his thoughts drifting like stray leaves carried along by a gentle current. Each crease and shadow in the linen seemed to hold a story of its own, a story that begged to be discovered. The temptation to immerse himself fully was overwhelming, as if the linens offered more than a simple comfort; more than just a momentary exploration of beauty, but an escape as well — a portal into a world where he could lose himself completely. He found himself keen to dive into the bedcovers and swim around in them until he was forced to come up for air, Even so, he’d merely take one long, single drag before diving back in. The idea of submerging himself in the linens — in Charlie — was intoxicating, a sensory experience that promised to envelop him in warmth and safety; the cool fabric against his skin, the subtle scent of clean cotton mingling with a faint trace of Charlie’s cologne, the gentle rustle and splash of the waves as he moved — Nick was ready to surrender.\n\n“That one,” he whispered finally. Nick’s body was still but his mind and heart gasped for air as they sprung to the surface of Charlie’s sea. Nick reached out for his choice, plucking the hanger from Charlie’s right hand and nearly choking on his next breath as their knuckles brushed together for half a count.\n\nCharlie’s face was all too knowing, having had a front row seat to Nick’s pathetic daydream, alert and ready to dive in and save a drowning Nick had he been unable to find the surface on his own accord in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n“Brilliant choice,” Charlie said, his voice streaming like liquid gold through Nick’s ears.\n\n“Thanks,” Nick mumbled, red in the face as he turned and followed Charlie to the next section of the shop that housed the comforters and duvet covers.\n\nCharlie was in the midst of explaining to Nick the benefits of a duvet and cover versus a comforter when Nick felt a cautious tap on his shoulder. He turned to find the culprit just as an out of breath woman approached the blushing teen, Nick, and Charlie while frantically apologising.\n\n“Darling, I told you to leave them be, I’m so sorry to interrupt your shopping gentlemen.” Despite her panic, the woman had a genuine kindness in her exasperated eyes as she gently tugged on her child’s arm.\n\n“Don’t be, it’s no trouble,” Nick answered for them, smiling at the young boy who hadn’t stopped staring up at Nick with wide, admiring eyes. He appeared tall for his age — whatever the number was — with a round face and shaggy, strawberry blonde hair. He was wearing a Chelsea Football shirt that was three sizes too big on top of a thick grey sweatshirt. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Henry! My name is Henry, and I’msuchahugefanofyours! I’m so sorry to bother you but I just saw you through the shop window and I couldn’t help myself. I just needed you to know that you coming out helped me so much in feeling comfortable with myself. I got outed at school recently and it’s been really tough, but seeing someone I admire so much be proud of who they are truly changed my life as cringe as that sounds.”\n\n“Hey,” Nick stopped Henry with a gentle hand on his trembling shoulder, the boy appeared on the verge of passing out from a lack of oxygen. “That’s not cringe at all, mate. I am so honoured to be a source of comfort for you in a hard time like this, and I’m very sorry that whoever did that to you took away your choice in the matter.”\n\n“‘S okay.” Henry shrugged. “People haven’t been too awful, with the exception of some guys on my football team.”\n\nNick’s heart ached in his chest, both with a feeling of sorrow for his young fan as well as a gripping pride. This could be his one. The one young person he’d craved to have a positive effect on with his coming out. If this was the only time he was approached in such a way, then every last moment of stress and anxiety surrounding his decision, all of it had been worth it.\n\n“And those guys aren’t worth your time,” Nick said, his voice firm and reassuring. “Anyone who treats you differently because of how you identify isn’t someone who deserves to know you. Do you know something else? You are so brave, for coming in here and telling me that about yourself — worlds braver than I was at your age.”\n\nHenry looked up at Nick, his eyes wide. “Thank you,” he whispered. His voice was laced with wonder and quiet disbelief. “I…a lot of the guys just tell me I can’t play sports if I’m bi, which is just so stupid, so it’s so cool seeing guys who look kind of like me who are the same in that way. It makes me feel less alone.”\n\n“Your value isn’t defined by their acceptance, it’s defined by your character of which you clearly have plenty. It’s defined by your courage and your talent. So keep playing, keep being yourself, and know that you have every right to be there as much as anyone. You’re making a difference in the world for the better, Henry.”\n\n“Why don’t we snag a picture of the two of you?” Charlie offered, stepping forward with a glowing smile while Henry tried to keep discrete about the tears pooling in his eyes.\n\n“Oh my God, really? I wasn’t going to ask but…could we?” Henry’s bottom lip quivered, his entire body was practically shaking when Nick wrapped an arm around his shoulder, giving a gentle and encouraging squeeze.\n\n“Absolutely,” Nick agreed while Charlie accepted Henry’s mum’s phone that she’d held out in front of her.\n\n“It’s for the best that you snap it, Hen is always telling me I take the worst photographs.” She chuckled after clearing her throat of her own bubbling emotions.\n\n“They’re always blurry, and if this photo was blurry, I’d never forgive you!” Henry blubbered, doing his best to pull himself together as he leaned ever so slightly into Nick’s side.\n\n“Oh dear, the pressure is on,” Charlie muttered, steadying the phone in his hand and snapping half a dozen photos of Nick and Henry from a few different angles. “There we are, steady as can be,” he announced, passing the device back before returning to Nick’s side where he’d leaned over to offer Henry — who was now almost sobbing inconsolably — a hug.\n\n“You know,” Nick whispered. “As much as you look at me and see someone who has helped you, I want you to know that I see the same looking at you. This is all so new to me as well, and I want you to know how much it means to me to have you come in here and tell me what you have. Most importantly, I want you to know that you are perfect how you are, and to not let anybody make you disappear, Henry.”\n\n“Thankyousomuch,” Henry sputtered. The words blended together as he shook his head in vast disbelief, squeezing Nick’s midsection tight before stumbling back into his mum’s awaiting arms. His round cheeks — reddened still from the cold outdoors and now the flushed disbelief of meeting his hero — had become clear tracks for his tears loose to traverse.\n\nFor his part, Nick had to force his own tears back, overcome by the gravity of an encounter that he hadn’t expected to take place so soon. He’d imagined that if it were to happen at all, a day like this would come a little further down the road, but knowing that his coming out had already had a positive impact on a young boy in the way he’d prayed it would was beyond his wildest dreams. He had hoped as well that he would have had more time to prepare himself for the experience, feeling entirely unqualified to give any sort of advice on the subject matter when it was essentially new to him as well. Having Charlie nearby certainly helped ease those fears, their confidence in being and expressing themselves was brilliantly and uniquely contagious. Even though they’d taken a backseat in the interaction and allowed Nick to steer it in the direction he saw fit, he could still sense Charlie’s uplifting presence on his heels, ready to act as a lifeline should Nick’s emotions have gotten the best of him and taken over.\n\n“Thank you, Henry. It was lovely to meet you and I’m glad we crossed paths today. If you ever spot me through a window again, don’t be shy in coming to say hello.”\n\nHenry just nodded blindly, clearly overwhelmed and overcome by the weight of the experience he’d just lived through.\n\n“Thank you both for your time and your kindness,” Henry’s mum added, wrapping a loving and protective arm around her son and helping to steady him on his wobbly feet as the two of them took their leave from the shop.\n\nNick let out a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding. It came out a little shaky and overthrown with emotion.\n\n“How are you doing?” Charlie asked, his voice calm and quiet, clearly working to not draw any unnecessary attention to the two of them while Nick was pulling himself back together.\n\n“I’m alright,” Nick replied. And it was true, regardless of the many emotions steamrolling through his mind and body at the moment. “That was a lot, in the very best way of course, but a lot nonetheless. I don’t think I expected something like that to happen so quickly after coming out.”\n\n“You handled it beautifully, despite any anxiety you may have had surrounding it.”\n\n“Thanks, Char,” Nick stuttered nearly unintelligibly. He had to bite at his lip to stop himself from carrying on and saying more. He was suddenly rendered entirely inundated by his desire to pull Charlie into a hug, hold his hand, kiss him, anything he could do as an exposition of the weight and vitality of his emotions.\n\n“Penny for your thoughts?” Charlie asked, his voice curious.\n\nNick stepped a foot closer, motioning with his head for Charlie to turn with him towards the wall of fabrics so their faces were out of the line of sight of any potential onlookers. The shop’s ambient noise faded into the background the closer Nick got into Charlie’s personal space.\n\n“Full disclosure, I’m just finding it really difficult to keep my hands off of you right now and– ohmygod, I did not mean for that to… I just meant that–” Nick sighed, admitting defeat and relenting to quit while he was ahead. “Never mind.”\n\nCharlie, however, was apparently not finished with the conversation.\n\n“Never mind?” They whispered. “As in you aren’t having a hard time keeping your hands off me?” The question was toying and laced with coyness . “That’d be a shame, because I’ve wanted to take you into the loo of every shop we’ve visited today and kiss you until you can't stand straight.”\n\n“Charlie!” Nick exclaimed , eyes nearly bulging from their sockets as though he’d been electrocuted.\n\n“Hm?” Charlie responded innocently.\n\n“You can’t just… fuck,” Nick stammered, desperately wishing he could garner some semblance of control of the rampant blush clawing up his neck and over the stubble covered ridges of his jaw.\n\n“I didn’t say fuck, I said kiss, silly.”\n\n“Oh my god…right, okay.” Nick pinched his eyes shut and sucked a breath through his nose before glueing his eyes back on the array of fabric strung and folded on the walls around them. “I need a duvet cover.” He announced, picking through the racks hastily while Charlie giggled menacingly to himself, clearly reaping significant joy from shamelessly teasing Nick in public.\n\n“Pesky cat caught your tongue before I could.” Charlie smiled devilishly, eyelashes fluttering.\n\n“These two match nice! Let’s head,” Nick huffed, marching a few steps ahead of Charlie towards the register at the front of the shop with two different cover options for his duvet.\n\nCharlie’s laughter was soft but infectious — the kind that began as an easy chuckle and quickly grew into a delicate chime that echoed around the shop. It had a way of dissolving Nick’s tension, making him forget, if only for a moment, the awkwardness and the weight of his flustered disposition.\n\n“That was mean,” Nick grumbled as he and Charlie stepped back into the cold, bustling streets of London. The city’s usual clamour surrounded them; the hum of conversation, the distant honking of car horns, and the rhythmic clack of footsteps against frosted pavement —- all a stark contrast to the warmth and intimacy they’d be sheltered by inside the shops.\n\n“Oh? I rather thought my words were quite complimentary.” Charlie’s playful lilt melted the frigid air in the space around them. He pulled his scarf tighter around his neck, breath forming small clouds with each puff.\n\n“You know what I meant,” Nick fussed, his tone somewhere between exasperation and desperation.\n\n“I do, but I still think I’d quite like to hear you explain,” Charlie taunted, his eyes sparkling with mischief as he nudged Nick gently on his next step.\n\n“You’re a menace, Charlie Spring,” Nick muttered, the smile on his lips betraying any hint of frustration.\n\n“Well, as the French say, soo la voo, or whatever,” Charlie quipped.\n\n“Oh is that what the French say? Interesting…” Nick smirked as he steadied himself for his plan of attack. He stepped evenly in stride with Charlie and leaned as close to them as he could without it potentially pulling any attention towards the two of them. “Tu n'es pas le seul à pouvoir taquiner, Charlie. Deux peuvent jouer à ce jeu. Tu es si belle en ce moment et j'ai hâte que nous soyons à nouveau seuls chez moi pour pouvoir embrasser le sourire narquois de ton visage.”\n\n“I concede,” Charlie mumbled, picking up their pace and forcing Nick out of stride with them before he could dare to continue on.\n\n___\n\nPutting all of his new purchases on display turned out to be even more satisfying than the shopping — mostly because they were in the privacy of Nick’s home, which meant he could steal kisses from Charlie between every fragile item he retrieved from their bubble wrapped entrapment.\n\nCharlie had a keen eye for the placement of everything they brought back to Nick’s; from which side of the couch his new throw pillows should rest, to which drinking glasses deserved the front row of the shelving unit in the kitchen, all the way down to the minute detail of which corner of the marble countertop would house Nick’s new diffuser purchased by Charlie as a house re-warming gift.\n\nThey moved on to the bedroom next to replace Nick’s bedding. Charlie took the lead as with everything else, teaching Nick the most practical ways to pull a fitted sheet over a mattress with it wrinkling and Martha Stewart’s life changing tips for donning a duvet cover. He demonstrated with a practised ease, almost forgetting to let Nick help at all. Nick was happy to oblige and follow instructions, or simply observe when Charlie looked so joyfully in their element.\n\n“It’s like magic!” Charlie grinned, their cheeks flushed with delight as he and Nick gave the duvet — now sheathed in its dusky blue linens — a final fluff.\n\n“You make it look so easy, I’m going to have to call you here every time it is in need of a change,” Nick remarked, genuinely impressed. He’d never found himself so engrossed in home-care before this very moment.\n\n“Sorry for prattling on so much, I hyperfixated on linens when I moved into my flat and the excitement has yet to kick. It’s surely not as serious as I’ve made it sound,” Charlie replied after a moment, a hint of self-consciousness creeping into his voice as he smoothed and unsmoothed one particular corner of the bedcovers.\n\n“Don’t apologise,” Nick assured, stepping into Charlie’s space and lifting his worried hand from the fabric. “I think it’s adorable.”\n\nCharlie’s face lit up with a mixture of relief and happiness. “Really? You don’t mind?”\n\n“Not at all, I love watching you engage in your passions. It’s contagious.” A small twinge pricked at Nick’s heart as the thought of someone shaming Charlie for expressing and sharing in the little things that bring him joy.\n\nAs they finished up by fluffing Nick’s new pillows to Charlie’s heart's content, Nick smiled and glanced at Charlie. “I think we make a pretty good team, it looks so cosy.”\n\n“I’d say so.” Charlie smiled back with a twinkle in their eye. “Maybe next time we tackle the art of folding a fitted sheet. It’s a challenge but I think you can handle it.”\n\nNick laughed, feeling a serene lightness fill up his chest like a birthday balloon. “I’m up for it, as long as you’re leading the way.”\n\n“I’ll gladly lead.” Charlie’s grin widened, something new and wanting in their eyes. “You know, I do believe there is only one way to accurately put the comfort of our hard work to the test,” Charlie cooed, their voice suddenly low and tethering on the edge of being seductive. They turned towards Nick slowly, raising their arms and letting their palms come to rest flat against Nick’s chest.\n\nCharlie began walking them back, one achingly slow pace at a time. Nick’s mind stirred and buzzed, completely enraptured by the look in Charlie’s eyes and the feeling of their hands pressing firmly against him. The heat of Charlie’s touch seared through the fabric of his thick jumper. Nick couldn’t find it within himself to answer, but the contraction of his pupils, the hollow intake of breath; it was all enough to give Charlie any ounce of agreeance they could possibly need. His body responded instinctively. There was no time for thinking, only unconscious, innate reactions to Charlie’s electric touch. Charlie’s eyes gleamed, mischievous, penetrating, and evidently aware of the effect he was having on Nick and loving it just as levelly.\n\nNick’s desire was saccharine, a candied, aching longing that consumed his being. His hands moved on impulse to Charlie’s waist for an anchor of support. He tugged gently to rid of the space left between their bodies at the same time that the back of his knee’s met with the edge of his bed. Charlie stayed standing as Nick went with the will of his body and slid down into a seated position on the mattress. He sunk into the freshly laid duvet, an inviting cloud of salvation and luxury. He looked up at Charlie through heavy lashes and his lips, slightly parted, were ready for the taking. Charlie’s hands roamed upwards, over the ridges of Nick’s shoulders and around the back of his flushed neck until they could sink into the locks of hair there. Nick’s eyes fluttered shut at the simple sensation, revelling in the merciful tug of curls, the sweet scratch of ivory coated fingernails, and the quiet hum of Charlie’s appreciation.\n\n“Lie back for me?” Charlie hushed, his lips ghosting against the shell of Nick’s ear. Nick hadn’t even detected them leaning in, too wrapped up in the feeling of their fingers crawling through his hair — matted down slightly from the brisk condensation that gripped the strands during their shopping trip.\n\nNick shivered at the sensation of Charlie’s breath on his skin, heart racing with anticipation as he blindly obliged to their request and turned to manoeuvre himself into a lying position. He went without question, surrendering to Charlie’s will and forcing himself to accept a role that didn’t come with ease — not from a lack of desire, but more so a lack of know-how. Nick’s head tilted to the side, finding Charlie’s darkened, navy eyes as his back sunk into the bed. Every nerve in Nick’s body seemed to come alive at once, tingling with exhilaration and a trace of nerves. Charlie stayed standing for a moment's time, watching Nick squirm under their gaze before slowly and intentionally crossing their arms at the hem of their thick, wool jumper and pulling it over their head in one swift motion. The action left Charlie in a tight, cream coloured vest that outlined their frame so perfectly that Nick nearly choked on his next breath. They were a sight to behold — all olive toned skin and taught, slender muscles, and subtle curves and lines that spoke of grace and strength in equal measure. Every movement Charlie made seemed so deliberate yet fluid, a testament to the ease they felt in their own skin. Everything about them had a way of stripping away all of Nick’s reservations, leaving him feeling exposed yet eager. Charlie’s voice, soft yet commanding; Charlie’s body, slim yet structured; Charlie’s entire presence, tranquilly confident and exceedingly irresistible.\n\nIt was nothing Nick had yet to see before. The subtle curve of Charlie's chest, the alluring way that the raised, ribbed fabric stretched taut over their nipple piercings, their long arms a canvas of olive and pearly white where healed scarring stretched over the inner portion of their bicep. Nick couldn’t believe that this was all a vision for him to admire, a living work of art standing before him. Just as Nick had finished downloading the image of Charlie standing above him into his mind, committing every detail to memory, they began to move, mounting the bed on their knees and slipping a leg across Nick’s hips to straddle his body.\n\nNick sighed, relishing the new proximity as Charlie settled into a seated position on top of him. Nick budged up onto his elbows, bringing him and Charlie closer together. It was far less fluid and graceful than Charlie’s own movements but it got him where he wanted. The dimmed bedroom lights cast a halo of luminance around Charlie’s frame, flushed and angelic. Their bodies were perfectly aligned magnets, not an ounce of resistance between them until Nick tried to get closer, tried to push himself up far enough into Charlie’s space to reach his lips. They almost grazed, Nick would even swear he felt a tickle as subtle as a blade of grass brush his desperate lips. But in the same moment that their breaths blent, Charlie pressed back against Nick’s chest again, nudging him back into the mattress with a finesse that tickled all of Nick’s senses from head to toe.\n\n“Is it comfortable?” Charlie asked, voice light as air and thick as honey all at once. The question fluttered in the air dripping with saccharinity all over Nick.\n\n“Comfortable?” Nick echoed, breathless and spacey.\n\n“The bedding?” Charlie clarified with a smug look. They lowered themselves, inch by inch until their face was only a breath from Nick’s.\n\n“Oh , right… mhmm, yeah. Very.” Nick cleared his suddenly desert dry throat. “It’s very comfortable.”\n\n“Good,” Charlie whispered. He closed the space between them and pressed a feather light kiss to the corner of Nick’s mouth; merely a peck, a taste of what Nick knew of their lips to be capable of.\n\nNick whined — out loud — because it wasn’t enough. The sound was raw and desperate, an angsty admission of his need, his need for more and his need for it now . Every fibre of his being was crying out for satisfaction, but he couldn’t take, wouldn’t take from Charlie. All he craved was to give and if that meant giving himself up like this for Charlie’s pleasure then that was what he would do.\n\n“God,” Charlie groaned, a jumble of disbelief and wonder in his eyes as he put Nick out of his misery and caught his lips with prudence.\n\nThe room pulsed with heat, Charlie’s breath amalgamated with Nick’s haughtily, a dance of scorching desire between their needy mouths. Each and every forced exhale was a testament to the fervour between them. Nick felt like he was in a pressure cooker — every sensation heightened, every touch charged, the world outside their intimate sphere had been reduced to a distant hum.\n\nWith their lips meeting in a hungry clash — a collision of longing and need that sent brilliant sparks flying about the bedroom — Nick fell victim to the strength of Charlie’s unique brand of ecstacy coursing through his veins. He surrendered entirely to the magnitude of Charlie’s kiss, to the insistent bursts of air flaming their enclosure as the temperature continued to rise. Nick kissed back earnestly, giving as much as he could while his mind was as clouded as the smog-filled streets of Paris, suffocating in the most delectable way.\n\nCharlie’s hands were moving with such purpose, exploring the curves and contours of the map of Nick’s body. Their fingers traced over his jawline with a mild scrape, down and around the nape of his neck; he held purchase there firmly to keep Nick’s head exactly where he desired it.\n\nNick couldn’t believe that this was his life.\n\nHe couldn’t believe that he was on his back with Charlie Spring on top of him, grinding their hips downward against his own. He couldn’t believe that Charlie’s hands were rolling under his jumper and palming at his bare skin. He felt like his bones were moments from bursting out of his body from the pressure swelling, and the next closest thing was Charlie tugging at the hem of Nick’s jumper and pulling back from their kiss just far enough to silently ask Nick for permission with a debauched look.\n\n“Is this okay, darling?” Charlie probed, doubling down with verbal consent before carrying forward.\n\nHe nodded with exuberance. “Please,” Nick practically begged, voice completely void of any stability.\n\nCharlie hummed in response. “You’re so pretty like this, Nick.”\n\nSomewhere amidst the delight of Charlie pushing up his jumper until it was bunched at his shoulders, lifting Nick’s arms one at a time to tug the thick cotton away from his skin, and peppering him in wanton praise, Nick rediscovered his ability to move. The moment he was sheathed of his jumper, Nick flipped Charlie onto his back in one smooth motion. Their kiss only snapped for a portion of a second when Charlie let out a surprised gasp at the nimble shift of positions.\n\nNick kissed Charlie like he was searching for something, like Charlie was a rare gem buried in the depths of a mine on the coast of Madagascar, like he was the long lost tomb of a pharaoh hidden in an unmapped pyramid in Egypt. Nick sought after something he had no idea how to discover but would die trying for. He became so engrossed in his journey that he hadn’t even realised just how painfully turned on he’d become in the process, until Charlie grappled hotly at his hips pulled them down in a rough grind against their own.\n\nNick was thrown off grid faster than he’d come to find his path atop of Charlie. Feeling them like this — fully hard underneath him — did a few things to Nick. He went pliant on top of Charlie, moving with the grain of his evenly timed tugs, losing himself completely in paralysing sensations coursing through his body. The friction was irresistible and delicious and every movement controlled by Charlie turned up the intensity of the molten pressure expanding in Nick’s core. Charlie’s hands were so sure and practised, guiding Nick with a stew of urgency and care that left him feeling cherished, desired, and entirely unworthy of the pleasure gushing through his bones. Even so, Nick matched the rhythm to the best of his conscious abilities, arching into Charlie’s touch and taking because he was unable to stop himself; not when every nerve ending in his body was alive with sensation, not when his body was nearly trembling with anticipation and struggling to keep itself planked on the weight of his forearms.\n\nLike this, Nick had no chance of returning to the path leading towards Charlie’s pleasure. His breathing had become so tattered that his mouth was forced away from Charlie’s in order to keep his lungs satisfied. Their breaths mingled, hot and ragged, until Nick dipped his head into the crook of Charlie’s neck. The space was warm, smelling of a mix of pungent florals and a light sheen of sweat. He mouthed at the bare skin there, slow and sloppy as his arousal bloomed and burgeoned, heating up the room around them enough to bring an end to the winter months outside the home.\n\n“Cha- ah–” Nick chokes on the name, feeling Charlie increase the pace and the strength of his controlled grinds so marginally that Nick wasn’t even certain it was intentional.\n\n“Nick,” Charlie breathed, sweet and soft, the defectless contrast to the constant friction between their erections strained against the fabric of their matching sweatpants. “You can let go, sweetheart. You don’t need to hold back.”\n\nThe words snapped Nick back to reality so quickly he felt the whiplash reverberate in his bones. It was too late though, he was at the peak of the rollercoaster and with one final push from Charlie he was soaring over the edge.\n\n“Fuck , Charlie,” Nick cried, his arms trembled and nearly gave way to the weight of his body as the pleasure crashed over him like a lightning strike, quick, electrifying blows of rapture amidst the thunderous rumbling of his and Charlie’s hearts beating together. The force was almost unbearable, every single one of his nerves were alight with an inundation of delight. The pleasure only built on itself, layer upon layer, each one stacking more intensely than the last, like the surge of a rising tide. As the waves settled though, Nick collapsed and succumbed to the smouldering shame bubbling hot and furious inside of him for allowing himself to take before giving.\n\nHe tried to push past it, to strain himself and slot a thigh between Charlie’s legs and give them something of substance to grind up into, but Charlie wasn’t dubious enough to misjudge Nick’s abrupt shift in demeanour.\n\n“Nick? Are you alright?” Charlie asked, eyes tilting with concern.\n\nNick’s heart pounded in his chest, guilt and frustration roiling within him as the shame poisoned his cheeks pink. “I’m so sorry– fuck, I’m so sorry, Charlie,” Nick sputtered. “I didn’t mean to– to be so selfish.”\n\n“Selfish? I don’t understand.” Charlie’s voice was soft, soothing but the confusion was evident in their wide, searching eyes. “Nick, we were both-”"
