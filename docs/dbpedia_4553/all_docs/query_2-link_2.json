He does the big technology newsletter all@bigtechnology.com and always a welcome guy. Your book. I see it right behind you. Is that your book? Usually\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:02:42):\n\nYou have it, yes. It's different. A bunch of different variations. Japanese Nav, yeah. English, Korean, and a bunch of other languages. So that's awesome.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:49):\n\nHere's a couple. Awesome. Congratulations. Yes. Excited about it. Yeah, that's really great. And I should,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:02:54):\n\nThe title is always Day One if anybody's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:55):\n\nInterested. It's always, yep. Day one Buddy based of course on Jeff Bezos, famous dictum that it should always be day one at Amazon. It's about day eight now, I think at Amazon, actually. But we'll talk about that. We're\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:03:08):\n\nDeeper into the day. Yes, we happen.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:10):\n\nYes. Also with us. Somebody who covers technology day-to-day, but is also perhaps the preeminent historian of our culture. Mr. Steven Levy. He's an editor at large, at Wired, author of a book on Facebook. The Inside Story spent three years embedded at Facebook to write that did the same for Google. But of course if you haven't read Hackers the original history of the Original Geeks you are not up to date on what tech is all about. It's the must read. Stephen, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you for joining us.\n\nSteven Levy (00:03:46):\n\nThanks, Leo. It's all happy to be on\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:48):\n\nBoth from New York. So expect to hear a lot of sirens during the show. Today. It's always <laugh>. I don't know if that's Brooklyn or Manhattan, I'm not sure which. But <laugh>, we're, we're, we're\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:03:59):\n\nOff the street in this place, but we did just have the Brooklyn Marathon Half Marathon run by\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:03):\n\nUs this morning. Oh,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:04:04):\n\nThere you go. It's interesting. But that seems to be done there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:06):\n\nThere you go.\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:07):\n\nYou, you will get a siren from me.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:10):\n\nBoth of you have been covering. Yeah, I know both of you have been covering tech for a long time. And I'm, I'm\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:18):\n\nOh, oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:22):\n\nOh, wait. Is that you, Alex?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:04:24):\n\nNo, it's not me. I'm off the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:25):\n\nStreet. Must be Steven. Okay.\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:26):\n\nYeah, that wasn't even a loud one. Really.\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:29):\n\n<Laugh>. It\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:31):\n\nSounded like the end of the world, to be honest with you.\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:34):\n\nI,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:35):\n\nI, I feel like alien you're landing now. Oh my gosh. You get used to that, Steven. Like, you don't even hear it anymore, probably.\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:45):\n\nNo,\n\nSteven Levy (00:04:46):\n\nNo, no. <Laugh> <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:51):\n\nI love it. This has, you've been covering tech for a long time as of high. And one of the questions, of course when you're covering day-to-day on tech, you always have to ask is, is this the next big thing or is this just another 3D television? You know, is it, is it about to change the world or not? And boy, that question comes up a lot for me with what's been going on in ai. So I think I've got two people with some great perspective to talk about that. This was kind of a wild week chat. G p t four was released by Open AI immediately incorporated into Microsoft's version of Bing Chat. And I would say based on Twitter alone, there are about 500 new startups that are gonna be using chat G p T in some form or fashion. One of the new features is you can take an image and give it to chat G p t four, and it will do something with it.\n\n(00:05:46):\n\nImmediately somebody showed how you could do a and literally a sketch on the back of a napkin of a website, feed it to chat G p t four, and get a working JavaScript H T M L C S S website. I've seen it now write code malware as well as good stuff. <Laugh> you, it's, it's kind of remarkable. So this, this, you know, this last, I would say last three months have been looked like anyway, the elbow on the hockey stick when it comes to ai. But I bet both of you have another take given your, your historic, let's start with Steven. What is this? I I ask everybody this now. Is it a parlor trick or is it the next big thing?\n\nSteven Levy (00:06:35):\n\nI think it's more the latter, really. Yeah, I think yeah, as you say, I've been around for a while. When I started writing about technology, it was the explosion of PCs that was just beginning to slip into the mainstream. It was a gold rush time. And there's only been a couple really similar explosions since there was mobile before then the internet, right? So then internet and mobile, each one built on the previous one. And I think this ai, you know, this inflection point of ai, because AI's been getting better and better and, you know, it's how these jumps most recently in around the mid two thousands when deep learning became a thing. And AI became much more useful in how it previously, and I think now in terms of the way it communicates with humans and, you know, does this output, this generative content it is going to open the door to things that even people who make it can't imagine. And that's really the signature of those previous revelations revolutions if you wanna call 'em.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:56):\n\nBut you have also, if you've lived through this, lived through AI winners as well.\n\nSteven Levy (00:08:00):\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean, I did a, a column I think my first column this year was the welcome to the Hot AI summer Hot wet ai Summer <laugh>. Yeah. Can\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:10):\n\nI say? But you know, what comes after summer <laugh>?\n\nSteven Levy (00:08:13):\n\nWell, and I said that, you know, that we're going to get thousands of startups built on APIs from, I think\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:22):\n\nWe got that many this week. It's gonna\n\nSteven Levy (00:08:24):\n\nBe alone. Yeah. Yeah. So it's and it is something that's real and something is gonna make a difference. Something's going to put people to work and put lot people outta work. And it's you know, in G P T four, which came out this week is going to have a lot of numbers in the next few months and years. So we see what a big leap it was from three to three, five to four, which was secretly in Bing. But, you know and they're working on, I'm sure, five, six and, and on from now on. And, you know, you, you saw it was like the greatest leap in L S A T coaching ever because 3.5 would only be like a mediocre law student who, you know, passed the L S A T or got, you know, did enough the L S A T maybe not get into one of the better schools. And four, all of a sudden you've got someone who was a really sharp student taking the L S A T, this could get into Columbia, got into the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:32):\n\nNineties, the 90th percentile on the\n\nSteven Levy (00:09:35):\n\nRight. It's a right. And it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:37):\n\nRemarkable. It got better s a t scores than I did\n\nSteven Levy (00:09:40):\n\n<Laugh>. Well, by, by by six, you know, that there won't be anywhere to go. There'll be a hundred percent. Yeah. And so what does that mean for the L S A T and for lawyers?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:49):\n\nYeah. but at the same time, you could also take that as a, maybe an indictment of those tests as perhaps being too rote to which requiring memorization. I mean, it's for sure that if you had access to the entire corpus of the internet, there's plenty of tests you could pass. And of course chat, G P T has that, Alex, are you equally bullish on the future of ai?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:10:15):\n\nYeah, I'm pretty bullish on it. And yes, of course our education system has long been a failure in terms of the, you know, memorize and spit back nature. So I'm not very impressed that it's passing tests that are, you know, ultimately inadequate for really assessing the ability to learn and to, to think in the academic world. It's a longer conversation, but I do think that this is a big step forward. You have, you talked about it as the elbow of the hockey stick. You know, that might be one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is just a continuum on a long era of research that we've had and breakthroughs that have come bit by bit. And the thing with AI technology is it looks like it's going slowly or there's been nothing. And then big advances come outta nowhere because someone finds an interesting way to package it to someone.\n\n(00:11:00):\n\nAnd then you get the demo and you're like, oh my God, this is amazing. And I think the real tell here, and the real interesting thing about it is that there's a real use case, right? Like how much oxygen and, and ink was expended talking about how crypto was gonna re revolutionize the tech world and revolutionize the world. And most people haven't ever used it for anything practical in their entire lives. Whereas you put some of this technology and you package it as a chatbot, and all of a sudden you get a hundred million users overnight. And, you know, I'm like, if I'm in coworker, coworkers are talking to non-tech people. They're all using chat G P T, because it is a really, it's a miraculous tech product. And when you think about now where it's gonna go and why it's exciting, it's because a company like OpenAI didn't develop chat G P T to develop chat G P T, it developed chat, G p t and g p t four to show it off to the world so that developers are gonna build on top of it and find different interesting use cases of it.\n\n(00:11:58):\n\nSome of those will be extremely stupid, but some of those will be powerful and very interesting. And that's what really gets me excited about it. It's the APIs here. It's the turning this tepid technology into a platform and not hoarding it. But I think is gonna be very, very interesting.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:12):\n\nThat's an interesting point because the PC revolution you were talking about, Stephen Levy only happened because IBM neglected to protect itself against copycats. So the PC clones could exist and didn't in fact you know, licensed dos from Microsoft and allowed them to continue to sell it. So it was very easy to clone an IBM pc. There was nothing really proprietary in it. I guess you could say the same for the internet revolution and the mobile revolution. Proprietary is probably a bad thing if you want to create a a revolution in technology. And, and, and as far as I could tell, everything Chat GTS doing or stable diffusion or mid journey is based on widely known concepts published in the academic papers over the last 10 years. There's nothing secret or magical in it. Is that right? Is that your sense, Steven?\n\nSteven Levy (00:13:03):\n\nWell, there's a, you know, a lot of details to be sweated to get something out, and that's, you know, we've seen the it takes a lot of work to have it come out with minimal biases and yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:19):\n\nWe're still waiting for Google to do Yeah,\n\nSteven Levy (00:13:21):\n\nRight. <Laugh> and what do they call hallucinations? Well, Google, you know, it's interesting. In early November, Google had an AI event and they were talking about their chatbots and other things, but they boasted that we have this stuff, but we're not releasing it. We're going slow, we're being responsible. And then only a couple weeks later G P T chat came out and bang all of a sudden they said, we better move fast. They declared a code red. And, you know, the thing they boasted about the caution was thrown, if not to the winds sort of removed a little. And you know, I think that's what has some people alarmed that that open eyes move fast philosophy that stake in the ground and, and to work with Microsoft to supercharge everything is gonna force the hand of Google. And, you know, Meta's got a chat now and other places. So it's moving very, very fast. And for some people too fast because it really hasn't addressed some of the flaws that the best scientists haven't managed to minimize.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:46):\n\nWhat are the flaw? What are the, what are the, what are the problems?\n\nSteven Levy (00:14:50):\n\nI'd say the two biggest ones are bias and fake news. But, you know hallucinations is what they call them, which is basically bullshit. You know, they, they're masterful\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:15:02):\n\nBull, though. That's what's\n\nSteven Levy (00:15:03):\n\nSo many <laugh>. Yeah. But they very impressive, very confident <laugh>, they look you in the eye and they tell you something, which isn't true. It's just right for\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:15:11):\n\nOur times, isn't it?\n\nSteven Levy (00:15:13):\n\n<Laugh>, right? Right. Like that <laugh>. So when you, when you put in your own esca for your own little mini biography or even obituary it won't say I'm vague on this when wasn't sure. It'll say, you know, oh, from my most recent one, it said, and he majored in science in college. Well, in fact, I got out of my science requirement in college, you know, through some loophole and never took even a single science course in college. But you know, it, if you look at this, it said, yeah, he majored in science, he was a science major. Where did that come from? Well, it came from the idea that someone who writes the things I do probably did major in science. So it made that, you know, assumption and reported it like it was fact. So and I don't know if it's possible to sort of go into the algorithms and, you know, parse through the network, you know, the neural network that was, it was trained on, and see how it came up with that. But that's wrong. And people are gonna rely on this stuff to try to figure it out.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:16:29):\n\nBut Microsoft has a way of talking about this that sounds like spin, but I think is pretty interesting. And it says that these bots can be useful wrong. And, you know, initially I heard that phrase and I was like, that's kind of ridiculous. What does useful wrong be? Like, I wish I could be useful wrong in my job. But I think there is something to that, something very interesting to that, which is that I think people are starting to learn that these technologies are not single sources of truth. And so what it can do is it can be wrong, but it could also give you a bit of a perspective on, you know, something and then get, encourage you to do a little bit more of your own research. And so I would say that when it comes to these bots, there's probably few people who believe that they're telling them the exact truth, but many more people that are, that say, oh, that's interesting, you know, maybe I could see exactly, you know, what the bot is talking about when it said that.\n\n(00:17:22):\n\nLike, now I'm gonna Google Steve's actual education, or I'm gonna look a little bit deeper into the topic, similar to the way that we use search engines, right? We don't put a search turn in a search engine, usually, right? Pick the first website that comes up and take it as an absolute source of truth if we do poking around. We've been trained by years of using technology that there's a way to triangulate what the actual reality is. And I, and I think that users of these bots are, are, are already more sophisticated than many of the experts are giving them credit for. And so I don't think that this is gonna be a major problem in the way that it might have been in the past.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:59):\n\nOkay? But as long as you know that you're potentially getting inaccurate information and you know that it came from an ai, but the problem is <laugh> that often the sources separated from the, in the text. I just worry. And, and by the way, we should mention that Mid Journey came out with version five of its image generation software. And it, again,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:18:28):\n\nThat thing is amazing. I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:29):\n\nWould say it's as much of a leap as the chat. G p t four was, I mean, it's giving you photorealistic images now. And I I think there's gonna, there is, you don't think there's an issue with people looking at this stuff going, oh, that's real. Of course,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:18:45):\n\nOf course there's an issue. The question is scale, right? And I, I happen to think that we're not dealing with a massive scale issue that people are gonna learn very quickly how to deal with this ai. And it actually goes back to the thing that we're talking about earlier with misinformation in fake news. And I think a lot of the people who like would spread the articles that would say, for instance, Hillary Clinton is a space alien, didn't really believe that Hillary Clinton came from\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:10):\n\nSpace. Right? They didn't\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:19:11):\n\nCare, but rather just didn't like her. Yeah. They didn't care then shared that article because it felt good. Yeah. So I think that that's the real issue. We're gonna, and because we've been focused so much on this, we spend a lot of the time talking about it and less time talking about the problems, you know, deeper in society. The humans have a lot easier to talk about misinformation. The machine is, that's what I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:28):\n\nThink. It's not nearly the problem. The humans are\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:19:30):\n\n<Laugh>, of course. Now look, is this gonna make it easier for people to scale some of the, the crap that they spread online? For sure. Is that an issue? Yes. but you know, I think that again, humans are, are pretty smart for the most part, not all of them. And they'll have the ability to sort of suss out what's coming from these bots and what's not.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:48):\n\nHere's a picture of my cat. Well, at least to check that I generated in mid journey five. And it's black and white, it's photorealistic and I would say would be very difficult for somebody to look at that, you know, if you know that you're looking for I issues perhaps. But mid journey can, can really produce very, very good artificial images now. Much better. In fact, that's what's interesting. And you kind of raised that point in the beginning, Steven, is the, is the speed of progress at this point is dramatic. You know, a couple of months chat, G P t went from, you know, 40th percentile to 90th percentile in the bar exam.\n\nSteven Levy (00:20:28):\n\nYeah. It looks like the thing came almost outta out of nowhere. People knew that OpenAI was working on this stuff. People knew about, you know, the Google's Lambda which is the, their equivalent of the, you know, G P t was so good that of the engineers at Google actually believed, or said he\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:50):\n\nBelieved Yeah, lake lemoyne.\n\nSteven Levy (00:20:52):\n\nYeah, <laugh>, yeah, it was sentient. And you know, it got him to you know, so wrapped up in it that he tried to hire a lawyer to represent the chatbot in its effort to get free of Google. So it, it is moving scary fast. After, as you mentioned, there have been winners before and plateaus and, and ai, but you know, all of a sudden, you know, much faster than a lot of people expected, we're coming to grips with some of the literally has extensional issues that sophisticated ai brings to the fore.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:33):\n\nDo we, I mean, the touring test is widely discredited now. I think it would be safe to say that chat G p t four could easily pass the touring test. How about the Chinese room test? The, it feels like we've gotten AI to the point now where it could fool you.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:21:50):\n\nWell, cause AI's gonna, yeah, it's gonna pass all the tests. I mean, this stuff is gonna be, it's trained to pass the test. It's going to pass all the tests. Okay. And then it's gonna get into a deeper question of like, okay, well what is really, what is intelligence really? Right? What is consciousness really like? These are like terms that we all think that we know in, in our heads and in our souls, but we don't have real good definitions for, you know, what sentient is. I actually, I had Blake Lamoyne on big technology podcast, and we did speak about this and it was very interesting. Again, I I told him, look, you're probably wrong, but you're still gonna be in the history books as the first person that believed this stuff. Cuz you're not gonna be the last person that believes it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:28):\n\nIs he Paul Revere a chicken little,\n\nSteven Levy (00:22:30):\n\nYeah. Yeah. Alex, do you think that he believes it?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:22:34):\n\nI think he definitely believed it at the time. I don't know. My, my hunch is he might have some regrets but he definitely wasn't backing down. I just had him debate Gary Marcus, who's a AI critic, and that was an interesting conversation also. And Blake stuck with it. So I think, but also one of the interesting things about Blake that has been somewhat reported, but I don't think deep enough, is that he comes from like a very religious background that, and, and has these interesting definitions of spirituality. And that's why I think it's gonna be interesting to hear, you know, what people's definitions of intelligence are, what people's definitions of, you know, having a spirit is what definitions of consciousness are. Because again, like I was saying, I think that these things are gonna be able to fool every single one of our tests. And it's gonna come down to like where you believe, you know, what you believe being or a program needs to hit to eventually, you know, trigger one of these definitions. I think you know, lemoyne had a very extreme definition of what it is, but you know, we're, we'll see what happens as we,\n\nSteven Levy (00:23:34):\n\nYeah. I mean, every, every time, I mean, I've talked to him a lot over the past few months, but every, I begin every conversation with, you know, like, are you, you know, can you, do you really believe this? Or is this some sort of performance thing? <Laugh>. Cause he couldn't, he couldn't do better if he were doing the latter. You know, and it seems to me a stretch to, you know, and he's a super intelligent person to say that something like that at this point is sentient, I think to, if he were doing performance art, I, it brings up a larger question of what sentient is and right, because you can't really look into the brain of another person and detect when they make a sentence that that sentence came from a sentient person or, you know was generated by some sort of, you know, algorithmic creation. Like J p T four sentence is a sentence, right? Mm-Hmm.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:34):\n\n<Affirmative> years ago. Is that a thing? Years ago when Ray Ksal had written the book, the Singularity is near, I interviewed him and I, and I I asked him kind of this question and he says, well, it doesn't really matter if you can't tell the difference if a, if a machine is thinking or not, if you can't tell the difference, what does it matter?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:24:54):\n\nThere're gonna be more people that will advance that argument. And I mean,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:56):\n\nDoes it, I mean, what, what do we care if Chad tpt as a soul or is actually thinking if it's coming up with the same response of thinking person would come up with I,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:25:05):\n\nOh yeah, I think we should care. I just can't explain why. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:08):\n\nIt's like, well, that's what I said too. That's an exact, like, that's word for word what I said. Right? I haven't heard, by the way, Ray has not said anything. I think this would be a good argument for the Singularity really is just around the corner at this point, right?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:25:22):\n\nOh, it's definitely closer than it was a few months ago. And you spoke, I mean, I, when I spoke with Bing before, Microsoft decided to, you know, sort of restrain it dramatically before the, that New York Times article, article where Bing fell, fell in love with the colonists, Kevin. Yeah. Supposedly. I love you Kevin <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. Like, that thing was amazing chatting. That with that thing was amazing. It was a revelation, but\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:45):\n\nIt took, it took some prodding. I think one of the things you're seeing universally is that in order to get chat g p t to go off, you have to hack it. You have to jailbreak it. Some people call it, or at least prod it to the point where it starts hallucinating. That's one of the reasons Microsoft is limited the number of questions you can ask in the same topic, because it seems to hallucinate after a period of time,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:26:08):\n\nBut it keeps going up that limit. And by the way, just like humans, right? Humans sort of start off levelheaded, then you proud them enough and then they, yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:14):\n\nYou can make 'em crazy. AI\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:26:16):\n\nActually, like, pretty well mimicking the way that\n\nSteven Levy (00:26:18):\n\nIt's like, it's like King Kong. You put the re restraints on King Kong <laugh> and you know, someone decides they'll loosen the restraints and, you know, bang, it goes, I mean, do you feel good that, you know, they're saying, okay, we put these restraints on it, but then you hear people just trying to jail break, you know G p T four, right? You know, so it's not like the thing is like, like Bill, so it can free of bias and, you know, can, and it won't, you know, do weird personality kind of things. It's, it's like they've saying, well, you know, we've sort of boxed it in and, you know, it'll, you know, hit this invisible fence like, you know, like you do with a dog where, you know, it is all you know, there's electronic boundary. The dog hits it and it's an electric shock and goes back, you know, so you could see it in G B T four. You ask kids about something and it says, whoa, I can't do that. Right. You know, I, you know, you, you told me to do something that's hateful and I I don't do hateful. Yeah. Right. But then you trick it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:20):\n\nThat's <laugh>. It does. Yeah. one of the things for me that's a benchmark is humor. That is notoriously, I think, difficult for machines to understand because it requires so much context and chat. G p t four seems to do pretty well. These are the images released by open AI when they release chat, G p t four. These are pictures of memes, which are humorous, but perhaps challenging for a computer. This one is a picture it's a, it's actually a, a roasting pan filled with chicken nuggets, but arranged to look kind of like a map of the earth. And the, and the mean text is sometimes I just look at pictures of the earth from space and I marvel it how beautiful it all is. It's chicken <laugh>. And then the, the prompt is, can you explain this meme? And it did it, this meme is a joke that combines 200 unrelated things, pictures of the earth from space and chicken nuggets.\n\n(00:28:12):\n\nThe text of the meme suggests the images from the earth. It's actually of nuggets arranged to vaguely resemble a map of the world. I couldn't do better. Here's one of a guy on a taxi cab in New York. You'd recognize this probably happens all the time in Manhattan ironing his shirt as he's strapped to the back of a yellow cab. What's unusual about this image? The unusual thing about this image says chat G B T four is that a man is ironing clothes on an ironing board attached to the roof of a moving taxi. Maybe. I don't know if that's humor or just unusual. This one was tough. This is a a a joke device sold online. It's a lightning cable, but it has an RS 2 32 adapter on it, so you can plug it into your phone. And it looks like your phone has an RS two thirty two port.\n\n(00:28:57):\n\nWhat's funny about this image, the image shows a package for a lightning cable adapter with three panels. Panel one is smartphone with a V VGA connector. Oh, I guess vga, not RS 2 32. Panel two. In fact, I'm trusting, I'm trusting the chat. I'm trusting G P T Oh oh, oh, yeah. Sorry. The package for the lightning cable adapter with a picture of V g a connector on it. A closeup of the VGA connector with a small lightning connector. The humor in this image comes from the absurdity of plugging a large outdated V G A connector into a small modern smartphone charge charging board. Exactly. Right. That to me, more than the touring test or even the Chinese room example shows, that's almost human. That's a hard thing, I think to do. Maybe though our standards are too low,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:29:43):\n\nYou know, you can call it, you could ask like this, it's interesting cause we have this debate. Is it sent to it or not? Is it conscious or not? Doesn't matter if a human like is, if it could get\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:50):\n\nA\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:29:50):\n\nJoke Exactly, exactly this thing, you know, whatever you wanna call it. This thing is smart, and we're now not, we're not gonna be able to make it available in certain ways to the general public. And I think that's gonna be extremely, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:02):\n\nScary. <Laugh> we're\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:30:05):\n\nAwesome or awesome or awesome. Is\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:07):\n\nIt foolish? Is it somebody who's watched too many science fiction movies, too many Terminators and the Foren Project? Is that why we should ignore that? That's a silly fear. Or should we really worry? Elon Musk said he was worried. In fact, that's one of the reasons Open AI was founded. He split with them when they decided to do a for-profit arm <laugh>. He might even be more unhappy now because in this latest release chat, G p t or rather open a AI says, because of the competitive environment, we're not gonna tell you how it works. Which is kind of against the open AI charter, right?\n\nSteven Levy (00:30:42):\n\nYeah, yeah. I, I interviewed Sam Altman and Elon when they first launched Open ai. And let me tell you, that was a wildly different business plan. It was ev it wasn't even a business plan. It was a, a nonprofit, and they said that everything was going to be really open and no patents. And it was\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:03):\n\nA, was it, it was a response to, to Google and others doing closed source development of ai. Elon felt like the safest thing to do is do this in public.\n\nSteven Levy (00:31:13):\n\nRight? Right. And, you know and I I even asked him, I said, well, by releasing this everything open, what if, you know, Dr. Evil got hold of it? And you know, Elon said, yeah, well, that's a good point. We're hoping that then other people who get hold of it would come up with, you know, Dr. Good versions and that would, that that was would dominating. But it, it is a dramatically different thing. I think Elon said when he got out that it was because he was gonna be in conflict with the AI at Tesla. Right? That was before th they did a deal with Microsoft. So but a different kind of thing. And we're really an unknown territory with w with this, and it's exciting and scary.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:01):\n\nEli,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:32:02):\n\nThis is sort of under Go ahead.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:03):\n\nYeah,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:32:04):\n\nI would just say it's underscoring a theme that we've been talking about throughout this, which is important to touch on, which is that, you know, there might be companies that say, we want to do it the responsible way, or companies that say like, we wanna do it open and, and you know, or protect folks. But because this has all really developed, being developed in unison, in so many different places, it will inevitably spill out. And there's not gonna be like one gatekeeper on top of this technology. Like there has been on top of different technologies in the past. Even if Open AI wants to hold onto what, what it's doing, like this is gonna be an open technology. And at this point, like it's, it's, you know, I, and I, I think Steve's written about this too, like, you know, it's sort of out the gate and there's gonna be a lot of people that are gonna be talking about how dangerous it could be. But who knows how, if that's gonna be as useful to us as like seeing it out there and then reckoning with it as it comes versus inciting a panic.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:02):\n\nElon put in a hundred million Microsoft put in a billion and later another 10 billion. I think one thing Sam Altman realized is it's very expensive to do this. He said at first it was 10 x the cost of a Google search. I think now it's closer to a hundred times more expensive than a Google search to run a chat G p t query. It's a lot of computing power. So maybe a a, a nonprofit wasn't feasible.\n\nSteven Levy (00:33:26):\n\nYeah, I think, I think that's really what motivated the move to Microsoft. The, the idea is they needed a partner with a giant cloud and, you know Microsoft was one of the few places that could offer him to. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:40):\n\nMicrosoft is incorporating it into not only, its Bing search, it's been good for Edge <laugh>. A lot of people like myself who would never dream of using Edge are starting to use it just cuz I want to get access to Bing Chat. They also are putting it in office. Google's announced they're gonna put their version of chat G P T, which is called Bard. It's a large language model. We haven't seen it. I think, I think researchers are getting access to it now, but I haven't seen it. They're gonna put that into Google Docs. So in fact they showed a, what was this Microsoft? Maybe it was Microsoft showed a, a presentation, an entire PowerPoint presentation being generated on a simple text prompt. Here's a pdf, make a presentation out of this. It the same cap capability in Google Slides spreadsheet, Google Docs whether we like it or not, it's gonna be everywhere.\n\nSteven Levy (00:34:36):\n\nYeah. Because we need more PowerPoint\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:38):\n\n<Laugh>. Oh boy. Can I get an AI to watch the PowerPoint so I don't have to?\n\nSteven Levy (00:34:44):\n\nWell, that is the interesting thing. I watched that you know event where, you know, they announced how G P t four is going to be in office and all their, you know, productivity\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:01):\n\nAct. They call it co-pilot, which is the same name that you said. Github. Yeah.\n\nSteven Levy (00:35:05):\n\nYeah. And it's kind of interesting because it's going to be generating all these emails and there is this weird power imbalance here. So if, if I'm sitting there interacting with email and you have something that gives me emails that you haven't written, my time is being spent now reading a machine's emails that you know, is basically you sent into motion and you spend no time and I'm spending my time. So what I'm gonna do is turn this over to my right. Automated assistant. Right? So all this stuff will happen and no one will read the emails.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:47):\n\nIt's gonna be the battle of the ais.\n\nSteven Levy (00:35:49):\n\nYes. Yeah. They'll be doing that. And yeah, you have to say, you have to wonder, is there a value to actually doing the work on your own? Right. If I say like hey, I wanna write a paper about X, Y, Z and it like churns out the paper and then, okay, I'm going to like maybe check the facts and, you know, punch up the language a little bit. But and you know, Alex certainly knows this, you know, that there is a value to actually doing the research yourself. Sure, sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:23):\n\nAnd writing is, is a form of thinking.\n\nSteven Levy (00:36:26):\n\nAnd while you're doing the research, you come across something that's saying, wait a minute. You know, here's an interesting path for me to follow mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. and you go and do kinds of other things. So I, I feel you're, you're not going to get the depth of knowledge yourself as a human. You're gonna be able to fake it much better. But it is gonna put a ceiling on your creativity and knowledge by turning over this task to a competent AI assistant.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:59):\n\nI wor I, I honestly a agree with you, and that's why I kind of think I'm both of you are, are falling on the side of this is a revolution. And we are at an inflection point, and I'm a little more on the side of this is a parlor trick. It's mediocre writing, it's mediocre art, it's medi, it's taking tests and doing well, which just shows the, that the tests really aren't very good tests of intelligence rather than, oh, look how intelligence these machines are. I, I don't feel like this is revolutionary in any regard. It's a, it to me, it's a trick. It's a, it's a, it's a clever trick. It's a fascinating trick. But ultimately, I don't know if it's a revolution.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:37:42):\n\nSo then, alright, if it's just a parlor chick a we can establish it. You can't really be afraid of it unless you find\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:47):\n\nParlor. I'm not afraid of it. Scary. Yeah. So that's good. I think it's kind of junky. Okay.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:37:50):\n\nSo good. Let's settle that. And then, you know, the other thing is that sometimes these tricks, like sometimes you talked about mediocrity. I mean, sometimes mediocrity really do the job. Yeah, yeah. And really do the job. Like if I need to illustrate my post and I get a mediocre image generated by ai, like, hallelujah. Like that's gonna be a lot better than the bad image I would get from my stock image or something like that. Or whatever free stock image. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:14):\n\nThat's a good point. There's so much existing human created mediocrity in the world. We can accept the mediocrity of the machine created.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:38:21):\n\nExactly. And listen to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:22):\n\nThis. But that doesn't say much about the machine just merely there's a lot of human media antiquity,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:38:27):\n\nAnd there's a way that you can deploy this stuff. And even if it's mediocre, if it's mediocre and it has a bit of smarts, then that can be pretty interesting. So we just talked about this on my show last week, where somebody made a dating app bot to get them dates, and they designed this bot to learn. And look who knows if this is true or not, but it does seem like something that if it hasn't been developed on the way,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:49):\n\nAgain, back to the mediocre\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:38:51):\n\n<Laugh> Yes. To learn Exactly. <Laugh>, I mean, every dating app, the, the pool is worse than mediocre, right? Yeah. Yeah. And they developed this bot to learn their preferences and actually have conversation with people. And it, it said, this person says in the first month it's scheduled 13 dates for them. And all this was, was all of them were with people that matched their preferences and had similar interests. And like, you know, I think that deploying mediocrity with smarts it's underrated how powerful that can be in this world.\n\nSteven Levy (00:39:20):\n\nThis is March, 2023. A year before this, we got no nothing anywhere close to this. Yes, that's true. That people saw, you know, this, this is just a baseline for what's going to get better and better and better. You know, it took like years and years of chess programs to beat the chess champion. So it's not surprising that, you know, this technology, which really is only, you know as we know it, been around for a couple years when there was some, you know breakthroughs around 2017 and, and, you know, like a better way to, to do this stuff. And it's weird. It's unrealistic to think that mediocre is not going to get pretty good. And then very good. I mean, my big question now is, you know, it's like a, you know, like a blues man could like listen to something and saying, you know, well that doesn't have soul. Right. You know, you know, technically that song is, you know, does it, but it doesn't have soul. My as existential question now is, you know, can something, an output from a large language model have soul? And it's an open question. But I believe the things we're gonna get pretty good, good enough that we're gonna have that argument about something that it, that comes out from him.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:40):\n\nMusic is a very good example. Cause in the early days of synthesizer, it was, you know, very met, you know, metronome like, and, and not very interesting. And I would say synthesizer music is soulful now. Even synthetic music can have soul on it. Here's a picture of Stewart Brand. Kevin Kelly did I think with Mid Journey say he said paint Stuart Braes, Andrew w might, that's pretty dang good. I don't know what else, I don't know what Ws would do these days if he were around, but\n\nSteven Levy (00:41:10):\n\nHe would sue is what he'd do.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:11):\n\n<Laugh> ship out. See, that's an interesting question. So Andrew w the great painter, obviously before he became Andrew w the great painter, went to art school, studied a lot of other painters styles, probably copied them, created his own style based on that. He can't, he shouldn't sue them. You know, as Isaac Newton said, if I've seen farther, it's because I've stood on the shoulders of giants. Is this is, you know, mid journey doing anything different, why should it be? Why should it be in trouble for learning from the best?\n\nSteven Levy (00:41:46):\n\nWell, this, this is actually, and, and I, I have to be careful here cause I'm on the Council of the Author's Guild, which is very interested in I bet this subject. Yeah. Here. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:57):\n\nI, I mean, Tom Clancy's been automatedly writing his novels for some time. Yeah.\n\nSteven Levy (00:42:02):\n\n<Laugh>. So I speak, I speak only for myself, but Okay. But there's a, there's a genuine question here about whether these things have, we'll have the legal ability to do what a person does in saying, I'm gonna read all these things and then, you know, I might be influenced by what I read and then my style might look like someone else's. Right? So if I read a lot of like Tom Wolf books you know, my writing might have a lot of exclamation points, right? And sound like him, but I won't be plagiarizing him. Are. But what happens when we have something that can read everything and, you know are we gonna hold these things to the same standard as a person to say, aha, do you, this this paragraph is exactly the same you've plagiarized? Or is it something where they could basically steal what you do in terms of what we saw with Andrew Wyeth? If you can do Andrew Wyeth as well as Andrew Wyeth, what does that mean for the value of Andrew Wyatt's paintings? Yeah. And these are questions that I think are gonna only be, you know, adjudicated by laws. And right now a lot of people are think are pitching Congress to come up with laws to figure out how to handle this stuff.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:32):\n\nSeems like that would almost certainly be the bad idea at this point since we're so early on. Right. That's what they did with the internet. They let it grow, they let it evolve before we started to really restrict it. I would hope that the same thing would happen here. On the other hand, there is real concern that AI moves so fast, <laugh>, that you're gonna have you know, how 9,000 or worse before the Congress can even, you know, get outta bed in the morning. Go ahead Alex.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:43:58):\n\nYeah, this did happen to me actually. So I did a story about the creator economy that did okay on my CK and then\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:04):\n\nOh yeah, I remember this got picked up,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:44:06):\n\nGot ripped off a few places. Yeah. Yes, exactly. And then I saw on the front page of Hacker News, a story that looked a lot like mine. So I clicked in and I'm like, oh, this is interesting. And I'm reading, and there are exact clauses for my story that are in this story. And I said, oh, well, that's not normal. That's weird. And initially wrote a comment and said, Hey, look, you can't plagiarize my work. That's not cool. The comment got deleted, and then I started to go to read the other comments and the comments on Hacker News, and I realized the author of this story is fessing up to using AI tools in their writing. Now, in this case, it had done such a poor job that it took my story, remixed them, and still left full clauses in. So I knew it was plagiarized, but like, there could be instances where you can remix stories or even at the AI spit stuff out and, you know, is is, you know, just changing a word here or there.\n\n(00:44:59):\n\nAnd it's not like technically plagiarism, but it is like ripped off. So, you know, I do think it's a concern. On the other hand, and I've heard this argument made, and I'm kind of partial to it, you know, I still remain pretty bullish about what these models are gonna do. And one of the reasons why is because, you know, when we started to be able to mass produce products, like, let's say like fancy lamps, you know, if you couldn't get it from an artisan, you might get it mass produced and pick it up at a Kohl's. And that served a portion of the population that may never have gotten it before, gotten these type of lamps before. Meanwhile, we made the artisanal lamp more valuable. And I do think that's what we're gonna see here, where like, yes, is it concerning a little bit as a, you know, a person making the lamp for sure. But I'm hoping that we're gonna see how valuable it is to get that, you know, initial, that initial original work done, and it'll be valued more. Maybe that involves, you know, more content behind paywall, something like that. But ultimately, yeah, it's a pretty interesting thing to tackle.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:58):\n\nI'm glad you brought that up because I got bit by it. I I actually did the AI generated Creator economy story, not knowing it had been ripped off from you. I, I did. So you read it? Yeah, I correct. I corrected myself a couple of weeks later when I saw your post saying wait a minute, this is Alex's original, the Creator Economy was way overblown. It's interesting because the CK newsletter, the rationalist that published your, the plagiarized version has taken that down,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:46:29):\n\nBut, well, actually I have the insight story on that, Leo. So, okay. Initially I wrote to, so Subs has a policy against plagiarism, and I wrote to them and I was like, hello, like, this is plagiarized, can you take it down? And it was different enough that they're like, well, we don't really see how this is plagiarism. Plagiarism, the post stays up. Which to me is absurd. Like, I've been using the platform for two and a half years, one of the first tech reporters to use that platform. Like I've put a lot of, you know, sweat. And\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:56):\n\nIt was blatant, it was the kind of, kind of plagiarism, because you could could see during Direct one for one correspondence between what you wrote and I was like, and what that article had\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:47:03):\n\nExactly. And I was like, how are you siding with this like, publication that was just started and is clearly a plagiarist. And of course subs has it's free speech, ethos, ethos, and that's a conversation for another day. And I generally support that, but not for plagiarism. And then eventually then my story came out and then pointed it out. Yeah. And after taking a look at it from support and pr, then CK wrote me and said, okay, well listen, upon further review, we're taking this down. But that's the thing, the platforms are not gonna be inclined to take this stuff down, and it's so easy to spread. Right. So that's where\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:31):\n\nYou struck. You're lucky at a bully pulpit, you could complain about it. Yeah. That helps. This, this, this person writing this Rationalist subs named Petra is probably an ai, right? I mean, this is somebody's AI experiment, or No, do we\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:47:45):\n\nKnow, I mean, it's definitely, it seems to me like it's a person with AI putting these posts together, but as you can see in the image that you're putting up on the screen right now, they haven't really written a lot since they\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:56):\n\nYeah. They're the only two things.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:47:57):\n\nSo maybe they're at a new\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:58):\n\nAddress. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a, that was a very good example of the hazards of this. And I apologize because I got bit by it. I publicized the fake article.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:48:10):\n\nWell, there you go. I mean, it's like, can you, and, and it never would've been uncovered unless they were, you know, ripping off a, a reporter who wrote about the creator economy and AI and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:20):\n\nWas paying attention enough to, to Yeah, exactly. Say, oh, wait a minute, I\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (00:48:24):\n\nHave an idea of what was happening once I saw it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:25):\n\nYeah,\n\nSteven Levy (00:48:25):\n\nYeah, yeah. So that, that image of Stuart Bra, was that, is there a photo that that was based on Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:32):\n\nNo, you asked, asked Kevin. I don't know where, what must, although you can with my journey, type in a name and if there are enough photos out there, they can, they can generate an\n\nSteven Levy (00:48:40):\n\nImage. Yeah, but I mean, well, you know, I mean the, you know, Getty has a suit now right, that's saying, you know, they, they trained it. So there's a big issue on whether these places are permitted to train on copyrighted images.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:57):\n\nI suspect what'll happen, I hope what'll happen is a robot dot text kind of agreement that you could say in your robot's text No, no. Scanning by stable diffusion or ai. Of course, whether that gets honored is another matter. Yeah, you can tell Google not to spider your website with robots dot text. This is, I asked mid journey to do a image of me watching an F1 race, and it thinks that's what I look like. It's it, I mean, that was by name. So it was sort of close, you know, my mom would know it's not me, but apparently I'm, I'm on the ra I am actually a racer and watching the race, so that's kind of cool. <Laugh>. so I think somebody who's like Stuart Brandt, whose image is, is widely distributed, maybe it did, I don't know. You have to ask, you know, Kelly, Kevin, I, you have to ask him. I don't know where, what he used for.\n\nSteven Levy (00:49:44):\n\nWell, I mean, I don't, I don't think he knows, you know, he doesn't know. He doesn't know. He just asked for the image. Right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:49):\n\nThat's what he got.\n\nSteven Levy (00:49:50):\n\nAnd you know, the question is, you'd have to find something that looked like like in this,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:56):\n\nI could put it in Google image search and see what we get.\n\nSteven Levy (00:49:58):\n\nWell-Known case, whether, whether known case, whether a photo of print that Andy Warhol used.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:03):\n\nThere\n\nSteven Levy (00:50:03):\n\nYou go. Right. Was, you know you know, actually transformed by, you know Warhol coloring it in a certain way and, you know, can presenting in, in, in a certain way to be a different work. And courts,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:19):\n\nNot courts have ruled up to now it's, it's in front of the Supreme Court right now, but the courts have ruled up to now that because the message of the modified version was different than the original, that that was sufficient to say it was derivative. It's a f it's a fair use case. And the Supreme Court is ruling on it Monday arguments in front of the Supreme Court, and a very big story. We're gonna get to that in just a moment. Hashet versus the internet archive, Stephen Levy is here. It's great to have you author of so many great books. Of course the most recent as a, as a look at Facebook right before it changed to meta still well worth reading. It's, it's a great book. He was embedded at at Facebook for three years to write it. And it gives us an idea, I think, perhaps of what's going on today at Facebook because of it. We get some, some idea and of course of the classic,\n\nSteven Levy (00:51:11):\n\nHe had a pretty good idea of the leader. Yeah, I think I interviewed him like nine times,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:17):\n\nOf course. Of the vote. Yeah. Facebook, the inside story. Well worth reading the author of day one. It's always Day one. Mr. Alex Kreitz here, big technology podcast. Got two big thinkers on the show, which is, which is great. We will talk about the publishers in the internet archive. Is it a library when we come back? But first word about our sponsor, eight sleep covers my mattress with the amazing pod cover. And I, I'll tell you I don't wanna live without it. In fact, this is, I should warn you, if you get the pod cover, you're not ever gonna wanna leave home again. You're never gonna want, we're gonna go travel and I'm gonna miss my pod cover. I could tell you that right now. What is it? The pod cover fits over any mattress, allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleep environment.\n\n(00:52:10):\n\nNot just warmer, but cooler. So you get the optimal temperature to give you the best night's sleep. It's a dual zone temperature control. Lisa likes it hotter than I do. She turns hers up, I turn mine down. You and your partner can set different sides of the bed to temperatures as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit. That's chilly. That's like air conditioning for your bed, or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That's like heat for your bed. And I gotta tell you, it changes if it has an autopilot, it's, it knows the room temperature, it senses your movements, your breathing, your heart rate. It knows what level of sleep you're in. And what it does is very cool. So I start mine at a nice cozy temperature, getting beds cozy. I could fall asleep fast, but then as I go into deeper, deeper sleep, it actually lowers the temperature, which facilitates deep sleep.\n\n(00:52:59):\n\nI'm getting about 50% more deep sleep since I put the pod cover in more than a year ago. Then I, I mean an hour and a half instead of an hour. That's a big, big difference. Good sleep, especially that deep sleep is is a health habit. I mean, it will reduce the likelihood of serious health issues like heart disease and high blood pressure. It can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. And this is a health habit that's not hard to stick to. You set it up, it's automatic, it heats it up before you get in bed. I said, I want my bed to be ready by 9:00 PM cuz I might go to bed early. It's nice and warm when I get in and it cools down based on a whole bunch of inputs. It's, it's, it's temperature regulation. And when it's hot in the summer, it's cool.\n\n(00:53:46):\n\nSo you're comfortable. You never wake up in the middle of the night sweating bullets when it's cool at, at night, cuz of winter. It warms you up. In fact, it saves us money cuz I don't have to heat the house or air condition the house at night. I, the eight Sleep pod cover does it for us. Lisa loves it. I love it too. You wake up fully energized after a great night's sleep, wouldn't you like that? Go to eight sleep.com/TWIT right now. You'll save $150 at checkout on the pod cover eight sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK select countries in the EU and Australia. And you just had a hot, hot summer in Australia. Oh, wouldn't it be nice to get in bed? And it's, oh, it's so cool, so comfy, so fresh. Eight sleep, e i g h t s l e e p.com/twit to get that $150 off and to check out the eight sleep and all the other things they sell there.\n\n(00:54:36):\n\nIt's really great product. Kevin Rose told me about it years ago. I ignored him then Amy Webb got it, told me about it. I ignored her. Finally, I broke down. Got it about a year ago. We've gone through now, this is our second winter, all summer, all year round. The eight sleep's great. Eight sleep.com/twit. We're going on vacation in two weeks and I know mine's not gonna sleep as well. I'm just not gonna, it's, it's, it's the only downside. Eight sleep.com/twit. We thank 'em so much for their supportive this Weekend Tech Monday, the United States Supreme Court, 1:00 PM Eastern Time. We'll hear oral arguments in Heche versus the internet archive. It's a lawsuit against the internet archive. The publishers Heche just is essentially representing all publishers don't want the internet archive to, they say they're violating our copyrights to store books. Hase Harper Collins Wiley and Penguin House Ran Penguin Random House claim that the internet archive through its C D L, which is a digital controlled digital lending and allows books to people to check out digital copies of books for two weeks or less, just like a library claim that cdl, the publishers claim CDLs cost their companies millions and is a threat to their business.\n\n(00:56:04):\n\nI'm betting Stephen Levy is a published author of many books. Both of you are, I guess I am too. I don't <laugh> Nobody wants to read my books. But your books are still on the shelves of libraries. Do you hate libraries, Steven?\n\nSteven Levy (00:56:18):\n\nNo, no. I, I love libraries.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:22):\n\nIs the internet CDL a library, I guess is the question?\n\nSteven Levy (00:56:26):\n\nWell, I don't know. I mean, I don't know how, whether you wanna use like a, a term of art to do it, or basically library is a library. I mean, you know, it's got a lot of books. You could say. Okay, it's a digital library. I think what happened here is the, the question is if you're an author you're happy when a library buys your book and lends it out. You will not be happy if a library buys one digital copy of your book and then let's everything, any an unlimited amount of people get hold of it and basically just offers the ebook free to an unlimited amount of people. You know, the, the way the internet library worked, and this run by this guy named Brewster Kale, who's a fantastic person, but during the pandemic, he thought, well, this is an emergency. So previously we only lent one copy at a time, which publishers didn't like either you, because the, you know they're arguing it's different than a physical copy of the book. But even putting that aside was\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:34):\n\nThey was, was the archive buying the e-book?\n\nSteven Levy (00:57:37):\n\nNo, it, it, the got the donation from a library, which did buy them. Oh, okay. Scans the whole library and then has digital versions. Right. So they never went out to the publisher and said, we're buying this ebook. You know, this was, you know an existing copy. It's like, you know, buying a big trench of used books. Right, right. And digitizing it, and the library buys used books. And and the agreement that libraries have with publishers is that they'll get a digital copy, but unlike a physical copy they can only, they can't keep lending it out. They can only lend it out a certain amount of time, which is sort of like way it is now because you can't lend a physical book out a hundred times. They'll get two p help to do it. Right. So I guess as an author, I, I don't want libraries to be so easy to borrow from that.\n\n(00:58:36):\n\nThere's no reason to buy a book anymore. I am happy for a library to offer a copy to it's members when they buy it. And so people, you know, couldn't read the book and, you know, without paying for it in, you know, a a way where the, the rights are represented. But what Brewster did in particular which I think was, I think was objectionable, and, you know, I think he went too far, was he said, you know what, previously we only let out one copy at a time, like a physical copy. But because it's an emergency in the pandemic, we're gonna get rid of that. So basically, if a thousand people wanted to read Facebook, which just came out in the beginning of the pandemic, I don't know if that was part of his collection. But, you know, then an unlimited amount of people can, can get an ebook, which is the exact same thing that they get the ebook that they would've to pay for otherwise. Instead of having to be on a wait list, maybe. But the library only had a few copies. And you, you have to be careful. If there's no incentive for an author to make back their money, then libraries are gonna be empty of new books because authors won't be writing them.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:51):\n\nHas Brewster reverted to the previous method of one book at a time?\n\nSteven Levy (00:59:58):\n\nI'm not hundred percent. I think he has, yeah, I'm, I'm not a hundred percent sure\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:02):\n\nOf that. When I go to the archive.org site on controlled digital lending, it says controlled digital lending is the cdl, is the library practice whereby a library owns a book, digitizes it, and loans either the physical book or the digital copy to one user at a time. So if, I guess, you know, I agree with you. If the only issue is, is this okay? Yes. But to do more than one copy at the time, no. Even though I think Brewster did it with every intent of being you know, humanitarian I wouldn't have so much trouble if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of ache. It seems to be the people are concerned. The EF F for instance as has has filed a motion for summary judgment saying this, this should be put to bed. They did that last year.\n\n(01:00:52):\n\nThey don't, they think it's threatening both to libraries and to the internet archive. They say libraries have paid publishers billions of dollars. This is the EF F for the books in their print collections, and are investing enormous resources in digitization in order to preserve those texts. CDL helps ensure that the public can make full use of the books that libraries have bought and paid for. This activity is fundamentally the same as traditional library lending and poses no new harm to authors or the publisher. Libraries have never been required to get permission or pay extra fees to lend books. As a practical matter. The available data shows that the CDL has not and will not harm publishers' bottom lines. But I see your point. Well, I mean, if it's a brand new book\n\nSteven Levy (01:01:35):\n\nYeah. I, I, yeah. Yeah. I I think that this is something that, you know I wish we had a, a great congress that a, you know, a wise Congress that could come, you know, can figure out what to do with this new twist that technology has offered. Yeah. Because it is, it's a, it is a genuine issue. I, I, I want libraries to thrive. I want people to be able to go to libraries and read my book, you know, and, you know and any book they wanna read. But I wanna make sure that there's an incentive, you know, for authors to keep writing books. So and it is something that requires like a, a wise solution because a digital copy of the book is not the same Right. As a physical copy. So maybe we do need some sort of tweak rather than just say, aha, you know, you know, this is the way it worked previously. It works the same way digitally, when in fact it doesn't.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:02:34):\n\nYeah. I'm almost even here. I mean, if anyone, if you like folks have any understanding of how much work goes into writing a book, you know, they, I think they would understand why the publishers are protesting here. So you can't just take books and make them available to, you know, so many people and then potentially risk a book sales. Because like he saying, like, man, if, if you're not gonna have books that sell, then you're not gonna have PS that pay authors. If you don't have publishers that pay authors, you're not gonna have books. I mean, it's as simple as that. And I understand like the internet has made information free, and there's a lot of good to that. But I also think that through that we have like tended to lose sight of, you know, the creator of the, the rights of the creator of the content.\n\n(01:03:22):\n\nI mean, the fact that this is the fact that I would say the internet archive has risked libraries ability to lend books because of doing what they've done. And an easy way to not to do it is Ted not have done it in the first place, not mess with the system that has been based on goodwill. And the fact that we're here today, to put this on publishers, to me, is kind of a kind of absurd, you know, they're the ones that are producing the books in the first place, you know, how about their rights?\n\nSteven Levy (01:03:49):\n\nI think one sad, sad thing coming out of this is that it is charged that pit authors against libraries, which is terrible because authors really love libraries generally. People who write books spent their youth in libraries, and, you know and it is, you know a a fantastic collaboration between libraries and people, which creates authors. And you know, li you know, we've all been to libraries and, you know, made appearances there and, you know about our books and you know, we, we adore these institutions. You know, I live in New York City, and, you know, I'm furious, the mayor for saying it's gonna cut the budget of libraries. It's terrible.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:40):\n\nTo be completely fair to the publishers. I'm reading from inside higher ed.com in their lawsuit against the internet archive, which could extract millions of dollars from the nonprofit. The publishers claim that the internet archive quote, badly misleads the public and boldly misappropriate the goodwill that libraries enjoy and have legitimately earned. They're not against libraries. In other words the publishers say the archive's efforts to brand itself as a library is part of a scheme to fraudulently mislead People circumvent copyright law and limit how much profit can extract from the e-book market. They describe the internet archive as a pirate site and its business model as parasitic and illegal and characterized controlled digital lending as an invented paradigm that is well outside copyright law. I think that we'll see what the justices say tomorrow.\n\nSteven Levy (01:05:37):\n\nI, I hope, I think that Bruce, you know, I think Brewster's a good guy. I think that he's, you know, he's, he is off base on, you know some of this stuff. But he's, you know, but I, but I, but, but I, I think, I mean, I don't, I don't really like him described as an evil person. No, because\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:55):\n\nHe's\n\nSteven Levy (01:05:55):\n\nNot evil. You. No, I think he, I think he, he is, he is well-intentioned and he's done an amazing thing. The ar the internet archive as an archive has been fantastic. You can go and, and get things which are in public domain, you know, amazing music collections and other things. So I think it would also be tragic if, you know, this fight led to somehow, you know really harming the mission. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:25):\n\nMy fear. Yeah.\n\nSteven Levy (01:06:26):\n\nOf the archive. So,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:28):\n\nI, I, I Brewster too. I, when internet archive began, you know, Brewster was a founder of ways. He sold ways to a o l made some money.\n\nSteven Levy (01:06:37):\n\nAlexa. Alexa, not ways.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:39):\n\nOh, I thought he was ways. He was Alexa. Okay. Yeah. Sold it to a o l, made some money, took the money, and did this thing that was pure public benefit. And I asked him early on, I said, aren't you worried? Cuz they were basically downloading the, as much of the internet as they could, they have petabytes of internet. See, the way back machine is a way to see sites that are long gone. He wanted to preserve this history for all. And he's extended that now to many other forms of media. Many of my old TVs and radio shows are there. And I asked him, aren't you worried about copyright? He said, we'll worry about that when the time comes. <Laugh>. he knew that it was in theory, a violation of copyright. I think he's always wanted to be a library, which is protected in some degree as a fair use thing. Maybe the CDL thing when he, when he changed the rules, was a mistake. You would agree, though, if he'd only said one copy at a time, we got a copy from a library, we're gonna lend out one copy at a time for two weeks. If he'd maintained those rules, this would be okay.\n\nSteven Levy (01:07:41):\n\nI, I, I think there's still issues about you know, because libraries have to read of terms when they license books. They don't buy e-books. They license them. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:56):\n\nAnd I think one of the issues is not, not merely that they're buying that's some\n\nSteven Levy (01:07:58):\n\nMore complicated issue.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:00):\n\nYeah. They're buying a physical book and then digitizing it, making an e-book,\n\nSteven Levy (01:08:04):\n\nWhich is, well, that's, that's the internet archives thing. And, you know, can it be fair to Brewster if an author wants to opt out, you can do that. You can say, keep me out of this. But, you know, most authors don't know about that. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, so he, you're in by the default,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:08:22):\n\nI'm sure Brewster's a good guy. And look, the road, the Road to Hell's Paved with good intentions. And I know it's cliche, but it does certainly apply here. And the fact that you have so many books being able to lend out emergency or not, like we can all agree whether one, you know, whether it's okay or not, that one book is lent out as a debate, but the fact that so many were being lent out, you know, without agreements, like, that's why we're here today. That's why this is a discussion.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:47):\n\nI'm gonna have to get Brewster and some people from the internet archive on to talk about this. Meanwhile, tomorrow you can listen to the oral arguments and if you go to archive.org and look at their blog, blog.archive.org, you'll see that during the proceedings, they're gonna host a live blog hosted by Library Futures with library and copyright experts, Michelle Wu, Kyle Courtney, and Dave Hansen. And then they'll have a live discussion with those three afterwards. So if you are interested in this it would probably be worthwhile listening to these. It's, it's fascinating. You know, we've been paying attention to the Supreme Court this year, cuz they have a lot of cases in front of them that will have impact the internet and technology dramatically, including Gonzalez versus Google. This is another one, so worth listening to. And yeah, I don't know where I come down on this. I really don't. I, the internet archive deserves maybe a little extra protection, even if they did something bad. Because I think it's so important, and I don't think anybody else is doing what Brewster is doing, and I don't, and I think that a lot of our history is lost or would be lost if the internet archive didn't exist. So I, well,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:10:02):\n\nIf it's collateral damage here, like no matter the file, if it's collateral damage here, that would be real tragedy. And Yeah. You know, I know I'm, I use it in my work all the time. I'm sure Steve uses it all the time as well. Regular internet users love going back and seeing how websites have changed and websites that aren't there anymore, looking at broken links. This is definitely like by no stretch of the imagination. This is a very important website, a very important service. And again, sort of then makes you wonder why it would risk so much to do something that was so unnecessary.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:32):\n\nWell, that's Brewster in a nutshell. <Laugh>, I don't think it would exist if Brewster didn't have taste for risk, or at least a willingness to accept risk. Here is the American Library's Collection, which has 3.6 million volumes in it. I don't know if this is part of the dispute, but I should, I should,\n\nSteven Levy (01:10:53):\n\nYou know, there, well, any book in the public domain there's no issue. Right, right. You at all. We have a big problem, what are known as Orphan Works, which are right. Works that are still in copyright. But you know, because our copyright is so long too long, a lot of people think you know it's under copyright that the author is unreachable or dead. The, the book's no longer in print and people have been, are asking Congress for years to come up with some sort of scheme where those books could, could become available. And that hasn't happened.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:31):\n\nYeah. did you request that they not carry your books? Steven?\n\nSteven Levy (01:11:37):\n\nWell, Bruce just said to me, Steven, if you wanna, you know, opt out then, and I said, yeah, I'll opt out.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:42):\n\nYeah. Cuz I noticed they don't have any of yours. Yeah. So I didn't even know what Opt Out was a possible Well, that's the problem. This show. Yeah. That's the problem. And there have been, you know I think Larry Lessig proposed a solution to the Orphan Works, which is just say, you wanna renew the copyright, give me a buck. And you know, most Right. Most Orphan works would then be, you know, released into the public domain as a result, because most authors aren't around to give him a buck.\n\nSteven Levy (01:12:07):\n\nYeah. Originally copyright required a a renewal. Right. But you know, the big forces, and, you know, that argued for, you know, you know, the Mickey Mouse Protection Act, whatever it was called got rid of that. I mean, you know, so you know, it, it's a, as an author, I feel, you know you know, a book that I write should not be, you know, any kind of annuity for grandchildren. Right. right.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:36):\n\nYou know, but at some, but you wanna get the <laugh>. It's a, it is a lot of work. I, I will vouch for that. That's why I stopped writing them. This is, so this is Stephen King's this is The Shining. It is a copy scanned from the Denver Public Library. It even says no longer property of the De Denver Public Library, and it's clearly a scanned paperback. I would submit this is a crappy experience if you know, so I have to use my account to get the rest of this. But honestly it'd be worth it to me to pay five bucks to buy The Shining, then to read this on a screen in a scanned form. So I don't, I doubt that Stephen King lost much money based on this. But it, but what is important is it saved for scholars and historians for years and years and years, generations. Right. Because it is scanned, it is saved. So when there are no paper books extent, it will survive. At least that's the theory. I don't know. I have mixed feelings about this. I'll be very interested to see. I suspect this is gonna be a interesting argument for tomorrow in front of the Supreme Court. Let's talk about TikTok <laugh>.\n\n(01:13:53):\n\nThis has been good because I I have given both of you a chance to say how you feel about two different issues, both of which I disagree with you on, but you've persuaded me in both cases that AI is not a parler trick, and that maybe Brewster did go a little too far with the, the library. Let's see how you feel about TikTok. We are kind of on the edge of the extinction of TikTok in the United States. According to TikTok president Biden has ordered the FTC to Force Talk's Sale and failing that to a US company and failing that to ban it in the us. This is, of course, is because TikTok is owned by Bite Dance, which is a Chinese company. And there's concern about influence. The Chinese government might have on bite dance and about privacy.\n\n(01:14:45):\n\nAnd the, and the information gleaned from TikTok I've said for a long time, well, if they really cared about that, they might shut down all the data brokers because the Chinese government can go right to the data brokers and get even more information than they get from TikTok. The propaganda thing is another issue. I mean, that's part of the presumed threat of TikTok is that somehow the Chinese government could influence the videos you see on TikTok to make you be more of a fan of the Chinese Communist Party or something. I'm not sure exactly how that would work. Now TikTok is not going down easy. First of all, there is an issue about of whether the Chinese government would allow the sale. It's thought the Chinese government to say, well, absolutely not. Tiktok, according to Politico, is planning to flood DC with influencers because there are a lot of people, a lot of young people, and I'll include my son who make their living on TikTok.\n\n(01:15:40):\n\nMy son started putting videos on TikTok a couple of years ago of sandwich making under the under the tidal salt underscore Hank, he's gotten to two, two plus million subscribers, makes a good living on advertising sold to that platform. He's been smart enough to, and I asked him, I said, what are you gonna do when they shut down TikTok? He said, well, I've, I've moved a, I have a million people on Instagram. I'm on YouTube, and I've got a cookbook and a TV show in the works. So he's, he's uses a launchpad. But that doesn't mean that some kid today starting out on TikTok is gonna be able to do that. Should TikTok be shut down? A question for our panel. I'll start with you, Alex Kreitz.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:16:22):\n\nOh, that's a tough one. I mean, I would not shut it down right now. I'd like to see a foul from TikTok before we shut it down on speculation. I can definitely see the motivation to do it, right? Like, why can us companies not operate in China? Well, companies from China can operate here. It is a bit of a, you know, a disconnect here. And, you know, there are, the fears are real, right? Like, and I think it's not that like we're gonna get Chinese Communist Party propaganda, but that maybe the someone in the Chinese Communist Party could want to create some cultural phenomenon in the US and be able to do it within TikTok, because TikTok is a culture setter. So I think that's a, a real fear. But again, I'd like to, I'd like to see a foul. And the reason why I'd like to see a foul before we start to see action for the reason that you bring up, which is that there are lots of people who have invested a lot of money into TikTok, and there's a real economy that exists on that, on that platform, your son included.\n\n(01:17:20):\n\nAnd, you know, I think that if we shut it down, we could cause harm in that, in that area, and really harm small business owners. I know myself, like for the podcast, I invested a good deal in TikTok. And of course I've tried to move to YouTube and, and other platforms, and my main platform is audio. But we're on TikTok, and I don't like the idea that that money is now gone. So I think it would be premature to do it. But I do understand the rationale why, and I also think that very well, not very quickly, but sure enough, most Americans would forget about TikTok and move to YouTube or Instagram like you were talking about, or any other app, because all the social media apps now resemble TikTok in a ban would, you know, inevitably just push everybody elsewhere. And, you know, we wouldn't actually like, lose real innovation because that innovation now exists elsewhere on social media. So very, very tricky conversation. Again, I I do think it'd be premature right now, but I understand the inclination, and I'm very curious to see how this plays out. Should\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:24):\n\nThey shut down TikTok? Steven?\n\nSteven Levy (01:18:27):\n\nI'm not sure. I think Al Alex pointed out something, you know that I've been thinking for a while. You know, and I, I really saw this in action when I wrote about Google and its experiment in China that an American company operates in China. They cannot own their own subsidiary. It has to be more than 50% owned by a, a Chinese partner. And I think it'll be interesting if we said that in countries that have that re you know, restriction, they can't own, you know, have operate their subsidiaries in America without an American partner owning more than a half of it. That might be an incentive for them to, you know, release that unfair reg regulation in terms of privacy and the other worries. I would like us to get some actual privacy legislation that would not only affect TikTok, but all the other social media companies. And maybe that would address some of the fears that we have about TikTok. If we were able to, you know, we got protections of what people do with data and if they violated those protections and, you know used it to, you know, identify dissidents of the Chinese government and go after them or whatever they would be subject to penalties under American laws that affect all companies.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:53):\n\nWhat neighborhood in New York do you live in <laugh>,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:19:56):\n\nSteve. It sounds like there's a, a serious catastrophe going on inside your house tonight.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:01):\n\n<Laugh>. Is it all on?\n\nSteven Levy (01:20:04):\n\nI'm giving, I'm giving you the flavor, the flavor of an urban.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:09):\n\nI, I taste hot dogs in the chestnuts, roasting and, and the and the, and the blood in the streets. Wow. <laugh> is it, but I mean, is it always like this? You're just used to it. You can't\n\nSteven Levy (01:20:21):\n\nEven, yeah. Well, there's a fire station down the street. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:24):\n\nThere you go. Okay. That explains, by\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:20:26):\n\nThe way, isn't it worth bringing up what TikTok says is the share of ownership of TikTok? Oh, what by 10 says is the, the share of ownership 60?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:33):\n\nWell, this is an issue. Yeah. There's a lot of non-Chinese own players. Yeah.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:20:36):\n\nRight. 60% owned by global investors, 20% by employees, 20% by its founders. So this whole, like, you must divest, like how exactly does that happen?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:47):\n\nChief Executive Joe Joe g Chu will be testifying on Capitol Hill on Thursday, so that will be interesting. I can't imagine there's anything he could say at this point that would you know, mollify Congress Chu says that divesting TikTok from its Chinese owners wouldn't offer any more protection than what TOS already proposed. They have Project Texas to move all of their data to Oracle. That's great. That makes me feel a whole lot better. All of the us customers data they want to give the US government oversight on their algorithms that would solve that issue. Right. CFIs, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is really the, the group that could ban TikTok. And they've done this with others. I mean, Huawei is banned in networking equipment. There are quite a few Chinese companies that American chip makers cannot deal with. So there's certainly a precedent\n\nSteven Levy (01:21:47):\n\nFor this. Well, the company, you know, the, the big impetus is being funded by their competitors. So well,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:54):\n\nThere you go. You just said the the Unsayable this is something Facebook would love\n\nSteven Levy (01:22:02):\n\nYou just\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:02):\n\nExactly. So, you know, I mean, you said Alex, that Oh, well, no problem. There's plenty of alternatives. <Laugh>. Yeah. This would be great for Facebook. Do you think they're funding this? I\n\nSteven Levy (01:22:11):\n\nMean, absolutely. I mean, you know, can, you know they've, you know, talked about it. Zuckerberg has, you know, been vocal about saying this, and that's an argument they make to, they're lobbyists, they're Washington people are, are making, you know, they're, they're, they're the ones saying, you know, how can you have this Chinese company involved in people's lives like this? And they, and they're making their competitive goals part of a national security argument. Oh,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:22:42):\n\nThat's true. But it's gonna be tough if they end up banning TikTok. Right. Because Facebook and Google's, their number one argument for why they shouldn't be regulated and why the government should be looking elsewhere is like, well, look, if we're out, then it's gonna be Chinese apps. Yeah. So then if the Chinese apps are gone, then the spotlight is on them. And if in fact, tic-Tac might be, you know, convenient foil, and you know, I, I think that one of the things that we need to talk about here is that like, this is happening in the middle of these CFIs discussions. It's a negotiation. So when you hear the term like, oh, they might get banned, or they have to divest, like, I do think that could potentially be some posturing from the US government to get them to give in more and more. And spending 1.5 billion on data security is like quite a big concession. If you ask me in some of the regulations that you were talking about, Leo, seem common sense. And, you know, it is interesting because then I think about the number, right? 1.5 billion need to be spent to shore this company up. And if anything needs to have a billion and a half dollars spent to make sure that it's secure, then maybe it should, okay. Maybe there are bigger questions here that we need to be asking, because that's a whole heck of a lot of money, of money to spend to ensure something is safe. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:50):\n\nInteresting, there's no accident that Facebook and Twitter and, and YouTube have all tried to clone TikTok and then for them to lobby against the closing of TikTok. It's not a coincidence, is it? We got an alternative come over here, but I do remember, Steven, you're right. Microsoft investing 150 million in Apple in the nineties, just because if Apple went bankrupt Microsoft would really be a monopoly. And so, yeah.\n\nSteven Levy (01:24:19):\n\nYou\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:19):\n\nKnow, I mean, there's a history, there's a precedent.\n\nSteven Levy (01:24:22):\n\nYeah. TikTok is definitely you know, the best argument that Meta has about dominating the social media space. Yeah. So they can, you know say, and, you know, and it's provable that, wait a minute here, this is the most popular social network now. More popular than, certainly more popular in Instagram. I don't, I don't know, just whether the metrics prove it more popular than Facebook itself.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:24:49):\n\nYeah. People spend more time daily on TikTok than they ever have spent on Facebook. Now, of course, it's a little bit different. It's a video app versus a utility, but time spent is the holy grail and social networking and the fact that they're spending more time per day on TikTok. I mean, that says a\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:03):\n\nLot. Yeah. Well, they're eating their lunch, they eating YouTube's lunch, eating everybody's lunch. And it's, so it's very convenient that they're run by the Chinese. So we can, we can, you know, invoke a little xenophobia and, and get rid of the biggest competition. Now you said, let's wait until they do something wrong. There is something that TikTok did that wasn't so good.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:25:23):\n\nOkay, let's talk about this\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:24):\n\nOne. Yeah. They chased, they chased us journalists. They were trying to figure out who was leaking TikTok information to US journalists. So in order to, you know, find out they looked at the location information on their servers of some US journalists. Isn't that exactly the kind of thing people are afraid of?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:25:46):\n\nI don't wanna minimize what happened to the journalists who were involved here, but I, I do think that it is different. And this seems to me like this was the PR operation, trying to figure out who was leaking inside the company. That is a very, very different thing. I mean, you know, it's happened elsewhere, right. And I think that's a very, very different thing than, you know, let's say the Chinese Communist Party trying to find the location information of like, you know, potential like US spies or something else like that. Something that will really, you know, harm national security means sucks that happened in the Forbes or Forbes or Buzzfeed journalists, wherever they were at the time. I'm obviously not in favor. I think it's a disaster, but I don't think you ban a company from a country because of that situation,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:27):\n\nAnd they fired the employees involved and so forth. Exactly. So it's not like they put, this is not hard to prevent that they, they acknowledge that was a mistake. It was a bad thing to do. Yeah.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:26:35):\n\nYeah. It's not the worst case scenario. It's a bad scenario, but it's not that like red alarm, like, oh my God, they're listening to us in the White House situation that you would get concerned about and we shouldn't conflate it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:45):\n\nRight. alright, well this is another one that there's a, there's a sort of damocles hanging over's head right now, and that that thread is getting thinner and thinner.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:26:58):\n\nDo you think they're gonna be band Leo? Let's turn the tables on you,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:03):\n\n<Laugh>. Well, I don't, I think for sure the Chinese government won't allow them, and I don't think logistically it's very easy for them to sell the US division to an American company. And by the way, if you're worried about privacy, which American company would that be? That'd make you more secure and more private\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:27:19):\n\nFacebook hook,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:20):\n\nOracle. Facebook didn't, Microsoft for a while said, man, we were thinking about buying TikTok. I, you know, <laugh>, that doesn't reassure me particularly, but that's, that's, I think it's pretty much safe to say that's not gonna happen. And in fact, I suspect this is why the federal government has said this, because it will then give them, well, we tried but you know, they, they wouldn't do it. So now we're gonna shut them down. I think that's an ominous thing. You said, well, the Chinese shut down Facebook and Twitter in China, but we don't wanna be like that. Do we want a great firewall of the us\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:27:58):\n\nIt's not quite a great, great firewall. I mean, well, it's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:01):\n\nLike the beginning of that's\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:28:02):\n\nA firewall on the top of the internet. But, but\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:04):\n\nI think this would open the door to say, oh, you know, let's make sure no internet traffic goes to China.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:28:09):\n\nYeah. No, Leo, you're, you're exactly right. There's a reason why we haven't done it to this team, and that's exactly why.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:15):\n\nYeah. And I would not quar, I would not quarrel with any government agency that says, no, you can't have TikTok on your government issued phone. That's fine. That's reasonable. The armed services don't let you have Strava on your phone because it was used to figure out <laugh>, we when to map the Pentagon. I I understand that. That's fine. I think, well, I\n\nSteven Levy (01:28:34):\n\nThink as a boon for taxpayers not to have a government employees spending their time\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:39):\n\nGet 'em off TikTok, although,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:28:41):\n\nBut they're on reels anyway, or shorts,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:43):\n\nWhatever, state of Alabama they love YouTube band, TikTok in the state and the state school. The state college banded, even though they had TikTok accounts, their state school paper had a TikTok account. And what ended up happening is the students just said, okay, they turned off the wifi and they used their, their phone internet to, to TikTok. Kids aren't, yeah. Kids are gonna find a way to TikTok. They\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:29:06):\n\nDon't\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:06):\n\nCare. They don't care. They don't see a hazard\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:29:09):\n\nIn the us If you use a V P N to use TikTok, well, okay, you're just using a VPN N to use TikTok. If in China you use a VPN n to use Facebook, you could be in trouble. So, you know, I think that it is very different and it's much more difficult to ban any service in the US because we do have this freedom in this country, which is great, that allows people to do things. Like, I look\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:30):\n\nForward to the Supreme Court arguments where they try to understand <laugh> TikTok this,\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:29:36):\n\nYou imagine trying to go after a student who's VPN their way into TikTok. Like, yeah, it's not, it's just a disaster.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:42):\n\nYeah. Let's take a, a little break. Lots more to talk about with a wonderful panel. We've got Stephen Levy editor at large@wiredstephenlevy.com for all of his great books, including his Facebook book. And of course, if you haven't read Hackers, I don't know why I have an autograph copy of Hackers. It has a pride of place on my bookshelf. Cause that is the greatest book about the genesis of the technology revolution ever written. And as an emax user, I've, I've very much appreciated. Steven, do you, what do you use to write your books? Not emax?\n\nSteven Levy (01:30:14):\n\nNo, no. I, I I had been using Word but I, I jettison word and picked up s Scribner\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:23):\n\nScribner's. Awesome. Good choice. Yeah. And it's because I mean, it's good for articles too, cuz you can keep your notes next to your PS and\n\nSteven Levy (01:30:32):\n\nIt's Yeah, yeah. What I, I, I, you know, it it is, it is terrific. You know, so I did use S Scrivener for the last, for, for the Facebook. Nice. and, you know, you can get all your research on there. And even for a column, I do a column every week called Plaintext. The subscribers get in their I subscribe\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:49):\n\nYeah. Mailbox.\n\nSteven Levy (01:30:50):\n\nYeah. And, you know just, just even for that, you know, like if I do an interview, I'll just drag it in and the research part or and you know, it, it's, it's a very versatile program.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:03):\n\nLiterature and latte.com. Scrivener, what do you use to write Alex?\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:31:10):\n\nGoogle Docs. I'm a Google Docs person. Ah, wow. Google Docs and Apple Notes. I'm Balo Tech as they come.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:15):\n\nSo Apple Notes. So you can like, just write stuff in your, in your Apple Notes.\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:31:20):\n\nOh. So I use Apple Notes for organization and timestamping my interviews. And then I'll like have that alongside Google Docs. So I'll like ti between them, you know, and then also outlining in Apple. And then yeah, move it into Google Docs and then eventually into\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:36):\n\nCk. Nice literature and latte seems to be down right now. <Laugh>, I think we broke it. <Laugh>, let's not break Apple Notes. <Laugh>\n\nAlex Kantrowitz (01:31:44):\n\nCommunity is\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:44):\n\nStrong. <Laugh> our show today brought to you by, Hey, good news, mint Mobile.
