For more than 20 years, Pew Research Center has documented its growth and distribution in the United States. Explore the patterns of internet and home broadband adoption below.\n\nHow we did this\n\nTo better understand Americans’ smartphone and broadband adoption, Pew Research Center surveyed 5,733 U.S. adults from May 19 to Sept. 5, 2023. Ipsos conducted this National Public Opinion Reference Survey (NPORS) for the Center using address-based sampling and a multimode protocol that included both web and mail. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race and ethnicity, education and other categories.\n\nPolls from 2000 to 2021 were conducted via phone. For more on this mode shift, please read our Q&A.\n\nHere are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology­­­.\n\nInternet use over time\n\nWhen Pew Research Center began systematically tracking Americans’ internet usage in early 2000, about half of all adults were already online. Today, 95% of U.S. adults say they use the internet.\n\nInternet use\n\n% of U.S. adults who say they use the internet\n\nNote: The vertical line indicates a change in mode. Polls from 2000-2021 were conducted via phone. In 2023, the poll was conducted via web and mail. For more details on this shift, please read our Q&A. Refer to the topline for more information on how question wording varied over the years. Respondents who did not give an answer are not shown.\n\nSource: Surveys of U.S. adults conducted 2000-2023. Data for each year is based on a pooled analysis of all surveys conducted during that year.\n\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nWho uses the internet?\n\nFor some demographic groups – such as young adults, those with at least some college experience and those from high-income households – internet usage is near universal.\n\nInternet use by age\n\n% of U.S. adults who say they use the internet, by age\n\nNote: The vertical line indicates a change in mode. Polls from 2000-2021 were conducted via phone. In 2023, the poll was conducted via web and mail. For more details on this shift, please read our Q&A.

Polls from 2000-2021 were conducted via phone. In 2023, the poll was conducted via web and mail. For more details on this shift, please read our Q&A. Refer to the topline for more information on how question wording varied over the years. White, Black and Asian adults include those who report being only one race and are not Hispanic. Hispanic adults are of any race. Respondents who did not give an answer are not shown.\n\nSource: Surveys of U.S. adults conducted 2000-2023.

Polls from 2000-2021 were conducted via phone. In 2023, the poll was conducted via web and mail. For more details on this shift, please read our Q&A. The Center has used several different question wordings to identify broadband users in recent years, which may account for some variance in broadband adoption figures between 2015 and 2018. Our survey conducted in July 2015 used a directly comparable question wording to the one conducted in January 2018. Refer to the topline for more information on how question wording varied over the years. “High school or less” includes both “Less than high school graduate” and “High school graduate.” The 2021 and 2023 samples are too small to separate these two categories. Respondents who did not give an answer or gave other responses are not shown.\n\nSource: Surveys of U.S. adults conducted 2000-2023.

Even since that rapid growth, increasing shares of Americans have access to broadband internet. Today, eight-in-ten U.S. adults say they subscribe to a broadband internet service at home.\n\nHome broadband use\n\n% of U.S. adults who say they subscribe to home broadband\n\nNote: The vertical line indicates a change in mode.

Those with lower levels of income and formal education are less likely to have broadband service at home.\n\nHome broadband use by age\n\n% of U.S. adults who say they subscribe to home broadband, by age\n\nNote: The vertical line indicates a change in mode.
