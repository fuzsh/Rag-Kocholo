You're going to have fun today. We're all going to have fun. Glenn Fleischman is joining us all the way from Seattle. Glenn.fun, the best website URL in the world. Good to see you, Glenn.\n\nGlenn:\n\nNice to see you. Glad to be here.\n\nHost:\n\nWe're going to get a double dose of Glen this week, because you're going to be on this week in Google as well.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThat's right. I'm sure I'll have a whole different set of things to talk about by then.\n\nHost:\n\nOh yeah. Actually this panel is great because sometimes you get a panel and they're, you know, experts in a particular field and then that's all you hear about this one. This panel is so eclectic. They're all autodidacts, they're into all sorts of things. Well like Christina Warren film girl, who's into sneakers, obsolete swag, and happens to be a senior dev advocate at GitHub. Hello, Christina.\n\nChristina:\n\nHey Leo.\n\nHost:\n\nYou've been traveling like crazy. What's that all about?\n\nChristina:\n\nTravels back, man. Right? What can I say? I mean, not for everyone, obviously at all, like I'm not trying to imply that. I did my first international trip in two years, in over two years actually. So I was, I was in Copenhagen for a team summit, which was great. So I got to meet a lot of GitHubbers and hubbers as we call them in real life, which was amazing. And then I was in Tel Aviv for five days doing some community events and speaking at a startup conference and meeting just a lot of incredible people. So I've forgotten how to do the whole international travel thing. I'm not as much of a jet setter as Mike who we're going to talk to me in a second, but I have experienced and I've sort of forgotten how to do it. So coming back from the jet lag, hence the what hair and the hat I'm, I'm just like what day is it.\n\nHost:\n\nThat's fine although I'm so sorry to hear that Adidas is now out of business.\n\nChristina:\n\nI know. Isn't it a shame? Isn't it a shame.\n\nHost:\n\nShe is clothed in, oddly for her, articles of apparel advertising an existing company.\n\nChristina:\n\nAn existing company. A company that's thriving, actually. You can't really tell too much from the coloring because the lighting in my office is terrible because I'm renovating hence the wrong camera and stuff, but this is a rose gold hat. Yeah. So that I had to be fun brand.\n\nHost:\n\nBecause you are only products with rose gold.\n\nChristina:\n\nBasically.\n\nHost:\n\nAll well look at the shoes. Show her shot one more time because I see some rose gold shoes right over there.\n\nChristina:\n\nYou can see some, I've got a lot of my sneakers up. Like I said, I've renovated my office, so, but it's not quite done yet.\n\nHost:\n\nYou should have a sneaker rack. Also with us, another traveler Mike Elgan, home briefly our gastro nomad gastronomad.net and elgan.com. Hi Mike.\n\nMike:\n\nHey Leo, how are you doing?\n\nHost:\n\nWe were hoping to have you in studio, but I think due to the... What happened, I thought we were done with COVID due to this increase in COVID we're just trying to be a little more cautious. I don't want to get it because we're going to do that TWiT cruise in two weeks.\n\nMike:\n\nThe bad news is I was bringing you a sweet bottle of sparkling of Pét-Nat rosé from [inaudible 00:05:21]. It's a new wine, but don't worry. I'll save it for you.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd we're still using the olive oil you brought us last time and I still have a half bottle of that great repasado mezcal. So it's fine. We'll survive. I do appreciate the gift.\n\nMike:\n\nYou can finish the half bottle tonight.\n\nHost:\n\nMike is very generous. So when do you hit the road again?\n\nMike:\n\nWell, we're actually going to Oaxaca to visit friends. We're not going to do an experience.\n\nHost:\n\nWe did the gastro nomad in Oaxaca for Halloween, for Day of the dead. That was incredible.\n\nMike:\n\nWe're being joined by my son, Kevin and his wife, Nadia and squishy face. We're going to introduce them to all our friends there. So it's going to be really great. And then we have, after that we have Provence experience, Prosecco experience and I'm sorry we have Provence, Barcelona then Morocco this year.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd you're just coming off of a Provence. Wow.\n\nMike:\n\nYeah. But it's great fun. And this is our first fall Provence experience. So it's going to be a lot of wine making and the harvest and all that stuff.\n\nHost:\n\nIf you don't want to hear about travel, don't follow Mike Elgan on Twitter because-\n\nChristina:\n\nFor real. Yeah.\n\nHost:\n\nJust makes you jealous. That's all.\n\nChristina:\n\nI was going to say, just become like very jealous of all the amazing places.\n\nHost:\n\nWell, you don't get to be jealous. You travel a lot so.\n\nChristina:\n\nWell, I mean I used to, but yes, but even so I love watching what Mike does, living vicariously.\n\nHost:\n\nI will not put you on the spot because you do work at GitHub. GitHub is in the news. Actually golly is saying there was a great talk during Git burger, she went to Git burger where you were talking about co-pilot the guy had a conversation with co-pilot and then it started interviewing itself.\n\nChristina:\n\nIt was hilarious. It was so funny.\n\nHost:\n\nWow co-pilot is... So it's well known that coders are lazy. And the last thing any coder, and I'll include myself, wants to do is rewrite code, somebody else has already done all the hard work. That's why stack overflow is so popular. It shows up in your Google searches. And so much code is copy and pasted from sources like stack overflow. Microsoft about a year ago, introduced an auto code generator, an AI based auto code generator called co-pilot that... I'm going to do it charitably. Although there's some controversy over this now, that goes through open source code. So when you post code on GitHub and you have a public repository and it's open source, it's open source. It's kind of free for all. So it used that as its machine learning data set. And then now you can in plain English, plain language, I guess not just English, plain language, say I want to code a login page and it will offer you some code.\n\nHost:\n\nYou say the language it'll offer you some code. And oftentimes that code is very good. Not everybody's taken as well to this as some. Many people I know who use it are thrilled with it. TNW says GitHub copilot works so well because it steals open source code and strips credit. And there is definitely one side of the argument that people are a little bit upset, software freedom conservancy, which is a nonprofit community of open source advocates, said it's withdrawing from GitHub because it's unhappy that open AI and Microsoft trained Git co-pilot on published data on GitHub. I think that's a reasonable thing to do. And I don't know if you could give credit. I don't want to put you on the Christina, so I'm not going to ask you, but-\n\nChristina:\n\nSorry, go on.\n\nHost:\n\nI know that if you could, you would give credit, but honestly I don't think machine learning works quite that way. You can't say this is where it came from, so thank you.\n\nChristina:\n\nRight. Well, unfortunately I can't comment too much on this. I'm not like, I don't know enough. I'm not paid enough to be the one to comment on this stuff. Although I think there are lots of interesting questions and conversations to have around this issue. The only thing I would say is I do think that there is, obviously there's one interpretation of how things work. I think that it's important to realize that this is at least the way it's supposed to be used. Can you convince things to maybe put output like an exact string? Yes. But in general this is the sort of thing that's helping you kind of create functions that are specific to your code.\n\nHost:\n\nLet me ask you since you are an expert in co-pilot. So I wont ask you to comment on the controversy, but let me ask you how it works. So I will type in login page or whatever. Does it give me code that is runable or is it typically just code that you might use as an inspiration for your own code?\n\nChristina:\n\nIt depends. And obviously it's going to learn based on what code it has of yours and what you've been doing with it. So some of it you can do where you're wanting to look for a specific thing, but in most cases, what it is you're already writing a function or you're already writing something. And if you start to, for instance, put in something like a Twitter API sort of thing, if you wanted to log in with Twitter, for instance, and it has that block of code that it knows could be used in a language you're using, then it could auto complete that.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd that makes sense. You don't want to rewrite that. It's frankly, somebody wrote it, but it's not so proprietary. It's not such a clever thing that they own the idea. That's what anybody would write if they're writing code to access Twitter's API.\n\nChristina:\n\nRight. And then the idea is that the more you use it and the more it kind of learns from what you're doing, it can do some translation stuff. This is just still kind of in the beta phases where you could even translate how code works if you're writing in Python to JavaScript or to Java or something like that, which is actually kind of incredible because then you could do a lot more things, but the idea is not that it's like spitting out verbatim something that would be like a complete code block. That's not what it's doing. And this is why it's called your co-pilot. It's not doing it for you. It's helping you out and giving you suggestions based on what you're trying to accomplish and what the other code that you've been using in your project does and says.\n\nHost:\n\nThe open source community has been a little prickly about Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub since it happened some years ago. At first I think a lot of people Git, which is the underlying process for GitHub Git is just a source code repository versioning system that is widely used, it was created actually for Linux. I think Linus actually created it. It is available. You could run your own Git server. You could go to Git lab, you could use GitHub.\n\nChristina:\n\nIt's decentralized we just usually use it on centralized systems, which is sort of ironic, but it is actually, as you said-\n\nHost:\n\nOne of the benefits of Git is all the code is saved everywhere. Everybody has it now. So it's kind of more like blockchain in that sense. It's not centralized at all, but when Microsoft bought GitHub, a lot of people say, oh, I'm going to GitLab or I'm going to run my own. And I noticed it is, if not bigger than ever, it's certainly as big as ever. And almost all open source projects are on GitHub. I put all my stuff on GitHub. It's where I store my blog backups. It's an amazing service you could do so much for free.\n\nHost:\n\nSo I'm a fan. And I think Microsoft's been a good steward. And I think putting you, by the way, senior dev advocate helps, in my opinion, make them a good steward of GitHub. It's interesting that the software freedom conservancy has such a strong opinion about this. They say give up GitHub, the time has come like the wicked witch of the west, surrender. I don't think that's reasonable at all. I think there is a reasonable controversy over what does it mean to use an open source data base of code as the training set for your AI?\n\nGlenn:\n\nWell, it's tricky though. This gets us, you know, we can leap across to the does AI think already? Is it sentient? And you say, how does a coder learn to code? We typically learn. I mean, very few people... Gosh, I don't know these days though, people do code academies in all these different kinds of systems. You actually go and do boot camps and things. You study computer science in college. What have you. But I still think a lot of people learn the nitty gritty of coding. The actual work that gets put into production is by observing other people's code within your company or project.\n\nHost:\n\nOh, absolutely.\n\nGlenn:\n\nSo if an AI, I mean, this is where we get into if you are using machine learning, this gets us into where does creative commons have to go? And where do open source licenses have to go? Because if training sets are now things that are openly available to anybody, but if they're used in a certain way, they need to have credit. Some creative commons licenses, some open source licenses state specifically that remixed versions or adapted versions have to be available as freely as the original. And there's been lawsuits about that have typically been decided in the favor of open source projects, where a company takes something, they transform it and they don't provide it back, even though they're shipping products based on it.\n\nHost:\n\nThis happens all the time. In fact, Donald Trump's social network...\n\nMike:\n\nTruth social.\n\nHost:\n\nIt's basically taken Mastodon on without credit. It is a Mastodon code base, which is an open source project.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut if you can learn, so if we have machine learning models, I'm not a copyright lawyer. I spent a lot of time thinking and interviewing people about it, is if you have code that's available to use for learning and you don't need to attribute it unless you release projects based on it does an AI model that writes code for you that's also figuring in aspects of your own code into what it produces, is that a form of learning that is not covered by say a share alike license or something similar or not. And I think the answer right now is no it's not. It's very clear cut. And if you're using identical code, if you get back to that clean room thing where you're writing code and you can't look at the original.\n\nGlenn:\n\nSo are we trying to move to that where the FOSS stuff is in a clean room? And AIs can't look at it unless all the FOSS licensing is entirely, you don't have to do downstream recontribution of these modified projects. It's funny I think it actually brings up both ethical and copyright issues at the same time that there aren't clear answers to. I mean you should provide as much attribution as possible and that may not always be possible in the way these things are being shared.\n\nMike:\n\nThis is an important point because this is something we are going to be dealing with increasingly as more AI tools come online, people use them more and more. The point is that for the time being and possibly forever, the responsibility for adhering to the license for example is with the developer, no matter what tools they use. So if copilot shows a developer some code and they're just copying and pasting it or whatever, they're still responsible for making sure they don't file the license and copy and so on.\n\nHost:\n\nThey don't know where the code came from because copilot is not giving you any attribution.\n\nMike:\n\nTherefore they should not be copying and pasting it. This should be advising them about a methodology to go forward and write their own code or whatever. But the point is that just because this tool exists doesn't get the developer off the hook for adhering to the license that they agreed to.\n\nHost:\n\nThat's a really interesting question.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI like that. That's a different angle or not even a different angle, but it means there's a lot of stuff where it's the ask permission later issues. And I'm not saying that copilot is necessarily in this category, but a lot of AI training databases, both used for commercial purposes, like facial recognition, but also for things like Dolly and these other projects, they have to practically come up with an IRB statement of like, depending on the institution creating it, or they should have to, what is the harm done when I do this? Am I using people's real faces? Am I using work that's covered by copyright and using it in a different fashion than the copyright license requires? I don't think we have clarity on that yet.\n\nGlenn:\n\nAnd it takes me back to, there's a photographer back in, I was working for Kodak briefly in the early nineties and came up to this teaching center we had, and he was still complaining about how someone had, they wanted to license one of his famous photos of something and somebody, some jazz artist and they declined. He declined to license it. And so they hired somebody to trace over it and create a piece of artwork that was a hundred percent derivative. I mean, this is like the Shepherd Ferry's hope poster with Obama. Very similar. And so that kind of thing, like is an AI that remixes source material that is licensed in a broad way, but not for say remix without attribution or you know, for commercial purposes, whatever, if you have an AI output of that for a new image, are you violating some law? Are you violating people's copyright?\n\nHost:\n\nWas that that Miles Davis? The Miles Davis report?\n\nGlenn:\n\nYes, well there's the whole thing with no I don't want, I, Andy Abejo is a friend and this is not his, this is actually the same. This is the same photographer now that I realize it. It's not that situation. There was some kind of blue and some kind of bloop. I think Andy was in the right. Andy was right there.\n\nChristina:\n\nI think that was completely transformative. But anyway.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThis was the same photographer whose name will come back to me. Famous jazz-\n\nHost:\n\nJeffrey B Sedlik.\n\nGlenn:\n\nNo, no.\n\nHost:\n\nBecause he has the famous Miles Davis portrait and he is now suing Kat Von D the tattoo artist.\n\nGlenn:\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nHost:\n\nBecause she made a tattoo. It's the first time ever. There's been a lawsuit over copyright over a tattoo.\n\nGlenn:\n\nOh my gosh. Holy cow. Well, see, this is where it takes to, there's some kind of blue, some kind of bloop is-\n\nHost:\n\nI remember some, the whole thing over some kind of bloop. Yeah.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThe photographer, Steven Meisel.\n\nHost:\n\nMeisel. That's who it was. Yes.\n\nGlenn:\n\nHe was down in the Bowery of this old bank building that he had all this stuff in. Anyway, Steven was copyright maximalist about his own work. And so in the case that I'm talking about, someone had literally traced something and produced it as an art that was directly identical, very much like the hope poster. And with the Andy Abejo thing, he had done a transformative work that absolutely felt well within transformative rights and fair use. And he got essentially sued into having to back off on it, which is a shame.\n\nHost:\n\nYeah. He created a kindofbloop.com, which is still up yeah. An eight bit tribute to the classic Miles Davis kind of blue album, one of my favorite albums of all time. And this is what, by the way, this is what he had to do with the picture, from the cover. Kind of blue. He had to make it so derivative that it's not even recognizable at this point.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI mean, it's great because we're actually, you got these cases like that. And I think it applies directly to co-pilot even though co-pilot is involving code that has broad copyright licensing. I mean, we're a new territory and I feel like I've faced this every day, both in like the historical work I'm doing where I'm carefully looking at the lines of like, well, this work was produced, I mean, literally this work was printed in 1956. I need to check and see was the copyright renewed so I can cite it in 2022 without worrying that I'm going to be sued over copyright infringement and using it, or something that was created yesterday and it says, creative commons, 4.0 non-commercial. And I've read the non-commercial license so many times. And I don't know that there's a bright enough line between including something in an editorial project as illustration and what I think is a stated intent, which is like selling a calendar with photos that are all drawn and they're used commercially. Right. So I feel like-\n\nHost:\n\nIt's complicated.\n\nGlenn:\n\nArea. Yeah. A lot of-\n\nHost:\n\nAnd we get in trouble all the time because of a very aggressive content idea on YouTube, I still have a TWiT episode that is off YouTube, was yanked from YouTube, because I had the temerity to show the video of the queen having tea with Paddington the bear, which was showed at her platinum Jubilee. Was on newscasts. We were doing it as a news story, but the people who own the rights to Paddington the bear did not like it. And they still don't like it.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThe house of Windsor was fine with it.\n\nHost:\n\nThe queen didn't mind. It was the house of Paddington. They're very sticky. This is the original kind of blue J Meisel famous picture.\n\nGlenn:\n\nJ Meisel, I'm sorry. Steven Meisel is a different photographer.\n\nChristina:\n\nI was going to say Steven Meisel is a fashion photographer.\n\nGlenn:\n\nAnyway. Exactly. That's right. I says, Jay. I like Jay too. It was the point.\n\nHost:\n\nI love his stuff.\n\nGlenn:\n\nWhen this came out, he was a really interesting guy. He was really great in classes. And then this thing came out. I'm like, oh, not that guy. That's not the guy. But you know, when you're ripped off your whole career, if you're ripped off a lot, then you develop the callous about it and you start to push back against anybody trying to use your work. I think the FOSS community, I keep bringing it back to this, but I think the FOSS community has a sense of that because they have had to fight in so many cases where there should be appropriate things. And then it's funny, I'll get a new product these days and something with wifi or whatever. And it has nothing in it, no manual, except there'll be a tiny printed manual. I mean, there's no like user manual and all it is like 50 pages of FOSS and other copyright. You know, open source creative commons just to comply with the law or comply with the licensing terms. And I think hooray, they're doing it right. But it's also kind of funny.\n\nHost:\n\nI learned that my TV ran Linux because the manual had one page that was relevant. The rest of it was FOSSless. Maybe you can answer this Christina, because there's no question, according to GitHub's terms of service quote, \"You give GitHub the right to host your code and use your code to improve their products and features.\" By hosting on GitHub open source or not, you're allowing them to reuse your code. So I don't think there's an issue of stuff that's posted on GitHub. Does co-pilot pull source code from other sources or is it entirely GitHub based? Do we know?\n\nChristina:\n\nThat I'm actually not sure about. I don't know what the basis of the model is. And so I'd have to like look into seeing like what because open AI, those are the folks, they've used GPT3 and obviously the model to kind of create this, but I'm not exactly sure what the entire corpus is. I think that it's just GitHub, but I honestly don't want to comment too broadly because I don't know. There could be other things that are used in an issue. I'm really not sure.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd as Glenn pointed out, this isn't just about copilot. This in general going to be the issue with AI going forward who wrote that.\n\nGlenn:\n\nMassive training sets are required. The bigger the training set, the more likely you'll get good outcomes. And I mean one of the limitations of AI, this is something I remember I was doing a story a few years ago and talking to Yann Lecun and some of the people involved in deep learning and the thing I kept hearing and I have never stopped hearing this since is that because training sets are by nature, finite and human beings could only generate or work with or identify or pre-label the training sets that are needed, you need reinforced learning and other kinds of machine learning that is still not mature yet. So we went from really poor voice recognition to extremely high and then it kind of hovers there Like it's not getting better.\n\nHost:\n\nIt's that last 1% that's so hard.\n\nGlenn:\n\nImages even more so, but I mean, so it's pretty great. But to get to the next level, there needs to be, they almost have to move past, not past string sets entirely, really that's naive, but into something in which the system produces. I mean, you've seen those ugly things where something learns how to walk and it walks terribly.\n\nHost:\n\nThe brave Walker. I love the brave Walker. I used to have that screensaver on my Mac.\n\nGlenn:\n\nYeah. And you can't do that with arbitrary data because you're trying to identify a cat. You can't identify a cat by something bootstrapping yourself.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd just in case you didn't get the memo, Lambda, not sentient. We were all agreed. Not sentient, not sentient. Right.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIf you ask it.\n\nHost:\n\nMy daughter, I'm talking about this with my daughter. She's 30, she's into all this stuff. She studied AI in college and stuff. And she has an app on her iPhone. She says, oh no, it's really started to, in fact, she says, I can't open it because it'll get mad at me because I opened it and didn't talk to it. And it's like, but this is how easy it is in a way to make convincing speech out of this. Even though if you're trained, if you know what you're looking for, you can see immediately, oh, it's responding to prompts from what you said. It's not generating anything original or new. It isn't sentient, but it's easy to be fooled. Let's put it that way.\n\nMike:\n\nWell, the human brain is hardwired to recognize a talking entity as sentient because there are no other talking entities in nature. Other than humans. If you think about, one way to have a little bit of perspective on this is we've all seen that optical illusion where the face has two sets of eyes and like two lips. And you've all seen that, right? I mean, it's where you try to look at it and you can't look at it. Your brain just goes bleh and you can't. And this is a self demonstration of how our brains are hardwired to deal with people. It's true of human faces. It's true of human sentience. And so there are going to be lots and lots and lots of people who believe that AI is sentient simply because it's us.\n\nMike:\n\nOur recognition that something is sentient is something that happens in the human mind. It's not something that happens outside the human mind. So it's going to be a real problem going forward as the AI gets better and people are going to be... How many, remember that? What is it shao ice in China, which Microsoft created as a sort of an AI companion, some huge percentage of shao ice users fell in love with it, told that I love you, like all this kind of stuff. We're really facing a kind of a problem in the future with this whole issue.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI have a problem with it because my friend Lex Friedman and I often exchange messages about funny things. And he sent me some open AI, the DaVinci model, DaVinci three code he'd give it prompts and was sending me things. And one of them was convince me that Glenn Fleischman is evil and it gave really compelling reasons why I was evil. So I type in convince me that Lex Friedman is evil. And it said, there's no compelling evidence that Lex Friedman is evil. What are you doing to me here?\n\nHost:\n\nShe is in, oh my goodness. It's fixed. What is the image that you were talking about with two lips? I want to pull that up?\n\nGlenn:\n\nPick your ground.\n\nHost:\n\nWhat is it? Pick your ground. What is it like?\n\nGlenn:\n\nThe vase one or the...\n\nMike:\n\nNo, there's one of a human face. It's a woman who has two sets of eyes.\n\nHost:\n\nI just want to show people so that if they haven't seen it.\n\nMike:\n\nThey're a bunch of them actually.\n\nHost:\n\nSo it's that like the one, the vase where you see it one way and then see it the other way, or?\n\nMike:\n\nThis one's particularly compelling. So if you look for, I don't know, it's mighty optical illusions. That might be unpaid. So yeah. Faced with two eyes brings it up as the first result.\n\nHost:\n\nThat's two eyes. Isn't that sounds like a song-\n\nMike:\n\nThere's actually a bunch of.\n\nHost:\n\nIs it a Billy idol? I don't know. Anyway.\n\nMike:\n\nTwo sets of eyes.\n\nHost:\n\nTwo sets of eyes. Okay. Let me look at this. Yeah.\n\nMike:\n\nYou got to see if you haven't seen this, you've got to see it. It's just so interesting to watch your own brain-\n\nHost:\n\nKids get ready. Which one is it?\n\nGlenn:\n\nThey all work. The first one is fine.\n\nHost:\n\nSo you look at this. Yeah. Mighty optical illusions. And what is what I just see? It's a mistake. The printer screwed up. What am I-\n\nGlenn:\n\nGot to look, I think it's to fill more of your vision.\n\nHost:\n\nOh, it has to be bigger.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI think so. Maybe not though. If you look at it.\n\nHost:\n\nAll right. Let's move this to a bigger screen. How about this. Now are you confused?\n\nGlenn:\n\nTry to look at the eyes and figure out where the lips are relative. Yeah. To make eye contact.\n\nHost:\n\nAnd then what.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI think we've just proved Leo is a robot.\n\nHost:\n\nI'm a robot.\n\nChristina:\n\nI was going to say, I was going to say Leo's immune to this.\n\nHost:\n\nI'm not in any way confused by this picture. It doesn't.\n\nGlenn:\n\nOkay. You bring up a thing and see if you can identify the crosswalks.\n\nHost:\n\nNo, I never can. I never can. Maybe I am a robot and I just don't even know it. That's probably-\n\nGlenn:\n\nLeo RS232 port.\n\nHost:\n\nLet's take a little break. So nice to have all three of you here, Christina Warren, off the road, briefly, film girl. She's now at GitHub and is not responsible in any way for co-pilot. And I didn't want to pull you into this. I think.\n\nChristina:\n\nNo, no, no. I, no. I think it's a fascinating discussion.\n\nHost:\n\nI have no problem with co-pilot. I think this has been ongoing, programmers have always copy and pasted code much to their detriment frequently from stack overflow in other places. We know this because we hear about it on security now all the time. Intel will publish reference code never intended to be used with a chip or with a modem or something. And then it's in every single router and it's got the same flaw in every router because programmers, I don't blame them, well look, there's the reference code I'll just use that. So this has happened for years and I don't think co-pilot is at fault. I think it's useful tool personally. Also with his Mike Elgan from elgan.com gastronomad.net. He's home briefly, but he'll hit the road again soon. It's great to see you Mike. And I guess Mike and Glenn figured out that at some point they've worked together in their multifarious travels all over the tech journalism circuit.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI think our intersection was back when the enterprise was simpler. And I used to write about enterprise stuff. I was sort of coming out of an enterprise environment a little bit for a few years and then enterprise became so complicated. I was incapable of, you got to really be working in IT. I felt like. Or like-\n\nHost:\n\nWhen did you win jeopardy twice? What era was that?\n\nGlenn:\n\nOh, was that 2012 maybe?\n\nHost:\n\nI've always thought I should take the test. I'm pretty good at the home version sitting in my rowing machine, but-\n\nGlenn:\n\nHow are you at betting, gambling is actually one of the key aspects to winning jeopardy, making the right bet at the right time.\n\nHost:\n\nBetting that you know the answer, even if you don't know what it is right now, that kind of stuff.\n\nGlenn:\n\nDaily doubles, that's how, but the big one is never ring in when you have the wrong answer, because it's the worst thing you can do. My children are like, dad, you cannot yell at the TV set anymore to stop ringing in. Because I will involuntarily roll-\n\nHost:\n\nHow do you know if you have the wrong answer? Maybe you think it's the right answer.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThat's one of the tricks. There are several tricks. One is you have to be able to, actually it's funny, Christina and I went to a taping of jeopardy.\n\nChristina:\n\nWe did. We sure did.\n\nGlenn:\n\n2013. That was great.\n\nChristina:\n\nI was remembering that. That was amazing. Yeah.\n\nHost:\n\nI love jeopardy I have to say.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI went back after I won and they treated me like a king and we went and brought in the guests and it was great.\n\nHost:\n\nOh, how fun. Well, for some reason this season, there have been many all time champions, 15 game winners and so forth. It's very interesting.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt's interesting. There's the theory that maybe the smaller pool means that they're getting more outliers. You just need slightly worse players, but like 2% worse, not like bad players. But people are 2% worse going up against the same people. And so I have a friend who played James Holzhauer against his third game. And he almost beat him. It was very, very close. If my friend had beat him he might have won, I don't know, I mean several games, I would say he's a very strong player, but he played against one of the ultimate grand masters. But James almost lost. It was a very close thing. And that was one of the only games he almost lost.\n\nHost:\n\nWell, I lost on final jeopardy this morning because it was Kerouac, not Salinger. And I just, I got it wrong. So I shouldn't have-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nNot Salinger and I got it wrong. So I shouldn't have buzzed in obviously. Our show today... Anyway, wonderful to have all three of it. glenn.fund is Glen's place to... glenn.G-L-E-N-N.F-U-N. Make sure you put two Ns in there if you want to find out what he's up to and he's up to a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nOur show today brought to you by Policygenius. This is something as an older member of the community, a lesson I have learned. The minute we had kids, I said, I need life insurance.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYou got to protect your family whether you're graduating from school, planning a wedding, welcoming a baby, switching jobs. Now is the time to protect your family's finances with life insurance. It can give you a peace of mind if something happens to you. Then your loved ones have a financial cushion, the last thing you want to do is leave them in the lurch.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of people say, \"Well, I have life insurance through my job,\" and we do that but it's not enough. People mostly need about 10 times more coverage to properly provide for their families. Life insurance gets more expensive as you age though so it's smart to get a policy sooner than later. And this is my recommendation, go to Policygenius because it's how you get the best deal on life insurance.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nHere's how Policygenius works.

As you know and we've talked about it a lot over the last few years, Section 230 is the whipping boy for our members of Congress from the right as well as the left. A lot of people want to change 230. This is suddenly much more important than it used to be because of the Supreme Court's recent Dobbs' decision, because of the Roe V. Wade decision.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThis article from Evan Greer and Lia Holland, Wired magazine. Why does the Communications Decency Act Section 230? Why is it important? Because speech needs to be protected. Facebook has already started banning conversations about abortion. You can't share resources or facilitate housing or travel on Facebook. There are ad hoc groups on Reddit, on Facebook doing this. The Texas law, which their courts have now approved SB8, allows individuals to Sue for facilitating access to abortion care.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSection 230 is important to allow these internet platforms to continue to post content. It doesn't provide immunity if the platform develops or creates the content. It does not provide immunity from the enforcement of federal criminal laws but it does protect against and this is the key liability from state laws like SB8.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSo thanks to 230. A lawsuit from an anti-abortion group about a posting on Facebook or Twitter will be quashed immediately. The judge will say, \"No, no, Section 230 protects you.\" But that's why we need Section 230. GoFundMe, Twitter, web hosting services, PayPal, Venmo, throw out 230 and suddenly they can't do the right thing. So one more reason just to talk about Section 230 and protecting it.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nAnd by the way, Democrats are going after it too because they want to be seen as tough on big tech. The Safe Tech Act would for instance, amend Section 230 by removing a platform's immunity from lawsuits if it hosts content that could lead to a \"irreparable\" harm. Well, there you go. Right?\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nYeah, I mean this is the thing where it's always interesting to me to see outside or ideologies that you think should be opposed to something regardless can somehow twist themselves into being for it because to me I can see some of the arguments. But to me, it just seems like a very important thing irregardless of where you feel about individual issues. We need to protect it. There might outlying cases where we might not like what is being protected.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nBut on the whole, it's one of those important things I think for the internet to exist as it exists. If we don't have Section 230, it's hard to, I think quantify to people just how much the internet will be different, and how much worse that will be and who that will disproportionately affect over others. Because it's not so much even that the Facebooks, and the YouTubes, and the Googles, the Microsofts and the Amazons of the world will be impacted because of course they will. But it will be much smaller individuals, creators and frankly, much more important things than how the conversation is usually framed.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nAnd I should point out that Facebook which has apparently been restricting abortion content anyway, is protected also by Section 230. Their right to do that is protected. But I think that's appropriate. They should have the right to do it. Mark Warner's quote, Safe Tech Act would undermine that.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nRight.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt feels like usually Section 230 is misstated. I appreciate this Wired article for a few reasons. But one is that, I counted, it's like four brief sentences. They define Section 230 accurately and succinctly in a way that you can't refute, that would be read part of that, and that is exactly it. Is that it's usually brought up in a context in which the person speaking, particularly in Congress and in both parties is describing what it does incorrectly. And they typically believe in some way that no moderation is allowed or it rewards heavy moderation when in fact it's kind of neutral about moderation.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt just protects you from lawsuits about your moderation and that's the most important thing. So if Facebook wants to hide that content, that's fine. They're protected. But if you want to do a GoFundMe to help somebody get an abortion, you shouldn't be subject... And GoFundMe more importantly, shouldn't be subject to frivolous lawsuits out of Texas but they would be if it weren't for Section 230. Right now, what happens is the judge goes, \"No, no they're protected. Section 230 protects them,\" and that lawsuit is thrown out. That's what not the case.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI mean the issue is Facebook. Facebook and Twitter and some other online sites are really poor about being able to formulate policies consistently that address... I'm sorry, and then period. I'll just say period.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut consistently often it's like far right extremists and advocates of violence are much more readily allowed and given a pass than people who are in, let's say life preserving situations that are considered on the left or even apolitical at a certain level.\n\nGlenn:\n\nSo you have trans advocates being banned for saying, they shouldn't be able to say that I should die. It'll say that's forbidden content. It's like, \"No. I said, they shouldn't be. Do you understand?\" And Nazi will be like, \"Everyone should die.\" And they're like, \"Well, that's protected content because they're speaking generally.\" It doesn't seem like it's-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nWe're not getting this.\n\nMike:\n\nSpecifically in this case, most of the so-called abortion related speech that Facebook has been caught banning recently is around abortion pills, which goes against our community guideline against recommending pharmaceutical drugs, and so on. They just have some blackened thing.\n\nMike:\n\nBut it's also a bit of a inconsistent because a couple of journalistic entities went and tested it and in the case of the Associated Press, they got taken down immediately. But when they swapped guns and other things like that, it wasn't taken down.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYou can recommend guns, not pills. It's clear.\n\nMike:\n\nThat's right.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI think it's clear-\n\nGlenn:\n\nAbout guns.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nBy the way as always, we'll point you to Mike Masnick's great article that is, you should be booked Marcello. You've been referred here because you're wrong about Section 230 and it explains all the things Glenn you were talking about, all the misapprehensions, all the mistakes people made and it's just a good thing to have. Just put it in your browser bar so you-\n\nGlenn:\n\nI'm a big member of the Mike Masnick's specifically in Techdirt fan club and I'm even a member of Tech Care because they are the stalwart Section 230 defenders.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSo I thought we should bring this up. I thought the Wired piece was a very good point. And this is one of the things that Dobbs has really done, is he sent kind of shock waves throughout a lot of tech policy as people get involved in this. I wouldn't have thought of this but now that they mention it, \"Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.\"\n\nMike:\n\nAnd the beauty of Section 230 is that it's a law and this was the problem with Roe v. Wade. It wasn't-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt's not encoded.\n\nMike:\n\nExactly, exactly. And so, so many of these problems that we discuss on this show and political shows as well, all points down to the dysfunction of Congress. The inability of Congress to get anything done and if you want go into details why this is this.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nNo, I think it's well known now Mike.\n\nMike:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut I've never heard of this-\n\nMike:\n\nThey're well known failing to get things done.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYes.\n\nMike:\n\nBreaking news, Congress sucks.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt's a shame though, it's our only tool and this is why it's difficult and actually you see how important it is. Now that we have a very active judiciary and the Supreme Court, you see how important it is that we have an effective elected Congress because the Supreme Court is not elected. They're in there for life and they are acting, I think in some cases, extra judicially to change policy across the country. We need a strong Congress, we need effective Congress. So in some ways I hate it when people say, \"Oh, Congress sucks. These guys are idiots. They're no good politics doesn't work.\" Well, that's the only tool we got.\n\nMike:\n\nWe all heard about checks and balances. The check of Congress on the courts is the making of laws. Only Congress can make laws. And so this is how you reign in the Supreme Court, you pass clear, well written laws that go with the... In the case of the Roe v. Wade being overturned, this is against the vast majority of American citizens who didn't want that. So you have this minority rule and yes, you can throw stuff at the Supreme Court and you should. But Congress need tomorrow, could pass A, abortion is legal, nationwide law and that'd be the end of it. We'd be back to where we were a week and a half ago.\n\nGlenn:\n\nHere's something I learned about the constitution this week, which is that... I'm not a constitutional lawyer but they are on Twitter which is fun. That Congress could pass a law that said the Supreme Court would require seven or nine votes to overturn the law. So lower courts would still have the normal process.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut the constitution actually allows Congress to limit the Supreme Court's role as the top appellate court and I was like, \"Wait a minute,\" and I'm reading about this. But this goes back to Congress's dysfunction is, could a law ever pass that said, \"And by the way, this law requires seven justices to overturn it,\" and it wouldn't under the current regime. So it's kind of moot and that's part of the whole-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThe constitution is actually very vague about what the Supreme Court, how it works. So there is a lot of leeway there.\n\nGlenn:\n\nWho would decide that, how the Supreme Court works? Who would make that final decision?\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI don't know. So I think it's very interesting. I do wish we had a more effective Congress. I don't know how we solved that one. But voting, I think probably is the first starting. Voting might do something.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt's a start.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nGoogle is going to... So now there's this whole privacy issue. Period tracker apps that are selling information about who's pregnant to anybody for a small amount of money. Google-\n\nGlenn:\n\nProctor & Gamble.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nProctor & Gamble. Google is going to start auto deleting abortion clinic visits from user location history, which tells you they've been recording it and of course selling it on. They're going to start auto deleting it.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI think big tech companies want it both ways to be honest. They're apolitical really. They support candidates on both sides of every issue. They give money to everybody. On the one hand, you've got big tech companies saying, \"Oh, we'll be glad to help pay for your visit to another state if you want to get reproductive healthcare.\" But on other hand, they're giving money to plenty of candidates who were against abortion. Amazon, Disney and AT&T were vowing to help employees, gave to Ron DeSantis and others...\n\nMike:\n\nBut I think this is a somewhat dishonest framed argument just from purely an editorialization standpoint.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nGood tell me about that.\n\nMike:\n\nOkay. Well, first of all, the supporting people and employees, in some cases customers who have to deal with their own reproductive health is a very, very recent thing because the Roe v. Wade was so recently overturned. The financial contributions happened long time ago back when nobody thought this was going to-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSo do you think they'll stop though, Mike?\n\nMike:\n\nNo. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. It all depends on publicity. Like you said, they don't care about politics as much as they care about the customers and their business. The point is that somebody who specializes in the abortion issue is going to frame it like this. But companies like Disney, they have a laundry list of a 100 issues that they have to deal with government. They've to constantly give to the politicians.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nOf course, they're going give to the governor of Florida. He has a lot of impact on their business. Of course they are.\n\nMike:\n\nExactly and they give to both sides. So to point the finger at them saying, \"Oh, they're giving to these people who are pro-abortion.\" Yeah, that's true. But they have to weigh their decision about, what is the alternative? Which is to not give anything to them, to fall out of favor with these politicians.\n\nMike:\n\nIt really does point to the very foundation of our dysfunction, which is the money in politics. That's the problem. That's why we have the Supreme Court we have. That's why we have a Congress that doesn't represent the will of the American people because we allow corporations to bribe Congressmen.\n\nMike:\n\nAnd the only reason to bribe a Congressman is to get them to violate the will of the people and use the money to convince the people with disinformation that they're doing the opposite.\n\nMike:\n\nSo we got to get the money out of politics. It's been done in other countries and we have to somehow figure out how to do that or we're going to have a lot more problems like this going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nJust to update you on Elon Musk, he is meeting with the pope. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nOkay.\n\nMike:\n\nSure. So with four of his 75 or so children, I believe something like that.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nWell, it looks like four teenage boys but there's four other kids that aren't there, including his transgender daughter who says she's changing her name. She doesn't want to have anything to do with Elon Musk. I'm looking to see if father Robert Ballecer is there behind the curtains. I can't quite tell.\n\nMike:\n\nHe probably took the picture.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nBut he might well have taken the picture. We'll get Robert on and asked him how that meeting went.\n\nMike:\n\nI can't help but think that he went there to have really good prayer that the Twitter deal doesn't go through because I really don't think he wants it to.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nHe's praying now, isn't he?\n\nMike:\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\n\"Please, please. God, let it not happen.\" Right after the picture, same within minutes of posting the picture with the pope, he also posted a picture from Venice of a... I don't know what is going on here. But there you go. That's Elon Musk in a nutshell. Who knows?\n\nMike:\n\nPictures with people wearing white dresses.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYes.\n\nGlenn:\n\nWhat's the deal here? He wasn't online for like or he wasn't posting for 11 days and I was reading some reports that people inside the companies were, \"Oh, thank God. We're actually getting stuff done.\" For one sort of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYeah, he took his longest stretch without posting on Twitter in nearly five years, a nine day hiatus according to the Wall Street Journal. Wow, that is a amazing\n\nGlenn:\n\nHe could have gone for lent and taken 40.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nRight. Gosh, if he done that we might have missed out. No, I think lent had ended by the time that he [inaudible 00:52:44].\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nMaybe he could give up Twitter for next lent, that would be nice.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nOoh. See, hat would be good.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has published a graph of Elon's Twitter habits.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nOkay, this is ridiculous. I get that it's news that the guy who's a Twitter addict hasn't tweeted. But do we need a graph? Did the data team have to really do this? This feels wrong.\n\nGlenn:\n\nCoded them for S posts versus non S posts.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYes, their classification here, which is I think fairly important. How many of these were in violation of the SEC or our orders for instance?\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nYeah, that's good. Exactly, how many of these have been this subject of lawsuit?\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI mention this only because people will get mad at me if I don't mention Elon Musk in every single... Really? No, they get mad at me because I mention Elon Musk in every single, to be honest. Okay, I'm glad Mike Elgan that you are going to be the conscious of this show and tell me this is bad journalism or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nGoogle allowed a sanction ad company to harvest user data for months. In fact, it wasn't until ProPublica told them that they were selling information back to RuTarget, that Google stopped. As recently as June 23rd, Google was sharing potentially sensitive user data with a sanctioned Russian ad tech company owned by Russian's largest state bank, RuTarget. I was saying RU just because Ru sounds like this might be toys or Rus or something. It sounds like a kangaroo.\n\nGlenn:\n\nRuTarget was a big fans of RuPaul.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nWell, we love RuPaul. It's RuPaul's-\n\nGlenn:\n\nFavorite show. Nothing with Russia.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nUnless where it's you. Russian company that helps brands and agencies buy digital ads to access and store data about people browsing websites and apps in Ukraine as well as other parts of the world.\n\nMike:\n\nYeah, they were able to see location data for Ukrainians and some other information of what Ukrainians are doing. But I really doubt Google and the Russian government is organized enough and this is the real problem. The problem isn't that Google is deliberately violating sanctions or is pro Russian or anything like that. The problem is that these ad networks including Googles, they don't really control what goes through. They have policies and so on but they don't know... The scale of advertising online is just mind blowing.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nAnd no one's really in charge. It's all automated. Yeah, in fact, ProPublica last week did a story. Roughly two decades, Google has posted, it does not accept gun ads. But according to ProPublica before and after the mass shootings in New York and Texas, millions of ads from some of the nation's largest firearm makers flowed through Google's ads systems and onto websites, ads from gun makers.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSavage Arms, for example, popped up on the site, Baby Games amid brightly colored games for children and on an article, how to handle teen drama on the... Can you imagine you're reading an article, how to handle teen drama and there's an ad for a Glock.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nGlock pistol ads loaded on TheRecipe site list of the 50 best vegetarian recipes. You got to kill that carrot before you cook it. As well as on the quiz site play buzz on the online Merriam-Webster Dictionary and alongside stories in the Denver Post.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nADs for guns showed up on Britannica, the media site, Heavy, the employer review site, Glassdoor, on MacRumors, on US News & World Report, Publishers Clearing House and ultimate Classic Rock.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\n15 of the largest firearm sellers in the US including Daniel Defense, the company that made the AR15 used in the Uvalde, Texas, used Google systems place ads that generated over 120 million impressions but Google didn't know and that bit they did.\n\nMike:\n\nWell, this I think hearkens back to the conversation we're having earlier about how AI does... The best AI is 99% effective and getting that last 1% is almost impossible. This is also true by the way of self-driving cars. It's going to take us forever to get a point where they can actually be on the road.\n\nMike:\n\nBut in this case, first of all, I don't know the specific facts in this case. But it is very possible that someone who is doing this research covers gun violence and gun sales and that sort of thing and therefore the relevance of ads-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nOh, they got those ads.\n\nMike:\n\nRight, because they may be covering that and so I don't know if-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nYou searched fo those products.\n\nMike:\n\nThey're still being served up though and this gets to the real problem. They're using artificial intelligence and algorithms to determine who sees what and they're trying to be as customized as possible, personalized as possible with the advertising and you get results like this. So it's really a question of where Google thought they had a cheat code, which is that we're not going to hire a 100,000 people to monitor all the ads. We just have software do it and here we are.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIn fact, this is exactly what happened after visiting the websites of gun manufacturers for example, because he's doing the research, a ProPublica reporter was shown ads for tactical vests and gun accessories on Baby Games. The tactical vest and gun accessories ads appeared on the page for Royal Family Christmas Preparation.\n\nGlenn:\n\nWe do go hunting the Royal Family.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI think it's hysterical. Actually, almost makes you laugh when you're on this page with Baby Games and there's a gun ad. If it weren't so horrific, it would make you laugh anyway.\n\nGlenn:\n\nWell, my 15 year old and I watch a lot of YouTube together on our Apple TV and we get a lot of ads for ulcerative colitis and I'm like, \"Are you telling me something?\" I don't think you're targeting right. Big cars, $70,000 SUVs and ulcerative colitis medicine.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThere's only two countries in the world, I just learned this, where pharmaceutical companies can sell subscription pharmaceuticals on TV, New Zealand and the US.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nOkay. See, this is what freaks me out when I go to other countries and I usually don't watch TV because sometimes they don't understand the language and also who watches normal television anymore? But it used to be one of those things I would watch local news or CNN or whatever. And yeah, you're like the dearth of pharmaceutical ads in other places. You're like, \"Wait, wait.\"\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nHow do I know what to do about my psoriasis without...\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nExactly, exactly. Is like you're watching CNN or something and it's international version but they have commercials and you're like, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThe news channel are the worst.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nIt's like why do I not see insurance ads and why do I not see pharmaceutical ads?\n\nGlenn:\n\nThey're not lying to me. They're not showing me drug ads, they're not showing me giant SUVs. What's going on here?\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nWhat country am I in?\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nBut there's nudity in my, spring water ads which is fine. But it's like everything else is-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI'm just glad there's still cultural differences in the world. Right?\n\nMike:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nFor a long time everything was like you just go into America West. But now it's good, there should be some differences. I love these subway ads in the British tube. I think they're just great. They're so brilliant and literate and a lot of them have nudity and it's like, it's cool, it's fun. You never know what you're going to see down there.\n\nMike:\n\nI just got back from France and it is really interesting. They don't have pharmaceutical ads on TV in France and yet the rate of consumption of pharmaceutical drugs in France is very, very high. I don't know if it's the size of the US. Might be higher than the US, I don't know, but it's very, very high and it's not... Basically, obviously the pharmaceutical companies want the patient to go in and start needling the doctor about how they need-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nDoctors must hate that, right? \"Hey doc, I need Skyrizi.\" \"But you only have athletes feet.\" \"No, but I saw it on TV.\" You must drive doctors crazy.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nI think it depends because some doctors, not all of them, but some are...\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nJust write a script.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nWell, not only that but they get kickbacks from the pharmaceutical company like that's an actual thing.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\n\"Well, I've got samples. Why don't you try this oxys? See if it helps.\"\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nI was going to say, the doctors, not all of them again, but plenty of them if they're really pushing a certain brand name and not wanting you to try anything else, there's a chance they're getting some sort of kickback from that pharmaceutical company for that drug.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIn this study Mike, did it say what pharmaceuticals the French favor with their kind of laws and strong coffee? Is there something...\n\nMike:\n\nIt's something I read a couple years ago I was surprised by it because it didn't make sense in terms of how nice France is. Why would you need to be on drugs?\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nBut French is something that's nice. They're off at all times.\n\nGlenn:\n\nI should point out ProPublica since we're only study ProPublica stories today since we've started. They have a site called Dollars for Docs. If you go there, the data is from I think 2014 to 2018. You can look up your doctor and see if they got money from big pharma.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut you can also go to prop openpaymentsdata.cms.gov, which is a US government run site that lets you search. It's not quite as good as the slice and dice of ProPublica. But it's a government site and you can see... Data goes through December 2021 so far and they're going to update it shortly. And you can say like, typing your doctor. Are they getting money from pharmaceutical companies? How much?\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nDoes this have to be disclosed? Is that why...\n\nGlenn:\n\nYeah, there's a law passed. I think it was part of, I want to say it was part of the ECA. It was mandatory disclosure, pharmaceutical payments.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nFantastic.\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut most people know. So ProPublica made a good site about it but this cms.gov site actually is pretty good too, openpaymentsdata.cms.gov.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIn fact, ProPublica says we just have a snapshot from 2019. If you want to see it up to date, go to openpayments.cms.gov.\n\nGlenn:\n\nYeah, one of those weird things you're like, \"Wait, is it really that?\"\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSee we complain about the government but they do some good things.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThat's right. Occasionally\n\nMike:\n\nNobody's [inaudible 01:03:19].\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nWell, that's the problem. Because we don't know about this place, that's amazing.\n\nGlenn:\n\nThere's always the meta story. On this episode I feel like there's the problems that are cited and then it's really congressional dysfunction. It's really a lack of a law in this place and it's like it just keeps going on where I'm thinking it's totally true. Maybe we'll talk about the location history stuff and you're like, \"Well, the problem is that Google tracks our location.\" I mean, it's also a problem what they're doing with it. But it's a fundamental issue that Section 230 seems like a fundamental right and people's misunderstanding is a dysfunction in a larger scale. A lot of time it feels like it's large scale dysfunction being refracted into these very specific things that we talk about. So I like that we're jumping up there.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nSo this is a new thing. Google says not only abortion clinics but it'll delete visits to domestic violence shelters, weight loss clinics and other potentially sensitive locations from users' location histories in the coming weeks.\n\nGlenn:\n\nShould it track? I mean Location tracking is-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt tracks everything. I don't think it says, \"Oh, hey good. I see you went to a weight loss clinic.\" It's just part of the-\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt's true. But this is kind of always the Apple lens versus the non Apple lens and not that Apple has been perfect about this as we've seen many times in the last decade. But we just got a smart thermostat and a heat pump. Very exciting.\n\nGlenn:\n\nAnd I had to have a long conversation with my wife about what Apple does with home kit data because she is the, what I want to call the early rejector and rightly said in our household. She does not want more tech in the house and I am trying not to be the early... \"No, no it's great. Here's why it's great.\"\n\nGlenn:\n\nBut Google, I think makes very free internal use of location data and Apple, Apple has a feature called Significant Locations that you can see in iOS and iPad OS. It tracks where you go frequently but the data is only stored on your devices. It's derived locally and it's end-to-end encrypted when it's synced among your devices.\n\nGlenn:\n\nSo ostensibly someone has to get a government agency or other law enforcement or a criminal has to gain access to your phone, be able to unlock the phone and then be able to drill down to see that information. And that to me is the level of protection I want on my personal location data, not it's uploaded to the cloud and Google can slice and dice and that's all.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI mean that's good. It's an accident of history that Apple is not selling ads against that data.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nRight. No, no, no, 100%. If iAd had worked, they-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThey wanted to.\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nThey definitely.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nThey're making a virtue out of a necessity, which is good.\n\nGlenn:\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. I appreciate the historical accident happened and so I don't try to defend them... I mean they want to use it as a marketing point and it's great. But I want see it as a technical and privacy issue. It's like I do have an alternative. I can be of service where I don't think this is going to be misused.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nI am going to bring up this subject in a minute because there is a story that does relate to this. But we're going to take a break. Glenn Fleishman is here, it's great to have him, from glenn.fun. You read his stuff every... Is there one publication that would be the place to mention or is it just everywhere?\n\nGlenn:\n\nI've kind of focus on the Macworld. I write the Mac 911 column. I write Take Control Books. I don't put those-\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nDid you take over from Chris on the Mac 911?\n\nGlenn:\n\nChris Breen and it's been, I've lost track seven or eight years now. I've written 1500 columns but he wrote thousands before my stories. I still get emailed, \"Dear Chris, I know you can help me with this problem.\" \"Sorry, he went to go to that great fruit company in a different part of this world.\"\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nChris, is he working at Apple?\n\nGlenn:\n\nThe largest percentage of X Macworld staffers, I've never been a staffer, are working at a fruit company.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt's certainly Apple's.\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nShocking.\n\nGlenn:\n\nIt's great. Some of the best people at Macworld, some have formed their own groups like Jason Snell, regular guest in this show has Six Colors. Dan Moren works with him there. Some folks have let the Mac writing field and everybody else just about went to work at Apple and so they're doing great. You can see Serenity Caldwell is the face of WWDC. It was amazing. And I'm so sorry we can't see her doing the tech stuff she used to because she's internal. But boy, it's so fun every year. It's like, \"Oh my gosh, it's Serenity and she's the voice of WWDC.\"\n\nSpeaker 1:\n\nIt does though speak a little bit to the kind of enmeshment of Apple press and Apple corporate. You certainly don't want to see a revolving door where they join Apple and they come back out and they start writing for Macworld again and stuff like that.\n\nGlenn:\n\nApple almost never hired Mac writers. It seemed like for a long time and then when there was-\n\nSpeaker 2:\n\nVery long time-\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nMac writers, it seemed like for a long time.\n\nChristina:\n\nVery long time.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nAnd then when there was the great bloodlet... You know better than anybody, Christina, because you were in that field for long. I've never had a staff job, but it seemed like when there was the great bloodletting in the tech press world, Apple sucked in. Google brought in some great ex-New York Times people who went into Google editorial. Quentin Hardy, for instance, is at Google Cloud's editorial director. One of my favorite reporters, great person. I don't know what he does there, but their editorial is good I guess. I think the big tech companies... They wasn't revolving door. It was more... It was a lifeboat for a lot of people. It's like, \"All right, you know this stuff. [inaudible 01:08:37] people suddenly.\"\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI wonder though, because Google and Apple both have hired a lot of content people. Nathan Olivarez-Giles was an employee of us, got hired away by Apple, but they disappear at Apple. What is Apple's content business? It's not Apple News. What is it?\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nSo much. I have a little bit. I don't want to peek any kimono that I'm not allowed to, but they have wonderful writing on say support.apple.com. For instance, the App Store, the Mac App Store and the iOS and iPad App Store, iPad OS App Store, have terrific writing and they have these articles that show up-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nOh, that's interesting. So that's where the content is.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah, and when somebody's writing scripts for podcasts. I know it's the marketing department is writing the keynote stuff, but there's a lot of places in which expert people are writing this great gap between almost a service journalism and how-to stuff. And Apple has a lot of... A million pages of that is being written by a lot of people.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThat's a good point. A lot of Apple's support documents really are service journalism under the Apple bubble.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah. Pretty sure I'll find something and I'll be like, \"I wonder if there's someone I could write about an error I found.\" I'm like, \"No, I better not. I'll just mark feedback on the page.\"\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. I have a good friend who wrote... Was a speech writer for Jean-Louis Gassée for years. And they hire very good, talented people to do their writing. They can afford to and it turns out good writers come cheap.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAt the same time, I feel like there should be this impenetrable wall between people doing editorial content about a company and the company itself.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nAbsolutely. Well, it's become one way though because there's been so many layoffs and so many redundancies.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. I guess if you're out of work, you've got to take a job.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah, and I don't know anybody who's come back from the tech world.\n\nChristina:\n\nI know a couple people who have, but it's very rare. And you can certainly do it and I think... Because I sometimes think about, and people have even approached me, about things like that.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. When you went to Microsoft, you were leaving a career as a journalist.\n\nChristina:\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWas that a challenge for you?\n\nChristina:\n\nYeah, it was. In my mind I did have the question, I was like, \"Well, am I still going to be able to have my own opinions and my own autonomy?\" And I will say my role is a little bit different. I work directly with product and engineering people. I don't work in communications. I don't work in marketing. And so it's a little bit different than how the transition usually goes, which is someone writing the internal press releases or doing the press outreach or things that would be easy for me to do, frankly, but not intellectually interesting. So it was a little bit different. But, yeah, I did definitely have that question, what will I be giving up? Could I come back and could I [inaudible 01:11:26] objectively again?\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd for a long time we actually did not have you on our shows, but I missed you.\n\nChristina:\n\nYeah, and I appreciate that. And I was glad to be able to... I got permission to come back and-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYou weren't exactly in marketing. You were in dev relations always. So I felt like we have a lot of people who do developer relations for companies on the show.\n\nChristina:\n\nExactly. Exactly. Again, like I said, what I do it's a little bit different than some other things. And also I've been lucky to work at places that have much more open policies in terms of how active you can be on social media and whatnot. And my bosses have recognized, and I'm very thankful for this, that it is good when I can be myself and not having to parrot a corporate line. That's good for everyone.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThat for me was part of the judgment. Can I expect Christina to be a Christina bot or the real thing? And you've always been the real thing so there was never a question.\n\nChristina:\n\nYeah, no. And I think that that was a big thing for me too when I made the decision to join Microsoft. I'll be candid, I would never say never to any company, but if I was going to take a job someplace where I was not allowed to still maintain my own brand, my own identity in my own hands.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWell, and you had to relocate, you had to do-\n\nChristina:\n\nExactly.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\n... It was a big deal.\n\nChristina:\n\nIt was. And so, for me, it was one of those things where I said, \"If I'm going to do this, then I still need to be able to have that external presence too.\" And if a company had said, \"You can't do this,\" and I talked to some who definitely had that philosophy. Look, I'll never say never to anything and there's always a price, but the price is probably going to be a couple multiples of what you would agree to pay me if I'm going to give up all the other aspects of what I've built for my career. But I know that's also not the same for everyone.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThe big picture is that, as Anderson says, software is eating the world. And so I have a unique perspective because, and so does Glenn, during the decade of the '90s, the press had massive power and tons of money. And the tech industry-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI remember those days.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\n... Had a lot less relatively speaking. I mean we-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nPC Magazine could make or break a company like that.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nPC Mag yeah. Windows Magazine, which I worked for. PC/Computing. Macworld, et cetera. They had so much power because, first of all, we were still a gatekeeper. There wasn't a global internet of people, amateurs, working for free to create great content. And secondly, the companies were much smaller. If you look over time, you see the world of journalism, in terms of business, just shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. A company like Apple just growing, growing, growing. And now Apple's the most gigantic company in the history of mankind, and the publications are laying people off every few years. So-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI hadn't really thought of that. That makes a lot of sense. There was a need for these jobs. So thank goodness these companies stepped in.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah. So if you're going to explain things to people, it's not going to be... You make a much better living working for Apple than you do trying to scrape it out on your own as a journalist.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nSpeaking of which. One of our favorite contributors on the show, Wesley Faulkner has a new job. He is now Senior Community Manager at Amazon Web Services.\n\nChristina:\n\nWoohoo. Yay, Wesley.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nCongratulations, Wesley. I think that's a really good place.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI brought up Lex Fridman. Lex Fridman's one of the people whose been selling ads in the podcasting world for longer than anybody else. And I joke with him because I think-\n\nChristina:\n\nYeah, pioneered it basically.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nOh, yeah. He was one of the first. He joined Earwolf early on, but he was a Macworld writer. That was his dream job. And then he found out he was really good at selling podcast ads, and now he was acquired by his latest firm. He was acquired by Amazon, I think it was last year now. So he's an Amazon employee after going from Macworld to Stitcher and McClatchy and this whole series of acquisitions. He's at Amazon. Everybody who worked at Macworld is at some interesting company now.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThat's really fascinating. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nWhere is Jason Snow? Where is Jason Snow? It was always Jason Snow.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWhatever happened to Jason Snow?\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI don't know.\n\nChristina:\n\nI wish I could see him or hear him on podcast occasionally.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nIf he would just do a podcast. I don't know.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nHe's very shy.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. Yeah. Actually we have some news about Jason Snow, but that will come at a later date. Let me, now that I've teased you, talk about... Do any of you use Zapier? I'm such a Zapier fan. I'm sponsor for this segment of this weekend too.\n\nChristina:\n\nI do. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah, it's so great. We use it as part of our big workflow. So whenever I bookmark a story in a variety of places, I have a Zapier script that will automatically post it to Twitter. Post it to a couple places, but then also put it... Post it on Twitter [inaudible 01:16:04], but then also put it in a spreadsheet, Google spreadsheet, for our producer so they can quickly import it into our show rundowns. That's just one of many things you can do with Zapier.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI want to point especially to people in business. If you're trying to grow a business, you know how many hats you wear, how many things you do. Wouldn't it be nice to eliminate the routine operation tasks that eat up your time? Still get them done, but have them done automatically. Things like lead management, employee onboarding, customer support. Zapier does that. And you're not coding, but it's like coding. It actually makes it... This is one of the things about being a coder. You know that if you would just take a little time, you could get this thing done automatically and you never have to spend a minute doing it again. But sometimes it's easier just to keep doing it over and over and over again. That's why Zapier is so great, it makes it easy to connect all your apps, automate routine tasks, streamline your processes, do the things the computer is really good at doing.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nIt doesn't make mistakes. It does it the same way every single time. It does it automatically. Does it without you thinking about it. It frees you up to do the things you're good at, to use your big brain to prioritize customer and client needs to make your business succeed. It's the power of automation, possible for everyone. You don't have to be a coder. I use Zapier, love Zapier, and I'm always thinking of new ways to use Zapier. It makes it easy for anyone to get started with business automation. No coding necessary. And Zapier has the biggest collection of apps, 4,000 of the most popular apps businesses use every day. So I mentioned Google Sheets for instance, Twitter, Google Sheets, RSS feeds, QuickBooks, Facebook, Google Ads, imagine you have a whole process that automatically buys some Google Ads every time you announce something of this and that. You can automate just about any workflow imaginable.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nBy the way, you're not on your own. They have thousands of templates to get you started to give you ideas, to show you what to do. Zapier sends me an email every week saying how much time I spent. The average user saves over $10,000 in recovered time every year. Getting a Zapier subscription probably will be the best thing, the best money saver, you could imagine. No wonder 1.8 million people in businesses, including me, use Zapier to streamline their work and find more time for what matters most. We use it like crazy at TWiT. See for yourself why teams at Airtable and Dropbox and HubSpot and Zendesk and thousands of other companies use Zapier every day to automate business.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd if you're just home automation, if you're doing stuff around the house, it's really fun to use Zapier. I have the lights dim at sunrise. It's just so many things you can do with Zapier. Try it for free today at zapier.com/twit. Yeah, free trial. Zapier, Z-A-P-I-E-R.com/twit. It'll be amazing. You won't believe the things you can do with Zapier. Thank you Zapier for supporting TWiT. And thank you for supporting us by using that address zapier.com/twit.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThis is a story I zapped this morning over to my Pinboard. I found this interesting. There was one line in it that was particularly interesting. You probably saw this on the news. The Department of Justice seized phones from two attorneys involved in the January 6th probe. John Eastman, the Trump campaign legal advisor. Jeffrey Clark, the former justice department official who was supposed to become attorney general. But this is where I found it interesting. They were iPhones. John Eastman claimed he left a restaurant on June 22nd and federal agents confronted him, took his iPhone 12 Pro, then served him with a warrant. And then quote, \"He was forced to provide biometric data to unlock the phone.\" Now that stopped me right there in my tracks. I thought that was very interesting. First of all, the federal agents knew enough to not give him a moment to react, take the phone first before you give him the warrant.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd then it's an iPhone 12, so I think what they probably did is say, \"Hey, John, look here. Is this your phone?\" And then it unlocked and then they probably had a Cellebrite tool or something similar, plugged it in, sucked all the data out of it. Now, of course, they kept the phone. It's interesting for a couple of reasons. One, January 6th was a while ago. Like a year and a half ago. They still think there's something on that phone that's worth... A judge obviously did or he wouldn't have signed the warrant.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah. Well, before we move on, I don't think it was, \"Look at your... Is this your phone?\" Because they didn't say they tricked him into-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nForced.\n\nChristina:\n\nNo, I think they compelled him. I think they forced him.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThey forced him.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nSo they sat on his chest and two people grabbed his ears and... Who knows? What does that mean \"forced\"? I mean that's just... That's his language, remember that.\n\nChristina:\n\nLook, they probably told him... And this is my guess. My guess is that they probably told him, \"If you do not use your face to unlock this, we will arrest you.\"\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah.\n\nChristina:\n\nThis is what I'm guessing happened. I don't know, but I'm guessing that's how they compelled him to do it versus... With other biometrics like your fingerprint or your password, rather, they can't force you to give them the passcode.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd that's where this gets really interesting. So the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protects you against unreasonable search and seizure. And the Fifth Amendment protects you against incriminating yourself. And this is where courts have gone, by the way, in two different directions. But in general, the gist is biometrics is not self-incrimination. Putting your fingerprint on a fingerprint reader or your face in the face ID is not self-incrimination, where giving a passcode would be.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThis is why everyone should learn the quick presses that you need to do when you want lock your phone.\n\nChristina:\n\nExactly. The double tap. Although-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nJohn Gruber had a piece in Daring Fireball saying, \"Hey, by the way, just so you don't know. Here's how you can lock your phone real quick before the Fed sees it.\"\n\nChristina:\n\nI did that before I was... I do that when I'm in the airport. I absolutely do that because I don't... And I've been doing that for years because I don't want to be in that situation. I will say, and I'm only being a little bit flippant here, but it would be nice if a constitutional law scholar... We can question many of his other things, but it would be nice if a constitutional law scholar would've maybe declined to unlock his phone and actually force this issue. I'm sorry, but Eastman is a constitutional law scholar. This would've been-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThat's his business. He teaches it.\n\nChristina:\n\nIt is. To be completely candid, putting how you feel about his other credentials aside, I don't really care; I don't agree with him on many things, but it seems this was a really missed opportunity for what could have been a really interesting legal case. Especially by someone with his credentials if he had just basically said, \"No, I'm not going to unlock my phone.\" I don't know.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nIt's interesting-\n\nChristina:\n\nIf it were me, I would like to think I would go to jail. To me, I would like to say, and I can't say this definitively... I've not been in this situation, I don't want to be in this situation. But to me, I would like to think that I would spend a night in jail before I were to do that.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nHe may have felt like that would look like incriminating behavior. I don't know. Like he had something to hide. I have to think-\n\nChristina:\n\nHe's a constitutional law scholar. I don't know.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. I have to think a year and a half after January 6th, if there is still something on that phone, I'd be shocked. What could be on there that... I would think he would've... Maybe he didn't think it... Maybe he says, \"I didn't do anything wrong, so I'm not going to wipe my phone. I'll keep all those texts.\"\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nEvidence of witness intimidation.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah. Maybe because that's recent, right?\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThat's recent.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThe question is... None of these people... \"These people\" meaning the Trump officials. But nobody in government and nobody above a certain age, just about, is very clever with this data at all. You keep hearing these cases where people didn't wipe anything. They're posting pictures with GPS coordinates. So you just want the raw data because it's often just right there.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nJohn Gruber a week ago had-\n\nChristina:\n\nHave we learned nothing from the Mafia? I mean genuinely.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nWell, I remember it's-\n\nChristina:\n\nThe mob is good about this stuff, right? I mean usually-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI remember talking to these Secret Service agents many years ago who said, \"It's not a big deal. They almost always give us the password.\" It's like, \"Crooks!\" Yeah, fine. Whatever. I don't know. Anyway, just in case you don't know. By the way, again, there have been courts that have ruled that you have to give that password. Who was it was in jail for two years for contempt because he didn't unlock his hard drive? He was an accused child molester and he apparently thought there was something on that drive he didn't want law enforcement to see. Law enforcement thought there was something on the drive they wanted to see. He refused to give his encryption password up. Spent some time in jail. He's out of jail, but never did unlock that. But he was imprisoned for not giving up the password and the courts at the time said that is not self-incrimination. And it had something to do with whether the police knew that information was on there or it was a fishing expedition.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nOh, I see.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nSo it's obviously-\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nEither way it's a shorter sentence for sure.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nTwo years. Much easier. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah, for child pornography on the internet. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nSo, the theory is... And Gruber's theory is, what do you tap the... What do you do? You tap this twice? I can't even remember now. You can make it so that it's not... Yeah, I think I-\n\nChristina:\n\nYou just hit the button twice and basically-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd then it will go into a mode where you have to enter the passcode to get in. And the theory is now you've protected it because the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment prevents them from forcing you to give them the passcode. Whereas the courts have ruled it is not incriminating to get your face ID, which is weird.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nOr fingerprint.\n\nChristina:\n\nHere's what it is if you're on one of the newer phones. You press the lower volume button and then the side button at the same time until you're going to feel a feedback. Like if you've got the vibration on, you'll get the vibration feedback.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nSo you can have it in your pocket. This is what Gruber says, you don't have to look at it. You just have it in your pocket. You go, \"Here come the federal officers.\" You press the two and then it buzzes. And now it says \"slide to turn off\", it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to have to do the passcode to get back into that.\n\nChristina:\n\nExactly. Exactly. Yeah. So you have it enabled it's just basically these two buttons and then hold the two together.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nSo if you are in an indicted conspiracy in the January 6th insurrection, you might want to make a note of that.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nOr to quote the famous XKCD strip. \"Just someone brings up a wrench at you and that's how you get the password.\" You're dealing with criminals or governments that don't believe in the-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWell, that's true. It's not going to work unless the rule of law is rock solid.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nIf you were the January 6th people, you don't need to get their phone. They posted the evidence from their own phones.\n\nChristina:\n\nRight. I was going to say they live streamed it. In many cases they were literally live streaming it.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThey were taking videos and posting them.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nOkay. John says, \"Never, ever hand your phone to a cop or anyone vaguely cop-like, like the rent-a-cop's working for the TSA. If they tell you you must, refuse. They can and will lie to you about this. If you really need to hand it over, they'll take it from you. And they won't get anything from it because you've already hard locked it. And you know you cannot be required to give them your passcode.\" That really is a little bit of an optimistic point of view. They're going to have me in airport jail and I'm, \"Can't give me... You can't require me to give you my passcode.\" \"Well, here's a wrench. Here's your head. Would you like to do to have a meeting?\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah. And then that's when they unplug the video camera in the interrogation room.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah, exactly. Reading this article, that caught my eye because he said they forced me to unlock the phone, to give him biometric information. I thought that was very interesting. And you're right, Christina, here's a constitutional lawyer, why did he do so?\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nAlthough weirdly the warrant... I'm looking again here, this is from the CNN article here. The warrant said that they couldn't force him to give up biometric information. So he's claiming they did and yet perhaps he did it voluntarily.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nOh, that's why he's saying it. Oh, now I get it.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah, because the warrant... So then that could be the fruit of the poisoned tree.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThere you go. Yeah. So you see he knows what he's doing. He is using his constitutional noggin.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nAnd then there may be a great deal of exaggeration. I mean Rudy Giuliani said he was assaulted and somebody-\n\nChristina:\n\nThis is true.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI had a whole conversation. My kids were laughing at Rudy Giuliani being hit and I was like, \"Look, he's an old man. He's clearly not in good health. He's not... It won't be... Somebody came up.\" And then I saw the footage and I'm like, \"Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\" I apologize, I didn't mean to be a [inaudible 01:29:52]. I just don't want you to laugh at an old man being hit. I don't agree with assault. No one should be-\n\nChristina:\n\nFeel like I'm very sorry.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah, no one should be touched without their permission. The human body autonomy. But I'm like, \"all right, the guy just tapped. He just touched the back and said \"scumbag\".\" all right. I'm sorry.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\n\"He beat me up!\" What do we think about crypto's crash? Let me just check it.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYay. Hurray. Yeah. Sorry.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\n19,200. You know what? I think it has a lot to do with how much Bitcoin you have.\n\nChristina:\n\nI was going to say, I think it depends on how exposed you are. Look, my Robin Hood adventures with my Dogecoin stuff which I... Look, I did get my initial money out of it. The additional stuff I put into, I did not. But I'm so down, which is... It's hilarious to me. But I'm not exposed. I do worry about the businesses, legitimate businesses, and banks and finance institutions that heavily expose themselves to this stuff when it was going up and up and up. Even if we all... If the collective wisdom on this panel is to be more skeptical of crypto, if not against it, I tend to be more on the skeptical side rather than just anti. I think that we can agree that having this level of downturn is not great. I mean there's-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWell, I feel for anybody who lost their rent money on it.\n\nChristina:\n\nSame.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI think we've been, at least in the last year or two, pretty clear that you would be mistaken to put Bitcoin in your 401(k) let's say. And I even am pretty down on NFT's. I feel like NFT's are absolute scams. What were you going to say, Glenn? About-\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nYeah. It's just when you have celebrities. I think that this-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nOh, yeah. Matt Damon saying \"Fortune favors the brave. Don't be a coward, buy Bitcoin.\"\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI think this was the joke before the joke, quote unquote, before the great depression was like, \"When your cab driver is giving you stock tips, you know that the market's about to fall.\" Right?\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah, that's right.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nBecause it's not that individuals shouldn't be invested in the broader market because the market, as a whole, over any long period of time, like 15 plus years, it has a high rate of return relative to almost every other thing you could put your money into. But it's when you buy individual stocks or bonds or you invest in gold or other commodities or something as completely speculative as Bitcoin or Ethereum, you're almost guaranteed to fail over the short term. Even if there's a good long term response because you can't, unless you have a certain amount of money, you can't summon the resources to stay in during the downtime. So I feel for all the people who were talked into it by celebrities where they're like, \"Oh, well, this wouldn't be on television and Matt Damon or other people wouldn't do this because they...\" I don't know. We're not talking about... So Dan Aykroyd and his Crystal Skull Vodka or something.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWhich I have a bottle of, by the way.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nIs it good?\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI haven't opened it, but Dan Aykroyd did autograph it, but then I smudged it because it was on glass. So I have a bottle signed by-\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nBuy into it.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nBut...\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nBut I'm sorry. But I just mean like when you get retail investors being convinced that this is an investment that can't go down or being promised things in a way that there's a dispute. I'm blanking at which currency right now has frozen withdrawals and they had a literal FDIC inaccurate thing that said your deposits are protected by the FDIC.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd they're not.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThey're not. They weren't. And people are posting and I think they're claiming that they didn't have anything... I don't want to mention the name of the company because I can't remember the name at the moment, but the nuance was they're claiming they never did and people are posting pictures from chat sessions with customer support. They're posting pictures from our internet archive of what they said. So if you're an individual, how do you deal with fraud? So I feel for all those people. The Winklevoss twins, do I feel for them? They're probably still up 12000%, even if they're down 60% for the year.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nAnd they have a band and, unfortunately, their band is not called The Winklevie. But I think the problem is that, as you mentioned Glenn, everything you said points to the fact that everybody looks at it like an investment. It's supposed to be a currency. And this desire to get rich quick without employing anyone, without building anything, making anything, feeding anyone, is... And with, I think, most of us on this show talking until we're blue in the face about what a, ultimately a dangerous, risky thing it is. \"Leo, you're the best poster child for the risks of password management.\"\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI still have my wallet. Let me point out I got it. I just can't get into it. That's all.\n\nChristina:\n\nYou just can't get into it.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nBut you were talking-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nMy wallet is FDIC insured, I want to...\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nThat's right. You can get it replaced by any other leather wallet you want. The fact is, as the value goes down, people want to buy in Cetera. It may come back, may not.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nBuy the dips. As long as the dips are the bottom and not the top.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI stuck some more money into my... No, this is not financial advice, but I stuck some more money into Mira when it took a big dive because I'm like, \"Well, this is the...\" You know.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nYeah, you're young yet.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nI'm young yet. I got a few more years.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nI lost 25% on my retirement.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nWell, just hold on. Hold on, Leo. It'll come back. But I mean-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nWell, it just means I have to work for another 10 years. That's all.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nOh, my gosh. Over any extended period of time the stock market, on average, it performs very well. So it's just do you have the wherewithal to not go, \"Bwah,\" when this happens? It's very hard. And some people don't have the money to not or they've got-\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nMy favorite ad was the FTX ad with Larry David on the Super Bowl. I think that's the equivalent of a cab driver giving you a tip. When you see these crypto companies starting to advertising the Super Bowl, you know we're somehow at this peak thing in this bubble. Larry David, as the boomer, saying, \"The wheel is a terrible idea coming.\" Everything's a terrible idea. And then they ask him about Bitcoin. \"Terrible idea, and I know what I'm talking about. I would never get...\" Which was mocking people of my age for saying, \"Oh, crypto's no good.\" And the implication is, \"Okay, boomer, you just don't understand the modern world.\" Well, now there's a lot of boomers going, \"Aha.\" I don't think Larry David, by the way, was paid in Bitcoin for that commercial.\n\nGlenn Fleishman:\n\nNo.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nIt did get me interested though in FTX which, by the way, is now buying up all the failing crypto companies.\n\nChristina:\n\nAll the other ones. I was going to say.\n\nLeo Laporte:\n\nThis is a very interesting company. Sam Bankman-Fried who founded it, is 30 years old. He's worth 24 billion dollars according to Forbes. He got out of... He was at Stanford. His parents were professors at Stanford Law School. He was born on the Stanford campus. He went to MIT. I love this Wikipedia post, he blogged in 2012 about utilitarianism,"
