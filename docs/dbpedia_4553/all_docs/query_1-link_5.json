Leo Laporte here. The Tech Guy, time to talk computers, the internet, home theater, digital photography, smart phones, smart watches space. We got a lot coming up a lot. There's gonna be a jam packed day full of goodness car guy, Sam Abuelsamid coming up in just a little bit. Next hour. We will we will talk about photography with Chris Marquardt and the following hour. We're gonna talk about space with Rod Pyle, between I'll be taking your calls. 88 88, ask Leo. A jampacked Sunday extravaganza 8 8 8 8 2 7 5 5 3 6. One of our chatters Kalia says it sounds like I say idiot. Idiot. <laugh> idiot, idiot. Ask Leo <laugh>. I am definitely not saying that. Okay. I don't know why you hear that, but it's not. It's 8, 8, 8, 8 as in the number 8 8 8 8 2 7 5 5 3 6. Or if you prefer idiot, idiot, ask Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:34):\n\n<Laugh> the website where we put all at James ARVO writes us all down. He puts it up on the website, tech guy labs.com, tech guy labs.com. Thank you, James. What else? There's a chat room. I call him team tech guy. If you if you have a browser, you can go to irc.twi.tv or use an IRC client. That's the old fashioned form of chat predates even AOL's instant messenger. That's how old it is. Predates the worldwide web irc.twi.tv, not my chat room. Well, let me think about this. It might actually been doing this for a long time. First started using chat in the early nineties and it was IRC back then, even then IRC was kind of old. The world wide web was invented in 1989. IRC predates that. But I started doing that when I started doing this kind of a show that I wasn't, I hadn't yet earned the sober okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:39):\n\nTech Guy. I was just a guy answering tech questions in San Francisco back in, I think that was B 93 94, thereabouts. And we had the chat room, which was, oh, you know, it's funny. I can't now when I don't, when I try to do something without a chat room, even brush my teeth, I don't, it's like, I don't know. I need the, I need the feedback. How am I doing so you can <laugh> you can, you can, you can join us in the chat room. I, and help me brush my teeth or whatever. 88, 88, ask Leo there. I think that's everything you need to know.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:23):\n\nThere's a little bit of noise coming out these days. Remember when apple wasn't so long ago, was it a couple months ago? Ios? 15. Maybe it was even 14 to five came out and apple started popping up that thing. You've seen it by now. If you have an iPhone started popping up thing that said this app wants to track you, even when you're not using it. Is that okay? <Laugh> and really, I think apple, when it writes it, it's kind of saying it in its mind that way are you sure? Is that okay? And and of course, something like 80% of the people who see that say no, of course not you. Don't why I would, why would you know, Snapchat have to see what I'm doing with other apps? No, that's ridiculous. When I'm using Snapchat, that's one thing it could, you know, it needs to know perhaps my geographic location to put that on my snap or whatever.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:14):\n\nThat's fine, but not when I'm not using you. No, don't be ridiculous. So people say no, and Facebook was all up in arms saying, oh, you Facebook, of course it's gonna hit their bottom line. If they can't track you everywhere you go, cuz they need to know everything about you so that they can go to advertisers and say, I have a 33 year old woman who lives in Virginia, who is just waiting to see your advertisement and the advertisers go well, it's nice. Cause I don't wanna get a 34 year old woman in Virginia. I only want the 33. That kind of thing. That tracking is very valuable to Facebook. So Facebook immediately now they can't really say, well it's gonna hurt us because you know, nobody cares. So they say that's gonna hurt small business, huh? Well, yeah, because those small businesses are advertisers on Facebook. They won't get the kind of granular information about who they're buying, what advertisements who's seeing your advertisements. So I guess you could, you know, it's not, it's not a complete lie to say, oh, it's gonna hurt small businesses except we are learning. Now, here we are a few down the road and it doesn't hurt anybody at all.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:22):\n\nIt hurt any anybody at all seven months, we've had this just saw a study that said snap, Snapchats makers, Facebook and others have found perfectly valid ways to get around apples do not track. In fact, some are even calling it privacy theater, privacy theater. It's like, it's not real privacy. You just it's up on the pretend, pretend privacy. Of course there's always been the issue that apple could see everything anyway, you know, they could, they, they, they know exactly what you're doing with the phone at any, at any time that's called first party information. What apple was doing is blocking third party information stuff from a company's not apple. Google has proposed the same thing with cookies, no more third party cookies. They said only we only, we at Google the great Google, great not power for Google pay no attention to the man behind the curtain should know what you're up to.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:24):\n\nFacebook has plenty of first party data whenever you're using Facebook. Right? In fact, frankly, Facebook has a huge amount of data about you all the time. Because as you go around the internet, you know those like buttons, you see the little thumbs up buttons. You don't even have to click that for Facebook to know you're visiting that page. It just sends a little signal. It says, Leo's here. You don't even click it. Just the fact that you're visiting that page sends a signal back to Facebook. So Facebook, in fact, Facebook can collect information, but people who aren't even Facebook members carbo in the tech dirt blog, which is all about privacy and security. He said, advertisers cried like a disappointed toddler. Christmas. When apple came out with this in 14 five by September last, this couple of months ago, researchers began to notice, eh, Apple's opt out system, not too much.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:16):\n\nAnyway. It only really blocks makers from accessing one little bit of data. The what that apple calls the ID FA the ID for advertisers just turns that off. But as Carl points out, there are many ways for app makers to track you without that little ID FA and that's exactly what they, they started doing immediately, including Facebook, they collect just, you know, information about what IP address you're on, what your battery charges, what your volume level is. There's all sorts of stuff. How much storage is left? And you might say, well, what do they care about? How much storage I have on my phone? Well, you combine all these different points and it's like a fingerprint. It can start to identify you more specifically like, well, Leo had 38% battery charge. He's got this IP addresses volume levels, a seven he's only got 23 gigabytes left on his phone. That's Leo <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:21):\n\nSo essentially that when you check that box, do not track me. It makes you feel good, makes apple feel good or make money, which kind of is the same thing. But it's actually not doing anything. Privacy advocates in the press, not Carl Wrights. This is giving apple users a false sense of security without really fixing much financial times publishing articles, which they said seven months later, they said in English accent, cause they're from Britain seven months later, companies, including snap and Facebook have been allowed to keep sharing user levels signals on iPhones. So long as that data is, and I'm gonna put this in quotes, anonymized and aggregated rather than tied to specific user profiles. So they don't know what Leo's up to, but they know what people like Leo are up to. Unfortunately, as we have learned, you can't really anonymize data because of things like, well, I know your battery level. <Laugh> I know how much storage you have left. I know what size your screen is. And I, you know, pretty easy to de-anonymize this stuff.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:25):\n\nCarl says, people use this as a, get outta jail free card. Well we're anonymizing it. No, but, but inside they go, yeah <laugh> they believed it. <Laugh> Apple's opt out button. He writes is largely decorative helping the company brand itself as hyper privacy, conscious without actually doing any heavy lifting. Isn't that nice? I thought I just passed that along. Maybe I shouldn't, you know, it's nice. Just feel good. I think the real truth of the matter is everybody knows what you're doing on the internet. Just, you know, unless you're taking extreme measures more than any normal user would be willing to take. Everybody knows what you're doing on the internet. So, you know, chill man until we get real privacy laws until companies start adhering to those laws, not finding loopholes, none of which is gonna happen anytime soon, you might as well.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:26):\n\nJust assume if you're on the internet, Facebook, Google, apple, all know what you're doing. Eighty eight, eighty eight ask Leo is a phone number. Just sounds kind of down. Doesn't it? I mean, you know, what are they doing with that? All they're doing is selling advertising against it. I mean, it's not, I mean, okay, so maybe, you know, if police ask they, you, they, they could say, well, we know where Leo was on the night of December 10th at 3:00 PM. We know exactly where he was. I guess, you know, it's that kind of thing. What are you gonna do? 88, 80, 80, 88, 88. Idiot, idiot ask Le that's the phone number? Give me a ring. And again, when you hear something on the show, you don't have to remember it. I'll put some of these articles up on the show. No, it's, I'll give him to James to do that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:14):\n\nHe's he's the guy who does all the work so that you don't have to write anything down. It's all here for you, doctor. I need 9, 9, 9, which is, does doesn't do anything in the us. This guy must be from some other country. Hello, Kim, but idiot. Idiot. Idiot works. <Laugh> you know when, once golly has said that now I can't stop hearing idiot. Idiot ask Leo. And I, I think it's me. That's the idiot. When I maybe I'm just taking it too personally. No, 88, 88. I'm gonna say that very carefully. 88, 88, 88. Ask Leo, apparently cornea. Knock her Harrington, our chat room 9 99 is British for 9 1 1. Oh, okay.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:12:58):\n\nThen, then, then it makes sense. We know where that art, who,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:01):\n\nWho is that? Who is that artist? Professor? Laura musical director. Milo. Oh, Nick low. Oh, Nick low Milo. Nick lololo. Is that like Dulo all right, globe. Who should I, I'm sorry. I'm a little punchy this morning. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Who should I talk to first? Let's go to\n\nKim Schaffer (00:13:26):\n\nJan Manhattan beach wants to, you know, you know, when you buy an appliance and they always try to sell you on the extra warranty. Yeah. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:35):\n\nIt's kind of like that, but kinda like that, but not kinda like that, but not all right. More with her website. Thank you, Kim sheer. You're welcome. Hello, Jan from Manhattan beach, Leo Laporte, The Tech Guy.\n\nJan (caller) (00:13:46):\n\nHi Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:46):\n\nHey Jan. I hear ya\n\nJan (caller) (00:13:49):\n\nOkay good. I had to renew my domain names with Google.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:56):\n\nI did. Yes. They're a domain registrar.\n\nJan (caller) (00:13:59):\n\nYes. Remembering that you said good to okay. To go to Google and then maybe do my website with somebody\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:07):\n\nElse. Yeah, I like doing it that way. Cuz then it's, you're not held hostage. So if you, you know, when you go to Goda and register domain name and do your website and you want, now you gotta move two things, but if you have it registered say at Google and your website's at GoDaddy, you just tell Google, Hey, I'm moving to WordPress and that's all you have to do. So what's going on?\n\nJan (caller) (00:14:29):\n\nWell what they added was the full domain privacy and protection. Yes. For 20 more.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:39):\n\nOh, well you don't want that actually. You might want that.\n\nJan (caller) (00:14:43):\n\nOkay. What would it have done? They said if I didn't, I would be my website and personal info would be made available\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:53):\n\nTo the world. Yeah. It's kinda shocking that they charge 20 bucks. I'm a little disappointed to be honest with you. Oh one of the reasons Google domains is popular is because they're very, they're relatively inexpensive. How much was the price of your domain? The\n\nJan (caller) (00:15:07):\n\nDomain was 38 bucks.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:08):\n\nWell that's well per a year, but\n\nJan (caller) (00:15:11):\n\nThis is no. It would've that's for two years.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:14):\n\nTwo years, so 19 bucks a year. Okay. So a .com address should be around $10 a year. So Google. Okay. I'm gonna now change my attitude about Google's domains and say, well, maybe they aren't the best pricing. And, and on a, in my opinion, they should also give you domain privacy for free. Yes, because, so here's how, here's how it officially works. When, so Google is a, what they call a registrar, which means that they have been approved by the international corporation for assigned names and numbers I can, which is a non-government body that oversees the internet. They're the ones that keep the big phone books. There's 13 of them. The, they call 'em the DNS servers that, that match domain names to IP addresses. That's, that's how it works. Somebody will you know, enter in, in their browser Jans, great website.com and then their browser will look it up in the big phone book and say, oh, that's 1 64, 3 dot nine, two, you know, your actual phone number and go there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:20):\n\nIt needs that number, not the name. And the beauty of that system is you can easily change hosts and have a new IP address, but it'll still be Jan's lovely website.com. So that's why that works that way. So domain registrars are basically affiliates of, I can, I can't approve them and they can charge whatever they want for the domain name. I can't, I don't know what the actual I can fees are, but it's under $10 a year so they can charge whatever they want. But the all they're really doing is connecting you up to the I can thing. Now, the way I can works, is it the name of the administrator, the support, you know, all those email addresses that are really all just you, Jan, those all are public. They're in a public directory who owns this website needs to be public, according to I can.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:07):\n\nSo what registrars do is they sell who is privacy. If you who is, is, is the directory search thing you could say, who is Jan's lovely website, and it'll give you the owner. And normally that would be your, your name, your address, your phone number, your email. But most people don't want that to be publicly available. So they use who is privacy, and that is a service that then when somebody looks up, Jan's lovely website, they get redirect to that service. And if they email that service, that service then goes, oh, we'll send that on a Jan. So they're hiding you shouldn't cost that much should not cost that much. I'm thinking of our we have a sponsor, hover.com that does domain registry and they throw that in for free. So I'm a little disappointed that Google's think they have enough money that they're charging extra for it. Do you want it? Yes. Unless you're using, as I do a post office box or a business address and a business email, and you don't care if people know that, but if it's your home address and home phone, definitely you should use privacy, Leo Laporte, The Tech Guy. So does that answer your question?\n\nJan (caller) (00:18:15):\n\nPretty much. Yeah, I,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:17):\n\nAre you sure you're going through domains.google.com?\n\nJan (caller) (00:18:21):\n\nI'm going through Google. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:24):\n\nUhhuh domains.google.com. Actually it's domains.google. There's no .com. Domains.Google. Cuz they own google.\n\nJan (caller) (00:18:33):\n\nI got a receipt from them. Yeah. Dot com. Domain renewal and it's Google. Huh?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:41):\n\nBoy that's I did not realize they charged that much. Yeah. Domains started $7 a year, email forwarding prime protection, one click click DNS sec, Google step two step verification included. So I'm wondering where you actually maybe ignore that. Look at you. See you can't it sounds like it might be a lie that it might be somebody posing as Google, cuz it's easy for them to see you register to Google domains. So did you send them any money?\n\nJan (caller) (00:19:13):\n\nI paid for it. I had 'em take off the two\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:18):\n\nLog to your Google domains account. Okay. With your Google account. Yes. I think that that was not Google.\n\nJan (caller) (00:19:27):\n\nOkay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:29):\n\nSo that that's, you know, that would be a actually wouldn't be surprising that that would be a scam because it's easy for them to see who has domains registered Google then send a spoof email saying, oh, by the way, 38 38 bucks. What is it? A what's the don't tell me the domain name. What's the dot after the.com. Oh no, no that wasn't through Google. That that's way too expensive. Wow. Go to go. <Laugh> go to domains.google. Okay. you can move it over there. Boy, that's puzzling that somebody's posing out there as a domain registrar. That bothers me. Me too. Yeah. If you go to domains.google, that's the real deal. Not.Com. Just domains.google. Okay. Cause they own.google and then there's a button on the page that says transfer domain. You already own maybe, maybe you should do that. Cuz that's Google does not charge for who is they? Shouldn't yeah. And they don't charge that much. They charge $8 a a year.\n\nJan (caller) (00:20:37):\n\nMm. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:41):\n\nThat's something else went on there. It's possible. You do have it registered there. Somebody noticed that sent you a spurious email that looks like it was from Google saying, Hey, you gotta renew time to renew. And then, and then that was a lie. Let's see, here's a.com. It's $12. This is go. Golia sent this to me. And it says there's a check box for $12 for one year privacy protection is on. So whoever's charging you that $20 extra a year is not your friend and not Google.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:17):\n\nWow. Unless, unless you have well, it's a.com. No. you know, you can now it's time for you to do the, who is if you type in, in the Google who is, and your name, one word who is, and you know the name of your website, it will give you the, who is record for your website. Actually it won't will it, you need to still go to a who is site, but you can look up your domain and see what registrar it is. And if it's not Google, it probably is Google. And somebody's just trying to get you extra money out of you, I would guess.\n\nJan (caller) (00:21:56):\n\nThat could be too. Yeah. Yeah. I, I can also cha challenge it with my credit card\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:04):\n\nCompany. Yeah. Well you wanna figure out what it is first, make sure, but it doesn't sound like Google to be honest with you\n\nJan (caller) (00:22:11):\n\nBoy. But great, great\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:14):\n\nInfo. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for asking. I'm glad you did. I've had this conversation with Abby before Abby sometimes will say to me, I wanna buy DOJ going. I've mentioned this before dad. I'm ready to, I'm ready to get into crypto. I say, Abby, how's your retirement savings going? <Laugh> she said, what? Retirement savings, Abby, my son too. You know, he's doing quite well. I say you're putting money aside for your old age, cuz guess what? You get old faster than you think. Or maybe you're saving for your kids' college fund or a house. It's fine. It's fine. You know, if you wanna play the market, you know, and be diamond hands and buy stocks. Okay, fine day trading is fun, but it is not a path to wealth building. So, eh, put a little fun money aside. That's fine. But really what you gotta be doing is growing your long term wealth for your future.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:11):\n\nI am so glad I did this. You should too.

Now back to the show, it's time to talk cars in automotive technology with Sam bull salmon, principal researcher at guide house insights and host of the wheel bearings podcast, which he just did this morning@wheelbearings.media. Before we get to your segment Sam, I just wanna mention talking to Jan off the air. I think maybe that was a Phish scam Google's domains. If you're getting a.com about 12 bucks a year, including who is privacy. So this 38 bucks for two years and another 20 bucks for domain privacy that ain't Google. So maybe that's a Phish scam or something like that. But Google I always thought Google was domains were among the most inexpensive Google's domains are at domains.google and yes, they do include privacy. So you shouldn't have to pay extra for it. Sam is sitting in front of a beautiful vehicle that Tesla wants to call the cyber truck. <Laugh> hi Sam.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:03):\n\nHi Leo. So yeah, we've probably all seen the Cyber truck at some point or another. Over last couple\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:10):\n\nOf years, this was the best rollout of product rollout ever, where Elon Musk wants to show that the windows are Bulletproof and drops a bowling ball into it and it goes crash <laugh> smashes.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:22):\n\nAnd then, and then <affirmative> and then just to prove that it was that it really was, they did it again and it smashed again, oh, two windows and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:29):\n\nThen the poor guy, and I shouldn't say poor guy, richest man in the world has to stand in front of the broken glass for the rest of his presentation. They apparently really didn't think it would break anyway, that that was a kind of a memorable event.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:42):\n\nYeah. And that was too, just about just over two years. Yeah, just over two years ago that that happened. Yeah. There's there's the video it's actually Franon halau, who's the head of design at Tesla who tossed the, they, their excuse was ball\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:57):\n\nBearing. It worked in rehearsal and maybe we weakened the glass after doing it too many times. Oh, Lordy. Lordy. Okay. So the cyber truck is still not out anyway, so\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:28:09):\n\nNo, and it, it probably won't be for at least another year, probably into early 20, 23. From what we've heard the, the cyber truck is supposed to use Tesla's new, larger 46, 80 lith I on cells. And they are having some difficulties with scaling up production of those. And so they're, they're not ready to build this thing yet. And, and they've also had to do some re-engineering, but the, the, the reason I wanted to talk a little bit about it today is not so much about the Cybert truck specifically, but one of the questions that I offer and hear from people is, you know, you see these really wild looking concept cars at auto shows that, you know, oftentimes really cool looking. And then, you know, a few years later you get a production car and it's like, eh, it doesn't look so much like that concept car did.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:29:02):\n\nThere's a few little hints here and there, you, and I wonder, you know, why don't manufacturers build the concepts? And the, some new photos came out this week. Somebody was flying a drone near a Tesla facility in California and spotted what appears to be a new S saber truck prototype. You know, previous, prior to this, we'd only ever seen one example of the S Cybert truck, which was the same one that was at the reveal event two years ago. And that one, when we saw that had no side mirrors had no windshield wipers was missing a lot of stuff that you, you know, kind of need on production vehicles more\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:45):\n\nThan need are legally required to have.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:29:48):\n\nYeah. Yeah, absolutely. And, and even if it wasn't legally required, you, you definitely need those. You need to able to still windshield wipers. See how does the vehicle yes, yes. And so these, these new photos of this prototype among the more notable features in addition to the addition of the mirrors on the side is a really huge windshield wiper.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:11):\n\nYeah. So one wiper for the whole giant windshield.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:14):\n\nYeah. One big one that stretches all the way up along if you were sitting in the driver's seat, it would be stretching up along the left hand side along the a pillar. And in fact, when you look at look at it from other angles, you can see there's actually two separate wiper blades on there because nobody makes a wiper blade this long <laugh> and, you know, just\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:35):\n\nSo Tesla, they just, nothing like anybody else does. That would be a mistake. Yeah.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:41):\n\nThe, and, and this, you know, this is an example of why, you know, production vehicles often don't look like concepts because a lot of things that designers will do on a concept just don't translate very well to production. Like in the case of the cyber truck, you know, it's got this shape, it looks like a giant stainless steel door stop. And when you look at it in profile, you know, there's basically a straight line that goes from the front edge of the hood all the way up to the peak of the roof. And then it slopes down from there, back to the back. So it looks like a triangle. The, you know, the result is that you have this windshield, you know, most cars, you look at the windshield, the windshield is roughly rectangular. You know, so <affirmative>, it's not as tall as it is white mm-hmm <affirmative> and you typically have two wiper blades, you know, one that's mounted on, on, in the middle and one that's mounted off to one side. You know, so you clears, you know, usually about 80 to 85% of the, the windshield area. Well, because the Cybert truck windshield is basically flat and also square. You need to have a really long windshield wiper blade to sweep all the way across the, we should point out though,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:49):\n\nThis is a drone photo of a, of a vehicle in the parking lot could very well be it's no more a release version than the prototype was, or the concept was, this is just something else.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:32:01):\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, it, it looks, and it looks in a lot of ways, very similar to the, the original one that we saw. I mean, there are some other subtle differences. Yeah. But I mean, it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:08):\n\nDoesn't mean anything that you're seeing this in the parking lot. Thank you very much\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:32:12):\n\nTrue. <Laugh> but you,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:14):\n\nI wouldn't waste a lot of energy on it. Maybe when the cyber truck comes out, then we can say, oh, interesting. Yeah. I\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:32:21):\n\nMean, you know, they've the, the indications from Tesla have been, you know, they will retain most of the the, the design of the original truck, the original vehicle that they showed. And if they do, I mean, this is one of the things that they're gonna have to do, you know, and, and because of the, the proportions of the windshield, you can't really do two wipers like you normally would because they would, they would be, you know, clashing into each other, you know, in order to reach all the way up to the top of the windshield, you need that long wiper arm there. And also the other problem with it here is that the, in the parked position, the wiper blade is up on long, the, a pillar. So it's parked vertically, which means that when you're driving along, you know, normally you already have a bad blind spot at the pillar there, and now it's gonna be even worse because you've got this blade, this wiper arm there, and you can't, you know, again, because they've got this continuous surface from the hood up to the peak of the roof you can't really park it.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:33:20):\n\nThere's nowhere to hide it down at the base of the windshield like you do on most cars. And so it's gonna be sticking out there and it's gonna cause a lot of aerodynamic drag, if you parked it horizontally the way you normally would. So th this is the kind of challenge that designers have trying to go from concept to production vehicles. Another example that you often have is you know, you'll see cars on a show stand that have rear hinged back doors and no B pillar, you know, so the so-called suicide doors and, you know, almost never do you see those actually make it to the production version of the car? They always revert back to normal front hinge doors. The reason why they do the concept that way is so they can leave out that B pillar. So you can actually see the interior of the car when it's on the show stand, you know, they wanna show off all the cool stuff they've done inside, but they know they can't actually build it that way and pass the crash requirements.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:14):\n\nSo really the purpose of a concept vehicle, especially when you see 'em at trade shows is, is to cause buzz, not necess necessarily. Yeah. To say anything about what the final, in fact, many concept vehicles never make it out the door, right?\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:34:28):\n\nOh yeah. Mo most don't although in recent years we've seen fewer of the, the really outlandish concepts and more of what gets labeled as concepts is really just a lightly disguised version of the print option vehicle.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:43):\n\nWell, they just tweeted Volkswagen, just tweeted that they're gonna make a camper out of their electric buzz. So I hope that's more than a concept <laugh>\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:34:52):\n\nOh, that's definitely coming. They, they, they confirm that they are gonna build the ID buzz camper. I love that idea. We Don we don't know if the camper version's gonna come to the us market yet, but but gonna be available elsewhere,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:02):\n\nThey call it the California version. It better come to California. Sam bull, Sam principal, researcher guide, house insights, listen to his podcast. If you love talking about vehicles, wheel bearings, it's wherever you get your favorite podcast wheel bearings. And of course, Sam joins us every week. Thank you, Sam.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:35:19):\n\nThank you. Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:23):\n\nLisa laughs. At her Chevy bolt. She calls it a clown car cuz the windshield wipers go like this <laugh> yeah. And I guess, I don't know. Maybe that's cuz it's so small. I don't, I I'm sure there's an engineering. Yeah. For,\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:35:38):\n\nYeah. They, the, the bolt and some other cars have the the pivots for the windshield wiper arms at the outer corners. Right. And when, when you do that, you actually get more, more of the windshield area that's swept by the wiper blades. Oh. And that's, that's the other thing too about designed with the yeah. Cuz the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:55):\n\nSingle wipe on this thing is, is the not gonna, it's gonna be staring out the rainy window.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:35:59):\n\nYeah. At least at least a quarter maybe close to a third of the windshield wiper isn't or the windshield isn't even gonna be swept by this wiper blade. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:08):\n\nIt's funny. <Laugh> well again, I mean, who knows if this is\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:36:13):\n\nYeah. I mean they may, they may come up with something entirely different, but you know, and the, the, the problem is, you know, you have the challenge of this oddly shaped windshield and how do you keep it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:22):\n\nClean? Yeah. That's the question.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:36:24):\n\nYeah. So, I mean, there, there isn't really a good solution for this. I'm\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:27):\n\nGonna assume it, I may be wrong that the designers of the square windshield realize that this would raise an issue and thought about it. Maybe not.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:36:38):\n\nOh, I wouldn't necessarily assume <laugh> the designers may have Elon might not have cared.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:44):\n\nYeah. Right. That's part of the problem. God, I'm seeing these all sorts of horrific stuff about full self-driving.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:36:52):\n\nYeah. Well, and also I was on T w earlier this week with with Micah talking about the fact that they're you know, they're allowing games to be played on the screen in the car while the car's in motion. So geez. Tesla's had video games in their infotainment system for a number of years now and you know, that's fine. You know, if, if you're putting it there, you know, or Netflix, for example, you know, so while you're sitting at a charging station for half an hour or an hour, you know, you can play some games, you have something to occupy your time. Right. But the, you know, what you don't want is you don't want it to be AC you don't want it to be activated while the vehicle's in motion. Cuz you don't want the driver either playing games or being distracted by passenger Tesla said right. You know, well, it's be, we we're doing it. So the passengers can play except that it's right there in the driver's visibility. And you shouldn't, you shouldn't be doing that while the vehicle's in motion. That's just, that's just bad design. Yes.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:37:48):\n\nI agree. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:52):\n\nYou gonna do your usual thing flying.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:37:55):\n\nYeah. I can do that. Do that\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:56):\n\nThing you do so well.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:37:59):\n\nAll right. So let's see what we had here. Oh, somebody was commenting see, oh, Neander bear says I'm surprised Tesla. Doesn't use blown air for wipers. Like some aircraft aren't there cars that already do that. No, there are not any cars that do that. And actually if you look at aircraft you know, aside from things like fighter jets, if you look at certainly any airliner, they all have windshield wipers you know, really every airliner out there. Yeah. If you, if you look closely, if you get a close up, look at the cockpit area, they have windshield wipers. You know, because the, the problem with blown air especially for a car, maybe a little bit less so for an aircraft is you can blow a lot of the the water off of there. But you know, when you get beyond water, you know, when you, if you get mud spray or if you live somewhere where, you know, you get road salt being used that road salt sticks on air bugs, you're not gonna get splattered bugs off your windshield with with blown air, frankly, most of the time, you're not gonna get it off with a wood show wiper either, but windshield wipers are far more effective than blown air.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:39:09):\n\nOne area where we are seeing air being used though is on some of the autonomous vehicles to help minimize the impact of bugs and other debris on sensors. So they're using air, basically air curtains to try to deflect things away from the cameras and other sensors. And then when they do get really dirty, still have a wiper blade to clean 'em off.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:31):\n\nHang on. You wanna be here for the top? Sure. Hang on. <Affirmative> Leo LePort, <laugh> the tech guy, eighty eight eighty eight. Ask Leo the phone number, thanks to outta sync in our chat room for giving me the exact link that I should give. I should have given Jan to do the, who is look up on your domain. So if you have a domain, you wanna make sure if, if you think <laugh> that it's, that it's from Google, that it is from Google and not somebody else. My, my suspicion is she'd registered the domain with Google, but then she got email from a basically a, a scammer who noticed who knew that she had a Google account and and said, well, we're gonna send her what looks to be email from Google saying you owe us money. And I hope Jan didn't pay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:35):\n\nI think she did not. She was concerned. One of I getting as she should have been. So Jan, here's what you do and anybody who needs this, this is a good to know, look up dot I can.org. Remember I said, I can is the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, ICA n.org. And if you go to lookup, as in, look it up in the phone book dot I can.org, you can enter your do name and you'll get all the information that I can has about your domain name, including the registrar's name. And that's what you want. You want the registrar's name and it should say domains by Google, you know, Google or domains.google domains by Google, if that's the case. Okay, good. Now the good news is you can see if you have privacy, because you'll also get contact information in that lookup, including registrant, admin, technical billing, you know, for an individual that's gonna be well.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:32):\n\nAnd I'll, I'll give you if you wanna try it, I'll give you an example. You can do it for leoville.com, which is my one of my websites, L O V I L L e.com. That's registered at hover. So you should see under registrar two cows, which is the owner of hover as the as the registrar information. But if you look in the contact information, you'll see it says contact privacy incorporated. And there's a reason for that. I, you know, actually it doesn't matter to me because I'm pretty sure I register every domain with my business address anyway, but this is a good example. You'll see. The email is leoville.com at contact privacy.com, which means mail goes to them first and then is forwarded on to me. The phone number is a phone number in Toronto, not mine, obviously theirs mailing address is an address in Toronto cuz that's where contact privacy is.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:27):\n\nSo that means essentially my personal information is hidden. That's what you generally will want. And Google, according to, you know, domains.google gives you that as part of the price. And Golia just showed me what it would cost to set up a domain at Google right now, a.com domain. It was 12 bucks a year. So she Jan said she was paying 38 bucks for two years. That's not right. And then they wanted an additional $20 for domain privacy. That's definitely not right. That'd be a total of $29 a year for something Google charges, $12 a year. So my suspicion is it's either not Google or she did register it with Google, but now somebody's figured that out and has sent her a spurious email asking for more money. Don't pay it, don't pay it. And what I would do, anybody who has a domain name is look up your domain name, just to see what's public information. Look up.ican.org, eighty eight eighty eight, ask CLEs the phone number Stanley is on the line from bets, Ohio. How is Stanley?\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:43:36):\n\nHello, Leo. Hello? Are you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:38):\n\nStanley welcome.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:43:40):\n\n<Laugh> first of all, I wanna real quick say thanks for all the shows you've done over the years, cuz I've learned a ton and I really appreciate it because we're on the verge of licensing something we've created to ancestry.com real soon. So, and I'm a all self taught.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:56):\n\nI hope you're gonna make a ton of money Stanley.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:43:59):\n\nWell, I'll take you off to dinner if that happens.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:02):\n\n<Laugh> good luck. That's great. So you're selling, is it a program or con what are you selling?\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:44:08):\n\nIt's I guess it would be a program, but it's all internet based. Nice\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:12):\n\nAncestry. Ancestry wants it. That's great.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:44:16):\n\nThey have a great platform for looking back on your lineage and looking back family history, ours looks forward. They don't have anything like that yet.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:25):\n\nHow could you look forward? That's the future Stanley.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:44:29):\n\nThat's right, sir. But we have conquered it, I believe. Oh wow. Not wow. Necessarily looking for predictions. I'm sorry. Is it a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:40):\n\nPrediction?\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:44:42):\n\nNo, no. It's a way to leave message. Oh and messages.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:46):\n\nI like that for your, for your descendants. Oh, I love that idea. So if they go to ancestry.com to say, what did grandpa Stanley do? He then say, look, he left me a message.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:44:58):\n\nExactly. I love\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:59):\n\nThat idea. No wonder ancestry wants to buy it.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:45:04):\n\nWell, I'm sure we I'm sure. Hoping we'll wrap up the loose ends with them real soon. Congratulations. But I was real quick. I a six year old grandson in Dallas, Texas, I'm up here by the great lakes and I've got a message targeted the month and year that he should graduate high school. I hope I'm still here. Aw. I'm not June of 2034. I think it is. He's still gonna get that message from me at what I look like and sound like today. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:31):\n\nOh. So it's an audio and video message. That's I love that idea. I really like that idea. I think that's so cool. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:45:38):\n\nYeah, you can up upload your message right from your smartphone. You can make a message or delete it and do it or whatever. Oh neat. Yeah. We're we're really excited about it, but I, I, again, I don't wanna thank you because just being self-taught I've had to go through a lot of hurdles and learn a lot my own. So I thank you because you're one of the few people I've learned a ton from\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:01):\n\nOh, Stanley. You're welcome. I'm thrilled that it's working out. That's great.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:46:06):\n\nYeah. Thank you sir. Real quick question. I'm got a Dell 24 inch all in one that I love. This has been one of my favorite PCs. I use it in my home. I have a studio on the back end of the home, but I use it in the home, but I'm gonna be swapping out at two one terabyte hard drive for a Dell supplied, two terabyte hard drive. And I'm crossing my fingers. When I ask you this question, Leo, back in the day, I thought I knew that I'm you can't transfer or clone your programs over. Well, this is\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:40):\n\nA different situation because you're not changing the computer, just changing the drive. So if you were taking it, if you were taking the drive from the old on and putting it in a new computer would be problematic because the new computer has different hardware and different drivers. Oh, but in this case, you, my strong suggestion, in fact, Dell will almost certainly provide you with the program to do that. When you buy a, a hard drive, almost always the company that makes it. And they're only a couple left Western digital Seagate, Toshiba have all been merged together, but, but they will least give you a link to a drive cloning tool. And so the trick on that is to hook up that new drive to the old computer and clone the internal drive out to the external before you put it in. And at that point it should operate exactly the same because you're it's the same computer programs will go with it. Everything will go with it. Nothing's changed. You've just essentially swapped the tablecloth. Oh man, the settings should all be the same.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:47:43):\n\nYeah. Oh, you've made my day actually my, the rest of my year, cuz I thought I don't have the software at hand on all the programs I use and all that\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:51):\n\nStuff. I don't know what Dell does, but my guess is Dell will provide you with software. That'll do the copy and you're right. That's the problem. Now that's one of the reasons I like, you know, let's talk about the future, the modern world, you don't buy DVDs or CDs or floppy discs of your software. You download it. You typically you log into an account at Microsoft or somewhere and you can then download it and install it. And so going to a new computer is not nearly the hardship it used to be. But yeah, if you have a lot of older software that has discs associated or serial numbers associated. Yeah. That's a pain, but this, because you're not moving computers, shouldn't be a problem.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:48:30):\n\nOkay,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:30):\n\nGreat. Hey Stanley, what is what is, let me call us back when you sell your program so we can tell everybody, I guess if you, if you're an ancestry customer, you'll just be, you'll see it when it comes out. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:48:43):\n\nWe, we currently have 30, I think it's 3,700 and some customers just by\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:48):\n\nOne. What's the website.\n\nSpeaker 5 (00:48:50):\n\nIt is picture yourself, remembered.com.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:54):\n\nI love that. Picture yourself. Remembered.Com. Oh, we left out a dash. Did we? Oh, well picture-yourself.com. All right, Sammy, your turn. Now I turn to get a cup of coffee, your turn to take over the tech guy show.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:17):\n\nOkay. Sounds good.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:19):\n\nYou already have your cup of coffee, so that's only fair. That's just water.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:22):\n\nOh, sure. So yeah, in the chat earlier somebody had mentioned, and this is true. Tesla is not the only one that had an issue with video playing on the center screen in some of their cars while the vehicle was in motion. Mercedes-Benz on the new EQs, their new electric vehicle, their electric luxury sedan actually did a announced a recall earlier this week because was a, a software bug in some of them that did allow video to play on the large central screen in the, in the vehicle. And that's not supposed to be the case. So they, they issued a recall to update the software in those vehicles so that that could not happen. There are, I mean, there are some solutions to, you know, to this idea of what Tesla talked about, which is, you know, allowing passengers to play games or, you know, to do other stuff.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:50:22):\n\nAnd that's to have a separate screen in front of the passenger that is polarized. You know, somebody talked mentioned you know, range rovers had that on, they've had a system on some of their vehicles where the driver and the passenger would see different things on the central touch screen. Earlier this year Jeep launched the new new generation of the grand Cherokee as well as the wagon year. And one of the options you can get in, there is a passenger side screen that's directly in front of the passenger and it's got one of these privacy filters on there. A lot of laptops have these as well that when you get off access basically you can't, you can't see the screen anymore. And so that's what what Jeep has done and, and some other manufacturers are doing at Mercedes also has that on, on the EQs they have a passenger side screen that has that sort of privacy filter on there.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:51:17):\n\nThat would be a better solution. You know, the, the other thing that you could also potentially do, which I talked about with Micah on tech news weekly the other day was you know, using a driver monitor system to, you know, make sure that the driver is not looking down at the screen, you know, to, to look, you know, to monitor what the driver is doing and make sure that they are paying attention to the road, which is what they should be doing that you know, that's a solution that, that could work. It's better to just not have that ability at all in the central screen, you know, have it, have it off for screens for the passengers, but not allow it at all for the central screen because, you know, if it's there you know, it can distract the driver let's see, user 39 90 in regards to the batteries for electric cars, it would be think to know how many times they, you can charge, recharge, discharge the batteries.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:52:12):\n\nIt would also be interesting to know what four GM Tesla do with the batteries once they reach end of life. I hear very little about that. So with current generation EV batteries there, there's different battery chemistries, you know, there's different vari different flavors of lithium ion batteries. The most ones used in EVs most EVs today, especially longer range EVs are nickel, nickel based chemistries. So it's usually a combination of nickel, manganese, cobalt, aluminum you know, or maybe just nickel, cobalt and aluminum. And these have pretty good energy density. The, but they're good for about maybe about 800 charge cycles and just as with your cell phone or, you know, any other battery you know, that would be a full charge, full charge and discharge from zero to a hundred percent in back. So if you do a partial discharge, if you go from 75 down to 50% and charge it back up to 75%, you know, that would only be a quarter of a charge cycle.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:53:15):\n\nSo generally, you know, the batteries should be good for a, at least eight to 10 years before the, the the capacity degrades to the point where it's not, it starts to become less useful for a vehicle. There's also other chemistries like lithium iron phosphate, which is more stable and has much higher cycle life can easily go well over 2000 charge cycles. And when we've heard Elon Musk talk about the in mile battery for vehicles, that's what he's actually talking about is, is iron phosphate batteries, lithium iron phosphate chemistries. The problem with iron phosphate, they're cheaper. They save about 30 to 40% relative to a nickel chemistry. But they also have about 30 to 40% less energy density. So you don't get as much range. So you're not gonna get 300 5400 aisle ranges with iron batteries like you will with nickel chemistries.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:54:10):\n\nAs far as end of life goes or even after they reach the end of their life in the car, you know, once the ch typically once the initial capacity drops to about seven or once the capacity drops to about 70% of its initial capacity. So, you know, let's say you know, if you had a 300 mile range initially, and it drops to about 200 to 210 miles or less, that's where it's generally considered, you know, mostly end of life, you know, for, for use in the vehicle, but it can still have a long lifespan in second life applications. And this is where the, they take the battery out of the vehicle and use it for stationary storage, for example. And this is something we're seeing a lot more of for DC fast charging stations, as an example because of the way electricity is charged for commercial customers, which is different from residential customers.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:55:05):\n\nThey they have what they call demand charges. And so if you go over a certain power demand, you know, at any given time, so say you're rated for a hundred kilowats and you, your power demand spikes up to 150 kilowats the utility will charge that commercial customer, a hefty premium what they call demand charges, because they have to build in capacity, extra capacity for that, those peaks that which don't get used very often. And so what they're increasingly doing for fast charging stations, EV fast charging stations is putting in batteries that they can charge asynchronously from charging the cars. And then when they have those peaks of demand, when the car is plugged in and, and needs that really high power, they can take it from the battery instead of from the grid. So that helps balance the grid.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:55:58):\n\nIt helps reduce the costs for the station charging station operator so that, and, you know, there's a lot of other use cases for stationary storage, you know, for backing up. So solar facilities, you know, to take store energy during the day when the solar panels are generating power and then Le leaving letting it back out during the night, or, you know, same thing for wind and other renewables. And then finally there's recycling. Every automaker is involved heavily in developing battery recycling, working with a lot of partners Redwood materials as a chem, as a company started by former Tesla CTO, JB stra they're working with Ford and, and others on battery recycling. And so they're, they're recycling processes that can recover about 95% of the key raw materials. The things I mentioned before, like Nick nickel, manganese cobalt, aluminum from batteries that are end of life that no longer have enough capacity to be useful, but now you can take those and, and recycle them, get those key materials out of them and put that into new battery again. So now you don't have to mine ver you don't have to mine as much of the Virgin material and process that you can reuse that. Now we haven't been able to do much of either second life or recycling up until now, because there simply haven't been enough batteries in the field to do that. But as we get more and more EVs in the road that reach the end of their life, now you'll have enough skin else to make those\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:24):\n\nPractices. It's such good news that the Maki is such a success. How wonderful that is. I'm very happy.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:57:30):\n\nThe pumping capacity from 60,000 a year up to 200,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:34):\n\n200 a year. Yeah, I'm I'm right. I'm driving Lisa's Cooper today mini today because she wanted to drive my Mustang in the rain and I don't blame her. Thank you, Sam. Well, Hey, Hey. Hey, how are you today? Leo LePort here, the tech guy, time to talk computers, the internet, home theater, digital photography, smart phones, smart watches, all that jazz. You know, all the stuff we live with every day. It's kind of funny because here it is the most complicated device in whole life used to be probably your, your car was the most complicated thing in your life. Now, I would say, you know, the kind of the computing devices, and actually guess you have to include your car now because a car is a computer plus the car <laugh>, these are really kind of the peak of technological innovation. It's amazing what these these little boxes we have on our desks and these little slabs we have in our pockets can do.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:34):\n\nSo that's what we talk about in this show. Eighty eight, eighty eight ask Leo's the phone number? It's nice. You know, I've been covering, I've been doing this since the, as I was talking about last hour, the early I nineties. So it'll be 30 years is that right? Yeah. 30 years been talking about computers and and, and now of course computers means more than it did then. It's nice. I could still be in awe of, of what we've accomplished. And I guess that's because we keep in vague in so many interesting ways. 88, 88, ask Leo, let, let's talk about tech. Don's next? Southgate, California. Hi, Don. Hello, DOD. Don come to the phone, you know, it's very quiet. Don is very quiet. So I'm gonna try, let me put Don on hold and go to Corll in Los Angeles. Hi, Corll hi. There we go. Hi, Corll. Hi, what's\n\nSpeaker 6 (00:59:38):\n\nUp? Okay. I install Arlo camera, security, cameras, battery, and wireless. Okay. And have a house, large property. So to, towards the rear of the lot, they popped in a TP link access point. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Then next to their that's where the garage is. So the,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:08):\n\nSo the thinking is it's so far away from your house that WiFi's not gonna reach out there. So they're extending it using the TP, like, is that plugged into power?\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:00:18):\n\nIt's Poe power.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:20):\n\nYes. Okay. So it's well Poe, but the, the, the TP link. So TP link makes a variety of devices it's powered. But my question is, where is it? Its internet come from? Does it come from wifi or does it come from, is it an extender? Is that what they put\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:00:35):\n\nIn? It's an extender. Cause they all, they also have a TP call it an but the power antenna that goes,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:46):\n\nSo this is a little confusing. So it's connected to your ethernet though, right? Yeah. But the ethernet is only connected to power, not to your internet.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:00:56):\n\nThat's connected to the internet.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:59):\n\nOh, it is. So it's a powered. So it's connected to powered internet router with Poe on it.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:01:06):\n\nRight. But that's in the main house. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:09):\n\nFine. And so you've got a, you've got a big, long ethernet wire going out to that TP link.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:01:16):\n\nYeah. Okay. Now they, they next to the, this office, which is part of the garage. They have a Kaban and if you sit at the Kaban with the computer, you could see an exterior antenna that has a cat five cable going okay. Underground all the way to the house. Yeah. So when I'm trying to hook up the Arlo cameras, the the cameras won't hook up to the system.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:52):\n\nAh, all right. So just to make sure I've, I've got this\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:01:58):\n\nYeah. It gets a little confusing. Yeah. No, I think I have\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:00):\n\nIt though. You have a Poe TP link extend, which is closer to the Arlo and it has wifi. It's a wifi antenna, but it's getting its internet through your ethernet. That's how it's getting power and internet. Yeah. And so the Arlo should be able to see it. How far away from the Arlo is it?\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:02:19):\n\nThe, well, this is inside\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:22):\n\nThat it's like within a hundred feet. Okay. Well, it's a little distant. It be, it may be, it's possible. There's two possibilities. The Arlo, because you know, these are inexpensive devices may not have the best wifi radios. It may just be beyond the Arlo's capability to pick up a signal. That's one possibility. The other possibility is very common with internet of things, devices like the Arlo. They often don't work on five gigahertz. They only work on 2.4 gigahertz. Right. And I'm gonna bet that whoever set this up, you have one name for your wifi network, right? You don't have one that says two point 4g and two and 5g. You have just one name. No. Right. So what that means is there are devices, there are radios on both frequencies with the same name and the Arlo may be saying, ah, I'm gonna join this. And if it says I can it's 5g. So that's the other possibility. And this is not unusual.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:03:23):\n\nIt is 5g.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:25):\n\nThe, the Arlo is not, no,\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:03:27):\n\nThe Arlo is not. The\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:29):\n\nArlo Arlo wants 2.4. So what I do in, in a similar situation, I have ubiquity Poe wifi access points in my garage. I, I, I tell that only send out 2.4 gigahertz. It's just gonna confuse the cameras when there's five gigahertz. So if your, if your TP, is it the TP link used for anything else? Is it also used for the pool area?\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:03:55):\n\nThe no. That's only used for the office.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:59):\n\nThey have. So the TP link is intended for the RLO and nothing else. Pardon me? The TP link is intended for the RLO and nothing else.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:04:07):\n\nNo, no, no. For the computer, that's an office too. Like, like a, a separate office. So it's used for the person that's in the office or computer system.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:18):\n\nSo one thing then one, what you could probably do. In fact, I would suggest doing this is check in the TP link settings. You probably can turn off the 5g radio, turn that off temporarily and pair the Arlo to it. The other, the other problem with 5g, even if the Arlo can do 5g, it doesn't travel as well. And since a hundred feet is right at the edge. It, even if it could see 5g couldn't could use 5g. Couldn't see it. So turn off 5g on the on the TP link. So it's only right now, temporarily 2.4, then try to get the Arlo onto it at that point, if the Arlo joins it and it's working, you can turn the 5g back on the Arlo. Won't switch frequencies.\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:05:01):\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:02):\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSpeaker 6 (01:05:03):\n\nYeah. It gets super, super complicated.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:07):\n\nYeah, I understand. But I, but I kind of get what you're doing. It's actually smart way to do it. The only there there's two, again, there's two reasons. The RLO may not be able to see the wifi one is its distance. The other is its bandwidth. It's it's frequency. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> so check the frequency first. That's an easy thing to set. TP link will have a setting in there to turn off the five gigahertz radio. It should all work. If it doesn't. Now it may be just that it's distant. You could try moving the repositioning, the TP link, moving it higher, moving it close to a window. Different things, because radio is weird. You're a hundred feet. Yeah. Nominally 2.4 gigahertz. Wifi should go 150 feet, but that's nominal, you know, there's issues. There's stuff in the way. Maybe the, the walls can be a problem.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:50):\n\nSo you can just, you don't have to extend something farther out. You might just be able to reposition the TP link and get the working. But first I'd try the, the frequencies. Okay. Nice to talk to you, corre. That's a nice setup. You got there. Is this your place? No. it's a client's house. Sounds like a movie star in Brentwood or something are talking about here. No, no names. ADE Pasadena. Well, Anna, right? Yeah. One of the older homes, but it, it, it's a nice home. Sounds very nice. Yeah. Give, give that a try. Yeah. And of course those movie stars, they're tough clients, you know, <laugh>, they just, it's not working. <Laugh> eighty eight eighty eight to ask Leo the phone number, but I'm glad to help. I'm glad to help. Radio is weird. RF guy in our chat room says radio's weird.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:44):\n\nYes. RF guy, you know that radio frequency, he's obviously an engineer. Radio frequency is voodoo. And you know, sometimes you know that if you're old enough to remember rabbit ear antennas, you know, you remember standing on one leg holding the rabbit ear sideways so that the TV reception's. Okay. You remember doing that? Moving around, putting tin foil on the rabbit ears, kids are going, what is he, what Rabbiters are you talking about? Well, kids <laugh> no. Okay. In the old days, you're you used to have these in antennas on your TV that they call 'em Rabbiters cuz they had two rods sticking out, looked like a little, you know, Oswald mouse, Oswald, and they would be long and then you'd move 'em around until you got the right, you know, reception. And if the, I love Lucy was coming in funny, you'd move it around.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:38):\n\nSometimes you'd stay in on one leg. You move very famous story of Steve WAAC the founder of apple computer and a kind of prankster in his own, right in college, you know, back in the day, that's exactly how the college TV and the basement worked. They had rabbit ears and he had a little DT tuner. He had built to keep his, his pocket with a little knob that would, would change the frequency, we'd mess with it. And so he would get one of his frat brothers to go over there and get the antenna and he'd wait till the frat brother was in the most awkward position possible and then tune it in. So it's perfect picture <laugh> if the frat brother put his foot down, tune it out again. <Laugh> so his poor frat brothers were standing in contorted positions holding the, an antenna just so they could watch raw hide.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:27):\n\nAnd, and they're in Lizza tail eighty eight, eighty eight. Ask Leo the phone number. That's that's how you old man, we could talk high tech, Leo Laport, the tech, have you watched the the what is it? Eight hours of the Beatles get back on Disney plus it's fun. One of the things I love about it and of course I'm a Beatles fan. Peter Jackson, the, the the director guy who did the Hobbit and Lord of the rings took I think it was 60 hours of film that was shot hundreds of hours of audio that was recorded of the Beatles planning, you know, to make their album, let it be and, and, and record their concert and make a documentary. And this has never, before been seen, he edited it all together. Upscaled it be beautifully, really looks amazing in 4k. Like you're there, but one of the things that's really cool is watching them from beginning to end write this song.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:27):\n\nIt's fascinating. You know, you hear the first chords you go. I <laugh>, I think I know what they're writing. Same thing with, let it be, I think I know what Paul's coming up with here. Very cool. Very cool. 88. It's amazing. You know, I'm thinking what it made me think of is of course they were the Beatles. This is 1969. And because they were the Beatles, every move was recorded and photographed, but nowadays that's true for everybody. 50, 50 years later, every you go, everything you do, every little breath you take is is recorded somewhere and being safe for posterity. You could in theory, do the same kind of documentary for anybody in 50 years. Oh yeah, we got all his Instagram reels and tweets. We could put together a heck of a heck of a document. Pretty wild, pretty wild, eighty eight, eighty eight. Ask Leo the phone number back to the phones. We go coming up, Chris Markot photo guy, by the way in just 10 minutes, Don. Let's see if we can get him on the air from south. Get, I think you were muted. Don, are you unmuted?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:10:33):\n\nYeah. I'm I'm Hey, you hear me? Yeah. Oh, perfect. Yay. You know, I get these, these photographs on my screen saver that I don't know where they came from. And at times some, some look like advertisements.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:50):\n\nOh, that's not good. Now let me ask a question. First of all, windows are Mac windows, windows, and the screensaver using came from where?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:11:00):\n\nFrom my personal photos.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:03):\n\nBut it's a, it's the, it's the screen saver that came with windows. It's windows 10.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:11:08):\n\nYes. Yes. It\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:09):\n\nCame with windows. It's not a third party screen saver.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:11:12):\n\nNo, no, it's not.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:13):\n\nOkay. I am not I have never used the screen saver on windows, so I'm not sure, but I'm I'm thinking that when you open it up, you get to choose where those photos come from. Yes, yes. And are, and you're choosing a folder.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:11:33):\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:35):\n\nOkay. So the folder is your picture folder, right? Right. Yeah. So how would anybody else's pictures get in there?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:11:45):\n\nThat's what I wanted. <Laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:47):\n\nHave you looked in the folder to see if they're in the folder? Yes. And are they no. No. Well now you got me mic, although you never know with Microsoft, it could be, they are in fact, including <laugh>, including what kind of pictures are you getting?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:12:09):\n\nI'm getting pictures of other people. Some like it looked like an advertisement for it. Cookie or something or <laugh> Andy.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:18):\n\nOh man. All right. First of all I wanna make sure you're using the one that came with windows. You're not, you didn't download and install somebody else's screensaver. No,\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:12:29):\n\nFor sure. So I'm using for sure. I'm using windows 11 too.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:33):\n\nOh, well, okay. <Laugh> boy, I wish I had a windows 11 machine machine in front of me. That's my, my bad. I am thinking it's, you know, I use as an example, I use for my wallpaper, the Bing wallpaper, which gives me a new wonderful Bing photo every day, but that doesn't have any ads for keys in that <laugh> so I don't think, I don't think that's where that's coming from. It should only be, I think that means probably that you've got some ad wear on your system. That's smart enough to say let's put it in the screensaver, which is actually, I gotta give 'em credit. That's that's pretty clever. <Laugh> you shouldn't be you getting anything that's. Other than those, the photos that you took in that folder, as long as you're using the official windows 11 screen saver, and it's pointed to that folder and in, when you look in the folder, there's no ads for cookies in that folder. So that means something else is running on your system. And actually is now a little bit more cost for concern. I don't know enough about how Microsoft does that screensaver if it's using and it may well be, if it's using the edge browsers libraries to render it, it could be your browsers been hijacked. So I would look first in your browser. Do you use edge as your default browser?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:13:58):\n\nNo. I use Google.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:59):\n\nGoogle, Google Chrome. Well, look both in edge, open edge. It's there. Even if you don't use it and Google Chrome, ignore all the requests from edge to please make me your browser. They hate, they hate it when you use Chrome. And I would check and see that you don't have any extensions installed in either browser that look strange to you. That's not something you specifically want. That's the number one way that that could happen. The number two way is just simply with something that was installed. And it's not unusual. If you go to a free software site, they'll put up these check boxes and say, you want this and this and this and you just go, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So look in a remove programs and make sure that you don't have something else installed too. Leo Laport, the tech guy. Yeah. I it's almost certain. You've got some other thing running. The only question is where it's kind. Ah, yeah. So is\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:14:55):\n\nThere another, is there another\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:58):\n\nScreensaver I could do? Oh gosh. Yeah. There's a whole lot of them. But I want, and, and I'm certainly gonna encourage you to try another one, but I first fix this problem because it could be a sign of a larger problem. Okay. so you definitely wanna figure out, go to ad remove programs and just check that you don't have anything that, you know, that says like super duper ad software <laugh> in there. <Laugh> and, and then if it's not there, you might wanna check in your browsers just to make sure there's no browser extension. The only reason I mentioned that is I know it's not a browser, but sometimes windows, you will use the edge rendering machine to render images. And I'm not sure it's not not doing that as for windows 10 third party screensavers. There's a, a million of them. There's even a open source. One that every, that everybody seems to really like a lot. It just depends what you want. My favorite is called electric sheep. Depends. What do you like in a screen saver?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:16:02):\n\nI like to have my pictures displayed.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:04):\n\nOh yeah. You want sorry. Nevermind. Cuz electric sheep. Doesn't do that. It's more like psychedelia. I love it though. Let me see for a windows photo <affirmative> yeah, your pictures. Yeah. You know what? You should fix this, this that's all you should need. It's already built into windows. We gotta fix this anyway. Cuz we wanna make sure we get rid of whatever that is cuz who knows what else it's doing. Yeah. Right, right. So don't download an anti SP tool. I, I think you can just do this yourself. Just it'll it'll either it'll it'll it won't be malware. It will be adware installed either as a standalone program or as an extension. And it might even be look at the screensaver settings and make sure it could, it's PO completely possible by the way, for a program to install new screens savers on your system and make it the default.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:59):\n\nWow. And it's possible that instead of using the windows you know, provided your photos screensaver, you're using the Mrs. Fields, cookie screensaver. <Laugh> that is, that is leaving your photos with cookie advertisements. So look, that's another place to look is in the screensaver settings and make sure you're using the official windows one, not some other one that may also have been installed by due to ever download free or shareware programs from places like softed or download com. Yes. Yeah. So you gotta really be careful cuz you'll see that downloads.com for instance will encourage you to download their downloader. They'll pop up a lot of windows that says, oh, would you like this tool and that tool and that, and you have to really carefully say, no, these are dark patterns. They kind of, you know, think you're just gonna say, okay. Okay. Okay. And then they'll install stuff and they may have installed the Mrs.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:52):\n\nFields' cookie screen saver. I don't think it's mad where it's malware. It's just adware. Okay. So check those three places. Browser extensions should always check those anyway. Ad remove programs. And now come to think of it. Check the screensaver control panel. Make sure you're actually using the official windows. Screensaver, not something else. Got it. Okay. One of those will surely fix the problem. I'm convinced. I know it will. Our tech eye show brought to you this week by user way, big fan, as you know of user way, because well, I've been really sensitized to this issue of accessibility doing the radio show for you years. A lot of we have a lot of blind listeners. They love radio cuz it's accessible, right? But then they go on the internet, they visit maybe your website and suddenly they can't see it. They can't there's empty places where pictures are they?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:46):\n\nThe nav menus are in unintelligible. The and, and the thing maybe if you want to, they wanna buy something. The shopping cart, the forms, they can't use those. That's why user way is so important. User way wants to make every website in the world without exception accessible. In fact, that's the law Domino's pizza found that out when they said, oh, we don't have to make our website accessible. We got a phone number. Just call the number. We'll get you a pizza. Fought that one all the way to the Supreme court, the Supreme court. What do they rule? They said, no, that's called separate but equal. That's not okay. As a public entity, you have to be accessible. That's the Americans with disabilities act, the ADA Domino's set up, took notice remediated their site. Now everybody in the world, certainly in the us is making sure their sites are accessible.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:37):\n\nIt's a federal law. It's a little challenging. If you own a website, you might go, ah, gosh, how much that's gonna cost? Well, let me tell you about user way. They have an incredible AI powered solution that tirelessly enforces the hundreds of web content, accessibility guidelines with one line of JavaScript. That's all you put one line in. Of course it pulls in other JavaScript, but that one line in your site fixes your whole website. It can achieve more than an entire team of developers and it does it all automatically using AI machine learning user way is used by over a million websites, including some of the biggest websites in the world. Coca-Cola Disney, eBay, FedEx, Walmart, all use user way to make their sites accessible to the 60 million Americans with disabilities. It's not just the right thing to do. It's the law now user way is making those best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to small and medium sized businesses.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:35):\n\nAnd of course the beauty is when you scale, as you get bigger, don't worry user way can scale with you. If they can do it for Disney, they can do it for you and accessible and compliant website. Not to just the right thing to do. It also makes business sense. Cuz those people wanna be your customers. You know, you're turning away customers user way automatically generates image. Alt tags writes the image descriptions for you using their computer vision.

Chris Martz. Here he is my photo sensei@senseidotphotosensei.photo. He's also a very accomplished photographer. And as it turns out, our particular coach on this show. Hello Chris?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:23:16):\n\nHi Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:17):\n\nYou are, you are an always an inspiration to get me out there taking pictures. I, I owe my expensive habit. It all to you.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:23:26):\n\n<Laugh> it's all my fault. Well do you go out at days like this? You, you told me earlier, it's kind of radio\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:34):\n\nBit of a\n\nChris Marquardt (01:23:34):\n\nGray rainy, not so nice thing. We have the exact same thing today here. So yeah, gray days. It's, it's one of those, it's one of those situations where you don't feel like going out and shooting, but interestingly enough, that's where it kind of begins becoming interesting. So this,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:54):\n\nI might just stay inside, take picture my Lego figures if that's okay.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:23:59):\n\nWell, it it's nothing wrong with that, but this, this, the inspiration for, for what I wanna talk about today comes from real life events, cuz we've been out for a walk today and it has been one of these days where you go don't you\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:13):\n\nWorry about your your phone or it is not pouring it's it's just gray.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:24:17):\n\nIt wasn't pouring it. Wasn't pour. It was just gray and a bit Misty and cold and wintery and well Northern hemisphere weather in December. Yeah. So and I, and I did take my phone to take pictures. I wasn't brave enough to bring, well, the camera didn't wouldn't really have suffered, but I was, it was like, yeah, it doesn't feel like it. And then I saw interesting things and and it gave me the idea to talk about shooting at gray A's with whatever camera you have and the, a few things that you want to maybe look out for a few ideas how to pick that into something interesting. And, and the, the first thing that comes to mind is a, a gray day like this, you have a severe lack of contrast. Everything is gonna gray. Everything is dull. This sky is boring, but that whole thing can actually be great because it places a bit of a limitation on you and makes you, makes you think a bit harder, makes you try a bit harder to do things.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:25:18):\n\nSo Misty foggy days there was a bit of that today. And a few of the examples I have are just like wonderful look for the light. That's always good. The, the mist will simplify things, visually simplify things. It'll take out the background view of interesting life coming in, maybe through a few branches the forest, I, I was, we, we did the walk today in the forest, so that's why I was reminded of that. Just, just, just be aware that the, the Misty weather will take away some part of the background, so it will simplify the scene. And that's what we photographers usually strive for. We wanna simplify things. We wanna take clutter out of a picture. So in that case nature does it for us. Ooh, these are so pretty.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:07):\n\nIt also people who are not seeing the video, of course, it's a radio show will put a link to all of these@techguylabs.com. Cause some of these are just, it just shows you, you can get great photos on a gray day.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:26:19):\n\nExactly. Here, here, we're looking at a, at a, at a scene with trees and, and a foggy background and a person standing there. It's a, it's a bit of a silhouette situation. It add a\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:31):\n\nMystery to it. It makes it, it makes it kind of, if there's more of a story here,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:26:37):\n\nIt, it, it is. And it simplifies the whole scene. That's I think the, the main point for me and as soon as you start hiding things as with things in the dark or in the MIS you add mystery and that, as you said, is it, it adds a story and that makes makes it important or, or it makes it forces people to come up with a story in their mind. Another thing you can do with these kind of scenes, you know, they, they tend to go a bit monochro, there might be a colorful, but you end up with, well, it's not colorful. It's great. That's why we call it a gray day is playing with colors. So play with white balance, add a bit of blue tint to the photo by going towards that cool side of the, of the white balance or, or give it a greenish tint or something that it, that that's a, that's a great opportunity to play because you have a simplified color palette as well.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:27:32):\n\nAnd, and adding some color there just by playing with these sliders in post processing or in your, in your photos app it's fun. It's fun to play. It's, it's a lot of fun to play. The other thing is it's winter. So there might be snow, which again, which simplifies the landscape even more, cuz it covers up all the detail on the ground with a white sheet. The, a great thing that you can do then is just find a strong subject, a, a big tree, for example, like in this picture that will we'll stand doubt because there's nothing really distracting from it, cuz the rest is just simplified again. Here's, here's an example. I love this. Someone just, just went to a forest shot upwards through the trees and there's birds in that hole in the sky. So even, even though the sky is not that interesting on a great day like this there is an interesting subject and adding color again, this is, this photo here has a, has a warmish touch, which is kind of counterintuitive. Cuz you would think it's cold, it's gray. You might want this a bit more bluish, but this gives it an interesting twist. I think I like this a lot. It's really neat. You know, this\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:49):\n\nIs, this is inspiring because people sometimes look out the window go, well, there's no nothing to no photos to be taken today and it's quite the option. Yeah.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:59):\n\nRight. And, and again, and, and it's, it's not even, it's not even a bad thing. If you have a lot of space left over in the photo, look at this, you can\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:06):\n\nHardly see anything\n\nChris Marquardt (01:29:07):\n\n<Laugh> you, you see a building with a reflections, so there must be some water there, but then half of the pictures empty, just imagine making that into a greeting card and using that space on left to just put some copy on some greetings or something. I mean, that's, that's just it, this is an idea that that gets interesting. And if you have a, a really boring sky, leave it out, leave it out. Don't even show it just point the camera downwards at some details. And that's the next thing on a gray day, you might wanna look at a things in, in, in, in, on a more detailed level. Here's a, here's one of those beautiful shots where I think someone shot this through a windshield. So you have all these water drops on a windshield. Early in the morning, the car is covered in these drops and the camera focuses on the drops, but then there's something like a tree behind it, which change is the whole dynamics in this picture.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:04):\n\nTurns into a bit of a mosaic kind of thing which is beautiful. Oracle will going really close. That might be a great day, but it there's, there's spiderwebs out there. If you're up early, if you're an early bird, that's a great opportunity to find to find spider or branches with drops of water morning due, hanging off of them. So those details are plenty of fun. And then last but not least, of course, why not go abstract a great day will allow you to work with like just, just moving the camera with a, with a longer shutter speed, getting some outer focus, getting some camera shaking there deliberately and just see what comes out. So that's just a few of the examples of the things that you can do with gray days and, and become oh really, really interesting. I really, really\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:59):\n\nLike 'em so here's the thing you, you know, you're listening on the Ray radio. I suggest you go to tech guy labs.com. No charge, no sign up. We'll put a link there to all the pictures he's talking about now re-listen <laugh> to Chris's segment looking at them cuz there's so they're so beautiful and there's a lot of inspiration there. Maybe inspiration enough to get out and participate in our photo assignment, right?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:31:22):\n\nThe Laz sign,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:24):\n\nDon't be lazy. Take a picture that illustrates the word or concept lazy. This is actually if it's a gloomy day where you are a perfect day to do that at least the kind of lazy I am go go take that image if you like it upload it to our flicker group. Flicker.Com is a photo sharing site. Our group is called the tech eye group group. You can do one picture a week in a couple of weeks. Chris will will pick three to talk about. It's just an excuse to get out and take some pictures. Thank you, Chris sense. Thank you. Dot photo is his website S a N S E i.photo. And of course his podcast tips from the top floor@tfttf.com. Leo Laport, the tech guy. Perfect timing. Perfect timing. Oh, are you here next week?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:15):\n\nMom?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:32:16):\n\nLemme check. Cuz it's getting, it's getting the 19th gonna get looked lot like Christmas cuz I won't be here. Okay. You can take the 26th off obviously boxing day who works on boxing day. I know what does and then we will, I will be here on January 2nd.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:35):\n\nI should be here too. Yeah, I all. I'll be here on a second.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:32:40):\n\nWe'll see you on the that's not a problem week and then a second.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:45):\n\nExactly. Perfect. And next week, by the way is the day after the James web telescope launch. Oh I have that\n\nLeo Laporte (01:32:51):\n\nCalendar. That'll be fun. I'm sure. Rod pile will be talking about that next hour and our space segment. Very.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:00):\n\nOh cool. I'll stay on and listen to <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:03):\n\nOkay. Thanks Chris. All right, bye. Bye. See you take care. Do do Bobby do do Leo. Leport the tech guy, eighty eight eighty eight. Ask Leo the phone number Ryan on the line from Pittsburgh, PA. Hello Ryan.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:33:20):\n\nHi Leo. How\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:21):\n\nAre you? I am great. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:33:24):\n\nGood. I haven't talked to you since pre COVID, so it's good to talk to you.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:27):\n\n<Laugh> it. There really is now that a demarcation pre COVID and post COVID in the world. It's like absolutely. Yeah. I mean that, that really is a dividing line and we aren't quite post COVID. I I might add, but that the world before March, 2020 was very different. What can we, what can we do for you?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:33:47):\n\nUnderstood. I have a couple of questions for you. Most of 'em have to do with cell phones. Probably one of the big, the two big questions that I have is number one is my one of my sons is a a dual language major. Oh, nice. Close\n\nLeo Laporte (01:34:00):\n\nTo your what\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:34:01):\n\nLanguages and Spanish and French. Nice. So he will be going to Spain, hopefully knocking on everything. Oh he's he's tried to go twice with school. They both got canceled. He should be going July-ish but my is on cricket. I actually am a MIT mobile customer. Thanks to you. Good. and I, how do you like it? But I love it. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:34:29):\n\nLove it. It's good price, right? Yeah. Thousand\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:34:31):\n\nTimes better than I thought. Yeah. So yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:34:34):\n\nI think I not, not ideal for international travel cuz one of the things mint mobile, which is an M V N O of T-Mobile T-Mobile is good for travel. In fact, I have a T-Mobile phone specifically for that purpose because they give you bandwidth everywhere you go. Right. My favorite travel carrier\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:34:53):\n\nIs this is basically my question.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:34:55):\n\nYeah. Is Google fi it works best on a phone from Google or one of the, there are a number you can Samsung and Motorola also Makey compatible phones fi is quite clever. It uses well, it used to use sprint and T-Mobile and obviously now that's just T-Mobile and it also uses us cellular and wifi. And so the phone has to be especially built so that it can switch seamlessly, switch from one to the other, but in the us that has the advantage of giving you more towers, which is great. Right. But fi also is good because it's essentially the same price in Europe as it is here, which is a fairly, I think, a fairly reasonable price. The way FYS pricing works is 20 bucks a month for voice and text unlimited. Both now you will pay for international calls, but it's not expensive.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:35:46):\n\nYou can look up the price of Spain to the us for instance, and then the $10 per gigabyte, up to six gigabytes. And then it stops. But that's the same internationally. So what, when I travel, I take my pixel six with Google. Fine. I don't even think about where I am. There are a few countries when we were in Monaco a few years ago, it didn't work at the time, but we were so close to France and Italy. That didn't really matter. Eventually now I think MoCo is covered. So they have to make deals with all the carries in those areas. But that's a, I think for, if you want a phone that works in the us and will work the same overseas, Googley is a great way to go. And the pixel six is a great phone for that.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:36:26):\n\nYeah. I mean, I have to tell you, he is not overly tech savvy. He's had an iPhone for forever. Oh, he wants an iPhone.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:36:34):\n\nIt will work with the iPhone, by the way, it will work with the iPhone. Okay. Not his\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:36:39):\n\nFour line. Yeah. We have a four line deal with cricket, unlimited a hundred bucks for four phones, as long as you own them. I'm thrilled with that. And he's only gonna be there for three weeks. So I was curious if there was more of like a buy a SIM\n\nLeo Laporte (01:36:50):\n\nCard or yeah. Yeah. And I can give you the, I can give you the other, the old way we used to do it. This has changed my life though, to have Google five, cuz I try as you, I used to, again, BC, I used to travel a lot. And so I didn't have to ever even think about it. I just take my phone and I'm good cricket. I don't know. But I suspect they're an MB of at and T I would guess it's similar even though they're owned and operated by at and T it's similar to mint in the sense that going international, you don't get the same deal as at and T customers get. So you might check to see what cricket offers, but generally, okay. Generally the us carriers are not the most economical way to, if he's gonna be in Spain for a long time.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:37:31):\n\nHow long is he gonna be there three weeks? Oh, it's a short trip. Welly would work. You could get a SIM. Let me direct you to a week. That is really the, the best place to go for this, which is called prepaid with data. If you Google that, you'll get to the very long URL, which is prepaid data, SIM card.fandom.com. But it's the prepaid, <laugh> just, just Google prepaid with data. I got you, right? It gives you every country in the world and it tells you who the carriers are, what their costs are in most countries. You like Spain, you arrive at the airport. There is a little kiosk there. Sometimes it's the post office. It just varies in the country's. And this'll give you that information where you just say, good, I want a Spanish SIM. Now the negative is that he's gonna have a Spanish phone number.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:38:21):\n\nAnd for a short trip, that's a little in inconvenient because you know, you still wanna be in touch. But the, the nice thing now, the other thing that's changed over the years is the EU has new roaming rules. That mean every has to provide the same price in every other EU country. So you could really use any EU SIM, but if you wanted to use and so that's good news. If he's going to Spain and France, for instance, then he doesn't really, he doesn't have to worry. You could use orangs, which is the French carrier or movie star, which is the Spanish carrier. Wouldn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:38:53):\n\nI, I traveled from work often. I'm I'm with Verizon. So I'm in whenever I'm in Vienna or Slovakia Alava wherever they just flip a switch and it's an extra 10, 15 bucks a month and I'm covered. Yeah. That's not bad when it comes to my, yeah. And when it comes to my family, I just don't know what to do. So that was very helpful. I, I got one more question for you and it's based on Android and the only Androids I've ever used is pixel, which I love. Yep. But my other son uses he's very much in pain. He's kinda like your daughter, he breaks phones a lot. <Laugh> and he's in love with the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:39:25):\n\nHow do you know that about my daughter? Oh, I've mentioned it, but a hundred times, you all the time. My poor daughter <laugh>\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:39:32):\n\nSo he, he is in love with the Samsung gal, see eight active, but it's starting to get a little long in the tooth. And if you go out there and just Google, like rugged Samsung or rugged Android phones, you'll get about a billion different ones. Yeah. And I don't even know where to begin.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:39:50):\n\nYou know, it's funny somebody called yesterday and asked about a phone I'd never heard of it from a Dutch company called Ze <affirmative> and they make a three or $400 super rugged phone. The Zeer P 10, that is drop proof. It's IP 68. It's like crazy probably not a great phone, but a great phone to drop.\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:40:13):\n\nSure.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:40:14):\n\nAnd a, and a fairly reasonable price. Amazon's I think overcharging for it. I think it's 430 bucks, but if you shop around, I think you can get it down under four, under 300. And I, so he,\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:40:26):\n\nI was gonna say he drives for DoorDash for his go job. He's one of those gig economy kids. And, you know, he keeps telling me, I gotta, you know, reboot my phone after every third call or a very, oh gosh, fourth dash, I'm thinking, oh gosh, breathing, your phone's getting long in the tooth. We, we can do better.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:40:42):\n\nThe other thing is maybe just get a Samsung galaxy, you know, you get 'em at 10 20, 21 one of the more recent galaxies and just get a really good Otter box case. And I honestly think the Otter box cases are as good as any ruggedized phone. Has he looked at Otter box?\n\nSpeaker 7 (01:40:59):\n\nI I'll say this much. I hear what you're saying. I will tell you he's on the spectrum. And he thinks what he thinks. And he likes what he likes. Just\n\nLeo Laporte (01:41:06):\n\nLike my daughter. He doesn't have to have a case. He doesn't wanna case at all. Okay. Does zer is basically a phone with a case built in, I mean, it's it, that's what it is essentially. Exactly what I want. Yeah. Zeer Z E E K E R. I don't know anything about it. It was the first I'd ever heard of it yesterday. The reviews are fairly good. And it's the, and it's designed to be rugged. There's a tech radar review. You could read that says it's not bad. You"
