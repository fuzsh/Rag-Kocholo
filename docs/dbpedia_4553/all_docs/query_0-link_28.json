        "text": "I like this show, but it more often than not descends into moaning about what went wrong on the internet and the latest assault on privacy, and only rarely about interesting/new gadgets.\n\nI like tech-policy chats, but usually the guests Leo has donât have any expertise, so it ends up being about as informative as an AM radio call-in show. Rarely, Leo will have someone like Corey Doctorow that actually knows something, hence the four-star review. Owen JJ Stone is a frequent guest, and exemplifies not having expertise. He makes any episode that heâs in worse by loudly staking out an ill-informed position and then boisterously talking over other guests. I get that heâs a smart guy and that this is a character heâs doing for entertainment, but itâs one that doesnât work for me, and being smart isnât the same as being informed.\n\nIt honestly feels like Leo is getting older and more and more embarrassed by his affluence and previous tech Utopianism, and has now over-corrected by making a weekly bummer cast.\n\nIt'll be great when they stop trying to analyze every one of Elon Musk's bowel movements every single episode.\n\nAND STOP WITH THE COMMIE SOY LEFTIST OPINIONS! TECH IS CAPITALISTIC IN ITS INTRINSIC VALUES AND SHOULD BE EMBRACED ACCORDINGLY.\n\nThe left leaning garbage is preventing me from joining and recommending Club TWiT to friends and family.\n\nI fast forward through those political and social discussions because of it.\n\nYou need less fragile guests who will show up and take their jobs seriously with important events like CES. Hopefully you review the statistics as to where your listeners lose interest."
