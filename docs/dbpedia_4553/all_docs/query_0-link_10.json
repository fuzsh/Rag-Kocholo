        "text": "Alright let's talk about one part of pitching tracks where I see people make the most mistakes in and that is adding descriptions to your pitch. I'll give you two examples: Ex1: The melody of our single arrives to your heart like a train of emotions in mellow april wind that's carried on the tracks of silk bass lines which will captivate your soul and enpower you to greatness. Whilst the soothing alto serenades over the horizon the lyrics that feel like a guiding hand in the midst of tomorrow. Ex2: This single is about finding inner peace after a difficult life decision. It was recorded in Brad Pitt's studio in France, on the same amps Led Zepellin used for their last album. It was produced by Timbaland, mixed and mastered by Rick Rubin. Both will promote it on their socials. We will run a pre-save/add campaign for 2 weeks, special merch tied to the release, have 6 live TV interviews, and 2 TV performances, listening party w/fans and we have 15 OOHs across the city promoting the release + soc. media campaigns, etc. Now which one do you think is more likely to get playlisted? I GUARANTEE YOU it's the second one. Why? In reality DSPs don't care that much about the detailed descriptions of the sound, they can listen to it on their own. They care about building a story around the release and understanding how you will drive traffic to their platform. Simple as that:) #musicindustry #musicbusiness #playlists\n\nRID: Like pirate radio More about RID: https://buff.ly/40vdIP6 A while back, when radio was like the internet in terms of reaching large numbers of people, pirate radio stations started playing music that the legit channels would not play. The stations became so popular that even after they were shutdown their style and music selections transferred to the mainstream channels. Basically, all they did was to put their music on the airwaves and allow anyone that wanted to tune in. Word of mouth spread their channel and the rest is history. I mentioned in previous posts that 2b Acting’s Remote Interactive Displays (RID) can emulate a video broadcast service. As a reminder, with RID viewers connect to a video using their mobile device so they can see, hear and interact with the displayed video. They can only connect when the video is playing so along with the link to connect to the display there should be a play schedule. Is is therefore possible to put out your video using the internet, similar to how pirate radio used the radio waves, and let word of mouth (and/or advertising) find your video. Will this work? Well, 2b Acting will be giving it a try with the launch of their RID 101 channel. At scheduled times they will play a video for viewers to connect with on a regular basis. What will be playing on RID 101 is unknown at the moment but isn’t it exciting to have to wait to find out? What do you think they should show? Let me know and I’ll pass it on to the team. Next post (13 Dec @ 3pm): RID: Please sir. Can I have more #2bacting #displays #presentations #meetings #signage #video #broadcasting #siv #rid #inview More about RID: https://buff.ly/40vdIP6 get RID: https://buff.ly/472T2Rh Contact: https://buff.ly/3KcxjvJ\n\nTV Production Class: Countdown to Pilot Episode Week In the dynamic world of television production, timing is everything. Our TV Production classes, initially set for their much-anticipated pilot episode week, have adapted to the unexpected shift in schedule due to the declared holidays. The resilience and flexibility inherent in the world of media have once again come into play, as we move this milestone event to next week.The excitement is palpable as three classes prepare to take over the airwaves under the COMMTV block on UST TigerTV, airing Monday to Friday, 11 AM to 12 noon. This isn't just any regular programming; it's a showcase of talent, creativity, and hard work from our students divided across three production houses, delivering a total of six shows, each with three episodes. The upcoming weeks promise to be an exhilarating journey—a real-life rollercoaster of experiences where theory meets practice. Our students will navigate the challenges of live production, storytelling, and audience engagement, all while managing the behind-the-scenes complexities that come with producing a television show. This pilot episode week is more than just an assignment; it's a launchpad for our students into the real world of TV production, offering them hands-on experience that will prepare them for their future careers. Stay tuned for what promises to be an exceptional display of talent and creativity from the next generation of media professionals. #TVProduction #USTTigerTV #CommTV\n\nThis is a good summary of where things stand in the world of tv. Commissions are down 50% on scripted shows. Expect them to stay low. AI will become a commonplace tool - but in a regulated environment for unionized shows. Expect a number of the streamers to merge in the next while. If you make a big hit for a streamer you will get paid more - but mostly if it finds its audience in the first 90 days. Big brand name creators and celebs will take more of the pie. The middle of the pack will get less chances and less money in the long haul. This will privilege the big studios with expensive talent deals who know how to package. The payday for unscripted will be on global formats or celeb and brand- driven doc series. More “Traitors” and “Quarteback”."
