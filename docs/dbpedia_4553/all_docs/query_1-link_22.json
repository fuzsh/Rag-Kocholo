It's time for the last Ask the Tech Guys of the year In duper to play. Hello Mikah Sargent, hello Leo Laporte. Don't shake my head in the mustache.\n\nMy mustache is slowly but surely falling we had to do this because look how beautifully dressed Mikah is. You look like an Edwardian prince. Oh, thank you. I look like Captain Kangaroo after a long night out. But this is a show where you answer your tech questions, if you dare ask them, 8887242884. That's the phone number.\n\n0:02:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat is the phone number you call. You may also visit the URL calltwittv, which you can do on your phone or on your computer. We suggest the phone because it makes it very easy. You type in that URL. It takes you to this little screen where it says hey, join this zoom. And then you hang out in the zoom. Very important, there will be a button somewhere at the bottom of your screen. If you're on your phone or you're on your computer, that is a little hand and we'll say raise hand. You want to click or tap that button. That lets us know that you're not just hanging out in the zoom, but then that you indeed do have a question. You can also email us at twittv. You can send in text, you can send in audio, you can send in video. We'll get those questions and, of note, your questions today need not be holiday related, despite the fact that we ourselves are. But if they are bonus points in my heart from you.\n\n0:02:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nAbsolutely Jolly good.\n\n0:03:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMikah, micah, your mustache.\n\n0:03:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nThank you.\n\n0:03:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThank you.\n\n0:03:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnybody got any crazy glue I could use. All right. What else? What do we do this time of year? We do the stories of the year, do we? I threw you with that one.\n\n0:03:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nShocking.\n\n0:03:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe actually we could, but we don't. No and we won't. We got best ofs. Next week we do, which will be fun. So that's the 24. That's Christmas Eve. No, we don't have a best of for us, though. We're taking the weeks off.\n\n0:03:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's right. We should take the time off.\n\n0:03:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe didn't make a best of. I don't know why, because I guess the editors said you know what, leo and Mikah there's nothing. Nothing was good this year, to repeat. So no, we're just going to take two weeks off. So this is our last one of the year and we will be back On the 7th.\n\n0:03:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJanuary 7th.\n\n0:03:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf my math, your math, is math Good job, but there will be a best of for Tweet on Christmas Eve, and actually Christmas Eve is our holiday show, which is the old fart, which is not good but there's a fire burning. So anyway, the old farts Christmas show with Jeff Jarvis, steve Gibson, rod Pyle and Doc Searles. That's really going to be fun, and me, the old timers talking about the good old days. But also, I think, and really importantly, because we've seen it all, what the future holds is. I think our context helps understand this, and then there will be a best of on New Year's Eve for Tweet. Many of our shows will have best ofs all next week, so you have holiday plans.\n\n0:04:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, just the typical holiday plans of spending time with some family. Is there a wordle in your holiday plans? There's not, but I saw this story about what we've learned from wordle 515 million wordles.\n\n0:04:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is the New York Times word puzzle Solved in the year 2023. And it says for the first time, we've analyzed how players performed in half a billion wordle games and the results with strategies, the wordle bot I didn't even know they had a wordle bot. That seems like cheating. I don't think I want to use the wordle bot. I mean honestly, really, of the 30 starting words the most popular and this surprises me Do you have a starting word you use over and over on wordle?\n\n0:05:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't play it anymore. I used to use tiger.\n\n0:05:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nInteresting Because of course, you want to try E-T-A-I-O-N those are the most common letters in the English language and then SHRDLU. I use tears Because it has E-A-T, but it also has R and S and S, I feel like, and especially if you get an S at the end, that eliminates the possibility of plurals.\n\n0:05:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I thought there were never plurals. I don't know. I seem to remember someone telling me that Don't worry about plurals.\n\n0:05:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, people have been using a ju, but guess what the New York Times says? It's terrible. I do not use a du or audio.\n\nThat's yours, john, yeah, audio is one of the most popular wordle starting words A, du, stare, slate, audio, raise, crank. So this is a word puzzle if you haven't played it and you're guessing. You have five guesses to guess a five letter word. But you get to start. It's kind of like mastermind you get to start with a word and then it tells you how many are right and how many are in the correct position. So the starting word really makes a big difference. So everybody likes a du for some reason. I mean it's 8%. It's not overwhelmingly the favorite. Mine tears is down here way in the less than 1% category. However, starting with a du or audio John puts human players at a disadvantage. And, by the way, what the hell? Who cares if it's not a human player? Forget the non human players.\n\nI don't care about them. So if you start with compared to starting with slate, which apparently they think is a very good word A du will give you 132 extra guesses over a 12 month period. 10 extra guesses a month. This really feels like it's over analysis. What is that Naval gazing? Naval gazing it is, but you know what it made in the New York Times a lot of money it did indeed, their naval is full of gold.\n\n0:07:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a golden naval. That's why they're staring at it. I'd stare at it if my game were full of gold, if I looked down and suddenly there was gold.\n\n0:07:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhoa there's gold in them their navels. Did you see the story about Mark Zuckerberg's secret Hawaiian?\n\n0:07:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\ncompound. Oh, my goodness, you can't talk about it, it's secret, but somebody is, apparently. I love the line in it. This was my favorite line and it's very near the beginning and it says oh, come on, where is it? Basically, it says oh, here we go. Almost anyone who passes compound security from carpenters to electricians to painters to security guards is bound by a strict non-disclosure agreement. According to several workers involved, who disclosed it.\n\n0:08:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah Well, they didn't give their names in their hope and they won't get fired, but people do get fired. It is on Kauai, the beautiful garden island of Hawaii. Hawaiians are not thrilled about it. He's blocked off the beach, which you're not supposed to do, and people are upset that. People who are native to the island say who is this robotic fellow? Some of the weird things that we learned. First of all, it is one of the largest building projects in history yeah, private, largest private Private. He bought the land, a lot of it, starting in 2014, and he kept buying properties, so it's a fairly big share of the island 1400 acres. The funniest thing is there is a 5000 square foot safe room or bunker that is underground, which means he's planning for the apocalypse, its own power source, its own water, food sources.\n\nAccording to the wire, it'll cost 270 million dollars in the land alone, Anyway. So I think this is just a leak of what every billionaire is doing. We're just building a hidey hole, While the rest of us I don't know what's going to happen. Are we going to run out of food, water? Is the earth going to get too warm to survive? Who knows? But they're planning for it, which is just kind of awful. I mean, first of all, what kind of life are you and Priscilla and the kids going to have underground in a 5000 square foot bunker for years? That sounds awful.\n\nAnd everybody up there is dead or sick or passing feet. I mean, that is you know. Would you want to do that? No, I'd stay up with the rest of the people, do what I could to help and if it, you know, if I starved to death, I starved to death, but I don't want to live in a 5000. That's crazy. It tells you a little something about the psychology. You know. Some of them are reconditioning old ICBM missile silos to be, you know, again underground. It wasn't the plot of silo that Apple TV shows. They're all living underground and who's that is? Oh, this is. This is my favorite fallout 76. Isn't it? I love this four. 74 four, fallout four.\n\nOkay, that's your little robot friend. Did you play that game excessively? Is that why you? I played three, four was, and I like 76. Although I know people didn't like it, but I liked it.\n\n0:10:38 - John Ashley\n\nYeah, it was. It was okay, but just wasn't the same.\n\n0:10:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnyway, yeah, it is like fallout, because you come out of a bunker and fallout, don't you? Yeah, and to the into the world which is somehow been destroyed by nuclear war or something. Anyway, let's not think about that. This is the holiday season, let's think jolly, jolly thoughts.\n\n0:10:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh dear, not about you're going to go where I think you're going. Oh no, you go there. I just I thought we were going to talk about pig butcher. I thought you might.\n\n0:11:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is a jolly thought. So do you know what pig butchering is? I had no idea.\n\n0:11:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI do now. We talked about the show.\n\n0:11:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nI just didn't know the term. You get those messages all the time that just say hello, no, hi. Or I get a lot of more complicated ones like hey, Joanne, I'm not going to be able to come into work today, I'm feeling terrible. Or yeah, I can't go to that party. You know they try all kinds.\n\n0:11:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I'm. Oh, it was so nice to meet you, stephanie, at that party the other night.\n\n0:11:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's always not your name, and it's often something that you would go oh gosh, I hope she, I hope she gets that flat fixed or whatever, Because what they want you to do is say, oh, this is not Stephanie, this is Mikah. I'm sorry you got the wrong number in which they say oh why, Mikah? I hope you're having a good day.\n\n0:11:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHow are you doing? How are you doing so, after we talk for a little bit, here's a photo of me. What are you thinking about?\n\n0:11:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo apparently they call it pig butchering Lord have mercy. Because they're basically. It's a scam. You figured that out, I think, a long time ago and they're trying to get money out of isolated and lonely people with the promises of friendship and love. They never offer me friendship and love.\n\n0:12:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMostly they just want me to buy crypto, but anyway hours usually end up being crypto, but these, these are even slower burns. These seem to take a little while and they really try to kind of befriend you and essentially they end up making, yeah, as a lonely or isolated person, this person becomes your friend or convince you that they are in love with you and that you're in love with them.\n\n0:12:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey use to have a name for this called catfishing.\n\nI don't know why we need pig butchering, I know, I don't know why it happens to me, but I think that's federal prosecutors, because they say they have four indictments and two arrests have been made in an international pig butchering scheme that cost victims more than this is what's sad $80 million. Usually elderly, lonely people. They take their life savings. Four men have been indicted, two arrests have been made. I guess the other two probably are out of the US. Lu Zhang, justin Walker, joseph Wong all California residents conspired conspired with Illinois resident Heilong Zhu to launder the illicit proceeds of their scam. Pig butchering comes from the Chinese phrase Shaju Pan, so I guess maybe the Chinese invented it. It's cold messaging victims. Anyway, don't fall for that.\n\n0:13:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, if someone messages you out of the blue whether they're talking to you or mentioning someone else's name. Just be aware and, as we always say on this show, we know many of you who are watching this show are sophisticated and understand the implications here. This is an opportunity to tell family members hey, if you get these messages out of the blue, it's not someone who's there to be your witness, it's not someone who's there to be your friend. It is something that you should not trust and it's not a wrong number.\n\n0:14:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is what really annoys me is they're playing off these people's generosity and warmth of spirit. Oh, I'm so sorry.\n\nYou know you've got to flat. Is there anything I can do to help? Oh no, but, by the way, can you give me a million dollars? That'd help? So, anyway, and I think there's a little cryptocurrency involved, of course. So sad, because cryptocurrency had all this promise and ended up just being a way for scammers to rip people off. Well, there's the news. That was Jolly. I mean like Jolly, I'm sorry I got off because I swallowed my mustache. Okay, you know what? I'm going to retire the old stash.\n\n0:14:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think I will, In fact.\n\n0:14:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nI should retire this at Actually ripped that time, did it? It actually was stuck. It's stuck Of all the things you know, one at the fall off and then, when you do you can't 8887242884. We go to the phones as soon as my hat stops. Is it done? Are you done? All right, let us. Who should we?\n\n0:15:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJohn Ashley boy producer has thought we were agreeing that we only do the boy producer for one show. Do we agree to that? I think you did say that, hey old man.\n\n0:15:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat's up?\n\n0:15:25 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOkay, old man, yeah, I'm the old man, you call me boy producer, so it's only fair. Let's pick up on a wireless caller.\n\n0:15:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet's press the button and see what we can get on the old horn. Get on, get on the horn.\n\n0:15:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nGet on the horn. I don't know where that comes from. I think it's horn shaped, right. I think it's more like trumpeting your announcement. Yeah get on the horn? Oh, maybe because think about the old phones where it was kind of a horn that you spoke into. You know you hung it on the side. I had to roll the thing.\n\n0:16:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, martha, give me, give me Joe, call her press star six to unmute and say hello.\n\n0:16:11 - Caller\n\nHello Leo, Hello Michael, Hi, what's your?\n\n0:16:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nname and where you calling from First name.\n\n0:16:17 - Caller\n\nThis is Kenny from Cotton Town, tennessee.\n\n0:16:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh my good friend Kenny.\n\n0:16:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nHello Kenny, cotton Town Kenny we call him. I don't know why. What's up, kenny?\n\n0:16:28 - Caller\n\nOh, that's because I live in a city called that, but anyway, I have a, that's right.\n\nAnyway, I got a Netflix question and a little IT story I wanted to tell you guys. So last Friday I was going around with at work you know we have a company agreement with HP to provide laptops to all the supervisors that I worked with, the managers and so forth, and one of them you know our company occasionally has, the IT group throws out like these software updates on occasion to update a system and apparently what had happened was that it accidentally bricks one of the older laptops that they had and we were trying to figure out what it was. And normally in the cases like that, when you have something like that, always has something to do with power and sure enough, it was low on power and thankfully I found a good power supply. Initially had usbc port, but it did not use it because it was an older one, from 2018. Or obviously couldn't just charge, and so thankfully we had a port where I could put it in there and we're able to get to where it could update and it works fine.\n\nBut this manager was kind of worried about it for a little bit because he didn't know why it wouldn't turn on. It turns out it was in sort of a hibernation mode. It wasn't totally turned off, but it just didn't have enough power to finish it because it just didn't have enough juice in the battery, as they say. So thankfully we've figured it out and now up and running, even if it is an older model. But I was able to kind of toy with it a little bit just to see. So I can keep getting my tricks with IT done, and along with printers, that's great.\n\n0:18:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nHad he not been charging it.\n\n0:18:15 - Caller\n\nNot really I don't understand.\n\n0:18:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nAfter four hours my computer stops working. You know, one thing that does is the case which is a little weird is way a lot of laptops work. The power goes through the battery, so the battery isn't like a secondary thing that it switches over to when it's not plugged in. The power is literally going through it in series and what that means is that when the battery stops working it's too old, it stops taking charge. Often those laptops stop working. So here's a little pro tip If your battery is not charging and your laptop won't come on, if you can remove the battery, because what that does is it takes the battery out of the series and now the power is going directly to the laptop. And often that's a way to get an older laptop working again, and it has to be an older battery. But it's up to remove the battery, frankly, sad to say. But removing those batteries and keeping it plugged in, you can at least use it. If you can get a replacement battery, all the better. What's your question about Netflix? Caught in town, kenny?\n\n0:19:15 - Caller\n\nWell, I don't know, you're familiar with Louis Rossman, right? Oh, I love Louis.\n\n0:19:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nRossman, he's the. He's a guy who had a Manhattan repair. I think he's kind of given up his business, the Manhattan repair business and became an expert. Well, he moved to Austin, ah, okay, but he became an expert in kind of right to repair. He was a big right to repair expert, of course, youtube celebrity, you know, and he's got 2 million subscribers to his YouTube page.\n\n0:19:44 - Caller\n\nAnd I'm one of them. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So he's come out with several videos on Netflix in which the biggest gripe is that if you're trying to watch something on, let's say, 4k or 1080p like I did this morning, I was trying to watch something on Netflix and even without a VPN like I say, express VPN aircove routers I've used in the past because I'm surprised it won't work with it, but it just will not pick up anything 1080p or HD in real good quality. You know right off the bat, you know you have to wait forward to load and everything, and I used Apple TV for Netflix. It's almost like and he mentioned it in one of these videos that unless you like you play by their rules and use, like there's certain smart TV, you're not going to get like the full 4K, 1080p experience, and he kind of called it out on that per se. And I guess my question is to you is is there a reason why Netflix screams well on certain devices and not so nice on others?\n\n0:20:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt used to be and maybe this has changed. I have a little problem with most of these YouTubers, including Lewis, which is they get views by being outraged, being angry, being there's something wrong so it's all about. You know that'll really worry you down after a while if you're angry at everything all the time. So I think that just like spending too much time on Twitter, spending too much time watching these angry YouTube videos, can really worry it down and make you think the whole thing has fallen apart and the crap checks going to hell and God and they, and it's pretty soon you become an old man yelling at the clouds. So just a word of warning you don't be like me. You know, watch some upbeat stuff every once in a while, but YouTube really kind of the algorithm kind of pushes them in that direction. In any event, it used to be and I'll have to check to see if it is that actually the best way to watch Netflix was on Apple, because so here's how.\n\nThink about how Netflix's architecture is. You've got Netflix Corporation Home Office with all those movies on servers. Now they probably in fact I'm sure they use a CDN, so those movies, just like for us, are moved out to the edge closer to you on a CDN. Cdn has a copy of the movie and so the movie is going to play back from that server. Apple, because they wanted the best quality, and this used to be and I think it's still true said to Netflix.\n\nForget that will be your CDN for Apple TV users. They use Akamai and we will, because we want the experience to be the best on Apple TV. Cash all your movies and they won't be coming from you or your CDN. You won't be competing with other Netflix users. They'll be coming from Apple directly and that in the past has always given Apple the TV the best, I think, the best Netflix quality. Netflix quality does go up and down, depends on your bandwidth, of course, and this is the problem. It's hard to see where in the chain this is falling apart, but I've had good experiences with Apple TV.\n\n0:22:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI used to have this issue where it would take a while to load, and once I just plugged in with Ethernet with the new Apple TV 4K, I have no issues with Netflix loading immediately. Only in rare occasions where you hit that perfect time where everybody else in the vicinity is also watching will I get a blur from time to time. But outside of that, yeah and that was switching from using Wi-Fi to using Ethernet that really, of course, made difference.\n\n0:23:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nI do that on all of my TVs. You may remember, a few years ago we went and had somebody crawl around in the attic and drop Ethernet to all the places where TVs are, because always hardwired is better Always. But, and so that's one thing. Netflix quality itself, I think, has often been slammed for being over compressed. I think that's what Alex Lindsey has said. I haven't noticed that personally.\n\nYeah, I haven't had an issue with it, but maybe I'm just not as this is why it's hard to it's hard to assess because it could be Alex is watching on Wi-Fi. You know, we don't know. Yeah, we don't know what everybody's exact situation is.\n\n0:23:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd that goes back to your point, leo, with the YouTuber thing. I think I've seen this a lot with tech reviewers in general is a lack of what boils down to empathy, meaning that they end up believing that their experience is everyone's experience. And so if I had this experience, that means that this is the way it is globally and I'm going to complain about it in that way. And it happens to be the case that you identify that this was a problem that you were having as well, and so it works in this case. But simply because one person is having an experience does not necessarily mean that it's global, worldwide, and you're going to find people who say no, like I just did.\n\n0:24:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, I haven't had this issue, so yeah, I don't this is a problem we have and we always have to fight with, is our own tendency to say whatever's happened to me is happening to everybody. Yeah, that's human nature, and vice versa oh it never happens to me.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with you, and so, yeah, it's human nature and it takes. It's one of the reasons experienced tech journalists often are better because they've spent a lot of time learning not to do that. In the past they used to have editors. Nobody has editors anymore, but they used to have.\n\nI wonder I'm looking for Netflix network architecture because it is a very interesting architecture. They use ISPs, for instance, as also as their CDN. So big ISPs like Comcast will have a Netflix server on prem, which you're getting it from. Here's a let's see it looks like. Here's a network diagram on LinkedIn and it is crazy. But if you think about it, to me this has always been amazing is how the network architecture is for play massive operations like Facebook, netflix, google, what they must do. And really I hear people, including Lewis Rossman, saying Netflix has taken five seconds to load a YouTube video. It just cracks me up because I come from a time when five seconds wow. It would buffer for a minute before it would start playing back in the real days, the real audio days. So if Netflix I mean if Google's slowing it down, that's a different thing.\n\nBut this is an interesting article from techbit. It's called, inside Netflix, a deep dive into its cutting edge system architecture. I find this stuff fascinating. This one's from October, so it's not too old, which means it's probably a fairly recent. Let me see if I can open this image. Oh, now it's doing all the things everybody these days has to do to survive, including us popping up a newsletter thing, but this is an interesting architecture. We've got Open Connect, which is Netflix. In fact, there's a article about Netflix Open Connect. This is their system. This is kind of for doing this, and look at this crazy architecture. So I think it depends on so many things not just your home network, but your ISP, whether your ISP is caching Netflix for you, the device you're using. Somebody in our Discord saying they like Netflix best on Roku? That maybe it'll be, but who? But?\n\n0:27:01 - Chris Marquardt\n\nwhy is?\n\n0:27:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nthat right. So all of this is very complicated because they are serving so much data to so many people for a long time. Maybe this is still the case. Especially if you had a cable internet. It would get slow around 7 pm every night. It was because everybody's watching Netflix, which is one of the arguments Netflix has for Comcast and others to have a Netflix server in their facility, because that speeds things up quite a bit. So I wish we could say we know categorically what's going on or what the best way to watch Netflix is. I don't think it's as simple as that. So many devices involved.\n\n0:27:41 - Caller\n\nNo, no, that really is really a good example, really just how the internet itself works, regardless of whether it's Netflix or YouTube or even Twitter. I mean, it just takes a lot of effort to get all of this. You've heard us talk about Cash Fly.\n\n0:27:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's our CDN. Netflix Open Connect is their CDN. That's the one where they put servers in ISPs if they can. Not all ISPs go along with that. Most of them do because it's good for their customers.\n\n0:28:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, exactly that's saving them customer support it's so complicated.\n\n0:28:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey use Chaos Monkey, a tool that randomly terminates instances, to make sure that your system can tolerate failures. They're doing so much stuff and I have some friends who do this kind of thing for Facebook and other companies. You have a few.\n\n0:28:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nChaos Monkey friends.\n\n0:28:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have some Chaos Monkeys in my Rolodex and I have to say it is a highly paid position because you're doing magic. You are doing magic, but so much magic that it's almost impossible, Kenny, for us to know what the path from Netflix to you is. That path has a lot of moving parts.\n\n0:28:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is a good article If you want to read it.\n\n0:28:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nTechbitcom it's a tech blog and they've done a really good write-up of the Netflix architecture. We'll put it in the show notes. There's a lot of information in here and it really is. It's quite impressive. They also have ways you can ping it and so forth. If you'd like to check. You could spend some energy figuring out what's going on with your connection, if you really care. That's cool, yeah.\n\n0:29:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo yeah, maybe you should check that out.\n\n0:29:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a good article. Yeah, I'm very impressed. Chaos Monkey is a tool developed by Netflix to randomly break things. It's a good name, isn't it? In conclusion, he writes Netflix architecture is an intricate blend of cutting edge technologies and strategies designed for global scale, fault tolerance and a high degree of personalization, making it a leader in the streaming industry. Behind every play button on Netflix is an intricate web of technologies and strategies. I think that's fairly fairly accurate. Yeah, I bet you, netflix has a white paper on this. I knew they do on OpenConnect. I bet you there's other places you can read more about Netflix Interesting system. Yeah, hey, it's good to talk to you, kenny. How's the, how's the work going? You liking it?\n\n0:30:18 - Caller\n\nOh, it's going good. It's like you said about making magic. That's kind of how they feel about me whenever there's a issue with, like, a laptop or printers. You know, like it's like I was just saying to Mikah you know, I always hardwired the printers at our workstation yes, we can get things done fast and Wi-Fi. So that advice does go in effect, not just with printers or Apple TV, it's everything like that.\n\nAnd I do want to say I did watch Oppenheimer on Apple TV yesterday and I know you guys were talking about Chris Nolan and how he uses audio and the sound quality. I didn't have that much of a problem with it when I watched it. That's because I probably have it hardwired. Surprise, surprise with a Sony speaker. In fact, everything I have audio and video is Sony and it is sad that you know Sony is kind of I don't want to say totally given up on TV, just the Samsung. You know Samsung's really kind of taking the market per se. But I've always been a Sony guy for many years and I've always felt like they make good quality and hopefully down the road they maybe will make good quality products as far as audio again, but it's a long trip for them to go if they want to challenge Samsung. But yeah, I always felt that like watching Oppenheimer and no problem with audio. I guess it just depends on what you use per se.\n\n0:31:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, let's not forget, scott Wilkinson told us the best TV of the year in the TV shootout that they do every year, the value system TV shootout, was a Sony. So Sony's still making the best TVs, thank you.\n\n0:31:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nKenny. Thank you so much, kenny. Take care, you guys have a good day. Merry Christmas Merry. Christmas Happy holiday Cotton Town, kenny.\n\n0:31:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nCotton Town Kenny. Why do we call him Cotton Town Kenny?\n\n0:32:01 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhy? Because he's from Cotton Town, oh.\n\n0:32:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nI thought nobody knew no. All right, so you know, I'm from Kondakint. It's not better, is it?\n\n0:32:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI mean, it's better Young and bright, that's great, yeah, actually, why don't I?\n\n0:32:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nanswer an email. Oh my gosh, Now I think I might have misarranged this. I think so. You came around here and snuck around. Well, we were all so busy. Is Rob's the one I should start with?\n\n0:32:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, Okay, so I need my monocle for this so I can read it, so you can actually see it yeah, rob writes great show.\n\n0:32:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nThank you so much for the education. I still remember watching your show on cable. Yes, remember cable. I did Cable. I loved that. Clark Cable, I think his name was A voice therapist, stupid, sorry.\n\n0:32:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nClark Cable is so dumb.\n\n0:32:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou call that a stupid joke. Sorry, Go ahead. A voice therapist says, Rob, he needs to take notes as I do voice exercises. Oh, he's working with the voice. He's going. Mommy made me match my MN names. My vocal cords are damaged. I'm sorry, Rob, the keystrokes are loud, my focus is distracted. I told the voice therapist there are keyboards that have quiet key clicks. The voice therapist says what I want to know what brand to buy. He loved the idea, but I couldn't find info on the internet that was reliable. What keyboard would you recommend? A mushy keyboard. So this is actually. You know, get us going on keyboards. You're never going to get us to stop.\n\n0:33:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou and John, I don't care what you're going to use. We love our keyboards.\n\n0:33:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo this is a big question. Most modern keyboards are quiet, by the way, I should point out. So your therapist is using some old keyboard that he probably really likes, but is a clicky keyboard. The original IBM Omni-key Northgate Omni-key keyboards had what we called buckling springs. John C DeVorek used to sing the praises of a buckling spring keyboard. You can't get really buckling springs anymore. Where'd you put You're there? You can't really get buckling springs anymore.\n\nBut the good news is there are lots of companies out there that would make switches that are different, have different characteristics. Key travel is one of them. The bounce of the key is another one and the audible click is another. The buckling keys were very loud and you remember in fact you probably still hear it when you're on the line with airline reservationists or you're at the desk there, and it's because those are buckling keys. Those are old terminals that have big buckling key keyboards. I like them. They're good for a carpal tunnel because you're really working. It's not smaller, but apparently smaller movements are worse for you. So you're moving your hands more and you're working a little harder. So there's a couple of things to say about that.\n\nHonestly, most laptops are pretty quiet. If you can hear it. I don't know if you're on a call or not. If the therapist's microphone is in the laptop, then you will hear it. You will absolutely hear it. We have this problem sometimes occasionally with some of our guests on our shows where they are not using a standalone mic. You notice we always try to use a standalone mic. They're using their laptop mic and you hear banging on it. Remember how Stacy you could hear her bang like crazy on the twig because she was a loud typist. So maybe your therapist is a loud typist or maybe you're on a zoom call. Your therapist is not using a separate mic.\n\n0:35:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, and another thing along with that is, even if there is a separate mic being used, if it's on the same desk or table as that keyboard and they are a hard type then that will also go right through it. Yeah.\n\n0:35:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nTelephoneing, telegraphing.\n\n0:35:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nTelegraphing that's it.\n\n0:35:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo they've provided me with some fun keyboards. This is the keyboard I personally like, which is not a quiet keyboard, but this is the Key Chron you can spend. This is, I think, a $300 keyboard, which is crazy because you could buy $5 keyboards. The $5 keyboards are quiet, by the way, but this one of the reasons I like Key Chron. First of all, this thing weighs five pounds. It's very heavy. You could do some workouts with it. It also has some features that I prefer. It's a wireless, but it can pair to multiple Bluetooth key computers so it can easily switch computers with it. But the other thing is you could choose the keys, and now Key Chron has its own key caps that they use. There are a variety of companies that make different key caps. This is a tester.\n\n0:36:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI love that thing.\n\n0:36:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love it. This is so great. Is this yours, John? Yeah, this is a tester for a company called Cherry Keyboard. And, by the way, go to Reddit r-slash-r-slash-keyboard and you'll find your people.\n\nMechanical keyboards, mechanical keyboards, even better. You'll find nutjobs. You'll find people who really take this stuff seriously. I'm a little, I'm a dabbler, so this is what this is. Cherry sends this out. This is a sampler. If they're different, they have different switches. It's like a chocolate sampler. It's a sampler. So they have Speed, silver, black, silent, black, red, silent, red, tactile, gray, brown, silver, other, no, no, clear, green, blue and White. So you can try them. I'll try it. Let's see the Silent one. See how silent that is. That's silent.\n\n0:37:29 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYou want to hear a clicky one.\n\n0:37:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nHere's it. Hear how loud that is. Yep, oh, that's a good one. What is that? That's a Cherry Green, see, I like that, but it's not good on the radio or TV or for a sound, a voice therapist. So maybe try the Cherry Silent Black.\n\n0:37:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd I'm thinking too, this is the unique thing about a voice therapist when I was working with Joanna Scott Wilkinson's wife, who does voice therapy specifically, we had to turn off all of the noise cancellation features of Zoom as we were talking, so she could hear you, so she could hear me, and so that the little sounds that I was making that normally Zoom would make go away she could hear. And so, yeah, you have to have that stuff turned off so you can hear those little, they can hear those little sounds that your throat might be making, your vocal cords might be making.\n\n0:38:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, yeah, you would have this Cherry Blue. So that was this is really that. So here's Cherry Clear, here's Cherry Green, here's Cherry Blue, it's even louder. And here's Cherry White. I used to use Cherry Brown and Cherry Red. Here's Cherry Red.\n\n0:38:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think I ended up choosing Cherry Green. If I was going to get one, I'd get the Cherry Green.\n\n0:38:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nI like the blue now Wow, that is clicky. They maybe have like a little clicker in there to make that sound.\n\n0:38:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere's a tiny little cricket.\n\n0:38:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo that just gives you an idea. I mean here's, you know, 12 different keys with 12 different sounds, and that's just a fraction of what's out there. Cherry's not the only switchmaker, so you could tell them the cheapest, the cheaper the keyboard, the less the travel and the softer it will be. Those are mushy, they're plastic domes, they don't make any sound. So she could go out and just get a cheap keyboard. But I think, if you hear it, either her microphone's right next to it, because look, here I'll make, get that clicky keyboard, the clicky key, the Cherry Blue, right next to the microphone. Now I'll do it down in my lap. You can barely hear it right. So either her microphone is pointing at her lap or, I'm guessing, almost certainly, she's on a zoom call on a laptop, using the mic on the laptop, and that means when she types it is like thunder. You know what, leo? What you need to get you one of these? That's 70 bucks, that's 72 different Cherry keys, wow.\n\n0:39:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJust Cherry. It's a variety of different switches.\n\n0:40:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd if you go to Macass R slash mechanical keyboard, you'll see there are new companies that make switches that people's prefer to. Cherry Cherry was a hot thing five years ago, not anymore. I love these key. I want to make their own Look at that Isn't that crazy.\n\n0:40:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't even care about the link. Yeah, because I love money for Christmas.\n\n0:40:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think key crime will send you the little ones for free, won't they, john? Now you have to buy them. You have to buy them. Well, there you go, you don't. You don't need to worry about that. Tell her to stop using her laptop microphone. Yeah, get her a $30 headset mic that won't pick up the key strokes. That's probably the real solution. Agreed, good question. All right, we have time for one more.\n\n0:40:40 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet's do one quick, more quick, even before Dick. Oh yeah, dick will join us in about six minutes. I closed the email box.\n\n0:40:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh oh wow, I thought we were done. I'm picking from the top. It's a long stack. We really got to do more emails. This is crazy. I did quite a few while you were out, did you? Good man? All right, this comes from Cherry. Oh wow, she's the. That's the woman. They named the key caps After Cherry from Oceanside. Hi, cherry, I used to live in.\n\n0:41:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOceanside, California. Oh, I didn't know you live in California before before, way long time ago, I was five and six years old. You don't really remember In Missouri, no, I remember it quite well. Oh, that's why I didn't ever want to live in California, because I thought it was going to be like Oceanside, where it was hot all the time. Oh do you remember?\n\n0:41:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nCherry, I don't remember. She remembers you. She says hi, micah. No, she says what's the best thing? She puts it in quotes to buy. So I could do it myself Do what yourself? Convert. Oh, it's in the subject Convert old home movies to digital. I have hours of tapes, slash movies, to convert. Well, that's two different problems. One's tapes, vhs tapes, and one is if you say movies, I'm thinking super eight or high. You know the film. What do you think, mikey?\n\n0:42:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo if you, she's your friend, if you know her. No, if you insist on doing it yourself, elgato is probably the company that I would use. Elgato makes a video capture device. It is. It has the standard, what is it? Coaxial options as well as an S video cable, if you can believe it, and then it just plugs in USB into your computer and then you play it back on your VHS into the video capture device from Elgato. It's available for just under $90 on Amazon. It's just called Elgato video capture I. I'm curious how you feel, leo, about doing it yourself versus just using one of the services that's out there.\n\n0:42:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo if you don't have a, if you have either a lot of time or not, a lot of movies to convert, you could do it yourself, but it takes time. It takes the same amount of time as those movies are. Very few things will do it faster than the actual length of the movie. So if you have a thousand hours of movies to convert, it's going to take you at least a thousand hours and some expense. Just digitize them and then you might want to edit them, etc. Etc. Etc. So, honestly, what I would do is get a box together and send it to scan cafe or one of the many different companies that will just take your old movies. One of the advantages of doing that is if you have a variety of formats. So if some of your movies are on high eight video, some of them are on VHS, some of them are on film, you put it all in the box and they have. Their job is to have all the different ways of playing that back and digitize it. So, yeah, it depends on whether you have more time or more money. It costs you money to do it, but it saves you time to have them do it. But doing it yourself takes time. Now, I was just checking on Amazon because for a long time, about 10 years ago, they were selling VHS players that would take a tape on one side and they burnable DVD in the other. Just do it and you'd press play and it would just do it. And yeah, they're all now renewed, or, you know, I don't think anybody's selling them new and they're expensive, they're about 300 bucks. Here's a Magnavox, a Sony, a Samsung Wow, that's 500 bucks. So the whole idea of these is, you know they they're DVD burners, slash players, but they're kind of there. It's kind of an old technology. I knew when they came out with these 10 years ago. This is a interim thing Because eventually everybody who has a VHS tape is going to, is going to burn it up. So see, that side has a VHS player. I mean, if you need a VHS tape player and then that side has a DVD player, so we'll do both duty, but it would also record. I believe it will record and that's the. Yeah, this does the recording, recording, which is kind of nice. That's why they made this.\n\nAnd now for the video, that that work if it's a VHS tape, but if it's a high eight, now you get to get a camera that will record high eight and play it back from the camera into the computer using the Elgato. And then, if it's film, then you got to get a projector, a super eight or eight millimeter projector, and project it on a screen and then use your camera to capture the video on the screen. They even make little boxes that are basically it's the same thing. You put a camera watching the screen backwards. You have a machine, you know, film player playing into the.\n\nIt's a, it's a crazy Rube Goldberg thing, and you're going to buy these things and you're going to use them once and that's that. I send it to Scan Cafe or somebody like them. They'll take good care of it. Since you're an ocean side, the LA area has a lot of companies that will do this locally, and that's good because then you don't have to mail your tapes, you could just carry it in to them and honestly, that's going to be the best way to do it. You don't want to do this, I agree, but if you're retired you got nothing but time.\n\n0:46:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI got nothing.\n\n0:46:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou're going to need your family to you're going to need to, basically the concept. So you'll need three things. You'll need a thing to play it back, a thing to convert the thing that's being played back, which is analog, into bits and bytes, and then you'll need a computer that's connected to that converter to record. And now you have it on the hard drive. So analog player for whatever medium you have, digitizer that converts the bit, the analog signals, into bits, hooked up to a computer for editing and recording. That's conceptually what you need. The problem is you there's all these different analog type players depending on what your medium Exactly.\n\nYeah, lots of fun. Yeah, have fun, cherry, you should do it. You know I have a box in my office of old VHS tapes, old DVDs, old little hi eight. Do you remember those little hi eight video cameras, so cute, got a lot of that stuff and I know my kids are on there. And the question is how much do I want videos of my kids? You do a lot. That's how much I guess I have a few of when they were really little that I took on a really digital camera.\n\n0:47:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI've had a few. All right, I'll send it in, all right.\n\n0:47:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right. Some of them are like the old TV shows. I did, you know on the screensavers and call for help. Abby and Henry, when they were little like eight or nine or younger. Even Henry's, born in 94. So he had been four. Abby was born in 92. So she would have been six Came in and they did a review of some silly things. Oh, that's adorable. It would be cute to have. All right, I'll dig it.\n\n0:47:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, cause I tell you what. There's one VHS tape that we would always play, um of me interacting with my grandpa and all this, and over time that VHS has lost its magnet.\n\n0:47:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh yeah, digitize it. Yeah, we had, uh, jennifer had a uh recording of her grandmother. Every Thanksgiving she would tell this story about a turkey. It was a cute little kind of poem story and she had on a cassette tape and that's the kind of thing you want to get digitized, cause then then you can make infinite copies and it'll last forever. That those tapes will not, the analog stuff will not, is that you yeah.\n\n0:48:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's the old call for help.\n\n0:48:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nShow they're showing in that scooter. It's found a GIF of the call for help show on tech TV. You know that was me doing what I'm doing right now. Nothing has changed. 25 years later, I'm on the horn. Uh, I probably could play that theme song if I could find it, cause, uh, I don't think anybody claims to the rights to that anymore, Do they?\n\n0:48:40 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe will be back after Leo finds his theme song.\n\n0:48:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet's take a break and then it's Dickie day. The giz fizz whiz, whatever he is.\n\n0:48:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOoh, that's all rhymed.\n\n0:48:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, it's on internet. Archive you ready? I'm ready. Call for help. Show on TV Is this it? You have to download it.\n\n0:49:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think Where's the download option? Oh, there it is.\n\n0:49:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nPing Torrent zip Wait if it's just a PNG.\n\n0:49:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think it's just a picture of windows for some reason oh, somebody found it, joe found it. Oh, you're so good Joe. This is actually kind of funny if you, if you listen to it oh, it's on YouTube. We had a good company do these theme songs. Oh no, this is all I'm talking about. Oh no, this is all. This is not the right one. This is like later this I don't like this one at all. I hated that one. I was so dopey. Made me dance. It was so dopey.\n\n0:50:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat was you scouting at the end.\n\n0:50:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, sorry it was not good. Where is it Call for help? Theme tech TV there's one with Chris Prillo, but it won't be the same one. Is this it? Yeah, go ahead, you could play this. Okay, here it is. That's it.\n\n0:50:27 - VO\n\nPeople can help me with my computer. Oh no, Ignition will be with you in four hours. You can upgrade for just $5,000. What?\n\n0:50:38 - VO\n\nUniversal studio config board should be set to ID 6. I need that in plain English. Help, lay on the floor and call for help. May I help you?\n\n0:50:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nIs that your voice? Yeah, and here's the set. Hey, how are you? Good to see you Welcome. This is it? Call for help from 19. How, I'm sorry. 2001.\n\n0:50:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYour voice is aged like fine wine. I mean, that's sincerely in good way. The stuff.\n\n0:51:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe computer industry doesn't want you.\n\n0:51:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWell, I'm talking higher. Yeah, you can you can empower geek. I think it's a little different. You said I'm glad you're here, we got a great show for you, a very special treat for people.\n\n0:51:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, this is TV who like to play music on their computers, whether I don't have a big mouth. I like to download MP3s. Make their own. Mp3s. Record them to CD. Do you? Remember those days. Dick D Bartolo is here. The Giz Wiz. Hello, Dickie D, Welcome Leo how you doing? You remember those days you were on call for help and the screen savers. Well, you were definitely on the screen savers.\n\n0:51:36 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nScreen savers, I think, is where when I started. You're bundled up, is it?\n\n0:51:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nfreezing in Giznyland. Did you forget to? Pay the heat. Yeah, there you go. Hey, happy Christmas, dickie D.\n\n0:51:51 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nWe're the same to you guys. We got a very nice oh my mustache.\n\n0:51:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, I love that necklace. Is it lighting?\n\n0:51:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nup. Oh yeah, of course.\n\n0:51:59 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nI was going by the Rockefeller tree and I thought there's so many lights they're not going to miss it.\n\n0:52:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd then you're right, they don't. And what is the hat?\n\n0:52:08 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThe hat is something I'm going to talk about because I already sent a bunch of these out as Christmas gifts. So we've done a hat with speakers in it. We've done a hat with an LED. I found the hat with both speakers and the LED light and a microphone so you can take your phone call and you can. I like the fact that you can pop the LED out and if you have an emergency you can use it as a flashlight Nice. You're basically a walking toolbox.\n\nYou slide that off and you charge the LED separately and it's a little like getting it into a computer or and it is inexpensive For some reason. Ray, I bought this one. Gray was $13 and Navy and Black were, I think, 16 bucks. Wow, this is cool and I checked on Amazon earlier and you can get them in a day or two.\n\n0:53:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo if you want a cookie, Not too late for a last minute Christmas gift. No, no or Hanukkah.\n\n0:53:21 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYou might even make it before.\n\n0:53:22 - Leo Laporte\n\nHanukkah is over, wow.\n\n0:53:25 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nWe missed that, wasn't it yesterday.\n\n0:53:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, maybe. Yeah, you're right, it might have been yesterday.\n\n0:53:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah.\n\n0:53:32 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYou know, yesterday I was wearing candles and I thought you know, yeah, a menorah hat. This seems dangerous Wow.\n\n0:53:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is really cool. I like this. I'm going to go buy a dozen of them. So how's the sound quality?\n\n0:53:47 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThe sound quality is fine. I mean, you know, if you've been listening to earbuds you're going to be disappointed, but it's better than the transistor radio. Okay, okay, no, it's pretty decent for opening. And then I thought I'd find something that Mikah would like.\n\n0:54:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo I mean, I liked this, this is cool.\n\n0:54:09 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nOh, this is good. Okay, well then I also have the flashing orb, oh, the LED orb, and I have so much junk on my desk here now.\n\n0:54:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nCan't even find it, can't eat. It's there somewhere. I have to turn it on it's on my website.\n\n0:54:25 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nI love it. I love it.\n\n0:54:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou can't find it, you should see. By the way, if you've ever get a chance to go to Disneyland, you should see it. It's amazing.\n\n0:54:35 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo is the name the tick duck flying orb a ball Well yes, well, the Bluetooth beanie is the mox to you.\n\n0:54:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nBluetooth beanie. These are random names these are random, random names.\n\n0:54:49 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't see the orb on Gizwizda. I clicked on. Ask the tech guys on the side.\n\n0:54:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, I'm looking at the front page, that's yeah, and then.\n\n0:54:59 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nSo this thing I learned one of the tricks. First of all, every review I read said amazing, If you practice, practice, practice.\n\n0:55:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat means it's hard. It doesn't work very well.\n\n0:55:15 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThis is a little practicing.\n\n0:55:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's cool. Thank you, Dennis.\n\n0:55:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nI came downstairs and searched through the pile.\n\n0:55:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nFound it. Dennis was practicing with it. Yeah, maybe that was it.\n\n0:55:25 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYes, exactly, but I love, I love like use it as a boomerang, throw it at a 15 degree angle.\n\n0:55:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWell, let me get my protractor.\n\n0:55:35 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYes, yes, exactly, exactly. But the good thing about it is it can crash into things and not break, because I think I had it hit pretty much everything at Disney, but it's great fun, so it's kind of like a little bit more expensive. Yes, there it is 3299 on Amazon. Yeah, but you know what, if you go to that Amazon page and scroll all the way to the bottom, it looks like they're all the same photo and they range anywhere from about $26 up to 36.\n\n0:56:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, that's hysterical because it's basically the same company.\n\n0:56:17 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nIt probably is. Everybody went to China and now.\n\n0:56:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm going to go to your GizWiz video, which is on YouTube, on the GizWiz channel, because I want to see you fly in this thing. Are you going to fly? Okay Is it.\n\n0:56:30 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nI did, and there's also a link on my website where you're on the page. You were just there.\n\n0:56:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's the orb, let's see. Let's see. All right, there you are. You're pressing the up button. Okay, there we go. Yeah, that side up. Oh, this would be great for airports. You could really confuse planes. I don't do that. Don't do that. It's probably illegal. Yeah, all right.\n\n0:56:55 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThrow it dick. Nice, I know I'm scrolling a little more Are you going to throw it.\n\n0:56:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nLet's see, let's see, I threw it and it hit the motor.\n\n0:57:04 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThe motor shuts off.\n\n0:57:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf it hits something, yeah, this is one trick I learned is start it.\n\n0:57:10 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nStart it, then hold it slightly above your. Oh, it's floating. Follow your palms, your magic. Suddenly, you will lose.\n\n0:57:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt rolls down the hall and it's just. It looks like emergency services have arrived.\n\n0:57:28 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nIt automatically shuts itself off if it hits anything.\n\n0:57:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI want to throw it out of.\n\n0:57:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's great. So there are, in theory, ways to make it do more than just this.\n\n0:57:39 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThere are a lot you can make it into a boomerang.\n\n0:57:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf you throw it at 15 degrees, the reviews are great.\n\n0:57:45 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nBut all every review says you have to practice a lot to get it to do the things that Did you do your did you do your practice.\n\n0:57:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYour daily practice 15 minutes a day.\n\n0:57:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nDid you dick? Did you practice your tic-tac today?\n\n0:57:59 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nGee mom, I forgot to practice the tic-tac I forgot to practice.\n\n0:58:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh Well, you have a tic-tac solo coming up at school, so you better practice.\n\n0:58:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's your instrument. Little dickie, it's a tic-tac. I'm flying orb, uh-huh. If you go to gizwizbiz gizwizbiz, that sticks website you will see, of course, the link. We're talking about the gizwiz. Visit the tech guys and you can see those both the mox to you Bluetooth beanie and the tic-tac flying orb. No mox to you, no mox to you. But if you also go there, you can click a link called what the heck is it, and I think you're are you going to end in December 31st?\n\n0:58:46 - Caller\n\nI think we don't have a lot longer.\n\n0:58:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis one's almost done. Yeah, like two weeks. Oh, I mean, this is obvious. This is what they put your kidney in when they're bringing it for transplants.\n\n0:58:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh yeah, yeah, If you have a tiny kidney, really, really tiny, tiny kidney.\n\n0:59:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a, it's a transportation device for transplants organs yeah. Yeah, it's a doll transplant. So if you're playing doctor with your dollies, there you go.\n\n0:59:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhen you rip your arms Transplant me Barbie.\n\n0:59:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, transplant me. Barbie is big, yeah, yeah, oh, look what we're playing for. Ooh, this is the February, january, february Issue of Mad Magazine. You're mad here? Oh, I get it, get it. Well, good, good, mike. And what is? What is Dick's article in here? Cause he's got one every.\n\n0:59:37 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nI have two things in there. My favorite is a quickie. It's toward the end. Consumer, believe it or nuts.\n\n0:59:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd do people remember Ripley's believe it or not anymore? Probably not Probably not.\n\n0:59:52 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThat's probably in the chat room they will.\n\n0:59:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, Cause they're old farts. I mean yes.\n\n0:59:57 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nThings that happen you can't believe, and these are consumer, believe it or not. Yale Tuvster, a college student, bought a computer to help with the school work. When he got home he opened the box and every cable, every connector and even the manual were in the box.\n\n1:00:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nI can't believe it. Believe it or not, you know what I remember reading this. When I was a kid, this has been. That was an ongoing segment, wasn't it?\n\n1:00:28 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYes, I love it it was. My other favorite is Mabel duck went to the supermarket with a bunch of money saving coupons.\n\n1:00:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe supermarket had every item in the exact size and she was able to redeem every coupon or Eleanor Pomeranian of Cuthbert City, new Jersey, who bought a cordless phone that provided static, free, crystal clear reception in every room in her home. Believe it or not, that is very, very cute. Oh, I've you know what? Dix had a piece in every Mad Magazine for more than 50 years, right?\n\n1:01:12 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYeah, like 53 years, something like that.\n\n1:01:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo one has. That will be called Guinness, because that record is never going to. That's the once, that's, and you can be a part of history for a year 53. If you get this Mad Magazine, you could of course buy it for 5.99 and the newsstand is cheap, or you have to subscribe. You can't even buy it anymore.\n\n1:01:34 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYou have to subscribe.\n\n1:01:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, no, a bunch of noble sells all the specials but not the and there is a spy versus spy special coming out which would be well, that'll be a bunch of that'll be.\n\nI gave once. I gave Henry a Mad Magazine omnibus that I think was like it was maybe all of them. It was huge. They never made that, but I but it was and he loved it. He loved that was when he was little, he loved it. So go to gizwizbiz, click the what the heck is it? Contest. How do you win this Mad Magazine?\n\n1:02:06 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nWell, that's the one they're playing. That's, that is the one they're playing for.\n\n1:02:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, when you're playing for, there's 18, and they're autographed too.

I'm going to play with my hat and this is what happens. It gets very excited, wow.\n\n1:03:28 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nYou know you should get a mouse trap and you can get rid of all the guys.\n\n1:03:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's something in here. I don't know what it is. Every year, Burke has to change the battery. That's all I know.\n\n1:03:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd by that he means take the old mouse out and put a new mouse out. Well, you know.\n\n1:03:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nThank you, Dick.\n\n1:03:42 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nOkay, bye, Merry Christmas bud.\n\n1:03:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nTake care, bye-bye. Burlives Estate is going to sue us for this, but that's okay, let's get another call, or what do you?\n\n1:03:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nsay what do you say? What do you say? All right, let's pick up on Wes, wes.\n\n1:03:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nHe's got his hand up. Quest Very patient. Fella Wes, come on down. Did I not do the right thing? I see Wes Pressing, pressing. Maybe my buttons don't work. It turned it red but I can't. That doesn't seem to send him to the breakout room.\n\n1:04:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYep Wes is moving. Wes is on the move, he's on the move Just like my mouse Wes.\n\n1:04:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhere's where you calling from the FW. Oh nice, dallas, fort Worth, area, where the West begins, where the West begins. They call it Fort Worth where the West begins, don't they?\n\n1:04:43 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSure, I just where the West begins. Where the West begins, you said. You called a week ago.\n\n1:04:49 - Leo Laporte1\n\nA few weeks ago, I asked you about a studio display for my wife.\n\n1:04:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, I wasn't here for that. How did it?\n\n1:04:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes.\n\n1:04:57 - Leo Laporte1\n\nHow did it go?\n\n1:04:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAre we happy or are you?\n\n1:04:59 - Leo Laporte1\n\nsad. I'm calling you from it right now.\n\n1:05:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd you know what? That's a great picture. It's a good camera, sounds good. I'm impressed. Where's your wife?\n\n1:05:09 - Leo Laporte1\n\nIt was an early Christmas present for her office, so she likes a lot.\n\n1:05:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nGood, Good, I'm so glad to hear that. Yeah, we talked about, you know you had mentioned that you were thinking about the studio display, but you were, you know, perhaps looking at other options and basically because she wanted this all in one device right that had the speakers in it, that had the webcam, that had the microphone, to make it as simple as possible, ended up settling on that being the best option, even if many of the tech reviewers out there when the thing first launched kind of panned it as not being good. You know what I think I better buy this for my wife.\n\n1:05:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nShe has at home, she has standalone monitors and she I gave her a fancy audience set up so that she plugs. You know she has a high LP or 40 and it never works. Yeah, that's true.\n\nEvery time we're trying to have a call it never works and she says this is why I want an iMac, but this is better than iMac, cause she can use her Mac studio. She's all right, I'm going to order one right now. I was too late for Christmas. She's been. She's been bugging me, so Wes you recommend it, she does.\n\n1:06:16 - Leo Laporte1\n\nSo if the wife is happy, there's a lot of designs on her iPad and she actually likes that she's able to zoom in and see a blown up on a much larger screen and colors are accurate and everything's.\n\n1:06:26 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, that was the other reason. Thank you for the reminder. That was the other reason we decided to go with that is because we knew that the color matching between an iPad and this studio display would be the same and that there wouldn't be a bunch of extra work whenever you were trying to share between the two devices. I'm really glad to hear that Now it looks like I at least see a printer back there and then what might be what? A photo printer or some sort of vinyl cutter. I'm kind of curious is your wife a crafter?\n\n1:06:53 - Leo Laporte1\n\nOh, it's a Cree cut. She has a Nazi store.\n\n1:06:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nAh, oh, and she uses a telescope to look for.\n\n1:07:03 - Leo Laporte1\n\nThat is a cool Telescope yeah.\n\n1:07:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nOK, what's she selling her Etsy store?\n\n1:07:11 - Leo Laporte1\n\nShe has a design she does. It's called nerdy science stuff. I'm going to wait a minute.\n\n1:07:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow we need to know. We need to know more. You just said the right words.\n\n1:07:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNerdy science stuff.\n\n1:07:22 - Leo Laporte\n\nIs that the name of the store Right Nice?\n\n1:07:25 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAll right, let's see. I need to find a store called nerdy science stuff.\n\n1:07:32 - Leo Laporte1\n\nWe're still working on it. We're trying to attack all the different STEM fields. Aren't?\n\n1:07:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou nice. We are you a scientist or she is scientist.\n\n1:07:42 - Leo Laporte1\n\nShe's a laboratory scientist and microbiologist.\n\n1:07:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNice, oh, my goodness, yeah, there it is. Dallas, Texas. Yes, for science nerds, oh, wow, how cool. Oh, mugs and and teas, and she hand draws all the designs. That's so cool. Oh, socks, now you're. Now you're talking.\n\n1:08:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nIs it nerdy science stuff? Is that the name of the store? If?\n\n1:08:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nyou go to Etsycom slash shop, slash nerdy science stuff all one word You'll be able to find it. I have markets.\n\n1:08:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm going to change that for shop, because I think that's a search Otherwise.\n\n1:08:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNow, I did post it in the discord, if you just want to click the link there.\n\n1:08:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, I'm going to do it myself, because I am. You do it. I'm going to do it yourself, you're a go getter, I'm a go getter.\n\n1:08:27 - Mikah Sargent\n\nPharmacology, microbiology, oh hearts, oh, the mugs are so cool.\n\n1:08:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, and I like the ones that says immune system, that is great. Hey well, west, that's wonderful. And congratulations on having a nerdy science wife.\n\n1:08:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, so cool, that's really neat, yeah, and thank you for following up.\n\n1:08:51 - Leo Laporte1\n\nI also want to say Scott Wilkinson mentioned last week that he wished there was a place he could find all the different shows and where to view them.\n\n1:08:59 - Caller\n\nYeah.\n\n1:08:59 - Leo Laporte1\n\nThere is an app called Just Watch, if you guys aren't aware of it.\n\n1:09:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, we someone actually ended up calling in to suggest that that day and we found Just Watch and we found another one. I can't remember what the other app was at this point, but we set it on Just Watch because it also has that Apple TV app that has all the links in it. So, yeah, for anyone who might have missed that, just Watch is a great app that lets you basically type in the title of a show, a movie, whatever it happens to be, and it'll display the different places where you can watch that content, and so that could be via Amazon Prime or on Netflix or wherever it happens to be. It shows you all the different ways you want to watch it.\n\n1:09:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe were talking about it on MacBreak Weekly also. Jason Snell had a recommendation. I think he liked Just Watch. Channels I think was Well Channels he also liked it. That was a different thing. Yeah, yeah, I think Just Watch is very good. Thanks for the recommendation. We'll send that along to Scott too. Oh, I had a couple of questions. Oh boy, this is a bonus round. Go ahead. Yes.\n\n1:10:04 - Leo Laporte1\n\nWell, you guys have mentioned several times about the issues with connecting to public Wi-Fi and wondering how much of an I guess I should say. When is it an issue? Is it just merely connecting to it that becomes an issue, or is it actually a password to log into something?\n\n1:10:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nGenerally, nowadays you're pretty safe because of Google's push for HTTPS everywhere. Almost every site you go to is encrypted and secure, and you can tell because it'll say it's HTTPS and there'll be a closed padlock. So that means that nobody else on the network can see your traffic, which is gonna protect you in that regard. So you can't go to a network that's not a password as long as you're on a site like that, or credit card numbers, and pretty much all the email sites do that, all the shopping sites do that, all the banks do that. There are very few sites now. Even our site is HTTPS. It doesn't need to be. You're not giving us any information, but at the same time, google pushes that and they say you search results will be better if you do that. So we do it. So I think that that part of it you don't have to worry about this.\n\nThere is a larger risk, though, that there's a network that other people can be on. So that's a coffee shop or hotel or cruise ship. It's open Wi-Fi at the airport, because you're on the same network as somebody else. If there is a malicious person on the network, too, there are tools they can use like there's a thing called the Wi-Fi pineapple to attack you. One common attack is to find somebody else on the network on the Wi-Fi pineapple to see what other Wi-Fi access points they have saved and been on. There's a way to find that out and they will look for one that looks like your house you know Wes's house and then they will impersonate it. Now your laptop is gonna say, hey, we're home. It's gonna say, forget the airport Wi-Fi, we're home and we'll join this impersonator as your home network. If the bad guy's really smart, he's passing the network through his machine, the internet through his machine, to your machine. So you may not even know that. The only way you'd know is if you looked at your Wi-Fi and you said well, we're not home, why am I on my own Wi-Fi at home? But once you're on that same Wi-Fi, now you're really at risk because there's other things they can do. They can't watch your traffic. So I think it's a minor risk.\n\nIt would require a bad actor with a hardware tool. These are widely available, but a hardware tool to do that, you know. That's why a VPN is often the right thing to do. You're protecting yourself if you're using a VPN, as with everything, when you're more secure, it's more inconvenient. It slows down your system a little bit. It's more inconvenient so it depends on what we call your threat model. How much of a risk is it for you and how much risk can you tolerate? If you're really worried, use a VPN. That'll solve the problem.\n\n1:13:07 - Leo Laporte1\n\nDoes Apple's private relay help with this?\n\n1:13:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, absolutely Not quite as much as a VPN. It's not a VPN.\n\n1:13:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah it's more about keeping you from being tracked than it is about completely obscuring what you're doing.\n\n1:13:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut many. But you know there are VPNs everywhere. We have a sponsor, which is a very good one if you wanna pay for a VPN, but there are also VPNs out there in a variety. You know, like your Google phones now have VPNs built in, there's your various VPNs out there that you can use with the hardware that you have, so check that out. I like ExpressVPN. That's another one that you can use. That's our sponsor.\n\n1:13:44 - Leo Laporte1\n\nYou know there's an interesting. I have a question.\n\n1:13:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n1:13:47 - Leo Laporte1\n\nOh sorry, this is in regard to iTunes, sure, so I'm usually pretty far behind on catching up with shows and movies, so I tend to buy them on sale and kind of take my time.\n\n1:13:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, smart, it's $20 to rent Taylor Swift's Euras movie. I don't wanna pay $20 for a rental. I'll wait, I'll wait.\n\n1:14:06 - Leo Laporte1\n\nSo you hear that you know they can remove those at any time and I want to say downloading them and storing them and see what methods you guys recommend, and if there's any way to link that to an Apple TV for offline viewing, that is an interesting question.\n\n1:14:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo when it comes to something that you have straight up purchased, I don't know that I've ever run into an issue where I've full on purchased something and then had it taken away. It's only with the subscription services where I've been streaming something and then it was taken away. What you know in terms of the content that I have. A lot of times I actually have it turned off to store those copies locally because it just takes up space that I'm not using. But you might turn that off. So in on your Mac you have the settings in the storage settings to actually say no, don't automatically delete this TV show or this movie after I've downloaded it to my device.\n\nAs far as on the Apple TV, that's a little bit more complicated because the way that the Apple TV works is the highest quality version is not a downloadable version.\n\nYou'll notice that if you want to watch a 4K Dolby video don't excuse me, dolby Atmos version of a show or a movie, there's the option to play it. There's not that little cloud button next to it that you can click to download the whole thing and watch it later, and that is an annoying thing where Apple is trying to make things the experience easier for you by making sure that it's not taking up all of the space on your Apple TV, but also that it is something that you can start watching now if you're wanting to watch it. That's unfortunate, but yeah, I don't know, leo, I have. I don't know if you've had this experience. I've never had something where if I full on just said I want this thing and I'm purchasing it, that if the deals changed later then I no longer had access to it. It's only been with streaming services where that's kind of the agreement going in.\n\n1:16:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou know, we hear stories from time to time about companies pulling stuff Usually it's books and other things but it happens. I bought a movie I really loved from Apple and I got it home, so to speak, and it was missing a major scene that I remember vividly because I guess in the later versions they decided the scene was too sexy. Probably Apple decided that. But yeah, I didn't get the full movie, wow. So I think this happens, and if you look at the license agreement, you're not buying these movies, you don't own them. So it is something to be aware of. I don't think it happens all that often. I still buy movies. You know, I'm like you too, wes. I wait for the 99 cent sales or 4.99 sales, and you can often get great movies cheap. But I wouldn't worry about it. The convenience outweighs it, I guess, if you really want to make sure you never lose it by the DVD or the UHD Blu-ray disc, yeah, and then you'll never lose it. That's the argument for physical.\n\nIs that you do in fact own it at that point. I mean, we live in a world now, you know, even with a UHD player, they could technically revoke the license of the UHD player to play DVDs and UHDs. That's true. So we live in a world now where you're all kind of dependent on everybody else and their goodwill. I bought I just bought my wife a studio display. You saw that. Good for you, because that's going to be a holiday gift under the tree. But don't tell her. Yeah, I shouldn't have said that. But, wes, you gave me a good idea. Thank you, yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. I buy stuff. I buy Kindle books, I buy iTunes, tv and movies and you know, sometimes it does make me worried. When I bought the entire office license you know that was, I don't know, it was expensive, it was 100 bucks or something, and it was every episode of the office. But I knew I wouldn't want that. But I don't want it for now, I want it for 10 years.\n\n1:18:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhenever I can't find it playing anywhere online, that's still available to me, although I do find myself just watching it on Peacock, even though I own it.\n\n1:18:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe last thing you know. I've told the story before about my good friend who taped every episode of Cheers and had it in his closet on VHS tapes and of course now it's a waste of time. It's better quality on Netflix. You can watch it for free, so you know times change, I wouldn't worry about it, wes.\n\n1:18:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, if it's something that you absolutely want to make sure you get to see later. You know, maybe you prioritize, you say, okay, this is something that I need to have and I will have physical versions of it so that I know that it never goes away.\n\n1:18:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nI do think it's going to happen more often, because we're already seeing stuff pulled off of HBO Max or taken from Max and put in a Netflix. These guys are messing around, we're in these very you know, everything's upside down these days, and because we transitioned to digital and I think that stuff will start to disappear more often, unfortunately.\n\n1:19:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, but again, in those cases it's like I did not. I paid for HBO Max's subscription service and that is with the agreement that content is going to change on it, Versus me seeking out a specific title, buying it and then having it taken away.\n\n1:19:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's really annoying, but it does happen. Hey, thanks, wes. Happy holidays to you.\n\n1:19:29 - Leo Laporte1\n\nAnd the One last thing, oh my kids want to tell you something, oh well, Hello kids.\n\n1:19:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh Aren't they sweet. What are their names? I'm Elena Hi. Elena, hi Eric, what's your name? Aldrick. Aldrick and.\n\n1:19:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nElena, Hello both of you.\n\n1:19:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat do you want to say?\n\n1:19:55 - Caller\n\nI want to be world famous. I'm so.\n\n1:19:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nAlready happened.\n\n1:19:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou are famous. Now You're on the show.\n\n1:20:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou're internet famous. I'll be at the panel, you're gonna play it's also yeah, happy holidays.\n\n1:20:11 - Caller\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays.\n\n1:20:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHappy holidays to you. Thank you guys. Thank you so much.\n\n1:20:16 - Caller\n\nMerry Christmas Happy holidays Leaves you lots of when are you?\n\n1:20:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhere are we Far, far away in Christmas land.\n\n1:20:26 - Caller\n\nAre you serious?\n\n1:20:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, we're in California.\n\n1:20:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe're in California, where it's very warm and there's no snow.\n\n1:20:32 - Leo Laporte1\n\nOh, I was about to question if you were in Santa or in the the North.\n\n1:20:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nPole. Well, if I weren't, could I do this.\n\n1:20:42 - Caller\n\nI've been so 2004.\n\n1:20:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat it's been a long time. I know, Kids, we'll be right back with more of as the Tech Eyes Just a little bit Bye-bye.\n\n1:20:53 - Dick DeBartolo\n\nOh, that was really sweet.\n\n1:21:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat was amazing. That's really amazing. I like how it jiggles in here Christmas this year. Oh, it's lighting up too. I didn't even notice that Boy. That hat is the gift that keeps on giving. I've had that for a year.\n\nYou know, I was reading on Reddit. There was an interesting story. We were talking about hacking on the open networks. It was an interesting story on Reddit. He says I was at a Christmas party the other day and three quarters of the people's iPhones crashed. What could possibly be going on? And it's an interesting story. There was a hack that you could do. Remember I had the Flipper Zero. In fact, I gave it to Father Robert, which is probably a mistake. I should have said was there a priest there? But the Flipper Zero had an exploit that you could crash iPhones using Bluetooth. Apple has patched it in 17.2. But somebody did it at this time, somebody did it at this Christmas party. Somebody had in their pocket one of these little hacking devices. And that's the thing these devices are cheap, they're not illegal because they're used, you know, for testing purposes. So Apple, with its release of iOS 17.2, made that impossible. But that party.\n\n1:22:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd see, that's. The other thing that we have to be mindful of is that these devices that we have are a lot chatter than you might think at first glance.\n\n1:22:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, they're constantly talking.\n\n1:22:25 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey're talking all the time to other things and sometimes another thing shouts at them and makes them scared and then they die.\n\n1:22:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it was a Bluetooth exploit and in fact I think Father Robert actually put it into the Flipper Zero because he said I'm gonna bring you back your Flipper Zero with some extra new features. And this was an extra new feature. It can be modified with third party firmware. There was a particular firmware called Xtreme that did a Bluetooth low energy spam attack that brought within 50 meters, that's 164 feet. You can use a Flipper Zero, this little device, to crash iPhones and I think that must have happened at that party.\n\n1:23:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt spams it with Bluetooth.\n\n1:23:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt causes it to oh wow, yeah, apple's fixed it Good news. This is one reason why you always want to do your updates. All right, it is half past the hour, roughly Coming up in 20 minutes. I did a do a break. In 20 minutes we're gonna talk with Chris Mark-Wart. Yes, we are His assignment update, review and update. Meanwhile, you can call us 888-724-2884 or zoomuscalltwittv. You know I feel so guilty about this stack of emails. There are quite a few emails. I feel like we should work our way through a few of them here.\n\n1:23:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet's do it. Let's do it.\n\n1:23:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right, these are all carefully vetted by our crack team. The boy wonder himself oh, leica. Leica writes. I wonder if Leica's an LA from LA should be a LA, leica An LA.\n\nI have been using Fast Mail our sponsor for six months now. I just can't seem to get the program that's a problem right there to open in mail. It only opens in the migration section and it's a click on the back to mail tab. How or what do I have to do to get Fast Mail to open in the mail section where I can check my inbox? Thanks for all the help you both provide.\n\nI've been a fan of Leo since 2005. Give up, keep up the good work. I almost thought it said give up the good work because he's or Leica's missed that we recommended Fast Mail. So this is the problem with. I feel like this is the problem with Gmail and others. They're so easy to use. You just go to a website. You don't have to configure it, you don't have to do anything to it. It just works out of the box and it's one of the reasons people use free email. If you're going to use a non-free email server, you have to configure oh, that awful word your email in your email client Looks like Leica's using Apple Mail, because they said mail. But if you want, you can just do fastmailcom, log in and use their web mail interface. It will be just like Gmail. So there's your inbox right there. If you do want to keep using Apple Mail, you have to now go into the settings for Apple Mail and configure it.\n\nWhat I'm going to suggest you do is go to Fast Mail's help pages. They have a very good page on setting up Apple email or whatever mail program you're doing. They actually have a page for almost for Outlook and for everyone. But if you go to fastmailhelp, here's the page Automatic Setup on a Mac. They'll also have it for iOS devices, they'll have it for Outlook and so forth. So you're going to need to go there and you're going to need to follow their setup guide and reconfigure your email to use to work now with the server at Fast Mail. So you're going to a server to download your email.\n\nNow it sounds like you also want to keep your other email account working, and there are a couple of ways to do that. You can set it up to automatically. If it's Gmail, for instance, gmail will automatically forward to another address Every time something comes into your Gmail, you can have it be sent to your Fast Mail address. Fast Mail can go out and get your email from Gmail. You can actually connect it to Gmail that's what I do and automatically download all your Gmail. So that's an additional setup. But again, fastmailhelp has a lot of pages. They've done a really good job and they also have support. This is one of the real advantages of Fast Mail. You don't have to suffer for six months. There's actual people at the other end of the support, so they will help you get it working. I hope you do, but this is a little confusion over how email works. It requires that you connect to that Fast Mail server. It's a new server for your client. Well done. Automated setup on the Mac Another one.\n\nCan I do another one? Let's do another one. 2fa apps asks Kent Hi Leo and Mikah Hi Mikah and Leo. Which free two-factor authentication app do you recommend? I'd like to use one that has the most pushability. Oh, he wants to use that tap or click on allow instead of typing a code. That's called single sign on or SSO. I'm aware of Google Authenticator, dual Mobile Authy and LastPass, and I use LastPass as my password manager. Yeah, it does make sense, kent, he says. I hope this makes sense.\n\nSo generally, authenticators work by providing you a six-digit code. That is your second factor, besides your password. It's a second, almost second, password that you need to get into a system. We recommend turning on two-factor everywhere you can, certainly with the important accounts, like your bank, your email, your credit cards, things like that.\n\nNow, two-factor sometimes just comes in as a text message. Banks often do that because they don't have to explain how to set up a two-factor app for their customers and they don't want to spend any extra money on support that they don't have to. So that's not the most reliable way to do it. I'll tell you which two-factor app I use, but this is a separate thing from Single Sign-On, right? So, if you know, depends on what you're doing. Single Sign-On with Microsoft's free authenticator does the two-factor, the six-digit thing, but will also do Single Sign-On with Microsoft products, which I find really great. You don't need a password for Microsoft products, but that's kind of a separate thing from Two-Factor. My favorite two-factor app is Two-F-A-S, two-f-a-s and of course, I guess it doesn't like it that I'm wearing a Santa hat Jolly jolly hat.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna log in with the pin. So and you can see this. By the way, one of the let me explain how this works is TOTP time one-time, time-based, one-time passwords Every 30 seconds. These six-digit codes update Every 30 seconds. You see there's a timer on the right there that says how many seconds until the update. That's because these six-digit numbers come from a mishap mashup, mushmash of the time of day and a secret number that you get that's what that QR code is when you sign up for Two-Factor is a secret, long, secret number that the company, whatever it is, gives you, and so when they do that mashup, they know the long number, they know what time of day it is, they know what that six-digit code should be, roughly, because clocks differ. So I can show you these, because they're gonna change every 30 seconds. It's not gonna give you any help. Two-fas is free.\n\nThe reason I like it kind of like Authy is it will. You can use it on multiple devices and when you get a new device you don't have to go through the whole process again. But instead of saving it as Authy does on their servers, you can upload to iCloud or Google Drive and encrypted blob of your secrets. That's the thing that needs to be preserved. So it's very easy. As you might know, I'm always trying new phones, so it's very easy for me to move from phone to phone, so that was important to me. I also like how it presents itself. I think it looks good. I used to use the Authy and I've changed from it, but that and I think it supports single sign-on, but that's gonna depend on. Authy, for instance, supports it with because it's made by Twilio, with companies that use Twilio authentication. Microsoft supports it with Microsoft products.\n\n1:30:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, oftentimes the services that do it Adobe, for example, you have to use it with the Adobe app itself, so there'll be an app that has two factor but also lets you do it. Yeah, and I'm trying to think of Duo.\n\n1:31:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nhe already knows about Duo, that's another one.\n\n1:31:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSteam is another one that has its own.\n\n1:31:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah. So Duo is a good example, but it has to be. A company has to use Duo for its single sign-on and then you won't need to do the six digit two factor. That's the fallback. But something like 2FAS is really designed for two factor, not single sign-on. So there you go. You might end up having several apps on there. Frankly, if you wanna do single sign, passkeys support yep. And, by the way, everybody now is starting to support that, not only your phone, but I noticed that both are sponsored by Bithwarden and OnePassword now supporting Passkeys, which is great, and that may end up being the future of passwords.\n\nI like two factor, me too. I want two factor, and you want two factor, trust me, you do. All right, I think that's enough email, let's take a call. Another break, you're just full of them today. We'll be right back with a call right after this. I've done three now. I know I have one more to do, but yeah, okay, I was gonna do it right before, chris, but I guess, yeah, that makes sense. All right, who do we take, mr Boy Wonder?\n\n1:32:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJeremy, You're not gonna let me live that down. No, let's do Bonnie Bonnie a phone call.\n\n1:32:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nI see Bonnie and I see Jeremy, and I see Joey and I see Henry and I see Jeffrey and I see James Sounds like a book, and I see Neil. Did you ever do a romper room when you were a kid? No, that's why you don't know what I'm doing. Hello Bonnie, what's?\n\n1:32:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nyour name Star six Bonnie Press star six to unmute.\n\n1:32:53 - Caller\n\nOh, oh yeah, I hear you.\n\n1:32:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe keep calling you Bonnie, but you're not Bonnie. You're using Bonnie's phone, that's your caller ID.\n\n1:33:01 - Caller\n\nNo, I'm using my phone, but yeah, it's better off. Is your name Bonnie?\n\n1:33:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nPaul Paul Well, your caller ID shows up as Bonnie. Hi, Paul, where are you calling from?\n\n1:33:15 - Caller\n\nI'm calling from San Diego, California.\n\n1:33:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nLovely. What can we do for you?\n\n1:33:22 - Caller\n\nI'm using an S10 and a fingerprint S10 phone and the battery is running. Yeah, cause it's pretty old, so I'm looking for replacement. I'm trying to mention Bonnie. Bonnie and all our family uses iPhones, so I have a coin board. I go with another Android and it's so which one I don't like the S10 experience with that little button on the side and always throwing stuff on the screen. That I don't like. I think it either a play. Android experience, or maybe moving to the iPhone.\n\n1:34:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, I mean, I agree, If you're going to get a Android phone, you should get a pixel Agreed, and I think the six A and the seven A is not out yet. So this, this is the seven. The seven A will come out mid year, Our excellent phones and I wouldn't get. I wouldn't get the seven pro because it's, you know, that's like 1,100 bucks, but I was absolutely not hesitate recommending getting a pixel six A and it'll be about three or 400 bucks, A lot less than an iPhone. So that's a pure Android experience. And, yes, I think I mean I like Samsung phones. I have the S23. I mean. But you know, if you don't, you know what the Samsung experience is like, and it is, it is Samsung dub. The Pixel phone is pure pure Google and I and I really like it I do think that there is an advantage to going all iPhone in your family as much as, as you know, Google would like not like me to say that We've been playing with this beeper program that lets you get Apple blue bubble messages out, and it's just not reliable.\n\nI was sending you a message. Half of your responses were coming through, half weren't. It hasn't updated with responses from my wife since Thursday. So it's not. It's beeper, this beeper mini thing, Don't. It's not a good solution. It's not an alternative. At some point I hope this year, in 2024, Apple will adopt RCS, the rich communications services, which will make it work fine with. You know, Android phones, but if your whole family is Apple, one of the reasons you might pick Apple is because you can ask Bonnie and others questions. You can say well, I don't know what's going on here. It's going to be a very different experience at first, Right? Have you talked to a lot of people who moved from Android to iPhone?\n\n1:36:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, that's a common thing that I hear and have questions about and you know, yes, it's going to take a minute to get locked in and to understand everything, but it's been my experience that everyone who's not, if you're, if you're super techie and you are just absolutely driven by all the customization that you can do on Android, then it's not as easy to make that shift. But if you're not, if you just are looking for a good phone that works reliably and is okay to be used, then in that case you it's been my experience, that it's been their experience that it's an easy shift from Android to iOS.\n\n1:36:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I mean it is a bigger shift than, say, from Mac to Windows. It's a. It's a lot different the way Android and iOS work, but you get used to it pretty quick.\n\n1:36:54 - Caller\n\nYeah, I think so. Does it play well with Windows?\n\n1:36:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhat do you need? What do you do with your Android phone, now that you would want to be able to do with your iPhone?\n\n1:37:07 - Caller\n\nI download and upload files to the phone directly.\n\n1:37:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, Well, oh so, no, so I somebody actually called in about this Windows has this phone link stuff.\n\n1:37:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that works with iPhones sort of, and I've used it with. I can use it with the iPhone, If I can use it right now with the iPhone, but it works better with it. It works best with a Samsung phone. So the experience you're having with are you using phone link? No, oh, I just use plug it in with a cable.\n\n1:37:39 - Caller\n\nJust plug it in with a cable.\n\n1:37:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, yeah, that will not work with an iPhone. You'll have to use Apple's software to do that. If that's something important to you, then I would get, and, by the way, I am one off. This is a pixel eight. I've been living in the past. It's the seven a that I would recommend.\n\nAnd I think they do still sell the six a, but those, yeah, you know what? If you really like Android, stick with that and get a Google phone. The other reason they get a Google phone over the dominant platform, which is Samsung, is that Google updates the security updates faster. They do feature drops that they don't do anywhere else. I think you just get a better experience with the pixel phones and, frankly, they finally started to make pretty decent hardware. They went through a bad period, but I think, starting with a seven a, you'd be fine. So, and it's also going to cost us like a lot less right? Yeah, absolutely, if you don't mind being a green bubble.\n\n1:38:39 - Caller\n\nYeah, right. So now when someone says that, someone says they sent me something, I just go over to Bonnie's phone.\n\n1:38:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere you go. Just go over to Bonnie's phone.\n\n1:38:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nAre you on Bonnie's phone right now?\n\n1:38:55 - Caller\n\nWell, no, I don't understand that. I know why you.\n\n1:38:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nI know why it says Bonnie's name. Bonnie pays the phone bill. Yes, yes, so the phone company is identifying you as Bonnie. That's just your caller ID. Let me just look. I'm on the. I'm on the pixel store. They do sell the seven a. The six a is still available. That's two years old, but it's still a decent phone. And how much are they going to charge me for that? Let's get. Let's get it in. Oh, wait a minute. You would want it in green, wouldn't you? You like it in green. Michael likes everything in green green and 350 bucks.\n\nIf you get through AT&T, that's a pretty good price for a very nice phone. Okay, so you know, you know Android, you love Android, you do things with Windows that you can't really do easily with the iPhone. The iPhone and Windows don't get along quite as well. There is this on Windows. I think it's called it's on Windows 10 as well as called phone link. Yeah, and it's it's. I have to connect it to my phone.\n\n1:40:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere's an open source app that I recommend to everyone. I've talked about it before and we had someone call in and ask about it. It's called Land Drop. L? A? N drop dot app is the website Land Drop dot app and I have used this reliably with no issue between my blue suede Windows machine and my iPhone. It works across all different devices iOS, android, mac OS, windows and Li"
