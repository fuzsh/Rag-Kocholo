        "text": "So... I went 24 hours with no screens at all on The Global Day of Unplugging. WOW! I do my fair deal of international travel and I kind of figured that it wouldn't be much different then being locked in a steel tube with limited outside contact for 15 hours but it was very different. I went zero screens. So no computers, phones, tablets, televisions or smart watch. The awkwardness started the moment I woke up and instinctively reached for my phone to check the time. It was actually quite disorienting not knowing the time immediately and something I hadn't really anticipated. Also, not knowing how much time you were allocating to something took some adjusting. The first several hours were ROUGH! I worked out with no music. I found my mind incredibly distracted initially and wandering between sets. With no smart watch I finished the workout with no gamification or celebratory rings tracking calories burned. It felt kind of like making a winning shot in a basketball game but the arena was empty. The topic of resources came to my mind and how to properly rank them (Time, Information, Money). Suddenly without any prompting I broke into a full speech on the topic out loud. I liked some of the points so much I instinctively moved to my computer to type them up, then quickly realized that wasn't an option so had to reach for a pen and paper. I had really never considered how much faster I type than write. It was initially frustrating to have to slow my thoughts because I couldn't get them on paper fast enough but slowly I realized the longer process actually allowed me to interrogate my own thoughts and literally rethink them before memorializing them in notes. It was somehow less efficient and more productive! As the day progressed I actually began to like being disconnected. I found great freedom in knowing that I could set out to dedicate time to 60 minutes of reading and knowing it would happen with no distraction. Hilariously, I became acutely aware of how much other people used their devices even though I only put my own down for a day. Talking with my family I would see their eyes shifting to a device during any break in a discussion and taking in outside information. Suddenly the \"Breaking News\" interjections that are so common seemed completely out of place in the midst of a discussion. While discussing whether Coding was still a good thing to learn or rather we should leave that to AI someone in my family interjected that it was going to rain on the weekend after getting a notification on their phone. I realize that is how most discussions go today but with no notifications of my own pulling on me those kind of random updates seemed absurdly out of place. I recommend it. I'm going to more zero screen periods every week and a full no screen day once per month. Will keep you posted but maybe by letter :). #unplugged #noscreens #digitaldetox"
