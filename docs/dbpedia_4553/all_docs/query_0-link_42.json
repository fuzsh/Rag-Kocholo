        "text": "While this is a personal post and I don’t make it a habit to get on my personal soapbox on this blog, I think that the issues covered in the email are relevant to Serotek’s mission of providing and advocating for\n\n“Accessibility Anywhere.”\n\nBelow is a letter submitted to the IPad Today show on the Twit Netcast Network. It frustrates me that even so called “geeks” don’t understand how important accessibility is in both software and on the web. What do you think of this letter? Please post your comments so perhaps someone will read them and really know that accessibility isn’t just a law but that it really does allow us as a market to enjoy the same level of access to products and services that our sighted peers enjoy and take for granted.\n\nFrom:\n\nMike Calvo\n\nTo:\n\nipadtoday@twit.tv\n\nSubject:\n\nProgram 51 Advocates for Universal Design … for Once\n\nHello Leo and Sarah,\n\nI’ve been a long-time listener of The Twit Network and iPad today, and have\n\nalways been impressed with the insightful commentary you both consistently\n\nprovide on the show. I was very excited to hear your thoughts on HTML 5 on the\n\nshow which aired on June 23. As the CEO of an assistive technology company providing accessible cloud\n\nservices to the blind, I’m a staunch advocate of HTML 5. It allows for\n\nconsistent cross-platform design, and has the added benefit of being far more\n\naccessible than other design technologies such as Flash.\n\nI was all set to hear a well-thought-out\n\nand candid discussion of the benefits of HTML 5, so imagine my shock and\n\nsurprise when you began discussing the iPad experience for the new Harry\n\nPotter site. You first\n\nlamented the fact that the site displayed on the iPad was a text-only site, which lacked all the appealing features\n\nof the main site. Then, Sarah took things one step further and asked the\n\ndevelopers to: “consider the community with good vision for once!”\n\nReally? Seriously?\n\nSarah, have you ever been prevented from\n\nconducting legitimate business because of an inability to use a particular\n\nsite? Have you ever had to contact a site designer to explain that you wanted\n\nto purchase a business’s products and services but were prevented from doing so\n\nbecause of a flaw in web design? Have you ever overheard a friend or family\n\nmember discussing a particular site, only to realize you couldn’t enjoy that\n\nsite yourself, again, because of a flaw in web design? This is the struggle\n\nthat the blind community faces on a daily basis. When your entire audience of\n\nweb developers, business professionals, and blind and sighted consumers hear\n\nyou minimize this struggle with a few snide and ill-considered words, it is\n\nincredibly damaging. With this single statement, you’ve implied that\n\naccessibility may be a headache which some designers have to address, but only\n\nwhen it doesn’t detract from the experience of the mainstream audience or in\n\nyour words “those of us with good vision.” What you fail to\n\nunderstand is that the members of an audience who need accessibility don’t\n\nactually want separate but equal. We want the same bells and whistles that\n\neveryone else enjoys. Don’t get me wrong; I appreciate the consideration when a\n\nsite designer at least acknowledges the need for accessibility by providing a\n\ntext-only site. With that said, my primary goal is to educate developers that\n\naccessibility doesn’t have to be an afterthought, and can be incorporated quite\n\neasily without adversely impacting anyone else. In fact, when a developer\n\nchooses to use something like HTML 5 over something like Flash, everyone\n\nbenefits, including the sighted iPad users like yourself who want a more\n\ncompelling experience.\n\nAs well-respected tech enthusiasts,\n\nimagine how much you could do to further the education on web accessibility\n\njust by including information like this when you discuss platforms like HTML 5.\n\nConversely, consider just how damaging it can be when you make statements which\n\nencourage actions which further your own interests while minimizing those of\n\nanother population. Would you rather advocate for the continuation of a\n\nseparate but equal philosophy, or would you rather advocate for universal design,\n\n“for once?”\n\n—\n\nMike Calvo CEO\n\nSerotek Corporation\n\nPh: (612) 246-4818\n\nFax (612) 643-3483\n\nUnited Kingdom +44 2080-990685\n\naccessibility anywhere\n\nwww.serotek.com\n\n1128 Harmon Place\n\nSuite 310\n\nMinneapolis, MN 55403"
