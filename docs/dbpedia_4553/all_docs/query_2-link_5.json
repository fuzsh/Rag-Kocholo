Leo Laporte here, with not quite the last twit of the year I guess we'll have a best of for New Year's Eve, but the last live twit of the year and I, as we did last year, we've decided to do once again a reprise of the old farts holiday show, because there's nothing more festive than a fart. Hello, everybody, look at these festive people, the Jingle, jingle bells, the old folks who have been on twit for ever and ever. Like Jeff Jarvis over on my right there, he's falling asleep. Did you get a? He was in Vienna yesterday. Did you get a good night's sleep?\n\n01:49 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI actually did. I actually did, but it still doesn't. So I'm I'm tired. You're on the wall, we're all tired.\n\n01:55 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think in order to be on this show, you had to be over 60,. I think was the the rule.\n\n02:01 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI've seen that in the rear view mirror.\n\n02:04 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNext, to you, doc Searles, looking very festive in North Carolina. I think.\n\n02:07 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI'm older than all of you guys. Oh well, 760 years old Are you really? Yeah, 76, yeah 76,.\n\n02:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh yeah.\n\n02:16 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nAfter 60, it just all runs together. We just went to hell.\n\n02:20 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nYou know, I there was one time Scoble on a different podcast told me that I didn't understand Facebook cause I was too old Now and I told him. I told him dude, I've been young a lot longer than you.\n\n02:32 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah Well, and I have to point out that it's only the old's who use Facebook. Really, the truth is.\n\n02:38 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI know, I know this is like you know, a few years ago, you say that to young people now.\n\n02:42 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYou're too young to understand Facebook. Yeah, that's probably true. Doc's the host of a Floss Weekly, long time editor and chief of the Linux Journal and an open source Maven, and it's so great to have you on the show for the first time Next time.\n\n02:56 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nYeah welcome.\n\n02:57 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSteve Gibson was here last year with his Grinch hands. He's back. Hello, he's a mean one, mr G.\n\n03:05 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nHello everybody, great to be joining you from the green forest, whoa.\n\n03:11 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIn Southern California. It's hard to get Christmasy in Southern California, Isn't it?\n\n03:17 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nYeah, we're not even bothering. Yeah, we discussed it. It's like it's too much yeah there's no snow, it's.\n\n03:23 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThe sun is shining there are people in bikinis.\n\n03:26 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nYou have drag neighbors in to see the tree. It's like yeah.\n\n03:29 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNo, yeah, well. Well, doc has got quite a festive backdrop there because he's in Christmas, thanks to my sister, my sister this is her house. Very nice.\n\n03:40 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nAnd she has fiber. I'm on Wi-Fi, but oh, I like it. Yeah, you got 400 megabits both ways, pretty good.\n\n03:47 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, nice, that must be Also with us. The Lakata's a pile. I don't. I really I can't quite understand what's going on. Rod Pyle is here, host of this week in space, the editor in chief of Ad Astra, the space magazine from the National Space Society. Is this your Hollywood Halloween costume left over? I'm not sure.\n\n04:14 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYou know, no, I, it's just for you, leo, and this is how special I feel this is. So I'm just a disturbed person.\n\n04:20 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI thought maybe you suffered some severe burns and we're just embarrassed.\n\n04:24 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nNo, all my damage is internal up here. No worries.\n\n04:30 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, very nice to see you all. Thank you for spending your Christmas Eve with us and the Twitch family far and wide, and thanks to the Twitch family for being here on the night before Christmas. It's great to have you. I think you know, normally what we do on these shows is kind of look back at the year gone by and I thought, well, that's. I guess we could, you know, go through stories one by one. But we've here, we've got a panel of four experts in their own right and finding those stories requires work and I didn't want to.\n\n05:04\n\nI really didn't want to have to go through all of them. So you, you've outed me, Jeff, which is, by the way, Jeff's chief role on this week in Google. We've gotten so far afield from this from Google on this week in Google that we've contemplated calling it this week in general. But that's kind of.\n\n05:24 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nOr our new and magnificent co-host, paris Martino, noted that that friends said are you on a podcast with your dads? So it's now this week, in this week in geriatrics Wow.\n\n05:41 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, we are glad to have the host this week in space, this week in open source, this week in security and this week in general on our shows, actually let me start with you, steve, because, boy, you live this life Every week. You go through all of the security news. Figure out what the hell's going on. Tell me about 2023. Was there a trend, a particular thing that happened this year? Last year was the year of ransomware. I guess every year is going to be from now on.\n\n06:15 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nYeah, and so as trends go, I think that's the big one. We've talked about it on the podcast before. The fact that it's possible for bad guys to use extortion against enterprises of all sizes and receive payment through cryptocurrency is, unfortunately, a game changer.\n\n06:40 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, you know, we thought you and I both you did a. I don't know how many years ago you did your show on Bitcoin and I think we weren't alone. A lot of people thought this was going to be revolutionary and, for people who are unbanked in developing nations, it was going to change our dependency on national currencies, nations currencies and end up just really being a facilitator for bad guys. A money laundering scheme.\n\n07:10 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nI guess more than that, I would say it's an illuminator of human nature in general, because lots of good people have like lost lots of money because there's like, oh, I don't know what it is. Well, okay, stop right there. But you know they put their money in it anyway. But for the longest time you and I were talking on the podcast, you know, observing viruses and malware and kind of like well, why is anyone bothering? Why, like viruses were just there, they were kind of propagating, but they just sort of were like proofs of concept. There was nothing, nothing to gain. There was nothing to gain Behind them. Yeah, yes, and it changed when it became clear that it was possible for extortion to receive money, because money drives this all. And so, essentially, we have several decades of computer technology and systems where, you know, we thought it would be good to have passwords, we thought it would be good to have a firewall, but nobody really worried about them that much. And you know, if the firewall was leaking a little bit, oh well, we'll get around to that later. I mean, so security was mostly just sort of a thing. You said, oh yeah, we got that. Okay, you know what next?\n\n08:31\n\nThe problem now is that we've got hostile foreign governments who are protecting groups of very capable hackers, who, which is to say, you know they're not trying to chase them down and put them in prison. They're like, oh, you're going to go get the US, fine, have a nice day. And we're seeing groups like there's one Ryuk that's made, we know it's. They've generated $250 million in extortion, and we were talking about a different one, related to one that got themselves in trouble when they went pro-Russia after the Ukraine invasion. They've renamed themselves and, in less than two years, have made 107 million. So and we know this because now we're able to track the transactions across various cryptocurrencies as they move through exchanges so those guys made $107 million. Well, you know that'll get your attention. And the point is that we have we've always had, we've been playing lip service to security more than really having security, and now these chickens are coming home to roost because there's there are, there's motivation to breach the security that used to be good enough, even though it wasn't perfect.\n\n09:54 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh so because there's, because there's real money to maybe but that. But on that point, you know, I've talked to some of our. You know we have some people who are big fans of your shows, like. One of them is a Grayson in our discord who's really got good op sec, but he's just an individual and I and I actually said to him a couple of weeks ago Grayson, don't worry, nobody's attacking you. They're going after the people with deep pockets. Right? I mean, individuals aren't more at risk, are they?\n\n10:23 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nAnd yes. So if so, that's a trend. And if you said to me what is the event, what is the thing in 2023 that stands out, I would say the the revelation that we are seeing selective decryption of last pass wallets.\n\n10:43 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo, oh yeah, by the way, this is the one year anniversary of the of last pass really telling us the truth about what happened. They were breached in August of 2022, but it was in December December 22nd, exactly exactly a year ago, 2022 that they said oh yeah, you remember when we told you that in August we had a little problem? Well, it turns out it was maybe a little bit bigger problem. The threat I'm quoting, the threat actor was able to copy a backup of customer vault data. Oh, but don't worry, they're secure, they're encrypted. And that's been a slow burn story all 2023. Correct, combinating a couple of months ago in the realization that, in fact, those vaults were slowly being decrypted and hacked, and it was tens of millions of dollars have been drained from from people who were using last pass at the time of that theft.\n\n11:43\n\nSo that's been a one year long story. That started this time one year ago. What?\n\n11:48 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nwas last passed. Now, who knows? I don't know.\n\n11:54 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nI believe they're owned by a hedge fund firm. I think it's an equity capital company.\n\n11:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, and that's probably where the you know I mean, there's no finance expert here, but I think that that is one of the big stories of the last couple of years is is the aqua, especially in media right, jeff, where these equity capital companies would have been buying up media properties like crazy red ventures on ZD net and CNET and a bunch of other blogs. And they are not. They don't come from publishing I mean Rupert Murdoch's more of a publisher than they are. They come from money.\n\n12:30 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nAnd I worked with a guy named John Peyton who was the president of digital first media, alden, which is the notorious hedge fund that now controls most of the newspaper chains in America. John schooled me and the other advisors and he said all they're looking for is bad debt. They want cheap debt. Yeah, they buy the cheap debt. They know that they're going to get an asset or at best, cash flow with it, and they'll milk Bessie until she heals over in the field and walk away and they'll be fine.\n\n13:00 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, and the other problem with these guys is they often are heavily leveraged themselves. They usually borrow billions to do these acquisitions, which means they've got to turn, they've got to make some money, cash flow.\n\n13:13 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nThey got cash because they've got interest payments.\n\n13:15 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo often what they do is they they're chop shops or digital chop shops. They buy these brands and and and piecemeal them out. You see it in media like crazy. Look at the but I don't even know who owns Time Warner Discovery these days.\n\n13:29 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI can tell you, I can tell you, I mean time is is bending off. Sports Illustrated is the horrible marketing company that that put up the AI stuff with the fake authors. Fortune is a Thai businessman and the rest went to Meredith and Meredith went to um, not dash Meredith, it's just amazing. They closed a lot of publications, including my old baby, I don't even weekly. They had rest in peace, so you were.\n\n13:52 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nyou go ahead. Can I ask a question, jeff? When I was in grad school studying the stuff in the nineties, we were alarmed. I think it was Ben Begdickian's book we were all reading. We were terrified that less than 12 companies owned the the American newspaper landscape. What's left of it? How many owned the media landscape?\n\n14:11 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nnow it's a good question. It's few, but, but I think Ben Begdickian and that whole company of oh my God, consolidation was the was the wrong thing to panic about, which is what we usually do, is panic about the wrong things. Right they were. They were dinosaurs huddling against the cold of the future. It didn't really matter that they consolidated, uh, because they were going to shrink and die anyway. Look what's happened in the last few weeks and popular science gone.\n\n14:34 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nThat's sad.\n\n14:34 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHow many, how many you rated. How many of you old farts read popular science when you were kids.\n\n14:39 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nOh my God, got inspired by it. Right Old farts.\n\n14:42 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nEvery and every hand in the studio went up.\n\n14:44 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nPopular mechanics, and 73 and bite, of course, bite.\n\n14:48 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nBite. How many of you still have copies of bite?\n\n14:52 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI guess I have copies of bite. Absolutely, I have a side I have uh I.\n\n14:57 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI broke into the business uh writing for bite in 1984 when they did their 1984 Macintosh cover, one of the first reviews of Macintosh uh software that was.\n\n15:08 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI didn't know that. What did you say? Did you like it? I said it was good.\n\n15:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThere were four programs you could run on your Mac. Of course it was good. It was something you could put on your Mac that fit on a floppy. Was it popular mechanics or popular science that published the cover story on the MITS Altair that got Steve Ballmer Bill Gates?\n\n15:31 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nPopular electronics.\n\n15:32 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nElectronics. Okay, oh yeah, another long gone uh title, yep, yep, uh. You know, it's interesting to live in an era where print is pretty much gone. I mean, I, you know, 20 years ago I used to talk on the radio show about the death of physical media and people mocked me. You know, people who love video said, oh no, dvds are never go away. Uh, some people still say that. Oh no, it's the best quality vinyl.\n\n16:03\n\nYeah, I mean yeah, there's two record stores in town. People are still buying DVDs and vinyl. But really, come on, let's face it, uh, paper books, newspapers, magazines, vinyl, cd When's the last time we said I wrote a Motley Crude concert about old farts? Lisa and I went to a Motley Crude concert and, as chair, some charity was going around selling Motley Crude's new album on a CD and we bought one. But I realized after we bought it.\n\n16:34\n\nI don't know where I'm going to play it. Not nothing has. I have no CD players, Bandwidth and storage.\n\n16:40 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nYeah, you've got a USB a device in it that will play it in a drawer somewhere underneath piles of dead batteries and other things next to the zip disc Exploding.\n\n16:51 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYeah.\n\n16:54 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nSo you mentioned go ahead. I was going to say I do this thing where I visit dying radio stations, and there's one in Palm Springs I visited a couple of weeks ago Are there?\n\n17:06 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nany that are. That's so dark, that is so perfect dog.\n\n17:09 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nDoing something else? Yeah, but there's a whole story there, including the engineer locked us out and where, like the dog run out, there was a stack of container boxes that were of the kind you buy at home depot, with the doors on top, and they were Fall. I mean, they were rotted. I mean the actual plastic was rotted. They were full of CDs and Inside there were walls and walls of of open real tapes, the big reels. The big reels because they Programs. They were a beautiful music station for a while doing that.\n\n17:43 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSure, they would get those in the mail you get a real to reel of this week's music.\n\n17:49 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nThat's exactly get a big reel of this week's music, the whole thing. You know it was all programmed to somewhere else and I mean it's really sad. I mean it's still on the air, but I Mean radio. I mean I love radio and but it's, it's dying, it's on. Radio had its century.\n\n18:07 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nIf you think about it's entry, it had a century. 1923 to 2023 was the century of radio gone.\n\n18:13 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah it breaks my heart really, because I love that's how I got in this medium and I love this medium and now actually even podcasting is kind of. It's kind of fading off into the distance.\n\n18:25 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI'm curious, you know. So Spotify is just sort of like admitted that they've spent a billion dollars on they blew it. So how does that affect everybody else? I mean, oh, we're dying. We're dying out here, doc. Yeah, I know, I just said I don't know how. How dying? I hope not it's not good heart. A heart is still beating, but it's, but it's. So is it that the advertisers just suddenly say well, spotify screwed off, so to hell with. Everything is a lot of things.\n\n18:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI mean, spotify began a trend towards programmatic advertising where, instead of me reading it out, we, you know early. We started doing this in 2005 and I came from a radio background from Arthur Godfrey for crying out loud and, and so I was doing those you know, host endorsement reads that you know People had done for years on radio and I started doing it on podcasts and I think it. Honestly the sad thing to me is I think it really worked For our advertisers. That's all we ever heard. But that's been replaced because Spotify doesn't do that. Spotify injects ads and I'll tell you what's really going on. Steve, you can comment on this. What's really going on is mass surveillance and Advertisers, whether it's good for them or not, whether they can prove its value or not, are reluctant to buy ads that don't.\n\n19:47\n\nThey don't have lots of demographic information About the, the person hearing it, about when they heard it, where they heard it, how long they listen, all that stuff. It's it's. It's as wrong as it gets, and RSS can't do that. A traditional podcast we got you know nothing, I know your IP address, that's it. But Spotify, if you listen in the app, they know everything. They got your credit card dude.\n\n20:08\n\nSo advertisers got used to this idea that we will buy, just as they do on Facebook, a select slice of the audience and in order to make that work, spotify has to inject it into the podcast, as you're listening to it, as you're downloading it, and you know, the truth is, I don't think those ads work as well. They also, because they don't work as well, they can't charge as much. So it's put pressure on the cost, on the price that we can charge people, people. We actually are doing programmatic on some of our ads because our some, some agencies demand it. So there's this kind of this is a look, what is it? I know a rising tide raises all boats. What's it? What's it when it's going down?\n\n20:51 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nYeah, Does life life?\n\n20:55 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nyeah, Rogan's doing it live and Rogan, by the way, gets a million dollars a unit. I mean get. So it's not all gone. I think what happened is that advertisers wanted demographic information we couldn't provide and, secondly, that they kind of Jeff, you can talk about this. There are there are trends in an ad buying, and the trend right now is buy an influencer. But and that's why YouTube's doing so well, billy, hundreds of billions of dollars and ads moved off TV to YouTube this year. That was a what about your son.\n\n21:29 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nHe's doing great and he's an influencer.\n\n21:32 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOkay, just between you and me. On Friday a couple of weeks ago he did a stream on Amazon for Cheetos one hour for eighty nine thousand dollars.\n\n21:42 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nYou could buy a year of advertising on Twitter.\n\n21:45 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nFor that you could buy the advance for every book I ever wrote. Yeah, so it's great for Henry as long as it lasts.\n\n21:54 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's great for Marques Brownlee, it's great for Linus tech tips, but even companies like LTT I just found out they have 200 employees. They have a very successful channel on YouTube, but most of their money doesn't come from ads. They have 200 employees. Half of them are dedicated to merchandising. They make and sell products. So I think we're in a time of flux and while I'm so glad radio got a century, we're gonna get about a dime. Podcasting. That's okay.\n\n22:26 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nIt's been a lot of it's like the New York Times, made fun of blogs, thought blogs were just awful, and then they started blogging. And then they got bored with blogging and they'd ruin it. This is what it was him that happened again. Big old media comes in and they, they Take over the medium. This is what Dave Weiner complained at the time. I remember that, oh no, don't let him into blogs, it's gonna be miserable. And he was right.\n\n22:49 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's, by the way, another old fart we should have on this show, because he's a classic whiner. I don't want to make the show be a downer, by the way. I don't want. I mean, everybody thought a lot old people. All they're gonna say is you know, on my day, thinks were better. There was radio Magazine. Yes, we had Paul Harvey. We good day Thank. So you were talking about Bitcoin, steve. I was just looking this time last year, bitcoin was at forty three thousand dollars. Oh, so, of course, the peak was over $60,000 two years ago and now it's kind of coming back up. It's at forty three thousand at the time of recording. So, but Do you think cryptocurrency? It was a flash in the pan or is? Is there some staying power?\n\n23:39 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nThat I've always believed that the technology is real, that is, the fundamental technology of engineered scarcity and this concept of an immutable log. Those are the things that Satoshi invented and on that Was built the idea of you know, let's make this worth something. Let's just decide that this, that you know, these numbers, are dollars, and see what happens, and so. So there's no problem with that. The problem, as I said, is about human nature and about everything that then happened. When you know, this new type of tulip was invented, you know, and everyone went insane and it.\n\n24:24 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIs that true at all? Technology though it's, it rises and falls by the people who use it. You know and yeah, we're gonna talk about AI later and you know, that's exactly the case with AI. It's not that, it's not the AI, it's not the Bitcoin, it's the people.\n\n24:42 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nI will. I am on the topic of AI insecurity. I'll just say that Because technology and the internet and communications is the medium of AI, I worry that, before this podcast is over, leo we're we're gonna be looking and it's been extended past 999.\n\n25:04\n\nSo you know we have time and you have a lease for two and a half years. So I'll bet you that we're gonna see AI being used for Penetration, that is, you know, yes, and AI Liciously trained on network vulnerabilities and this thing gets unleashed on the internet and told to go find and Penetrate networks and unfortunately, it will be very effective.\n\n25:32 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nWhat will make it effective, steve? What? Just because it's raw power of trying to get it again? Yeah, it.\n\n25:37 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nYes, exactly, you're able to. You're able to brute force it. My, my wife, laurie, is playing a game that she she found out about when we were in Colorado a couple months ago With with my sister. It's a New York Times game where there's a there's a grid of 16 Words and you have to group them into four sets.\n\n25:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh, I love that. Connections yes.\n\n26:02 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nNuts over it. Yeah, and I looked at that and I just thought this will die on the throne of AI, because AI would have the ability to. I mean, jeff, in the same way that humans can no longer play chess. We had chess for a long time. We lost checkers a long time ago, but you know, now computers.\n\n26:24 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI'm still doing tic-tac-toe, steve, actually.\n\n26:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nBut I have to say I think yes, of course AI could solve connections probably today, because it's exactly what an, a large language model, does is make those connections. Probably today. But just because a computer plays chess better than any human alive In fact, your phone can be play better chess than any human alive, including Magnus Carlson, who's the highest rated player of all time doesn't mean people have stopped playing. People just correct.\n\n26:53 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nLike playing each other, right? Yeah, and it doesn't mean that AI will replace traditional hackers, but unfortunately it's probably gonna be able to just zip right past them. I mean, eventually hackers won't bother because they'll just have an AI and they can say you know, go find me a vulnerability, I want to extort somebody well, it's funny what happens when AI meets quantum computing.\n\n27:19 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nI.\n\n27:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThink it did it's like. So no things exact so this was the year the doc is not worried about AI, but I am well we'll talk, we're gonna get to see if it's your job to worry, you worry about everything, right.\n\n27:43 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nWell, you made his fortune on it, of course, of course you are You're worried calm?\n\n27:49 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt was about a year ago that a Grandmaster of chess, hans Neiman, was accused of cheating. He beat the Magnus Carlson. The at the time the world champion is no longer the world champion because he didn't defend his title. But they beat him and Carlson got up from the table and said if implied that he'd cheated. There was some question how he cheated. They now believes he had a lot. I'll just leave it to your imagination. He had a device inserted and Was was getting vibrations, vibrations.\n\n28:22 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nBut I I bring that's right uh well, that's sure or not? That's been.\n\n28:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThe problem is that, yeah, ai could be to human.\n\n28:30 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nHuman to human chess is still very viable and fun, right uh, I found a 238% increase to 102 million users who signed up since January 2020.\n\n28:41 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, that's the problem. Yeah, that's the problem.\n\n28:43 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nIt's not a problem.\n\n28:44 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's humans, and people are doing a cheat, and and if you could figure out a way to get the message From a computer, you can even beat the best player in the world. And, by the way, you don't have to get every move, it's just if you got five, a little nudge, a little little. Well, nudge is one more.\n\n29:05 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nIt ain't a nudge, it's a new definition of Riz.\n\n29:11 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThe word of the year according to the Oxford English dictionary, which apparently is much hipper than I am because I had never heard of it. All right, we are doing your Christmas Eve and I am glad you decided to spend a little Christmas Eve time with us. We've done in the past with the great shots of Jaeger Meister, I think, given our advanced age, and some tattoos oh, that was new.\n\n29:32\n\nOh, what are you drinking, john? I mean, jeff, I got a little red wine left over from there. That's good. How about you, doc? You got anything?\n\n29:41 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nMy sister's brought me this ice water. I swat her before there was actually tea. That'll warm your veins.\n\n29:48 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nTo your tool for caffeine.\n\n29:51 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, grab a beverage, the old farts. A holiday special for Christmas.\n\n29:55 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nEve.\n\n29:56 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nContinues in just a little bit. Hey, this week in tech is brought to you this week by rocket money. If I asked you oh and this is a painful question how many subscriptions You're paying for right now, would you be able to list them all and how much they cost and when they renew? If you had rocket money, you would know. If you'd asked me before I started using rocket money, I had no idea. Let me tell you. I say it's a lot of money with rocket money. By canceling those subscriptions I didn't want anymore. Rocket money is amazing. I know how much I've got, I know what my net worth is. But the most valuable tool with rocket money is Is canceling those subscriptions. You'd forgotten about that. We're just dribbling money out of your account every single month.\n\n30:44\n\nRocket money, it's a personal finance app that finds and cancels yes, it does it for you your unwanted subscriptions. It also monitors your spending, helps you lower your bills. Rocket money is the tool. It now has more than five million users. I've been using it for years, literally years, and it's helped save its members an average of $720 a year, more than $500 million in canceled subscriptions. It found in fact it's a little embarrassing a campaign contribution that I didn't notice had a recurring check mark that I've been paying more than $720 a month. You can see all your subscriptions in one place. If you see something, you know what, you could cancel it with a tap. You never have to get on the phone with customer service. You don't have to talk them down. It. Rocket money does it for you. Stop wasting money on things you don't use. Cancel your unwanted subscriptions. Go to rocket money, comm slash twit. I love this. I've been using it for years rocket money, comm slash Twit. Remember the name rocket money, comm slash twit.\n\n31:54\n\nWe are talking the end of the year and, as always I like to do at the end of the year, I get together with some of my favorite people and we Chat about what we've observed. Here we have four of our best show hosts. Hosts Rod pile of this week in space Security. Now Steve Gibson. Doc Searles from Floss Weekly. Jeff Jarvis From this week in Google Doc. Was this the year of desktop Linux?\n\n32:20 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nEvery year is now because you know your your phone well, your you palm top Linux With with Android is Linux. Yeah but on top of that, I mean bet on if you but you're using BSD. If you got a Mac, I'm pretty sure I'm emina and I it's a you next, yeah, I think it's a unit, it's. He looks underneath all that, yeah, but I mean it actually. Chromebooks are doing pretty hot. Yeah, chromebooks are doing.\n\n32:44 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's a. That's Jeff Staley driver.\n\n32:47 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nHe's a Chromebook guy. Oh, really, your Chromebook. Look at this, you got an aces Chromebook. Very nice, that's. Yeah, I don't, I'm talking to you Mac, but there's BSD under all of that. But I actually put it out to my, my core of of co-hosts and got that. The big thing this year is red hat killing sent OS. Which is there. That was a shocker. Yeah, that was a shocker Sent OS was an enterprise Linux.\n\n33:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat was widely prized because it was very stable right and you could kind of put your servers on it and count on it. But but red hats and was bought by IBM. That was what precipitated all of this. What is red had supposed offering now? I mean, did they replace it?\n\n33:36 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nWell, they well. I Don't fully understand it. I think what you should do is go to hack a day and see what John it's been it wrote about it. He's a co-host to share there. With love John, I was trying to bone up on it. He's great on this stuff and the big question with it is is what then? Whatever it is they're doing, does it violate the GPL in some way? And and and Actually another co-host, simon Phipps, had a really good one liner, which is that Licenses don't compile, meaning licenses are fuzzier than that. You know they're not. You don't run them like code. It's just basically governance that you try to obey and you know, and they kind of hold the society together and it's it's an open thing. I mean there's Alma, linux and some others that have come along to sort of. Then there's issues going on with those as well. So so that's one thing. Another is Steam Deck. So that would for gaming. That's kind of hot. Well, that's a good point, that was a that yeah.\n\n34:44 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nVal held gaming device runs Linux, although there yeah, you know aces then put out one that ran on Windows. I don't think it's become quite as popular as the Steam Deck.\n\n34:53 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI don't know. The big thing for me personally is that and just looking back across all the guests that we've had on which are, you know, so far, 50 of them I suppose this year there's this sort of generalized concern that, as as as open source becomes more and more normalized inside companies, that and everything's in containers and it's all many levels above the silicon and above the kernel and whatever else you're running that the open source ethos is getting pretty diluted. It's the, the hardcore, the people who still are with Foss weekly, every week, and before that with Linux journal. There's about 10,000 of them and they're, they're hardcore, they care about it and and I'm sure there's a lot more than that, but there's. But there is a kind of a hardcore there, but it's not, they're wizards and and they're.\n\n35:52\n\nI think that if I were to summarize what I think I see going on, is that there's a Mugly aspect to a lot of the development that's going on. An open source oh, what a muggy. Like Muggles, as in there they're muggles, they're. They don't belong to Slytherin or Griffin or or any of those.\n\n36:11 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThey're not wizards, they're just normal.\n\n36:14 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nThey could do wizardy things. They could. They could wield the thing and make magic happen. It's not that they can't do magic, but the but, the, the ethos are sharing of. Of. You know, this is great XKCD Cartoon that shows a heap of of stones that are here. Here's the edifice of the internet, and there's one stone holding up all of the others over here. This is, yeah, that's the one.\n\n36:38\n\nI had it pulled up already, doc, as soon as you started talking this. I know every it's one of the classics. It's just and that's it.\n\n36:45 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThis is. It looks like, yeah, it's blocks or stones all standing one another and it's all modern digital infrastructure, and then it all depends on this little slim block. That's a project some random person in Nebraska has been Thanklessly maintaining since 2003, on a two-year. We've talked about this, steve, on on your show on security now, yeah, this is a problem. I think that these, these maintainers are doing a thankless job. You've talked a little bit about how some of these repositories, like Pi Pi and others, have been a place where hackers a constant attack.\n\n37:25 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nNow, yeah, bad guys trying to put malicious packages in there, in in what we now have, the so-called supply chain attack, where you attack the software upstream that other programmers are downloading and binding into their projects, and Out it goes. And of course, a big scare was the log for J vulnerability that we had and and that and that was it was a heavily used Java library that it turns out in very specific situation and conditions you were able to take advantage remotely of a slight design flaw and the problem was that this thing had been, it would have been embedded in so many other projects that the good news was it wasn't easily Exploitable and so we didn't see the end of the internet happen. But you know, here it was, it was free and the guy who wrote it, you know he didn't make a mistake on purpose, but neither is he paying, you know, bug bounties to have his code checked, because you know the ecosystem doesn't support that model.\n\n38:29 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, this and to take it back to what you were saying, doc, I think it really does come back to the fact that these major corporations, these big money-making companies like IBM, are kind of taking advantage of open source. They're not putting the money back in, they're not supporting this guy in Nebraska, they're not making sure stuff secure, they're just using open source. Does that seem?\n\n38:50 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nwell, I don't think it's entirely fair. I think IBM is. So here's a little, a little bit of history. I was very mused by like and back when Linux world existed, back in like that, 99, 9899, the first time IBM showed up there. It was actually just with guys in suits with black shoes and and and and there was a post one red shoes.\n\n39:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWhite shirt skinny black ties, I know.\n\n39:23 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nProtectors, and and they had a. They had a. They had a single booth devoted to something called web sphere, which is their web server, not that anybody cared. And and the next year they had beanbags and ethernet tables all over the place and geeks laying around it and they were like they were. They were spending money, saying we love Linux, and what happened was explained to me by the geeks there, by geeks there that, oh Well, they found that they had several million instances of sampler running on old Doing file and print on old Windows machines that weren't working anymore. And so what? And then they did a survey and they told me this they did the the guys are no longer wearing suits and we're, you know, pro Linux that they surveyed one of their, their divisions, which is why survey the world. They have a big division, is kind of like they look, as I just say how you doing in there, you know so. They said they tested for five levels of Linux awareness and Bottom level was conspelled in X and top level is hacks kernel code and found that all 600 could spell Linux and like a Fifth of them or something where hacking not only hacking kernel code were Maintainers wow, kernel, I mean. And so basically what happened is IBM got Went into compliance with his own engineers and later Microsoft did exactly the same thing.\n\n40:41\n\nYou know that Bing ran on on Linux. You know what else is he are running on. You know they're working on their own stuff, so so what? But I was told a number of times that people at IBM that they they really really really had kind of a species change Over this thing. But this is in the aughts roughly, and I think that there's we were talking about being farts. You know they would. Corey doctor, who talks about something called Injification.\n\n41:07 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh my god, that was the term of the year, by the way Oxford.\n\n41:11 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nEnglish and should have used that instead of Riz, yeah and and I don't think, I don't think every company inch buys, I think, wordpress, for example. I think that met Mullenweg is doing a fabulous job. He was on with us this year and he celebrates.\n\n41:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, he was on my show too. It's all about a source.\n\n41:29 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nYeah, he's all about open source and you know um I. They support RSS. They support a lot of good things. Dave Winder's been working closely with them. They saved my blog, which had been at Harvard, and Harvard decided to close its service.\n\n41:48 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nYeah, that's a great story.\n\n41:50 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nAnd worked really closely with the Harvard people to make sure nothing got 404'd at all. Everything redirects to something maintained at Pressable, which is a WordPress site hosting service. I mean good guys, really good people, and I think there are some of those at an IBM. But I just think when you get big enough and you get far enough away from whatever it is that made you cool, I don't know, I mean it's there's a different story, but this is when the Craig Burton told me back when he was alive, that was a time to do it, a long time ago. It was after he'd left Novell, and he said at that time he said well, you know, there's this myth of the in some religion, of the giant snake that circles the world, and the trick is to know for the tail, to know when the head is dead, because it takes a while. And and he maintained at that time that IBM's head was dead.\n\n42:45\n\nI don't think it was, but I think, the more you're dealing only with the big enterprises, and that's your entire, you know, customer base you're too detached, you know, and and I think that obviously, I think the colonel is working fine, but the colonel works in everything. I mean your clock, your watch, your, you know, door ringer, all that kind of stuff is running on Linux and so it has to run everywhere and that's kind of an ethos is built into Linux. But I don't know, I mean there's a, there's a species change that I think I mean. When I first started out in Silicon Valley with my little company, we realized that there were three stages that companies grew there was new, there was hot and there was big, and there were completely different stages and you had different people really running it at different times.\n\n43:41\n\nA few could stay through the whole thing, but there's something that comes after big, you know, and it's and ever, ever seen Jeffrey West and why companies die, why, why cities live in companies die, no, the company, it's really good. Look up Jeffrey GEO FFREY West. He's a Santa Fe Institute and he wrote a big book called scale. That's about this that that companies are inherently closed systems and we're closed systems. That's how we got old, you know, and how we're all going to die, because we're closed systems. And companies tend to be closed systems and I think a few like WordPress, do their best. They stay as open as they possibly can. And you know one like IBM, even though they bought red hat. It's just not, you know, sooner or later they're they're going to die. They're they're going to die like everyone was going to die.\n\n44:29 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, for a while I think we thought these companies that the business cycle was over, that companies like Google and Apple and Microsoft have gotten so big that they'd actually defeated the business cycle and that no one could succeed them.\n\n44:46 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nBut I think we know now that's not true, right, I think I think it's not true. I mean we have to. I mean, in a long. It's pretty hard to look at Apple right now and say how can they fail? You know, well, they can, right, I'm sure they they sure they can.\n\n44:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, we thought Facebook would never fail, and I think you can make an argument that Facebook is no longer dominant. I think. That's too great, I think, as AI, and what's doing?\n\n45:06 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\ngreat Jeff.\n\n45:07 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nIt's a Facebook stock, Meta stock. I know I know this Interesting.\n\n45:11 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI don't know what it is. Yeah, I you know. I think AI could unseat Google.\n\n45:17 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nGoogle's still dominant in search effect more than ever, but I think AI could they think Google stock was up 5% today and I'm guessing it's because of Genesis.\n\n45:26 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nGenesis. We played a demo on twig a couple of weeks ago. Donishing, that was mind boggling. Now it's good. Yeah, jeff had to talk me down he said you know, this is an edited demo and it's they're showing, they're showing the best results. But it was kind of uncanny. I mean, I, if it's anything close to the way Gemini actually works, I think we're awfully close to AGI.\n\n45:51\n\nOh boy, there's a you know what let's take a break, and then AGI would be a good topic to get into. And, by the way, rod, I'm going to talk about space, because this was the year of Elon Musk, that's for sure, and his success and space have only been matched by his failures in social. So we'll talk about both in just a little bit. You're watching a very, I think a very special Christmas Eve show. Doc reminds me you were on last year, steve. You were on last year, I think we're in fact.\n\n46:26 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI can't forget Steve with the green.\n\n46:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI know, mr Cranche. Chromakey button every time the only newbie is is the, the metal clad blueberry Over here.\n\n46:36 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nHe had to fly in from the planet far away and he said you know, the radio symbols went out last year. And he said, okay, I'll be there at the end.\n\n46:45 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnyway, great to have all four of you and we will continue in just a bit with the holiday special, the Christmas Eve edition of old farts at play right after this.

We continue with our Christmas Eve twits special so glad you're here. Next week New Year's Eve will be the best of that's when we really will look back at the events of the year and some fun and important momentous occasions in 2023. This show really is about you guys. It's about getting together with buddies and talking about things we noticed this year. Jeff, you seem to take some umbridge at my notion that maybe we're getting kind of close to AGI. First of all, the definition of AGI is pretty squiggly, so I don't know if we even know what that means. But you look at that Gemini video and I'm sure we'll get maybe our own hands on it sometime soon and be able to see how good it is. But it was very, very impressive, Do you not agree?\n\n49:25 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nJeff. So Mark Twain said that a machine that was set type would have to think, and he wasted his fortune and went bankrupt and lost his sense of humor.\n\n49:40 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI forgot about that.\n\n49:41 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nYes, Investing in the page machine to compete with the line of type and it didn't need to think. But that's what we think when we see a machine that does something that we did, that we do, and if it can do that it must be as smart as we are. It must be able to think Um and no, I don't think we're anywhere near a machine with general intelligence that can tackle any task. That does not mean that the Gemini demo isn't effing amazing. It's phenomenal. Machine can do what this is. It's great and we can do all kinds of wonderful things with it. But this anthropomorphization, did I say that if for one Um that that you can say, like you can say anthropomorphization I think I think is fooling ourselves and is the wrong debate.\n\n50:31\n\nAnd this is where this is where I think I'm becoming a big fan of Yon Likun, who's in charge of AI at Metta. He's a voice of reason here saying calm down everybody. It's a it's a fascinating machine. He could do lots of things. Yes, yes, yes, but it's not it's. He said it may be get to cat brain or dog brain eventually.\n\n50:51 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nUh, it's not doing stuff that no dog could do, no, two year old could do in many cases. This is pretty sophisticated recognition, uh response. I mean it's kind of I know again it's. It could be a little bit hoked, we don't know how, how realistic this is, but if it is this good, uh, that's a little bit uh interesting.\n\n51:14\n\nI think there's a mistake people make worse than anthropomorphizing it, which is saying, well, how did it get there? And worrying about the process instead of the outcome, and I think yes, and I think outcome matters.\n\n51:27 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nI was just going to say to Jeff, if you have a computer that can beat anybody at chess, then you have a computer that can beat anybody at chess, you know the fact that it isn't self aware or that it can't wash the dishes, that seems to me aside from you know, like like a whole different issue. So I guess the question is what? What is it that we're asking?\n\n51:50 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nThat's a specific intelligence. It's a general intelligence. Can it take any?\n\n51:54 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\ntask. I can't do any task. I'm good at some and I'm crappy at most, so so so at some point we're going to get to a place and I think this is what we're we're foreseeing where, you know, a computer is less annoying than a person and it could do everything that the person that you asked the person that you would ask the person to do the computer can do, in which case it's a, it's a functional replacement for a person no, not all people, but you know the annoying guy in the corner. And it doesn't seem to me that we're that far away.\n\n52:34 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI still think we are, but the other. The other problem here and this is Leo's least favorite word of the year Riz is the dictionary's favorite word of the year. Leo's least favorite word of the year is test real.\n\n52:46 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nOh.\n\n52:46 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nGod, we had bets that you would get that in before halfway through, so I well done.\n\n52:51 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI beat it by five. So test real is an acronym for the various loony faux philosophies that drive these AI boys who think that this long term ism its effective altruism, its transhumanism, rationalism. And I forget what the E stood for uh, extra opism or effective?\n\n53:16 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\naltruism We've got that too, right, right.\n\n53:19 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nAnd, and so it's their belief that they are the smartest and most powerful people and that they're going to create machines that are going to be smarter than any of us, including them, and that we owe a debt to the future unborn 10 to the 58th human beings, including those augmented by computers, and really the people today don't much matter. Our only job is to keep everything going for all those future beings.\n\n53:42 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThis is apparently Larry Page's point of view, the founder of Google. There was a great article on the piece in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago, kind of a history of how we got here in AI, talking about a famous fight, you know, around a campfire in 2015 between Larry Page and Elon Musk. Elon said we've got to protect ourselves against the AI's and Larry. Larry said oh, you're a speciesist, you know. You're trying to protect humans against the next thing, and they're both nuts. They're both nuts. I think?\n\n54:17 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI do think it's just a tool, and, and and the problem is the philosophy heads toward utilitarianism and eugenics where they think they're going to exactly Exactly, Doc.\n\n54:28 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWhat do you think? What do you think?\n\n54:30 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nOh, okay, but but having crazy people doesn't discount the fact that we have some impressive new technology, right?\n\n54:38 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nDon't focus on all of the shows.\n\n54:41 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nHuman like Okay, but the fact that we now have a problem of universities trying to figure out whether their students wrote the paper or a machine wrote the paper, that I mean, that tells you something happened. I mean something really significant happened.\n\n54:58 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nOr it tells you that teaching students to write dumb essays all these centuries was a really idiotic thing to do. We should teach them to think instead.\n\n55:06 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nDoc, where do you come down on this? I'm very curious.\n\n55:09 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI've come down and all over the place I come down like an exploded rocket, a musk rocket.\n\n55:15 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWhat do they call that rod Rapid, unexpected.\n\n55:19 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nRapid, unscheduled Rapid unscheduled disassembly, yeah, yeah.\n\n55:25 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nSo, um, on the university topic, we had Clay Scherke, who has AI in his title, as a vice provost at NYU Wow, at Indiana University two days ago and it'll be up online soon. I can't wait to watch that. That was a great get.\n\n55:42 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nHe's so good Clay's been. Clay disappeared ever since he became an administrator. It used to be we had to quote Clay every two days. I know that was nowhere, so he had a lot of quotable stuff.\n\n55:54 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nOne of them is mostly will put engineering at the end of their title so they'll get a raise or engineer, you know, prompt engineer, you know. Anyway, um, and he had some really delicious things to say about not only how hard that is but also and I think it's an important thing how almost fun it is to try and navigate all this stuff because we have this fabulous tool. You know, it's like the PC and the PC showed up and all of a sudden everybody could do far more than a mainframe could and did it far better than a mainframe could, and and and it was fun. I mean, I, I love playing with AI and I think it's. It's just I like having a playoff between perplexity and chat, gbt and Bard and and um, I actually think the, the being uh image creator is actually better than than dolly, even though it uses dolly, and I've had a lot of fun with that Um. But I agree with Jeff that there's there's a eugenic aspect to this. I mean, what eugenics sought to do was improve the, improve humanity by um, by testing everybody.\n\n56:58\n\nThey invented IQ test, the whole doors of a Jesus, you know, a church EPT is an IQ of 40 million. Well, people don't have IQs either. I and my mother was a teacher. My IQ scores had an 80 point range. I hated school. Sometimes they did really well, other times they did really bad.\n\n57:14\n\nThere's no such thing as an IQ. You can't, you can't. It's not a dipstick or a thermometer that'll measure your intelligence. Intelligence is. Intelligence is a human quality, like empathy or hate or love or other things, and machines cannot replicate that. Okay, we can use machines to do all kinds of wonderful things, but it doesn't mean that they are us. And it isn't just that we're anthropomorphizing the machines, we're machinizing ourselves by imagining that we could be replicated entirely by by a machine. That that has general intelligence.\n\n57:49\n\nI don't think it's artificial, it's real. Um, I don't know how general it is. It can't be general enough to be like like one of us. You know we're it's. Think about this. It's a human quality that we, we forget things in seven seconds. You know, we, we don't remember how we started the sentences or ending, or how we're going to end the sentences we start, yet somehow we get meaning across, and that's a remarkably human thing. Um, humor is another one, uh, uh. Brad Templeton I think it is on Facebook has been trying to get a um uh an AI to do a New Yorker cartoon. Even when he feeds it with the right one line is it doesn't quite work because it doesn't get irony. It's. That's a human thing, you know. It's. It's so, you know I. I think in in relief, we will appear to be more human when this thing's done than we did when it started.\n\n58:39 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nSo this is where our friend David Weinberger, I think, is so smart. His last book, um uh, which was, uh, everyday chaos, I think, was called some wonderful, wonderful book and and what? What David says is going to drive us nuts is that we get better predictions out of the machine than we can make because it has so much data and it can. It can analyze it in a way that never could be analyzed before. However, it brings no explanation, and we expected that we had explanations in the world. We thought we explained things. That's what journalists do, that's what novelists do, that's what historians do, but we're actually full of crap. We think we can explain things, and those things that we call accidents or miracles are just things we can't explain.\n\n59:25 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, but if I ask a machine what the weather is going to be, I don't care how it got to. It's going to rain tomorrow, as long as it rains tomorrow. Well, why do I need to know how it got there?\n\n59:36 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nCause you're the one who brought up artificial general intelligence is, if there's such a thing as intelligence, where I think doc is exactly right, steve, steve we talked about this a few months ago and you?\n\n59:46 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nyour conclusion was we are nothing more than thinking machines. So why is it impossible to think a machine couldn't do it?\n\n59:53 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nI do believe that, and I think everybody is impatient, and that in five years we're going to have an entirely different terrain than we do today.\n\n01:00:02\n\nI mean, we're all wondering what this is that has just begun to emerge and I would argue we have no idea but it. But exactly as you say, leo, my, my belief is that we're going to create something which which is very much capable, and it won't be biological and it won't work with. You know, neurons and synapses and, and you know biochemistry, the way our brain does, but I don't see any big bridge. I guess I'm, I'm not seeing that there has to be a soul, if you want to use that term, in order to have intelligence. I think you'd need an astounding amount of complexity, and we're currently shooting up a complexity curve at a very high speed and I think in in a few years, you know, if we had a similar conversation, you know there would be a lot more expectation and and I'm not worried, I just don't want to put these machines in control of our future and our you know our physical destiny.\n\n01:01:21 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nDon't give them the nukes for sure.\n\n01:01:24 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nWell, and don't give them the authority to write humor, because it's astonishing. I never realized how complicated and subjective humor was until I tried to get a chat GPT to write me space jokes for this week in space. They were miserable.\n\n01:01:37 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nReally worse than your own Because that's a pretty low bar, Worse than mine and Bennett's Okay okay, I get it.\n\n01:01:44 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nNo, it was just astonishing. But. But as you kind of said a few minutes ago, and I'm having a little trouble taking the Grinch hands seriously, but it's great they're growing on me, but it's really hard, I guess, to understand the subtleties of humor at least for those models.\n\n01:01:58 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, you know honestly, do we need a machine, a comedian? I don't think so. Do we need do any machines that could perhaps improve crop production or do gene folding or create new vaccines? That might be pretty useful. And if it can't tell a joke, I can live with that right. And yet.\n\n01:02:18 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nyet over the years, the new technologies seem to have profited most by doing very mundane things for consumers. I mean, if you look at the history of science fiction, you go back to the thirties and forties and what do you see on the covers of all those pulp magazines, huge government supported projects and cities in the sky and airplanes that can hold 2000 people going hither and yon and so forth. And what happened is it didn't go get bigger, it got smaller and it went private instead of state owned and it became people doing kind of mindless and significant things.\n\n01:02:49 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nActually, I'm not surprised, though, because if you think about what we think of as ancient history, the stuff that survives is those giant monumental projects. Those are the things that live on, not the subtle, you know, intricacies of humor and human interaction. A thousand years later, those are lost in the sands.\n\n01:03:07 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nWell, so tomorrow I have lunch with a guy admire greatly, named Andrew Pedigree, who's the Dean of book historians Now he started the Universal Short Title catalog that catalogs every known thing printed from 1454 to 1750. Anyway, so what they catalog is the things. The things that exist are the things that we didn't care about and put on a shelf and preserved, the things that got used every day Right, Got lived to death right.\n\n01:03:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nLove to death? Yeah Right, those don't survive. I'd like to actually, we started talking a little bit about Corey's doctrine of insurification, which that's, by the way I say it that way because I like to bowdlerize our conversation but I thought that was really one of the most important essays of 2023. Corey observed that companies and he uses Amazon as his example, it's a perfect example Start out acting in the interest of the customer because they need to build a customer base and they focus very much on that. That's stage one. Stage two they start focusing on the businesses in the case of Amazon, the third party sellers to build up that. And then, stage three, they cash in on the structures that they've built and it results in disappointing both the customers and the third party sellers or the businesses they do business with. But they do it in favor of profit, and this seems to be a trend universal in technology. And while I said earlier that the business cycle has disappeared, it seems to me the insurification cycle has only been amplified. We're living in that right now. Doc, you agree?\n\n01:04:55 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nYeah, it's astonishing to me, but not surprising Interesting slight difference there that Jeff Bezos, who I thought did a really good job early on of insisting that the customer was the most important I think somebody told me that you would have a cutout of a person that would be in the boardroom or the different rooms that they had conversations in that would represent the customer. The customer would always be there and now all the meaningful stuff that's in anything you search for is way, way, way down below and you have to read between the lines.\n\n01:05:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThat's a perfect example.\n\n01:05:36 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nAnd there's screwing people on both ends. They're screwing the poor people that have to advertise in order to become a sponsor. You get the sponsor result. We saw it with Google too. They started with a few ads on the right side and now the ads come on top and they push all the meaningful stuff down, even off the page.\n\n01:05:56 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nCorey writes this is how platforms die and you could use Amazon, you can use Google. He used TikTok in his essay. First, they're good to their users. Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers. Finally, they abuse those business customers and, by the way, regular customers to claw back all the value for themselves. And I left out the fourth step. Then they die and it starts all over. Corey's argument is this is normal. This is the new business cycle and what we should call for is the ability to jump from platform to platform, that as soon as they stop caring about us, we should be able to take our data and move somewhere else. This is his argument for interoperability, which I completely agree with.\n\n01:06:46 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nIt also goes back to what Doc said earlier. I've looked at this book and put it in my wish list. It's about the problems of scale. It's the problems of mass I talk about this all the time mass media. But once scale became the expectation, once bigger became the issue, you needed everybody in your audience to sell up the advertisers. Then you were never big enough, and that's what leads to that. And so how do we return to a human scale? We talked about this on Twiglio. Where are we going to have a next Twitter? No, I hope we have a next 100 Twitter and 1000 Facebooks and we return to a human scale and all of this. And that's where open source, I think, can serve us well.\n\n01:07:26 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nYeah, it does feel like maybe this is just old fart talk, but it feels like we're being leveraged Exactly Every direction you turn. Youtube they got me. Now they're increasing the price, and now Hulu wants to do the same. And you can't buy this. You have to subscribe to it in order to get it. And it's like this feeling of everything I want to do is taking as much from me as they can, which takes away this sense of joy and like, oh, I'm getting a deal. It's like no, the deals are gone.\n\n01:08:07 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nWell, what's puzzling to me, though, is, with Bezos and Musk in particular, you've got these two very wealthy business leaders who have in some ways I'm saying subjectively brutalized their business to the point that my experience, when I go on Amazon to buy something, if it's not from a manufacturer I know, is basically terror trolling, because I don't know what I'm getting at.\n\n01:08:29 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, it's very risky.\n\n01:08:30 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYeah, and yet both these guys are very public in their desire to save the human race and I believe them. I really do. I mean, I've talked to both of them in person and the person you know. Bezos's big vision is move all polluting, dirty industries off the earth into space, save the earth, make it a park, and he's now preparing to give away the bulk of his fortune, looking for places to do that. So I'll do whatever it takes in a possibly let's say, musk in this case, in a possibly morally ambiguous way to make these fortunes, if he can even do it with Twitter and yet then turn around and do some amazing stuff that does benefit the larger world.\n\n01:09:08 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI think it's the head scratcher to be. It's the Andrew Carnegie cycle. Yes, yes, a guy who made his yeah, he was a robber.\n\n01:09:16 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI don't give us that much credit. No Well, I don't give Andrew Carnegie much credit. I think he didn't want to go to hell, and he's so true.\n\n01:09:24 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nHe built a lot of libraries.\n\n01:09:26 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nCrazy, I think they're losing it Actually.\n\n01:09:29 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nI agree. I think they're losing it. I think there's the catch been going on. Maybe one word or the other.\n\n01:09:33 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nThey're talking to a mirror at this point.\n\n01:09:35 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd this is a guy by yes man. Yeah, Bezos is a guy who did in, you know, completely enabled that institution Vacation cycle at Amazon and then took off with his helicopter flying girlfriend and his rocket, penis-shaped rocket ship.\n\n01:09:54 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nHe's, he's. No irony there.\n\n01:09:57 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHe's late-stage Billionaire. At this point I Do want to take a little break because I think we you know, we got to talk Elon, we got to talk Elon and I'll let you kick that one off Rod, because Elon is such a weird Contradiction of things of everything in every respect.\n\n01:10:19 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nHe wasn't up until he bought X.\n\n01:10:22 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWell, I'm this and that was the story of 2023. Bought X late in 2022 and this entire year has been the year is interesting and almost lovable, and they're always.\n\n01:10:33 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nAnd he turned into this.\n\n01:10:34 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh my god, waco is that because we suddenly see?\n\n01:10:38 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nwhat he is.\n\n01:10:39 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:40 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nLet's see.\n\n01:10:40 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI mean that's probably what it was. I mean, you know, it opened. It opened a valve of bile directly at everybody and I was like, whoa, that's what's in there, boy let's close that biofile for a moment.\n\n01:10:53 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWe want to take a break. We will come back. We don't want to spray people too hard. You are watching the 19. I'm sorry night. I almost said now. There it is I'm an old fart out the 1923 edition of the old farts Christmas special. We will be back with more in just a bit. You know every holiday show we have a great sponsor.

Jeff Jarvis is here from this week in Google, the wonderful man I've admired for years. Doc Searls I mean, I admire you all, I love you all, but doc I read the Clutrain manifesto and tried to foist it on tech TV executives to try to explain to them why they had it all wrong. I bought every one of them a copy and we're so pleased that doc has been with us as the host of floss weekly. How, why did you start doing that? How long have you been doing that now?\n\n01:14:35 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nI think it's not going in four years.\n\n01:14:37 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nMaybe it's more, chris de Bona and I started that show. He was the open source maven at Google Way back in the day, I think, 2006, 2007.\n\n01:14:48 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nChris is great. What's he doing now? I know he left Google. It's a good question.\n\n01:14:52 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI got to look him up and find a guy I'll course Steve Gibson, who is the continues to be the host of the number three show on the network. We did, we did, and he's aged a little bit. His hair is turned green but he is still it's the second show on the network, was it Lisa's telling me you were? The second show was twit security. Now, yeah, I guess that's right.\n\n01:15:17 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nAnd as you. You asked me during one of our breaks in Vancouver, when we were shooting call for help. You, you were. You were leaning on the set and you said so how would you like to do a weekly podcast on Security? And I said a what cast Podcast? And I said no one's heard of a podcast.\n\n01:15:38 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nHere we are. We've all heard a podcast now. Yeah, it's amazing, 15 years and out. You know, radio got a hundred years. I don't get it. No, we're gonna. You know what I love podcasting. I think one of the things that's great about podcasting is we can bring these voices Into you, your space, into into your ears, into where you are and have these great conversations.\n\n01:16:00 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nThey still have to mow the lawn and listen to something. Yeah, while they're, while they're pushing the lawn mower, or, or, or, or, driving to their job. Or yeah exactly I mean, and so you know we're really good filler.\n\n01:16:12 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYeah Well, I'm glad you have such high as people go to sleep at night.\n\n01:16:18 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd then, of course, our newest old fart. You know you're only here cuz I thought for years you were like much younger than me, but it turns out we're the same age. No, I'm a month older than you. Yeah, I don't know how he looks so young. I guess those treatments are working.\n\n01:16:32 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nBut I just don't get me closer to the camera.\n\n01:16:36 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nRod pile from this week in space. So, rod, you have in your role as a as a space journalist. I've been covering Elon since he took over. He didn't start SpaceX right?\n\n01:16:49 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nNo, he did. It was Tesla that he kind of took.\n\n01:16:51 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOkay, so he bought Tesla took some of the profits and Invested it in space. What was his goal in the beginning at space space X?\n\n01:17:00 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nSo he wanted initially. His whole idea was he wanted to launch a small, basically bell jar experiment to Mars to try and grow a plant. He just wanted to send a little greenhouse to Mars You're kidding. Prove that it could be done.\n\n01:17:13 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nNo, was the whole. Thing.\n\n01:17:15 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nThat was where he started. It's like I want to send a rocket to Mars and grow plants. People said huh. So he got together a guy named Jim Cantrell and a couple of others. They flew over to Russia to talk. The Russian military and this is, you know, late Said we want to buy a rocket. Let you know, solacea used, I see, be or not a use, sorry, decommissioned ICBM without the war bed.\n\n01:17:39 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThey're nice.\n\n01:17:41 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nNo, they have to use this to go to Mars and you know, in theory it could work if it took the long, slow route and the Russians didn't take them seriously and the general they were talking to actually and I've heard heard this now from two sources spat on issues and said get out of my office literally.\n\n01:17:57\n\nThat yep, like that. Wow, oh, thank you for vodka. So they on the plane back, cantrell and the other guy were kind of licking their wounds and Elon's in the seat behind them, I suppose still probably flying coach at this point, and he's working on on some plans on a napkin and he says, hey guys, we don't need the Russians, we could do this ourselves. And they're kind of rolling their eyes Going, oh, here goes Elon again. And then they looked at the figures and went, huh. So at that point he got some very smart people, a guy named Tom Mueller, gwynne Shotwell, who's currently his president. That's what he's so good at right is having this big idea, bringing in these really incredibly smart people and then Driving them to the end of their wits to get things done.\n\n01:18:41\n\nYeah, so that's how it started. And he actually started his rocket company two years later than Bezos did start his rocket company. And what we've seen so far is SpaceX basically dominate I mean literally revolutionized rocketry, dominate the global launch market. If it wasn't for SpaceX, the Chinese will be launching three times as many rockets as we do and make it relatively affordable. And you know, I like what Bezos is doing. But we keep seeing these factories being built there's. They just finished one at Kennedy a couple years ago Kennedy Space Center and all these trucks of supplies going in the front door and then we're waiting and nothing's coming out the back. That's like where are the rockets guys?\n\n01:19:20\n\nThat's those is is selling his rocket engines to United Launch Alliance for their rocket which is gonna launch the brand-new ones gonna launch on Christmas Eve.\n\n01:19:28 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo he is engaging in co-op atation there, sorry we used to have a wonderful guy the late, a great science fiction author, jerry Cornell, on our shows pretty regularly. Yeah, he was always a strong proponent of Commercial space exploration. He, you know as a wikipedia, describes him as a paleo conservative. I think that's fair, but as a paleo conservative, interest the government to do it. He thought that the if you really want to Explore space it's got to be commercial interests doing it, perhaps in in partnership with the federal government. And Elon's, I think, proven him right.\n\n01:20:10 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nWell, he's proven him right by I mean initially, when he wanted to get Air Force cargo, the Air Force said nice, try, kid, come back when you grow up. This is in the mid-2000s. And so to get his customer, he sued his customer. Wow, customer said oh, I guess we notice you now. So they gave him the work.\n\n01:20:30 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nBut wow, that's an unusual way of getting a job.\n\n01:20:33 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nIt's a very unusual path to that's so Elon isn't it? Well, it is. And and then, when NASA was Giving out contracts, they want to give out a couple of contracts to build a lunar lander for the Artemis program, which isn't trouble and Bezos sued because he didn't get the first bid, because Musk got it and, as a lot of people pointed out and observed in popular writing, myself included, hey, you, you know, you were trying to charge twice as much as SpaceX was going to do this, and he said, yeah, but it's not fair.\n\n01:21:04 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo now the US working, but there's a lot of stumbling now the US government's kind of over a barrel because they, oh they owe so much To Elon, because they've kind of for stopped doing so much Themselves. That Elon kind of he's SpaceX, runs a Starlink and they pretty much own this, you know, space-based internet, yeah it's. It's really an interesting conundrum. The government has seated its role to Elon Musk and now they're a little afraid.\n\n01:21:34 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nI Was nervous making my connection back from Vienna to be here for this show. Imagine being an astronaut up in the space station, dependent upon either Elon Musk or the Russians to get back home. Yeah, sir.\n\n01:21:45 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYeah, but you know, but you were not depending on Elon, were depending on SpaceX. It's a big company. There's a lot of smart people there and they're the only people who pulled it off. Boeing was supposed to be the other bunch that were going to build capsules to get astronauts back and forth the space station by 2016 and they still haven't done it once Not completely successfully so, and I don't want to type too much time, leo, but I did want to mention one of the stories of Recent months. It's kind of a big deal. Which hinges back on the SpaceX thing is we just got word from the government accountability office we're pretty good folks that surprise, surprise, contain your eye rolls. Nasa is not going to make their moon landing date of 2025. That we've all been pretending we believe for the last few years. What's weird about it? It's it's. That's not a shock, because if you grew up during the Apollo years, that was all running late to you know I it's a hard thing to do but but we're doing it a second time, right?\n\n01:22:41\n\nWell, that's true. So let's bear in mind. But what's slowing it down? Mostly, you know, the Orion capsule works. The SLS big rocket costs a fortune but it works.\n\n01:22:51\n\nBut the lander to get down to the moon, which is supposed to be of different versions of Starship, is A pacing item which is way behind schedule, somewhat because of the government itself, the FAA and Department of Fish and Wildlife not giving permits for him to launch, because we Wouldn't want to bonk any crocodiles on the head with rocket parts. But the other thing is they're having trouble getting new moon suits built because we haven't built a space suit in this country Other than those pressure suits that are just protect you if you get a leak that SpaceX makes. We haven't actually built an EVA suit since 1988, so the ones are using on the shuttle in the space station today are from the 80s. You're kidding. So that's become this major slowdown and it's like but wait, didn't you do this before? I saw it in the museum. But we've had so much brain drain and retirement that they're having to start over and it's a real problem.\n\n01:23:46 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nIt's amazing that the guy who's doing this Also seems to be well insane, at least in his social media.\n\n01:23:57 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nWalter Isaacson didn't say he was crazy, he just said he was kind of a an age. Yeah.\n\n01:24:04 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAnd Isaacson was on his side and can arguably be said that he was kind of writing a hagiography. So if, if Isaacson thought he was an a-hole, you can only imagine what he really was he?\n\n01:24:16 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nis he brilliant, or is he just Incredibly brash?\n\n01:24:21 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nHe's brilliant, brash and, I think, at times brutal. We've got to get that third B in there and loads of a brutal load for. I mean, you know, yeah, money buys a lot it doesn't it?\n\n01:24:33 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nif you have vision, or even if it's kind of crazy and you have billions, things happen. You know, maybe not the best things sometimes, but things happen. But what would drive?\n\n01:24:45 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\na person like that to go from I want to have a backup drive for humanity on another planet To buying Twitter. I still just don't get that.\n\n01:24:54 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nThis is Tess Braille.\n\n01:24:56 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nThis is the ego gone mad it's or or did he talk himself into it completely by accident, just by working off one day?\n\n01:25:04 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nHe's smarter than all the politicians. He's smarter than all mankind. This is part of of long-termism is that's humorous? I think they are the whoa in the extreme. They think they are the ones to use these resources best in the future of all humankind.\n\n01:25:19 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI also think that Elon Doesn't have much impulse control right. We're safe, we?\n\n01:25:26\n\nI think it's safe saying that apparently not, and and it's really very very impulsively Made an offer for Twitter, not expecting really that he would get it. And and then what? I think the fascinating story is that Brett what's his name, brett, last name, taylor, taylor, brett Taylor, who was at the time on the board of Twitter Really interesting guy. He's been at Google, he he started was it friends? Friends no, not friends to Another social network. He's a really interesting guy. Basically held Elon's feet to the fire and and forced him to Live up to his I think, very ill-planned promise. Then Elon had enough money and had enough context to be able to get forty four billion dollars together to buy it.\n\n01:26:16 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nI don't think he ever wanted it and now I love that we're no talking about a bond villain, and Steve is here with his green fingers. It's like oh little projection going on there.\n\n01:26:29 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nIt's a Zeus villain.\n\n01:26:30 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nOh, well played, sir.\n\n01:26:34 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nSo so there's a who villain. This may be a Useful or maybe may not something I learned on a podcast. It was one of the ringer podcast, where Ben Affleck was being interviewed, and I'm not going to get this exactly right, but it's close enough to be applicable. He said the problem with celebrity isn't Just that you lose your anonymity but you can't trust what you. You can't, you can't totally trust yourself Because you're not operating in the same reality as everybody else. Yeah, you're, you're detached. You're you're not walking the streets with, with the ordinaries and and Interacting with the real world. And I think that's what's happened to this guy. I think he's he's he's detached. He really, and Part of the evidence to me for that is that it isn't just that he does trolley things on Twitter, it's that he's repeating stuff that are that. He's doing no fact checking whatsoever, just none. He just he's just yet another right wing troll Seeing right wing trolls and repeating stuff that other people have. You know, he retweets or re-exes, apparently, you know icky stuff without really checking, you know, and that seems to me like it's, it's, it's weird and it's stupid and and. But I think it's it's because he's detached.\n\n01:27:55\n\nI think Bezos said a similar thing happened. I mean, jeff, I don't know, we used to go to conferences probably you too, I Leo, where you hang out with Jeff Bezos. He was, or gives it nice, is a nice guy. He laughed like Peewee Herman, but you know, but he was like a regular guy. You know I enjoy talking to him, not not much, but he was very approachable, you know, sensible, and now he's like all these guys you notice through. They all build up their muscles. Zuckerberg's done, do it, done it too. You know they have time, they have time, they money in the vanity.\n\n01:28:37\n\nYou know, and I know people who work for Metta who just think that that Zuckerberg is is also out there somewhere. What he did with the, with the virtual reality, is they spend like 40 billion dollars or whatever it was. Yeah, they came up with a goose egg you know, let us know.\n\n01:28:52 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nThese are all men. We on this panel of men must speak yeah truth about our gender. We're f'ing up the world. We've done it for centuries. I know it's time to hand it over.\n\n01:29:07 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nI agree, and at all, but it also it's got to be difficult that I'm not defending either of them. But who are they gonna turn to for the truth? I mean, at least Bezos Might be able to get some some straight pillow talk from from his. Are they married now? They're married right? Oh?\n\n01:29:23 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nI don't think so.\n\n01:29:24 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nThere's a big ring. There's a big rock.\n\n01:29:26 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:29:27 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI don't know if he's winning a game from his fiance.\n\n01:29:30 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nI'd say who the heck would Musk be able to ever talk to and who can talk to Musk? I mean, I'm not sure he's the best listener, but where do you go to get straight talk when people are either terrified of you or after your favor?\n\n01:29:42 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nYeah.\n\n01:29:45 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nAnd it's not at all clear that Elon wants straight talk. I mean he.\n\n01:29:49 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nYeah, he wants to believe what he wants to believe he really does think that he has all the answers.\n\n01:29:54 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nAnd you know, one of the things that we were just talking about, jeff, you were mentioning that it's you know, men who are running everything and screwing everything up. Force of personality goes a long way. There are a lot of people who you know they just don't want Something bad enough, they're not pushing, they're not screaming and jumping up and down and having a tantrum and demanding, and so when someone like Elon does the rest of us go like, okay, you know you want to go, do that, that's fine, you know so. So you know that the it very much seems that there's that there's a personality, raw personality, in addition to, yes, intellect and upbringing and everything. But there is a, a force that these people have that that is part of their long-term success look at Steve Jobs.\n\n01:30:49 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nI I mean no one says he was a wonderful, perfect, exacting, perfect right. You know, I think the other thing is that and social media has made this possible, youtube's over exposure of broadcast media and so forth we're all a little bit of good, a little bit of bad, and Maybe we, maybe we just seem curious. You know, Henry Ford was no hero. Oh my god. Thomas Edison was kind of a jerk, but we didn't maybe know that as much as we would now. Gutenberg was a good guy.\n\n01:31:29\n\nEverybody looks good five hundred years later. Are you kidding?\n\n01:31:33 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nCan I just mention one more thing about musk? I found it shocking, so I watched that whole hour and 15 minutes. I think of that New York Times Stage thing he did where he told his advertisers to go after themselves, oh my god when asked about his hard turn from being set or left to full right politically, he attributed that this is so childish.\n\n01:31:56\n\nI couldn't believe it. He attributed the whole thing to To losing face, although he didn't put it that way because he wasn't invited to the EV Fest by the Biden administration. Now I understand that that was because of union factors and it was not a good thing to do. It was not a smart thing to do for Biden. But really you're gonna completely change your political and social philosophy based on one snub.\n\n01:32:20 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nNever underestimate the power of vindictiveness. Look at the Oppenheimer movie, which is really all about just about vindictiveness. Strauss Oppenheimer shows up this guy Strauss, at a Senate hearing by saying oh, you know, you can make nuclear bombs out of donuts, you don't need to worry about isotopes. Strauss is so humiliated that he basically Completely destroys Robert Oppenheimer's reputation In a, in a kind of a kangaroo court, it's. It's really. The premise of the movie is how petty Vendictiveness can change the world. So never underestimate the power of pettiness.\n\n01:33:04 - Doc Searls (Guest)\n\nThat's my motto.\n\n01:33:11 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nAll right, maybe we'll take another break before we go on with our Christmas Eve, and I hope you all are with family and friends at this holiday season, are enjoying it, and we're so glad you could spend some time with us. We like to think of you as our family, that. One thing I've learned doing twit for 15 years Is really that podcasts are about community. They're about the people who not just talk, but the people who listen, and one of the things we've always tried to do On twit is to listen to you and to really let our community be a part of what we do. We're so glad we have you.\n\n01:33:49\n\nAs you probably have heard, we've been going through kind of a rough time, as as many others have. Spotify's had three stages of layoffs, as you were talking about doc this year, and some of the biggest podcast networks, like gimlet and the WN my see, have retreated. We want to keep doing we do, we love what we do, we love you, we love our community and we think we provide a service that's valuable, and we hope you think so too. So I'd like to invite you if if you are listening to this and you do value what we do at twit to help us continue to do it. We Really, to be honest, I don't want to beg, but we need your help to continue in 2024. There's a very easy way to do it and I think it's pretty inexpensive it's $7 a month to join club twit. It makes a big difference in our bottom line and, frankly, for us to survive in 2024, we need a lot more of you who listen to join.\n\n01:34:44\n\nRight now, it's just over 1% of our audience. If we could get to 5 or 10 percent of our audience, we wouldn't have to worry about finances, we could hire more people, we could do more shows, and I'd like to do that. I really would. So, in a way, this is your way of voting. If you want to hear more from us, if you like what we do and you want to continue, go to twittv slash club twit. Join club twits $7 a month, $84 a year. Their family plans, there's corporate plans, but your membership makes a huge difference these days to us Continuing and and we'd like to do that. So if you would and thanks in advance twittv, slash club twit We'll be back with more of the old farts.\n\n01:35:29\n\nAren't you glad you're listening In just a bit, this episode of our show brought to you by HID Global.

We're looking back at the year 2023 with five of us who've seen more than a few years go go by. Oh god, if you added it up it would really depress us.\n\n01:37:33\n\nSeveral centuries. You know what, though? We live in a youth culture, right? Who's the person of the year this year in Time Magazine? Taylor Swift. Right, oh, taylor.\n\n01:37:43 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nWho said Britney.\n\n01:37:45 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nWho said Britney?\n\n01:37:47 - Steve Gibson (Guest)\n\nAll these young ones.\n\n01:37:48 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nOh, they all see. He's really keeping up with the times, isn't he?\n\n01:37:53 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nThat's Joni Mitchell. She sure is.\n\n01:37:56 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nWe live in a youth culture, but I think it's really important, especially in an area that's so fast moving is technology to have the context that people like us, who've really seen the whole thing from the ground up Doc, you've been at the beginning. I was at the beginning, steve. You wrote a light pen interface for the Apple II computer. You were programming PDP-8s in high school. I mean, we've been through this. I don't know what you did when you were a kid, rod, but I hope it wasn't makeup.\n\n01:38:30 - Rod Pyle (Guest)\n\nYes, fortunately not Nothing good.\n\n01:38:33 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nSo, but I think the and I see this all the time that younger people really have no context for the world they're living in today. They forget that. You know, even 10 years ago and this was, by the way, this, I was reading this in this history of how AI got to where it is today, 10 years ago, we thought an online service that could tell whether that was a cat on YouTube was pretty good. If it got 16% right, we thought, wow, ai is really coming along. We've seen a lot, and I think there's some real value to getting together I hope you think so too with the people who've seen it all to give you some context of what's been happening.\n\n01:39:17 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nWhen Douglas Rushkoff and I taught a course a year ago and reinvented the internet, we realized at some point that the students were younger than the web.\n\n01:39:26 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\nYeah, is that amazing?\n\n01:39:27 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nDouglas had, and they were master students, by the way, douglas had to do a lecture on. You know what was what was chat? What was the early internet? What was a dial-up motive? What was bit-naped screens? Is there a?\n\n01:39:42 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nvalue guys, is it?\n\n01:39:43 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\njust nostalgia, jeff, or is there a value?\n\n01:39:47 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nto understand where we came from. No, this is in my next book out next year. The web we weave. What I argue is that's what we want to recapture. We lost it. We lost it to the in certification or corporatization or scaling of our net. We gave up. There are some of us didn't? Doc Searles is still an open source and Dave Weiner is an open source, but Schmuck's like me. It's okay. Twitter, I'll move my conversation over there. What?\n\n01:40:14 - Leo Laporte (Host)\n\na mistake that turned out to be public discourse.\n\n01:40:16 - Leo's Laptop Audio (Other)\n\nYeah, right to be vulnerable.\n\n01:40:19 - Jeff Jarvis (Guest)\n\nWe've got to recapture that early web and that early internet and its optimism, not the stupidity. We've learned a lot of lessons since then. You k"
