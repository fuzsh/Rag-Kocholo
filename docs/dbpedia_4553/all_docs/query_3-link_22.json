Leo Laporte is still Yes, on vacation.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:02:16):\n\nMust be nice <laugh>,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:17):\n\nBut worry not because if you're listening, then you just heard the, what is it?\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:02:23):\n\n<laugh>\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:23):\n\nYes. Of Scott Wilkinson.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:02:25):\n\nHey. Hi Mikah. How you doing, man?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:28):\n\nI'm doing well. We have you here in studio.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:02:30):\n\nThank you. I'm so happy to be here. This is just really great. I missed it.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:33):\n\nAw. Well, I am glad to have you here with us. And I am looking forward to this episode because I know a lot of people are always kind of curious about their home theater setups, about helping other people with their home theater setups and everything in between. And then this is, this is what you do, this is what you know,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:02:53):\n\nThis is, this is my area of expertise and I'm so happy to share it with as many people as I can. Anybody who needs help, I'm willing to help 'em.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:03:00):\n\nThat's awesome. And of course, this is the show where people can call in, write in email, in, in some cases Messenger pigeon in <laugh>, their, their support requests. If you are looking to call in, it's at call.twitch.tv. We suggest you go there on your smartphones. If you do, then you will get a little popup that says, Hey, let me join you to this Zoom call. And then depending on whether you have the Zoom app installed or if you just want to do it via the web you're able to take that call. We suggest doing it on a smartphone because you've already got the webcam and this and the microphone. We're all right there. So it makes for a really good sounding, really good looking call. But if you are a little camera shy, don't worry. You can just call us with your voice as well. Again, call dot twit tv and you just keep the video off. And of course, we always take questions atg@twitch.tv, so you can send in those questions. We've got a few of those as well. But as we typically do, we're going to start the show off with a little bit of a, we, we've called it the Sermon <laugh>.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:04:09):\n\nIt's fairly beloved.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:10):\n\nWe are gathered here today, <laugh>, to talk about televisions.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:04:15):\n\nTelevisions my favorite subject.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:18):\n\nYeah. So you had the opportunity to check out was this one of the latest, greatest technologies that's available. How, tell, tell me first, where did you go? <Laugh>? What is this\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:04:29):\n\nTv?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:30):\n\nWhat's\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:04:30):\n\nGoing on? Well, I actually went over to Leo La Port's house.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:34):\n\nOh, okay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:04:35):\n\nHe recently bought the second generation of the newest flat panel technology. Okay. it's from Samsung. Two companies are producing this type of tv. Samsung and Sony both have introduced. Second generation Samsung's is out, Sony's is not yet. So Leah went ahead and bought the Samsung. They, this year they came out with a larger size. It came you last year, it was 55 inch, 65 inch. Now they're offering an in addition, a 77 inch. He wanted to replace his a hundred inch ultra short throw projector mm-hmm. <Affirmative> as his main TV in his living room. And 77 inches is quite a bit smaller than a hundred. Yes. <laugh>.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:05:17):\n\nSo why would someone make that that choice?\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:05:19):\n\nWell, because the QD ole, which, which is the name of the technology is quite a bit brighter. Ah. And so if you wanna watch in a room with light in it and this is particularly appropriate for like Super Bowl parties or some, some large gatherings then it's, it's gonna be better. Plus it renders high dynamic range content much more effectively than any projector.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:05:47):\n\nOh, okay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:05:48):\n\nOkay. So he sacrificed some size in order to get these other advantages.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:05:53):\n\nNow, with, with the that change as well is, is a projector as good at sort of, well in, in the current technology, is it as good at refresh rates as just a, a straight up panel? I mean, can I, for example, cuz you know, if you, if you take a computer and you plug it into a, a television monitor that's not the latest and greatest Right. And you're moving your mouse across the screen, it kind of\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:06:17):\n\nTakes forever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:19):\n\nAre are short throw projectors up to snuff? Can you game on a short throw\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:06:23):\n\nProjector? Yes, you can. Yeah, you absolutely can. No, I'm not a gamer. I'll, I'll be the first to admit that. So I'm not up on all of the gaming parameters. I,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:32):\n\nI thought you and Joanna played Call of Duty together.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:06:34):\n\n<Laugh> thanks. Sadly not. No. Okay. Now but for the most part, short, ultra short throw projectors, modern ones are up on the latest gaming. For example, I think I have to look this up now, but I think they probably have something called variable refresh rate, which certainly the Samsung does, which is important in gaming because sometimes there's a lot of fast action and you want a fast refresh rate, and sometimes it's more slow and you don't need that fast refresh rate. And so a variable refresh rate takes, takes advantage of that. But which TV programs and movies and so on, they're at a constant frame rate. So u s t projectors and regular projectors, modern ones have a have some gaming features like these on\n\nMikah Sargent (00:07:21):\n\n'Em. Okay. another question between the two mm-hmm. <Affirmative> what, what in theory lasts longer? Is it short? Is an ultra short throw projector because of the, the nature of its technology more likely to die out before the TV does or vice versa?\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:07:37):\n\nMm, no, they're, they have roughly these, well, lemme put it this way, an ultra short throat projector, which uses as its illumination source lasers. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, as Leo would say, lasers <laugh> have roughly the same lifespan. Okay. It'd be 20,000 to 30,000 hours of, of, of actual operation. Okay. And that's more or less the same for o led TVs, qd O led TVs LCD TVs, and 20,000 hours, as I recall, at eight hours a day is something like eight years or something. Oh, wow.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:08:12):\n\nOkay. Okay. So the life of a a TV before you tend to buy new one anyway.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:08:17):\n\nExactly. Exactly. So anyway, Leo's new TV is from Samsung. It's called the S 95 C. Okay. And Samsung and Sony both do this thing where they put a letter at the end, which indicates the year, the model year. So, so c C is 2023 in Samsung speak. Okay. It's, and in, in Sony speak, it's k Uhhuh <affirmative>. They don't talk to each other, but they somehow came up with the same notion. Even in more interesting, the Sam, the Sony QD O led this new technology is a 95 has 95 in the model number. So it's 95 K for Sony, 95 C for Samsung, which gets a little confusing. Yeah. I'm gonna do a, a, a Home Theater Geeks podcast on model numbers sometime, because I just think that how do they come up with these model numbers?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:09:04):\n\nYeah. And it's an easy way to decode too, if you are looking for sort of you, you're shopping and you see these different models to be able to quickly go, okay, that means this one came out this year, cor. Correct.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:09:15):\n\nThat's, that's nice if you can decode it. Yeah. It's, it's actually useful information. It's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:09:18):\n\nLike a VIN for a car,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:09:20):\n\n<Laugh>. Right? Exactly. Yes, <laugh>. Yeah, exactly. So this new technology is called QD od. Now we've heard of OD Oles been around for a while, organic light emitting diode mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. And it, it, it is, in my opinion, the best TV technology out there because each pixel actually each subpixels, each red, green and blue subpixels emits its own light. Wow. as opposed to an L C D TV where you have a backlight that just blasts light through another layer of L C D subpixels that dim or brighten that close or open, they're sometimes called shutters mm-hmm. <Affirmative> to let more or less light through, but they can't close down to let no light through. There's always some light getting through. And so it's very difficult to get a really deep black level, which to me is a really critically important part of picture quality. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> but with an O O L E D since it's emitting its own light, it can be brought down to zero, so it's black, and that makes for a beautiful picture. Now, QD O LED is, is the addition of a technology called quantum dots.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:10:32):\n\nOkay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:10:34):\n\nWhich these are microscopic particles that emit their own light. If they ex, if they can rece, if they receive, say blue light, a blue photon mm-hmm. <Affirmative> of light, they will absorb it and then re emit a lower frequency, a lower, a longer wavelength, lower frequency photon of green or red. Okay. And which, and, and they can be very precisely controlled the size of these little tiny spheres. And the size determines what wavelength of light they emit. So you make one of a certain size, it, it accepts a blue photon, it emits a green photon, you make one a little bigger, it accepts a blue photon and emits a red photon. Mm. So this is a very efficient means of light production, more so even than olet. So they can get brighter than Olet and they can, they can have a wider color range than regular olet even. So my next TV is gonna be a qd olet <laugh>, no doubt about it.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:11:37):\n\nSo that's, when you say it, it does a better job with H D R? Correct. That's because of the wider range\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:11:43):\n\nAnd the brighter Got it. And the, okay. The\n\nMikah Sargent (00:11:45):\n\nBrighter peak, this high dynamic range. Right, right.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:11:47):\n\nRight. Correct. Brighter peak brightness and greater color range. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Exactly. So I got to thanks to Leo. Thanks Leo. He let me come into his house and look at his tv. And I, I did some initial, I only had a couple hours with it, so I did some initial settings and so on. He actually had it set up pretty well. Okay. I was very impressed actually, that he had selected the movie picture mode. Oh. Why do you suggest that one? Well, because when a TV comes out of the box, it's generally in what, it's generally in a much brighter, more garish mode. Got it. Like a vivid mode to really catch someone's top, to really catch somebody's eye. But that's not accurate. I'm all about reproducing the artist's intent. Yep. Right. So what were they looking at when they were creating the content?\n\n(00:12:46):\n\nAnd there's a very specific set of standards that, that their monitor follows mm-hmm. <Affirmative> that they've set up their monitor to follow. And so what I recommend to people who have a TV at home is to set it up with those same standards. Yeah. Because that way they will see it as the director intended. And Leo already did that. He picked the, the movie picture mode. He selected the, there's a variety of color temperatures that you can set the TV at. He's selected in Samsung's case, the most accurate one is called Warm two. Warm. I love that. Again, it's just, it just depends on the television. Yeah, exactly. Other, other manufacturers call it something else. Yeah. But it's generally the warmest, because normally they'll, they'll say the color temperature will be cool, standard or neutral, uhhuh and warm. And you might think, oh, well, I'd, I'd want standard or neutral.\n\n(00:13:36):\n\nNo, you don't because it's just gonna be too blue and so warm typically is the most accurate. And at first you pull a TV out of a box, you turn it on, you go, oh wow. That's just, that's just knocks me over the head. So you set the movie picture mode, and then you go and you set, you go select the warm color temperature, and you go, oh, that looks kind of, kind of seepy tone. Yeah. By comparison, Uhhuh <affirmative>, it does live with it for a while. You know, just try to live with it for a while, and very soon it won't look that way anymore. And green grass will look like grass. Blue sky will look like sky. People will look flesh tone <laugh> accurate. Not this garish. I mean, if you put it on on blue, green grass won't look right. Sky will look too blues.\n\n(00:14:28):\n\nPeople will look f you know, very ped uhhuh <affirmative>. So these are the things that I recommend people do, and Leo already did 'em. Cool. So he's kudos to him. He, he really did a good job. Now, one thing I will say, Leo you have your speakers, he has a set of speakers Yes. Surrounding the tv Tenon elac. Elac, that's right. Yeah. Which are very nice speakers. Really nice. But he has the, the center speaker, which is a very important speaker cuz that's where all the dialogue comes from. He has it amounted on the wall where it was for the a hundred inch screen. Yes. It's now too, too high on the wall for the 77 inch screen. He needs to move it down, because when people are talking on camera and you hear their voices coming from up here, that's not, that's not realistic. It's, it's, you want the voices and the sounds to be coming from where they look like they're coming on the screen as much as possible. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So all I can say is Leo moved down that, that center channel speaker, you'll be golden. Mm-Hmm.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:15:34):\n\n<Affirmative>. So that was the only thing that really needed changing. Was there other visual settings that\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:15:39):\n\nWell, no, the visual settings were actually pretty good. I, I'll tell you a problem I had though. The only disc player Leo has is an Xbox Series X. Okay. Okay. And it does play disks. And I brought along a setup disc because I wanted to see, well, did he have his brightness set correctly? Did he have his contrast set correctly? The, there are a couple problems with a Xbox X as a disc player. The most important one that I ran into was, it doesn't send, this is gonna get pretty geeky here. That's fine. That's fine. That's what this is for. This is what this is for here. It does not send what's called below black <laugh> <laugh> <laugh> below black. Below black. That's the name of my nightclub. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So in TV land brightness is represented by numbers, right? I mean, it's all digital. Right? So in eight bit brightness, you go from zero to 2 55. Okay. That's the, that's the total maximum range. But in TV land black is defined as 16. So it's a little bit above zero. Okay. And peak white is defined as 2 35, a little below the actual maximum. Wow.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:17:01):\n\nI had, I didn't know about this.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:17:02):\n\nSo the so when you set up an, and here's another really weird thing, and I don't think I ever really understood it completely. When you set up a TV's brightness control, which, speci, which controls black level mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, and the contrast control, which controls the white level, you wanna set it so that you don't see black below 16.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:17:27):\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:17:29):\n\nBut you do wanna set it, so you see white above 2 35. And the reason is there's, there's never any content below 16 in a video signal. But there sometimes is above 2 35, for example sports will often have white above 2 35. Do you remember the movie fifth Element? Yeah. Bruce Willis. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> <laugh>. There's a, there's a scene where the, there's a waiter serving drinks, and his white jacket actually has content above 2 35. Really? Yeah. So there are certain examples of that. Anyway, to set brightness properly, you want to be able to see below black. So that, and, and the test pattern that I used from a disc called U H D H D R Benchmark. Okay. This is a, a setup disc you can buy on Amazon for like 30, 40 bucks, something like that. And I brought one, it's a U H d Blu-ray, 4K Blu-ray, and I put it in there. And the brightness pattern that you put up in order to set the brightness control it, it has below black in it. Okay. And so you set the brightness control to the point where you can, you just barely can't see it. The Xbox Series X does not send below black, it's limited. Oh,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:18:55):\n\nNo. So, and you're looking at it, you\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:18:57):\n\nCan't see the below black, so you can't set the brightness control properly. Now, I did some research and I found that it, it is possible to set the Xbox Series X to what's called PC rrgb mode, which goes zero to 2 35. Got it. But they, they put up all these warnings. You are you sure you wanna do thi you don't really wanna do this to you <laugh>, no, no, no. You really shouldn't do this. And you say, yes, I wanna do it. And they go, are you absolutely sure you wanna do this? Yes, yes, yes. I have like three times say, yes, I wanna do this. And the weird thing that I don't understand, and I'm gonna have to do some research on it, is even when I did it, I still couldn't see the below black.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:19:38):\n\nOh, wow.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:19:39):\n\nSo it's possible that the Samsung TV does not display below black. I, I have to do some research on that. I don't really know. So I set the brightness control as best I could. Yeah. Without seeing the below black. I, it's unfortunate.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:19:55):\n\nInterestingly the new PlayStation when you, because what you're describing there sounded familiar to me mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, when you turn on H D R on the PlayStation five, it has one of those, it says it shows a white background with this sort of light gray sun in the middle of it. Okay. And it says adjust it so that the, the, the icon can barely be seen mm-hmm. <Affirmative> mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. And then it does it with the dark side. Yep. It's black, and then there's like a dark, dark, dark gray sun and you're supposed to adjust it so that, so\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:20:28):\n\nYou can't really see that that that thing. Okay.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:20:30):\n\nIt kinda reminds me of what you're talking about there with that separate dvd V d right. Or\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:20:34):\n\nBlu-Ray. Well, it's nice that the PlayStation has a built-in calibrator, calibrator sort of adjuster optimizer. Let's, let's call it, cause calibration is a different thing mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. But it's in along the same lines, but it's even more involved. Involved. Yes, exactly. Requires a lot of equipment training. It's, it's not a, in a simple thing, not a trivial thing. But I wish the Xbox had that. That'd be awesome.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:02):\n\nYeah. I thought that was a really cool thing that Sony had considered in, in helping you set it up so that it looked as it was supposed\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:21:09):\n\nTo. The other thing I will say <laugh>, I got there and I tried to play the disc and it wouldn't play. Turns out Leo had not downloaded the Blu-Ray player app <laugh> into the\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:21):\n\nXbox or the Xbox. Oh\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:21:23):\n\nBoy. So I, I had a couple of rounds with Anthony Nielsen, Uhhuh <affirmative>, a producer on home theater geeks who has an Xbox X. And he led me to that. Well, maybe does it have the app in it? I don't know. So I found it and I downloaded it, and then I was able to play the disc. How\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:40):\n\nDo you, where do you stand in terms of physical Blu-ray versus streaming? Because it does seem like these days a lot of us are streaming content. Absolutely. Even, even if you take the moment to download the content and then play it back. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's all just the digital, there's, there's a benefit to Blu-ray though.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:21:59):\n\nThere is. Okay. There is it's, it's simply the highest quality image you're gonna get. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, streaming is getting a lot better. There's no question about it, because compression is getting a lot better. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but it's still compressed more than a Blu-ray. And so if you're a video file like I am, you wanna see the best possible quality. Yeah. And the best possible quality is from a physical disc. Right. Just no way around it. Not to mention there are extras. I mean, if you're a real fan of the content and you want to see, you know, an interview with the stars or an interview with the director, or you know, making hide the scenes in making of that kind of thing you're not gonna really get that on streaming you, but you will on a disc. Another thing that really bugs me about streaming, which I don't know if there's anything can be done about it, is that streaming companies can giveth and they can Yes. Take us\n\nMikah Sargent (00:22:56):\n\nAway and boy do they. And\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:22:58):\n\nThey do. And it bugs the hell out of me. Yep. That I, I get these emails all the time. Oh, you better watch this movie on, on H B O before it disappears next week. What? With a disk? Yes. You have to store it. It's physical, you have to get up and you have to put it in a thing, but it's there forever. You have it, you can watch it whenever you want. You don't have to worry about the company, you know, making it go away because their rights agreement expired.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:23:27):\n\nRight. They're not gonna come into your house and take your blue. They're\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:23:29):\n\nNot gonna come into your house and take your blueray. No. Yeah. So that's another reason I I like discs.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:23:36):\n\nYeah, that makes sense. That makes\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:23:37):\n\nSense. Now streaming is much more convenient. No question about it. You know, cuz you can just go and find some content and a lot more content you can find than you probably have disks.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:23:48):\n\nYes. And the discs take up\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:23:50):\n\nSpace. And they take up space. You gotta have storage for 'em. Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:23:53):\n\nThat makes sense. Anything else you wanna say about the TV or experience with it before we do take a little break?\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:23:58):\n\nSure. well, just that it looks fantastic. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it just looks great. I watched some of the what's called demo material on the U H D H D R Blu-Ray. It's, oh, it's called U H D HD R Benchmark. Right. and he, the creators of that disc are two guys. Stacy Spears and Don Munsell. Both video scientists worked for Microsoft for a while. Stacy, I think now works for Red Digital Cinema. They make digital cinema cameras really, really fine ones. And he knows his stuff. They both do just backwards and forwards. And so they shot some footage in 4k, H d r and that TV just looks awesome. Yeah. Really awesome. So when the time comes, I will tell you this, I'm probably gonna get the Sony version of it rather than the Samsung. Okay. And the reason is one reason only Samsung does not support Dolby vision.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:24:57):\n\nOh, that's right. Yes.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:24:58):\n\nAnd don't support Dolby Vision. H D R. And interestingly, the Xbox Series X supports Doy vision for gaming and streaming, but not discs. Oh wow. Isn't that weird? That's very weird. It's weird. I don't get it. Why\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:16):\n\nDon't it a, a licensing thing, it seems,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:25:17):\n\nI guess, but they already have the license for gaming and streaming, so why not just add discs? Huh. It doesn't make any sense to me anyway. The Samsung does not support Samsung as a company. Yeah. Does not support Dolby vision. None of their TVs\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:31):\n\nDo. What is it that they\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:25:32):\n\nHave? Oh, they have HDR 10 plus.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:36):\n\nYep.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:25:37):\n\nAnd I could go into what's the difference between, well, HDR 10 plus and Dolby Vision are very similar, I'll just say, because they use dynamic metadata, whereas the baseline HD R format called HDR 10 uses static metadata, dynamic metadata is much better. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And there's a lot of content and Dolby Vision, a lot of content. Yes. So I wanna be able to render it on my TV as it was intent. Mm-Hmm.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:03):\n\n<Affirmative>, that's what it's, that's what it boils down to, right? Yeah, exactly. You want to see it as much as possible close to the bare metal, essentially as you possibly can. Right, right.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:26:11):\n\nPrecisely.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:12):\n\nOkay. Alright. Let's take a quick break here on Ask the Tech Guys this week with Scott Wilkinson. I remind you you can head to call.twit.tv to get an answer. And we would love to take your call live on air. Looks like we've got a few people lined up and waiting, so we will get to those momentarily. But I do wanna tell you about a new sponsor here on Ask the Tech Guys. It's Ag One by Athletic Greens. Now I gotta tell you, like so many other people out there, you, you know, I, I wanted to find some ways to support my health <laugh> without having to add a bunch of vi I can think of my great-grandparents who every morning my great-grandma would get ready with her and my great-grandpa just vitamin after vitamin after vitamin after Vitamin <laugh> loading up the, the table with the all these vitamins.\n\n(00:27:07):\n\nOh man, it, you know, you, you end up sacrificing your taste buds. If you go with some of those weird mixes that are out there, or just having to take a bunch of pills. It, it, it gets troublesome with Ag One by Athletic Greens, I'm able to give my body what it craves all in one daily nutritional drink. So, let's talk about AG one a little bit. Ag One was founded in 2010 and has been part of millions of routines since AG One is the best all in one solution for daily nutrition, it'll save you time, it'll save you confusion. Which ones am I supposed to be taking? Which do I leave behind? It'll save you money because each serving costs less than $3 a day. Individual supplements can quickly add up. And Ag One's Daily Habit gives you these powerful long-term results. Because if all you do is you mix up your beverage, you drink it in the morning, then you don't have to remember every single time, oh, did I take this?\n\n(00:28:05):\n\nOh, did I not? Oh, which of these was I supposed? It's so much simpler. Ag One makes it easier for you to take the highest quality supplements, whether it's improving digestion, supporting your sleep, ag one is the best bang for your buck. It's a seamless, easy daily habit. Just one scoop of that AG One in the morning covers your entire day's nutritional bases. And I love that you can get all your supplements, you can support your long-term gut health with AG one s 75 high quality minerals, vitamins, pre, and probiotics. You know, I, I, I thought about this cuz they sent us some AG one and just the idea of in this, this mix, being able to sort of have this together. You know, you, you, you put it in some water, you mix it up, and you're getting all of those vitamins.\n\n(00:28:54):\n\nYou're meant to kind of take it in the morning before breakfast so that you get the best absorption possible. But what's great about it is instead of kind of taking these individual supplements, having it as, as sort of a, a full focused start to your day it seems to make all the difference for me. I've been, you know, drinking this each morning and also using they have this great vitamin D, vitamin K sort of tincture. And between those, these are the, the vitamins and minerals that I wanted to make sure I was getting every day. And now I don't have to think about it before I actually do it. Athletic Greens is also a climate neutral certified company. They believe that good nutrition should be available to all. And I love this for every purchase they donate to organizations helping to get nutritious food to kids in need.\n\n(00:29:47):\n\nSo while you're feeling good inside, you can feel good also inside, I guess technically <laugh> <laugh> feel good in your heart and in your gut because you know that you're also supporting others. And the story behind this is great too. The guy who founded the company was having all these issues feeling very worn out getting sick a lot, and basically through a bunch of different tests was told that his gut health was out of whack and it was resulting in him not properly absorbing nutrients as he needed to. And so it resulted in him spending so much money every single day just to get the nutrients he needed. He said, there's gotta be a better way to do this. And that is AG one by Athletic Greens. And for a person like me who I kind of, I have, I, I struggle with the idea that like, I have to eat to stay alive.\n\n(00:30:40):\n\nI wish that that wasn't the case. I love to enjoy food, but the fact that I have to eat to stay alive, that it's not just this thing I get to do cuz it's fun, bothers me. And so I oftentimes will forget, oh, you know, you need to eat something. So at least knowing I'm getting those vitamins and minerals and everything that I need at the start of the day and then going throughout my day, it just, it, it works for me. It all just makes sense. A sense it clicks in my head. If you're looking for a simpler and cost effective supplement routine, ag one by Athletic Greens is giving you, this is Wild. A free one year supply of Vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. So go to athleticgreens.com/techguy, that's athleticgreens.com/techguy, T E C H G U Y, check it out and you know, get that offer free one year supply of Vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.\n\n(00:31:36):\n\nIt's so worth it. Especially as you know, the pandemic has kept a lot of us indoors, maybe not getting all of the vitamin D all the sunlight we we're meant to be getting. So you can get that back on track with Ag One by Athletic Greens. Alright, we are back from the break. And I believe it is time to take a call. We've got someone with video John, if we want to go I, I'm not able to see their name on screen, so if we can also enable that setting so I can figure out, I think it says Cliff is what I'm reading from here. So we'll bring Cliff on air and Cliff will join us momentarily and then we'll be able to get their question. All right. Cliff, are you with us?\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:20):\n\nI am. Nice to talk to both of you.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:32:22):\n\nNice to talk to you too. Where are you calling from?\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:25):\n\nCalling from Goleta, California, otherwise known as Paradise\n\nMikah Sargent (00:32:29):\n\n<Laugh> not\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:32:30):\n\nEast. I, I spent a summer at U C S B in my junior year between my junior and junior years in high school and spent a lot of time in Goleta. Beautiful place.\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:38):\n\nYeah. Scott, I'm surprised you ever left because once you graduate from U C S B, almost everybody does anything they can to stay here.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:32:44):\n\nWell, I went to U C S C in Santa Cruz Okay. For my college. And in fact recently moved back there because that's where I really wanted. That's your paradise. That's my paradise. Exactly.\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:58):\n\nExactly.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:32:59):\n\nAlright. Right. So how can we help you? I,\n\nCaller 1 (00:33:01):\n\nYeah, I called particularly when Scott, you're on the call because I currently have a vio mm-hmm. <Affirmative> series I got about five years ago. And and it keeps locking up freezing. It's been doing it for years. I've just been too lazy to replace it. <Laugh>. Oh. I turned it off and on, but now I see last week I was with my brother-in-law watching the Masters golf tournament and he has od Hmm. And I'm like, wow, OD really is a lot better.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:33:28):\n\nIt is. No question about it.\n\nCaller 1 (00:33:31):\n\nAnd that's, and that's my question is, you know Costco has a great lg or it has an LG for a reasonable price. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 77 for $2,700. I sit about 13 feet away from my, from my tv. So that's my question. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> 77 I think is funny. Big enough, even though I could go bigger. <Laugh> is, is that the right tv? I mean, I'm willing to spend more. They have a three series that's 3,400. But I guess that's my question. What in your recommendation would be the I'm happy Sony, lg, Samsung, but I want big and I'm now going with oed. Yeah. So what is your basic suggestion?\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:34:10):\n\nWell, my basic suggestion is you're sitting 13 feet away, so 77 inches is you, you could go bigger. Yeah, the optimum range to screen size, the screen size is bigger than you think. So, you know, you could go with 83 70 seven's. Okay. It's, you know, it's fine. I'm, I'm gonna be in my new home. I'm going to be probably getting a 77 because that's as big as the Sony cut goes. And I'm gonna be sitting about eight feet away and that's even, that's not quite big enough. But I'm gonna live with it <laugh>, so to speak. But in terms of your situation, definitely O LED's the way to go it really produces a gorgeous picture better than any L C D in my opinion. And Costco does have 'em for good prices. I generally, I don't know about, do you remember whether the Costco is the B2 or the c2?\n\nCaller 1 (00:35:14):\n\nIt is. If you gimme half a sec, I'll look it up. Alright. So it is the LG 77. It is c2. Yep. And then the 3,400 is the c3.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:35:23):\n\nOkay. So the c3, here's another example of model numbers. LG did it better. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, C2 is the 2022 models. Oh, C3 is the 2023 models. Yes. And so Sure. Get the c3, get the, you know, if you can afford it, get the later, get the later model. You're not gonna be unhappy with the c2. I have been recommending the C2 all last year. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> if that's what was available. And it's the most cost effective. LG olet, they have more expensive ones. They have the G series. And the G three actually has some a new technology that is very exciting, I would consider it myself where they've greatly brightened the ole output and using something called a micro lens array. Ooh. M l a where each pixel has a tiny little lens in front of it, ah, which actually increases the brightness along with the processing that they've added to it. There you're starting to get into some serious money. I forget what it was exactly, the G three is gonna be, but for most people, the C2 or the c3. Wonderful. Wonderful. You're gonna be super happy with that. Just make sure you go into the picture menu and select the movie mode or cinema. I forget what LG calls it. And that should should make it more accurate as I was talking about earlier. And man <laugh> 77 inch c2, that's, or c3. That'll be awesome. <Laugh>.\n\nCaller 1 (00:37:02):\n\nAll right. So now talking about a bigger one. Do you have any general recommendations if I do decide to go bigger? Cause I've been thinking about it, but I recognize the ole, you know, once you start getting, even in the seventies and certainly the eighties. So price just seems Yeah,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:37:16):\n\nTed goes up quite a bit. Yeah, that's true. That is true. Well do you does the I, for, I don't, I think the C2 comes in in 83. I'd have to, you\n\nCaller 1 (00:37:30):\n\nKnow, I don't know. I'd have, i'd I could easily look cuz I just, right now Costco's literally a mile away from me. Again, I live in Paradise.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:37:37):\n\nYeah, exactly. Exactly. Costco's close by <laugh>. That is great. That's one definition of Paradise. Costco down the street, <laugh>,\n\nCaller 1 (00:37:45):\n\nI've got the beach, I've got the bluff. All,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:37:48):\n\nAll, all in one Uhhuh. I've got golf. Scooter X in the chat room is saying LG 83 c3 bun with an Allstate Fi three year protection plan for, what did he say it was? 4200 4300 bucks. I'll look for that. So yeah, it's okay. It's, if you got the money, if you have the budget for an 83, I would say at 13 feet away, I would say absolutely. Okay. Absolutely. All right. Now another thing about that though is are, are you gonna mount it on the wall?\n\nCaller 1 (00:38:27):\n\nYes.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:38:28):\n\n<Laugh> mounting an 83 inch TV on the wall is not a trivial exercise. Are you gonna have some pay somebody to do it professionally or are you gonna do it yourself?\n\nCaller 1 (00:38:38):\n\nNo, I'm mounted the 70. I have a 73 right now.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:38:41):\n\nOh, and you mounted it up there yourself?\n\nCaller 1 (00:38:43):\n\nYeah, it was just me and a buddy. I put the bracket up. It's, you know, as\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:38:47):\n\nLong, make sure it's anchored into studs <laugh>, because an 83 gonna be really heavy.\n\nCaller 1 (00:38:55):\n\nAnd that's, and that's why you know, I've got the right bracket. You can normally get them at Costco, not to keep promoting Costco, but it's just convenient. Get the right brackets, it's in studs. And then I just use two people to carefully put it up there not holding the holding the frame and not,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:39:11):\n\nNot the screen. Don't touch the screen. Well, you know, you can wipe off the screen.\n\nCaller 1 (00:39:16):\n\nYeah. But no, I'm, I'm inclined to look Now the scooter said, and Scooter X said the one is only 4,000 and some\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:39:23):\n\n<Laugh>. Yeah. 4,300 bucks for the C2 83 inch, you know, Hey, if you can, if you can swing it at, at that, at the distance you're at, that, that would just be awesome. <Laugh>.\n\nCaller 1 (00:39:36):\n\nYeah. I think I think that's a good suggestion. I mean, I'm, I like lg, Sony, all of them. Sure. But to have a suggestion, LG seems to be a reasonable price.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:39:44):\n\nI'll tell you this also, the Sony will be more expensive\n\nCaller 1 (00:39:47):\n\nOkay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:39:48):\n\nFor, for equivalent for an equivalent tv.\n\nCaller 1 (00:39:51):\n\nAnd I, and I'll tell you, I have a surround sound five clips. I've had 'em for years.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:39:56):\n\nVery nice. So\n\nCaller 1 (00:39:57):\n\nLovely. Yeah. All the all the accessories are underneath the mounted tv. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the speaker, the center speakers right in the center.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:06):\n\nExcellent. Close to the screen.\n\nCaller 1 (00:40:09):\n\nYeah. I listened to you. Yeah, it's right underneath the screen.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:11):\n\nExcellent.\n\nCaller 1 (00:40:12):\n\nExcellent. It worked out well,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:13):\n\nSo Sounds great. Matt.\n\nCaller 1 (00:40:14):\n\nI yeah, I you may hear back from me in a little while asking for some more advice on, on getting the best picture out of it. So,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:23):\n\nWell, I've got my new podcast or my reinstated podcast here on the Twit Network Home Theater Geeks. I've been talking lately about how to do exactly that, so check it out.\n\nCaller 1 (00:40:34):\n\nYeah. I've you know, actually I was going, ah, do I need to join? Do I need to join? And not to make your head swell. I was like, Scott's joined. I need to Ajo\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:43):\n\n<Laugh>. Thank you, Scott\n\nCaller 1 (00:40:47):\n\n<Laugh>. Mike, I already listened to you for free. You can Yeah, Leo, on this show. So I, I don't need to join except for Scott, so God, I\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:40:56):\n\nOh, that's, that is so gratifying. Thank you so much.\n\nCaller 1 (00:41:00):\n\nMy pleasure. Take care. Thanks for the thanks for the answer. You\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:41:03):\n\nBet.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:41:03):\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you for the call.\n\nCaller 1 (00:41:05):\n\nTake care.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:41:06):\n\nAll righty. We've got some more calls. We will go to an email question before we come back and take a few more calls. Okay. From the Zoom Jerry has written in and says in the news, now the F B I is warning against using u sb charging ports at public spaces like airports.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:41:28):\n\nOh, no, I\n\nMikah Sargent (00:41:29):\n\nRecall. There are U USB charging cables that don't carry data, and I was wondering if those are safety use and also, what are they called so that I can search for them? This is a great question. This is, I don't know the answer to this. Yeah. So this is a, a really good re a really good question. And it's something that Steve Gibson on, on security now and Leo have been talking about for quite some time. Uhhuh <affirmative> you should be careful when you are going to a public place and they have some form of, of charging available because there are different devices that can be installed that depending on how your phone is set up, depending on what version of the operating system you have installed and all these other different aspects, when you plug that device in, it could potentially take information from you.\n\n(00:42:19):\n\nIt could potentially install something on your device that could been key log. Yes. You should never just take a cable and plug it into one of those chargers. A USB Yeah. U us USBs port at a hotel at an airport or anything like that, because you never know. I did that last night. Oh, no. Oh no. Oh no. You, and this is the thing, honestly, you're probably okay, right? Yeah, yeah. It's just, it's, it's not the, the idea that, you know, every single place is going to have, it's just, if you can be careful, you should be careful. And the reason why is because with the typical u SB cable, there's there, there's connection between the two for charging and for data data mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. And so you either need to get a cable that only does charging so that it'll only pass power to the device, or, and this is what I suggest, what we call a quote unquote SB condom.\n\n(00:43:13):\n\nAnd essentially what it does is no matter what cables you have, it will only allow the passing of power between your cable and whatever you've plugged it into. There's just a little dongle that it's Yes, it's a little dongle. So you plug this into the U s BBC port or the U S B A port and the hotel and the airport, Uhhuh, <affirmative>, and then it basically just all of the little pins that are for data Right. Doesn't do anything with those. Right. It only passes along the power. Wow. Okay. That way you don't have to get new cables that are special for this. You just carry around A U S B A condom, a u s BBC condom, and then you're good to go. <Laugh>. is that what they're actually called? That is what they call them. Yeah. <laugh>. So, you know, protect yourself.\n\n(00:43:53):\n\nIndeed. Uhhuh. So ZDNet has a, a good article called Protect Your Data with the u SB condom that actually lists a few options, including a company called Porta Power and, or excuse me, porta Pow Porta pow. And these have different models, again, U S B A and U S BBC that just no matter what you're plugging it into, the data is blocked and it's only going to pass along power. The article also discusses some of the devices that look as if they're just standard cables, like there's nothing wrong, turns out, no. These cables actually have the firmware, the software, the, the, the bad acting stuff in it that will actually gain access to your devices and potentially install something. Now, of course, it's worth noting that many modern, especially mobile operating systems have lots of protections in place to keep you safe.\n\n(00:44:51):\n\nAnd so if up to this point, you know, you've been using those chances are you're probably okay. But if you just want to go forward with the knowledge, okay, I'm good. That is where something like this will be helpful to you. In fact, the article kind of is a little tongue in cheek in saying the super paranoid folks out there <laugh> to make use of these because these this is a, typically a targeted attack. This is not just anybody in the airport, they're scooping up whatever, because the information that could be gained through it is more meant in a, in a targeted attack. So you find out that some head of state is staying in a hotel, and then, you know, the espionage goes in, and that, that's kind of where this has mostly been. We've seen it mostly used in the past. But again, if you want as much sort of caution as possible, then these USB condoms are a great thing.\n\n(00:45:43):\n\nAnd I, I suggest not just going to Google and typing that in and then buying the first one because you don't know then where that's coming from. Look for one of these established brands that have been talked about before by computer security professionals. So the company, again, port a p is a great example for an option to make sure that you're only passing power to your device. There's also the question of, well, what if I am using a wireless charger at an airport as opposed to, you know, you just set the device down, that's even harder to be able to pass along any, in\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:46:22):\n\nFact, this is how, this is what I was doing at the hotel last, oh, good night. Oh, yeah. It's using an wireless charger.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:46:26):\n\nYeah. So that's your, you're even more safe. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Of course with newer devices like the iPhone, there is an N F C reader that's involved in the power charging mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, but it is specific to apple's own accessories. So they include in some of the devices and cases like this case, it has a little chip in it that tells the phone what color and what device or what accessory rather you're putting on so that it, whenever you actually stick it into the, the case, it shows up an animation that shows the actual case that you're putting on it. So it's a little goofy, it's gimmicky. But that could be the only concern that someone would have is, oh, well, what if they pass information over that N F C connection? But that n FFC connection is so limited that it's highly unlikely that there's going to be anything passed along.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:47:17):\n\nYou know, one thought I just had was, what if instead of using a a u SB cable mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, well, you use, use a USB cable, but you also have one of those AC power things.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:47:29):\n\nThat's, that's the best. I mean, that's really,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:47:31):\n\nBecause that's not gonna pass any\n\nMikah Sargent (00:47:32):\n\nData. If you're just plugging in your own device and then you're passing, then you're charged, you're fine there. Yeah. Yeah. This is strictly, you know, you've got a lamp. They, they have those lamps in hotels that's they'd have the USB two USBs in them. I've used them. Yeah. And there are times where somebody has taken the, you know, the bottom off of that lamp and then discovered that inside someone had installed some sort of dongle that was then passing alongside. So yeah, that's nefarious. Yes. An nefarious a bad actor was\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:47:59):\n\nNo good\n\nMikah Sargent (00:48:00):\n\n<Laugh>. So it is a good question, Jerry. And that is why, again, I recommend getting the little dongle as opposed to getting a cable. Because this is the thing a lot of times it, they're the cheap cables that are only for passing along power. And when you're buying cheap cables, you're also running the risk of, of shorts and all sorts of mm-hmm. <Affirmative> bad stuff that lead to fires instead. So <laugh>, I think another thing you don't want Yeah, exactly. You don't want fire, you don't want somebody hacking into your stuff. So one of these little dons, or as we've said, u sb condom can be helpful. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> in, in this case. All righty. It looks like we've got the, oh, I should mention call.twiz.tv is the r l you wanna type in. You can then go to Safari well any browser on your, your mobile device and type that in and join us for the call. Let's go to the Mac geek who's joining us today for Ask the Tech guys, Kevin from Las Vegas.\n\nCaller 2 (00:49:11):\n\nOh,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:49:12):\n\nAll right. Hi there, Kevin from Las Vegas. How are you? Hi.\n\nCaller 2 (00:49:16):\n\nI'm doing great. In honor of both Scott and of Leo. I had to mention I know Leo talked about his fabulous socks that he had. And of course, I think Scott had mentioned that earlier. And I have to show you something that I often use in the pit when I'm playing it with the orchestra for a show, because you, as you know, you have to have all black, so you can't have any anything showing. So these don't show. But there's something that kind of is interesting for the cast and the crew. And I\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:49:51):\n\nShow you <laugh>.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:49:53):\n\nSo we're, we're getting a look at the Fun\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:49:55):\n\nSocks. Oh, the fun musical socks. I love those. I want a pair of those.\n\nCaller 2 (00:50:01):\n\nYes. So there you go. So that's my go-to for fun in the pit <laugh>.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:50:07):\n\nOh, that's fantastic. What do you, what do you play in the pit?\n\nCaller 2 (00:50:10):\n\nI'm aist and organist, and so I've, I've done, geez, a lot of show. It's, it's been, it's been a hoot. I just retired to Las Vegas about a year and a half ago, so I have a little more time to call and talk in and get answers to questions. And so my question for you is, since you're on here and and with the, you know, information about theater, home theater, I have an old Panasonic tv, which is not even 4k. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I have an old Denon receiver that won't die. I've had it from <laugh>\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:50:43):\n\nJust making\n\nCaller 2 (00:50:44):\n\nIt Please Die. Oh my God. It's like 20 23 0 7 ci av. I mean, it's just an old\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:50:51):\n\nYeah. It's been a, yeah, yeah. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:50:54):\n\nSo\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:50:54):\n\nIt's an og.\n\nCaller 2 (00:50:56):\n\nYeah, it definitely, definitely. So I'm looking eventually within the next, hopefully six months to a year to upgrade mm-hmm. <Affirmative> would it make sense to just do the TV if I want to do part at a time, do the TV first, do the receiver well, and then what would I upgrade to Sure.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:51:14):\n\nFor both. Sure. Well, one thing that comes to mind immediately is that old receiver will undoubtedly not pass 4K or h D R content.\n\nCaller 2 (00:51:26):\n\nThat's what I was afraid of.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:51:27):\n\nYeah. <laugh>, I, I, I would seriously doubt it. So, you know, if, and how many source devices do you have?\n\nCaller 2 (00:51:38):\n\nLet's see. I've got Apple tv.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:51:40):\n\nIs it a 4k Apple TV 4k?\n\nCaller 2 (00:51:43):\n\nYeah. Okay. It's not the current model, but it's the first 4K they came out with. Okay. All right. A couple of generations back. And the a Blu-ray player, Sony Blueray player, and a and let's see, that's about it really. Okay. I, I've,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:51:58):\n\nBut it's a Blu-ray, not a U H D Blu-ray?\n\nCaller 2 (00:52:02):\n\nYeah, I believe it's just a Blu-ray.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:52:04):\n\nOkay. So that's 10 80 p the, the Apple 4k. The Apple TV does do 4k. So, and the Panasonic is still working, is it a plasma, Panasonic plasma?\n\nCaller 2 (00:52:18):\n\nOh, no, not at all. Oh, okay.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:52:19):\n\nIt's an LCD about 10\n\nCaller 2 (00:52:21):\n\nYears\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:52:21):\n\nOld. No, it could be, it could very well be a Panasonic plasma at that point. And they made some excellent plasma TVs. Plasma TVs are no longer made. They're, they're dead. It's a dead type of of technology, but when they were being made, they were my favorite TV technology. So it's a tough one. If it's still working, then it's still working.\n\nCaller 2 (00:52:51):\n\nYeah.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:52:53):\n\nAnd you don't really have anything, any source device other than the Apple TV 4K to give a 4K signal? I mean, ultimately yes. You'd, you'd wanna upgrade to, in my opinion an ole tv, LG or Sony LG is less expensive and still really good. And you would then want to upgrade to a receiver. But you know what you could do in the meantime, you could bypass the receiver. You could just plug the Apple TV 4K directly into the, your new 4K tv and then it would show 4k and it wouldn't be, it would mean a little more remote swapping and, and fiddling around. It's always nicer to have everything go through a receiver. That's always much nicer. And if you wanted to do that, then you'd have to upgrade your receiver as well.\n\nCaller 2 (00:53:53):\n\nYeah, because I've cut the cord, I have Sling and I have a, an antenna just for local broadcast, Uhhuh, <affirmative> and Apple TV with paramount Plus also on there as well. Sure.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:54:05):\n\nI appreciate too. Well, again, that, you know, that Apple, that Apple TV will give you 4k, I don't remember if Sling has 4K capability. I'll have to look that up.\n\nCaller 2 (00:54:20):\n\nYeah, cuz it's on the Apple tv, the app on the Apple tv. Right. so I just tune into that and log in and mm-hmm. <Affirmative> all that same thing with Paramount Plus, it's all there on the Apple tv.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:54:32):\n\nYeah. Yeah. But you're not getting any 4K through that receiver? I, I would be willing to bet.\n\nCaller 2 (00:54:37):\n\nNo, no, not at all. I mean, even though it shows up and it's a 4K Apple tv, I'm not getting, if\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:54:44):\n\nYou're not getting 4K signal. Right, exactly. The, the Apple TV is looking at the TV and the receiver and going, oh, you can't, you can't deal with 4k, so I'm not gonna send it to you. I'm only gonna send you 10 80 p.\n\nCaller 2 (00:54:57):\n\nSo pretty much you're saying I should probably up upgrade both\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:55:00):\n\nI that really, I do. I'm afraid. So, <laugh>, I'm afraid. So if you want, you know, if you really want the best experience now that you can get, you really do wanna upgrade both of them. Otherwise, if you just upgrade the TV and you plug the four Apple 4K directly into it, you know, they have to change the inputs on the TV to watch one thing versus the other switch swap around remotes. And a lot of people find that pretty daunting.\n\nCaller 2 (00:55:26):\n\nWell, I'm using the, the sofa baton remote. In fact, I, I did a mini review a few months ago with Mikah and Leo mentioned and showed that, and I had bought it on Amazon for like 40 bucks on sale and it's doing great. I think it's even better than the Logitech promotes.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:55:48):\n\nOh, I haven't looked at the sofa baton. I would be hard pressed to find, to think anything's better than harmony <laugh>,\n\nCaller 2 (00:55:56):\n\nBut buttons for macros so you can program several devices. Yeah, it's very, and the only thing is it's r was it in not infrared, it's R RF\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:56:09):\n\nSo you don't have to point it anywhere.\n\nCaller 2 (00:56:12):\n\nYeah. It's a drawback to that. And also it's got a little klugy kind of a scroll wheel that changes devices where you can\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:56:19):\n\nChange the, I'm gonna have to get me one of those and, and check it. Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:56:23):\n\nI'd love to hear you get\n\nCaller 2 (00:56:24):\n\nFor 40. It's well worth even 50. It's well worth.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:56:27):\n\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. You've, you've given me something to look, look for. Thank you. So\n\nCaller 2 (00:56:31):\n\nThe only question is, obviously the size of my apartment is not big, so I, I've got about a 55 inch right now. Oh yeah. And that's, I'm sitting about six to seven feet at the, oh\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:56:41):\n\nMan. 55 inch TV would be fine for you. And an LG Lgc two, I think I last saw on on Costco or Amazon, maybe at 1500 bucks, 1600 bucks, something like that.\n\nCaller 2 (00:56:58):\n\nYeah. I was looking to see if I could, you know, get maybe under a thousand, but I don't know if that's\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:57:04):\n\nPossible. You, you could have for Super Bowl Sunday and back in Black Friday might have been possible. And as the 2020 threes start to actually become available in retailers, they're gonna discount the 2020 twos. So if you can wait I'd say a couple of months, maybe one or two months, you might see the L G C two down, close to a thousand, I think at Black Friday last year and Super Bowl Sunday, the C 2 55 was 1200, 1300 bucks. So getting close.\n\nCaller 2 (00:57:39):\n\nOkay. So it's yeah, it's not urgent, but I'm definitely, I mean, cuz they say that Panasonic and the, and my Denon receiver just chugging along\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:57:47):\n\n<Laugh> <laugh>.\n\nCaller 2 (00:57:49):\n\nIt's a good picture. It's fine, but it's just not 4K and it's not the,\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:57:54):\n\nNot hdr. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:57:56):\n\nYeah. So since you know, I've, I've now retired, I figured, well, I'm gonna be doing a lot of movie watching and\n\nMikah Sargent (00:58:03):\n\nRight.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:05):\n\nSo we'll see. Yeah. See\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:58:07):\n\nWhat happens. I, I'd say, I'd say wait a couple months, if your system's chugging along, then chug along with it. And when the 2020 threes start coming out and the 2020 twos start going on better sale, then go for it.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:23):\n\nOkay. Sounds like a winner. All right. But do check out that sofa baton.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:58:27):\n\nI will. That I will. Thank you for the recommendation. That's, that sounds great.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:31):\n\nIt really works well. And like I say, just a few, couple of little drawbacks, but for 40 bucks it does a heck of a job.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:58:38):\n\nOh yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:39):\n\nYou know, it's well worth it. So, yeah. Anyway. All right. Thanks.\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:58:43):\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:44):\n\nYeah. We to your show now and unless you're back on the air\n\nScott Wilkinson (00:58:48):\n\nYeah, please do.\n\nCaller 2 (00:58:51):\n\nI'll do it. All right. Thanks Scotty.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:58:53):\n\nQuick. Yeah. Thanks for calling in. All right. We are gonna take a quick break before we come back with more.

I do wanna tell you about Thinkt Canary who are bringing you this episode of Ask the Tech Guys. Everybody knows Honeypots are a great idea. These little sort of moments, these little, these little devices where you're drawn in to go and dig inside, and then boom, you capture that bad actor. And so you kind of wonder, why don't all internal networks have honeypots set up? Why aren't they all running them? Well, it's because with all our network problems, nobody needs one more machine to administer and worry about. You know, the boss might want a honeypot set up on the network, but the IT team is going, literally, we've got so much to think about every single moment.\n\n(00:59:55):\n\n<Laugh>, the benefits that honeypots can bring are there, but the cost and effort of deployment always drop honeypots to the bottom of the list of things to do. That's where things canary comes into play. It changes everything because Canaries can be deployed in minutes, even on complex networks giving you all of the benefits without the admin downsides. The canary triggers are simple. If someone is accessing your lure files or brute forcing your fake internal S SSH server, you've got a problem. Canary uses deceptively uncomplicated high quality markers of trouble on your network. Here's how it works. You simply choose a profile for the Canary device. It could be a Windows Box, a brand name router, or a Linux server. If you want, you can further tweak the services your Canary runs. You may need a specific i i s server version, open s ssh, or a Windows file share with actual files constructed according to your naming scheme.\n\n(01:00:52):\n\nSo it's got all of that complexity that you can add. And then lastly, you simply register your canary with the hosted console from monitoring and notifications. And then you wait attackers who have breached your network, malicious insiders, other adversaries make themselves known by accessing that canary leaving little room for doubt. If someone browsed a file share and opened a sensitive looking document on your canary, you'll immediately be alerted to the problem. You can view testimonials at Canary Tools slash Love and see why customers on all seven continents love their thanks Canaries. Deploy your birds and forget about 'em. They remain silent until they're needed. You can get one alert via email, text, slack, web Hook, or Syslog only when it matters. So visit canary.tools/twit and for just $7,500 a year, you'll get five canaries, your own hosted console, upgrades, support, and maintenance. And if you use the Code twit in the How did You Hear About Us Box, you're going to get 10% off the price for Life.\n\n(01:02:04):\n\nThanks, Canary adds incomparable value, but if you're unhappy, you can always return your Canaries with their two month money back guarantee for a full refund. However, this is really cool during all the years that twit has partnered with Thanks Canary, their refund guarantee has never needed to be claimed. You can visit canary.tools/twit, enter the code twit in the How did You Hear About Us Box? And you too can be very happy with your Canaries. Thank you. Thanks Canary for bringing us this episode of Ask the Tech Guys Alright, back from the break. And I think we'll take a moment to flash back to Tech News Weekly where we talked about with Jason Howell, myself talked about H B O Max mm-hmm. <Affirmative> losing the H B O part of its branding. So yeah. Give this a listen.\n\nJason Howell (01:02:59):\n\nAll right. So no more H B O, it's just Max.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:03):\n\nYeah. So <laugh> Warner Bros. Discovery Warner\n\nJason Howell (01:03:07):\n\nBros. Warner Bros.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:08):\n\nDiscovery has made the choice to ditch the H B O branding and go with a new streaming platform called Max. It announced it as we're recording this show just yesterday, and kind of talked about some of the upcoming stuff that will be part of the max launch. But what I found <laugh> interesting was how upset people were getting about this this change. <Laugh> and I,\n\nJason Howell (01:03:42):\n\nI it doesn't take much to upset. No.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:43):\n\nLet's no, I I mean, change, change is the thing that gets people\n\nJason Howell (01:03:47):\n\nUpset, but yes,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:48):\n\nIndeed. It's always fascinating when it's some, like you, HBO o's been around for a long time. Yes. It's something that you pay for and then you get to watch shows on it. And so I struggle, I guess what I'm saying is I struggle a little bit with the, with understanding how someone's identity can be tied up in it so much that they get so bent out of shape about the fact that <laugh>, you're getting rid of HBO o part of this, what in the world, regardless of that, that's what's happening. The launch is going to happen on May 23rd here in the United States. It'll come to other places later on. And I also, according to this variety article they're planning on launching an average of more than 40 new titles and TV show seasons every month.\n\nJason Howell (01:04:43):\n\nWow. That's\n\nMikah Sargent (01:04:44):\n\nA lot.\n\nJason Howell (01:04:45):\n\nRight? That is, I wonder how that compares to like Netflix. Cause Netflix in its heyday, and I think we're kind of beyond the Netflix heyday at this point. Yes. That, I mean, that felt like a reality. Yeah. There was so much streaming new stuff into there and, and so much of it was internally produced. It wasn't just, you know, third party content that they got licensed for. And it got confusing, like at a certain point. Yeah. There's, it was just too overwhelming. Like,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:05:09):\n\nWhat, what do I even where, what's new? What's not Yeah. What's theirs, what's not, what's still available, what's been taken off, that kind of thing. They've definitely slowed down some, but there's still new content appearing there all the time. Sure. And that, that does kind of seem to be what HBO O Max is doing, or excuse me, what Max is planning on doing. Hmm. what along with this change is going to be some changes in sort of the pricing and tier structure. So I wanna go over this. There are three, there are going to be three tiers. An ad light, an ad free, and an ultimate ad free. Sure. the ad light plan, of course, is going to cost the least amount of money at $9 and 99 cents a month, or a hundred dollars a year. You can have two people streaming at the same time.\n\n(01:05:59):\n\nIt's only 10 80 p resolution. You can't download anything. And then there's not Dolby Atmos for the sound, the ad free version, of course. It's just like the ad light version, except you don't have ads. You can do 30 offline downloads. So if what is an offline download, it just means that at any time, if you know you're going to be without internet connection, you can download several episodes or movies and have those available for a certain period of time. You're on a flight to Costa Rica, you're Exactly, yeah. And you don't wanna pay for the air the airplane's wifi or whatever. Right. Right. That'll bring it up to 1599 or $150 a year. And then the Ultimate ad Free plan, of course, has ad free content for concurrent streams. And that's the only one that features the 4K content with Dolby Atmos. Yeah. So E H B O Max is losing the HBO o And I was curious to hear your thoughts on this as someone who, you know, has your mind in the home theater area and streaming content mm-hmm. <Affirmative> the library, smart move. Weird move.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:07:11):\n\nI think it's a weird move myself. Now I understand their point that H B O has a huge brand recognition, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but it's also associated with what we would call adult content. Yeah. I don't mean X-rated\n\nMikah Sargent (01:07:27):\n\nOr anything like that. Not blue content. Not blue\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:07:29):\n\nContent, but, you know, content that would be inappropriate for little kids. Yeah. And now they're adding Discovery Plus and they want it to be more of a family thing. So having H B O be associated with, you know, game of Thrones and, you know, these other more adult titles might put some families off on the other hand, simply calling it Max <laugh>, what the hell does that mean?\n\nMikah Sargent (01:07:55):\n\nRight. It is so generic. It's\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:07:57):\n\nSo generic. It's too generic. Yeah. so I, I can't say I've got a better idea right now. <Laugh>.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:08:04):\n\nYeah. What call it Lucy instead of Max.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:08:06):\n\nYeah, exactly. <Laugh>, I mean that, it, it didn't make a lot of sense to me to call it that. Okay, you wanna lose the H B O to make it more family friendly, but you don't wanna lose the people who wanna watch Game of Thrones or, or these other more adult content, what do you call it? I mean, they could have run a contest, maybe <laugh>.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:08:25):\n\nYeah. I guess, yeah. I, my, my thought in the end is kind of the people who were in it for watching H B O mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, probably a little, a little more sophisticated mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, I, I, cause I think about HBO o for the long, like HBO's been around for a long time, long time. And in order to get it in the first place, you had to know a little bit about, you know, you couldn't just, you call your cable provider and just get the standard package. You know what I mean? You had to go and say, I want the HBO O package, or to understand even what that was. And then as we've moved kind of away from it being part of cable mm-hmm. <Affirmative> to being the separate subscription or in some cases bundled in with other stuff. Right. So it has a little bit of sophistication Yeah. In getting it set up. So I think you don't necessarily alienate the H B O people mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. So it's almost like they just have trust that the HBO o people are always gonna know where they can find their favorite HBO o shows. Right. So they can almost just go, we'll just put those to the side. You all know what you're doing. We're trying to draw in a new client, Cleon tail. <Laugh>\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:09:27):\n\nCleon.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:09:28):\n\nAnd in that case, I, I sort of understand that aspect. If they're trying to grow the user base Yep. They're like, we're not worried about you people who already, you're gonna gripe, we're ready for that <laugh>, but we're not worried about you going away cuz you love these shows. So you're gonna find this,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:09:44):\n\nYou're gonna find or what. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I, I don't know. Not calling it Family Max, maybe.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:09:51):\n\nYeah. Yeah. That, yeah. That wouldn't be bad. Something like\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:09:53):\n\nThat. Something like that to make more indication of what it is.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:09:56):\n\nYeah. What is Max? What is Max? I don't know what's on there. Every it's Max. Yeah. That, that part is fast. And I'm curious too. So the way that I get H B O max right now mm-hmm. <Affirmative> is as part of my at and t my cellular plan, Uhhuh <affirmative>. So I've got a plan that has at and t or that has HBO O Max bundled in with it. And right now nothing is changing. They've said that even after the launch, nothing is changing right away. Mm. But I do wonder if eventually that little will go away, that little benefit will go away. Good question. And if we start to see people who have current H B O max subscriptions, if we see those change too depending on which streaming package you have, is it the full 4k? Is it just 10 80 p et cetera, cetera? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. And it is something to watch.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:10:46):\n\nYeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:10:46):\n\nAnd that's what you were talking about earlier, that problem with streaming. That's\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:10:49):\n\nExactly right. The problem with streaming is that it changes, it morphs, it evolves in ways that are sometimes confusing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and how do you keep up? Yeah. I mean, I have a hard time keeping up. How is\n\nMikah Sargent (01:11:01):\n\nYeah. Because it's not as if there's one central sort of zone of truth <laugh> that you can go to and say, I I can go here and I know exactly what's available. I know when it's all gonna go away. Everything different, all of the different services that you have to go to. And then some of them, they don't even just, they just don't even announce it. That's right. I gotta tell you the most glaring example of this that I ran into there is a, so you may have heard of like Survivor the show. Yeah. It's a real, I don't watch it, but yeah. It's a reality television show where people basically are put on an island and they all have to eat bugs, eat bugs, they all try to survive. And it's kind of a social thing too, because you want to not get voted off.\n\n(01:11:41):\n\nWell, survivor here in America has really changed over time and it is not the enjoyable show that it once was. Really? Yeah. It's just they've, they've tried to speed things up because I think people's paces have changed and they're really just trying to make it more for a modern audience, but in a way that some of us who've watched it for a long time, eh, don't like so much. Don't like Yeah. There's an Australian version of the show Australian Survivor that is just Chef's Kiss. Beautiful. Amazing, wonderful. And I, it used to be that it was part of I can't even remember now. It may have been Peacock, it may have been. I think it was Paramount Plus. Okay. So it was on Paramount Plus. And my partner and I, we would watch that show. I mean back to back to back to back to back.\n\n(01:12:25):\n\nCuz we had several seasons in between. It binge it, we would binge it. And I remember this like it was yesterday, although it was now a year and several months ago. Huh. It was quite literally Valentine's Day. And we're watching, you know, we had just gotten through the season, we're watching the finale episode of the season Of Australian. Of Australian Survivor. Survivor. And we were all about ready to get to the sort of end of the episode when the people would be announced who, who won. Yeah. Hit pause. And you know, I think we were making dinner or something like that. We came back and they, a thing popped up on the screen and it said having trouble loading this content, which is something that happens on Apple TV from time once in a while if the internet connection drops, whatever.\n\n(01:13:11):\n\nRight. I go to reload it and as I was reloading it, I happened to look at the clock and I realized that it had just turned to, I think it was 6:00 PM so it was like on the dot. And that is where I sort of had this panic in my mind, like, oh my God, no. Did a licensing thing just flip over? Lo and behold, that is exactly what happened. And instead of letting people like finish out for the, for at least the whole day, like let, yeah. I've never had, even in shows that have lost their licensing, you can still finish like the episode that you're on because you probably in streaming it, you were downloading, you buffered it. Yeah. You've buffered it. Yeah. They, it wouldn't even let you finish the episode. The switch flipped and you could not even go. Let's just say that there is a certain sponsor on the network that is a virtual private network sponsor Uhhuh. And we were able to finish the episode, but we had to, we had to fly to Australia and finish <laugh>, which was really Frustra, but you're really not supposed to do. Yeah. Yeah. And so that was frustrating me. No. And that was one of those moments where I thought, ah, if I could have just bought this series, I wouldn't have had to, this wouldn't have been a thing. Yeah. And that is like, that's, that's the worst example of it where you're quite literally That's\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:14:22):\n\nTerrible in the middle of the\n\nMikah Sargent (01:14:23):\n\nFinal episode. Yes. Come on. Really? Yeah. That was who won calling. So I, I did not like that. <Laugh>. Alright. Let us go to, we've got a call and we'll go to that in a moment. But I did wanna mention here in about 15 minutes we will have Chris Marqui joining us. Ooh, cool. Yeah, so I'll talked to him in a while. It has been a while. And Chris is here for the assignment. We will take a look at the, the, the word was perfect and so we're gonna see what people have submitted for. Perfect. And then Chris will draw from the fishbowl for next month's assignment or for next next. Yeah, it's about a month. It's about a month between. Alright. So let us go to Grant. Who is calling in? Call.Twi.Tv. All right. Let's wait for Grant to All right. Grant. Hello. Hello.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:15:23):\n\nHello. Grant,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:15:24):\n\nWe heard you there for a moment. P and Grant. Oh, I keep, we keep,\n\nCaller 3 (01:15:37):\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nMikah Sargent (01:15:38):\n\nHe, hello Grant, where are you? You going\n\nCaller 3 (01:15:39):\n\nFrom? Nice. There we go. Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:15:42):\n\nOh, right. Doing well. How are you guys?\n\nCaller 3 (01:15:46):\n\nI'm wonderful. Today. Well, sort, I had issue with and suspended my account, but since Scott's here, I'm a different question. I've wanting to know. I'm little camera shy by the way, if you're\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:01):\n\nOh, well you can just do if you'd like. It's totally up to you.\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:05):\n\nYeah, lemme do that. So\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:07):\n\nI can actually, that's no problem.\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:09):\n\nSweet. So Scott? Yes. I know you do a lot in the home ab space. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I install high-end home automation systems. Oh yeah. Control for Sivan Josh, ai, Uhhuh, <affirmative>. And I was wondering if what, like if you were to put something in a home high end, they don't, like the customer just doesn't wanna have to deal with their smart home. They're good with a dealer coming by, doing everything for 'em. What would you recommend\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:16:41):\n\nIn terms of, of, of a smart home automation system?\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:47):\n\nYes. Cause there's like Crestron, there's Control four, there's Savan Josh AI is a new one in the space. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is actually really sweet, if you've ever heard of\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:16:59):\n\nIt. I have heard of it. I get a lot of their emails. I will tell you this, I don't spend a lot of time studying, researching, using smart home systems such as these. I will tell you that Crestron has traditionally been the system of choice for really high-end homes. Their, every, they, you know, they're at, I I when I used to go to cia, the Custom Electronics Design and Installation Association. Yep.\n\nCaller 3 (01:17:36):\n\nI went last week actually in Atlanta.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:17:38):\n\nOh, you went last week in Atlanta. Okay. Nice.\n\nCaller 3 (01:17:40):\n\n<Laugh>. Yes,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:17:41):\n\nSir. Well, do you go to the, do you go to the annual one, the expo in September or October?\n\nCaller 3 (01:17:46):\n\nNot, not usually. I've only been in the space a few years now.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:17:50):\n\nOh, okay. I would recommend if, if you can go to the one that's coming up in September in Denver. And that is a huge show. And Crestron normally has a huge booth at the show. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And when I used to write about very high end home theaters in a magazine called Audio Video Interiors, it was like the Architectural Digest of av and I remember clearly that the most common automation system that they used was Crestron.\n\nCaller 3 (01:18:27):\n\nYeah.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:18:28):\n\nSo if money is no object you know, then that's probably what I would recommend. I haven't, like I said, I, I don't keep up on this as much as I do audio and video technology specifically. And I presume that Crestron has kept up with all the latest innovations in home automation. When someone wants to save some money, I generally send them towards Control four. Yeah. which is some less expensive than Crestron. Josh ai, I don't know. I mean, I know of them, but I don't know much about them. Are they, are they kind of in the lower end of the price point spectrum? Are they in the higher end? What do they have that others don't? I'm afraid I can't answer that cause I, I don't spend that much time researching whole home automation as important as it is. You know, I stay more focused on audio, video technology.\n\nCaller 3 (01:19:25):\n\nSure.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:26):\n\nOh wow. So I'm just now learn. I did not know about Josh I of course used to host a show on the network, sweet Smart Tech today. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And we covered a lot of consumer facing brands. Uhhuh, <affirmative>, not some, which\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:19:38):\n\nCrestron really isn't.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:39):\n\nRight. Exactly. That's,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:19:40):\n\nWe didn't\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:40):\n\nInstaller builders and installer stuff. Exactly. but it was always something that was in the back of my mind. So I knew about Crestron and some of the other\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:19:47):\n\nControl four, probably\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:49):\n\nApril four, some of the other names that you mentioned. But Josh, this is really cool. It does look incredibly high end. They keep using the word luxury all over the website. So <laugh>, those prices are probably up there. Yeah. But have you had the opportunity to check out any of it? Cuz you said you do these kinds of installs? Yes, yes,\n\nCaller 3 (01:20:05):\n\nYes. We're a Control four house. My my company and we do control four mostly across the board. But I've been exploring other options like different price ranges and Josh seems a little lower. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> on the lower\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:20:19):\n\nThan Control four.\n\nCaller 3 (01:20:21):\n\nYes.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:20:22):\n\nOh wow. That's, oh\n\nCaller 3 (01:20:23):\n\nWow. But the coolest, the coolest thing about Josh is how well it can integrate with different things. Like, let's say you wanna watch a specific show on Netflix, just say, Hey Josh, watch this episode of this show and it'll just bam on your tv. Oh. And it knows what room you're in because of where you put the microphones knows what room you're in. So if you're in the kitchen, it's playing on the kitchen tv. If you say, Josh, I'm home and you're coming through the garage, it's only gonna turn those lights on in that area. And then as you move to a different area, it might turn other lights on. However you set up the scenes. And the scenes are all natural language that you just type it out there it goes. Oh,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:21:05):\n\nThat's cool. That's very cool. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:21:08):\n\nYeah. And they're, and they're the whole G P T thing that's gonna be a part of things going forward, hopefully.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:16):\n\nAh, that's clever. That is really clever.\n\nCaller 3 (01:21:18):\n\nYeah. It's gonna be really sweet. Oh wow. I just became a dealer. We're waiting on our parts to start playing around with it. But I'm, I'm super excited about that type of technology. Cause that's really what people want in a smart home is something where it's just say what you want. That's what happens. Right.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:36):\n\nYes. That's, that's a big thing right now where you're having to speak the language of the device that you're talking to and they all have different dialects. Right. And so to just be able to say, I just, can you please put on the show <laugh>?\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:21:51):\n\nYeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:51):\n\nYeah. It's going Okay. You're talking to the microphone that's right there. It's in this room. I know you're talking about that television. And it does that. And then I'm also seeing, cuz see some of these companies will promise that they get smarter over time. Right. And they come up with these sort of routines. But a lot of times I find that it just annoyingly ends up turning on a light. I don't want to <laugh>. So if this can do that and actually be smart about the routines, that is\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:22:17):\n\nGonna be, that's really good. Something good. And you, you said G P t meaning the AI is, is involved here?\n\nCaller 3 (01:22:23):\n\nCorrect. They call it Josh, g p t. Nice.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:22:26):\n\nNice.\n\nCaller 3 (01:22:28):\n\nYeah.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:22:28):\n\nWow. Okay. Well that's super cool.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:22:30):\n\nI honestly, I hope you'll call us back grant, after you've had a chance to play around with this just to tell us kind of what the experience has been like, because then I can convince Leo who you know, has a few dollars to throw around to install Josh in his own home. And then we can do it,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:22:47):\n\nThen we can play with it. Yeah, man, I'd dig at that.\n\nCaller 3 (01:22:50):\n\nYeah, man, I'm down.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:22:52):\n\nYeah. So that would be great. I'd love to to hear more about that in the future.\n\nCaller 3 (01:22:57):\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:22:58):\n\nAll right. Will do.\n\nCaller 3 (01:22:59):\n\nI'll let you know.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:00):\n\nThanks Grant for calling.\n\nCaller 3 (01:23:01):\n\nSo yeah, can I ask a super duper quick question? Of course. Yeah. that you could email me some information if you need to. My YouTube account got suspended. I don't post anything I haven't posted in years mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. I have it commented in a long time. I just watch a ton of video, just all nerdy stuff. And they just suspended it and they won't gimme any information Why I've done the appeal. They said we won't be putting your YouTube account up because of spa repetitive spam posting. Apparently. What? That's all the information I got. Well, you\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:23:37):\n\nDon't have any content on it, right?\n\nCaller 3 (01:23:39):\n\nNo. Oh, that one video on how to fix a Sony tape recorder years ago,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:45):\n\n<Laugh>. Wow. That makes it sound like your YouTube account scam. Big hack. It had been\n\nCaller 3 (01:23:50):\n\nHacked. Yeah, I changed.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:52):\n\nYeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:23:52):\n\nYeah, I changed my account or my password and I put two factor on mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and yeah, I mean, I've, like, what I'm worried about is they got my Google account and got all the passwords off of there. Right. Which would be a massive issue.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:24:07):\n\nWell, okay. Well my first recommendation to you, I, so this, unfortunately, as far as the YouTube thing goes, this always ends up being the answer that I have to give, which is you have to follow their processes. And unfortunately it sounds like what happens is what happens to everybody, which is that you don't, it's a black box. Mm-Hmm. And you don't end up getting anywhere unless you happen to get somewhere. And it's unfortunate that, you know, there's not more that we can do, even folks who have gone as far as to appear in, you know, national press. The, the guy was on the New York Times talking about this and his account still wasn't given back to him, even though it was proven that what was suggested that he did, he did not do. And that's because inside of these companies, they may look like monoliths on the outside, but inside of <laugh> a mess of flow charts and you know, distribu distribution networks and different roles. But as far as the fact that you got this spam thing, that does seem to me that there is some account hacking going on. So Yeah.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:25:15):\n\nSomebody hijacked the account. Yeah. Started posting all kinds of\n\nMikah Sargent (01:25:18):\n\nJunk. It's good that you turned on two-factor authentication and changed your password. Honestly. And it's not fun, and I hate to have to say this to anybody, but it is my recommendation that any account that has that email attached to that YouTube account as the means of password reset is something that you should go and change the password on. Might I recommend our sponsor Bit Warden as a password management platform, which will make it at least a little bit easier because then when you go to the site, you change the password, you've got different passwords for each one, and that will at least help you stay safer. But ultimately, yeah, it sounds like you may have been hacked. And that's one of the main ways that, you know, we, we think of, we always wanna think of hackers as like getting in and learning your bank account information and then draining your bank account.\n\n(01:26:14):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. But a lot of times, unfortunately, it's a lot less exciting <laugh>, I mean, in the bad. That of course is a horrible thing, but Right. It's a lot less interesting, I guess. And it's just there's some server farm out there that somebody somewhere else is hiring to make their YouTube videos look good. And so they hijack accounts and they post from those accounts onto different videos. And that's what it sounds like has happened here. So yeah. The only thing I can recommend at this point is consider now that you've ch, I don't know if you have, have, if you changed your password, set up two factor authentication and then went through the appeals process, but if you went through the appeal process before, now that there is this password change on record, it may be an opportunity for you to go back through the appeal process because then maybe the person who's doing it can see, oh, they may have been hacked because they're trying to change their password, they're trying to update their, their account. But that's all I can suggest for that, unfortunately.\n\nCaller 3 (01:27:14):\n\nYeah. I've also logged out all my devices and everything, so that kinda tell that. Well, I mean, if, to be honest, if I was a hacker, that's probably what I would do.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:27:26):\n\nYes.\n\nCaller 3 (01:27:26):\n\nLet's log out all devices, but hopefully it'll give 'em kind of a, an idea that it's, it's some sort of spam going on. So\n\nMikah Sargent (01:27:34):\n\nYes. So that I agree. Yeah. I appreciate it. A hacker of course, you know, would not follow through with this, this process to sort of get everything. So Yeah, I best of luck with that and do genuinely consider giving us a call in the future after you've had a chance to try out Josh. Cause I'd love to hear more about that.\n\nCaller 3 (01:27:51):\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:27:52):\n\nThank you, grant,\n\nCaller 3 (01:27:53):\n\nAppreciate your time.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:27:55):\n\nAll righty folks. We've got Chris Marquardt coming up. Is Chris with us, sir? All right. Yay. Chris is with us. Hi Chris.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:04):\n\nHi. How's it going?\n\nMikah Sargent (01:28:05):\n\nIt's going well. Good to have you.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:28:07):\n\nHey Chris. Scott Wilkinson here. Hey,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:09):\n\nScott. Good to see\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:28:10):\n\nYou. You too, man. It's been a long time. How you doing?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:13):\n\nYeah, I'm, I'm still thinking of the Tubas, <laugh>,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:28:16):\n\n<Laugh>. Chris helped us couple years ago during the pandemic, I, I run a show called Tuba Christmas. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is Christmas music played by a hundred tubas. Wow. And I wanted to do a virtual tuba Christmas, and so Chris helped me and my td mm-hmm. <Affirmative> work with what's it called? Open o b s\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:42):\n\nVI Video Ninja. It's a, it's an open source yeah. Video transfer tool that helps you do remote remote video things as in getting someone on the air. And that was right,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:28:56):\n\nThe tool. Right. That's so he helped us get, get, it\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:59):\n\nWas just so amazing to see a hundred tubers on a stage. Yeah. This is just <laugh>\n\nMikah Sargent (01:29:03):\n\nHear a hundred tubers on a stage.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:29:05):\n\nIt's an amazing sound. It really is.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:29:08):\n\nThat is, yes. That's awesome. Well, Chris is here with us today because it is time to take a look at the photo assignment. Chris joins us once a month for this and yeah. Take it away, Chris.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:29:23):\n\nYeah. So thanks for having me back. I have taken a look at all the pictures that were submitted for the perfect assignment. So that was running for a month now, and I've chosen three pictures to take a look at. Here's the entire hawk. Very, very good pictures. I mean, I'm, I'm, it was a, it was a tough choice to make between these two to pick three to look at. But I did make a choice. And the first one is by Gregory Chesney titled All I Need and <laugh>, this is, this is one, this is one of the, the examples in photography or in any sort of visual art where you don't need a lot of information to convey a lot. I mean, if you're looking at this at face value, we're seeing a black and white photo of a camera, but there's not much on it, not a lot of detail. A lot of of the camera just disappears in the shadow in black. So you have a few bright elements, a lot of very dark, but in your, in your, your mind is, is capable of putting that together into not just a, a beautiful picture, but you'll make sense of it by just looking at it out of this limited information. And it's a beautiful picture and it, and it tells a bit of the story. So it's\n\nMikah Sargent (01:30:41):\n\nGorgeous\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:30:42):\n\nHow meta a, a photograph of a camera\n\nMikah Sargent (01:30:45):\n\n<Laugh>,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:47):\n\nWhich, which means that Gregory, he took the photo at least owns two cameras.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:30:52):\n\nExactly. <laugh>,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:30:53):\n\nThere\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:30:54):\n\nYou go.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:55):\n\nThere you go. Second picture that I wanna share is by Demi lenta titled Red and Wow,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:31:02):\n\nThat's beautiful.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:31:04):\n\nAnd, and, and we're, so we're looking at a, a red flower in front of a green background. The flower is cut through ha in half. So we are only seeing half of the flower. It's not just the flower. It's also wet. So there's, there's reflections on it. There's a, there's drips hanging off of the pedals. And this is, okay, so first, first thing here that's going on is we are looking at complimentary colors. Red and green are, are kind of the opposite on the, on the color wheel, which makes them harmonize. Well, just think of a tomato. And if you don't have that green bit at the end, it doesn't look right. Right. It belongs there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So the grid and the green go together so well. Also what Demi did here is, is technically impressive because when we look at the red pedals, they are like super saturated. It doesn't get any redder in the photo. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <Affirmative> without losing all the detail, because you can, you can overexpose pictures. We, we've seen this with photos that, that just go white because it's so much light that no, no detail registers. But in this case, the red channel is kind of, kind of at the max, but you still have detail in the pedal. So demo to manage to kind of keep that in check. And that's that's a technical technical achievement well done here.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:32:23):\n\nThe cropping is gorgeous. Yes. I also really like the fact that the, the flower and the pets are so sharp and the background is so out of focus. Really, that's brings your eye to that flower.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:36):\n\nYes, it does. And and another example, like with a camera, you don't need all the information. Half a flower is enough, <laugh>. You're\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:32:43):\n\nRight. Right,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:44):\n\nRight. What the rest looks like. Okay. And last but not least, here's a black and white photo. Wow.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:32:50):\n\nLook\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:51):\n\nAt that. Karate. And it's, it's, it's kind of a snapshot, but then it isn't because what we're looking at is looks like there's some trailers and there's a whole bunch of palm trees, and it apparently has rained. So there's a big puddle in the foreground, and that reflects, that gives it a symmetrical reflection of palm trees. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and reflections where we're looking for, we are looking at the perfect assignment and reflections have the tendency to just make a picture feel a bit more complete, because that, that, that mirror image of what's already on the picture kind of doubles it. And the symmetry gives it some I'd say some, some a, a restful feeling, a very serene feeling. Gives it apic, gives it a feeling of completeness. So yeah, that's what we're seeing here. Reflections. especially if it, if they're, if they reflect in something like a puddle that is not disturbed by wind, which is very calm and very mirror\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:33:54):\n\nYes. At the very mirror-like\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:56):\n\nThat makes a very perfect picture. So good job. Everyone, everyone else, sorry for not getting two pictures. But all of them were pretty amazing. And now\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:08):\n\nTime for the next\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:09):\n\nAssignment. Fish ball out.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:11):\n\n<Laugh> drum roll please. Yeah.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:15):\n\nYour job. Yeah. I'm, I'm drawing one out to the drum roll.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:19):\n\nLet's do a drum roll. This tuba drum roll. <Laugh>. What is it? It's\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:24):\n\nThe fanciest assignment. Fancy.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:26):\n\nOoh.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:27):\n\nOoh. Fancy, fancy,\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:28):\n\nFancy, fancy. Hey,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:31):\n\nHere we go. So one month. One month to take pictures off. Well, fancy things or fancy pictures. You can go as meta as you like.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:34:41):\n\n<Laugh>.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:34:42):\n\nWhat's, what's the idea that comes into your mind when you hear the word fancy? Put that in a picture, submit it to the tech guy group on flicker and tag it with the tech tg. Fancy. That's how we find the, to talk about them here. TG Fancy is the tag tech guy is the group on Flicker and yeah. Good luck. One month to go.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:35:06):\n\nAm I correct that one has to take this picture within this month? It can't be something you already took.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:35:12):\n\nYes. Yes. That is actually the point here. You want this to be we want this to be a new picture and the main thing is to get off the sofa, to go outside to take pictures. <Laugh>, take some pictures please. You can pick, you can submit one picture a week and yeah.\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:35:29):\n\nOh, a total of four, roughly.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:35:32):\n\nYes. In the month total of four roughly. And and yeah, good luck. Fancy.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:35:37):\n\nGood luck everybody. And Chris Marqui, thank you so much for being here with us. Where should folks go so they can check out your work?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:35:47):\n\nOh, the best place is chris marqui.com. That's where I, that's where I have everything, including links to my workshops. I'm gonna do a photo tour in September, so if you wanna see Eastern Europe on a, in, in an electric car road trip that takes oo from Berlin to Sylvania, then yeah, check that out. It's all over\n\nScott Wilkinson (01:36:09):\n\nOne. That's awesome. When is that?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:36:11):\n\nIn September. Early September. First two weeks.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:36:14):\n\nAwesome. Chris, thank you so much for your time and we will see you again in about a month. Get in your fancy photo submissions.
