How are you today? It's good to see you. I'm Lee. I'm Leo Laporte. Who is this over here though?\n\n0:02:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHello, I'm.\n\n0:02:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nMikah Sargent, Are you? They always say dress for the job you want, not the one you've got. Are you looking?\n\n0:02:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nto be a banker Either a banker or a casino boss.\n\n0:02:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. You're much too well-dressed for a pit boss. Oh well, thank you, I think you're more like high finance. Okay, especially with the English rounded collar. Oh, you know this, the red tie. Thank you, I think you're going all in?\n\n0:02:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I just the next it'll be cuff links. That's the addition. I need to make some pearl cuff links. You didn't even button your buttons, not on the left, because the watch is too big. The watch is too big. The right one's buttoned, the left one's lock. Something we need to complain?\n\n0:02:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nabout the Apple Watch. Ultra is too damn big. You can't get your sleeves over. This shirt's got ample cuffs. They must have known oh, that's nice, but many of my shirts, yeah Well, I have.\n\n0:02:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhat I do is end up butting above the watch, which really looks, I know, and I hate that, so that's why I just keep it on buttoned. Yeah, you're smart.\n\n0:03:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo today we are, we've got Johnny Jet. Am I right, johnny?\n\n0:03:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJett at one.\n\n0:03:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nAt one.\n\n0:03:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nScott Wilkson at 12.\n\n0:03:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nTalking about some potential Black Friday deal and Santa Claus will be tuning in at in about half an hour. Indeed Black Friday deals, and I think Johnny Jet's going to be talking about Thanksgiving travel. It's the busiest travel day of the year. You don't want to be. Are you going to St Joe for Thanksgiving? No, no, I'm thinking, maybe of driving to Sonoma for Thanksgiving. That'll be my big trip over the hill. Today in the news, dood dood apple had an event on Tuesday. That's right, exactly, I know, it seems like it's so far in the past.\n\n0:03:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt seems so long ago.\n\n0:03:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nExactly 30 minutes long. It was so short. It was so short, I think. In the after there's always like the bubble of round apples events they call it the reality distortion field where you're going, huh, must buy. You know, apples events are very well designed for your lizard mind, must buy all the things. But then the truth starts to emerge it's still too early. Reviewers will be embargoed, probably till Wednesday. That's typical, right, and although minds come on Tuesday, so maybe not, oh then no, you'll probably see on Monday.\n\n0:04:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, maybe Tomorrow, I guess.\n\n0:04:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nReviews will start coming out and then people will start getting them both reviewers and real people and benchmark him and so forth. Some benchmarks have already leaked into geek bench and one thing seems to be clear and it was even actually kind of clear from the numbers Apple showed is that the M's. So they've got a new M three chip which is based on a new three nanometer process we talk about. We used to talk about the process in terms of the size of the kind of the wires, and in the early days I mean, we were talking, you know, the wires were millimeters. And then what comes after millimeters? A mega meter, mini, what's the opposite of mega, one millionth of a meter. And then nano, which is a billionth of a meter, the three billionths. We're actually going to be going to the next level pretty soon, but we're no longer talking about the wires. It's kind of more like three nanometer equivalent. So but what? What? In a sense, what we're saying is you can get a lot more on the same size chip. In fact, apple's top of the line, m three, has nine billion transistors plus on that one little chip. So that's mind boggling, right, that's incredible billion with a B. But what we're also seeing is that there are differences even within the three nanometer process. The company that makes these chips for Apple, tsmc and Apple, by the way bought the entire production for the year, like we'll take it all. No one else can have any, so won't even be till next year You'll start to see three nanometer chips. There are three nanometer chips in the new iPhone 15 pros, so we already have like the first version of those chips and I was a little dismayed because the numbers for these new iPhones run about 10% faster than the previous year.\n\nYou'd expect I would expect with this new process, more, and in fact that's probably what we're going to see with the M three, the base model. Right. Here's the surprise the M three pro. Apple actually slowed down memory bandwidth. The benchmarks that are coming out of geek bench now show that the M three pro is about the same speed as an M two max. So it's a little faster than the M two pro, but but not a huge amount. It's a little disappointing and it turns out that the M three max is the one where all of the speed improvements are, and when Apple says scary fast, they're not really talking about the M three of the M three pro.\n\nIt's really the max. It's the max which is very pricey. Trust me, I know, I don't know. I don't know why I did this. I was in the lizard brain lizard brain. But I did buy a max, partly because I want to compare it, because my wife has a M two max, I have an M one max in my studio. So I really want, I want to get, do our own tests, to really see and think about benchmarks. I don't tell you anything about performance because you know exactly.\n\n0:07:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, it's. It's a very specific set of tests that is all about getting those numbers versus. I'm not yeah, I'm not sitting there running these tests every day. How does it work when I'm actually trying to use it in different applications in different ways that matter? So to speak.\n\n0:07:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, yeah, so an apple really is. The road is forking between Apple and Intel and AMD by extension, because they're really pushing this power envelope. They want to get more, more power for less juice. They want to get more speed for less power, however you want to phrase it, and they're really doing a lot more tweaking. For instance, they built in now a decoder for a new video format that you're going to start to see on Apple TV, but also on Netflix and other places. Not encoder, just decoder. They started to do things in addition to these chips is very interesting.\n\nSo I think the main reason I'm bringing this up is if you're going to buy a new MacBook Pro and you may be tempted, as I was your lizard brain may be all excited. It might be worth holding off until well, I'd like to see more benchmarks, more, and maybe even till you can go play with it. And certainly one good one thing about Apple to return policy is pretty good, so you might want to. I mean, I'm certainly willing to return mine if it's not maybe that's if you're, if you're going from M2.\n\n0:08:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIf you're doing it for that, you probably don't want to go from M2.\n\n0:08:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nRight, m1, yes, maybe, and certainly from Intel.\n\n0:09:01 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBecause otherwise I guess you're waiting until M4. You know what?\n\n0:09:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou're waiting for. I guess what I'm saying is I was really excited about the potential for going to this new process. Up to now, it's been five nanometers that there was a. You know, the smaller you get it, the more normally in the way of things, there was a great book by a guy named George Gilder, called Microcosm, in which he makes this point several I think it was more than a decade ago that silicon is different from everything else, and everything else you get improvements by more, bigger, faster, better silicon.\n\nThe smaller it gets, the more efficient, the more speedy it gets. So it's a weird reverse of the way the normal world is. You know, a bigger hammer is a more powerful hammer, right, in this case, a smaller hammer is a more powerful hammer. So it's a very different world and I expected perhaps a bigger jump from M, from the five nanometer to the three nanometer, than we really got, although the M3 Max is pretty impressive. So we'll see, we shall see. Just I would say don't rush to the store like this fool Leo did. Are you ready for AI and your desktop? I, it depends, it depends. I have very mixed feelings. So Microsoft is now pushing out co-pilot to all Windows 11 users, enterprise first, but everybody will get it soon. They call it co-pilot, not to be confused with co-pilot.\n\n0:10:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nFor GitHub. Yeah, so that's one thing that Microsoft did was they unified the branding across all of it. So it's all co-pilot.\n\n0:10:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut here's a story from CNN that maybe it's a little bit of jealousy talking how Microsoft is making a mess of the news after placing staff with AI. Now I don't use Microsoft's news MSN, except if you're on a Windows 11, that note it's hard to avoid that notification.\n\nIn the lower left. There that's Microsoft news, msn and Paul Therat on our Windows weekly show, and I have always complained about the quality. You know it's terrible. It's terrible A celebrity focus, but that was when you had humans running it. Now you're getting literally misinformation, disinformation in your MSN news. According to CNN. False claims, false claims that President Biden fell asleep during a moment of silence for victims of the Maui wildfire A conspiracy theory. The latest surge in COVID-19 cases is being orchestrated by the Democratic Party ahead of the election, and an obituary for an NBA player that described him as useless. These false and bizarre stories are being published by Microsoft on MSNcom and Microsoft Start and CNN. Again, this could be a little, you know, jealousy, but CNN says it's because of Microsoft's increased use of automation and AI over human editors to curate the homepage, which means the AI see, ai's don't know truth and fiction, right, they're just making.\n\n0:12:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo. That's why it is only misinformation and not disinformation, right, because disinformation is an active role in trying to make people believe something else.\n\n0:12:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nAs recently as five years ago, Microsoft had 800 human editors working on the news, but in recent years they've laid off editors, some of whom were told they were being replaced by automation, which they understood to be AI. The Guardian newspaper, which I do trust.\n\nBut again word I'm reading now about what it did Accused the company of damaging the paper's reputation after publishing an article from the Guardian on its site. They have a licensing agreement with the Guardian. I don't know if I want to go into details, because it's pretty triggering. It's pretty awful, yeah, it is. But when the AI republished the Guardian story about a murder I guess, well, a questionable death yeah, they published right next to it a poll saying what do you think is the reason behind the woman's death? Was it murder, accident or suicide? What do you?\n\n0:13:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthink kids and because it was republished from the Guardian, folks might have thought that the Guardian would have had that poll as part of the the Guardian was furious.\n\n0:13:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey said it was a deeply concerning application of the company's AI technology. Demanded Microsoft take full responsibility. Quote Not only is this a sort of application potentially distressing for the family of the individual, it's also deeply damaging to the Guardian's hard-won reputation for trusted, sensitive journalism and to the reputation of the individual journalists. I hope we're not going to see more of this. That's awful, and I have to say now, correct me if I'm wrong, okay, I, because I read Twitter, which is a big mistake, but it's full of people saying AI is changing the world. There's a company called Runway that has just improved its AI video generation and the clips I've seen are like I'll show you some mind-boggling, but it's still to me kind of a toy, like how many times do you want to ask it to tell you a story, like grandma used to tell you about Windows serial number? I mean, it feels like a toy, yeah.\n\n0:14:28 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, that's the thing. I think it is a toy that has the promise of being a tool, and so, earlier, whenever you asked me on if I wanted AI in my system, essentially, I do think that if I was working on something and I realized, oh my goodness, I do this every day, five days a week, and I could automate this and I don't currently have the skills to create the necessary script that could do this If I could say to the AI hey, can we automate this task that I do every single day? And it's like yeah, here I've popped out a shortcut you can use on your Mac, because I'm built into the system. Have you done that? No, because it's not built in. I mean, that's what I'm saying.\n\nIf that was what it was able to do when it could be used as a tool like that, that is where I have found it. What I have done in the past, though, is had it generate some Python that I was able to use as part of a script that did help me, and so, when it comes to the tool use, yes, I like the idea of that, but you're right, a lot of this is not that. It is playing around making funny things and being silly, and yeah, it's just an expensive toy.\n\n0:15:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nVeneto. Here's some video. So Runway is like Dolly or any other AI you give it a text prompt and it generates video. This is AI generated video from a text prompt, and I think you'd be hard pressed to say oh yeah, that's AI generated. That's fake. By the way, it's a chimp looking at a bird.\n\n0:16:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, and some of these birds look really.\n\n0:16:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey're very realistic. Here's a penguin on the ocean. There's a polar bear in the snow. These are all fake and then not only generated from. They're not generated from videos or images, they're generated from text. That's wild. So this is the latest version of Runway, so there's no question it can do good stuff. Should we look at a human? Because humans are hard to do, but maybe not. That's good to say. So we're going to enter the era of deep fakes, aren't we Of stuff where, in fact, there was a high school where the kids were getting in trouble because they were making AI generated nudies?\n\n0:16:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nof their classmates. Yeah, this was my story of the week on Tech News Weekly on Thursday, unfortunately. So there was a school in New Jersey and some young women had gone into school for the day and they saw the boys kind of whispering amongst one another, chatting, and finally one of the girls was able to get one of the boys to reveal what was going on, and a young man had shared in a group chat photos of the young women's real faces attached to AI generated nude bodies, and it really has become a large conversation about how the legal aspect needs to catch up with where AI is right now and how there's a lot going on in trying to understand. How do you even pursue things like this? What does this content? Is this CSAM, is it not? It's a whole mess.\n\n0:17:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nBy the way, that's been another problem with CSAM, which is child sexual abuse material. It's Child porn, it's the new name for child porn. It has also problematic because they have, as you know, the National Center for Missing and Exploded Children has hashes they've generated for this child porn so they can quickly identify it just by matching a hash, without actually looking at the image or distributing the image. But the problem is now people are taking those images and using AI to modify them or creating new images with AI, and they're not in the Nick Mc database because there's no hash for them. It's just a mess.\n\n0:18:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt is, and that's the thing the people may be going. Okay, but you even type in something like the word gun in Adobe's Firefly and it won't generate. And you use open AI or Dolly, it doesn't generate. That's because there are lots of open source tools out there that people are basically tying to their tools that are doing this. They're called, you know, body swap or face swap or undress. These tools are out there and they don't have the guardrails.\n\n0:18:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nExactly, and they're using them on their phones.\n\nThere's a lot of effort to get around guardrails and we've seen that happen, also that these guardrails are not perfect. This week there were two declarations that we should be more careful with AI One from the president and executive order setting out, I think, some fairly concrete things that companies need to do they need to invest in safety and so forth, and another from Bletchley Park, which is where, of course, the Enigma machine was cracked in World War II. It's where Alan Turing did his work, and there was a meeting there of governments from all over Europe and they made a similar declaration that well, we got to pay attention to safety, but you know, it's all moving so fast. Yeah, but that's the funny thing is, on the one hand, the stuff you're getting on the desktop, as Microsoft Copilot, is a toy, and even I mean some of this is a toy, but there's, I mean, like the video- I'm laughing because it's reminding me of Toy Story, where you are a toy, you're a toy.\n\nAnd yet the opportunity for mischief is great.\n\n0:19:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, which? Frankly, what is a toy but an object of mischief?\n\n0:20:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh wow, I never thought of it that way, sort of.\n\n0:20:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt goes hand in hand, yeah, but that's a good point.\n\n0:20:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnyway, I think it's going to be very. We live in interesting times. That's all I can say. I mean, we're going to be starting to use AI for show notes and things.\n\n0:20:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd that's a great job. Yeah, it's a tool when it comes to that.\n\n0:20:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe use we're going to use AI for text transcriptions of our shows.\n\n0:20:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nVery, useful and we're replacing both Leo and myself with AI versions of ourselves.\n\n0:20:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nOr have we already? Oh, I'll tell you what you'll know when we start saying you know this AI stuff is great.\n\n0:20:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI'm very excited. There you go.\n\n0:20:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm very excited about what AI can do today and, in fact, we really should welcome our AI overlords. 888-888-724-2884 is the phone number. If you want to call us that's good during the live show, which is two to five. Oh, by the way, happy standard time Two to five PM Eastern. We are now on standard time in the US.\n\n0:21:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, there you go.\n\n0:21:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut I'm not going to go off on that.\n\n0:21:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou can also call us during the week at that number and leave a voicemail, which we love having those as well. There are other ways to get in touch with us. One is by opening up your browser on your phone or, if you choose, your computer, going to calltwittv. That will connect you to our zoom call, where you'll hang out and have the opportunity to ask a question live on the air. We do ask that, if you join the zoom call, that you raise up your hand. There is a button in zoom that says raise hand, because we won't call on you Unless you have that, mr Goddard, mr Goddard, mr.\n\nGoddard I don't even know what the audience is do you ever watch that show?\n\nNo, I know that through the office, because Michael makes references to it. I guess it predates you. So, yes, raise your virtual hand there, because some people just like to hang out in the zoom and watch from there, so that could be that as well. And then you can also get in touch with us via email, at ATG, at twittv you can attach video or audio to that if you choose, but we also take text-based questions there as well. So we'd love to hear from you.\n\n0:22:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nI am very excited to get to our first calls. And don't forget coming up in just a little bit, Scott Wilkinson with his Black Friday deals.\n\n0:22:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI can't believe how is it Black Friday already, just zooming by how is that. Oh my God. Well, it's not already, but it's a week from Friday. Right Stop, it is not a week from Friday. Best Buy has already started the Black. Friday deals. It's two weeks from Friday. Okay, Wait, that's so conf yeah, yeah.\n\n0:22:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's two weeks, friday, right? Okay, whew, let's take a break and then we will come back with your calls. First calls you guys talk amongst yourself, figure out who our first caller will be, but I know who our first advertiser is the great folks at TraceRoute. Ai continues to be integrated right into every facet of our lives. You're just talking about this. It's now time for us all to start questioning. This could not be a more timely ad.\n\nIs AI our friend or our worst enemy? That's the focus of a two-part season opener of the Fantastic TraceRoute podcast. It's a ward when it is a great show and the stuff we were just talking about they talk about with intelligence. They're informed, they have experts. We're just blowing smoke. Don't miss out on this. In other ways, we can peel back the layers of the stack that's what TraceRoute's all about and reveal the humanity in the hardware. You gotta start listening to TraceRoute. It's all about the hardware that's shaping our digital world, yes, but the humans behind it.\n\nIn every episode of TraceRoute, a team of technologists seeks to untangle the complex question of who shapes the internet. Now you may have listened. If you haven't go back and listen to season one and two, because they were all about getting a solid understanding of the inner workings of technology and, at the same time, revealing the human element behind it. But now they've got a new season just coming out and a two-parter to begin. It all about AI. But season three will tackle not just AI questions, but how can we use technology to preserve the earth? Who influences the technology that's made? What happened to the flying cars we were promised? Still waiting, still waiting.\n\nListen and follow the new season of trace route. It started just a couple of days ago, november 2nd, on Apple. Spot a fire wherever you get your podcast, check out trace route. Now we are thrilled to be able to support, uh, another podcast through our podcast podcasts. Good, they're good podcast. Good, let's uh, let's take the first call of the day. John Ashley just went back in the hall to turn on the lights. Sorry, I had to do my primary job function. His primary function is to keep this, so if you ever see this disc go out, it's cause there's nobody in the hall.\n\n0:24:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nExactly, no one's walking around at the we're all in the studio.\n\n0:25:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nEvery single person in this building is right here right now. Okay.\n\n0:25:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo the first person I want to call they've named themselves in the zoom call uh, leo's last pass photographer.\n\n0:25:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nI know who that is. I think let's go right to it. Um, leo's last pass photographer. He's talking about an event we did Steve Gibson and I did in Boston and uh, and as it turned out, the it used to be uh, we'd go to these uh events and afterwards we'd meet and greet people and maybe sign a few autographs or give out some chachis. Every single body, every single person and there was a long line to do it Wanted a selfie and I was getting tired of this home, not my arm. So, my good friend here, what's your name? I forgot Richard, mark, mark, that's what it's, mark Mark, my good friend here, mark, was there and said I'll do it and he became our last pass. Oh, that's so nice.\n\n0:25:55 - Caller\n\nSo I'll always think of Mark as three or four hours Felt like it. No, seriously, the line was out the door and I had to keep you moving, cause you're it. Anybody one needs to know. Is Leo really this nice? Yes, For that three or four hours. He's a sweetheart. I like Mike because he's like sweetheart Leo Jr, I mean.\n\n0:26:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nI wouldn't say nice, I would say verbose. But okay, you know, you get the idea.\n\n0:26:23 - Caller\n\nNo, you, you were nice, you were sweet, you were interested in everybody who talked to you.\n\n0:26:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou genuinely you know I love, I love our community. I I, I sincerely do. I've been very fortunate over the last 20 years to really develop a relationship 25 years now since tech TV started with some very nice people, people like myself, through nerds and I liked that. I liked the geeks. Mark you're, are you in Boston area? Where are you calling from? No, my brother lives in Boston.\n\n0:26:53 - Caller\n\nI happened to be visiting him that week and when you said you were there, I grabbed his card and, yeah, just drove down there.\n\n0:27:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nDid your Mike make? Did your wife make you sit in the wire closet, or is just just your? No, no, no no, no, I.\n\n0:27:08 - Caller\n\nWhat this is is. This used to be the patio, so what it is is like this is my I've got, like it's your monitor, I got it. Yeah, and it's my man cave.\n\n0:27:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLike if you go, yeah, if you go this way, that's back out, and so.\n\n0:27:24 - Caller\n\nSo the thing is is that it's just a little hole in in the area. There's no actual walls or anything, nice, and so that's just where I am, and so I've got my headset for the computer and I've got my headset for my phone. Nice, do you ever leave your your man cave, mark?\n\n0:27:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, all the time.\n\n0:27:42 - Caller\n\nI just, I was just out from a walk before they started, and so it's just I'm the one that said you know, I listened to everything three times speed. So generally I don't listen to the live cause. You have more time, three X speed, you have more time and we sound probably now.\n\n0:27:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe sound kind of drunk and slow. So what if we talk like this? Does that make it really hard for us to read?\n\n0:28:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nUnderstand what we're trying to say. No, in fact, it's easier. No, no, in fact, if you get an idea.\n\n0:28:05 - Caller\n\nThis if I go here, I can't even you're going to love this. This is. These are just some of the list of my podcasts that I listen to.\n\n0:28:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHoly moly, yeah, to get through all of that, yeah, yeah, and so I don't listen to all of it anymore.\n\n0:28:20 - Caller\n\nBut you, your brain is good, your brain is good, yeah, and you feel like you're getting all the content.\n\n0:28:28 - Caller\n\nIf you, if you listen to three, I know most of our audience actually listens at a higher speed.\n\n0:28:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, more than one. It drives me crazy, cause Lisa listens to all our books at one and a half or two X. Me too, not too X. She'll turn them on the speakers. We can listen together.\n\n0:28:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's like can you slow that down?\n\n0:28:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nI said, no, I can't, it's so slow. Calm. Yeah, I listened to calm and I have to keep re listening because my brain just zones out it's too slow.\n\n0:28:48 - Caller\n\nYeah, Calm, so you're supposed to. By the way, it's sad those boys were were passing that stuff around, cause I can't imagine my son doing that. Um, but you know how the teenage mind is.\n\n0:28:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nthey don't have impulse control and they're not really thinking about how the girls might feel about it and I you know who I really feel bad for is those poor girls, yep, they so many of them.\n\n0:29:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nUh, you know removed their social media entirely. There were a couple who said look, we feel scared going to school because we never thought that someone else would do this. You know you're going to school. Yeah, it's just, it was an awful situation, but I don't blame the boys so much.\n\n0:29:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nCause that they're. That's what teenage boys are. They're just, they're lumps of of. Uh, we really, it's the parents that. Well, I don't even know if the I don't know if.\n\n0:29:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't know how you blame anybody. It's just maybe blame AI.\n\n0:29:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, I don't know. No, it's. It's never the tool. It's not the tool. It's not the tool.\n\n0:29:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWell, I don't know.\n\n0:29:43 - Caller\n\nNo, it's, it's never the tool. It's you need to have empathy for other people. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's just that simple.\n\n0:29:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nYour mom, your, wife, your daughter, I agree with these.\n\n0:29:55 - Caller\n\nThink about it.\n\n0:29:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I agree.\n\n0:29:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I yeah, because you know okay. Yeah, let's not continue to. How can we help you? Yeah?\n\n0:30:02 - Caller\n\nBut okay, so I have, this is my little transporter and the poor little whoop. There are we, my little transporter, oh my.\n\n0:30:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nGod, I haven't seen one of those in years.\n\n0:30:12 - Caller\n\nYeah, I've got the puck over in that bay over there and so, but it just, like last month, stopped working. So I need to get something new and I just I don't want something like draw box, just cause I like my files to myself. So what I'm looking for is is there's sync I guess there's sync thing, and then there's the um, synologies, that kind of stuff.\n\n0:30:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo the transporter was basically a, a nas with that, a dry Kind of sort of that you would plug drives into and it would connect up right or did have a drive in it.\n\n0:30:47 - Caller\n\nOh, you, the other one I have. There's a sink and a puck. The sink has a little free, a two and a half inch drive in it, Right. And it's kind of curved up like that and then there's the puck which just you attach whatever drive you want to.\n\n0:30:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nI used to have a transporter. I gave up on that a long time ago. It, uh, I think what you really want ideally is a nas and network attached storage expensive, however, but the idea is these are, can these are? They look like just drive containers. They can have two, sometimes they have four or five. I've I tend to buy five drive nases, cause then you have redundancy, you can run them in RAID and if one drive dies you you literally hot swap it out and put in a new one.\n\nUm, and the advantage of those is they really are computers. They have processors, ram storage, their own storage, plus these many, many drives, and you put them, you plug them into the network, just like the transporter. You plug them in the network and now every computer can use them. They're, they're great for backup. Um, I actually use my nas with sink thing. So sink thing is more about keeping all your machines in sync, right, but if, if you're nas or even if you're transported, if you're, if you have a backup drive that is also attached to sink thing, that's why it needs a computer. That's why nas is a good choice. It will also back it up and I have my sink thing running on my Synology nas and and by the way, it's available, for the Synology nas is a third party extension. You can add it and I have it in in read only mode so it takes all the changes without ever making changes to anything else.\n\nSo it's a backup, right? That's what a backup is Everything you've ever done, with no deletions. Sync thing can be set to delete as well as to not delete. So uh, for for, I've seen thing. So when I have a new computer I will put sync thing on it and I will say bat, you know, I will say, uh, here's another sink thing, and whenever it says it's got a folder for you accept it. And so I accept the documents, I accept the photos. I have a, a sync folder that has legal documents and stuff. And the nice thing about sync thing is not putting it in the cloud. So I can put private stuff in my sync folder and so I let it sync that and then I let it back up to the nas and none of that ever touches the cloud. So that's a nice way to go. What do you do?\n\n0:33:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI also use network attached storage. I don't use sync thing. Most of my uh sort of backing up is happening via time machine and then I do quite literally manual uh movements of of things that I have stored locally that I want to go on to my network attached storage, just because it's not for me, it's not everything on my system that I want there. So, yeah, it's all manual. I uh I don't do the full process of of those backups.\n\n0:33:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nLots of ways to skin this fish, but uh.\n\n0:33:41 - Caller\n\nOne question, yeah, does sync thing cause? The whole point of the uh transporter was my mom does my accounting, um, and so she, uh, she had transporter software and her like computer in her house. The kids were off to college and so they could have their stuff that they wanted to go back and forth between their desktops here and their college laptops, and so I just want to make sure that sync thing will sync things outside this network. Yes, no problem.\n\n0:34:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nIn fact that's the thing. I have sync thing running on computers here, and when I set up a new computer here I attach it. Now it's a little complicated to get it to, to start talking to it, but it does network address translation so it's able to forward it around. It does it securely. It's worth reading about sync thing. Sync thing is free and open source and uh, and everything is encrypted in transit so you don't have to worry about somebody spying on that transit. And then there's a very clever, I think, authentication system that you use so that both ends have to say yeah, we agree, we're going to, we're going to send data back and forth. So the initial setup for instance, if your kids are going off to college, set it up in your network, say, sync this, sync this, the only trick with sync thing. And there's some good videos that I would recommend or read the documentation. But there's an excellent video on it, uh, that you'll find on YouTube. Uh, I'll put a link in the show notes to it.\n\nThe real key is have one kind of master computer, not the Synology, but one. For instance, let's say this is the master and I'm going to put sync thing on. In fact, you know what I should do is I should, I should start, I should set up sync thing, set up the dot, the folders that you want to synchronize on here. Then all you do from then on is introduce the next computer to this computer. This computer will say oh hi, welcome, I would like to share documents. I would like to share these folders with you. You decide you don't have to share them all, so you could have Peter's folder for his schoolwork I would like to share, you know, mark's, peter's and Sammy's folder. And then Peter on his computer says I don't want Mark and Sammy's folder, but I do want Peter's folder, and from then on they'll be synchronizing with one another. Uh, and, and so that's.\n\nThe key is not to set up new folders on each machine, but instead have a master machine that has all the folders and have then it introduce itself to each machine. So the machine decides which of those master list of folders it wants to accept. Now, if you did want to add a folder from another machine to the master, you could do that in reverse. The trick is not to have two documents folders with different GUIDs, because then you're going to have two document folders on each machine. You don't want that. So that's a little confusing, I know, but the video explains it pretty well. I love sync thing and Steve Gibson uses it too. I use it religiously. I think it is the best thing ever, especially because it's not backup unless you set up a NAS or or you could do it with some other thing. But you set up one machine to be the, the machine that keeps every change ever made and never deletes anything. Then it's a real backup. I think time machine.\n\n0:36:54 - Caller\n\nYeah, it's your bet, and that's what a NAS is. No, I've got a backup machine.\n\n0:36:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, well, that might be kind of like a NAS. So the transformer is essentially a NAS. It makes it a little easier. Just like your NAS, you could share it with your mom. I can see my NAS from here, in fact mine. I have a duplicate NAS here that sees the NAS at home and they make sure they're in sync. Oh nice, and that's my offsite backup, so I don't have to ever store anything in the cloud. Everything is stored in a storage that I own, either here or at home.\n\n0:37:26 - Caller\n\nYou could do that with your mom. One last question about your subscription yeah. Because I've had a like, one of the podcasts is Law of Self-Defense and I pay for that and I have problems sometimes getting these subscriptions to work. So maybe you should put it this is how it works, kind of this is how easy it is because you talk about it, but there's nothing like seeing a video that says you know this is what you get.\n\n0:37:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nIf only we had a video that would explain how it all works.\n\n0:37:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I almost want us to have a tweettv slash, a tweettv slash club Twitter video or something, so that we can easily link to it.\n\n0:38:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut basically we we saw that this guy here made a video.\n\n0:38:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd so we did make a video.\n\n0:38:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhere is it?\n\n0:38:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo it's in the FAQ, if you head to.\n\n0:38:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe best thing to do is go to Twittertv slash club Twitter. Everything is there, right? A Twittertv slash club Twitter.\n\n0:38:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYep and then under the accessing club Twitter, you can see there is a video where. Where is that? Oh, look on the right and where it says FAQ for frequently asked questions down at the bottom.\n\n0:38:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo maybe we made to make this more prominent.\n\nJust yeah, closer to the beginning of the page so right there under manager membership, frequently asked questions and in the FAQ there's a video somewhere. No one, or no one, can find it. There it is. See, it's the second video there. Yeah, accessing your club Twitter account. So, yes, we do. Yeah, you know, look the page, the page. Yeah, it would help. Every time I say subscribe, I say Twitter TV, slash, club Twitter. That's the page. And then, if you get confused, the FAQ and Ant Pruitt is our club manager, is very good at helping people to. He's been really he is.\n\n0:39:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIn fact, I know he's taken a number of calls with some of our members to help walk them through different processes, so it is something that we are very cognizant of that it is not the easiest thing, because of the way that all of these different systems talk to one another.\n\n0:39:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo, yeah, we do our best. Mike, you're saying put the video at the top of the page. Well, but you haven't joined the club yet, so I didn't want to put it at the top of the page. Maybe it should be with the other video at the bottom, I don't know. We'll figure it out. We should make it more prominent. Okay, and we're using a Patreon company called memberful for this, so memberful handles the whole thing. When you subscribe, memberful handles the payment. You can use, I think, stripe to do it.\n\nYeah, I mean so many other variety of payment methods credit cards. Obviously, they handle that. We will then send you an email. There'll be a page that's dedicated to you with all of your feeds on it. We try to make it as easy as possible, and I think once you get it set up, it's not so complicated.\n\nThe thing that most people seem to have the most difficulty with is not getting the feeds, but the discord, and so the one thing you need to know and you explain this in the video is set up a discord account. First, you need to have your own personal discord account, and then you'll get an invite to join our server. So the way discord works is you can be a member of many different servers. So you need a discord account. That's your own account it's not related to your club Twitter account and then you'll get an invite to join the club Twitter server. Once you're in there, you're going to be participating in the best darn social club ever.\n\nI love our club Twitter group. So you see, if you look at the my discord, I'm a member of many other servers. Here's the power on server for the mid journey server log seek. Oh, that was full journey, mid journey. Here's the podcasting server. Here's a list server, so ours is this one of the club Twitter logo, the animated club Twitter logo, and so that's just one of many servers. The one thing that mostly confuses people is you have to have a discord account first, and then you can join the club Twitter server.\n\n0:41:16 - Caller\n\nAnd I can use that through just real quick, Since probably people are listening. I can use that through pocket casts not discord, but you can listen to discord.\n\n0:41:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, no, no, no, no no no yeah, the podcast, oh yeah, most of our audience listens in pocket casts I love.\n\n0:41:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm just like you. I should show you my pocket casts. It's the same long list of shows that I love. Yeah, okay, pocket cast is great. We totally support pocket casts, along with the other big ones. We support everything. You're going to get a RSS feed that will work anywhere, yep. The only thing that's weird is that the ad free versions. Everybody has their own distinct RSS feed and that's kind of to keep you from giving it to everybody.\n\n0:41:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, that's exactly what it's for. That way, if you're sharing it with other people, we know who's sharing it.\n\n0:42:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe know who's sharing it. Yeah, and that wasn't something we instituted. That's just how members of the workforce, but it makes a lot of sense. Hey, mark, it's a pleasure to reconnect. Thanks for calling in, yep, have a great day.\n\n0:42:12 - Caller\n\nTalk to you later, take care.\n\n0:42:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right, you too Don't fall into the wires. No there, oh he did. He fell in, oh gosh. Hey, I think I would take a break here, but I think really we should get right to Scott Wilkins, and don't you think our home theater geek? He is, of course, in the club the home theater geeks podcast. He is an expert on audio and video AV systems. In fact, I hope you watch the most recent podcasts because they had the shoot out which, which picked the best TV for 2024. So that's fun. But let's say say hi to Scott. There's Scott.\n\n0:42:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHello Scott.\n\n0:42:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd his home in Santa Cruz California.\n\n0:42:55 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI don't notice.\n\n0:42:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm wearing my UC Santa Cruz nails, go, go up and have slugs.\n\n0:43:01 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe have a family member who just started at UC Santa Cruz. Yeah, oh, yeah, oh fantastic.\n\n0:43:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nMy father was a professor there for years and a provost. Oh yeah, in fact, when we moved to California when I was 15, we lived in what was college. No, it was Kresge. We lived in the, in the, in the married student housing at Kresge, which is one of the colleges, and my sister and I had our own apartment. Wow, yeah, yeah, that's a fan. That is so cool. Anyway, hello, banana slugs, hey.\n\n0:43:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMr Tuba himself.\n\n0:43:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo everybody should listen to the last home theater geeks, but just top line it. What is the best TV?\n\n0:43:46 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nThe best TV, the king of TVs, as they call it, is the Sony a 95 L, the Q D OLED, quantum dot OLED. And I'm not surprised. No one was surprised.\n\n0:44:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis was the second year in a row for the Sony, wasn't it?\n\n0:44:02 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nCorrect, correct. And it's its second generation and, of course, it improved.\n\n0:44:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nI saw I have the Samsung Q D OLED and I'm very happy with the brightness.\n\n0:44:14 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nReally really good. Yeah, the only caveat on that one is that Samsung does not support Dolby vision HDR Right, so if that's important to you, it's something to think about. But in terms of performance, samsung and Sony are very close, and maybe they were very close in the shootout as well.\n\n0:44:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat happened to LG? They used to win every year with their OLED Well and they.\n\n0:44:42 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nnow I can't have to look up the results, but certainly the LG OLED came in near the top as well, and it won every year until Q D OLED became available. Yeah, that's, that's simply a better technology. I mean it is better than OLED and OLED's great. Don't get me wrong.\n\n0:45:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI still. You know we were watching oh, I can't remember we were watching something that was in the 4K HDR. Of course, that's what you want. And I have to say, while we have the Q D OLED in the living room, the 77 inch Samsung right, it still looks great to go in the bedroom and watch the LG Absolutely.\n\n0:45:19 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAbsolutely it's beautiful the. Q D OLED is brighter.\n\n0:45:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's the biggest difference. That's why it's in the living room Right, exactly.\n\n0:45:27 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nExactly Quantum dots can get really bright.\n\n0:45:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo that's not why we brought you here today. We brought you here today for your annual Black Friday roundup. Did you do the spreadsheet again?\n\n0:45:41 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI Did a variation of it. It's it's a little too early to get the real black. Yes right, yeah even though Black.\n\nFriday has become black November, right, you know. So there are a lot of black Friday sales starting now, but I didn't take the time to actually do the huge long spreadsheet. What I did do and I and I sent to you and I hope you can put this in the show notes is my recommendations for the TV lines from each of the major manufacturers, and if you can find a really good Black Friday deal on any of these lines, then you're gonna have a superb TV. It's an hour, the black Friday.\n\nFriday deals. You know they. They will lure you in with super cheap prices on super cheap TVs, but I always recommend that you spend a little more to get a Level of performance that's going to be really, really good for years to come often the black Friday deals are Last years or, in this case, this year's model there that exactly, exactly. Yes, because come January.\n\n0:46:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes you're gonna see the 2024 models exactly although they won't be available till spring, you know later yeah the Sony QTO led wasn't available until last month.\n\n0:47:07 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nOh, wow, so the second generation, the new one, the a95l. So you know, sometimes they're kind of delayed, but and I don't expect to see a huge discount in black November For the a95l, this top of the line, flagship Sony TV, that's the king of TVs. But there are others within the Sony lineup and Samsung and Hisense and LG, tcl and Visio, and I listed those lines in my spreadsheet this year, yeah, which has some general notes about. You know, the, the QTO leads are the best TVs you can buy today. Period end of story. They just are so.\n\n0:47:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd so I mean probably the ones you've put in this spreadsheet. Like we just talked about, the QTO leads will not be majorly discounted, probably not Friday probably not.\n\n0:48:10 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAnd yet the LG OLEDs, many of them probably will be.\n\n0:48:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, and I think those by the way, that's not those are to me, because I'm like watching that in a darkened room a little bit closer Fantastic, just as good. Yeah, I don't think the yeah, I mean the QTO led has advantages. But is the color accuracy is good on this? On the LG's yes, colors it's good if you're not seeing as huge a difference in the darks and the lights, correct that dynamic.\n\n0:48:41 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nWell, I wouldn't say that. I necessarily say that the OLED, the regular OLED, does have almost infinite contrast, oh, as does the QTO.\n\n0:48:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, it's the number of it's, the number of nits for the very brightest stuff is higher. On QTO, let correct current. If you're in a darkened room that could blind you.\n\n0:49:02 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYou don't need all those.\n\n0:49:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo if you're able to darken the room, then the LG's would be just fine just fine, completely fine, great, in fact.\n\n0:49:12 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI would be thrilled, super happy with that.\n\n0:49:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nI, yeah, I feel spoiled now with With a good OLED TV or the QTO led, I'm watching sports looks better. Mmm movies are gorgeous, oh yeah everything is just. Better. It's better than the theater, practically. I can't wait. I saw Oppenheimer on IMAX. I can't wait to see what it looks like at home on a really good screen. It won't be a big.\n\n0:49:41 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nIt won't be. It Won't be as big, that's won't. It won't. Shift aspect ratio. Do you remember that, or did you not notice?\n\n0:49:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere was a little bit of that. It always made sense in context because it happened when we went back in time. Yes, so In a way it was a signal Okay, this is, this is present, this is present day, this is passes. They also had a day. They also had black and white IMAX. They made a special film just for Christopher Nolan so that he could shoot black and white because I max doesn't have a black and white film and the black and white was gorgeous.\n\nI can't wait to see that. Oh, do well, let's do well with black and white. Oh sure, yeah, I thought so because I was watching Casablanca the other night and they've got a remastered version of Casablanca that supposedly HDR.\n\n0:50:29 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI guess it could be and it could be it was shot on film originally. You can scan that in HDR, sure, and it looked so rich.\n\n0:50:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nthe I when, when black and white is well shot, you know an Ansel Adams still, or the film noir, a movie, yeah, it looks so good.\n\n0:50:46 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI agree.\n\n0:50:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe other thing Lisa and I noticed we were watching Band of Brothers was just shot on film, and then it's sequel Pacific, because the air war is coming out, the third of the three, and Lisa and I noticed how much we like film, even on an OLED.\n\n0:51:02 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYou know, a lot of people feel the same way, a lot of people do, and there's very few people shooting on film anymore.\n\n0:51:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut Band of Brothers, which is hugely emotional, but it's also an action movie, right, it's mm-hmm, but the emotion, see, I don't know why, maybe because it's 24 frames, or I just it. Really it isn't 24 frames, I guess because it's a TV. Yeah, well, it can be yeah, but it's not a most movies.\n\n0:51:29 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI'm a movie good TVs can can show 24 frames at 24 frame?\n\n0:51:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't think they. I mean they were shooting it for HBO, for television, so I doubt.\n\n0:51:37 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nWell, I'm 24 frames well, but if they shot it on film, they it probably was shot at 20, maybe.\n\n0:51:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere is. Maybe there's a dreaminess or something that you get there is just there's. There's some motion blur, for example, which it somehow hits you harder in the, in the heart you know this is very interesting that you say this, because you're not the only one.\n\n0:52:00 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nA lot of people say that the the quality of cinema, of Shooting on film some people call it a filmic effect Really is something. It has greater emotional impact, for example. You know, I I haven't seen that personally, I haven't experienced that personally, but I fully believe that you had. You did experience it and it's important.\n\n0:52:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, and it's interesting because you and I have had these conversations, I'm kind of aware of it. But Lisa, completely independently, said this was shot on film, wasn't it? And I said, yes, it was. I can really tell Interesting, yeah, and you see the grain. I mean, I mean you could tell you see the grain, but I don't think that's what she's talking about. She prefers it no, and I think it's the emotion.\n\n0:52:52 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n0:52:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHi I actually think it comes down to the filmmakers who choose to shoot on film.\n\n0:52:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, and this is Spielberg and Hanks, right, nobody loves film more than Spielberg.\n\n0:53:03 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nSo it's like, it's like Right that really make it that good.\n\n0:53:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, oh, absolutely. But I think even some older movies, like Casablanca, because it's shot on film, that richness of the black and white again, though, casablanca is like a classic yeah it's and by a great filmmaker, right? So, yeah, well, that's right, benito, right? I mean, I could shoot film and it wouldn't look great.\n\n0:53:30 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nRight, exactly, well, so, yeah, so I'm getting back to black November. If you can afford an OLED and there's one on a good deal I would say, get it. If not, lcd TVs are still, generally speaking, less expensive than OLEDs, and so that's what this list really is that I sent you. It's a list of the LCD based TVs that I consider the the higher quality, and so you know, if you want to save a little more than an OLED, you you could get one of these and and you'd be very happy and and and so if you're very price sensitive, mm-hmm, do you think you can get a black Friday deal like a $800 TV?\n\n0:54:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nthat's still very, very good.\n\n0:54:19 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nProbably so, wouldn't be very large. Again, one of these TVs in a 55 or 65 inch you could probably, on in the black Friday marketplace, get it for a thousand or less yeah.\n\n0:54:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe're the reason we don't they had. Those numbers are basically not out yet and you're not going to be on again for another month.\n\n0:54:40 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nBy then we'll be talking about, which is why I wanted to do this.\n\n0:54:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know, maybe we have to get you back closer to a black Friday. Yeah, we could. I'd be happy to do that. I guess that would be two weeks from now. I would be two weeks, yeah, all right. Well, man, let's get a little little over a little. I don't look. Scott, you're probably feeling some relief that you net don't have to prepare that 80 page, do you still? Yeah, that's a lot of work.\n\n0:55:06 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI'm sure it's a lot of work, you know, but people, I think people Find it valuable.\n\n0:55:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nAre you gonna do it for this show for your home theater geeks? Hadn't thought about that. You know you're gonna probably cover this on home theater geeks actually, yeah, probably so. So let's just say that this is a chance to promote the club. If you're not a member of the club, home theater geeks, it's in club twit Every. Is it Thursday, scott? When do you do that?\n\n0:55:32 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nThursday we post Thursdays at four. Okay, we normally record four or five episodes at once, so you have you already recorded. Next, I'm a. I'm afraid I have recorded most of this month already. Oh, okay, so we'll never mind.\n\n0:55:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere are some great episodes coming up there are.\n\n0:55:51 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nDon't. Don't get me wrong. I've answered a couple of really good listener questions.\n\n0:55:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love this conversation we have every time and we often end up talking about quality and style, and you know.\n\n0:56:00 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nExactly, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:56:03 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYeah, anyway. So there you go, it's uh. If you want, if you're gonna buy an LCD TV, check out this list. Those are the better ones. If you really are super price sensitive, go for whatever floats your boat. I generally recommend not going with the Third tier TV brands like element and insignia and so on.\n\n0:56:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nThose are kind of house brands, right. They are, yeah, best buy, but the other low-price leaders, high sense and TCL, the Chinese brands. Those are both really good.\n\n0:56:34 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nGood, yeah, really good. I can fully recommend them. Yes, we we.\n\n0:56:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nI recently moved my mom into assisted living and she brought her TCL with her and it was a very good choice because it could get the cable, because they have cable TV as Because it had Roku built-in. She has a Roku remote and so she. She doesn't need any extra boxes, she doesn't need any extra complications, is all in one remote, much simpler. And I upgraded to the high-end remote, roku remote, which has a headphone jack. So she we've been doing all this stuff. Remember we talked about this stick so she could use wireless headphones. I realized what am I talking about. She plugs her headphones into the remote. She sits a far away from the TV. It works great, love that. So it's a perfect solution for an elder.\n\n0:57:21 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI always thought that was a great idea.\n\n0:57:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nheadphone yeah, that idea that they had. It was just brilliant, really good.\n\n0:57:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo I, you know I got right on a lot of boxes and you know she had an Apple TV and a cable box and all that stuff. It's so simple. Now she plugs into the wall. The TV does have to be on the internet to get the television guy for the cable, unfortunately, and of course it has to for the Roku to for the Roku for streaming, sure, but Other than that, it is the simplest possible way for her to watch and she watches.\n\nShe was just watching Band of Brothers. She watches all sorts of great stuff on a variety of networks Thanks to that, so that's a good. The TCLs are very nice. There are others with Roku built-in now.\n\n0:58:02 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYes, yes, there are. Okay, I believe high-sense has some okay. Tcl is the main one yeah.\n\n0:58:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I really like that. And of course, then there's the Amazon TV with a fire built-in. Have you played with that at all?\n\n0:58:16 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI have not okay down the road, has their own branded TV. It's cheap.\n\n0:58:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah yeah, there's a fire TV built-in.\n\n0:58:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, yeah, they really have subsidized the cost on those TVs, yeah seriously, seriously.\n\n0:58:29 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nIn that case there's I believe there's two lines. I would recommend the higher line, which is still probably really cheap Because I believe it has the FALD Fald Backlight, full array local dimming very important for an LCD TV makes it a lot better.\n\n0:58:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, maybe we'll leave all these TVs that I recommend at believe that as a topic for another day, but I bet you Amazon. I bring it up because I think Amazon will probably have a massive Prime day sale on the yep fire TVs. No doubt they go as big as 55 inches. The 55 inch Fire TV's $269.00. What the what? You might as well just get one for every room right. Holy cow.\n\n0:59:17 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nGoes up to 55. What about? Isn't there an Omni series? That might be the upper.\n\n0:59:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, oh yeah, you want to go to the next one up. That's the fourth series. Well, here we go. Now we're talking expensive. It goes all the way up to 75 inches for $899.\n\n0:59:32 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nThere you go, 900 bucks and these are all that are.\n\n0:59:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, these are Q let's, these are Q let's. Get me every time with that little Q. I know that's marketing difference between the tail.\n\n0:59:44 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYeah exactly.\n\n0:59:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nScott Wilkinson, follow him at home theater, geeks in our club and, of course, every month right here on the show.\n\n0:59:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThank, you Scott. Thank you Mr.\n\n1:00:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe'll get more of you, oh, oh what, what I've?\n\n1:00:05 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nthis is my last chance to the Christmas mentioned, to the Christmas.

No, it's only in person. You can't stream a hundred tubas.\n\n1:00:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, you gotta be in the driveway, didn't you? Oh, that's right. What's that?

But they also have and I know a lot of people like this a Really great web interface. In fact, I like it so much I put Fastmail. I use it on iOS and Android, but on the desktop, even though I have, you know, Apple Mail and all the other mail programs. I actually tend to use the Fastmail Web interface because it's so powerful, it's so good. They have quick settings so you can easily choose a new theme, switch between light and dark mode, change your text size, all without leaving the Fastmail screen you're on.\n\nYou can create new mass email addresses, show or hide your reading pane. You could switch between folders and labels and more. I have it set up to auto save context, so if I reply to somebody, they're automatically in my context. The other reason that's a nice thing to do. It's easy to set up a filter so that you only see email from people you know. You can put the email from everybody else somewhere else in another folder. You can also choose to show public images of senders. They use gravatar and other services, so I have pictures next to all the email so I know who I'm talking to, even if I've never met you. You could set default reminders for events.\n\nOh, I should say this calendars and Contacts built in. In fact, it's so good I stopped using Google Calendar, google Contacts and Google Mail and and even Google notes that I use all through Fastmail. It's web, dav, cal, dav, card, dav, so it's all troops. You know standard protocols because they're an open source company, and so Now my calendar sync was much better. By the way, with Fastmail, I can turn on notifications for calendar alerts.

Or you can have your own domain. In fact, every time I have a domain, I set up mail through Fastmail and it's just so much better, so much easier.

They all go into my main inbox and then I can sort based on which domain, which address. It really helps you keep Organized, the best filtering, the best rules anywhere.

We thank him so much for Not only the support of this show, but everything that we've done for us, for done for me personally for so many years. I just love Fastmail. Should I do a I can reach back? Uh uh, uh. Get an email. Time for an email. I like to pretend that's hard. I played pickleball for the first time yesterday, did you like it? My pickleball arm a little sore, I'm a lefty, but yeah, I had Lisa and I had so much fun. Have you ever played?\n\n1:07:40 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI've not played, but for some reason it seems to be really in right now.\n\n1:07:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a tennis for old people, okay. So you get a bracket that's solid it kind of looks like it's size of a racquetball racket, but it's solid and then you use a wiffle ball. It's like a wiffle ball, it's probably a little different, so the court's tiny, you don't have to run as much, and it's really fun.\n\n1:08:01 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThe ball is a little bit slower coming back down. Yeah, yeah, nice.\n\n1:08:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was invented where Stacy Hickenbotham lives in Bainbridge Island, washington. Stacey's husband is a big pickle baller, wow, and I thought you know I should play and we did. It was so much fun. Cool. But that's not what this message is about. From reshaw Can't use iPhone ring tones as text tones. Oh, this is for you, mr iOS today host. I have been experiencing an issue with my iPhone after this 17 iOS 17 update. I can no longer use ring tones I've purchased uh from iTunes as text tones. They must put them somewhere else. I've tried several options, including a restore, but the issue persists. Can I, can you help me? So you bought reshaw, bought her or his ring tones. See, I've never bought ring tones Airplay, I don't even know what that's like Airplay one, please, our airplay two is Leo airplay.\n\n1:08:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, he's not airplay. I'm not airplay. Okay, then I'll do airplay one. So there is a button that you can press and I'm wondering if you have pressed it in the settings menu. If you go into sound, okay, um, if you go into sounds and haptics, uh, and you go into text tone or in ring tone or any of them, you'll see, right at the top there's a section that says store, and within store there is a button that says download all purchased tones. Um, from there it will see if you've ever purchased a tone. So there was a tone that I purchased from, uh, I think I've purchased a tone. You'll see if you've ever purchased a tone. So there was a tone that I purchased from, uh a the minion movie at one point. What does it sound like? He's so fluffy, I'm going to die. That's what it says. And it's this little girl who has this fluffy stuffed animal.\n\n1:09:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nProbably don't want that as a ring tone, but let's say so. You bought it. What it's? Just a tone, is it like? Do they call it a ring tone?\n\n1:09:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's okay, yeah, from from specifically from the.\n\n1:10:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nbut let's say, you wanted it as an alert instead of a ring, so let's a new email. Let's say for okay.\n\n1:10:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo let's say you wanted to use it for new mail. I could tap on new mail, yeah, and then I would choose download all purchased tones.\n\n1:10:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, you have to download them there too, yep, and then it'll pop up, and there he's, so fluffy.\n\n1:10:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOkay, and so I think probably what you needed to do is just tap that uh download button Now, if it is. If, if that button is not showing up, I would recommend tapping on the tone store button, because this can sometimes kick uh the system into going oh right, so you need to look to see if there have been any any tones that were purchased.\n\nOh my God, I must have bought some tones at one point a hundred years ago, because I just pushed that button and it's downloading something so you've got something I don't know what it's going to be and there, yeah, then it will take you also to the ring tone store, and all of these tones should be able to be used as alerts or as ring tones. Are you kidding me? Show them. These are awful.\n\n1:10:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's the Super Mario mushroom. I'm embarrassed that I bought these.\n\n1:10:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet's see what that sounds like.\n\n1:11:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nUh, it's still downloading. Yes, so I must have bought these ages ago. Um, so, okay, so you can do it, but you have to do it in the alert section or the text tone section and then and then download. Exactly, download it there, so downloading it simply in the ring tone section, right?\n\n1:11:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhichever place, exactly wherever you're wanting to actually have it show up, you need to hit that download button. And now there's mine. I'm so busy I'm gonna die. Would you use that? I used to because at the time A I was surrounded by people who also had goofy tones, and so we'd all laugh at each other as they were playing. But now I don't ever have tones turned on at all. You don't have any friends anymore.\n\n1:11:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't. I also have no friends. Nobody calls me. Here's my ring tone for the generic one. It's amazing, it's the. It's an old twit theme that somebody made for me Round the board. That's a good one, that is a good one. And then, uh, that's my ring tone, and then my text tone. Oh, it's still a default. I don't, I didn't want it to be. Oh no, it was this, it's passage. I like there aren't a lot of good text tones.\n\n1:12:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJust subtle.\n\n1:12:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh there, here, yeah it's not very loud, but I don't want it to be very loud, right, I just wanted the little note that I've that I've been alerted.\n\n1:12:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I just never have alerts turned on, it's always just buzzing. Oh, you're always quiet. Yeah, I don't like sounds playing around the only reason I bought this.\n\n1:12:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh it's not playing. Oh, because I have it. Maybe because it's too long for a text tone. It's really a ring tone. Why did I buy that?\n\n1:12:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat is so funny, it's. Rihanna right, yes.\n\n1:12:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhy did I buy that?\n\n1:12:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't know, but it's like early 2000s.\n\n1:12:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's when I bought it. That's so funny to me. That's when I bought it a long time ago.\n\n1:13:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI imagine you at the doctor's office and you're looking around in your pockets as Rihanna is playing on your phone. And that's so funny to me because everybody would be like why is this older white gentlemen?\n\n1:13:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nAren't ring tones embarrassing? Now, though, yes, they are. You don't want that as your ring tone Don't do ring tones. No.\n\n1:13:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIn fact, I think having your phone make any sound around other people is embarrassing. It's like why are you making noise? This is the default on the new iPhone.\n\n1:13:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think that's pretty good. I don't mind that.\n\n1:13:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThe only time my phone makes a sound out loud is the alarm in the morning.\n\n1:13:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh see, now this is a bone of contention In my household. Lisa has the most annoying alarm and she gets up at six in the morning. Oh, and I don't want to get up at six in the morning, but I have to hear an alarm. What's your alarm sound?\n\n1:13:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMine is. It's called early riser. Yeah, I don't like the name already I don't like it, and it does a slow kind of lead in.\n\n1:14:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, it builds up, so you can, if you were so inclined, lean over and quickly silence it.\n\n1:14:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, and that's often what happens Before somebody. Yeah, and honestly, I don't really I have it because I have trust issues with myself, because it's actually my eight sleep that wakes me up. Yeah, it buzzes me. I like that.\n\n1:14:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is another one You'll say in my name that's another one. I bought.\n\n1:14:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI am without I must have bought these. You'll say you'll know same.\n\n1:14:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know tomorrow. Okay, gotcha, I don't know nothing about tomorrow. It's only today. It's stopped and won't stop either. That's another problem. Let's go back to this, this is the song that never ends. I think this is very. This is interesting. I think if, if you were going out on a date with somebody and you want to really get to know them, maybe one of the first questions is what is your ringtone? What's your ringtone, what's your alarm tone? And if it's yours, if it's if it's Rihanna, you maybe think twice.\n\n1:15:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI'm saying I, I would say I would say that if you ask someone born after 2000, they would tell you that they don't have a ringtone because I anecdotally, but you don't, but you have to have a ring. Well, yeah, sorry, then it's set to the default. But they're saying they would tell you I don't ever make it make a sound. No, they all anecdotally, everyone who I've heard from they make sure their phones are on silence.\n\n1:15:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't ever want to hear it. Yeah, there was a time I don't know if maybe you're too young to remember this where you would make a separate ringtone for everybody person, yep. So like when my mom called you know, and they were funny too. I would always choose funny things. Yeah, I remember that and I think, when my son called I'd play the chicken dance, I mean, so that way you you know who's calling and B you could play a little, make a little fun. Sometimes I get people mad. Yeah, they hear their ringtone.\n\n1:16:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhat the hell, that's not nice. Hey man, why is my ringtone chicken dance?\n\n1:16:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat's wrong? I have separate vibrations set up for a few people, oh you do so that I know, oh, that's your phone only vibrates and never rings, never rings. But that means you have to have it in your pocket all the time, right?\n\n1:16:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWell, I also get a watch. Yeah, I guess you're right. And if it, yeah, and then if it's not in my hand, or and I'm not wearing my watch, then you just don't have things change.\n\n1:16:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nI mean when Rishio said I bought I tech tones.\n\n1:16:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI thought who buys ringtones? Right, but I have. Yeah, we did in the past, exactly.\n\n1:16:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat was a big money maker for the phone companies I loved buying ringtones yeah. They made. They were 99 cents, but they would only work for three months, a lot of times.\n\n1:16:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh yeah, that's right. It was kind of like subscription.\n\n1:16:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was like that was a sneaky little. Those clever, clever cats. I love Rihanna. No, no hate here. Yeah, Nothing wrong with Rihanna, Love Rihanna. I bought this ringtone. But I don't want to hear that. When the phone Right, when you're going to a song, that's a different thing. Yeah.\n\n1:17:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, I was listening to Rihanna just the other day.\n\n1:17:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nI like her that much.\n\n1:17:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd you like her enough to pronounce it Rihanna, which is the real way her name is pronounced. You gave me a hard time when I said I know I was shocked. Yeah, you taught me that. No, it's Rihanna.\n\n1:17:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe quesious and RIS. He says when my guy called it played watermelon man. What is that? I've never heard somebody go in the hall. The lights just went on, oh no.\n\n1:17:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt might just now noticing this. We need to do like a Roomba out there with something on it. Yeah.\n\n1:17:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nAll right, let's take another another call. Yeah, let's do a call. How about John? He's got his hand up. We'll send John.\n\n1:17:43 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJohn's trying to run back like no, I had a plan John come on back, john, hurry up, john, you've gone into the room.\n\n1:17:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nPress. What is it? Star six, star six to unmute.\n\n1:17:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, you don't have to do that, it's only with phone calls. Oh, I know.\n\n1:17:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know nothing. It was zoom calls. You don't have to press. I'm basically in the backseat. I'm a passenger. You need to unmute on your end.\n\n1:18:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSee, he does. Yes, but not with star six. That's only if you're on the phone. There's a Hi.\n\n1:18:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nJohn. Hi John, when are you calling from? I'm in St Petersburg, florida, love it and I love the, the, the, the Mexican blanket you have behind you there.\n\n1:18:20 - Caller\n\nThat's it's actually an old towel, I think, for maybe hand me down. I love the towel.\n\n1:18:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a beautiful towel.\n\n1:18:27 - Caller\n\nYou didn't have to tell me.\n\n1:18:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou didn't have to say that. You could have just said, yes, I bought that when I was in Tijuana.\n\n1:18:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou didn't, but I think John hasn't taken improv classes, so it's not aware of the yes and yes, yes, and it is a Mexican.\n\n1:18:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, my mother wore. It Wove that for me when I was a child.\n\n1:18:45 - Caller\n\nSo how can we help you? Well, first off, love the show. I've used your, your information to make myself sound smarter than I am, so, but I really appreciate what you guys do, so thanks for that. Yeah, I think you're from the Mexican, I T no, but somehow. I always ended up helping people. You're the guy. Just from the knowledge I get from you guys. Two guys, yep, yeah, but I always give you credit.\n\n1:19:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nI say it's from it's from Leo and like they go. That's very kind and they are and they would be.\n\n1:19:21 - Caller\n\nSo let us help you then with something else. Sure, so I'm. I think this is a similar question to what you guys were talking about. I'm trying to help my mom out. She bought iTunes songs. I hope this is an easy question, but I haven't been able to figure it out. It is, I know where you're going, but keep going.\n\n1:19:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, a long, long time ago she wants to turn into ringtones. Well, no, no she, she has an.\n\n1:19:46 - Caller\n\nAndroid phone and she bought all these songs and she, she still has her old iPods, which are really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really. She still has her old iPods, which are They've got to be, you know, forever. They're like one of the original iPods she still has and so she'll. She has the songs you know on there, but she wants to be able to play them in her car and stuff like that, like through her phone, and she has an Android phone. So, you know, since she spent the money on them, she has like 600 songs or something like that that she's purchased through iTunes and I'm trying to figure it out. There's a way to I don't know, I don't know maybe get them out of iTunes or get them onto her Android phone in a way that she can access them easily through her phone.\n\n1:20:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, so there are a few ways. First, if she wanted to, she could download on Android the Apple Music app and gain access to the songs that way. But if these were purchased in the time before Apple Music, they are just audio files, and so if they are on iTunes on a Windows machine or on iTunes on a Mac, you can simply export them and import them however you might want to. So, depending on the Android device, of course, the music player might be in a different place, you might be using a different kind of music player, but they all have the ability to read right from an SD card or read from internal storage the music, and it looks like Leo's got some apps to suggest.\n\n1:21:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, and this is also because Apple stopped putting copy protection on their music some years ago. Yeah, from now. Now, if she bought the songs before that, they may still have copy protection on them.\n\n1:21:29 - Caller\n\nYeah, I can't remember what our problem was, but for some reason I've struggled to make it work. So I don't know, maybe it may be the copy protection on it still, they are from their ancient, so I think it was probably a long long ago, because nowadays they're just AAC files and any Android app can play them.\n\n1:21:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, and if you never use iTunes Match to get, the more, by the way that's the only as far as I.\n\n1:21:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, there's two ways, Okay, there's the legal way and there's the illegal way. So the legal way is to give Apple 25 bucks, and this might actually be worth it. You pay 25 bucks a year for something they call iTunes Match. I just recently turned it off.\n\n1:22:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I don't need it anymore.\n\n1:22:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut what it would do is it matches all the songs in our library with uncopy protected and, in some cases, higher quality versions of those songs. It replaces them. And that's what Apple did when it went from copy protected to uncopy protected as a kind of sop to the music industry. The music industry's hair caught on fire and they said you're taking out any piracy. And they said well, look, what we'll do is we'll charge people 25 bucks. We'll give some of that back to you. Everybody will be happy. So that's why that was there and that's why it's still there and I don't think you really need it anymore. But if you have old copy protected versions of the songs, that's the legal way to do it. The truth is, you can strip off that copy protection. There are many ways to do it.\n\nFor years I used something called Double Twist and I was just going to doubletwistcom. They're still around. I mean there's not as much demand for what they do. This was created by the guy who figured out how to crack DVD copy protection. But they do have a Double Twist Android player that I bet you. This is. The first thing I would do is just see if it plays the old copy protected Apple music, because that's what Double Twist's big thing was was it would play the copy protected music. I think they call it magic play, but I don't know. Anyway, if they no longer do that, they might not. You know there's some legal liability with breaking copy protection. Then you can pay Apple the 25 bucks or you could just do a little research. Now that you know that that's what the problem is, you can go and there's places you can find stuff to crack it.\n\n1:23:51 - Caller\n\nOkay. So she's, you know, not very tech savvy, but she keeps up to date with the Samsung phone, so I think it's one of the newer models Good.\n\n1:23:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nThose are great phones.\n\n1:24:01 - Caller\n\nBut she doesn't know anything about, like, what kind of music player to use. So do you guys have a recommendation?\n\n1:24:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, samsung has one. It's on there, it's called music. Yeah, that's, I would recommend it.\n\n1:24:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIf she's not super tech savvy to use, in this case, use the built-in. If you're asking about podcasts, I would still say to go to Pocketcast and whatever Samsung offers, but because it's gonna have the deepest integration and however you two choose to get the music into a place that can then be read by that music library, samsung music is gonna be the best option because you know that it will be able to read the music and play it and, you know, get to everything Right.\n\n1:24:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nSpeaking of today, it won't read copy protect songs. Yeah, so that's your first issue is it are these copy protected? I suspect they are. How do I get rid of it? 25 bucks, itunes match that's the legal, fair, safe way to do it. Or Go online and look, for there are a lot of programs will strip the copy protection out of songs. But in order to do that, you've got to get those songs off of the old phone or an iPod onto your computer and then process them if they're already on the back. It'll work.\n\n1:25:08 - Caller\n\nWell, she has a very old laptop. It's not a Mac, it might be a Lenovo. I think it's a Lenovo and it's it's. It's pretty ancient, but I don't think we were able to log in on a different computer to get in and find those songs, so you think they're still locally on the machine. Yeah, we, I think we tried to figure out how to get into iTunes and find them, and the only place we've been able to find them is on her computer that she originally used.\n\n1:25:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd it's so. Apple dropped the protection in 2009. You think those songs are are more than 15 14 years old. I Think so. Yeah, I think so. So there's still copy protected.\n\n1:25:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo there's a lot of machine.\n\n1:25:55 - Caller\n\nI think maybe to. To get rid of the copy protection first, maybe yeah.\n\n1:26:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nOr you can burn them to a audio CD and Then rip the CD. You know I'm not crazy about that because that might degrade that the quality of it, but you can do that. That's called the analog hole. Yeah, she's not using a Mac. I don't think iTunes match will work.\n\n1:26:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMaybe, Windows just now, if she can download iTunes.\n\n1:26:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nShe could do that.\n\n1:26:28 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, iTunes match works with the latest version of Windows. Okay.\n\n1:26:32 - Caller\n\nAnd then, if we did that would, would I be able to log in on a different computer and still find?\n\n1:26:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthose, they're just files yeah copy them to a thumb drive and you can do anything you want, but also because you've iTunes matched them, they will have a cloud analog that you could then, yes, oh yeah, it's already.\n\n1:26:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, part of iTunes match stores it in the cloud, so you can stream it to anywhere, that's part of, so you would be able to download it on a new machine at that point.\n\n1:26:57 - Caller\n\nYeah, yeah yeah, just because her machine so old. I'd love to as quickly as possible. Yes, because she's gonna lose them?\n\n1:27:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nif yeah, yep, I choose. Match is also a backup, so that's really what I want to do, yeah.\n\n1:27:11 - Caller\n\nOkay, and then this may be a dumb question, but what file format? If I'm from trying to get them to, I guess stamps them's music app? What I'm File format, what I need to remove it, I don't know download them it doesn't matter.\n\n1:27:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut MP3 is the most common. Apples will be m4a or aac files and I would say that's modern. Any modern phone should be able to handle those. Yeah, but if you really want to make, universal Universal plays, no matter where you a little sand disc player or whatever MP3.\n\n1:27:47 - Caller\n\nAnd then when I connect a cable to the phone from the computer to add them to her Samsung music.\n\n1:27:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's one way of doing it. Oh, so that's with the Samsung phone. It needs to be in a special mode, right where it becomes a hard drive that the computer can see it, can't you?\n\n1:28:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nCan't you download them from Apple onto?\n\n1:28:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthe phone. You could, but you would have to play them through Apple, the Apple music app. I don't think that it would give Outside access to it.\n\n1:28:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nSee, this is part of the problem of the way phones work, is it? When you download, it stores it in a folder that you don't have access to from the music folder? But you might. This gets a little weird and complicated and it might just take some experimentation, but Apple Will. That music is in the cloud, so you can use a Samsung browser to log into the cloud. Right, yes, I cloud account.\n\nYeah, and there's the music and there's a little cloudy button with a down arrow and you could press that down arrow on each of them and it will download them. Yeah, it will then put them, though not into the music folder, but the download folder. It may be I think it is that the Apple, that the Samsung music player will will be able to see them. If not, then you have to move it from the download folder to a music folder. But I think that Most of the time on Android, when you get a music file, it wakes up and says oh hey, that's music. Do you want? Yeah, do you have access music to have access to that folder, and you say yes.\n\n1:29:11 - Caller\n\nOkay, all right, we'll get about all that a try. It's um, it's just been kind of a frustrating.\n\n1:29:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't know, I thought it would be easier.\n\n1:29:18 - Caller\n\nYeah, I just figured it'd be easier than this.\n\n1:29:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is why copy protection is horrible, and Notice, by the way, that the world didn't end after 2009, that the music industry didn't die. You know, it was just. It was a waste of everybody's time and the only people who were ever bothered by copy protection. We're honest people, because every single pirate knows exactly how to remove it. It's trivial, like like I've been telling you she paid for these songs.\n\n1:29:45 - Caller\n\nThat's why we're you know she's on my case. That's her music library.\n\n1:29:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, even if she didn't pay for them. I have a you know a couple of terabytes of music. I don't want to lose that. That's of course. Nowadays the Young's Don't buy music anymore, they stream it.\n\n1:30:04 - Caller\n\nand yeah, I told her that I was like listen, you just stream, that's what everybody's doing. And she quickly was like I'm not having any other.\n\n1:30:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nI bought those records and I'm gonna play them.\n\n1:30:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI have to tell you, though, I, when I've my grandma, was about it too, and then I showed her and she said wait, I can just listen to any song I want to, any time.\n\n1:30:21 - Caller\n\nAnd then she was like can I?\n\n1:30:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nlisten to this and I typed it in for wait, I can. What? What about this and it? When I did the object lesson, is that what it is? Then? That's whenever the the realization kicked in, and she's been an Apple music subscriber ever since right, yeah, I mean that far she just oh, she still is not. She was losing the money that she spent. Oh yeah, I dressed the original. She doesn't have to pay a monthly fee.\n\n1:30:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nI mean she owns it. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, and if that's all she ever wants to listen to, she's got it her music taste is locked in.\n\n1:30:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMusic taste is locked in.\n\n1:30:55 - Caller\n\nShe well, kind of she did kind of say that she's like I know what I like and I already paid for these, so I'm not willing to accept your streaming solution, because that's throwing money away.\n\n1:31:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, fair enough mom, although I gotta be fair, there is a free Spotify. You'll have some ads in there, that's true and it still has more. I don't know six million songs, how many songs it is, every song basically, yeah, everything man well good yeah, we have to let us know how it goes.\n\nThank you, yeah, we this is complicated but it's not. It's one of those things is like Easy, but there's a lot of different things you have to figure out. Figure out the route to take. The Spotify play is an ad for every song.\n\n1:31:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, I don't have a free spot. I'm sure it feels like that I know, I, I. If I could be the, the Streaming music fairy and go around and grant friends and colleagues with a subscription, I would, because anytime I've been at someone's house and they're playing their Spotify and then an ad comes on like what a kind of. Please, I'll give you eight dollars if you subscribe right now. I can't listen to these.\n\n1:32:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nDora, to you know I use yeah, same thing. Yeah, penta penguin and IRC says pay for her music streaming for a year and then take it away and see what she says.\n\n1:32:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo me, that's me. That sounds like a lab rat he's me situation.\n\n1:32:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nHey, pleasure talking to you. Thank you for calling. Yeah, thank you, thanks, take care.\n\n1:32:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe're five minutes out from Johnny jet.\n\n1:32:33 - Leo Laporte\n\nI want another call, or do you have some good voicemails? Cute up.\n\n1:32:37 - John Ashley\n\nWe have boys have voicemails.\n\n1:32:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, let's play them. Play them, partner, cool. All right, that was fun. Vinnie apparently was watching the eclipse.\n\n1:32:53 - Caller\n\nOkay, durham, north Carolina. Yeah, about 10 years ago I realized I didn't like all the ads I was seeing as I was browsing the internet. So pops on Reddit tried to find an ad blocker. They recommended ad block plus. Up time put it in my chrome and I just haven't really thought about it for 10 years. It's still installed. I can see it. I was wondering it's stopping. It's not working as well as it used to. I'm seeing a lot more ads and Are there recommendations you have on better ad blockers? Are there privacy considerations around even having an ad blocker that can see all the traffic? Thanks for any help you can give easy peasy.\n\n1:33:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere's only one that Steve Gibson recommends that I recommend that I use, and I bet you use yep, and we like it, because it's by a cranky guy. His name is handles gore hill and he's cranky, cranky, cranky guy and he doesn't know it. Is he not like ads? He doesn't. He's very big on privacy, so he's Unlike, by the way, ad block and ad block Plus, I don't read, which I don't recommend. He also doesn't do a deal with advertisers to let some ads through.\n\nAd block has something it called it created, called the acceptable ads policy, in which they said these ads are okay, and I guess they are. It's unclear why they're okay, maybe because they gave money to ad block. We don't know that though. Well, we don't know, but I I just just want to make that. I don't want to get sued, I don't know what, why, but I don't. If you were, if you're running an ad blocker, I think the position is no ad is acceptable. Yeah, now, I personally think there is an ethical issue with this, because ads are what supports those sites you go to. But I completely and, by the way, our podcast, but I completely understand the. You know, especially on mobile, the problem you have with ads because they take over, they're dancing. There's a security issue with them. There's also I mean it's in the bandwidth use and etc. Etc. So I'm not gonna judge you.\n\nIf you want to block ads, there was only one to use. It's called you block origin. Gore Hill has created this. It is. There is a you block. That is not. There's a fork of his. Don't use you block. You block origin. It works on chrome. I think it works on chrome. It works on I'm using Firefox, so that's why it's showing the Firefox logo. It is a very nice ad blocker. It does not work on Safari, right, because Apple has basically changed the way and they say for privacy. So your issue of well, do they see everything? Apple has changed, how extensions work to protect your privacy, they say, but it also happens to break ad blockers. Chrome is about to do the same thing, pretty much. So I can't promise this works on chrome, but it does work on Firefox.\n\nYeah, for now it works on chrome, not gonna for it, not going to work forever on chrome. I suspect Raymond Hill, gore Hill, is a a A, a living Hero Amongst people who don't like ads. He is the last cranky, last bastion. He does not. He's not gonna invade your privacy. They work. That works really well. Now there's an interesting battle going on because ad you know YouTube doesn't like ad blockers and YouTube has started to Go after the ad blockers and they try to watch YouTube with an ad blocker. I'll say sorry, you can't except this is a fight "
