The vaccine cheerleading during the pandemic was annoying. The pod got way too political during Trump’s presidency. I still enjoy the Mac/Apple podcast though.

Let them speak, most of the time they know more about the subject then you Leo. The $7 dollar paywall is hurting TWiT more then you know.

While I am not a fan of Mr. Musk, Laporte and Mr. “Big 3 Auto Guy” Sam do is hate on someone who puts their money where their mouth is and attempts to innovate.
