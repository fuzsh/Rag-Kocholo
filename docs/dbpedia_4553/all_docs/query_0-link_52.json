        "text": "Category: News\n\nGo Pro\n\nIt’s time to Go Pro with 1 Radio News.\n\nWatch our short Pro demo.\n\nJoin our community of vital supporters by subscribing (monthly/yearly) to Pro or make a one-time purchase for a lifetime of the app Pro features.\n\nWhy?\n\nSave Favorites – Keep the popular and obscure hourly and daily news programs in one place.\n\nPlayMix – Sort your Favorites into your own personalized radio “station.” Start playing shows from anywhere in your PlayMix and the app will just keep playing until it plays through all the latest episodes.\n\nSleep Timer –\n\nNo Digital Ads – No more full screen or banner on-screen ads. (All the audio ads are placed by the audio content producers, so we can’t do anything about that … we’ll you can always press the skip ahead 30 seconds button.)\n\nSearch – As our highly curated library grows, this is a quick way to dig in. All the audio programming in our app is free via podcasting, but often hard to find.\n\nAdvanced Audio Player – The more Pro supporters we get, the more features we can build.\n\nAlexa, play the BBC Global News Podcast on my Smart Speaker\n\nFrustrated by how your smart speaker just won’t play the “Global News Podcast” from the BBC?\n\nI am.\n\nOK, here is what you need to say precisely … Alexa,\n\n“play the Global News Podcast podcast” or\n\n“play the podcast Global News Podcast”\n\nYES, you must say “podcast” in two places. Don’t say “BBC.”\n\nDon’t expect these commands to work consistently:\n\nAlexa, play the Global News Podcast\n\nAlexa, play the BBC Global News Podcast\n\nAs long as I have your attention, here are some other handy news lovers voice commands:\n\nAlexa, …\n\n“open BBC headlines on BBC Sounds” … plays hourly news bulletin for five minutes\n\n“play BBC news” … plays the BBC World Service live stream\n\n“play BBC Radio 4” …live stream\n\n“play BBC Radio 5” … live stream\n\n“play the podcast Newshour on TuneIn” … MUST say “on TuneIn” or your Echo will play PBS Newshour\n\nHey, what about Google?\n\nOK, Google …\n\nplay BBC news … plays the hourly news bulletin from the BBC World Service\n\nThe BBC has their own tips on accessing their services on smart speakers.\n\nNews Podcasts Apps: Your Guide to Today’s News Radio On-Demand\n\nFinding lots of news podcasts is easy.\n\nFinding the best news podcasts to then quickly play today’s episode is more difficult.\n\nWhile you can use popular podcast apps to find news like Spotify’s popular news and politics, Apple Podcast’s daily news category and others, there is one news podcasts app that specializes in finding today’s news from the popular media sources.\n\nIt’s 1 Radio News. (on Android)\n\nOur philosophy is simple – when it comes to “news” you want new news.\n\nYou don’t want yesterday’s news and you don’t want to spend 10 minutes trying to find the “right” 10 minutes of news.\n\nYou want to quickly “change the station” if you want something different.\n\nHow is 1 Radio News a news podcasts player?\n\nUnlike your typical podcast app, as news lover, you don’t have to do this:\n\nSearch for a news podcast\n\nSelect the news podcast of interest\n\nSubscribe to the news podcast\n\nPick which episode you want to listen to\n\nDownload that episode\n\nPlay the episode\n\nListen\n\nWhen we started 10 years ago, we imagined pre-set buttons on your car radio, just press a button to change the channel and listen.\n\nSo with 1 Radio News, IF you are looking for the latest hourly news, you just open the app:\n\nScroll and press one button for the news source of interest\n\nListen\n\nOK, there are more options:\n\nStarting in your regional/national “Edition”\n\nScroll down and press the button of interest to play OR\n\nSwipe to over to HOURLY or SHOWS (daily) to the right for many global news sources in English\n\nPress a button and listen\n\nYou may also swipe to the left for dozens of LIVE news radio (and some TV audio) channels. Scroll down for “Easter eggs” with spoken-word radio channels including comedy.\n\nAlso, to the right, we have the bonus “SHORTS” section which highlights daily (M-F) short podcasts from Dad jokes to words of the day to today in history.\n\nCan I subscribe/follow specific news podcasts on 1 Radio News?\n\nYes! Try out our “Pro” level and support our extensive curation and app development.\n\nHere is how it works with Pro:\n\nFavorite the news podcasts (and live stations) you like.\n\nPro activates the Search option as well.\n\nOn the far left see “PLAYMIX” and sort your Favorites (from the LIST view you toggle on the top right)\n\nPress the Green Play All button on the bottom right. Or play an individual podcast.\n\nBy sorting your favorites, you are practically programming your own daily radio station.\n\nWe pioneered our easier to use “play all” concept five years before Amazon Alexa’s Flash briefings and Google Assistant’s news settings. We also have far more daily news podcasts available for your “play all” experience and not just hourly headlines.\n\nFinally, if you like listening to older news content or really want to know what’s in the episode before you listen, we do recommend that you use your traditional podcast app.\n\nTry 1 Radio News to see what we’ve discovered deep across the podcast world – that vitally still produce fresh content – and then search the ones you like best in your everyday podcast app to follow those new sources.\n\nUse 1 Radio News when you want to quickly play the latest news and other podcast players when you have extra time on your hand to go through lots of episodes to find the news topics that interest you most.\n\nWe specialize in curating global news podcasts in English as well as a great collection of national news podcasts from the United States.\n\nWant to WATCH the TV News?\n\nOver ten years ago we started with radio news.\n\nWe’ve spent HUNDREDS of hours sourcing hourly, daily, and live radio news for you so you can just press play and listen to headline from around the world in English.\n\nBUT sometimes you might be craving video. In fact, for those who remember the shortwave era, today all audio in general is secondary investment wise for “world services” or “external services.” Many more countries produce video to share their news, culture, and perspectives for global audiences.\n\nSo here are our tips for super world news junkies:\n\nInstall the TV News App on Android or the TV News Channel app on iOS.\n\nSet Favorites during the set up.\n\nGo to the ALL section and use the bottom filters. On the bottom left is “Region.” Buried in there is the option called “World Services.” Select it. Then on the right choose English or the Language or interest.\n\nFavorite a bunch of channels. From Mongolia and Thailand to Ukraine and France, you’ll find daily news in English.\n\nWhen you open the app “YOUR MIX” will show you the NEW video from the last 8 hours just from your Favs. Use the filters on the bottom to increase the number of videos per channel to 5 and the time frame up to 48 hours.\n\nLike our 1 Radio News app, our focus is squarely on NEW news from quality sources.\n\nOh, our TV News App has nearly 3,000 channels in 100 languages from most countries. We dig deep into YouTube and leverage their API and terms of services to bring what’s buried and fresh from just minutes ago to you.\n\nUkraine War Podcasts – Daily News about Russia’s war against Ukraine\n\n1 Radio News highlights a special group of podcasts about the Ukraine war and the Russian invasion.\n\nTry the 1 Radio News app on Android and go to the SHOWS section and scroll down a bit.\n\nYou will find five DAILY (M-F) podcasts to choose from:\n\nFlashpoint Ukraine from the Voice of America – Leveraging coverage from VOA’s global network (often published first each day)\n\nUkraine, the Latest – From the Daily Telegraph and their network of correspondents. They bring out the human story and provide wide analysis.\n\nUkraine War Brief – Linnea and Yewleea bring you up to speed on the War in Ukraine in about 20 minutes or less.\n\nHighlights from Ukraine – Summary of the latest news reported in the Ukrainian media. Get your favourite morning hot beverage and let’s deep dive into what Ukrainian media have been reporting the day before.\n\nPrivateer Station: War In Ukraine – Daily war diaries from Arestovych and Feygin translated into English from ФЕЙГИН LIVE (English translation also available on YouTube OR in our companion TV News App.)\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine War Report – From Malcontent News – analysis and assessments on how today’s stories shape the war’s future. Coverage includes the battlefront, geopolitics, economics, and human impact.\n\nState of the World (was Ukraine) from NPR – The shortest of the bunch, but now only occasionally about Ukraine\n\nRequest: Radio Ukraine International live streams in multiple languages including English – but has no technical podcast RSS feeds that we can find. They do have daily Ukraine: Security Issue and The Unbreakable available on-demand via the web. We’d like to get connected with the right people to offer our assistance to get their content into the powerful podcast world. Contact us.\n\nAs 1 Radio News focuses on daily and not weekly or irregular content (at this point anyway), there are additional podcasts to consider.\n\nHere’s a quick way to find the freshest episodes from podcasts about the conflict (with at least weekly episodes) that are active as of June, 2023:\n\nGearing up for our 10th Anniversary!\n\nIt’s hard to believe that 1 Radio News is now 10 years old.\n\nYears before Amazon’s Alexa brought us the flash briefing, the original 1 Radio News made it simple to just play hourly news headlines.\n\nOver the years we added daily news shows and then live news radio streams in English from around the world.\n\nWe remain the only Android “podcast” app that finds all the daily news sources for you and let’s you quickly play the latest episode by pressing one button. We’re the quickest way to change the channel! We know that most of you just want the “new” news and that’s what we deliver.\n\nThen came the first version of Pro with the “Play Mix” where you essentially sort your favorites into your own almost live radio station.\n\nA few years ago, we rebuilt 1 Radio News from scratch and now you can support our ongoing curation efforts and access the search, sleep timer, and Play Mix with subscription or one-time purchase within our free app\n\nAs we gear up for our anniversary, we’ve just completed round one of our global refresh adding new daily news podcasts from more countries. They are sorted under SHOWS following the international dateline in a Pacific and working our way around the world. We added some extra smarts to our podcast feed reader and now we’ve added more than a dozen “shortwave” programs in English from countries as diverse as Zambia, Nepal, Algeria and CubaDig in and discover global perspectives with NEW content Monday-Friday from most shows in the app.\n\nThe rest of the year, we are exploring new featured for our Pro supporters. We decided that unlike our previous version that all the live, hourly, and daily news programming would be FREE (it was always free somewhere) via the app. Now there is so much, you go Pro for search and the Play Mix to make it easy to find your favorites.\n\nAs always, we appreciate your feedback and ideas for the app! Contact us: comments@1radionews.com\n\n1 Radio News is dead. Long live the 1 Radio News.\n\nUPDATE 2: The rebuilt 1 Radio News is now available. Pro features are now being unleashed one by one as well.\n\nUPDATE 1: Good news! We reached our $1000 pledge drive goal to rebuild 1 Radio News.\n\nThank you to our first 40 donors, you made this happen. Your $5 and $20 donations got us to the top. I also want to share an especially heartfelt thanks to James Tedford who donated the last $173 we needed to reach our goal on our deadline date and for his previous early donation of $250. These two donations and an anonymous donation of $150 brought us over half the way. Thank you!\n\nAdditional donations will be used to add NEW mostly Pro-level features – on our list in no promised order are a radio Alarm Clock, Chromecast support, Android Auto version, basic voice commands, etc.\n\nWork on the rebuild will start with replicating the free version of 1 Radio News and all donors will be invited in to help as Beta testers as we unveil and test the more complicated Pro features one by one. “Pro” will become an in-app subscription within the free 1 Radio News.\n\nAs promised, a special Pro subscription for the life of the app will be given to donors of any amount (at least a $40 value). If you want to donate now for that special deal, do it!\n\n…\n\n1 Radio News needs your help.\n\nOur app needs to be rebuilt after seven years of service. The code base can no longer be patch up with gum.\n\nDonate here to save 1 Radio News via GoFundMe.\n\nI promised my family, that 1 Radio News must cover its own costs and essentially not tap my kid’s education funds. 🙂 It has never covered my time, but I love buy soma from trusted pharmacy this app and use it everyday myself.\n\nIt’s good news that we will continue to generate enough revenue to maintain the app.\n\nHowever, we must secure your listener support to completely rebuild the app to make it compatible with the latest versions of Android and add some new features. (Yes, we will fix the stability problems for all you Android 9 users!!)\n\nWe need to raise at least $1000 to pay my new developer. If you help us raise that amount, I’ll put any extra needed on my credit card to get it done.\n\nDonate here to improve 1 Radio News via GoFundMe.\n\nMore good news, we’ve already raised $330 from six donors. Please join them now.\n\nAll donors – at any amount – will get a free life-time of the app subscription to the new 1 Radio News “Pro” level (a $39 value).\n\nGoing forward, our Pro supporter will be invited to support an ever improving app on a monthly or yearly basis if you’d rather not pitch in now. With a regular in-app subscription we will have a way to invest in new features and grow a more up to date directory of today’s freshest news podcasts and live streams. Our app will focus on solid curation and perhaps even add languages based on requests from in-app subscribers.\n\nThe current “pay once” 1 Radio News Pro app will be retired before the end of 2020. If you haven’t gotten your $3 in value, let me know and I will gladly refund you even if you used it every day for seven years.\n\nWhat happens if we don’t raise $1000. The app will shut down. It’s been a great ride world radio fans!!\n\nDonate here to be an awesome 1 Radio News supporter via GoFundMe.\n\nTV News app is the world’s best news video app – Meet our cousin\n\nTV News is a simple free news video player app for Android.\n\nThe free news app gathers live and on-demand video news from across YouTube into an easy to use directory of fresh breaking news from today.\n\nIt includes dozens of live free cable news channels in many languages as well as over 100 sources of high quality trusted mainstream news video channels on-demand in English. (And a few less trusted sources filled with state-funded propaganda, but that’s what diverse global perspectives are all about.)\n\nInstall the news video app today on Google Play.\n\nThe 220+ best radio news streams in/with English\n\n… and spoken word live stations too.\n\nThis is what our highly selective, high quality 1 Radio News Pro directory of live streams has in it. It represents hundreds of hours of scouring the world for the best live streams in English so you can experience the best of the best. We just finished our spring cleaning with lots of updates.\n\nIf you want news, you no longer need to get lost in an app with ten of thousands of stations with broken streams or strange music.\n\nGet the 1 Radio News Pro app today (or try the free app first with the most popular 20+ live streams and a few odd balls for variety thrown in). In addition to live news+ streams, we have over 450 carefully selected hourly, daily, and weekly news radio shows on-demand (aka podcasts) in English. We toss in some entertaining weekend shows from public radio and some of the most popular insightful podcasts around the world as well. We now have radio news in English from over 70 countries.\n\nABC Darwin Australia\n\nABC Extra\n\nABC Sydney 702 Australia\n\nAM New York City WNYC\n\nAP Radio US – Associated Press\n\nAlJazeera
