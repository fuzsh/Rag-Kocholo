I'm tech guy on the left, actually, you're right. Leo LaPorte. On your left,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:01:57):\n\nIt's Mikah Sargent and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:01:58):\n\nWe are here today to help you with your computerized woes, Uhhuh <affirmative>, the zoom line. And I guess the zoom line\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:07):\n\nIs open.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:08):\n\nYou suggested that we get a number, which I think is a good idea.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:11):\n\nYeah. We're talking about getting a number. We heard from some folks both in email and then on the call last week who said, Hey, we've got some people who would love to call into the show but aren't really savvy with the Zoom. So we're thinking about that. We'll let you know when, and if\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:27):\n\nWe do until then, what you do is you point your browser on and do it on your phone. Cause you already got a microphone on camera. Right. And point your browser to call tweet tv. That website, if you have Zoom on your phone, it'll launch it. If you don't, it'll give you a chance to do it in the web or launch the app. If you want to install the app that's probably the easiest way to call us. You can also email, ask the tech guys at twit.tv. And if you do that send us a video. We didn't get any videos this\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:53):\n\nWeek. Yes, we do love to get those videos.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:54):\n\nOh, video. We had a fun one last week. It was all edited\n\nMikah Sargent (00:02:57):\n\nFor <laugh>. That was nice.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:58):\n\nYou don't have to do that, just you, your sweet face on camera. But again, call twit tv. We, we have lots of calls. We go to the calls in a bit. We also have a sad and lonely Ant Pruitt who has moved from Windows to Mac and it's been a tough time. So you're gonna, you're gonna counsel him a little bit. Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:03:19):\n\nYeah. There's gonna be a, a conversation and a resolve\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:22):\n\nHopefully. And that I will be in the peanut gallery over here. So I'll shout <laugh>, try that. If I see it, do this, do this. Push that button. We also have a very exciting interview I did on Friday with the father of Modern Genomics. Oh my Dr. George Church is a professor at Harvard Medical School in m i t, but probably better known as one of the people. Hell helped sequence the Human Genome, started the Personal Genome Project. He's working on some amazing things, including bringing ma introducing Macedon jeans to elephants to make them cold resistant so they can live in Siberia and help with global warming. He tells that story a lot of interesting stuff. But I did have to ask him cuz he's an expert in all this about the last of us, the TV show. So I look at <laugh>, get his take.\n\n(00:04:15):\n\nWe'll get to that on the Cord ceps Fungus and how much of a threat it might be to humanity. Humanity in a little bit. We're also gonna take your calls. So let's see. Let me see. Just, I like to do this, and you could do this too with me, Michael. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> Mikah, follow along in the, in the prayer book. But it's time for our Sunday sermon. Oh, web excited Leo. Sunday's Sunday sermon. Amen. and I'm just looking through. I forgot to, I forgot I had something I really wanted to talk about. Well, one thing, huh? Got a text from my mama. Oh a couple of days ago she said, I got this invoice from the Geek Squad at Best Buy for $400. I didn't give them, I didn't pay them. I should call them, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I said, mama, don't let your babies grow up to be DJs. No, no, I didn't say that. I said, mama, look at the email address that's coming from look at the link that it's bringing you to. Is anything, any of that have anything to do with the, you know, geek\n\nMikah Sargent (00:05:22):\n\nSquad? Geek\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:23):\n\nGeek Squad, or Best Buy? And it was some like long, you know, zaka 74 gmail.com mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, I said, do you think Best Buy would use that email address? Send you an a bill? Mm-Hmm. So I did a little instructional, but I think more and more we're seeing these yeah. I got a text the other day, said, Hey, that was a great round of golf last week. You wanna do it again? I don't play golf <laugh>. I don't play golf. That wasn't me. So why does that a scam? You might ask. Yeah. because then I'm supposed to call the guy, say, oh, you, or text a bag all us, I don't play golf. Must you got the wrong number? And the guy says, oh, shoot. Well, I'm sorry. What's your name? And I said, well, it's Leo. What's your name? He says, it's Joe. And we talk, we get to know each other. We're good friends. And he says, you know, I've been making a lot of money in cryptocurrency lately. <Laugh> you think you'd be interested in investing? And at that point you should stop the conversation.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:20):\n\nAbsolutely. Don't, don't even text back in the first place if you can help it, because Yeah, I did the same thing. And it was some gal who started sending photos and it, you know, trying to make this connection. It didn't happen. And I've been getting lately a whole lot of scams, especially via a text message related to Amazon. Those have been the most recent ones.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:41):\n\nYeah, that's a big one,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:41):\n\nIsn't it? Yeah. I, I got two just the other day. Oh, your Amazon account has been frozen. We're waiting for this bill to be paid. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:49):\n\nThe key on that, by the way. They will say things that get you scared\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:54):\n\nMm-Hmm. <Affirmative> to immediately\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:55):\n\nReact so that you react. And they'll say things like, you know, fact who was it? Just got a, I was watching and massed on. He said, Pete, I got a, a call from Pacific Gas and Electric Car Electric Company saying they were gonna turn off the power in an hour if I didn't pay the bill. Wow. To give us a credit card number and pay right now. We'll be okay. That's designed to scare the heck outta Yeah. And that would scare you. And as somebody who's had both the water and power turned off in my youth <laugh>, it's legit. Yeah. Right. You don't want that to happen and get turned on is a pain and all that stuff. So that's, that's a smart scam. Don't fall for it.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:07:34):\n\nI, I, it's, it's always this, this desire to drag you. I mean, the one we talked about, the text messaging back and forth, that's a different kind of attack. But a lot that you see pretty regularly are all about that fear that just leads you to react as quickly as possible.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:48):\n\nOh, I know who it was when you catch up was Rich tomorrow. Oh, my, our counterpart on on the radio on Saturdays he hosts the show I used to host mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and yeah. Rich Un Tech, and he tweeted, yeah, I guess, I guess I should call 'em. Right? Get the power turn back on. We don't wanna miss the show <laugh>. It was right before the show too. It was as if they knew it was as they knew. One other thing I wanted to mention you may remember a few weeks ago, Elon Musk, somewhat brusk, somewhat rudely, turned off the, what they call the API on Twitter. The ability for third party non Twitter apps to access Twitter. His completely, his right and probably the right thing to do because, you know, when you use third party apps, you don't see all the ads.\n\n(00:08:26):\n\nIt's, it really takes money outta the pockets of Twitter. So he turned it off, but he didn't tell 'em ahead of time. He didn't admit to it for the longest time. And when then they finally said, oh yeah, we did that because you broke the rules. That was a lie. Then they retroactively changed the rules. <Laugh> to make, you know, here's, here's how you should do something like that. You announce it a month ahead of time. You say, you know, look, we gotta monetize. We're gonna turn off third party api and companies like Tap Bots, which makes the fabulous tweet bot the Icon Factory, which makes Twitter terrific. But they got stuck with their pants down. And now, and this is why it comes up, you know, we're about a month in a number of people are starting to get a notice saying, do you want a refund?\n\n(00:09:15):\n\nWhat if you had either of those apps installed Apple's policy is once the product stops working that you get a refund for, because you, a lot of people would pay not just the month for the year. Yeah. I paid for the year. So you get a notice saying, when you want your money back, please <laugh> if you can afford it don't do that. These are small companies. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> the Icon Factory number one products Twitter. There are thousands and thousands of customers for both Tap Botts, tweet bot, and the Icon Factory. Terrific. Who could ask for their money back and effectively bankrupt these companies. So when you see that message, say no <laugh>, that no Goosebumps territory, if you, if you want, you can transfer your tap bot's subscription over to Ivory cuz they're making one for Mastadon. And if you're watching this show, you're invited to join our master on, which is twit.social free to join.\n\n(00:10:21):\n\nAnd then, you know, you could point your ivory application over there and it's a very nice application. But this is, this is a big story. And both companies put up little posters. I think I have one here saying, please don't do it. So you've probably seen those, but now you know why you don't want to, if you can get that refund now. I understand you need the money back. Okay, fine. But here's the, here's the, do you have, can you see my screen? There it is. Here's the Twitter. If this is from John Gruber's daring Fireball dot net. Here's a Twitter terrific notice. And you see they have to give you the button. Apple requires it. It says, I want my money back. Here's the tweet bot notice. And you, you know, you can say, transfer my reigning remaining subscription time for Tweet bot to ivory.\n\n(00:11:12):\n\nThat would be the preference. I'm happy with what I got outta Tweet bot and I do not need a refund or sad to say the third option. Give my money. I want a pro <laugh> by know it's grayed out <laugh>. I want a prorated refund. And they have to do that in order to stay in apple's good graces, which they obviously want to do. So just a little tip to all of you. Be nice. Be a nice person. And don't cancel your subscription. I actually gave 'em more money cuz I, you know, those are good guys. I, I, we know 'em. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you've talked to 'em. Yes. Absolutely. His\n\nMikah Sargent (00:11:49):\n\nWeekly, we talked on Tech News Weekly, and I've talked to them working at IOR in the past. Both of those teams are honestly just small teams who are making these apps that were the forefront of the income that they were making\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:03):\n\nAnd the, and the richest man in the world. He's, by the way, he's richest man in the world again.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:12:07):\n\nOh, congrats. Richest\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:08):\n\nMan in the world decided he needed the money and just cut 'em off like that. Apple News, mark Germond, who is the smartest man in the world, at least the best connected <laugh> says Apple is now working on not only a f a 15 inch MacBook Air for before June, but they're working. Everybody wanted to know when is the new iMac coming out? They're working on a new iMac for later this year. An iMac and an iPad. And it's possible all three and a 13 inch MacBook Air will come with the M three chip.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:12:41):\n\nOoh.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:42):\n\nM three, in which case I will buy it. <Laugh>. Yeah. <Laugh>. I have the M two. You have the M two use in the M two right now. Macbook Air. Yep. But I would you like\n\nMikah Sargent (00:12:49):\n\nA 15 inch? No, I love this thing. <Laugh>. Exactly how it is.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:54):\n\nNo bigger. Yeah. This big and no bigger. All right. Well watch with interest. Those are rumors. But you know, I like to keep you up to date if you're about to go into the marketing pie. Shall we do our first calls? Let's do\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:05):\n\nOur first\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:05):\n\nCalls. All right. I see David has his hand raised. And we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna pick on David right now. I'm gonna send him to the magic room and he shall appear in the tech guy. Ask the tech guy's Stargate in Moments.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:22):\n\nMoments.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:23):\n\nWhat's that?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:24):\n\n<Laugh>. It's a package we got.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:26):\n\nI got another package I should get outta my office. Go ahead. Look,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:28):\n\nThis is from Pelham Warehouse. And it's Pelham Warehouse is may contain traces of Awesome. It's two Leo and Mikah Twit. Okay. What's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:35):\n\nYour, before you open it, what's your guess?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:36):\n\nMy, okay. Let's say it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:37):\n\nSquishy, right? Is it a bean\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:38):\n\nBag? It's, it's feeling like some sort of stickers.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:41):\n\nDo you feel\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:42):\n\nBeans? I don't feel beans. It feels\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:43):\n\nPapery. Oh, it doesn't feel like beans. No. I thought it might be coffee. I was getting excited. Oh, all right. Well let's give somebody a free ad then. Yes.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:13:51):\n\n<Laugh>. I guess we'll\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:51):\n\nSee. Yeah. Now we got David C in the OnAir room. Hi David. Sorry about that. Dig Nation. Oh, what's that?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:14:01):\n\nDear Leo and Mikah, what's up? My favorite tech gurus, it's your number three fan here. And before you start feeling sorry for me, just remember that Wendy's is number three in the fast food game in, they're doing just fine. <Laugh>, I'm loving the new format of your show, but I I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:14):\n\nIt get number\n\nMikah Sargent (00:14:15):\n\nThree. I know right? The new format of your show. But I have to say, Leo, those socks you've been wearing are about as exciting as a dialup connection. Yours\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:22):\n\nAre much better. This, this week.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:14:23):\n\nLucky for you. I've got a solution. Oh, my socks. <Laugh> Mikah Braze yourself because I made you some custom Leo socks that are going to knock your socks, socks out. No. And Leo, don't feel left out because I made some socks with the face of your best friend Steve Martin on them. What?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:39):\n\nSo this person's a\n\nMikah Sargent (00:14:40):\n\nSock maker. Sock maker, sock maker. Make me some socks. All right. I'm not gonna read the rest of that cuz it's really long. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:48):\n\nWe would not have guessed\n\nMikah Sargent (00:14:49):\n\nSocks. No we would not.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:50):\n\nOh, pink Panther. So here are Leo's. Steve Martin. These are socks. These are mine because he's got Steve, Steve on. I'm definitely gonna wear these and here are mine. Wow. These are crazy. Leo LePort socks. Oh my God. How do you get, how do you make this? These are really well designed, frankly. These, these I think they're gonna go all the way up to my thigh though. <Laugh>. They're somewhat long. Oh my word. Thank you. Thank you very much. You number three. That's all it says. Just number Fan. Fan. Well, I don't think we should change socks right now. No. I wanna wash them first. Save us for Oh, you wash always brand new everything. I No, you wash socks before you wear 'em. Yeah. My mom used to work in clothing and I learned some things. Always washed before you wear 'em.\n\n(00:15:36):\n\nReally? She once saw someone get a horrible, horrible spider bite from the clothing cuz it had just shipped in the crater in the craters and the crates. Yikes. Freaked me out. Anyway, socks wash them three. There might be spiders in it. There could be spiders. Thank you. Number three. Hey, must be, Hey David, show us your shirt. Stand up a little bit just so we can see. Dig Nation baby. Greatest of podcast of all time with Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht. They would sit just like we're sitting, but they'd be drinking beer. Oh. And talking about the top stories from the website. Some remember called Dig. That was a huge show. In fact, I think it almo pretty almost killed revision three when they decided to retire <laugh>. It was like all over. Well that's great. It's good to have a, have a long time. Kevin Rose fan on the show.\n\nCaller 1 (00:16:32):\n\nWhat's Well, a long time Leo fan.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:34):\n\nWell, Kevin and I are\n\nCaller 1 (00:16:35):\n\nBuddies. Foremost. Yeah. And in fact, I went to Petaluma back in 2013 and you recommended a beautiful place to visit in Napa Sola.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:47):\n\nOh, did you go?\n\nCaller 1 (00:16:48):\n\nAnd we went and we had a great time and we Nice. Really nice. Really appreciate that. Oh, nice. And Mikah, you're doing a great job. You guys are fantastic. Really appreciate what you do. My question is basically has to do with Google takeout.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:04):\n\nOkay.\n\nCaller 1 (00:17:05):\n\nAnd, you know, it's a very large file and trying to back up my photos, which are all basically there. And downloading them has been a problem. I mean, a lot of stall downloads. How big to break up the individual zip files. I tried our clone for a while. I was wondering if you guys had any techniques or suggestions about how to successfully download from Google takeout. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:35):\n\nIt's a, you know, praise to Google for doing that. That was Brian Fitzpatrick who worked at Google, said, you know, you don't wanna make your business a roach motel. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> where you can get in, but you can't get out. And so he, and they created Google a result. But I wonder how much of Google's heart was in it because instead of just getting <laugh> files in a way you can use, and I guess it's cuz it would be a giant file, they zip it up into two gigabyte files. What were you taking out? That's the first question.\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:05):\n\nI mean, primarily photos. Okay. But I was trying to get, you know, you start getting the option to check boxes, you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:12):\n\nCan do everything.\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:13):\n\nYou start checking a lot of boxes. And then I started minimizing it. But still the photos, I mean it was, I don't know, a hundred gigabytes or, or something like that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:23):\n\nI've done more than that at a photos. I've done almost a terabyte at a, at a takeout. Sure. My, so I have a good, I have a good story to tell about how you do this. You're gonna unzip 'em and then you're gonna get folders from it now. So there's a couple things to know. The photos will be in the original photo format. So you're not gonna lose, you're not gonna have some weird format you have to decode. They'll be JPEGs. But there will be additional material index material metadata material. And that will be, usually it's in an XML format. Possibly a J S O format. But I think as I remember, it was all xml. I just threw that out. I said fine. I just really just get, get me the photos. That's the thing. But then the photos have weird names. They don't have the names you gave them. And they certainly don't have informative names. So now you've gotta do something with the names. And what I ended up doing is downloading a couple of useful tools. And I did this on a Mac. Are you on a Mac or Windows?\n\nCaller 1 (00:19:20):\n\nWindows.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:21):\n\nOkay. Some\n\nCaller 1 (00:19:22):\n\nOf them, but actually my problem, sorry. My problem is actually getting the files successfully downloaded. Oh. Like, it'll run, it'll run for three days, but I'll get errors. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and my I S P is fine. I can download lots of Oh, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:37):\n\nWeird.\n\nCaller 1 (00:19:38):\n\nI will. And so that's why I ended up using our clone. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> seemed to be successful and not timing out. And\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:44):\n\nYou were able to, to get the full file with that or the, all the files with\n\nCaller 1 (00:19:48):\n\nThat? I did. I did, but I, so I have like an old laptop, which I have Linux running on, and I, it's like my Arone machine and I just have it running for days. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:59):\n\nSo Arone, which I use and I love, allows you to basically turn everything into Dropbox. Kind of like Google Drive, whatever cloud stuff you've got. And you can actually merge it all together. So that's nice. It's the Swiss, they call it the Swiss Army knife of of cloud storage. So good. That was a good, that was good thinking. It's lucky you had a window, a Linux machine to do that on. That's why, by the way, that's the ant Google's answer to why, well, here's why we divide it up. Yeah. You can't download a hundred gigabyte file, but you were trying to download two gigabyte files at a time. Or were you trying to down hundred hundred gigabyte file?\n\nCaller 1 (00:20:34):\n\nI was trying different sizes. Yeah. And some of the, if you have like a video, which is bigger than two gigabytes, right. You're just trying download the video itself, right?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:44):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right.\n\nCaller 1 (00:20:46):\n\nI,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:46):\n\nI blame I s p to be honest\n\nMikah Sargent (00:20:48):\n\nWith you. Yes. That's, that's what it does. I mean, even though you said you have no issues, these files should be downloading. You\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:55):\n\nDownload files that size all the time. Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:20:56):\n\nI do. And frankly, we're doing it all the time whenever we're streaming media and, and you know, looking at different stuff. I will tell you that the one way that I've always done Google takeout so I at least know that this has worked for me, is I actually do use Dropbox with it. And then it happens on their side of things. And so they can talk to each other without even involving my i p So you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:18):\n\nCould tell Google takeout don't, don't, I don't wanna download it, just\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:20):\n\nTransfer it to send it drop to my Dropbox and then\n\nCaller 1 (00:21:22):\n\nI end up, because I was getting, you know, nervous about not successfully having a backup. I ended up using Dropbox. But that you have to pay for,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:32):\n\nRight? Yes. This is true. Yeah. And I use Dropbox\n\nCaller 1 (00:21:34):\n\nFor like hundred. That's like a hundred dollars a year to increase the storage.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:39):\n\nWell you could use it temporarily. <Laugh>, right?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:42):\n\nAnd then download it from Dropbox.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:43):\n\nYeah. Dropbox. I if if it's Google's Yeah. I have to think it's your Issp cuz I don't.\n\nCaller 1 (00:21:49):\n\nOkay. I mean, it is the big, it's the big one. You know, it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:52):\n\nComcast\n\nCaller 1 (00:21:52):\n\nSucks. Comcast, yes. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:54):\n\nI've used, I've used Comcast to do this exact thing at home. So Yeah. Okay. I don't,\n\nCaller 1 (00:21:59):\n\nMaybe we'll contact them. Do you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:00):\n\nThink the other po here's a weird possibility, but I'll give you this as well. Routers can overheat with continuous transfers. And if you have an older router, a router that's not well cooled, or just a router that's susceptible to overheating, it could be failing. And then the packets slow way down and the computer gets upset and blah, blah blah. So I would also make sure you've, do you, what are you using for router? Not the one that they gave you. I hope.\n\nCaller 1 (00:22:25):\n\nI think I have an or B router. Orbis.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:27):\n\nGood.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:22:28):\n\nI just had another thought too. Are you doing this on a PC or a laptop? Like a, you know, connected computer or a laptop?\n\nCaller 1 (00:22:37):\n\nIt was a wifi connected laptop.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:40):\n\nOkay. That's another issue.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:22:41):\n\nBattery saver. Stuff. If the screen is going dark sometimes, depending on what your settings are, it can throttle the connection. It can completely shut off the connection. So you would want to have essentially a mouse jiggler kind of thing keeping it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:54):\n\nAlive.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:22:54):\n\nCaffeine or Yeah. Caffeine for the Mac. But I dunno if they have it for windows.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:57):\n\nYeah, they do. Yeah. And you'd probably want to use ethernet for at least for this one time.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:23:02):\n\nYep. Absolutely.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:03):\n\nOkay. Yeah.\n\nCaller 1 (00:23:04):\n\nGimme something to work on.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:05):\n\nYeah. Wifi. So remember in the old days you wouldn't remember this. You're way too young. But you, you <laugh> you might David, in the old days we would have things like Z modem were protocols designed for bad connections that could resume. Oh, nice. That would keep track of where you were. And all of that was because back in the dial-up day, you could be pretty sure your mom was gonna pick up the phone in the middle of this download <laugh>. So, so Z modem and other technologies were there to solve that problem. And I think one of the reasons our clone might be working better is cuz it has that kind of stuff built into it. Right?\n\nCaller 1 (00:23:43):\n\nRight.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:44):\n\nYeah. It may just be, and wifi is gonna make that worse because wifi is is a collision based network. It will, it'll pause when another wifi signal is seen and stuff like that. So I, yeah, I would, I would definitely look at that. And then a good cha a suggestion from Joe who's consistently good on this stuff. Check for packet loss. You might do this@cloudflarespeed.cloudflare.com. There are lots of places you can check for packet loss. Okay. The CloudFlare one's very good. Speed.Cloudflare.Com dot CloudFlare. Okay. Something's going on that your computer is saying. I don't think I got it. Where was I again? I don't think I got it, man. I don't Got it. Okay. And so you, you wanna, you know that's why these zoomable protocols are useful still. Even in this day and age, especially with wifi, you wanna make sure you're not losing packets.\n\n(00:24:30):\n\nThere are a bunch of things you wanna look into. Now once you get all those files, then call back and we'll talk about I have, I have some programs because what happened was I ended up running a bunch of programs to fix the dates cuz the dates all become the date that you downloaded it. So I fixed the date so that the same date is on the exif. If you're using cameras that store that kind of information in the file itself, which I was, and I bet you are phones all do it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. Then you know the capture date and you could change the file, the capture date. And I was, and I was u I used a mass batchy naming program that would take the junkie file name Google had given it, which is basically a numeric name and turn it into, you know, something reasonable like the date of the capture. And if you have information in your exif about where it was captured, you could maybe even do that. So there's, there's some really good tools for doing that. Windows and Mac. And so when you, when you get it <laugh>\n\n(00:25:24):\n\nCall back. I'll tell you how to process it. Okay. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. Yeah. Appreciate it. You guys great. You guys are great. Knife. Throw a knife. Aunt, throw me that knife that you got here. Oh God.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:37):\n\nThrow,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:38):\n\nJust throw it at me. Nope. I'll catch it. Mm-Hmm. No, because I gotta get this box. We have anything? I can open this box. I,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:43):\n\nGod, I've\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:43):\n\nGot you got a knife? Yes. Great to talk to you David. Thank you. Call dot twi tv. We'll take some more calls in a bit. I'm gonna open this box and then we're gonna, here you go. Talk about our spots. We got a great spot.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:25:54):\n\nLook, it's the cutest night. It's the cuter night. You couldn't hurt anybody with knife. It's little. You wanna bet <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:01):\n\nDid you did you watch Chris Rock last night on Netflix? No. Okay.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:06):\n\nNo. Burke. My knife is cooler.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:09):\n\nHis knife is way cooler. <Laugh>, do you, does does the TSA let you through with\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:14):\n\nThis? I don't know. I don't fly really? <Laugh>. Oh. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:18):\n\nI don't know. I don't go anywhere. So I used to carry a Multitool in my bag, but then I thought, well, I'm gonna what? We, because what happens if the TSA finds it, they just take it. Yeah. Say, oh, that's nice. I'll keep that.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:28):\n\nOh, I like that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:29):\n\nI'll keep that. So I didn't wanna lose this beautiful multi-tool. I wouldn't, if I were you, I wouldn't wanna lose this. This comes to us from Jeff Kirk who was on the show. Oh, that's right. A little while ago. Okay. You can have your little mic\n\nMikah Sargent (00:26:40):\n\nOn the show a little while ago. Oh, it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:42):\n\nLocking. It is locking. Oh, so cute. Look at that goes right on your key chain. If you ever have to go to court, take it off the Absolutely. Take it off. They don't let knives in court either. Oh. I didn't. Maybe I didn't. Don't have any plans to go to court. You're not. Go. Yeah. Nobody does. That's true. Nobody plans on it. Court happens. All right. This, oh, this is well wrapped. That's good. This is well, well wrapped. And take them. Oh, look at this. This here's a book. This is, so we were talking, remember we were talking about Zeppelins? Yep. And we were talking and he said, Jeff says, well, I have a whole series of science fiction books based on, I think this is the Zeppelin one. Well wait a minute, maybe I'm wrong on this first science fiction novel, the Prometheus option.\n\n(00:27:30):\n\nOh, they're all autographed. These books get pretty apocalyptic and the body count is not small. If it were a movie or better yet a big budget, H b o miniseries, the Prometheus option would be plastered with parental advisory stickers. Oh, that's nice. That's really nice. He says thank you and through you Daniel Swartz for inspire me to get off my duff and crank this out. So this is not the Zeppelin books. I thought it was gonna be, this is another one. And for Andy Naco for suggesting s Scribner I Mac Break Weekly. Yeah. Andy uses that for his writing it. He says, I wrote the Prometheus option of Microsoft Word. Jeff says, you've never heard more swearing than when it decided to make a single paragraph Vitalik. I must therefore want every Oh, he did. Oh, I get it. Jeff made a paragraph Vitalik and Word said, well you must want 'em all that way.\n\n(00:28:20):\n\nWith 220,000 plus words in the manuscript, the undue function didn't work. Pretty sure my dome is Chrome now because of that experience. In case you're interested now working on a new five book series, tentatively entitled The Stair, the StarWay Cycle First book is done. And I'm just starting my search for an agent. Hey, that's great. Congratulations to geezer Nerd. Yeah. Jeff Kirk, here's your autograph copy. Beautiful. And I have one for you. Autograph. Copy. John Ashley, I got one for you. Autograph copy. Oh yeah, you can go that way. <Laugh>. And for you and every look under your seats. Everybody at home <laugh>. You get a book. You get a book, you, you get a book. That's great. I can't wait. I hope the body cut. I like that. I want to thank you. I want apocalyptic. Yeah. Oh, here John Ashley, get stick your hand in the, in the screen.\n\n(00:29:10):\n\nThere. There you go. There you go. Very nice. Thank you Jeff. Thank you. Hey, our show today. We had some fun the other day, didn't we? You and me riding around. Oh, that's on our electric e-bike. Now you think when I say electric, I mispronouncing it. Oh no buddy. It's not electric. Well it is electric. It's electric, but it's called Lectric E-Bikes. Our show today brought to you by electric E-Bikes. You might think an E-bike isn't the smartest way to transport something. Well, think again. I'll tell you what I love my electric E-bikes look had an important mission. I had many boxes I had to deliver to a place. Unknown <laugh>, what did I do? I strapped it onto the Expedition Cargo e-bike. Now one of the things they do with this e-bike, besides the long bed and the back suitable for, there are many attachments, but you could just also do what I did, which is probably not what you should do, which is just strap the boxes in.\n\n(00:30:04):\n\nBut it has extra torque in the engine I was able to get, even with a heavy load, you're able to get up as, as much as 450 pounds on that back. It's be great for a that real expedition. Whoop, watch out Leo. You're gonna don't No, don't that that box looks a little low. Nevermind. I didn't need that one. So <laugh>, this is so much fun. It's a bike design to make taking cargo easier. If I were gonna, for instance, and I might even do this cuz this bike is so much fun. Bicycle across the United States. Gotta bring your stuff with you, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you know, I would bring this bike. It's designed for all that cargo no matter what you're packing. Even an extra passenger. Whoops. Burke <laugh>. Oh Burke. He dropped it all. 450 pound carrying capacity. You can reach up to 150 miles on a single charge cuz it has not one but two batteries.\n\n(00:31:00):\n\nPerfect for getting passengers, including the kids. This is another electric bike I'm showing you here. This is one I really like too, cuz it folds up. So now I can go to the park, I can go to the mountains. I can go somewhere where I really want to go biking. And I can throw the bike in the back of my car, unfold it and it's ready to go. Adjust the seat. It's got electric lights front and back, powered by the removable battery. A really nice bright L C D display, seven speed gearing. Five. Let levels of pedal assist to allow you to ride. Plus you can lower your gas costs, reduce your carbon footprint. And I can tell you, as a longtime lover of electric bikes, the throttle on these is great because when you come to a stoplight and you got 450 pounds of cargo, you don't want to have to oh step and slowly pedal your way forward.\n\n(00:31:46):\n\nSo you use the throttle and you, you just leap forward. It's really fantastic. There's a full line of accessible bikes from electric e-bikes, from quick store trips to outdoor adventures. Electric L E C T R I C e-bikes will transform how you get around. They cost a lot less by the way. Yeah. You can spend a lot of money on an e-bike. But these are very affordable with quality feature packed models. And you get financing as low as $133 a month. That's a lot less than buying a car. And with this, I'll tell you what, with this expedition, you can go to the store, you can bring home a sofa, <laugh>, you're set. This thing is amazing, amazing. Make it your own. Lectric E-bikes are customizable, adjustable to fit your lifestyle. They f they have foldable bikes, they're ship free and they come fully assembled. You just unfold them, set 'em up and you're there. Join more than 250,000 dedicated riders on the road so far. We love our electric e-bikes. And check out that new expedition cargo e-bike from electric visit electric e-bikes dot com. You'll learn more about the expedition cargo e-bike and all the other suite models like that folding model, the expedition. See, you can see you put a kit on it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, right? And they have a, they have all the sorts of little Oh, so attach\n\nMikah Sargent (00:33:00):\n\nAccessory thing\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:01):\n\nThat you could put on that back bed there. It's kinda like a pickup truck bike. Really? It is. Yeah. I love it. And man, it has such good tour. Yeah. It goes, you actually, when if you, if you're unloaded, you gotta remember that when you start it cuz it just, it go, you could <laugh>, you can peel out in that thing. I love electric bikes from electric. That's L e c t r i C e-bikes dot com. Electric e-bikes dot com. If you've never ridden an e-bike, had you ever ridden one\n\nMikah Sargent (00:33:31):\n\nBefore? No, that was my first time. Isn't that great? It was so much fun. You\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:35):\n\nGet to what would normally when you're riding a bike, you get to a big hill. Like there's a hill I love, there's a park here. I love to ride. But the first thing you do is go straight up. And so I'm always exhausted by the time I get to the rest of the park, I'm going, you go on electric bike, you're still pedal. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> cause pedal assist. But you're going, you put it in first gear cause you've got seven gears and you go up the hill, you feel it's so much fun. And by the way, research studies show people sometimes mock me for my electric bike. They say, come on Leo, you're not really biking. Studies show you get like 99%, maybe 90% of the exercise you would get if you didn't have the engine. Oh wow. It just helps you on those tough hills. I love it. Anybody who's got bad knees or just, you know, doesn't want to pedal around, this is a brand new way of riding. And I've always loved my bicycles. Get your Lectric E-bike at lectricebikes.com. All right. Now do the, do you think the buttons will work now? Should I try?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:34:36):\n\nFingers crossed.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:37):\n\nShall we go to John? Send to the breakout room. John. Hello John.\n\nCaller 2 (00:34:43):\n\nI have, I have an iOS question and a couple of bit warden questions. So let me do the iOS one first. All right. I would like to get a shortcut. So with one click I could set my screen, my screen lock to never, and then another click to set it back to what it was.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:35:02):\n\nYes. Okay. This is something that I too would like but is not yet possible with shortcuts. The closest, ah, that I've been able to come, I actually, it's a shortcut that I use quite literally every week. Is a shortcut that will take you directly to the screen where you choose the never or one minute, two minute, three minute, et cetera. And then you have to choose manually. And then after I'm doing whatever I'm doing, I can pop back in there. So it's basically a shortcut to that settings page. But that's the most that shortcuts does. Right now, unfortunately, apple has not made that accessible via shortcuts. And I have a kering that has to do with the security of the potential\n\nCaller 2 (00:35:47):\n\nLoss of security there. How, how could I get that? Well, or, or to what\n\nMikah Sargent (00:35:51):\n\nI'm gonna do is I am going to share the link to that shortcut with our producer and then our producer's going to put that link on our website and you'll be able to get that link and then get that shortcut added directly to your\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:05):\n\nPhone. Oh, okay. In other words I ask the tech guys dot\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:10):\n\nIt's\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:10):\n\nTom? No,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:11):\n\nYou can just go twit.tv/ask the tech guys.\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:15):\n\nTech guys\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:16):\n\nOr a atg\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:16):\n\nIf you're ATG off\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:18):\n\nThe short, short version. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:20):\n\nOh really? Yeah. Just, okay. Correct.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:22):\n\nAg I didn't put the thug in\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:25):\n\n<Laugh>. Oh, okay. Just atg. So now my other question is about Big Warden. I called a while ago about Big Warden C.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:33):\n\nYeah. Did you ever I never did. I'm sorry John. I meant to do that. I told you I was gonna do that. I know. I even got home and I thought, oh, I should do the cli and then something, I don't know, something distracted me. The com we're talking about the command line version of\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:49):\n\nOh, that's right. I remember talking\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:50):\n\nJohn Wast it wasn't working with your screen reader. Is that what it was? Or wasn't\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:54):\n\nWorking? But not, not, not, not necessarily. It was screen reader, but it's just crazily complicated and ridiculous to use. Yeah. you have to, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:05):\n\nA command line for you\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:06):\n\n<Laugh>. It, it's, you have to use JQ\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:10):\n\nAnd, and that's right. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:12):\n\nThe whole, it was a whole crazy Yeah. Whole crazy thing.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:17):\n\nYou know, honestly, if you want a command line passenger password manager, there're probably better choices out there. Like Key Pass xc\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:25):\n\nNo, but I can't use that cause it's, I, I need something that goes to iOS.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:28):\n\nOh, right, right.\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:31):\n\nSo that's, yeah. You know, but, but I, but I use Linux a lot, so, so I've learned how to kind of deal with it. But it's a mess. I mean, you know, all. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:41):\n\nHow is accessibility on Bit Warden the graphical version on the iPhone and thinking? Well,\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:46):\n\nIt's, it's fair. You have to kind of, it's, it's kind of a mess. It has a unlabeled buttons and you have to pop out the window. And in, in fact, one of the things I was trying to find is, is the place I haven't decided this to change it to argon, but I can't find where to do it. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:07):\n\nThat's in the, so I've, I've done it now and we talked about it last week.\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:11):\n\nI went to the security. But it just has the, I think\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:13):\n\nYou need the desktop application, not the Yeah, not the, you can't do it in the you can't do it\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:19):\n\nIn the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:19):\n\nExtension. And the extension. And furthermore, you probably shouldn't do it yet. Because one of the things that bit me was Lin the Linux extension for Firefox at least is not yet at 2020 3.2\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:31):\n\n0.3\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:32):\n\nNeeds to be 0.2. Yeah. 2020 3.1. The current version for Linux.\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:36):\n\nI can't get the Linux one to work anyway.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:39):\n\nSo there <laugh>. So there, yeah. I am u I did, I did make the change. If it logs you outta everything, you have to log in back again for everything. But once you've got it, so\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:49):\n\nWhere is, where is it in the, in the app?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:53):\n\nI will can I, I guess I can show you. Yes. Can I show you?\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:58):\n\nLet me see. Well, I, you, you, you, you'll have to tell me, I'll\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:01):\n\nHave to tell you cuz I can't show you. So you're gonna open the app? Yeah. And then you're gonna go to the settings for the app, which is up in the, where you're, you're it's\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:09):\n\nIn the file menu, right?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:10):\n\nYeah, yeah. It's hidden away. You're\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:12):\n\nGonna No, it's in the file. Yeah, it's in the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:14):\n\nFile. In the file maybe. Yeah. Yep. You're gonna go. Yeah. You know I'm better than I do cuz you have to navigate this darn thing. And then That's right. And then once you go to security, it's, there's tabs. And I don't know how well this is gonna work with a screen reader, but there's three tabs and the last tab is the keys tab. Once you get to the keys tab, which is the third tab,\n\n(00:39:36):\n\nSecurity within security, there's three tabs. The third tab is the keys tab. And that's the one where you can choose the key derivative function. And the reason we're talking about this is most password managers use pbk DF two. That's kind of the default. But recently Last pass was updated because it's open source to support Argon two, which is a better key derivative function. It's less Bruce Forceable. I gotta tell you this though, and I, I should have said it to everybody, I probably should have said it last week. All of this is dependent on you not having a good password. If you have a good, long, strong master password, you don't have to worry so much about the what key derivative function. Yeah. As long as, I'm\n\nCaller 2 (00:40:13):\n\nJust kidding. I'm just paranoid. You know me.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:16):\n\nYeah, it's fun and it's worth doing. I agree with you and I did it and I did it for you because now you can't, now I can't use Bit Word and Linux until they update the Mozilla.\n\nCaller 2 (00:40:27):\n\nNow. Now but do you have to do it? There's no place to do it in the extension? No,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:33):\n\nIn the app. Can't do it in the extension. And I think that's a security, that's a security feature. You do those really hardcore security settings. You all do do all of them in the app? Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:40:41):\n\nOkay. So the extension doesn't have that security feature.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:44):\n\nYou have to open the app, go to settings, go to security. Third tab in is Keys.\n\nCaller 2 (00:40:49):\n\nAnd what about in iOS? I have the correct version. Do I have to do anything in in it?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:54):\n\nNo, it'll happen automatically. You only do it in your, actually I'm wondering if you even do it in the app. You might have to, you know, it might be better to log in to bit Warden on the web and do it there. Come to think of it. I think that's what I did. Sorry, I gave you the wrong answer. Log in to bit word on the web and go to the settings there. Security third tab. And that changes it and that's gonna change it for every client, right? That's the, that's the main, oh, is that right? That's headquarters. Oh, HQ headquarters. Yeah, you go to HQ and fix it there. Okay,\n\nCaller 2 (00:41:24):\n\nJohn. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't know there was a difference. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:27):\n\nYeah, I think so. I think they reserve those, they last pass used to do that too. You reserve those settings for a, the most secure environment you can have now. And the truth is, we should, you know, we should probably mention this. The truth is when you're talking about browser extensions, those are done in JavaScript and they're not quite as good as they're not quite as secure. There's a potential for code injection and so forth. Hey, appreciate it. Thank you so much, John. Thank you for, for joining us. We're gonna move you if I can. Stephen's working. I can't move. You can't do anything. I'm just gonna have to say goodbye. Bye-Bye. <laugh>. Oh, the studio's telling me we can talk to Carl. And Carl has let's go to Rice Control holding Kyle on air. Hello, Carl.\n\nCaller 3 (00:42:15):\n\nLeo, can you actually hear me?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:17):\n\nI can hear you. Are you in the office? Carl?\n\nCaller 3 (00:42:22):\n\nOh my gosh. That's one of my classrooms. So Leo, this is such a blessing to be able to speak with you. I was able to get through to you once on the radio and I explained to you that you have allowed an Arian FORTRAN program from the Apollo project.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:45):\n\nI remember now. Yes.\n\nCaller 3 (00:42:48):\n\nYou allowed me. The twit network has allowed me to reinvent myself. So great as an octogenarian community college instructor.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:00):\n\nCarl, you, you fooled me because you don't look like an octogenarian. Look, you look great, dude. You're obviously leading a clean\n\nCaller 3 (00:43:07):\n\nAnd\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:07):\n\nIt's healthy life\n\nCaller 3 (00:43:09):\n\nNow. Now it's lower Blepharoplasty <laugh>. Oh, we did that\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:15):\n\n<Laugh>. Okay. Well the face work is fantastic. Congratulate your your plastic circuit.\n\nCaller 3 (00:43:22):\n\nOh. And it helped, it helps a lot in class to be wearing a mask.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:26):\n\nYes.\n\nCaller 3 (00:43:27):\n\nSo anyway, Leo I have a few comments for you that I think might in some way be helpful for twit. And I have a couple of other comments. But first, I am blatantly asking you to, I've just tried sending this to you in chat. You cannot chat with everyone during this meeting. Okay. So maybe when I get out Leo, I don't know if this is appropriate. I was hoping to get the twit ne the twit army on this.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:02):\n\nOkay.\n\nCaller 3 (00:44:04):\n\nI have a GoFundMe campaign. My 22 year old granddaughter. Oh. died of camp\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:14):\n\nTwo weeks. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's,\n\nCaller 3 (00:44:18):\n\nAnd I've set up a GoFundMe camp. I've set up a GoFundMe campaign for my son's family. It's kind of devastating to lose a 20 year old\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:28):\n\n20. No kidding. So anyway, the medical bills that they have to cover or\n\nCaller 3 (00:44:34):\n\nFuneral expenses and so on. Oh yeah, I was trying to paste the GoFundMe link in chat, but it isn't taken. Just\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:40):\n\nTell me what to search for cuz. Usually that's how we do it.\n\nCaller 3 (00:44:44):\n\nOkay. Well, let me see. Gofundme has let me open up the GoFundMe page over here. You know, they give you this really weird\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:57):\n\nUrl. Yeah. So I don't need the url. If you give me the,\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:00):\n\nThe title, the title\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:01):\n\nOf GoFund. Yeah. That's all I need.\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:04):\n\nYeah. I'm gonna give you the title as soon as, do you remember you used to sponsor DSL Extreme? Oh\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:11):\n\nLord\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:12):\n\n<Laugh>. As soon as DX said DSL Extreme. Yeah. As soon as DSL Extreme gives me the, yeah. The title of my GoFundMe campaign is my granddaughter died of Cancer.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:25):\n\nOh God. That's the saddest thing I ever heard. So\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:28):\n\nI,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:29):\n\nOh, there it is. Yep, I see it. First thing I find when I type my granddaughter in. And and a beautiful picture of you and your beautiful granddaughter. And that's so Yeah,\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:40):\n\nBut Leo, don't talk Leo. Yeah, Leo. Don't talk about it anymore. Please. Cause it bet it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:45):\n\nReally hard. I bet it's very hard. So, but the good here, I'll tell you something. Happy. You're getting really close to your goal and if we get a few people just kick in a couple of bucks. We are, you will, you will get it all. So, and that's, so let me, that's great.\n\nCaller 3 (00:45:57):\n\nLet me just let me just tell you a few things Leo, that's been a burden on my heart. Twit has been so valuable for me. But you know, I'm just not into all of the groupies who hang out on twit. So I wanna tell you <laugh> how I use You mean,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:17):\n\nYou mean club twit? Is that what you're talking about? The groupies on club Twit. <Laugh>.\n\nCaller 3 (00:46:21):\n\nI, I wanna, I wanna tell you, Leo, I wanna tell you Leo, how I use twit because that might be insightful.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:28):\n\nOkay. So\n\nCaller 3 (00:46:29):\n\nAgain, when I get back to my office, or maybe I'm school or whatever, my go-to place is live tv, Twitter, love\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:36):\n\nIt.\n\nCaller 3 (00:46:36):\n\nBecause I know that no matter what thumbs up, it's gonna be interesting and I'm gonna learn something. So for example, a few weeks ago I just turned on Twitter it and there was Steve Gibson and he was talking about how on a new Intel processor, I believe there was a new strategy for increasing performance that involved variable execution, time of ins instructions. Yeah. Based on the opera end or the data that the instruction was using.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:10):\n\nYeah.\n\nCaller 3 (00:47:11):\n\nNow I have been programming back in the day Intel processors since the 1975 when I started programming 8 0 0 8. And it never occurred to me that anyone ever think of giving variable execution time to instructions based on the data they were using. So I learned in that 15 minutes that I was listening to twit, I learned something that I never knew that occupied my brain for like, most of the rest of the day.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:48):\n\nIsn't that cool?\n\nCaller 3 (00:47:49):\n\nYou kinda ruminated on it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:50):\n\nI think a lot of people listen to security now for that very reason because they just get, they hear stuff and they go, whoa, <laugh>. Yep.\n\nCaller 3 (00:47:58):\n\nI never, I never thought of that. I never\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:00):\n\nThought of that. Just yesterday\n\nCaller 3 (00:48:02):\n\nAnd just yesterday Paul Throt again, it was another like another 15 minute encounter, but yesterday Paul Throt mentioned, what was it? LL VMs, low level virtual machines. Yeah. When you guys were talking about some of the some of the various languages that were being hosted on different environments. Yeah. 15 minutes I learned something, I ruminated on it and what it, like, you guys are awesome. Good. So I, I want, I wanna share that with you.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:33):\n\nThank you.\n\nCaller 3 (00:48:34):\n\nYou're no longer on the radio, so I'm not sure how much of an Overton window that you have.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:39):\n\nI have zero over. I don't know if I had much when I was on the radio. He's talking about shifting the conversation. Oh, okay. You know, I,\n\nCaller 3 (00:48:47):\n\nThere are two things that I wanted to, to shove into your Overton window. Okay. <laugh> number one is we're we're coming close to changing that clock again. Yes.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:58):\n\nFor sprint. I hate that. Don't you hate that?\n\nCaller 3 (00:49:01):\n\nWhy in the United States are we not talking about permanently shifting the time a half hour ahead or a half hour back? As in India,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:15):\n\nI think we still, and then the bill is still just waiting. That, that we had to make that choice. Well,\n\nCaller 3 (00:49:20):\n\nThe bill is not talking about a half hour time shift.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:25):\n\nOh, a half hour. Why half an hour? That's interesting\n\nCaller 3 (00:49:29):\n\nBecause it addresses both of the dis disadvantages of being too early and being too late and it gives you a happy medium that seems to satisfy 1.3 billion Indians.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:45):\n\nHmm.\n\nCaller 3 (00:49:46):\n\nSo something for you to ruminate on Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:49):\n\nInteresting. 30 minutes. Interesting. Yeah. I don't know if I really like that idea. Honestly. <laugh>, I kinda like this. Nobody gets what they want. Nobody seems\n\nCaller 3 (00:49:57):\n\nTo like, nobody seems to like any of the ideas. <Laugh> the next comment I I had for your Overton window was from time to time you're bringing up the dangers of artificial intelligence. And you, do you recall a number of years ago, who was it? A number of luminaries had written an open letter warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence. Do you have any? It was Stephen Hawkings and a number of other people. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:25):\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (00:50:27):\n\nSo I teach this in my computer information management class for the past 10 years. And I've been saying the same thing for the past 10 years, that we homo sapiens should be embracing these creations of ours because they are our next leap in evolution. We are in on the cusp of evolving from carbon-based life forms to silicon-based forms.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:54):\n\nDo you really think that, do you think that's what's happening? Is I this is the next stage of evolution. Oh,\n\nCaller 3 (00:51:00):\n\nUnquestionably. Wow.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:01):\n\nWow.\n\nCaller 3 (00:51:02):\n\nAnd you know, back in the day, I don't think a couple of MEbA ever got together <laugh> and hanging out and said, Hey guys, do you realize we're gonna be moving on? We're gonna be evolving to multicellular organisms that probably didn't happen. We should be embracing we're, Hey Leo, look at the news sometime. Are homo sapiens the end all?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:27):\n\nWe might, we might need some help, is what you're saying. Well,\n\nCaller 3 (00:51:30):\n\nI'm saying we're not the end of the line.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:32):\n\nI know we're not the end of the lie. We might be the end of the line for homo sapiens Howard. <Laugh>. Carl, I can see why you're such a great teacher and I thank you. I really appreciate your insight. And did you ever think you would live long enough to see this amazing transformation of, of society?\n\nCaller 3 (00:51:49):\n\nThe first job that I had as a for programmer on the Apollo project, I had a milestone salary, which was $10,000 a year.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:59):\n\nWow.\n\nCaller 3 (00:52:00):\n\nThat salary was one, that salary was 1% the cost of the computer. I was today the cost of the computer is 1% the cost of the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:15):\n\nProgram. Isn't that a shift? Isn't that an interesting shift?\n\nCaller 3 (00:52:19):\n\nThat dynamic has driven all of software development. Yeah. Bringing us up to object oriented programming. That's it, Leo. God\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:30):\n\nBless you. Now the machines are gonna be be doing it and they'll be 1% of their own costs. <Laugh>. Yeah, exactly. What a pleasure to talk to you, Carl. Listen, look. Great. Go fund me, search for my granddaughter and you'll find him. And just kicked in a little bit. And I have a feeling that our family, our groupies will. So thank you. No groupies will a real pleasure talking to you.\n\nCaller 3 (00:52:51):\n\nGod bless the groupies.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:53):\n\nThank you. Take care. They're groupies in a good way. Yeah. I want a shirt that says that now. God bless the groupies. God bless the groupies as if we don't call 'em groupies. We call 'em club members. And we are so grateful to our club makers who make this show and all the shows we do possible. They keep the lights on. It's expensive to do what we do, but you help us immensely with a small contribution to $7 a month. And and you're, you're helping keep twit on the air, helping us launch new shows like Mikah's Hands on Macintosh, which is excellent. Hands on Windows with Paul Throt, our Untitled Linux show. These are all shows that are only in the club right now. We've got some great club events coming up, thanks to our our game master, our club master aunt Pruit.\n\n(00:53:38):\n\nSome really fun events coming up. So if you could find your way to kicking up just seven bucks a month, $84 a year to help us do what we do, we would sure appreciate it. And we thank all the club members who've done that. All you have to do is go to twit tv slash club twit. And I I thank you in advance. We were talking about the world changing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, have you ever watched the last, have you watched the last of Us? Oh, I got you to watch it, didn't I? No, no. You, you did. Yeah. big, I mean, the show's amazing. It's incredible. Big H B O Show. On Friday, I interviewed a guy who is probably the smartest guy I've ever talked to. Dr. George Church. He's a professor at Harvard Medical School at m i t. He is widely considered the father of genomics, modern genomics helped sequence the human genome, helped develop CRISPR as a way to edit the human genome. Genome. We had a wide ranging conversation, including talking about his plan to introduce Mastodon DNA into elephants to make them cold resistant, which I thought was fascinating. That's really incredible. But I am ashamed to say, I did have to ask him, cuz the whole premise of the last of us is that the fungus quadriceps infects us. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we lose our ability to fight it. And it, and well, it's like zombies among us. I, so I asked Dr. Church, this is actually after the show. Have you seen the Last of Us?\n\nDr. George Church (00:55:09):\n\nI haven't seen that. That movie. I've, I'm sorry. TV show, but I've, I've heard it that my daughter loves it. Yeah. it's on my wish list. But, but yeah, cor deceptions will, will force insects like ants to, to, to go up on a, on a plant. The and then, and then once they get up there, they, they, they kind of freeze there. And then the, and then the, then the fungus produces a fruiting body on the top of the, out, out of the head of the ant. And then the spores go everywhere. So it is kind of programmed. This ant is, did they mention this in the show?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:45):\n\nThey so the, the premise, it's based on a video game. And the premise is that fungus is, are less of a problem because they can't survive human body heat. But that in the process of global warming, the fungus has evolved to survive above 94 degrees, and all of a sudden they become a problem for humans and be, and we just don't really have any treatments, effective treatments for them.\n\nDr. George Church (00:56:09):\n\nYeah. And well, that, that's, that's not, not, it's not quite true. There are a lot of fun fungi that, that grow at a body temperature. Oh, good. In fact, there's a, there's a version, Sacra Myy Cevi, which is the bakers and brewers yeast has a pretty close relative that will grow at body temperature, which is a opportunistic pathogen. And of course, they're, they're fungi that, that infect immune compromised patients like h i v patients. But the thing that's cool about corti ceps, I can't believe they passed this opportunity, is what it does to ants. I'll, I'll, I'll send you.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:46):\n\nNo, that's fascinating. But it, but it, it's almost like, I mean, parasites do that as well, right? They they have life cycles that\n\nDr. George Church (00:56:53):\n\nYeah. Toxic plasma, toxic plasmas, right? Yeah. It, it influences behavior. Right. In fact, you could argue that a lot of pathogens influence behavior. Usually it's something trivial, like it causes you to cough. Right. Coughing spread is a really terrific way of, of spreading Yeah. Vomiting. Yeah. Diarrhea. These are all terrific ways of spreading little baby pathogens. Right. but, but, but there's just the cortis, it does it in such a graphic. I mean, when you see one of these things crawling up the plant and then sitting there, and then, then this spore forming thing comes out of the top it's just, it really is like body snatcher. It's just a time, you know,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:34):\n\nI think really in a way, the TV show shows that because humans become infected and then fruit <laugh> and it's\n\nDr. George Church (00:57:43):\n\nNot. Yeah. So I'll, I'll have to look it up. But, but I mean, they could have shown some actual footage of, of real Yeah. Of real ants infected with cor decept. No, no. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:54):\n\nA fascinating thing cuz we don't think of fungus is as well, I guess they're alive sort of in a quasi\n\nDr. George Church (00:58:01):\n\nOh, they're definitely, they're definitely alive. Yeah. Even viruses could be argued or are alive. Right. but they, they just req viruses. Like wolves require very complicated living systems to survive.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:16):\n\nFungus do not\n\nDr. George Church (00:58:18):\n\nFungus. No, they do. They do. Most of them do. Oh, okay. You know, they, fungus, unlike plant sub plants are the only things, photosynthetic organisms, the only things that really can grow on in inorganic material period. But almost everything else depends on some other organisms. Provide them with food. Fungus included.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:39):\n\nInteresting. This, this circle of life. Quite an amazing thing. <Laugh>. Yeah. Really. wow. Thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Church. I really appreciate you. Yeah, sure. For the full interview with George Church, you can tune in triangulation. It's weird. I have a old radio and TV habits You don't have to tune in, in, you can, you can download triangulation. Just go to twit tv slash t i. It'll be the most recent episode. It's also on our Twitter events feeds, twi do tv slash events. And you can watch it there. Now we think, while we were talking to Dr. Church, I think we got this call thing working again. So let's, let's try one more time. I see Dan has his hand raised. I'm gonna push the button if I can find him on the <laugh>. Now I don't see him. Oh, there he is. Okay. Dan has got his hand raised, sending him into the breakout room. Dan, welcome to ask the tech guys. Oh, that's a cool welcome shirt. You're driving. Wait a minute. Whoa, look at that. Holy, come\n\nCaller 4 (00:59:43):\n\nOn down. Formula one driver. My formula portion\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:46):\n\nDriver <laugh>. I love it. I\n\nCaller 4 (00:59:48):\n\nLove it. It's a picture from the track. Where are\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:50):\n\nYou calling? Where are you calling from?\n\nCaller 4 (00:59:52):\n\nBrookings, South Dakota. All right. Sorry. As you pronounced it as Kim Schaffer pronounced it, bur Kings South\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:59):\n\nKings Bur Kings are you, so you are, you're either a rock and roll guitarist or a Formula one driver, which is it?\n\nCaller 4 (01:00:06):\n\nI can't be both.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:07):\n\nOh yeah, you could be both <laugh>. Be both.\n\nCaller 4 (01:00:10):\n\nIt's nice. Very amateur welcome. Very amateur.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:12):\n\nWelcome back. Good to talk to you. What's up?\n\nCaller 4 (01:00:15):\n\nWell, as a non podcaster, I have a question for you. I know Mikah has said before that he uses audible to go to sleep. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I use podcasts to go back to sleep in the morning. So I don't bother my lovely wife. Aw. I wake up at, you know, five in the morning or some, sometimes, and a lot of times, and I'll just slip my AirPods Pro in mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and let go and go to town on a podcast. And I have since had, when I do go back to sleep, which is the, usually the goal, I have since had some semi lucid dreams where Oh, I'm on a podcast. So I was wondering if you guys, is\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:57):\n\nThat why you have that? Is that a dream microphone in front of you? Because for somebody who doesn't have a podcast, you got a pretty good microphone,\n\nCaller 4 (01:01:03):\n\n<Laugh>. Oh, I have a business that allows me to invest in whatever technology I want to. I spent the week. That's a good business. Containerizing my backend database, but No kidding. But anyway, I've Did you use Docker?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:15):\n\nDocker? What did you use for that?\n\nCaller 4 (01:01:16):\n\nYeah, Docker, I spent the week learning Docker and fun. But back to my original, I've since been a dream participant in Mac Break Weekly <laugh> slash film.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:27):\n\nDid you, did Annie and ACO come sit on your bed and <laugh>\n\nCaller 4 (01:01:32):\n\nAs it would happen that, oh, I was just so frustrated. I was like, I'm trying to think of something to, oh, I have something to say now. Now, if he would just stop talking, I can, let's going on here. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:45):\n\nIt's\n\nCaller 4 (01:01:45):\n\nNot a, and then the last,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:46):\n\nIt's real <laugh>\n\nCaller 4 (01:01:48):\n\n<Laugh>, the last incarnation. I was at church and you guys had rented a corner of the church for your podcast. And I was looking back there, I was like, Leo God, quiet down Rav Church.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:03):\n\nLeo, you in quiet down. No, no. Oh,\n\nCaller 4 (01:02:06):\n\nThat's super funny. I was, I was wondering if, did\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:09):\n\nDevendra, did Devendra Hardwar join you when you were falling asleep? The slash film?\n\nCaller 4 (01:02:13):\n\nNo, I was, I was, that was one more time where I was just frustrated. I was like, trying to think of something to say and I was having this,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:19):\n\nYou're in the show. I love that.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:02:21):\n\nI love this. So I know, I know what your question is. Have, has this ever happened? And this is the fascinating thing about what you're talking about. So sleep scientists who have for a long time tried to determine which stages of sleep are most important to us. And we have determined that rem rapid eye movement stage, which is the closest stage to actually being awake, is an incredibly important stage of sleep. Ah, but no one can say why. Ah, but one of the reasons why we think that it's the most important, or one of the most important is because of the fact that our brain does what you're describing. Have you've ever had a dream where you, you're like walking around and there's a cat that's making meow sounds. And then it turns out that it was actually your alarm that was going off in real life.\n\n(01:03:04):\n\nThat is because your brain is essentially protecting you from waking up. It is trying to keep you in rapid eye movement sleep instead, instead of letting you actually wake up. And so for you to be listening to this podcast and suddenly be in the podcast, that is so that your, your brain goes, okay, this is something that's happening in real life, but I need you to stay asleep because for some reason REM sleep is so important. So I'm going to make it seem like this is part of what's happening. It's frustrating your dream. Yeah. And it does this just to keep you going in rapid eye movement sleep. So yes, to answer your question, this has happened to me with lots of audio audiobooks. I'll wake up later in the day and I was just hanging out with Harry Dresden from the Dresden Files <laugh> because I was listening to that book before I fell asleep. And it's a really close, great\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:48):\n\nNew new meaning of Parasocial relationship <laugh>\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:51):\n\nAs it does.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:52):\n\nWe were, oh yeah, we were sleeping together the other day and <laugh>. So I would like to do that. I don't listen to podcasts. You know, it's funny because thanks to our eight sleep or sponsor eight sleep when it's really cozy in the morning, and thanks also to my excellent schedule, thanks to my wife, I can just go back to sleep. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So I do a lot more dreaming than I used to. Cuz that is when you dream, isn't it? Yes. So yeah, that's when that rem happens is cuz you're not gonna get at a deep sleep right away.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:04:19):\n\nYeah. So the, that's, you go down stage one, stage two, stage three, you come up stage two, stage one, and then your body makes the choice. Do I wake up right or do I go into rem? Rem A lot of people think REM is a deep sleep. It's not. It is a above, it's a light sleep. It is the exact same thing as being awake without being\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:35):\n\nI love dreaming. Yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:04:36):\n\nYeah, I do. And you need to, that's the thing is you've got to get down and back up again before if you wake up too soon, then you're not going to hit rem.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:44):\n\nIs that what, is that what you were asking about Dan? Is that a what's going on? Yeah,\n\nCaller 4 (01:04:48):\n\nI was just wondering if, if anybody else had had experienced elective. I'm not, I'm sure I'm not the only one that uses headphones to fall back asleep. Although it, it, it doesn't work like it used to. It used to just fall back asleep within five minutes. And now I just kind of, I listened for an hour sometimes.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:05:03):\n\nOh man.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:03):\n\nYeah. So now you've got me really curious. Dan, what do you do for a living?\n\nCaller 4 (01:05:08):\n\nI train power lineman. But\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:12):\n\nYou mean like also like I am a lineman for the county, that kinda line. Exactly.\n\nCaller 4 (01:05:17):\n\nOh, Glen Campbell was our spokesman. Yes. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:20):\n\nYou climbed the poles and you fix the wires up there.\n\nCaller 4 (01:05:23):\n\nThat's cool. My dad who wrote the program back in 1983 he was a lineman from the time he was 15. And and I wrote a database that ran our program in 1987 and Oh wow. Mentioned that ran, that ran until 2012 when I rewrote\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:45):\n\nIt. Wow. Who knew 4D D would last that long?\n\nCaller 4 (01:05:47):\n\nWow. I know. I was not, not many of them did <laugh>, but when I looked at the code 20 years later, I didn't even recognize it. I mean, it was,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:57):\n\nI'm impressed that you can sleep with AirPods on because they protrude out and I put my head on my pillow and it's, it's, I\n\nMikah Sargent (01:06:04):\n\nJust do one uncomfortable. I do whatever you Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:06):\n\nI do. You just do one.\n\nCaller 4 (01:06:07):\n\nI do one.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:08):\n\nThere are headphones. Father Robert showed us a pair that are designed for Sleeping Effect. I have the bows, sleep headphones that have a kind of flat surface. Yeah. Their theory is that you could, but then I was very disappointed. I said, I bought, I should bring those in cause I bought 'em. And then I found out you can't listen to podcast or audiobooks on them. Really. They're\n\nMikah Sargent (01:06:27):\n\nDesigned especially Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:28):\n\nThey're special, which means you can't listen to music or anything. You can listen to the sounds that Boze provides. That's, that's it. And maybe that's because they're so thin and they don't have oh, like a more process singer. I\n\nCaller 4 (01:06:41):\n\nDon't know what my original headphones were. The bows and whenever I would click, cuz when they, when you finish a podcast and overcast, if you just click it one more time, it'll start the next one. So, but the Bowes ones, when I clicked them, my wife would hear it and wake up. So I was always kinda trying to <laugh>. But the, the AirPods Pro are perfect.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:00):\n\nWell, Dan, until our next session in bed together, <laugh> I, I thank you. I look forward to it. I look forward to seeing you there, <laugh>. Thanks. Thanks Dan. I really appreciate it. Nice to give it a call. Nice to talk to you. Be careful. You go up on the polls or you just show you Say that one up there.\n\nCaller 4 (01:07:17):\n\nNo, I'm a I'm a tech guy. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:19):\n\nGood. You don't have to you don't have to climb those things. We had a family friend her son was a friend of my son's. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. She was a lineman or a line woman I guess you'd call it. And she was, she had the strongest upper body cuz she would be climbing those poles. She was very impressive. Wow. Do you have sleep headphones that you wear?\n\nMikah Sargent (01:07:38):\n\nI, I just wear an AirPod. The reason why the, I do actually have some, they're called sheep headphones, I think, I honestly can't remember, but I would get too warm because they wrap around your head like a headband and then they've got these sort of loose piso transducers in them. But it just was not good. And what I ended up going back to the AirPods Pro is because for some reason, since it's apple to apple, you can turn the volume down very, very, very low. And any third party headphone, just using the standard Bluetooth profile, it doesn't let you turn it down that low. And I can't have it very loud in my ear. I just have\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:14):\n\nA, a very quiet voice that's reading my book to me. Oh. And only AirPods, AirPods or AirPods Pro have been able to get that quiet enough to do that. Oh yeah. I got that head acoustic sheep. That's it. Thank you. Joe. Acoustic sheep. Yeah, acoustic sheep. I had the headband and then you see you wear it low so that it, it goes over your ears. Yeah. Yeah. I just got too, too warm cuz my ears do that. Yeah. Get warm from it. All right. I am gonna see if we can get Arizona, Neil on the horn here using the magic of technology that barely works. Hi, Neil <laugh>.\n\nCaller 5 (01:08:50):\n\nHey Leo. How you doing? I'm\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:51):\n\nGreat. I guessing you're in Arizona.\n\nCaller 5 (01:08:54):\n\nI am. I have been. I have talked many times with you on the, in, on the radio show. It might've been a listener since at least 2011, if not sooner than that. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:03):\n\nVery gratifying cuz I was worried that when I stopped doing the radio show, we gave it to Rich Tomorrow that people wouldn't follow us to the podcast. And so well as\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:12):\n\nIt happened.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:14):\n\nGo ahead.\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:14):\n\nNo, I'm catch you up. I just No, I'm just, I'm just gonna say that.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:18):\n\nI'm just glad you made it. No, I just, that's all I was gonna say, <laugh>,\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:21):\n\nThat's No, I was just saying, I, I found the last radio show, I guess it was after Christmas or whatever, and, and I said, and then I, it said check back on Mar January the eighth. There we go. And, and here we\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:34):\n\nAre.\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:35):\n\nAnd, and I and I found you\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:36):\n\nStill some\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:37):\n\nTechnical, he follow you from day one. Still\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:38):\n\nSome technical struggles. On the other hand, there's certain benefits to this. We can, you know, you get to see video if you wish. You don't have to we could see you, which is really great as far as I'm concerned. Where in Arizona are you?\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:51):\n\nChandler? Chandler. So this just southeast of Phoenix.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:55):\n\nSo you haven't ridden those Waymo's yet, have you?\n\nCaller 5 (01:09:59):\n\nWaymo's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:00):\n\nOh, oh, no. Driverless\n\nCaller 5 (01:10:01):\n\nVehicle. I know, I, I, I, you know, I had to think about Yes, I, no, I have not. I'm in the area and I'm willing to give it a try, but I have not actually had one. I actually, I actually don't drive. I may think about get, look at the, look at the electric bike.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:14):\n\nOh good. You're,\n\n(01:10:16):\n\nOh, you know, for people of a certain age, you and me you know, bike. I always, as a kid I biked like crazy. I love bicycling, but you know, it's harder and harder on your knees and stuff. The electric bike brought it back into my life and I just love, it's more fun than pedaling. It's so much fun. And then, then the problem is, oh, I don't wanna ride on the roads around here cuz too many people get creamed. So the fact that I could fold that one up, put it in my trunk and go to some nice pike park with bike path is just a transformational. It's gotten me out and about much more than before. So I highly, highly encourage you to do that. What's your question, Neil?\n\nCaller 5 (01:10:59):\n\nA couple of questions, really. Okay. I have been, well, I, I've been a longtime longtime listener as I say. And I have, I've got, I've taken many of your sponsors and recommendations to heart, so thank you. Worked better than others. Thank, thank you. In other words, some work The helm not the best idea, let's be honest about\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:14):\n\nOh, it's too bad. I feel bad. It was a good idea. But yeah, it's gone now.\n\nCaller 5 (01:11:18):\n\nYeah. It just didn't work. It was a mail what I have. Yeah. Yeah. But I did get fast mail. I finally took the plunge and I just paid for my plan. Good. And that's working very well. I didn't like fast mail. Yeah, right. So\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:32):\n\nThat's, yeah, that's what I ended up doing is I, I tried the helm and I, and then I went back to Fast Mail because I thought I'm gonna let them do the hard part. And it was a great idea to kind of keep your privacy but running your own mail server. But it's just not an easy thing to do, unfortunately. And I think people kind of gave up on it. Good. I'm glad you went to Fast Mail and I think you'll be happy.\n\nCaller 5 (01:11:52):\n\nSo I have, so I have Fast Mail and the only question, the only issue I had with the, with Fast Mail itself, with getting over there, was getting all of the contacts moved. All of the either email addresses, I've been a longtime listener, as I mentioned some, I've been on the internet since 1995. You and I are of the same age. Just so you know, November as matter of fact,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:12):\n\n56, I had a feeling. Yeah.\n\nCaller 5 (01:12:15):\n\n<Laugh>. So we're just, yeah. With a couple weeks apart. But anyway, nice. We've been on, you know, long enough. But it's a real pain to move all of the contacts over. I was hoping there was either an app or some easy way to do it. Yeah, there was\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:28):\n\nA having to go. So I'll tell you how I did it, cuz I did do that. I now use Fast Mail again, a sponsor. But we still like it. In fact, I've been plugging Fast Mail since you've been listening. In 2011. I, I moved both contacts and Address book. I mean and a calendar over to Fast Mail. They hosted just like Google would. So the trick was for me it was very easy. I just added fast mail to my iPhone. Now, if you have an iPhone or an Android phone, you know that you can be syncing your calendars on the phone with Google or some other service. Well, fast Mail is one of the services that you can do that with. And then you don't have to do anything. You just let it sync. And once it's all synced up and you can check by going to Fast Mail and going into the contacts now, you know, you've got all your contacts on Fast mail.\n\n(01:13:13):\n\nAnd then, but only do it after you've made sure everything's transferred over. You can disconnect any other, like, if you don't want to use Gmail anymore, which is what I did, I disconnected Gmail so that it does Google no longer has access to my phone numbers, my calendar, any of that stuff. So that was a very easy thing to do. It didn't require an export or an import. I still would recommend an export. It's always a good idea if you've got your contact list working and us old timers, we probably have, you probably have as many as I do. I have I think 1900 contacts in my contact list as soon as you, you know, I don't wanna lose them. So as soon as you got that looking like how you like it bef even before maybe you go to Fast mail, make a backup copy, almost any contact program, including the ones on Apple, Android, windows, and Mac, will allow you to export into either a comma separated values file, CSV file, or there's something called Card D which is a standard.\n\n(01:14:09):\n\nAnd if it, if it supports, that works too. That's the one that you know, fast mail's using. Same thing with your, your your calendar. That's Cal d you can export those out and then you can, you have a backup. So if, and this happens sometimes with synchronization, you might get like a mess happen where you get duplicates things five times or you might get zero. Suddenly you open up your cal your contact sensor. I don't know anybody. So if you have a backup, that's a good idea. Save all those names and addresses you've accumulated as I have over the years. So just turn, do do you use iPhone or Android or, or no. Phone.\n\nCaller 5 (01:14:43):\n\nIphone. I, I'm all in on the Apple. I guess I have the iPhone, the iPad, the watch and AirPods and so forth. Me\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:50):\n\nToo. Yeah. So Mike, it's just in the settings, right? Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:14:53):\n\nYeah, exactly. Instead of, they, they'll have the links at the top that have the icons for the different services that are the main services, Gmail, et cetera. But then below that you'll have those options for using a classic login for both card D and, and for the mail.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:11):\n\nYeah, definitely, definitely the easiest way to do it. You can export an import if you wish, but you don't have to. And, and the nice thing about synchronization isn't, it's okay to have it on as many places as possible. Right? We don't wanna lose it. Do you know how many contacts? I'm just curious, do you know how many contacts you have Neil,\n\nCaller 5 (01:15:27):\n\nMaybe 250 or something like that. Have quite as many as yourself?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:32):\n\n<Laugh>, you know,\n\nCaller 5 (01:15:32):\n\nI guess maybe it's around a long\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:33):\n\nTime. It's maybe my business, you know, because I, you know, I, I meet so many people and as a journalist I collect cards at, at conferences and things. So maybe that's why I have 1900 ridiculous numbers. That's\n\nCaller 5 (01:15:45):\n\nA lot. That's ridiculous. Well, the other thing I was gonna ask if I could jump in here, is the, I was thinking about moving. I have one password. I've been using that for years because I have all Apple stuff and it's, it works fine, but it is, it is a little pricey I would think of moving to Bit Warden which I noticed is a little more reasonable. But that scares me. And the idea of having to move all the, how to move the one password information into a new password manager. Is there a good way to do that? Same thing.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:11):\n\nVery easy. Go\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:12):\n\nAhead, Michael. Yeah, I was gonna say\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:13):\n\nIn fact we demonstrated, I think on our very first show, go back to that January 8th show, <laugh> you, I think I did a demo or maybe it was the next one.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:19):\n\nIt was one of the first, it\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:20):\n\nWas the 15th. It was one of the first couple. Yeah,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:21):\n\nIt, it's a simple thing. I mean, any password manager that <laugh> is you know, modern and is doing the right thing, is going to give you the ability to leave it if you want to. And one password is one of those. You could do an easy search for export from one password and I, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Bit Warden has a guide moving from one password to Bit Warden. It is a simple process of exporting the files and then moving them over. And if you're worried about, if you use like one time authorization codes, OTA codes all of that can come over too because essentially it's not, you know, you, you typically scan a QR code, but what that QR code has is a specialized link or a specialized URL essentially that then gets translated into this, the proper code.\n\n(01:17:05):\n\nSo all of that can be moved over as well. The only thing that you may have a bit of an issue with is if you've got documents and, and images and those kinds of things stored in your one password account, you'll just need to look at how one password handles exporting those. And of course, my biggest tip, my biggest advice is after you've done that export process, make sure you get rid of that unencrypted bit of information as quickly as possible, you know, to once you've moved it over. And honestly, if it were me, I'd hang on to that one password account for a little bit longer just to be safe. Cuz you never know if you know something gets lost in the shuffle and it's always worth kind of having that as a backup. But yeah, the, the process for any password manager that's worth it, salt is going to be an easy transfer from one to the other.\n\nCaller 5 (01:17:58):\n\nWell, thank you so much. It's great to talk here. I'd love the new format, by the way, this is a great show. It's a little more of the radio show was Yeah. Relax. You could take your time of it. You\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:06):\n\nHave 22 minutes worth of ads, either <laugh> during the show. Hey, one last question for you or request for you Neil.\n\nCaller 5 (01:18:13):\n\nSure.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:13):\n\nHaah, Waymo, <laugh>, one without a driver in it. Get your phone out and show us what it looks like to be riding in a taxi with no driver.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:24):\n\nWe would love that.\n\nCaller 5 (01:18:24):\n\nI'll see what I can do. I'll see what I could do. All\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:26):\n\nRight, Neil, pleasure to talking\n\nCaller 5 (01:18:28):\n\nTo you. Nice time with you. Take care. Likewise. Take care. Bye-Bye. Thank you so much. Bye now.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:32):\n\nThey thought I was crazy <laugh>, they thought it was right outta my hand.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:36):\n\nI was\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:36):\n\nWondering the driver on the top. Oh, I'm sorry. No, you're fine. <Laugh>, if, what were you wondering?\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:41):\n\nI was wondering if we could take a break and then go to and after this. Does that work or\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:46):\n\nNo? We could totally do that. Okay. How about that? How\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:49):\n\nAbout\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:49):\n\nThat? He's producing me kids, just so you know. That's what it looks like when a talented producer wants you to do something. They ask nicely. I show <laugh>. We're gonna have aunt make the transition from Windows to Mac with a little help from our friends.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:07):\n\nI got Bye with a little help from my aunt. You\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:09):\n\nDon't wanna make Anne angry\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:11):\n\n<Laugh>. No, you won't like him when he's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:13):\n\nAngry. Okay. Okay. He's such a gentle giant. Yeah, I've never seen him. Well, I've seen him maybe once angry. But we're gonna try to make it an easy transition for him.

How many years has aunt used Windows his whole life, right? You've been a Windows guy. Aunt is gonna show us some of the issues he had transitioning to Mac Watch.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:24:21):\n\nHello Tech guys. I am Ant Pruitt. I think you know who I am. I'm that guy that is the only person using Windows there at twit. Yeah, that's me. Also host of hands on photography. It's been a couple weeks since I finally made the move from Windows to Mac os. You know, again, being the only person running windows there at twit I, I, I've gotta say I've always found Apple Hardware to be pretty badass. It just, just looks so good and it seems to have all of the nice performance numbers, you know. I've always thought Mac OS or O S X was pretty, you know, I always thought it was smooth, you know, but I could never really dive into the world of OS X or now Mac Os until recently. Why couldn't I dive into it? Well, there's a couple things.\n\n(01:25:11):\n\nTwo things actually. First, apple computers. They, they never had enough ports on them. And coming from a Windows environment, I needed multiple USB ports for my peripherals. You have your keyboard, you have your mouse, you have your webcam, you have your direct access storage, you have thumb drives, you have audio interfaces like this here. And so on. Now you need more than two or three USB ports on a laptop. Clearly, at least I did. So that was one big thing. The second thing was the cost of Apple computers. They were always outta my budget. Yeah, they just were. And then when it got to the point where they were in my budget, I still found the lack of ports. And I found the lack of Upgradeability being a non-starter. Now, if I wanted to install a new graphics card or something, I couldn't do it.\n\n(01:26:02):\n\nNow I know that wasn't a big thing on the Mac side. So let's take a look at an <inaudible> sample. I wanted to install some RAM on my computer. Couldn't do it. You, you just couldn't do it. I wanted to put, you know, an extra 32 gigs on myself. I couldn't do it. That was a problem. And it was, I was always curious about the Mac Mini, you know, that small form factor, it looks great. It looked like it had plenty of horsepower, if you will. But again, it never had any ports on it. I need more ports. Now. Fast forward to today, actually, just a couple of weeks ago you know, I got my hands on the New Mac mini, you know, when Apple announced the New Mac mini, it was, it, it not only brought up the next generation Apple silicone but it also put some more ports on this device.\n\n(01:26:53):\n\nAnd honestly, it still wasn't quite enough for me. But I thought I could get closer to it being something that that would work for me. And then my price range, if I went and found some type of doc to gimme some extra IO and I did find a doc, which was discussed on this week in Google, and for the most part it's working. Okay. Now, with all of that said, hmm. If I were to, to, to go back in time and re redo all of this again, I would look for, or maybe even create some type of primer that's based on going from Windows to Mac. Cuz right now, when I look out there for something that, that walks through the process of going from Windows to Mac, I get a whole lot of fanboy stuff. I don't want that. And it's just a whole lot of, oh, how great it is to be on Mac from Windows, you know?\n\n(01:27:43):\n\nAnd I get that people are gonna be happy. But there's a couple things that I've come across that just sort of bugged me and I'm hoping that you, the tech guys can help me out. So first, and there's four points. First is the notifications inside of Mac Os. Now look here, I can't stand the notifications on iOS. Absolutely hate 'em. I think they're just not functional at all. So then when I get into Mac os, it's pretty much the same thing. I hate 'em. And so I spent a lot of time just trying to turn notifications off for different apps and things like that. This stuff still pop up and it just annoys me with all get out. So just, I need to find a way to get rid of notification cuz I, I, I just don't care. Secondly, app installation on Mac os.\n\n(01:28:28):\n\nNow when those things are pretty straightforward, you get an m MSI or xc, you just click on it, boom, it runs and it does its thing to install whatever app you're trying to install. On the Mac side, you get some type of zip file or you get a DMG or you get a zip that's in the DMG and then you get the dm. No, you get a DMG that's in the zip, see, I'm already confused. And then you get the option to drag set file into the applications folder or you have to double click the DMG to make it do the installation. So it was a, it was a little bit confusing at first, but it was no big deal. That's just some extra muscle memory that I need to try to figure out. And then there's the doc in macros. The doc is quite useful.\n\n(01:29:11):\n\nYou know, I guess it's useful enough for Microsoft to decide, hey, we wanna put our stuff at the bottom just like a Mac does too. So I like the doc, but I don't care for the fact that I can have this bit of an O C D moment and see that some applications or services are running when I know they're closed. Well, the windows are closed at least. I don't like the fact that if I click on a Windows, like I don't know. So let's say I open up Spotify and I'm listening to some music and I'm done listening to Spotify. Stop the music, close the window there for Spotify. Look down at my dock. It's still down there running. Okay cuz that little white DOT's there. Then I realized, oh yeah, you have to go to that top menu, hit foul quit or whatever it is to stop whatever it is you're, you're running.\n\n(01:29:58):\n\nYeah, that's an extra step, extra bit of muscle memory. But what's the point of having that little red dock there in the window to close the window if it's not gonna close the application or that's just my Windows brain coming through and battling here. Because in Windows, if I close the window, it closes the app, it closes the service 95% of the time. Okay. But anyway, I'm, I look here, I, I know this, this sounds like I'm doing a bit of nitpicking, but yeah, I am actually <laugh>. Lastly, point number four, the file system of MCs. And "
