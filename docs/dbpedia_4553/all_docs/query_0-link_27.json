        "text": "Yeah, Ham Nation, Triangulation and This Week in Enterprise seem destined for the shit can. IOS and Macbreak or IOS and Android seem destined for a merger.\n\nTech News Weekly, This Week in Google, Floss and Security Now are all tossups.\n\nThe others are their bread and butter, and likely would fold only if this PoS Leo has created for himself: An actual pile of human excrement, in podcast form – ends up going under for good. Which, honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if it happens sometime before 2020 (God how weird it is to think that 2020 is now less than a year away! Jeez!) arrives.\n\nI mean, at this point TWiT is a confirmed failure to launch: He tried to corner the market on Podcasts when pure audio only was still a thing, then half-assed it to the video conversion that should’ve been what he (and this) started as and revolved around. ZDTV and TechTV were both “things” that existed solely because of… TV. Meaning video.\n\nBack before the video feeds came around, I know I’d listen to TWiTs first few episodes when I’d ride the Metro to and fro baseball games – I always felt like something was simply just missing from it all: I watched The Screen Savers and whatnot for the video aspect as much as anything. It just didn’t “work” as pure audio/Podcasts – and I think TWiT’s general/overall failure kinda proves that point. Leo should’ve waited a couple of years more and begun as a video/YouTube endeavor first and foremost.\n\nThen, Leo should have been something… anything…? besides the absolute Horse’s Ass we all now know him to be. He’s “accidently” posted more private images of the Laporte couple’s genitalia and acted boorishly more times than I care to even bother counting anymore.\n\nThat said, TWiT as a YouTube circa 2007-8 resurrection of the glory days of ZDTV/TechTV could have and should have been a “thing” – instead we were left with a Podcast tech network in an age of video on demand/streaming. Seriously, the very idea of a podcast today is so outdated it isn’t even funny – and the fact TWiT still pushes/brands itself around the idea of being a Podcast content creator in 2019 is utterly laughable. YouTube has been a thing for *over* a decade already: Invent a time machine and Google it back in 2008, Leo – you might’ve very well had a hit on your hands. Especially if he’d focused on rebranding around the New Screen Savers over This Week in Tech: Squeeze every last drop out of the Tech/ZDtv nostalgia memento, and use said brand as the launching point for a brand new, separate endeavor.\n\nWhat could have been… and now, apparently, what will simply never, ever be: Not as the USS Leotanic continues plummeting to the icy depths of the ocean. It’s almost literally on borrowed time now: Not a question of if this whole project goes under, but instead only a matter of *when* – and from appearances outlined in this here post, that “when” is as imminent as it is definitive.\n\nTime for Leo Laporte to sail off into the golden waters of retirement, and stop pissing all over the fondness/nostalgia that I look back on ZD/TechTV and remember positively all the entertainment I derived from TSS, XPlay and Martin Sargent’s various late night comedic entries. It really was a special little network during a special little. Heck, I remember back when… I think it was Windows 98…? was released, and they did this special live 24 hour broadcast. Going mad. For Windows *98*!!! Oh, those were the days!\n\nAnd I know that I’ll never forget how I got a free Netcam from them way back when, then used it to record one of those “You’re watching Netcam Week 2 on ZDTV – amaze yourself!” I even managed to catch them airing my promo a few times. How crazy is it to think I was broadcast on national TV several times because of that – sh!t like that is precisely why ZD/TechTV *was* so special. It really was a television network like no other, with a level of fan engagement matched by very, very few others. That same fan engagement is also something missing from TWiT: Half the fun of TSS and whatnot were the audience participation/calls. Having an often “round table of talking heads” as the hosts for the shows quite literally just “phone it in”, as it were… it just ain’t the same.\n\nAnd hell, I’ve even *still* got that Netcam, too! (Psst: See, Leo – digital video and streaming was a thing, even way back in 1998! I’ll never change my mind that the Podcast over video content and Leo’s belated and halfassed entry into including video streams for some of the shows is what sealed his fate, and that, had he begun with and fully embraced video content with a nascent YouTube, he could’ve very easily had something *FAR*more successful than what TWiT now knows as its sad, paltry and pathetic reality.)\n\nMind you, I never even really got into TNSS at all – I was all super excited for the loooooooooooooooooong awaited Leo and Kate reunion, and Patrick, to boot! But as the show became more of the same of the same “Tech News of the Week” presented by a *constantly* rotating cast – just This Week in Tech with a different name and set, really – I drifted away. Quickly. Ten episodes in an I’d already stopped watching.\n\nAnd really, one more thing I thought to comment on regarding TWiT’s demise as a network, is that same *constantly* rotating cast. TSS worked because Leo and Kate had a certain kind of chemistry. Really, I watched it more for Kate Botello than I did Leo. Then, she got replaced by Patrick, who was likewise for me: I watched it *far* more for Patrick Norton than I ever did for Leo Laporte. Really, Leo was always more of the guy you just tolerated/put up with for everything in the show that wasn’t named Leo Laporte.\n\nBut really, that show worked because of that chemistry between cohosts, something which was only possible with consistency: I’m sure Kate’s first few episodes were a mess, and I know I remember thinking Patrick would never work at first. But eventually, they grew comfortable and knew how to… “handle” having Leo as a cohost, and so both versions ended up being wildly successful. But then, with this abomination Leo took to calling TNSS, he literally reversed that aspect fuelling TSS’s success in every way conceivable: Having a constantly, permanently rotating body of cohosts centered around the singular consistent part of the show from one week to the next: Leo Laporte.\n\nReally, one could write a book about how Leo’s done just about every single possible mistake or wrong choice he could. It’s almost as though one could say “Here’s what Leo Laporte would do” and you know with absolute certainty that the correct choice is the polar opposite of whatever he’d come up with.\n\nBut really, the fact the idiot took the Screen Savers name, then ignored the singular defining aspect of it: Two *permanent* cohosts developing a repertoire and bantering back and forth, as he instead made TNSS into yet another Leo Laporte show. Really, that guy is so full of himself it’s absolutely nauseating.\n\nOkie dokie, /rant pining for nostalgic days of ZD/Tech is now over… for now!"
