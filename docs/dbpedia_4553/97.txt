The TWiT.tv Podcast Network with Leo Laporte features the #1 ranked technology podcast This Week in Tech, along with more than a dozen top-ranked online shows. Since 2005, our shows have provided news, commentary, help, how-to and perspective on the latest trends in digital tech from seasoned experts and journalists. Leo hosts and produces many of the shows, but as the network expands, new hosts and contributors are added. All of our shows are free. TWiT is supported by advertising and listener donations. We limit the number of ads on each show, and we only accept advertising from companies whose products or services benefit our audience. We also offer Club TWiT, a membership service for ad-free listening/watching and extras for $7 a month. Learn more and join at twit.tv/clubtwit. As we've grown, our facilities have expanded into a multimillion dollar studio and a full staff to produce over 30 hours of content a week. Our live stream lets you watch and listen to our shows being produced, along with other incidental coverage of tech issues, breaking news, and Leo's personal life. You can watch live every day of the week (and re-runs when we're not live) at http://live.twit.tv/.
