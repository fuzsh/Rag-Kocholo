Hello, I'm Simon Pegg.

Hello, I'm Henry Cavill.

And we're here today

to teach you-- To teach you

about English slang.

Or as we call it iggity biggity.

(laughs)

Idiot box.

Is that the TV? I think that's the TV.

TV, idiot box.

Idiot box is the TV

'cause everything that's on it is rubbish.

(chuckles)

Apart from when Mission: Impossible comes out on TV--

On TV, and some shows like Handmaid's Tale and West World.

Everything else is rubbish.

Billions is great. Billions is great.

Actually, there's lots of great things on the idiot box.

[Henry] Twit.

Twit. An idiot.

A twit is a foolish person.

Yeah. You twit.

Or the noise a bird makes.

Yes--

When surprised.

Yes.

Argy-bargy.

That's when you start getting shovey and pushy

and you want a bit of a fight or a scrap.

Yes.

Yeah, it's a bit of aggro, innit?

Yeah. A bit of argy-bargy.

Doofer.

Doofer, well, I have someone, a colleague of mine,

who uses doofer for pretty much everything.

Doofer is a thing.

It can be, like, if I said to Henry, pass me the doofer,

I don't know what I'm gonna get.

It might be a remote control.

Yeah. It might be--

Anything. Anything.

Corker.

Now, a corker is someone who applies a stopper

to a wine bottle on a professional level.

(laughs)

It means something that's really good.

Yeah. Henry's a corker.

He's a bit of a corker. Isn't come from

a cricket play?

Is it? I think so.

Etymology of what a corker--

Oh, Alexander Corker.

Yes. The really good

cricket player.

The dog's bollocks.

Dog's bollocks or the smaller version, the mutt's nuts.

Or the cat's pajamas.

Or the hound's rounds.

It's basically the best.

The best of the best, yeah. The dog's bullocks.

Why dog's testicles represent that?

I don't know. I don't know.

But if you see a dog with a really good pair--

Everyone does remark on them.

Yeah, because most dogs unfortunately have--

You see that dog's nuts?

Yeah, look at the size of that dog's bullocks.

They're the dog's bollocks. They're the dog's bollocks.

Like, if you have a dog and its testicles are intact

and they're really, you know, they're quite presented,

you might say, Aw, they're the dog's bollocks,

and you'd be literal there.

The fuzz!

Now, the fuzz--

Didn't someone make a movie--

I think somebody did.

The fuzz comes from the US

'cause the police had big mustaches--

Ah, really? Seriously, yeah.

That's your own.

We've adopted it because of one of our own.

We made a movie titled that.

Hard cheese.

(laughs)

Which is another movie that Henry was in.

(laughs)

[Henry] Hard cheese.

Hard Cheese starring Henry Cavill.

I've never heard of that.

Hard-bitten police officer, Dave Cheese.

(laughs)

He's a vegan.

He's a vegan with lactose intolerance.

Hard cheese, though, I don't know.

What does that mean? It means tough luck.

Does it? Yeah, so hard cheese, mate.

Huh.

Okay, I'm gonna use that from now on.

If you didn't get, well, then hard cheese to you,

it's basically that.

Knees up!

Knees up, I'm having a knees up.

It's a party, isn't it? It's a party, yeah.

I'm having a bit of a party.

Muppet!

Fool. A fool.

Nice way of putting it.

Or that's the term we use

for a series of characters created by Jim Hensen.

Spend a penny.

That comes from the fact that you used to

have to put one pence into the lavatory stalls in order to--

Access them. Access them

to do a number one or number two,

or if you're unlucky, a number three.

To spend a penny is go number one.

Yeah, what is it if you do a number two?

A pound?

(laughs)

[Simon] All mouth and no trousers.

That means that someone tends to be verbally aggressive,

but never actually fights.

Can't back it up, basically. Yeah.

Bit of a damp squib, innit?

It's underwhelming.

It's, yeah, underwhelming.

It's when you expect a lot from something,

and then not much happens.

Yeah, perfect.

That's brilliant.

Know one's onions.

I'll tell you, I'll give you an example.

Henry and I were on set with Mission: Impossible - Fallout,

and we were talking about the character of Superman,

which Henry portrays,

and Henry began to list a number of comic books

which Superman appears in, and I thought to myself,

Henry' knows his onions.

It's because I'm an onion farmer.

(chuckles)

[Simon] Nob.

Nob, it's-- It's your nob, innit?

Yeah, it's--

Your penis.

Yeah. You say, Ow, me nob,

you know, if you banged it into a wall or--

Or don't be a nob.

Don't be a nob.

If you think of all the penile epithets,

they all have different meanings.

Like, if you're a prick, then, you prick.

You're a bit stupid.

But then if you're a nob, you are stupid, but less.

It's an affectionate kinda term.

But it's nice.

If you're a bit of a nob...

Like, I'd say to you, oh, stop being a nob, Henry,

and I wouldn't expect you to get offended.

But if I called you a dick,

then I'd be like, I'd be wrong 'cause you're not a dick.

You're a lovely man.

Well-- Sorry.

Tosh. Rubbish.

A load of old tosh.

Yeah, that's ridiculous.

Not to be confused with tash.

Thanks, Vanity Fair.

Hope you learned something.

I hope you learned some valuable English words to add--

Which you should definitely use.

Yes, you say you speak English, but you don't.

(chuckles)
