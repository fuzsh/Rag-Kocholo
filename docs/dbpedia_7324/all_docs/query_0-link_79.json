        "text": "Onn this thread, starting today, I’m going to start holding up songs by The Brothers Gibb (Barry, Robin, Maurice and Andy inclusive) including all of The Bee Gees songs.\n\nAs usual, I plan to go about this in my style, giving information about each song as we go along (where it’s available) and I encourage other users to add information that I might not have or correct information which I present, if necessary.\n\nParticipants may rate the songs on a 1 to 5 rating system, and decimals are allowed and counted. However rating is optional: discussion is the name of the game. I like rating as it focuses my internal critic, but of course, at the end of the day, rating works of art is nonsense. Although I am interested on seeing how collective ratings play out.\n\nOther than Bee Gees and “Brother Gibb” solo projects I also plan to include, wherever possible, the dozens of songs which were written and/or produced by The Brothers Gibb over their long and remarkable career. In contrast to my Beach Boys thread, though, I will not be covering well-known “bootleg\" recordings which have circulated widely (early seventies solo albums by Maurice and Barry in particular, or the --tragically--aborted A Kick In The Head Is Worth Eight In the Pants. The only non-released song I plan on going over, in fact, is today’s song, as an exception, to kick off the thread in a small way.\n\nIf those unreleased songs should be released, then I will go over them at some later point.\n\n___A Brief Biography__________________________________________________\n\nI think that The Bee Gees biography is fairly well-known and I won’t go too far into it here in this introductory post. Barry, and twins Robin and Maurice Gibb were born on the Isle of Man in in 1946 and 1949, respectively.\n\nThey loved singing together and knew they wanted to be professional singers from a very early age. Their father was a professional drummer who played at Manx hotels during the summer holiday season and worked odd jobs in the rest of the year; and their mother had been a singer in her youth. Eventually the gruel of that life, caused the family family to move to Manchester, England, where their youngest sibling, Andy, was born in 1958. Their parents don't seem to have pushed them into a musical career, but they enthusiastically supported them from the beginning.\n\nBarry had been gifted with a cheap acoustic guitar on his tenth birthday. Learning an open guitar tuning from a neighbour, he was pretty much self taught, and continued to play mostly on open tunings throughout his career. He started writing songs almost immediately.\n\nIt was in Manchester in the late fifties that the Brothers really began their career. Legend has it that they enlisted to appear as “The Rattlesnakes” in a lip-synching talent show at a cinema in Manchester. The record they were planning to mime to (“Wake Up Little Susie”, by the Everly Brothers) was dropped by Barry on the way. The record shattered. Without a song to mime to, the brothers, accompanied by Barry’s acoustic guitar, sang instead an a cappella rendition of the Mudlarks’ ‘Lollipop”. The audience response was so enthusiastic that they sang a further five songs.\n\nAfter that, the band played a number of short, but paying gigs in Manchester, never earning much money but doing what they loved, and also busked on the street for spare change.\n\nIn 1958, not long after Andy was born, the Gibb family left Manchester behind and moved to Australia, entertaining fellow passengers on the way.\n\nNot long after arriving, the brothers began performing at various events in Australia for change, and eventually caught the ear of radio DJ Bill Gates,(not the Microsoft guy) who was blown away by their professionalism and sound and invested in the band, buying them instruments and paying for some recordings to be made. After they began performing at hotels and some pubs and some of their performances were played a little on local radio.Their act included not only covers but original songs written by Barry, from whom songs were beginning to geyser at a pace faster than they would ever be recorded. It also included comedy skits that the brothers wrote themselves, as well as amusing impressions of celebrities and other musicians.\n\nThey became known as “The Bee Gees”. The name was chosen for the initial of both Barry Gibb and Bill Gates, as well as their mother, Barbara Gibb and racecar driver Bill Goode, who had called Bill Gates’s attention to the brothers….Eventually of course, the letters stood for “The Brothers Gibb”, and first performed Barry’s original “Time Is Passing” at this point.\n\nFor this intitial phase of the thread, I plan to go over all of their songs --recorded either by The Brothers Gibb themselves or other artists -- in the order they were recorded, more or less, and I will follow this tack through their debut album, 1965's The Bee Gees Sing And Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs, which was more a compilation of previously recorded tracks than a proper album.\n\nAfter that, I’ll go through the songs of 1966’s Spicks And Specks, and follow that album and each subsequent album with various non-album songs (A-sides, B-sides, outtakes) as well as songs written by one or more of the brothers for other artists.\n\nI will not be holding up any of the numerous songs on which The Bee Gees sang back up vocals for other artists separately; but will focus mainly on original songs, although a handful of covers that have been officially released by The Bee Gees themselves, will also be held up for discussion.\n\nNote: The Bee Gees, especially Barry, were unusually prolific songwriters, particularly in these early years. So I can understand if any followers of this thread will want sit out some of this early stuff — it is quite extensive and, though always tuneful, not quite at the truly expressive stage. Just a warning. It will be some time before we get to the High Years of the late sixties, much less the years of The Brothers’ superstardom in the late seventies.\n\nAnd thus on posts like these, I plan to regularly give updates on upcoming songs, as we go through each “chapter\" of The Brothers’ career. This is so people who aren’t interested in the paraphernalia of the Brothers’ career but do want to talk about their more well-known songs, can sit them out if they wish.\n\nFor all this material I will be drawing from the information published on the simply awesome Gibbs Songs website, which is an exhaustive online resource for all things Brothers Gibb.\n\nI’ll also be consulting various books about The Bee Gees for this thread, though in my opinion, no resource beats the Gibbs Songs website in conciseness while simultaneous providing specificity in details as well as a clear overview.\n\nThe songs I will cover in the next few days from this initial period, starting today, are (all songs are by The Bee Gees unless noted otherwise):\n\n1960-1963\n\nTime Is Passing (Barry Gibb) {1960, performed on Australian television}\n\nThe Battle of the Blue and the Grey (Gibb) {May, 1963, A-side}\n\nThe Three Kisses of Love (Gibb) {May 1963, B-side}\n\nUnderneath the Starlight of Love (Gibb) - Col Joye {1963, B-side}\n\nTimber (Gibb){July 1963, A-side}\n\nTake Hold of That Star (Gibb) {July 1963, B-side}\n\nThe Bee Gees ep (September, 1963, to be held up the same daythe same day)\n\nI’d Like to Leave If I May (Gibb) Lonnie Lee & the Leemen {1963, B-side}\n\nLet’s Stomp, Australia Way (Gibb, Johnny Devlin) Tony Brady {1963, A-side} above two songs on the same day\n\nLucky Me (Gibb) Tony Brady {1963, B-side}\n\nSurfer Boy (Gibb) Noeleen Brantley {1963, B-side}\n\n1964\n\nPeace of Mind (Barry Gibb) {A-side}\n\nDon’t Say Goodbye (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nCan’t You See That She’s Mine (Dave Clark, Mike Smith) {released on Brilliant From Birth, 1998}\n\nFrom Me To You (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) {released on Brilliant From Birth, 1998}\n\nYesterday’s Gone (Chad Stewart, Wendy Kidd) {released on Brilliant From Birth, 1998}\n\nJust One Look (Doris Payne, Gregory Carroll) {released on Brilliant From Birth, 1998}\n\nClaustrophobia (Gibb) {A-side}\n\nCould It Be (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nTurn Around, Look at Me (Jerry Capeheart) {A-side}\n\nTheme from “The Travels of Jerry McPheeters” (Jerry Winn, Leigh Harline) {B-side}\n\nHouse Without Windows (Gibb) Trevor Gordon {A-side, 1965}\n\nAnd I’ll Be Happy (Gibb) Trevor Gordon {B-side, 1965}\n\nOne Road (Gibb) Jimmy Little{A-side}\n\nScared of Losing You (Gibb) - Reg Lindsey{B-side}\n\nNever Like This (Gibb) Del Juliana{A-side}\n\nI Just Don’t Like to Be Alone (Gibb) Bryan Davies {A-side}\n\nLove And Money (Gibb) Bryan Davies{B-side}\n\n1965:\n\nEveryday I Have to Cry (Arthur Alexander) {A-side}\n\nYou Wouldn’t Know (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nLittle Miss Rhythm & Blues (Gibb) Trevor Gordon{A-side}\n\nHere I Am (Gibb) Trevor Gordon{B-side}\n\nI Wanna Tell The World (Gibb) Michelle Rae {A-side}\n\nEverybody’s Talkin’ (Gibb) Michelle Rae {B-side}\n\nWine And Women (Gibb) {A-side}\n\nFollow The Wind (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nWatching The Hours Go By (Gibb) Noeleen Brantley {A-side}\n\nI Was a Lover, a Leader of Men (Gibb) {A-side}\n\nAnd The Children Laughing (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nI Don’t Think It’s Funny (Gibb) {The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs}\n\nHow Love Was True (Gibb) {The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs}\n\nTo Be Or Not to Be (Gibb) {The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs}\n\nThe Bee Gees Sing & Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs\n\nBaby I’m Losing You (Gibb) Noeleen Brantley {A-side}\n\nThey’ll Never Know (Gibb) -Wayne Newton {from Red Roses for a Blue Lady}\n\nI Will Love You (Gibb) -Tony Brady{A-side}\n\nWho’s Been Writing on the Wall Today (Gibb) Jenny Bradley {A-side}\n\nChubby (Gibb) Jenny Bradley {B-side}\n\nThat’s What I’ll Give to You (Gibb} Jimmy Boyd{A-side}\n\nBad Girl (Gibb} Dennis & The Delawares{A-side}\n\nThey Say (Gibb}Dennis & The Delawares{B-side}\n\nYou Do Your Loving with Me (Gibb} Lynne Fletcher{A-side}\n\n1966\n\nI Want Home (Gibb) {A-side}\n\nCherry Red (Gibb) {B-side}\n\nSo, I’ll start holding up songs from The Bee Gees’ first proper album Spicks And Specks on January 8th. I will post over Christmas.\n\nNote: (I”m aware that the Bee Gees and Robin Gibb both have some Christmas songs…but I’m going to save those for the Christmas season 2024.) We’ve got a ways to go…\n\nAnother note. It’s very possible that some of these very early songs, especially the side-projects will not be available on public streaming sources like YouTube or Spotify outside of Australia. I hope that they are, but if they aren’t, then I suppose I’ll have no choice but to move on to the next song that does, which will mean that we will get through these sooner than I’m planning. I've already checked and found a few songs that aren't available and I assume there will be more.\n\nA final note: I was planning to start this thread tomorrow, but I'm going abroad for a few days so I'm posting an early song today that has only been released on video to kick off the thread early. I should still be able to post, though. If I am unable to post where I'm going (Giant Mountains, Polish side) I'll be back home on Sunday afternoon Central European Time and will post then."
