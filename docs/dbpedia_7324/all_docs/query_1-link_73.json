        "text": "In 1955 brothers Robin, Maurice, and Barry Gibb formed the skiffle/rock & roll group entitled the Rattlesnakes, however in 1958 the family moved to Brisbane, Australia, and the band broke up. The brothers began performing at Redcliffe Speedway in 1960 to entertain the crowd, and made their television debut later in 1960 performing the song “Time Is Passing By”. Throughout the ‘60s the Bee Gees earned a signicant buzz however a hit record became highly elusive, and in 1966 the band moved back to England and signed with Polydor Records. To help record their debut international album the band recruited Colin Peterson on drums and Vince Melouney on guitar. Led by the single “To Love Somebody”, which reached the Top 20 in the U.S., and later “Holiday” , the Bee Gees released the well-received album “Bee Gees 1st” in 1967.\n\nAfter the success of the release, noted for Barry and Robin’s luscious vocal harmonising, the brothers took over the production reigns, and introduced more country and soul influences. Unable to agree on which song should be the lead single for their ambitious album “Odessa”, Robin walked out on the group and released the solo album “Robin’s Reign”. Barry and Maurice continued as the Bee Gees, however the album sold poorly despite the hit “First of May”. The band subsequently released the album “Cucumber Castle” which spawned a number of singles including “I.O.I.O.” in 1968.\n\nTwo years later the band got back together and had matured and experimented during their time apart. The result was a more pop/rock infused sound which led to the band’s first U.S. No. One single “Morning of My Life”. The 1972 album “To Whom It May Concern” didn’t fare particularly well in the charts, neither did the 1973 album “Life In a Tin Can”.\n\nThings changed however after recording at Miami, Florida’s Criteria Studios at the suggestion of Eric Clapton. Gone were the R&B and soul days, and the Bee Gees entered a new creative period of dance and funk sensibilities, with high, falsetto harmonies. The band’s first album in this new wave was “Main Course” which spawned the U.S. No. 1 single “Jive Talkin’”. This represented the wake of the Bee Gees’ ultimate success and with the subsequent album “Children on the World” released in 1976, the band hit the charts again with the notable singles “Nights on Broadway” and “Love So Right”.\n\nIn 1977, after contributing to the soundtrack for the film “Saturday Night Fever”, the Bee Gees helped craft the disco era in America. With the singles “Stayin’ Alive”, “How Deep is Your Love”, and “Night Fever” all of which topped the charts, the Bee Gees were exposed to tens of millions of people. Seemingly untouchable in their stature, the band diverged from their disco sound and dove head first into Philadelphia soul. “Spirits Having Flown” was released in 1979 and sold over 30 million making it their highest selling record and marked the peak of the band’s success.\n\nThe ‘80s was a quiet time for the band, with Barry working as a producer for the likes of Barbara Streisand and Diana Ross. The Bee Gees released the album “One” in 1989 before the release of four-disc anthology “Tales of the Brothers Gibb. In 1997 the brothers were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and the band subsequently released the live album ”One Night Only” in 1998."
