        "text": "the Bee Gees, English-Australian pop-rock band that embodied the disco era of the late 1970s. In becoming one of the best-selling recording acts of all time, the Bee Gees (short for the Brothers Gibb) adapted to changing musical styles while maintaining the high harmonies, elaborate melodies, and ornate orchestrations that were their trademark. The principal members were Barry Gibb (b. September 1, 1946, Isle of Man), Robin Gibb (b. December 22, 1949, Isle of Man—d. May 20, 2012, London, England), and Maurice Gibb (b. December 22, 1949, Isle of Man—d. January 12, 2003, Miami, Florida, U.S.).\n\nAfter emigrating to Australia with their parents, the Gibb brothers returned to England in the mid-1960s to further their singing careers. Their early recordings, including dramatic hits such as “Massachusetts” (1967), drew comparisons with the Beatles. The trio reached the Top Ten with “I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You” and “I Started a Joke” (both 1968) but split briefly after the relative failure of their concept album Odessa (1969). Once reunited, they had hits with “Lonely Days” (1970) and “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” (1971), but there were several hitless years before they returned to the charts with Main Course (1975). Recorded in Miami, grounded in rhythm and blues, and typified by the chart-topping single “Jive Talkin’,” it put the Bee Gees at the forefront of the disco movement, which their work on the sound track album Saturday Night Fever (1977) would popularize and in many ways define. The recording earned several Grammy Awards, including album of the year. Besides writing their own hits, such as “Stayin’ Alive,” the brothers composed tracks for other artists on the album, which would eventually sell 40 million copies. Subsequent albums, however, failed to match the success of their earlier work. The group disbanded on several occasions, most notably after the death of Maurice in 2003, though Barry and Robin reunited in 2009 and made several appearances. After Robin died in 2012, Barry occasionally performed and recorded as a solo act.\n\nIn 1997 the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2015 received a Grammy for lifetime achievement. The documentary The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart appeared in 2020."
