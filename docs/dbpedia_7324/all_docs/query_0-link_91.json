        "text": "A remarkable property that was once Robin Gibb's house has gone on the market for $12,900,000.\n\nThe house is called Kenjockety' (Native American for 'Far from Noise'), and sits on six acres of land with 500ft of waterfront land and a 200ft deep water dock.\n\nIt's situated in the wealthy area of Lloyd Harbour in Long Island, around an hour's drive from Manhattan.\n\nSee: World's best homes – tour the globes most beautiful houses\n\nRobin was one third of The Bee Gees, whose record sales are estimated in excess of 200 million, and sang alongside his twin brother Maurice and older brother Barry Gibb. He passed away in May 2012 following a battle with cancer.\n\nThe singer owned the property in the 1980s, and presumably used it as a retreat to relax away from the spotlight.\n\nThe mansion boasts seven bedrooms, and seven bathrooms, and even has an elevator for added A-list allure.\n\nThe rooms are expansive and offer soothing views out over the water; there's direct access down rustic wooden steps to the beachfront and dock.\n\nThe vast dining room has the benefit of the vista, and also features sophisticated chandeliers.\n\nThe kitchen has granite countertops, a large sociable kitchen island, and those fantastic views over the Long Island Sound.\n\nSee: Kitchen ideas – decor and decorating ideas for all kitchens\n\nThe lounge is home to statement Art Deco pendants and a cosy fireplace for the perfect spot to relax of an evening.\n\nSee: Living room ideas – clever ways to decorate living spaces\n\nAnd the bedrooms are equally sumptuous, with all boasting extravagant square footage, while others have open fireplaces.\n\nThe incredible property was built in 1926 as a wedding gift from Arthur H. Fleming for his daughter, Marjorie (Mrs. Wilton Lloyd Smith). The Flemming’s were very good friends with Albert Einstein, who stayed at the house on a regular basis.\n\nThe architect was Bertrum Grosvenor Goodhue who also designed St. Bartholomew's in New York City, The Cathedral at West Point and Cal Tech in California.\n\nThe second owner of the home was Edward Cournant an industrialist and President of Lanvin Perfumes. The fourth owner was Robin Gibb.\n\nSee: Frank Sinatra’s house - explore the singer's Californian desert hideaway on sale for $4.25 million\n\nWhere did Robin Gibb live?\n\nRobin Gibb and his wife had a main residence in Thame, Oxfordshire. They split their time between their UK home with other properties on the Isle of Man and in Miami, Florida.\n\nWhere does Barry Gibb live?\n\nThe last surviving member of The Bee Gees, Barry Gibb has lived in Miami since 1974. He has a waterfront mansion in an exclusive country club estate."
