        "text": "Jive Talkin, their first single of Main Course reached nr. 1 in the US on June 18. (5 in U.K.). A party was organized by Stigwood at Rockefeller Plaza and when Main Course was released no one believed this were The Bee Gees after hearing their new sound! Time for a next American Tour. The group had rehearsed on Man for their upcoming tour in Douglas Bay Hotel and May 30th. the tour started in Dayton, Ohio. It was not an immediate success as no one was aware yet of the change the group had made musically. After a couple of shows the situation changed and even more appearances were added as well as TV shows. The Bee Gees still had all their old fans but suddenly there were coming lots of new fans too. In June the album Main Course was released. Maurice and Lulu’s divorce became final August 21st, however Lulu would always stay friend of the family. In September there was the release of the second single: Nights On Broadway, the group started their Canada tour. Maurice announced his engagement to Yvonne Spenceley and Linda had a miscarriage. The Canadian tour ended in Halifax, Nova Scotia and the group returned to Europe. Barry and Linda then moved to their new house, also in Douglas; ‘Sherdley’ on Princess Rd. and Maurice and Yvonne decided to get married. The ceremony took place October 17th. at Haywards Heath. Barry was best man and walked on crutches and with his leg in plaster after a fall from the steps in front of his house.\n\nIn September Children Of The World was released as well as the second single of the album: Love So Right. Also this year the album All This And World War Two was released and by the end of the year the group started another tour across the USA. The Bee Gees did a huge charity concert in New York: Madison Square Garden on December 2nd. for the Police Athletic League. A charity to provide facilities for underprivileged children via police sponsored youth clubs. They received keys of the city of New York as well as New Orleans and San Francisco. The group became extremely popular again and RSO even let The Bee Gees open their own shop at New York’s 57th. Street, their ‘International Headquarters’ where one could buy their albums and lots of Bee Gees merchandising!! The last concert of their American Tour at the L.A. Forum , December 20th. was recorded for their planned live album.\n\nIn the first part of 1978 it were all Gibb compositions which dominated the US charts. In March there were five songs simultaneously in the top ten: Night Fever, Stayin’ Alive, Emotion, (Love Is) Thicker Than Water and How Deep Is Your Love. Finally there came recognition for Saturday Night Fever too when May 12th. The boys received the Ivor Novello Award (How Deep Is Your Love, Best Pop Song, Best Film Movie Song) and a 3rd. Ampex Golden Reel Award also for S.N.F. More awards would follow. Another release came in April: If I Can’t Have You.\n\nBarry was asked by Stigwood to write a song for yet another project. The song should be called: Grease. It sounded difficult but it again worked and Barry wrote another smash hit – Grease- for the film with the same name. (Released in May).\n\nDifferent it would turn out with the project Sgt. Pepper, a film with Beatles songs. The whole project became some kind of battle for The Brothers; not having major roles and not really getting a chance to act. The script was not good. However working with Beatles producer George Martin was a great thing for the Gibbs. In March the group would start working for the next album in Criteria Studios and they finished it after the Summer holidays. There was some pressure on their shoulders; how were they going to live up to the public’s expectations after all the recent successes!! Also the boys would work for another Andy album and Barry and his good friend David English wrote material this year for a movie which was never released after all. English, the first president of RSO Records, would do some more projects with Barry in the years to come. One of the other projects this year: Maurice produced an album for The Osmonds.\n\nIn May 1978 a press conference was announced with The Bee Gees, Robert Stigwood and David Frost at the U.N. Building in New York to tell about their plans to do something for children in need and the proceeds of a next single they’d decided to donate to Unicef. July 18th. was the premiere of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band at the L.A. Palladium, 3 days later the East Coast premiere took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York. One expected another great success as RSO already dominated the charts in the US Billboard Top 100 at that time with 6 Gibb hits in the period of 1977-1978, however Sgt. Pepper didn’t become that big hit film everyone thought it would become. Only 2 songs charted (Earth, Wind and Fire and Robin with Oh, Darling) In August Molly Gibb travelled to Germany to receive more awards for The Bee Gees. She also flew to Robin in New York together with the kids: Spencer and Melissa to visit the studio of Sesame Street, the fave show of Robin’s children. Robin had agreed in recording for The Sesame Street Fever album. His song Trash was released in October.The first single of Spirits was released in November: Too Much Heaven and the proceeds would all be going to Unicef. The B side: Rest Your Love On Me, also became a hit in the US Country Charts. The horn section from the US band Chicago played on Too Much Heaven as well and in return The Brothers appeared on a Chicago song: Little Miss Lovin’ (The band Chicago were recording their new album in Criteria at the same time the Bee Gees recorded there).\n\nJanuary 9th. The Music For Unicef concert was held at the General Assembly Hall of the U.N. The Bee Gees, Andy Gibb, Olivia Newton John, Abba and many more artists performed for Unicef. With the recording of the concert: A Gift Of Song – The Music For Unicef, money was raised for children in need in 100 developing countries. January 12th. the boys received a star in the Hollywood Walk Of Fame. Also this year more awards came their way and they released their new album in January too: Spirits Having Flown. February 15th. they were the big winners at the Grammy Awards and collected 4 for Saturday Night Fever. In the same month the single Tragedy was released. Meanwhile next to all the Bee Gees work The Brothers continued to do all sorts of other projects, like with Andy’s career and album plans were there for starting to work with amongst others Barbra Streisand, working with Jimmy Ruffin, composing film music etc.etc. In March The Osmonds released their album: Steppin’ Out which was produced by Maurice. The third single of their album was released in April: Love You Inside Out. Rumors started to be published in the press about problems within the group now that they had become so popular and successful but they denied all. In Spring they received 11 Billboard Awards and preparations and rehearsals started for their upcoming Spirits Tour through the U.S. and Canada. The boys were very busy and extremely nervous at the start of the huge tour. Security had never been so extreme. The Brothers, their musicians and the families used a special plane as well during this tour to travel around, a Boeing 707 designed with a beautiful Spirits Having Flown tour logo. A film team made a 90 minutes special for NBC TV of the group during the tour, during rehearsals and relaxing with their families. Tickets for this Spirits tour were sold in front of the venues on the black market and people paid sometimes 700 instead of 15 U.S. Dollars for a ticket. It was crazy and everyone wanted to see them on stage. The tour started in Texas: Fort Worth, June 28 and in August the group took a 3 weeks break to continue again August 27th. in New Haven. After the New York concerts there was a huge party organized at the St Regis Hotel.\n\n(I was lucky enough to be invited too with my friends, as I was touring to many of their concerts for one and a half month: see the special report of the Spirits Tour on the GSI Memory Lane page!, Marion / GSIl)."
