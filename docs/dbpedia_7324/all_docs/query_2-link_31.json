Barry stands next to his mum Barbara who is holding baby Andy. Father Hugh holding an unknown, and sister Lesley holds cousin Mark. The twins Maurice and Robin at right.\n\nAt the beginning of August 1958, the Gibb family set sail for Australia as part of an assisted migration scheme from Southampton, arriving on the 19th Sept 1959 on the \"Fairsea\" (Also aboard was Red Symons, future guitarist of Skyhooks, as well as Kylie Minogue's parents)\n\nAndy was only 6 months old, older sister Lesley 13years, Barry 12years, and fraternal twins Maurice and Robin were 8 years old when they arrived in Redcliffe.\n\nThey lived and visited various houses during their stay on the Peninsula including initially the Orient House flats at Suttons Beach while attending Humpybong School (The twins Maurice and Robin enrolled on 22nd September 1958 but left the same month)\n\nA copy of the complete Humpybong School 1958 register is available for free download the the following link: (The Gibb brothers Maurice and Robin are on page 23)\n\nTheir father Hugh was listed as a photographer on the register and had their initial address as Orient House, at Suttons Beach.\n\nOrient House c. 1980 - Photo from the Moreton Bay Library collection: RLPC-001\\001784\n\nThe house on Tramore Rd was where the Gibb family lived in the last few months of 1958, and played on the front verandah occasionally while the twins attended Humpybong School for the last term of 1958. Sister Lesley attended OLHC school on the corner of Oxley and Anzac Ave.\n\nThe 1956 aerial below features the former home of child prodigy drummer, Smiley movie star and original Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen who lived on Eveline St, and attended Humpybong School for 5 years from 9th March 1953 to July 1958.\n\nFraternal Twins Maurice and Robin Gibb (8yrs 9 months) enrolled at Humpybong School in September 1958 and attended the final term of 1958. Lesley attended Our Lady Help of Christians School (cnr Oxley and Anzac Ave) All 3 brothers then enrolled in Scarborough State School for the full term in 1959. Andy was a one year old toddler in March 1959 while they lived in Redcliffe.\n\nLesley (13 yrs) attended Our Lady Help of Christians School at the corner of Oxley and Anzac Ave in late 1958. Barry mentioned this in an interview and mentions he \"walked half a mile to school\" from his home which by that time they were living at 394 Oxley Ave, before moving to Scarborough in early 1959.\n\nOur Lady Help of Christians School on the corner of Oxley and Anzac Ave.\n\nIn 1959, Brisbane based Speedcar driver Bill Goode, the promoter of the Redcliffe Speedway (located at the Redcliffe Showgrounds) hired the brothers to entertain the crowds at the speedway from the back of a truck during the interval.\n\nIn a letter to the Redcliffe Museum in 1999, Barry Gibb wrote \"The smell of the oil, the noise and the atmosphere was incredible. This was the first public appearance Robin, Maurice and I ever made in Australia. We sang through the PA system and people threw money onto the track, and we met Brisbane's leading DJ and racing car driver Bill Gates, who suggested we call ourselves the BG's and even played our songs on his radio show, \"Swinging' Gates' Platter Chatter\". Hence Redcliffe became the birthplace of the Bee Gees.\"\n\nThey signed a contract on 16th March 1959 at 394 Oxley Ave. (mistakingly written as 395)\n\nThey also lived at 394 Oxley Ave ( as listed on the school register) and then 12 Fifth Ave Scarborough with the boys attending Scarborough State School for the 1959 term.
