        "text": "Barry Gibb shares sons Stephen, Ashley, Travis and Michael and daughter Alexandra with his wife of over 50 years, Linda Gray\n\nBarry Gibb has kept his family close, even while skyrocketing to fame. After marrying Linda Gray in 1970, the pair welcomed five children: Stephen, Ashley, Travis, Michael and Alexandra.\n\nBefore growing his family, Barry formed the Bee Gees along with his brothers Robin and Maurice. Their band had iconic hits like “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” and “You Should Be Dancing” before exploding to fame when they made the soundtrack for Saturday Night Fever.\n\nBarry and Linda's first son, Stephen, was born in 1973. Four years later, Ashley joined the family. In 1981, Travis was born and three years later, Barry and Linda welcomed Michael. Their youngest, and only daughter, Alexandra, was born in 1991.\n\nThe family lived in both Miami and London while the kids grew up but Barry told PEOPLE in 1989 that his kids also came on tour. “I can’t imagine what it is like to be a successful pop star without a family to support you,” he said.\n\nRelated: Barry Gibb's Life in Photos\n\nIn the 1980s, the Bee Gees was embroiled in record company battles that stopped them from releasing albums for eight years, but Barry said that this break was actually a good thing.\n\n“They were the happiest years of our lives because we were raising our kids,” he said. “We were writing and producing songs for other people, which didn’t take up 100 percent of our time.”\n\nNow, Barry is a solo artist who often collaborates with his sons Stephen and Ashley on new music.\n\nHere is everything to know about Barry Gibb’s five children.\n\nStephen Gibb, 50\n\nLinda and Barry welcomed their first son, Stephen, on Dec. 1, 1973. Their oldest took up the guitar at 13 and has been playing since, featuring in the metal bands 58 and Black Label Society.\n\nIn 2013, Stephen, who often goes by Steve, joined his father on his Mythology Tour through Australia and New Zealand. Maurice's daughter Samantha also played with the band.\n\n\"It's a thrill to look left and see Sami and to look to my right and see my eldest son,” Barry told The Australian at the time. “And they are both fantastic.\"\n\nStephen and his brother Ashley collaborated with their father in a big way in 2016, co-writing his album In the Now. Barry told Billboard that he needed his sons' energy to get back into music. “They give me that youth,” he said at the time of the album's release. “They give me that fire.”\n\nIt seems Stephen feels influenced by his dad as well. On Sept. 1, 2020, Barry's eldest posted a photo on Instagram of his parents on their wedding day. “Happy 50th Anniversary to these two crazy kids and happy 74th birthday @officialbarrygibb,\" he wrote in the caption. \"You both continue to inspire and motivate me to be a better man. I could not love you more.\"\n\nStephen has been married to Gloria Levas since 2002, and they have two children: Angus and Nina Gibb.\n\nAshley Gibb, 46\n\nLinda and Barry welcomed their son Ashley on Sept. 8, 1977. He didn’t set out to become a songwriter — most of his life has been focused on tennis — but thanks to his musical family, he’s found success in the industry.\n\nIn 2005, Barry was asked to collaborate on Barbra Streisand’s Guilty Pleasures album, the follow-up to the album Guilty on which the musicians collaborated. The father-of-five brought in both Stephen and Ashley to be co-writers on the new project. Although, according to Billboard, Ashley's only prior songwriting experience was an amateur tune written for a girlfriend in the '90s, Barry was impressed and liked working with his sons.\n\nBarry released his second solo album called In the Now in 2016. All 15 of the album’s tracks were co-written with Stephen and Ashley.\n\n“The album is my opinion of life,” Barry told Billboard in 2016. \"My feelings and my journey with my brothers, and without my brothers, with my parents and without my parents, and with my own family, seeing my kids have their own kids.”\n\nAshley is married to Therese Gibb, and they have a son, Lucas Gibb.\n\nTravis Gibb, 43\n\nBarry and Linda welcomed their third son, Travis, on Jan. 10, 1981. He is a real estate agent in Miami, where he spent some time growing up.\n\nTravis is married to Stacy Bash Gibb, and they have two children: Layla and Liam Gibb. On Instagram, the father-of-two occasionally shares snapshots from his life, like hiking the Appalachian Trail and celebrating his kids' birthdays.\n\nIn 2013, Barry spoke to The Guardian about his new life as a grandparent after years of being a rocker.\n\n\"I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life,\" he said. \"I've got seven grandchildren. I get to re-live watching Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. I spend a lot of hours being happy about what happened to us, because it may never have happened, any of those hits.\"\n\nMichael Gibb, 39\n\nLinda and Barry welcomed their fourth son, Michael, on Dec. 1, 1984. His father named him after his godfather and one of Barry's close friends, Michael Jackson.\n\nUnlike two of his older brothers, Michael didn't follow in his dad's footsteps. He has gone on to act, appearing in movies including Stan the Man and Buddies.\n\nAlexandra Gibb, 32\n\nBarry and Linda had their only daughter, Alexandra, on Dec. 29, 1991.\n\nAlexandra encouraged one of Barry's most iconic pop culture moments. When Jimmy Fallon was a cast member on Saturday Night Live, one of his recurring sketches was “The Barry Gibb Talk Show,” where he played a hairy-chested Barry, and Justin Timberlake played his brother Robin. The sketches always ended with Barry losing his temper and yelling at guests or kicking set pieces.\n\nAshley told Billboard in 2016 that Barry “couldn’t watch it at first,” and wasn’t flattered by the parody. When Fallon invited Barry to appear in a sketch, his instinct was to decline, but Alexandra convinced him to participate. He donned a matching three-piece white suit to match “Barry” and “Robin” and sang the show’s theme song with Fallon and Timberlake.\n\n“When we walked on the set, I could see these guys are pissing their pants, they are so excited he’s in the room,” Stephen told Billboard. “He’s oblivious. He doesn’t get it. It’s adorable.”\n\nAlthough she keeps her life out of the spotlight, she has joined her father at a few events over the years, including his investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2018.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
