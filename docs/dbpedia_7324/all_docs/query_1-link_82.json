        "text": "I must confess I'm a lot more aware of keyboard playing than of guitar, but I've been listening to a few Bee Gees recordings - both live and in-studio, and I've been astounded by how simplistic and bad he sounds. As someone with more than 50 years of experience playing guitar on albums and live, why hasn't his playing improved? He honestly sounds like a hack \"strummer\" rather than a performer on #1 records. Doesn't look like he's ever played electric, so that's interesting. Am I mistaken, is there something more to his playing? I just don't get it.\n\nHa! he has always been a rhythm player, not a lead guitarist.\n\nI don't believe that was ever his focus to be an exceptional guitarist, more a songwriter, followed secondly by performing.\n\nHe has said, along with his brothers, that was their main interest, was writing and producing material.\n\nHe has indeed played electrics, but again, only as a rhythm player.\n\nBarry has also faced having back problems and arthritis in his hands for decades, which may indicate some\n\nof those things you hear and see. Also note, he has always used an alternate open tuning all his life, which is a odd for\n\nmost players.\n\nI'm sure he has never claimed to be a super hot guitar player, nor has he pursued being so.\n\nHe's done pretty well, along with his brothers, even with his playing the way it's been.\n\nedit: I actually learned open D tuning from Barry's playing. Thoroughly enjoyed learning it.\n\nI thought the arthritis might've had a part in it. Still think his playing derails a couple of their tunes. Always disliked his part in \"Fanny\".\n\nI think it's in 'One Night Only' DVD?? he wears an wrist band or is it 'by request' DVD???\n\nI can't recall now, but he actually plays an electric in that 'live by request' DVD.\n\nSomewhere it's mentioned, he liked the thin body acoustic/electrics because they were lighter\n\nand easier to manage with his back problems on stage.\n\nThe open tuning thing is interesting, he's been using it since the late 50's early 60's.\n\nI'd like to know more about how he came to use that particular tuning.\n\nDon't think I've ever seen him use normal EADGBE tuning Ever!\n\nRick Nelson also used open E tuning almost exclusively.\n\nWow, I always dug his guitar playing. Especially on the early stuff. He plays lots of electric rhythm. Good groove. Works for me.\n\nYes, I'm glad you said that, cue my favourite artist......\n\nBrian Wilson, could really play piano, but he is not known primarily for his piano skills.\n\nIn most cases when you hear him play, he uses it as a demonstration as to what and how he wants\n\nthings to go. Even on record, he's more of a 'chunka chunka' player!\n\nThe dude could play, but he will be remembered as a writer, producer, arranger, singer and somewhere down\n\nthe list will be his Piano and early Bass playing.\n\nI see that he played electric on ESP according to allmusic. Listened to a nice acoustic version of \"to love somebody\" on YouTube, the guitar playing was a bit rough but it's obvious he's struggling with arthritis (looks like he can barely move his fingers)\n\nI guess I understand why he started playing for them - it was probably because they wanted to be taken seriously as a cohesive band, not just as a vocal harmony group. On their early records I see Robin was credited with Keyboards and Mellotron, and by having the whole group playing they could appear the equals of the Beatles musically and artistically, rather than a novel fad, and I certainly prefer most his playing to John's rough early efforts. I agree the acoustic moments where they harmonise are brilliant, never meant to knock his ability as a strummer.\n\nI have no idea why you think his playing on this is \"rough\".\n\nTo my ears, it is excellent.\n\nAnd, for what it's worth, I have had only one job in my whole life: I was a professional guitarist for 30 years, now retired.\n\nBarry's playing was just fine. Was he the best? No way! I am sure there are worse players too. The good news is that until this thread I never really thought much about his playing. Probably because it was good enough. I was in high school and a young adult for the BG's really big years and always enjoyed their music. Was it technically perfect? Heck no. But it sure was great to listen to!\n\nI’m not an expert, and I couldn’t recognize if Barry or someone else is playing certain guitar part on a studio recording. When it’s obvious that he’s playing (for instance, during the acoustic medley the Bee Gees always performed during their live shows), to me he sounds just fine (it doesn’t distract me from the glorious vocal harmonies)\n\nAs for why he didn’t improve as a guitarist over the years – I believe this was never his priority. He was more interested of writing songs, playing with his voice (actually – his several voices) and blending it in harmonies, to be involved in the sound production, etc. As far as I know, after the Bee Gees became huge in the 70’s, his vision for the band was they to continue as a strictly vocal trio, hiring the best session players available for their recordings and tours. So obviously he was not interested in perfecting himself strictly as an instrumentalist.\n\nThat said, I think (I might be wrong though) that recently, and especially around his last solo album, he was inspired to play more guitar parts (as far as I remember during the live presentation of the album he played guitar during the whole show, if I’m not mistaken – both acoustic and electric, and quite competently). So possibly these days he’s more interested in the instrument than in the past."
