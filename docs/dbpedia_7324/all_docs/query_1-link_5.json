        "text": "The Bee Gees star Barry Gibb has spoken for the first time about an incident in his childhood when a man attempted to molest him.\n\nThe singer said he has had doubts about speaking about the experience in the past. He told the Radio Times: “I’ve never said this before, Jesus Christ, should I be saying it now? But there was a moment in time when a man tried to molest me when I was about four years old. He didn’t touch me, but other things happened, and happened to other kids.”\n\nHe said that the man was arrested, and described the overwhelming aftermath of the incident. “Four years old and a policeman on your bed at four in the morning, interviewing you,” he said. “If that doesn’t teach you about life, nothing does. But it’s vivid for me still. I’ve never told anybody.”\n\nAsked if the abuse was in the home, he replied: “Those details would be unpalatable.”"
