        "text": "He’s the last Bee Gee standing — but Barry Gibb doesn’t need to pull out the family photo albums to remember his brothers, twins Maurice (who died in 2003 from complications after stomach surgery) and Robin (who succumbed to cancer in 2012), and their youngest brother, Andy, who died at age 30 in 1988 after years of drug abuse.\n\n“I’ve seen Robin since he died,” Barry tells The Post. “You can call it an apparition maybe, but I’ve seen him walk from the front door to the lounge in my house. It was late at night, he was wearing a blue jacket and I knew it was him. There was no fear in it all. I’m comforted by it. Both Robin and Maurice are still there.”\n\nDespite its title, “In the Now,” there are more than a few ghosts haunting Barry’s new solo album — his first recording since the Bee Gees’ final album, “This Is Where I Came In” (2001), and 32 years since Gibb’s other solo effort, “Now Voyager.” After spending years trying to come to terms with his brothers’ passing (as well as the death of his mother in August), Barry’s back in the game. “I’ve made music as far back as I can remember, so what else could I do?”\n\nIt’s no exaggeration, either. Barry, 70, first started playing music with his siblings when they formed the skiffle/rock ’n’ roll trio the Rattlesnakes in England, during the mid-’50s. And eldest Gibb brother Barry was just 10 at the time. They morphed into the Bee Gees, scoring Beatles-inspired ’60s hits such as “To Love Somebody” and “Words.” But with success came heightened sibling rivalry.\n\n“We were after each other’s girlfriends,” says Barry, with a laugh. “One time, we were recording a live BBC broadcast in 1967. There was a really pretty girl from Australia, and Robin was hot for her. I didn’t know. I just walked up to her, but Robin turned around to me and said, ‘Barry, has that boil on your ass gone away yet?!’ That was his way of telling me to piss off!”\n\nThe Bee Gees suffered a downturn in their fortunes during the early 1970s, until their manager and, by then, film producer, Robert Stigwood, proposed they do a soundtrack for a film about a young Brooklynite who works a dead-end job in a paint shop during the week, but dances the weekend away in the clubs of Bay Ridge. Initially, the trio weren’t overly optimistic about the movie’s prospects, but the resulting “Saturday Night Fever” and its soundtrack, which sold 40 million copies, inspired a cultural shift.\n\n“That era was the most colorful time I ever remember,” says Barry of the success of “Saturday Night Fever” and the ensuing disco boom. “I don’t keep in touch with [‘Fever’ star] John Travolta that much, but on my birthday this year, he sent me a video message.” The video had Travolta imitating Stigwood telling the actor how he was going to make him a star.\n\n“It did make him famous, but I think John feels a little like me, in that the success of ‘Fever’ bruised him a little.”\n\nThe Sunday morning hangover from “Saturday Night Fever” still lingers, and the image of the Gibbs as hairy-chested, medallion-wearing throwbacks lives on. For years, Jimmy Fallon even had an ongoing “Saturday Night Live” sketch, “The Barry Gibb Talk Show,” that lampooned Barry’s famous falsetto.\n\n“Everyone has to go through the hazing,” he says. “It’s part of the game. You can’t buy your way out of that.”\n\nDespite the deaths in his family, Barry thankfully has something that’s survived — his 46-year marriage to Linda (they have five children).\n\nThe two married in 1970, and Barry says he’s never strayed, despite the opportunities. “I do remember [Australian tennis star] Evonne Goolagong tried to get me to go out with her about 25 years ago. She asked me if she could come over!”\n\nHis bride also had some temptations, Gibb says.\n\n“One time we were at the Record Plant in Los Angeles and Steve McQueen tried to take off with Linda on the back of his motorbike! She’s a very beautiful woman, and had just as many opportunities as me!”"
