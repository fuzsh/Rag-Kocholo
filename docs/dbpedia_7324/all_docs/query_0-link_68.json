She was the middle of three daughters - Lucille (Gibbens) and Velma (Burrell) who also preceded her in death. Verla graduated from high school and then went to work for the CIA in Washington, D.C. as a secretary. She was extremely homesick so returned to Foosland after a year. Shortly thereafter she went to Chicago to work for the Red Cross where she met her husband of 68 years, Eldon Bullard, who was stationed at Great Lakes. They were married on June 29, 1946 and transferred to Pensacola, Florida where he was stationed as a Marine. After Eldon's discharge from the Marine's, they moved to KC to be near Eldon's family. They then moved to Pueblo, Colorado and from there to Denver where they remained for many years. Verla worked for the State of Colorado throughout their stay in Colorado. She was Public Information Officer for the Colorado State Soil Conservation Board, then as personal assistant to then Governor John A. Love, then ultimately retiring from the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice when they purchased a restaurant in Castle Dale, Utah in 1980. After selling their restaurant, they moved to Grand Junction, Colorado and remained there until they moved to Springfield in 1990 so Joy could finish her Master's Degree in Social Work. They moved to Monett in 1999 and have remained there. Verla always enjoyed \"things that go fast\". As a very young girl, her uncle let her ride in (and sometimes pilot) his crop duster.

Teenage boys who raced her never expected to be left in her dust. She always wanted to fly in a hot air balloon. She had a book published \"Dinner at Noon, Supper at Night\" about her years growing up on the farm in Foosland. Verla always enjoyed \"things that go fast\".
