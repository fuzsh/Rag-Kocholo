        "text": "Born on this day in 1946, the British-American musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer, Barry Gibbs, rose to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the group Bee Gees, one of the most commercially successful groups in the history of popular music.\n\nBarry, alongside his brothers Andy, Maurice, and Robin, rolled through the decades with hit after hit. Fifteen of their tracks enjoyed the number one spot on the charts.\n\nThe brothers delivered classics that will never grow old. But, their success was cut short by the death of Barry's three brothers.\n\nThis left him having to stand on his own, proving that he is a legend in his own right.\n\nBarry went on to perform to large crowds of audiences and embarked on solo tours from the year 2013.\n\nHe has been enjoying success as a solo artist, producing hits such as 'In The Now'.\n\nHear your favourite songs from Barry and the Bee Gees on 1 September between 9am and 10am and again from 2pm to 3pm on East Coast Gold."
