        "text": "He said they \"always avoided it\"\n\nThe Bee Gees brought out so many incredible songs that had has us dancing through the decades. Throughout their music career, brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb gave us hits like 'Stayin' Alive', 'How Deep Is Your Love' and 'Tragedy'. However, one thing the group never did release was any Christmas music.\n\nSome of the biggest names in music have released Christmas songs, including Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen, and we can't help but wonder what a Bee Gees Christmas song would've sounded like.\n\nBarry Gibb has spoken out to explain why the group never released a Christmas album. Speaking to BBC News, he said: “We've always avoided it. I think it was appropriate maybe 50 years ago. These days I think it's too much of a marketing trick.”\n\nThere have been number of artists to bring out Christmas music more recently, like Elton John who worked with Ed Sheeran to create a Christmas song, and Gary Barlow who has released a full Christmas album this year. But it seems like Barry won't be bringing out any festive music as a solo artist.\n\nOther Bee Gee members also enjoyed solo careers, including Robin Gibb who did in fact release a Christmas album. Released in 2006, the album is comprised of traditional Christmas songs. This was also the final studio album Robin ever released before we sadly lost him in 2012. Barry also commented that he had no part in the creation of the album.\n\nThis year, early Bee Gees guitarist Vince Melouney has released a re-recorded version of the Bee Gee's track 'Come Some Christmas Eve (Or Halloween)' as part of the band Tall Poppy Syndrome. This includes a holiday mix of the track, which even includes sleigh-bells and unsurprisingly is quite different from the original!\n\nListen to 'Come Some Christmas Eve (Holiday Mix)' by Tall Poppy Syndrome:\n\nTake a look at these iconic artists then and now:\n\nNow Read:\n\nBee Gees share wedding day throwback pic to celebrate Barry Gibb's birthday and 50th wedding anniversary\n\nGet to know all about 'Stayin’ Alive' by the Bee Gees\n\nKenneth Branagh to direct upcoming Bee Gees biopic\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
