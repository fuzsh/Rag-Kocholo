        "text": "The Bee Gees were a group of three brothers with a distinctive sound: tight R&B harmonies and falsetto vocals. Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb were born in England and grew up in Australia. After a string of hits in the 1960s, the brothers broke up, but then rejoined in 1970. Promoted by their manager and impresario, Robert Stigwood, the Bee Gees ventured into R&B-flavored disco tunes in the mid-70s and hit the big time when they recorded an extremely popular soundtrack album for the 1977 hit movie Saturday Night Fever, starring John Travolta. They had huge hits with “Night Fever” and “How Deep Is Your Love.” In the United States, the album sold 16 million units!\n\n“The Bee Gees were the biggest group in the world,” Barbra Streisand explained. “They had a distinct sound … some great songs with lyrics that were – shall we say – nonlinear. They kind of sounded like the Chipmunks. It was a very unique but pleasant sound.”\n\nHow in the world did a Bee Gee and Barbra Streisand come together?\n\nDuring the success of Saturday Night Fever, Maurice Gibb remembered that the Bee Gees were asked by a reporter which artist they would most like to produce. “We said, ‘Barbra Streisand.’ Then about a week later, Charles [Koppelman] called and said, ‘I heard in the papers that you’d love to do Barbra.’ So, this is how the Barbra situation came about. She said she was very impressed.”\n\nCharles Koppelman of The Entertainment Company, producer of Barbra’s last three albums, saw the pairing of the Bee Gees and Streisand as “making one plus one equal three.”\n\nSo, Streisand checked out the Bee Gees in concert at L.A.’s Dodger Stadium on July 7, 1979 … with 56,000 of their fans! When Barbra was spotted taking her seat in the left-field stands, the audience roared.\n\nGibb’s team was Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. Gibb recorded instrumental tracks at the Bee Gees’ studio (Middle Ear in Miami Beach, which closed in 2006). Orchestral parts were added at Criteria Studio in Miami.\n\nProducer Karl Richardson explained: “We cut the first versions of the tracks at Criteria to take them to Los Angeles so we could capture Barbra singing there, because I believe she was filming a movie at the time. Recording was sort of like a hobby for her at that moment, and we could only get her for so many hours of so many days, originally. So, the decision was to cut the music in Miami, then produce her vocals, then come back to [Miami] do the mix.”\n\nBarry then flew to Los Angeles to record Streisand’s vocals. Gibb estimated that the album took six months of work, with about two weeks of work from Streisand.\n\n“[Streisand] was there a few days while we were working,” said drummer Steve Gadd, who played on all the tracks except one. “She came in to see that all the songs were in the right keys for her to sing. She was very polite and nice – very professional.”\n\n“Barry Gibb’s a real good musician and producer,” Gadd continued. “When we were doing the album, they weren’t talking about making an album. They talk about making a hit record. That’s how they approach it. They put everything under a microscope, and it’s a long process.”\n\nStreisand was used to recording with a live orchestra, but for the Guilty album she sang to Gibb’s pre-recorded tracks.\n\n“Barbra sings something once and it’s magic,” Gibb said. “You can’t cut into it or mess with it because each time she sings it’s good.”\n\n“We could tell about halfway through that we had something very different than she’d been doing and that it could be an extremely big album,” Gibb stated.\n\nAlbhy Galuten agreed. “No question. When she opened her mouth, and we were on the other side of the glass, we were, like, ‘what the fuck?!’”\n\n“As the album progressed,” Charles Koppelman explained, “it became more and more a collective effort between Barbra and Barry. The whole thing kind of evolved into a real team involvement.”\n\n“Working with her turned out to be wonderful,” Gibb confessed. “She wanted my ideas and she gave me a lot of leeway—but she also wanted me to listen to her ideas, which I was glad to do. She was perfectly nice—a true lady in every sense of the word.\n\n“And she was a hard worker. She’d work from 7 a.m. until late into the night—and during the breaks, she’d be working the script of Yentl. But we did have to lock her up when the food came, because she always wanted to eat. We had to keep her away from the food, so she’d keep singing!”\n\nFor the duet, “Guilty,” the production team had to adjust Barry Gibb's vocal. “When we recorded ‘Guilty,’ we’d already cut the track,” Galuten said. “Originally, Barry was not going to do any duets. They talked him into it. So, for his verses, we had to change the key and had worked out modulations to go from one key to another, from verse to chorus, and then overdub the instruments, fit them in, and fly that stuff around to literally create the verses for Barry that were in another key. Wherever Barry sang verses, those were never recorded in that key—they were originally recorded in different keys in different parts with everything but the drums.”\n\n“It took us two weeks to combine the vocal,” Richardson explained. “I spent days in the studio with an oscilloscope and looking at her and the rhythm of the song and moving things in milliseconds because, again, these are rhythmic songs, [sings, emphasizing the beats] ‘and we got nothing to be guil­-ty of…’ and all that stuff. You’ve got to have that nailed. She wasn’t exactly there all the time.”\n\nGaluten added: “Barry’s feeling and his vision is that meter is pretty much on time. There’s a beat and it goes right there. And the same thing with the pitch—you don’t really scoop into pitches, you just…you’re supposed to hit the pitch and nail it. So, in order to adjust Barbra’s vocal so that it met with Barry’s sensibility, we were moving the time—and this was before the days of sampling and being able to move vocals around—with these little tiny offsets and fractions and punch-ins and delays. And doing the same thing with harmonizers to do three or four passes at the beginning of a vocal word so it would hit it right on and not slide up the way Barbra liked to do.”\n\n“I had two machines locking up, and punching a cross-fading machine into the recording machine was a several week process to do that for the entire album,” Richardson recalled. “I had a book of lyric sheets…I think I used a loose-leaf binder that was about six inches thick by the time we got done with the album with all my notes. Every little nuance with ad libs or breaths, because you have to cross them before breaths, and things like that. From a technological perspective, when you listen to Guilty you don’t realize that behind the scenes, a lot of editing was going on.”\n\nThe producers took extra care on the song “What Kind of Fool.” Not originally intended as a duet, they spent months exploring the right balance of Streisand's and Gibb's voices and which lines they would sing.\n\nAlbhy Galuten recalled that “the duets were done after the fact. This record was put together by Charlie Koppelman … It was Barry’s idea to do the record, but it was Charlie’s idea that they should do some duets. Charlie’s probably all along thinking, ‘Barry’s a hot property, we should do some duets, it’ll make the record sell.’ Well, we converted the songs to duets after Barbra was gone. She had already come and sung.”\n\nThe drummer “Bernard Lupe” is credited on “Woman in Love,” “What Kind of Fool,” and “Life Story.” Lupe is not a real person – in the days before digital editing and sampling, engineer Albhy Galuten invented a “tape loop” which was lifted from two bars of the song “Night Fever.” Because their drummer’s father died in the middle of a recording session and they were unable to replace him, the tape loop of his rhythmic drumming was necessary to complete the song. Galuten reused the loop on the Guilty album’s tracks.\n\n“Woman in Love” was first single released from the album. “We and CBS both felt that it was very important for the first single not to be a duet,” Barry Gibb said. “We released the single five weeks before the album to make sure it took hold before everybody was exposed to the combined effort.”\n\nGaluten shared his memories of recording “Make It Like A Memory,” too. “When we were recording the song … there’s a long pause [on the chorus] when she sings ‘make it like a…memory,’ and the downbeat is supposed to be on ‘memory.’ I remember doing the demo, it took Barry, like, ten times to get the vocal to come in on time with the downbeat, because there was no time through there. There was no beat going on. For Barbra, it’s not her natural thing to sing like Michael [Jackson] or Barry rhythmically. In fact, we ended up having to do a lot of fine-tuning and adjustment to get her meter to line up in a way that was, you know, sufficiently rhythmic for Barry. But on ‘Make It Like a Memory,” she did five takes, and on every single one she nailed the downbeat. So, even though Barry has incredible detailed meter and absolute accuracy, Barbra has this intuitive sense of long-time that she knows when to come in based on some aesthetic that is not countable by the rest of us R&B musicians.”\n\nUltimately, the album and its singles were a worldwide phenomenon for Streisand. “Woman In Love” reached #1 in five countries, while the “Guilty” single hit #1 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.\n\nThe Guilty LP went triple platinum in The Netherlands and Canada, double platinum in Australia, and platinum in the U.K.\n\nIn the U.S., the album and single were #1 on the Billboard charts.\n\nStreisand’s Guilty album is her biggest selling album to date — over 5 million units worldwide.\n\nThe original LP package was extremely lush. It had a gatefold design with Mario Casilli's sexy photos of Gibb and Streisand both dressed in white against a white background on the front and back cover. Inside, Columbia included a picture sleeve for the LP with credits on one side and another Casilli photograph on the other.\n\nCharles Koppelman praised Barry Gibb’s work. “He was comfortable in the role of producer, which is one of the reasons everything went so smoothly. If he’d walked in as ‘singer-star’ as opposed to producer, we could have had difficulties.\n\n“You’re dealing with a lot of egos here, mine included. And this wasn’t one song, it was an entire album. But it went much smoother than any of us anticipated. Obviously at times Barbra had some trepidations and at times I’m sure Barry had some concerns. I’m sure Barry was apprehensive at some point that Barbra wouldn’t like the music or that she’d want her vocals too far out and the tracks too far back. I’m sure Barbra at certain times was concerned that she didn’t want a Bee Gee-esque album. There were a couple of rough spots, but everyone knew the potential and wanted to make it work.”\n\nStreisand remarked, “I’ve always looked back on the Guilty album as one of the easiest, most pleasant recording experiences I’ve ever had. Barry just made the process a delight. Maybe because he’s an artist himself, he understands what it takes to be a producer for another singer.”\n\n“I gave myself over completely to Barry’s vision,” Streisand admitted, saying that Guilty was an album “I’m very proud of.”\n\nBarry Gibb stated, simply: “I wanted to produce her best-selling album, and I accomplished that.”"
