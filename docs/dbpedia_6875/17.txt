After stunting with non-stop Taylor Swift since Thursday afternoon, Sun Broadcasting relaunched 93.7 WHEL Sanibel/Fort Myers FL as CHR “Hot 93.7” at 9:00 this morning.

Taking multiple shots at Beasley Media’s crosstown CHR “B103.9” WXKB as being “old and tired” emphasizing the commercial lengths, music choices, and national contests on WXKB, the launch creates a direct format competitor, while also filling the hole created by iHeartMedia’s flip of Hot AC “Y100” WZJZ earlier this month.

The new brand also creates a flanker to sister Rhythmic CHR “Fly 98.5” WFFY against WXKB and iHeart’s Rhythmic CHR “105.5 The Beat” WBTT. WXKB currently ranks ninth in the market with a 3.0 share in the December 2023 Nielsen Audio ratings. WBTT is fifth with a 4.0 share, while WFFY is tenth with a 2.8. The now-defunct WZJZ had a 1.2 share.

The launch of “Hot” follows the move of Country “Hell Yeah 93.7” to translator 94.1 W231DC Fort Myers.
