        "text": "• Beasley Media Group has partnered with Podcast Radio and KMG Networks to unveil a new podcast multiplatform radio format in four regions across the company: Detroit: 93.5 FM (W228CJ) and WCSX-HD2; Tampa: 1010 WJBR-AM (formerly WHFS-AM); Charlotte: 94.7 FM (Fox Sport Charlotte moves to WBAV-HD2) and WSOC-HD3; Ft. Myers/Naples: Now broadcasting on 96.5 FM (W243BM), 101.5 FM (W268AH) & 105.1 FM (W286AK) and WXKB-HD2, replacing Classic Hip-Hop “The Bounce.”\n\nThese stations and digital channels will be branded as Podcast Radio Detroit, Podcast Radio Tampa Bay, Podcast Radio Carolinas, and Podcast Radio Southwest Florida, respectively, and each region’s podcast content will be supported with localized imaging, promos, and ID’s.\n\nPodcast Radio will showcase the very best produced and popular podcasts from the U.S. and internationally, including audio content from TedAudio (TedTalk), Wondery, Evergreen, Corus, and more. The service will also feature live “Podjocks,” including former longtime KROQ/Los Angeles morning co-host/Radio Hall of Famer Gene “Bean” Baxter. This initiative with Beasley is the first of its kind for the company in the U.S., and this unique format will now be offered to radio stations and groups on a network/barter basis via KMG Networks, while AdLarge Media has been selected to facilitate the network ad sales.\n\n“Podcast Radio is an idea that [CEO] Caroline Beasley and our team have been thinking about and researching for years, and we’re excited to be the first to launch this format in the United States,” said Justin Chase, Beasley Media Group Chief Content Officer. “This concept has been highly successful for Gerry and his team in the UK, and we believe our audience will fall in love with the Podcast Radio U.S. version we present on our stations.”\n\nGerry Edwards, Founder & CEO of Podcast Radio, commented, “We are beyond excited to be working with Beasley as a forward-thinking and innovative company. Caroline, the team, and Beasley’s great station brands will make fantastic first movers into the Podcast Radio format as they embrace this unique new radio content as a leader in both broadcast and digital.”\n\nGary Krantz, Founder & CEO of KMG/KMG Networks, noted, “KMG and Podcast Radio is excited to partner with Beasley Media Group to be the first to bring this proven and innovative idea to the U.S. When we evaluated the business opportunity in America, it was their forward-looking team that shared our vision immediately and stepped up to work collaboratively to execute this across key regions within the Beasley Media Group platform.”"
