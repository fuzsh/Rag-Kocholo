I just called them to play LNFSG and they put me on the radio and I got tix to see Queen next month.\n\nUnbelievable. I haven't done this since I was a kid!!!!\n\nOooooh. I am so excited. I was reading this and the stations listed in Houston are \"rap stations\" so I looked up the number for our top 40 station. I just called them to play LNFSG and they put me on the radio and I got tix to see Queen next month.\n\nUnbelievable. I haven't done this since I was a kid!!!!\n\nSee, you got rewarded for your hard work:clapping:\n\nPeople please request Michael's songs on the radio, every little helps.\n\nWe can do help a bit to get this album on radio, and once radio stations think they have audience on MJ fans they will play it.\n\nI did all the Top40 in the US.\n\nAre you sure? I'm not down with giving my name/address/email for a song request or prompted to \"create an account\" for the radio stations' sites.\n\nTime for me to Google 'radio stations in Atlanta that plays Michael Jackson', because I truly don't know. I am my own DJ. :lmao:\n\nYou can use the links on this site: http://rihannadaily.com/www/request/\n\nYou don't have to type anything in the fields at the bottom of the page, except your name (and you can use a fake name if you don't want to use your real name.)\n\nAre you sure? I'm not down with giving my name/address/email for a song request or prompted to \"create an account\" for the radio stations' sites.\n\nTime for me to Google 'radio stations in Atlanta that plays Michael Jackson', because I truly don't know. I am my own DJ. :lmao:\n\nYes im sure. You don't have to do any of those things .. no logging in - No email You just select the song\n\ntype in a first name ANY name .. and submit .\n\nStill keeping busy doing this. Filling in the code takes more time than selecting LNFSG and filling in the name\n\nHa ha yes I know. You can always request a new code. What are rhythmic stations? I've been working on the Pop 40.\n\nTodays to-do-list 102 - 150, minus stations that don't have MJ\n\nYou can still request it even if it's not in the list, just write it at the bottom. Hopefully they will add it if enough people request it.\n\nThere was only a few stations that didn't have MJ, so I didn't want to spend too much time on minor thingy.\n\nWe need to get ourselves sorted out and concentrate our efforts to the area where the numbers are declining. While I wait for info, I'll keep Michaeling - ups requesting"
