Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2016)\n\nTemplate:Infobox Network\n\nRadio Disney is an American radio network operated by the Disney Channels Worldwide unit of Walt Disney Television, headquartered in Burbank, California.\n\nThe network broadcasts music programming oriented towards pre-teens and young teenagers, focusing mainly on current hit music and a heavy emphasis on teen idols; compared to most CHR stations, Radio Disney is far more aggressive in playing only current hits and eschews recurrent rotation.[1]\n\nFor many years Radio Disney affiliated with stations in markets of varying size, mainly large and mid-sized markets; however, by the early 2010s, Disney had begun to phase out the network's affiliations with terrestrial radio stations, and sold its owned-and-operated Radio Disney stations (with the exception of KDIS in Los Angeles) to third-parties, in order to focus more on its distribution of Radio Disney as an internet radio outlet on digital platforms.[2]\n\nIn 2015, Radio Disney partnered with iBiquity to syndicate the network terrestrially via its HD Radio platform, and with iHeartRadio for further digital distribution. In 2017, Radio Disney launched a spin-off service, Radio Disney Country, which carries a country music format catered towards a similar audience. The network also lends its name to the Radio Disney Music Awards, an annual music awards presentation broadcast on television since 2014 by Disney Channel.\n\nBackground[]\n\nDisney had for a long time been involved in the music business, building off its success in movies and TV shows, which later became Disney Music Group. However, with radio, Disney was not committed to the medium only doing a few shows. Radio Disney is Disney's third foray into radio. In late 1955, Walt Disney started The Magic Kingdom radio show—running Monday through Fridays and which was heard on ABC Radio.[3] Even before the 1996 Disney-CC/ABC merger, Disney and ABC Radio considered as early as 1992 planned for a children's radio network but dropped the idea.[4] Starting on July 31, 1994, Disney started a weekend radio show, Live From Walt Disney World, that originated from both Disney World and Disneyland on Radio AAHS.[4][5]\n\nIn November 1995, ABC Radio Networks and Children's Broadcast Corp. reached an agreement for ABC Radio to provide marketing and sales to Radio AAHS. After Disney's acquisition of CC/ABC, Disney had ABC Radio cancel the agreement in August 1996 plus announced the start of its own children's network and ended AAHS's Disney World broadcasting rights.[6]\n\nHistory[]\n\nABC Radio Networks[]\n\nRadio Disney was test launched in November 1996 in four markets, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City and Birmingham, Ala., by ABC Radio Networks. On August 26, 1997, Radio Disney was launched in Los Angeles on KTZN/710.[7]\n\nA nationwide roll out occurred in 1998 with 28 stations affiliating by August 1998 with an expected 63 stations by the end of 1999. Radio Disney purchased KAAM (AM) (Plano, Texas) for $12 million and switched the station to the network in July.[8] In 1998, the network was based out of its Dallas station.[9]\n\nTemplate:Quote box Other than music, the network in 1998 had \"Mickey & Minnie's Tune Time,\" a 2-hour weekday toddler program and two 60-second features per hour which included contests, \"ABC News for Kids\", \"Gross Me Out,\" a \"gross\" facts.[8] The network ran its Radio Disney Project Family Initiative from July 1 to September 15, 2003 with family-themed programming and events to get family to sign on to the Radio Disney Family Pledge.[10]\n\nRadio Disney began being carried by SiriusXM in 2002.[2] Disney entered a joint venture to launch Capital Disney digital radio channel in Britain and operated from 2002 until June 29, 2007.[11] In 2004, Disney paid the former Children's Broadcasting Corporation (which operated fellow children's radio network Radio Aahs) $12.4 million in a lawsuit settlement.[12]\n\n2006 marked the network's 10th anniversary; Radio Disney rebroadcast its first hour of programming from November 18, 1996, on June 6, 2006, at around 4:58 pm. ET on stations in select markets, such as WQEW.[citation needed] Also, as part of the 10th anniversary, Radio Disney held the \"Totally 10 Birthday Concert\" on July 22, 2006, at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, California.[13] It also included a simultaneous live webcast on the Radio Disney website. A second concert was held in Dallas, Texas, on November 18, 2006, at the Dallas Convention Center.[citation needed]\n\nDisney spun off and merged on June 12, 2007, its ABC Radio Networks with Citadel Broadcasting into Citadel Communications while retaining its ESPN Radio and Radio Disney networks and stations.[14][15]\n\nDisney Channels Worldwide[]\n\nOperational duties of Radio Disney were transferred to the company's Disney–ABC Cable Networks Group (currently d.b.a. Disney Channels Worldwide), which otherwise operates Disney's cable television properties, except for ESPN.[citation needed]\n\nIn March 2008, Radio Disney and Gracenotes signed a licensing agreement starting immediately that allow the lyrics be seen along with the song online on Radio Disney Internet Radio Player.[16] The channel began streaming live on iTunes Radio Tuner in August 2008.[17] In November 2008, Radio Disney relocated its main operations from Dallas to Los Angeles.[9]\n\nThe network launched on October 8, 2008 the Next Big Thing feature which allows listeners vote on young unsigned artists' songs to be played.[18] In 2013, the Radio Disney Music Awards began airing on the Disney Channel.[19]\n\nOn February 14, 2011, a Radio Disney Junior block launched in tandem with Disney Junior on Disney block. The hour long block focus on music for the preschool age plus fun \"audio theater\" with Disney Junior characters.[20]\n\nRadio Disney started to reduce it station footprint to the larger markets to make the network more profitable. In January 2010, Radio Disney requested permission from the FCC to \"silence\" five of its owned-and-operated stations (along with a sixth station operating under a local marketing agreement with another company) while the stations were being sold.[21] Disney sold six AM stations and one FM station that year.[2] In June 2013, Disney announced the sale of seven owned-and-operated stations in medium-sized markets, in order to refocus Radio Disney's broadcast distribution on the top-25 radio markets.[22]\n\nOn April 10, 2014, it was announced that Radio Disney's Top 30 Countdown would become a syndicated radio show, distributed by Rick Dees' Dees Entertainment.[23] Aha Radio, Slacker and ShowMobile signed online carriage agreements with the network in mid-2014.[2]\n\nShift to HD Radio and digital[]\n\nOn August 13, 2014, Radio Disney's general manager Phil Guerini announced plans to sell all but one of its remaining owned-and-operated stations on or before September 26, 2014, in order to focus more on the network's programming, co-branded events, and digital outlets. Listenership reports indicated that the majority of Radio Disney's audience listened to the network via satellite radio and other digital platforms, and only 18% via terrestrial AM/FM radio. KDIS remained operational to serve as the originating station for the Radio Disney network,[2][24] while the remaining stations would continue carrying Radio Disney programming until their respective sales were completed.[25] The last five Radio Disney owned-and-operated stations for sale were sold on September 15, 2015 to Salem Media Group (who was the largest purchaser of the stations) for $2.225 million.[26][27]\n\nOn April 13, 2015, Disney announced that the Radio Disney network would become syndicated through affiliations with HD Radio subchannels; the network will be distributed by iBiquity, with ad sales handled by its HD Radio Digital Network unit. A network representative that the move was intended to target families as in-car listeners.[28] On August 6, 2015, Radio Disney was made available for listening on iHeartRadio.[29][30]\n\nRadio Disney Country[]\n\nOn November 4, 2015, Radio Disney launched a country music-focused internet radio station, Radio Disney Country, which was initially exclusive to Radio Disney's own digital platforms. The service focuses upon current songs, current and past material from popular artists, and pop songs featuring country musicians. Guerini explained that the format of the channel was meant to allow it to draw from a wider range of songs than traditional country radio stations, owing to the format's \"embrace\" of rock and pop-oriented songs. The network's launch coincided with the 2015 CMA Awards.[31][32] Like its sister station, Radio Disney Country emphasizes current hits and uses little recurrent rotation.[1]\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Disney announced that it would expand the network's distribution to include other digital platforms, such as iHeartRadio and TuneIn, as well as curated playlists on Apple Music and Spotify, and terrestrial radio with the flip of KDIS to the network as KRDC (the main Radio Disney network continues to be carried locally on a subchannel of KRTH).[33]\n\nProgramming[]\n\nRadio Disney plays a large selection of songs from stars and programs on Disney Channel, along with popular songs from mainstream pop and R&B artists that are found on conventional radio stations. The network airs edited versions of some Top 40 songs (which remove profanity and any other suggestive content) to make them appropriate for younger listeners. The specialized radio format favors music which often takes on a sound reminiscent of \"bubblegum pop\" of the 1960s and '70s.\n\nList of programs broadcast by Radio Disney[]\n\nCurrent programs[]\n\nFearless Everyday - hosted by blogger and entrepreneur Alexa Curtis, is Radio Disney's first show to introduce topics like social media and mental health to listeners.

There are plans to resume broadcasting of a Disney-branded radio station in the United Kingdom, but this time under the 'Radio Disney' brand, aimed at a younger audience than its predecessor in the UK. On October 21, 2010, Radio Disney launched in Brazil. Since October 1, 2013, Radio Disney is available in Russia via Disney.ru.[74] It plans to broadcast in the Philippines and Sweden in the near future.\n\nLatin America[]\n\nMain article(s): Radio Disney Latin America\n\nRadio Disney is available in Latin America via terrestrial broadcast.

On October 10, 2008, Channel 4 withdrew plans to launch 4 Digital, ending the probability of Radio Disney launching on the service.[87]\n\nA similar station, Capital Disney began broadcasting in 2002 on the DAB digital radio network, on Sky Digital (Digital Satellite) and various digital cable television providers in the UK. The station was a joint venture between the UK's Capital Radio Group and Disney. The idea being to use Capital Radio's programming experience to assist Disney in launching a radio station in the UK. In early 2007, both Capital Radio (by now called GCap Media) and Disney agreed to pursue different goals, and as a result, Capital Disney closed down on June 29, 2007.\n\nSee also[]\n\nBubblegum pop\n\nList of children radio networks\n\nCumulus Media Networks (formerly ABC Radio Networks and Citadel Media)\n\nESPN Radio\n\nHip hop music\n\nNick Radio - A similar radio network launched by Nickelodeon and iHeartMedia in 2013\n\nRock music\n\nTeen pop\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nRadio Disney corporate website\n\nFormer DJ Dean Wendt interview, containing info about the early days of Radio\n\nRadio Disney on Sirius\n\nRadio Disney on XM Radio\n\nTemplate:Radio Disney radio stations Template:American broadcast radio Template:Disney–ABC stations\n\nTemplate:Sirius XM Channels Template:SiriusXM Channels (music)"
