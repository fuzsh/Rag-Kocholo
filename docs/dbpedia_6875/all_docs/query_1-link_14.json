        "text": "Post by kani on\n\nhere's the fresh new thread that totally updates the stations. Radio.nenad.net for some strange reason doesn't even update for few years.\n\nThis listing of stations will follow the same basic format as the AT40 shows threads, seen elsewhere on this forum: station call letters, slogan and regularly scheduled time and day of broadcast; all times are Eastern. For right now, I'm not going to list whether there is a live stream of the station, but many of these stations do have that;\n\nRemember that because of individual station circumstances, there may be instances of stations starting the show early or late, at a different time or not at all; the circumstances vary widely.\n\nwww.timeanddate.com is a great site for converting time zones. I list the times in EST (eastern time zones)\n\nI am sorting this in order of day and time starting with Saturday 12AM and to end Sunday/Monday 12AM\n\nEDIT: As of Sat May 6, 2017, www.rick.com will no longer be used for streaming as it has removed audio shows from that site. Instead these shows will be used on the Rick Dees App, but you have to download from iphone, smartphone, ipad, tablet, or any mobile devices. Then you have to create an account for you to listen. It includes Hot AC, CHR, 80s, 90s, D2K (2000s). But sadly no top 20 AC on the app feature. There are some other features: Hit App, etc.. i may have to check on that.\n\nThese shows will update by at least Friday night or Saturday (that really depends how it's scheduled). The app is only for USA viewers, but not for other countries..\n\nKOMC FM can sometimes have issues with buffering or so with tunein\n\n------------------\n\n1980s\n\nKDGL 106.9 The Eagle\n\n3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern Thursdays\n\nTheEagle1069.com\n\nKZOY - Sunny Radio 1520AM\n\nSioux Falls, South Dakota\n\nearly Saturday 12AM-4AM\n\nKOMC - My 100.1FM\n\nBranson, Missouri\n\nSaturdays 6AM-10AM, and repeats Sunday 7PM-11PM\n\nWKVI - K99.3FM\n\nKnox, Indiana\n\nSunday 2PM-6PM\n\nWTKU - Kool 98.3\n\nSouth Jersey's Classic Hits\n\nOcean City, New Jersey\n\nSunday 8PM-12AM\n\nWPNC - Magic 95.9FM\n\nPlymouth, North Carolina\n\nMonday 12AM-4AM\n\nWZYK - 94.9FM The Mix\n\nMayfield, Kentucky\n\ntime is unknown as it said every weekends..??\n\n(no stream)\n\nXEFO - Extasis Digital 680AM\n\nChihuahua, CH Mexico\n\nWednesday 4PM-8PM??\n\n------------------\n\n90s\n\nKFYN - Rewind 103.9, 103.9 FM/1420 AM\n\nBonham, Texas\n\nSaturday 11 AM-3 PM\n\nwww.radiorewind1039.com/player/\n\nstreamdb4web.securenetsystems.net/cirruspremier/KFYNAM\n\nWBEL-AM \"The Beat 92.3/98.9\"\n\nSouth Beloit, IL/Beloit-Janesville, WI\n\nSaturdays 1PM-5PM\n\nwww.mostly90s.com/show/rick-dees-classic-countdown/\n\nstreamdb5web.securenetsystems.net/cirruscontent/AM1380\n\n(for some reason for past 3 weeks including today November 11 2023, it's been pre-empted by football game)\n\nWXCV-FM \"Citrus 95.3\"\n\nHomosassa Springs, FL\n\nSaturdays 3PM-7PM\n\nwww.citrus953.com/ - Stream: Press play at the bottom of the page\n\nMix 96.1 WVLF\n\nSaturdays 4-7PM\n\nNorwood, New York\n\nwww.mymix961.com/personalities/rick-dees/\n\nstreamdb8web.securenetsystems.net/cirruscontent/WVLF\n\n(update: only they're playing 3 hour version, started #31)\n\nKZOY - Sunny Radio 1520AM\n\nSioux Falls, South Dakota\n\nSundays 1AM-5AM\n\nWKYW-AM \"Pop 93.5\"\n\nFrankfort, KY\n\nSundays 8AM-12PM EST\n\npopradioky.com/rick-dees\n\nMix 96.1 WVLF\n\nSundays 12:00 PM-4:00 PM ??\n\nNorwood,New York\n\nKHVL 1490 AM/104.9 FM/94.1FM \"The Hits\"\n\nHuntsville, TX\n\nSundays 3PM-7PM\n\nwww.ilovethehits.com/\n\nice23.securenetsystems.net/KHVL\n\nWCQL-FM 95.9 MHz \"Hits 95.9\"\n\nQueensbury, New York\n\nSun. 5PM-9PM\n\nradio.securenetsystems.net/v5/index.cfm?stationCallSign=WCQL\n\nKOMC - My 100.1FM\n\nBranson, Missouri\n\nSunday 9PM-Monday 1AM\n\nus7.maindigitalstream.com/2718/\n\nWDQN-AM 1580 kHz\n\nDuquoin, Illinois\n\n\"The Big 1580 AM\n\nwdqn1580.wixsite.com/wdqn/programming\n\n----------------\n\nCHR (and HAC together.....)\n\nKEAZ-FM - Z100.7 All The Hits\n\nSearcy, Arkansas\n\nSaturdays 7-11:00am & Sundays 1-4:00pm (EST.)\n\nus7.maindigitalstream.com/2385/\n\nKVFX\n\nLogan, UT.\n\nSaturday's 8:00am. -12:00pm.\n\nwww.utahsvfx.com/\n\nKKOY - Hot 105.5FM Today's Hottest Hits for Southeast Kansas\n\nChanute, Kansas\n\nSaturday 9AM-12:45PM (it may either start early or commercials are very limited..)
