        "text": "MG42 Music is not only a music submission service where we digitally deliver your next single directly to key radio station programmers and DJs, but a GUARANTEED AIRPLAY SERVICE. Does this sound too good to be true? Unlike many others who simply just service your music, we GUARANTEE IT WILL ACTUALLY GET PLAYED! How are we able to do this? MG42 Music has maintained strategic partnerships with radio station owners, program directors and DJs in order to GUARANTEE that your music is not just HEARD by them but PLAYED by them! The strong relationships that we have developed over the years have allowed us to market and promote songs within the radio broadcasting community at all levels (Internet, Satellite, College and Terrestrial Commercial FM Radio) SUCCESSFULLY. As a client of MG42 Music, you can start receiving real radio airplay within the next 48 hours!!\n\nSTEP #1: Review and select the desired package (below) that fits the format of your music. Once your music is submitted to us, we will contact you once we receive it.\n\nSTEP #2: Your music will be encoded with the necessary monitoring companies based upon the type of campaign you selected. This process usually takes 24 hours (excluding weekends) to complete. An official “Going For Adds” date will be assigned for your release (typically within one week after we receive your music), which notifies the radio station programmers of our interest to have your music added to the rotation.\n\nSTEP #3: We will digitally deliver your broadcast-quality MP3 (128 kbps or better) to the station panel you selected for radio airplay consideration on your “Add” date. Your music will also be saved on our servers where radio station programmers will have access to it any time during your radio campaign.\n\nSTEP #4: Our experienced staff will follow-up with the radio station programmers via (both) phone calls and emails to confirm they have your music and are considering it for radio airplay. In addition, an E-Blast of your music will be sent to the radio station programmers one week after the “Add” date as a reminder of your music and to re-emphasize direct visibility and overall awareness.\n\nSTEP #5: You will receive weekly radio tracking reports (BDS / Mediabase or DigitalRadioTracker (DRT) Reports) either on Mondays or Tuesdays depending on the type of campaign selected. These radio reports will include the radio stations that added your music to the rotation, the number of spins you received for the week, total spin count per radio station, and much more!\n\nMG42 Music offers a GUARANTEED radio airplay service at an affordable rate. Start getting radio airplay within the next 48 hours from any of our affiliate’s radio station panels! contact us for more information."
