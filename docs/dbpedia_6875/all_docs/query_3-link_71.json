        "text": "WGCU's long hair is getting clipped, and its classical-music audience will be asked for a down payment on the new look.\n\nThe good news: Those who ante up will get access to 24-hour classical music programming and a palette of other unique stations on digital radio, a relatively new development in broadcasting.\n\nOn Sept. 8, the Estero-based public radio station changes its FM broadcast format to more nationally syndicated interview programs and news deliverers such as the BBC World Service.\n\nLocal talk shows such as 'Gulf Coast Live' and 'Sound Off with Sasha' will remain, but will move to noon to avoid conflict with the national programming schedule.\n\nFamiliar national programs such as 'A Prairie Home Companion,' 'Car Talk,' 'All Things Considered' and 'Marketplace' will remain.\n\nMusic programs will shrink to a nightly jazz show from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. with niche music programs, including ambient-music 'Echoes,' 'World Caf√©' and American/roots music in part of that time slot on weekends.\n\nClassical music, long the mainstay of WGCU, will disappear from the FM broadcast. It will be broadcast instead on an integrated digital signal. On this signal, WGCU will offer classical music 24 hours a day from a Minnesota public radio service known as Classical 24, said Kathleen B. Davey, the WGCU-FM general manager.\n\nHowever, digital signals require the listener to make one of two accommodations:\n\n? 'Stream' the music, playing it via the Internet from WGCU's Web site.\n\n? Buy radio equipment that receives digital signals, a format called by a trademarked name, HD radio.\n\nDavey said numbers were the first deciding factor in the format change.\n\n'We were seeing Arbitron data and looking at listener behavior. It's been about two years ago since we began considering this,' Davey said. 'If you look for the audience for the kinds of program we're going to, you'll find that audience is much greater than the classical music audience.'\n\nShe noted that the ratings said people 'in very large numbers, switch off the radio or turn to another station when ?Morning Edition' ends and the classical programming begins.'\n\n'We did send a listener survey that, among other things, asked whether the listeners wanted more classical music or less classical music,' Davey said. 'About a third of the people who responded wanted more. Two-thirds of the people who responded felt the opposite.'\n\nDavey, who is retiring soon after nearly 10 years as WGCU's general manager, said her public speaking events inevitably turned to questions about additional programming:\n\n'People were asking, ?Why can't I get ?Fresh Air' (a daily interview program the station only runs on weekends now) and Diane Rehm (an interview show), or the BBC programming that is available. ?Why can't you schedule jazz programming earlier ? why do I have to wait till 11 o'clock at night to listen to jazz?''\n\nThe station also studied its fund-raising campaigns since 2000 and found that only 400 of 13,000 pledges came in during classical-music programming, she added.\n\nPledge income from those sources was proportionately the same, she said.\n\n'However, we are well aware we have a solid core of classical music listeners, and we felt we could do this for them,' Davey said of the decision to offer a digital classical broadcast.\n\nWGCU sent the classical-hour pledgers a letter explaining its decision, and offering specially priced digital broadcast-capable radios for about $99.\n\nThose interested in ordering the radios, making comments or asking questions may call the station at (239) 590-2593, or (888) 824-0030.\n\nThe station's Web site also offers a shopping guide of local distributors of digital radios for both home and the car.\n\nWGCU researched buying a second station to keep its classical-music broadcast on the FM band.\n\nBut Davey said the likely cost would have been $5 million, and the only potential prospect in media-rich Southwest Florida said it wasn't interested in a sale.\n\nUpdating its transmitters to carry two HD signals ? the standard FM schedule also will be broadcast digitally ? cost a much lower $150,000. The station received a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to help with that cost.\n\nAmy Tardif, FM station manager and news director, said there are some exciting programs in the FM lineup, including a global call-in from the BBC she was able to sample at an NPR conference, titled, 'Have Your Say.'\n\n'This program takes calls from all over the world. It gets e-mails from around the globe on its topics, and you get an amazing variety of perspectives on the news,' she said. 'Have Your Say' will air 1-2 p.m. weekdays.\n\nAnother show that will begin airing Sept. 8 is 'The Diane Rehm Show,' featuring interviews with newsmakers (9-10 a.m.). Nightly specials will range from the Naples Council on World Affairs lectures to 'America Abroad,' an analysis of U.S. foreign policy hosted by Ray Suarez.\n\nWeekend programs will include 'National Geographic World Talk' and 'Latino U.S.A,' and 'Speaking of Faith,' two perspective programs on Latin and religious news issues.\n\nClassical programming on the HD station will include the seasonal taped concerts of the Naples Philharmonic, the Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra and other live performances. National programs such as 'The Romantic Hours' and 'Pipe Dreams' will move to its HD station.\n\nThe live broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, a Saturday tradition from December through May, will no longer be broadcast, and WGCU, along with a number of other public radio stations, are at odds with the Met because it refuses to allow HD radio to carry its broadcasts, Tardif said.\n\n'We're not really sure why,' she said. 'We've never really gotten a clear answer on that.'\n\nDavey said the classical-music format was the logical candidate for digital-radio broadcasting for another reason ? the same reason, she said, that WGCU tried to move Met broadcasts there.\n\n'With digital it's a very precise signal. It locks in the sound. It's very clear. We have turned our own station on to both at the same time here in our offices and walked back and forth. It's so much better for classical music,' she said.\n\nAlthough there are some audiophile claims that edges are being cut off the broadcast in digital radio, Davey said, 'those are the ones that you don't want. You're getting rid of the fringe sound on either side. The range of the sound that you are receiving really does have some peripheral sound to it, but you don't get that with digital.'\n\nThe expanded programming also will require a bigger budget for WGCU next year.\n\nTardif estimated programming costs to the station will be about $50,000 higher than they are now.\n\n'They're giving us a discount now because we don't have the audience built up for these programs,' she said. 'But next year, yes, we'll have to pay for them.'\n\n___\n\nHow to go digital\n\n? Own a computer? You can receive the signal online free. But your computer must have relatively good random access memory (RAM) and fast transmission via your Internet provider to seamlessly 'stream' the signal online without it being interrupted with 'hiccups.' This may require buying and installing a better RAM chip or faster transmission services from an Internet provider. Cost, without installation, for a RAM chip: $35 to $50 for desktops, $40 and up for laptops.\n\nIf you don't have a music-media player such as Quick Time, Windows Media Player or Real Player, you'll need to install one. They're generally free and can be found by doing a search-engine hunt for those names.\n\nThose who want better sound quality than small computer speakers deliver will need to buy wire that connects the computer to their sound system speakers. Cost: about $8.\n\n? People who don't have a computer will need to buy a digital radio for home use. WGCU is offering a specially priced digital broadcast-capable radio for $99.\n\nThose interested in ordering the radios may call the station at (239) 590-2593, or (888) 824-0030.\n\nThe station's Web site also lists retailers in Southwest Florida who carry digital radios: Best Buy, Circuit City, Radio Shack.\n\nMore than 20 manufacturers, including Yamaha, Sony, Jensen and Denon, now sell tabletop digital receivers at prices from $99 to $399. A South Dakota-based\n\nmanufacturer, Radiosophy, is offering a $50 coupon discount on its $99 combination clock-radio, but that's only available online or by calling (877) 443-7234.\n\n? Crave that Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 on your drive home? A digital-signal receiver add-on (about $100) will bring the signal to a car radio -- or you can buy and install an HD Radio receiver ($99 to $399, not including labor and attachment parts). It is slowly becoming manufacturer-installed equipment: BMW and Volvo now offer it and Ford and Mercedes-Benz will begin to offer it as an option on 2009 models.\n\nEvery car audio store contacted in Naples said it can order and install the radios according to what the customer specifies and what vehicle the customer has.\n\nIf you'd like to limit your search quickly, Charlottesville, Va.-based electronics dealer Crutchfield offers a search by car model. Go to the Web site below, and click 'Shop' under 'Car Stereos with Built-in HD Tuners.' Then click on the button that says 'Please select your car.'\n\nwww.crutchfield.com/hdradio/index.html\n\nThings to know:\n\n? 'FM sensitivity,' which means the minimum signal required for reception, is important. The lower, the better. The antenna is important, too.\n\n? Some digital radios are only iPod friendly; others have inputs for USB plugs, from MP3 players, and-or memory cards.\n\n? A few radios offer integration with steering wheel radio controls.\n\n? Some radios also offer satellite-radio reception, along with AM, FM and HD.\n\nWhat's digitally out there\n\nWGCU-FM isn't staking the first Southwest Florida flag into the digital-radio landscape. Naples-based Beasley Broadcast Group Inc. has carried digital versions of its AM sports radio station, WWCN, since November 2005.\n\nIn fact, as Denyse Mesnik, director of corporate communications for Beasley, pointed out, Caroline Beasley is chair of the NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) HD Radio Technology Advancement Task Force. Beasley is executive vice president and chief financial officer of Beasley Broadcast Group.\n\nBeasley Broadcast Group added digital broadcasts of its classic-rock station, WRXK-FM, and Top 40 station, WXKB-FM, in January 2006. In April 2007, it created several unique-programming digital stations:\n\n? Solid Gold 106, carried digitally by the signal for its adult standards FM station, WJPT-FM\n\n? Haney's Big House, an eclectic rock station, on the frequency that carries WRXK-FM.\n\n? The Beach, a reggae-focused station on the frequency that carries WXKB-FM.\n\nSan Antonio, Texas,-based Clear Channel Communications also has added specialty programming in HD Radio format locally:\n\n? Amy, an 'oldies and party music' broadcast from the last 20 years on the same frequency as adult contemporary WOLZ-FM.\n\n? The Jazz Club, jazz classics on the same frequency as its smooth jazz WZJZ-FM.\n\n? Even easy-listening fans have one digital station here: WAVV-FM.\n\nRadio stations with HD Radio signals are required to broadcast as its first digital signal the exact program of the FM or AM station it is being carried with. Broadcasters can offer alternative programming on the second digital signal they can attach to the station; those often take the suffix HD2. Digital technology allows a number of digital signals to be easily added to an FM or AM signal because digital signals require only 1 percent of the bandwidth that the standard signal requires.\n\nThese young HD2 stations typically serve local music or niche markets with fare such as comedy-routine formats, bluegrass, trance, ambient and classical music, trucker tunes, classic country and gospel.\n\nMost of these stations also can be streamed on the Internet.\n\nOne of the incentives for the music industry to love digital broadcast is that its compact signal can also carry data. This allows a variety of text displays, from traffic jam warnings to stock tickers to the name of the tune being played. Apple Corp. has already contracted with the developers of the HD Radio format to incorporate a 'tagging' feature that not only scrolls the name of the piece on the radio screen, but allows the listener to press a button that adds the song to a list. The list can be downloaded to an iPod for possible purchase."
