Nielson Audio compiles and reports audience estimates for all radio stations in its surveyed markets, subject to its minimum reporting standards. The estimates for all reported stations are available only to Nielson Audio Radio Market Report subscribers.

Noncommercial radio stations that are authorized users through the Radio Research Consortium and that meet minimum reporting standards will be displayed in PPM markets. Noncommercial radio stations will not be displayed in Diary markets. Please contact the Radio Research Consortium at (301) 774-6686 or RRC@rrconline.org for information about authorized users.

The subscriber list is based on information available to and processed by Nielson Audio at the time of publication. A subscribing station may not appear if it recently changed its call letters or band, or if it was off the air during the recent reporting period.
