Here the story of Jan Hofmann, Executive Director at UBS in Singapore (SG). USI Degree: Master in Financial Communication, 2006 and 4-years degree in Communication Sciences, 2002.\n\nHow did you start your career?\n\nI started my career back in 2006 as part of the Graduate Talent Program (GTP) which allows graduates with no professional experience to jumpstart their career by working in different parts of the bank through a rotational program and valuable networking opportunities.\n\nWhy did you choose a career in UBS?\n\nI choose UBS as it was (and still is) the leading private banking globally. The opportunities for internal mobility that such a large international institution offers was also a key determinant for my choice.\n\nWhat is your current role/duties?\n\nManaging the relationships of some key clients of the bank and providing them with financial advice to protect and grow their wealth.\n\nIn your opinion, what are the qualities necessary for a successful career in UBS?\n\nFlexibility, self management and initiative, internal networking, resilience.\n\nWhat positive aspects and qualities meant most to you during the study programme you attended?\n\nMulti-disciplinary curriculum, culture of innovation and personal contact with the professors.\n\nWhat competences and/or skills acquired in your USI Study Program have been useful/are useful to your professional career?\n\nThe USI study program helped me developing big picture thinking which is crucial in business today.\n\nWhat is your advice to USI students entering the job market?\n\nNever stop developing yourself and learning new skills given how fast-moving and competitive the current job market is."
