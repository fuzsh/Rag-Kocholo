        "text": "What I do: As chief of marketing at Spacebase, I spread the word about our meeting- and workshop-venue platform to as many meeting and event planners as possible. Our online booking website is based on a person-to-person marketplace, and the more people we get using our service, the better it becomes for renters and space providers alike.\n\nHow I got here: During my time as a business consultant, I spent around 200 nights a year sleeping and working in hotels. These boring, dusty meeting spaces were all the same, and I slowly began to realize work didn’t have to be that way. My friend and now co-founder Julian Jost was as tired of these outdated and unstimulating meetings as I was, so we teamed up to found Spacebase in 2014 and harnessed sharing economy power to put creative, inspiring meeting and workshop spaces on the market.\n\nImpressive stats or numbers I’m responsible for: Over the last year, Spacebase has quadrupled the number of bookings. We’re excited people are using our service more and more, transforming into loyal believers in creative meetings.\n\nWhat I’m working on: We want to keep our growth rate increasing in the German market and stay true to our commitment to Spacebase users. We also plan on expanding our presence in the United States and offering more meeting rooms stateside."
