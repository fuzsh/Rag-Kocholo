        "text": "This article highlights the importance of generic and thematic competences when translating commercial texts. It focuses specifically on the relevant theoretical framework for international marine cargo insurance and the genres produced within any claim procedure. The aim is to inform translators about the situational context and the documents involved when loss or damage to goods is incurred, and thus enable a greater command of the subject matter and tenor of discourse. Also highlighted is the importance of understanding the standardisation of words or expressions used in International Trade and Maritime Law with English as the lingua franca, together with the need to apply the correct translation strategies for the final purpose of the translation.\n\nCement is primarily product to build massif infrastructure while Indonesia was experiencing shortage of production since last decade. Due the situation, cement projects were rampant in period 2008-2015 to anticipate further surprise demand. However to build a new cement plant is quite difficult due to high cost of logistics. In this paper, four projects of Indonesia stateâ€™s owned Semen Indonesia at Java and outside Java were examined to explore total logistics cost contributed by sea freight and domestic section. According this research total logistics cost came from foreign source was 6.464% while domestic contribution was 1.363% against total investment cost; however limitation of infrastructure contributes 27,129% against domestic path."
