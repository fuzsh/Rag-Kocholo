        "text": "Two heavyweights of German television and film are uniting.\n\nNico Hofmann and Jan Mojto are teaming with Jan Wünschmann, a producer at Mojto’s company Beta, to create films and TV series in Germany and Europe. Projects will be targeted at the international market.\n\nHofmann, was the longtime boss of German production giant UFA, and Mojto said they are “connected by half a lifetime of producing” title such as TV event series The Tunnel in the early 2000s and newer series such as Generation War, Dresden, The Tower and The Same Sky.\n\n“Jan Mojto and I have been close colleagues and friends for more than 20 years – our eye for programming, uncompromising quality, and passion for our profession unites us,” said Hofmann. “It is the next logical step in my career to join forces and produce together with Beta Film. The individuals and their creativity are the building blocks for a long-lasting bond.”\n\n“This partnership is the fulfillment of a long-held wish,” said Mojto. “Nico Hofmann is one of the best German producers; He is a gifted storyteller. His professional and personal qualities, which I have known for more than 25 years, are the ideal foundation for many projects to come – stories for Europe from Germany. I am happy to accompany Nico Hofmann in this endeavor.”\n\nAt UFA, Hofmann is known for series such as Deutschland 83 and its follow-ups and films including box office hit All About Me. He was CEO of the Fremantle owned production company between 2017 and 2023, but stepped back in September last year to become chairman.\n\nMojto, who was born in Slovakia, has been working in production and distribution for more than 40 years, primarily in the German and European markets. He took over Munich-based Beta in 2004 (then Beta Film). The company makes or sells shows such as Babylon Berlin, The Swarm, Sisi, The Sea Beyond and Gomorra. It began life in 1959 the control of Leo Kirch."
