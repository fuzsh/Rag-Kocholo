        "text": "I am an Associate Professor at Carnegie Mellonâs Computer Science Department, and a member of the Principles of Programming (PoP) group and CyLab.\n\nMy research areas are programming languages and verification. My mission is to discover beautiful mathematical ideas that have a real-world impact, shape the way programmers think, and help to create software that is more reliable, efficient, and secure. Currently, I am working on quantitative verification, type systems, static resource analysis of programs, probabilistic programming, and programming languages for digital contracts.\n\nBefore joining Carnegie Mellon, I was an Associate Research Scientist in the FLINT group at the Department of Computer Science at Yale University. Before that, I was a PhD student at LMU Munich. My advisor was Martin Hofmann."
