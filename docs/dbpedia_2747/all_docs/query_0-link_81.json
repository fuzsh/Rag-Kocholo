        "text": "People make a thousands of judgments and decisions every day, such as deciding which meal to eat for lunch or judging how much one likes a new acquaintance. To make these judgments, people need to combine and integrate several pieces of information, such as the price of the meal or its visual appeal, into a global evaluation. My research aims to undercover the cognitive underpinnings of these inference processes. In doing so, I draw upon key insights from memory and learning research and incorporate those insights into psychologically informed theories of human judgment that provide testable, quantitative predictions. In future, this work hopefully allows us to better understand which knowledge people retrieve in every-day decisions and how they integrate this retrieved knowledge with information from the environment."
