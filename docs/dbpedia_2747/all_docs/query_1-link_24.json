        "text": "STOMPING GROUNDS\n\nI’m originally from Freiburg, Germany, but I’ve spent 12 years Dubai – that’s basically most of my life – and went to school at the Dubai American Academy. I now study in Germany, but UAE is still home.\n\nGAMES GET REAL\n\nWhen I was 12, a friend of mine got introduced to skateboarding through the videogames by professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, and ended up getting his own skateboard. One time, when I went over to his place, I tried it out and I simply had to get my own [skateboard].\n\nSKATING BY\n\nThe skateboarding scene in the UAE is a family – it’s very small compared to other big cities, but I guess that’s what gives it its coherent attributes. On a weekends, you’ll find me hanging out at the X-Dubai skatepark at Kite Beach or Deira Fountain close to the Union Metro Station. When I’m in Germany, I take the train and go to Bremen or Berlin – two of the best cities to skate in Germany.\n\nOLYMPIC FLAME\n\nI guess there are positive and negative aspects to the fact that skateboarding will be an official sport at the 2020 Olympics. Skateboarding for me is a freedom of expression, not a sport with rules and that’s what makes it cool – you can do it whichever way you want. Obviously, [being in] the Olympics will help skateboarding grow and companies will profit. Personally, I’m just going to keep skateboarding and see where it takes me.\n\nFOOD FEUDS\n\nWhen I’m not skateboarding or at university, I enjoy cooking or just sitting in a cafe and drinking a cappuccino. I love whipping up veggies and fish. Or else I hang out at my friend’s place and nick his chocolate.\n\nWARNING: INJURIOUS\n\nSkating involves the risk of getting hurt and I’ve been hurt a few times. My dad is cool with it but my mum’s always scared that something [bad] might happen. Every time (which thankfully isn’t too often) I come home with an injury, she gets mad.\n\nFUN FACT\n\nBefore my family moved to Dubai, I lived in Bangkok and drank Fanta out of plastic bags – that’s how they serve soda in Bangkok.\n\nMOODY MUSIC\n\nThe kind of music I listen to depends a lot on my mood or the state of mind I want to get into – I listen to hip hop to get hyped, RnB to relax, and a lot of Brooklyn Radio or Jenkem Mag (a skateboarding magazine) mixes for the daily routine.\n\nDROP-DEAD STUNTS\n\nThe craziest stunt I performed was a trick for the waterpark project that I worked on with Red Bull and involved skating on a slide at Aquaventure at Atlantis The Palm. One false move would have seen me plummeting 50 metres down onto the ground covered with stones. But I pulled it off and the photo of that trick got featured on the cover of Irregular Skate Magazine in Germany.\n\nWILL POWER\n\nThe motivation is what gives me all the energy I need to skate. There’s no other fitness or exercise trick. You just have to really want to go skate, then the energy is there.\n\nTRAVEL TESTS\n\nIf I had the time and money, I’d jet off to Sydney this weekend. I’ve always wanted to visit Australia and go [scuba] diving in the Great Barrier Reef and skate the bowls there. But right now, I’m doing exams at university, so the weekend’s probably going to be spent cooped up in the library. After the exams I’m off to Copenhagen, though!\n\nHEAD OVER WHEELS\n\nMy skateboard is my most cherished possession, so it goes everywhere I go. Releasing my Welcome to the Team video for my collaboration with Robotron Skateboards and Cleptomanicx clothing was one of the proudest moments of my skating career. I got my own Pro Board after that.\n\nI’M INSPIRED BY\n\nI’d love to spend a day chatting to Erick Winkowski – he’s a skater I’ve looked up to for years.\n\nSTRANGER THAN FICTION\n\nIf I could live a fictional character’s life I’d pick Spongebob. His life seems cool; chilling in a pineapple all day and flipping the occasional burger in the Crusty Crab. Who wouldn’t want that?\n\nWEIRD AND WONDERFUL\n\nI have skated in some really unique locations thanks to Red Bull. I skated at the Leipzig Football Stadium here in Germany a few weeks ago, which was also pretty cool!\n\nSECRET LANGUAGE\n\nSkating has its own unique culture and lingo. When we [skaters] say ‘sketchy’ it actually means landing a weird trick and ‘steez’ means a performance with style."
