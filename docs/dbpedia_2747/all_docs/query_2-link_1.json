        "text": "Jan Hoffmann started at four consecutive Olympic Winter Games, 1968-80, carrying the East German flag at the 1980 Lake Placid Opening Ceremony. In 1968 he was only 12 years, 111 days old to become the youngest male participant ever in Winter Olympic history (through 2018). At the 1972 Winter Olympics Hoffmann placed sixth, while in 1976 he was fourth and in 1980 won a silver medal. Hoffmann was World Champion in 1974 and 1980, was runner-up in 1977 and third in 1973, 1976 and 1979. At the Europeans, he was champion in 1974 and 1977-79, runner-up in 1980, and third in 1973 and 1976. Domestically he was East German Champion in 1971-74 and 1976-80, and runner-up in 1969-70. Hoffmann later became a member of the international jury, and was also a board member of the German Skating Union (DEU). He trained in medicine and practiced as an orthopaedic surgeon near Dresden."
