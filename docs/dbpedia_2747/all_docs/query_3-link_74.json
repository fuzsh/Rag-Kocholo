        "text": "BAY CITY, Mich. - Three members of the Northern Michigan University men's soccer team have been honored with All-GLIAC recognition, announced by the league on Thursday. Tommaso Lami, Philipp Rimmler, and Jan Hoffmann were the Wildcats to receive the recognition.\n\nCoach Alex Fatovic: \"Very pleased to hear the announcement on Tommy, Phillip, and Jan for All-GLIAC. Although we didn't achieve our main goal of a GLIAC championship, these individual accolades are well-deserved and further demonstrate our ability to bring in top-level talent to NMU as all three players were in their first year at NMU. Although I believe a few of our guys left out deserved a shout, these three were clear-cut selections, and we are very excited for them and the program.\"\n\nTommaso Lami - Freshman of the Year and First Team\n\nFreshman Tommaso Lami was recognized as the GLIAC Freshman of the Year as well as being placed on the GLIAC First Team. Lami was an essential recruit for Head Coach Alex Fatovic and made an immediate impact on Northern Michigan's program in his first season. Lami's eight goals and 19 points are each top-three marks in the conference and the best totals for freshmen. From Bologna, Italy, he played and started in all but one game for Northern Michigan.\n\nCoach Alex Fatovic on Lami: \"Tommaso, like many of our first-year players, has made an immediate impact both in our attack and our press. Tommy was a no-brainer for freshman of the year, even though we felt we had at least 3 other candidates in Baruc, Dylan and Jan. Tommy is a natural goal scorer that can beat you in multiple ways, but what separates him from the rest is his willingness and desire to defend, track back and get stuck in. Tommy has a bright future ahead, and we can't wait to help him develop into the player we know he can be. Great Job Tommy!\"\n\nPhilipp Rimmler - First Team\n\nPhilipp Rimmler was new to the NMU program this season, transferring from Wright State. From Gr√ºnstadt, Germany, Rimmler made his presence known in the midfield all season, helping lead and guide a young Wildcats team and playing both effective offense and defense. Rimmler played in each game fort NMU, scoring twice on the season and adding an assist.\n\nCoach Alex Fatovic on Rimmler: \"Phillip is a top-class central midfielder that has finally made his mark on college soccer. After a couple of years at D1 Wright State, Phillip came in and made an immediate impact on our young team right away. Phillip has all the tools you want in a central midfielder; technical ability, vision, can finish, athleticism and lastly, he has such a passion for the game & for getting better, I only expect him to improve on this season and to help put us in a position to win the GLIAC. Great job Phillip!\"\n\nJan Hoffmann - Honorable Mention\n\nIn his first year for the Wildcats, Hoffmann demonstrated excellent ability as a defender that can not only stop an opponent's push into the attacking third, but step up into the offensive attack for the Wildcats. The native of Windhagen, Germany scored twice this season while adding an assist.\n\nCoach Alex Fatovic on Hoffmann: \"Jan is another top-drawer player that to be fair is hard done by not being selected 1st or 2nd team GLIAC. Jan is a great defender, but what's important to us in our outside backs is that he is a threat for us on the attacking side every time he receives the ball. Jan is fast, technical, and has a wonderful understanding of the game at a high level which also brings an elite level understanding of how to carry oneself at the highest level. Jan has instantly become a dependable team leader, and we expect Jan to be a perennial 1st team all-GLIAC player for the next three years. Great job Jan!"
