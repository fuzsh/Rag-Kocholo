        "text": "EU’S SUFFOCATING ART IMPORT CONTROLS AND RISKS OF CULTURAL ISOLATION For once, the EU has decided to follow the Italian example and issue. Regulation of Import of Artworks that will certainly strangle the EU art market. Under the wonderful excuse of preventing money laundering through art traffiking (and forgetting that art traffickers just move looted artworks across the borders without asking any permission to anyone…), the EU issued a suicidal Regulation that request importers to become experts of the art export laws of any country of the world (even if no longer in force), to provide evidence relating to past transactions and exports that is in most cases impossible to find and to make declarations that may lead to criminal prosecution and seizure of the artifacts. And this will apply not only to imports of artifacts being acquired outside the EU, but even to temporary imports for exhibition. While the effect on trafficking is highly uncertain (crminals tend not to request permission, I am afraid), nobody sound of mind will try to important artworks or other artifacts in the EU. Thus, expect a patetic art market and very poor exhibitions of old artworks or antiques. Cultural isolation is our future.\n\nTuesday 7th November 2023 will be a significant date for #globaltrade with The People’s Republic of China as the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents (a.k.a the Apostille Convention) officially enters into force. The Apostille Convention facilitates the use of public documents (including documents issued by #notaries) in contracting party countries. A simple #Apostille certificate issued by the designated Competent Authority replaces the often time consuming and costly process of having documents #legalized at the Consulate or Diplomatic Mission on the destination country. With the accession of China, the Apostille Convention now has 124 contracting parties. It will continue to apply in Hong Kong and Macao. China has designated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as the Competent Authority to issue apostilles to documents in mainland China. The upshot of this development for businesses in the #uk with interests in #China is that it will no longer be necessary to obtain legalisation at the Chinese Visa Application Center. Instead an Apostille issued by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office will be sufficient for a public document emanating from the UK to be accepted in China. De Pinna LLP, Notaries, has been further informed by the Chinese Visa Application Center in #London that it is no longer accepting applications for legalisation with effect from 1st November 2023.

The economic order that ensued after World War II made economic isolation impracticable. Both the vanquished and the victors sought to rebuild their economy and international trade was pursued with increased fervour. Also. the global south's political landscape shifted with the rise of independent third-world countries at the end of colonialism. Before its end, international trade was facilitated through trade treaties such as the US Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation concluded with both developed and developing countries alike. However, these FCN treaties left much to be desired in the protection of investments. The establishment of commercial relations was primary in these treaties which left out enforcement mechanisms. This left investors to seek redress through heavily contested customary international rules, espousal of their claims to their home state or diplomacy. FCN treaties soon faded out of use as the need for a separate investment framework arose. However, newly independent countries were not altogether welcoming of foreign investment, particularly foreign direct investment which required the control of foreign-owned commercial establishments by foreigners with physical presence in their countries. It would seem that colonialism was taking another form. Capital importing states shut their borders to FDI and what followed was a widespread expropriation and nationalisation of foreign investment on the back of Article 2(2(c)) of the UN Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Calvo doctrine. Nevertheless, foreign investment remained a need in the global south for commercial growth while the north required protection measures. Invariably, BITs rose to the needs of both parties. It protected foreign investments through standards of treatment, particularly, arbitration as a means of dispute resolution and enforcement of these standards. It provided a neutral ground for Investors who had little faith in the domestic justice system and the host state who perceived the same of the public international justice system through the ICJ under FCN treaties. The establishment of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in 1966 cemented whatever crack may be anticipated in the gradual acceptability of international arbitration. So, the more BITs with arbitration clauses, the more potential for international arbitration. As of today, according to UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) International Investment Agreement Navigator, 2423 BITs in force have arbitration provisions. That's a huge number of potential disputes and the need for international arbitrators. PS: The first 15 states to ratify the ICSID convention were African countries. PS: Won L. Kidane's The Culture of International Arbitration is a gem! #arbitration #internationalarbitration #research #ADR\n\nICCA International Council for Commercial Arbitration Congress 2024 in Hong Kong is well underway. Stopping off at the Wolters Kluwer booth, it was a great pleasure to spot the Stockholm Arbitration Yearbook 2023 on display. The 2023 issue of the yearbook covers 18 Chapters, including Natalia Petrik’s and my article \"Paving the Way for Justice: Arbitration and EU Sanctions Against Russia” which delves into the landscape of EU sanctions against Russia and their implications on arbitral institutions and arbitrators. In this chapter, Natalia and I have summarized the legal and practical effects of the sanctions regulations, shedding light on a number of aspects relevant to the administration of disputes: ✅ Scope of EU sanctions ✅ Asset freeze ✅ Derogation related to payment for legal services ✅ Claims arising from arbitral and judicial decisions ✅ Payments due to listed parties under arbitral decisions ✅ 'No claims' provisions ✅ Reporting obligation ✅ Payment of deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 ✅ Exemptions for services ensuring access to justice ✅ Exemptions for legal services in contentious matters If you are at ICCA, have a look in the next coffee break or find the issue available here: https://lnkd.in/d_9Hyu86 #StockholmArbitrationYearbook #InternationalArbitration #EUSanctions #Russia #LegalInsights"
