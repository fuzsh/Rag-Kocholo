        "text": "Nigma Galaxy, the esports division of MENA entity Galaxy Racer, have appointed Jan Hoffmann as their new head of operations.\n\nIn his new role, Jan will be responsible for all operational aspects of Nigma Galaxy.\n\nJan brings over 10 years of experience in the esports industry ranging from media, production, pro play and management, to Nigma Galaxy.\n\nHe joins the esports organisation from UK esports organisation Rix.GG, where Jan was CEO. Rix are expected to make an announcement on who will be replacing him soon.\n\nPreviously, Jan was at Fnatic, where he was head of team operations and was responsible for leading organisation-wide esports operations. In this role, Hoffmann also handled all internal, organisation-wide operations for two years before his departure.\n\nBefore he was appointed head of team operations at Fnatic, Jan progressed his way up the organisation from manager and coach to team director of Fnatic’s League of Legends team.\n\nUK esports organisation Rix.GG, a subsidiary of X1 Esports and Entertainment, last September announced that Jan Hoffmann was promoted to Rix.GG CEO after founder Jamie Lewis stepped down.\n\nIn his new role at Nigma Galaxy, Hoffmann will be responsible for all organisation-wide operations. He will oversee the org’s pro teams operations, ensuring that the teams have all they need to compete at the highest level. He will also be responsible for all wider Nigma Galaxy operations, which entails nearly everything from HR, logistics, financial planning, coordinating with the departments to project management together with the operations team.\n\nLooking ahead, Jan’s focus will be to develop and build on some of the new projects, including Nigma Galaxy’s efforts in supporting women esports such as the CSGO team or their new Mobile Legends: Bang Bang team in Indonesia.\n\nJan Hoffmann, head of operations at Nigma Galaxy, said: “I’m very happy to announce that I have joined Nigma Galaxy as head of operations. Nigma Galaxy is a world-class esports organisation always striving to be the best and to replicate and build on the success they already had in the past.\n\n“Working with this experienced group of esports veterans is incredibly motivating and fills me with excitement for the things we have in store.”\n\nChristoph Timm, co-founder of Nigma Galaxy, commented: “We are excited to welcome Jan to Nigma Galaxy. Jan’s immense experience within the industry will be essential as we continue to grow and strive for success. Welcome to the team, Jan!”"
