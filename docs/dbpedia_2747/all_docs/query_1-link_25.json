Invention has become second nature at Amazon, and the pace of innovation is only accelerating with breadth of our businesses expanding. Amazon’s growth requires leaders who move fast, have an entrepreneurial spirit to create new products, have an unrelenting tenacity to get things done, and are capable of breaking down and solving complex problems. The AIM, Planning team within SCOT comprises of S&OP, Inventory Prediction and Entitlement and Long-Term Capacity and Topology Planning. The team's charter is broad and complex and aimed at optimizing the utilization of fulfillment facilities and resources by accurately predicting demand and inventory efficiency measures while reducing stockouts and excess inventory costs across planning horizons, from short-term (within 13 weeks) to the long-term (13 weeks to 5 years). The team's north star is to be the reliable, single source of truth for inventory units and cube demand at granularities ranging from an FC’s bins to overall network level, and across planning horizons as close as next week to as far out as 3-5 years. To get there, we enhance or re-develop models and mechanisms where existing ones fail to account for structural shifts in supply chains, buying programs, or customer behaviors. We create new systems where science-based recommendations are currently lacking and being replaced by heuristics and offline human goal-seeking approaches. We strive to completely eliminate non-scientific interventions in our forecast guidance and capacity recommendations, and replace them with a system-driven outlook to uncover underlying root causes when departing from SCOT plans and recommendations. We institute authoritative and economics-based framework missing today to drive inventory efficiency measures for Retail buying programs (short/long-lead buys) and FBA plans that solve for capacity constraints in the most economical manner across horizons.
