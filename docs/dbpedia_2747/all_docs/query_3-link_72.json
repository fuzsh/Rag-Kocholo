        "text": "Welcome to the 151st episode of the Shipping Podcast! Listen to Jan Hoffmann, Chief, Trade Logistics Branch, Division on Technology and Logistics, UNCTAD.\n\n“Technical development will never be as slow as today”, says Jan and continues to speak about digitalisation and decarbonisation as the two main global trends that we need to follow right now. It leads to a structural change which will bring automation and transparency to the shipping industry and that will make us more resilient for the future.\n\nHe is also speaking about things that have changed due to Covid-19 and that more people have been given fruit for thoughts by the pandemic. Our behaviour has changed.\n\nHe continues to point out the fact that it’s not export of products that have been affected, it’s the service industry that has been hit by the lockdown. Export of services, what can that look like?\n\nRemember to read Jan’s blog about his haircut in countries around the world. You find it at www.janhoffmann.live where you also find a lot of other tidbits."
