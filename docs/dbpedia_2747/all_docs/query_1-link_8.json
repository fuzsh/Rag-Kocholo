        "text": "Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nThis fall, Jan Hoffman, who covers addiction for The New York Times, traveled to wooded encampments in Kalamazoo, Mich., where syringes littered the forest floor. She was there to report on the rise of “polysubstance use,” the simultaneous use of multiple drugs. Often, people who are addicted to one illicit substance, like methamphetamine, become dependent on another, such as fentanyl, after taking a laced drug. As one doctor told Ms. Hoffman, polysubstance use is yet another prong of the “addiction crisis” in the United States.\n\nMs. Hoffman set out to explore the lives of those in the chokehold of multiple drugs, and to show the humanity others might not see — a woman’s fierce maternal instincts keeping her cravings under control, for example.\n\nWhen Ms. Hoffman is interviewing someone, she said, she always leaves “opportunities for things you can’t predict.” She explained her approach and process in an interview, which has been edited and condensed.\n\nFor your article, one woman, Rachel, said, “I like to be up and down at the same time.” How do you decide which people and quotes to include to capture the full breadth of a situation?\n\nI spoke to a lot of people for the story in Michigan, a lot of patients and professionals, both there and in other parts of the country. I believe in overreporting. I don’t mind doing the work, I love it, but it is hard for me to let go of so much information. Rachel’s full backstory, for example, is jaw-dropping.\n\nOne of the reasons I talk to so many people is because I am always fact-checking. When Rachel said “I like to be up and down at the same time,” I needed to hear other people in similar situations express something similar. I wouldn’t have picked that line if I hadn’t heard this same sentiment expressed in different ways.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
