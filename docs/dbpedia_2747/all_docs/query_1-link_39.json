But what exactly do they mean? When talking about revenue, how do these parameters relate to the business? How are we going to deal with them in current volatile times? All of these intriguing questions were answered in a recent chat with Prof. dr. Bram Desmet, CEO of Solventure. Bram brings 15+ years of experience and a deep understanding of the aforementioned areas to the table. We discussed a variety of subjects, including Supply Chain illusions, breaking down departmental walls, redefining job tasks, and showing Finance the door for the first time. He also described his own story as a young graduate who had no idea what his next career steps could be and always strived to follow his heart and passion. This was not just an interview, but also a glimpse into the mind of someone who has committed his life to learning and comprehending the supply chain world.

This blogpost is about Wolfgang Lehmacher, the former Director, Head of the Supply Chain and Transport Industries at the World Economic Forum and President and CEO Emeritus of GeoPot Intercontinental. Recently I got a chance to meet this dynamic leader in person at Frankfurt International Airport, for an interview that didn’t feel like one. From reminiscing about his interest in supply chain networks in his childhood, to sharing his success stories as a corporate and thought leader in the sector and beyond, he provided deeper insights into his personal journey and what it means to be a leader. And believe me, when I say that, every moment was enlightening. I'm eager to share the knowledge and wisdom he imparted to us. I wish to bring more of these conversations to you as I go along, let me know what you think!#WEF, #FutureOfBusiness, #LeadershipInsights, #CEOInterviews, #SupplyChainExperts, #InnovationInBusiness, #BusinessTransformation, #GlobalLeaders, #Sitaretalks, #SupplyChainSummit, #WarAndSupplyChain, #COVIDChallenges, #SupplyChainTransformation, #AIinBusiness, #ExecutivePerspectives, #IndustryLeadership, #StrategicManagement, #BusinessResilience, #NavigatingChange, #LeadershipJourney, #ThoughtLeadership, #CEOConversations, #SupplyChainTrends, #DigitalTransformation, #AdaptationStrategies #podcast"
