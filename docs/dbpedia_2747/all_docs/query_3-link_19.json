        "text": "This is a big thing for the Vans German team and with a person like Max Pack at the helm, you know you are going to get some good shit. But what about the behind-the-scenes? Leon Moss did a lot of the heavy lifting in Berlin. So we turned to some of the riders and asked them to turn on their friends, unfortunately, most of them remained cordial üôÅ\n\nLeon Moss tells all about his friends\n\nAbout Roland Hirsch\n\nHirschi has been on Hitachi-airlines since the first fusion festival in 1997. Frequent flyer miles because he keeps blasting airs!\n\nAbout Julian Ruhe\n\nJulian Ruhe‚Äôs allergy-collection is bigger than his bag of tricks.\n\nAbout Kalle Wiehn\n\nKalle Salzburg is so German that he named his dog after a German potato dish.\n\nRoland asking about Roland (Hirsch)\n\nYou had some surprising tricks in this video, did your move from Emerica to Vans open up your bag of tricks?\n\nThe Switch Frontside 360 I had done before years ago. I did one Marocco over a hubba, and it just fit. but yeah, I don‚Äôt do that trick that often, I keep forgetting about it (laughs).\n\nThe Pole-Jam Pressure Flip was another surprising one!\n\nThat one just just happened. I sort of flipped like that on some of the shove it tries. I did a shitty Pole-Jam Shove-It and ended up going back for a better one. I landed the shove one fast, and figured out that if I put my foot in the pressure flip position before I pole jam that I could flip it. Once I figured that out I rode away a few tries later.\n\nYou went on a trip with Vans to Hamburg, who surprised you the most on that trip?\n\nSchianta (Daniel Lepori)! He is so quiet, so nice but all of a sudden he will just bust out something crazy!\n\nWhat about Max Pack, how is he as a TM?\n\nMax Pack, is the best TM and a good soul!\n\nKalle Wiehn Versus?\n\nMax Pack vs Leon Moss?\n\nSimilarities are more easy to find that the differences, they both inject beer into the session and make it fun.\n\nWho is your favorite team mate?\n\nJulian Ruhe or Joscha ‚ÄúBonez‚Äù Aicher but I don‚Äôt see him as often especially since he moved to Barca! To be honest Julian really needs a raise in pay, he has been ripping so hard lately (laughs)!\n\nJulian Ruhe about Leon Moss\n\nLeon is always motivated to get a clip and won‚Äôt ever give you the feeling that you‚Äôre taking too long to get the trick!\n\nHe also has a very strong opinion on which trick could look cool on which spot, and he isn‚Äôt shy, he will give you that extra creative input as well!\n\nHe seems to know exactly what trick each skater could or should do at the spot, he definitely has a vision.\n\nThank You, Coach!\n\nMaxi Schaible about his brother Niklas Schaible.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to say except that when we are together people say: ‚ÄúOh I didn‚Äôt know he was your brother‚Äù (laughs)!\n\nJoscha Aicher about Max Pack.\n\nMax Pack a.k.a. Max Zapf is one of my best homies. We traveled and skated many spots in many different countries. I would like to say that we pushed each other to become better. The difference being, he focussed on filming and I focussed on skating! It is great that we both ended up over at Vans. Even though we only really see each other on tour, we still talk just about every day and our friendship remains a deep one. I am really happy about all that he accomplished and support him to the fullest, I know he poured his heart into it! The only thing he has to learn is how to drink for real!\n\n‚ÄúEr hat noch nie richtig GEZAPFT!‚Äù\n\nJoscha Aicher about Max‚Äôs drinking skills.\n\nHerzlich Willkommen to the video that goes with PLACE YOUR FLAG a special publication of Place Skateboard Culture (in finer shops now). This project is special, not only because it deviates from our ‚Äúregular‚Äù numbered editions in size, because it has animation or the number of pages but because somebody proposed it to us.\n\nYou see, normally our we come up with the ideas but this time the credit for the ‚ÄúStartschuss‚Äù has to go to Moritz Alte. Moritz or Mo came to us because he felt we needed to do something that included Vans team rider, Julian Ruhe.\n\n‚ÄúHe felt we needed to do something that included Vans team rider, Julian Ruhe.‚Äù\n\nAfter a short pitch, he presented us with a plan, which we then together finetuned into the thing you hold today. A series of papers with ink on it about young people, leaving their ‚ÄúHeimat‚Äù and finding their place in Berlin.\n\nIt all sounds great, skating in Berlin, following 4 people and a dog as they find their place in their new surroundings but the thing is that Mo proposed to do all this during the winter and early spring months. Puffy jackets, low light, grey skies, and snowy Berlin, not sunny, hip, drinking beer and hanging out until 23:00 at a Sp√§ti Berlin.\n\nMoritz proposed a young crew consisting of Steffen Grap, 21 (photographer), Peter Buikema, 23 (filmer) and himself, 22 as (an overseer and writer) we liked the idea but felt we needed something more so we added a Brittish ex-pat Jack Taylor, (26) to do a part of the graphic work.\n\nThe question we had was: ‚ÄúIs a 22-year-old ready to do the heavy lifting it takes to make a print issue work?‚Äù Well the results speak for themselves don‚Äôt they, it took some time, it took a lot of energy but it came out great, different and that was what we were looking for. because Berlin can be a lot of things but in the cold it is mostly a beast of burden, whereas in summer it can feel like a balloon, lifting you up. Working the beast, might not be easy but it can be rewarding. There are clear benefits like the lack of tourist people around, fewer skaters at the more famous spots and fewer distractions all around by open airs, protests, and kick-outs because winter is mostly about staying in.\n\n‚ÄúIs a 22-year-old ready to do the heavy lifting it takes to make a special issue work?‚Äù\n\nTo wrap it up, a lot of people talk a good game about moving to Berlin but you haven‚Äôt truly been here unless you have been through a winter so look at what we together created and make up your mind firmly if you really want to Place your flag in Berlin soil.\n\nSpecial thanks go out to Vans ‚ÄúOFF THE WALL‚Äù for supporting this project.\n\nEditorial lifted and adapted from the print issue of the new PLACE YOUR FLAG issue of Place Magazine. Text by Roland Hoogwater.\n\nSometimes you just can‚Äôt express yourself in a language that is not your own, sometimes things are best expressed in your native tongue. The jokes, the customs, the tones, and your culture are all cropped together in the way we speak. I mean how would you express the loss of 3 days of footage in your own language? Kurva, Scheisse, Merde, Godverdomme, Caralho or maybe just a simple FUCK!\n\nAnyway, our friends from Munich made it work and we are dropping this just in time to give them their slightly belated birthday wishes! Congratulations on turning 6 and we hope that the shop and the teams will stay as Bayrish as SHRN needs to be!\n\nIntro by Roland Hoogwater.\n\nText by Mixen.\n\nPhotos by Biemer.\n\nJawoi!

We just got back from CPH Pro‚Äô17, and for the most of us, it was actually the very first time. While we were on our way to the capital with the world famous mermaid and probably the biggest and coolest contest in the world, we got a call from Henning Tapper (Cleptomanicx TM) asking if we would be interested in releasing their latest tour article. The answer was clear, although we did not even saw the video or any of those photos. It‚Äôs a trust thing and if you know that Niklas Speer von Cappeln, Jan Hoffman, Tjark Thielker, Benjamin Vogel and Dennis Laass went on a trip to a huge skate park that looks like Copenhagen, you better put all your trust in it. At this point, we do not even have to start to explain how crazy the architecture is. Watching the video, those guys did not even go to all the famous spots. Having David Lindberg as a spot guide and filmer was definitely helpful as well, but the rest was the pure power of having a smart community with very open minded people and no fear of including all the different urban subculture genre; instead of leaving us alone and building ‚Äústop skateboarding‚Äù signs. Copenhagen does it the right way and so did the Cleptomanicx team with this film.\n\nJan Hoffmann with a FS 180¬∞ fakie Nose-wheelie Flip out. Yeah, it‚Äôs not a skate park.\n\nDennis and Tjark; looking for options, we presume.\n\nEven while playing baskteball Dennis would not leave his board alone. The Team plus TM.\n\nAll photos by Friedjof Feye.\n\nSkateboarding is about many things, mostly it is about the skateboarder and his skateboard interacting together. This interaction begins with you learning to stand on the board, pushing, ollieing, shoving the board, nollie, fakie, switch or normal stance. Some learn faster, some slower, but the objective is the same; ‚ÄúStay on the board.‚Äù This article is not about that, this is about getting off the board (and getting back on afterwards), walking or running with or without, maybe even away from the board.\n\nToday we offer you a step by step analysis (lmao) of some of the most influential skaters who got off the board.\n\nA Different Route.\n\nRight off the bat, we start with two of the most classic walks caught on tape! At the same time, both Jason Dill and Louie Barletta use walking to get somewhere or to walk over something they could not get to by staying on the board. Louie‚Äôs might be a little more eccentric because not many people skate terraces like he did, but still, both these guys made a lot of people get off the board.\n\nJohn Motta uses the same principle but instead of picking his board up and taking it with him, he chooses to leave it and jump on the next one. A technique, mostly used by filmers, while filming long lines, with a lot of ups and downs like stairs. Normally I‚Äôd go for the pickup but doing it John‚Äôs way creates a little more suspense about what is about to come next.\n\nCruising To The Spot.\n\nI am not totally sure if Mike V just got back from an injury here or if he just has that much pent up punk rock Aggression, but Mr. Vallely does deserve his props for this ‚Äòpowerful cruise through the city‚Äô style line! He manages to push skateboarding by keeping it true to his style of skating, whilst at the same time doing tricks that every skater would like to do, while going from one to another spot.\n\nVincent, on the other hand, seems like he just came from the corner store where he bought a soda, and on his way back, he noticed he could flip his board in there. Probably the most relaxed walk of the bunch, which contrasts quite nicely with Mr. V‚Äôs spurt.\n\nThe Bail To Pick up a.k.a. The Never Give Up.\n\nThis is a more recent phenomenon, ever since iPhone filming became an everyday thing, skaters started to worry less about wasting tape and thus happy accidents made it into our collective memory. The reason why we like this style of walking is because it makes everything seem so much more spontaneous, it reminds us of skating around with the homies, instead of the sometimes tedious process of perfecting things in front of the lens.\n\nThe Hop Off, Hop On.\n\nThe Hop off and Hop On is a method perfected by one of today‚Äôs most influential skaters: Mr. Kevin Rodrigues. He has a knack for wall riding, no comply flipping or throwing down his board (to hippy jump) and moving into the next trick. The great thing about this combination is that everybody can join in, just remember: the most important thing is the rhythm of your walk! Hesitation can sneak in and ruin an otherwise great line.\n\nThe Mid Trick Walk Along.\n\nTo be honest, a lot of these moves seem to come straight from a Louie Barletta, who should be on everybody‚Äôs favorite skater list by now. Go watch his parts and you will notice that the only difference is that these tricks are done in a serious manner, instead of with a weird hat and a Rod Stewart track. Anyway, you have to find the right trick and spot (a long slide) to do this but if you do the possibilities are endless.\n\nWalk The Line.\n\nThis one doesn‚Äôt really need any explaining, does it?\n\nWalking as a mode of skating.\n\nA fancy way to say that walking can be the actual main dish instead of a side order that only add‚Äôs to the meal. Case and point CK1‚Äôs stroll on these metal arm rests, imagine him replacing that walk with a series of hippy jumps, it wouldn‚Äôt be the same right?\n\nThe Stop Walk And Roll.\n\nThis is the only section that doesn‚Äôt involve the board moving before hand, it is the simple idea of placing your board somewhere (very high in this case) and jumping on it. Most skaters use this to test out spots but very few use it as a means to an end, which it can be in the right hands. In our opinion, this is the little brother of the caveman nosegrind that Andrew Allen popularized a while back. We say little because everybody can try this one at almost every spot.\n\nThe Walk Home.\n\nFor the older skaters amongst us, this is a pretty common thing. You need to wrap up the session because your significant other wants to home and the baby needs to be fed, time to go, leave the board and take a walk home."
