        "meta_description": "Beyond the Galaxy by Klaus &quot;Cosmic&quot; Hoffmann, released 01 January 2016\n\n1. Beyond The Galaxy\n2. The Gate Of Lahore Part 1\n3. Howling Wolves\n4. The Gate Of Lahore Part 2\n5. Wanderers Of Time\n\n‘Beyond the Galaxy’ was the first CD from the German electronic musician Cosmic Hoffmann originally released in 1999. Klaus Hoffmann-Hoock had already debuted under the pseudonym Cosmic Hoffmann with ‘Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind’ in 1976.\r\n\r\nDespite the long gap in between, the idea of Cosmic Hoffmann has always shone through in Hoffmann’s other musical enterprise, the highly successful and internationally acclaimed ‘Mind Over Matter’ band that released nine albums on Germany’s IC label and which was regularly featured on various compilations. Hoffmann has invited various guests to help him realise his musical visions. On ‘Beyond the Galaxy’ Ron Boots and Stephen Parsick add their distinctive input.\r\n\r\nKHH’s music is an exploration of the free-roaming and heavily psychedelic form of electronic music of the early 1970s. Cosmic Hoffmann follow the way once paved by groups like Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream and Ash Ra Temple. Cosmic textures from Moog Synthesisers and the Megatron, a digital Mellotron created by Hoffmann, are densely interwoven with his guitar and meditative elements of far-eastern music, elements that have always had a great influence on Hoffmann’s music from the beginning.",
