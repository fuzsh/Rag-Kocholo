        "text": "The 2004 Detroit Pistons are the only team in NBA history to win a Championship without a Hall of Famer.\n\nEvery team in the history of the NBA, which began in 1946, has had a Hall of Famer on their roster except for the 2004 Detroit Pistons.\n\nIn 2004, the Detroit Pistons won an NBA Championship without a Hall of Fame caliber player. That had never happened before, and it hasn’t happened since.\n\nNo matter how many different ways I type this, I don’t feel like you’re going to get the full impact of how much of a historical anomaly the ’04 Pistons are. They weren’t just a weird Championship team. They weren’t just unexpected Champions. They are, to this date, the least likely team to ever win a title. Historically, the odds of them winning that title were so small that it’s still unbelievable that they did. I don’t mean “astounding” or “impressive.” I mean that everything in the history of the NBA, which is 73 years old, dictates that they shouldn’t have won. The formula “winning team must have at least one Hall of Famer” is 72-1 in the NBA Finals. 72-1! That’s a 1.39% chance of winning for Detroit. If I went back and offered you the chance to bet $20 against the Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals, and you didn’t do it, you’d be a complete moron.\n\nYou’d also have my $20.\n\nNot all playoff systems are created equal. There are a few Super Bowl winners without Hall of Famers (will this happen to the 2017 Eagles?). Global soccer doesn’t have a Hall of Fame; I don’t know if any global team sports do. College sports, which already have tenuous connections to their various Halls of Fame (if they even have them), frequently produced Sean May type champions. The single-game elimination format occasionally results in this outcome, just by a combination of injuries, bad luck for the best teams, and good luck for the mediocre ones. Sometimes, one bad call swings an entire game and thus an entire season. Sometimes, Eli Manning throws an insane pass to David Tyree, a man who didn’t catch a single NFL pass after that one. You can’t predict every single game in any sport, which is why Eli Manning might make the Hall of Fame. Sometimes stuff just happens. Sometimes it happens for Eli Manning in two separate years, and then he makes the Hall of Fame. Eli Manning! What can you do?\n\nThis is why I think a series-based format, though not realistic for every sport, is preferable in attempting to determine the best team in every given year. Nowhere is this MORE apparent than the NBA, where no team without a Hall of Fame caliber player has ever won a Championship. It’s not always the case that the best regular season team wins or that the most impressive playoff team wins, but the team that DOES win, no matter how good they seemed or how they performed prior to the Finals, always, always, ALWAYS has a Hall of Fame caliber player. There are no Sean Mays here. You have to earn your Championship over four seven-game playoff series. Of course, there’s room for error with everything. Injuries happen. Bad luck happens. Shady officiating happens. But, even if the team that seemed the most deserving doesn’t win, an undeserving team NEVER wins. There’s always a team with a player so great that he is will go to the Hall of Fame holding the Larry O’Brien trophy at the end.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about washed up Hall of Famers riding the bench chasing a ring. I’m not even talking about Hall of Famers as role players, like Karl Malone as a Laker. Every NBA Champion has had a Hall of Famer as their best or second best player at the time of their win. At no point has a team won the NBA Championship without a Hall of Famer somewhere in their prime.\n\nAlthough it’s not technically intended to be, the Finals MVP provides a mostly reliable index for who a Champion’s best player was. There are exceptions because the Finals MVP is specifically designed to reward the player who played the best in the final series. Sometimes, someone who isn’t the team’s best player outperforms everyone else in that series (like when Tony Parker carved up the Cavaliers in 2007). Sometimes, a team’s best player underperforms and essentially plays himself out of contention (like when Larry Bird had back-to-back 8 point games in 1981, giving the Finals MVP to the more consistent Cedric Maxwell, who should have won it anyway for being a Niner). And sometimes, the NBA just gets cute with it (like when they gave it to Andre Iguodala in 2015 for guarding Lebron, which, to be fair, wasn’t entirely unreasonable given that Lebron submitted one of the most impressive one-man performances in Finals history). Still, overall, it’s a pretty reliable way to see who led any given team to a Championship.\n\nLet me be clear here. I’m talking about EVERY Championship team, all the way up to the present day Lakers (setting aside Kawhi Leonard’s Raptors for now, which I will address at the end of the post). Players have to be retired for at least three years before they become eligible for the Hall, but this rule applies to every single team, including ones whose players are still active.\n\nAlthough that may seem suspect initially, it’s actually not particularly controversial when you go back and look at the Championship teams. Just to give us a substantial sample size, every NBA champion this century was led by obvious Hall of Famers. It seems like something you might want to argue about until you actually go through the teams. Here’s a list of the players who were the best on a team that won a title this century (again, setting aside the Raptors): Shaq, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Garnett, Kobe, Dirk Nowitzki, Lebron, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant. Not a lot to discuss here. All of those men are either already in the Hall of Fame or indisputably bound for it. And if you go back into the 90’s, you’ll find that those players have all already been inducted.\n\nWhat’s more, these men were almost all Hall of Fame bound when they won their titles. As a general rule, Hall of Fame players have to pay their dues and establish themselves before they win their first Championship (Giannis is going through this right now). Of course, many players play themselves into the Hall of Fame by winning a bunch of titles (like Dennis Johnson). But it’s not as many as you’d think. Of the players on that list, which again covers this entire century, all of them had already won a regular season MVP or were the reigning MVP when they won their first Championship except for Dwyane Wade, who was playing with former MVP Shaq. These were men who were well on their way to induction before they got their titles. I mean, there are only nine of them. You could argue that some of these men were actually the second best players on their Championship teams (particularly the Spurs, who played pure team basketball), but that isn’t in contradiction with my larger argument, which is that all NBA champions have a Hall of Famer as their best or second best player.\n\nWell. All of them excepppppttttttttt.\n\nSo what happened with the ’04 Detroit Pistons? Let me briefly address the unlikely objection that someone on that team is a future Hall of Famer. Even given how easy it is to make it into the Hall of Fame, none of the players on that roster have a shot. Who was their best player? The Finals MVP was Chauncey Billups, and rightfully so, but he never even made an All-NBA First Team (and only made the Second Team once). The player with the strongest resume (and that year’s overall playoffs MVP) is Ben Wallace, a four time Defensive Player of the year and four time All-Star. He also never made the All-NBA First Team and, to my surprise, only led the league in rebounding twice. But it doesn’t matter. Both of them have been Hall eligible for at least six years and counting. They all had a shot in 2018, a weak year that saw Vlade Divac and Sidney Moncrief making it, and they didn’t make it. Their probabilities go down every year as new, deserving players emerge.\n\nTellingly, the probability-based list of “next in line but won’t make it” that I researched includes two other players from the ’04 Pistons: Rasheed Wallace and Rip Hamilton. This gets to the heart of what was so anomalous about that team. It’s more than just the fact that they didn’t have a clear number one player. It’s that none of their possible number one players were of the caliber of ANY of the number one players on ANY other Championship team in the nearly 75 year history of the NBA.\n\nHere’s an explanation of how they managed to win a title despite that from a glowing retrospective article about the team: “It was a perfect team for a perfect time, one that couldn’t be duplicated in its own era and certainly not in the age of ‘Super Friends’ aligning to wreck the league…a superstar-less team that wasn’t any less complete than any of its predecessors, successors or peers. Time hasn’t diminished the Pistons’ standing as the most surprising champion in modern NBA history. They were a bunch of castoffs, players who’d been passed around, skipped over and dismissed by other organizations who managed to come together in Detroit — bonded by collective failures, mischaracterizations and a maniacal competitiveness that looked like arrogance wrapped in resilience.”\n\nThat’s the nice way of putting it. Here’s what Bill Simmons said in his essential The Book of Basketball, after calling Billups the best player on that team: “Billups led the ’04 Pistons during a discombobulated season when the rules swung too far in favor of elite defensive teams who made threes and limited possessions. Plus, the Shaq/Kobe era completely imploded that season, with half the team embroiled in ‘I’m not talking to that mothafucka anymore” fights…and yet they still could have won the title if Karl Malone hadn’t gotten hurt.” (Like everyone else, Simmons is unclear on who the best player on the team was, calling Billups the leader here and elsewhere saying Wallace was the ’04 playoffs MVP.)\n\nWhat Simmons alludes to (in part) is the NBA’s decision to legalize zone defense as of the 2001-2002 season. This resulted in what is generally agreed to be the century’s most boring stretch of NBA basketball. The 2003 Spurs/Nets Finals was one of the least watched in NBA history. The Pistons and Spurs, both elite defensive teams, thrived in this era, but the NBA did not. Immediately after the Pistons won the ’04 title, the NBA changed the rules for enforcement of hand checking in hopes of leveling out the playing field for offenses and making basketball watchable again. But for that 2-3 year window, elite defenses had a significant advantage.\n\nThat’s how the Detroit Pistons managed to win their title with a roster that lacked a Hall of Fame player. It had never happened before, and it hasn’t happened since. And I don’t know if it ever will.\n\nPostscript:\n\nI started writing this post three years ago. To my great surprise, the Toronto Raptors won the Championship in 2019, and that’s caused me to reevaluate my argument. Kawhi Leonard is an exception to my general rule that the Hall of Famers on title-winning teams in this century have already been well on their to induction. Although he had a robust resume after winning the title last year (2 Championships, 2 Finals MVPs, 2 All-NBA 1st Teams, 2 Defensive Player of the Year awards), he is far from a lock. Like Dennis Johnson, he is a player whose career needs to fully unfold before we can say for certain if he’s worthy of induction.\n\nAnd I think he was well on track…but then he went to the Clippers. By voluntarily joining the NBA’s most doomed franchise, I think Leonard has put his entire career (and, more importantly, my argument) in jeopardy. Whether he believes it or not, he has year after year of playoff let-downs ahead of him in Los Angeles. He will not win a title with the Clippers. They will roll into every playoffs looking solid and then embarrassingly underperform, probably missing *another* potential epic showdown with the Lakers in the process. If his career numbers stay around where they are per game, he’ll need another Championship to have a Hall of Fame resume (unless he plays for an unusually long time). He was All-NBA First Team in 2016 and 2017, but there’s a good chance that doesn’t happen again.\n\nAnd he will NOT win a Championship playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. It will never happen. So, although he is a great player and could definitely end up making the Hall, he is the biggest threat to the validity of my argument going forward. In fact, I think him ruining his career by going to the Clippers is a bigger threat than any of the ’04 Pistons making the Hall. So, you know. Get it together, Kahwi. My blog post NEEDS you."
