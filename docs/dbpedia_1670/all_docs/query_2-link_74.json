        "text": "The former Detroit Pistons, Chauncey Billups, made some waves this week talking bout how he should be in the NBA Hall of Fame.\n\nScrolling through social media. I see a graphic and a quote from, former Detroit Pistons PG, Chauncey Billups on Allen Iverson going to the NBA Hall of Fame and not himself.\n\nIll admit, Im Pistons Fan and I think the world of Chauncy. So I wanted to make sure I wasnât being biased. Lets dive deep into his numbers and accomplishments\n\nChauncey Billups by the numbers\n\nChampionship Material\n\nLets look at the major accomplishments first. The biggest feather in Billupâs cap is his 2004 Finals MVP. What is known around âMo-Townâ as the 5 game sweep. Chauncey absolutely could not be stopped by the, NBA darling, Lakers. Torching whoever Phil Jackson decided to put on him and pretty much ending Gary Peytons career.\n\nLook at this stat line for the series: 21 points, 5.2 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 1.2 steals. As well as shooting 50.1% FG, 47.1% 3PT, and 92.9% FT! That is impressive no matter who you are.\n\nRegular Season\n\nThe Pistons were never a one man team. So for Billups to put up a lot of numbers really wasnât going to happen. Look at him more of the Tom Brady of the team. Tom isnât a fantasy stud because he doesnât always put up gaudy numbers. But who else would you rather have leading your team?\n\nChauncey was voted to the NBA All Star team 5 times from 2006-2010. Who can forget â06 when the Detroit Pistons had the best record in the league. 4 Pistons made the all star team that year. Tayshaun Prince being the only starter left off the All Star roster. When all 4 Champion Pistons came in that game they completely changed that All-Star game.\n\nVoted to the NBA all Second team in 2006 and Third Team all NBA in 2007 and 2009. The league finally started to âput some respect on his nameâ\n\n3 Point Shooting\n\nBefore Steph Curry, Mr Big Shot was dropping in 3âs like no one in the league.\n\nBillups has the most 3 point FGâs from 2001-2003 and in the 2005/2006 season. He also held the highest 3 point percentage 4 times (2000-01, 2001-02, 2010-11 & 2011-12). He currently sits #13, all time, in 3pt FG made with 1830. âMr. Big Shotâ earned that title!\n\nFree Throws\n\nProbably the biggest asset any PG in the NBA is there ability to make Free-Throws. When the Pistons had the lead late it was almost impossible to come back and beat them. Chauncey would make sure to seal out all the games at the line. Billups is still ranked 5th all time, finishing his career with a 89.4%! He also has 11 Top 10 finishes in Free Throw Percentage (1998-99, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11).\n\nDefense\n\nChauncey wasnât just offense though. He was 2nd NBA All Defensive Team in 2005 and 2006. Proving he could use his big 6â4â³ frame to bully other smaller point guards. Chauncey was just stronger than most he people he played against.\n\nBillups is a Winner\n\nThrow all the stats away and you can still lean on Chauncey Billups is just a flat out winner. He won in Colorado, He won for the Detroit Pistons, he elevated Denver.\n\nIf you still donât believe me, he finished in the Top 10 for win-share 5 times (2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 & 2007-08)! He is currently ranked #46 all time in Win Shares with 120.8. Not bad for a guy who was a journeyman early in his career.\n\nChauncey Should be in the Hall of Fame\n\nTaking my bias out, looking at basketball numbers, I think he should be in the Hall of Fame. He def has the stats to back it up. Billups also has some intangibles you will never see on paper. The leadership. The Calm. How he lead the Pistons from playoff obscurity to going to the Eastern Conference Finals 6 years in row! If the NBA voters and coaches cant see that Chauncey Billups is a sure fire Hall of Fame player, they are losing credibility."
