        "text": "First of two parts | Read Part 2\n\nLAS VEGAS — Chauncey Billups entered the lobby of the Four Seasons hotel wearing a Portland Trail Blazers polo, shorts and a set of golf clubs strapped behind his back.\n\nA nine handicap, Billups didn’t mind braving the Las Vegas heat — it reached 102 that day — to get in 18 before heading to an NBA summer league practice. But Billups’ group, which included new Blazers assistant coach Scott Brooks, wisely hit the links at about 7:15 a.m. while the weather was more bearable.\n\n“The heat wasn’t too bad,” Billups said.\n\nThe heat will certainly be elevated on Billups as he begins his first job as an NBA head coach. And he’s doing so amid a whirlwind of on-court stress.\n\nAfter taking over for a well-liked Terry Stotts, who guided the Blazers to eight consecutive playoff appearances, Billups will be tasked with establishing team-wide accountability while fixing a dreadful defense many believe held the team back. Billups inherits a disappointed fan base still sour over an early playoff exit. As a bonus, franchise player Damian Lillard is unhappy — despite the Blazers hiring his choice as coach — and has hinted several times this offseason that his days in Portland could be numbered if he doesn’t believe he can win a championship in Portland.\n\nNo pressure or anything.\n\nEven with all of that, Billups remains confident and stoic, yet humble enough to recognize his shortcomings, including inexperience. He spent one season as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Clippers before landing the Portland gig.\n\nYet overcoming obstacles has defined his career. Made him stronger. Made him an NBA champion in Detroit. Rising to the occasion also has earned him respect within the NBA world and provided him with a host of people eager to see him succeed and expecting that he will.\n\n“There are so many challenges and to be honest with you,” Billups said, “I’m not just a first-year head coach, I’m a second-year coach. I’m not like one of those assistant coaches that’s been around for 13, 14 years and finally got an opportunity. I own that and I understand that there’s so much that I don’t even know that I don’t know, if that makes sense.”\n\nCOACHING PEDIGREE\n\nBillups’ trek toward becoming a coach began at the University of Colorado. A Denver native, Billups went to Boulder carrying about every accolade a high-end basketball recruit could haul. All-State four times. Named Colorado’s Mr. Basketball three times and selected the state’s player of the year his sophomore and junior years.\n\nStill, he arrived in Boulder humble. Eager to learn the game from all angles. He found the perfect coach and mentor waiting.\n\nRicardo Patton, who now lives in Georgia, coached for 12 years at Colorado. During Patton’s first two years, Billups led the Buffaloes on the court as the point guard. Patton coached with authority and didn’t play favorites. He never had a problem with Billups, whom Patton described as being fun and easy to coach.\n\n“From day one he was always hungry to learn more about his craft, how he could be better, how he could have longevity in the game and make a difference,” Patton said. “If there’s such a thing as a natural-born leader, that’s who he is.”\n\nPatton targeted his tough love at players who deserved criticism. He wouldn’t say “we” need to play harder. He would single out the individual players he thought were slacking and hold them accountable in front of the entire team.\n\n“And if that happened to be Chauncey, then that’s who it happened to be,” Patton said.\n\nPatton recalled a game in which he ripped into Billups at halftime.\n\n“Every time you touch the ball, you’re turning it over,” Patton told Billups.\n\nBillups just sat there and nodded in agreement, saying: “OK, coach. I got you.”\n\nAfter the game, Patton looked at a copy of the game stats, took a glance at the turnovers and realized that Billups had committed only one the entire game. Patton joked that the one must have been so bad that it seemed like five.\n\nBut the point of his story was to illustrate how Billups never argued or defended himself. He accepted the criticism and moved forward.\n\nBillups might have been his own toughest critic. He would constantly look for ways to improve his game.\n\n“When he was in school and other guys were going out on the weekend and partying, he was watching game film,” Patton said.\n\nThat attention to detail led to moments that showed Patton just how well Billups was learning the game within the game.\n\nDuring a game at Texas Tech in January 1997, Colorado had the ball with just over 12 seconds remaining and the score tied 78-78.\n\nPatton called a play that involved a screen being set for Billups after he brought the ball up the court. In the team huddle, Billups recommended against the ball screen because he believed Texas Tech would counter by trapping to force Billups to pass. Instead, Billups asked to run an isolation play he hoped would allow him to create his own shot one-on-one. Patton saw his point and changed the play, calling for “1-4, baseline drop,” which placed four players along the baseline, allowing Billups to do his thing.\n\nBillups slowly worked the ball up the court, made a spin move at the three-point line, got to the right side of the key, pulled up and hit the game-winner over his defender with 0.5 seconds on the clock.\n\n“That was one of the first times that he told me that he knew what he was doing and I’m glad that I listened,” Patton said with a laugh.\n\nBut Patton would have never listened to Billups had he not demonstrated attention to detail and dedication to his craft. Such commitment, Patton said, led him to believe that one day Billups could run a team in a variety of capacities.\n\n“His basketball IQ is so high that I knew he could not only be a coach, he could run an organization,” Patton said. “He just gets it. He’s just one of those guys that’s been a student of the game.”\n\nBillups, after two seasons at Colorado, entered the 1997 NBA draft expecting instant stardom and success. Instead, he discovered frustration and failure. At least, initially. Billups went through many struggles before finally discovering success in Detroit under coach Larry Brown.\n\n“His career wasn’t that easy,” Brown said. “People don’t realize what he went through before he ended up in Detroit and everybody knows what happened after that. But prior to that, a lot of people talked about him as a failure.”\n\nIN NEED OF A MENTOR\n\nBoston made Billups the third overall pick of the 1997 draft. It took six years for him to finally live up to that status, and it happened with his fifth team.\n\nBillups admits that he simply wasn’t ready for the leap in competition when he left Colorado. Inconsistent play, a multitude of injuries and poor shooting marred his first five seasons in Boston, Toronto, Denver and Orlando. He never played a game for the Magic because of injuries.\n\nBillups signed with Minnesota in 2000 to back up point guard Terrell Brandon, who had been an All-Star in Cleveland. Brandon, out of Portland’s Grant High School and the University of Oregon, took Billups under his wing and schooled him on how to be a professional and navigate the NBA game.\n\n“My time with Terrell changed the trajectory of my career,” Billups said.\n\nBrandon knew of Billups as a player but didn’t know him well on a personal level. So, Brandon requested that the equipment manager move Billups’ locker next to his.\n\n“I remember the first time we talked, we talked for like three hours straight,” Brandon said. “No basketball. All we talked about was family. That’s how I get to know people, by the family. And what we had in common that we talked about was having a mother and father at home. OK, and that’s what struck both of us. And we just started talking about that, and the structure and the discipline that was given to us, man, and growing up in the hood.”\n\nIn practice, the 5-foot-11 Brandon said, the 6-3 Billups was tough to handle.\n\n“He was cold-blooded,” Brandon said. “I couldn’t stop him. His upper body was so strong and his basketball IQ was so good. Defensively, he was a bulldog. But he needed more knowledge and he wanted more.”\n\nBrandon’s first lesson for Billups was on how to properly watch game tape, telling him to watch everybody on the court other than himself to better learn the NBA game, study teammates, opponents, offenses and defenses. Brandon had learned that approach from Lenny Wilkens, his coach in Cleveland.\n\nBrandon also told Billups that when he was on the bench, truly watch the game. Don’t merely sit there and wait to go back in.\n\nAnother piece of advice was to learn the names of the officials.\n\n“Instead of calling the refs ‘ref,’ learn their names,” Brandon told Billups. “Because you can get away with murder when you know their name.”\n\nBrandon said Billups soaked up as much knowledge as he could and even would be eager to watch game video after a big game.\n\n“I’ve never mentored anybody that good who absorbed that much information the way he did and be receptive to the truth,” Brandon said.\n\nBrandon made 78 starts their first season together in 2000-01, and most of Billups’ 33 starts came at shooting guard. The following season, Brandon suffered a knee injury that cost him 50 games. Billups made 54 starts and finished the season averaging 12.5 points and what was then a career-high 5.5 assists.\n\n“I was happy as heck,” Brandon said.\n\nBillups became a free agent that offseason. Brandon wanted him back so badly that he hinted that he would go to the bench and back up Billups if needed.\n\n“I knew how valuable he would be to our team,” Brandon said.\n\nBillups wanted to return, but Brandon said the Timberwolves, who were also led by superstar forward Kevin Garnett, were too slow to make an offer and ended up losing him.\n\n“I think that really hurt our franchise,” Brandon said.\n\nAccording to reports, Minnesota was committed to Brandon being the point guard. So, Billups, still only 26, went to Detroit on a five-year deal worth $35 million while Brandon’s knee injury ultimately ended his career.\n\nBrandon, who said Lillard is his favorite player in the league and loves his demeanor, commitment and competitiveness, believes Billups will have a huge impact on the six-time All-Star and the Portland franchise.\n\n“He’s really going to help this organization,” Brandon said. “We just need some defense. Everybody knows what time it is.”\n\nMOTORING INTO DETROIT\n\nIn Detroit, Billups found a starting role on a good team and helped make it better. In 2003 the Pistons reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they were swept by the New Jersey Nets. That led to Detroit firing Rick Carlisle and hiring Brown, who had a reputation for being tough on point guards.\n\nBrown’s love for Billups is profound. He speaks about him glowingly, as if he were more like his son than simply one of the hundreds of players he has coached.\n\nTheir relationship began with Brown immediately asking Billups, who had finally found his groove as a player, to change his style of play from a scorer to more of an orchestrator and distributor. Billups needed a little convincing that a new philosophy would work, but he went along with the plan.\n\nBrown had Rasheed Wallace, Richard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince to provide offense and Ben Wallace as the defensive anchor. Brown wanted Billups to lead at both ends of the floor to make sure the team operated at optimal levels. That meant firing up the defense while making scoring secondary to spread the ball around to the rest of the team.\n\n“He sacrificed and it wasn’t easy for him,” Brown said.\n\nUltimately, Brown’s plan paid off. Billups’ scoring remained about the same at 16.9 points per game (he averaged 16.2 the previous season in four fewer minutes) but his assists went up from 3.9 to 5.7 per game.\n\nBillups’ unselfishness inspired the rest of the team.\n\n“When one of your truly special players is playing such a critical role, everybody recognizes the sacrifices he’s made and I think it’s easy to ask anybody else to do the same,” Brown said.\n\nIn Brown’s first season in Detroit, the Pistons won the 2004 NBA Finals over the Los Angeles Lakers, 4-1. Billups, named Finals MVP, averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists per game.\n\nIt’s the same outcome Billups wants to see transpire with Lillard in Portland.\n\n“I don’t think he’s going to ask anybody to do things they’re not capable of doing,” Brown said of Billups. “But he might emphasize some things that based on what he’s seen in the past, and his experience over time is what he thinks is going to help them win.”\n\nNEIL OLSHEY INTERCEPTS\n\nBillups made three All-Star teams while with Detroit before ultimately being traded to Denver early in the 2008-09 season and played for another big influence on his career, coach George Karl. Billups, along with All-Star Carmelo Anthony, led Denver to the 2009 Western Conference Finals where the Nuggets lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nDenver traded Billups to the New York Knicks during the 2010-11 season. A lockout the following year delayed the start of the season until late December.\n\nIn December 2011, New York used the amnesty rule on Billups and his $14.2 million per year contract to gain cap space. He hoped to clear waivers, become a free agent take his talents to South Beach to play alongside LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, which would go on to win the 2012 NBA title.\n\nBut 15 minutes before the deadline, agent Andy Miller called to tell Billups that the Clippers, then run by Neil Olshey, had scooped him up, even though they already had swung a deal to get Chris Paul away from New Orleans.\n\nOlshey reportedly bid $2 million to claim Billups, thus leaving the Knicks to pick up the other $12.2 million of his salary.\n\nBillups, who had previously said that he could retire if he were picked up by a team he didn’t want to play for, shook off the disappointment and showed up in Los Angeles eager to play with Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.\n\n“I’m a person that, I don’t hold grudges,” Billups said. “My perspective is always pretty strong. I was grateful to be there and I was grateful that they actually wanted me. So, it didn’t take long at all for that to wear off.”\n\nAn Achilles injury ended his season after 20 games. During the 2012 offseason, Olshey left the Clippers to become the general manager of the Blazers. The following season, Billups appeared in only 22 games. He went back to Detroit but again injuries limited him to just 19 games. Billups’ body had had enough. He retired the following offseason.\n\nBillups’ final three seasons produced just 61 appearances. But those first seven months in Los Angeles with Olshey solidified them as friends.\n\n“We’ve had a very, very good relationship,” Billups said. “I just understand the dude.”\n\nThat relationship would pay off for Billups down the road.\n\nPart 2: Billups transitions from the court to television with his sights still set on a coaching career."
