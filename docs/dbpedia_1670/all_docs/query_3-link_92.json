        "text": "What is Chauncey Billups's Net Worth?\n\nChauncey Billups is a professional basketball coach and former player who has a net worth of $35 million. During his NBA playing career, Chauncey earned $107 million in salary.\n\nChauncey Billups serves as the head coach of the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. He previously played for a number of NBA teams from 1997 to 2014, and in 2004 helped the Detroit Pistons win an NBA championship. Before joining the Trail Blazers as head coach, Billups was a broadcast sports analyst and then an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nEarly Life and High School\n\nChauncey Billups was born on September 25, 1976 in Denver, Colorado. His younger brother is Rodney, who also went on to play and coach basketball. Billups attended George Washington High School, where he was a star on the basketball team. In addition to being a four-time all-state pick, he was named Colorado Player of the Year for both his sophomore and junior years. He graduated from George Washington in 1995.\n\nCollegiate Career\n\nFor college, Billups chose to attend the University of Colorado Boulder, where he played two seasons of college basketball with the Buffaloes. In that time, he averaged 18.5 points, 5.1 assists, and 5.6 rebounds per game. Moreover, in 1997, Billups helped lead the Buffaloes to their first NCAA tournament in 28 years.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nIn the 1997 NBA draft, Billups was chosen with the third overall pick by the Boston Celtics. However, he ended up not gelling with new Celtics head coach Rick Pitino, and had persistent problems with the coaching staff. This led to Billups being traded by the team after 51 games.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nBillups was traded to the Toronto Raptors in early 1998. In a total of 29 games with the team, he averaged 11.3 points and 2.7 rebounds per game.\n\nDenver Nuggets, 1999-2000\n\nIn early 1999, Billups was dealt to the Denver Nuggets, his hometown team. He finished up the season with the team averaging 13.9 points and 2.1 rebounds per game in 45 games. The next season, Billups played in just 13 games before being traded to the Orlando Magic. However, due to an injured shoulder, he never played for the Magic.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nBillups made his way to the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2000. That season, he appeared in 77 games as the team reached the first round of the playoffs. In the 2001-02 season, Billups played in a career-high 82 games as the Timberwolves again reached the first round of the playoffs.\n\nDetroit Pistons, 2002-2008\n\nAfter becoming a free agent, Billups signed a five-year contract with the Detroit Pistons in 2002. He had immediate success with the team, helping the Pistons finish first in the Eastern Conference with a 50-32 record for the regular season. In the playoffs, the team made it to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the New Jersey Nets in four games. Billups and the Pistons went on to have an incredible 2003-04 season, culminating in an upset victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. In the championship, Billups averaged 21 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.2 rebounds per game; he was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP. The Pistons reached the NBA Finals again in 2005, but fell to the San Antonio Spurs. Billups became a co-captain of the team in 2006, and helped lead the Pistons to a franchise-best 64-18 record. In the 2007 offseason, he signed a new, four-year contract with the Pistons. The team made it back to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2008, but lost to the Celtics.\n\nDenver Nuggets, 2008-2011\n\nBillups was traded back to his hometown Nuggets in late 2008. He went on to help lead the Nuggets to a number of franchise records during the 2008-09 season, including tying the Nuggets' regular-season record of 54-28. In the playoffs, Billups set a franchise record for most three-pointers in a playoff game, with nine, as well as most three-pointers in a playoff series, with 19. He also helped the Nuggets make it to the NBA Conference Finals for the first time in over 20 years; they ultimately lost to the Lakers. Billups continued his success in the 2009-10 season, recording a career-high average of 19.5 points per game. In his final season with the Nuggets in 2010-11, he averaged 16.5 points per game and recorded a career-high .441 three-point field goal percentage.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nIn early 2011, Billups was traded to the New York Knicks. The team ended up finishing the season 42-40 and securing the sixth seed in the Easter Conference, good enough for a playoff berth. In the playoffs, Billups was sidelined with a knee injury as the Knicks were eliminated in the first round.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nAfter being put on waivers by the Knicks, Billups was claimed by the Los Angeles Clippers. However, his 2011-12 season was ended after just 20 games due to an Achilles tendon tear. Billups was plagued by injuries again in the 2012-13 season, limiting his playing time to 22 games.\n\nDetroit Pistons, 2013-2014\n\nBillups returned to the Pistons for the 2013-14 season. Once again, however, injuries got in his way, causing him to miss most of the season and post career lows in multiple categories. Following the season, the Pistons declined to pick up their team option on Billups' contract for the next season. Billups announced his retirement from NBA playing later in the year.\n\nNational Team Career\n\nBeyond the NBA, Billups played for the US men's national basketball team. With the team, he won gold medals in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship and the 2010 FIBA World Cup.\n\nBroadcasting Career\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Billups became a basketball studio analyst for ESPN programming, including \"SportsCenter\" and \"NBA Countdown.\" In 2019, he left \"NBA Countdown\" to become the game analyst for Clippers telecasts.\n\nCoaching Career\n\nIn late 2020, Billups became an assistant coach for the Clippers. He served in that position until 2021, when he became the new head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nPersonal Life & Real Estate\n\nWith his wife Piper, whom he married in 2001, Billups has three daughters: Cydney, Ciara, and Cenaiya.\n\nIn 2002, Chauncey paid $1.638 million for a home in Rochester, Michigan. He sold this home in November 2007 for $1.3 million.\n\nIn 2009, Chauncey paid $3 million for a 9,000 square foot mansion in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado. He sold this home in 2016 for $2.7 million."
