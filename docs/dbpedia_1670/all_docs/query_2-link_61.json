        "text": "Eight-time All-Star Vince Carter, 2004 NBA champion Chauncey Billups and four-time WNBA champion Seimone Augustus headline the list of honorees in the Basketball Hall of Fame's Class of 2024.\n\nThirteen legends of the game will take their place among basketball immortals in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nBasketball Hall of Fame 2024 Inductees\n\nVince Carter\n\nChauncey Billups\n\nSeimone Augustus\n\nBo Ryan\n\nMichael Cooper\n\nWalter Davis\n\nMichele Timms\n\nJerry West\n\nDoug Collins\n\nDick Barnett\n\nHarley Redin\n\nHerb Simon\n\nCharles Smith\n\nCarter was the Toronto Raptors' first true star since they entered the league in 1995. The 1998-99 Rookie of the Year, he averaged 23.4 points per game in his six-plus seasons north of the border.\n\nThe two-time All-NBA wing continued to perform at a high level following his acrimonious divorce from the Raptors and trade to the New Jersey Nets in 2004.\n\nCarter's prodigious dunking ability will be what's remembered most from his career. His performance in the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest was one of the greatest in the event's history, and his thunderous jam over 7'2\" Frederic Weis in the 2000 Summer Olympics is in a class of is own.\n\nBillups' legacy is largely defined by the success he enjoyed at the team level.\n\nThe 6'3\" guard was the missing ingredient for the Detroit Pistons as they made the first of six straight Eastern Conference Finals appearances after signing him in 2002. They were crowned champions after beating the Los Angeles Lakers in four games in the 2004 Finals, with Billups averaging 21.0 points and 5.2 assists across the series en route to winning Finals MVP.\n\nFor the Denver Nuggets, the five-time All-Star was very nearly once again the pivotal piece in a championship formula. After losing in the first round of the playoffs for five straight years, the Nuggets made the 2009 Western Conference Finals after having acquired Billups earlier in the campaign.\n\nAugustus' college résumé on its own might have been enough to propel her into the Hall of Fame. A two-time winner of the Wade Trophy, Wooden Award and Naismith Player of the Year, she helped LSU reach the Final Four in each of her last three years.\n\nIn 2006, Augustus joined the Minnesota Lynx after they had made the playoffs twice in their first seven seasons. By the time she retired in 2020, the Lynx had enjoyed the most prolonged run of success in league history.\n\nBetween 2011-17, Minnesota won four titles and finished runner-up twice. The Houston Comets reeled off four straight titles from the launch of the WNBA in 1997 but even they failed to match the Lynx's extended consistency.\n\nAugustus was there for the entire ride, and the evolution of the WNBA's financial structure and salary cap makes it tough to envision another franchise achieving what the Lynx did anytime soon."
