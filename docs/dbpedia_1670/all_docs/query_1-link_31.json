        "text": "Just as reality intruded on Butler last month in Houston, it descended on the undermanned Knicks on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, neatly camouflaged in the 6-foot-1, 170-pound point guard persona of Rajon Rondo.\n\nIn the emerging small-guard culture of the N.B.A., visionary talent outweighs single-minded scorers and a handful of legitimate excuses. Without Chauncey Billups and with the sore-backed Amar’e Stoudemire a shadow of himself, the Knicks had their share after a 113-96 beat down by the Celtics in Game 3 of their now-lopsided playoff series.\n\nMore important, they had no answer for Rondo and wouldn’t have even if Billups had been able to play on two good 34-year-old legs.\n\nWith their season of rebirth following a decade of irrelevance nearing its end — Sunday’s Game 4 offers the opportunity to avoid a sweep — the lesson to take home for the summer is that, yes, the deal for Carmelo Anthony required significant sacrifices.\n\nIt turns out that none were more unfortunate — for this season, at least — than the one people focused on least, the swapping of Raymond Felton for Billups.\n\nEarlier in the week in Boston, the Knicks president, Donnie Walsh, admitted that he “hated to give up Felton,” who for almost four months provided quickness, penetration and a defensive presence that didn’t rank him among the elite but gave the Knicks what has been badly lacking in this first-round series.\n\nIn the wake of Game 3, which left the Garden crowd in a funereal mood after seeing its first playoff action in seven years, everybody was naturally awed by the shooting of Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. The two veterans riddled the Knicks from the perimeter, combining for 70 points on 25-for-37 shooting.\n\nRondo, meanwhile, had 20 assists on the way to a triple-double (15 points, 11 rebounds), moving Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni to say: “Rondo is good, he controlled the game, he controlled his team. But when you have Ray Allen and Paul Pierce hitting shots like that, that’s where your assists come from.”\n\nThe acquisition merely gave the Celtics a world-class conductor for their Big Three symphony of Allen, Pierce and Kevin Garnett, as their coach, Doc Rivers, was quick to acknowledge.\n\n“To me, it is his play-calling tonight,” Rivers said of Rondo. “When he gets himself into a rhythm, it allows us as coaches to get into a rhythm because we see the game through him.”\n\nHere is what Rivers saw in the third quarter when the Celtics broke open an 8-point game and snuffed out whatever fantasy the Knicks had of making a stand in the game and by extension the series. In a 34-point quarter, Rondo directly or indirectly accounted for 23 of the points with a stunning ubiquity — on the boards, on the break and with pinpoint accuracy in the half-court offense.\n\nThe common strategy is to back off him, dare him to shoot, but from the opening minutes of Game 3, Rondo had the body language of a counselor playing with the campers on field day, relaxed and free to roam and dissect the Knicks with impunity.\n\n“The benefit when they lay off him is his vision,” Rivers said, who laughed and recalled his own early days in the league in Atlanta as a point guard who was welcome to dent the rim if he dared.\n\n“Sometimes when they back off it screws you up so it’s hard to say whether it’s good or bad,” Rivers said. “When we do it to him in practice we’re not even sure.”\n\nMaybe the success of the strategy all hinges on the flow of the game, every one of which creates its own identity and demands teams with championship aspirations to play fast, slow and in-between. Besides the Knicks’ bad luck with Billups and Stoudemire, that is the most glaring difference between them and their playoff-tested opponents.\n\nWith their maestro calling the shots, the Celtics have clear purpose on most possessions and the Knicks do not. As Walsh admitted last week in Boston, they are going to require a major upgrade at the point if they are going to compete at the N.B.A.’s highest level, no matter how many points Anthony can score.\n\nIt’s a familiar theme that has haunted the Knicks for years, or since they traded Walt Frazier to Cleveland 34 years ago, or just about the time Chauncey Billups was born."
