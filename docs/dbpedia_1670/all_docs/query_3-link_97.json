        "text": "Detroit Pistons legend Chauncey Billups could be headed for retirement after the team officially announced today that it did not pick up the player's $2.5 million team option for the 2014-15 season.\n\nBillups, who was NBA Finals MVP when the Pistons won the 2004 championship, returned to the team last summer via free agency, five years after he was traded for Allen Iverson in 2008.\n\nHis return was curtailed by injuries, ultimately leading to a late-season knee injury which ended his season after just 19 games and seven starts.\n\nBillups played 61 total games in his final three NBA seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers and Pistons.\n\nBillups last week told a Denver television station, KUSA, that he is considering retirement.\n\n\"It's been very frustrating. But as we know, Father Time is undefeated. He's undefeated. But I can't be too frustrated, I got a lot of miles and a lot of use out of my body,\" he told the television station.\n\nThat reiterated Billups' remarks late last season, when it became apparent his injuries might curtail any thoughts of extending his career through next season.\n\n\"The knee will be one of the things that, of course, will let me know if I can come back and play, if that's an option,\" Billups told MLive in April. \"And then there will be maybe some external opportunities that will be worth taking a look at -- maybe. Maybe there won't be. So it's kind of touch and go.\"\n\nBillups, 37, played all or part of eight with the Pistons during his 17-year career. He also played five seasons with his hometown Denver Nuggets.\n\nBillups also played for the Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks.\n\nAn Achilles' tendon injury with the Clippers short-circuited his time there, and just as he fully recovered from that injury, tendinitis assaulted his knees.\n\nBillups reportedly is a candidate to join the Minnesota Timberwolves coaching staff under Flip Saunders, his former Pistons coach.\n\nHe long has said he would prefer a front-office job, however.\n\nIn talking to MLive two months ago, Billups emphasized that he hoped to play next season but knew it might not be possible.\n\n\"What I wanted, coming back here, was two things,\" he said at the time. \"One, I wanted to finish my career here. Two, I wanted to get this team into the playoffs. Obviously, if you can't get on the floor, it's tough to control destiny when you're sitting on the sidelines. So that will not sit well with me. But it's not something that I could control. I did everything I could do to try to stay healthy.\"\n\nPistons owner Tom Gores, in a team statement, said Billups \"embodies what it means to be a member of the Detroit Pistons.\"\n\n\"His leadership, dedication and excellence, both on and off the court, provide a great example for aspiring young athletes,\" Gores said in the statement. \"He will forever be a welcome member of the Pistons family and I am confident that after his playing days are over he will have a long and bright future in this league.\"\n\nPresident of basketball operations and head coach Stan Van Gundy ultimately made the final decision on Billups.\n\n\"Chauncey Billups will always be a valued member of the Detroit Pistons' family,\" Van Gundy said in the statement. \"Decisions like these are always difficult to make and we certainly wish Chauncey and his family the best in the future.\""
