        "text": "Tony Allen\n\n6-4 213 Oklahoma State 4th year SG-SF\n\nAthletic shooting guard seemed on the verge of a career breakthrough before a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee cost him the final 48 games of last season. Before the injury, he averaged 11.5 points per game in 33 contests. He averaged 6.6 points per game in 75 games this season mainly as a backup to Ray Allen and Paul Pierce. His strength was his ability to provide defense off the bench both at guard and small forward. He also shared some point guard duties after playing the position extensively early in his career. Allen had fallen out of the main playoff rotation due to inconsistency late in the season. He suffered an Achilles strain prior to Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals - forcing him to the inactive list the final two games of that series.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Celtics coach Doc Rivers said early this week it was doubtful Allen would be able to play early in the series due to the injury. If he is able to go, he could be very useful in spot duty against Kobe Bryant if the Lakers superstar draws Ray Allen or Paul Pierce into foul trouble.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Allen is one of only three members remaining with the Celtics - along with Paul Pierce and Kendrick Perkins - from the 2005 Atlantic Division championship team.\n\nP.J. Brown\n\n6-11 259 Louisiana Tech 15th year PF-C\n\nWell-traveled veteran known for defense and rebounding throughout his career was coaxed out of semi-retirement during the All-Star break during a visit from Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. He wound up playing in 18 games late in the season and averaged 2.2 points and 3.8 rebounds. Brown's role was uncertain going into the playoffs, but the 38-year-old became the first Boston big man off the bench during the Cavaliers series. He had a dramatic impact in the Game 7 victory when he scored 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting in 20 minutes - including a critical late jumper.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Though the matchups don't favor him as much as they did in the Cavaliers and Pistons series, Brown's veteran savvy and reliability will likely continue to earn him the first call from Rivers when he spells Kevin Garnett or Kendrick Perkins late in the first quarter.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Brown played in his 100th career playoff game in Game 6 against the Pistons.\n\nGlen Davis\n\n6-9 289 Louisiana State University 1st year PF\n\nThe Celtics chose Davis with the 34th overall pick in last June's draft with the selection they got from the Sonics in the Ray Allen trade for Wally Szczerbiak, Delonte West and the 5th overall pick (Jeff Green). Davis made a surprise impact this season with 4.5 points and 3.0 rebounds in 69 games. He had several big efforts, including 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting in a Jan. 5 victory at Detroit and a 9-point, 8-rebound effort in 33 minutes guarding Tim Duncan when the Celtics beat the Spurs on Feb. 10. He has played sparingly in the playoffs, though his role did increase late in the conference semifinals and the beginning of the conference finals.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Rivers has alternated between using Leon Powe and Glen Davis off the bench for much of the playoffs. He could give Davis a shot in the Finals because of the mobility of the Los Angeles big men. Rivers has had his most success using the rookie's energy as a boost at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Davis says the nickname \"Big Baby\" came from the fact that he was always playing against older kids in youth football because of his size. He was a running back on his high school team.\n\nEddie House\n\n6-1 175 Arizona State 8th year PG-SG\n\nHouse joined his eighth team in his NBA career this season and filled an important role as a sharpshooter off the bench with averages of 7.5 points and 2.1 assists. He also saw extensive time as Rajon Rondo's backup at point guard. Though he often struggled with his ball-handling against pressure defenses, his energy and ball movement skills made him especially effective when Doc Rivers sought to space the floor for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce. After falling to third string point guard behind Sam Cassell in the playoffs, he returned to prominence with spirited efforts in both Game 6 and Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He has since become an overwhelming fan favorite at the Garden - prompting \"Eddie! Eddie!\" chants when he enters the game.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Rivers has wrestled with the Eddie House-Sam Cassell question throughout the playoffs. Though he went back to Cassell during most of the Pistons series, the Lakers are a better matchup for House (much like the Cavaliers were) and he could well get another chance to back up Rondo late in games.\n\nINERESTING FACT: His 7-year-old son, Jaelen, has become an unofficial ball boy for the team and can often be seen bounding on the outskirts of a team huddle wearing an oversized No. 50 shirt during home games.\n\nSam Cassell\n\n6-3 185 Florida State 15th year PG\n\nThe two-time NBA champion eagerly joined the Celtics after negotiating a buyout from the Clippers shortly after the NBA trading deadline. He averaged 11.2 and 3.9 assists with the Clippers this season before averaging 7.7 points and 2.1 assists in 17 games with the Celtics late in the regular season. After playing very well off the bench early in the playoffs, he has struggled offensively and is just 3-for-24 shooting going back to Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. After sitting out four games entirely, he returned to the rotation in limited minutes as Rajon Rondo’s backup at point guard during the conference finals.\n\nFINAL IMPACT: Cassell was brought in because of his reputation for hitting big shots at the end of big games and there are no games bigger than the NBA Finals. However, if Cassell’s shot is not falling, his defensive struggles become glaring. Doc Rivers will again have to decide whether to use Cassell, Eddie House, or a combination of both, to spell Rajon Rondo in the series.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Rondo was 7 years old when the 38-year-old Cassell was drafted by the Rockets with the 24th pick in the 1993 draft.\n\nKendrick Perkins\n\n6-10 280 Clifton J. Ozen HS (Tex) 5th season C\n\nThe oft-overlooked man of the Celtics lineup started 78 games this season and averaged 7.0 points and 6.1 assists, while shooting 61.5 percent, this season. Though his tough defense and opportunistic offense was a factor throughout the season, he may have broken through with the game of his career in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals when he had 18 points (on 8-of-11 shooting) with 16 rebounds in 38 minutes. His 13 rebounds at halftime were more than the entire Pistons team (11) to that point of the game. If Perkins can stay out of foul trouble, he is a physical presence under the basket who can take advantage of the help defense shifting toward Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, while taking some of the physical burden of guarding the post from Garnett.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Perkins has the athleticism to be able to stay with mobile Lakers big man Pau Gasol, but he must be wary of picking up fouls on Kobe Bryant’s drives to the basket and a temper that has made him a technical foul magnet at times this season and during the playoffs.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Perkins was a part of Danny Ainge’s first major move with the Celtics when Ainge acquired the draft rights to Perkins and Marcus Banks from the Grizzlies in exchange for the draft rights to Troy Bell and Dahntay Jones in the 2003 draft.\n\nScot Pollard\n\n6-11 278 Kansas 11th year PF-C\n\nPollard was limited to just 22 games this season due to ligament damage in his ankle. He wound up having reconstructive surgery on both ankles and hopes to return to the NBA for a 12th season next year. Though his contributions on the court were minimal, he provided a level of comic relief for the Celtics when he was around the team and became the star of the “Planet Pollard” segment of Comast Sports Net’s “Celtics Now” magazine show.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Inactive\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Pollard played at Kansas University with Celtics captain Paul Pierce and helped the Jayhawks to the Sweet Sixteen as a two-year starter.\n\nJames Posey\n\n6-8 217 Xavier (OH) 9th year SF-PF\n\nPosey was signed as a free agent late in the summer with his acquisition serving to solidify what was considered a thin Celtics bench entering the season. He averaged 7.4 points and 4.4 rebounds in 74 games and finished eighth in voting as Sixth Man of the Year. He has become the Celtics defensive stopper off the bench this season while also contributing as a 3-point shooting threat. He guarded LeBron James early in the conference semifinals, which helped keep the Cavs superstar in check and allowed Paul Pierce to concentrate more on his offense at times. His “poke” steal away from Chauncey Billups at the end of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals helped seal that series and send the Celtics to the NBA Finals. He started the season as the only member of the Celtics roster with a championship ring (the 2006 Miami Heat).\n\nFINAL IMPACT: Posey will continue to bring energy and defense off the bench and will be one of the main Celtics charged trying to contain reigning MVP Kobe Bryant.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: The Cleveland native’s nickname “Big Game James” comes from his prowess as a bowler.\n\nLeon Powe\n\n6-8 240 California 2nd year PF\n\nUndersized power forward was one of the feel-good stories of the season. He was a DNP-CD 23 times earlier this season before seizing his chance with 10 points in a victory over the Sixers on Jan. 18. He went on to average 8.0 points and 4.1 assists as a main rotation guy in the Celtics frontcourt. He had 25 points and 11 rebounds in a Jan. 29 victory over the Heat and had 27 points and 11 rebounds in the regular season finale against the Nets. After remaining the first big man off the bench during the first-round series against the Hawks, Powe dropped further back in the rotation throughout the playoffs. He has played less than 10 minutes in 10 straight games.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: The always-ready Powe proved that when he came in for a foul-plagued Kevin Garnett and contributed some solid minutes in Game 6 against the Pistons. His struggles on some defensive rotations may have cost him minutes in the conference finals overall, but there is no better source for rebounds and physical play in the paint off the Celtics bench.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: He was an AAU teammate of both Kendrick Perkins and LeBron James before rules changes forced James to a squad closer to his Ohio home.\n\nGabe Pruitt\n\n6-4 170 USC PG 1st year\n\nTaken with the second pick of the second this past June, Pruitt played sparingly for the Celtics this season. He averaged just 2.1 points in 15 games and spent much of the season with Utah Flash of the NBDL. When he did play, Pruitt showed some promise defensively and with his shooting ability. He is back practicing with the team during the playoff run.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Pruitt will be inactive unless dramatic injuries occur.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: One of the steals and 3-point shooting leaders in USC history, Pruitt entered the NBA draft following his junior year instead of staying to form a daunting backcourt along with NBA lottery hopeful O.J. Mayo.\n\nRajon Rondo\n\n6-1 171 Kentucky PG 2nd year\n\nTrusted with the “keys to the car” in only his second year out of Kentucky, Rondo has rewarded the Celtics confidence in his abilities with improvements across the board. He averaged 10.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists this season while raising his shooting percentage from 41.8 to 49.2 percent. While he has played well throughout the playoffs, his biggest two games were the Game 5 victories over the Cavaliers (20 points, 13 assists, 1 turnover in 42 minutes) and the Pistons (7 points, 13 assists, 4 steals, 1 turnover in 45:49). Rondo's quickness makes him a threat for steals and a very tough defensive matchup for opposing point guards. Though he struggled guarding bigger, more physical point guards this season, he arguable got the best of late-season matchups against Steve Nash, Chris Paul and Mike Bibby.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: After all the talk that Sam Cassell or Eddie House would eat into his minutes, Rondo has emerged as the undisputed starter and could log heavy minutes at point guard with the finish line now in sight.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Rondo says he did not watch basketball growing up in Louisville and had visions of being a college quarterback instead.\n\nBrian Scalabrine\n\n6-9 235 USC 7th F\n\nScalabrine faded from the rotation during his third year in Boston and was inactive late in the season after the Celtics signed Sam Cassell and P.J. Brown shortly after the trade deadline. He averaged 1.8 points in 48 games, although he made nine starts when Kevin Garnett was sidelined with an abdominal strain before the All-Star break. He was inactive for the first 18 games of the playoffs, but dressed for the last two after Tony Allen suffered an Achilles strain.\n\nFINALS IMPACT: Scalabrine will likely continue to dress as long as Allen is out, but he will only see the floor if there are injuries or severe foul trouble.\n\nINTERESTING FACT: Scalabrine is the fourth-longest tenured Celtics player behind Paul Pierce, Kendrick Perkins and Tony Allen."
