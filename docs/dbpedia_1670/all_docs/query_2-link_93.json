        "text": "CLEVELAND, May 28  Chauncey Billups says he has never been in a rut like this, one that has jolted him into uncharacteristic turnovers and strangely passive play.\n\nBut he will not say that he is concerned.\n\nBillups, the Detroit Pistons’ starting point guard and the 2004 N.B.A. finals most valuable player, has committed 17 turnovers  three more than his assist total  in the first three games of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nNicknamed Mr. Big Shot, Billups led the Pistons in scoring during the regular season and in the first two playoff rounds. But he has scored only 13 points in each of the three games against Cleveland. He insists, however, that he is not in the same shooting slump he experienced in the regular season.\n\nAll that rattled him was when a reporter asked if his mother, Faye, was offering him her usual strong support during his struggles. He laughed, and scoffed a bit.\n\n“You all act like we’re down, 3-0, and I’m averaging 3 points and 9 turnovers,” Billups said Monday before the Pistons practiced at Cleveland State. “Come on, man, it’s not that serious. We’re up, 2-1, Eastern finals, chance to win Game 4. It’s not that serious.”\n\nBillups missed his first six shots, was benched in the second quarter and even traveled three times during Game 3 on Sunday night. He briefly rallied the Pistons in the fourth quarter, but by then LeBron James had taken over for Cleveland, orchestrating an 88-82 victory with his 32 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists.\n\nBut just as the Cavaliers were exhaling, they received some potentially unsettling news Monday.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed that Cleveland’s starting point guard, Larry Hughes, had a partly torn plantar fascia in his left foot and was doubtful to play in Tuesday’s Game 4.\n\nDaniel Gibson, the undersized rookie point guard, may start over the veteran Eric Snow. Gibson hit a big 3-pointer in the fourth quarter and stripped the ball from Detroit’s Tayshaun Prince. It was in that fourth quarter against Gibson, though, when Billups started to get his shot back.\n\n“I feel like every shot he shoots, the next one is going to go in,” Gibson said of Billups. “He’s a strong dude. I just try to play him as tough as I can, play him early, and play him to my help.”\n\nThe Cavaliers have been trapping Billups to take away the Pistons’ pick-and-roll. In Game 3, the Pistons adjusted by directing more of their offense through the post, Chris Webber in particular, who scored 15 points.\n\nBut that also caused Billups’s backcourt mate, Richard Hamilton, to lay back and let his teammates take control. He missed all of three of his shots in the first half and finished 2 of 8 from the field.\n\n“We just have to be more aggressive out there, and good things will happen,” said Hamilton, who had 7 points.\n\nBillups said: “I’m not confused or concerned. I could be taking care of the ball a little better.”\n\nPistons Coach Flip Saunders was not buying such nonchalance from Billups or Hamilton on Monday.\n\n“They’re the main part of our team,” Saunders said. “That’s how this team was built. When you have two guys that they average roughly 40 points a game between them, and they go into a game and they get half that, it puts your team very much at a disadvantage. So they’ve got to bring it, as does everybody else.”\n\nBillups has been the stalwart of this Pistons team, helping take the franchise to the conference finals for the fifth straight season.\n\nAfter playing for four teams, Billups has become the model of stability in Detroit  on the eve of his becoming a free agent.\n\nSaunders just does not want Billups to become too comfortable now.\n\n“I just think he’s not being as aggressive in situations as he needs to be,” Saunders said. “And a lot of times when he’s like that, it carries over as far as the rest of the team.”\n\nUsually Billups picks his spots while getting his teammates involved, then raises his level of play in the fourth quarter. After three straight subpar games, though, it feels as if “everybody wants me to take over for the whole game,” Billups said.\n\n“And I’ve never been like that,” he said\n\nHis teammates just want him to be himself. “Chauncey can’t play a perfect game all of the time,” said Rasheed Wallace, who shrugged off Billups’s turnovers. “It’s part of the odds. He’ll be ready tomorrow.”\n\nREBOUNDS\n\nLarry Hughes said the chances were slim that he would play Tuesday. Last year, he missed four games of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Detroit after the death of his younger brother, Justin. He missed 45 games in the regular season last year with a finger injury and 10 games this season with a sprained right ankle. Hughes missed a potential winning shot in Game 2 against Detroit, but in Game 3 he was 2 for 2 from the field and from the foul line before injuring his left foot. “It always happens like that; once you think you got the things figured out, something else goes wrong,” Hughes said. “This is a series we can win, so I definitely want to be a part of it.”"
