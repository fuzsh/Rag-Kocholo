        "text": "Detroit Pistons vs. Washington Wizards\n\nDetroit Pistons guar Chauncey Billups looks to pass in the first quarter of their NBA game against the Washington Wizards in 2013.\n\n(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com)\n\nAUBURN HILLS -- Before he became Mr. Big Shot, Chauncey Billups was a Detroit Pistons fan.\n\nThe mild-mannered point guard grew up idolizing Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas and wore the No. 4 jersey during his tenures in Boston and Minnesota because of Dumars.\n\nOn Wednesday, during the Pistons' game against his hometown Denver Nuggets (7:30 p.m., Fox Sports Detroit), Billups will join Thomas and Dumars in the rafters of The Palace of Auburn Hills when his No. 1 jersey is retired.\n\n\"Just excited, honored,\" Billups told a group of reporters Tuesday. \"As I sit back and think about it, it's unreal to me, to be honest. I can remember me and my cousin always fighting -- he was a big Bulls and Michael Jordan guy, and of course I loved Michael Jordan, but I loved watching Joe Dumars and Isiah.\"\n\nBillups, 39, played eight seasons in Detroit as part of a 17-season NBA career, one that saw him start as journeyman before settling in with the Pistons.\n\nHe played for four separate teams from 1997, his first year in the league, to 2002, with brief stints in Boston and Toronto before learning under the tutelage of Sam Mitchell and Terrell Brandon in Minnesota.\n\n\"They meant the world to me,\" Billups said. \"They taught me everything. They taught me my game, myself, how to study my opponent, study our plays. They taught me so much about the game -- how to dress, everything. Not only on the floor, but I thought I was ready to be in a leadership position.\"\n\nBy the time Billups arrived in Detroit in 2002, he was coming off his most productive season yet (12.5 points, 5.5 assists per game in Minnesota) and the Pistons were beginning to cull pieces together to contend.\n\nThey had just made it to the Eastern Conference semifinals under first-year coach Rick Carlisle, and the tandem of Billups and Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton, with Ben Wallace underneath to grab rebounds, helped push Detroit through.\n\nThe Pistons went on to reach the Eastern Conference finals in 2003 and win the NBA title in 2004, with Billups named finals MVP.\n\n\"The whole outfit was tailor-made for me,\" Billups said. \"This team was already up and coming, this team wasn't rebuilding. I, personally, was in a position where I thought I was ready.\"\n\nBillups averaged 16.5 points and 6.2 assists per game during his eight-season career with the Pistons, made the NBA All-tar game five times and sits second in franchise history in 3-point baskets made (890), fourth in assists (2,984) and eighth in free throws (2,336).\n\nHe told the story of the first day meeting Hamilton, in which they clicked almost instantaneously, and credited the acquisition of Rasheed Wallace in 2004 with helping Detroit get over the hump\n\nPerhaps his most iconic moment was the half-court shot to send Game 5 of the 2004 Eastern Conference semifinals against the New Jersey Nets into overtime, a game the Pistons won, allowing them to take a 3-2 lead in the series.\n\n\"What they did here, especially with Larry (Brown), fit him very, very well,\" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. \"They were a medium-tempo to slow-tempo team that relied on their defense and then played half-court offense, and he was a great organizer.\n\n\"I think Chauncey was a very good - great, even - half-court basketball player, offensively and defensively. And I think that's great -- that's what the playoffs often boil down to.\""
