        "text": "It turns out that Chauncey Billups' final NBA season was as a member of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBillups, the 2004 NBA Finals MVP, has announced his retirement after 17 seasons with seven teams.\n\nHe enjoyed his greatest success after signing with the Pistons as a free agent on July 17, 2002. During his first six seasons in Detroit before being traded to Denver for Allen Iverson in 2008, Billups helped the Pistons reach the NBA Finals twice and the Eastern Conference Finals four other times.\n\nBillups, 37, was the MVP when the Pistons beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games to win their third NBA title in 2004. He averaged 16.4 points and 5.9 assists in the playoffs.\n\nHis best individual season was in 2005-06, when he averaged 18.5 points and 8.6 assists. Both are career highs.\n\nAfter being dealt for Iverson in the trade that marked the beginning of the Pistons' downfall, Billups played for the Nuggets, Knicks and Clippers before re-signing in Detroit as a free agent last year.\n\nBut injuries limited him to 19 games during his final season, when he averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 assists.\n\nIn 1,043 career games, Billups averaged 15.2 points and 5.4 assists.\n\nThe third overall pick in the 1997 draft by the Boston Celtics, Billups was a three-time member of the All-NBA team and made the All-Defensive team twice."
