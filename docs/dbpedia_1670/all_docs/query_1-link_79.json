        "text": "CLEVELAND — Greatness promised. Greatness delivered.\n\nWhen LeBron James' moment arrived, he was ready. Just like another No. 23.\n\nCall it LeBronesque.\n\nWith a tour-de-force performance that was one of the best in NBA playoff history, James shook the Detroit Pistons in Game 5 on Thursday night in 50 spellbinding minutes that included two nerve-racking overtimes.\n\nThe 22-year-old superstar soared like never before. He scored 48 points — the Cavaliers' final 25 and 29 of their last 30 — to carry Cleveland within one win of its first trip to the NBA finals.\n\nAt Detroit's suburban Palace, King James ruled.\n\n\"LeBron just wouldn't let us lose,\" Cavaliers guard Damon Jones said.\n\nJames stamped his growing reputation with all the fury of one of his thunderous slam dunks. He drove past Detroit's defenders, elevated to shoot over the Pistons and twisted through their double and triple teams as if in a playground back home in Akron.\n\nThe 48 points were spectacular, but hardly tell the whole story. He scored them in the biggest game of his four-year career. He scored them in the most important game in Cleveland's 37-year history. He scored them on the road, against the Pistons, one of the league's toughest defensive teams.\n\nAnd James — who added nine rebounds, seven assists and two steals — scored the 48 a little more than one week after being lambasted for his late-game decisions in Games 1 and 2, a pair of three-point losses.\n\nJames became the first player to score 25 straight points in the postseason, an effort rivaling almost anything Michael Jordan did in the playoffs.\n\n\"He just did what he felt he needed to do for us to win,\" Cavaliers coach Mike Brown said.\n\nJames' 48 points were the most scored against the Pistons since Nov. 23, 2001 — a span of 590 games.\n\nAfter being ridiculed for passing up the last shot in Game 1, James kept the ball in the final seconds of Game 2 but missed on a final attempt in the lane. At home for Game 3, he scored 32 points with nine assists and nine rebounds, making a tough jumper with 16 seconds left in the win.\n\nJames followed with a 13-point fourth quarter to win Game 4. That set stage for Game 5, when he scored all 18 points for Cleveland in the overtime sessions.\n\nHe capped his Motown masterpiece by knifing through three Pistons for a layup with 2.2 seconds left.\n\n\"We threw everything we had at him,\" Chauncey Billups said.\n\nNBA playoffs, Eastern Conference finals, Game 6, Detroit at Cleveland, 8:30 p.m., TNT, Cavaliers lead series 3-2.\n\nOn the air"
