        "text": "Game Winning Shots\n\nby Roland Beech, 82games.com\n\nAh yes, when it comes to requests for updated stats on features we've done in the past, nothing comes close to the clamor for another look at \"game winning shots\" in the NBA. The last time we investigated this was way back on 4/13/2006 as part of the Random Stat collection, and Carmelo Anthony came out on top for the most shots made by the definition we used (see below) as well as doing it with a wonderful .647 field goal percentage. That is a long time ago though, so let's see what the current word is!\n\nFirst off there's really one main issue -- what exactly do we want to define as a game winning shot? If we make it too restrictive, as in a real last second shot at the buzzer, then you are dealing with tiny, tiny sample sizes. So instead, we proposed the following filter:\n\nGame Winning Shot Opportunity = 24 seconds or less left in the game, team with the ball is either tied or down by 1 to 2 points.\n\nWhy use this definition?\n\nWith 24 seconds or less, then it truly is a \"last possession\" situation potentially\n\nWith a margin from tied to down 2, the team can take the lead with a made basket (including 3's)\n\nBy excluding a down 3 situation, we don't have the \"gimme two point buckets\" that defenses will sometimes yield to the quick bucket/intentional foul strategy option you often see exercised.\n\nObviously though this definition means a shot may not actually be a game winner -- it may only tie a game (if down two points) or it may allow enough time for the opponents to get a game winning shot of their own. Still it seems a reasonable compromise.\n\nData sample\n\nRegular Seasons: '03-04, '04-05, '05-06, '06-07, '07-08, '08-09 (thru 2/4)\n\nPlayoffs: '03-04, '04-05, '05-06, '06-07, '07-08\n\nSo we're looking at five full regular and playoff seasons, with additionally the current 08-09 season so far.\n\nLeading \"Game Winning Shot\" Players\n\nPlayer Fgm Fga Fg% Ftm Fta Ast T/O League Wide 853 2858 .298 610 815 352 296 LeBron James 17 50 .340 14 20 6 4 Vince Carter 16 51 .314 10 11 3 4 Ray Allen 15 39 .385 4 6 1 2 Kobe Bryant 14 56 .250 12 15 1 5 Carmelo Anthony 13 27 .481 7 11 1 4 Allen Iverson 13 33 .394 6 8 1 2 Ben Gordon 12 34 .353 6 6 1 4 Dirk Nowitzki 12 37 .324 13 18 1 3 Joe Johnson 12 45 .267 2 3 4 2 Paul Pierce 11 32 .344 15 17 9 3 Dwyane Wade 11 40 .275 13 17 3 2 Jamal Crawford 11 43 .256 4 6 3 3 Rashard Lewis 10 26 .385 10 13 0 1 Ricky Davis 10 28 .357 11 11 2 1 Antawn Jamison 9 16 .563 2 5 0 1 Pau Gasol 9 18 .500 4 6 1 4 Steve Francis 9 22 .409 4 5 2 2 Tim Duncan 9 23 .391 6 7 3 1 Gilbert Arenas 9 28 .321 18 18 0 4 Michael Redd 9 30 .300 8 14 0 1 Tracy McGrady 9 32 .281 8 8 3 1 Kevin Garnett 9 33 .273 3 3 1 0 Hedo Turkoglu 8 16 .500 2 3 3 3 Derek Fisher 8 20 .400 2 2 2 1 Chris Paul 8 21 .381 3 4 5 1 Mike Bibby 8 22 .364 2 2 6 1 Richard Hamilton 8 22 .364 4 4 3 3 Andre Iguodala 8 22 .364 10 11 2 3 Jason Terry 8 26 .308 2 3 5 1 Mehmet Okur 7 15 .467 4 4 1 0 Zach Randolph 7 17 .412 6 8 0 0 Brandon Roy 7 19 .368 3 4 3 1 Baron Davis 7 22 .318 4 4 4 2 Raymond Felton 7 24 .292 4 5 2 1 Travis Outlaw 6 7 .857 3 5 0 0 Carlos Boozer 6 9 .667 1 1 0 1 Jalen Rose 6 10 .600 4 5 0 4 Josh Smith 6 11 .545 3 3 0 2 Grant Hill 6 12 .500 0 0 0 0 Damon Jones 6 12 .500 1 1 1 0 Caron Butler 6 13 .462 6 7 1 1 Damon Stoudamire 6 13 .462 0 0 4 1 Kevin Martin 6 14 .429 2 3 0 0 David West 6 15 .400 2 2 0 1 Tyronn Lue 6 16 .375 4 6 0 0 Shawn Marion 6 16 .375 2 2 1 0 Tony Parker 6 16 .375 0 0 4 0 Tayshaun Prince 6 17 .353 2 2 5 1 Deron Williams 6 17 .353 3 3 5 1 Yao Ming 6 18 .333 9 10 0 1 Richard Jefferson 6 19 .316 3 4 2 1 Chris Webber 6 19 .316 0 0 1 1 Manu Ginobili 6 21 .286 4 7 3 4 Chauncey Billups 6 37 .162 18 19 6 2 Eddy Curry 5 7 .714 2 2 0 0 Peja Stojakovic 5 8 .625 1 1 1 0 Kevin Durant 5 14 .357 1 1 1 0 Rudy Gay 5 14 .357 3 4 0 1 Danny Granger 5 14 .357 0 0 0 0 Mike James 5 15 .333 3 7 2 0 Ron Artest 5 16 .313 1 1 2 3 Stephen Jackson 5 20 .250 1 1 4 2 Rasheed Wallace 5 30 .167 2 2 0 2 Ronald Murray 4 4 %1.000 5 6 0 1 David Lee 4 5 .800 0 0 0 0 Andrew Bogut 4 6 .667 0 0 2 1 P.J.

Ford 4 15 .267 1 3 3 2 Mike Miller 4 20 .200 0 2 2 2 Jermaine O'Neal 4 22 .182 4 4 1 0\n\nThe first thing to note is that these types of shots are very difficult on a league wide basis: a .298 Field Goal percentage doesn't exactly inspire confidence!\n\nPart of this is that game winning chances may come with just a couple of seconds or less remaining in the game from the inbounds. So manufacturing any shot at all in some cases is to the player's credit. In some cases it can even be a half court heave!\n\nLeBron James was just 4-19 in our previous look at game winning shots, so in the ensuing two and a half seasons, he has come up with a very respectable 13-31 (.419) record and just the other day had a pure game winner at the buzzer to top the Warriors. In addition he has six assists and a healthy number of free throws earned.\n\nVince Carter doesn't get a lot of love from fans for the most part but is actually #2 in the standings for most game winners over this period.\n\nRay Allen is in third overall but also leads in most 3's made under our game winning defined situation specifics, with eight three pointers. Long live the NBA's arguably best pure shooter (Ray also currently leads the NBA in Midrange 2pt FG%).\n\n...and then we get to Kobe Bryant. Kobe fans don't like to hear it, but while their man is #4 in the league in total game winners hit, he holds the top spot in a less glamorous category: most game winning opportunity missed shots!\n\n42 - Kobe\n\n35 - Vince Carter\n\n33 - Joe Johnson, LeBron\n\n32 - Crawford\n\n31 - Billups\n\nNow we're not Kobe haters by any means and I will readily give him his due as one of the best NBA players (note however, I didn't say the best) but he certainly has an overblown reputation when it comes to the clutch shot: people remember the ones he hits, but not the ones he misses, and heck you think a 56 FGA to 1 assist ratio might be part of the problem? He does have a better record in the playoffs though, which we'll get to down below.\n\nCarmelo Anthony has slipped from the former top spot, but still a worthy challenger with the best fg% of any player with at least 10 makes.\n\nBeyond that, you see a lot of familiar names, most with low success rates, and a lot of players with very low assists.\n\nPaul Pierce is an exception as he stands at the head of the class for 'game winning assists' with nine, ahead of Nash, Kidd, Billups, and the rest.\n\nOy! you say, what about the up and comers who may not have been playing all that long? Obviously Chris Paul (8-21), Igoudala (8-22), and Bradon Roy (7-19) are climbing the charts rapidly. Let's do a quick tab of the season by season leaders (fgm-fga):\n\n'03-04\n\nStoudamire 5-9\n\nJ.Rose 4-4\n\nYao 4-7\n\nCarter 4-11\n\nR.Allen 3-5\n\nZ.Randolph 3-5\n\nRedd 3-8 '04-05\n\nIverson 5-7\n\nFrancis 5-8\n\nP.J. Brown (!) 4-6\n\nB.Gordon 4-7\n\nDa.Jones 4-7\n\nPierce 4-9\n\nWade 4-11 '05-06\n\nCarmelo 7-10\n\nGasol 6-9\n\nR.Allen 5-11\n\nJ.Johnson 5-16\n\nFisher 4-6\n\nCrawford 4-8\n\nWebber 4-9 '06-07\n\nR.Lewis 5-7\n\nB.Gordon 5-14\n\nR.Davis 4-8\n\nCarter 4-9\n\nPaul 4-9 '07-08\n\nLeBron 6-14\n\nT.Outlaw 5-5\n\nGinobili 3-4\n\nR.Allen 3-7 '08-09\n\nGranger 5-7\n\nRoy 4-7\n\nR.Mason 3-3\n\nDurant 3-8\n\nFelton 3-8\n\nNow let's turn back to giving Kobe fans the ammunition they need to continue telling us how Mr. Bryant is the most uber-clutch guy in the NBA...with a look at Playoff Game Winning Shots\n\nLeading \"Game Winning Shot\" Players: PLAYOFFS\n\nPlayer Fgm Fga Fg% Ftm Fta Ast T/O NBA 45 159 .283 28 37 17 19 Kobe Bryant 4 8 .500 0 0 0 0 LeBron James 4 8 .500 0 1 1 0 Dirk Nowitzki 3 6 .500 6 8 1 1 Dwyane Wade 2 2 1.000 2 2 1 0 Caron Butler 2 3 .667 0 0 0 0 Gilbert Arenas 2 5 .400 3 3 0 0 Tim Duncan 2 6 .333 0 0 1 0 Manu Ginobili 2 6 .333 1 2 2 1 Chauncey Billups 2 9 .222 2 2 0 0\n\nSo now you have select company with only eight players, all of them all stars, with at least two makes. And yes, Kobe Bryant is indeed tied for first and with an excellent .500 percentage as well.\n\nThe truth seems to be that while we want to believe in the infallible hero who comes through every time, in the NBA even the brightest of the bunch are lucky to come through one out of three times.\n\nUltimately though while this kind of thing is fun, it's not to my mind particularly meaningful, other than indicating that the league as a whole could probably get more efficient in \"end game\" possessions...one easy place to start might be to try and be less predictable! It's nice to have a go-to guy, but when the other team knows without much doubt that a certain guy is getting the ball, it is going to be a lot easier to defend!\n\nJordan won a lot of championships, and personally hit a lot of clutch shots, but there were also games where classic second/third option guys like Paxson and Kerr were the ones benefiting from his greatness by getting open looks and delivering...\n\nSo instead of \"does my team have a great clutch go-to guy\" you might want to ask do we have a plan B?"
