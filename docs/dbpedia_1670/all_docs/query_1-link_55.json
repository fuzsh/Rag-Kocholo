        "text": "Online sports betting enthusiasts try to predict a lot of things, but rarely how many extra periods it could take to determine a winner.\n\nSome of these games went a lot longer than NBA odds could’ve projected, but the beauty of sports is that the outcome can differ from what was initially projected, especially in the playoffs.\n\nLet’s take a look at the most overtimes played in NBA playoff history.\n\nMost Overtimes Played in NBA Playoff Games\n\n1. Portland Trail Blazers vs. Denver Nuggets – 4OT\n\nA Rodney Hood 3-pointer with less than 20 seconds remaining in the fourth overtime finally gave Portland the cushion they needed to secure the victory after a long battle.\n\nCJ McCollum led the way with 41 points, eight rebounds, four assists, and four steals. Damian Lillard added 28 points, eight assists, and six rebounds.\n\nNikola Jokić put up 33 points, 18 rebounds, and 14 assists for Denver.\n\n2. Boston Celtics vs. Syracuse Nationals – 4OT\n\nBob Cousy led the way with 50 points, as he set the record for most free-throw makes in a single playoff game with 30.\n\nEd Macauley added 18 points, 15 rebounds, and five assists.\n\n3. Chicago Bulls vs. Brooklyn Nets – 3OT\n\nThe Nets held a 14-point lead with less than three minutes remaining in regulation, but Nate Robinson paced a 16-2 run with 12 points to force the game into overtime. Robinson scored 23 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter alone.\n\nCarlos Boozer added 21 points and eight rebounds. Kirk Hinrich provided 18 points and 14 assists.\n\n4.

Durant also had 13 rebounds and four steals.\n\nRussell Westbrook led the way with 40 points, five rebounds, five assists, and three steals. James Harden added 19 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists.\n\n5. Chicago Bulls vs. Boston Celtics – 3OT\n\nThe 41-41 Bulls pushed the 62-20 and defending champion Celtics to seven games after securing this win in three overtimes.\n\nJohn Salmon\n\nRay Allen, who forced a third overtime with a 3-pointer, went off for 51 points for the Celtics.\n\n6. New Jersey Nets vs. Detroit Pistons – 3OT\n\nChauncey Billups forced overtime with a heave from half-court to beat the buzzer, but the Nets outlasted the Pistons to go up 3-2 in the series.\n\nRichard Jefferson went off for 31 points and 11 rebounds. Kenyon Martin provided 22 points and nine rebounds. Kerry Kittles chipped in with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and five assists. Jason Kidd had 16 points, eight assists, six rebounds, three steals, and two blocks.\n\n7.

Barkley provided 24 points, 19 rebounds, and four assists. Kevin Johnson added 25 points, nine assists, and seven rebounds.\n\nMichael Jordan went off for 44 points, nine rebounds, and six assists.
