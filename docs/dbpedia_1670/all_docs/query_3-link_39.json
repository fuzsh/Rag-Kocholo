        "text": "Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nVince Carter and Chauncey Billups will reportedly be enshrined among basketball royalty.\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium reported Wednesday that Carter and Billups were elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as members of the 2024 class. The official announcement will come Saturday during the Final Four of the 2024 NCAA men's tournament.\n\nCarter entered the NBA as the No. 5 pick of the 1998 NBA draft and wasted no time establishing himself as a star, winning Rookie of the Year in his first season.\n\nThat kick-started a 22-year career that included eight All-Star nods and two All-NBA selections. He played for the Toronto Raptors, New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks, but is likely best remembered for his time in Toronto.\n\nIt was there that he was a high-flying superstar who helped popularize the sport in Canada as the face of the young franchise.\n\nHe famously won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest with one of the best performances in the event's history and guided the Raptors to their first three playoff appearances in franchise history. In all, he averaged 23.4 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks per game during his tenure with Toronto.\n\nDespite his incredible career, Carter never won a championship.\n\nHis fellow 2024 class member did and in large part because of his own individual performances.\n\nBillups was the 2004 NBA Finals MVP and led his Detroit Pistons to a 4-1 victory over the star-studded Los Angeles Lakers. Los Angeles had Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Gary Payton and Karl Malone, but the defensive-minded Pistons had no trouble in the relatively short series.\n\nBillups averaged 21.0 points, 5.2 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 50.9 percent from the field and 47.1 percent from deep during the series.\n\nIt was the highlight of his 17-season career that included stops on the Boston Celtics, Raptors, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Pistons, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe guard was a five-time All-Star, three-time All-NBA selection and two-time All-Defensive selection who was seen as an on-court leader during his career. It is fitting, then, that he is now an NBA head coach for the Portland Trail Blazers."
