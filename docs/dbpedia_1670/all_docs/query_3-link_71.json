        "text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y — Chauncey Billups once thought he'd have a career like Paul Pierce's.\n\nThe No. 3 overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft, Billups averaged 11.1 points and 4.3 assists while starting 44 of 51 games for Boston as a rookie and imagined being a Celtic for years.\n\nBut it just wasn't enough. A \"win-now\" mentality imposed by management on Rick Pitino, who was in his first season as the Celtics' coach, helped start Billups' travels to five teams in a stretch of five seasons.\n\n\"I don't know. I just think that I got caught up in a situation because I was playing well,\" Billups said Friday while discussing the trade that sent him to the Toronto Raptors for Kenny Anderson. \"I was starting. Rick signed for a lot of money. Everybody thought I hated Rick and Rick hated me. That wasn't the case.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when I got traded, he just basically told me that there was a lot of pressure on him to win. He needed to get a veteran point guard to try to help him do that. He basically didn't have time for me to kind of learn through my mistakes.\n\n\"It was tough for me to get traded at that point in my career,\" Billups continued. \"Third pick of the draft, you feel like you're going to be there for like nine or 10 years or your whole career, kind of like Paul has.\"\n\nBillups, who was acquired by the Knicks in February in the Carmelo Anthony trade, said he would use the trade as motivation to beat the Celtics during his first couple of years after the trade, but he no longer sees it as an \"extra incentive other than the desire to win.\"\n\nBillups, a veteran with 139 games of postseason experience and one NBA title, will face a test when it comes to containing the quick and athletic Celtics guard Rajon Rondoin the first-round playoff series that starts Sunday night at Boston.\n\nBillups, the MVP of the 2004 NBA finals, had nothing but praise for the 25-year-old point guard who has become an integral part of Boston's recent success.\n\n\"He's a tough matchup because he's so fast,\" Billups said. \"He's a smart player. He's crafty. He's really the engine for that team. Although they got a lot of Hall of Famers on that team, he is kind of the guy that makes you go.\"\n\nBillups believes Rondo is the only player in the league besides Dallas' Jason Kidd who can dominate a game without scoring.\n\nMike D'Antoni knows the Knicks will have a tough time containing Rondo and lauded his play. The Knicks coach said although the defensive assignment would go to Landry Fields at times, it will be Billups' job from the tipoff.\n\n\"We're not going to be tricky right off the bat,\" D'Antoni said. \"I see Rondo as one of smartest players in the game. I do know that from being around him at USA Basketball. He's a big key for them without a doubt. He's always come through, so I'm expecting the best from him knowing that he's good, he's really good.\"\n\nAlthough Billups has had to fight through a pair of thigh injuries since the Knicks acquired him, Amare Stoudemire is confident in the job his teammate will do against the younger Rondo.\n\n\"I think Chauncey is a sound vet. He knows what it takes to win,\" Stoudemire said. \"I have the most, high confidence in him. Rondo obviously is a seasoned player. He knows what he's doing. He's very crafty.\"\n\nShaquille O'Neal will miss the Sunday's Celtics-Knicks series opener with a right calf injury. Celtics general manager Danny Ainge made the announcement during practice Saturday. O'Neal ran briefly before the workout but had to stop because of the pain. O'Neal had missed 27 games with a sore right leg then returned on April 4 against Detroit. But he lasted just 5 minutes, 29 seconds before leaving again and has not played since.\n\nShaq will sit"
