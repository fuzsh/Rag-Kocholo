        "text": "Pistons 108\n\nKnicks 100\n\nAUBURN HILLS – Isiah Thomas got a strong ovation from the Pistons fans during pregame introductions last night. They still remember Thomas’ Piston point-guard heroics. But once the game began, The Palace continued to see another Pistons point guard emerge as a player every bit as good as Thomas, a 12-time All-Star.\n\nChauncey Billups, a great friend of Stephon Marbury, had a near-perfect night in drilling the Knicks and showing why Detroit still has a fine chance of returning the Finals after a one-year hiatus.\n\nBillups scored 22 with 16 assists, shooting 8-of-9 from the field as the Pistons repelled the Knicks 108-100 to post their eighth straight victory. The Knicks (6-12) now embark on a six-game homestand tonight vs. Toronto, taking in a 1-6 Garden record, worst in the league.\n\n“We’ve done a pretty good job on the road, now we’ve got to go home and string together some victories,” Thomas said.\n\nWhile Billups has soared into the league’s best point guard, Marbury still is finding himself. He was just 4-of-15 for 13 points with six assists.\n\nThe Knicks were within 86-83 with 5:10 left. But never did the Pistons (11-5) seem threatened.\n\n“They’re a championship team,” Thomas said. “They have guys who have been to the Finals two of the last three years. They know how to do it, when to turn it on. They tried to knock us out … We hung in there. One day, we’ll understand how to play together. They’ve been playing together for a while now.”\n\nOther than Ben Wallace’s defection, the core is all back, and defending champ Miami is way down. Tayshaun Prince burned the Knicks for 31 points and Richard Hamilton 26. Sound familiar?\n\nEddy Curry scored 20-plus points for the fifth straight game in notching 24, but he was 6-of-12 from the line, including an airball.\n\n“They’re definitely one of those teams who’ll be around late in the playoffs,” Curry said.\n\nBillups didn’t miss a shot until the 7:30 mark of the fourth. He had 13 assists at halftime.\n\n“Chauncey’s always good, always solid,” Marbury said. “They’ve got so many weapons, so many guys who know how to play.”\n\nBillups was smooth as silk in running the show.\n\n“It wasn’t who it was [Marbury], it was my mindset,” Billups said. “I wanted to come out and be aggressive.”\n\nThomas at least had it easy from the crowd. Detroit’s renowned heckler behind the Knick bench was all over the players but repeatedly screamed at Thomas, “You’re the greatest.”\n\n“It feels great,” Thomas said of the fan reaction. “No matter who I’m coaching, I always get a nice reception. People here have been very good to me.”\n\nWith the Knicks struggling using a small lineup – four guards and David Lee – they fell behind 14 points with 1:55 left in the third after Prince backed in Marbury for an easy turnaround. Thomas said he used the small lineup to push the pace because the Pistons were playing the back end of a back-to-back.\n\nThe Knicks slowly clawed back, even center Kelvin Cato making a rare contribution, hitting three of four free throws. The last two pulling the Knicks within 86-83 with 5:10 left. But Prince hit a huge 3-pointer to jack the lead to 89-83 and then Renaldo Balkman’s bounce pass was intercepted. They got within five points but no closer the rest of the way."
