        "text": "The most significant aspect of his return to Denver was the 2008-09 season, the best season in franchise history.\n\nBillups had been moved around a lot in his career, previously having stints in Boston, Toronto, Denver (the first time), Minnesota and most notably, Detroit where he won an NBA title and was named Finals MVP in 2004.\n\nNovember 3, 2008 will always be remembered as an interesting day in the history of two franchises, the Denver Nuggets and the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAllen Iverson joined the Pistons in a blockbuster trade, while Billups went the other way to Denver.\n\nBillups came to Detroit as a once promising player who hadn't realised his potential, he left as an All-Star, an NBA champion, a Finals MVP and an elite defender with a propensity for knocking down big shots.\n\nHe also left with an apt nickname, Mr Big Shot!\n\nThat trade in 2008 will always be viewed in a number of ways.\n\nDenver acquired Billups as a steadying influence to propel a promising young roster, Detroit acquired Iverson in rebuild mode with one potential run in them.\n\nThat run didn't eventuate in Detroit.\n\nFor Denver, the young core certainly propelled to a higher level.\n\nIt wasn't easy for Detroit to pull the trigger on trading their leader.\n\nPistons GM Joe Dumars said it was \"the hardest and toughest\" move he had made as a general manager.\n\nThings clicked for Denver in the 2008-09 season, reaching the conference finals for the first time since 1985.\n\nBillups averaged 17.9 points and 6.4 assists.\n\nThey were just two wins away from a finals berth.\n\nFor Billups, it was his seventh straight conference finals appearance, a remarkable feat.\n\nThe Pistons? They went in the other direction, failing to win a playoff series since.\n\nThe Nuggets won 54 games (matching the most wins for the franchise since their induction in the NBA), earning them the second seed in the Western Conference (the highest the team had ever been seeded for the playoffs).\n\nThe Nuggets eliminated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round in five games.\n\nDuring that series, Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with eight three-pointers in a playoff game.\n\nAgainst the Hornets, he averaged 22.6 points, 7.4 assists and 3.8 three-pointers made.\n\nDenver then eliminated Dallas in five games before setting up a conference finals meeting with the Lakers.\n\nThe Nuggets had a second half lead in each of the first five games, but won just two of them.\n\nThey would eventually fall in six games to the eventual champions.\n\nStill to this day, it's the closest the Nuggets have been to an NBA championship.\n\nWhile Billups had the best intentions to retire as a Nugget, he was traded to New York in 2011 as part of the Carmelo Anthony trade.\n\nA move that was met with disdain from the Denver fans.\n\nWhile things ended badly, Billups and the Nuggets will always look back fondly on that 2008-09 season.\n\nThe Nuggets were always viewed as a good team led by Anthony.\n\nThey weren't viewed as a great team because they continually struggled to make it out of the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThat changed when Billups and his tremendous leadership arrived.\n\nPlayers were instantly held accountable, on both ends of the floor.\n\nCarmelo was forced to play a team game and sacrifice some of his offence to help on the defensive end.\n\nThere were a number of individuals that Billups had to keep in check.\n\nThe likes of Anthony, Kenyon Martin and JR Smith.\n\nHe managed to do that while playing at an extraordinary high level.\n\nThere's no question that he became the leader as soon as he walked through the door.\n\nAs we look back on a great career, so much of the coverage will be of Billups' championship and success in Detroit, and it should be.\n\nBut you can make the case that the greatest achievement was turning an underachieving franchise into a winner."
