        "text": "The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame will induct Vince Carter and Chauncey Billups in its class of 2024, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nNBA icon Jerry West will be elected as a contributor to the game, sources told Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nThis will be West's third induction into the Hall of Fame - he was previously enshrined as a player in 1979 and as a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team in 2010.\n\nWest was appointed as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1982 and won six titles over his 18 years with the organization. During the 2002-03 season, West became the general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies and brought the club to its first-ever playoff appearance the following season. West will also be honored for his work as a consultant for the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nCarter played 22 seasons in the NBA - the most in league history - after being drafted fifth overall in 1998. He was Rookie of the Year with the Toronto Raptors in 1999 and won the iconic 2000 Slam Dunk contest. Carter was an eight-time All-Star and is 21st on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 25,728 points.\n\nBillups was a five-time All-Star during his 17-year career and is currently head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. After being selected third overall in the 1997 NBA Draft, Billups became a terrific two-way player, averaging 15.2 points and 5.4 assists while being named to two All-Defensive teams. The 6-foot-3 point guard was the Finals MVP when the Detroit Pistons won the 2004 NBA title.\n\nThe official announcement is expected to come Saturday, with the enshrinement weekend scheduled for Aug. 16-17."
