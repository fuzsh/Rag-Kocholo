        "text": "Written by; JURGEN CHILALA\n\nBiography\n\nJohannes Kepler was a German astronomer, mathematician, astrologer, natural philosopher and a music writer. He was born on the 27th December, 1517 in Weil der Stadt, Germany. Many consider him as the father of natural sciences and astronomy, while others refer to him as God’s mathematician or the scientist sent by God.\n\nEarly on in his life, before even turning five years old, Kepler had a disease called smallpox which destroyed his eyesight and rendered his hands to be unable to function properly. Another setback in Kepler’s early years of life was the death of his father, Henrich Kepler who was a mercenary soldier. Kepler spent most of his life with his mother Katharina Kepler and his grandmother. To survive, he served in the Inn where most customers were intrigued by the arithmetical capabilities that Kepler portrayed.\n\nDespite all the challenges that Kepler faced in his young age, Kepler was eager to learn and continued school with paramount belief in God while hoping his lifestyle could take a turn for the better. He got a scholarship and gained Admission at the University of Tubingen in 1589 where he was taught astronomy by one of the leading astronomers of the time, Michael Mastlin. His works in the field of science, Kepler’s works influenced other great scientist ever to tread the face of the earth. He influenced the likes of Isaac Newton, Thomas Browne, Edmond Halley and Royden Rabinowitch.\n\nAfter doing his marvelous works in the science industry, Kepler died at the age of 59 on the 15th of November, 1630 in Regensburg, Germany.\n\nHis Scientific works and His Belief in God.\n\nThroughout his lifetime, Kepler was radically a man who believed in God. He was a religious man. Almost all his writings contain several references to God. He believed that the work he was doing as a scientist were a fulfillment of his duties as a Christian to understand the marvelous works of God. Kepler Believed that Humanity was created in the image of God and therefore, every human being is capable of understanding the Universe created by God. In addition, Johannes Kepler believed that God created the Universe according to a Mathematical plan, a theory which Plato and Pythagoras both believed in, affiliated and wrote about in their works.\n\nAt that time, mathematics provided a secure route at reaching the truths about the world and it was generally accepted. This was a strategy of understanding the Universe. Throughout his works, Kepler repeatedly thanked God for granting him insights.\n\nHis Works\n\nKepler was pretty much all the labels he was tagged. He is famously known for the discovery of The Three Laws of Planetary Motion, which is later described in the article. Kepler Pioneered Crystallography, discovered important works in Optics (1604, 1611), discovered two New Polyhedral, he gave the first mathematical treatment of close parking of equal spheres which explains the shape of the cells in a honey comb (1611). Kepler issued the first proof of how Logarithms worked in 1624. He also devised the “methods of finding the volumes of solids of revolution” which has been seen to have played a role to the development of Calculus in 1615, 1616. Kepler was also a prolific writer in his era, amassing a total of 18 books which covered a wide variety of topics from Astronomy, to Physics explaining the Harmonies of the world, to wine barrels. His wide range of literature and achievements as a scientist chiefly advanced the scientific Revolution and set the stage for other prolific scientist such as Isaac Newton’s and his monumental works in the last years of the 17th century. At the time Kepler lived, few awards were given, however Kepler received several awards most notably the Tycho Brahe Prize.\n\nThe Three Laws of Planetary Motion.\n\nThis is regarded as Kopler’s most important idea. These carefully describe the orbits of planets around the sun. They can be best understood as;\n\nFirst Law; The Law of Orbits-\n\nIt states that, “All planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits having the sun at one of the foci”. There are two Foci; Perihelion and Aphelion.\n\nPerihelion- The point where the planet is proximal (close) to the sun. It is about 147 million Kilometers away from the sun.\n\nAphelion- The point where the planet distal (farther) from the sun. It is about 152 million Kilometers from the sun.\n\nThe Sum of the distances of any planet from the two foci is constant because it describes the shape of the planets elliptical orbit. For the orbits to be circular, the requirement is that the planet should travel at a particular constant velocity, which is pretty much unlikely. Any slight change leads to the orbit being elliptical. This theory is what many scientists use to defend the fact everything is mathematically calculated by God and not a mere coincidence.\n\nSecond Law; The Law of Equal Areas-\n\nIt states that “The radius vector drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time”. This means that the planets move faster when the closer to the sun and slower when farther. Because the orbits are elliptical and not circular it means that the velocity between the planet and the sun varies throughout its orbit. This will entail that the planet’s kinetic energy is not constant in its path (The Kinetic near the perihelion is more than the Kinetic Energy near the aphelion\n\nThird Law; The Law of Harmonies\n\nKepler put the Laws of periods as “The square of the time period of revolution a planet around the sun in an elliptical orbit is directly proportional to the cube of its semi major axis. This means that if the orbit is shorter, the time taken for one complete revolution will likewise be shorter. The Farther you are from the sun, the longer it takes to complete one orbit.\n\nThe Third Law provides fundamental understanding of the motion and dynamics of celestial Objects, enabling scientists and engineers to make important calculations and predictions in various fields of astronomy and space exploration.\n\nConclusion\n\nKepler’s mission and works have had a profound impact on our understanding of the science, mathematics and beyond. The laws have practical applications in various areas, from determining the masses of celestial bodies to the search of exoplanets and planning spacecraft missions.\n\nIt is worth noting that Kepler’s scientific pursuits were intertwined with his Christian beliefs. He saw his work as a way to uncover the divine order and harmony in the universe, reflecting his belief in a creator. Kepler Once said “I was merely thinking God’s thoughts after him,” emphasizing his conviction that studying the laws of nature was a way to understand and appreciate the work of God.\n\nKepler’s mission not only advanced our scientific knowledge but also highlighted the compatibility of science and faith. His contributions continue to inspire us to explore and uncover the mysteries of the universe while recognizing the beauty and order that exist within.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
