        "text": "In his Histoire de l’astronomie modern (II, 1785, p. 211), J. Bailly argued that the Jesuit astronomer Riccioli had not understood Kepler’s laws. This has been questioned (Russell 1964) and deserves consideration. Kepler’s astronomy must have been known in Jesuit circles and Riccioli could have studied it. He played a role in the comprehension and dissemination of Kepler’s works, at least in the Italian context. Riccioli seriously discussed Kepler’s Epitome astronomiæ copernicanæ in his Almagestum novum, and he gave Kepler more importance than Copernicus or Galilei. In this paper, we will see how Riccioli understood and used Kepler’s first law. Particularly, Riccioli well explained how Kepler solved the variability of planetary motion and how he described the planetary trajectories by the half division of eccentricity. We will show how Riccioli integrated the ellipse in his geometrical model of cosmos.\n\nIt has long been conventional to associate the scientific revolution with Copernicus’s De revolutionibus (1543). This essay argues in contrast that Kepler’s Astronomia nova (1609) marks the transformation of science, and especially astronomy, from the ancient and medieval heritage to the modern era. However, Kepler’s extraordinary accomplishment has been lost in contradictory historiographies that do not appreciate Kepler’s unifying theological approach to astronomy.\n\nI will analyze how a natural philosopher, according to Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), can move from phenomena to knowledge of a priori causes, those causes included in the divine “idea” of the world. By doing so, I hope to enlarge upon recent studies that discuss the influence of regressus-style logic on Kepler’s natural philosophy. The first part of this article will focus on Kepler’s influences at Tübingen and on the preface to the first edition of the Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596). The preface is an important document. In it, Kepler presents his own narrative of discovery. In the second half of the article, I will jump to his last a priori works, those published around 1620. I will argue that these add a level of detail and precision to the a priori method first presented in the Mysterium. I will end by considering the 1621 edition of the Mysterium, showing how Kepler strongly clarifies the limits of geometry in his natural philosophy.\n\nWe investigate the close relationships between the astronomical and scientific work of the famous great astronomer Johannes Kepler and the major scientific in general, and astronomical in particular, achievements that took place within the Hellenistic period and the Alexandrian epoch that followed immediately, that is from the Battle of Actium until the death of the scholar and polymath Hypatia. We propose that the Hellenistic Philosophy and Science, as being developed by Giants of Mind, such as Hipparhus of Rhodes, Archimedes of Syracuse, Aristarchus of Samos, Apollonius of Perga, Menelaus of Alexandria, Euclid of Alexandria, Ptolemy of Alexandria, and by philosophers such as Plotinus and Proclus, as well as all the other Neoplatonic philosophers of this era, instills and permeates Kepler’s philosophical view of Cosmos, and at the same time sets the guidelines and paves the way of his lifelong scientific endeavor upon discovering and determining the true laws of planetary motion wi..."
