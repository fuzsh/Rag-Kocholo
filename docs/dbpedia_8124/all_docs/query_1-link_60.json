        "text": "Kepler achieved his breakthrough by giving up one of the most cherished Greek ideas â€” the perfect symmetry of a circular orbit. He did not do this lightly. It took him eight years of analysis and hundreds of pages of calculations to be sure of his conclusion. However, his insight allowed him to dramatically simplify the description of planetary orbits. Within the Ptolemaic model, the accurate data of Tycho could only be matched using circular orbits by adding many epicycles. Ironically, the Copernican model also needed epicycles to fit the data equally well. The problem is that the motion of the planets is not uniform, but a circular orbit produces uniform motion regardless of whether the Earth or the Sun is at the center. Kepler avoided the contortion of epicycles by having a single ellipse to describe the orbit of each planet. His results did not fit the geocentric theory of Ptolemy, but they fit beautifully the heliocentric hypothesis of Copernicus."
