        "text": "Pythagoras\n\n(fl second half of the 6th century BCE). Greek philosopher and religious teacher. Born on Samos, he emigrated to Croton in 531 and later settled in Metapontum in southern Italy; both moves may have been caused by political or religious persecution. He believed in the transmigration of souls, established a bios (way of life), was probably a religious leader at Croton, and emphasized the numerical underpinnings of the natural world. An extreme version of Pythagorean doctrine holds that the physical world is a material working out (representation) of numerical truth, and that this truth is immediately and easily apprehended, albeit superficially, in elementary musical consonances.\n\nPythagorasÕs teachings, prominently publicized by PHILOLAUS (fl second half of the 5th century BCE) and further promulgated by ARCHYTAS OF TARENTUM (fl first half of the 4th century BCE), were well known to Plato and Aristotle, by whose time Pythagoras was already a legendary figure. During the 5th century the Pythagorean community split into a scientific branch (mathēmatikoi) and a more conservative and religious one (akismatikoi). In later antiquity PythagorasÕs teachings were revived and mingled with those of Plato by Nicomachus, Iamblichus, Proclus and others. Fragments of writings on music by Philolaus and Archytas are preserved in the writings of later authors. More extended presentations of Pythagorean musical doctrine are found in the Euclidean Division of the Canon (see EUCLID), the Manual of Harmonics by NICOMACHUS OF GERASA and the Harmonic Introduction of GAUDENTIUS. Ancient commentaries on Pythagorean music theory, some of it critical, occurs in PtolemyÕs Harmonics (see PTOLEMY, CLAUDIUS) and PorphyryÕs commentary on Ptolemy (see PORPHYRY), Theon of SmyrnaÕs On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato (see THEON OF SMYRNA) and Aristides QuintilianusÕs On Music (see ARISTIDES QUINTILIANUS). Boethius (in De institutione musica) and other Latin writers translated Neopythagorean doctrine into Latin and transmitted it to the Western medieval world.\n\nCertainly the most remarkable achievement attributed to Pythagoras is the discovery of the general geometric theorem that bears his name: that the square on the diagonal of a right-angle triangle equals the sum of the squares on the sides. PythagorasÕs importance for music lies in his purported establishment of the numerical basis of acoustics. On passing a blacksmithÕs shop, he is said to have heard hammers of different weights striking consonant and dissonant intervals (Nicomachus, Manual of Harmonics, vi). He discovered that musical consonances were represented by the ratios that could be obtained from the musical tetractys: 1, 2, 3, 4. The ratios are relations of string lengths or frequencies. Thus 4:1 corresponds to the double octave; 3:1 to the octave plus the 5th; 2:1 (and 4:2) to the octave; 4:3 to the 4th; and 3:2 to the 5th. It follows that the interval of a whole tone – the difference between the 5th and 4th – is expressed by the ratio 9:8. A Pythagorean scale consists of 4ths subdivided into two tones plus the remainder or LIMMA (256:243). A 4th plus a 5th equals an octave. This scale is systematically presented in the Euclidean Division of the Canon, which may also contain a quotation from Pythagoras regarding the origin of sound. A necessary result of such a scale is that six whole-tone intervals exceed an octave by a small interval known as the Pythagorean comma (531,441:524,288).\n\nPythagorean music theory rests on the theory of numerical ratios presented in books 7–9 of EuclidÕs Elements of Geometry and given philosophical interpretation by Nicomachus in his Introductio arithmetica. The fundamental principle of consonance for the Pythagoreans, as set forth in the Division of the Canon, holds that notes are made up of parts; pitch is raised or lowered through the addition or subtraction of percussions. Things composed of parts are related by numerical ratios, which are either multiple (i.e. the greater term contains the lesser exactly a given number of times), superparticular (the greater term contains the lesser plus one part of the lesser), superpartient (the greater contains the lesser plus more that one part of the lesser), multiple superparticular or multiple superpartient. Tacitly assuming the tetractys, the Division asserts that all consonant intervals are either multiple or superparticular.\n\nPythagorean doctrine also embraces theories of human harmony (between body and soul) and cosmic harmony. Book 3 of PtolemyÕs Harmonics and book 3 of Aristides QuintilianusÕs On Music treat both human and cosmic harmony at length. According to the theory of the harmony of the spheres (see MUSIC OF THE SPHERES), the distances from the earth to the visible planets and sun, as well as the speeds with which the celestial bodies circle the earth, are in the same ratios as various musical intervals, especially those of the diatonic scale. PlatoÕs Timaeus mentions the Pythagorean scale and contains (in chaps.xxxv–xxxvi) an early, vivid exposition of the theory of cosmic harmony, combining diatonic organization with the two fundamental celestial motions, same and other. The myth of Er, related at the end of PlatoÕs Republic (x, 614–18) also reflects Pythagorean influence. The pairing of Greek note names with celestial bodies varies from author to author (compare, for example, Nicomachus, Manual of Harmonics, iii, with Ptolemy, Harmonics, iii.16). Johannes Kepler made a late, complex investigation of the harmony of the spheres in Harmonices mundi (1619). See also ARISTOXENUS and GREECE, ¤I, 6(I).\n\nBibliography\n\nSearch RILM\n\nW.

Greek music theorist, philosopher and writer. According to the Suda he was the son of a musician called Mnesias or Spintharus who gave him his early musical education. It is not known to which philosophical or musical school Mnesias belonged, but he may have been one of the Pythagoreans whose political influence had been dominant in Magna Graecia, particularly in Tarentum, with which Archytas had long been associated. Mnesias could have known a number of prominent figures both in Magna Graecia and in Athens: the musicians Archytas, Damon and Philoxenus, as well as Socrates and perhaps even the Theban general Epaminondas. Aristoxenus himself followed the teachings of Lampros of Erythrae, and then, in Athens, of Xenophilus the Pythagorean. He spent most of his life in Greece. A fragment of one of his works indicates that he lived for some time at Mantinea in Arcadia, where music, which was held in high esteem, was subject to the kind of conservative laws that appealed to his austerity and love of ancient traditions.\n\nAt some unspecified date Aristoxenus renounced Pythagorean doctrines, although he retained his admiration for Archytas, whose biography he wrote. He then followed the teachings of Aristotle and seems to have become one of the masterÕs most eminent disciples, for Aristotle apparently considered appointing him his successor as head of the Lyceum. When Theophrastus gained the post instead, Aristoxenus broke with the school entirely and began teaching on his own account, concentrating mainly on music. However, he evidently did not reject the Aristotelian doctrines, because authors in antiquity consistently described him as a Ôfollower of AristotleÕ. As a pure first-generation Peripatetic, Aristoxenus brought the new science of music into the Lyceum, the Ôstudio of all the artsÕ.\n\nAristoxenus was a prolific author with many interests: as well as writing on education and music he also produced biographies and histories of institutions. The Suda credits him with 453 works, although this is surely an exaggeration. Only 139 fragments of his memoranda, miscellanea and other small works have survived (ed. Wehrli); these reveal his interest not only in the theory of harmonics and rhythm, but also (unusually for a Greek theorist) in the history of music, musicians and musical institutions.\n\nAristoxenusÕs principal work, the one that gained him the reputation of supreme mousikos throughout antiquity, was the treatise On Harmonics, which has come down to us under the probably erroneous title Harmonic Elements (Harmonika stoicheia). It is the oldest work of music theory written in Greek to have been preserved in substantial fragments, and was the first part of a larger work On Music, in which the author studied the various branches of the subject, in particular rhythm. Only fragments of the Rhythmic Elements have survived, either through quotations by later authors (Aristides Quintilianus and more particularly Michael Psellus, an 11th-century Byzantine writer), or through papyri; it is possible that POxy 9 + 2687 contains part of the Rhythmic Elements.\n\nIn so far as the history of musical thought in ancient times is concerned, the doctrines of Aristoxenus represent an epistemological revolution whose importance was acknowledged by all later theorists, whether they agreed with him or not. Before him, the Pythagoreans (such as Philolaus and Archytas) and the Platonists had regarded the science of music as part of mathematics. Aristoxenus, on the other hand, believed that music should be an autonomous discipline, one entirely separate from arithmetic and astronomy. No longer could music be a matter of calculating intervals expressed by the relationship of two numbers, for its concern is not mathematical entities but sound, and musical sound as distinct from noise or the sounds of spoken language. Its tools are rational thought (dianoia) and auditory sensation (akoē and aisthēsis). Reason establishes musical principles through the investigation of theorems (problēmata), some of which are also the subject of demonstrations. As for auditory sensation, Aristoxenus was the first musical theorist to insist on the necessity of training the ear to make hearing more precise, and on the control to be exercised over it by rational thought. On this basis he constructed a science of music whose methods, terminology and principles derive directly from Aristotelian scientific doctrines.\n\nThe first part of the Harmonic Elements is an examination by Aristoxenus of the doctrines of his predecessors; he proves to be highly critical, less on points of detail than on the actual foundations of their teachings. He criticized the Pythagoreans (without naming them) for regarding intervals not as pure musical entities but as numerical ratios, which are superparticular when they ÔdefineÕ consonant intervals: octave (2:1), 5th (3:2), 4th (4:3) and tone (9:8). For Aristoxenus, music consisted of sounds structurally organized within a sound-space, and the function of the science of harmonics was to describe and regulate their spatial and dynamic relations. Unlike the Pythagoreans, he postulated and demonstrated that the tone can be divided into two equal semitones, not a limma (leimma) in the ratio 256:243 and an apotomē in the ratio 2187:2048. He also took the exact semitone as the unit of measurement for all musical intervals, and he differed from the Harmonicists, whose diagrams exhibit 28 consecutive dieses, which are devoid of any musical reality since more than two quarter-tones are never heard in succession.\n\nAristoxenus himself endeavoured to describe the musical system in all its coherence and complexity, setting out from the simplest of entities (musical sound) and proceeding to increasingly complex combinations of intervals and ÔsystemsÕ, envisaged simultaneously according to their ÔrangeÕ, ÔdispositionÕ and ÔfunctionÕ. The last part of the treatise is a set of theorems setting out the laws of harmonics. Aristoxenus was the first to formulate the concept of the genus (genos), defined by the position of the two movable notes within a tetrachord (spanning the interval of a 4th), which divide it into three intervals of varying sizes. He described three genera: the enharmonic (Ôthe oldest and finestÕ), the chromatic and the diatonic. The enharmonic tetrachord consists of a ditone followed by two quarter-tones, moving from top to bottom; the chromatic – a tone-and-a-half, a semitone and a semitone; and the diatonic – a tone, a tone and a semitone. The chromatic and diatonic genera permit ÔcolorationÕ or ÔnuancesÕ (chroai) in which the extent of the intervals varies within limits set out by Aristoxenus.\n\nFinally Aristoxenus defined the tonoi, a term probably of his own coining and destined to replace the old concept of harmonia. On approaching this important subject he rejected all the classifications and dispositions advanced by his predecessors and proceeded Ôfrom basicsÕ, with a view to bringing order to the confusion then prevalent in music. The tonoi are related to the positions of the voice Ôin which each of the systēmes is placed in singing a melodyÕ. In other words, the tonoi represent transpositions of the scales.\n\nUnfortunately the passage in which Aristoxenus enumerated the tonoi has not survived. Their names as given by Cleonides are: Hypermixolydian (also called Hyperphrygian), high and low Mixolydian (also respectively called Hyperiastian and Hyperdorian), high and low Lydian (the low also called Aeolian), high and low Phrygian (the low also called Iastian), Dorian, high and low Hypolydian (the low also called Hypoaeolian), high and low Hypophrygian (the low also called Hypoiastian) and Hypodorian. They are grouped on the principle of the ÔaffinityÕ of their tones, allowing modulation from one to the other with more or less ease. They are not, therefore, modes, as has so often been thought, but transposition scales rising from semitone to semitone.\n\nAristoxenus excluded musical practice and in particular musical composition from the science of harmonics, and consequently anything to do with musical notation, on the grounds that such subjects involve skill (technē) and not science (epistēmē).\n\nMany Greek and Latin writers on music, including CLEONIDES and GAUDENTIUS, were directly inspired by the writings of Aristoxenus. Those theorists belonging to schools of philosophy opposed to the Aristoxenian musical doctrines tried either to refute them or, like THEON OF SMYRNA and PTOLEMY, to integrate certain of the demands of Aristoxenus into their own theories. However, such a reconciliation of doctrines constructed on irreconcilable principles could never be entirely successful.\n\nFrom what has survived of the Rhythmic Elements, it seems that Aristoxenus had adopted the same approach to rhythm as to harmonics: the determination of a small number of basic ÔprinciplesÕ, the choice of a unit of measurement (the Ôprimary timeÕ – prōtos chronos), the choice of criteria (hearing and judgment), and the articulation of the constituent elements of rhythm. Aristoxenus was the first to distinguish rhythmics from metrics, and he seems also to have been the first to write on the mutual relationship of musical durations, fundamentally distinct from words, melody or gesture, which were things that can be Ôset in rhythm (ta rhuthmizomena)Õ.\n\nSee also GREECE, ¤I, 6(III).\n\nWritings\n\nH.S.

Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer and music theorist. He probably had access to an observatory at Alexandria, where he spent his working life. His major work, on mathematics and astronomy, was the Almagest (Arabic, al-majistī; Ptolemy's original title was Mathēmatikē suntaxis); a compendium of the work of earlier Greek astronomers, it describes a geocentric universe.\n\nHis three-volume Harmonics (Harmonika), written during the mid-2nd century, constitutes the most learned and lucid exposition of music theory in antiquity, its logical, systematic comprehensiveness making it a Ôworthy counterpartÕ to the Almagest (Dring). In it Ptolemy discusses the principles and purposes of the theory of harmonics (i.1–2); the principles of acoustics (i.3–4); the theory of intervals, with a critique of the theory of the Pythagorean and Aristoxenian schools (i.5–11); the theory of the genera, with a critique of various divisions of the tetrachord (i.12–ii.1); a description of the helicon (a geometrical instrument devised, like the monochord, for measuring interval ratios using stretched strings; ii.2); the theory of 4th, 5th and octave species (ii.3); the Perfect System (systēma teleion) and the derivation of modes by transposition or modulation, with a critique of the Aristoxenian theory of tonoi (ii.4–11); a description of the monochord (ii.12–13); tables of the genera and the ÔmixturesÕ (migmata) of genera usual in practice (ii.14–15); the use of the 15-string ÔmonochordÕ (iii.1–2); comparisons of the relationships between notes and the parts of the human soul (iii.3–7) and between the heavenly bodies, with tables (iii.8–16). An inscription from Canopus (Heiberg, ii, 149ff) draws a more detailed comparison between the planets and elements on the one hand, and the outer notes of tetrachords and their related numbers on the other.\n\nPtolemy's basic postulate was that the two criteria of judgment or reason and empirical observation should not contradict each other. Believing sense perception to be fallible, he discovered in the monochord, which enables acoustic phenomena to be expressed in visual, geometric terms, a precise scientific instrument by which to measure the numerical ratios of consonances. He therefore conceived of music theory in terms of precise mathematical calculation.\n\nCiting such authorities as DIDYMUS on the difference between the Pythagorean and Aristoxenian theories of music, he criticized the Pythagoreans for frequently postulating theoretical relationships that do not correspond with reality; on the other hand he criticized the Aristoxenians for designating intervals by diastēma (Ôdistance apartÕ, i.e. by summation; see GREECE, ¤I, 6(III)) rather than in terms of precise mathematical ratios.\n\nThe Pythagoreans are attacked for defining in different ways intervals smaller and greater than the octave. For example, Ptolemy claims that they wrongly excluded the 11th (8:3) from the consonances while admitting the 4th (4:3), because the 11th was a ratio neither multiple (i.e. in the form nx : x) nor superparticular (i.e. in the form (x + 1) : x, where x is a positive integer): these were the mathematical formulae favoured by the Pythagoreans to define consonances.\n\nPtolemy arranged intervals between notes of definite but unequal pitch (anisotonoi) according to the simplicity of their ratios, as homophōnoi, or multiple ratios (e.g. the octave, 2:1, or the double octave, 4:1); sumphōnoi, or the first two non-multiple superparticular ratios (the 4th, 4:3, and the 5th, 3:2) and their octave extensions (the 11th, 2:1 × 4:3 = 8:3, and the 12th, 2:1 × 3:2 = 3:1); and finally emmeleis (Ôin the melosÕ, i.e. melodically useful), or the superparticular ratios according to the formula above where x is greater than 3, for example, the whole tone (9:8). He also proved mathematically and acoustically that the Aristoxenians wrongly defined the 4th as two and a half whole tones and the octave as six whole tones.\n\nSimilarly, in examining the classifications of the tetrachord by his predecessors, he showed that the results they obtained had not been confirmed by empirical observation. After citing the classifications of Archytas, Eratosthenes, Didymus and Aristoxenus, he calculated his own tetrachords, using superparticular ratios, as follows:\n\nOne enharmonic tetrachord: 5:4 × 24:23 × 46:45\n\nTwo chromatic tetrachords: the ÔsoftÕ (chrōma malakon) – 6:5 × 15:14 × 28:27 ; and the ÔhighÕ or ÔtenseÕ (chrōma syntonon) – 7:6 × 12:11 × 22:21\n\nThree diatonic tetrachords: the ÔtenseÕ (diatonon syntonon) – 10:9 × 9:8 × 16:15; the ÔsoftÕ (diatonon malakon) – 8:7 × 10:9 × 21:20; and the ÔevenÕ (diatonon homalon) – 10:9 × 11:10 × 12:11\n\nThe enharmonic tetrachord entails the pure 3rd (5:4) of Archytas and Didymus. The divisions of the ÔsoftÕ and ÔtenseÕ chromatic tetrachords are probably very close to the corresponding divisions in Aristoxenus's genera of the same name. Of the diatonic tetrachords, the ÔtenseÕ adapts the ratios of Didymus by exchanging the order of the two upper intervals, and the ÔsoftÕ is a counterpart, though differing in some respects, to Aristoxenus's ÔsoftÕ diatonic tetrachord; the ÔevenÕ includes a harmonic division by three into intervals of three-quarters of a tone, as in the archaic spondeion scale.\n\nPtolemy also discusses tuning in instrumental practice, using different genera in the two tetrachords of one octave. Whereas the lyre has two tunings, sterea (ÔhardÕ, ?diatonic) and malaka (ÔsoftÕ, ?chromatic), the kithara has six different tunings, called tropoi (in the Hypodorian mode), iasti-aiolia (Hypophrygian), hypertropa (Phrygian), tritai (Hypodorian), parhypatai (Dorian) and lydia (Dorian). Ptolemy's association of them with the ethnic names of the modes suggests that they were commonly used in the imperial era.\n\nFor the derivation of the octave species, Ptolemy used a ÔmonochordÕ with one string for each of the 15 notes of the double octave making up the Perfect System. The notes can be identified by thesis, that is, their absolute position on the strings, or by dunamis, their function relative to other notes within the mode in question.\n\nIn discussing metabolē (ÔchangeÕ, including transposition and modulation) Ptolemy distinguishes between a simple transposition of a whole melody to another pitch while retaining the same intervals within it, and a more basic ÔmodulationÕ of part of the melody, involving a new sequence of intervals and, thus, a change of genus (see METABOLĒ). Only the second of these is true modulation, and it alters the ethos.\n\nInstead of the 13 (or 15) transpositional notes, a semitone apart, of the Aristoxenian school, Ptolemy's system consists of seven tonoi, each spanning a complete octave. These are derived from the three oldest modes (Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian) with the aid of a cycle of 4ths, the result of which is a sequence of modes pitched either a whole tone (1) or a semitone (½) apart, in the following order: Mixolydian – (½) – Lydian – (1) – Phrygian – (1) – Dorian – (½) – Hypolydian – (1) – Hypophrygian – (1) – Hypodorian. Since the notes mesē in each are tuned in the middle octave e–e′, Ptolemy's transpositional notes correspond to an octave species.\n\nThe Harmonics culminates in a metaphysical discussion, largely on Pythagorean and Platonic lines, of the music of the spheres. Ptolemy draws various analogies between the relationships of the elements of music and those of the human soul (the microcosm) and the movements of the planets (the macrocosm). For instance, he compares the intervals named by him symphōnoi to the parts of the soul, the genera to the virtues and the Perfect System to the ecliptic. His last chapter, which is fragmentary, contains astrological speculations about the characteristics of planets and musical notes.\n\nA century after the composition of the Harmonics, the Neoplatonic philosopher PORPHYRY wrote an informative commentary on it, referring to Ptolemy's sources and giving his own evaluation of many earlier authors. He took particular pleasure in discussing such distinctions as the quantities and qualities of notes. The Harmonics was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and two important Byzantine (Greek) editions were made by Nicephorus Gregoras (c1335) and his pupil Isaac Argyrus, the former including Gregoras's own emendations and original material, interlinear glosses and scholia (annotations).\n\nThe various theories put forward by Ptolemy greatly influenced the Byzantine theorists Georgios Pachymeres and Manuel Bryennius, and his influence also extended to Western Europe, where he was known in the Middle Ages chiefly through Boethius's De institutione musica. His musical and astronomical systems were still current in Kepler's writing. The edition of A. Gogavinus's Latin translation (Venice, 1562) by Wallis was exemplary in its day; the standard modern edition is that of Dring, and is based on 84 manuscripts.\n\nSee also GREECE, ¤I, 6 (III)(E).\n\nWritings\n\nJ.
