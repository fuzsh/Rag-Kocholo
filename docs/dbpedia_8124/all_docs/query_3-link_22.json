        "text": "We investigate the close relationships between the astronomical and scientific work of the famous great astronomer Johannes Kepler and the major scientific in general, and astronomical in particular, achievements that took place within the Hellenistic period and the Alexandrian epoch that followed immediately, that is from the Battle of Actium until the death of the scholar and polymath Hypatia. We propose that the Hellenistic Philosophy and Science, as being developed by Giants of Mind, such as Hipparhus of Rhodes, Archimedes of Syracuse, Aristarchus of Samos, Apollonius of Perga, Menelaus of Alexandria, Euclid of Alexandria, Ptolemy of Alexandria, and by philosophers such as Plotinus and Proclus, as well as all the other Neoplatonic philosophers of this era, instills and permeates Keplerâ€™s philosophical view of Cosmos, and at the same time sets the guidelines and paves the way of his lifelong scientific endeavor upon discovering and determining the true laws of planetary motion wi...\n\nPrevious \"Derivations\" are really \"Mathematical Proofs\" of Orbital behaviour. This paper explains HOW Kepler's 1st and 2nd Laws are produced by the properties or physics of the space fabric and gravity. It seems impossible to separate this paper on the Conservation and Restoration of Space from the Derivation of Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion. That no doubt is why it has remained undiscovered until now. There is no discrepancy between this and Einstein's theory of Gravity. (16July 2022)"
