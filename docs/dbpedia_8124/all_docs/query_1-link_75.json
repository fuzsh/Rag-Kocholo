        "text": "The original society in Crotona was attacked by the Sybaris and subsequently abandoned. Many of the followers, particularly Philolao, continued work in mathematics around the ancient world. The society had lasted for about 200 years, but its influence would last much longer. Plato and Aristotle, as well as Johannes Kepler, are said to have been greatly influenced by them."
