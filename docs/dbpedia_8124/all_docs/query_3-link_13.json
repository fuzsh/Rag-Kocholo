        "text": "\"In the celestial mechanics we know Kepler's First Law: The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. We simply draw circles into the focuses of this ellipse where the circles are equal to the diameter of the Sun. In other words, we duplicate the Sun’s disc into the second focus (fig. 1.) The new approach is that the second focus of the ellipse can be represented by the same Sun symbol as well, regardless of the fact that there is no actual celestial body at this point. In this way we can create a cosmos model, where two Sun symbols coexist (not two actual Sun). The assumption is that the Twin-Sun cosmos model has been known well before Kepler’s age. This idea is perfectly identical to the modern scientific world-concept.\"\n\nWe investigate the close relationships between the astronomical and scientific work of the famous great astronomer Johannes Kepler and the major scientific in general, and astronomical in particular, achievements that took place within the Hellenistic period and the Alexandrian epoch that followed immediately, that is from the Battle of Actium until the death of the scholar and polymath Hypatia. We propose that the Hellenistic Philosophy and Science, as being developed by Giants of Mind, such as Hipparhus of Rhodes, Archimedes of Syracuse, Aristarchus of Samos, Apollonius of Perga, Menelaus of Alexandria, Euclid of Alexandria, Ptolemy of Alexandria, and by philosophers such as Plotinus and Proclus, as well as all the other Neoplatonic philosophers of this era, instills and permeates Kepler’s philosophical view of Cosmos, and at the same time sets the guidelines and paves the way of his lifelong scientific endeavor upon discovering and determining the true laws of planetary motion wi...\n\nThis paper shows how the Pythagoreans regarded numbers as more real than mere matter and as having a qualitative nature. 'One' is not seen as a number but as the source of number, while 'Two' reflects the differentiation inherent in nature and indicates the possibility of relationship. 'Three' and 'Four' are seen as the first real odd number and the first real even number respectively. In English, as in Greek, the word 'odd' has a bad sense but this is not the case in Pythagoreanism which, as a result of its Egyptian origins, gives 'odd' numbers a good sense. 'Ten', as found in the Tetraktys, excludes the use of the concept of zero and represents the totality and the completion of number. The Tetraktys, as the source of cosmic wholeness, has musical, geometrical, and arithmetical dimensions."
