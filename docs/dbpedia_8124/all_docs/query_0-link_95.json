        "text": "Kahn's excellent knowledge of the texts is apparent and his familiarity with the scholarly literature is manifest. . . . The volume is attractively written and and produced, and will do a real service in making the Pythagorean tradition . . . accessible to non-specialists. --Richard McKirahan, Philosophy in Review\n\nThis book provides an excellent overview of the development of Pythagorean theory after Pythagoras. Kahn's narrative is lucid and his judgment reliable. . . . This brief survey is admirably comprehensive in its treatment of Pythagorean influences. --Daniel W. Graham, Ancient Philosophy\n\nThis book, written by one of the world's leading authorities on ancient philosophy, combines a lucid overview of the broad sweep of the Pythagorean tradition, appropriate for readers new to the subject, with new scholarly insights, which will make it essential reading for scholars as well. There really is no comparable up-to-date volume available in English. It is a wonderful book. --Carl Huffman, DePauw University"
