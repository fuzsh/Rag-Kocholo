        "text": "A history of man’s changing vision of the Universe\n\nby Arthur Koestler\n\nPREFACE\n\nIN the index to the six hundred odd pages of Arnold Toynbee’s A Study of History, abridged version, the names of Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes and Newton do not occur. 1 This one example among many should be sufficient to indicate the gulf that still separates the Humanities from the Philosophy of Nature. I use this outmoded expression because the term “Science”, which has come to replace it in more recent times, does not carry the same rich and universal associations which “Natural Philosophy” carried in the seventeenth century, in the days when Kepler wrote his Harmony of the World and Galileo his Message from the Stars. Those men who created the upheaval which we now call the “Scientific Revolution” called it by a quite different name: the “New Philosophy”. The revolution in technology which their discoveries triggered off was an unexpected by-product; their aim was not the conquest of Nature, but the understanding of Nature. Yet their cosmic quest destroyed the mediaeval vision of an immutable social order in a walled-in universe together with its fixed hierarchy of moral values, and transformed the European landscape, society, culture, habits and general outlook, as thoroughly as if a new species had arisen on this planet.\n\nThis mutation of the European mind in the seventeenth century is merely the latest example of the impact of the “Sciences” on the “Humanities” – of the inquiry into the nature of Nature on the inquiry into the nature of Man. It also illustrates the wrongheadedness of erecting academic and social barriers between the two; a fact which is at last beginning to gain recognition, nearly half a millennium after the Renaissance discovered the uomo universale.\n\nAnother result of this fragmentation is that there exist Histories of Science, which tell one at what date the mechanical clock or the law of inertia made their first appearance, and Histories of Astronomy which inform one that the precession of the equinoxes was discovered by Hipparchus of Alexandria; but, surprisingly, there exists to my knowledge no modern History of Cosmology, no comprehensive survey of man’s changing vision of the universe which encloses him.\n\nThe above explains what this book is aiming at, and what it is trying to avoid. It is not a history of astronomy, though astronomy comes in where it is needed to bring the vision into sharper focus; and, though aimed at the general reader, it is not a book of “popular science” but a personal and speculative account of a controversial subject. It opens with the Babylonians and ends with Newton, because we still live in an essentially Newtonian universe; the cosmology of Einstein is as yet in a fluid state, and it is too early to assess its influence on culture. To keep the vast subject within manageable limits, I could attempt only an outline. It is sketchy in parts, detailed in others, because selection and emphasis of the material was guided by my interest in certain specific questions, which are the leitmotifs of the book, and which I must briefly set out here.\n\nFirstly, there are the twin threads of Science and Religion, starting with the undistinguishable unity of the mystic and the savant in the Pythagorean Brotherhood, falling apart and reuniting again, now tied up in knots, now running on parallel courses, and ending in the polite and deadly “divided house of faith and reason” of our day, where, on both sides, symbols have hardened into dogmas, and the common source of inspiration is lost from view. A study of the evolution of cosmic awareness in the past may help to find out whether a new departure is at least conceivable, and on what lines.\n\nSecondly, I have been interested, for a long time, in the psychological process of discovery 2 as the most concise manifestation of man’s creative faculty – and in that converse process that blinds him towards truths which, once perceived by a seer, become so heartbreakingly obvious. Now this blackout shutter operates not only in the minds of the “ignorant and superstitious masses” as Galileo called them, but is even more strikingly evident in Galileo’s own, and in other geniuses like Aristotle, Ptolemy or Kepler. It looks as if, while part of their spirit was asking for more light, another part had been crying out for more darkness. The History of Science is a relative newcomer on the scene, and the biographers of its Cromwells and Napoleons are as yet little concerned with psychology; their heroes are mostly represented as reasoning-machines on austere marble pedestals, in a manner long outdated in the mellower branches of historiography – probably on the assumption that in the case of a Philosopher of Nature, unlike that of a statesman or conqueror, character and personality are irrelevant. Yet all cosmological systems, from the Pythagoreans to Copernicus, Descartes and Eddington, reflect the unconscious prejudices, the philosophical or even political bias of their authors; and from physics to physiology, no branch of Science, ancient or modern, can boast freedom from metaphysical bias of one kind or another. The progress of Science is generally regarded as a kind of clean, rational advance along a straight ascending line; in fact it has followed a zig-zag course, at times almost more bewildering than the evolution of political thought. The history of cosmic theories, in particular, may without exaggeration be called a history of collective obsessions and controlled schizophrenias; and the manner in which some of the most important individual discoveries were arrived at reminds one more of a sleepwalker’s performance than an electronic brain’s.\n\nThus, in taking down Copernicus or Galileo from the pedestal on which science-mythography has placed them, my motive was not to “debunk”, but to inquire into the obscure workings of the creative mind. Yet I shall not be sorry if, as an accidental by-product, the inquiry helps to counteract the legend that Science is a purely rational pursuit, that the Scientist is a more “level-headed” and “dispassionate” type than others (and should therefore be given a leading part in world affairs); or that he is able to provide for himself and his contemporaries, a rational substitute for ethical insights derived from other sources.\n\nIt was my ambition to make a difficult subject accessible to the general reader, but students familiar with it will, I hope, nevertheless find some new information in these pages. This refers mainly to Johannes Kepler, whose works, diaries and correspondence have so far not been accessible to the English reader; nor does a serious English biography exist. Yet Kepler is one of the few geniuses who enables one to follow, step by step, the tortuous path that led him to his discoveries, and to get a really intimate glimpse, as in a slow-motion film, of the creative act. He accordingly occupies a key-position in the narrative.\n\nCopernicus’ magnum opus, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, also had to wait until 1952 for a first English translation – which perhaps explains certain curious misunderstandings about his work, shared by practically all authorities who have written on the subject, and which I have tried to rectify.\n\nThe general reader is advised not to bother about the Notes at the end of the book; on the other hand, the reader with a scientific education is asked to forbear with explanations which might seem an insult to his intelligence. So long as in our educational system a state of cold war is maintained between the Sciences and the Humanities, this predicament cannot be avoided.\n\nOne significant step towards ending this cold war was Professor Herbert Butterfield Origins of Modern Science, first published in 1949. Apart from the work’s profundity and excellence per se, I was much impressed by the fact that the Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge should venture into mediaeval Science and undertake such a gulf-bridging task. Perhaps this age of specialists is in need of creative trespassers. It was this shared conviction which made me ask Professor Butterfield for the favour of a short Introduction to another trespassing venture.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMy sincere thanks are due to Professor Max Caspar, Munich, and to Bibliotheksrat Dr. Franz Hammer, Stuttgart, for help and advice on Johannes Kepler; to Dr. Marjorie Grene for her help on mediaeval Latin sources and various other problems; to Professor Zdenek Kopal, University of Manchester, for his critical reading of the text; to Professor Alexandre Koyré, École des Hautes Études, Sorbonne, and Professor Ernst Zinner, Bamberg, for information quoted in the Notes; to Professor Michael Polanyi for his sympathetic interest and encouragement; lastly to Miss Cynthia Jefferies for her unending patient labours on the typescript and galleys.\n\nPART ONE THE HEROIC AGE\n\nI DAWN\n\n1. Awakening\n\nWE can add to our knowledge, but we cannot subtract from it. When I try to see the Universe as a Babylonian saw it around 3000 B.C., I must grope my way back to my own childhood. At the age of about four I had what I felt to be a satisfactory understanding of God and the world. I remember an occasion when my father pointed his finger at the white ceiling, which was decorated with a frieze of dancing figures, and explained that God was up there, watching me. I immediately became convinced that the dancers were God and henceforth addressed my prayers to them, asking for their protection against the terrors of day and night. Much in the same manner, I like to imagine, did the luminous figures on the dark ceiling of the world appear as living divinities to Babylonians and Egyptians. The Twins, the Bear, the Serpent were as familiar to them as my fluted dancers to me; they were thought to be not very far away, and they held power of life and death, harvest and rain.\n\nThe world of the Babylonians, Egyptians and Hebrews was an oyster, with water underneath, and more water overhead, supported by the solid firmament. It was of moderate dimensions, and as safely closed in on all sides as a cot in the nursery or a babe in the womb. The Babylonians’ oyster was round, the earth was a hollow mountain, placed in its centre, floating on the waters of the deep; above it was a solid dome, covered by the upper waters. The upper waters seeped through the dome as rain, and the lower waters rose in fountains and springs. Sun, moon and stars progressed in a slow dance across the dome, entering the scene through doors in the East and vanishing through doors in the West.\n\nThe universe of the Egyptians was a more rectangular oyster or box; the earth was its floor, the sky was either a cow whose feet rested on the four corners of the earth, or a woman supporting herself on her elbows and knees; later, a vaulted metal lid. Around the inner walls of the box, on a kind of elevated gallery, flowed a river on which the sun and moon gods sailed their barques, entering and vanishing through various stage doors. The fixed stars were lamps, suspended from the vault, or carried by other gods. The planets sailed their own boats along canals originating in the Milky Way, the celestial twin of the Nile. Towards the fifteenth of each month, the moon god was attacked by a ferocious sow, and devoured in a fortnight of agony; then he was re-born again. Sometimes the sow swallowed him whole, causing a lunar eclipse; sometimes a serpent swallowed the sun, causing a solar eclipse. But these tragedies were, like those in a dream, both real and not; inside his box or womb, the dreamer felt fairly safe.\n\nThis feeling of safety was derived from the discovery that, in spite of the tumultuous private lives of the sun and moon gods, their appearances and movements remained utterly dependable and predictable. They brought night and day, the seasons and the rain, harvest and sowing time, in regular cycles. The mother leaning over the cradle is an unpredictable goddess; but her feeding breast can be depended on to appear when needed. The dreaming mind may go through wild adventures, it may travel through Olympus and Tartarus, but the pulse of the dreamer has a regular beat that can be counted. The first to learn counting the pulse of the stars were the Babylonians.\n\nSome six thousand years ago, when the human mind was still half asleep, Chaldean priests were standing on watch-towers, scanning the stars, making maps and time-tables of their motions. Clay tablets dating from the reign of Sargon of Akkad, around 3800 B.C., show an already old-established astronomical tradition. 1 The time-tables became calendars which regulated organized activity, from the growing of crops to religious ceremonies. Their observations became amazingly precise: they computed the length of the year with a deviation of less than 1.001 per cent from the correct value, 2 and their figures relating to the motions of sun and moon have only three times the margin of error of nineteenth-century astronomers armed with mammoth telescopes. 3 In this respect, theirs was an Exact Science; their observations were verifiable, and enabled them to make precise predictions of astronomical events; though based on mythological assumptions, the theory “worked”. Thus at the very beginning of this long journey, Science emerges in the shape of Janus, the double-faced god, guardian of doors and gates: the face in front alert and observant, while the other, dreamy and glassy-eyed, stares in the opposite direction.\n\nThe most fascinating objects in the sky – from both points of view – were the planets, or vagabond stars. Only seven of these existed among the thousands of lights suspended from the firmament. They were the Sun, the Moon, Nebo – Mercury, Ishtar – Venus, Nergal – Mars, Marduk – Jupiter, and Ninib-Saturn. All other stars remained stationary, fixed in the pattern of the firmament, revolving once a day round the earth-mountain, but never changing their places in the pattern. The seven vagabond stars revolved with them, but at the same time they had a motion of their own, like flies wandering over the surface of a spinning globe. Yet they did not wander all across the sky: their movements were confined to a narrow lane, or belt, which was looped around the firmament at an angle of about twenty-three degrees to the equator. This belt – the Zodiac – was divided into twelve sections, and each section was named after a constellation of fixed stars in the neighbourhood. The Zodiac was the lovers’ lane in the skies, along which the planets ambled. The passing of a planet through one of the sections had a double significance: it yielded figures for the observer’s time-table, and symbolic messages of the mythological drama played out behind the scenes. Astrology and Astronomy remain to this day complementary fields of vision of Janus sapiens.\n\n2. Ionian Fever\n\nWhere Babylon and Egypt left off, Greece took over. At the beginning, Greek cosmology moved much on the same lines – Homer’s world is another, more colourful oyster, a floating disc surrounded by Okeanus. But about the time when the texts of the Odyssey and Iliad became consolidated in their final version, a new development started in Ionia on the Aegean coast. The sixth pre-Christian century – the miraculous century of Buddha, Confucius and Lâo-Tse, of the Ionian philosophers and Pythagoras – was a turning point for the human species. A March breeze seemed to blow across this planet from China to Samos, stirring man into awareness, like the breath in Adam’s nostrils. In the Ionian school of philosophy, rational thought was emerging from the mythological dream-world. It was the beginning of the great adventure: the Promethean quest for natural explanations and rational causes, which, within the next two thousand years, would transform the species more radically than the previous two hundred thousand had done.\n\nThales of Miletos, who brought abstract geometry to Greece, and predicted an eclipse of the sun, believed, like Homer, that the earth was a circular disc floating on water, but he did not stop there; discarding the explanations of mythology, he asked the revolutionary question out of what basic raw material, and by what process of nature, the universe was formed. His answer was, that the basic stuff or element must be water, because all things are born from moisture, including air, which is water evaporated. Others taught that the prime material was not water, but air or fire; however, their answers were less important than the fact that they were learning to ask a new type of question, which was addressed not to an oracle, but to dumb nature. It was a wildly exhilarating game; to appreciate it, one must again travel back along one’s own private time-track to the fantasies of early adolescence when the brain, intoxicated with its newly discovered powers, let speculation run riot. “A case in point,” Plato reports, “is that of Thales, who, when he was star-gazing and looking upward, fell into a well, and was rallied (so it is said) by a clever and pretty maidservant from Thrace because he was eager to know what went on in the heaven, but did not notice what was in front of him, nay, at his very feet.” 4\n\nThe second of the Ionian philosophers, Anaximander, displays all the symptoms of the intellectual fever spreading through Greece. His universe is no longer a closed box, but infinite in extension and duration. The raw material is none of the familiar forms of matter, but a substance without definite properties except for being indestructible and everlasting. Out of this stuff all things are developed, and into it they return; before this our world, infinite multitudes of other universes have already existed, and been dissolved again into the amorphous mass. The earth is a cylindrical column, surrounded by air; it floats upright in the centre of the universe without support or anything to stand on, yet it does not fall because, being in the centre, it has no preferred direction towards which to lean; if it did, this would disturb the symmetry and balance of the whole. The spherical heavens enclose the atmosphere “like the bark of a tree”, and there are several layers of this enclosure to accommodate the various stellar objects. But these are not what they seem, and are not “objects” at all. The sun is merely a hole in the rim of a huge wheel. The rim is filled with fire, and as it turns round the earth, so does the hole in it – a puncture in a gigantic tyre filled with flames. For the moon we are given a similar explanation; its phases are due to recurrent partial stoppages of the puncture, and so are the eclipses. The stars are pin-holes in a dark fabric through which we glimpse the cosmic fire filling the space between two layers of “bark”.\n\nIt is not easy to see how the whole thing works, but it is the first approach to a mechanical model of the universe. The boat of the sun god is replaced by the wheels of a clockwork. Yet the machinery looks as if it had been dreamed up by a surrealist painter; the punctured fire-wheels are certainly closer to Picasso than to Newton. As we move along past other cosmologies, we shall get this impression over and again.\n\nThe system of Anaximenes, who was an associate of Anaximander, is less inspired; but he seems to have been the originator of the important idea that the stars are attached “like nails” to a transparent sphere of crystalline material, which turns round the earth “like a hat round the head”. It sounded so plausible and convincing, that the crystal spheres were to dominate cosmology until the beginning of modern times.\n\nThe Ionian philosophers’ home was Miletos in Asia Minor; but there existed rival schools in the Greek towns of Southern Italy, and rival theories within each school. The founder of the Eleatic school, Xenophanes of Kolophon, is a sceptic who wrote poetry to the age of ninety-two, and sounds as if he had served as a model for the author of Ecclesiastes:\n\n“From earth are all things and to earth all things return. From earth and water come all of us… No man hath certainly known, nor shall certainly know, that which he saith about the gods and about all things; for, be that which he saith ever so perfect, yet does he not know it; all things are matters of opinion… Men imagine gods to be born, and to have clothes and voices and shapes like theirs… Yea, the gods of the Ethiopians are black and flat-nosed, the gods of the Thracians are red-haired and blue-eyed… Yea, if oxen and horses and lions had hands, and could shape with their hands images as men do, horses would fashion their gods as horses, and oxen as oxen… Homer and Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are a shame and a disgrace among men, theft, adultery, deceit, and other lawless acts…”\n\nAs against this:\n\n“There is one God … neither in shape nor thought like unto mortals… He abideth ever in the same place motionless … and without effort swayeth all things by his force of mind…” 5\n\nThe Ionians were optimistic, heathenly materialists; Xenophanes was a pantheist of a sorrowful brand, to whom change was an illusion, and effort vanity. His cosmology reflects his philosophical temper; it is radically different from the Ionians’. His earth is not a floating disc, or column, but is “rooted in the infinite”. The sun and the stars have neither substance nor permanence, they are merely cloudy exhalations of the earth which have caught fire. The stars are burnt out at dawn, and in the evening a new set of stars is formed from new exhalations. Similarly, a new sun is born every morning from the crowding together of sparks. The moon is a compressed, luminous cloud, which dissolves in a month; then a new cloud starts forming. Over different regions of the earth, there are different suns and moons, all cloudy illusions.\n\nIn this manner do the earliest rational theories of the Universe betray the bias and temperament of their makers. It is generally believed that with the progress of scientific method, the theories became more objective and reliable. Whether this belief is justified, we shall see. But à propos of Xenophanes we may note that two thousand years later Galileo also insisted on regarding comets as atmospheric illusions – for purely personal reasons, and against the evidence of his telescope.\n\nNeither the cosmology of Anaxagoras, nor of Xenophanes, gained a considerable following. Every philosopher of the period seems to have had his own theory regarding the nature of the universe around him. To quote Professor Burnet, “no sooner did an Ionian philosopher learn half a dozen geometrical propositions and hear that the phenomena of the heavens recur in cycles than he set to work to look for law everywhere in nature and with an audacity amounting to hybris to construct a system of the universe.” 6 But their diverse speculations had this one feature in common, that the sun-eating serpents and Olympian stringpullers were discarded; each theory, however strange and bizarre, was concerned with natural causes.\n\nThe sixth century scene evokes the image of an orchestra expectantly tuning up, each player absorbed in his own instrument only, deaf to the caterwaulings of the others. Then there is a dramatic silence, the conductor enters the stage, raps three times with his baton, and harmony emerges from the chaos. The maestro is Pythagoras of Samos, whose influence on the ideas, and thereby on the destiny, of the human race was probably greater than that of any single man before or after him.\n\nII THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES\n\n1. Pythagoras of Samos\n\nPYTHAGORAS was born in the early decades of that tremendous century of awakening, the sixth; and may have seen it go out, for he lived at least eighty, and possibly over ninety, years. Into that long life-span he packed, in the words of Empedokles, “all things that are contained in ten, even in twenty, generations of men”.\n\nIt is impossible to decide whether a particular detail of the Pythagorean universe was the work of the master, or filled in by a pupil – a remark which equally applies to Leonardo or Michelangelo. But there can be no doubt that the basic features were conceived by a single mind; that Pythagoras of Samos was both the founder of a new religious philosophy, and the founder of Science, as the word is understood today.\n\nIt seems reasonably certain that he was the son of a silversmith and gem engraver named Mnesarchos; that he was a pupil of Anaximander, the atheist, but also of Pherekydes, the mystic who taught the transmigration of souls. He must have travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, as many educated citizens of the Greek Islands did; and it is said that he was charged with diplomatic missions by Polycrates, the enterprising autocrat of Samos. Polycrates was an enlightened tyrant who favoured commerce, piracy, engineering, and the fine arts; the greatest poet of the time, Anakreon, and the greatest engineer, Eupalinos from Megara, both lived at his court. According to a story by Herodotus, he became so powerful that, to placate the jealousy of the gods, he threw his most precious signet ring into the deep waters. A few days later, his cook cut open a large fish, freshly caught, and found the ring in its stomach. The doomed Polycrates promptly walked into a trap set by a small Persian ruler, and was crucified. But by that time Pythagoras, with his family, had emigrated from Samos, and around 530 B.C. settled in Kroton – which, next to its rival Sybaris, was the largest Greek town in Southern Italy. The reputation which preceded him must have been tremendous, for the Pythagorean Brotherhood which he founded on his arrival soon ruled the town, and for a time gained supremacy over a considerable part of Magna Grecia. But its secular power was short-lived; Pythagoras, at the end of his life, was banished from Kroton to Metapontion; his disciples were exiled or slain, and their meeting-houses burnt down.\n\nThis is the meagre stem of more or less established fact, around which the ivy of legend began to grow even during the master’s lifetime. He soon achieved semi-divine status; according to Aristotle, the Krotonians believed him to be a son of the Hyperborean Apollo, and there was a saying that “among rational creatures there are gods and men and beings like Pythagoras”. He worked miracles, conversed with demons from heaven, descended to Hades, and possessed such power over men, that after his first sermon to the Krotonians, six hundred joined the communal life of the Brotherhood without even going home to bid their families farewell. Among his disciples his authority was absolute – “the Master said so” was their law.\n\n2. The Unifying Vision\n\nMyths grow like crystals, according to their own, recurrent pattern; but there must be a suitable core to start their growth. Mediocrities or cranks have no myth-generating power; they may create a fashion, but it soon peters out. Yet the Pythagorean vision of the world was so enduring, that it still permeates our thinking, even our vocabulary. The very term “philosophy” is Pythagorean in origin; so is the word “harmony” in its broader sense; and when we call numbers “figures”, we talk the jargon of the Brotherhood. 1\n\nThe essence and power of that vision lies in its all-embracing, unifying character; it unites religion and science, mathematics and music, medicine and cosmology, body, mind and spirit in an inspired and luminous synthesis. In the Pythagorean philosophy all component parts interlock; it presents a homogeneous surface, like a sphere, so that it is difficult to decide from which side to cut into it. But the simplest approach is through music. The Pythagorean discovery that the pitch of a note depends on the length of the string which produces it, and that concordant intervals in the scale are produced by simple numerical ratios (2 : 1 octave, 3 : 2 fifth, 4 : 3 fourth, etc.), was epoch-making: it was the first successful reduction of quality to quantity, the first step towards the mathematization of human experience – and therefore the beginning of Science.\n\nBut here an important distinction must be made. The twentieth-century European regards with justified misgivings the “reduction” of the world around him, of his experiences and emotions, into a set of abstract formulae, deprived of colour, warmth, meaning and value. To the Pythagoreans, on the contrary, the mathematization of experience meant not an impoverishment, but an enrichment. Numbers were sacred to them as the purest of ideas, dis-embodied and ethereal; hence the marriage of music to numbers could only ennoble it. The religious and emotional ekstasis derived from music was canalized by the adept into intellectual ekstasis, the contemplation of the divine dance of numbers. The gross strings of the lyre are recognized to be of subordinate importance; they can be made of different materials, in various thicknesses and lengths, so long as the proportions are preserved: what produces the music are the ratios, the numbers, the pattern of the scale. Numbers are eternal while everything else is perishable; they are of the nature not of matter, but of mind; they permit mental operations of the most surprising and delightful kind without reference to the coarse external world of the senses – which is how the divine mind must be supposed to operate. The ecstatic contemplation of geometrical forms and mathematical laws is therefore the most effective means of purging the soul of earthly passion, and the principal link between man and divinity.\n\nThe Ionian philosophers had been materialists in the sense that the chief accent of their inquiry was on the stuff from which the universe was made; the Pythagoreans’ chief accent was on form, proportion and pattern; on the eidos and schema, on the relation, not on the relata. Pythagoras is to Thales what Gestalt philosophy is to the materialism of the nineteenth century. The pendulum has been set swinging; its ticking will be heard through the entire course of history, as the blob alternates between the extreme positions of “all is body”, “all is mind”; as the emphasis shifts from “substance” to “form”, from “structure” to “function”, from “atoms” to “patterns”, from “corpuscles” to “waves”, and back again.\n\nThe line connecting music with numbers became the axis of the Pythagorean system. This axis was then extended in both directions: towards the stars on one side, the body and soul of man on the other. The bearings, on which the axis and the whole system turned, were the basic concepts of armonia: harmony, and katharsis: purge, purification.\n\nThe Pythagoreans were, among other things, healers; we are told that “they used medicine to purge the body, and music to purge the soul”. 2 One of the oldest forms, indeed, of psychotherapy consists in inducing the patient, by wild pipe music or drums, to dance himself into a frenzy followed by exhaustion and a trance-like, curative sleep – the ancestral version of shock treatment and abreaction therapy. But such violent measures were only needed where the patient’s soul-strings were out of tune – overstrung or limp. This is to be taken literally, for the Pythagoreans regarded the body as a kind of musical instrument where each string must have the right tension and the correct balance between opposites such as “high” and “low”, “hot” and “cold”, “wet” and “dry”. The metaphors borrowed from music which we still apply in medicine – “tone”, “tonic”, “well-tempered”, “temperance”, are also part of our Pythagorean heritage.\n\nHowever, the concept armonia did not have quite the same meaning that we lend to “harmony”. It is not the pleasing effect of simultaneously-sounded concordant strings – “harmony” in that sense was absent from classical Greek music – but something more austere: armonia is simply the attunement of the strings to the intervals in the scale, and the pattern of the scale itself. It means that balance and order, not sweet pleasure, are the law of the world.\n\nSweetness does not enter the Pythagorean universe. But it contains one of the most powerful tonics ever administered to the human brain. It lies in the Pythagorean tenets that “philosophy is the highest music”, and that the highest form of philosophy is concerned with numbers: for ultimately “all things are numbers”. The meaning of this oft-quoted saying may perhaps be paraphrased thus: “all things have form, all things are form; and all forms can be defined by numbers”. Thus the form of the square corresponds to a “square number”, i.e. 16=4×4, whereas 12 is an oblong number, and 6 a triangular number:\n\nNumbers were regarded by the Pythagoreans as patterns of dots which form characteristic figures, as on the sides of a dice; and though we use arabic symbols, which have no resemblance to these dot-patterns, we still call numbers “figures”, i.e. shapes.\n\nBetween these number-shapes unexpected and marvellous relations were found to exist. For instance, the series of “square numbers” was formed simply by the addition of successive odd numbers:\n\nand so forth:\n\nThe addition of even numbers formed “oblong numbers”, where the ratio of the sides represented exactly the concordant intervals of the musical octave:\n\n2 (2 : 1, octave) + 4 = 6 (3 : 2, fifth) + 6 = 12 (4 : 3, quart)\n\nIn a similar manner, “cubic” numbers and “pyramidal” numbers were obtained. Mnesarchos had been a gem engraver, so Pythagoras in his youth must have been familiar with crystals whose form imitated those of pure number-shapes: quartz the pyramid and double-pyramid, beryl the hexagon, garnet the dodocaeder. It all went to show that Reality could be reduced to number-series and number-ratios, if only the rules of the game were known. To discover these was the chief task of the Philosophos, the Lover of Wisdom.\n\nAn example of the magic of numbers is the famous theorem, by which alone Pythagoras is consciously remembered today – the visible peak of the submerged iceberg. * There is no obvious relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle; but if we build a square over each side, the areas of the two smaller squares will exactly equal the area of the larger. If such wonderfully ordered laws, hitherto hidden from the human eye, could be discovered by the contemplation of number-shapes, was it not legitimate to hope that soon all secrets of the universe would be revealed through them? Numbers were not thrown into the world at random; they arranged themselves into balanced patterns, like the shapes of crystals and the concordant intervals of the scale, according to the universal laws of harmony.\n\n3. “Soft Stillness and the Night”\n\nExtended to the stars, the doctrine took the form of the “Harmony of the Spheres”. The Ionian philosophers had begun to prise open the cosmic oyster, and to set the earth adrift; in Anaximander’s universe the earth-disc no longer floats in water, but stands in the centre, supported by nothing and surrounded by air. In the Pythagorean universe the disc changes into a spherical ball. 3 Around it, the sun, moon and planets revolve in concentric circles, each fastened to a sphere or wheel. The swift revolution of each of these bodies causes a swish, or musical hum, in the air. Evidently each planet will hum on a different pitch, depending on the ratios of their respective orbits – just as the tone of a string depends on its length. Thus the orbits in which the planets move form a kind of huge lyre whose strings are curved into circles. It seemed equally evident that the intervals between the orbital cords must be governed by the laws of harmony. According to Pliny, 4 Pythagoras thought that the musical interval formed by earth and moon was that of a tone; moon to Mercury, a semi-tone; Mercury to Venus, a semi-tone; Venus to Sun, a minor third; Sun to Mars, a tone; Mars to Jupiter, a semi-tone; Jupiter to Saturn, a semi-tone; Saturn to the sphere of the fixed stars, a minor third. The resulting “Pythagorean Scale” is si, do, re bemol, fa, sol, la bemol, do – though the accounts of the scale given by different writers vary slightly.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Master alone had the gift of actually hearing the music of the spheres. Ordinary mortals lack this gift, either because they are from the moment of birth, unknowingly but constantly bathed in the celestial humming; or because – as Lorenzo explains to Jessica – they are too grossly constituted:\n\n… soft stillness and the night\n\nBecome the touches of sweet harmony …\n\nLook how the floor of heaven\n\nIs thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;\n\nThere’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st\n\nBut in his motion like an angel sings …\n\nSuch harmony is in immortal souls;\n\nBut, whilst this muddy vesture of decay\n\nDoth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. 5\n\nThe Pythagorean dream of musical harmony governing the motion of the stars never lost its mysterious impact, its power to call forth responses from the depth of the unconscious mind. It reverberates through the centuries, from Kroton to Elizabethan England; I shall quote two more versions of it – with a purpose that will become apparent later. The first is Dryden’s well-known:\n\nFrom harmony, from heavenly harmony,\n\nThis universal frame began:\n\nWhen nature underneath a heap\n\nOf jarring atoms lay\n\nAnd could not heave her head,\n\nThe tuneful voice we heard from high:\n\nArise, ye more than dead.\n\nThe second is from Milton’s Arcades:\n\nBut els in deep of night when drowsiness\n\nHath lockt up mortal sense, then listen I\n\nTo the celestial Sirens harmony …\n\nSuch sweet compulsion doth in music ly,\n\nTo lull the daughters of Necessity,\n\nAnd keep unsteddy Nature to her law,\n\nAnd the low world in measur’d motion draw\n\nAfter the heavenly tune, which none can hear\n\nOf human mould with grosse unpurged ear.\n\nBut, one might ask, was the “Harmony of the Spheres” a poetic conceit or a scientific concept? A working hypothesis or a dream dreamt through a mystic’s ear? In the light of the data which astronomers collected in the centuries that followed, it certainly appeared as a dream; and even Aristotle laughed “harmony, heavenly harmony” out of the courts of earnest, exact science. Yet we shall see how, after an immense detour, at the turn of the sixteenth century, one Johannes Kepler became enamoured with the Pythagorean dream, and on this foundation of fantasy, by methods of reasoning equally unsound, built the solid edifice of modern astronomy. It is one of the most astonishing episodes in the history of thought, and an antidote to the pious belief that the Progress of Science is governed by logic.\n\n4. Religion and Science Meet\n\nIf Anaximander’s universe reminds one of a Picasso painting, the Pythagorean world resembles a cosmic musical box playing the same Bach prelude from eternity to eternity. It is not surprising, then, that the religious beliefs of the Pythagorean Brotherhood are closely related to the figure of Orpheus, the divine fiddler, whose music held not only the Prince of Darkness, but also beasts, trees and rivers under its spell.\n\nOrpheus is a late arrival on the Greek stage, overcrowded with gods and demigods. The little we know about his cult is clouded in conjecture and controversy; but we know, at least in broad outlines, its background. At an unknown date, but probably not much before the sixth century, the cult of Dionysus-Bacchus, the “raging” goat-god of fertility and wine, spread from barbaric Thracia into Greece. The initial success of Bacchism was probably due to that general sense of frustration which Xenophanes so eloquently expressed. The Olympian Pantheon had come to resemble an assembly of wax-works, whose formalized worship could no more satisfy truly religious needs than the pantheism – this “polite atheism” as it has been called – of the Ionian sages. A spiritual void tends to create emotional outbreaks; the Bacchae of Euripides, frenzied worshippers of the horned god, appear as the forerunners of the mediaeval tarantula dancers, the bright young things of the roaring ‘twenties, the maenads of the Hitler youth. The outbreak seems to have been sporadic and shortlived: the Greeks, being Greeks, soon realized that these excesses led neither to mystic union with God, nor back to nature, but merely to mass-hysteria:\n\nTheban women leaving\n\nTheir spinning and their weaving\n\nStung with the maddening trance\n\nOf Dionysus! …\n\nBrute with bloody jaws agape\n\nGod-defying, gross and grim,\n\nSlander of the human shape. 6\n\nThe authorities seemed to have acted with eminent reasonableness: they promoted Bacchus-Dionysus to the official Pantheon with a rank equal to Apollo’s. His frenzy was tamed, his wine watered down, his worship regulated, and used as a harmless safety-valve.\n\nBut the mystic craving must have persisted, at least in a sensitivised minority, and the pendulum now began to swing in the opposite direction: from carnal ecstasy to other-worldliness. In the most telling variant of the legend, Orpheus appears as a victim of Bacchic fury: when, having finally lost his wife, he decides to turn his back on sex, the women of Thrace tear him to pieces, and his head floats down the Hebrus – still singing. It sounds like a cautionary tale; but the tearing and devouring of the living god, and his subsequent rebirth, is a leitmotif that recurs in Orphism on a different level of meaning. In Orphic mythology, Dionysus (or his Thracian version, Zagreus) is the beautiful son of Zeus and Persephone; the evil Titans tear him to pieces and eat him, all but his heart, which is given to Zeus, and he is born a second time. The Titans are slain by Zeus’ thunderbolt; but out of their ashes man is born. By devouring the god’s flesh, the Titans have acquired a spark of divinity which is transmitted to man; and so is the desperate evil that resided in the Titans. But it is in the power of man to redeem this original sin, to purge himself of the evil portion of his heritage by leading an other-wordly life and performing certain ascetic rites. In this manner he can obtain liberation from the “wheel of rebirth” – his imprisonment in successive animal and even vegetable bodies, which are like carnal tombs to his immortal soul – and regain his lost divine status.\n\nThe Orphic cult was thus in almost every respect a reversal of the Dionysian; it retained the name of the god and some features of his legend, but all with a changed emphasis and different meaning (a process that will repeat itself at other turning points of religious history). The Bacchic technique of obtaining emotional release by furiously clutching at the Now and Here, is replaced by renunciation with an eye on after-life. Physical intoxication is superseded by mental intoxication; the “juice that streams from the vine-clusters to give us joy and oblivion” now serves only as a sacramental symbol; it will eventually be taken over, together with the symbolic swallowing of the slain god and other basic elements of Orphism, by Christianity. “I am perishing with thirst, give me to drink of the waters of memory”, says a verse on an Orphic gold tablet, alluding to the divine origin of the soul: the aim is no longer oblivion but remembrance of a knowledge which it once possessed. Even words change their meaning: “orgy” no longer means Bacchic revelry, but religious ecstasy leading to liberation from the wheel of rebirth. 7 A similar development is the transformation of the carnal union between the King and the Shulamite into the mystic union of Christ and his Church; and, in more recent times, the shift of meaning in words like “rapture” and “ravishment”.\n\nOrphism was the first universal religion in the sense that it was not regarded as a tribal or national monopoly, but open to all who accepted its tenets; and it profoundly influenced all subsequent religious development. It would nevertheless be a mistake to attribute too much intellectual and spiritual refinement to it; the Orphic purification rites, which are the hub of the whole system, still contain a series of primitive taboos – not to eat meat, or beans, not to touch a white cock, not to look in a mirror beside the light.\n\nBut this is precisely the point where Pythagoras gave Orphism a new meaning, the point where religious intuition and rational science were brought together in a synthesis of breathtaking originality. The link is the concept of katharsis. It was a central concept in Bacchism, Orphism, in the cult of the Delian Apollo, in Pythagorean medicine and science; but it had different meanings, and entailed different techniques in all of them (as it still does in the various schools of modern psychotherapy). Was there anything in common between the raving Bacchante and the aloof mathematician, the fiddle of Orpheus and a laxative pill? Yes: the same yearning for release from various forms of enslavement, from passions and tensions of body and mind, from death and the void, from the legacy of the Titans in man’s estate – the yearning to re-light the divine spark. But the methods of achieving this must differ according to the person. They must be graded according to the disciple’s lights and degree of initiation. Pythagoras replaced the soul-purging all-cures of competing sects, by an elaborate hierarchy of kathartic techniques; he purified the very concept of purification, as it were.\n\nAt the bottom of the scale are simple taboos, taken over from Orphism, such as the interdiction of eating meat and beans; for the coarse-natured the penance of self-denial is the only effective purge. At the highest level katharsis of the soul is achieved by contemplating the essence of all reality, the harmony of forms, the dance of numbers. “Pure science” – a strange expression that we still use – is thus both an intellectual delight and a way to spiritual release; the way to the mystic union between the thoughts of the creature and the spirit of its creator. “The function of geometry,” says Plutarch of the Pythagoreans, “is to draw us away from the world of the senses and of corruption, to the world of the intellect and the eternal. For the contemplation of the eternal is the end of philosophy as the contemplation of the mysteries is the end of religion.” 8 But to the true Pythagorean, the two have become indistinguishable.\n\nThe historical importance of the idea that disinterested science leads to purification of the soul and its ultimate liberation, can hardly be exaggerated. The Egyptians embalmed their corpses so that the soul might return to them and need not be reincarnated again; the Buddhists practised non-attachment to escape the wheel; both attitudes were negative and socially sterile. The Pythagorean concept of harnessing science to the contemplation of the eternal, entered, via Plato and Aristotle, into the spirit of Christianity and became a decisive factor in the making of the Western world.\n\nEarlier in this chapter I have tried to show how, by relating music to astronomy and both to mathematics, emotional experience became enriched and deepened by intellectual insight. Cosmic wonder and aesthetic delight no longer live apart from the exercise of reason; they are all inter-related. Now the final step has been taken: the mystic intuitions of religion have also been integrated into the whole. Again, the process is accompanied by subtle changes in the meaning of certain key-words, such as theoria – theory. The word was derived from theorio – “to behold, contemplate” (thea: spectacle, theoris: spectator, audience). But in orphic usage, theoria came to signify “a state of fervent religious contemplation, in which the spectator is identified with the suffering god, dies in his death, and rises again in his new birth”. 9 As the Pythagoreans canalized religious fervour into intellectual fervour, ritual ecstasy into the ecstasy of discovery, theoria gradually changed its meaning into “theory” in the modern sense. But though the raucous cry of the ritual worshippers was replaced by the Eureka of the new theorizers, they remained aware of the common source from which both sprang. They were aware that the symbols of mythology and the symbols of mathematical science were different aspects of the same, indivisible Reality. * They did not live in a “divided house of faith and reason”; the two were interlocking, like ground-plan and elevation on an architect’s drawing. It is a state of mind very difficult for twentieth-century man to imagine – or even to believe that it could ever have existed. It may help to remember though, that some of the greatest pre-Socratic sages formulated their philosophies in verse; the unitary source of inspiration of prophet, poet and philosopher was still taken for granted.\n\nThe Pythagorean synthesis would have been incomplete had it not also included precepts for a way of life.\n\nThe Brotherhood was a religious order, but at the same time an academy of science, and a power in Italian politics. The ascetic rules of life seem to have anticipated the Essenes’, which in turn served as a model to primitive Christian communities. They shared all property, led a communal existence, and gave equal status to women. They observed rites and abstinences, gave much time to contemplation and examinations of conscience. According to the degree of purification which a Brother achieved, he was gradually initiated into the higher mysteries of musical, mathematical and astronomical theoria. The secrecy surrounding these was partly due to the tradition of the older mystery cults, whose adepts had known that the Bacchic, and even the Orphic, ecstasies would cause havoc if offered to all and sundry. But the Pythagoreans also realized that similar dangers inhered in the orgies of reasoning. They apparently had an intuition of the hybris of science, and recognized it as a potential means both of man’s liberation and destruction; hence their insistence that only those purified in body and spirit should be trusted with its secrets. In a word, they believed that scientists ought to be vegetarians, as Catholics believe that priests ought to live in celibacy.\n\nIt may be thought that this interpretation of the Pythagorean insistence on secretiveness is far-fetched, or that it implies prophetic foresight on their part. The answer to this is that Pythagoras was, by personal experience, well aware of the immense technological potentialities of geometry. I have mentioned already that Polycrates, and the islanders he ruled, were devoted to engineering. Herodotus, who knew the island well, reports: 10\n\n“I have written thus at length of the Samians, because they are the makers of the three greatest works to be seen in any Greek land. First of these is the double-mouthed tunnel they pierced for an hundred and fifty fathoms through the base of a high hill … through which the water, coming from an abundant spring, is carried by its pipes to the city of Samos”.\n\nHerodotus is fond of telling tall stories, and his report was not taken very seriously, until, at the beginning of our century, the tunnel was actually found and excavated. It is no less than nine hundred yards long, complete with water-course and inspection-pathway, and its shape shows that it was begun from both ends. It further shows that the two digging parties, one working from the north, the other from the south, had met in the centre only a couple of feet apart. Having watched this fantastic feat being performed (by Eupalinos, who also built the second marvel mentioned by Herodotus, a huge mole to protect the Samian war-fleet), even a lesser genius than Pythagoras might have realized that Science may become a hymn to the creator or a Pandora’s box, and that it should be trusted only to saints. It is said, incidentally, that Pythagoras, like St. Francis, preached to animals, which would seem rather odd behaviour in a modern mathematician; but in the Pythagorean view nothing could be more natural.\n\n5. Tragedy and greatness of the Pythagoreans\n\nTowards the end of the Master’s life, or shortly after his death, two misfortunes befell the Pythagoreans, which would have meant the end of any sect or school with a less universal outlook. They triumphantly survived both.\n\nOne blow was the discovery of a type of numbers such as\n\n– the square root of 2 – which could not be fitted into any dot-diagram. And such numbers were common: they are, for instance, represented by the diagonal of any square. Let the side of the square be called a, and the diagonal d. It can be proved that if I assign to a any precise numerical value, then it becomes impossible to assign a precise numerical value to d. The side and the square are “incommensurable”; their ratio a/d cannot be represented by any real numbers or fractions thereof; it is an “irrational” number; it is both odd and even at the same time. * I can easily draw the diagonal of a square, but I cannot express its length in numbers – I cannot count the number of dots it contains. The point-to-point correspondence between arithmetic and geometry has broken down – and with it the universe of numbershapes.\n\nIt is said that the Pythagoreans kept the discovery of irrational numbers – they called them arrhētos, unspeakable – a secret, and that Hippasos, the disciple who let the scandal leak out, was put to death. There is also another version, in Proclos: 11\n\n“It is told that those who first brought out the irrationals from concealment into the open perished in shipwreck, to a man. For the unutterable and the formless must needs be concealed. And those who uncovered and touched this image of life were instantly destroyed and shall remain forever exposed to the play of the eternal waves.”\n\nYet, Pythagoreanism survived. It had the elastic adaptability of all truly great ideological systems which, when some part is knocked out of them, display the self-regenerating powers of a growing crystal or a living organism. The mathematization of the world by means of atom-like dots proved a premature shortcut; but on a higher turn of the spiral, mathematical equations proved once again the most serviceable symbols for representing the physical aspect of reality. We shall meet with further examples of prophetic intuition supported by the wrong reasons; and we shall find that they are rather the rule than the exception.\n\nNobody before the Pythagoreans had thought that mathematical relations held the secret of the universe. Twenty-five centuries later, Europe is still blessed and cursed with their heritage. To non-European civilizations, the idea that numbers are the key to both wisdom and power, seems never to have occurred.\n\nThe second blow was the dissolution of the Brotherhood. We know little of its causes; it probably had something to do with the equalitarian principles and communist practices of the order, the emancipation of women, and its quasi-monotheistic doctrine – the eternal messianic heresy. But persecution remained confined to the Pythagoreans as an organized body – and probably prevented them from degenerating into sectarian orthodoxy. The Master’s principal pupils – among them Philolaus and Lysis – who had gone into exile, were soon allowed to return to Southern Italy and to resume teaching. A century later, that teaching became one of the sources of Platonism, and thus entered the mainstream of European thought.\n\nIn the words of a modern scholar: ” Pythagoras is the founder of European culture in the Western Mediterranean sphere.” 12 Plato and Aristotle, Euclid and Archimedes, are landmarks on the road; but Pythagoras stands at the point of departure, where it is decided which direction the road will take. Before that decision, the future orientation of Greco-European civilization was still undecided: it may have taken the direction of the Chinese, or Indian, or pre-Columbian cultures, all of which were still equally unshaped and undecided at the time of the great sixth-century dawn. I do not mean to say that if Confucius and Pythagoras had exchanged their places of birth, China would have beaten us to the Scientific Revolution, and Europe become a land of tea-sipping mandarins. The interactions of climate, race and spirit, the directional influence of outstanding individuals on the course of History, are so obscure that no predictions are possible even in reverse; all “if ” statements about the past are as dubious as prophecies of the future are. It seems fairly plausible that if Alexander or Ghengis Khan had never been born, some other individual would have filled his place and executed the design of the Hellenic or Mongolic expansion; but the Alexanders of philosophy and religion, of science and art, seem less expendable; their impact seems less determined by economic challenges and social pressures; and they seem to have a much wider range of possibilities to influence the direction, shape and texture of civilizations. If conquerors be regarded as the engine-drivers of History, then the conquerors of thought are perhaps the pointsmen who, less conspicuous to the traveller’s eye, determine the direction of the journey.\n\nIII THE EARTH ADRIFT\n\nI HAVE tried to give a brief general description of Pythagorean philosophy, including aspects of it that are only indirectly related to the subject of this book. In the following sections, some important schools of Greek philosophy and science – Eleatics and Stoics, Atomists and Hippocratics – will hardly be mentioned at all, until we arrive at the next turning point in cosmology, Plato and Aristotle. The development of man’s views about the cosmos cannot be treated in isolation from the philosophical background which coloured these views; on the other hand, if the narrative is not to be swallowed up by the background, the latter can only be sketched in at certain turning points of the tale, where the general philosophical climate had a direct impact on cosmology and altered its course. Thus, for instance, the political views of Plato, or the religious convictions of Cardinal Bellarmine, profoundly influenced astronomical developments for centuries, and must accordingly be discussed; whereas men like Empedokles and Democritus, Socrates and Zeno, who had a lot to say about the stars, but nothing that is really relevant to our subject, must be passed in silence.\n\n1. Philolaus and the Central Fire\n\nFrom the end of the sixth century B.C. onward, the idea that the earth was a sphere, freely floating in air, made steady head-way. Herodotus 1 mentions a rumour that there exist people far up in the north who sleep six months of the year – which shows that some of the implications of the earth’s roundness (such as the polar night) had already been grasped. The next, revolutionary step was taken by a pupil of Pythagoras, Philolaus, the first philosopher to attribute motion to our globe. The earth became air-borne.\n\nThe motives which led to this tremendous innovation we can only guess. Perhaps it was the realization that there is something illogical in the apparent movements of the planets. It seemed crazy that the sun and planets should turn round the earth once a day, but at the same time slowly crawl along the Zodiac on their annual revolutions. Everything would be much simpler if one assumed that the daily revolution of the entire sky was an illusion caused by the earth’s own motion. If the earth existed free and unattached in space, could she not also move? Yet the apparently obvious idea of letting the earth rotate on her own axis did not occur to Philolaus. Instead, he made her revolve, in twenty-four hours, round an extraneous point in space. By describing one complete circle a day, the observer on earth would have the illusion, like a traveller on a roundabout, that the whole cosmic fair was turning in the opposite direction.\n\nIn the centre of his roundabout, Philolaus placed the “watchtower of Zeus”, also called “the hearth of the universe” or the “central fire”. But this “central fire” is not to be confused with the sun. It could never be seen; for the inhabited part of the earth – Greece and its neighbours – was always turned away from it, as the dark side of the moon is always turned away from the earth. Moreover, between the earth and the central fire Philolaus inserted an invisible planet: the antichton or counter-earth. Its function was, apparently, to protect the antipodes from being scorched by the central fire. The ancient belief that the farwestern regions of the earth, beyond the straits of Gibraltar, are shrouded in eternal twilight 2 was now explained by the shadow which the counter-earth threw on those parts. But it is also possible – as Aristotle contemptuously remarks – that the counterearth was invented merely to bring the number of moving things in the universe up to ten, the sacred number of the Pythagoreans. 3\n\nAround the central fire, then, revolved in concentric orbits these nine bodies: the antichton innermost, then the earth, the moon, the sun and the five planets; then came the sphere carrying all the fixed stars. Beyond this outer shell there was a wall of fiery ether, enclosing the world from all sides. This “outer fire” was the second and main source from which the universe drew its light and breath. The sun served merely as a kind of transparent window or lens, through which the outer light was filtered and distributed. The picture reminds one of Anaximander’s holes in the flame-filled tyre. But these fantastic imaginations were perhaps less fantastic than the notion of a ball of fire hurtling across the sky through eternity, without burning out; a preposterous idea at which the mind boggles. Looking at the sky with eyes washed clean of theories, is it not more convincing to regard the sun and stars as holes in the curtain enclosing the world?\n\nThe only heavenly object considered to be similar to the earth was the moon. It was supposed to be inhabited by plants and animals fifteen times as strong as ours, because the moon enjoyed daylight for fifteen days in succession. Other Pythagoreans thought that the lights and shadows on the moon were reflections of our oceans. As for eclipses, some were caused by the earth, some by the counter-earth, which also accounted for the faint ashen light on the lunar disc at new moon. Still others seem to have assumed the existence of several counter-earths. It must have been a lively debate.\n\n2. Herakleides and the Sun-Centred Universe\n\nIn spite of its poetic oddities, the system of Philolaus opened up a new cosmic perspective. It broke away from the geocentric tradition – the sturdy conviction that this earth occupies the centre of the Universe, from which, massive and immobile, it never budges an inch.\n\nBut it was also a landmark in another direction. It separated neatly two phenomena which had previously been mixed up: the succession of day and night, that is, the diurnal rotation of the sky as a whole; and the annual motions of the seven wandering planets.\n\nThe next improvement of the model concerned the daily motions. The central fire dropped out; the earth, instead of going round it, was now made to spin on her own axis, like a top. The reason was, presumably, 4 that the Greek seafarers’ growing contacts with distant regions – from the Ganges to the Tagus, from the island of Thule to Taprobrana – had failed to produce any sign, or even rumour, of the central fire or the antichton, both of which should have been visible from the other side of the earth. I have said before that the Pythagoreans’ world-view was elastic and adaptable. They did not drop the idea of the central fire as a source of heat and energy; but they transferred it from outer space into the core of the earth; and the counter-earth they simply identified with the moon. 5\n\nThe next great pioneer in the Pythagorean tradition is Herakleides of Pontus. He lived in the fourth century B.C., studied under Plato, and presumably also under Aristotle; hence, by chronological order, he ought to be discussed after these. But I shall first follow the development of the Pythagorean cosmology, the boldest and most hopeful in antiquity, to its end – which came in the generation after Herakleides.\n\nHerakleides took the earth’s rotation round its own axis for granted. This explained the daily round of the skies, but left the problem of the annual motion of the planets untouched. By now, these annual motions had become the central problem of astronomy and cosmology. The multitude of fixed stars presented no problem. They never altered their positions relative to each other or to the earth. 6 They were a permanent guarantee of law and order and regularity in the universe, and could be imagined, without much difficulty, as a pattern of pin-heads (or pin-holes) in the celestial pin-cushion which either turned, as a unit, around the earth, or appeared to do so owing to the earth’s rotation. But the planets, the tramp stars, moved with a shocking irregularity. Their only reassuring feature was that they all moved along the same narrow belt or lane looped around the sky (the Zodiac): which meant that their orbits all lay very nearly in the same plane.\n\nTo get an idea of how the Greeks perceived the universe, imagine all transatlantic traffic – submarines, ships, aircraft – to be confined to the same trade-route. The “orbits” of all craft will then be along concentric circles round the earth’s centre, all in the same plane. Let an observer lie on his back in a cavity in the centre of the transparent earth, and watch the traffic. It will appear to him as points moving at different speeds along a single line: his zodiacal lane. If the transparent sphere is set rotating round the observer (who, himself, remains at rest) the traffic-lane will rotate with the sphere, but the traffic will still remain confined to this lane. The traffic consists of: two submarines ploughing the waters at different depths under the lane: they are the “lower” planets, Mercury and Venus; then a single ship with blazing lights: the sun; then three aeroplanes at different heights: the “upper” planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, in that order. Saturn would be very high up in the stratosphere; above it there is only the sphere of the fixed stars. As for the moon, she is so close to the observer in the centre, that she must be considered a ball rolling on the concave wall inside his cavity; but still in the same plane with all the other craft. This, then, in broad outlines, is the antique model of the world ( Fig. A ).\n\n(A) Classical geocentric system (B) “Egyptian” system of Herakleides\n\n(C) System of Tycho de Brahe (and of Herakleides?) (D) Aristarchus’ heliocentric system.\n\nR= Sun; ƒ = Moon; E = Earth; f = Mercury; g = Venus; h = Mars; F = Jupiter; G = Saturn\n\nBut model A could never be made to work properly. To our hind-sight, the reason is obvious: the planets were arranged in the wrong order; the sun should be in the centre, and the earth should take the sun’s place between the “lower” and “upper” planets, taking the moon with her (Fig. D). This basic fault in the model caused incomprehensible irregularities in the apparent motions of the planets.\n\nBy the time of Herakleides, these irregularities had become the principal worry of the philosophers concerned with the universe. The sun and moon seemed to move in a more or less regular manner along the traffic lane; but the five planets travelled in a most erratic way. A planet would amble for a while along the lane, in the general direction of the traffic, West to East; but at intervals he would slow down, come to a stop as if he had reached a station in the sky, and retrace his steps; then change his mind again, turn round and resume his wandering in the original direction. Venus behaved even more capriciously. The pronounced periodical changes in her brightness and size seemed to indicate that she alternately approached and receded from us, and this suggested that she did not really move in a circle round the earth, but along some unthinkable, wavy line. Moreover, both she and Mercury, the second inner planet, now raced ahead of the steadily moving sun, now fell behind, but always stuck close to him, like dolphins playing around a ship. Accordingly, Venus at times appeared as Phosphoros the “morning star”, rising with the sun in her wake, at other times as Hesperos the “evening star” at the sun’s tail; Pythagoras seems to have been the first to recognize that they were one and the same planet.\n\nOnce more, in the rear-view mirror, Herakleides’ solution of the puzzle seems simple enough. If Venus moved in an irregular manner relative to the earth, the supposed centre of her orbit, yet danced attendance to the sun, then she obviously was attached to the sun, and not to the earth: she was a satellite of the sun. And since Mercury behaved in the same manner, both inner planets must revolve round the sun – and with the sun round the earth, like a wheel turning on a wheel.\n\nFigure B on page 46 explains at a single glance why Venus alternately approaches and recedes from the earth; why she is at times ahead of, at others behind, the sun; and also why she intermittently moves in reverse gear along the Zodiacal lane. 7\n\nIt all looks beautifully obvious – in the rear mirror. But there are situations where it needs great imaginative power, combined with disrespect for the traditional currents of thought, to discover the obvious. The scant information we have about the personality of Herakleides shows that he had both: originality, and contempt for academic tradition. He was nicknamed by his acquaintances the paradoxolog – a maker of paradoxes; Cicero relates that he was fond of telling “puerile fables” and “marvellous stories”; and Proclus tells us that he had the audacity to contradict Plato, who taught the immobility of the earth. 8\n\nThe idea that the two lower planets – and only these two – were satellites of the sun, while the sun itself and the remaining planets still revolved round the earth, became later known by the misnomer “Egyptian System” and gained great popularity ( Fig. B, p. 46). It was evidently a half-way house between the geocentric (earth-centred) and heliocentric (sun-centred) conceptions of the universe. We do not know whether Herakleides stopped there, or whether he took the further step of letting the three outer planets also go around the sun, and the sun, with all his five satellites, go round the earth ( Fig. C, p. 46). It would have been a logical step, and some modern scholars believe that Herakleides did reach this three-quarter-way house 9. Some even believe that he also took the ultimate step of making all the planets, including the earth, revolve around the sun.\n\nBut whether he went the whole way to the modern conception of the solar system or not, is merely a matter of historic curiosity, for his successor, Aristarchus, certainly did.\n\n3. The Greek Copernicus\n\nAristarchus, last of the line of the Pythagorean astronomers, came, like the Master, from Samos; and he is supposed to have been born, symbolically, in the same year, 310 B.C., in which Herakleides died. * Only one short treatise of his survives: On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon. It shows that he had the basic gifts required of a modern scientist: originality of thought and meticulousness in observation. The elegant method he designed for calculating the distance of the sun was followed by astronomers throughout the Middle Ages; if his actual figures were wrong, it was due to the fact that he was born two thousand years before the telescope. But though an equal distance separated him from the invention of the pendulum clock, he improved the estimates of the length of the solar year by adding 1/1623 to the previous estimate of 365 1/4 days.\n\nThe treatise in which Aristarchus proclaimed that the sun, not the earth, was the centre of our world around which all planets revolve – this crowning achievement of Pythagorean cosmology, which Copernicus was to rediscover seventeen centuries later – is lost. But fortunately, we have the testimony of no smaller authorities than Archimedes and Plutarch, among others; and the fact that Aristarchus taught the heliocentric system is unanimously accepted by the ancient sources and modern scholars.\n\nArchimedes, the greatest mathematician, physicist and inventor of antiquity, was a younger contemporary of Aristarchus. One of his most curious works is a little treatise called The Sand Reckoner, dedicated to King Gelon of Syracuse. It contains the crucial phrase: “For he ( Aristarchus of Samos) supposed that the fixed stars and the sun are immovable, but that the earth is carried round the sun in a circle…” 10\n\nPlutarch’s reference to Aristarchus is equally important. In his treatise On the Face in the Moon Disc, one of the characters refers to Aristarchus of Samos who thought “that the heaven is at rest, but that the earth revolves in an oblique orbit, while it also rotates about its own axis.” 11\n\nThus Aristarchus of Samos had carried the development which started with Pythagoras and was continued by Philolaus and Herakleides, to its logical conclusion: the sun-centred universe. But here the development comes to an abrupt end. Aristarchus had no disciples and found no followers. 12 For nearly two millennia the heliocentric system was forgotten – or, shall one say, repressed from consciousness? – until an obscure Canon in Varmia, a remote outpost in Christendom, picked up the thread where the Samian had left off.\n\nThis paradox would be easier to understand if Aristarchus had been a crank, or a dilettante whose ideas were not taken seriously. But his treatise On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon became a classic of antiquity, and shows him as one of the foremost astronomers of his time; his fame was so great that nearly three centuries later Vitruvius, the Roman architect, starts his list of universal geniuses of the past with: “Men of this type are rare, men such as were in times past Aristarchus of Samos…” 13\n\nIn spite of all this, his correct hypothesis was rejected in favour of a monstrous system of astronomy, which strikes us today as an affront to human intelligence, and which reigned supreme for fifteen hundred years. The reasons for this benightedness will emerge only gradually, for we are faced here with one of the most astonishing examples of the devious, nay crooked ways of the “Progress of Science” – which is one of the main topics of this book.\n\nIV THE FAILURE OF NERVE\n\n1. Plato and Aristotle\n\nBY the end of the third century B.C., the heroic period of Greek science was over. From Plato and Aristotle onward, natural science begins to fall into disrepute and decay, and the achievements of the Greeks are only rediscovered a millennium and a half later. The Promethean venture which had started around 600 B.C., had within three centuries spent its elan; it was followed by a period of hibernation, which lasted five times as long.\n\nFrom Aristarchus there is, logically, only one step to Copernicus; from Hippocrates, only a step to Paracelsus; from Archimedes, only a step to Galileo. And yet the continuity was broken for a time-span nearly as long as that from the beginning of the Christian era to our day. Looking back at the road along which human science travelled, one has the image of a destroyed bridge with rafters jutting out from both sides; and in between, nothing.\n\nWe know how this happened; if we knew exactly why it happened, we would probably have the remedy to the ills of our own time. For the breakdown of civilization during the Dark Ages is in some respects the reverse of the breakdown that started, though less dramatically, in the Age of Enlightenment. The former can be broadly described as a withdrawal from the material world, contempt for knowledge, science and technology; rejec- tion of the body and its pleasures in favour of the life of the spirit. It reads like a mirror-writing to the tenets of the age of scientific materialism which begins with Galileo and ends with the totalitarian state and the hydrogen bomb. They have only one factor in common: the divorce of reason from belief.\n\nOn the watershed that separates the heroic age of science from the age of its decline, stand the twin peaks, Plato and Aristotle. Two quotations may illustrate the contrast in philosophical climate on the two sides of the watershed. The first is a passage from a writer belonging to the Hippocratic school, and dates presumably from the fourth century B.C.”It seems to me,” he says, dealing with that mysterious affliction, epilepsy, “that the disease is no more ‘divine’ than any other. It has a natural cause, just as other diseases have. Men think it divine merely because they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do not understand, why, there would be no end of divine things!” 1 The second quotation is from Plato’s Republic and sums up his attitude to astronomy. The stars, he explains, however beautiful, are merely part of the visible world which is but a dim and distorted shadow or copy of the real world of ideas; the endeavour to determine exactly the motions of these imperfect bodies is therefore absurd. Instead: “let us concentrate on (abstract) problems, said I, in astronomy as in geometry, and dismiss the heavenly bodies, if we intend truly to apprehend astronomy.” 2\n\nPlato is equally hostile to the Pythagoreans’ first and favourite branch of science. “The teachers of harmony,” he lets Socrates complain, “compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the astronomers, is vain.’ 3\n\nNone of this was probably meant to be taken quite literally, but it was – by that extremist school of Neoplatonism which dominated Western philosophy for several centuries, and stifled all progress in science – until, in fact, Aristotle was rediscovered and interest in nature revived. I have called them twin peaks separating two epochs of thought; but insofar as their influence on the future is concerned, Plato and Aristotle should rather be called twin-stars with a single centre of gravity, which circle round each other and alternate in casting their light on the generations that succeeded them. Until the end of the twelfth century, as we shall see, Plato reigned supreme; then Aristotle was resurrected and remained for two hundred years the philosopher, as he was commonly called; then Plato made a come-back, in an entirely different guise. Professor Whitehead’s famous remark: “the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists in a series of footnotes to Plato” could be amended by: “Science, up to the Renaissance, consisted in a series of footnotes to Aristotle.”\n\nThe secret of their extraordinary influence, intermittently stimulating and choking European thought, during such a near-astronomical period, has been the subject of passionate and neverending controversy. It is, of course, not due to any single reason, but to the confluence of a multitude of causes at a particularly critical point of history. To mention only a few, starting with the most obvious: they are the first philosophers of antiquity whose writings survived not in odd fragments, in second- or third-hand quotations, but in massive bulk ( Plato’s authenticated dialogues alone make a volume of the length of the Bible), embracing all domains of knowledge and the essence of the teachings of those who came before them; as if after an atomic war, among the torn and charred fragments, a complete Encyclopaedia Britannica had been preserved. Apart from bringing together all the relevant items of available knowledge in an individual synthesis, they were of course, in their own right, original thinkers of great creative power in such varied fields as metaphysics, biology, logics, epistemology and physics. They both founded “schools” of a new kind: the first Academy and the first Lyceum, which survived for centuries as organized institutions, and transformed the founders’ once fluid ideas into rigid ideologies, Aristotle’s hypotheses into dogmas, Plato’s visions into theology. Then again, they were truly twin-stars, born to complement each other; Plato the mystic, Aristotle the logician; Plato the belittler of natural science, Aristotle the observer of dolphins and whales; Plato, the spinner of allegorical yarns, Aristotle the dialectician and casuist; Plato, vague and ambiguous, Aristotle precise and pedantic. Lastly – for this catalogue could be continued forever – they evolved systems of philosophy which, though different and even opposed in detail, taken jointly seemed to provide a complete answer to the predicament of their time.\n\nThe predicament was the political, economic and moral bankruptcy of classical Greece prior to the Macedonian conquest. A century of constant war and civil strife had bled the country of men and money; venality and corruption were poisoning public life; hordes of political exiles, reduced to the existence of homeless adventurers, were roaming the countryside; legalized abortion and infanticide were further thinning out the rank of citizens. The history of the fourth century, wrote a modern authority, “is in some of its aspects that of the greatest failure in history… Plato and Aristotle … each in his different way tries (by suggesting forms of constitution other than those under which the race had fallen into political decadence) to rescue that Greek world which was so much to him, from the political and social disaster to which it is rushing. But the Greek world was past saving.” 4\n\nThe political reforms suggested by them concern us only insofar as they indicate the unconscious bias which permeates their cosmology; but in this context, they are relevant. Plato’s Utopia is more terrifying than Orwell’s 1984 because Plato desires to happen what Orwell fears might happen. “That Plato’s Republic should have been admired, on its political side, by decent people, is perhaps the most astonishing example of literary snobbery in all history,” remarked Bertrand Russell. 5 In Plato’s Republic, the aristocracy rules by means of the “noble lie”, that is, by pretending that God has created three kinds of men, made respectively of gold: the rulers, silver: the soldiers, and base metals: the common man. Another pious lie will help to improve the race: when marriage is abolished, people will be made to draw mating-lots, but the lots will be secretly manipulated by the rulers according to the principles of eugenics. There will be rigid censorship; no young person must be allowed to read Homer because he spreads disrespect of the gods, unseemly merriment, and the fear of death, thus discouraging people from dying in battle.\n\nAristotle’s politics move along less extreme, but essentially similar lines. He criticizes some of Plato’s most provocative formulations, but not only does he regard slavery as the natural basis of the social order – “the slave is totally devoid of any faculty of reasoning” 6 ; he also deplores the existence of a “middle” class of free artisans and professional men, because their superficial resemblance to the rulers brings discredit on the latter. Accordingly, all professionals are to be deprived of the rights of citizenship in the Model State. It is important to understand the source of this contempt of Aristotle for artisans, craftsmen architects, engineers and the like – by contrast, say, to the high esteem in which an Eupalinos, the tunnel-builder, had been held in Samos. The point is that Aristotle believed them no longer to be necessary, because applied science and technology had already completed their task. Nothing further need, or could, be invented to make life more comfortable and enjoyable, because “nearly all requisites of comfort and social refinement have been secured” and “everything of these kinds has already been provided.” 7 Pure science and philosophy “which deal neither with the necessities nor with the enjoyment of life” only arose, in Aristotle’s view, after the practical sciences had done all that they can ever do, and material progress had come to a halt.\n\nEven these cursory remarks may indicate the general mood underlying these philosophies: the unconscious yearning for stability and permanence in a crumbling world where “change” can only be a change for the worse, and “progress” can only mean progress toward disaster. “Change” for Plato is virtually synonymous with degeneration; his history of creation is a story of the successive emergence of ever lower and less worthy forms of life – from God who is pure self-contained Goodness, to the World of Reality which consists only of perfect Forms or Ideas, to the World of Appearances, which is a shadow and copy of the former; and so down to man: “Those of the men first created who led a life of cowardice and injustice were suitably reborn as women in the second generation, and this is why it was at this particular juncture that the gods contrived the lust for copulation.” After the women we come to the animals: “Beasts who go on all fours came from men who were wholly unconversant with philosophy and had never gazed on the heavens.” 8 It is a tale of the Fall in permanence: a theory of descent and devolution – as opposed to evolution by ascent.\n\nAs so often with Plato, it is impossible to say whether all this is to be taken literally, or allegorically, or as an esoteric leg-pull. But there can be no doubt concerning the basic trend of the whole system.\n\nWe shall have to hark back time and again to Plato, to pick up the scent of some particular later development. For the time being, let us retain this essential clue to Plato’s cosmology: his fear of change, his contempt and loathing for the concepts of evolution and mutability. It will reverberate all through the Middle Ages, together with its concomitant yearning for a world of eternal, changeless perfection:\n\nThen agin I think on that which Nature said\n\nOf that same time when no more change shall be,\n\nBut steadfast rest of all things, firmly stay’d\n\nUpon the pillars of eternity,\n\nThat is contrary to mutability. 9\n\nThis “mutation phobia” seems to be mainly responsible for the repellent aspects of Platonism. The Pythagorean synthesis of religion and science, of the mystical and empirical approach is now in shambles. The mysticism of the Pythagoreans is carried to sterile extremes, while empirical science is ridiculed and discouraged. Physics is separated from mathematics and made into a department of theology. The Pythagorean Brotherhood is transformed into the Guides of a totalitarian Utopia; the transmigration of souls on their way to God is debased by old-wife’s tales, or edifying lies, about cowards being punished by feminine reincarnations; orphic asceticism curdles into hatred of the body and contempt for the senses. True knowledge cannot be obtained by the study of nature; for “if we would have true knowledge of anything, we must be quit of the body… While in company with the body, the soul cannot have true knowledge.” 10\n\nAll this is not an expression of humility – neither of the humility of the mystic seeker for God, nor the humility of reason acknowledging its limits; it is the half-frightened, half-arrogant philosophy of the genius of a doomed aristocracy and a bankrupt civilization. When reality becomes unbearable, the mind must withdraw from it and create a world of artificial perfection. Plato’s world of pure Ideas and Forms, which alone is to be considered as real, whereas the world of nature which we perceive is merely its cheap Woolworth copy, is a flight into delusion. The intuitive truth expressed in the allegory of the Cave is here carried to absurdity by over-concretization – as if the author of the line “this world is a vale of tears” were to proceed with a factual survey of the distribution of tear-drops in the vale.\n\nOnce again one must remember, that in the surrealistic cosmogony of the Timaeus it is impossible to draw the line between philosophy and poetry, metaphorical and factual statement; and that long passages in the Parmenides virtually destroy the doctrine that the world is a copy of models in heaven. But if some of my previous paragraphs sound like a harsh and one-sided view of what Plato meant, this is essentially what he came to mean to a long row of future generations – the one-sided shadow that he threw. We shall also see that the second Platonic revival, in the fifteenth century, highlighted a quite different side of Plato, and threw his shadow into the opposite direction. But that turn is still a long way ahead.\n\n2. Rise of the Circular Dogma\n\nI must now turn to Plato’s contribution to astronomy – which insofar as concrete advances are concerned, is nil; for he understood little of astronomy, and was evidently bored by it. The few passages where he feels moved to broach the subject are so muddled, ambiguous or self-contradictory, that all scholarly efforts have failed to explain their meaning. 11\n\nHowever, by a process of metaphysical and a priori reasoning, Plato came to certain general conclusions regarding the shape and motions of the universe. These conclusions, of paramount importance for everything which follows, were that the shape of the world must be a perfect sphere, and that all motion must be in perfect circles at uniform speed.\n\n“And he gave the universe the figure which is proper and natural… Wherefore he turned it, as in a lathe, round and spherical, with its extremities equidistant in all directions from the centre, the figure of all figures most perfect and most like to itself, for he deemed the like more beautiful than the unlike. To the whole he gave, on the outside round about, a surface perfectly finished and smooth, for many reasons. It had no need of eyes, for nothing visible was left outside it; nor of hearing, for there was nothing audible outside it; and there was no breath outside it requiring to be inhaled… He allotted to it the motion which was proper to its bodily form, that motion of the seven motions which is most bound up with understanding and intelligence. Wherefore, turning it round in one and the same place upon itself, he made it move with circular rotation; all the other six motions [i.e., straight motion up and down, forward and back, right and left] he took away from it and made it exempt from their wanderings. And since for this revolution it had no need of feet, he created it without legs and without feet… Smooth and even and everywhere equidistant from the centre, a body whole and perfect, made up of perfect bodies…” 12\n\nAccordingly, the task of the mathematicians was now to design a system which would reduce the apparent irregularities in the motions of the planets to regular motions in perfectly regular circles. This task kept them busy for the next two thousand years. With his poetic and innocent demand, Plato laid a curse on astronomy, whose effects were to last till the beginning of the seventeenth century, when Kepler proved that planets move in oval, and not circular orbits. There is perhaps no other example in the history of thought of such dogged, obsessional persistence in error, as the circular fallacy which bedevilled astronomy for two millennia.\n\nBut here again, Plato had merely thrown out, in semi-allegorical language, a suggestion which was quite in keeping with the Pythagorean tradition; it was Aristotle who promoted the idea of circular motion to a dogma of astronomy.\n\n3. The Fear of Change\n\nIn Plato’s world the boundaries between the metaphorical and the factual are fluid; all such ambiguity disappears as Aristotle takes over. With pedantic thoroughness the vision is dissected, its poetic tissue is preserved in vitro, its volatile spirit condensed and frozen. The result is the Aristotelian model of the universe.\n\nThe Ionians had prised the world-oyster open, the Pythagoreans had set the earth-ball adrift in it, the Atomists dissolved its boundaries in the infinite. Aristotle closed the lid again with a bang, shoved the earth back into the world’s centre, and deprived it of motion.\n\nI shall describe the model first in its broad outline, and fill in the details later.\n\nThe immobile earth is surrounded, as in the earlier cosmologies, by nine concentric, transparent spheres, enclosing each other like the skins of an onion (see Fig. A, p. 46). The innermost skin is the sphere of the moon; the two outermost are the sphere of the fixed stars, and beyond that, the sphere of the Prime Mover, who keeps the whole machinery turning: God.\n\nThe God of Aristotle no longer rules the world from the inside, but from the outside. It is the end of the Pythagorean central fire, the hearth of Zeus, as a divine source of cosmic energy; the end of Plato’s mystic conception of the anima mundi, of the world as a living animal possessed with a divine soul. Aristotle’s God, the Unmoved Mover, who spins the world round from outside it, is the God of abstract theology. Goethe’s “Was wär’ ein Gott der nur von aussen stiesse” – seems to be aimed directly at him. The removal of God’s home from the centre to the periphery automatically transformed the central region, occupied by earth and moon, into that farthest away from Him: the humblest and lowliest of the whole universe. The space enclosed by the sphere of the moon and containing the earth – the “sub-lunary region” – is now considered definitely inferior. To this region, and to this region alone, are the horrors of Change, of mutability confined. Beyond the sphere of the moon, the heavens are eternal and unalterable.\n\nThis splitting-up of the universe into two regions, the one lowly, the other exalted, the one subject to change, the other not, was to become another basic doctrine of mediaeval philosophy and cosmology. It brought a serene, cosmic reassurance to a frightened world by asserting its essential stability and permanence, but without going so far as to pretend that all change was mere illusion, without denying the reality of growth and decline, generation and destruction. It was not a reconciliation of the temporal and the eternal, merely a confrontation of the two; but to be able to take in both in one glance, as it were, was something of a comfort.\n\nThe division was made intellectually more satisfactory and easier to grasp, by assigning to the two parts of the universe different raw materials and different motions. In the sub-lunary region, all matter consisted of various combinations of the four elements, earth, water, air and fire, which themselves were combinations of two pairs of opposites, hot and cold, dry and wet. The nature of these elements requires that they move in straight lines: earth downward, fire upward, air and water horizontally. The atmosphere fills the whole sub-lunary sphere, though its upper reaches consist not of proper air, but of a substance which, if set in motion, will burn and produce comets and meteors. The four elements are constantly being transformed one into the other, and therein lies the essence of all change.\n\nBut we go beyond the moon’s sphere, nothing changes, and none of the four terrestrial elements is present. The heavenly bodies consist of a different, pure and immutable “fifth element”, which becomes the purer the farther away from the earth. The natural motion of the fifth element, as opposed to the four earthly elements, is circular, because the sphere is the only perfect form, and circular motion is the only perfect motion. Circular motion has no beginning and no end; it returns into itself and goes on forever: it is motion without change.\n\nThe system had yet another advantage. It was a compromise between two opposite trends in philosophy. On the one side there was the “materialistic” trend, which had started with the Ionians, and was continued by men like Anaxagoras, who believed that homo sapiens owed his superiority to the dexterity of his hand; by Heraklitus, who regarded the universe as a product of dynamic forces in eternal flux; and culminated in Leucippus and Democritus, the first atomists. The opposite tendency, which originated with the Eleatics, found its extreme expression in Parmenides, who taught that all apparent change, evolution and decline, were illusions of the senses, because whatever exists cannot arise from anything that does not, or is different from it; and that the Reality behind the illusion is indivisible, unchangeable, and in a state of static perfection. Thus, for Heraklitus Reality is a continuous process of Change and Becoming, a world of dynamic stresses, of creative tensions between opposites; whereas for Parmenides Reality is a solid, uncreated, eternal, motionless, changeless, uniform sphere. 13\n\nThe preceding paragraph is, of course, a woeful oversimplification of developments in one of the liveliest periods of philosophic debate; but my purpose is merely to show how neatly the Aristotelian model of the universe solved the basic dilemma by handing over the sub-lunary region to the Materialists, and letting it be governed by Heraklitus’ motto “all is change”; whereas the rest of the universe, eternal and immutable, stood in the sign of the Parmenidian “nothing ever changes”.\n\nOnce again, it was not a reconciliation, merely a juxtaposition, of two world-views, or “world-feelings”, both of which have a profound appeal to the minds of men. This appeal was increased in power when, at a later stage, mere juxtaposition yielded to gradation between the opposites; when the original Aristotelian two-storey universe – all basement and loft – was superseded by an elaborately graded, multi-storeyed structure; a cosmic hierarchy where every object and creature had its exact “place” assigned to it, because its position in the many-layered space between lowly earth and high heaven defined its rank on the Scale of Values, in the Chain of Being. We shall see that this .concept of a closed-in cosmos graded like the Civil Service (except that there was no advancement, only demotion) survived for nearly a millennium and a half. It was really a Mandarin Universe. During these long centuries, European thought had more in common with Chinese or Indian philosophy than with its own past and future.\n\nHowever, even if European philosophy were only a series of footnotes to Plato, and even though Aristotle had a millennial stranglehold on physics and astronomy, their influence, when all is said, depended not so much on the originality of their teaching, as on a process of natural selection in the evolution of ideas. Out of a number of ideological mutations, a given society will select that philosophy which it unconsciously feels to be best suited for its need. Each time, in subsequent centuries, when the cultural climate changed in Europe, the twin stars also changed their aspect and colour: Augustine and Aquinas, Erasmus and Kepler, Descartes and Newton each read a different message in them. Not only did the ambiguities and contradictions in Plato, the dialectical twists in Aristotle, admit a wide range of interpretations and shifts of emphasis; but, by taking the two jointly or in alternation, by combining selected facets of each, the total effect could virtually be reversed; we shall see that the “New Platonism” of the sixteenth century was in most respects the opposite of the Neoplatonism of the early Middle Ages.\n\nIn this context I must briefly return to Plato’s loathing for change – for “generation and decay” – which made the sublunary sphere such a disreputable slum-district of the universe.\n\nAristotle himself did not share this loathing. As a keen biologist, he regarded all change, all movement in nature as purposeful and goal-directed – even the motions of inanimate bodies: a stone will fall to the earth, as a horse will canter to its stable, because that is its “natural place” in the universal hierarchy.
