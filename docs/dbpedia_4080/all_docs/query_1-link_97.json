Hghly collectable and legendary 1972 self-titled album by 9:30 Fly. Formed in Cheltenham in 1971, 9:30 were a highly original band who took in folk and progressive influences in their work.  Released on the Ember label in 1972, “9:30 Fly” is legendary for the originality of the music within and also for its great rarity. Although the album failed to make a commercial impression at the time of its release, it is now regarded as a milestone in Progressive/Folk Rock.

Label:LONGHAIR A vinyl-reissue of the spaced-out second album by the legendary Krautrock unit from Bonn, originally released in 1975. The music can be decribed as heavy blues-rock with a garagey toughness, an emphasis on psychedelic sonorities and trippy hippie vocals. This edition comes with remastered sound and an insert featuring the band&#039;s story and rare images.  LP  $28 SKU:24597AYERS, JAY - ST (1980 yacht rock perfection)-SAALE! Label:TAM  Jay Ayers’ self-titled album from 1980 opens with &#039;Midnight Lady,&#039; three minutes of yacht rock perfection. High-pitched doo-doos and la-la-las hover overhead as the supple rhythm section lays a rock-solid foundation and Ayers yearns desperately for love, even if it’s from a pro. Prominent acoustic guitars give the song rhythmic propulsion like some of the best country-rock hits of the era, and an unexpected clarinet appears midway through to sweeten the mix. &#039;Easy Way Out&#039; connects, delicately addressing depression with an appropriately melancholy backing and topped with a memorable vocal hook from Ayers in the way he sings the song’s title. The mood suddenly changes on side B, opening with a lively mashup of &#039;Different Drum&#039; and &#039;Mr. Tambourine Man.&#039; The guitars are jangly and the sound is more primitive. When he sings, Ayers sounds like a filthy drunkard wailing for quarters on a busy street corner. Instead of shortening the songs and butting them together to create a traditional medley, the tunes are carefully interwoven together, and the seams never show. The more reckless sound on side B shows more personality than the first half. The cover of &#039;American Girl’ perhaps doesn’t contain the conviction of the original, but the Petty-influenced &#039;It’s So Hard&#039; is an engaging power-popper with some nifty vocal interplay. I wonder if the mix of the slithery &#039;One More Night&#039; was intentional. The distant instruments and echo-heavy vocal create a smoky haze, enhancing the lyrics about foolishly holding on to someone.&quot; LP  $25 SKU:24382AZITIS - HELP (stunning West Coast  mystical psych)Label:MISSING VINYL A stunning West Coast psych styled religious, mystical, psychedelic firestorm.Strong melodies, gentle vocals, and moody passages with swirly organ that sound like they were lifted out of the middle of &#039;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&#039;.

Formed in late 1978, Connecticut&#039;s Reducers wowed thousands of fans with blazing tempos, catchy melodies and killer licks. &quot;You know, rock and roll like you dream about it.&quot; - Christgau, The Village Voice. &quot;The Reducers deftly execute that timeless musical somersault: they release rage and frustration via barbed guitar lines, growling vocals and pointed wit.&quot; - Boston Globe  CD  $10 SKU:24403VAGRANTS-I Can&#039;t Make A Friend 1965 - 1968 (The band that inspired The Ramones.)Label:LITA  The band that inspired The Ramones.Official collection of all the band’s singles recorded for such labels as Southern Sound, Vanguard, and ATCO. Release includes unseen photos, liner notes by Mike Stax (Ugly Things), and interview with Johnny Ramone. “Respect” featured on the original Nuggets compilation CD  $12 SKU:24191VALENTI,DINO -ST (overlooked classic 60s psych)Label:FLOATING WORLD  An overlooked classic of maybe the deepest 60&#039;s psychedelic/folk rock ever recorded. Born Chet Powers, Valente wrote the classic 60&#039;s hit ‘Get Together&#039; and soon became a prominent figure in the summer of love in San Francisco he joined Quicksilver Messenger Service in their early days and re-joined later as lead vocalist and main songwriter composing most of the material on “What About Me&quot; and “Just For Love.&quot; He also wrote the track &#039;Fresh Air,&#039; the nearest thing Quicksilver ever came to having a hit single. This album is the only solo work he ever produced and he sadly died in 1994. Dino Valente&#039;s sole album recalls the one issued by another San Francisco artist signed to CBS in the late &#039;60s, Skip Spence: quirky, lyrically vague, folky yet psychedelic, and nearly devoid of commercial potential in spite of its largely pleasant (if moody) melodies and textures. CD  $10 SKU:22186VICIOUS VISIONS - RETRODISRESPECT 1980-83 (holy grail in punk rock collector circles,)Label:BUSY BEE  Vicious Visions&#039; single &#039;I Beat You&#039; is a holy grail in punkrock collector circles, not just because of its limited run of only 109 copies but also because it is a MONSTER of a hit. Formed in Halmstad, Vicious Visions soon moved to Berlin and honed their craft in squats in the shadow of the iron wall. They may come from the same little town as Roxette but they sound more Berlin than Halmstad. Where the single was musically defined by the fact that the band at that time didn&#039;t have a drummer so they were forced to use a drum machine. &#039;Retrodisrespective&#039; can broaden the perception of\r\nVicious Visions as it includes both full band recordings as well as ones by the original core duo behind &#039;I Beat You&#039;. You&#039;ll get to enjoy everything from chaotic punk anthems to minimal Suicide-like no wave. CD  $19 SKU:24349VOLTA SOUND- MY ALL AMERICAN GIRL(BJM, SPACEMEN 3 STYLE)-Label:DIONYSUS ORANGE SKY Cleveland&#039;s The Volta Sound play an enticing blend of space pop rock and roll, kinda like Spiritualized meets Josie and the Pussycats. Fans of seminal groups such as The Dandy Warhols, Spacemen 3/Spiritualized, Brian Jonestown Massacre, and the Jesus and Mary ChaiDIONYSUS ORANGE SKYn will flip over these guys. CD  $5 SKU:19810VOLTA SOUND- THIS IS THE YIN AND THE YANG (BJM/SPACEMEN 3 STYLE)  -Label:DIONYSUS /ORANGE SKY  The Volta Sound follow up March 2001&#039;s critically My All American Girl and November 2001&#039;s Fast Light With Radio Signal EP (Elephant Stone Records) with their most powerful recording to date. While the aforementioned releases are fantastic collections of songs, this one flows like a true album, a cosmic space rock masterpiece, holding its own with the likes of Spacemen 3&#039;s The Perfect Prescription and The Brian Jonestown Massacre&#039;s Their Satanic Majesties Second Request CD  $5 SKU:19811WAKEFIELD - Lost Warthog tapes (1969 Colorado psych )Label:GEAR FAB  This psychedelic rock band from Pueblo, Colorado formed in 1969 and continued to play all over the Northwest until their breakup in 1974. The band recorded a concept album for Warthog Studios in Denver from 1971-72.  CD  $10 SKU:21735WALKER, SCOTT -In the Beginning (pre WAlker Brothers) Label:CASTLE PULSE  Before the brooding cult hero, before the Walker Brothers hits, came these late-&#039;50s cuts by a teenage Scott Engel (Walker&#039;s real name). You can hear that deep, resonant voice coming into flower as he sings &#039;Paper Doll&#039;, &#039;Too Young&#039;, &#039;Comin&#039; Home&#039;,  CD  $10 SKU:24333WEDGE--LIKE NO TOMORROW (power trio MC5 Deep Purple style) Label: HEAVY PSYCH SOUNDS The Berlin-based power trio once more is driving their musical Wedge in between many different genres: garage rock turns progressive while psychedelic guitar lines are tripping over hard rocking riffs. Does this work together? Hell yes! For fans of Deep Purple, MC5, Led Zeppelin or Humble Pie this album is a sure shot.  CD  $17 SKU:24320WEIRDOS - Destroy All Music  (1977 Los Angeles punk legends) w booklet- Label:BOMP  30th Anniversary Edition - The Weirdos were in many ways the greatest of L.A.&#039;s punk bands. In early 1977 their mighty sound and singular style were the big-bang igniting the L.A. punk rock scene, as they proclaimed &quot;we&#039;re not punks, we&#039;re weirdos from Hollyweird!&quot;. This wasn&#039;t just goofy sloganeering, this was a stance intended to distinguish them from the burgeoning punk rock scenes in New York and London. The Weirdos were not only bringing a new sound and writing teen punks anthems, they were also responsible for their graphics (posters, covers, flyers) and designed their own clothes! Their 1977 Bomp single &quot;Destroy All Music&quot; was a nihilistic anthem, and is now regarded as a classic, and by the time they made their mini-LP two years later they had turned into a powerful, polished band, without losing any of their outrageous attitude. &quot;Destroy All Music - 30th Anniversary Edition &quot; compiles the now classic 1977 EP Bomp  and the 1979 &quot;Who, What, When, Where, Why?&quot; mini-LP in its entirety and includes previously unreleased early demos. Comes with a 12 page booklet with photos and liner notes. CD  $10 SKU:22947WHITE NOISE SOUND- St- ( 3 tracks not on LP )( Spacemen 3 related psych ) Label:ALIVE WHITE NOISE SOUND is the eponymous debut from the Swansea/Cardiff, Wales-based sextet. Completed with the help of Pete Kember (Spacemen 3, Spectrum and E.A.R) and magician Cian Ciaran (Super Furry Animals), the album is is a psychedelic dream-piece, and the realization of a band conjuring their own particular wall-of-sound -- at once relentlessly pulsating and blissed-out.   MORE ON SITE  CD  $5 SKU:11924WILLIAMS, ANDRE - Life ((Garage soul with Matthew from Outrageous Cherry!))Label:ALIVE  Andre Williams&#039; new album, &quot;Life&quot; is absolutely stunning. It really doesn&#039;t matter how old this guy gets, he will always sing about the glory of the beautiful woman (&quot;Heels&quot;, &quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot;), being down on his luck (Don&#039;t Kick My Dog, Money Ain&#039;t Got No Loyalty) and, best of all on this record, current affairs (Blame it on Obama). A backing band featuring Matt Smith, Jim Diamond and Dave Shettler only helps enhance Williams&#039; dry, witty, deadpan delivery. Just wow.&quot; _ Brett Calwood / Detroit Metro Times CD  $10 SKU:14562WINTER, EDGAR - TELL ME IN A WHISPER The solo Albums -4 CD BOX Label:CHERRY RED   BOOKLET CONTAINS RARE SLEEVES AND MEMORABILIA  Edgar Winter is one of rock’s aristocrats. Ever since he first burst into focus at the start of the 1970s, the multi-instrumentalist has been renowned for his individuality combined with a commercial intelligence – he has achieved success, but always on his own terms. CD  $28 SKU:24003WITCHES-  A Haunted Person&#039;s Guide To ( Detroitpsych , last copies)- Label:ALIVE &quot;The best band that you never heard&quot; of is a term that is commonly thrown around with much ado but in the case of The Witches it may well be true. Born in Detroit in 1996 from the mind of bass player Troy Gregory (Dirtbombs, Killing Joke) and with the help of fellow Michigan natives John Nash (Electric Six, LCD Soundsystem) on guitar, and producer Jim Diamond (White Stripes, Von Bondies) on electric twelve-string, The Witches went on to record five amazing albums between 1996 and 2006, with the help of a revolving line-up of Michigan musicians, before vanishing into thin air. &quot;A Haunted Person&#039;s Guide To The Witches&quot; compiles material from the band&#039;s five albums, and is a comprehensive introduction to the band&#039;s unique sound. CD  $10 SKU:12502WOODEN LION -ST (unreleased 70s heavy psych )Label:AUDIO ARCHIVES On CD, here&#039;s one of the rarest previously unreleased heavy psych album from the early &#039;70s UK underground by the original five-piece band. Painstakingly re-mastered from the only surviving acetate, you get long, tripped-out tracks with an early Hawkwind feel, toughened by dark vocals that combine to make this a cosmic-doom classic. Highlights include the atmospheric &#039;Ice Maiden&#039;, the spaced-out &#039;She Paints Strange Pictures&#039; and their notorious tour de force, the lengthy three-part &#039;McAlistairess Phantoms&#039;. Plenty of rare band shots, items of memorabilia and detailed sleeve notes included in this long lost forgotten classic.  CD  $10 SKU:21108YAYS &amp;amp; NAYS- ST- ( 60s garage 6 stars in Pokora book!) MINI LP SLV -  Label:GROOVIE SPAIN  &quot;Monster rare USA private pressing from 1968, rated with 6 stars in the Hans Pokora 3001 book. The Yays &amp;amp; Nays were a groovy, hip group comprised of three guys and three girls. This is a truly unique sounding album, full of creative songwriting and vocal arrangements and a style that defies any categorization. There&#039;s some fab garage folk-rock on it (the opening track &#039;Gotta Keep Travelling&#039; is really astounding!), and also some tracks in a bizarre crooner-lounge &#039;Incredible Strange Music&#039; vein. Reissued for the first time, in collaboration with band members, and with original artwork.&quot; CD  $10 SKU:14713YOUNG SINCLAIRS- OUT OF THE BOX (Shoegaze/psych/soul BJM style)Label:REQUIEM POUR UN TWISTER Mix of shoegaze, folk-rock, psychedelia, soul, breakbeats, drone, tough R&amp;amp;B and bouncy pop. For fans of The Stone Roses, Brian Jonestown Massacre, New Order, Happy Mondays, The Byrds, Allah-Las, Mystic Braves, The Dream Syndicate and The Paisley Underground. The Young Sinclairs are a rock &#039;n roll band and they have been engineering and producing their own recordings in their hometown of Roanoke, Virginia since 2005, led by chief singer/songwriter/instrumentalist Samuel Lunsford. Their album &#039;Out Of The Box&#039; is a prime example of innate desire for creative expansion and innovation. The album title itself refers directly to a quest for freedom, and a refusal to be confined to any specific style, form, or label CD  $15 SKU:22129YUM YUMS-For Those About To Pop!(catchy hi-energy, guitar-driven power-pop )Label:RUM BAR  Stacked with catchy hi-energy, guitar-driven power-pop songs, complete with multi-layered harmonies.

CD  $10 SKU:22941ZOOT MONEY-Transition (LOST 70S PSYCH GEM)-Label:RIGHTEOUS  An excellent album! Featuring the same players who were in the Big Roll Band (including future Police guitarist Andy Summers) on all tracks, Zoot Money came up with this tip-top set, which has soulful ballads, up-tempo mod material and a couple of dreamy sitar numbers written by Summers; &#039;Soma&#039; inspired Summers and Money to push the boundaries and encouraged the band to wig out further, and in a state of psyche-pop bliss, they decided they were so far out of the Big Roll Band sound that they should change their name to Dantalian&#039;s Chariot. They played shows with the Pink Floyd and featured a couple of the tracks from “Transition” in stranger incarnations; Dantalion’s became a cult classic in the process, but turned their existing mod following off and failed to ignite. After the Dantalion hiatus, “Transition” was finally released (in 1968) on the Direction label; by that time, the mods had embraced the psychedelic bug and the album slipped into obscurity, and became one of those buried treasures that is talked of but seldom actually even seen. Finally, this lost gem has made it to CD. Remastered from the original quarter inch tapes, with all of its glorious sweeping sounds, aching vocals and groovy upbeat tunes intact, it&#039;s the epitome of cool.

Side one is a neo classical prog rock epic in the style of Renaissance and Continuum, inspired by the wild and pagan isles of St Kilda where, as a 16 yr old, the composer Peter McKerrow was taken by military launch to conduct a census on the rare Soay Sheep that live there. A storm blew away his tent on the first night. The other side is by his Canadian pal who attended the same Uni in england, deeply homesick for Canada and surviving a broken relationship these songs are melancholic and Leonard Cohen-esque. The original Lp is astonishingly gorgeous and one of the most desirable artifacts of the prog era.” Gatefold edition, limited to 500x copies.

LP  $20 SKU:17143BACHELOR PAD-ALL COCK AND HASH-THE VERY BEST OF-(80s Psych indie punk poppers)Label:EMOTIONAL RESPONSE During the &#039;80s and early &#039;90s, Glasgow&#039;s psychedelic indie-punk poppers Bachelor Pad released some astonishing music, bringing to mind The Buzzcocks fronted by Syd Barrett!

(GREAT SOUTHERN BOOGIE-Gram Parsons, the Allman Brothers, Muscle Shoals, early Skynrd, Canned Heat, Creedence  style)Label:ALIVE   &quot;There is a Bomb in Gilead&quot; – which is a lyric of a traditional spiritual about the salvation of the soul (the “balm”, not “bomb”) that Bains misheard as a child – incorporates some of the most iconic regional styles of American music. With a nod to Jim Ford, Gram Parsons, the Allman Brothers, Muscle Shoals, early Skynrd, Canned Heat, Creedence and all that Southern boogie goodness, &quot;There is a Bomb in Gilead&quot;  sees Lee Bains III &amp;amp; The Glory Fires deconstruct the music of the Deep South, strip it down and reassemble it, to make a righteous ruckus that sits at the vanguard of the vernacular.\r\n LP  $20 SKU:15968BANSHEE(USA)-LIVIN&#039; IN THE JUNGLE (fired up fury of The Stooges, MC5 &amp;amp; Alice Cooper) COLORED VINYL -Label:CARDINAL FUZZ Hailing from Boston and blazing red hot cinders through your eyes Banshee channel widescreen, kick out the jams m*therfuckers psyche-rock-a-rama with a singer doing his best to channel both Alice and Iggy. Yes they rock like crazy and play with the fired up fury of The Stooges, MC5 and The Alice Cooper Group as they let their freak flag fly. On &#039;Livin In The Jungle&#039; Banshee detonate over 11 tracks of pure diamond arrangements that will lay you out flat and have your head swirling from the whallop of the sleazy voodoo racket that Banshee have created. Informed in equal parts by the intensity of &#039;60s Detroit and The Alice Cooper Group and with a rhythmic underbelly the calls on in parts the funk explosion of WAR. From the opening Intro of &#039;Genesis&#039; amid a barrage of bells, chimes jungle sounds and a group feeling the funk they lay straight into &#039;The Law&#039; where without missing a beat and over a blast of guitar riffs, dive bombing bass lines, thunderous drums and a voice that spits out and caterwails with a vengeance you find Banshee freewheelin&#039; into what will become your favourite rock&#039;n&#039;roll LP for 2020. The engine has started and the whole record is executed at a breakneck pace that is a furious rollercoaster ride to sweet oblivion. On the final epic sprawl that is &#039;Caged Birds&#039; which starts out with a garage like Sister Ray bump&#039;n&#039;grind chug before descending into a glorious meltdown of fuzzed up wah wah guitars and glockenspiels before everything finally fades back into the jungle. &#039;Livin In The Jungle&#039; is one rabid rock&#039;n&#039;roll animal of a record.

LP  $18 SKU:18554BEATNIK TERMITES -ST (Cleveland power pop/punk) YELLOW VINYL Label:HEY SUBURBIA Cleveland power-pop punk trio Beatnik Termites was another group of Ramones fanatics that merged a heavy Ramones influence with a love of surf rock; their caustic pop melodies and ironic, stinging lyrics turning the soft underbelly of pop music on its head, yielding a sound that had tinges of innocence, beneath a knowing, thrash-rock wink. Front man Pat Kim (AKA Pat Termite) started the band back in 1987 with drummer Reggie Silvestri and bassist Brian McCafferty, the group was reputedly a favourite of Nirvana&#039;s Kurt Cobain according to his diaries. This is a limited reissue of their hyper rare debut 6 tracks 12&quot;, whose original copies are impossibile to find for decent prices online. All Ramones maniacs now can fill that hole in their collection thanks to the Hey Suburbia label. Limited to 300 copies on yellow vinyl with fully remastered sound.  LP  $24 SKU:24429BEATRICE-TAMADAS!

Label:TAM Jay Ayers’ self-titled album from 1980 opens with 'Midnight Lady,' three minutes of yacht rock perfection. High-pitched doo-doos and la-la-las hover overhead as the supple rhythm section lays a rock-solid foundation and Ayers yearns desperately for love, even if it’s from a pro. Prominent acoustic guitars give the song rhythmic propulsion like some of the best country-rock hits of the era, and an unexpected clarinet appears midway through to sweeten the mix. 'Easy Way Out' connects, delicately addressing depression with an appropriately melancholy backing and topped with a memorable vocal hook from Ayers in the way he sings the song’s title. The mood suddenly changes on side B, opening with a lively mashup of 'Different Drum' and 'Mr. Tambourine Man.' The guitars are jangly and the sound is more primitive. When he sings, Ayers sounds like a filthy drunkard wailing for quarters on a busy street corner. Instead of shortening the songs and butting them together to create a traditional medley, the tunes are carefully interwoven together, and the seams never show. The more reckless sound on side B shows more personality than the first half. The cover of 'American Girl’ perhaps doesn’t contain the conviction of the original, but the Petty-influenced 'It’s So Hard' is an engaging power-popper with some nifty vocal interplay. I wonder if the mix of the slithery 'One More Night' was intentional.

Born Chet Powers, Valente wrote the classic 60's hit ‘Get Together' and soon became a prominent figure in the summer of love in San Francisco he joined Quicksilver Messenger Service in their early days and re-joined later as lead vocalist and main songwriter composing most of the material on “What About Me\" and “Just For Love.\" He also wrote the track 'Fresh Air,' the nearest thing Quicksilver ever came to having a hit single. This album is the only solo work he ever produced and he sadly died in 1994. Dino Valente's sole album recalls the one issued by another San Francisco artist signed to CBS in the late '60s, Skip Spence: quirky, lyrically vague, folky yet psychedelic, and nearly devoid of commercial potential in spite of its largely pleasant (if moody) melodies and textures. CD $10 SKU:22186\n\nVICIOUS VISIONS - RETRODISRESPECT 1980-83 (holy grail in punk rock collector circles,)Label:BUSY BEE Vicious Visions' single 'I Beat You' is a holy grail in punkrock collector circles, not just because of its limited run of only 109 copies but also because it is a MONSTER of a hit. Formed in Halmstad, Vicious Visions soon moved to Berlin and honed their craft in squats in the shadow of the iron wall. They may come from the same little town as Roxette but they sound more Berlin than Halmstad. Where the single was musically defined by the fact that the band at that time didn't have a drummer so they were forced to use a drum machine. 'Retrodisrespective' can broaden the perception of\n\nVicious Visions as it includes both full band recordings as well as ones by the original core duo behind 'I Beat You'. You'll get to enjoy everything from chaotic punk anthems to minimal Suicide-like no wave.

CD $17 SKU:24320\n\nWEIRDOS - Destroy All Music (1977 Los Angeles punk legends) w booklet- Label:BOMP 30th Anniversary Edition - The Weirdos were in many ways the greatest of L.A.'s punk bands. In early 1977 their mighty sound and singular style were the big-bang igniting the L.A. punk rock scene, as they proclaimed \"we're not punks, we're weirdos from Hollyweird!\". This wasn't just goofy sloganeering, this was a stance intended to distinguish them from the burgeoning punk rock scenes in New York and London. The Weirdos were not only bringing a new sound and writing teen punks anthems, they were also responsible for their graphics (posters, covers, flyers) and designed their own clothes! Their 1977 Bomp single \"Destroy All Music\" was a nihilistic anthem, and is now regarded as a classic, and by the time they made their mini-LP two years later they had turned into a powerful, polished band, without losing any of their outrageous attitude. \"Destroy All Music - 30th Anniversary Edition \" compiles the now classic 1977 EP Bomp and the 1979 \"Who, What, When, Where, Why?\" mini-LP in its entirety and includes previously unreleased early demos. Comes with a 12 page booklet with photos and liner notes. CD $10 SKU:22947\n\nWHITE NOISE SOUND- St- ( 3 tracks not on LP )( Spacemen 3 related psych ) Label:ALIVE WHITE NOISE SOUND is the eponymous debut from the Swansea/Cardiff, Wales-based sextet. Completed with the help of Pete Kember (Spacemen 3, Spectrum and E.A.R) and magician Cian Ciaran (Super Furry Animals), the album is is a psychedelic dream-piece, and the realization of a band conjuring their own particular wall-of-sound -- at once relentlessly pulsating and blissed-out.

It really doesn't matter how old this guy gets, he will always sing about the glory of the beautiful woman (\"Heels\", \"Shake a Tail Feather\"), being down on his luck (Don't Kick My Dog, Money Ain't Got No Loyalty) and, best of all on this record, current affairs (Blame it on Obama). A backing band featuring Matt Smith, Jim Diamond and Dave Shettler only helps enhance Williams' dry, witty, deadpan delivery. Just wow.\" _ Brett Calwood / Detroit Metro Times CD $10 SKU:14562\n\nWINTER, EDGAR - TELL ME IN A WHISPER The solo Albums -4 CD BOX Label:CHERRY RED BOOKLET CONTAINS RARE SLEEVES AND MEMORABILIA Edgar Winter is one of rock’s aristocrats.

CD $28 SKU:24003\n\nWITCHES- A Haunted Person's Guide To ( Detroitpsych , last copies)- Label:ALIVE \"The best band that you never heard\" of is a term that is commonly thrown around with much ado but in the case of The Witches it may well be true. Born in Detroit in 1996 from the mind of bass player Troy Gregory (Dirtbombs, Killing Joke) and with the help of fellow Michigan natives John Nash (Electric Six, LCD Soundsystem) on guitar, and producer Jim Diamond (White Stripes, Von Bondies) on electric twelve-string, The Witches went on to record five amazing albums between 1996 and 2006, with the help of a revolving line-up of Michigan musicians, before vanishing into thin air. \"A Haunted Person's Guide To The Witches\" compiles material from the band's five albums, and is a comprehensive introduction to the band's unique sound. CD $10 SKU:12502\n\nWOODEN LION -ST (unreleased 70s heavy psych )Label:AUDIO ARCHIVES On CD, here's one of the rarest previously unreleased heavy psych album from the early '70s UK underground by the original five-piece band. Painstakingly re-mastered from the only surviving acetate, you get long, tripped-out tracks with an early Hawkwind feel, toughened by dark vocals that combine to make this a cosmic-doom classic. Highlights include the atmospheric 'Ice Maiden', the spaced-out 'She Paints Strange Pictures' and their notorious tour de force, the lengthy three-part 'McAlistairess Phantoms'. Plenty of rare band shots, items of memorabilia and detailed sleeve notes included in this long lost forgotten classic. CD $10 SKU:21108\n\nYAYS & NAYS- ST- ( 60s garage 6 stars in Pokora book!)

The Yays & Nays were a groovy, hip group comprised of three guys and three girls. This is a truly unique sounding album, full of creative songwriting and vocal arrangements and a style that defies any categorization. There's some fab garage folk-rock on it (the opening track 'Gotta Keep Travelling' is really astounding!), and also some tracks in a bizarre crooner-lounge 'Incredible Strange Music' vein.

The Young Sinclairs are a rock 'n roll band and they have been engineering and producing their own recordings in their hometown of Roanoke, Virginia since 2005, led by chief singer/songwriter/instrumentalist Samuel Lunsford. Their album 'Out Of The Box' is a prime example of innate desire for creative expansion and innovation.

Featuring the same players who were in the Big Roll Band (including future Police guitarist Andy Summers) on all tracks, Zoot Money came up with this tip-top set, which has soulful ballads, up-tempo mod material and a couple of dreamy sitar numbers written by Summers; 'Soma' inspired Summers and Money to push the boundaries and encouraged the band to wig out further, and in a state of psyche-pop bliss, they decided they were so far out of the Big Roll Band sound that they should change their name to Dantalian's Chariot. They played shows with the Pink Floyd and featured a couple of the tracks from “Transition” in stranger incarnations; Dantalion’s became a cult classic in the process, but turned their existing mod following off and failed to ignite. After the Dantalion hiatus, “Transition” was finally released (in 1968) on the Direction label; by that time, the mods had embraced the psychedelic bug and the album slipped into obscurity, and became one of those buried treasures that is talked of but seldom actually even seen. Finally, this lost gem has made it to CD. Remastered from the original quarter inch tapes, with all of its glorious sweeping sounds, aching vocals and groovy upbeat tunes intact, it's the epitome of cool.

Side one is a neo classical prog rock epic in the style of Renaissance and Continuum, inspired by the wild and pagan isles of St Kilda where, as a 16 yr old, the composer Peter McKerrow was taken by military launch to conduct a census on the rare Soay Sheep that live there. A storm blew away his tent on the first night. The other side is by his Canadian pal who attended the same Uni in england, deeply homesick for Canada and surviving a broken relationship these songs are melancholic and Leonard Cohen-esque.

(GREAT SOUTHERN BOOGIE-Gram Parsons, the Allman Brothers, Muscle Shoals, early Skynrd, Canned Heat, Creedence style)Label:ALIVE \"There is a Bomb in Gilead\" – which is a lyric of a traditional spiritual about the salvation of the soul (the “balm”, not “bomb”) that Bains misheard as a child – incorporates some of the most iconic regional styles of American music. With a nod to Jim Ford, Gram Parsons, the Allman Brothers, Muscle Shoals, early Skynrd, Canned Heat, Creedence and all that Southern boogie goodness, \"There is a Bomb in Gilead\" sees Lee Bains III & The Glory Fires deconstruct the music of the Deep South, strip it down and reassemble it, to make a righteous ruckus that sits at the vanguard of the vernacular.\n\nLP $20 SKU:15968\n\nBANSHEE(USA)-LIVIN' IN THE JUNGLE (fired up fury of The Stooges, MC5 & Alice Cooper) COLORED VINYL -Label:CARDINAL FUZZ Hailing from Boston and blazing red hot cinders through your eyes Banshee channel widescreen, kick out the jams m*therfuckers psyche-rock-a-rama with a singer doing his best to channel both Alice and Iggy.

On 'Livin In The Jungle' Banshee detonate over 11 tracks of pure diamond arrangements that will lay you out flat and have your head swirling from the whallop of the sleazy voodoo racket that Banshee have created. Informed in equal parts by the intensity of '60s Detroit and The Alice Cooper Group and with a rhythmic underbelly the calls on in parts the funk explosion of WAR. From the opening Intro of 'Genesis' amid a barrage of bells, chimes jungle sounds and a group feeling the funk they lay straight into 'The Law' where without missing a beat and over a blast of guitar riffs, dive bombing bass lines, thunderous drums and a voice that spits out and caterwails with a vengeance you find Banshee freewheelin' into what will become your favourite rock'n'roll LP for 2020. The engine has started and the whole record is executed at a breakneck pace that is a furious rollercoaster ride to sweet oblivion. On the final epic sprawl that is 'Caged Birds' which starts out with a garage like Sister Ray bump'n'grind chug before descending into a glorious meltdown of fuzzed up wah wah guitars and glockenspiels before everything finally fades back into the jungle. 'Livin In The Jungle' is one rabid rock'n'roll animal of a record. Limited to 500 copies on coloured vinyl.

Front man Pat Kim (AKA Pat Termite) started the band back in 1987 with drummer Reggie Silvestri and bassist Brian McCafferty, the group was reputedly a favourite of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain according to his diaries.
