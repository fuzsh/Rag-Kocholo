Any major changes to this page, will be announced here.\n\nJanuary 4, 2009 I just noticed that Sundazed Records is working on a Moby Grape - live, a compilation of live tracks. I am not sure of a release date yet.\n\nApril 28, 2009 Sundazed Records just released Moby Grape - The Place And The Time, a compilation of live tracks, demos, alternative takes and outtakes. As soon as I pick up my copy, I will detail it out on my web site.\n\nJune 20, 2008 I just picked up my copy of Moby Grape '69 and Truly Fine Citizen and having finished updating this site with the recording information on the original tracks as well as the bonus tracks included on both CDs.\n\nDecember 7, 2007. While surfing the web recently, not only did I find out that ALL the Moby Grape CDs are being released with bonus tracks, but that due to legal issues, the first three (Moby Grape, Wow, Grape Jam) are being withdrawn from circulation. For the completist / collector, you should still be able to find some stores that still have some CDs in stock at a reasonable price. I wish you luck in finding them. Their next 2 CDs (Moby Grape '69 and Truly Fine Citizen) are still available at all the regular locations.\n\nMay 31, 2007. You can now listen to streaming free music from this band as well as others at Wolfgangs Vault.\n\nJuly 18, 2005. I just noticed that the ezBoard message board that I had set up for this web site had been deleted. Since restoration of the deleted conference is only available to subscribers to their service, and since the activity was relatively light, I not planning on looking for another message board. If you do think a message board is worth while, or you have a message board that you like, let me know and I may promote it here. As always you can contact me here.\n\nJanuary 24, 2002. The upcoming movie, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" may use two Moby Grape posters:\n\nSeptember 6-7, 1968 The Bank, Torrance, CA\n\nApril 12-13, 1968 Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, CA\n\nas part of the set dressing for one of the scenes.\n\nMarch 10, 2001. It looks like I may have been premature in moving to a new web hosting site. I just found out that whenever Tripod.com is having hardware or software problems with their servers, they put up a message for the webmaster that their site is in violation of terms, and the web site has been deleted (instead of a message about system problems and try again later). Anyway, I believed Tripod.com when they said they deleted my account, so I will be moving, and making chromeoxide.com my new home on the web.\n\nMarch 10, 2001. As long as I am moving my entire site, I decided to make a few changes to the layout of the individual pages, and the web site in general, including (but not limited to) I removed the counter, and moved the listings of mirror sites to the bottom of the page, ...\n\nMarch 6, 2001. Sometime between March 1 to March 5, 2001 Tripod deleted my account/web site. The last stats Tripod gave me were 9,000+ visitors per month. Since my site is so popular, I have decided to keep it going, in spite of this major setback. But rather than trying to build up another free web site, and possibly deal with this problem again, I decided go with CommandLine.net to host the new chromeoxide.com.\n\nOctober 31, 2000. The new Chrome Oxide Music Collectors Pages Message Board is provided by EZBoard.\n\nOctober 31, 1999. There used to be a complete listing of all the bands featured on this site at the bottom of each page on this site. The complete band list has now been moved to the Site Map.\n\nBack in June 1997 when I started this site, the index at the bottom of the page seemed like a good idea. Due to the amazing growth of this site, I now think that the Site Map is a better way to do it.\n\nI will continue to list the featured band of the month at the bottom of each page on this site.\n\nDecember 3, 2002 CD Now is undergoing changes, and asked that ALL links be removed.\n\nOctober 28, 1999 I signed up with CD Now.\n\nOctober 22, 1999. The Chrome Oxide Music Collector Pages web site hit the big time! And I didn't even know it.\n\nTripod stats showed that this web site had more than 4,000 unique visitors last month (September 1999). Because of that, Tripod has increased my web space from 11mb to 50mb.\n\nSeptember 22, 1999. Bob Mosley visited this site.\n\nMay 21, 1999. On the advice of legal counsel, we have now added a copyright notice, and legal disclaimer to the bottom of each page on this web site.\n\nMay 1, 1999. Added some new Other Moby Grape Links.\n\nMarch 25, 1999. Where have all the Moby Grape sites gone? Here is all the information that I have.\n\nMarch 16, 1999. Thanks to a recent visitor to this page, we now have a logo for the Chrome Oxide Music Collectors Pages, as well as a new background and seperator bars. There may be additional changes to look forward to as well.\n\nNovember 12, 1998. I started a new section on this page, Classifieds. A friend has an original vinyl LP he is interested in selling.\n\nJuly 22, 1998. I started working on this page.\n\nMOBY GRAPE\n\nINTRO\n\n[Top (page index)] [Up] [Down] [Bottom (site index)]\n\nMoby Grape was a 1960s rock band from San Francisco that was overly hyped at its debut, and never recovered from it. Each of the five members of the band was a singer as well as songwriter and good musician. And they were able to go from psychedelic rock to ballads to country to blues to ... and still be convincing.\n\nJerry Miller is still involved with music, his new band is Dai Bando\n\nComments and corrections would be appreciated.\n\nAnd of course, any audio-video-print additions to my collection would be appreciated.\n\nI am also interested in getting wider exposure for this site. So links from your site to mine would be appreciated. And if you know of any sites that allow/encourage submission, I would also appreciate knowing about them as well.\n\nDo you have any articles, books, albums, tapes, CDs, ... on this band that you would like reviewed and / or integrated into this page?\n\nDo you have any other band that you would like to see a page for on this site?\n\nPlease send to:\n\nChrome Oxide\n\nP.O.Box 8106\n\nMission Hills, CA 91346-8106\n\nChrome Oxide\n\nMOBY GRAPE\n\nPersonnel\n\n[Top (page index)] [Up] [Down] [Bottom (site index)]\n\nPERSONNEL: September 1966 to June 1968 Jerry Miller - guitar Skip Spence - guitar Peter Lewis - guitar Bob Mosley - bass Don Stevenson - drums PERSONNEL: June 1968 to February 1969 Jerry Miller - guitar Peter Lewis - guitar Bob Mosley - bass Don Stevenson - drums PERSONNEL: February 1969 to April 1969 Jerry Miller - guitar Peter Lewis - guitar Bob Moore - bass Don Stevenson - drums\n\nMOBY GRAPE\n\n1966 Live Shows\n\n[Top (page index)] [Up] [Down] [Bottom (site index)]\n\nPERSONNEL: September 1966 to June 1968 Jerry Miller - guitar Skip Spence - guitar Peter Lewis - guitar Bob Mosley - bass Don Stevenson - drums LIVE SHOW: November 4, 1966 California Hall, San Francisco, CA (first public live show according to \"Vintage Grape - 2 CD set\") LIVE SHOW: November 11, 1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: November 12, 1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: November 12, 1966 Gay 90's, San Francisco, CA LIVE SHOW: November 25, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) (26 minute tape + http://psychedelicsight.com/moby-grape-set-lists/) Rounder Stop Bitter Wind Fall on You G-1-2 Miller's Blues Dark Magic Ain't No Use Indifference Changes LIVE SHOW: November 26, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) LIVE SHOW: November 27, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) LIVE SHOW: December 2, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) LIVE SHOW: December 3, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) LIVE SHOW: December 4, 1966 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA (p2) LIVE SHOW: December 6, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 7, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 8, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 13, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA LIVE SHOW: December 14, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA LIVE SHOW: December 15, 1966 The Matrix, San Francisco, CA LIVE SHOW: December 23, 1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 24, 1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 29, 1966 uan Venetia Armory, San Rafael, CA (p1) LIVE SHOW: December 30, 1966 Avalon Ballroom, San Francisco, CA (p1) Sweet Little Angel I Am Not Willing Frisco Jam Bitter Wind Hey Grandma Sittin By The Window Murder In My Heart For The Judge Gonna Tell Ya (?

So you can still go to a page with the various bands products, buy you now need to go through a search box.\n\nAs always, let me know what you think.\n\nApril 22, 2002.\n\nWould you like to show your appreciation for (the time, effort, money, ... that goes into creating, maintaing, updating) this web site, without getting anything in return (except a listing of your name (and url) on this web site as a friend of this web site)?\n\nsign up for PayPal and simplify your online payments.\n\nSend Chrome Oxide some money\n\nDecember 3, 2002 CD Now is undergoing changes, and asked that ALL links be removed.\n\nOctober 28, 1999 I signed up with CD Now.\n\nMOBY GRAPE\n\nEND OF DOCUMENT\n\n[Top (page index)] [Up] [Down] [Bottom (site index)]\n\nSITE MAP/INDEX\n\n[Chrome Oxide Music Collectors Page]\n\n[Chrome Oxide Music Audio Recording Services]\n\n[Chrome Oxide: Web Hosting and Maintenance Services]\n\n[e-mail Chrome Oxide]\n\n[Photo Gallery] [Reference Material] [Chrome hEARing] [Reviews Page] [Links Page]\n\n[News] [Record Swap Meets] [Live Show Calendar] [Contests]\n\nBand of the month for March 2004: [Raw Power Rangers]\n\nBook review of the month for October 2006: [Skydog - The Duane Allman Story]\n\nBands covered on this site: [Site Map]\n\nSearch WWW Search www.chromeoxide.com\n\nLast updated by Chrome Oxide on 05/17/2010\n\nCopyright © 1998 - 2008 by Chrome Oxide\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE Materials may be freely copied and distributed subject to the inclusion of the copyright notice and our Web site address.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER This site contains links to other Internet sites.
