        "text": "Consumer Guide Drafts for Rhapsody, 2007\n\nUnresolved\n\nA number of questions remain on how to handle these reviews. They tend to fall into various groups.\n\nCapsule reviews that have no known text source. Those from 2006-07 most likely come from Rolling Stone. Earlier ones are more likely to have come from Blender, although Rolling Stone is also possible, or some other infrequent (and poorly monitored) source. In some cases I have marginal notes, like a number suggesting a star rating; also included CG grades where known (S=choice cut, X=dud). These are:\n\nAir: Pocket Symphony (2007, Astralwerks): [2.5]\n\nThe Byrds: The Byrds Sing Dylan (2002, Columbia/Legacy): [3]\n\nThe Gothic Archies: The Tragic Treasury (2006, Nonesuch): [CG: A-]\n\nThe Hold Steady: Boys and Girls in America (2006, Vagrant): [CG: A-]\n\nJason Isbell: Sirens of the Ditch (2007, New West): have source [Rolling Stone: 3.5], but no pub date; [CG: *]\n\nDavid Kilgour: Frozen Orange (2004, Merge): [2; CG: X]\n\nLos Lobos: The Town and the City (2006, Hollywood/Mammoth): [CG: S]\n\nTaj Mahal: Taj Mahal (1968, Columbia)\n\nBiz Markie: Weekend Warrior (2003, Tommy Boy): [Blender: 3; CG: S]\n\nPaul McCartney: Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard (2005, Capitol): [Blender: 2; CG: X]\n\nChristine McVie: In the Meantime (2003, Koch): [Blender: 2; CG: X]\n\nNils Petter Molvaer: An American Compilation (2006, Thirsty Ear): [CG: A-]\n\nNils Petter Molvaer: Streamer (2006, Thirsty Ear): [CG: A-]\n\nWillie Nelson/Merle Haggard/Ray Price: Last of the Breed Vol 1 & 2 (2007, Lost Highway): [Rolling Stone: 3.5; CG: A-]\n\nThunderbirds Are Now!: Make History (2006, Frenchkiss): [CG: A-]\n\nRamones: Weird Tales of the Ramones (2005, Sire/Rhino): [3]\n\nSoul Coughing: New York, NY 16-08-99 (2004, Kufala): [3.5]\n\nRichard Thompson: Sweet Warrior (2007, Shout! Factory): [Rolling Stone: 3; CG: *]\n\nCG-style one-liners. These look like honorable mentions, but weren't published in any known Consumer Guide. I'm guessing these were unpublished, written for possible future book use. Best thing here would be to give them star-grades and drop the [unknown] source tag.\n\nAir: Talkie Walkie (2004, Astralwerks)\n\nFanfare Ciocarlia: Gili Garabdi (2005, Asphalt Tango)\n\nGhostface Killah and Trife Da God: Put It on the Line (2005, Starks Enterprises)\n\nJ-Zone: A Job Ain't Nuthin but Work (2004, Fat Beats/Old Maid Entertainment): [CG: *]; this is the only case where the source is in HM format and CG has a different HM format line\n\nJon Langford and the Pine Valley Cosmonauts: The Executioner's Last Songs Volume 2 & 3 (2003, Bloodshot)\n\nBoban Markovic Orkestar: Live in Belgrade (2002, Piranha)\n\nMaroon 5: Songs About Jane (2002, Octone): [*]\n\nPlacebo: Black Market Music (2000, Virgin)\n\nRilo Kiley: Take Offs and Landings (2001, Barsuk)\n\nTheodore Unit: 718 (2004, Sure Shot)\n\nUnited State of Electronica: United State of Electronica (2004, Sonic Boom)\n\nRecombination Questions. In some (but not all cases) I combined the Rhapsody review with an existing CG entry. The only cases I did this for were graded Choice Cuts or Duds. The other existing CG entries were held to be preferable, although one could argue over HMs -- the Rhapsody reviews provide more information, but the CG format is the established norm for such records (at least since 1990) and they usually try to say the same things. On the other hand, Duds have no reviews, so anything in the Rhapsody review is a plus for information, making them more analogus to reviewed Duds. For Choice Cuts the two entries do quite different things -- I thought it especially useful to combine the two for large compilations, such as Michael Jackson's The Ultimate Collection, which in CG was reduced to a choice cut list.\n\nOne may argue that I should back out the recombinations and only go with official CG versions: those entries are listed under Recombined below.\n\nOr, more likely, one can argue that I should go ahead and recombine the rest of the Choice Cuts/Duds rated entries, which are:\n\nMacy Gray: Big (2007, Geffen): [CG: S]\n\nNorah Jones: Come Away With Me (2002, Blue Note): [CG: S]\n\nDavid Kilgour: Frozen Orange (2004, Merge): [CG: X]\n\nBiz Markie: Weekend Warrior (2003, Tommy Boy): [CG: S]\n\nPaul McCartney: Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard (2005, Capitol): [CG: X]\n\nChristine McVie: In the Meantime (2003, Koch): [CG: X]\n\nMeat Puppets: Rise to Your Knees (2007, Anodyne): [CG: S]\n\nStephin Merritt: Pieces of April (2003, Nonesuch): [CG: S]\n\nJoni Mitchell: Shine (2007, Hear Music): [CG: X]\n\nMe'shell Ndeg√©ocello: The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams (2007, EmArcy): [CG: S]\n\nKelly Willis: Translated From Love (2007, Rykodisc): [CG: X]\n\nBrian Wilson: Gettin' in Over My Head (2004, Rhino): [CG: X]\n\nNote: some of these are also on the unknown sources list above, which was one reason I held out doing them.\n\nCross-Referenced Records Without CG Reviews. In the past I've created dummy CG entries for records that are featured in essays but never had a CG review published. Many of those were eliminated by the Rhapsody reviews, which basically hoist cross-referenced text. That leaves the following dummy CG entries, which would be candidates for the same treatment:\n\nBlack Box Recorder: The Facts of Life (2001, Jetset): See: Sex Tips for Teens. A\n\nMary J.

Most cases were rewritten to appear in a CG, many reduced to one-line HMs. Below find first the Rhapsody review with its cross-reference, then the actual (retained) CG entry.\n\nJohn Anderson: Easy Money (2007, Warner Bros.) New traditionalist stalwart Anderson finally returns to the label of his '80s heyday, aided by producer John Rich of Big & Rich. Rich also co-composed five songs, most notably the pre-breakup \"A Woman Knows\" and the rambunctious \"Brown Liquor.\" This is a committed set, but Rich is overextended, and the fifty-two-year-old Anderson needs zippier material than he used to. On its finale, Willie and Merle themselves come to the rescue--a little too late. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nAided by his godson John Rich, he achieves \"funky country\" once again -- but not when he puts it that way (\"Brown Liquor,\" \"A Woman Knows\") *\n\nAnimal Collective: Strawberry Jam (2007, Domino) The sixth album by this neo-communalist, neo-psychedelic Gotham quartet improves on the model of 2005's Feels, flashing more shards of tune to lure the coeds with the Coleman PerfectFlow InstaStart Lanterns over to their unkempt campfire. The welcoming \"Peacebone,\" the energetic \"Chores,\" and the elated \"Cuckoo Cuckoo\" might get a young leisure consumer to risk conversion at one of the grotty neo-primitivist orgies their shows are bruited to be. Then again, the ninety seconds of weirded-up organ ostinato that then underlies or swallows three minutes of incomprehensible singing on \"Winter Wonder Land\" might inspire the same normal to stay home and watch Seinfeld reruns. It depends on how he or she felt about the six-minute centerpiece \"For Reverend Green,\" where the listener strains to hear frontman Avey Tare rave, \"I think it's all right to feel human now.\" Great, really. But didn't we know that already? Rolling Stone: 3]\n\n\"The other side of takeout is mildew on rice\" convinced me that they Know Life--but then I started to wonder again (\"Peacebone,\" \"Cuckoo Cuckoo\"). *\n\nAnubian Lights: Phantascope (2004, Rhythmbank) Twenty-five years ago, Adele Bertei was the androgynous gamine whose uncanny timing on a cheap organ made her the secret weapon of James Chance's punk-funk Contortions. Unfortunately, her eagerly awaited next moves turned out to be a few forgettable club hits. But here she emerges from involuntary retirement to fulfill her promise with L.A.-via-London beatmasters Tommy Grenas and Len Del Rio. \"Wild Winter\" and \"Way Gone Man\" are as mean and angular as her old fans might dream. And though things chill out once they're done, she's become a crafty vocalist, and her bandmates have gifts in the electro mode she favored in the '80s: try the Africanized \"New Wildlife,\" or the Enofied \"Ultraviolet.\" [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nTwice removed, Adele Bertei contorts herself (\"Wild Winter,\" \"Way Gone Man\"). **\n\nBuju Banton: Too Bad (2006, Gargamel) Blessed with the biggest voice and most active conscience in dancehall and only 27 as the millennium turned, Buju Banton lost his way. His political message softened, and crucially, both his 2000 Unchained Spirit, on punk-linked Anti-, and 2003 Friends for Life, on reggae powerhouse VP/Atlantic, were more crooned than toasted. So this return to basics is a welcome improvement--stateside, Banton's never released such a headlong album. Also welcome is how skillfully he skirts the crude sexism and gangsta-influenced posturing that are today's ragga norm. But that's not to say he's got a bunch of crossover smashes here--fact is, he doesn't even have one. The beats hammer along, often relying on pleasingly weird and surprisingly effective low-pitched sounds in the organ family. But only when his musicians start playing (the Ventures'!) \"Walk Don't Run\" under \"Me and Oonu\" do they take off--for three minutes. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nFor him, dancehall is roots reggae, to which he returns none too soon (\"Me & Oonu,\" \"Jig\"). **\n\nBright Eyes: Cassadaga (2007, Saddle Creek) Musically, Cassadaga is a fully formed synthesis of the catch-as-catch-can expansiveness of Coner Oberst's Lifted-era bands with the country tendencies that have always undergirded his Middle American vocals. Longtime enabler Mike Mogis is everywhere, playing 10 instruments all told, and Nate Walcott mans multiple keyboards and arranges strings and woodwinds. In short, Oberst's prog and jam-band tendencies are both subsumed by a sensibility that's Americana in a winning, all-embracing sense--Americanapolitan, let's call it. And for the most part the material measures up. The first song establishes a crisis, the second suggests a quest, and \"Soul Singer in a Session Band\" explores mid-career artistic confusion like thousands of songs before it, only more memorably. Topping them all are \"Classic Cars,\" as fine a reflection on June-September love as Rod Stewart's \"Maggie May,\" and \"Make a Plan to Love Me,\" for a career woman who whatever her real-life identity is not unlike millions of young women embroiled in similar romantic contradictions. With the help of four professional backup girls cooing the title hook, maybe Oberst will inspire a few resolutions. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nIn a banner year for indie semistars such as the Shins, Spoon, the New Pornographers and their major-matriculated kin, Conor Oberst's emotional directness stands out. He's verbose and sometimes addled. But he's not ironic--only Arcade Fire go for the gut with such gusto. From numerous contenders, my favorite song months after they arrived begs for a John Legend or Taylor Hicks cover: \"Make a Plan to Love Me,\" which could have been written on his Blackberry and sent instantly to the career woman of his dreams--in about 20 pieces. A-\n\nBuck 65: Situation (2007, Strange Famous) The rapper raised in Nova Scotia as Richard Terfry almost tripped over his own ecumenicism on 2005's U.S.-unreleased Secret House Against the World--lots of keyboard, with singing to match. On this \"hooked on drums\" return, his worst offense against the basics is a concept--1957, among many other things the year the Situationist International began. Fortunately, the title is the last we hear of that. The concept is really just a rubric, a device to help him control his insatiable appetite for colloquial poetry. It permits him to write songs about Betty Page and shutterbug porn, right, but also beatniks, hobos, gray-flannel conformists, and cops in shades--while tossing off rhymes like \"apocalypse\"-\"rocket ships\" and \"Drown in doubt. Down and out.\" Buck 65's percussive funk and gruff flow serve language that deserves no less. Anybody who can write a song that shows the Beatles the door is worth a check-out, right? \"Nowhere Man,\" meet \"Mr. Nobody.\" [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nTimelag-wise, the 1957 concept is as if some '60s songpoet had conceived an album about Armistice Day, influenza, the Palmer raids and Mary Pickford. Only that would have been a milestone and this isn't, which you can blame on heightened aesthetic expectations rather than the potency of this Canadian rapper's literary mojo. Abandoning cabaret dalliances, Buck growls \"tenfold\"-\"Glenn Gould\" and \"go study\"-\"Mr. Nobody\" over insistent purist-plus beats. He's content to be a bohemian who knows something, like for instance who the \"know-nothing bohemians\" were. Beatniks, declared outraged 1958 square Norman Podhoretz, who would say the same in 2008 about Richard Terfry if he wasn't so busy bombing Iran. Podhoretz, I mean. Terfry's just bombing him. A-\n\nJohnny Cash: The Legend (2005, Columbia/Legacy) Before he died of complications from diabetes in 2003, Cash recorded upwards of 60 LPs for Columbia's Nashville division between 1958 and 1982 as well as many tracks for Sun, three Mercury albums, and eight CDs worth of material for Rubin. As his mystique has grown, so has the listenability of his catalogue, much of it now reissued or repackaged. Yet though it has no Rubin stuff. this supplants 1990's Essential Johnny Cash as a definitive introduction. Its risky strategy of devoting an entire disc to folk songs, half hootenanny and half campfire sing, and another to collaborations with the likes of Dylan, Ray Charles, U2, Elvis Costello, Waylon Jennings, Rosanne Cash, and especially the Carter Family, finds good songs and fits them together. Even the eight previously unreleaseds blend in; \"Doin' My Time\" and \"You Can't Beat Jesus Christ\" shine. [Blender: 5]\n\nCash recorded almost as much as Elvis and has been reissued more than God, but this quadruple will satisfy most of us, in part because we can think of things we miss--\"Next in Line\"! \"Come In Stranger\"! \"Singin' in Viet Nam Talking Blues\"! \"The Mystery of Life\"! We all have our own Johnny Cash, that's one of his strengths, which means we learn a little something from other people's, as in the previously unreleased Billy Joe Shaver duet \"You Can't Beat Jesus Christ.\" The box omits the stark Rick Rubin stuff of his old age, which made him a \"legend\" if anything did. But when I test-drove the confusingly titled single-disc The Legend of Johnny Cash, topped off with a few renowned Rubin songs, the sudden dropoff reinforced my reservations about his late-life need to let his charisma stand in for his voice. A\n\nManu Chao: La Radiolina (2007, Nacional/Because) In 2001, Euro-rocker Manu Chao celebrated his fortieth birthday with the most miraculously accessible album in the history of \"world music.\" Proxima Estacion: Esperanza, a buoyant, melodically linked rhythm suite in three languages, now seems such a natural fact that you may listen awhile to its very long-awaited follow-up before you remember that it too had to sink in. But eventually the more guitar-based sonics here will feel inevitable too, especially once you follow the same dynamic riff through three consecutive songs up front. The attention getter, especially in Anglophone America, will be \"Rainin' in Paradize,\" which curtly explains why country after country in Africa and the Middle East is \"no good place to be.\" But anyone with some high school French can parse \"Besoin de la Lune\"'s two-minute catalogue of simple human needs just after that--and then wonder what the hell language \"El Kitapena\" is in (Catalan? Galician Portuguese?). Most of the second half is in Spanish, including an anti-fame song and one that seems to reference heavy rains in Ecuador. Its true subject, however, is the return of that riff--which definitely makes you want to learn more about Ecuador. [Rolling Stone 3.5]\n\nWhat Chao does seems so easy that it's hard to believe it took him seven years to follow up the sweetly relaxed, justly beloved Proxima Estaci√≥n. Maybe he's just lazy--it's not like he's a work ethic guy. Or maybe he wanted to do something different and took a while settling into what that might be--namely, a new tempo. This is a speedier pop suite suitable for dancing or straightening up the flat. The guitars remind us that Chao launched his career from the Eurorock-en-Espanol Mano Negra, and the lyrics in French and Spanish seem as conscious as the English-language offerings \"Politik Kills\" and \"Rainin in Paradize.\" These are rock moves, you could say. Yet the deepest accommodations are with glitzy, synthy, militantly shallow Europop. Seven years after 2001, what other populace can a radical internationalist such as Chao hope to enlighten? Not ours, I'm afraid. A-\n\nRay Charles: Ray Charles and Betty Carter/Dedicated to You (1998, Rhino) With all respect to Raelett Margie Hendricks, Carter, who later emerged as a major avant-garde jazz vocalists, proves the most gifted woman singer Charles ever worked with, matching him as they honor such tunes as \"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,\" \"For All We Know,\" and \"Baby It's Cold Outside.\" But you can safely skip most of Dedicated to You, a concept album about girls' names that smarms out past \"Stella by Starlight\" and \"Sweet Georgia Brown. [Rolling Stone]\n\n12 Ella & Louis bids with Betty, 12 songs to women whose names he's long since forgotten (\"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\" \"Takes Two To Tango\"). **\n\nRay Charles: Genius & Soul: The 50th Anniversary Collection (1997, Rhino) Selected in part by Brother Ray himself, reportedly upon the occasion of a seven-figure advance. Genius & Soul stands astride all of Charles's work, testifying noisily to his continuing vitality. Of course preferences vary. Of course there are classics passed by (\"Mess Around\") and rarities that deserve nothing better (\"The Cincinnati Kid\"). But embrace Charles's all-embracing aesthetic and you'll agree that, as seldom happens with these megaboxes, the final CD is a worthy companion to the first--that in fact Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" and Paul Simon's \"Still Crazy After All These Years,\" which end it, are more typical and just plain better than Ray's own \"Confession Blues\" and \"Baby Let Me Hold Your Hand,\" which begin it. [Rolling Stone]\n\nAlthough I admit that if he was still alive I still wouldn't have gotten through this five-disc behemoth, on my shelves since 1997, the selected schlock at the end is as powerful as the seminal G-word at the beginning, and the size of the thing suits him. Of course it overlaps unconscionably with the classic Birth of Soul box, which does the same with the pretty damn good Blues + Jazz double. That's the way Ray planned it. Buy this in remembrance of him. A\n\nPatsy Cline: The Definitive Collection (2004, MCA) Patsy Cline's soulful, precision-phrased twang was the perfect articulation of what became modern country. Unfortunately, her material was inconsistent and her production the all-too-perfect articulation of what provincial Nashville considered cosmopolitan. Believers go straight to the four-CD Patsy Cline Collection; skeptics are converted by the unadorned Live at the Cimarron Ballroom. But this intelligently remastered collection from her brief early-'60s heyday buries the echo-laden Patsy Cline Story as the single-disc Cline of choice on audio alone. Not only that, the selection rocks--better \"Half as Much\" and \"Lovesick Blues\" than \"South of the Border\" and \"Tra Le La Le La Triangle.\" And as a bonus the \"Walkin' After Midnight\" is the 1957 one, from before Owen Bradley saddled her with all those backup choruses. [Blender: 5]\n\nIn tone, timbre, and timing, Cline was the best-equipped female country singer ever. Where Dolly, Loretta, and Tammy are all downhome in their own ways, her swinging drawl still evokes the fleshpots--Raleigh! Richmond! Washington, D.C.!--and it's hard to imagine a more intelligent document of her 15 months of fame. \"Crazy,\" \"I Fall to Pieces,\" \"She's Got You,\" \"Half as Much\"--these are perfect songs perfectly sung, now remastered to eliminate the echo that once dulled them. But though she survives Owen Bradley's strings and Nashville cats, his choruses remain, and unless you're focused, forgiving, or a sucker for kitsch, their hmms and oohs and doo-doo-doos do her in. Essential singing and history in an economical package that was long overdue. Fans will love it. But except in research mode, I bet I still play her live stuff. A-\n\nJames Luther Dickinson: Killer From Space (2007, Memphis International) Acolyte of Furry Lewis and Sleepy John Estes, sideman of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, producer of Big Star, the Replacements, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, world-class songbag, downhome bon vivant, and fond father of several North Mississippi Allstars, Jim Dickinson is a legend. And since no mere record album could measure up against such a resume, it's a credit to the only label ever to finance two of them that this one reaches its shoulders. Dickinson is a roots-rocker with attitude who made his name as a piano man; always gruff-voiced and now sixty-five, he can't put across a sweet tune like \"I Was a Champion\" on sly smarts alone. But he's jovially horny on \"Roly Poly\" and \"You Better Rock Me Baby.\" He's more broken-up than the titles of \"Lonely Nights\" and \"I Need You\" deserve. And when he caps \"Dirty on Yo Mama\" with a sermon about mendacity, damned if you don't believe. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nMore good songs he discovered and you never heard of (\"Dirty on Yo Mama,\" \"No No Never Again\"). *\n\nBob Dylan: Modern Times (2006, Columbia) Neither as existentially bleak as the fabricated folklore of Time Out of Mind nor as waggish and vivacious as \"Love and Theft\"'s coin of the minstrel-boy realm, he radiates the observant calm of old masters who have seen enough life to be ready for anything--Yeats, Matisse, Sonny Rollins. On a music-first record that leavens blues shuffles with the moderate tempos and politely jazzy beat favored by Dylan hero Bing Crosby in the early '30s, the finest moment is the descending 16-note hook that runs through \"Spirit on the Water.\" Though it belongs on a piano, it's usually stated on an acoustic guitar and then taken up by shifting combinations of standup-sounding bass and Dylan's touring band. Sometimes it fades out early, but it always comes back, and you want it to--for all eight minutes of the song. Nice though it would be for the title to indicate \"current events,\" the likely reference is Charlie Chaplin's 1936 movie masterpiece. In both, a legendary entertainer does what he wants because nobody can stop him, and the world is better for it. [Blender: 4.5]\n\nIt took Dylan five years to create this conservative album even if he laid it down in a week, and I doubt he could have gotten it done at all without cribbing rhetoric from a shallower conservative, Confederate poet Henry Timrod. When not calling his new nation to arms or locating Satan's domicile north of the Mason-Dixon line, Timrod had a gift for genteel sentiment that's essential to the old-fashioned tone here, and Dylan grabbed what he needed. But note the intrusion of his old friend deliberate barbarism when, for instance, Timrod's \"logic frailer than the flowers\" produces Dylan's \"more frailer than the flowers.\" Without such touches, the conservatism would be stultifying. The blues tropes help, too. Then again, without the '30s pop, the blues grooves would be stultifying. Instead, the entire construction is a thing of grace--conservative, and new under the sun. A+\n\nSteve Earle: Washington Square Serenade (2007, New West) Supposedly this Steve Earle record is unlike all other Steve Earle records because it was recorded with beats. But production by Dust Brother John King notwithstanding, it impacts just like any other Steve Earle record--lyrics first. So fans will follow the title's hint-hint and take this for the New York record of a Texan turned Nashvillian turned Greenwich Villager. After all, two of its strongest songs are \"Down Here Below,\" a talky pan-NYC meditation from the twin vantages of Central Park hawk Pale Male and old-school New Yorker journalist Joseph Mitchell, and \"City of Immigrants,\" which is as warmly appreciative as the subject deserves. Both pop up early on what is definitely a front-loaded collection. Two fine love songs to Earle's wife, harmony-singing Allison Moorer, come with one that drags. The endless, bandless, grooveless \"Red Is the Color\" drags more. And the Tom Waits cover--oy. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nMore songs about mortal struggle and mortal struggle--which can be beautiful, he's decided (\"Down Here Below,\" \"City of Immigrants\"). *\n\nFountains of Wayne: Traffic and Weather (2007, Virgin) The big problem with anointing Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger the great standard bearers of modern popsong is that there's no one else like them. Really, who? Max Martin? John Mayer? The Blur guys when they got along? If Fountains of Wayne resemble anyone, it's Randy Newman, who also escapes contract work with tunefully insouciant albums now and then. Difference is, Newman sounds as sour as he is, while Fountains of Wayne don't let on. Here they fail to provide the elusive novelty follow-up to \"Stacy's Mom,\" but nonetheless invent many dandy new ways not to be in love. Two lonely young professionals don't-meet cute (she beats him to a cab in the rain); anchorpeople reveal their undying mutual attraction to fans awaiting the ballscores; a single proves so jaded she'd rather move back to Canada than pursue true romance with a Lichtensteinian in Bowling Green. Wasted potheads, doomed gamblers, and, oh yes, touring musicians also make their appointed rounds. On the rare occasions when love does rule, it's nine hours away on I-95 or has just lost its luggage. But with that DMV clerk they might just have a chance. You'll hope so. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nIf Chris Collingwood and Adam Schlesinger were mere satirists, they would be They Might Be Giants. Instead they're lyric poets of what a more naive era called yuppieness, only now we know things aren't so simple--even middle-class people who just want to make some dough are in trouble if they were born after, say, 1965. The title newspeople, the lawyer and the photo assistant who beats him for a cab? They're doing OK. But the guy who's accessorizing his \"'92 Subaru\"? Much less so. \"Strapped for Cash\"'s gambler anonymous? Not at all. And it's to the band's credit that they want us to know that. But when they home in on the economic, they tend to be satirists only, so it's crucial that as pop adepts who know what closes on Saturday night, they also traffic in romance--and weather it. Sometimes they're hopeless at love, like the lonely antagonists in that cab drama called \"Someone to Love\"; sometimes, as in the DMV fantasy \"Yolanda Hayes,\" they're delusional in a nice way; sometimes, as in \"I-95\" and \"Fire in the Canyon,\" they're troubled. So they all need \"Michael and Heather at the Baggage Claim,\" where love triumphs over the geographical displacements that skew so many of these songs. They all also need tunes you'll hum, and get them. A\n\nGhostface Killah: More Fish (2006, Def Jam) No reason to expect much of this hastily assembled holiday product, which began with outtakes from the midlevel Wu-man's other 2006 album, Fishscale--except that the current century has proven Ghostface the most irrepressible rapper of his generation with the obvious exception of his label president. This lacks Fishscale's intensity and focus, and Ghost's Theodore Unit helpers will never be Clansmen, although the possessed everyman grit of \"Grew Up Hard\"'s beleaguered soldier G suggests that Trife Da God has learned something from Forest Whitaker. Out of 15 tracks, however, only the crassly sexist \"Greedy Bitches\" is devoid of charm. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nNot really rehashed leftovers but definitely a Christmas snack, this could prove a paradigm shift: major label--not Sanctuary meets De La or Koch doing its thing--sticks with quality artist past his commercial prime because he'll certainly break even and possibly sell long-term. Granted, it could just be Jay-Z playing his remaining executive cred for the greater glory of his artistic legacy (which would also be a paradigm shift). But hip-hop is now where rock was in the early '80s, when veterans such as Joni Mitchell, Randy Newman and Lou Reed were the equivalent of what the book trade called publishers' poets back when commercial publishers dealt poetry. Whether doing his ex-Wu thing or mixtaping with the Theodore Unit pals showcased here, Ghostface always tells a good story and finds a good beat. This isn't the gauntlet Fishscale was. It's just a good bunch of songs. Thank UniMoth for venturing capital on it. A-\n\nThe Gothic Archies: The Tragic Treasury (2006, Nonesuch) Stephin Merritt is so facile he gets a lot of contract work, which whether or not it works in context comes off precious and miscellaneous on his other 2006 album, Showtunes. But these songs, aimed at the precocious youngsters who jones for the gleeful gothic gloom of the Lemony Snicket novels that have made sometime Magnetic Fields sideman Daniel Handler very rich, are of a thematic piece. Perfect for Merritt's melancholy baritone, they also satisfy his appetite for rhyme. \"The world is a very scary place, my dear,\" Merritt intones. \"It's hurled and it's twirled through outer space, I fear.\" Comedy record of the year. [unknown]\n\nHard to believe when the creepy-comic opener, \"Scream and Run Away,\" is topped by the closer, an all-time classic novelty with the unpromising title \"We Are the Gothic Archies,\" as in \"Are the Gothic Archies we? Oh, are we ever they!\" But though smarty-pants Lemony Snicket fans may get references I miss, in between there are times when Stephin Merritt's monotonous low baritone seems merely inexpressive, as on \"How Do You Slow This Thing Down?\" (please, not slower, eeek!). Said baritone is perfect for the deadpan horror of \"Crows,\" however. He's the scariest boy on the Lower East Side. A-\n\nGogol Bordello: Super Taranta! (2007, Side One Dummy) \"There were never any good old days/They are today, they are tomorrow/It's a stupid thing we say/Cursing tomorrow with sorrow.\" So swears \"Ultimate,\" the smartest song Gogol Bordello has ever recorded and the smartest song anyone will release this year. The beat won't be to everyone's taste: a defiantly oversimplified Gypsy stomp played loud and then double-timed by a Russian violinist, a Russian accordionist, an Israeli guitarist, an Ethiopian bassist, and an American drummer. But it rocks. And its optimism of the will makes the futures imagined by competing alt prophets seem weak-minded. This is an explosive album by a band on a mission. Nominally based in Brooklyn, Chernobyl survivor Hutz and his cohort fuse Gypsy statelessness and rock-bohemian \"Wanderlust\"--the title of a song about \"challenging definitions of sin\"--for a restive world citizenry uprooted by war and capital. If you're not an immigrant, they hint, you're lucky, but you also don't know what it is to be alive. Which makes you doubly lucky that Gogol Bordello has figured out how to tell you. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nBecause I so adored 2005's Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike (making it hard to accept a follow-up), feared overselling an act seen as exotic (accordions and violins are wilder than keybs) and loved the opener so much it dwarfed the rest (\"There were never any good old days\"--exactly), I hedged my emotions here. But six months after I got the advance, I love it all. Dubbing in a nonreggae reggae tribute, laughing about immigration's generation gap, turning \"frustration into inspiration\" and disillusion into resolve, the four somewhat less tuneful songs in the middle sum up Eugene Hutz's politics of joy. He leads the world's most visionary band. And once you learn to hear its multicontinental get-down, rooted in the Balkans' Islamo-Christian stomp, it's also one of the hardest rocking. A+\n\nThe Go! Team: Proof of Youth (2007, Sub Pop) This second piece of exuberant Brighton Brit-hop begins by resurrecting the great lost shorties Lisa Lee and Sharrock, of the early hip-hop crews Cosmic Force and Funky Four Plus One respectively, as resident genius Ian Parton folds their 1984 BBC cameos into a typically jammed-up track that's rife with trebly guitars and spiked by a four-man horn section. \"Grab Like a Vice\" is such a stroke that this auspicious follow-up album never tops it, hotter and louder than the auspicious debut though it may be. Still, it's the rare band that can switch from sampled music to live with no loss in riffage as they do here, and the almost-famous names who hitch themselves to Ninja's vocals do themselves a solid. Favela funkster Marina Vello commits \"Titanic Vandalism.\" Elizabeth Esselink makes like her one-woman electro act Solex is a girl group. And Chuck D definitely knows what he's rapping about. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nJust when you're ready to give up and apply to graduate school, along comes a simple band who get everything right. True, they're not very tuneful. But they're danceable, Ninja raps plenty well enough, and have there ever been beats like Ian Parton's, with their chants and strums and melodica statements? Plus a warm-up from Sha Rock and Lisa Lee, who I hope got their checks, and a sum-up from Chuck D, who I expect secured his in advance. A-\n\nMacy Gray: Big (2007, Geffen) When Billie Holiday moved from Vocalion to Decca in 1944, she insisted that her first session for the hit-oriented label include a string section. It worked, too--\"Lover Man\" sold. In the direct corporate descendant of that shift, Macy Gray, her miraculous burred croon far more Holiday-like than most voices subjected to the comparison, gets the same treatment from new producer Ron Fair, whose credits include Lisa Loeb, Christina Aguilera, the Black Eyed Peas, and the presidency of A&M Records. As will.i.am's programming on \"Ghetto Love\" and Larry Gold's violins on \"Okay\" remind us, there's string writing and then there's string writing. Fair's is concentrated sugar water, and Gray, whose words have never bitten like her voice and who adds kink with a murder song as pointless as \"I Committed Murder\" was pointed, too often pens lyrics and sings tunes just as cloying. The strategy may work and may not. But no way will it yield a \"Lover Man.\" [Rolling Stone: 2.5]\n\n\"Get Out,\" \"Okay,\" \"Ghetto Love\"\n\nDebbie Harry: Necessary Evil (2007, Five Seven Music) Believe Debbie Harry's claim that love moved her to create her first solo album in fourteen years with the obscure NYC production team Super Buddha. Professionally, she must like these people; artistically, she's old enough at sixty-two to feel that life is too short for irony--for the role-playing she's specialized in since Blondie. Unfortunately, Super Buddha's pop-rock tends toward the ordinary just like these excellent values. Yes, their songs can be playful. You'll notice when the guitars escalate on \"You're Too Hot,\" when Harry sotto-voces her sexpot act on \"Dirty and Deep.\" But you'll really notice when a long diminuendo fourteen tracks in proves a bridge to the last three songs. The first is punky Afro-pop played entirely by Harry's Blondie-mate Chris Stein, the last a first-person meditation on suicide bombing by another old pal, Jazz Passenger Roy Nathanson. Both dwarf the rest of the record. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nNah, she's not Blondie -- Blondie was a band, and still is (\"Jen Jen,\" \"Paradise\"). *\n\nThe Hold Steady: Boys and Girls in America (2006, Vagrant) Keyed to the Jack Kerouac line \"Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together,\" Craig Finn and company's third release in three years doesn't approach the faith-based weight of 2005's Separation Sunday, and somebody should stomp down hard on Franz Nicolay's cornball Boss keyboards. Nevertheless, the album makes its point with an abundance of narrative flair. The saddest entry is \"You Can Make Him Like You,\" for a pretty girl who always finds another guy when she gets tired of her boyfriend's buddies or music or drugs. The happiest is \"Chillout Tent,\" where the sadness is comic and the mook has his moment with the Bowdoin girl. [unknown]\n\nSasha Frere-Jones has nominated the Mountain Goats, and now the Decemberists come to mind even though their songs are fictive rather than reported/recollected/observed, but for me the nearest parallel to this band is the Drive-By Truckers. Both bands match the descriptions they stuff into their traditional narrative structures to a specific rock tradition: Skynyrd-Allmans for the Truckers' songs of the South, Springsteen for Hold Steady's new generation of shadows in the backstreets. That said, this album lays it on too thick--all right already with the keyb flourishes, which suit their mawkish new emo label all too well--and declines the thematic burden of Separation Sunday. As stories, on the other hand, the songs could convince anyone that kids have a hard time--without giving whiners any sort of go-ahead to throw their lives away. All accomplished without directly referencing ye olde rock-and-roll lifestyle--unless you count \"Chillout Tent,\" in which two strangers freak at a festival and live to make out about it. But that's about fans, not bands. This band is for the fans. A-\n\nImperial Teen: The Hair the TV the Baby & the Band (2007, Merge) So about that title. Hair: Jone Stebbins tours with her styling scissors. TV: Roddy Bottum scored the defunct ABC series Help Me Help You. Baby: Lynn Truell nee Perko is pregnant in her booklet photo. Which leaves Will Schwartz as the band, still harboring dreams that these veteran art-pop up-and-comers will someday be remunerative as well as catchy. Catchy they remain on their belated fourth album--also bright, dynamic, tender, brainy, unpretentious, and civilly pansexual. But after barely playing out in five years, are they a band on the strength of a written-from-memory title tune about touring's frantic rush? Or of \"Room With a View,\" about a rehearsal space where you can pretend you're \"twenty for life\"? Or of \"Fallen Idol,\" in which Schwartz complains or admits: \"Since I've gone solo/\"We've hit a new low\"? That low is pretty high. But nobody can pretend to be twenty forever. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nWhere Sonic Youth are at least sonic, these men and women are far from imperial. Just masterful. They sharpen their hooks and spin their lyrics not for art's sake, but for the artists' pleasure, and for the ears and minds of their discerning fans. The result are songs that illuminate a subcultural dilemma other bands ignore or wallow in: how it feels to stick with your music even when you are going on middle age is plenty full without it. \"Room With a View,\" with the \"20 for life\" line everybody quotes, lays out the terms. But the opener's \"Pump my heart until/Bleeding heart be still\" is just as apt. Can't last forever. But the proof it's lasted this long is in the hearing, and they're happy about it. A-\n\nJason Isbell: Sirens of the Ditch (2007, New West) The Drive-By Truckers were a full-formed entity in 2001, when young Jason Isbell's yearning tenor gave the eloquent Skynyrd fans an actual singer and show-stoppers like \"Outfit\" and \"Decoration Day\" gave them a third songwriter who could lead most bands. Only now we get to find out: in April, Isbell quit the Truckers while his bassist wife stayed put. On Isbell's solo debut, musicians from the Truckers' orbit trade garage barrage for pop-soul structure, and often the songs are right there: \"Grown,\" to the older girl who taught him how to take it slow; \"Shotgun Wedding,\" to a guy who digs pregnant chicks; \"Dress Blues,\" for a neighbor blown up in Iraq the last week of his tour; \"Try,\" about someone else's marriage gone to hell on the road. Problem's the usual--like so many solo debuts, this one cries out for dramatic context and musical changes of pace. Good luck to all concerned. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nLike so many major talents, more major in a group (\"Dress Blues,\" \"Try\"). *\n\nGeorge Jones & Merle Haggard: Kickin' Out the Footlights . . . Again (2006, Bandit) Because George Jones and Merle Haggard are our premier living country artists--male, anyway (hello Dolly)--their album of four duets and five solos apiece can't be ignored. Sometimes some synergy is just what an old dog needs, and having them sing each other's hits is a neat idea. But though the 75-year-old Jones will stand as one of the greatest singers in any genre, his vocal edge has blurred so noticeably in recent years that the wistful \"All My Friends Are Strangers\" isn't just his finest performance on this likable enough album, but in this millennium. So Haggard, who at 69 has been picking up his game of late, carries the team. On such solo shots as \"Things Have Gone to Pieces\" and \"I Always Get Lucky With You,\" the words have clearly passed through his brain before reaching his larynx--a larynx that if we're lucky will continue to resonate for another decade. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nHag keeps getting Haggier, but that thing in George's voice that was grainy like cornbread is turning to mush (\"Things Have Gone to Pieces,\" \"Footlights\"). *\n\nNorah Jones: Come Away With Me (2002, Blue Note) Peacemonger of the year, and I guess you could say we need one (\"Cold, Cold Heart,\" \"Don't Know Why\") [Rock&Roll&]\n\n\"Cold Cold Heart\"\n\nJ-Zone: A Job Ain't Nuthin but Work (2004, Fat Beats/Old Maid Entertainment) \"Zone gotta do what Zone know best/Tell a story talk trash make you laugh be crass\" (\"Disco Ho,\" \"Kill Pretty\") [unknown]\n\nRapper wants a tuna sandwich with all the fixings, hold the tuna, and can you supersize a tap water with that? (\"Disco Ho,\" \"Kill Pretty\"). *\n\nKeren Ann: Keren Ann (2007, Metro Blue) Keren Ann is a languorous Parisian chanteuse with a throaty soprano that promises untold pleasures for as long as she likes you. \"Lay Your Head Down\" even hints that she'll still like you tomorrow, with a nice tune to back it up. One thing, though, mon chou--over here, we say \"miss you like hell.\" \"As hell\" just doesn't sound right. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nMusic to pretend you're having sophisticated casual sex to, only remember -- you're not actually that sophisticated (\"Lay Your Head Down,\" \"It Ain't No Crime\"). *\n\nAlicia Keys: As I Am (2007, J) You have to admire Alicia Keys's commitment to her street-nice vision. In the year Ciara grew up, Rihanna left the islands, and Jill Scott explored the joy of sex, the twenty-six-year-old's third studio album envisions a hip-hop generation ready for its own Roberta Flack. Despite substantial input from Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers, the rapper boyfriend Keys says she made wait a year to get down, the prevailing mood is reflectively soulful and the prevailing tempo mid. The pair's collaborations peak with two power ballads anchored by heavy keyboard hooks: the watch-your-step \"Go Ahead\" and the unconditional \"No One.\" And while proven hitmakers Linda Perry and John Mayer add little, PlantLife's relatively obscure Jack Splash chips in on the album's two liveliest, loveliest tracks: \"Teenage Love Affair,\" in which a street-nice girl stops at \"third base,\" and \"Wreckless Love,\" which goes \"crazy\" without specifying a single body part. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nNice girl holds out (\"Teenage Love Affair,\" \"Wreckless Love\"). *\n\nChaka Khan: Funk This (2007, Burgundy) Chaka Khan has never bothered with great albums because she has such a great voice--juicy, airy, spunky, transported. Though she's fifty-four, it's also unfrayed, one reason this committed if never classic comeback makes its mark. Another is hot-no-more producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who add bite while discreetly leaving the songwriting to the likes of Hendrix, Prince, Sly Stone (\"Time endures), and, hmm, Ed Townsend (\"Foolish Fool\" does too). Respect as well to Mary J. Blige's patented New Yorkese. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nMeaning Jam & Lewis this, a decent interval after London Symphony Orchestra this and Prince this (\"Disrespectful,\" \"Foolish Fool\"). **\n\nDavid Kilgour: Frozen Orange (2004, Merge) On 1990's bright little Vehicle, or 2003's rising and falling Anthology, New Zealand's Clean are the Velvet Underground with no darkness in them, fashioning calm, smartly paced drones that intimate an infinity they sanely decline to deliver. But the Clean were/are a band, and a slight and marginal one to boot. On his sixth (sixth!) solo album, nominal leader David Kilgour assumes that you'll care about the biggest cog in the machine (and his sidemen). The still-simple music is nonetheless fussier and woozier; the words lean away from trancy chant toward sketchy fantasy and reminiscence. Those with a yen for quiet lyricism may well find it lovely in a suitably mild way. The rest of us will wonder why he bothered. [unknown: 2]\n\nMiranda Lambert: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (2007, Sony/BMG Nashville) Garth Brooks fan turned Nashville Star discovery Miranda Lambert stormed the country charts with the incendiary promises of \"Gasoline\" in 2005. Now she tops herself on what will likely remain the country album of the year. Just twenty-three, Lambert plays the rebel girl, revving up the mood of the Dixie Chicks' \"Goodbye Earl\" and Gretchen Wilson's \"Redneck Woman.\" On the lead track, she waits on an abusive boyfriend with her shotgun; on the title track, she leaves her pistol in the car and wades into the bar bare-handed. Lambert does have a thoughtful side. But the violent moments define a little lady who also cites the Rolling Stones' \"Under My Thumb\" and rocks a Patty Griffin cover. Smoking. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nGood thing she sets off four firecrackers--pulls a gun on her big-fisted ex-boyfriend, belts two hard-headed sermons on small-town life, rips up the title tune--before wasting precious tracks proving she can also do mature. But she can--shortly after \"Love Letters\" waltzes with Nashville nostalgia, \"More Like Her\" sidles up to the complexity one values in mature types. Whereupon, the clinchers: the mature firecrackers \"Down\" and \"Guilty in Here.\" Followed, for the alt-country contingent, by a Patty Griffin cover she ignites and a Carlene Carter cover she doesn't. A\n\nMac Lethal: 11:11 (2007, Rhymesayers Entertainment) Sounds as American as canned peaches and has about as much wigger in him as Peter Bjorn and John (\"Lithium Lips,\" \"Jihad!\") [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nFrom Kansas City, Kan. (it makes a difference), a white rapper-by-default whose sarcastic rhymes hook sharper than his hooky beats (\"Lithium Lips,\" \"Jihad!\"). **\n\nBiz Markie: Weekend Warrior (2003, Tommy Boy) Veteran rapper Biz Markie commands a delivery so distinctive--\"flow\" nothing, its good-humored charm is all spittle and grunt--that he can cameo on other people's records for as long he breathes. Biz's own albums, however, were never unexceptionable. His first since the best and most obscure of them, 1993's All Samples Cleared, begins with the unlikely claim that he's \"the funkiest brother on the earth\" and damn near proves it with the help of a Curtis Mayfield beat. And though nothing equally down ensues, it's refreshing to hear a professional who's as proven as LL Cool J tend to bizness: \"Not number one but here to have fun/Guaranteed to proceed and get the job done.\" [unknown (Blender): 3]\n\n\"Tear Shit Up\"\n\nMaroon 5: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007, A&M/Octone) Justin Timberlake is subtler, and will remain the hipster's popster--there's nothing as rhythmically profound as \"My Love\" here. But there's more meaty-beaty dynamite. The debut was a breakup album, brightly surfaced but sour underneath. This one's the diary of a top dog--a multiplatinum idol with a soulful falsetto who's dated Jessica, Lindsay, Kirsten, you name her. Now Adam Levine says he wants to have kids, but he also says the \"Give me something to believe in\" bit in the rather nasty Jam & Lewis-styled kissoff \"Makes Me Wonder\" has a political subtext. Figure that voicing such feelings helps his dogging, and hope he doesn't mean it. Levine is too good at catchy come-ons, catchy pleas, and catchy farewells to waste his sacred essence on social homilies others can do better. Instead of deep, he should work on nice, as in the good-guy kissoffs \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" and \"Better That We Break\" or the memorable \"Won't Go Home Without You,\" which combines confidence with affection rather than macho. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nLearning what Prince has always known--that kindnesses render a falsetto manly and kiss-offs don't (\"Nothing Lasts Forever,\" \"Won't Go Home Without You\"). **\n\nCurtis Mayfield and the Impressions: The Anthology 1961-1977 (1992, MCA) The stellar harmony group where Mayfield took his long vocal run-up to his maturity as a groove artist provides 30 of the 40 tracks here. A few you've never heard are generic postdoowop r&b, Chicago-style. Others you've never heard vividly demonstrate why Mayfield is mentioned in the same breath as Smokey Robinson. [Rolling Stone: 4.5]\n\nThe phat drumming and bar-band soul of Shanachie's People Get Ready tribute do Mayfield's delicacy a disservice. There's no gutbucket or hogmaw or Mississippi mud in his groove--unmooring gospel verities or floating off into space-case funk, he's so far out there that Johnny Pate's elaborate, light-bottomed orchestrations never trip him up. I'd curtail the juvenilia to salvage more of his radically sporadic solo career, but a songwriter this gifted has no trouble filling two CDs, and he's his own aptest vocal interpreter. Great unknown guitarist, too. A+\n\nPaul McCartney: Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard (2005, Capitol) Paul McCartney's collaboration with Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich aroused hopes and fears better expended on the fate of social security, or maybe Pamela Anderson's love life. McCartney's first studio album since 2001--not so long in an artist of his accrued wealth and advanced years--most resembles his eponymous 1970 debut. Like that breakaway, it's slight and spare and fundamentally honest, with McCartney playing most of the instruments. But between his improved chops, the latest synthesizer technology, and Godrich whispering in his ear, it's rather straight where the debut was eccentric and charming. As the proudly \"twee\" \"English Tea\" makes brutally clear, charm doesn't come so easily to McCartney anymore. And though it's good of him to put in a word for kindness and creativity, wisdom doesn't seem to have taken charm's place. [unknown (Blender): 2]\n\nPaul McCartney: Memory Almost Full (2007, Hear Music) \"Dance Tonight\" is so simplistic it could make you shudder, but repeated plays soon implant its strummed hook, and the rest of the album establishes that the party it sets up is a set-up--a bit of Eden before a fall that comes immediately with the peppy but regretful \"Ever Present Past,\" about all the time a sixty-four-year old has already wasted on work instead of love. \"Gratitude\" is an astonishingly unrecriminating romantic fare-thee-well from a guy going through a bitter divorce. \"Vintage Clothes\" and \"Feet in the Clouds\" incarnate his nostalgia and whimsy with some wit and considerable musical invention. And the final tracks make clear that boyish Paulie conceived this record as the old man he is. \"The End of the End\" lays out funeral instructions that include jokes, songs, \"stories of old,\" and assurances of an afterlife not all his contemporaries believe will transpire. And \"Nod Your Head\" appears to advise aging lovers on their beds of pain. Not simplistic at all. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\n\"I hope it's not too late/Searching for time that has gone so fast\" (\"Ever Present Past,\" \"Nod Your Head\"). ***\n\nNellie McKay: Ordinary Villagers (2007, Hungry Mouse) Not long ago she vacated her Columbia deal so she could release Pretty Little Head at sixty-five minutes instead of forty-eight. But on this follow-up, she zigs where she once zagged--the nine songs last barely half an hour, and they're better for it. Track for track, it's no stronger. But things are over so fast that it's carried by its two or three standouts, innumerable charming moments, and kooky mood. Announced with an insouciantly sarcastic \"Feminists don't have a sense of humor,\" the piano-bar \"Mother of Pearl\" serves as an overture to the Broadway orchestrations six horns provide thereafter. The clever lyrics seldom fully parse, not even on the paranoia panorama \"Identity Theft\" or the enticing fantasia that begins \"Saturday night in the men's ensemble dressing room.\" They just flesh out a surreal musical you'll never see because McKay has already moved on to who knows what other projects--but would catch if she ever buckled down and finished it. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nIn an antirockist moment when faerie folkies airier than Joanna Newsom and disco dollies emptier than Rihanna are thought to promise a braver, freer future, why isn't this manifestly hypertalented young person a generational hero? Couldn't have any connection, could it, to the fact that no fewer than three netcrits--all, as it happens, men--don't understand that the opening laugh line, \"Feminists don't have a sense of humor,\" is the well-turned piece of satire that makes everyone I play it for giggle? I agree--she's scattered, unfinished, self-indulgent. But she's also ebullient, funny and political. Her future looks brave and free to me. A-\n\nChristine McVie: In the Meantime (2003, Koch) Born in 1943, Christine McVie cut her third solo album as a 60th birthday present to herself--at that age, you can't get enough of them. And right, she's not dead yet. The singing is as solid as ever, the tunes are solid for the first half, and beats from Average White Band drummer Steve Ferrone generate enough of that streamlined Fleetwood Mac drive. Nevertheless, there are severe limitations to the romantic insights of a self-absorbed senior who's still working on her feelings. Her heart beats like a drum, her first cut is the deepest, and not only that: \"If we can't be lovers then we really can't be friends.\" That \"really\" is a deft touch, don't you think? She may not know much, but at least she's learned scansion. [unknown (Blender): 2]\n\nMeat Puppets: Rise to Your Knees (2007, Anodyne) Once upon a time in the eighties, the Meat Puppets made more tuneful post-hardcore albums than three stoned Arizonans had any right to. But though this comeback celebrates the parole of (ex-) junkie bassist Cris Kirkwood, tuneful it ain't. Best track by far: trancey death-cowpunk finale. Whoopee. [Rolling Stone: 1.5]\n\n\"Light the Fire\"\n\nStephin Merritt: Pieces of April (2003, Nonesuch) In 1999, Stephin Merritt masterminded the last great monument of 20th-century pop, the Magnetic Fields' three-CD 69 Love Songs. This brief, budget-priced, 10-song soundtrack cum artist sampler is never better than on two of those 69, \"I Think I Need a New Heart\" and \"The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side,\" though the 6ths' \"You You You You You\" comes close. The five new songs here all feature Merritt's meaningfully inexpressive monotone, shrewdly minimal arrangements, and flatly clever lyrics. But only \"Dreams Anymore,\" about a disillusioned beloved living in a nowhere town, achieves the epiphany-in-spite-of-itself that propels a good 50 of the aforementioned 69 beyond the devotion to craft often seems his only reason for creating. [Blender: 2]\n\n\"Dreams Anymore\"\n\nM.I.A.: Kala (2007, Interscope) The debut Arular was about M.I.A.--her ambition, her education, her contradictions, her history of violence. Kala is about Euro-America's brown-skinned Other--described from the outside, although often in the first person, by a brown-skinned sympathizer who despite her star power is an insider only as long as her visa holds up. It opens with the spare \"Bamboo Banga,\" which samples Indian Tamil filmi composer Ilayaraja and sets Richman's roadrunner knocking on your Hummer's door in India, Ghana, Burma, Angola, Somalia, Sri Lanka. \"Birdflu\" disses dogging males everywhere--\"selfish little roamers\"--over another filmi sample and a barely synchronized four-four on some thirty deep-toned urmi drums. High kiddie/girlie interjections add a cuteness that's sustained pitch-wise on \"Boyz.\" Only with \"Jimmy,\" a Bollywood disco number a kiddie Maya used to dance to for money at Sri Lankan parties, does a conventional song surface. Throughout, Kala is less pop-friendly than its predecessor--it's heavier, noisier, more jagged. But the music does soften and, occasionally, give up a tune. There's melancholy melodica, Sri Lankan temple horn, seventeen-year-old Afrikan Boy describing his hustles, and several child choruses, notably on \"Mango Pickle Down River,\" where subteens rhyme about bridges and fridges to rhyme with the didge--didgeridoo--that provides their groaning bass. A riot of human, musical, and mechanical sounds bubbles underneath these tracks. Not a white riot, that's for sure, and not a dangerous one either--unless you believe every Other wants what you got and has nothing to offer in return. Kala proves what bullshit that is. The danger is all the evil fools who aren't convinced. [Rolling Stone: 4.5]\n\nLess catchy and novel than 2005's Arular, this just gets stronger and more intelligent over time--compared to Arular, and also to Arcade Fire's Neon Bible or Radiohead's In Rainbows or, I don't know, Jay-Z's American Gangster. Where so many bands who consider tunes beneath them compensate with piddling portions of texture or structure, this record is full of things to listen to: zooms and scrapes and grunts and whistles and kiddie voices and animal cries, weird Asian drums and horns, down-home melodica and didgeridoo. Also, of course, bass bass bass--guitar, drum, whatever. The songs imagine and recreate an unbowed international underclass that proves how smart it is just by stating its business, which includes taking your money. The lyrics far cannier politically than those on Arular. But their proof is in the music. A+\n\nJoni Mitchell: Shine (2007, Hear Music) Joni Mitchell is the kind of aging egoist who gives ecology a bad name. On her first album in five years and first for Starbucks--a connection some anti-corporatists will foolishly disparage--she rails against environmental ills with the privileged pique of someone who considers the world's failure to resemble the one she grew up in a cosmic affront. Skillfully marshalling the jazzy growl and desultory melodies she's cultivated for decades, she observes that \"there's just too many people now,\" compares our orld unfavorably to the Garden of Eden, and heaps cellphones with her gorgeous wrath. Given Mitchell's talent and prestige, it's a waste of precious resources that she couldn't have emulated the kind-hearted heroine of \"Hana\" when reminding the caffeinated consumer that nature is gravely out of whack. Instead, her most nuanced new lyric details an apostate tour-bus driver's descent into a luscious sin she probably knows better than she lets on. The runner-up is the title tune, where she grants the sun leave to bless all sinners--even cellphone users! Text her your thanks. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nNils Petter Molvaer: ER (2006, Thirsty Ear) With his mellow tone, flair for funk, and wide-open sonic pallette, Norwegian trumpeter Molvaer is made for his new American label's dubby, jazz-meets-electronica, remix-a-lot aesthetic. The quietest and most effects-laden of his three 2006 albums may still seem too weird to those who equate calm with brain death, but it's ideal for listeners who prefer their background music to give up some content when they focus in. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nOn the spookiest of Thirsty Ear's three Molvaer albums, Molvaer's Miles-sans-mute sound--smooth the way strawberry sherbet is smooth--floats through buzzes and washes, squiggles and treated voices, bodied up by bass parts often his own. Not that he's a loner--most tracks feature four to six samplers, programmers, drummers and such. Here's hoping the woman who sings (and wrote) \"Only These Things Count\" is another respected fellow professional, rather than his girlfriend. Miles reserved his girlfriends for cover shots. A-\n\nNils Petter Molvaer: An American Compilation (2006, Thirsty Ear) Jazz standard-bearers hate 1970s Miles. It's shapeless, noisy, electric. It's Rock. It Doesn't Swing. Yet for trumpeters like Tim Hagans and Graham Haynes, 1970s Miles was a starting point. And no one has taken that music further than the Norwegian trumpeter Nils Petter Molvaer. Leading with the spooky 2001 title tune of ECM's gauntlet-flaunting Solid Ether, this is his new and highly suitable American label's attempted upgrade on 2002's beatwise NP3. With visions of profitability dancing in its head, it oversells both his funk and his melodicism. But that's not to say you can't chill to it--even have a little fun doing it. [unknown]\n\nMolvaer is a Norwegian trumpeter formerly on ECM who during the past decade has proven himself a sonic hipster as unflappable as Miles Davis himself. Peter Gordon's electronica-friendly nu-jazz label, Thirsty Ear, introduces its new prize to his natural audience by bearing down on Molvaer's Europe-only 2002 NP3 and front-loading the title tune of ECM's 2001 release Solid Ether. This overplays Molvaer's interest in power funk and pretty solos, but what the hell--he's always shifting tactics anyway, and there's still atmospheric ambience aplenty. A-\n\nNils Petter Molvaer: Streamer (2006, Thirsty Ear) With the best flow and the second-best funk of the three CDs Molvaer released in 2006, this live album suggests that Molvaer's shows must be exceptionally meditative--it's the quietest of the three. Yet at the same time it's the weirdest, fueled by extra vocal samples--lyrical yet eerie, noisy yet grooveful, calming yet surprising. Sometimes it's even straight-ahead, almost. But it always changes again. [unknown]\n\nRecorded at a Jan. 1, 2002, Finnish concert where some audience members surely dozed briefly unless the heat was on the fritz, this is pretty lulling for a live album--assuming the ground of your being isn't threatened by guitar blats, jungle beats and noises that poke out of the flow like tree branches and old car parts. It includes five compositions that had just then surfaced on NP3, only here they're gauzier. Due to the spoken-word snatches the trumpeter strews on top, they're also eerier. But not, I promise, scarier. A-\n\nMe'shell Ndeg√©ocello: The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams (2007, EmArcy) Though her deep voice is mixed down a little, most of Meshell Ndegeocello's seventh album--five of its tracks reprised from 2006's Article 3 EP--recalls 2002's Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape. Call it Sade unlite: jazzy atmospherics meant to evoke spiritual fundamantals rather than zoned-out surfaces. But toward the end, this changes. The last five tracks include abrasive funk, animist gospel, child-rearing reggae, and the prayerful near-metal closer \"Relief: A Stripper's Classic.\" [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\n\"Article 3\"\n\nYoussou N'Dour: Rokku Mi Rakka (Give and Take) (2007, Nonesuch) At 48, the Senegalese singer-bandleader Youssou N'Dour has been the world's the most consistent record maker all decade. His fourth album for Nonesuch isn't stone genius like 2002's chanson-inflected Nothing's in Vain or 2004's Sufi-themed Egypt. But N'Dour is no longer ever swamped by his own internationalism, and here his strategy of moving a few favorite musicians north to Mali changes up the Senegalese mbalax he invented without surrendering its Sahel gestalt. Translations from the Wolof reveal lyrics about Senegalese independence, Sufi saints, the value of traveling, remembering, thinking. They're worth following, as are the phonetic transliterations. But with N'Dour, the prime attraction is always musical, radiating out from a voice whose sky-like clarity and beseeching high end would catch you short in a singer half his age, but always including striking multi-part melodies and skilled guitar-bass-drums-drums-drums. Ali Farka Toure sideman Bassekou Kouyate banjo-fies five tracks on four-stringed ngoni. And if you're good, Neneh Cherry will treat you to a duet on an English-language closer that's worth the wait. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nUnlike the two previous Nonesuch albums by Africa's premier pop star--the 2002 ecumenical, the 2005 Muslim--this isn't designed to inspire conversion experiences. But believe that its melodicism and vocal dexterity exceed those of whatever contemporary standard-bearer you favor in those realms, that the clarity and range of the singing epitomize what is usually meant by beauty, and that at 48 this Sufihas got him some beats. Having long realized that crossover was most gracefully accomplished by conceptual clarity, he keeps things organized this time out by tending to business at home. On half the tracks a banjo-like ngoni, which this being Senegal N'dour designates a xalam, gestures toward the Malian desert directly to his north, imparting a capering intricacy and folkish flavor to what remains Dakar dance music. To most Americans, however, it will probably just sound like Africa, and pretty darn good. A\n\nWillie Nelson: Songbird (2006, Lost Highway) With the still supple Willie Nelson down to a modest album-a-year pace at 73, for the Ryan Adams-produced Songbird to follow so close upon February's Cindy Walker-linked You Don't Know Me suggests that the old man just wanted to put this record behind him. Adams loves his band very much, and Nelson is an affable fellow. But the Cardinals' indistinct country-rock hybrid muffles the material. Compare the opener, \"Rainy Day Blues,\" to 2000's sharp, showy Jonny Lang-aided remake; check how much clearer the indomitable \"We Don't Run\" came through on Spirit in 1996. Nelson is almost always worth hearing. Be grateful he put his stamp on Gram Parsons's \"$1000 Wedding\" and Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah.\" But Christine McVie's title tune doesn't fly, Nelson's new \"Back to Earth\" didn't start all that far up, and Adams's previously unrecorded contribution is one of way too many. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nNow he knows -- if he wants somebody who can't stop writing songs, better Harlan Howard than Ryan Adams (\"Hallelujah,\" \"$1000 Wedding\"). *\n\nWillie Nelson/Merle Haggard/Ray Price: Last of the Breed Vol 1 & 2 (2007, Lost Highway) All now in their seventies, these geezers could have croaked their way amiably through their two discs of country chestnuts, or, worse, faked a puissance that was no longer theirs. Instead they sing like old men singing old men's songs. It helps that Nelson and Haggard show so little wear that they'll never inspire their deathwatch cults if they don't get with the program, and that Ray has been forced by time to replace his countrypolitan echo box with something more intimate and savvy. But somebody thought hard about the picks here, and even on the forlorn love songs we pray are strictly fictional by now, all three are feeling every word. Two pairings take on special resonance: \"Why Me Lord\" and \"Sweet Jesus\" as they prepare to meet their maker, and \"Mom and Dad's Waltz\" and \"That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine,\" written for parents who were younger than they are now. It sounds like they're singing to themselves, yeah. But it also sounds as if decades later they still miss their mamas and daddies. [unknown (Rolling Stone): 3.5]\n\nThere's only so much three prolific old coots can do with a double-CD of country standards, and they do most of it. Intimate with the literature, they pick winners you've never heard, and they're putting out, always a consideration with the prolific. Yet though the broad-beamed Price obviously needs two of the deftest singers left on the planet, it's his ruined echo chamber of a voice that injects a defining solemnity into the two religious songs, and everything else derives from that. Not much kidding around here--they're feeling their varying ages. But they ain't dead yet. A-\n\nBrad Paisley: 5th Gear (2007, Arista Nashville) Smart, low-profile Nashvillean Brad Paisley's fifth album features not one but two songs about how adulthood beats adolescnce--four if the two car songs count. Think he's worried something might be gaining on him? The broad, small-minded attack on a MySpace nerd proves it. Most of the adulthood songs are aces anyway, however. And then there's the priceless title chorus where he offers to check his new ladyfriend for \"Ticks.\" [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nGetting set in his ways -- \"Online,\" ugh -- but still smarter than the Nashville norm (\"Ticks,\" \"Letter to Me\"). **\n\nRobert Plant/Alison Krauss: Raising Sand (2007, Rounder) Robert Plant's Fender baritone has symbolized rock excess for almost four decades; Alison Krauss's virtuoso fiddle and mountain soprano have symbolized country purity for two. Post-Zep, however, the leonine Plant has put his star power behind roots musics from the Delta to the Sahara, while the demure Krauss has proven a fearsome workaholic, her vaunted modesty vying with her professional drive. So though Krauss brings folk cred to these new weird duets, ascribe considerable smarts and soul to Plant--and to producer T-Bone Burnett, who assembled the atmospheric band and plucked most of the half-remembered material from the ether. Lend your ears to Li'l Millet's \"Rich Woman,\" to Roly Salley's \"Killing the Blues,\" to the two Everly Brothers obscurities that cancel out the two Gene Clark obscurities. Skilled and inspired though it is, Raising Sand's relaxed, smokey harmonies and reverbed midtempo rockabilly don't always achieve the back-porch revelation they're going for. But they do both icons a world of good. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nFolk-leaning guy and pop-leaning gal sip iced tea on the veranda of their platinum-plated studio (\"Killing the Blues,\" \"Please Read the Letter\"). ***\n\nThe Ponys: Turn the Lights Out (2007, Matador) The Ponys' excellent garagey-punky releases of 2004 and 2005 were proof of a form, not evidence of a mission. Delights in themselves, they promised nothing, not even that the next album would be any good. Perhaps due to the replacement of touring-averse keyboardist-guitarist Ian Adams by Chicago stalwart Brian Case, perhaps due to ye olde maturity, their move from lesser indie In the Red to greater indie Matador takes an echoed-up tack that's more Sonic Youth than Voidoids. But as the Ponys crash and boom and reverberate, never think they resemble either of these bands who promise plenty. Instead, their forebears are more along the lines of faux-arena formalists like Dinosaur Jr. and Spiritualized. This is the Ponys' next album, and let no one say it isn't any good--or much of anything else. As for the lyrics, there are some. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nEcho for echo's sake (\"Everyday Weapon,\" \"Maybe I'll Try\"). **\n\nPublic Enemy: How You Sell Soul to a Soulless People Who Sold Their Soul??? (2007, Slamjamz) \"I've been a spokesperson for a generation,\" Chuck D notes on \"Long and Whining Road,\" a proud fact whose modest past tense suggests why these commercial has-beens still make terrific albums. Chuck has nothing to prove and plenty to say. Flavor Flav is the funniest rapper ever to bamboozle VH-1. And their young \"baNNed\" slams their conscious points down. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nNot only are their albums still good, they're getting better. Beats keep changing, too. Most of these are by the kind of heavy guitar-bass-drums unit Chuck D has coveted since Anthrax-the-band was bigger than anthrax-the-disease, and intermittently there are also uncredited horns, keyb effects, scratching and backup singers, like the child chorus who recites the message of \"Sex, Drugs and Violence\": \"We like those gangsta rhymes/Just make sure they don't corrupt our minds/These rappers kill and thieve/A lot of times it's only make believe.\" Flav remains a knave on TV and the king's fool in PE. And though the title's moral braggadocio has been one of Chuck's more pigheaded tropes since he was dissing soaps, the Don Imus flap has imparted to him an aura of contemporaneity that comes none too soon. A-\n\nRilo Kiley: Under the Blacklight (2007, Warner Bros.) Because Rilo Kiley's More Adventurous was a triumph of the well-made narrative song, its markedly terser and beatier follow-up, which is also the band's true major-label debut, will be accused of sellout. Instead, it's yet more adventurous, a prosperous band's challenge to its comfortable cult. Always too cute for serious indie cred, Jenny Lewis slips four songs about dangerous sex in which she herself might be indulging--right now, in her pretty prosperity--into music that's defined rather than just decorated by its stylistic flirtations. Repetitive if not wordless refrains pop up everywhere, one in Spanish with a Latin beat; here there's a soul horn section, there a Fleetwood Mac homage, there a synth outro, and almost nowhere much guitar-band alt-rock. The emotions aren't as detailed as in the past. But they're no less intense. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nTerse and beaty, with Dr. Dre referral Mike Elizondo going half on the baby, this isn't a pop record, but it does avoid guitar-band shapes, sonics and truisms. Blake Sennett's pretty Fleetwood Mac homage proves densely political, and though Jenny Lewis isn't writing fluff, she might consider some porn in the right venue for the right advance. Makes you wonder just what teenager was \"down for almost anything,\" what adult is getting \"money for sex.\" Leaves little doubt that it's Jenny's tail you can chase and tongue you can taste in the Spanish one, Jenny who removes her bra and smokes in bed in the sexy(est) one. The tender title tune casts her as a \"black widow,\" and the tender-sounding opener is a breakup song as triumphant as \"Breakin' Up\" itself. \"Ooh, it feels good to be free,\" she exults, with girl backup. It's possible she means it. A\n\nJill Scott: The Real Thing (2007, Hidden Beach) Jill Scott took two-and-a-half years to follow 2004's Beautifully Human with January's Collaborations. Eight months later, the true sequel suggests that all those duets weren't just to help her writing. Scott's new album traces the arc of a relationship whose dissolution slows her down midway through--until track thirteen. There a new fella shows up to cure her \"Celibacy Blues,\" touching off the whispered, honeyed \"All I,\" a lesson for any horndog naive enough to believe that toned babes make better sex kittens. As with so many new r&b heroes, Scott's music is more about groove and mood than song. But more than Maxwell or D'Angelo, she cares about words, and no matter how poetically she muses, tracks like the turf-claiming \"The Real Thing,\" the erotic \"Crown Royal,\" the distressed \"Insomnia,\" and the inspired \"Breathe\" always situate her in space and time. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nThe Aretha analogy here is her weight. The front cover has her looking dusky and curvacious, spring coat over medium decolletage; on the back she's sitting on the floor all pensive with an open composition book covering her bosom. In neither does she fake skinny, and that is as it should be. At the very least, \"real thing\" means something for once. Through almost as many producers as Mary, this album has a single identity, a contour and a groove that suits its well-inhabited breakup concept. There's plenty of sex before and after, and the sex has content. I don't mean emotional content, either, though I have faith the emotion is there. In her timbre, her phrasing and the words she writes in that composition book, Scott is someone for whom sex is about physical pleasure--not athletic ability, boundary transgression, novelty or dominance and submission. A-\n\nBlake Shelton: Pure BS (2007, Warner Bros.) Close personal friend of Miranda Lambert and trouble-making new traditionalist Shelton cut this album mid-divorce, which is how he explains the thoughtful tone of songs that play on received language like \"She Don't Love Me\" (worse, she doesn't hate me either), \"What I Wouldn't Give\" (to make up for what I wouldn't give), and \"I Don't Care\" (actually, I do). The finale ponders suburban developers displacing farmland and honky tonks. \"The Last Country Song,\" it's called. You can bet it isn't. [Rolling Stone: 3]\n\nCommitted to clich√© rehab with all his country soul (\"The More I Drink,\" \"I Don't Care\"). *\n\nTartit: Abacabok (2006, Crammed Discs) The best African record of 2006 came from even further north than the late Ali Farka Toure's gratefully reviewed Savane. A male-led, woman-dominated group of Saharan Tuaregs, Tartit were conceived by Belgian record men and sound more Arab than African, though they really just sound Tuareg. In the wake of the more masculine Sarahan band Tinariwen, their second album hops up the 2000 debut's drones and chants with faster tempos and the occasional Western rhythm instrument. Eerie proof if you need it that Islamic music, like Islam itself, comes in many forms. [Rolling Stone]\n\nThese mostly female Tuareg exiles convened in Belgium in the '90s to brave the world music circuit, with who left Africa when and who went back fuzzy. For all their tinde drums, the folkloric chants of 2000's \"Ichichila\" seemed static and bare. But since then, the Mali explosion has brought with it Festival in the Desert and its children, and the forward drive here is definitely cognizant of the better-known Tuaregs of Tinariwen. Tartit play faster and ululate more as their self-sufficient gravity accommodates a Westward-looking groove. Afel Bocoum and friends carry one track, less familiar names three others, with Tuareg bassist Nasser a standout. If their veiled faces make you feel guilty, be that way. I take my Islamic connections wherever I can find them. A-\n\nTegan and Sara: The Con (2007, Vapor) As lesbians who never reference their oppression or even their sexuality, Tegan and Sara don't have men to lash out at, put up with, or gripe about. This may be why their uncommonly detailed love songs are so short on drama--a riddle worth pondering because their keyboard-heavy, new wavish music is also uncommonly catchy. When Sara changes up a chorus with a melodically climactic \"But I promise this, I won't go my whole life, telling you I don't need,\" or Tegan caps a verse with a hook that goes \"All I need to hear is that you're not mine,\" your musical impulse is to empathize if not identify. But the objects of their romantic ambivalence remain distant--the focus is the singer's feelings, examined rather than indulged. Tune-seekers will admire many of these songs--\"The Con,\" \"Nineteen,\" \"Back in Your Head,\" \"Like O, Like H.\" But that doesn't mean they'll fully connect with them. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nNegotiating different power relations than heterosexual women, they have trouble getting out of themselves (\"Back in Your Head,\" \"Hop a Plane\"). **\n\nLinda Thompson: Versatile Heart (2007, Rounder) Richard and Linda Thompson's bitter 1982 breakup had dire musical consequences. Solo, the bravura guitarist never matched the grace or depth of his duo work, and even worse, \"hysterical dysphonia\" prevented Linda from singing for years on end. The few records she did manage, even 2002's purported comeback Fashionably Late, settled for bland folk-rock lyricism. Here she's finally acrid again--helped by Steven Bernstein's horn arrangement on the memorable title tune, Rufus Wainwright's jaundiced eye on the specially composed \"Beauty,\" proto-feminist wisdom on the traditional \"Katy Cruel.\" Thompson puts more oomph into the sardonic resignation of \"Give Me a Sad Song,\" co-written by her old pal Betsy Cook, than the sarcastic resilience of \"Do Your Best for Rock 'n Roll,\" co-written like most of this material by Linda and Richard's talented son Teddy. But she was always a slow-one specialist, and it's a relief to hear she's no longer quite so calm about it. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nWiser than her ex, nicer, subtler--but, admittedly, less dynamic (\"Beauty,\" \"Give Me a Sad Song\"). ***\n\nRichard Thompson: Sweet Warrior (2007, Shout! Factory) Richard Thompson never shuts up for long, but his first electric album in four years is his toughest since a lot further back than that. The simple explanation is that he's good and riled about the war on what is after all his religion, as in the graphic and contemptuous Baghdad song \"Dad's Gonna Kill Me.\" It's good to hear his scythe-like ax and forthright baritone attacking political evil for once. As ever, though, it's regular evil, the colorful sins of a few bad men and many bad women, that generally gets him going. The wham-bam leadoff \"Needle and Thread\" has him mending his soul after assorted hussies tear it apart; the mournful \"Guns Are the Tongues\" puts a young loser to work for a vengeful female gang leader whose real-life precedent goes unfootnoted. This stuff would seem even shtickier if Thompson wasn't so good at moral dudgeon--and at playing guitar. But whether due to fed-up outrage or a new label, its engagement level is a genuine up. [unknown (Rolling Stone): 3]\n\nFolk-rockin' Sufi hates GWB even more than he hates that lady gangster (no, not Condi, nothing that realistic) (\"Dad's Gonna Kill Me,\" \"Johnny's Far Away\"). **\n\n3 Tenors of Soul: All the Way From Philadelphia (2007, Shanachie) Comprising the Philadelphia-spawned lead singers of the three foremost falsetto groups of late soul--the Stylistics' Russell Thompkins Jr., Blue Magic's Ted Mills, and the Delfonics' William Hart--the 3 Tenors of Soul are more than a cheeky gimmick. Conceived and produced by Bobby Eli, a guitarist in the definitive Philly-sound studio band MFSB, they're an oldies act with a brain, like Mavis Staples doing freedom songs. Rather than dipping back into their unduplicatable catalogues, Eli picked them chestnuts by such coequals as the Spinners, the Bee Gees, Earth, Wind & Fire, and the Average White Band. Although the voices have diminished slightly with age, nothing seems forced or flat. Standouts include Isley-Jasper-Isley's scene-setting \"Caravan of Love,\" Hall & Oates's specially composed title saga, and, in a finale that wouldn't be so perfect if it wasn't so corny, the Dionne Warwick-Elton John-Gladys Knight-Stevie Wonder AIDS-benefit smash \"That's What Friends Are For.\" [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nThe rare repertoire album with a future, because there's no stink of the canon about it. Russell Thompkins Jr. and Ted Mills are remembered as oddballs if at all--although you, gentle reader, of course recognize them as the falsetto leads of the Stylistics and Blue Magic. But together, their nearly intact voices--Thompkins' buttery, Mills' supple -- actualize an out-of-this-world tenderness that's a promise, not an escape, with Delfonic William Hart designated as third wheel. Curated by MFSB guitarist Bobby Eli, the songs are equally pristine -- certified hits by Isley-Jasper-Isley and the Brothers Gibb, AWB and EWF, Dionne Warwick and Hall & Oates, but the average rock history buff will be lucky to recognize them, never mind following through with IDs. Granted, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could ruin this yet. And I say, let it try. A-\n\nThunderbirds Are Now!: Make History (2006, Frenchkiss) In sweet home Detroit Thunderbirds Are Now! aren't garage enough, in outer Alternia not arty enough. Les Savy Fav fans think they're a ripoff. But there's a reason it's dollars to bottlecaps you've never heard Les Savy Fav, and that reason is--sigh, moan, clich√©--tunes. Figure keyboard man Scott Allen provides those, with his guitarist brother Ryan pitching in when he's not riffing angularly or yelping anxiously, generally about something social if not political. Perfect for anyone who believes complex song structures are best served by pop amenities and punk attitude. [unknown]\n\nFrom Detroit, a brother team over a rhythm section that's growing muscles, and though Scott Allen's keyboards provide the abundant hooks, Ryan Allen defines the sound. His voice high and desperate, his guitar jagged, Ryan has trust issues, but they're social--there's not a single relationship song on what is formally a high-anxiety pop record. \"The things that people say/The way that people talk/Make me want to take the words right out of their mouths,\" he yelps, then ventures: \"This is why we war.\" Maybe not--not exclusively, anyway. But it's exciting that he cares. A-\n\nTom Waits: Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers, and Bastards (2006, Anti-) When Tom Waits claims he doesn't know why he called this three-CD set Orphans, he's being cagey. It obviously began as an outtakes collection--unreleased worktapes plus old soundtrack, tribute, and benefit tracks. Only then Waits, painfully aware that odds-and-sods projects were lame, decided to fill in some blanks with new songs, couldn't resist re-recording others, and ended up with a definitive album. Each disc has its own subtitle: \"Brawlers\" for rock, \"Bawlers\" for ballads, and \"Bastards\" for weirdness. Although the promo advertises \"56 Songs. 30 New Recordings,\" only 14 can be readily found on other albums. Not every one is perfect, but more than usual are potential classics, including the mandolin-tinged \"Bottom of the World,\" the unrhymed, unblinking, seven-minute portrayal of a Palestinian terrorist \"Road to Peace,\" the thumping \"Low Down,\" the bent mambo \"Fish in the Jailhouse,\" bumptious claims on \"Young at Heart\" and \"Goodnight Irene,\" and several of the shaggy-dog monologues Waits rolls out at shows: a grisly entomology lecture, a dad reminiscing about his cars, and \"First Kiss,\" which were it true would tell us a great deal about how Tom became Tom. [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nHaving creamed for these 56 songs old, new and nobody's talking, I returned with trepidation. Sure enough, the first time through, too many had faded on me. Soon, however, even ones I'd given up on were bum-rushing my earhole, like \"Lucinda,\" with its steel-driving beat and gallows gloom. One reason, close attention to 1988's \"Sea of Love\" suggests, is that his groan has grown more distinct. And though it would be mere rhetoric to claim the six spoken-word pieces on Disc 3 are really music--they're yarns, jokes, theater, that's the point--they do really sound good. I said sound. A\n\nJunior Wells: Live at Theresa's 1975 (2006, Delmark) In 1966, Chicago club regular Junior Wells, renowned for his soul-tinged spit-singing and his Little-Walter-meets-Sonny-Boy harp, released one of blues's great albums-as-albums: Hoodoo Man Blues. Unfortunately for his place in history, he cut it with a guitarist-vocalist named Buddy Guy whose star soon outshone his own, and who later took top billing on two excellent live Wells albums. Nine years after Wells's death, then, here's the man in charge at his favorite South Side haunt, with Buddy's brother Phil on guitar. Meshing into a loose yet intricate groove on the opening \"Little by Little,\" confidently slurring Slim Harpo's \"Scratch My Back,\" singing \"Happy Birthday\" to a photographer, topping things off with Hoodoo Man's signature \"Messin' With the Kid,\" Wells is the king of a tiny realm that held forty customers. That time is gone. Here's a hint of how it felt. [Rolling Stone: 3.5]\n\nIncluding a \"Snatch It Back and Hold It\" that incorporates \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" (\"Scratch My Back,\" \"Little by Little,\" \"Happy Birthday\"). ***\n\nLucinda Williams: West (2007, Lost Highway) Williams has cited Bob Dylan's bone-simple Time Out of Mind as the inspiration for 2001's Essence, and West is in that mode. Riding a deep, lazy groove and keyed to a title refrain Williams repeats twenty times, the opener, \"Are You Alright,\" employs the commonest words in the language to pound home how totally (and tenderly) you can miss your ex-lover. Or conceivably your mother after she's passed, as in the more imagistic \"Mama You're Sweet\" reminds us. Many of West's tracks are very nearly in this class, including the pained \"Unsuffer Me,\" the vituperative (and, remarkably for Williams, funny) \"Come On,\" the obsessive avant-barnburner \"Wrap My Head Around That,\" and the formal exception \"Fancy Funeral,\" a detailed, practical advice song Williams wrote after family pressure compelled her to plan and pay for her mom's. But then there are the washouts. \"I'm learning how to live/Without you in my life\"? \"The mystery and splendor don't thrill me like before/And I can't feel my love anymore\"? These aren't intrinsically disastrous lines, though \"mystery and splendor\" is pushing it; it's possible to imagine Trisha Yearwood or Nanci Griffiths covering them. But in neither case does the music put the songs across. And then there are the mock metaphysics of \"What If,\" which with its silly conditionals is even more regrettable than her former low point, the biblical \"Broken Butterflies.\" [Rolling Stone: 4]\n\nThe young are right to think she's old--having finally broken through at 45, she's now 54. She affects authenticity as shamelessly as her role model, Bob Dylan. But with respect to all the other noble old pros deploying blues and country readymades, the craftiness of Williams' vocals, meaning their unnaturalness, secures their vitality. She doesn't fake spontaneity--she honors it as one of the constellation of life virtues she hopes her songs evoke and subsume. Protruding from this metaphysical quest, her palpable concern for her ex-lover and warm affection for her mom are strengthened rather than compromised, and when she disses her dead mom's funeral, the bile seems organic by contrast. Certainly not what I would call soul. But it knows things about soul that the soulful may not. A\n\nKelly Willis: Translated From Love (2007, Rykodisc) Once Kelly Willis's big, intent voice and impeccable simplicity made her a textbook country shouldabeen. But with four kids and a decade of marriage to fellow shouldabeen Bruce Robison in the bank, her good taste tethers her to the old homestead on her first album since 2002, taking off only once: on an unlikely cover of Iggy Pop's \"Success\" brought to her by producer Chuck Prophet and arranged for a ghost version of the Sir Douglas Quintet. [Rolling Stone: 2.5]\n\nBrian Wilson: Gettin' in Over My Head (2004, Rhino) Only diehards--and there are a lot of them--believe Brian Wilson can still sing. In the vocal fact, he's labored, bombastic, and pitch-challenged, far from a boy and not much of a man. It's not the cameos by Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, and Elton John that make this an improvement on 1998's atrocious Imagination, but the absence of schlock-rock collaborator Joe Thomas. Whether bigging up New Orleans r&b or bowing toward Nelson Riddle, Wilson's orchestrations have some juice. But from the bald I-have-survived of \"How Can We Still Be Dancin'\" to the lost fun-fun-fun of \"Saturday Morning in the City,\" the lyrics are embarrassing. And the only time the old Beach Boys harmonies take off is the only time he doesn't overdub them himself. [Blender: 2]\n\nWussy: Left for Dead (2007, Shake It) On 2005's Funeral Dress, Chuck Cleaver had a hand in seven of eleven songs; now, his partner in art and life Lisa Walker takes eight of twelve. More soulful, sinewy, and sexy than first appears, Walker's solicitous voice suits lyrics that mix goodly dollops of Midwestern Christianity--angels, communion"
