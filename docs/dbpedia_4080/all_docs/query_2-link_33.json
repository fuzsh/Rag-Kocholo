In 1973, Peter Lewis, Jerry Miller, and Bob Mosley reformed the legendary Moby Grape for some live shows, with guitarist Jeff Blackburn and drummer Johnny Craviotto taking Skip Spence and Jerry Stevenson's places. This superb set from the following May finds them on fiery form, as they tackle a range of Grape classics. Originally broadcast on KLMF-FM, the entire broadcast is presented here with background notes and rare images.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nKH 9022LP\n\nLP version, pressed on 180 gram vinyl. October 22nd, 1968 found Moby Grape supporting on a bill with Procol Harum and The Churls in the gym at Stony Brook University, New York. They had recently become a quartet following the departure of troubled singer/guitarist Skip Spence, and this superb set captures them in transition from their psychedelic ballroom days to a mellower, country-based sound. It's presented here with background notes and rare images.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nKH 9022CD"
