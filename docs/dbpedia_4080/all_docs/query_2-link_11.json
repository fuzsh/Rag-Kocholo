        "text": "Jerry Miller, one of the music world’s most beloved and admired guitarists and co-founder of Moby Grape, died on Sunday (July 21) in his Tacoma, Wash., home. He was 81 years old.\n\nThe news was shared via a Moby Grape Facebook fan page, according to Variety. “Sadly, Jerry Miller passed away last night,” said the fan page post. “Jo and the family are asking for everyone to please give them some privacy and respect, and Jo asked that people cease phone calls for the time being. Thank you.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, a text from Miller’s wife, Jo, was shared to the group: “Everybody flood the ether with Jerry Miller’s music. Play it all day long for me and him. And thank you all so much.” His cause of death has yet to be revealed.\n\nMiller was born in Tacoma, Wash., in 1943 and grew up playing in various local bands including the Elegants, the Incredible Kingsmen and the Frantics. When he was just 23 years old, he co-founded Moby Grape as the lead guitarist alongside Skip Spence (guitar), Bob Mosley (bass), Don Stevenson (Drums) and Peter Lewis (guitar). The band name, chosen by Mosley and Spence, was inspired by the punch line of the joke: “What’s big and purple and lives in the ocean?”\n\nThe group signed with Columbia Records and recorded four albums for the label between 1967 and 1969 — their self-titled debut in 1967, 1968’s Wow/Grape Jam, 1969’s Moby Grape ’69 and 1969’s Truly Fine Citizen. Moby Grape disbanded in 1970, but regrouped in 1971 and have played and recorded music with various members throughout the years since.\n\nMiller’s guitar skills were beloved in the instrumentalist community, with Robert Plant citing the star as an influence for Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton naming him the “best guitar player in the world.”"
