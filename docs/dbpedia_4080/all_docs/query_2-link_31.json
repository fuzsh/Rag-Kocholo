        "text": "Yet Moby Grape's music stands as some of the best to come out of San Francisco's late-'60s acid-fueled rock revolution. All five members of the original lineup wrote and sang, all brought differing yet complementary influences to their potent brew of folk, blues, country and straight-up rock 'n' roll, and just as early Pink Floyd had its \"crazy diamond” in Syd Barrett, the Grape had its own mad-genius-in-residence in guitarist-vocalist Skip Spence. They never broke as big as some of their contemporaries (Hendrix, Joplin, the Dead), but the Summer of Love wouldn't have been the same without them.\n\nTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of that heady season of turning on, tuning in and dropping out, Columbia/Legacy has released \"Listen My Friends!,” a collection of 20 of Moby Grape's best tracks from the four albums they managed to record before their label dropped them in late 1969.\n\n\"By the time the ‘summer of love' got popular, it was kind of fading,” recalls Don Stevenson, the band's drummer/vocalist, who works as a sales director for a large resort developer based in Whistler, British Columbia. \"But there was a period of time there where there was just an amazing amount of energy, an amazing amount of excitement.\n\n\"And all of that music going on up in Sausalito and San Francisco ... it was just fantastic. When the energy starts to roll, and there's so much creativity and so many positive things going on, it's just an amazing feeling to be in the middle of it.”\n\nStevenson and guitarist-vocalist Jerry Miller had been keeping an ear on the developing San Francisco scene from their Seattle stomping grounds, until their band, the Frantics, managed to land a gig at a Bay Area club. It wasn't exactly the kind of venue they were wishing for, but it was a starting point.\n\n\"That was right at the time when topless dancing came in, and we ended up being, like, a background band for women who wanted to expose themselves,” Stevenson said. \"We opted out of that after about a week and went down to the Peninsula.”\n\nMeanwhile, Matthew Katz, recently fired from his job as Jefferson Airplane's manager, was looking to form a band around ex-Airplane drummer Spence, who would be the group's front man on guitar and vocals. Katz recruited finger-picking folk-rocker Peter Lewis, son of movie legend Loretta Young, and baritone-voiced bassist Bob Mosley, who in turn recommended an acquaintance named Stevenson to fill out the rhythm section. Stevenson brought Miller along to participate in the first Grape jam in Katz' office. A half hour into the session, the five players looked at one another in amazement.\n\n\"The first time we ever played together, it was obvious that we didn't need to look any further for anybody,” Stevenson said. \"We loved playing together.”\n\nThe drummer admits he was a little leery of Spence, who seemed prone to unpredictable behavior, but there was no denying the musical chemistry that had ignited among the five. The Grape became the house band at the Arc, an after-hours club across the Golden Gate Bridge in Sausalito that was a popular spot for big-name musicians to gather after their shows at the Fillmore Auditorium and the Avalon Ballroom. Janis Joplin, Lee Michaels and members of Buffalo Springfield were regulars in the audience and became avid Moby Grape fans, which led to a contract with Columbia Records.\n\nTheir self-titled debut album is inarguably their best work and one of the finest albums produced during the flower-power explosion, yet devoid of such period cliches as psychedelic sound effects or extended, meandering solo tangents. Surging, melodic rockers such as \"Hey Grandma” (a Miller-Stevenson composition) and \"Omaha” (Spence) were tight and radio-ready, filled with glorious five-part harmonies driven by a seamlessly interwoven three-guitar front line. Heartbreakingly beautiful ballads such as \"8:05” (Miller-Stevenson) and \"Sitting by the Window” (Lewis) were chart-worthy as well.\n\nBut label execs went overboard with their hype campaign, releasing five singles at once, which put off radio programmers and the public alike.\n\n\"I didn't realize at the time that people would kind of think that was like something they'd do with the Monkees rather than a real band,” Stevenson said.\n\nMeanwhile, Moby Grape's performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival was excluded from the seminal movie of the event because manager Katz demanded $1 million for the rights to film the band.\n\nBut most tragic of all was Spence's drug-aggravated nervous breakdown in 1968, during which he took an ax to Stevenson's hotel room door.\n\n\"I always thought he was strange, but I always had a great deal of love for Skippy,” Stevenson said. \"We were in the trenches together. We played together.”\n\nAfter issuing one acid-addled solo classic, \"Oar,” in 1969, Spence never recorded again. He died in 1999. The surviving members of Moby Grape have kept in touch, though, and the latest in a series of reunions seems to be in the works that may include Spence's son, Omar.\n\n\"It does seem like that may be a reality,” Stevenson said. \"I honestly think there's still some real beautiful music left there, because the entire band is together, and Skippy's son has kind of plugged into his part. I think maybe there'll be something meaningful, musically, happening. I certainly have some hope for that.”"
