        "text": "At last the end is nigh. The final five albums from my debut album list. Yes I know it’s forty not fifty, I can’t count. Sorry. Anyway, let’s press on, I’m sure you’ve been on the edge of your seats waiting…\n\n“The United States Of America” – The United States Of America\n\nI’m not old enough to remember “The Rock Machine Turns You On”, the first cheaply priced sampler album issued by CBS in 1968. Well I’m not old enough to remember it at the time, but at some point around 1982 a copy of the LP somehow ended up in my brother’s record collection. I think my mother found it for him in a charity shop where she worked and thought he might be interested in it. He may not have been that interested at the time, but looking back on the track listing the LP does hold pointers to music that both he and I would end up listening to later on in our lives. It’s a very 1968 album, and a very CBS ’68 album – there’s Dylan in John Wesley Harding mode, Simon and Garfunkel doing “Scarborough Fair”, Al Kooper gets in there with Blood Sweat and Tears, the Byrds drop by for the oceanic “Dolphin’s smile”, “Time of the season” before it became a hit… But there’s oddities too, and looking back suddenly a few songs make sense. As in “So that’s why I recognised ‘Can’t be so bad’ and ‘Sisters of mercy’ and ‘Turn on a friend’ when I heard them…”. I don’t think my brother played the album many times, but even back in the early 80s I remembered that ridiculous song with clanging noises and screeching violin about a wooden wife. That kind of song you don’t forget in a hurry.\n\nJump to the late 90s – ’97 or thereabouts – and I spot “The United States Of America” on LP and CD in Diverse Records I examine the sleeve on the LP, it looks a very ’68 CBS LP sleeve – all the lyrics on the back in the same manner as “Bookends”, but I pick up the CD instead. I suppose my interest had been piqued by “Love song for the dead Che”, the debut single by Northern Picture Library back in October ’93 which was a cover version of a song from this LP. I didn’t know much more about the band but I was going through a phase of listening to as much odd music issued by CBS in 1968 and this fitted that bill perfectly.\n\nThe United States Of America were the brainchild of Joseph Byrd, an attempt to bring radical ideas – political satire, electronic instrumentation, avant-garde experimentation – into mainstream music. It all must have sounded very revolutionary when it was released in early 1968, but then revolution was in the air that year – everyone thought it would happen sooner or later. I’m not going into the socio-political side of things here – there’s been enough books about that over the years and I’ve read quite a few of them – but purely in musical terms, this album was its own revolution. There were no electric guitars at all, just bass guitar, drums, electric violin and a range of primitive synthesisers and effects – ring modulators, oscillators and more. And then there was Dorothy Moskowitz as lead singer, her voice alternately soft and harsh – a counterpart to Grace Slick in Jefferson Airplane.\n\nThe opening of “The American metaphysical circus” wasn’t inspiring – a collage calliopes and barrel organs and marching bands for almost a minute, then creeping into the sound picture is a strange unearthly noise like a buzzing bee, then the song starts – slow and careful, bass and drums and keyboards and vocals while in the distance peculiar noises echo. And with each verse’s pass, the female vocal – so calm and serene – changes, different effects each time it’s clearly an homage to “Being for the benefit of Mr Kite”, yet is far more sinister – the chorus runs “And the price is right, the cost of one admission is your mind”. And as the music rises, the words get submerged into the rising clanging of the electronics. Finally the song collapses back into fairground music. Very odd. “Hard coming love” starts like a typical late 60s US psych raver – blaring keyboards, pulsing rhythm section, a lead guitar seemingly searing through the song. Only it’s a distorted keyboard, and after a minute it all drops down to quietitude – Moskowitz is alluring, talking about love but meaning something else – the song stops and the synths rise to the occasion, so to speak. Dirty and hard. “Cloud song” is a gentle drum-free drift, as befitting such a title – it sounds very sixties but decidedly modern too. “The garden of earthly delights” is more hip 60s groove music, the lyrics full of drug references or war references – so many mushrooms! And the song is smothered in those typical ‘let’s see what a synth can do’ noises, but it’s fabulous psych rock and the lyrics could almost predict the rave generation – “dancing by night dying by day”. To close the side is “I won’t leave my wooden wife for you, Sugar” – all clangs, fuzz bass and satire. “You make me feel twenty five again” sings Byrd and you really don’t believe him. A glimpse of a typically perfect American family life.\n\nSide two begins with chanting in Latin before “Where is yesterday?” kicks off, with queasy sliding strings and gentle descending music and lots of echoing vocals. Unease again – “Shadows on the pavement but no bodies do you find”. It passes the time until “Coming down” kicks the door down. This is more prime psych rock – fuzz bass, charging drums, frantic tambourine, odd synth noises and a perfect drug lyric, full of what now sound like cliches but probably sounded really clever at the time – “Reality is only temporary”, “A trip that doesn’t need a ticket or a bed”. As it dies away in an explosion, “Love song for the dead Che” fades in gently, swooning strings and keyboards and a strange lyric which is heartfelt and gentle. “Stranded in time” always annoyed me, the staccato strings were very “Eleanor Rigby” but are out-of-phase so sound HORRIBLE (this is producer David Rubinson’s fault, it’s an effect he used all over Moby Grape’s debut LP for those unearthly harmonies – and if you’re thinking “What about Moby Grape’s debut?” Well we’ll get to that at another point soon enough), and the song veers from the string quartet to waltz time rock band back and forth while being another critique of straight society… “The American way of love” starts as another conventional song (unless you listen to the sordid lyrics) before rocketing into some strange areas, electric violins through fuzzboxes, space noises, discordant strings then a second section about “California good time music”, sunshine pop with a pervy twist, finally into a grinding section where all manner of craziness comes in – sections from the previous nine songs are spun in as found sounds and collaged into a daydream nightmare as the whole album replays before your ears before a loop of “How much fun it’s been” repeats endlessly. It’s a bit “Revolution 9” and a bit like “Track for speedy freaks” which closes Blossom Toes’ debut LP which crams their entire LP into one minute of confusion.\n\nAnd that’s the end of the album and effectively the end of the band. Byrd made a second album under the name Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies, confusingly titled “The American Metaphysical Circus” before heading back to academia. Moskowitz moved over to join Country Joe and the Fish and well the revolution never happened and the revolutionaries certainly weren’t on Columbia.\n\nBut.. This LP turned out to be more influential than a lot of other albums of the era. The mix of rock instrumentation with electronics was highly innovative and set the groundwork for any number of bands who integrated the two together. It was odd hearing the LP in ’97 because it sounded quite up to date, the influence upon Stereolab and Broadcast was obvious. And Portishead too (thanks Marcello). It’s now regarded as a forward looking classic and that’s the way it should be. Get past the dated lyrics and it’s a total blast.\n\n“Bringing home the ashes” – The Wild Swans\n\nIn the mid 80s the Wild Swans were spoken about as if they were a magical dream, a mirage which briefly appeared, made a perfect record then disappeared again. As soon as I read Mark Cooper’s “Liverpool Explodes!” book which mentioned them, I knew I had to hear their one single. In late ’85 I was lucky enough to buy a bootleg tape of “To the shores of Lake Placid”, the Zoo Records compilation, which the kind bootlegger had added both sides of the Wild Swans’ single at the end of the tape. “Revolutionary Spirit” and “God forbid” were as special as I had hoped. A year later I found a copy of the single in a secondhand store for only £2 and snapped it up immediately. Then in the Autumn of ’86, Strange Fruit Records issued their first batch of Peel Session 12 inch EPs – including the Wild Swans’ session from June ’82. I didn’t buy it then but found the cassette of it (in a bizarre plastic case…it seems the cassette version is quite rare, it’s not mentioned on discogs.com) in a bargain bin in Virgin in Sheffield in early ’88, and if I remember correctly I bought it alongside an Editions EG label compilation from 1981 and “Arrival” by Abba, all for 99p each. That Wild Swans session always reminds me of Spring in Sheffield, the sun starting to warm up the mornings, getting drunk and sleeping on floors on the wrong side of town, then bleary bus rides into the city centre for lectures.\n\nOne of the unexpected side-effects of the Peel session being issued was that the Wild Swans reformed, made a new album and played some gigs. When I found that they were playing Sheffield Poly (as support act for the Mightly Lemon Drops) I was ecstatic and quickly snapped up tickets. Sadly on the night the sound was typical support band mush, all midrange noise and not a lot else. I recognised their current single “Young Manhood” as the set opener, and “Revolutionary Spirit” was the closer but the rest was just noise. And they completely ignored Simon and me down the front shouting “No bleeding” at them. And the Mighty Lemon Drops were shit too. Anyway, I finally bought the LP “Bringing home the ashes” when I found a copy (it was a bit hard to find for some reason) and played it a lot, not just because I liked it but because…\n\nWell…\n\nBecause it’s a bit bloody bland. It took me a lot of listening to identify which songs were which. It’s a very late 80s production job. Lots of big drums, the latest keyboard sounds (which now date it horribly), but the real problem is the lack of dynamics. The music is great, absolutely wonderful – but there’s no lift for the choruses, nothing to make the listener sit up and take notice which makes the album sound homogenous, safe and uninteresting. Which is a shame as the songs deserve better.\n\n“Young manhood” was their ‘comeback’ single and works well as a statement of intent for the LP, a bit of a Northern Soul stomper,a list of things Paul Simpson doesn’t believe in, while the guitars chime – nice one note guitar solo. But it refuses to soar. “Bible dreams” is more remembrance of friendships and lives changed, but already the problem of the album is evident – there’s not enough variety within the songs, all spritely and brisk but nothing to distinguish them from each other. “Bitterness” and “Archangels” could be the same song – great background driving music I suppose. These songs deserve better, so much better. God I feel bad about this LP, I wish it was better. “Northern England” is slower, slightly. There’s too many simple chord changes from C to F and the like, not enough surprise. Side two just carries on like side one too. Great songs all – “Whirlpool heart”, “Mythical beast” – but ruined by the production. I should point out that Simpson’s croon is perfect and his lyrics are wonderful depictions of growing up and facing adulthood. But I so want the fog to lift off these songs. For something different to happen.\n\nFinally it does.\n\nThe closing track is called “The worst year of my life”. It’s slower, it’s based around a drum machine and high chiming guitars. And it’s different, beautiful, honest and a little bit scary because it could be me. If any song touched a nerve with me, it was this one. “There’s no golden future, just an open wound there”. God that hurt.\n\n(I’ve only just realised the drum machine pattern is the same as “Bluerings” by Microdisney, also recorded and released around the same time Make of that what you will)\n\nAfter this LP, the Wild Swans ceased to exist as a functioning band, Simpson made a second LP under the name with various Liverpool legends like Ian Broudie, Chris Sharrock and Ian McNabb, but the bizarre bubblegum pop never got issued here and then Simpson retreated into Skylab. And that was that. The essential Wild Swans can be found on the “Incandescent” compilation of their 81 – 82 material. “Bringing home the ashes” could be so much better. An opportunity wasted. Shame.\n\n“Uh! Tears Baby (A Trash Icon)” – Win\n\nAs I write this in the first week of September, there is a lot of attention on my home town of Newport. By the end of this week 150 world leaders will be attending the NATO summit at the Celtic Manor Hotel. That means David Cameron, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and all the rest of them will be here in my home town. Well…Kind of… The Celtic Manor was previously best known for being the venue of the Ryder Cup in 2010, when the world’s golf loving celebrities all turned up here. And it was odd hearing stories of Will Smith and his family eating in the Harvester on Malpas Road and that kind of thing. But this summit is very different to that. These are powerful people so the security is high – there’s police from all over the country in attendance, there’s ten foot high security fencing around the hotel and other buildings and there have been police helicopters flying over Newport day and night. But the security fencing is mainly around Cardiff – the capital city ten miles down the M4 where some meetings and meals are taking place – and has been causing traffic chaos for weeks as it has been deployed and this has caused some confusion in the media. From CNN and BBC to the Guardian, the media is under the impression that it’s taking place in Cardiff and it isn’t. Fair play to Newportians from Mayor Matthew Evans (never thought I’d mention him on Goldfish, hi there…) to members of GLC, they’ve done their best to promote Newport as the venue. But still Cardiff gets the security which leads to the thought that the world leaders won’t be setting foot inside the city itself, only seeing the hotel and little else. Actually no, it turns out that since I wrote this Obama and Cameron are going to visit a school ‘in Wales’ (it’s all they’re saying for now) on Thursday morning. I’d rather have the school inspectors in… Anyway, all this activity comes at a time when Cameron boosts (if that’s the right word) the country’s threat level to severe, implying that a terrorist attack is imminent. While everyone’s in my hometown. Great. I only mention this because I was listening to “Uh! Tears Baby” by Win last night and it struck me that while the music is dated the lyrics are still pertinent and relevant. But we’ll get to that soon enough…\n\nWin are now seen as a footnote in Davey Henderson’s biography – a gap between the Fire Engines and Nectarine Number Nine – but at the time they felt like a big deal. I first came across them playing “You got the power” on “The Tube” in the autumn of 1985 and loved the song. It also turned up in an advert for McEwans lager around the same time (thanks again Marcello). I didn’t buy the single until it was reissued in 1986 in a double 12 inch with their previous single “Unamerican broadcasting”, both on Swamplands Records, the label set up by Alan Horne after Postcard, and home to James King, Memphis and Paul Quinn. “You got the power” had quite a provocative sleeve – a baby holding a Cadburys Flake with a blue background. Hmm….nevermind. Anyway, there were more singles and finally the album “Uh! Tears Baby” was issued in 1987 on London Records who had taken over Swamplands.\n\nAnd much success was expected. Only it didn’t happen. Already by 1987 Simon Reynolds was mentioning Win as failures in one of the essays later collected in “Blissed Out” – “Win lost!” he stated. They were entryists, trying to subvert from within the pop system, but by not having an entry into the charts they had already failed, according to Reynolds. Was that really the case?\n\nThe album opens with a bright blast of guitar before the jogging rhythm of “Super popoid groove” starts. A massed chorus sing the – ahem – chorus “What I want is a super popoid groove, it’s the type of sort of thing that just makes you want to move”. Awkward already. The song was originally a ‘slagging’ of Duran and Spandau but became a celebration of the tackiness of great pop – “chewing gum for the ears, a dashing young valium to soften the fears”. It bounces along nicely, and reached a heady number 63 in the charts. “Shampoo tears” is another bright (failed) single and indicates that the world is cruel and there’s no protection from a high rate of infection… Is Henderson talking about something else here? (Yes). Back in the mid 80s the biggest threat to life was either heroin or AIDS, and Henderson knew a lot about the former – there was a lot of it in Scotland at the time. (By the way I feel like an imposter writing this by the way, this is a very Scottish record and I’m Welsh so can’t quite pick up the nuances but I’ll do my best. Apologies to Scots reading this). “Binding love spell” is about..well.. Love I suppose. “Un-American broadcasting” is a more polished rerecording of their debut single, and the sharp funk edges have been smoothed away, and the Speak and Spell games make less sense too. But lyrically the anti-American sentiment is still strong. “Turn your ABC into any language…turn your ABC into propaganda…”. “Hollywood Baby Too” is a bit of a glam stomper – there’s definitely a bit of “All the young dudes” in there – but lyrically dismisses the Hollywood dream factory. “Empty holsters” is slower and deeper, taking pot shots at America in general and gun culture. (I could be wrong about all of this, mind) but comes across like T’Pau while Carol Decker pops outside for a quick ciggie break.\n\n“You got the power” is bright and brash but hides a powerful message – “You got the power to generate fear, you got the power to censor what is real…”. Is that the media, or the government? That such a song sneaked onto TV through an advert for lager must have amused Henderson. “Charms of powerful trouble” is Prince doing Bolan, and feels troubled itself – those vocal chants are unsettling – “Just one thing I don’t want to dream of – J Edgar Hoover and his poisoned doves”??? “It may be a beautiful sky tonight but it’s only a shelter from a world at risk” is little more than the title but is as uneasy in its skin as the previous song. A brief vocal reprise of “Charms” leads to the final song “Baby Cutting”. Big tribal drums and more unease musically and Henderson whispering threats, half the time inaudible but very scary – all the unease in the previous songs is unleashed here. “Like a baby cutting the heads off flowers, here she comes…”. Do they mean Maggie? “She will double your money…”. Of course this was the era of privatisation of British Gas, she oversaw all that…\n\nI played the album a lot when I bought it in late ’87 and though I didn’t understand it much (and I don’t now – see previous paragraph) I felt it was a special record. There were important thoughts hidden in the music which was typically mid 80s – brash, bright, shiny… (A quote from a Japanese website on this album says it all – “The debut, Uh! Tears Baby (A Trash Icon), featured danceable rhythms, sunny vocal harmonies, glossy synths. This record actually grooved”). But people didn’t get it. I lent a tape of it to a friend in Sheffield and he said it sounded like Wham! and dismissed it. Win would move to Virgin Records, create another bubblegum pop gem in “Freaky Trigger”, still have no hits, play one of the shortest shows I saw at the Leadmill (after five songs Henderson apologised that all their machines had broken down and the band left the stage, never to return) and that was Win’s career over and done. I lent my CD of “Uh! Tears Baby” to a friend in college in ’91 and never saw it again, a decision I would regret when the CD started selling for silly money on Ebay. But I did find another copy a few years back in a charity shop and listening to it was like getting reacquainted with an old friend – quite tearful in places.\n\nDoes the LP relate to NATO? No not really. But it’s only a shelter for a world at risk.\n\n“Neil Young” – Neil Young\n\nI would expect that most readers of Goldfish know who Neil Young is. Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse, Crosby Stills Nash and Young… But back in 1993 I didn’t know that much – they were just names, I didn’t know the music. That changed when I borrowed “Decade” from Cardiff library. I taped it without listening to it and the next morning my father drove me to work from Penarth to Newport as he was on his way to Swindon. The tape started playing and we were both gobsmacked as great song followed great song. Admittedly we both got confused when “Broken arrow” started with a pisstake of “Mr Soul” which we’d only just heard. But where had all this music been all our lives? I started picking up Neil Young LPs that year and found a few favourites along the way – my personal favourites were “Zuma” and “After the goldrush” and I really didn’t take to “Harvest” at all. I think my brother discovered Young’s music around the same time, so we all ended up swapping favourites and hunting for bootlegs… Actually there’s a funny story there… A certain record shop was selling the 4 CD “Rock’n’roll Cowboy” set and my father went in there to buy it and they refused to sell it to him, thinking this middle aged bearded gentleman in a suit was a plant to catch them selling boots. He told me about this and as I was known to the staff as a regular customer I went in there the next day and asked for the same set, bought it and explained that the gentleman wanting to buy it the day before was my father. Oh how they laughed, just as you are now. Sigh.\n\nAnyway, let’s have a look at Young’s debut LP cunningly entitled “Neil Young”. It was recorded during 1968 and initially released at the end of that year to be withdrawn, remixed and reissued early in ’69. The reason for this is because it was originally mixed and issued using some ‘fancy’ stereo to mono processing which made it sound awful. The album was made in the immediate wake of Buffalo Springfield falling apart, and there are links to Young’s songs from their second album “Again”, notably some arrangements and production by Jack Nitzsche. But Young claimed that he disliked the experience of recording ‘alone’ and moved away from the sound of this album quite radically with “Everybody knows this is nowhere”.\n\nBut that’s jumping ahead. The LPI starts with a pleasant country trot of an instrumental called “The emperor of Wyoming”, full of twanging guitars and a sweeping string section. Nice but unexpected. “The loner” sees Young setting himself up as an outsider to everything – surely he’s writing about himself here? Lots of delicious fuzztone guitar and creamy organ (did I just say that? Sorry), but from time to time this strange string arrangement drops by with little bursts of fuzz guitar. What’s all that about? “If I could have her tonight”…ah I suppose I should mention that when I first heard this LP in the summer of ’93 I was still crushing on someone and the songs have relevance from that. “All of a sudden she was on my mind…” Ha yes indeed. A hope of love, and the guitars jangle and chime quite gorgeously here. “I’ve been waiting for you” is more of the same, Young looking for a woman to save his life… Those little piano figures and the descending organ swells… Love this song, and then the guitar solo rises up from nowhere! It’s very post-psychedelic, in a good way. “The old laughing lady” harks back to “Expecting to fly”, but is quietly spooked, and after a few minutes of the music swelling up and down it finally strikes you – it sounds like a track from David Axelrod’s “Songs of Innocence”. But then it’s the same players – Carol Kaye on bass, Earl Palmer on drums. Check those drum snare fills and rolls. But the song is spooked as hell, those strings are uneasy and the female backing vocals are in pain.\n\nSide two starts slow and uneasy – “String quartet from Whiskey Boot Hill” leads into “Here we are in the years”, a supposedly relaxing homage to relaxing in the sun, chilling out in the country… And hang on, where did that Moog come from amongst all the arpeggio guitar chime? “What did you do to my life?” is another lovelorn mid-tempo beauty, lots of vibrato and fuzztone guitars and echoing backing vocals. “I’ve loved her so long” is in the same category as “The old laughing lady” and sounds even more like David Axelrod, the vibes and electric piano and string arrangements. Those backing vocals are unsettling too. There’s such a melancholy mood across the whole side as it drifts by. Finally “The last trip to Tulsa” is mainly Neil and his acoustic guitar singing a very Dylan-esque travelogue, lots of dread there too. Very quotable lyrics too. Not quite “Desolation Row” though.\n\nIn the end, this album was the most logical direction for Young from Buffalo Springfield but not really right for him and he found the Rockets – his own Rolling Stones, as he called them – and was invited into Crosby, Stills and Nash and the rest is history. He was lucky to be on Reprise Records at the point where they were letting artists experiment with their music – it wouldn’t happen today. But as it is, “Neil Young” isn’t as bad as he makes out. For a start, both Bowie and the Pixies have covered songs from this LP, which is odd. And there’s a lovely innocence about the love songs which is striking. And more than anything, it sounds like Neil Young fronting late 60s Axelrod. What’s not to love?\n\n“Colossal Youth” – Young Marble Giants\n\nThere have been plenty of candidates for ‘the worst year of my life’ (do you see what I did there?) but 2007 is still the freshest in my memory. I lived through 2007 with two massive storm clouds hanging over me – both of my own making and both would lead towards my Aspergers diagnosis the following year. This has made writing about music from 2007 very difficult – I was hoping to include “Fourteen autumns and fifteen winters” by The Twilight Sad in the previous blog post but listening to it brought back so many memories of Spring ’07 that I found it impossible. It’s a great album, you should listen to it, but I can’t yet. That album alongside “Sky blue sky” and “Never hear the end of it” and “Out to sea”… Can’t listen to them. That’s just how Spring ’07 was for me. House husband driven quietly nuts by too many dirty nappies, too much CBeebies and too much time on my hands. Thank you sorry.\n\nBut the Autumn of ’07 was… Not a lot better to be perfectly honest. But at least I was working. I’d started a job in July for A Major Internet Provider, working in their call centre doing technical support over the phone. If you had a problem you’d ring me on a premium rate number and I’d try to sort you out within the twenty minute limit imposed by OFCOM. Want to set up an internet router? Simple, just type in 192.168.0.1 on Internet Explorer. (See, that number is burned into my memory). Got an email jamming your inbox? I’d go in and sort it out. (During my time there I did this for the drummer for Dodgy and the actress Jenny Seagrove – she was lovely, especially when I rang her back on her mobile to tell her I’d sorted it out). But the job was hard work, the shift pattern was crap – I was often on 2pm to 10;30pm, the call centre was a shit hole (and they admitted it), the managers were ogres who would scream at you if you took time off-line to go to the toilet… It was a great laugh.\n\nAnd in the Autumn of ’07 the first of the two storm clouds broke. I was in the dog house to put it politely and it felt like the end of the world, in a tiny way. The second storm cloud would still hang around for a few months… Actually about a month later the second cloud kinda exploded but the repercussions wouldn’t be felt for a while. But it all got a bit embarrassing and strained and oh I hated my life at the time. And it was all my fault. Every shift at the call centre would start with a long email composed to the only person I could confide in and knew what was going on and they were probably horrible to read now. I’d sit at a computer hating the job and hating myself and hating everything in the whole wide world. I would spend every break time standing by the A48 watching cars hurtle past me with “I feel like going home” by Yo La Tengo playing on my walkman. That’s a special song – slow and sad, strange guitar noises behind the piano, heart stopping chord changes… Then…\n\n“Sometimes late at night while running from the rain. Running from the voices filling up my brain, now I wish they’d leave me alone and let me be to go off on my own”\n\nAnd on that word “own” there is such a BEAUTIFUL heartwrenching chord change… And then a slightly unsettling instrumental coda. I’d head back into the call centre wiping the tears out of my eyes.\n\nAnd I bought “Colossal Youth” by Young Marble Giants at this exact point.\n\nI had almost bought “Colossal Youth” many times before. Back in 1986 I almost bought it during the summer but picked up “Here comes everybody” by The Wake instead. In the summer of ’91 I almost bought it again from Our Price when the CD reissue came out, but I bought “Funeral at the movies” by Shudder To Think instead because it was cheaper. Now in 2007 those lovely people at Domino Records had reissued it in a three CD version with EPs and Peel sessions and I’d read about it in “Rip it up and start again” so I took the plunge, not quite knowing what to expect.\n\nI probably wasn’t expecting it to be so minimal. The drum machine is tinny and tiny, the guitar and bass playing is mostly cliche-free spindly post punk. There’s occasional organ too, hinting sometimes at the sounds Robert Wyatt would make. And there was Alison Statton – blankly singing words “as if she’s at a bus stop” (as YMG guitarist Stuart Moxham said once). But in this quiet music there was a lot of power.\n\nI really don’t want to go song by song through the album because it’s a bit pointless. It’s skeletal, there’s huge spaces in the music to find your own thoughts inside, and that’s precisely what I did. I lost myself within the album, picking up lines and words from songs that were relevant to what was happening. No song outstays its welcome, it makes its point then stops. Even the instrumentals work, providing breathing space within the album. “Eating Noddemix” seems more relevant now in our multi channel multi media world. There is a typically 1980 sense of dread within the muslc, too – the unspoken fear of impending destruction. “NITA” scared me though – “You’re haunting me because I let you” was not what I wanted to hear. In fact that song brings back memories I’d rather forget. Actually so does “Music for evenings”. Why exactly am I listening to this? It’s all coming back, dark drives home, hiding in corners of the call centre where I could be alone… Oh and my car’s engine stopped working too, didn’t it? I drove to work for a 2pm start, parked at the top car park, went to move it on my first break and after 50 yards the engine imploded and I had to push it down the hill to park it up, then had to wait for the shift to end at 10:30 to call a recovery vehicle. I did ask management if I could leave early but they told me to sod off. They were nice like that.\n\nSo yes *Colossal Youth” was a relevation to me. It also sounded like the kind of music I was trying to make in 1985. Indeed if I had accepted the offer of two female schoolfriends to sing for me during the spring of that year then “808 days” may have sounded like this album. But it didn’t. And no you can’t hear it. “Wind in the rigging” has just started and I feel autumn’s chill in my bones all over again.\n\nAnd there you go, the end of the line. Thanks for reading, thanks for your patience, and thanks for your support. As Captain Sensible once song I’m glad it’s all over.\n\nNext time – Totally psyched, or how I learned to search through the rubble.\n\nYes I know… I wasn’t going to do any more of these for a while but what the hell, here goes. Five more favourite debut albums from the list…\n\n“Blondertongueaudiobaton” – The Swirlies\n\nIn the summer of 1993, this LP received a rave review in Melody Maker. It said words to the effect of “Ever wished that My Bloody Valentine hadn’t progressed straight from ‘Isn’t anything’ to ‘Loveless’?”. Which was a heretical statement for 1993 – progress was everything back then. Anyway, a review like that piqued my interest and even though I hadn’t heard a single note of their music I decided to buy “Blondertongue…”. Only I didn’t. I went into Spillers Records in Cardiff and bought the wrong CD, I bought “What to do about them” which was a mini-LP compilation of singles and oddities – even a song straight from a flexidisc. I still loved it, especially songs like “Upstairs” and “Chris R”. It felt like they had a grounding in jangle pop – which is why the “Sarah Sitting” debut EP was issued on Slumberland Records. After a few days of soaking up the early Swirlies, I went back to Spillers and bought what I was supposed to buy in the first place.\n\nThe Swirlies – at the time anyway – were a four piece band from Boston who created their own brand of music they called ‘chimp-rock’. Strangely the page on chimp-rock on Wiki goes straight into the lo-fi page. I remember reading about them in fanzines – there was something to do with kittens but it’s a long time ago. But that MM review was right – if MBV had made an LP in 1989 it would have sounded like “Blondertongue…”. But whereas MBV songs surge with noise, the Swirlies’ songs stop and start, sometimes jangle, and sometimes take so many left turns that you end up back where you started from.\n\nFor instance, the first thing I did with the CD was tape it for my journeys to and from work. But what I didn’t realise was that songs would flow into each other all the time so without having a CD player to judge where tracks start or finish (or a banded piece of vinyl) I couldn’t understand how the first few songs on the album worked. ‘Bell” has a lot of the clangour of detuned Sonic Youth but with sweet boy girl harmonies on the chorus, but heads off through tempo shifts and changes around the three minute mark before returning to the original riffs at half speed. “Vigilant always” is similar, swerving back and forth, but has little injections of words from time to time, and again after four minutes of swerving returns to its origins. Throughout the record, there’s lots of tremelo arm action on the guitars, lending the music a woozy quality – best heard on “Her love just washed away”, a languid ballad. If you could call it a ballad. Well, it’s slower. There’s nothing quite so out-there as “All I need” or “No more sorry”, and the wall of noise isn’t their only trick, and there’s enough variety to keep you listening. Admittedly I have no clear idea what any of the songs mean, but that’s never stopped my enjoyment.\n\nMy personal favourite songs appear towards the end. “Tree chopped down” could be any early 90s US indie band (that means you, Pavement) but ducks and dives around its melodies so beautifully, and also features an absolutely peerless use of the word ‘f***’ – as in “But I’ve got to get the f*** away from you’… “Wrong tube” is almost sweet, lots of unison boy girl coo-ing, jangling guitars but that opening line… “Here we are without our clothes…”. Oh. Still, glorious pop-ish melodies, lots of grinding bending guitars, a bit playful – a really good album on the whole. A lot of people prefer their second album (something about “They wasted their youth blah blah blah” can’t be bothered to look it up) but I definitely prefer “Blondertongueaudiobaton”.\n\nOh, and the CD label was ridiculously rude too. 😎\n\n“It’ll end in tears” – This Mortal Coil\n\nConsidering how much I love the music of Cocteau Twins I find it odd that I haven’t mentioned them much on Goldfish. I only heard them properly once I started listening to John Peel during the summer of ’84. I knew “Pearly dewdrops drops” from it being a minor hit single, and I knew the band received rhapsodic reviews from the music papers I read but the first time the Cocteaus clicked was their autumn 84 Peel session – “Pepper tree”, “Peep-bo” (“Ivo”), “Otterley” and “Wischt” (“Beatrix”). If anything it was that final song that clinched it for me. It sounded like a dance from a grave, some strange instrument making those sounds… I was given “Treasure” for Christmas in ’84 (alongside “Step Forward” by Portion Control and “Hatful of hollow”) and loved it, the whole album just sounds like Christmas for me.\n\nIn the run up to Christmas, Peel ran his annual Festive 50, and this was the first one I listened to – tape set on pause, as ever. The tape of course is in my attic but looking at the run-down I know which songs I taped, and I was pleased to see songs I loved in there – “Bias Binding” by Yeah Yeah Noh, “Dirty” by Hard Corps, ‘Upside down” by the Jesus and Mary Chain. Songs from “Treasure” were dotted amongst the list, but there were two songs by This Mortal Coil in there too – one sung by Liz Fraser. And I’m sure I’d probably heard “Song to the siren” by then too, either on Peel or elsewhere on the evening shows on Radio One.\n\nNow I’d love to say how cool I was at this time and that I bought “It’ll end in tears” around that time. But the truth is I didn’t. My friend Nigel did though, and I remember hearing it at his house during the mid 80s. See, Nigel was cooler than me – he’d actually been out on a date with R, my huge mid 80s crush. Sorry Nige! He was also a bit more of a goth – I can remember records by Sisters of Mercy and the Leather Nun being played at his house, though these might not have actually belonged to him. But Nigel definitely had “It’ll end in tears” and we would swoon hearing Liz Fraser’s voice amongst other things. But no, I didn’t buy “It’ll end in tears” until early 1987 so I wasn’t that cool. I did buy “Filigree and shadow” on the day it was issued in late ’86, and I have a distinct memory of sitting in a classroom in college pouring over the lavish sleeve. But I certainly wasn’t cool enough to know all the original songs either. I knew the names but not the actual music.\n\nSo what of “It’ll end in tears” itself? I don’t need to tell you that at this point This Mortal Coil come across as a 4AD supergroup – there’s appearances by all three Cocteau Twins, alongside members of X-Mal Deutschland, Colourbox, Modern English and Dead Can Dance. But there’s also other non-4AD elements – Howard Devoto and Gordon Sharp provide vocals, and it could be said that Sharp’s keening voice is as important to the LP as Fraser’s. And let’s not forget the string arrangements by Martin McCormick and Gina Ball which are perfect throughout.\n\n(But what about the MUSIC?)\n\nGawd, I hoped you wouldn’t ask that…\n\n(Oh go on, give it a go…)\n\nOh alright then.\n\nThe problem for me is that… For some of the cover versions, these songs feel definitive. As I didn’t know the originals at this point, these are the first versions I heard so for me they are the best. I know that sounds awful but… Oh Lord I’m going to sound like a grumpy old man here… Back in the mid 80s, these songs weren’t readily available to hear. You didn’t see “Sister Lovers” or “Starsailor” in record shops, they were swapped on tapes, knowledge passed from those ‘in-the-know’ to others. In a way This Mortal Coil helped to bring the music of Alex Chilton and Tim Buckley to a new generation and showed that the ‘year zero’ attitude of punk was a myth, there was great music from the sixties and seventies that was (at the time) yet to be fully discovered.\n\n(Yes yes, very canonical, but you’re still not talking about the MUSIC!)\n\nSigh.\n\nOK then.\n\n“Kangaroo” is clearly never going to be as wracked as the original, but makes it glacial and graceful – removing the deliberate destruction of Big Star’s version. “Song to the siren”… No words necessary for that one. Perfect. “Holocaust” isn’t that different from the original, Devoto’s voice is a perfect fit for the song. “FYT” sounds very dated, a very 1984 “We’ve got a sampler” instrumental, like a gothic Art Of Noise. “Fond affections” is quite lovely – those sampled choirs are straight out of the Cocteaus’ “From the flagstones” era – and very different to the Rema Rema original which is very post-punk and spiky and shouty. Quite a transformation really. “The last ray” is a very Cocteaus-esque instrumental, heavy beats and lots of Simon Raymonde’s distinctive throbbing bass. “Another day” is difficult really, it is a beautiful song in this version and Fraser sings it carefully, and the string arrangement is lovely but … Well you know the rest. Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel did this on a TV special – that’s rather good too. Actually the original is quite similar, just remove the acoustic guitar really. Move along. The medley of “Waves become wings” into “Barramundi” is very oceanic and drifts nicely. I do have a soft spot for the multiple guitars and synth melodies of “Barramundi” while “Dreams made flesh” is like a second cousin (understandably) to Dead Can Dance’s “Carnival of lights” – another song Peel played a lot that winter. “Not me” comes as quite a shock at this point – it’s an unreleased Colin Newman song, recorded as a demo for his debut LP “A-Z” (and why aren’t I writing about that LP? Sod it I will do it another time..). “Not me” is a conventional wall of guitars two chord chugger, nothing wrong with that but it sounds out of place here. And that’s a Casio VL-tone playing the melody at the end. “A single wish” is a delicate ending to the album – gentle piano, guitar harmonics, DX7 bells (there’s a lot of DX7 on this LP which dates it too). Very nice.\n\n(That wasn’t worth waiting for)\n\nSorry.\n\nAnyway, “It’ll end in tears” feels like a summary of that era of 4AD, the next This Mortal Coil LP wouldn’t have so many 4AD acts but for me “Filigree and shadow” was a better album, even if it was sprawling and expansive and just as dated by the technology used. I must admit that I never really got on with “Blood”, maybe I need to go back to it at some point. But I do enjoy “It’ll end in tears” a lot, and if you want a 45 minute experience of This Mortal Coil, it’s the place to go.\n\nSorry.\n\n“Ticket to the dark” – Troy Tate\n\nTroy Tate is one of those bit players on the periphery of pop music. Google him and you’re more likely to discover the Smiths. Look on Spotify and again the Smiths appear. But he was involved in some great music – not just with other bands but also under his own name.\n\nHe first emerged in early 1981 when he became guitarist for The Teardrop Explodes. Julian Cope’s band was on the verge of a commercial breakthrough with their first hit single “Reward” but they’d lost guitarist Alan Gill through sheer far-out behaviour, and Cope took the chance to sack keyboard player Dave Balfe too, move himself off bass guitar to become lead singer and hire new musicians for guitar, keyboards and bass. In his memoir “Head on” Cope writes of how he and drummer Gary Dwyer took hits of acid while watching people audition and hired musicians if they were bearable. But he does say he liked the way Troy Tate clanged his guitar. Tate had previously played with a group called Shake who made two singles but this was the big time. Within weeks he was on Top Of The Pops alongside the rest of the band. During the chemical excesses of 1981, Tate acted as a buffer between Cope and Dwyer and the other new members of the band and one wonders at what he saw on the road. In the meantime his guitar shone brightly – from the electric sitar solo of “Passionate friend” to the extended live jamming on “The culture bunker” and “Sleeping gas” to the more subtle arpeggios of “And the fighting takes over” (for which he wanted a writing credit – Cope refused).\n\nWhile all this was happening Tate was also signed to the Why-Fi label as a solo artist and issued a handful of singles during the 81-82 period of his membership of the Teardrops. Also there were two songs issued on “To the shores of Lake Placid”, a compilation on Zoo Records, under the name The Turquoise Swimming Pools. This was a studio band made up of Dave Balfe, Troy Tate and Hugh Jones, recording songs by Balfe at Rockfield Studios during the summer of ’81 when Balfe was out of the Teardrops. The two songs “The Winds” and “Burst Balloons” are moody and full of melancholy. I can never really tell if Tate is singing – it sounds like him but could be Balfe (admittedly I’ve never heard Balfe sing) but those defeated cries of “Oooh how can we soldier on?” are heartwrenching. Tate’s solo singles from this time utilised musicians he knew – Balfe on kayboards, Rolo McGinty on bass (he was one of the many bass players in the Wild Swans) and Virginia Astley on backing vocals – she was in the Ravishing Beauties alongside Nicky Holland and Kate St John and was also signed to Why-Fi. The key songs from these singles eventually found their way onto Tate’s debut LP.\n\nBy the middle of ’82 Cope was intent on destroying the Teardrops, even though the early months of the year had seen them playing some wonderful gigs. With Balfe back in the lineup and new bass player Ronnie Francois they were shit hot live, and Tate’s guitar could soar and scream through anything. (See “Rachael built a steamboat” for evidence of how great this line-up was). After two massive gigs supporting Queen at Milton Keynes bowl in early June, Cope sacked Tate and Francois… I just realised that the episode of Pop Quiz with Tate on it (broadcast 12th June) was taped before that obviously. Tate went straight from Teardrops to fronting Fashion for a few months while Dee Harris sodded off to join Rick Wright in Zee (why do I know this stuff? I’m not researching any of this – I KNOW this much useless information). Anyway. Tate was now a free agent after Fashion and signed to Rough Trade for another solo single in early ’83 “Love is…” Is the only Troy Tate record available on Spotify and one of the b-sides – “I’m mad” – is an odd little gem.\n\nBut it was through the Rough Trade connection that Tate came to produce the first album by a new band signed to RT – The Smiths. The whole album was recorded during the summer of ’83 but was rejected before any final mixes were prepared, it seems. There have been all sorts of rumours regarding why the album was rerecorded – the one I believe the most is that Tate was concentrating too much on Marr’s guitars than Morrissey’s vocals, which is why a lot of the songs that have leaked out unofficially only have guide vocals. One song was issued at the time, “Jeane” became b-side to “This charming man” and shows that Tate had better ideas on layering guitars than John Porter had on the rerecorded debut, which sounded drab, flat and tired.\n\nStill, Tate bounced back from that disappointment to sign to Sire Records and issued his debut album “Ticket to the dark” during the summer of 1984. I didn’t buy it at the time but I bought it second hand from Kellys in Cardiff market early in ’86 as I was on my Teardrop Explodes kick at the time. I’m jolly glad I did, though it took me a while to get my head around the album.\n\nThis wasn’t helped by the opening track “Party”. It’s a sprawling 6 minute number anchored around a simple bass and drum pattern, then on top there’s madly strummed acoustics, synthethic noises, clangs, people laughing, and Tate sings a series of odd lines, like a collection of snippets from conversations at a party… Totally unconnected lines, overlapping each other, he’s trying to connect but failing … “You read the papers? I read the papers too… Let’s talk about more important subjects…” Non-sequitors abound – “Will I have my trousers on when they drop the atom bomb?”. What does it mean? “There’s a million things I want to say…” Tate sings at the end. Go ahead…\n\n“Thomas” is a more conventional pop song, and was a single in early 84 – I remember Morrissey treating it kindly as guest reviewer in Melody Maker. A remembrance of an old friend seen at a station, but written in a subtle way that you may miss the sentiment – or the message – even during the last verse. “Love is…” is a gorgeous pop song, all hooks and synths and airy twelve string acoustics – but the melancholy chorus hurts, as do the words – a moment of understanding that an affair is ending. In a perfect world a hit single. “Winning team” is peculiar – Tate is advocating the joys of pushing ahead, taking each day in your stride, it’s a bit of a yuppie anthem, he’s trying to be Bowie vocally. But he doesn’t sound convinced by what he’s singing – he sings “You’ll reap the benefit” so cynically. “All the way up” is another hyper 80s production, synth horns, slap bass, gated drums, and on the surface it’s more optimism but halfway through it falls apart – “Let’s spend a night in the city. Missed the last train”, and it goes all jazz for some reason. Part of me HATES how tacky it is, but another part of me ADORES this song. Oh well. End of side one\n\n“Factory girl (whip crack away)” provides a similar start to side two as “Party” did to side one – ie, a long song full of odd noises, strange words, music in and out of focus, sections of completely unrelated music, and Tate sings and shouts – “Set me free!”, “Whip crack away”… But the chorus is compulsive and tuneful. Halfway through Tate mumbles “I’m glad of this protection, you know I need this sense of belonging”. Quite. Bizarre but great. “Safety net” is a little tale of crossing borders. “House of the new breed” is slower and more considered, lots of bass and drums and space and contrapuntal keyboards and guitars, though what Tate is singing is kind of disturbing – “Watch the skeleton clotheshorse as his teeth fall out”. Then towards the end, Tate finally does some guitar tricks like he did on “Like Leila Khaled Said”. “Lifeline” was an old recording from ’82 and features Balfe on keyboards and sounds a bit Teardrops-y, but has a kind of restless skank to it, very moody and dark. (That was a single?). Finally “I’m not your toy” is sharp and defiant, a good ending. Tate’s fed up with someone – “You live your life like a bad TV play” – but there’s real hurt in this song – “I will meet you with your clothes ripped and torn, and you’ll wish you never were born…you with your lying eyes”. It’s my favourite song from the album, probably because it actually sounds heartfelt. It also reminds me in places of Channel 4 music and “Sleepless night” by the Kinks – but I doubt anyone else hears that one. (Can I get away with saying I like the sepulchral mood of side two of “Sleepwalker” here so my brother doesn’t notice?).\n\n“Ticket to the moon” didn’t do much but Sire believed in Tate enough to allow him to make a second solo album and after that… Well who knows? He just faded into the background. I have no idea what he’s doing now and it’s not exactly a mystery like Lewis or anything… His LPs aren’t high on anyone’s lists for reissuing. Still there is a very fine website here with full downloads of both albums and single tracks and even gigs. Help yourself.\n\n“Mudflat Joey” – Tse Tse Fly\n\nTse Tse Fly were from Leeds, they formed in 1988 and I first became aware of them when they were the first support act (alongside Moonshake) on the Wedding Present’s December 92 tour which I saw in Cardiff. In reality, the Weddoes could never compete with Moonshake who were at their absolute peak then and played a superb tightly coiled set. Tse Tse Fly made an impression on me too that night, they sounded like distant cousins of two bands from Wetherby who were just starting to make an impression – Boyracer and Hood.\n\nThe next I heard of the band was when Cherry Red issued a 7 inch EP by them alongside an EP by Prolapse. I must admit I’ve not heard the “Fledgling” EP in full for years but know that the first song on side two was brilliant. It was also produced by Richard Formby, a name I knew from the credits on The Telescopes’ records – actually searching on Spotify has found “Brad”, the song on side two of the EP and it’s as great as I remember it being.\n\nThe following year Tse Tse Fly issued the “Scaffolding” EP which was the six minute title track and three b-sides. That title track set their style perfectly – throbbing trebly bass, stop start rhythms, mixed male / female vocals, clipped guitars. At the 2:15 seconds mark the song abruptly stops and restarts as an instrumental, repeating an insistent riff over and over as guitars squall over the top. And at 2:51 it cuts to a live feed of the recording for one iteration of the riff before returning to the main song. “That’s a very This Heat thing to do” I noted in my diary and expected good things from their album.\n\n“Mudflat joey” arrived a month or so later. “M1” starts slowly with quiet but malevolent guitars twinkling before the whole band bursts into life, frantic drums, that trebly bass again and vocals that have a Northern sharpness. There’s the female vocalist talking in the background and I’ve just noticed her saying “I’ve always been so scared of the lorries”. Jump cut into “Jonah” – a pulsing synth chord leads into more distorted guitars powered by a slightly skewed motorik beat and it stays resolutely on one chord for two minutes, and when it does change chord it comes as a shock. “Talk to me” is a more traditional song though the lyrics are…enigmatic to say the least, more clipped guitars and an urgent rhythm. “Dog-eared” is slower, brushed drums, whispered vocals, hushed guitars, still a feeling that something will explode but it doesn’t. A drum break leads into “On purpose”, almost a swing rhythm and more Velvets downstrum guitars but it doesn’t overstay its welcome by finishing around the one minute thirty mark. “Lido” is mid tempo and features a rumbling bass guitar pulse at the end, and is probably my least favourite song on the album.\n\nSide two kicks off with “Roo mole suit” (yeah, quite) which sounds like “Talk to me”‘s noisier cousin and features two seconds of gorgeous harmonised guitar which stops abruptly, as if they didn’t really want to do it. “Itchy” is louder and more like a Boyracer song but again only lasts a minute and a half, and as it fades out on a sustained distorted guitar note a drum machine kicks out a four on the floor bass drum, and then an alternate future reveals itself. “Some day soon” is like nothing I’d heard at the time and nothing I’ve heard since. The bass drum pulses, a bass guitar follows it, on one side a distorted guitar sustains notes, on another side a clean guitar repeats a small single note riff, keyboards and sequencers pulse away, a shipping broadcast can be heard, the female vocalist speaks strange words, more layers are built up over its six minutes length, and after five minutes everything is slowly obliterated by one last noisy guitar and as the song fades out it’s back to normal for the last three songs – “Non-ferrous” is like “Dog-eared”, “Kitchen” is a minute long thrash and closer “Hogwash” tries to be epic but can’t really pull it off. It’s not bad, but after “Some day soon” everything is a bit of a let down.\n\nWhat happened to Tse Tse Fly after this album? Two of them joined one of their previous members in the Wedding Present and the band effectively finished. It was a bit of a shame because there are some great moments on the album, if you like noisy guitar with an edge. But for “Some day soon” I will never forget them – it’s a song I can return to over and over again and still pick up new details every time. That song is like a future that was unexplored by the band or anyone else and absolutely marvellous. Did anyone notice? No. Does anyone care? Not really. Still, it’s a pleasure to see the album appear on Spotify so the whole thing’s going on the playlist.\n\n“Ultra Vivid Scene” – Ultra Vivid Scene\n\nSometimes I buy records on trust. I trust the label, I trust the reviewer, I trust a friend’s judgement, I trust my own knowledge to guide me to something I might like. What’s odd about “UVS” (because I’m not going to write Ultra Vivid Scene all day) is that I can’t really remember why I bought it. It was towards the end of 1988 that I bought the album – on cassette – and I have no recollection of whether it was through reviews or the cover artwork (I do like a good toothbrush) or it being on 4AD. There is a possibility that I’d seen “The mercy seat” video on “Snub” or “Rapido”. But whatever reasons, “UVS” appeared in my life just when I needed it.\n\nI’ve mentioned previously that the end of 1988 were dark days, but there were a few albums I bought then which transcended the darkness. One was “Bummed” by Happy Mondays, this was the other. At this point UVS were a one man band – Kurt Ralske – and this wasn’t quite an indie album. When I read “Blissed out” a few years later Ralske came across as an intellectual trying to create meta-pop from his influences, but I never really saw that. Maybe because I’m not an intellectual – I just took the music and lyrics at face value.\n\n“She screamed” kicks off the album nicely. A spirited thrash of a song, lots of feedback screams in the background, the song is apparently about someone’s first experience of MDMA – “when she ate half a nightmare she could see in the dark”. “Crash” is both a tribute to Ballard’s book and Ralske’s previous band, he sounds quietly pleased to be dying – “You can crash me if you like”, it’s another viewpoint to “There is a light that never goes out”. “You didn’t say please” is a mid tempo grinder, and Ralske sounds like he’s enjoying dominating someone, it’s a bit fey and camp – when he sings “Exercise is good for you, so come on – hup two hup two” its more Carry On Marquis De Sade than anything else. “Lynn Marie #2” is superior indie pop, chiming guitars and soaring melodies. “The mercy seat” is immense – tons of fuzz, deliberately slow drums, a mix of sex and religion in the lyrics. (Odd that Nick Cave would issue his own song called “The mercy seat” in the same year). “The dream of love” is a lovely (?) side closer – starting quiet and drowsy, stumbling around before reaching a quietly powerful climax. (It was this song I seem to have ripped off on “Purity”)\n\n“Lynn Marie #1” is like an inverse to “#2”, the guitars swapped for Suicide-y synths. Then side two drifts through some gorgeous hazy songs – “It isn’t real”, “The whore of God”, “Bloodline” – which tend to merge into an ocean of mumbles, organs, gentle washes of guitars. I’m not demeaning these songs, I absolutely love ’em to bit, every one of them. They have an aura of narcotic bliss about them. (That sounds very Simon Reynolds) “How does it feel?” comes as a shock – loud and fast to shake the system up, then “Hail Mary” is a slow closer, broken drum machines, crackling cables. A wonderful record.\n\nI played “UVS” all the time in Sheffield, and even lent it to a friend or two. One very perceptive person said to me “If you ever made a proper record, I bet it would sound like this” and he was absolutely right. Times have changed and I don’t feel like I did back then, but I still play this LP often. Of course their second LP “Joy 1967 – 1990” was just as good, if slightly different but their third LP “Rev” was a serious disappointment to me at the time – too organic, too rocky, too obvious. Maybe I should go back to it. But those first two UVS LPs are it for me.\n\nNext time – five more LPs to complete the alphabet. But that’ll be in a couple of weeks. In the meantime I’ve done a Spotify playlist for this blog post. I hope it works as this is all new to me. Enjoy!\n\nhttp://open.spotify.com/user/1198704842/playlist/0YgKogmW9h08ps1lLwmoFy\n\nI’m writing about fifty debut albums which I like and you may like or may want to hear. They are in alphabetical order from A to Z and are in batches of five albums. These are albums twenty six to thirty\n\n“Quique” – Seefeel\n\nIt felt like Seefeel emerged fully formed when they issued their initial EPs in the summer of 1993. I was interested by what I’d read about them, plus they were on Too Pure – another label I trusted thanks to Stereolab and Moonshake – and I always suspected they took their name from a line in “Celeste” by The Telescopes, though I’ve never seen that clarified anywhere. Their first EP “More like space” was like Mike Oldfield brought into the 1990s with “Time to find me” as the standout song – soft cooing female vocals, harsh drum machine beats and drifting synthesised chords with little bursts of feedback amid the noise and crackle. The second EP “Pure impure” was more developed, “Plainsong” and “Moodswings” were near perfect and “Milky starshine” was over ten minutes of drift. The main selling point of the EP were three remixes carried out by The Aphex Twin who had expressed an interest in what Seefeel were doing.\n\n“Quique” was released just before the end of 1993 in amongst a flurry of great albums, some of which I’ve written about it stood out simply because it was so different. It fell between so many stools – it wasn’t indie, it wasn’t dance, it wasn’t ambient but it was a little bit of all of those genres. It’s difficult to describe really… Sounds have no logical source, they are edited and looped and filtered, drum patterns are regimental and change incrementally, the bass is pulsing and deep, dropping out into vertiginous freefall, vocals are just additional sounds. It’s definitely a post-“Loveless” sound, abstracting My Bloody Valentine’s ideas to a further level, less about the power of noise and more the power of small changes within repetition. (I keep thinking Terry Riley here). There’s some industrial clanging on “Polyfusion”, drones hovering in mid-air throughout “Industrious”. “Imperial” is percussion free sound shaping… The latter half of the album gets better. The version of “Plainsong” is more propulsive than the single version. “Charlotte’s mouth” is almost normal – the sounds being almost recognisable as guitars, Sarah Peacock’s vocal is almost a conventional vocal, but there’s big gaps in the music, strange surges. “Through you” sounds like it was recorded in a wet and dank cave, the acoustics all dark reverb. “Signals” is five minutes of closing sound. But the best song is “Filter Dub” – sounds being bent, a lazy rhythm, a dub-like bass line (for once the bass is the melodic focus of a track) and guitars swooning and arcing like doves in a courting ritual. Sounds stupid? Yes. Sounds lovely? Yes.\n\n“Quique” would be the last record Seefeel made for Too Pure, in 1994 they moved to Warp Records which would feel like a logical home for them. In February ’94 I saw them live supporting Cocteau Twins in Cardiff – a wonderful pairing. My main memory of Seefeel live was the enormous wash of sound and the bass player swinging his guitar by its strap on his little finger. And I bought the white label 12 inch of alternate mixes of songs from “Quique”. Bet that’s worth tuppence now. Seefeel moved further into abstraction but still made lovely records, but “Quique” catches them at the perfect point between songcraft and loopcraft. It also makes an excellent soundtrack to painting and decorating, which is why I’m listening to it today while painting the spare bedroom. 😎\n\n“Spoonfed Hybrid” – Spoonfed Hybrid\n\nPale Saints didn’t feel quite the same as any of the other shoegazing bands they were lumped in with. For a start, they had existed for some time – I remember their name cropping up in the demos page of the short lived “Underground” magazine in early 1988 when they sounded like the Wedding Present. Well, they were from Leeds. And they were named after a quite obscure Eyeless In Gaza song, which was intriguing enough. They could make a glorious racket when they wanted to – “She rides the waves”, “Babymaker” and “Holding back the apple” were ample evidence of that – but there was always an off-kilter side to them, odd time signatures, peculiar song structures and odd dynamics. They also had a delicate side – see “A deep sleep for Steven” or “Neverending night” or “Shell”.\n\nAnd more than anything they could be unsettling – see “The colour of the sky”, an extra track on the “Half life” EP. Yes they could be sweet (Ian Masters’ choirboy vocal style saw to that) but they could be sour as well – the “Flesh Balloon” EP in ’91 summed them up well. “Hunted” built up layers of dread in 5/4 time. “Porpoise” was a six minute instrumental. “Kinky love” was a sweet cover of a Nancy Sinatra song and “Hair shoes” was a shimmering heat haze of guitars (and you can draw a line from that song’s instrumental siren melody through “King of the rocket men” by The Clouds to “Karma Police”). So they weren’t quite in the same boat as the Thames Valley boys and girls – no wonder their second album “In ribbons” had a message inscribed in the run-out groove – “Scene but not herd”. Ouch!\n\nIn 1993 Ian Masters took his skewed sense of pop craft and choirboy voice away from Pale Saints, teamed up with Chris Trout from AC Temple and created Spoonfed Hybrid, a studio concoction who would issue one album on the 4AD subsidiary Guernica. (It was released on the same day as “Euphoria” by Insides on the same label). But I didn’t buy it until Wednesday 5th January. This was my last day of living in Penarth with my parents before the big move to my new house in Newport. Everything was packed and ready to go, we’d hired a van to move everything the next day, I just needed something to listen to which would take my mind off being nervous. All my hifi was packed away so I took my newly purchased CD / radio / cassette ghetto blaster out of its box, dug out my headphones and listened uneasily in bed that night.\n\n“Heaven’s knot” starts with a stereo noise darting left and right, as it will do throughout the song. The song is more structured and precise than any Pale Saints song – tightly sequenced – but Masters sings like an angel with a halo of wordless vocals behind him. Those wordless vocals will be a trait throughout the album. Not sure what he’s singing about, but once a series of descending guitar solos start appearing in harmony who cares. Good opening. “Naturally occurring anchors” is a seemingly simple song – acoustic guitar and voice – made extraordinary by the complex layering and switching of guitar sounds – I counted about fifteen different sounds and treatments and they flick between sounds and across the stereo spectrum within a strum of a chord in some places (The song credits read Iain McKinna as “King of Mutes” – a feat of mixing desk dexterity in those days). The song closes with a descending string section, which is mirrored by the introduction to “Tiny planes”, a mid tempo song based around “queasy cellos” and clockwork percussion. Again Masters sings in enigmas – “Tiny planes fluttering against my skin… The noises of their wings excites me still” – but what the hell, the music is rich and peculiar. “Stolen clothes” starts with washes of twelve string acoustics and tablas, it sounds idyllic until you concentrate on the words which Masters sings gently “Whisper to me, hear all my fears… I’m finally beginning to grow”. Is he saying Pale Saints was holding him back? “Wash away these terrors of mine”. Some strange things are happening. “Lynched” is an uneasy take on jazz, a double bass maintains stability while strange guitar chords strum into a background of radio noise, the song is cut through with sudden bursts of noise. “1936” has a rhythm track not unlike chirping crickets, with multiple pianos holding the music together. Masters sings of “Dreams and their lies” before a section of kettle drums, marimbas and a chorus of wordless Master choirboys, then zithers and a feedbacking guitar, followed by a jazzy piano solo. None of these individual elements make sense outside of the songs but together they work perfectly.\n\n“Getting not to know” is the most Pale Saints-like, a swirling guitar figure and a raucous chorus but there’s still more wordless Masters choirboys in the background, and the end is intriguing – an ascending guitar solo followed by a slow half tempo descent as two synth notes slide downwards. Most odd. “Somehow some other life” is built up around repeated piano patterns – it feels very systems music – and Masters putting the past behind him – “Farewell to all the things you love so dearly, several skies you felt part of”. A peal of bells and kettle drums lead forward amid a swarm of ebow guitars. “A pocketful of dust” is the fulcrum for the whole album – the only song sung by Chris Trout rather than Ian Masters – and the words are now clearer, a relationship falling apart, a love triangle…some of the words are horribly painful (especially this week). “Ecnalubma” (try it backwards) comes as a moment of relief – turning the pulse of “Heaven’s knot” into an instrumental. Finally “Boys in zinc” feels like an emotional conclusion, slow chimes and strings, it almost feels Christmassy, more odd words, stately like a hymn, then after a crescendo a little guitar turns around, stops and starts, and a choir of Masters appears at the end, cooing sweetly, but the song ends on a dischord. It’s worth listening to “Eva” from Butterfly Child’s debut LP “Onomatopoiea” (released around the same time) which sounds very similar in style and music to “Boys in zinc”. Intriguing.\n\nThat first listen reflected how uneasy I was that night before I moved out. Once the move was complete and I was in my house alone the first thing I did was dig out the same ghetto blaster and play “Spoonfed Hybrid” to christen my house. Four years later it was the last record I played in that house and the first I played in the house I live in now. At the time the album was released it was uneasily lumped into the initial stirrings of post-rock – the aforementioned Seefeel, Bark Psychosis, Insides alongside Butterfly Child, Pram, Disco Inferno and others. There wasn’t much to link these bands’ musics except a forward thinking attitude to technology and atmosphere. Listening now, Spoonfed Hybrid sound like a form of psychedelia – playful yet pensive, a music for the mind. And if I move house again, it will be the last album I play at the old house and the first at the new house. It has to be done.\n\n“Switched on” – Stereolab / “Peng!” – Stereolab\n\nWhat constitutes a debut album? The obvious answer is “the first album issued by an artist”. But what if the first album issued by an artist is a collection of previously released singles? The number of times I have seen “The First Three EPs” by The Beta Band in debut LP lists… But it’s tricky with Stereolab because…well… “Switched on” was only supposed to be for the French market and a few copies were issued in the UK, and “Peng!” was issued about a month after “Switched on”… So what the hell, I’ll pick them both together.\n\nThe first I heard of Stereolab was when Peel started playing “Super-electric” in September ’91. It was the first time I’d heard a band take on board the motorik pulse of Neu! and La Dusseldorf and make something new out of it. I’d picked up the old Krautrock LPs in the mid 80s and felt like I was the only person who loved “Hallogallo” and “Rhienita”. But Stereolab loved it too. I loved “Super Electric”, all the layers of vocals and guitars and organs, especially that really loud dirty organ that threatens to overload the song around the four minute mark. So I kept an eye out for Stereolab and picked up “Switched on” a week or so before I started at the Stats Office – I probably bought it for my birthday. The album didn’t sound like a bunch of singles and b-sides, it was consistent and wonderful. “Doubt” was a 60s pop dream, the two versions of “Au grand jour” complemented each other, “High expectations” was a different kind of melancholy – “Do you really want to love someone who does not love you?” – I wish I’d listened to those words. , It felt like Stereolab had found a new way to make two or three chords sound different. It wasn’t shoegazing, it wasn’t indie, it was their own sound based on their influences. But the lyrics were something else – I didn’t really understand them, but they made me want to investigate books, learn more, learn French, be a more rounded person, they had far more knowledge and I felt like they were trying to pass that on in one form or another. But I didn’t read my books, I just enjoyed the music. That’s how shallow I am.\n\nAs “Peng!” was issued in late June 92 it may well have been the first album I bought with my first Stats Office pay packet. It certainly sticks in my mind as being there alongside “She’s a superstar” by Verve as the earliest records I bought in that ‘new era’. I’d read the Melody Maker review which stated that it sounded like they hadn’t used a mixing desk (that’s a paraphrase, I don’t subscribe to Rock’s Back Pages) so that sounded good. It wasn’t quite like that… “Super falling stars” had no drums, just guitars strumming, bass and droning organs but a lot more layered vocals. There were typical motorik songs like “Orgiastic” and “Peng! 33”, but there were experiments too – “K-stars” was built on a backwards loop of drums and organ, and had a quite gorgeous coda… (Listening to the lyrics, is this song about the Situationists in Paris, those Durutti Columnists who “just drifted”?). “You little shits” had a stilted rhythm pattern, like limping towards heaven. “The seeming and the meaning” was a pop hit waiting to happen (I put it on a mix tape for Lucianos bar and the barman loved it, even if he thought it was by Lush). You know it’s really easy to type things into Google like “Enivrez-vous” and finding it’s a Baudellaire poem. I feel really dim sometimes – why did I not know this stuff at the time? I bet Nicky Wire knew that. Sigh. “Stomach worm” was indie Status Quo and nowhere near as bad as that sounds. “Surrealchemist” is another percussion free drift of rhythm guitar and organ. And again the lyrics were intriguing, sometimes like an argument, sometimes like a lecture, but always interesting. Or in French. It did sound very upfront – not a lot of effects, not a lot of artifice – but that was probably deliberate too.\n\nSo which is the debut? Take your pick, they’re both rather good. Neither is Stereolab’s masterpiece – take your pick from “Transient random noise bursts…” or “Mars Audiac Quartet” or “Dots and loops” or “Emperor tomato ketchup” or… But as early indicators for their style, they are both near-perfect.\n\n“Jaguar” – The Sweetest Ache\n\nDuring the spring of ’91 I was catching up with Sarah Records, buying two or three singles each week. If there were multiple singles by one artist I’d buy them together, so I was buying St Christopher singles one week, Another Sunny Day the next week… I picked up Sarah 36 and Sarah 39 together because they were both by The Sweetest Ache and had similar sleeves. Sarah 36 was “If I could shine” b/w “Here comes the ocean” and sounded like a typical Sarah band, the a-side was quite nice with groovy organ and an insistent guitar line while the b-side showed more dynamics – loud to quiet and back again. A good start. Sarah 39 was more subtle – “Tell me how it feels” sounded drowsy and love-lorn, a boy girl duet on the edge of falling asleep while “Heaven scented world” was an acoustic ballad, just guitar and voice, bookended by backward noise. (I spun these backwards to find it was “Close my eyes” by Ride – a band the single’s sleeve notes slagged off!). So both good singles, lots of potential.\n\nIn May that year Sarah issued a third Sweetest Ache single – “Sickening” / “Everlasting”. This was a step forward for the band and they sounded a lot more confident. “Everlasting” was a jangly beauty with a positive spirit while “Sickening” was moodier, real pain in the words and vocal – “All I find is wasted time and an endless flow of all your sickening false promises”. A month or so later I saw a flyer for a Sarah Records Night up in the valleys – St Christopher and the Sweetest Ache up in Pentre. Sadly I saw the flyer two days after the gig itself. I was a bit gutted. From the summer onwards, a forthcoming album called “Jaguar” was promised in the Sarah leaflets, and it was finally released in Spring ’92. In the meantime there were more promises – the first two Watercolour Records singles in late ’91 promised a Sweetest Ache single coupling “Selfish” and “Hideaway”.\n\nFinally…I bought the album. After months of misery on the dole I’d landed a job at the Stats Office so my parents gave me fifty quid to celebrate and I dashed to the nearest record shop to buy all the records I’d missed during the previous months. So that was “Secondhand clothes” EP by Moonshake, “Adrenaline” EP and “Everything’s alright forever” LP by Boo Radleys, “Going blank again” LP by Ride, “In ribbons” LP by Pale Saints and “Jaguar”. That night my parents had our friends Janice and Clem over and they mentioned my purchases. “Oh let’s have a look” said Clem, I passed them over to him and he perused each sleeve as if he was taking in every detail before passing them to his wife. After examining each record, they looked at me and said in unison “Never heard of any of them, Rob!”\n\nIn amongst all the shoegazing around it, “Jaguar” felt special and slightly different. In my diary at the time I would rave about the ‘purity’ of the sound, the lack of distortion, the clarity of it all. I must admit I play “Jaguar” a lot more frequently than any of the other records I bought that day. As much as I love all those records, this album is the one I return to the most.\n\nIt opens in a most uncharacteristic way with “Briaris”. Organ chords, a gentle wash of cymbals rising like waves, acoustic guitars, a pulsing bass drum and a female vocal – a friend of the band named Louise. Pure and clear – “All good things must come to an end, throw your caution to the wind”… The chorus rises with the addition of bass guitar, the singer is double tracked in harmony now. This sounds like love – “Take that sadness away, spending days of joy together”. Then the middle eight rises – “Fade away, no more sadness…”. Like it’s that easy. Then the song fades out as she sings “I will take your sadness away”. Again, like it’s that easy. For months I’d been in the depths of despair without a job, now I had one… Was that the answer to all my problems? Would it cure the blues? “Capo” follows, Simon Court is back on lead vocals. Two minor chords on acoustic guitar, and a truth or two. “I’ll be honest with myself, it makes all the difference, it all hurts less that way if it all goes wrong some day”. Oh dear, here comes the rain again. “Surround myself with emptiness, commit myself to loneliness”. The music is melancholy, string synth chords rising for the sun, little guitar licks, tom tom rolls like impending doom, bass guitar wandering everywhere, but the root notes (can I just state the bass playing on this LP is totally unpredictable and wonderful), then at three minutes the clouds clear, a new chord change and a sax solo brightens the skies. A former Melody Maker writer once stated on Twitter that “Capo” was the purest example of what Sarah Records did. He may have been right. “She believes” is a full band performance but feels oddly weightless – the bass is acting like a lead guitar. There’s a lot of ‘feelings” here – initially the female in the song can “feel the hurt drift away” and later a litany of feelings overwhelm her – “Feel the love feel the pain feel the sea feel the sky feel the heart feel the mind… Still not sleeping”. The climax is almost too much, the drums stop rolling and go motorik, organs rise and fall, guitars solo – but there’s no distortion, no overdrive. It’s just so perfectly clean and pure. “More than this” is more doubtful, Court is trying to persuade someone – “Trust in me please, there’s one more move to make” – while guitars arpeggio and tambourines are shaken impatiently. “Tell me reasons maybe, understanding is an art for me, face to face with ugliness, there must be more than this”. Sometimes you wish someone would tell you this. End of side one.\n\n“Don’t be coy, let feelings run – forget who knows, enlighten me” sings Court at the start of the title track. Is this a continuation of the conversation from the last song? But the chorus is more forceful – blaring organ and harsh drums and – finally – distorted guitars as Court implores “I never meant to push too hard but these things kill me”, stretching these final words out. “Standing hopeful on the edge”? Is he trying to stop someone jumping off a building, or expecting a new surge of optimism? It’s never made clear. And the music rises and falls, there’s a lovely instrumental middle eight before the harsh chorus comes in, Court repeating “These things kill me” over and over again, so impassioned, as things get raucous, waves of noise, a bit of a rave up then the song suddenly stops and returns backwards. Rewrite the past? Maybe I think too much. “Bitterness” moves through a lovely chord change with added backwards guitar chords, then Court sings “Lately feeling confusion about all the things I want and need”. Some things never change. Nothing makes sense to Court, but the music swirls sweetly. “Failing every nervous move I make”, mysteries and strangeness – sorry to say that these feelings never leave you. Never ending. “Climbing” finds Court in a more positive frame of mind and the music reflecting that – light strums of acoustic guitar over spritely drums and bass. Court isn’t listening to the cruel voices, he’s seeing clearer, yet there’s a spoken section which sounds like a diary entry reciting deep dark thoughts Yet Court is still thinking positive – “I won’t succumb to that again, I’m lying sore and empty – maybe we’ll see”… Hope in despair, hope in love, hope in someone else. As the song fades out and the music dashes for some kind of resolution Court repeats “I’m seeing clearer” like his life depends on it. “Selfish” closes the album in a similar manner to “Journey’s end” closes Brighter’s “Laurel” LP – soft arpeggios and gentle music. Court sings “Another day and I have no-one but myself to understand my twisted thoughts”. Back to bad thoughts? But there’s something else – “Somewhere inside, there’s another place to be, my unselfish hideaway”. And it’s all in the mind. And we’re back to “There’s a place” on “Please please me”, the retreat into insularity, into the mind, into thought. Is that the answer? Depends on the question.\n\n“Jaguar” received no reviews in the music press, or if it did they passed me by. The Sweetest Ache were never interviewed by the Melody Maker or NME either. Later in 1992 they issued a single on Watercolour – not the songs promised but a delightful cover of Honeybus’ “I remember Caroline” backed with “Brown fox”, a seven and a half minute thriller – more dark thoughts as the music quietly prowls and Court is more worried than ever – “I taste one more time your bitter poisoned love” – and the latent agression building throughout explodes then dims down again. Simmering until it boils over again, too much pain, too much crying. It’s all too much. A remarkable song.\n\nThe next single issued by the band was on the American label Sunday Records in early 1993. “A new beginning” is a gentle acoustic drift, but Court is still not happy – “I am blinded by lies, can you hear me?”. The other side “Sweet soul sister” is odd, at the time it sounded different, a traditional rock song, typical rock guitar licks, nobody was doing this kind of thing except Delta – the former Sea Urchins. But now it sounds like a cross between “Give out” era Primal Scream and “Don’t look back in anger”. Hmm. At this point Court left the band and they recorded a second album “Grass roots” for Vinyl Japan, a record so anonymous and boring that I can barely remember it, and then split up. Various members have been in bands around the Swansea area – Shooter, The Milestone Band – and eternal thanks to Wally at The Beautiful Music for digging for information and music about these bands. “Jaguar” though is special. I keep saying that about everything. You must be so bored with me by now.\n\nNext time – nineties noise, eighties pop, misery and heartbreak- lots of misery and heartbreak.\n\nI’m writing about fifty debut albums which I like and you may like or may want to hear. They are in alphabetical order from A to Z and are in batches of five albums. These are albums twenty one to twenty five\n\n“Begin” – The Millennium / “Present Tense” – Sagitarrius\n\nBy 1967 Gary Usher and Curt Boettcher were unhappy with their existence. Sure they were both producers in LA, creating albums by the Byrds, the Association, Peanut Butter Conspiracy, Chad and Jeremy and more. But they wanted artistic freedom. They knew which way the musical wind was blowing. Usher had worked with Brian Wilson back in the early 60s – they wrote “In my room” together – and they had both moved on a long way from surf music. In late 66 Usher recorded “My world fell down” (an already exceptional song by the Ivy League) with the cream of his LA studio buddies – Glen Campbell sang lead, Terry Melcher and Bruce Johnson are in the chorus vocal mix, the Wrecking Crew provided the backing – and presented it to his record company Columbia as a new group called Sagittarius. They loved it, issued the single and in 1967 it reached the Hot Hundred without a group to promote it. Columbia were eager for an album, so Usher started to create one, enlisting Boettcher to help.\n\nBoettcher had his own problems. He had guided the early albums by the Association, adding musique concrete noise to their harmony pop sound before falling out with them, or being sacked. There were also issues over songwriting – Boettcher claimed to have written their hit “Along comes Mary” but was stung out of royalties by Tandyn Almer. There were scores to be settled, songs which had to be sung. Boettcher had created his own band the Ballroom who had recorded an entire LP for Warner Brothers which was never issued, and he was working towards creating a new seven piece band called the Millennium. Usher’s request came at the right time – Boettcher agreed to work on Sagittarius, the Millennium signed to Columbia too and worked on the Sagittarius LP, before moving to their own LP while utilising some of the Ballroom recordings. Everybody was happy. “Present Tense” was issued in July 1968, followed a few months later by “Begin”. Great success was expected – “Begin” was the most expensive album recorded by Columbia at the time – but both LPs sold less than 50,000 copies at the time. Usher left Columbia and recorded a second Sagittarius LP for his own label (which I wrote about last year), the Millennium split up after one more single leaving their talented members to solo careers and other groups like Crabby Appleton, and the two LPs were lost, forgotten or treasured by the few who owned them.\n\nBy the mid to late 90s there had been a resurgence in interest in so-called sunshine pop or soft pop, and Mojo magazine had featured both LPs in their “Hidden Treasures” page. Sundazed reissued “Present tense” on CD with bonus tracks, Creation’s Revola arm issued “Begin” and I bought both CDs within a few months of each other in 1998 – “Present Tense” from a record fair in Newport around March and “Begin” on a trip to London with my fiance towards the end of the year.\n\n“Present Tense” is the lighter of the two albums, there’s more emphasis on orchestration, harps and harpsichords and less emphasis on guitars, but there’s a lot to enjoy on the album. Side one can slide past in a dreamy mid-tempo haze of pizzacato strings, phased organs and lush harmonies – I always thought the rising and falling string figure on “Song to the magic frog” was an homage to “The dangling conversation” but I could be wrong. These are many Boettcher’s songs and his sweet breathy singing style suits the material. “Glass” comes a shock then – a mass of effects, Indian instruments, submerged vocals. Quite psychedelic then. “Would you like to go?” is apparently about the Monterey Pop festival, but taking the piss – “Where prophets play electric guitars” indeed. Side two is more varied – “My world fell down” is remixed into stereo and loses its sound effects (a request from Clive Davis, it seems) while second single “Hotel Indiscreet” (co-written by James Griffin before he joined Bread) lost its section of Firesign Theatre noises. “I’m not living here” is Boettcher settling scores, as is “Musty dusty” – a mellotron heavy remembrance of childhood, apparently co-written with Albyn but mysteriously not credited to him. Finally Usher takes control of his project, writing and singing the closer “The truth is not real”. This is perfect psychedelia, swirling organs, heavy bass and drums, lots of phasing and effects while Usher whispers of “rejecting truth because you’re out of phase”. A great closer.\n\nIf “Present tense” is sunshine-orch-pop then “Begin” is sunshine-power-pop. Not surprising considering the Millennium contained five singer songwriter guitarists. Boettcher was one of the first people in America experimenting with 16 track recording on this album, running two 8 track tape recordings side by side and it sounds like every one of those 16 tracks was filled with sound, sometimes it works and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Side one opens with an instrumental “Prelude” where a sweet harpsichord figure is smashed to smithereens by a hugely compressed drum beat – inventing Big Beat in a flash – then segueing into “To Claudia on Thursday”, an evocation of a lazy summer’s day. Side one is consistent even if the sound quality is lacking sometimes – all those overdubs – and has some delightful late 60s pop songs on it. Side two however is far superior. “It’s you” is powerful guitar pop, a protest against authority and the older generation disguised as a love song. “Some sunny day” adds some pedal steel to the mix, while “It won’t always be the same” promises secrets being revealed. “The know it all” is an uptempo pounder with distorted guitars and Hugh Masakela’s frenzied trumpet blast, with lyrics about past lives. Are they trying to make a point? “Karmic Dream Sequence #1” is a huge song with a strange edgy yet serene atmosphere (which would be replicated on “Where the geese go” by Verve) – backwards screams, celestes, a wash of guitars and whoever is singing sounds distinctly like Robert Plant at his most gentle. (Of course Plant was a huge fan of Californian late 60s rock). After four minutes, it all gets strange – more backwards sounds, kotos, reverb and wind noises. All topped off with a brief snatch of the “Prelude” harpsichord at the end. And it gets better again. “There is nothing left to say” brings all the semi-religious aspects of the music into focus – “the time is gonna come when we’re gonna lead the way, you’ll be shown the way and shown the time, we’ll only need to go…” – while the music is a rich mix of Leslie-toned guitars, pianos and aeriated backing vocals. Quite stunning. “Anthem” is a bit of a laugh to close the album, tribal drumming, wild phasing, silly “CTA 102” voices and a chant of “Columbia Columbia… C…B…S” just to annoy the label.\n\nBoth LPs are wonderful, similar but different. Neither were praised at the time but are now regarded rightly as classics.\n\n“No less the trees than the stars” – Purple Ivy Shadows\n\nBack in the day I collected record labels. Sometimes I even wrote to them and ordered records directly from them. Sometimes their mail order was so crap that I never received anything in return (I’m looking at you Fluff Record of Loughborough, I presume that Hula Hoop LP got lost in the post then). In the early and mid 90s there were numerous indie labels I’d know and look out for – Sugarfrost, Heaven Records (run by the Fat Tulips), A Turntable Friend, the aforementioned Fluff (who issued Boyracer’s debut single alongside early records by Hood), Bus Stop Records from America, Summershine Records from Australia and Watercolour Records which were based in Ironbridge in the industrial Midlands. It was the latter which was most interesting as they didn’t have one set style of music, they were quite eclectic within the genre. Their main band was The Field Trip who were are strange mix of mod and space rock (pretty sure Sonic Boom produced some of their singles), but they issued some wonderful little seven inchers – the Lean-To’s “Soapscum” EP, an odd fanzine and flexi package by the Snowbirds, the Sweetest Ache’s Honeybus cover…\n\nSome of these songs were compiled onto a CD called “Self Portrait” which would be Watercolour’s final release at the end of 1993 alongside a few new songs. There were two songs on the CD I hadn’t heard from a Watercolour single I didn’t buy until early 94, both by the American band Purple Ivy Shadows. “Cathedral Forests” and “At Eleven” both start quietly then gradually increasing in complexity with lots of delayed guitars coming to a crescendo around the five minute mark. This type of indie shoegazing was very much in fashion – a similar style was used by The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa, and there were two wonderful singles by Fur on Che Records in this vein. But Fur disappeared as did EOST and I presumed Purple Ivy Shadows had as well. I was very surprised when I saw an advert in ’97 for a PIS LP issued on Slow River Records in the UK. I hunted it down and bought it alongside its sister EP “Under and OK” in a Manchester Music and Video Exchange shop later that year.\n\nI was probably expecting more of the same – echoes, delays, oceans of reverb. I didn’t get it. Instead I was given crystal clear acoustic guitar strums, some nicely overdriven electric guitars, songs which took diversions when I least expected them, odd time changes and lyrics I would still be puzzling over for years to come. Did I care? Absolutely not. I adored it. “Pawtucket” is a fine opener and there’s some odd lyrical ideas – “What are you doing with the sun?” – and some interesting stop-start twists. “Feeble” tumbles around in 6/8 time, while “Rebuilding the ancestral statue” is an odd motorik jam – typewriters, clanging percussion, atonal horns, lots of guitars and strange words – “Plans are not politicals…” Then a strangled cry of “UUUU-niversal”. Very odd. The songs continue in this vein – falling off sideways when you least expect them, peculiar lyrical conceits – “You are a blue mountain” – references to books or films. “Roadwise blood” is the culmination of this, strange time signatures, guitars tumbling over themselves, three overlapping vocals not aiding understanding, leading to a raucous clangour of a chorus. End of side one.\n\nI’d like to say side two is easier to understand but it isn’t. “Sustance” is a more straightforward opener which is almost logical, possibly about self-destruction – “You can be a good athlete and hurt yourself, you can be a good soldier and shoot yourself in the foot”. “She wouldn’t have it” is short but unsettling, especially when huge waves of distorted guitars and drums take over the song at the end. “Stairs” is so similar in tempo, rhythm pattern and key to “Carly Simon” by Insides that I often mix them up in my mind, I really should do a mash up of the two songs. (“No, please don’t!” I hear you cry). “Dancefloor shiny under junky” is another two chord jam and yes that is a very odd title. Then it all goes really good. “No health” has more chiming guitars and stop start rhythms but a sudden melodic sense only hinted at before, then rises to a chorus of “The second I feel great comes a week when I have no health anymore” – then some lovely George Harrison-esque guitar peals to close the song. Finally “A space is needed” returns to their shoegazing past, in a way. A simple three chord guitar riff is strummed through echo and reverb, organ and bass is added, tentatively, drums are hit occasionally, the whole band seem to be warming up, working around the riff, this goes on for ninety seconds, bursts of feedback, slide guitars… Then a drummer kicks in with a offbeat waltz, the whole band drop in and link together, the song moves upwards for about thirty seconds before falling apart again, everyone dropping out and returning to that one guitar riff and droning organ echoing into space.\n\nI loved the album and played it to other people but nobody really liked it. Were the structures too odd? Wasn’t it melodic enough? Maybe it’s one of those records that gets made and then disappears. Purple Ivy Shadows made a few more LPs but none were issued in the UK, it became harder to find them as time passed but luckily they are all available on Bandcamp if you feel the need to investigate. Give them a listen, I’d love to think I’m not the only person out there who loves them.\n\n“Radar Bros” – Radar Bros\n\nThis LP was mentioned amongst Melody Maker’s Top 50 LPs of 1996 which was odd because I’d not really noticed them writing about it. But there it was, looking strange in the list. When I saw it reduced in Diverse a few months later I bought it, played it once or twice at bed time – always the best time to absorb new music – and fell asleep to it. I kept trying to listen to it, I kept falling asleep. Over and over again. What was peculiar was that I would wake up to hear the closing track, think “That was good” then switch off the CD player and fall into a really deep sleep.\n\nI knew I had to hear the album properly so put it onto tape and took it on my bus journeys. It didn’t do very well as the soundtrack for the journey to work, and whenever I played it on the journey home I would still fall asleep, often leading to me falling forward and banging my head on the seat in front of me (I’m not making this up, you know). Eventually I found it was the perfect soundtrack to the late night bus journeys from my girlfriend’s house back to mine. I managed to stay awake for the whole album and it finally made sense to me.\n\nYou see “Radar Bros” is slow-core. I’d not really come across the term or any of the music before. Reading the page on “slowcore” on Wiki “the music of slowcore artists is generally characterized by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies, slower tempos and minimalist arrangements”. So far so good. But the Wiki page also mentions that nobody liked the term and nobody used the term which is odd. Antecedants – Galaxie 500 and American Music Club. Pioneers – Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon. Wiped out by the end of grunge. So Radar Bros didn’t really fit into a genre which didn’t really exist by the time they started. Hmm. Radar Bros are what Jim Putnam did next after leaving Medicine, if you ignore Maids Of Gravity (I know, it’s gonna be hard to ignore them but you’ll try, won’t you?) They were a trio of guitar, bass and drums and played slowly and quietly, with occasional keyboards and lots of space around the music. It could be said that there was nothing new in their sound – trios had been playing slow and spacey since Free – but Radar Bros established their style and they stuck to it.\n\nSo how does the debut album sound? Slow, quiet, miserable. The songs merge into each other on initial listens, only becoming distinct entities after about ten or more plays. The lyrics are generally downbeat and pessimistic when they are not riddles. Admittedly the first few tracks really do drag a lot and I’m not surprised I fell asleep by the fifth song. “Supermarket pharm"
