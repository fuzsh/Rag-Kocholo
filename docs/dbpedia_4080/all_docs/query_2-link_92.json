It was interesting to learn about their brief rise and very long, unfortunate fall. There's a cult following around this band that perpetuates a mythology about how they were screwed badly by their manager, and should be as big as The Beatles, and so on and so forth. There's no doubt they were screwed, but it also feels like maybe there were some self-inflicted wounds along the way. In any case, they put together a great debut album with a killer sound. The fact that all five members contribute to vocals allows them to do some interesting things, especially with the harmonies. There's some nice guitar work in here as well. Best track: Sitting By The Window\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nVery much like early The Who.

That‚Äôs me patting myself on the back. In previous reviews, I‚Äôve stated that literally every band in the late 60‚Äôs San Francisco psych scene were better musicians and songwriters than The Grateful Dead, and that they all put out better, more engaging albums than the Dead. Well, guess what? Here comes Moby Grape to prove me right once again! Moby Grape‚Äôs debut impresses with intricate and interwoven multi-guitar arrangements, an incredibly tight rhythm section and excellent vocal harmonies. The guitar leads are fuzzy and the band plays with a sense of purpose throughout. This is not lackadaisically jammed psych rock; it makes its point and keeps you engaged on each track. The story of Moby Grape is rife with misfortune, but their music, even if not as well known as it should be, stands well above many of their contemporaries in the late 60‚Äôs psychedelic scene.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nWeirdly this ticked all the boxes of the kind of thing I like bit I just found it a bit boring and forgettable.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nPretty good playing, but doesn't stand out.

The gist was, they were brilliant but never really made it. I did enjoy the album but it seemed like pretty standard West Coast fare from the late 60s.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nSimilar to the Captain Beefheart album I had a couple of days ago, this is alright but I don't think it's aged well and not sure it really belongs on this list. This reminded me a bit of the Grateful Dead, which is not a good thing in my book. Some songs I enjoyed - 8:05 was a highlight for me, and it was interesting to hear the original Naked, If I Want To. I'm very familiar with the Cat Power cover, but I had never heard the original. But mostly this was just okay for me. 3 stars.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nMoby Grape is the 1967 debut album by American rock band Moby Grape. This psychedelic country rock album exploded into pop culture as soon as it was released and has been considered one of the greatest psychedelic masterpieces.

It's full of great songs, solid vocal harmonies, concise guitar solos plus a nice variety of styles. It's hard to pick favourites because it's one great song after another, but stand outs include 'Hey Grandma', 'Omaha', 'Changes' and 'Sitting By A Window'.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI was predisposed against this album simply because it was a total pain in the ass to find and listen to. But I'm glad I took the time to hunt it down because it's great. It's everything I love about the Beatles but with an edge that's all American. It's a perfect 1960s rock album. The harmonies, the guitar tones, the songwriting... it's all so perfect for the time. Even the mixing is iconically 60s with the weird hard-panned drums and guitars. Normally, I'm annoyed by that but this mix is so masterful and balanced that I can't help but admire it. I'll be hunting for this one on vinyl to add to the collection.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nExcellent 1960s album that combines San Franscisco psychedelic rock music with blues, country and power pop so incredibly well.

Every track on this album is inspired by (or possibly was the inspiration for, who knows?) the best music of this era. There's a great variety of music on this album and it all sounds fucking great. You can hear work from The Beatles, The Who, Velvet Underground, CCR, The Stones, and whoever the hell sang \"Radar Love\" (although I have no idea when that song was released). There's no fat on this record. Short, punchy tunes that require every beat. It's such a great listen. I had low expectations for Moby Grape's \"1969\" but this album blew me away.

It reminds me a little of a lot of things, a little rock and roll, a little country-blues vibe, with shades of CCR, CSNY and the Dead. Some of the more high energy songs can get a little ramshackle or rambling, but when they're focused, it's great music. I absolutely love the guitars, which are exceptional, and in league with some of the best in country rock. I also like the all-band/multi-vocal approach, propelled by a strong lead in Peter Lewis.

There are no faults on the album to a fault, and as such it just lacks that touch of character to make it a true classic. Moby Grape possess a reputation among two particular tribes of music snob. Firstly, they appeal to those who wish they were acid causalties in the Summer of Love, as they love the idea of peace and love and especially free love; that last category makes up about 99% of their yearning for the hippy ideal. Secondly, they appeal to your standard Pitchfork reader who will lecture you on how this album is better than Forever Changes, which is better than Fifth Dimension, which is better than Electric Music for the Mind and Body, which is better than Surrealistic Pillow, which is better than The Doors, despite them never having sat down and listened to any of those, all the while living in pitiful terror over the discovery that their favourite film is actually Frozen. So, the album accidentally suffers from the reputation of its advocates being mild cases of douchebag. But why this audience? Well, Moby Grape go down as one of the most legendary lost bands of the 60s, one of the most promising acts crippled by incompetent label bureaucrats, pernicious management, internecine tumults, personal catastrophes and perennial bad luck. Their debut album Moby Grape, therefore, has to be a masterwork to redeem the sorry tale of Moby Grape. And in truth, it's a very good album. It's a very good collection of very good songs. And that's it. My opinion of the album over time is something I find curious. Learning of this album's notoriety, I first tried it about ten years ago, and I was distinctly underwhelmed. It lacked the spark of several of those 60s Californian albums I listed earlier, a few of which I consider masterpieces. Over the last decade, I've given it a few more chances, and I have grown much more of an appreciation for it. But my first reaction, I believe, captured a sad but undeniable truth of this album: it's alright, not great. One can't find a flaw in the playing or the production, but one also can't find a riff or a holler that truly stirs up the blood. It's worth exactly 4 stars, which somehow feels heartbreaking. That said, one offshoot of Moby Grape really does warrant all the accolades: Oar, the sole solo album by deeply troubled bandmember Alexander \"Skip\" Spence. But that's a different album on the list.\n\nüëç\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nan enjoyable listen, albeit definitely an album of its time.
