        "text": "Any fan of American 60s psychedelic music are well-informed about the San Francisco scene. The scene requires acknowledgement in countless ways with it’s long list of very memorable bands and musicians like: Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin and Big Brother and Holding Company, Santana, Sly & The Family Stone and Blue Cheer. Equally as important, but lesser known: Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe & the Fish, Beau Brummels and arguably the most talented group and the subject of this article, Moby Grape.\n\nMany people will argue with me about this, but without a doubt, Moby Grape was easily had the best songwriters and most musically talented group in the San Francisco scene.\n\nThere’s no question regarding the talent of many of the bands, but to really look at the bands for their live performances and album material, few can actually perfect both.\n\nTo a degree Jefferson Airplane did, but their albums, while influential, were also a mess of flubby guitars and sometimes confusing vocal exchanges between Marty Balin and Grace Slick.\n\nGrateful Dead are a very talented group but an acquired taste and even the group admits to not fully understanding the song-writing craft until about 1970, when they opted for a more countrified sound, which fostered more song-writing than long jams on album. Jamming live is one thing and some understand the seeing and hearing ‘experience’ of the performance while others don’t get it at all. I’m in the middle. But this jamming aspect is what is also the most memorable and often polarizing for fans who like to dabble with nostalgia of the summer of love.\n\nMoby Grape was different. They had all the elements that matched the San Francisco scene including great guitar players. Unlike the heavily jam oriented bands in which some guitar players could barely keep time and in some cases play or in other circumstances, could barely play and sing, Moby Grape had incredible guitar players and singers in one confined package.\n\nSo, what exactly set them apart?\n\nFor one thing, the band had three guitar players who all had very different roles: Skip Spence played a hard, abrasive rhythm style that often reached the edge of chaos, but rarely missed a beat. Peter Lewis was a gifted and very talented finger-picking guitar player more influenced by bluegrass than rock & roll, but adding an electric guitar to the sound made Lewis a formidable addition to the band’s sound. Jerry Miller took the role of lead guitar and was easily one of the best lead players in the San Francisco scene. Add Bob Mosely on bass and Don Stevenson on drums and Moby Grape had the best of the best.\n\nThe biggest asset to the band was that every member was a gifted song-writer and singer. They chose only their best songs for their debut and played and sang off each other to near perfection and arguably their debut is just that: near perfection.\n\nMoby Grape should stand on the same alter of popularity and influence as the Dead and Airplane, but they don’t. And never will.\n\nLike so many other bands in the late 60s and early 70s, the band was plagued by awful recording contracts and terrible management. Moby Grape were the perfect line-up with timeless albums and virtually no audience at the time.\n\nGrape’s debut was plagued to fail by an awful marketing technique which Columbia Records opted to release the album via A side, B side singles so the public would collect them all and eventually have the album. This idea died faster than it was conceived and virtually killed the sales of the album. Eventually the LP was released and the reviews deemed the album a masterpiece and charted successfully in the Billboard 200.\n\nFrom this point, there’s a lot of ‘Ifs” to their story. Most importantly, what if the band had folded after the debut, would they have more of an influence? It’s impossible to say. It’s also possible that they would have been even more obscure or worse, completely forgotten.\n\nRegardless, a year after the debut, the band released a double album, Wow/Grape Jam. Technically, it was two different albums released as one. Or more accurately put, one album and one pointless overdrawn studio jam that further proved that the Grape was not a jam band.\n\nWow was a varied mix of different ideas that vastly contrasted the debut’s collection of songs. For one thing, the second album was much more produced and layered than the debut. For better or worse, the band’s layering and addition of orchestral sections pushed the band away from their original sound and promptly placed them in the endless category of bands that tried to create Sgt. Pepper or as critic Robert Christgau called it, “Pepperitis.”\n\nWhile Moby Grape were an exceptionally talented band, they were certainly not Sgt Pepper era Beatles, but one can’t fault their ambitions either, that was the sign of the times musically and it only worked for certain groups and to much lesser degree of success than The Beatles received.\n\nIn retrospect, the band really didn’t need this layered approach, it’s argued that had they left out all the textures and layered orchestral additions, under all of this was a smarter, more complex Moby Grape who had only gotten much better since their debut.\n\nAlbum production aside, the sessions and era of the band was a dark one with Mosley and Spence developing schizophrenia that would case major issues as their lives progressed. Story has it that Spence had met a woman who was into black magic and witchcraft. He often took dangerous amounts of LSD with her and with the mix of his budding mental illness, Spence became increasingly erratic and violent. He allegedly tried to kill drummer Don Stevenson with an axe, producer Dave Rubinson pressed charges and Spence was sent to Bellevue Mental Institution. After Spence was released, he travelled to Nashville to record his solo album, while this was happening, the band eagerly awaited Spence to return to carry on, but he never returned to the group during their recording era.\n\nThe album was a commercial flop and only charted well because of the low price of the double album.\n\nMoby Grape would go on to record more lesser known and equally lesser influential albums until 1971. However, I prefer to leave these albums out of the discussion. My focus here is to look at what happened to the band from the viewpoint of their two most well-known albums and how it affects the musicians and listeners today.\n\nFor one thing, to find the first two Moby Grape albums is not an easy one. You can’t simply go into any record store assuming you’ll find them. It’s more of a crapshoot which could take years, or you can spend a lot of money buying them online. I was lucky that I knew certain people that put the albums aside for me to listen to and buy. The debut is a classic and rightfully so. It’s thirty minutes of perfection, which to the powers that be, Columbia Records and band manager/scam artist Matthew Katz still to this day work diligently to make sure you can’t access their music.\n\nIn 2007, Sundazed Records released their first two albums (as well as their other albums from the 60s) on CD with extensive liner notes and never-before heard bonus tracks further cementing their legacy that even the outtakes were as good as any other band’s main material during the time. For Grape fans it was a goldmine.\n\nThis was the result of thirty years of court battles between Katz and the band. Katz owned the band even down to the name. Neil Young was present during the band’s signing and he cringed when the group agreed to sign literally everything away in the stroke of a pen in 1967. Katz was later accused by the judge of fraudulent practices while managing Moby Grape and Jefferson Airplane.\n\nThe Sundazed reissues were in a way, vindication for all the set-backs, court cases, lawsuits and general defrauding of the band and their royalties. It finally seemed as if Moby Grape was going to get their due and they did…for a few months. Katz informed Sundazed that he filed a new lawsuit forcing the label to remove all formats of the first two album’s reissues. For the second time in the era of CDs, Katz had managed to keep the members from truly experiencing. He released the initial CD versions of the albums on his own label in the 1990s and they quickly fell off because of awful sound production and accusations of profiting off of the only digital access to the Grape’s material at the time.\n\nThe Katz saga is much longer and more stomach turning than the examples above. He repeatedly sold off their name, song-writing rights and spent their royalties for decades.\n\nOver the past few decades, Mosely and Spence’s mental health deteriorated rapidly. Both experienced homelessness and living in institutions. Photographer Jeremy Hogan took photos of a homeless Spence on the streets in the mid 1990s. Mosley left Moby Grape to join the Marines in 1969 and was discharged after his schizophrenia diagnosis. Like Spence, Mosely too was financially destitute by the 1990s. The other members of Moby Grape set up shows to help Mosely get back financially and also access to medications. Mosely has since managed to keep his mental illness from affecting his musical life and continues to play today.\n\nTo conclude, the era of the first two Moby Grape albums and the aftershock continue to plague the band over five decades later. Matthew Katz is astonishingly still alive in 2020, which means the lawsuits still exist. But the members of the band admit that a lot of the issues still confronting them had everything to do with being too young and eager to be rock stars rather than seeing the big picture. As Miller once said, they were looking for a leader for a group that could not lead themselves.\n\nThe legacy of court battles and lawsuits also still persist today. A simple search for Moby Grape on Spotify is a prime example. Their debut album is available with bonus tracks. A large number of the tracks are not available to listen to, while the bonus tracks (likely owned by Sundazed) are. The same goes for Wow. What’s truly tragic is that so many key tracks from the two albums are not available simply for the purposes of listening. A new listener will never fully get the experience of the perfect album that is their debut.\n\nEven their ‘Best Of’ compilations have songs missing or unavailable and even after Katz is gone, it’s unlikely this will change. Moreover, the remaining members are all in their mid 70s and admit at this juncture that it doesn’t matter to them anymore, it was a mistake made over three quarters of their life ago, so to have any changes happen now, means very little.\n\nOne thing that they admit about the mistake is that they weren’t alone. And indeed they were not. This is the story of too many musicians in the era. The difference between Moby Grape and other groups is that Moby Grape are far better than most and even the most mediocre band still at the very least has their albums intact in some way online or on CD or reissue vinyl."
