        "text": "Some people might know that when the label Sundazed tried to reissue the Columbia albums, it was threatened with a lawsuit by former manager Matthew Katz, who is notorious for suing people and throwing what weight he has around.\n\nIt was over the use of the artwork. Previously, a court ruling had gone in favour of Moby Grape, with regards to royalties and name, after the manager had potted the royalties for decades.\n\nIt seems that the move to stop Sundazed from releasing the records, so that Moby Grape stay out of print, was spiteful.\n\nMy query is - in this case it would seem justifiable to re-release the original albums in with new artwork - and in ways that would be some vindication? Is the original artwork essential to a re-release?\n\nI wouldn't blame Sundazed for not wanting the hassle / time / energy. I'd have thought there were enough wealthy peers of Moby Grape still around, that might help out for a good cause.\n\nNot expecting any specific answers, just putting it out there.\n\nThe photo image of the band from the front cover of the first album is being used on Sundazed website, so it looks like that's not part of the 'artwork' ownership.\n\nSo, probably the graphic layout, fonts etc and maybe the logo - I'll see if I can find any info.\n\n* edit Katz doesn't own the name, because in a previous lawsuit, that went in the band's favour.\n\nNew artwork was used for the re releases of the \"It's A Beautiful Day\" San Francisco Sound releases so it is definitely a possibility and been done. The one I have just has a plain black cover. I'm pretty sure Katz had the rights to those as well as Moby Grape."
