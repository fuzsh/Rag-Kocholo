        "text": "Jerry Miller, the guitarist and co-founder of the seminal 1960s rock band Moby Grape, has died at the age of 81.\n\nHis death was confirmed on the Moby Grape Facebook page, though a cause has not been revealed. A text from Miller’s wife, Jo Johnson, was later shared to the group, asking for everyone to “flood the ether with Jerry Miller’s music. Play it all day long for me and him.”\n\nMiller’s musical journey began in the late 1950s, where he performed and recorded with popular dance-rock bands in the Northwest. His early career was marked by his involvement in the production of the hit song I Fought the Law by The Bobby Fuller Four, and his subsequent touring with Fuller’s band. He also frequently collaborated with other legendary musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Larry Coryell, often observing and learning from touring bands in the Seattle area.\n\nIn 1966, Miller co-founded Moby Grape in San Francisco, serving as lead guitarist in a band known for its three-guitarist lineup. The group signed with Columbia Records and released four albums between 1967 and 1969, including their critically acclaimed self-titled debut.\n\nMiller’s collaboration with bandmate Don Stevenson produced some of Moby Grape’s most memorable tracks, including Hey Grandma, 8.05, and Murder In My Heart for The Judge. The band disbanded in 1970, but reunited in 1971, and have played and recorded music with different members since then.\n\nMiller’s exceptional guitar skills has earned him the praise of many of his peers, with Eric Clapton once calling him the “finest guitar player in the world” upon his arrival in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin also cited Miller as a huge influence, having practised Moby Grape songs during the band’s early rehearsals. The musician was previously voted #68 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists.\n\n“His playing was never self-indulgent, and his soloing was propulsive, always aware of where the song was headed,” said the publication.\n\nIn addition to his work with Moby Grape, Miller also fronted the The Jerry Miller Band and has released four solo albums independently, all of which are currently unavailable on streaming platforms."
