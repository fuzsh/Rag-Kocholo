        "text": "MICHELE NORRIS, host:\n\nFrom NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, host:\n\nAnd I'm Melissa Block.\n\nMention the name Moby Grape to a room full of rock critics and you'll hear nothing but praise. But aside from devoted fans and those critics, the group has pretty much faded into obscurity. Moby Grape formed in San Francisco in the 1960s. The reasons for the group's obscurity include bad advice, bad breaks, and bad behavior.\n\nBut there are more reason, and the band's sad story is still unfolding as Paul Conley from member station KXJZ explains.\n\nPAUL CONLEY: Moby Grape is the punchline from an old gag. What's big, purple and swims in the ocean? But the band that influenced groups ranging from Led Zeppelin to The Pretenders was no joke; neither was its 1967 debut.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Omaha\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE (Singing Group): (Singing) Listen, my friends. Listen, my friends. Listen, my friends. Listen, my friends.\n\nMr. DAVID FRICKE (Senior Editor, Rolling Stone): It's one of the few rock and roll albums of any era that you can say that is a perfect debut album.\n\nCONLEY: David Fricke is the senior editor at Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nMr. FRICKE: The songwriting on it is memorable. You take those songs with you wherever you go. The triple guitar orchestration, it's not just power chords, everyone is playing melodies and counter-melodies and rhythms, very funky, also very country, very punk, very surf, and they were all singers.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Ain't No Use\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE: (Singing) Aint' no use of saying that I love you. Ain't no use of saying but I do. Ain't no use of saying that I love 'cause you know that I know that it's true.\n\nCONLEY: Guitarist Peter Lewis says the group's bassist, Bob Mosley, was a great singer.\n\nMr. PETER LEWIS (Guitarist, Moby Grape): Bob was the guy that could have been a star without the rest of us because of his voice. I mean, he could sing like Otis Redding and he looked like Paul McCartney except that he was blond and he played bass better than Paul. So, you know, he was the guy.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Come in the Morning\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE: (Singing) Come on the morning when the sun is shining. Bring me a dream with the sun beams climbing. Above my head, yeah, to light another day for me. Stay wit me now, tomorrow. Come what may. Come what may. Girl, come what may.\n\nCONLEY: The members of Moby Grape labored over their sound. They became legendary for their 12-hour rehearsals.\n\nDrummer Don Stevenson.\n\nMr. DON STEVENSON (Drummer, Moby Grape): We worked hard on getting the harmonies. We'd have rehearsals where all we would do is just sing, then we'd come in and have rehearsals where we would play, and then we'd put it all together and then tear it apart and put it back together again.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"8:05\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE: (Singing) 8:05, but I guess you're leaving soon. I can't go on without you. It's useless to try.\n\nCONLEY: Musicians would drop in to see the band, and soon, so did record company executives. Moby Grape found itself at the center of a bidding war. The musicians signed with Columbia Records which proclaimed them San Francisco's Beatles and spared no expense on their first album.\n\nAgain, Rolling Stone's David Fricke.\n\nMr. FRICK: Columbia really went to town and yet they went to town at precisely the wrong time. That was an ear where hype was suspect.\n\nCONLEY: The label flooded the airwaves with Moby Grape, releasing five singles from the first album simultaneously. The result was that none of the songs made the top 40.\n\nMeanwhile, guitarist Jerry Miller says the musicians were unprepared for all of the attention.\n\nMr. JERRY MILLER (Guitarist, Moby Grape): What we had was five guys just going completely nuts, looking for a leader. We couldn't even lead ourselves.\n\nCONLEY: By the time they got to New York to work on their second album, the band was falling apart and so was one of its guitarists, Skip Spence.\n\nMr. MILLER: Skippy bumped into some people that turned him on to some hard drugs, tell you the truth, that's when things started to unravel because Skippy started to unravel.\n\nCONLEY: In a drug-fueled psychotic episode, Spence attacked drummer Don Stevenson's hotel room door with an ax and ended up in the criminal ward of Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nBassist Bob Mosley also had emotional troubles. He quit the band in 1969 to join the Marines, but was discharged for medical reasons. Mosley was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and wound up homeless.\n\nPeter Lewis remembers trying to persuade him to join a Moby Grape reunion.\n\nMr. LEWIS: We went to find Bob, and there he was, living in this cardboard box. He had these friends - the squirrels and the lizards - and I brought this guitar, it cost me a hundred bucks, and I left that with him and a tape of Moby Grape songs and a tape recorder with batteries. So the next weekend, I came back and the cassette case - he had tried to tear all the tape out of it and then he left it, you know, down there in the bushes. And that's all that was left. Bob was gone.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"It's a Beautiful Day Today\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE: (Singing) Dawn to dawn, a lifetime. The birds sing and days begin. The heavens shine from dawn to dusk with golden rays of sun. People on their way, beginning a brand new day. I love hearing people saying it's a beautiful day today.\n\nCONLEY: Today, Bob Mosley is recovering from his illness. Skipp Spence never did. He died in 1999. But the band had other problems. For the past four decades, their former manager, Matthew Katz, claimed ownership of the Moby Grape name.\n\nPeter Lewis says the claim stems from an agreement drawn up by Katz and delivered by Skipp Spence in 1966.\n\nMr. LEWIS: And he said, Matthew wants us to sign the rights of the name away because he needs them to book Moby Grape, and then I have to ask each one of us. And so we thought, if Skipp says it's okay, he's probably cool, right? And then we signed, and then , of course, everything changed.\n\nCONLEY: Matthew Katz declined to be interviewed for this story. According to court documents, from the late 1960s to the early '90s, Katz sought temporary restraining orders to stop the members of Moby Grape from publicly performing under that name, so the band used pseudonyms. In 1989, they recorded as the Legendary Grape.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Took it All Away\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE (as Legendary Grape): (Singing) Oh, they took it all away. Oh, they took it all away.\n\nCONLEY: Moby Grape's nearly four-year legal battle included eight lawsuits, five appeals, complaints, cross complaints, and stipulated settlements. Finally, in 2005, the musicians won back their rights to their name and started performing again as Moby Grape. This fall, they were poised to reach new audiences when the independent label Sundazed reissued the band's first five albums. But just as they came out, three of their CDs were yanks. Apparently, Matthew Katz issued a cease-and-desist letter, claiming he owns the rights to the album artwork.\n\nDrummer Don Stevenson is now a salesman living in Canada.\n\nMr. STEVENSON: Jerry gets up every day and plays guitar. Peter and Mosley play music; that's what they do for a living. These guys deserve to be able to take advantage of all the music they've played, or at least be able to get credit for it, and, you know, and not have it pulled off the shelves; that's terrible.\n\nCONLEY: For his part, guitarist Peter Lewis likens the fate of the band to that of the cursed crew of Moby Dick and their ill-fated captain.\n\nMr. LEWIS: That's the sad story of what happened to us. We trusted the wrong people. But who hasn't, you know? So, let's not be a bunch of crybabies.\n\nCONLEY: Don Stevenson says it's time to move on.\n\nMr. STEVENSON: You know, you hold on real tight and you let go, you know?\n\nCONLEY: For NPR News, I'm Paul Conley.\n\n(Soundbite of song, \"Ain't That a Shame\")\n\nMOBY GRAPE: (Singing) It's a hard rope(ph) I hold(ph). Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?\n\nNORRIS: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2007 NPR. All rights reserved.
