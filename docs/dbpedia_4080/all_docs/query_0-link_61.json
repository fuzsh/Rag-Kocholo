Bob Mosley's understated vocal makes the ballad It's a Beautiful Day Today one of the great Grape tracks, Peter Lewis stately I Am Not Willing is still a stunner and Trucking Man and Ooh Mama Ooh show that nobody could rock a shuffle like guitarist Jerry Miller and company. Most of '69 was recorded as a quartet, with Skip Spence having just left the band. His parting gift, Seeing, is an alternately tender and tough tab of psychedelia that prefigures his rightly touted solo album, Oar. We now offer it to you on purple vinyl!\n\nFeatures:\n\n Purple Vinyl\n\nSelections:\n\nSide 1:\n\n1. Ooh Mama Ooh\n\n2. Aint That a Shame\n\n3. I Am Not Willing\n\n4.
