        "text": "I'm not so sure about that. You make it sound like Sundazed expected this to be a short-term limited edition. There's no evidence of that. In fact, Sundazed's official statement on the matter said they were surprised the license was pulled. It also said they had to stop selling the CDs on their website immediately because the license was pulled. Not just stop making them, but stop selling them immediately. Since they were caught by surprise it seems reasonable to assume they had stock on hand when the order came down. I'm hardly an expert, but it seems to me that if they had to immediately stop selling the CDs, they also would not be allowed to send the existing stock out to distributors to be sold by third party sellers either. But I could be wrong about that. At any rate this is situation is not analogous to a license simply expiring. When that occurs, you can sell off existing stock. Sundazed was told they had to stop selling immediately.\n\nAgain, we're both just speculating, but I think it's likely that Sundazed had to eat some product, unless they defied the order to stop selling immediately, and shipped stuff out the back door or something.\n\nI would not be surprized if when the license was pulled, Sundazed had to stop selling the CD's/albums immediately from their website, but continued to sell and fulfill third party orders - otherwise the CD's wouldn't have continued to be available through amazon, collector's choice, etc. for so long. But they may indeed have some leftover stock at this point - I can't believe they would have pressed more than, oh, 5,000 copies of the CD and 1,000 of the vinyl? Anyone have any idea what the runs are on other Sundazed releases?\n\nThank you so much for sharing your thoughts on the mastering, Barry. Do you prefer the new \"thick and dark\" sound of the new CDs to the \"thin and bright\" sound of the original CDs, or find them equally unpleasant?\n\nHi 22dRow,\n\nI can say I have a preference for one over the other. Each has things the other lacks.\n\nI certainly have no love of \"thin and bright\" yet the new \"thick and dark\" are frustrating. Only a guess but I suspect they went through tube electronics that either need tweaking, tube biasing, new tubes and biasing or are simply colored this way. (In my view, tubes can be wonderful but I do not think their mere presence in a design necessarily imparts that wonderfulness.)\n\nAs I said, \"only a guess\".\n\nThat said, when I reach for one to listen to, most of the time it is the new one. But I was hoping for better than what these are.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBarry\n\nwww.soundkeeperrecordings.com\n\nwww.barrydiamentaudio.com\n\nI hope you bought it used at least, otherwise you've put some $ in Mr. Katz' pocket.\n\nIt is really an awful package. Sound is not terrible for a needle drop, but who needs to pay for a needle drop? Buy the vinyl and make your own. Plus, the missing tracks and editing are rotten. Huge chunks of most of the Jams are edited out. And the weird thing is, it was unnecessary. If my math is right, you could just barely cram the entire unedited Wow/Grape Jam onto one 80 minute CD. Certainly they didn't need to delete two songs and majorly chop several others.\n\nNope, I bought it new because eventually those things will be gone, probably once Katz kicks the bucket.\n\nI think the reason he edited it is because his needledrops were probably noisy in the missing parts and couldn't be cleaned up to satisfaction. That's the only logical explanation I can come up with.\n\nI agree that it's a terrible package. Again, this was purely for the collection as a curiosity. Is the sound quality of the SFS release of the S/T album a lot worse than the sound quality on Wow/Grape Jam?\n\nI have it, and it does not sound too very different at all to the Sundazed CD re-issue--sounds like the same stereo source mix mastertape to me--for example, the vocals on 8:05 distort in exactly the same places on both versions. Not the greatest sound on either."
