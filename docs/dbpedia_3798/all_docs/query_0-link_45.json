        "text": "Turntable maestros DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist have announced that they will perform a vinyl-only tour in honor of Afrika Bambaataa's hip-hop legacy and influence on the hip-hop genre. The \"Renegades of Rhythm\" tour will kick off this fall, with one caveat: the only records spun will be those pulled from Afrika Bambaataa's prodigious collection (there are 40,000 records currently housed in a permanent archive at Cornell University).\n\nThe tour will feature six turntables enhanced with modern effects and visuals courtesy of longtime DJ Shadow collaborator Ben Stokes. It will begin in Toronto on September 1 and end in Vancouver on October 9. Check out the dates below.\n\nAs for what content the two will be pulling, DJ Shadow remarks in a press release:\n\n“The program will be multifaceted.....Bambaataa as artist, exploring the influence of his classics like ‘Planet Rock; Bambaataa as collector, and the genre-defining breaks he discovered; and Bambaataa as peacemaker and force for social change. He influenced an entire generation worldwide, so we feel a great obligation to get it right.”\n\nAccording to the artists, \"it was pretty clear what he played a lot\" because \"the jackets were beautifully tattered\".\n\nDJ Shadow and Cut Chemist:"
