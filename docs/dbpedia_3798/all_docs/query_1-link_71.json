I thought it was rumoured that LA Rising was happening again this summer, but it never did.\n\nI check into their website every now and then, but... crickets.\n\nI never got a chance to see them. =((\n\nWish i had seen them in '99 (last time they were in philly). Hopefully one day.\n\nThey were my band before PJ was my band. At the tender age of 14, saw them for my first real show. GA...just about died on the rail...\n\n9/3/97 - Minneapolis\n\n8/24/07 - Alpine Valley\n\n8/2/08 - Lollapalooz\n\n9/2/08 - the \"Acapella Show\" at the State Capitol in St. Paul (RNC protest show cancelled)\n\n9/3/08 - Minneapolis RNC show\n\nToday is the 17th anniversary of my first show, 6th of my last.\n\nThe only critique I'd have about them live is they didn't change their sets much from night to night. Call that the PJ effect I guess...\n\nAnybody at the Nassau Long Island show when as soon as the lights went down, shitloads of people started rushing down to the GA? Security tried to stop them but you can't stop 1000 people with about 10 security guards lol. That was insane. Battle of Long Island!"
