        "text": "Planet Rock\n\nAfrika Bambaataa and The Soulsonic Force\n\nRelease Date: September 21, 2017\n\n\"Planet Rock\" is a song by the American hip hop artists Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force. The song was produced by Arthur Baker and released by Tommy Boy Records in 1982. The recording came together after DJ and producer Baker met with Bambaataa and the two bonded over the idea of creating a song about their mutual appreciation for the band Kraftwerk. Baker and Bambaataa had worked together previously on the song \"Jazzy Sensation,\" and decided to compose a more electronic-based version of the hip hop song, as opposed to the more disco-oriented work popular at the time. Along with musician John Robie, the group recorded the single at Intergalactic Studios in New York. Robie duplicated the sound on the record and had Bambaataa's rappers in the Soul Sonic Force rap over it. To create the raps, the lyricist of the group, Emcee G.L.O.B.E., had to develop a style he called \"mc popping\", which involved rapping off time, an unusual style at the time.\n\nThe song was released in 1982 and became popular, eventually earning a Gold record certification in the United States, the first for the group and label. The new musical style on the song later became known as electro. The song features simple lyrics discussing the power of music and having a fun time. After its release, the song began to get airtime on the radio. The use of Kraftwerk's music on the song was done without permission. The band approached the label and Tommy Boy's manager, Tom Silverman, eventually agreed to give Kraftwerk one dollar for every record sold. He increased the price of the single to make a return on the record. Attempts to get a full-length album for Bambaataa were not possible with Tommy Boy initially as Silverman's contract with him was strictly for singles and re-negotiating it proved difficult. \"Planet Rock\" later was released on the album titled Planet Rock: The Album in 1986.\n\nThe song was listed as one of the best singles of 1982 by the NME and was described by Robert Palmer of The New York Times as \"perhaps the most influential black pop record of 1982\", noting its influence on \"both the black pop mainstream and several leading white new-wave rockers\". Several musicians and groups noted how the track influenced them including Run-DMC, 2 Live Crew, A Guy Called Gerald, Fatboy Slim, and Newcleus. The song has been remixed and re-released several times, has been described as one of the definitive electro songs by AllMusic and has been voted the third greatest hip hop song by Rolling Stone.\""
