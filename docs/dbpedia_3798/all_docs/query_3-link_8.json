        "text": "And what kind of music were you playing?\n\nWe was playinâ everything, everything that was funky. Records which was just cominâ out, and the disco music of the time. We would play oldies-but-goodies, lot of the soul and funk songs of the late â60s, early â70s, some rock records.\n\nWho else was playing around the same time?\n\nAt that time, you had Kool DJ D...\n\nHe was down with you, right?\n\nWe was down with him at first. You had Plumbers, Flowers from Brooklyn. You had Maboya from Brooklyn, Pete DJ Jones, this is the disco type DJs of this time.\n\nAnd what was their style?\n\nIt was mainly disco at first, a lot of disco beats, and breaks, and they was rockinâ with the disco style of rappinâ, you know, like you would hear on a radio station DJ.\n\nSo they were rhyming?\n\nIt wasnât really rhyming it was more, âCome on one time, get down baby doll.â Something like Jocko, or Gary Byrd, who was doing his style of rhyming and rapping, with his GB experience on WWIL and WLIB, and you had stuff from the â60s, Murray the K when he used to do his radio station and Cousin Brucie on WABC. Rap was always here, but it was in a different form. Where you got to the heavy rhyminâ and the funk under the hip-hop culture, was after Kool Herc, myself, Flash and all the other pioneers started cominâ outâ¦ Furious Five, Soulsonic Forceâ¦\n\nYou were inspired by these disco DJs whoâd been going a long time?\n\nI was more inspired between Kool DJ D and Kool Herc. The disco DJs I just used to listen to them âcos that was what you listened to on the radio.\n\nSo what were Kool D and Kool Herc doing that was so different?\n\nKool D was the first out of the street gang we was in â the Black Spades â to get a whole component set, what they call a coffin, which had the turntables, the mixer, a little echo chamber and all that stuff in there. And then Kool Herc, comin out with the funky breaks that he brought out.\n\nWhat made you think you could make it?\n\nI had a crazy record collection, more than all of them, so I just decided, I had this vision, I want to make this happen, and incorporate an organization of people into this new thing I was starting, The Zulu Nation.\n\nSo it was at about the same time as you were starting the Zulu Nation?\n\nRight. This is when the street gang era was starting to die out, fade out, and I was trying to transfer people from this other group that I had started â The Organization â to the Zulu Nation. It started in the black and Latino community, and then it started spreading out to the different communities, throughout the tri-state area, and then throughout the United States, and then throughout the world.\n\nWhen you started the Zulu Nation, at first it was a breaking crew.\n\nYeah. It was a B-boy, male and female crew. You had the Zulu Kings and the Zulu Queens, and the Shaka Kings and the Shaka Queens. And they were really tearing shit up. Nobody was really beating them, and they started winning contests and break dance shows throughout the city.\n\nWhich year is this?\n\nThat was â70s â â74, â75, â76, â77.\n\nWhere are your parents from? Are they from the Caribbean?\n\nMy parents are from New York, but my roots is from the Caribbean. From Jamaica and Barbados.\n\nSo were there elements of Jamaican culture in your family?\n\nAlways. Jamaican and Barbados. My family and Hercâs family and Grandmaster Flashâs family.\n\nHow much were you aware of Jamaican sound system culture?\n\nOh, all the time. Iâm one of the first. In fact I am the one in hip-hop who started playing all the Jamaican music in the hip-hop parties. More than Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash. Even though Herc is from the Islands he was focused more on America, on funky stuff.\n\nDid you ever travel to Jamaica when you were a kid?\n\nNah, not as a kid. I travelled there in like the â80s.\n\nDid you ever go to big Jamaican sound system parties in New York?\n\nNo, I just knew of them when we did block parties, and after a while when the Jamaicans started bringing they systems outside. We used to have sound systems up in the Valley Park, up in the Baychester area of the Bronx.\n\nWas that an inspiration, seeing sound systems Jamaican style?\n\nNaw. Iâd say more the inspiration came from the disco DJs and Herc, when he came out. It was more his inspiration, cos he came straight from the islands. Mine was straight from seeing the systems of the disco DJs.\n\nDid you really win a trip to Africa when you were at high school?\n\nYeah, I went to Africa, way before. It was in High School year, it was â75.\n\nHow did that come about?\n\nWell in â74, there was a thing with UNICEF, and people had to write an essay on why they would want to go visit, at that time it was India. So I won the essay to go to India, but when it was time for me to meet the decision staff, I was out giving out flyers for one of my parties I was havinâ. So I missed that trip to India. So the next year was a trip to Africa, so I really bust my ass on the essay for that one and I won that one.\n\nCan you remember what you wrote?\n\nNo, I canât remember. I told them why I need to go to Africa. And then I won and then I went. I went to Africa and Europe. Africa for two weeks and Europe for one week. I was in Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Guinea Bissau.\n\nAnd was that a big inspiration?\n\nThat was a big inspiration, seeing black people controlling their own destiny, seeing them get up and go to their own work. Seeing their own farmers and agricultures, it was very interesting, when you were seeing all the negativity that you were seeing as a young cat in America, and all the stuff just coming out of the â60s with the civil rights and human rights, so it was very inspirational seeing this.\n\nYou played a lot of crazy stuff.\n\nI got into Hugo Montenegro, looking for the Godfather theme, which was a break, and then they had another one, Dick Hyman who did a more electronic type of James Brown groove. Then I got into Gary Numan, couple of other things, and mixing their stuff up with the funk, and James and Sly. It was an interesting mix for our audience. They were bugging out when we got into âCars,â and âMetal,â and you see the audience waits wants to hear the beginning of âMetal,â the synthesizer and the beat just claps and stuff...\n\nHow did they react?\n\nAt first it was a bugged reaction. Certain records that when I played some people were, âWhat the fuck is this?â they stopped, but I keep repeating it, over, I come back with something else, and then come back with that record again.\n\nWhat records took a whileâ¦\n\nI had a record from the Philippines called âEgo Trippinââ with this group called Pleased, and I kept playing just the breakbeat, just to get people going. It used to go, âHey, you, stop, freaking freaking.â And the break keep hitting and the louder you hear it, the funk was hittin,â and then I started playing the whole record after a while. People was gettinâ into that.\n\nYouâd be looking for records all over.\n\nWe would go digginâ in stores and I would take a posse, walk all over from the Village to stores in the Bronx, to stores in Brooklyn and just look for obscure stuff. I just was finding music from all over the place. Then from my travels, cos thatâs when we started travelling to different cities in the tri-state area.\n\nYour records were what gave you the advantage.\n\nWe just was cominâ out with crazy breaks. Like other DJs would play they great records for 15, 20 minutes, we was changing ours every minute or two. I couldnât have no breakbeat go longer than a minute or two. Unless itâs real crazy funky that we just want the crowd to get off.\n\nWho gave you the title âmaster of recordsâ?\n\nI gave my own self that, because I knew no one could mess with me âcos I was a crazy record collector. I had stores like Downstairs Records, if I was playinâ certain records theyâd bootleg it up and sell them $50, $40, $100. Or other people might see me buying a Hare Krishna record and theyâre like âOh, give me five of them.â They was buggin, I told them, âDonât buy that because itâs not what you think it is. Itâs not breakbeats or nothinâ.â And theyâre, âAw, youâre just tryin to keep it secret.â Thinking Iâm fronting on them. And they go home and hear it and they be mad.\n\nDid you ever get acetates pressed up from albums and things?\n\nMany times. I started all that. I learned that from the disco DJs, of getting acetates and plates, made up. I used to make little mix things with the pause of a cassette tape, where you press it and it comes right on cue. Then we make up a mix song.\n\nSo youâd make up mixes ready for the parties?\n\nI did it for parties or for when we having battles. Other DJs used to bug out when they hear me play âPeople get up, get up, clap your hands, get down down-down-down, du du du du,â How the hell he got a record like that? Or I might have a commercial from The Addams Family, have it pressed up.\n\nWhen did you start doing that?\n\nLike â76, â77. Mid-â70s. It was on the breakbeat time of trying to get beats, to out-do the other DJ,\n\nDid you have MCs?\n\nWe had MCs straight from the early parts. Even in our disco era we always had some type of MC. We had about 11 MCs, or 12. Which after that became the Soulsonic Force, the Jazzy Five, the Cosmic Force.\n\nIt was really competitive between you and Herc and Flash.\n\nEach DJ had they own respective crowds, they posse. Herc would have his pack, Flash could have his pack and I could have mine.\n\nAnd was that by area as well?\n\nYeah. Flash in the South Bronx, we was the South East Bronx, and you have Herc in the West Bronx. And then when DJ Breakout came, he had the North Bronx. And AJ. And then when Harlem started getting into it, Treacherous Three and all them.\n\nTell me about the battles. They were pretty civilized mostly?\n\nIt started, you play your system, and I play my system: a bunch of noise going at the same time. You out-louded the next person, and then a member might get mad and go there and knock the turntable or something, and it leads into a rumble. So then we started having it agreed where we play an hour, you play an hour, and this way the audience decides, and it got more peaceful. Because at the early stages it definitely could have led into a lot of beatdowns and killings and fightings.\n\nHerc tells a story of the battle at the PAL in 1977.\n\nYeah, he had a big loud system. We let them do they thing. Then we did our thing. At the battle we funked them up with our music so much that when we left, the whole crowd left with us too. He had a louder system, but when it came to the music they couldnât fuck around.\n\nDJ Breakout had the Sasquatch. DJ Herc and them had the Herculords. After a while we started building our system. Jazzy Jay, he was a wizard at building sets, and him and Superman, and they were building up our system, which we called the Earthquake system.\n\nOne time Grandmaster Flash had this big battle against one of our other brothers at the time, Disco King Mario, and this shouldâve been a movie. It was in James Monroe High School, and Flash came in with this whole nice little wall of speakers, Disco King Mario had nice big speakers that was going this way, but then he sent out for help, so I came with my system, then another guy named DJ Tex came with his system, and we put our stuff together and it looked like a whole big wall of Jericho, and it became a battle with Flashâs people against us and Grand Wizard Theodore.\n\nIt was just going crazy, crazy, and I gave Theodore some of my records to play, but he didnât know them, so I just punched the spot and Theodore hit the spots just tearinâ it up against Flash and them, and then Flash came under the ropes and starts screaming, âI know you gave him your records, I know you gave him your records!â\n\nWhat year was that?\n\nMight have been â76. James Monroe High School.\n\nTalking with other people, it seems the Disco Fever and the Hevalo, the Zulu Nation was very separate from all that.\n\nWe played with Herc there at certain places, but when a lot of them were playinâ in these little clubs, we were playinâ in big centers. Myself and Disco King Mario had big control over the South East Bronx. So we was the first area to play in schools. He was in the Chuck City Crew, but he was part of our family, it was like two crews. I used to play on his system a lot too, before I got my own system. And we had crazy control in our area of the South Bronx, so anyone wanted to come to that area had to come to us first to play in that area or play anywhere in the Bronx River area.\n\nBut you never went to Disco Fever?\n\nNo, Fever never grabbed me. Some people went to the Fever, it was their type of thing. They could be cool, get into the drugs and all that. I wasnât into all that shit.\n\nMost of your parties were in community centers or parks.\n\nParks was only on the outside. Mostly it was in community centers in the beginning and in high school gyms and junior high school gymnasiums. And once we stepped into all the gyms we started bringing all the other DJs in and others started getting chances. âCos people see how much control the Zulu Nation had in their parties.\n\nSo you didnât play in clubs until you went downtown?\n\nI played in clubs. I played in Sparkles, Hevalo, all that, with Herc. I played in some of the little spots that they had.\n\nSo you were pretty tight with Herc.\n\nYeah. When we first came out we had disagreements, and he was like a guardian angel looking over where we go, because he knew we were definitely rising up powerful and had control on our side. And then we became real close and stuff and knew about our West Indian background and we started doing parties together. And Flash crew was also part of our family too. They was the Casanova crew.\n\nThere was the three of you, how did it divide up?\n\nWell, the three of us had our respective areas.\n\nSo it was very geographical.\n\nYeah, Flash was always in the Black Door or in 23 park in the summertime. Herc was in the Hevalo and Cedric Avenue Park. I was always in the Bronx River Center, or in high schools or junior high school gyms in the South East Bronx. So then sometimes we would coincide and give things at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. I had control of the T-Connection uptown, which was a strong spot, and everyone was cominâ there to play. But we respect each other. You could play in your spot, you could play in my spot.\n\nHow come hip-hop stayed in the Bronx for so long without people knowing about it downtown?\n\nBasically because we probably wanted it like that. Then when we started travelling â I believe we were the first to really start travelling to all of Connecticut, and Jersey.\n\nYou always had the ambition to take it worldwide.\n\nYeah, cos I was always a person who just likes to move around. I just had a vision. I said we just got to make this move.\n\nHow did you meet Lady Blue [the promoter behind the famous Roxy nights]?\n\nMet her through Michael Holman, who was one of the first people that brought us to the downtown scene. When we started playing clubs like Negril, and then Lady Blue came in and started doing functions too, at the Negril, with Michael Holman, and then Michael Holman faded out of the scene, they fell out, and Blue was still doing it and we would travel everywhere, into the Negril. Also Fab 5 Freddy brought me down to play clubs like The Jeffersons, the Mudd Clubâ¦\n\nWhat was the very first downtown gig you played?\n\nIt was probably the Jefferson and the Mudd club.\n\nAnd that was for Freddy?\n\nYeah, and the head of the rock pool at the time, I forget his name.\n\nHow did you feel about that, cos itâs a totally different audience. What was the party like?\n\nOh, they were funky, they got loose. They liked the shit I was playing, Ohio Players, Kool and the Gang, Jungle Boogie all that stuff, mixed with the breakbeats and the disco stuff. Once I was getting more into the rock pool and hearing a lot of punk rock records I started playing a lot of their stuff. Flying Lizards and all that other type of things that I might think that would get over there. And thatâs when my following started happening. âI want you at Jefferson.â âI want you at the Mudd Club.â âI want you at Danceteria.â I need you at theâ¦\n\nWhere was Jefferson?\n\nIt was down from the Palladium. It was a big old movie house. And they had these romantic parties upstairs, when they used to come dressing like pirates, looking like Adam Ant. Then you had other scenes where they looked like vampires. It was definitely a weird scene. After a while you started getting used to it and it was on. Then when they started coming up to our places, it was very fun and interesting. Especially when we was shutting up the mouths of the press. The media would be saying, âOh, thereâs gonna be racial fightsâ and all this shit, but then it was just people partying, hanging, taking pictures, cooling out. Lines with black, white all in âem waiting to get in. And we give much props to the punk rockers, âcos they was some of the most fair to just come out and party along with the people, for the music. Like Uncle George Clinton used to say, âOne nation under a groove.â\n\nOnce we started playing downtown, once it started getting towards the late â70s, early â80s you start seeing the white punk rockers started coming to the black and Latino areas to hear the music. They would come to the Bronx. People were scared at first, you know you had the media said, âOh, thereâs gonna be race violence,â which we showed them was a bunch of shit.\n\nAnd at first people was bugginâ, when they first seen them, Blacks and Latinos looked at them like they crazy. They had the spikes and the hair, and the colors and all the different clothing, but then when that music hit, you just see everybody tearing they ass up. And then the punk rockers developed a dance which they used to do, and this became a black and Latino dance called the punk rock. You see the punk rockers learning the black dances and the blacks and Latinos learning the punk rockers dances that they was doing. And then the parties just was killing.\n\nAnd once we started stretching into Negril, Danceteria and then eventually the Roxy, which became the world club. It just blew up from there, punk rock and hip-hop, and got them all to start coming up to the Bronx."
