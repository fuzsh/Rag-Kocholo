You can find a leather jacket, choker, combat boot wearer but also a flower crown, bell bottomed, tye dyed hippie in the same place looking for the same thing. Sometimes those people have more in common than either of them know. That is because music has historical lyrics, political meanings, and emotional support for the people who ask for it or need"
