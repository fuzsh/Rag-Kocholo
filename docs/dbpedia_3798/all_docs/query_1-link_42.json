Photo courtesy of Miguel Senquiz.\n\nA Renegade of Techno Journalism\n\nJournalist, author, friend, and family man, Dan Sicko (1968-2011) only wrote one book but what an important, seminal book it was. Techno Rebels: The Renegades of Electronic Funk, originally released in 1999 (re-released in 2010 by Wayne State Press), made clear that techno music had been created largely by and for Black Detroiters, a fact sometimes lost in discussions of global electronic dance music. This page highlights as well as expands on the DJs, producers, and record labels, that Sicko documented during his career. This collection is a companion collecting area to our work on the Club Heaven Sound System. Another repository for Sicko’s papers is the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library in Ann Arbor. You can explore their collection here.\n\nThis page is a work in progress.

(“Hands Up For Detroit”) in 1999, BoyCatBird was the brainchild of Majesty Crush guitarist, longtime artist and debauched Peanuts fan Michael Segal. According to label owner Sam Valenti IV, these limited edition figurines sculpted by Sara Blakeman brought them into the real world for the first time.
