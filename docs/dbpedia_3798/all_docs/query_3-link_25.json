        "text": "The track I'll be opening my next DJ set with\n\nAnything by James Brown\n\nEvery James Brown cut makes a party get crazy. He's the god of all music. I always play different wild remixes of his songs because people start bugging out when they realise what I'm playing.\n\nThe track that currently gets the most rewinds\n\nAretha Franklin: One Step Ahead (Dr EZ Remix)\n\nI get a lot of requests for this. The way he got Aretha singing over that up-to-date beat is hot as hell.\n\nThe track I wish I'd signed to my label\n\nDJ Icey: Low Down Good Girl\n\nHe invented a style of electro-funk called Florida Breaks. It's some funky electro-funk. Everywhere I play it, people get crazy on it.\n\nThe track that's been unfairly slept on this year\n\nSa-Roc: I Am The I Am\n\nShe's a consciousness rapper who's also very funky. There are a lot of great artists like Sa-Roc but you don't hear them on these no-good radio stations who know jack about real hip-hop.\n\nThe track I'd play at my auntie's wedding\n\nDJ Casper: Cha Cha Slide\n\nIt's like in the old days when everybody used to do the Bus Stop to the Fatback Band. Now they do the Cha Cha Slide. It's a dance that everybody can do in unison, young and old.\n\nThe track that got me out of bed this morning\n\nSly & The Family Stone: Everyday People\n\nIt's a song that just gives you uplift to get up and go and do something.\n\nThe ideal festival track\n\nFatboy Slim: Santa Cruz\n\nThat's always a killer. I played it at Love Parade in front of three million people and they all just went crazy.\n\nThe best track by my favourite new artist\n\nImmortal Technique: The 3rd World\n\nHe's a straight-up conscious, raw rapper who deals with the subject of life.\n\nThe track I'd play to show off my eclectic tastes\n\nFela Kuti: Shakara\n\nWe used to play a lot of Fela Kuti in the early days of hip-hop. In my DJ sets I'll jump off into rock, salsa, African. I like to play some crazy stuff and see the vibrations of the people.\n\nThe track I want played at my funeral\n\nSly & The Family Stone: Stand!\n\nAlong with I'm Black And I'm Proud by James Brown, it's the song that I've based my whole life on. Stand is a song that speaks for the whole planet."
