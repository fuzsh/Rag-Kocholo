Through the lyrics, the band speaks to the idea that change is constant and that there will always be those who challenge the norm. The second verse introduces the idea of the band themselves being "renegades of another creation", using music as a tool for change and communication. The bridge furthers this notion, with the refrain "destroy all nations" serving as a call to action to dismantle systems and beliefs that perpetuate oppression and stifle progress.

The chorus, repeated throughout the song, proclaims the band members as renegades of funk, a genre that typically focuses on the party atmosphere of its music. By subverting the conventional expectations of funk music, they are able to express their unique message and place in the world.

Overall, "Renegades of Funk" is a rallying cry for change and a celebration of those who have stood up against the norm throughout history. It encourages individuals to break free from conformity and to use their voices and creativity to challenge systems and enact change.
