        "text": "Republicans held a militantly hostile attitude towards trade unions & strikes, cemented in 1877 as President Blaine crafted the federal response against the yet largest strike in US history and the first to cross state lines: The Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The strike was backdropped by a severe depression, the end of Reconstruction, and the beginning of the age of corporate cooperation & consolidation. Artisans & craftsmen had been wiped out and pushed into factory work at a lower pay, the working class had less control over their lives and lived in poorly maintained & cramped housing, especially so for railroad workers, who were poorly paid, had no job security, and extremely dangerous work, with improper safety precautions killing tens of thousands every year.\n\nOver 1877, railroads slashed wages by over 50% despite continued profits, and so it began in Martinsburg, West Virginia & Baltimore on the Baltimore & Ohio railroad. July 14th was meant to be the day another wage reduction was enacted, so workers instead struck in protest. At first a modest protest, a wave of walk-offs & work stoppages spread like wild fire from town to town until more than a million workers were on strike by the end of the month. With the widespread antipathy towards railroad corporations given their blame for the depression, what was dubbed the “Great Upheaval” transformed from a rail strike to a broader labor uprising, including wage workers, small shopkeepers, and sympathetic Catholics across classes. Cross-class urban crowds professed a struggle for economic independence and an ideology of labor republicanism while protesting industrial conditions, skirmishing with soldiers, and destroying corporate property [1].\n\nLocal political & cultural networks impacted the extent and success of strike action, while civic responses were most shaped by regional politics, municipal politics, and newspaper media response. In the cities where the strikes quickly fizzled, they were composed of transitory rail workers, had little community support, and were quick to rioting & violence, like in Baltimore & Scranton. In the cities where they were the farthest reaching, they had broad community support and were able to organize general strikes crossing trade or skill, shutting down citywide industry. These general strikes escalated to the point of usurping their local government in the case of St. Louis, Chicago, & Pittsburgh.\n\nThe St. Louis uprising began on July 22nd as 5,000 rail workers halted freight passage through St. Louis, and as the St. Louis branch of the Workingmen's Party of the USA (WPUSA) elected a committee to lead the strike. The St. Louis branch of the WPUSA accounted for 1/5 of total members and they led tens of thousands in rallies ranging from left-wing reform causes like public works to create jobs for the unemployed, an end to child labor, and an 8-hour day, to calls for an end to capitalism & nationalization of major industry. These rallies earned the WPUSA the support of the general public, as they were joined in a general strike by the machinists, coopers, police, natural gas workers, metalworkers, clayworkers, & dockworkers. Cross-racial parades were led by the charismatic Albert Parsons to encourage working men to join the strike, halting all commerce or manufacturing in the city. They held out for weeks against soldiers & a citizen militia conscripted by the sheriff, but were eventually demoralized by the failure of the Chicago & Pittsburgh uprisings & tactically defeated on August 10th [3]. The “St. Louis Commune” was compared to the Paris Commune of six years earlier proudly both its leaders & scornfully by business leaders & the national press. Months after suppression of the strike, St. Louis's civic & business elite founded a club called the Veiled Prophets to parade through the streets and celebrate the defeat of the unions & African-Americans.\n\nWithin days of the Martinsburg strike, Blaine dispatched federal troops to quell it, believing worker strikes to be illegal mobs which should be put down by police or state/federal troops to prevent them from destroying industry or private property. When any riot persisted for more than a day, Blaine underwent a policy of working with local Governors to end them as soon as possible, and focused War Secretary J. Donald Cameron’s attention on coordinating federal troops to quell the strikers. Cameron assigned Major General Winfield Scott Hancock on it, who ended them for good on August 11th and began the bipartisan consensus condemning the strikers for destroying millions in property & inciting class divisions. Ultimately the rail worker wage cuts were kept, but the B&O railroad would introduce pensions, life insurance & limited healthcare in the years to follow.\n\nThe Great Upheaval had broad implications in the history of labor organizing, labor management, and popular attitudes towards socialism & labor unions. Government’s immediate fealty to the railroad bosses set the tone for the next several decades of labor conflict, which would advance exponentially across the 1880s & 1890s, along with anti-communist hysteria among conservatives & financial elites, and laws targeting labor leaders. With the labor movement previously restricted to guilds of “skilled” railroad workers, a broader segment of society would now seek out labor organizations & demand a closer cooperation between those organizations. The unrest also helped shift national politics away from discussions of civil rights & reconstructing the south and towards the economic concerns of capital & labor in the North.\n\nIn 1878 Blaine raised the tariff once more to revive the economy, but it failed, and imposed the 1878 Immigration Quota Act to preserve an Anglo-Saxon majority with strict limits on nationalities. This heavily restricted immigration from Catholic nations, which along with his sectarian rhetoric while advocating the 16th Amendment, further inflamed immigrant discontent [4]. These actions, along with Blaine’s opposition to civil service reform, lost him the support of ex-Liberal Republicans, along with losing immigrants and those hit hardest by the still ongoing depression, the urban working class & small-holding farmers. While urban votes were channeled into political machines and lacked opposition, poor farmers voted en masse for the new Greenback Party as a protest, electing 36 agrarian soft money Representatives across the country, all nominated by the loosely organized Greenback chapters of each state. [5] Democrats won a large majority of 158 seats, with Republicans reduced to just 89 seats. The political wing of the labor movement saw success as well, as Parson’s party expanded nationally & rebranded to the Socialist Labor Party, winning a single seat in St. Louis. The California Workingmen’s Party won 2 of the state’s 4 seats [6] under the leadership of trade unionist demagogue Dennis Kearney, who famously ended every speech with “Whatever happens, the Chinese must go ''. Speaker Randall & a newly Democratic majority Senate were fully opposed to Blaine’s continued agenda and hoped they could put the final nail in the coffin of Reconstruction before his term was up.\n\n1878 Election Results:\n\nHouse of Representatives: 293 seats, 147 needed for majority\n\nDemocratic (led by Samuel Randall): 158 seats (+15), 42.2%​\n\nRepublican (led by James A. Garfield): 89 seats (-61), 36.4%​\n\nGreenback (led by Hendrick Wright): 36 seats (+36), 15.0%​\n\nWorkingmen’s (led by Dennis Kearney): 2 seats (+2), 0.2%​\n\nSocialist Labor (led by Albert Parsons): 1 seats (+1), 2.5%​\n\nIndependents: 7 (+5) seats, 3.3%​\n\n​\n\n1. This strike happened as described in real life, but due to Blaine’s nativism & conservatism compared to Hayes, and no allegation of cheating after the 1876 election, the mostly Democratic working class discontent is further heightened. Heavy implications on labor’s relationship to local & national politics.\n\n2. A mostly-German membership socialist party founded the year earlier, composed of both Lassalleans & Marxists.\n\n3. Something pretty similar but quicker & more tame happened in St. Louis during the actual 1877 rail strike, with Parsons holding rallies with thousands of strikers in attendance.\n\n4. Going to be important later, imagine the consequences of immigration being halved from 1878 through the 1890s.\n\n5. A pretty strong performance, but I feel justified in it with Blaine’s tariff & broader anti-railroad resentment.\n\n6. Albert Parsons wins Missouri’s 3rd, where a Greenbacker won 13% and an SLPer won 7% irl, due to stronger local support & a divided opposition The 2 California Representatives are Clitus Barbour of California’s 1st (who won 44.5% irl and lost to a Republican with 48.4%) and James J. Ayres of California’s 4th (who took 3rd with 27.7% against a Republican with 40.4% and a Democrat with 31.8%).\n\nBy 1880, Randall & the Democrats had succeeded in dismantling reconstruction, repealing the Enforcement Acts against Blaine’s veto and defunding the federal marshals used to enforce remaining voting rights laws. Republicans became totally apathetic towards continuing Reconstruction after these humiliating defeats for Blaine & his party’s main political project. After 1880’s state elections, the three remaining Southern states with Republican governments — Florida, Louisiana, & South Carolina — would be returned to white minority rule by Democrats. The following decade saw a low point in the history of African-American rights with a resurgence in lynchings and the passage of Jim Crow laws restricting suffrage & limiting civil liberties.\n\nThe only Republican victory came when the economy rebounded in spring 1880, a glimmer of hope for the continental liar. In his last year, Blaine attempted to forge Southern coalitions between Republicans, Greenbackers, and the Readjusters [1] via patronage appointments. This had limited success in his time, as these parties & their voters mostly swung Democratic, but sowed the seeds for later Southern Republicans to form coalitions with third parties.\n\nPresident Blaine’s bold action on a stalwart party line had lost his luster and was forced to duke it out for the nomination with Senator John Sherman at the 1880 Republican Convention. Sherman had strategically aligned himself with the support of the liberal middle class “Half-Breed” faction [2] & Westerners, while Blaine had the support of “Stalwarts”, Roscoe Conkling, Ulysses Grant, & Southern Republicans. His continuation of Grant’s economic policies elevated them to the forefront of the campaign. While Republicans were more protectionist, the divergence over tariff policy was more regional than political and Northern Democrats tended to support tariffs as well, so Democratic politicians generally avoided the issue.\n\nAs Samuel Tilden declined to run in 1880, the convention became a contest between blank slate moderate Winfield Hancock & conservative Thomas Bayard. Hancock’s service in the union army made him distinctly lack the Confederate stink lingering on the Democrats and was publicly neutral on currency & tariff policies. Bayard had been a Senator from Delaware since before the Civil War, supported a gold standard, free trade, and supported Southern interests so strongly it harmed his reputation with Northerners. Also nominated were both Senators from Ohio, Allen G. Thurman (currency moderate) & Henry Payne (a Tilden-ally), Thomas Hendricks (inflationist; 1876 VP nominee), & William R. Morrison (free trade conservative; Illinois Representative). On the first ballot, the Democrats settled on Hancock, the “man on horseback” with bipartisan appeal, and for his running-mate, Henry Payne, a serious, timid man from a swing-state who had attempted to forge a bimetallist compromise bill.\n\nAfter their rise in the 1878 elections, the loosely organized Greenbacks & their contradictory coalition tore themselves apart into factions, principally over regional issues, collaboration with Republicans/Democrats, and the extent of their radicalism. The Eastern-Midwestern faction sympathetic to major party collaboration and moderate policy won out, while the Southern-Western-Urban radical faction bolted to form the People’s Party. [3] This faction was organized by Marcus Pomeroy, a popularist Democrat & outspoken copperhead who owned the nation’s largest newspaper. His papers were widely circulated in rural areas due to their criticism of Republicans and espoused anti-monopoly, pro-labor, and virulent racist sentiments. Notable for combining humor with his political demagogism, a quote from his papers was:\n\n“Somebody says we are opposed to negro suffrage. Not a bit of it, if the right be given according to the following terms.\n\nSet the negro to hunting Indians, and for every Indian killed, give the negro a vote.\n\nFor every abolitionist killed by a negro, give him a vote for himself and Dinah, his wife.\n\nFor every abolition preacher killed give the negro, his wife, and all his family, even the dog, a vote.”\n\nPomeroy exemplified the characteristic of Jacksonian democracy to advocate radical democratic principles & the interests of the common man for a believed master race, but tyrannical subjugation for subordinate groups. This was referred to as “Herrenvolk democracy” by sociologist Pierre L. de la Berghe.\n\nThe People’s Party won over 9 out of 36 Greenbacker MCs and the support of Dennis Kearney and his 2 California Workingmen’s MCs. The split was along state lines, with the Greenbackers losing nearly all party organization in the South & West, while these were the sole states contested by the People’s Party, along with a campaign among Northern urban laborers. Pomeroy’s well known Confederate sympathies precluded him from the nomination, instead Maine MC Solon Chase was nominated. Chase was among the most left-wing Greenbackers and was an orchard farmer known for his speech using ‘them steers’ as a metaphor. For his running-mate, Ira Steward of the Eight Hour Day Leagues was nominated. The party tried to forge a coalition between poor farmers & industrial workers, advocating state ownership, unlimited silver coinage, and the death penalty for corrupt politicians.\n\nThe rump Greenback Party nominated James Weaver, a former Republican, skilled orator, & Greenback MC who had gotten a bill to the House floor for unlimited silver coinage which failed but gained notable support. For Weaver’s VP, Absolom West was chosen, a Mississippi anti-monopolist who had been a Tilden elector in 1876. The Weaver campaign used policy advocacy & reformist rhetoric, while Chase spoke of retribution for financiers & bankers in clear terms.\n\nDuring the actual campaign between the major parties, while Blaine had been attempting to bolster his support among rural Republicans, marginal voters drifted heavily to Hancock’s liberalism & honest reputation. Blaine had hoped to win over Irish voters due to his mother's Irish heritage and his administration's support of the Irish National Land League, but this backfired when an Irish activist declared Blaine \"the best friend Irishmen could have as President\", leading to some rural protestant backlash. Hancock swept the election with the support of almost all states outside New England, the Plains & Upper Midwest, a landslide for the Democrats. The House had similarly slanted results for the Democrats, retaining a House majority & expanding Senate control, while the Greenbackers & People’s Party retained regional niches.\n\nAlso notable was the emergence of the Readjusters in the House, an independent party in Virginia promoting fiscal responsibility & federal funding for public education, rhetorically opposed to privilege & wealth. Their platform appealed to both white farmers & African-Americans, they also won the state legislature and elected their leader William Mahone as Senator.\n\n1880 Election Results:\n\nPresidential: 9,179,375 total votes & 369 total Electors\n\nWinfield Hancock / Henry Payne (Democratic): 50.2% (4,608,046 votes), 25 states, & 266 Electors​\n\nJames G. Blaine / John Logan (Republican): 43.6% (4,002,207 votes), 13 states, & 103 Electors​\n\nSolon Chase / Ira Steward (People’s): 3.2% (275,381 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors​\n\nJames Weaver / Absolom West (Greenback): 2.2% (201,946 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors​\n\nAlbert Parsons / Dick Zepp (Socialist Labor): 0.6% (55,076 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors​\n\nWendell Phillips / Simeon B. Chase (Prohibition): 0.2% (18,358 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors​\n\nHouse of Representatives: 293 seats, 147 needed for majority\n\nDemocratic (led by Samuel Randall): 154 seats (-4), 45.8%​\n\nRepublican (led by James A. Garfield): 107 seats (+18), 40.5%​\n\nPeople’s (led by Marcus Pomeroy): 14 seats (+14), 4.3%​\n\nGreenback (led by Hendrick Wright): 11 seats (-24), 5.0%​\n\nReadjuster (led by William Mahone): 3 seats (+3), 0.7%​\n\nSocialist Labor (led by Albert Parsons): 1 seats (=), 2.2%​\n\nIndependents: 3 seats (-4), 1.4%​\n\n​\n\n1. The Readjusters were an irl third party in the 1880s which formed a cross-racial coalition to oppose the planter elites in control of the state Democrats, seeking to readjust public debts, invest in public education. They gained patronage power from the Garfield/Arthur administrations and expanded voting rights, abolished the poll tax, and brought black people into politics, until the victory of white Democrats in 1883 undid all of this.\n\n2. Blaine’s policies are generally more conservative than Hayes’s were. He’s harsher on the strike, opposes civil service reform, is more pro-Reconstruction, more nativist, less assimilationist, & more imperialist. Thus, instead of Blaine gaining the support of Half-Breeds, he gains the support of Roscoe Conkling & becomes a Stalwart leader. Blaine sided with them as a shrewd bid for power in 1880 but was always more conservative than the rest of the Half-Breeds.\n\n3. Something similar happened IOTL, but the two factions reunited during a summer convention & compromised on James Weaver as a candidate. The 1877 rail strikes becoming mini-Paris Communes leads to a more receptive audience to Pomeroy’s radicalism & demagoguery among especially poor farmers & workers.\n\nAs long as there have been workers and bosses, there has been some form of labor organization, strikes, and a portion of the public dedicated to working class interests. As early as the 1630s strikes & boycotts were used as a form of protest, but the American labor movement can be said to truly begin when trade unions were legalized in the 1842 Supreme Court case Commonwealth v. Hunt. It was largely nascent until the 1860s, when the hardship of the Civil War for Northern industrial workers led to a renewed passion for class politics. These first large trade unions were primarily concerned with the new conditions of the Second Industrial Revolution. Technological innovations in rail, manufacturing, and communication resulted in record profits and economic growth. Independent tradesmen & artisan guilds were priced out and their workers put into factories, losing their autonomy, earning less pay, and working in more dangerous conditions. Conditions were even worse in the mines, on the rails, or in metalworks, all booming industries, where tens of thousands died or were maimed with no compensation. In these circumstances workers sought a better deal and the 1880s became a decade of prolonged conflict where labor issues rose to the forefront of politics and strikes increased in growth & number exponentially.\n\nTo briefly describe the political circumstances at the time, in the 19th century the Democratic Party represented the interests of small business & Southerners and had a liberal orientation favoring states rights, while the Republican Party (and the Whigs before them) represented the interests of big business & Northerners and had a conservative orientation favoring federal power. The Republicans gained near total control of the federal government & most state governments after the 1861-1865 Southern Rebellion. They were largely financed by corporate bosses and worked in tandem for conservative economic interests. Rail boomed like never before and was spooled across the nation by booming steel & coal industries. Rail became the centerpiece of a new financial system based on Wall Street, as Republicans sold robber barons cheap federal land for development. The federal judiciary became molded in the 1860s & 1870s by the Republican connections to big business and conservative beliefs regarding free labor & the primacy of common law over the legislature. Republican tariff policy & war spending also increased inflation, driving down wages throughout the 1860s.\n\nWhat this all resulted in was the emergence of class conflict in the US, as these judges repealed most Jackson-era state laws regulating wages, workplace safety standards, or ensuring the right to join a union, citing the “liberty of contract”. The judiciary would remain the most conservative element of the state and the most persistently hostile to labor through the rest of the century.\n\nThe first trade to form national unions were the railroad workers as a clique of their skilled workers formed the railroad brotherhoods, conservative minded organizations whose dues went to workplace insurance. They were led by the \"big four\" which were the locomotive engineers (the nation’s first union), conductors, firemen, & brakemen. Their leader during the 1870s-1890s was P.M. Arthur of the engineers, who was opposed to the strike & held a close relationship with railroad leadership, able to negotiate away wage cuts for skilled railroad workers during the 1870s depression. From this early period, the conservative craft unions faced competition from an industrial unionist labor federation, the National Labor Union (NLU). Founded in 1868 & present at the First International, it was led by William Sylvis of the metal workers, advocating an anti-monopoly political program and seeking to organize the entire American working class. It collapsed after just 4 years due to its leaders death & intransigence from anti-electoral trade unionists at their political activity.\n\nThe previously described 1870s depression was a period of declining membership for all trade unions, as their moment of weakness saw bosses & government crack down on labor groups along with lower wages & higher turnover, which wrecked their finances. The most important trades which emerged from or survived this were in construction, carpentry, cigar making, metalworking, and tailory, which mostly began as regional associations to replace the old artisan guilds. Carpenters & cigar makers at first excluded “unskilled” laborers from their unions, while the metal workers & construction workers were mass membership unions. This divergence reflected a deeper divide in trade union philosophy which cleaved the movement from then on, between the skilled or unskilled, industrial union or craft union, class-conscious or job-conscious, political aims or economic aims, belief or not in financial panacea (fiat currency, free silver, etc.).\n\nThe 1870s depression & Great Upheaval swayed a large portion of the public to form & join trade unions over the late 1870s & early 1880s, and cities like New York, Chicago, & St. Louis sprouted socialist movements with substantial support from local immigrant populations. This sparked class consciousness across America, with middle & upper classes aghast. The upper class pushed anti-union conspiracy laws, anti-immigrant laws, pushed xenophobic & anti-labor articles in their newspapers, empowered police to break strikes, and employed blacklists for union members. An anti-Socialist hysteria took hold of a majority of the public, while the working class sought out unions, especially immigrants, who felt targeted by the federal government.\n\nWithin labor itself, the “sentiment of 77” saw a softening of industrial workers towards goals like international labor cooperation, a national labor federation, industrial unionism, and even socialism. Strikes increased in number through 1878 & 1879 while the existing unions saw new members flood in, especially unskilled workers, who pushed their leaders towards these new radical goals. The Socialist Labor Party even formed their own national union federation in 1878, the International Labor Union, focused on New York & Massachusetts textile workers, chartered by Ira Steward.\n\nThe success of Solon Chase & Ira Steward on the People’s Party ticket in 1880 [1], nearly 300,000 voters for an unabashedly pro-labor & radical candidacy (although in truth many of its voters were farmers), led to immense optimism among union leaders in the potential for a national organization. While it had been called for by certain trades since the NLU fell, these goals were realized in late 1880 as most union leaders signed a petition for a convention to form a single labor federation the next Spring. Distinguishing it from previous federations such as the NLU, it was organized from the bottom-up by the unions themselves, most notably the carpenters, cigar makers, printers, metal workers, construction trades, the Knights of Labor [2], Socialist Labor & the 8-hour leagues, & various smaller unions. Delegates assembled from these groups voted overwhelmingly to unite & form the Industrial & Trade Union Federation (ITUF) of the United States & Canada (ITUF; or more commonly, \"the Federation\" or \"the toughs\"), which sought to unite the trade unions of the entire continent into a single labor federation. The ITUF was organized so that unions within an industry, regardless of skill or craft, elected Trade Assemblies which governed unions in that industry with considerable autonomy (ie the Miner’s Assembly, Construction Workers’ Assembly, etc). Power was further delegated to local branches of the ITUF to serve local interests. The Trade Assemblies elected an Executive Union Council which appointed a General-Secretary to direct the ITUF, with members directly electing delegates to the biannual ITUF convention. [3]\n\nThe ITUF also published a political platform demanding: the legalization of trade unions, a public works program, abolition of child labor & convict labor, the 8-hour day, a federal department of labor, industrial & mine safety laws, employer accident liability laws, compulsory arbitration laws, compulsory education funded by the federal government, support for Irish independence, immigration liberalization, a high protective tariff, and nationalization of rail. The industrial unionists held a majority at the ITUF founding convention and outmaneuvered the craft unionist’s proposals to exclude unskilled workers, condemn strikes, or forbid political action, as well as Socialist proposals demanding the end of capitalism. The three groups found compromise in Samuel Gompers as a neutral General-Secretary, given he had written their industrial unionist constitution while coming from a craft union. They further compromised by condemning anarchism and defeating a proposal to endorse the People’s Party, letting Trade Assemblies & individual unions determine their political alignment. A divide between political neutrality, support for the People’s Party, support for Socialist Labor, or support for the Democrats split the ITUF.\n\n1. Just describing real history until here.\n\n2. In real life, the Knights of Labor were a labor federation which did not discriminate by skill, trade, gender, or race, which 20% of all workers were members of in 1886. It adhered to a producerist ideology and though it sometimes acted like a labor union, it was not, and took many members from unions while focusing on culturally & spiritually uplifting workers. It was not very well funded and local assemblies, holding immense autonomy, ranged from including farmers & the middle class and opposing strikes, to essentially local industrial union federations who coordinated strikes. Their growth at the expense of an independent labor movement caused remaining unions to retreat to conservative pro-management philosophies & the formation of the FOTLU and AFL. When the Knights collapsed out of incompetence in 1886/87, the working class remained disenchanted & unorganized for decades. Here, all of that doesn’t happen, and they’re dissolved in 1881 to join the ITUF, a bottom-up organization of solely the working class which can use the energy channeled into the KoL irl more effectively. They dissolve because they’re hijacked by industrial unionists and one of them succeeds Uriah Stephens instead of Powderly, taking most of their 30,000 members. A rump faction of producerist Knights remain relevant in Pennsylvania until 1886.\n\n3. This exact form of organization was proposed by Samuel Gompers during the early years of the AFL, when he was more radical & leaned towards industrial unionism, and shot down by the craft unions. In a scenario where trade unions have swelled in membership & taken over the Knights, industrial unionists are a majority in the movement and the pragmatic move for the craft unionists is to join forces with them. The existence of the ITUF merges the membership of the FOTLU & Knights of Labor in the 1880s and prevents the conservative craft unions from taking leadership of the labor movement in the late 1880s.\n\nThe most common dividing point for two-semester survey courses and two-volume textbooks covering history is 1880 due to the end of Reconstruction, of Republican dominance, and a symbolic beginning of the Gilded Age. Shepherding this in was Winfield Scott Hancock, a deeply patriotic, conservative, self-made army general, American as they come. Born in Philadelphia, he attended West Point Academy until serving in the Mexican-American War under his namesake, General Winfield Scott. Recognized for his bravery & talent by George McClellan, he steadily rose through the Army bureaucracy in the 1850s by putting down Mormon & Seminole insurrections. During the Civil War, Hancock was promoted to Major General & became one of their most successful & famous officers, famously nicknamed “superb” for his tactics in Williamsburg and single handedly turning the tide in Gettysburg.\n\nAfter the war, Hancock briefly served in the Indian Wars and presided over the massacre of a Cheyenne village, then was put in charge of Reconstruction in the 5th Military District (Texas & Louisiana). Hancock issued General Order 40 and restored civilian rule, ending military efforts to protect black voters, and was praised by President Andrew Johnson & white southerners for it. Hancock spent the rest of his pre-Presidential career in command of the Atlantic division of the Army, an uneventful post aside from the Great Upheaval. He was nominated by some Democrats in 1868 & 1876 and lost. After a disastrous 4 years for Blaine, Democrats hoped a conservative with civic respect like Hancock could win. And he did, becoming the first Democratic President since 1860. He committed his inaugural address to restoring privity of elections, economic recovery, reestablishment of harmony between states, restoration of impartial justice, and impartial & efficient administration of the federal government.\n\nThe infamous corruption & graft of the Grant administration haunted Hancock’s campaign given their shared career backgrounds, so was eager to avoid repeating his mistakes & turned to trusted uncorrupt Democratic leaders for top jobs. Samuel Tilden was made Attorney General, Thomas Bayard made Secretary of State, Daniel Voorhees made Secretary of War, Hancock’s close personal friend Daniel Dougherty made Secretary of Treasury, and the rest were filled out to represent the regions, including the first Southerners in the cabinet since the war. Later in his term, Hancock signed off on the creation of the Department of Agriculture & Secretary of Agriculture. He appointed Norm J. Coleman as the first, who pushed for the Hatch Act & federal investment in land grant agricultural colleges.\n\nPresident — Winfield S. Hancock (Pennsylvania)\n\nVice President — Henry B.

Whitney (New York)\n\nSecretary of the Interior — Lucius Q. Lamar (Mississippi)\n\nSecretary of Agriculture — Norm J. Coleman (Missouri)\n\nWhile President Hancock had pledged to appoint federal patronage in a non-partisan way, retaining competent Republican administrators, outcries from Democratic bosses & politicians became too much for him by 1882, and he relented in appointing their cronies. Hancock spoke out for civil service reform legislation, but it was stalled in the Senate and Hancock or Payne did nothing to save it. Hancock was able to outmaneuver Speaker Randall with a tariff reduction bill, reducing the rate from 47% to 38% and removing tariffs on many crops, only narrowly passing the Senate. The real priority was the legislative end to Reconstruction, achieved first with the most political capital spent. Grant’s Enforcement Acts & Civil Rights Act (which had prohibited discrimination in voter registration, allowed the army or courts to protect voting rights, allowed federal oversight of elections if more than 20k citizens requested it, prosecuted the KKK & other conspiracies against the state, and various other civil & votings rights provisions) were repealed, federal troops were fully withdrawn, and the 15th Amendment went unenforced as ‘Jim Crow’ laws were applied across the South. This had an immediate impact on racial violence, as KKK membership & lynchings drastically increased from 1880 to 1881 [1].\n\nBy 1882, Hancock often boasted of the Democratic Congress’s financial thrift & responsibility through reducing federal expenditures, restoring the surplus. This was mostly through reductions in bureaucratic spending, including some controversial measures like vetoing a waterway internal improvement bill, a pension reduction, and reclaiming 81 million acres of land previously held by railroad grants. In monetary policy, Hancock favored hard money much like Blaine and Grant, but failed to repeal the bimetallist Bland-Allison Bill and had to veto Congress’s inflationary Davis Bill. Minor policies of Hancock’s included an 1881 treaty with China to resolve issues over the Chinese Exclusion Act, easing the restrictions within the Immigration Quota Act on Europeans, and the Edmunds Act to prohibit polygamy.\n\nTo cap off, the 1882 midterm campaign was pretty bad for the Democrats. A recession began that March, mostly a result of lower investment in railroads, and more of a price depression than one of production, as prices & wages contracted while output still grew. The Republican campaign blamed this recession on Hancock’s tariff bill & lower expenditures, helping swing numerous Northern voters who benefitted from the tariff. The Greenback & People’s Party forged alliances with the Readjusters and other anti-Democratic political machines adhering to the Readjusters model of “Mahoneism”, namely the anti-temperance Liberal Party in North Carolina, and independent candidates across the region. In these states, Republicans made alliances with the independents and did not oppose each other’s candidates.\n\nThe resulting Congress saw a preserved Senate majority for the Democrats, but the Republicans & Democrats essentially tied in the House due to the strength of minor parties. The Mahoneists were successful at flipping Virginia and Mississippi and made gains across the region, while the People’s Party lost ground in seats but gained in votes, and the Greenbackers all but collapsed as the People’s Party absorbed their Midwestern support. Garfield and the 149 Republicans were only able to gain the speakership with the support of 11 Southern independents, all in exchange for local patronage.\n\n1882 Election Results:\n\nHouse of Representatives: 325 seats, 163 needed for majority\n\nRepublican (led by James A. Garfield): 151 seats (+44), 43.0%​\n\nDemocratic (led by Samuel Randall): 145 seats (-9), 42.1%​\n\nPeople’s (led by Marcus Pomeroy): 10 seats (-4), 4.8%​\n\nReadjuster (led by William Mahone): 5 seats (+2), 1.2%​\n\nGreenback (led by James Weaver): 3 seats (-8), 2.1%​\n\nIndependents: 11 seats (+8), 6.3%​\n\nIn state politics, in 1881 Kansas became the first party to prohibit alcoholic beverages, indicating the growing support for the temperance movement among religious Republican voters. As well, the 1879 Hepburn Committee of the New York legislature exposed the previously secret extent of the Standard Oil company and railroad corporation’s scheme to give rebates to favorable clients, such as petroleum companies. In response to this & other state’s passing anti-monopoly laws to prevent tax avoidance, the Standard Oil trust formed in 1882 to avoid these laws, circumventing state or federal regulation, with other monopolistic industries doing the same in years to come. Alabama became the first state to pass an antitrust bill, while New Jersey became the first state to legalize trade unions.\n\nIn civic life, P.T. Barnum & James Anthony Bailey’s traveling circus debuted, Booker T. Washington founded the Tuskegee Institute, Wyatt Earp won the Showdown at the OK Corral, and Mark Twain released ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the British war against the Boers War ended in a Boer victory and their war against the Egyptians ended in British victory. Russian Tsar Alexander II was assassinated by revolutionary socialists, Tunisia was annexed by the French, the Congo was annexed by Belgium, Germany became the first government to introduce national health insurance, and the governments of Germany, Austria-Hungary, & Italy signed the Triple Alliance.\n\n1. A similar phenomenon occurred between 1884 and 1885 after Cleveland was elected.\n\nThe only thing to break through the congressional gridlock was the Blair Education Bill, legislation to put primary & secondary schools under the control of Congress via a federal investment of $105 million over ten years to state education systems. This was written by Republican Senator Henry Blair as a measure to further African-American economic success, as barely a generation had passed since slavery, they were mostly illiterate. It gained the support of most white Southerners as well due to also being broadly illiterate (see images below) The bill included a provision to make education aid to states proportional to their literacy rate so that Southern states got 60% of the aid, also specifying that schools receive the same level of aid regardless of whether they were segregated. Hancock came out in favor of the bill and signed it in December 1883, hoping to undercut the Mahoneists & other Southern independents by implementing one of their key demands, failing to see that implementation of public education would only boost Mahone's popularity in Virginia & beyond. [1]\n\n(On the left is a map of illiteracy among African-Americans, and on the right is a map of illiteracy among the general population, as of the 1880 census)\n\nOtherwise, Hancock & his cabinet resorted to executive powers. Bayard canceled Blaine’s Nicaragua Canal project, was conciliatory to Britain in a fishing dispute, and struck down American participation in the Berlin Conference. Hancock himself spent much of 1883-1884 working with Voorhees on his pet project of military reform, including a modernized military organization and expanded coastal fortifications under the Endicott Program. Hancock & Whitney were credited for the rebirth of the US Navy, expanding the fleet while becoming popular among steel workers due to their expensive production. In Indian policy, Hancock vetoed a Republican bill which would have opened 4 million acres for white settlers in Dakota while encouraging a Native land allotment bill so that reservation land could be privately owned and bought by non-Natives.\n\nPublic opinion towards the administration fell in mid-1884 when the nation fell into yet another depression. It was sparked when a highly successful ponzi scheme run by the son of Ulysses Grant went bust, with the banks that had invested in it going under, and investor confidence dropping across Wall Street. In the months to follow, 1 million men became unemployed, 5% of factories & mines shut down permanently, countless more small businesses shut down or wage workers had their pay cut. In response, Congress created the Bureau of Labor to investigate the deeper causes of the recession, which baffled experts as production remained high while prices & wages dropped anyways. The Bureau found that explanations varied heavily based on class. Bankers & merchants blamed financial reasons like the tariff, clergymen blamed social ills, manufacturers blamed new regulation & unions, while workers blamed overproduction, new factory technologies, and low wages. The depression had mostly ended by the time of the election. The throngs of the depression particularly among rail workers pushed tens of thousands to strike in California and the Mississippi Basin states. Jay Gould’s Union Pacific & Missouri Pacific rail lines saw almost 100,000 men join in a strike in March 1884, which Hancock immediately condemned & deployed troops against.The workers were led by Martin Irons to withdraw and form a union, the United Rail Workers (URW). The Governors of Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, & Missouri urged recognition of the union & peace, which Jay Gould begrudgingly agreed, while the URW agreed to not strike for 12 months so they could build up an organization and petition for ITUF membership\n\nAlong with debate over the Blair Bill and financial crisis, the main issues of the campaign were the tariff question & Hancock’s southern policies, with tariff support polarized by region & occupation, and Hancock’s southern policies dividing northerners over a debate on a new Reconstruction. The Republicans also smeared Hancock as a puppet of British interests and ex-Confederates and attempted to make the entire campaign about the tariff, seeking to win over industrial workers. Hancock tried to stay above it all, delivering speeches defending his record & calling back to Jefferson and Jackson.\n\nWinfield Hancock was a classic handsome general/man on horseback, a military figure elected due to perceived competency & public popularity, factors which carried him throughout his first term above his party. Despite rumors of poor health, he was re-nominated with 80% of delegates, as 20% were split between protectionist ex-Speaker Samuel Randall or left-winger Benjamin Butler. His Vice President had been investigated for a corruption scandal in 1883 and stood aside, then replaced by Senator Grover Cleveland, notably conservative, pro-gold, and anti-tariff. They campaigned on a record of successful civil service reform and financial recovery, and advocated lower expenditures, further tariff reform, an interstate commerce bureau, honest money, and funding for schools.\n\nMeanwhile the Republicans faced intense factionalism over civil service. A new conservative faction called “Stalwarts” was split between Alonzo Cornell, J. Warren Keifer, William Windom, & William Allison, winning most of the Midwest, entire South, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Half-Breeds rallied again around John Sherman, while liberal reformer Seth Low took some Northeastern support on his good-government “goo-goo” faction [2]. Sherman & Keifer led for nearly a dozen ballots as various coalitions were attempted. By the 15th ballot, an anti-Sherman coalition had coalesced around Cornell for 3rd place, as he delivered speeches promising a return to whiggery in economic policy. He won on the 16th as Keifer dropped out. Cornell was the son of the man who founded the university, and in his own career was Secretary of State from 1876-1880, then the conservative, pro-machine Governor of New York from 1880-1884. As Governor he vetoed an unprecedented number of appropriation bills, also advancing women’s workplace rights and creating state boards for public health & railroad regulation. The convention choseMinnesota Republican William Windom for his running-mate, a Stalwart himself but popular among all factions for his proposed interstate commerce bureau bill. Their platform advocated a higher tariff, lower expenditure, railroad regulatory bureau, honest money, integration of Western states, an eight hour law, a voting rights bureau, and a federal Department of Education. As Cornell had ties to Grant & Blaine’s corruption scandals and was a known machine politician, many republican goo-goo reformers (including Seth Low) publicly stated their dissatisfaction with him and declared their intent to vote Democratic or independent.\n\nWithin the People’s Party, more moderate agrarian reformers took control of convention & House leadership. They were mostly members of Charles Macune & Milton George’s Farmers Alliances, a loose grouping of cooperative & educational organizations for farmers, operating from an apolitical “business standpoint”. They grew throughout the early 80s to more than 100,000 members, organized from the ground up as a federation of small local chapters, making their agenda & goals highly amorphous and flexible by year and local interest. The movement found immense strength in the South in 1883 & 84 due to the implementation of public education, as the Mahoneists took credit for the Blair Bill & Southern co-operatives grew. To strengthen the national farmers movement, dues were imposed on local Alliance chapters to build statewide organizations, ties were made to the ITUF, and many chapters began to work with the People’s Party or Mahoneists despite the Alliance’s official business plan. William Mahone himself was nominated for President due to the strength of this new faction & newfound Southern delegates. He was an ex-confederate and ex-railroad executive who had built Virginia’s Readjuster Party, a multiracial pro-education liberal party which had toppled the Virginia Democrats since 1881. His campaign promised relief for farmers and small businesses, government ownership of transportation and communication, a lower tariff, direct election of Senators & the President, antitrust laws, an income tax, labor bureaus, free silver, and the abolition of national banks. The promise of a lower tariff and lack of emphasis on labor reforms led to the trade unionist faction feeling marginalized. Some despondent left-wing ITUFers defected to the SLP, whose Marxist faction had beat the Lassaleans and steered towards trade union activity and entryism into the ITUF over electoralism. Within a handful of Southern states, Mahoneist sentiment led to the Republican Party’s support for his campaign, most notably in Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Michigan trade unionist Richard Trevellick was chosen as Mahone’s running-mate to win back the trade unionists.\n\nThe Greenback Party was anemic outside of Iowa & Kansas as farmers abandoned them for apolitical Farmers Alliances or the People’s Party, and they declined to run a candidate, seen as a dissolution of the party. 2 of the Greenback Representatives endorsed Mahone while 1 endorsed Ignatius Donnelly’s Anti-Monopoly Party and their candidate Benjamin ‘Beast’ Butler. Butler had argued & won a pro-Greenback case before the Supreme Court in 1882, parlayed this into the Massachusetts Governorship from 1882-1883, then failed to win the Democratic nomination against Hancock. Butler then took a $25,000 bribe from the Cornell campaign [3] to accept a third party nomination and campaign against Hancock in swing states heavy in Irish Catholics.\n\nIn labor history, 1881-1884 saw steady growth for the ITUF. The incessant depressions of the last decade had made strikes a fact of life. Compared to the rest of American history, strikes from 1873-1894 were more violent, brief, and less successful than usual. The ITUF was cautious of endorsing the many disorganized strikes, and instead focused on consolidation of power in urban areas. They were able to either hijack existing local trade union federations or form new ones, and began to dominate the labor scene in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The Chicago ITUF even held a political convention under the “Industrial Labor Party” for the 1883 Mayoral & City Council elections, achieving 27% of the vote and electing 7/36 councilors. Northeastern trade unionists hijacked the New York branch of the People’s Party and nominated their leaders for office, but the ITUF leadership did not participate in the election outside of New York, with members split between Hancock & Mahone. The ITUF had grown to 150,000 members, and with their newfound strength, a petition passed requiring the Trade Assemblies to vote by the end of 1885 on forming a national labor party to “represent all sections of the trade union movement and members of the industrial working class”.\n\nThe November results showed similar turnout to 1880 with a weakened Democratic ticket, losing Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, and Oregon. Hancock won the election regardless but would have lost it without the support of New York, where unpledged People's Party electors swept pro-tariff industrial workers. Mahone won a staggering 900,000 votes and his home state of Virginia, by far the biggest development of the election. It was not merely Mahone's popularity in the South, though that was a factor, but poor Northern farm & worker opposition to tariff reform bringing in 34 Representatives for the People's Party. The People's Party had built a grassroots alliance which represented a severe challenge to political machines across the country, particularly in the Plains Plains, poor white South, and urban core, where they found the most support in Congress & local office.\n\nAmong minor parties, Butler barely won half a percent and ended his career a few years later with a memoir. The Prohibitionists doubled their share, while the feminist Equal Rights Party won a very modest four thousand votes, with a campaign of lectures funded out of pocket by their nominees. In 1884, the Milwaukee ITUF, People’s Party, greenbackers, anti-monopolists, and socialists united in a convention for the Union Labor Party and got trade unionist Bob Schilling elected to the House from Wisconsin’s 4th district.\n\nNo party gained a House majority as the Democrats and Republicans both lost seats to the People’s Party. Despite winning the Presidency, popular vote, and picking up marginal Republican seats lost in 1882, the Democrats lost House seats overall. This was due to vote splitting by the People’s Party whose strength was among rural Southern whites and Northern immigrants, traditionally Democratic voting blocs. Morrison and key Democrats worked out a confidence deal to support Garfield’s continued speakership, blocking out potential compromise with the People’s Party. The People’s Party’s growth to 34 seats was built on Mahoneism and support for public education in the rural South, where more than 2/3 of their seats were from. Their massive growth precipitated a period of massive infighting over the party’s future, goals, & strategy between its rural & trade unionist constituencies and the various ideological goals of its local factions.\n\n1884 Election Results:\n\nPresidential: 10,524,875 total votes & 401 total Electors\n\nWinfield Hancock / Henry Payne (Democratic): 46.2% (4,862,492 votes), 20 states, & 219 Electors\n\nAlonzo Cornell / William Windom (Republican): 44.0% (4,630,945 votes), 17 states, & 182 Electors\n\nWilliam Mahone / Richard Trevellick (People’s): 8.7% (915,664 votes), 1 state, & 12 Electors\n\nBenjamin Butler / Edward Allis (Anti-Monopoly): 0.5% (58,144 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors\n\nJohn Russell / Neal Dow (Prohibition): 0.5% (50,519 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors\n\nBelva Lockwood / Clara Foltz (Equal Rights): <0.1% (4,208 votes), 0 states, & 0 Electors\n\nLegislative: 325 seats, 163 needed for majority\n\nRepublican (led by James A.

Garfield and Half-Breed Republicans pushed heavily for a civil service reform bill which passed near unanimously, with the amount of federal employees held to a merit system increasing from 10% to 30% over 1885-1889. Garfield also pushed for the 1885-86 Enabling Acts to grant statehood to the Western territories of Dakota, Washington, and Montana, while the land of the Idaho Territory was split between Washington & Montana. The status for the other territories was as follows:\n\nAlaska: Considered too small in population & far away for statehood.\n\nArizona: Considered too small in population & too Mexican for statehood.\n\nDistrict of Columbia: Not considered, but Republicans pushed for an amendment granting the capital a single Elector, Representative, and Senator.\n\nNew Mexico: Considered too Mexican for statehood.\n\nOklahoma: Largely unpopulated except Native population with land runs blocked by the federal government, not considered for statehood.\n\nUtah: Long-denied suffrage due to intolerance of Mormons, but viable for statehood.\n\nWyoming: Viable for statehood, blocked by Democrats.\n\nHancock got to appoint three Supreme Court justices, Augustus Garland in 1881 (who served until 1898), Josiah G. Abbott in 1882 (who served until 1890), & William E. Niblack in 1885 (who served until 1891). He also presided over the War for the Pacific in South America, where the Bolivian-Peruvian alliance was victorious over Chile, allowing Bolivia to keep their port and both countries to keep their resource rich territory in the Atacama Desert.\n\nA Republican Senate killed attempts at tariff reform, delaying that debate while the issue of the railroads became the primary debate of 1885. The URW spent the 12 months which they agreed not to strike canvassing for new members in the Southwest (at the time a region that meant (at this time meaning Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and South Illinois), both unorganized and members of the existing big four rail unions. The depression and no strike agreement were over by March 1885, but in April 1885 the arbitrary firing of several union employees led the URW to declare a regional strike against all Jay Gould rail lines, with 220,000 men joining in and halting 12% of US rail. Jay Gould petitioned for federal troops to arrest strike leaders, for courts to prosecute & imprison all ITUF leaders, and stubbornly refused negotiation despite pressure from state Governors. Most citizens in the affected states sympathized with the strikers, and antipathy for rail barons became totally channeled towards Gould, who became so hated that mass unrest & rioting took hold over the striking towns. Missouri mobilized their national guard in response, while Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, and Illinois’s Governors continued to urge negotiation to prevent a general strike. Eventually Texas Governor John Ireland, who favored rail reform, was able to get Irons & the URW to stand down in exchange for comprehensive rail regulation, including a workplace safety clause. Rail workers found this an acceptable victory and stopped the strike after less than 2 months. This was a boon to URW membership nationwide, soon becoming ITUF’s largest & most influential union.\n\nTo accommodate anti-railroad public opinion & prevent strikes within their states, the legislatures of most rural states created Departments of Commerce which could regulate unfair practices by railroad companies. The Supreme Court justices attempted to invalidate the regulatory power of the states over transport and interstate commerce in the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois case, but Hancock-appointed justices rejected it. [1] Varying by state, they either gave state legislatures the power to set rates on rails in their state or set a maximum rate, required transparency for all railroad rates, protected against price discrimination for smaller markets, and sometimes even workplace safety measures & means of state enforcement. An effort to create a federal Department of Commerce to regulate interstate transportation became a rallying cry for the People’s Party, but it was repeatedly rejected in the House.\n\nAlso partially a response to the success of the Southwest Rail Strike, the ITUF’s Trade Assemblies overwhelmingly voted to endorse independent political activity on the local, state, & federal level, requiring ITUF unions to endorse their candidates. A founding convention was planned for January 1886 to outline the party’s structure & platform, with invitations sent to the smaller trade unions, urban People’s Party chapters, Socialist Labor Party [2], Anti-Monopoly Party, Single Tax & Eight-Hour Leaguers, and various smaller left-wing newspapers & groups. The effort was endorsed by ITUF-aligned politicians, elected as independents or from the People’s Party, who became high-profile advocates for the new party.\n\nAfter a productive year, Hancock unexpectedly died in November 1885 of an infection complicated by his diabetes. The new President was more doctrinaire conservative VP Grover Cleveland inaugurated as President, a man known for personal integrity, who would only face more issues with labor.\n\n1. The 1886 Supreme Court Case Wabash, St. Louis, & Pacific Railway vs Illinois, which overturned the 1877 case Munn vs Illinois, never happens here. The case declared a state could not regulate interstate commerce within its borders and annulled the power of state legislatures over trusts, railroads, holding companies, & corporations, which the Supreme Court also did not allow the federal government to have meaningful power over. This vacuum of power led to the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was incredibly limited in scope. The Munn vs Illinois precedent is upheld and state governments have the power to regulate industries “in the public good”, which they were fairly willing to do in this period, and room for the federal government to do the same. Changes the entire Lochner era.\n\n2. The Socialist Labor Party of OTL, enjoys a longer period of success as the PP has a mostly rural appeal. The Anarchist movement is weakened because of far fewer Germans coming in due to the Immigration Quota, so the SLP is more doctrinaire Marxist and retains a stronger appeal to Germans.\n\nA biographer of his once said \"Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that five years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States\". Grover had avoided 1862 conscription to the Southern Rebellion by hiring a polish man to go in his place. Instead he read law, lived in an austere apartment, and sent his money back to his poor widowed mother & several sisters. After the war he was sheriff of Buffalo, notable later as this was when the affair/rape of Maria Halpin took place. Despite Buffalo being a Republican city, Grover got elected as their reform-minded Mayor in 1881 and caught the attention of the Democratic machine. Despite his obscurity, only a year later he was elected Senator as a compromise in a split legislature [1], passionately defending the Hancock administration as a darling of liberal circles. Two years later, with Hancock in failing health, he was brought in as VP to win New York and on the assumption he would lead with similar judgment. In his inaugural address he extolled heavy praise for Hancock and his record, promising to go further on the principles of good government, states rights, and individual liberty, then assembled a new cabinet.\n\nPresident — Grover Cleveland (Pennsylvania)​\n\nVice President — Vacant​\n\nSecretary of State — Thomas Bayard (Delaware)​\n\nSecretary of the Treasury — William R. Morrison (Illinois)​\n\nSecretary of War — William Rosecrans (Ohio)​\n\nAttorney General — Daniel Lockwood (New York)​\n\nPostmaster General — Donald M. Dickinson (Michigan)​\n\nSecretary of the Navy — Matthew Butler (South Carolina)​\n\nSecretary of the Interior — William Vilas (Wisconsin)​\n\nSecretary of Agriculture — Norm J. Coleman (Missouri)​\n\nCleveland called Congress back into session and called on them to repeal the Bland-Allison silver bill, to expand the merit system in the civil service, and further reduce the tariff. All of these were rejected by Congress, mostly in the Senate, where cross-party coalitions for soft money, corruption, and protectionism held strong. His landmark achievement was the Sherman Antitrust Bill, which prohibited anti-competitive behavior and monopolies via the Department of Justice, largely unenforceable but politically popular. His most infamous veto was the 1887 Texas Seed Bill, which would have granted $300,000 in relief to Southwestern farmers undergoing a drought. He justified this with his belief in limited government and that the bill was unconstitutional, wasteful graft, vetoing a veteran’s pension bill with similar justifications, something Hancock had avoided doing as a matter of pragmatism. Cleveland also presided over the surrender of Geronimo and the Apache, one of the last of the 40 wars against Native American tribes undertaken by the federal government. Otherwise he spent 1886-1888 unable to govern effectively except through veto, and used the Presidency as a bully pulpit to advocate against corruption & the tariff.\n\nThe Trade Assemblies overwhelmingly voted to form a political party at the “Labor Unity Convention” in Chicago. It was headlined by cigar makers' leader Samuel Gompers, typographists’ leader William H. Foster, carpenters’ leader Peter J. McGuire, left-wing journalist & intellectual Henry George, congressmen Robert Schilling & Patrick McLogan, steelworkers’ leader William Weihe, machinists’ leader Terrence Powderly, Socialist Labor Party’s chairman Wilhelm Rosenberg [2], and previous federal candidates Solon Chase, Ira Steward, and Richard Trevellick. After a day of speeches & debate over policy, the delegates voted unanimously to form the Labor Party of the United States, draft a party constitution, policy platform, and to field candidates for in federal, state, & local elections.\n\nUnlike any contemporary American party, Labor was centralized, not federalized, had internal party democracy, membership dues, and an elected leader in states where the party had more than 10,000 members. Labor also forbade its politicians from working with Democrats or Republicans, but encouraged friendship with the People’s Party and other minor parties aligned with union goals. A convention would be held before every national election with delegates elected equally by paid members & the participant trade unions. These conventions nominated candidates, determined the political platform, and strategic goals, and could alter the party constitution. Their platform was similar to the ITUF’s and was committed to: nationalization of rail & communication, legalizing trade unions, municipal ownership of utilities, abolishing child labor & convict labor, an income tax, popular election for Senators and the President, secret ballot, eliminating national banks, an eight-hour day, workplace safety standards, state health insurance, compulsory arbitration laws, and a high tariff.\n\nThe main goals of Labor were the eight hour day & government ownership of rail, with the May 1st 1886 general strike having been planned two years earlier by the ITUF as a show of public support for the policy, especially among urban manufacturing workers. The May 1st strike drew support not only from the ITUF & the smaller craft unions, but also among the socialist & anarchist movements which had grown during the economic slowdown of 1882-1886. In Chicago, where anarchism was especially strong, it was concentrated around the activism of Albert Parsons & his IWPA and August Spies & his Arbeiter-Zeitung (Workers’ Newspaper). Many anarchists were part of armed revolutionary groups, often using explosives to target property and police, hoping it would inspire workers to start a spontaneous revolution. On the day of May 1st, estimates range from 400k to 600k who took to the streets to attend rallies and protests by Labor. Having been coordinated years ago, the protests were largely non-violent until May 3rd when an argument between strikebreakers and protestors in Chicago (where 10% of the city was on strike) led to the police intervening and killing two workers. August Spies organized a rally with other anarchist leaders at Haymarket Square (a bustling intersection in the commercial district), and joined by a few thousand strikers and the Mayor, condemned the police violence while calling for socialism. While Fileden was wrapping up his speech, the police dispersed the meeting and a fight broke out. Then an anarchist threw a bomb at the police, killing officer Mathias Degan. The police then opened fire on the protestors, who retaliated with guns of their own, all emptying their revolvers in the chaos. Within 5 minutes, the square was empty except for the bodies and the stage, with four workers dead, seven policemen dead, and hundreds wounded.\n\nThe following days, weeks, and months saw a crackdown on all union activity, raids on the homes of Anarchists, a national “Red Scare”, and an end to the strike and restoration of traditional workdays were restored of ten or more hours a day. The May 1st strike was especially successful in Milwaukee, shutting down all businesses as 14,000 went on strike, with only the metal workers at the Bay View rolling mill still at work. When the strikers went to Bay View, they were met with 250 national guardsmen, and a miscommunicated order led to the soldiers firing on the crowd and killing 7, including a 13 year old boy, in what is now known as the Bay View Tragedy.\n\nIn Chicago there was an outpouring of civic and business support for the police, while police sought revenge for 2 months by ignoring warrants to ransack union halls and investigate any prominent labor figure or labor-supporting newspaper. The public blamed anarchists for the “riot” while property owners, shopkeepers, the press, and politicians developed a consensus that suppression of anarchism was necessary for the stability of society. State legislatures began to pass laws restricting the rights of labor unions and industrialists began to sow racial divisions by importing Southern Black & foreign-born Asian laborers to undercut strikes. The ITUF distanced itself from the anarchist movement and repudiated violent action as harmful to the movement, while most strikers formed conspiracies and blamed Pinkertons staging the riot to harm labor’s reputation.\n\nEight of Chicago’s anarchist leaders, including Spies, Parsons, and Fielden, were arrested and put on trial. The trial went on until August and, after an essentially open bias by the judge, bailiff, and police against the defendants, they were all found guilty, with 7 out of 8 sentenced to death. One of the suspects sentenced to death, George Engel, had been playing cards at home during the entire affair, but was executed for the crime of being a revolutionary socialist. The sentencing provoked outrage from workers and their supporters, especially internationally where the story was a sensation, and the Haymarket defendants became martyrs for socialism. Portrayals of the anarchists, 6/8 of whom were German, as violent foreign agitators inspired fear among the protestant, small town-majority public and a widespread resentment of immigrants. The case was appealed through 1887 but in November, four of the defendants (Parsons, Engel, Fischer, & Spies) were hung at the gallows and died slowly after singing La Marseillaise. [3]\n\nThe events of Haymarket and all the repression and backlash from the business class only united wage earners on the side of labor & hardened their resistance [4]. Later in 1886, the Chicago meatpacking industry went on strike and 30,000 immigrant workers halted production, formed a union (the Brotherhood of Meatpackers & Butchers (BMB)), won recognition, and won a wage increase [4]. The coal industry, previously divided into several competing unions, united behind John McBride’s American Mining Workers Association (AMWA) with help from ITUF organizers. Within 6 months, the AMWA constituted 30,000 members, compared to 56,000 total coal miners, and negotiated with the mine owners reform of the scaling system to pay fairer wages. These three unions contributed significantly to ITF membership which ballooned to 700,000 by the end of the year [5].\n\nIn Nov. 1886, House & local saw a wipeout for the Democrats. The Republicans capitalized on Northeastern & Midwestern opposition to Cleveland’s tariff policy and won a House majority, the first time any party had done so since 1880, and the first time the Republicans had done so since 1872. The People’s Party declined in seats, especially in the South, where their members flocked back to the Democrats. This was equally due to voter suppression laws for African-Americans & poor whites, rebounding crop prices, and abandonment of PP memberships for the non-partisan Farmers’ Alliances. People’s Party voters drifted back to the Democrats during 1884-1888, as the currency issue was not yet prominent, and they were aligned with rural Democrats over trade, rail, and education policies. These same factors finally defeated the Readjusters after 6 years in power. The Mahoneists left a legacy of readjusting Virginia’s debt, continuing Reconstruction in that state, and playing a key part in federal guaranteed public education, all while lacking patronage power. The defeat of the Readjusters was a warning sign for the broader Southern independent movement, as states across the region began to pass highly restrictive ‘Jim Crow’ laws to reverse the gains made for African-Americans during Reconstruction and enshrine Democratic Party rule.\n\nThe real headline, however, was the surge in support for Labor, who won 12/40 of their contested House races, won more than a hundred city councilors, and the mayorships of 4 out of 10 of the nation’s largest cities (New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston; Henry George, Robert S. Nelson, Tomas Philips, and George E. McNeill). The establishment repression of unions & working class leaders led to the ITUF and the conservative anti-strike labor bodies, the socialists, the anarchists, the single taxers, the left-wing middle class, the native-born and the foreign-born worker, the Germans, Bohemians, Poles, Scandinavians, and Jews all joining together behind them. The ITUF’s focus on canvassing big cities for the past 5 years paid dividends, with swelling membership among ITUF locals able to defeat the entrenched political machines through sheer popular will. Among their congressmen were:\n\n- Thomas J. Morgan in Illinois, a rail worker & Socialist who was boss of the Chicago ITUF scene\n\n- John Swinton in New York, a labor journalist who successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Alien Contract Labor Act\n\n- Terrence Powderly in Pennsylvania, who led the machinist’s union and adhered to producerism [5]\n\n- Daniel Cronin in Washington, who led the anti-Chinese Seattle riots earlier that year, expelling the Chinese workers who made up 10% of the population\n\nVictory for Labor in New York was of special importance as a nominal socialist had won the nation's largest city and beaten the uniquely powerful Tammany Hall. Their candidate, Henry George, had become famous for the essay “Progress & Poverty” which advocated for a tax on the value of land, and was widely praised as some of the most brilliant writing of the century. He was reminiscent of the middle class intellectual leadership of similar European social democratic/trade union movements, able to reach a wider audience, like William Liebknecht, Ferdinand Lassalle, or the Fabian Society. As a public intellectual, George had also advocated in his essays for for government ownership of natural monopolies (such as utilities (water, electricity, sewage), communications, and forms of transportation), against intellectual property rights, for free trade, the secret ballot, a universal basic income, a disability system, old age pensions, and women’s suffrage. He was immensely respected in educational & intellectual circles as well as now one of the labor movement's most prominent supporters.\n\n1886 Election Results:\n\nLegislative: 330 seats, 166 needed for majority. 8,712,390 total votes.\n\nRepublican (led by James A. Garfield): 172 seats (+26), 44.6%​\n\nDemocratic (led by John G. Carlisle): 124 seats (-10), 42.1%​\n\nPeople’s (led by Charles Cunningham): 16 seats (-18), 6.1%​\n\nLabor (led by Terrence Powderly): 11 seat (+10), 4.3%​\n\nReadjuster (led by William Mahone): 4 seats (-2), 1.2%​\n\nIndependents: 3 seats (-1), 1.7%​\n\n​\n\n1. He was replacing Thomas Platt, who resigned due to a corruption investigation prompted by Hancock & the Attorney General. Conkling himself survives the investigation and is key in Cornell becoming the candidate in 1884.\n\n2. Rosenberg was the Chair of the SLP from 1884-1889 irl, and was on the Lasallian wing who focused on electoralism over unionism, and supported Henry George & the irl movement for a Labor Party in 1886. In real life, he was removed by Sergei Shevitch and his Marxist allies in New York City, then Rosenberg refused to step down for months and split the party, then conceded anyway, and then splintered to found the “Social Democratic Federation”, which eventually merged into Deb’s SDP. Here, he obviously just supports Labor, and Shevitch and the Marxists tepidly support it as well, for now…\n\n3. Stuck to just describing real history, I don’t think the altered labor history of this timeline would really change the events at Haymarket, which I also thought were too important to change. The figure for actual participants was closer to 300k-500k.\n\n4. This is true, the Knights doubled their membership in the aftermath of Haymarket and Fall 1886 saw the trade unions & socialists in most industrial cities form local labor parties, many electing politicians. The United Labor Party of Henry George got 31% and 2nd place, the Union Labor Party nominated Alson Sreeter (former chair of the anti-monopolists) got 1.3% of the vote for President in 1888, Chicago & Milwaukee’s labor parties had genuine success at the local level for several years, Milwaukee’s in particular set the stage for Bergerism & elected a Representative. They collapsed and fell back into the Democrats after 1888 as they lacked a backing organization & were created in the backdrop of Knights of Labor / AFL infighting.\n\n5. The two were real strikes that the Knights of Labor participated in but called off early due to their ideological opposition to strikes, but which historians estimate they could have won. The third is an acceleration of labor history in the coal fields, where John McBride formed the United Mine Workers of America a few years later with more inter-union rivalries.\n\n6. Producerism was a sort of ideology which believed society should be centered around the productive forces of society (i.e. workers, artisans, small business owners, small farmers) and that society was currently controlled by unproductive elites.
