        "text": "Throughout U.S. history, the two major political parties have switched positions many times on a variety of issues, including how powerful the national government should be and how much it should regulate and guide the American economy. Are these changes simply the product of historical contingency, or are there structural factors at work that can help explain these developments? This article finds that change in party control of government can help explain change in party ideologies with respect to economic policy. Parties in long-term control of unified government tend to develop their ideology in ways that call for a stronger national government and more economic intervention, while parties in opposition tend to change their ideology in ways that call for less national government power and less economic intervention.\n\n47. It should be noted here that if we think of party control of government simply as party control of the White House, then it would seem that there are more instances of change in long-term control of government than I identify in the following sections. However, we have good reasons for believing that unified control of government is substantively different from control of the presidency when thinking about party theories of governance and party theories of economic intervention. When a party controls the presidency but not Congress, the party is severely limited in what economic interventions it can pursue. Thus, it has less of an incentive to change its theory of governance to call for a stronger national government (which includes congressional houses controlled by the opposition) and less of an incentive to change its theory of economic intervention (because it has fewer economic interventions to justify). When a party controls the presidency, but not Congress, for a long period of time, then we would expect changes in party theories of governance with respect to executive power and changes in party theories of intervention with respect to foreign policy. See Lewis, Verlan, “The President and the Parties’ Ideologies: Party Ideas about Foreign Policy since 1900,” Presidential Studies Quarterly 47, no. 1 (2017)CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n49. It is true that choosing eight years as the period of time is a subjective decision, and other analysts might have chosen a different period of time—maybe six years or ten years. However, eight years is a reasonable choice, and choosing a standard period of time allows us to examine American history for instances of change in long-term party control in a consistent fashion. The following analysis shows that the findings hold whether the standard chosen is six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years.\n\n55. Progressive historians, seeking to explain American party ideologies, focused on the economic class system in America, and how the parties drew their support from different classes (Turner, “Social Forces in American History”; Beard, The American Party Battle; Binkley, Wilfred, American Political Parties: Their Natural History [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1943]Google Scholar). For political scientists and historians focused on class analysis, it was clear that American party history had been defined by the division between capitalists (Hamiltonian Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans) and agrarians (Jeffersonian Republicans and Democrats). The different economic interests of these classes drove the different ideologies of their political parties. This socioeconomic class analysis is useful for explaining nineteenth-century American party history but less useful for explaining the twentieth century. During the New Deal, the Democratic Party became a coalition of Southern rural agriculture and Northern urban labor. In the postwar era, the Democratic Party has become a coalition of city dwellers, while the Republican Party has become a coalition of those who live in suburban and rural areas. Nevertheless, economic class interests help explain the ideologies of the Federalist and Republican Parties in the 1790s.\n\n72. By changing their party's ideology after taking power, the Republicans represented the first such change in American party history, but they were following a pattern that had been established even earlier. Notably, the Republicans resembled the Whigs of eighteenth-century British politics. When Whig Party ideology began to change after taking control of Parliament, the party split between the main body of the party and a dissenting faction known as “Old Whigs,” who wished to maintain the original principles of the party. Similarly, when Republican Party ideology began to change in the 1800s after taking control of unified government, the party split between the main body of the party and a dissenting faction known as “Old Republicans,” who wished to maintain the party's original principles. Banning, Lance, The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), 283Google Scholar.\n\n77. This analysis helps reconcile two contending camps of historians that argue over whether or not the election of 1800 was really a “revolution” as Jefferson claimed (Skowronek, The Politics Presidents Make). In this framework, the election of 1800 really was a revolution because it represented a change in long-term party control of government, and the new party had distinct theories of governance, economic intervention, and ends. At the same time, it was not a revolution because the party's theories of governance and economic intervention evolved over time to justify the Federalist policies that the Republicans eventually adopted.\n\n133. It is worth noting here that Republican Party language and ideology during the Hoover administration belies the myth that GOP ideology during this time was committed to laissez-faire economic policy. The anti-interventionist language and ideology articulated by Republicans, including Hoover, after the New Deal has caused some scholars to mistakenly assume that Hoover and the Republicans also advocated for less economic intervention before the New Deal. Some scholars point to the title of a book written by Hoover in 1922 (American Individualism)—which contained ideas that Hoover repeated in the 1928 and 1932 presidential campaigns—as evidence that Hoover articulated “neoliberalism,” “neoconservatism,” and “modern Republicanism” in the 1920s (Gerring, Party Ideologies in America, 126). However, a close reading of this book, and his subsequent speeches, shows that Hoover was calling for what he called “progressive individualism” and the “social justice” policies of the Progressive Era. Hoover distinguishes this “progressive individualism” from “individualism run riot without tempering principles,” which, Hoover argued, “would provide a long category of inequalities of tyrannies, dominations, and injustices” (Herbert Hoover, American Individualism [New York: Doubleday, Page, 1922], 8). Hoover calls for an “American individualism” distinct from the “Old World individualism”: “In our individualism we have long since abandoned the laissez-faire of the 18th Century—the notion that it is every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost.… We have confirmed its abandonment in terms of legislation, of social and economic justice.… We have learned that the impulse to production can only be maintained at a high pitch if there is a fair division of product. We have also learned that fair division can only be obtained by certain restrictions on the strong and the dominant” (Hoover, American Individualism, 10–11). By calling for “progressive individualism” in the 1920s as a middle ground between Old World laissez-faire “individualism” and autocratic “socialism,” Hoover was following “new liberals” in England like L. T. Hobhouse and prefiguring new “liberals” in America like Franklin Roosevelt. Hoover's language was typical of Progressives and Republicans in the 1880s–1920s."
