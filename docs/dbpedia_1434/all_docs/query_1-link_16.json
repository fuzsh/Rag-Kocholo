Nagle was Cleveland's territorial marshal in the 1890s. He turned to the left by 1905, joining the Farmer's Union, which espoused such populist ideals as government ownership of railroads, telephone systems, utility companies, and street cars. Three years later, Nagle joined the Socialist Party. He was committed to peaceful methods of change through mass education and political action, and supported equal rights for women and blacks.

Weaver was a Republican leader in Iowa between 1857 and 1877. He suffered a series of defeats by advocating Temperance. When he departed the Republican Party to become a Greenbacker, Weaver was accused of sacrificing political conviction in order to win elections. His disenchantment with the GOP, however, came from his belief that they had lost touch with their own ideals and interest in the people.America: History and Life, 26:10627\n\n____. \"Political Fusion in Iowa: The Election of James B.

The Readjuster Movement in Virginia during the 1880s under William Mahone was the most successful instance of political cooperation between blacks and whites in post-Civil War Virginia.\" It aimed at breaking the Bourbon hold on Virginia politics. In the early 1880s, Readjusters elected a governor, state legislature, two U.S. Senators, and a majority of the state's U.S. Congressional delegation. They scaled down the State debt (\"Readjusted\" it), expanded social services, improved schools for both races, and abolished public whippings, the poll tax, and dueling. Beginning in 1883, Democrats used the race issue to defeat the movement.

In 1880, however, 18 Greenbackers were elected to the legislature and the party's total popular vote almost equaled that of the Democrats who, in turn, gained on the Republicans. This marked the apogee of Greenback strength. Running fusion tickets with Democrats diluted its independent importance in the eighties, although a Greenbacker was elected governor in 1882. The Greenback Party was strongest in the western and northern counties of the Lower Peninsula. The temporary success of this harbinger of Populism was directly related to depressed agricultural prices. While farmers acted in response to genuine economic grievances, the party's leaders, who were \"men of considerable wealth and prestige,\" were motivated by resentment toward eastern bankers and considerations of security and status.

Methodist minister Gilbert De La Matyr began preaching in favor of financial and currency reform he catapulted in the 1870s. His references to the moneyed classes as oppressors of the masses incurred the wrath of conservatives. In 1878, the Indianapolis Sun became his defender and began carrying his sermons on financial reform. His fellow ministers forced him to retire from the pulpit in 1878, when he ran for Congress on the Greenback Party ticket. Once in Washington, he did propose several pieces of legislation but none passed. He was defeated for reelection in 1880 when the Democrats withdrew from fusion. De La Matyr probably brought Greenbackism a certain degree of respectability.

Using Illinois as an example, Formisano and Slade show that demands for railroad regulation were largely nonpartisan, leading Democrats were \"Bourbons\" rather than \"agrarian radicals,\" few Copperheads became Grangers or Greenbackers, and antiwar Democrats were lawyer-politicians from southern Illinois while Grangers and Greenbackers were strongest in Northern Illinois.

Democrat Francis, the mayor of St. Louis, won the gubernatorial election of 1888, despite being soundly defeated in his hometown of St. Louis. Anti-Cleveland sentiment, possible election irregularities involving blacks and foreigners, difficulties with the labor vote, anti-prohibitionists opposition, and a reform-Democrat campaign led by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch explain his rejection.

The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 signaled the close of a period of more open opportunity and generated a reappraisal of community values by both working people and local elites. For many working people, that reevaluation led to affiliation with the Knights of Labor, which challenged economic and political power structures. The Knights forged political alliances with reform-minded middle class neighbors. Working class political activism contributed to the great political realignment of the late nineteenth century.\n\nKuropiatnik, G.P.

When the Carnegie Steel Company purchased the Homestead steel works in 1883, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers held sufficient power to impose work rules on the new owner. The company prevailed in an 1892 lockout. Homestead workers then turned to public protest and politics. Homestead became a center of Populist political activity. With the Republican victory of 1896, the Company regained control over the town and suppress the workers' struggle.

In 1870, rapid industrialization and rural population decline led to the formation of the Labor Reform Party of New Hampshire. It failed to achieve any of its objectives, as its support came from disaffected Democrats, allowing Republicans to sweep into power. In the late 1870s, the Greenback Party began organizing in New Hampshire, and workers alienated by the two major parties turned to it with great interest. It also failed.

DAI, 43, no. 04A, (1982): 1269. Economic development in Oklahoma produced a complex radical political ideology. As one of the last open spaces in a world-market system, Walter Prescott Webb's \"Great Frontier\" method of settling the new land devastated Oklahoma, rapidly stripping the most available resources in a completely unrestrained manner. This produced a series of radical ideologies (including Populism and Socialism), which for a brief time challenged the most basic principles of frontier capitalism. Based significantly upon secondary sources.\n\nTrask, David F. \"A Note on the Politics of Populism.\" Nebraska History 1965 46(2): 157-161. Hypothesizes that Populism was an alliance of farmers and small-town businessmen affected by the Panic of 1893 and critical of big business. The author also suggests that these businessmen Populists later became Progressives and provide continuity between the two movements. America: History and Life,3:1996\n\nTrefousse, H.

Many historians consider the ULP a tool of political boss Abraham Ruef, but the party actually represented workingmen in San Francisco. Created in response to Mayor James Phelan's support of employers in a bitter Teamsters' strike, the ULP was indeed captured by Ruef, but after Ruef's downfall the party received continuing support from the city's working class. P. H. McCarthy was elected mayor on the ULP ticket in 1909.

Throughout the 19th century, third parties evolved from widespread antiparty sentiment and a belief that governance should attend to the public good rather than partisan agendas. This position was generally most effective on the local level. As third-party candidates tried to assert themselves in mainstream politics, however, they were forced to betray the antiparty foundations of the movement by allying with major parties. These alliances and the factionalism they engendered discouraged nonpartisan supporters and undermined the third-party movement. Many reformers and nonpartisans subsequently lent support to the Republican Party, which promised to attend to issues important to them, such as anti-slavery. America: History and Life, 37:874."
