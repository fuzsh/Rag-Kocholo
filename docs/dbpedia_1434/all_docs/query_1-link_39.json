Americans interpreted this economic crisis in the light of the acrimonious financial debates born of the Civil War—the money question chief among them. The consequences transformed American politics. Ideologically ill-equipped to devise cohesive economic policies, political parties split dangerously along sectional lines (between the Northeast and the Midwest). Particularly divided over President U.S. Grant's veto of the 1874 Inflation Bill, the Republican Party decisively lost the 1874 congressional elections. As a Democratic majority in the House spelled the doom of Reconstruction, the ongoing divisions of both parties on economic issues triggered a political realignment. The dramatic 1876 elections epitomized a new political landscape that would last for twenty years: high instability in power at the national level and what has been described as the “politics of inertia.” Therefore, by closely following the ramifications of the 1873 panic, this article proposes an explanation of how an economic crisis transformed into a pivotal political event.\n\nType\n\nTheme: Booms, Busts, and the Gilded Age\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era , Volume 10 , Issue 4 , October 2011 , pp. 403 - 423\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537781411000260 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Society for Historians of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era 2011\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

The author mentions the economic recession only to explain that unemployment swelled the ranks of the White Leagues in Louisiana.\n\n6\n\n6 Heather Cox Richardson underlines this in “North and West of Reconstruction: Studies in Political Economy” in Reconstructions: New Perspectives on the Postbellum United States, ed. Brown, Thomas J. (Oxford, 2006), 66–90Google Scholar.\n\n7\n\n7 For instance, Eric Foner views it as a large shift in the history of political thought and culture; the end of free-labor ideology put the fear of class warfare into the elites and pushed the Republican Party to economic conservatism.

More recently, Michael Holt argued that voters generally voted the party out of power when such a hardship hit: Donald, David Herbert, Baker, Jean Harvey, and Holt, Michael F., The Civil War and Reconstruction (New York, 2001)Google Scholar; Holt, Michael F., By One Vote: The Disputed Presidential Election of 1876 (Lawrence, KS, 2008)Google Scholar.\n\n8\n\n8 Kleppner, Paul, The Third Electoral System: Parties, Voters and Political Cultures, 1853–1892 (Chapel Hill, 1979)Google Scholar; Keller, Morton, Affairs of State: Public Life in Late Nineteenth-Century America (Cambridge, MA, 1977)CrossRefGoogle Scholar, quotation 238.\n\n9\n\n9 Chandler, Alfred D.

The phrase “Gilded Age” is used here for lack of a better one. Although the terminology might be contested, Schneirov offers a convincing argument about the chronology of the period. On the term itself, see the forum in Journal of Gilded Age and Progressive Era 8 (Oct. 2009): 463–85Google Scholar.\n\n11\n\n11 Sprague, O. M.

Fred Moseley also remarks on the scant scholarship on the 1873 crisis, while Hugh Rockoff underlines in a survey published in 2000 that Sprague's book “is still indispensable”: Moseley, Fred, “Depression of 1873–1879” in Business Cycles and Depressions: An Encyclopedia, eds.

One notable exception is Wicker, Elmus, Banking Panics of the Gilded Age (Cambridge, 2000), 16–33CrossRefGoogle Scholar, which offers a new narrative and brings new data to the analysis of the banking side of the panic.\n\n12\n\n12 The first NBER study of business cycles was published in 1923: National Bureau of Economic Research, Business Cycles and Unemployment; Report and Recommendations of a Committee of the President's Conference on Unemployment, Including an Investigation Made under the Auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research, 1st ed.

The role of sectionalism in economic issues was studied by Beale, Howard K., The Critical Year: A Study of Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction (New York, 1930)Google Scholar; but his particular analysis encountered considerable criticism after World War II. See, for example, Coben, Stanley, “Northeastern Business and Radical Reconstruction: A Re-Examination,” Mississippi Valley Historical Review 46 (June 1959): 67–70CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Sharkey, Money, Class, and Party. These scholars did not offer an alternative model of how sectional tensions shaped the money question.
