        "text": "- Political parties are the gatekeepers.\n\nAnd in many ways,\n\nI think Americans actually invented political parties.\n\nBut what the irony is that our constitution\n\nwas written before political parties existed.\n\nSo we have not as many kind of formal procedures in place\n\nto assure their centrality and to assure\n\nthat they can serve this gatekeeping role.\n\n- Very early on the north and the south\n\nwere clearly at odds in their interests.\n\nAs a result, political parties began to spring up\n\nthroughout the country, but two in particular,\n\nDemocratic Republicans and the Federalists.\n\nFederalists were the party of Hamilton,\n\nDemocratic Republicans, the party of Thomas Jefferson\n\nand James Madison.\n\nGeorge Washington is the only president\n\nto have never declared allegiance\n\nto a political party while he was in office.\n\nHis biggest issue was that the factionalism in America\n\nwas clearly driven by self-interest,\n\nand that people and the head of political parties\n\nand constituents were invested in their own interests\n\nat the expense of others.\n\nThis was a problem because power\n\nwould then become the priority\n\ninstead of the betterment of the nation,\n\ninstead of improving the democracy,\n\nworking towards stability,\n\nall of that would fall to the wayside\n\nas long as a party could maintain power.\n\nAnd if it was all about power,\n\nthen corruption and decay were close behind.\n\n- George Washington in his 1796 farewell address\n\nspecifically said, \"Don't build political parties.\"\n\nHe said, \"Once we build parties that are against each other,\n\nAmericans will start fighting each other\n\nand they will stop paying attention\n\nto the threats from other countries.\n\nAnd that will open us up to not only threats\n\nfrom other countries, but also will allow other countries\n\nto take advantage of these internal rifts that we have\n\nand manipulate us and distract us from the project\n\nof perfecting American democracy.\"\n\nAnd that was his warning.\n\nAnd then in the election of 1800, we had parties.\n\nWe made 'em pretty much right away.\n\n- At every stage, the major political parties\n\nin the United States had made claims about democracy\n\nthat were predicated on what the leadership\n\nbelieved the nation needed.\n\nAnd at each one of those moments,\n\nwhether it was in the 1800s or yesterday,\n\nthere was some flaw in that calculation.\n\nNo party can say that they have had a seamless\n\nor perfect history of conceptualizing democracy.\n\nAnd each party has a responsibility to reckon\n\nwith those failures in the past\n\nand provide people with something better for the future.\n\nAnd I don't think any of the political parties\n\nhave done that in a way that is convincing.\n\n- We need to see the reforms of our political parties,\n\nbecause right now, the way that our political parties\n\nis structured is that they're also focusing on the extremes\n\nand we're basically having people fighting things out\n\nrather than looking at consensus.\n\nAll of our politics is described\n\nin terms of win or lose, victory or defeat,\n\nnot about how we create coalitions,\n\nboth within parties and across parties to get things done\n\nfor the American people.\n\nIt's all about, how do I win?\n\nPolitics has become like mortal combats\n\nand politicians are like avatars in a video game\n\nwhere you just have to blow people away to win.\n\nThat's not how politic should be working\n\nand it's not how politics\n\nin the United States was envisioned.\n\nIt's just how it has become over time.\n\n- I think there is a real danger\n\nthat losing candidates from either party\n\nare going to stop treating their defeats as legitimate.\n\nWe have seen some of this in both parties,\n\nwe saw it spectacularly with President Trump\n\nand the 2020 election,\n\nand we have to rebuild a political norm\n\nagainst this kind of sore loser political behavior.\n\nIt has to start with each party showing less tolerance\n\nfor its own members when they indulge\n\nin this kind of irresponsible rhetoric.\n\nWe saw Democrats question the 2000 and 2004 elections\n\nand launch objections to it on the floor of Congress\n\nand they seemed harmless to a lot of Democrats at the time.\n\nI would like to think that some of them\n\nhave reconsidered that after seeing what those kinds\n\nof objections helped encourage after the 2020 election.\n\n- We should not assume that democracy\n\njust means two parties.\n\nIn fact, two parties often means a lack of imagination\n\nand maybe lack of new ideas really.\n\nIn the late 19th century,\n\na period of great economic transformation\n\nand also the economic depression of the 1870s, the 1890s,\n\nyou had parties pretty much forgotten today,\n\nlike the Greenback Party, the Populist Party,\n\nother local labor parties in various cities,\n\nwhich tried to really crack the hold of the two party system\n\non our political alignments.\n\nIt seems like we are stuck with these two parties right now\n\neven though a lot of people find neither of them\n\nall that appealing.\n\nI wonder what would be the result for American democracy\n\nif we really had a more multiple party system\n\nas many countries do.\n\nSome places works very well,\n\nsome places it doesn't work all that well.\n\nBut it helps to get new ideas into circulation."
