        "text": "First Annual Message to Congress. Notes \"the wisdom and justice of humane and liberal local legislation with respect to [the] education and general welfare\" of former slaves. Aid to the States for public education \"is no longer a question.\" Calls for further aid for technical and higher education. \"It is vain to hope for the success of a free government without the means of insuring the intelligence of those who are the source of power.\" Supports expansion of the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress. Calls for a university in the District of Columbia.\n\nVetoes Army Appropriations Bill. Hayes objected to language prohibiting use of troops at election sites \"to keep peace at the polls.\" He argued that no soldier had ever interfered with any election and that laws were already in place to prevent that. Moreover, he argued that the legislation would \"deprive the civil authorities. . . of all power to keep the peace at the Congressional elections.\" He stated that \"national legislation to provide safeguards for free and honest elections is necessary. . . to secure the right to vote to the enfranchised race at the South, but also to prevent fraudulent voting in the large cities of the North.\" Veto sustained.\n\nVetoes \"Act to Prohibit Military Interference at Elections.\" Hayes references his prior veto of 04/29/1879 and offers a detailed accounting of prior law relating to the use of the military by the National Government. He notes that under the legislation it would be unlawful to use the Army or Navy \"to uphold the authority of the Government of the United States.\" Veto sustained.\n\nVetoes general Appropriations Bill. The Bill raises the same kinds of concerns raised in the message of 04/29/1879. \"The supervision of the elections will be reduced to a mere inspection, without authority. . .to make the election a fair one.\" And, \"on the day of an election, peace and good order are more necessary than on any other day of the year.\" The veto was sustained.\n\nVeto of \"An act making appropriations to pay fees of the United States marshals and their general deputies.\" He notes that the bill has sections that are \"identical in tenor and effect\" to the bill he vetoed on 06/23/1879. Hayes points out that this is coupled with appropriations in a way to force him to choose either to continue essential functions or to approve legislation to which he has objected. This legislation has been described by the House historian as an important early example of the use of appropriations \"riders.\" This strategy was developed by Southern Democrats who were seeking an end to reconstruction. As a consequence of Hayes's insistence, some of the government was not funded until the middle of 1880. This veto was sustained.\n\nVeto of \"An act making appropriations to supply certain deficiencies in the appropriations for the service of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880. Hayes observes, \" Under these circumstances, to attempt in an appropriation bill the modification or repeal of these laws is to annex a condition to the passage of needed and proper appropriations, which tends to deprive the Executive of that equal and independent exercise of discretion and judgment which the Constitution contemplates.\" This veto was unchallenged.\n\nFourth Annual State of the Union Message. Calls for prompt and hearty obedience to the equal-rights amendments to the Constitution. \"It will be the duty of the Executive . . . to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution.\" Universal education is \"the best and surest guaranty of the primary rights of citizenship.\" \"Whatever Government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done.\" There is a need for increased appropriations for \"educational facilities for the Indians.\"\n\n\"The conduct of the Indians throughout the country during the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and peaceful.\" Foresees \"gradual merging of our Indian population in the great body of American citizenship.\""
