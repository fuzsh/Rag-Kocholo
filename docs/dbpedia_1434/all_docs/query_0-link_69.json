        "meta_description": "Civil War veteran, congressman, and two-time third-party Presidential candidate James Baird Weaver (1833-1912) built this historic home in 1865. Weaver was known as a skilled orator and served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1879 to 1881 and from 1885 to 1889. In 1880, the anti-monopolist Greenback Party nominated him as their candidate to run for president. Weaver unsuccessfully ran again for president again in 1892, this time as a member of the Populist Party. In 1975, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark for its association with Weaver. A private residence today, the home is known for its arched windows with dentillated brick hoods.",

        "text": "James Baird Weaver was born in Dayton, Ohio on June 12, 1833 and moved with his family to Michigan two years later. In 1842, the family moved near Keosauqua, Iowa and then to a homestead in 1843 in what would be come Davis County (at the time Iowa was an unincorporated territory; it became a state in 1846). He attended country schoolhouses and was raised in a devout Christian family.\n\nWeavers' political views as an adult were shaped during his childhood. His father, Abram, was a Democrat and served on the county's first board of commissioners and was elected clerk of the district court in 1848. In 1849, Weaver's brother-in-law, who became postmaster in 1849, got him a job delivering mail to the adjacent Jefferson County. Two years later, Weaver left that job to study law under a local lawyer. Then in 1853, Weaver journeyed with another brother-in-law to California to search for gold. He was apparently unsuccessful and returned to Bloomfield where he resumed his law studies.\n\nFrom 1855 to 1856, Weaver attended the Cincinnati Law School and it was during that time that he became an abolitionist. He was admitted into the Iowa bar in in 1856 and got married in 1858 to Clara Vinson, with whom he would have eight children. By this time he had joined the Republican Party, which was against the expansion of slavery. In the coming years before the Civil War, Weaver became more involved with the party. He was a delegate to the party's state convention and accompanied the Iowa delegation to the 1860 Republican National Convention, where Abraham Lincoln was nominated as the party's presidential candidate.\n\nDuring the war, Weaver served in the Second Iowa Infantry and eventually rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. He saw action in several battles including Shiloh, Fort Donelson, and Corinth.\n\nIn 1866, Weaver became the district attorney for the second judicial district of Iowa and served in that position until 1870. President Johnson also appointed him as the assessor of internal revenue for the district of Iowa and Weaver served until 1873. During the next two years, Weaver ran for Congress, governor, and state senate and lost all three races. However, in 1877, Weaver joined the Greenback Party, which advocated for economic and labor rights reforms. As noted above, he was elected to Congress in 1879 and ran for president 1880, receiving just 3.3% of the vote. During the next ten years, Weaver advocated for a variety of causes including women's voting rights, labor rights, and anti-monopolist reforms.\n\nThe Greenback Party eventually dissolved by the late 1880s. Many of the concerns of former Greenback supporters (mostly farmers and laborers) did not go away, however. Weaver joined the newly created Populist Party that called for reforms such as government ownership of railroads, a graduated income tax, and a shorter work week. He wrote a book called A Call to Action to promote the party's ideas. In the 1892 presidential election, Weaver won 8.5% of the vote and four western states, becoming the first third-party to candidate to win electoral votes since 1860.\n\nWeaver's time in Congress is also associated with the settlement of what was called the \"Unassigned Lands\" in what is now the state of Oklahoma. This area was in the center of the state and, at the time, surrounded by Indian reservations. Homesteaders and cattlemen argued that the area was owned by the federal government and should therefore be opened for settlement. Weaver agreed and introduced a bill in 1885 in favor of this policy but it stalled. It wasn't until 1889 that Congress approved the settlement of the Unassigned Lands. The official date of the opening was on April 22. This was the first of several \"land runs\" in Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1890, the Weavers moved to Colfax, Iowa. He was elected mayor in 1901 and became the editor of the Iowa Tribune. He also started to write about his life experiences, penning articles for the Des Moines Register and other publications. He died on February 6, 1912 of heart failure."
