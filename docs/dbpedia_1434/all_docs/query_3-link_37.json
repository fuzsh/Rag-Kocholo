        "text": "1In elections from 1789 to 1804, each elector voted for two individuals without indicating which was to be president and which was to be vice president. 2In early elections, electors were chosen by legislatures, not by popular vote, in many states. 3Candidates winning no electoral votes and less than 2 percent of the popular vote are excluded; percentages may not add up to 100 percent because of rounding. 4Washington was unopposed for president in 1789 and 1792. 5Because the two houses of the New York legislature could not agree on electors, the state did not cast its electoral votes. North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the Constitution. 6As both Jefferson and Burr received the same number of electoral votes, the decision was referred to the House of Representatives. The Twelfth Amendment (1804) provided that electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president. 7As no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes, the decision was made by the House of Representatives. 8Greeley died shortly after the election in November. Three electors pledged to Greeley cast their votes for him, but they were not counted; the others cast their votes for the other candidates listed. 9Includes a variety of joint tickets with People's Party electors committed to Bryan. 10One Gore elector from Washington, D.C., abstained from casting an electoral vote."
