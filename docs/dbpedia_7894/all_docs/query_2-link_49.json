        "text": "\"Echoes of Burroughs\", Elizabeth Stanway, Cosmic Stories blog, 3rd December 2023.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] To get a near-contemporary feel for the gradual recognition of implausibilities of Burroughs, it's interesting to note this 1942 article in Popular Astronomy magazine, describing Burroughs' writing and asking readers to submit their comments on it. The article author's own list of compiled errors was published shortly afterwards. [Return to text]\n\n[2] This letter from Burroughs appears to be difficult to find, so Iâ€™m forced to rely on secondary sources to describe its content here. The Portsmouth Evening News of 25th October 1926 reports the author's telegram to the Daily Express as saying:\n\n\"The surface of Mars was formerly physically identical with the earth, and, as similar conditions doubtless still prevail on both planets, there is no reason to question a like evolutionary development of fauna from identical life spores. Clouds, winds, snow and marshes that astronomers have discovered on Mars indicate an atmosphere. Vast reclamation schemes by means of intermediate aqueducts presuppose that there are rational inhabitants highly developed in engineering and agriculture and naturally suggest further considerable culture.\n\nThe enormous waste spaces on the planet, combined with our knowledge of human nature, postulate nomadic, war-like, predatory border tribes. The constant battle for survival has rendered the Martian merciless almost to cruelty, and ages of military service against the apaches of the Martian deserts have made him loyal, just, fearless and self-reliant.\n\nI visualise the Martian of the dominant race in Mars as distinctly of human type, with strong features and intelligent expression, a large chest, and slightly less pronounced muscular development than ours, owing to the rarer air and lower force of gravity in Mars. The Martian might fairly resemble the intellectual and spiritual composite of Spencer, Caesar, de Lesseps, and Geronimo.\"\n\nThere are a lot of assumptions here to unpack, but above all they suggest a strong influence from the Lowellian school of canal-believers then already in decline. Indeed contemporary reports of the Martian opposition (close approach to Earth) that same week in the Lanarkshire Sunday Post and the Antrim Northern Whig mention Burroughs' interest while commenting on the lack of evidence for his view (or Lowell's) and the then-dominant scientific consensus that Mars was not inhabitable.
