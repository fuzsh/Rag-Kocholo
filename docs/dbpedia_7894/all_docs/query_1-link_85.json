        "text": "(1875–1950). American novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs was noted for his Tarzan stories, which revolved around an English nobleman’s son who was raised by apes after he was abandoned in the African jungle as a baby. The Tarzan stories were translated into more than 56 languages and were also popular in comic-strip, motion-picture, television, and radio versions.\n\nBurroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois. The son of a wealthy businessman, he was educated at private schools in Chicago, at the prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts (from which he was expelled), and at Michigan Military Academy, where he subsequently taught briefly. He spent the years 1897–1911 in numerous unsuccessful jobs and business ventures in Chicago and Idaho. Eventually he settled in Chicago with his wife and three children; he began writing advertising copy and then turned to fiction.\n\nBurroughs’s story Under the Moons of Mars appeared in serial form in the adventure magazine The All-Story in 1912 and was so successful that Burroughs turned to writing full-time. (The work was later novelized as A Princess of Mars in 1917 and adapted as the film John Carter in 2012.) The first Tarzan story appeared in 1912; it was followed in 1914 by Tarzan of the Apes, the first of 25 such books. Burroughs created in Tarzan a figure that instantly captured the popular fancy, as did his many tales set on Mars."
