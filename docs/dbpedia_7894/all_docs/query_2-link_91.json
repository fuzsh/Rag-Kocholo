        "text": "I am in the midst of an uncharacteristic urge to read everything that Edgar Rice Burroughs has written: at least eighty novels and other pieces of fiction. The way I see it, I could dedicate the time to reading all six volumes of My Struggle or have a bit more fun knocking off the more well known series like Tarzan and John Carter and maybe a smattering of the less known series like Pellucidar and Caspak. Could I do both?\n\nBurroughs is one of the most well known American authors, translated and read around the world. I read my first Tarzan in Spanish over fifty years ago and even though I probably didn’t finish the book, I was intrigued. Then there were all those Tarzan movies and television shows to keep the image alive, despite so many being horribly racist and often down-right silly. The recent Disney movie John Carter, despite being awful, introduced me to the Barsoom series and like Tarzan, I think I will read all of the novels (even if only in the bathroom).\n\nI recently completed Tarzan of the Apes which, narratively, is the first novel of the series. At first I thought I had read this novel before but then remembered having read Philip José Farmer’s fictional biography, Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke. If you think you know everything about Tarzan from all the movies, read Burroughs’ original novel. I won’t say it’s great literature but except for a few glaringly twisted sentences, it isn’t badly written and is vivid, simple, exciting, and fast-loving.\n\nHere are the selected works of Edgar Rice Burroughs from Wkipedia (for a more detailed and complete list, see the bibliography entry):\n\nTarzan series\n\nTarzan of the Apes (1912)\n\nThe Return of Tarzan (1913)\n\nThe Beasts of Tarzan (1914)\n\nThe Son of Tarzan (1914)\n\nTarzan and the Jewels of Opar (1916)\n\nJungle Tales of Tarzan, 1917 [1916].\n\nTarzan the Untamed, 1921 [1919].\n\nTarzan the Terrible (1921)\n\nTarzan and the Golden Lion, 1923 [1922].\n\nTarzan and the Ant Men (1924)\n\nTarzan, Lord of the Jungle, 1928 [1927].\n\nTarzan and the Lost Empire (1928)\n\nTarzan at the Earth’s Core (1929)\n\nTarzan the Invincible (1930–31).\n\nTarzan Triumphant (1931)\n\nTarzan and the City of Gold (1932)\n\nTarzan and the Lion Man, 1934 [1933].\n\nTarzan and the Leopard Men (1935)\n\nTarzan’s Quest, 1936 [1935].\n\nTarzan the Magnificent, 1937 [1936].\n\nTarzan and the Forbidden City (1938)\n\nTarzan and the Foreign Legion (1947)\n\nTarzan and the Tarzan Twins (1963, for younger readers)\n\nTarzan and the Madman (1964)\n\nTarzan and the Castaways (1965)\n\nBurroughs, Edgar Rice; Lansdale, Joe R (1995), Tarzan: the Lost Adventure.\n\nBarsoom series\n\nA Princess of Mars (1912)\n\nThe Gods of Mars (1914)\n\nThe Warlord of Mars (1918)\n\nThuvia, Maid of Mars (1920)\n\nThe Chessmen of Mars (1922)\n\nThe Master Mind of Mars (1928)\n\nA Fighting Man of Mars (1931)\n\nSwords of Mars (1936)\n\nSynthetic Men of Mars (1940)\n\nLlana of Gathol (1948)\n\nJohn Carter of Mars (1964)\n\nBurroughs, John Coleman (1940), John Carter and the Giant of Mars.\n\n“Skeleton Men of Jupiter” (1942)\n\nPellucidar series\n\nAt the Earth’s Core (1914)\n\nPellucidar (1923)\n\nTanar of Pellucidar (1928)\n\nTarzan at the Earth’s Core (1929)\n\nBack to the Stone Age (1937)\n\nLand of Terror (1944)\n\nSavage Pellucidar (1963)\n\nVenus series\n\nPirates of Venus (1934)\n\nLost on Venus (1935)\n\nCarson of Venus (1939)\n\nEscape on Venus (1946)\n\nThe Wizard of Venus (1970)\n\nCaspak series\n\nThe Land That Time Forgot (1918)\n\nThe People That Time Forgot (1918)\n\nOut of Time’s Abyss (1918)\n\nMoon series\n\nThe Moon Maid (1926; The Moon Men)\n\nPart I: The Moon Maid\n\nPart II: The Moon Men\n\nPart III: The Red Hawk\n\nMucker series\n\nThe Mucker (1914)\n\nThe Return of the Mucker (1916)\n\nThe Oakdale Affair (1917)\n\nOther science fiction\n\nBeyond the Farthest Star (1941)\n\nThe Lost Continent (1916; aka Beyond Thirty)\n\nThe Monster Men (1929)\n\nThe Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw (1937)\n\nJungle adventure novels[edit]\n\nThe Man-Eater (1915)\n\nThe Cave Girl (1925)\n\nThe Eternal Lover (1925; aka The Eternal Savage)\n\nJungle Girl (1932; aka Land of the Hidden Men)\n\nThe Lad and the Lion (1938)\n\nWestern novels\n\nThe Bandit of Hell’s Bend (1926)\n\nThe War Chief (1927)\n\nApache Devil (1933)\n\nThe Deputy Sheriff of Comanche County (1940)\n\nHistorical novels\n\nI am a Barbarian (1967)\n\nThe Outlaw of Torn (1927)\n\nOther works"
