        "text": "THE fiction writer should read most anything but fiction. He should be able to find entertainment in every form of sport, whether he is able to take an active part in it or not. He should enjoy a variety of games and other activities that keep his mind young and supple.\n\nPlease remember that I am speaking only of writers of highly imaginative fiction; concerning the others I know nothing. But the fiction writer to whom I refer should be what my two sons call monkey-minded—that is, have the tendency to caper erratically through the forest of human knowledge, swinging form tree to tree, tasting the fruits of many.\n\nThere is one thing that I would constantly impress upon the young writer—and possibly with greater reason upon the established writer—that he should not take either himself or his work too seriously. Except for purposes of entertainment, I consider fiction, like drama an absolute unessential. I would not look to any fiction writer, living or dead, for guidance upon any subject, and, therefore, if he does not entertain, he is a total loss.\n\nEvery possible advantageous function of fiction may be found in history or biography, but for pure entertainment and mental relaxation nothing can take the place of fiction and drama, with the advantages all on the side of fiction since it may be had economically and in comfort at home.\n\nThe man who takes himself and his work too seriously is certain to attempt something for which he is not fitted, with the result that he soon loses whatever following he may have created, or if he is a beginner, he never achieves any such following.\n\nIn fiction the reader has a right to expect entertainment and relaxation. If obscenities entertain him he can always find fiction that will fulfill his requirements. If he wishes to be frightened or thrilled or soothed, he will find writers for his every mood, but you may rest assured that he does not wish to be instructed. He does not wish to have to think, and as fully ninety per cent of the people in the world are not equipped with anything wherewith to think intelligently, the fiction writer who wishes to be a success should leave teaching to qualified teachers and attend strictly to his business of entertaining.\n\nI have been writing for nineteen years and I have been successful probably because I have always realized that I knew nothing about writing, and have merely tried to tell and interesting story entertainingly. But there is another reason for the continued success of my books which I should like to impress upon younger writers. From the beginning I have adhered to a policy of ordinary business honesty t hat was instilled into me by my father. My first stories were the best stories that I could write, and every story that I have written since has been the very best story that I could write. I have felt that it was a duty to those people who bought my books that I should give them the very best within me. I have no illusions as to the literary value of what I did give them, but I have the satisfaction of knowing that I gave them the best that my ability permitted.\n\nThe result of this policy has been the continued interest of my earliest readers in all my subsequent novels. Unquestionably they have not liked them all equally well, but I think not many of them have ever been keenly disappointed.\n\nIt is the reading public that either makes or breaks you, and if you are fortunate enough to have one successful book, redouble your efforts to write a better one the next time.\n\nTHIS article is intended for people who are writing or hope to write for their livelihood, and to such it is probably unnecessary to state that publicity is essential to success, no matter how much one may shrink form it—or pretend to shrink from it. But there is a matter of professional ethics involved, as well as ordinary good taste, which I believe should always be in the mind of every writer. I have no patience whatsoever with he man who does a rude, unkindly or discourteous thing for the purpose of obtaining publicity; nor with the writer who makes a fool of himself in order to obtain it.\n\nIt is perfectly proper for your publishers to buy publicity for you. That is their business, not yours. And it is perfectly proper for you at their request, to furnish them with any material that they may require for this purpose; but outside of this I consider itunethical for a writer to seek publicity."
