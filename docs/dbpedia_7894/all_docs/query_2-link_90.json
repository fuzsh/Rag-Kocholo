        "meta_description": "Curiosity Rover postcard from MarsOf the most famous and influential of the early pulp writers, Edgar Rice Burroughs is now, sadly, probably the least known, despite his vast influence on major science-fiction pop culture figures such as George Lucas and Ray Bradbury. It is his ancient dusty Mars, covered in the ruins of dying alien civilizations whose remnants compete for limited resources, which directly inspired Bradbury’s own phenomenal Martian Chronicles, and it is his sword-clad wanderers, kidnapped princesses, and telepathic aliens which brought us the Star Wars franchise.",
