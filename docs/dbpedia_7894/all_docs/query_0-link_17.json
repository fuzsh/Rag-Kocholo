        "text": "No, Edgar Rice Burroughs did not write any stories about Tarzan on Mars. The appearance of that book plate his nephew designed is strictly allegorical, providing a visual collage of elements from the author's best known works. These obviously include Tarzan (who is shown holding a planetary globe, something he obviously never literally accomplishes in any story), as well as stories in the \"planetary romance\" genre. The latter group arguably includes The Moon Maid, and it definitely includes Burroughs' Barsoom series taking place on a fantastical version of the planet Mars.\n\nThe Wikipedia link for the Barsoom stories does a pretty good job of describing the series as I remember it. And nowhere in the series does young Lord Greystoke make his way to Barsoom. In fact, the lack of any official crossover between Edgar Rice Burroughs' two best-known series made Tarzan visiting Mars a popular topic for fan fiction writers. Tarzan's unofficial adventures on the Red Planet were published frequently in the amateur press, and they were sometimes even released as full novels, such as Tarzan on Mars by John Bloodstone (Stuart Byrne)."
