        "text": "Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 â€“ March 19, 1950) was an American writer, best known for his creations of the jungle hero Tarzan and the heroic Mars adventurer John Carter, although he produced works in many genres.\n\nAlthough some contend the theory, there are strong indications that Burroughs was at least exposed to the Theosophical writings. In September, 1959, American science fiction writer Fritz Leiber published an essay in Scithers' fanzine Amra entitled \"John Carter - Sword of Theosophy\", postulating that E. R. Burroughs had found a rich source of background materials for his Mars books in the Theosophical teachings.\n\nOnline resources\n\nArticles"
