Warwickshire PRIVATE MEETING DECISION The amalgamation of the Birmingham Combination and the South Warwickshire League has been agreed upon at .\n\na special private meeting of the representatives of the two competitions held in Birmingham. The meeting was attended by about 20 representatives and it was decided that the nine existing South Warwickshire League clubs would participate. They are Banbury Spencer Reserves, Bed worth Town Reserves, Cheltenham Town Reserves, Cubbington Albion, Flavells, Lockheed Reserves, Saltisford Rovers, Warwick Town and Warwick Constabulary. Nuneaton, Rugby, Stratford Town, Hinckley, Stafford Rangers, West Bromwich Albion, and Atherstone are other clubs likely to be in membership. Mr E .\n\nH. Spiers, secretary of the Birmingham Combination, said the new league's name would be decided upon at a meeting to be held in the near future, but there was no doubt whatever that the words \"Birmingham Combination\" would form part of the title. Applications from suitable clubs would be considered and, in view of the fact that it was desirous to prepare the plans for the new competition as quickly as possible, these applications should be sent to Mr. Spiers at once.

Double: Irish Lizard and Soldier Rowland .\n\nWill Albion Three Experts Give Their Views CITIZEN,\" experienced commentator, picks Albion, points to the contrasting Albion-Port Vale styles and advises caution. The Albion, premier team of the country, should win, but the operative word is So much can happen in 8 match to upset calculations particularly a Cup-tie. On their best form, the Albion's success would be assured, but not by 8 margin of more than two goals. Port Vale, too, are at their best, then 8 grand exhibition of football, contrasting two totally different styles 01 play, may well puts the Black Country side into the Final by an only goal. If .\n\nboth teams, maybe overawed little by the greatness of the occasion, are not. quite up to the standard 01 which they are capable, I consider the result will favour the Albion by two or three goals to one. Depends on Halves It will largely be a case the Albion attack versus Port Vale defence. Knowing the swiftness with which Albion's attacks are so often executed an attractive alliance of speed with accuracy and oppor tunism- must predict success for the First Division leaders. And look to Albion's wing halves as the chief architects in building up that triumph .\n\nPort Vale's methods may SO unorthodox as to throw the Albion out of gear. If that should be the case, much will depend on the defence of the West Bromwich team. That defence will need to be on the alert every second of the 90 minutes. for I gather the Vale forwards have a knack of scoring from the odd breakaway, TASK TOO BIG FOR PORT VALE TOM BLUNT. the \"Sports Final\" columnist, goes all out for a clear-cut Albion win .\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 3, Port Vale 0. That: or something approximating to it, is how I expect to see the score-sheet read at the end of 90 minutes at Villa Park tomorrow. I know that this fighting Port Vale side have beaten both the Cupholders. Blackpool, and Cardiff City, among others on the way to the semifinal and I hand it to them for BEFORE AND AFTER This is what the experts think BEFORE the game. For the fullest and best account of what actually happens see tomorrow's eight-page Sports Final.\" Read Charles Richards' move bymove report .\n\nTom Blunt's summing-up. Danny Blanchflower's As a player saw it.\" Citizen will be at Maine Road covering the other semi-final. striking a blow for the smaller clubs, but this time I think they will run up something which they will not be able to handle. Just as team spirit has been largely instrumental in getting the Vale thus far in League and Cup, team spirit has played a big part in the Albion's fine League effort against clubs who can by no stretch of the imagination be compared with those who go to make up the Third Division North. A Danger Point As I see It, there is only one big danger for the Albion a touch of over confidence In defence which could lead to Mr .\n\nFreddie Steele's men snatching the Arst goal. If this happens, West Bromwich supporters will have cause for anxiety, for the Vale would almost certainly resort to the strategy which has won them many a game this season, including their last tie against Leyton Orient. They would hang on to their lead like: grim death by packing, their defence and hoping for the best. And. of course, the game would steadily deteriorate as a spectacle .\n\nam trusting the Albion not to let this happen and 11 they can produce their true form I think they will not only get that vital Arst goal but more besides, to ensure a place in the Final. ATTACK WILL PREVAIL DANNY BLANCHFLOWER. Aston Villa and Ireland. student of football strategy and Sports contributor, believes in quality, admires Port Vale, but picks Albion. I have been asked to make some predictions about tomorrow's match .\n\nRather I would set you thinking about the likely course of the game by posing some of the possibilities of what could be either the Match of the Season or the Flop of the Midlands.\" Only Fulham have scored more goals than the Albion, so the initials W.B.A. obviously suggest We Believe In Attack. On the other hand, that fantastic goals against record of the Vale's suggests that all out attack against them might be Perilous Will Cheadle stay put in the middle and Vale's defence refuse to be drawn by Allen's roving? then Nicholls' scope for bursting through may be limited. If the Vale's forwards fall back, as they apparently do. will not that also limit Allen's room for movement? On the other hand, such a defensive attitude could increase the scope for, attack .\n\nIn other words, it does not turn back the tide; it only delays it. Can Port Vale snatch a goal, then. and delay the tide for the rest of the game? Can they lull the Albion into a false sense of security and then, with sharp, Incisive attacks. steal the match? They have already proved this to be the most suitable method for their capabilities. It is worth bearing in mind that most the rivals have been of the attacking school .\n\nWonderful Albion don't believe the Albion have been guilty of any complacency recently, but 11 there was any such tendency. that 5-0 defeat by Chelsea should, have shaken them out of it. No, I think theirs has been a wonder ful performance this season. They have had good method and they have not been afraid to put that method first all the time. They have shown that if you keep on playing good football .\n\nthe rewards will come. Still. 1 I were a Vale player, think I would feel 8 psychological advantage over the Albion players, for the Albion are the favourites. Therefore, the men from the Potteries have nothing to lose. They can be glorious In valiant In defeat, and sympathised with if the match turns out to be completely one sided .\n\nMy own prophecy? It is this. I believe In quality; I believe there is a difference between the standards of the Divisions; I believe in constructiveness and ATTACK.

Some members of the English team also arrived and. with the remaining teams, took part In a trial run over the course this morning.

Peace moves in the dispute, which threatened to spread throughout the industry and involve 6.000 workers, began on Tuesday when Sir Walter decided to appoint a Committee of Investigation. He asked employers and the union to take immediate steps to enable normal working to be resumed in the laboratories .\n\nThe technicians' executive passed 8 resolution that they were willing to await the committee of investigation and, without prejudice, to lift their work-to-rule and overtime ban to allow the committee to conduct Its work in a reasonable atmosphere. The Minister, they suggested, should extract similar undertakings from the employers' associations, other than the Film Laboratory Association, with regard to no hostile action and withdrawal of notices at once. The resolution said that a mass I meeting of the membership would be held on Sunday, and in the light of replies to these requests for assurances, we shall recommend the date to be agreed with the employers for a recommencement of work. Further Talks on Railmen's Pay A further meeting was being held in London today of the British Transport Commission and the engineering and railway unions on the claim for a 15 per cent. increase pay for about 116,000 employees in the railway workshops, Earlier this month the Transport Commission offered an increase of 7s .\n\na week for men and proportionate increases for women and juniors.
