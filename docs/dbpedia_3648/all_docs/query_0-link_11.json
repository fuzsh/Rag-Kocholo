Charlton was a key member of England’s victorious 1966 World Cup team and also enjoyed great success at club level with United, who became the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.\n\nA statement on behalf of the Charlton family said: “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Sir Bobby passed peacefully in the early hours of Saturday morning. He was surrounded by his family.”\n\nCharlton won 106 caps for England and scored 49 international goals - records for his country at the time.\n\n‌\n\nWe also lost Terry Venables in 2023. The former England manager died aged 80 on November 26. Venables took the national team to the semi-final of Euro 96, as well as taking charge of Barcelona, Leeds and Tottenham during his managerial career.\n\nEverton chairman Bill Kenwright died, age 78, on October 24. He had suffered with health issues for some time and recently had surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his liver. A memorial service remembering the life of Bill Kenwright took place at Liverpool Cathedral on Monday afternoon.\n\nA club statement released after the procedure said it had been successful, though complications had led to a period in intensive care. By October 12, the date of the update issued by Everton, he had left hospital and returned home for what was expected to be a long but complete recovery.\n\n‌\n\nHere is a list of sportspeople we tragically lost in 2023:\n\nJan 1 - Frank McGarvey 66 - former St Mirren, Celtic and scottish international - pancreatic cancer\n\nJanuary 5 - David Gold 86 - chairman of West Ham\n\nJan 8 - Ken Scotland 86 - Scottish rugby union player\n\nJan 8 - Ray Middleton 86 - British Olympic racewalker\n\nJan 9 - David Duckham 76 - English rugby union player\n\nJan 14 - John Wickham 73, british motor racing team owner\n\nJan 16 - John Bicourt 77, British Olympic middle-distance runner\n\nJan 19 - Peter Thomas 78, English-Irish footballer (Irish international)\n\nJan 19 - Anton Walkes 25, English footballer died in boat crash (Portsmouth, Atlanta United, Charlotte FB)\n\nJan 23 - Fred Lindop 84.
