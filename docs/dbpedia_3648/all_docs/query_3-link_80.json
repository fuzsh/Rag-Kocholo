        "text": "Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and it seems like just a week ago the Dodgers were a miserable team with no chance of even making the postseason.\n\nHere we are almost a quarter into the season, so it seems a good time to get a different perspective on the Dodgers.\n\nI reached out to my colleague, our Dodgers beat writer Jack Harris, who answered some questions while on a plane from Toronto to Phoenix. It’s always good to get some alternate viewpoints, and there are few better than Jack. Any numbers or rankings mentioned are through Sunday’s games.\n\nQ. Here we are 31 games into the season. What would you say is the biggest strength and biggest weakness on this team?\n\nHarris: The Dodgers’ biggest strength? There are four of them: Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith.\n\nNo other team in baseball has a better quartet topping their lineup. No other club has had a group nearly as productive through the first month of the season.\n\nThrough Sunday, Betts leads MLB in hitting, just ahead of Smith. Betts also leads in OPS, with Ohtani ranking fourth. Freeman is off to the slowest start, and he is batting .306.\n\nOf course, winning games, especially come fall, requires much more than four star hitters.\n\nBut possessing such firepower is a prerequisite for success. And just as the club hoped, their group is living up to — and probably surpassing — expectations so far.\n\nAs for a weakness: The depth of the pitching staff, rotation-wise and in the bullpen.\n\nTyler Glasnow has been great. Evan Phillips too. Yoshinobu Yamamoto is perhaps turning a corner, as well.\n\nBut the Dodgers’ pitching depth drops off quickly behind them — especially given the team’s mounting number of pitcher injuries.\n\nQ. Betts hasn’t missed a beat on offense since moving to shortstop. How would you say he has done defensively? And would you say the Dodgers are content with him at short all season?\n\nHarris: I’d say he’s been fine, given the circumstances.\n\nHis four errors are fourth most among MLB shortstops. While he can make spectacular plays, he makes routine blunders too.\n\nStill, for a player new to the position at this level (or any level past high school), he is holding his own — and actually ranks third among MLB shortstops in defensive runs saved.\n\nAs for the future, I think the club still wants a larger sample before deciding how to proceed. It’s possible Betts stays there all year. It’s also possible Andrew Friedman explores shortstops at the deadline. With time, more clarity should come.\n\nQ. If you don’t mind, three injury updates and when you think they will be back: Jason Heyward, Brusdar Graterol and Blake Treinen.\n\nHarris: Blake Treinen is closest to returning, but it likely won’t be this week, Dave Roberts said. While Treinen has giving up runs in all three of his rehab appearances, the team has gotten positive reports on how he is progressing. His next outing will be Wednesday.\n\nJason Heyward seemed to be progressing last week, but then was paused from baseball activities again because of continued discomfort in his back. Roberts said he is “still a ways away,” and acknowledged Heyward’s recovery is taking “longer than we all anticipated.”\n\nBrusdar Graterol’s return date is even more uncertain. He tried to start a throwing program, then got shut down again because of soreness. The team is still fully expecting Graterol back at some point, but Roberts said it will be a “long program” before he returns to action.\n\nQ. Chris Taylor has been responsible for some great moments in Dodgers history. No one can ever take that away from him. But he is struggling big time right now. How long do the Dodgers stick with him?\n\nHarris: The quick context on Taylor: He attempted a swing change this offseason, trying to return to the “feels” he used when he first joined the Dodgers.\n\nBut it’s already clear it didn’t work, and now he’s trying to adjust on the fly.\n\nBecause of that, the Dodgers could give him some runway to figure things out — especially with Heyward’s return still not imminent.\n\nThe team likes his versatility, and hasn’t given up hope he can resurrect his swing. Still, his leash isn’t infinite. And the longer this rut continues, the harder it will be for the Dodgers to justify giving him regular — if any — playing time.\n\nQ. What have you learned or have been surprised by about Shohei Ohtani while watching him play every day. I’ve watched baseball for more than 40 years and when he connects solidly, the ball sounds different off his bat than for anyone else.\n\nHarris: The exit velos are impressive (even after covering the 2021 Angels, it’s not something you ever quite get used to) but I’ve also noticed how he seems to revel in big moments.\n\nFacing Clayton Kershaw in the first at-bat of an All-Star game? How about a big first-pitch swing.\n\nPitching to Mike Trout in the last at-bat of the WBC? A swing-and-miss slider to clinch a Japanese championship.\n\nThe latest example came this weekend, when Ohtani responded to boos in Toronto with his team-leading seventh home run of the season.\n\nGranted, there are still key situations where he struggles (such as his six-for-34 mark with runners in scoring position). And thanks to the Angels’ struggles while he was in Anaheim, his MLB career hasn’t included many high-leverage moments.\n\nBut in a small sample, he hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. And on a Dodgers team with World Series aspirations, the club will need that to translate in clutch spots later this season.\n\nThe bottom of the lineup\n\nWe’ll keep track of this throughout the season, because I have a feeling this is going to be crucial when the postseason comes around. Here are the best and worst team batting averages for the Nos. 7-9 spots in the batting order:\n\n1. Angels, .298\n\n2. Atlanta, .282\n\n3. Milwaukee, .279\n\n4. NY Mets, .276\n\n5. NY Yankees, .272\n\nThe Angels have been terrible this season, but they have the best bottom of the lineup so far. Of course, on Sunday they started a guy hitting .140 in the cleanup spot and the No. 5 batter was hitting .155.\n\n26. Chicago White Sox, .196\n\n27. St. Louis, .196\n\n28. Dodgers, .189\n\n29. Miami, .181\n\n30. Oakland, .166\n\nThe Dodgers are 18-12. The other four teams listed above are a combined 40 games below .500.
