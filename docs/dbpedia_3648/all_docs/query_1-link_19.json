        "text": "PERSON\n\nTui Alailefaleula (2018 by Nick Brodd)\n\nTui was a standout in track, basketball and football at Bartlett High School and competed as an offensive lineman at the University of Washington. He was signed by the NFL’s New York Giants and New York Jets (but never played). He returned to Alaska to play for the professional indoor football team the Alaska Wild and to coach football and basketball at Bartlett. Now he helps out with the little kids’ football team that his sons play on.\n\nTom Allison (2008 by Unknown)\n\nA Su Valley High School graduate, Allison was an all-state basketball, track and baseball athlete. Later he was a professional baseball player with the New York Mets organization and director of Scouting for the Arizona Diamondbacks. (Editor’s Note: In 2015, Allison became the Vice President of Player Personnel for the Seattle Mariners overseeing all the team’s scouting.)\n\n—Submission also received from Patrick Floyd in 2012\n\nThe “Flying Andersons” (2019 by Trudy Sobocienski)\n\nMy father, Ralph “Babe” Anderson and his brother Allan “Eep” Anderson ran the Iditarod Race in the early years. Together, they are known as the Flying Anderson’s. They went through every checkpoint together and in first place, except for Nome. They are Yupuk, Russian, and Norwegian. McGrath is the home of the Flying Anderson’s. There used to be two dental chairs in the Breakers Bar in Nome with signs that said, “Reserved for the Flying Anderson’s”. My Uncle passed on this last year. My father, Babe is healthy and lives in Arizona in the winter and in Nome, Alaska in the summer.\n\n— Submission also received from Alexandra Lyman\n\nMyron Angstman (2017 by Beverly Hoffman)\n\nHe resurrected dog mushing in Southwestern Alaska. He is the grandfather of the Kuskokwim 300, a K300 Champion, and an Iditarod finisher. He made sure a new generation of dog drivers had opportunities to race. If it weren’t for Myron Angstman many of us in Southwestern Alaska would not have experienced the wonderful adventures of running dogs and racing in the many K300 sponsored events.\n\nJody Bailey (2012 by Unknown)\n\nShe became the only musher to complete the Iditarod and Yukon Quest as a rookie in the same year.\n\nJim Balamaci (2019 by Aaron P. Lautaret)\n\nAs Special Olympics Alaska enters its 50th year, no one has done more to promote sport and acceptance for people with disabilities in Alaska. By providing service of excellence to the athletes, families, volunteers and sponsors and by leading by example and teaching awareness and mutual respect Jim touched many lives and continues to do so even after his unexpected passing in February 2018. Jim started out as a Special Olympics Alaska volunteer in 1979, and coached in the 1980s. In 1996, he became the President/CEO of Special Olympics Alaska. Under his leadership, Alaska hosted the 2001 World Winter Games in Alaska, which raised the visibility of the Healthy Athletes Program and School Program. In 2014 Jim achieved one of his most important goals, Special Olympics Alaska Athlete Training Center and Campus with the help of his community, a 28,000-square-foot facility that includes a fitness center, indoor track, multipurpose sports court & classrooms for both athletes & volunteers.\n\nBill Balog (2020 by Bill Hogan)\n\nBill is a Sprint Car Driver who grew up in North Pole and recently became a 10 time champion of the Interstate Racing Association located in the Upper Midwest. Bill has won over 120 feature races during his career including 12 this year (so far). He also has a win with the prestigious World of Outlaws Sprint Car Series. Bill initially raced motocross and snow machines in Fairbanks before turning to sprint cars in 2000. He first moved to Washington to pursue his passion before settling in Wisconsin where he races several nights a week. Bill’s racing nickname the “North Pole Nightmare” belies his quiet, unassuming manner who always has time for his fans and has never forgotten his roots in Alaska. He is without question the most successful sprint car driver to ever hail from Alaska. His commitment, dedication and focus on excellence in his chosen sport makes him an ideal candidate for the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame as well as an ideal role model for young aspiring Alaska racers.\n\nJens Beck (2012 by Ken Winterberger)\n\nA perennial winner or top finisher in local and national triathlons. Jens finished 49th (out of 630 finishers) in the 2012 Xterra World Championships in Maui and was second in his age class.\n\nDorena Bingham *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2007 by Unknown)\n\nThe head coach of the East High girls’ basketball team, she has led her teams to multiple state championships. In addition, she provides opportunities for female athletes to play basketball in the Lower 48 each summer. This gives the athletes exposure to colleges around the country, which enables them to earn college scholarships.\n\nEd Blahous (2011 by Steve Simmons)\n\nCoach Ed Blahous was a pioneer of Alaska high school soccer. Without his leadership, high school and club soccer would not be where it is today. Many Alaska players who’ve had the chance to play college soccer have benefited from this (including myself, as I played at Chugiak High School and now am the head men’s soccer coach at Oregon State University). His coaching principles have remained with me throughout my college coaching career.\n\nSam Bomar, Blake Smith, Peggy Gustafson (2020 by Jenith Flynn)\n\nSam, Blake and Peggy have taught thousands of Alaskans how to play and excel at golf. Some have gone on to be competitive, some have gained a life long passion. Each year, they bring enthusiasm and knowledge to beginner golfers across southcentral Alaska.\n\nTodd Boonstra (2020 by Kelli Boonstra)\n\nTodd Boonstra is not only an incredible athlete, he is also a coach, as well as an inspiration and role model to the youth of his community. A 3 Time Olympic X-Country Skier Sarajevo 1994, Calgary 1988, Lillehammer 1994. World University Games Bronze Medalist in Bulgaria 1983. Four-time Mount Marathon Race Champion and oldest racer to win at age 41. Coached x-country skiing at UAA for 2 years. Todd’s passion for sport has been seen in all he has done for youth in many parts of the state. Teaching in rural Alaska for 13 years, he coached running, Native Youth Olympics, & x-country skiing. During Spring Carnivals in Galena where he lived for 9 years he was in charge of the youth ski & snowshoe events. He organized these events, taught kids to ski & snowshoe, then encouraged all ages of youth to participate. In Galena he designed and helped make a ski trail so they could host WISA (Western Interior Ski Assoc.). AWG ski-biathlon & snowshoe coach ’08&’16. Currently he is coaching in Kenai.\n\nCedar Bourgeois (2010 by Dori Hollingsworth)\n\nShe won the women’s race at Mount Marathon seven consecutive years with some of the fastest times ever. She is a top contender in all mountain races in Alaska and even won a race in California.\n\nBeth Bragg (2018 by David Hulen)\n\nAfter being a cornerstone of ADN coverage for decades, Beth Bragg is retiring as sports editor. There will be time to say more, but anyone paying attention knows the breadth, depth, quality and volume of what Beth does and has done. Consistently well-crafted and human-centered feature writing. Thousands of daily news stories, with her byline and without, many produced on the tightest of deadlines. Championing women and citizen athletes. Owning Alaska events like Mount Marathon and the Run for Women. Traveling to cover FOUR Winter Olympics (Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano and Salt Lake City). But mostly just being there for the community year after year after year, whether it’s the Iditarod or a mountain run or high school riflery meet. Her work is the definition of sustained, high-energy, high-quality local journalism. Small things, big things, middle-of-the-night things, deep knowledge of the community, and just an understanding of so many of the things that make Anchorage Anchorage. And adapting as we’ve changed. Beth is a terrific editor, and again and again has helped others shine and kept things rolling. She will be impossible to replace.\n\n– Submissions also received from Rick Mystrom, Joey Caternichio, Tina Tomsen\n\nBen Brent (2010 by Jim Hadlock)\n\nHe has won numerous world championships in powerlifting and won a world competition at the age of 70.\n\nHolly Brooks *INDUCTED 2018 (2011 by Frank Witmer)\n\nJust two seasons ago, Holly Brooks surprised the international nordic ski racing world, qualifying as a Winter Olympian while still a full-time coach with APU Nordic Ski Center. Holly has a remarkable and uncanny, totally natural and always positive, dynamic outreach beyond her years. She gives energetically and endlessly so much to the community and her ever-expanding network beyond. She motivates both young and old, advocates healthy habits, teaches positive values that matter, and inspires by role model. Her unique combination of talent and personal outreach almost trumps the fact that she is also such an accomplished nordic skier, runner, and sport ambassador. Career highlights include being a 2010 Winter Olympian, 2011 World Championships participant, 2011 U.S. National Ski Champion, Tour of Anchorage winner in 2008 and 2009, and three-time Mount Marathon runner-up. She also received an Alaska Legislative Citation Award for Community Involvement in 2010.\n\nJohn Brown *INDUCTED 2015 (2006 by David Dapcevich)\n\nIf memory serves me, he was the first American basketball player to start on four consecutive high school state championship teams in the top division in his state. He played for the Ketchikan Kings and was an awesome player and a fine gentleman.\n\nRobert (Bobby) Wilber Brown (2018 by Ben Frantz)\n\nRobert (Bobby) Brown was a student athlete at Mt. Edgecumbe High School from 1969-1971. He excelled in cross country running, basketball and track and field. By 1971 Bobby needed two lettermen jackets for all the medals bestowed upon him. Sadly, when flying to attend Sheldon Jackson College on Sept. 4, 1971, Bobby and three other young achievers from Barrow/Utqiagvik lost their lives on the devastating Alaska Airlines crash. I’ve always thought it would be an appropriate and worthy cause to recognize one of Alaska’s best student athletes, Robert (Bobby) Wilber Brown for his accomplishments at Mt. Edgecumbe High School.\n\nStan Brown *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2009 by Gary Brown)\n\nHe brought Pop Warner Football to Alaska in 1997. Pop Warner is a scholastic-based football and cheerleading program that has grown to 1,000 kids from the ages of 5-15 enrolling each year. Stan was born and raised in Alaska and always felt that sports and drama were tools for education that were missing from the education system in Alaska. Stan became a star athlete while wrestling for Arizona State University and contended for a spot on the 1980 Summer Olympics team. Stan went on to coach high school wrestling in the Anchorage area. His death in November of 2007 was a great loss.\n\n— Submissions also received from Arron O’Callaghan, Michelle Laakso and Chad Smith\n\nRed Boucher *INDUCTED 2009 (2008 by Unknown)\n\nI lived in Alaska during the 1960s and 1970s and Red Boucher was directly responsible for providing Alaska residents a professional brand of baseball and introducing many future major league baseball players to Alaska.\n\nJay Caldwell (2021 by Unknown)\n\nRobert (Bobby) Brown was a student athlete at Mt. Edgecumbe High School from 1969-1971. He excelled in cross country running, basketball and track and field. By 1971 Bobby needed two lettermen jackets for all the medals bestowed upon him. Sadly, when flying to attend Sheldon Jackson College on Sept. 4, 1971, Bobby and three other young achievers from Barrow/Utqiagvik lost their lives on the devastating Alaska Airlines crash. I’ve always thought it would be an appropriate and worthy cause to recognize one of Alaska’s best student athletes, Robert (Bobby) Wilber Brown for his accomplishments at Mt. Edgecumbe High School.\n\nMatt Carle *INDUCTED 2020 (2010 by Chuck Homan)\n\nIn 2006, Matt was named the top college hockey player and earned the Hobey Baker Memorial Award. That year he was also named the WCHA Player of the Year and the WCHA Defensive Player of the Year. He also helped Denver University win two NCAA championships. He was selected in the second round by the San Jose Sharks. In 2009-10, playing for the Philadelphia Flyers, Matt helped the Flyers reach the Stanley Cup Finals. Matt has played for the U. S. National Team. Outside of Scotty Gomez, he has the best credentials of any Alaskan hockey player. (Editor’s Note: after 730 games in the NHL, Carle retired in 2016).\n\nJohn Carpenter (2011 by Rick Boots)\n\nJohn distinguished himself throughout his 25 years in Alaska sports broadcasting, leaving a lasting, positive, and meaningful impact throughout not just southcentral Alaska but the entire state.\n\nJohn is the most recognized name in Alaska sports broadcast history.\n\nAccording to Alaska Broadcasters’ Hall of Fame newsman John Tracy, Carpenter was a strong supporter of local teams and athletes and not afraid to point out inequities, unfairness and discrimination in local and national sports. His writing skills were exceptional, and his ability to inject the right amount of humor made his sportscasts entertaining even for those who weren’t sports fans.\n\nMario Chalmers *INDUCTED 2014 (2013 by Jonathan Meyeda)\n\nI am very sad that my favorite all-time player Mario Charmers can’t get in to the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame. He won two state titles, he won an NCAA National Title and now has 2 NBA Championship Titles and helped the Miami Heat win them both. I find it extremely sad that he can’t even get in the Hall of Fame. He has done more than Carlos Boozer ever did and Boozer was not even born in Alaska. That is the sad part. And Mario was Born in Alaska, and played for Alaska, but can’t get no love from his home state.\n\nFred Chmiel (2017 by Joey Garcia)\n\nChmiel, a 1989 graduate of Palmer High School, was an assistant coach for South Carolina University in when it won the 2017 NCAA Women’s NCAA Basketball Championship. He’s also served as a Division I assistant at Temple, Minnesota, Penn State and San Diego State. He was a standout point guard in Palmer and spent part of his college playing career at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nBrush Christianson (2009 by Unknown)\n\nHe was a successful and longtime high school and University of Alaska Anchorage hockey coach. He coached at UAA from 1979-96, posted a 287-229-30 record and guided the team to the 1991 NCAA quarterfinals.\n\nCallan Chythlook-Sifsof (2011 by Tiffany Zulkosky)\n\nCallan has broken through several barriers in her young career. Most notably, she was the first Yup’ik/Inupiaq woman to earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. She competed in snowboardcross event at the 2010 Winter Games and won a silver medal in the 2011 X Games. Callan’s commitment to sportsmanship, athletic excellence, and her career has set her up as a role model for young people in her age demographic, cultural group, and even other young Americans with a unique background. In a state often plagued by headlines of the challenges Alaska Native youth face in rural areas, Callan’s story proves that all things are possible. Although young, she is deserving of the recognition of her peers and colleagues in the sports community.\n\n—Submission also received from Gloria Chythlook\n\nJordan Clarke (2017 by Mike Clarke)\n\nA 2008 graduate of Bartlett High School, he is the state record holder for shot put and discus and led the nation in high school shot put in 2008. He earned a scholarship at Arizona State University, where he won four NCAA Division I National Championships (2 indoor, 2 outdoor) for shot put. He participated in two U.S. Olympic Trials (2012, 2016) and competed in the World Track & Field Championships in Beijing in 2015. He also has a tattoo of the state of Alaska on his shoulder.\n\nDon Clary *INDUCTED 2016 (2011 by Jim Renkert)\n\nDon Clary is the only Alaskan runner to run in the Olympics. As hard as it is to make an Olympic Team in skiing, it’s even harder in track and field. There are thousands more runners in the U.S. than skiers. I ran in races against Don in high school. I saw him set the Alaska high school mile and two-mile record in 1975. His two-mile record still stands (even with the metric 3200-meter conversion). There have been many high school runners that have tried but none have had the exceptional natural talent that Don was born with. And although naturally gifted Don never took it for granted and did the hard work that is required to become an Olympic runner. He respected the gift. A runner of Don’s caliber comes along in a small population base like Alaska maybe once in a lifetime, maybe once in a hundred years. I hope to see another Alaskan runner with Don’s pure raw talent, work ethic and success in my lifetime. I will not be surprised if I do not.\n\n—Submission also received from Kris Mueller\n\nKelly Cobb (2018 by Jo Reid)\n\nKelly grew up playing soccer in Alaska for Anchorage Youth Soccer Club and Cook Inlet Soccer Club before she went on to play Division I soccer at Duke University. Kelly also played for the Under 18, U20, and U23 U.S. Women’s National Teams. She helped the U.S win the U20 World Cup in Japan in 2012.\n\nCorey Cogdell *INDUCTED 2019 (2015 by Beth Bragg)\n\nCogdell is a two-time Olympian who is a contender to make the 2016 Rio team. She won trapshooting bronze at the 2008 Olympics. She’s a five-time medalist and two-time winner at national championships. She’s done a ton of outdoors TV shows and has a pretty high profile in the world of shooting sports. She currently ranks in the top 10 of the world rankings. (Editor’s Note: Cogdell is now a three-time Olympian and won bronze medals in 2008 and 2016).\n\nLawrence Coutermarsh (2018 by Chadwick Atwood)\n\nLarry, of North Pole has completed the Sadler’s Ultra Challenges more times than anyone else. It is the longest wheelchair and handcycle event in the world (typically 357 miles) and often draws top international racers. Larry is also one of the few Alaskans to participate. Coutermarsh, 54, was born in New England and has been living in Alaska since 1983. He was injured while a U.S. Army Ranger in 1985. While he was in the hospital the founder of the Sadler’s Challenge told him about the race. Larry competed in his first race that July using a standard wheelchair. He placed third overall and has been racing ever since, including 1994 when the race was canceled and he rolled from Fairbanks to Anchorage on his own. This prompted a new sponsor to step in. Larry did the event in a wheelchair 14 times and then switched to riding a handcycle.\n\nLance Coz (2020 by Robbie Quelland)\n\nLance E. Coz “Coach” has been the face and leader of the Kenai Peninsula Post 20 Twins American Legion Baseball program for 45 years. He served in every capacity possible, from being the head coach, general manager, bus driver, cook, doctor, counselor, and even laundry attendant for the program. He has been instrumental in bringing four State of Alaska American Legion Baseball titles, 1991, 1995, 2012 and 2016, with runner up awards in 1984, 2008, and 2015. Lance Coz had two former players reach the level of Major League Baseball and had 100’s of players obtaining their goal of playing collegiate baseball. There has been over eight hundred young men who have had the privilege of being coached by Lance Coz. He guided the Kenai Peninsula Boys and Girls Club in bringing indoor soccer to the area, as well as assisted and guided numerous other youth sports on the peninsula with financial assistance and guidance. He served on the Alaska Board of American Legion Baseball in multiple position\n\nNick Danger (2010 by Al Burke)\n\nHe is the only Alaskan ever to wrestle for the WWF at Sullivan Arena.\n\nGrayson Davey (2018 by Lori Davey)\n\nGrayson is 17 years old and has been competing on the men’s open team for trap this year. Grayson won the fall selection match and placed second in the spring selection match in 2018 to earn a spot on the men’s open trap team for USA Shooting. He has competed in World Cups in Guadalajara, Malta, Korea, and Tucson; the World Championships in Korea; and the Championships of the Americas Guadalajara. He won a team silver medal in the World Championships and CAT games, and gold for mixed pairs. He has a qualifying score for the 2020 Olympics.\n\nBrad Davis (2008 by Unknown)\n\nBrad spent two years with the Alaska Northern Knights basketball team. He later played several seasons with the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, where he became the first player to have his jersey number retired. He is also a television analyst for the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nScott Davis *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2015 by Peggy Erkeneff)\n\nHe’s been racing for 40 years, with wins on two wheels, three wheels and sleds. Davis is best known as an iconic Iron Dog champion, with seven wins and 21 top-three finishes. Competing for the first time in 1984, Davis placed second and only missed one raced in the next thirty years. Davis has also won numerous challenging snowmachine competitions from Kotzebue to Valdez. Before he was a favorite at the Iron Dog, Davis competed on two and three wheels in Alaska, California and Washington, with more than 20 state championships in multiple classes. His first motorcycle race in 1972 fueled a lifelong competitive focus, and a first state championship in 1975 on his motorcycle. Eight indoor championships on motorcycles and three wheelers set the stage for a racing career spanning decades and a passion for motorsports in all weather conditions. In 2015, Davis and his partner AJ Bartel finished second in the 2,000-mile Iron Dog. He holds a record seven championships – in 1985, 1989, 1993, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2007.\n\n—Submissions also received from Craig Beitinger, Regina Daniels and Troy Jarvis\n\nJanay DeLoach *INDUCTED 2016 (2011 by Wayland Mitchell)\n\nIn my 48 years of being involved with track and field, Janay is one of the most unique young ladies whom I’ve seen. She came from a high school (Eielson) that didn’t even have a long jump pit, and had to go 25 miles and back each way for four years to work out at another high school in Fairbanks. At Eielson she broke the 17-year-old Alaska high school long jump record and received a scholarship to Colorado State University for long jumping. She was the first CSU long jumper to break the 20-foot barrier with a leap of 20-1.75.\n\n(The nomination continues with a long list of her college accomplishments plus sixth place at World Championships and qualifying for the Summer Olympics).\n\nDon Dennis (2007 by Unknown)\n\nDon Dennis, the general manager of the Fairbanks Goldpanners since 1967, is often overlooked in the formation of the Alaska Baseball League. With the exception of the Goldpanners, he was directly involved with the creation of every single ABL team and deserves proper credit for making the ABL what it is.\n\nRoman Dial (2022 by Brad Mieklejohn)\n\nRoman Dial has shaped Alaska wilderness adventure sports for the past four decades. Roman was the originator and multiple winner of the Alaska Wilderness Classic. Roman was a pioneering mountaineer in the 1980’s with major first ascents in the Alaska Range.Roman pioneered the use of mountain bikes for wilderness travel, and completed a traverse of the Alaska Range by mountain bike in the early 1990’s. Roman was the early inventor of fat bikes for wilderness snow travel. Roman was the pioneer of packrafts in Alaska which led to the explosion of packrafting worldwide.\n\n—Submission also received fromLuc Mehl\n\nHerb Didrickson *INDUCTED 2013 (2010 by Gil Truitt)\n\nHerb starred at Sheldon Jackson High School from 1944-46, Sheldon Jackson Jr. College from 1947-48 and Sitka ANB from 1949-64. Then he excelled in Old-timers/Senior Citizens competitions locally, regionally and nationally from 1965-90. He is a lifelong Sitkan. He chose to attend Sheldon Jackson Junior College despite many offers from big-time NCAA basketball institutions. He was the quickest ball player I have seen anywhere and possessed unbelievable quick hands, long arms and unbelievable jumping ability. He was a terror on defense and was feared by everyone. His defensive skills were as well-known, and respected, as his tremendous scoring punch. Knowledgeable basketball critics agree that he could have made the starting line-up, and perhaps All-American status, of any team in the country. He was performing feats before they became fashionable in the college and pro ranks. Feats such as being the receiver of “alley oop” passes, tipping in missed shots and grabbing hold of the rim from a flat-footed position. He was capable of dunking but did not because it was against the rules at the time. He was the best in track and field (especially distance running) and was a baseball star. He officiated basketball 15 years and was in demand at Southeast Regionals as well as state-wide tournaments and playoffs. When it came to sportsmanship, he was tops. He is today the greatest Alaska basketball ambassador. —Submissions also received from Ernest F. Leask, Sr., Cliff Tagaban, David Dapcevich, and Rich Mattson\n\nMoctar Diouf (2006 by Aurora Hauke)\n\nMoctar has coached his youth soccer team to two state championships and in 2006 was named U.S. Soccer Region IV Adidas Boys Coach of the Year. In addition, Moctar donates his time to refereeing youth and adult soccer games in Juneau while working and attending school full-time.\n\nShannon Donley *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2010 by G.B. Brunner)\n\nShe won the Gold Nugget Triathlon seven times, the Eagle River Triathlon four times, the Fireweed 400 cycling race twice and the Crow Pass Crossing. She’s also a U.S. National age-group champion and once placed fifth in her age group at the World Championships in Switzerland.\n\n—Submission also received by Gillian Brubaker in 2012\n\nPam Dreyer *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2011 by Bob Dreyer)\n\nShe was the first Alaskan, man or woman, to win an Olympic medal in ice hockey. The bronze medal came at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Italy. Before that, she a successful student-athlete at Chugiak High School and at Brown University. She led the nation as a sophomore goalie at Brown in save percentage and was on the NCAA runner-up team. She earned the MVP award at the World Hockey Championships in Nova Scotia, Canada. She continues to be a role model for other Alaskans having achieved success in high school, college and now in private industry. She continues to motivate young athletes by coaching and giving motivational talks to them and others.\n\n– Submission also received from Mark Rowley\n\nMarcus Dunbar *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2012 by Joe Alward)\n\nWithout a doubt, Marcus Dunbar’s 10 victories (in 11 tries) at the Heart Run 5K was a remarkable feat the likes of which may never be repeated. From 1989 through 2000, no athlete put as much into dominating a single road racing event as he did at the Heart Run. To earn victories and set a course record four times is incredible.

Until her retirement, she always was the most powerful and fastest boarder in terms of pure speed. She narrowly missed gold in the Olympics (she was leading at one point), but an Olympic medal is more luck than the World Cup. Rosey also is a warm, charismatic, adventuresome, and wonderful person. She’s come up with some ideas that have brought great joy to many Alaskans. Given a better understanding of Rosey’s accomplishments, there isn’t anyone from Alaska at her level, and it’s inappropriate that she was not in the first class chosen to the Hall. The high profile of snowboarding internationally and in the ski community for no other reason should elevate her accomplishments compared to the other sports which happen to be more geographically limited. Her accomplishments were huge and truly Alaskan in scale. Rosey’s unique contributions in her articles to the Alaska Daily News while she was on the World Cup and to the Slush Cup at Alyeska (a community tradition) readily come to mind. I think she was the original point person and innovator for the Slush Cup.\n\nErik Flora (2021 by Tom Corbin)\n\nAPU Ski Coach. Erik Started Out With a Promising Racing Career When He Arrived at UAA.

His greatest potential may have been in his ability to navigate comfortably in both his Athabascan birth culture and mainstream American culture, which allowed him to bridge cultures and bring Alaska Natives and non-Natives together during the tumultuous era of the early 20th century. The complement of Harper’s superb athleticism, excellent subsistence / wilderness skills, sterling character and charisma, and ability to bring people together make him a great candidate for the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame in my view, in particular because he was a standout in multiple fields.

Dick was a legend in terms of Alaska radio sports broadcasting, a character and a great human being, I so enjoyed listening to Dick do radio play-by-play – with that folksy style of his, he was a great story teller and could paint a picture with words so well that he even made those live-read ads interesting. I got to know Dick over the years as he did some basketball play-by-play for us here at UAA and later did public address for us. He had a great sense of humor and was kind and generous – one of those people you just wanted to spend time with.\n\n–Submission also received from Joe Alston, Kelly Thompson, Nate Sagan, Rick Rydell, Brad Lauwers, Marcus Lewis, Kurt Haider, Jon Dyson\n\nShawn Lyons (2021 by Unknown)\n\nLyons, a renowned hiker who wrote a series of guidebooks about hiking in Alaska, died of unknown causes at age 66.

After recording a mind-boggling 104 points for the East Anchorage Thunderbirds in 1981-82, he became the first non-Minnesotan to skate for the University of Minnesota. As a Gopher, he recorded 146 points in four seasons. He then played five seasons in Europe and two more in minor league hockey Outside before capping his career with five years on the Anchorage Aces.\n\n—Submissions also received from Jennifer Anderson, Rich Ketterman, CJ Watson, Beth Bragg, Nick Flores and Susan and Randy Hinton.\n\nJim Mahaffey *ASHOF CANDIDATE (By John Estle)\n\nPlease think about a suitable way to honor “founders” of sports in which Alaskans can compete at the very highest level. This would include sports like cross country skiing, alpine skiing, mushing, hockey, and others. What I regard as “founders” are people like Jim Mahaffey in cross country skiing. Jim started coaching in Alaska at UAF, then at AMU. He brought the level of the sport in this state to the point where four or five of the skiers on the 1972 Olympic Team were skiers who had grown up in Alaska and who skied for Jim at AMU. In developing a very high level of athlete, he raised the level of competition in the state to where Alaska was as strong as any region of the country – and stronger than most, a position that Alaska has maintained in the 40+ years since. Besides developing skiers, he was instrumental in developing trails that were up to current standards, he was a race official who was critically responsible for increasing the quality of organization of ski events throughout the state, and was a resource utilized by John Miles in bringing cross country skiing and biathlon to the villages of the Bering Strait School District. In addition, he has served as a resource for advice, wisdom and experience for many coaches and athletes for as long as he has been in Alaska.\n\nThe path to excellence traveled by the cross country skiers who have been inducted into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame (and into the Alaska Cross Country Ski Hall of Fame) was packed and groomed by a small number of people, among whom Jim was one of the most significant, if not the most significant.\n\nIt is only fitting for those key people, the “founders” of the sport in Alaska, to be given proper credit, either through inclusion in the HoF or by some special recognition.\n\nI’m sure there are other people in other sports who have done for their sport what Jim Mahaffey has done for cross country skiing. I would love to see either a “founders” category added to the current HoF categories, or some other suitable honor for these people. The founders of sport in Alaska are getting old (Jim is 85+, I believe) and won’t be with us for too many more years. Just in the past three years a number of people in the sport of cross country skiing who had a huge impact on the sport nationally have passed away – and no one recorded their memories. It is important to recognize these people while there are still enough of us around who are somewhat younger, but are still old enough to remember their contributions.\n\n—Submission also received from Judy and Tiger Demers\n\nChristy Marvin (2022 by Becca Moore)\n\nChristy Marvin of Palmer Alaska is one of the best mountain runners in the state of Alaska!! She has multiple wins and has set the record on Matanuska Peak race, Government Peak race, Kal’s Knoys Ridge race, Equinox marathon and most recently Crow Pass Crossing along with many other race wins. Not only is she an exceptional athlete she is an exceptional human being and role model. As a mother of 3 awesome boys she balances their schooling and athletic pursuits all while training and striving to always be a top contender. She has spent years volunteering and coaching in classrooms and as a coach. Christy is a volunteer elementary and middle school coach for xc running, xc skiing, and track. She is also a volunteer coach for Alaska’s elite xc ski program Alaska Nordic Races and coaches athletes during summer training sessions on mountain runs and mountain interval training. Incredibly positive role model for all and a fantastic person to be a candidate for Alaska Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDennis Mattingly *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2018 by Adolph Pantoja)\n\nDennis was a key figure in the Alaska Baseball League: he started the Anchorage Bucs team in 1980 and was the general manager for 30 years (despite battling cancer for the final 16 years of his life). Under his management, Dennis saw 60 players later play Major League Baseball. He was an awesome coach, a man of inspiration, a devoted man of God, and always had the pride of baseball and Alaska through him in every category of life. In every encounter with him personally, I was instantly filled with inspiration and respect for what a devoted man he was. He deserves the honor of being in the hall of fame for all of his hard work into the baseball team and the love he had for everyone around him. The people of Anchorage were impacted by his diligence and love for the game.\n\n—Submissions also received by Mike Marchant, Jeremiah Bartz, Bruce Cech, and Cassidy Gillis\n\nDr. John McCall (2008 by Unknown)\n\nDr. John McCall was a World War II veteran, graduate of the University of Fairbanks, head of the Geology Department at University of Alaska Fairbanks, glacier expert, expert mountain climber, skier and coach of the UAF ski team. In May 1954, he was one of a small team of volunteers that ascended to the 11,000-foot level of Mt. McKinley to rescue an injured climber. No helicopters could reach that altitude so the team had to hike into the area. George Argus spent a week alone in a tent before the rescuers reached him. Even today, the feat is been described as the most daring rescue on Mt. McKinley. McCall Glacier in Alaska is named after him, VFW Post is named after him, Mount McCall in the Brooks Range is named after him. He also led expeditions up Mount Hess and Mount Deborah. McCall died seven months after the 1954 rescue on Mt. McKinley from polio.\n\nGerard McConnell (2011 by Shoji Satake)\n\nGerard was not only a great mountaineer but a better human being. He was the first Irishman to summit K2 and made multiple ascents on Denali and Everest. In his first successful attempt on Denali, he was awarded the Denali Pin. As a resident of Alaska, he was well known within the Alaska climbing and Irish communities. During the K2 tragedy that took his life, Ger refused to descend and attempted to help rescue other stranded climbers. The Gerard McDonnell Memorial Fund sponsors the children of the high-altitude porters who died in the K2 tragedy.\n\nDick McCormick (2010 by Richard Franklin)\n\nDick McCormick coached the first Alaska high school state basketball champions, the Lathrop Malemutes, in 1959 two months after statehood was attained.

He set the men’s American record (since broken) at the 1999 Chicago Marathon in 2:09:32. His personal best in the half marathon is 1:01:07 (Las Vegas 1995), which is easily the fastest ever by an Alaskan. At the University of Montana in 1992, he was the indoor champ in the 3,000 and 5,000 meters. In 1993, he was the indoor champ in the mile with a 4:12 and the 5,000.

Lauren is currently ranked 8th in the UFC Flyweight division. Her story is well known for overcoming a past of substance abuse to becoming a world class athlete, competing against Olympic medalists. Here is a post she put on social media a week ago. “#FBF July 2009 When this picture was taken (Editor’s Note: the picture referenced is not picture here, but one on her Facebook post), I had never heard of jiu jitsu. I’d never seen a UFC. I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and drank a lot. I was not an athlete. 1 year after this photo was taken, I was 1-0 as a pro. 1 year after that, I was 4-0, and I stopped drinking. 1 year after that, I was 5-0, and I signed with Invicta. I had been training a grand total of about 2 1/2 years. And 1 year after signing with Invicta, I fought for the Invicta bantamweight championship and won via TKO to become the first Invicta bantamweight champion, 8-0 as a professional with 6 TKO finishes. 6 months later I made my UFC debut against Sara McMann.”\n\nTim Neale (2011 by B. Campbell)\n\nSince the 1970s, Tim has participated in a variety of sports — mountaineering, cross-country skiing, orienteering, mountain and road bike racing, and trail running to name a few. He’s been a driving force for some of the iconic events and organizations we now enjoy — Crow Pass Crossing, Bird Ridge Hill Climb (since renamed in Bob Spurr’s memory), and Alaska Mountaineering Club and participated for more than 30 years at Mount Marathon. For decades he has worked to educate and share his love of sport. He was also the race director of the World Masters Cross Country ski races. (Editor’s Note: Neale died in 2016).\n\nMichael “Squeaks” O’Connor (2009 by Willie Cork)\n\nIn the field of motorcycle flat-track, snowmachine, motorcycle ice and sprint car racing, “Squeaks” O’Connor stands above all others. A resident of Anchorage since the mid-1960s and a businessman who took many young men under his wing, he still enjoys recreational riding and restores vintage Kawasaki motorcycles. He continues to be a living legend in the racing community.\n\nJim Oksoktaruk (2017 by Keith Conger)\n\nRepresenting the tiny Inupiat village of White Mountain, Jim Oksuktaruk defied all odds by becoming a junior national cross country ski champion. Jim was a product of the ski machine created by Alaska Cross Country Skiing Hall of Fame member John Miles and local White Mountain coach Eric Morris. Their system also produced national-caliber athletes Paul Lincoln and Helen Amaktoolik (Spindler). But it was “Jimmy O” that transcended all. On March 22, 1986, in Royal Gorge, Calif., Jim put up the speediest 7-kilometer Junior II category split in the three-person classic relay. His time helped the Alaska team (with Max Rabinowitz and Robert Braham) capture first place. Two days later, Jim achieved individual gold with a time of 13:09 in the classic 5K interval start race, 13 seconds faster than the runner-up. He finished the competition with four medals: individual gold, individual bronze and two relay golds. Oksoktaruk was also the 1989 Alaska High School Skimeister and led West Anchorage High School to the state title. He remains the only Alaska Native with these skiing accomplishments.\n\n— Submission also received from John Miles\n\nBrad Oleson (2019 by Frank Ostanik/Kevin McHenry/Steve Zanazzo)\n\nBrad found success at every level in his basketball career. From setting the school scoring record in high school to breaking a 30+ year scoring record at UAF and leading them to the sweet 16, his amateur career was remarkable. But he wasn’t finished and had a long storied career winning multiple individual awards while leading his professional teams to championships in Spain. In 27 years of coaching, I’ve never had a better player than Brad Oleson. Brad was extremely talented, but more than anything he was a great teammate. Brad eventually became, at his peak, one of the 500 best players in the world and never forgot where he came from, donating money back to his high school and other various basketball teams when they were in need. He was the consummate teammate and pro. We truly believe it is in the discussion for Brad to be one of the all-time best basketball players that has come out of the state of Alaska.\n\nSteve Page (2010 by Anson Renshaw)\n\nIn the early 1970s, Steve was perhaps one of the best basketball players ever in Alaska. I have heard incredible stories of this legend over the years. He passed away several years ago from a heart attack. His obituary is in the ADN archives.\n\nNancy Pease *INDUCTED 2015 (2012 by Thomas Pease)\n\nI nominate Nancy Pease for her impressive athletic performances in Alaskan competitions, for her little known athletic accomplishments outside Alaska, for her many contributions made to the athletic community outside of racing, and for her continued high level of athleticism that serves to inspire those around her. First, she holds race records in three major wilderness/mountain races: Mt. Marathon, Crow Pass and Bird Ridge. These records have never been seriously threatened since they were set, and some have withstood challenges for over 20 years. Her race performances in skiing are less well known but equally impressive. She captained the Dartmouth cross-country ski team and was NCAA champion in the 5 kilometer classic event her senior year (1982). She was named to the U.S. Development ski team briefly, and she missed qualifying for the World Cup ski team in 1983 by a single place. This was at a time when no organized training and coaching opportunities were available for post-collegiate skiers who did not hold a permanent spot on the U.S. team.\n\n—Submissions also received from Bob Kean, Janice Tower, Robin Holm, Brian Looney and Bill Spencer\n\nDayna Pendergraft (2010 by Jenny Baker)\n\nDayna is president of the Rage City Rollergirls.

Coach Richey built the Juneau Douglas High School football program while battling Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. He died in March 2005. Never did he complain about his personal challenges; instead he inspired all to be the best person they could be. Coach Richey inspired players not only on the field but in the fundraising they had to complete BEFORE they could gear up as a Crimson Bear (the team received no funding from the Juneau School District). In October 2005, Juneau Douglas won the large schools’ state championship. Coach Richey was instrumental in that championship. He inspired, coached, cajoled, lobbied, and nagged all of Juneau to do what it takes to build a successful football program. His vision took years and he did it all for the athletes.\n\nLibby Riddles *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2008 by Unknown)\n\nLibby was the first woman to win the Iditarod.

Joe gives a real sense of being on the trail when he writes or speaks, so much so that you can’t help but fall in love with the magic of the Iditarod. He has been on the trail, behind the camera, written books, been a mushing consultant along with other things in order to be there for this race and its fans. He has dedicated his life to The Last Great Race.\n\nLester “Killer” Leroy Russell (2021 by Kendra Kaderly)\n\nLee Russell was a man of many talents. A hard-working, dedicated and loving man who spent a lot of time building an extraordinary life for him and his family in Kodiak Alaska. After arriving on the Island around age 19, his talent in boxing turned to greatness when he won the 1960’s boxing tournament at the crab festival, continuing to keep his legacy of the man they called “killer.”\n\nWhile in Alaska, he also mastered several other things. He owned and operated the “cloverleaf” boat during the shrimp boom and invested his earnings from that into becoming a land developer on the Island, creating “Russell Estates subdivision” and “Woodland acres 8th addition”. His most prized home was on High Street, consisting of over 6500 sqft of bed & breakfast. A beautiful home where many relatives and family friends resided.\n\nLee was someone to admire, an impossible model of a husband and a superhuman in many eyes if you ask any of his grandchildren. Lee raised many children/grandchildren on Kodiak Island and still to this day, it’s a place that warms our hearts with memories of a GREAT man.\n\nKenny Sailors *ASHOF CANDIDATE (2013 by Mike)\n\nI met Kenny Sailors when he coached the Angoon High School girls basketball team about 20 years ago. His more “high profile” accomplishments were with Wyoming and the Boston Celtics — although you had to pry it out of him. I believe he’s been an Alaska hunting guide for decades. He is a good man, humble and hardworking. I’m not sure how his tremendous national success translates at the ASHOF level.\n\n—Submission also received from Charles Bingham, and Lew Freedman\n\nJessica Schultz (2019 by Michael Tencza)\n\nJessica began curling in Anchorage with her family at a young age, but made the difficult decision to move to the lower 48 in order to compete against the best curlers and in some of the best facilities in the country on a regular basis. Her incredible fitness, skill level, and dedication to the sport resulted in an impressive career: 2 semi-finalist finishes in the US Junior National Championship, 1 first place finish in the US Mixed Doubles National Championship, 2 runner up and 3 first place finishes in the US National Championship, and a silver medal at a World Championship. The pinnacle of her competitive career was when she played for Team USA at the 2006 and 2014 Olympic Winter Games. Jessica has returned to Anchorage and taken a break from competitive curling, but her love for the sport has resulted in several outreach efforts in communities across AK to grow the game at the grass roots level.

Outside the dojo he is a reserved and mild mannered person whom the school district has tapped as high school principal and was recently asked to come out of retirement to serve as a resource aid at West Valley HS. His influence on students is profound and the respect he garners comes from decades of working with kids and young adults. Many of the members of the dojo – now adults are former students of Hanshi and share stories of his positive influence on them, a true testament of his character as many bring their kids to the dojo.

Smith (2008 by Unknown)\n\nIf you ask anyone associated with rodeos who the best bull rider in Alaska is, 90 percent of the time you will hear the name Bobby D. Smith. Bobby was born in Texas in 1959 and came to Alaska with his family in 1977. He competed in rodeos until 1998 and amassed seven state championships. While his feats are awesome there is one detail that makes this cowboy even more amazing. Bobby is legally blind and deaf. He was born deaf and has worn hearing aids his whole life. In his 20s he developed the debilitating disease retinitis pigmentosa. It has progressed and now he is almost completely blind.

The programs she started before her untimely death from brain cancer are one of the prime reasons for the tremendous growth in the Tuesday Night Race Series, which was renamed in her honor a few years ago. Even before Health Futures she was active in local running events and was a driving force in bringing the World Mountain Running Trophy to Alaska.\n\nAllen Spencer (2011 by Chris Prince)\n\nHe has the longest standing record on the ASAA swimming and diving website.

A pair of sportswriters dreamed up the game, which was held on New Year’s Day alongside more traditional contests such as the Rose Bowl. Sturgulewski served as a player-coach for Fairbanks in at least the initial Ice Bowl. As expected, the conditions made it impossible for either team to generate offense, and the Ice Bowl ended in a 0-0 tie in both 1949 and 1951. Fairbanks scored the first Ice Bowl points in 1950 en route to a 3-0 win, while Ladd got revenge in the final edition of the game with a 47-0 beatdown. While little information is known about the Ice Bowl series outside of the final scores, it remains an important part of Alaska college sports history.\n\nBrynn Sulte (2018 by Thomas Hipsher)\n\nBrynn is the 2015 and 2016 Gatorade Player of the Year in volleyball at Dimond High School.

Marcie was also the first woman over 50 to qualify for the Boston Marathon and completed the course in 3:27 in 1975 at age 58.\n\nShe ran nine miles a day in the summer and six miles a day in the winter for years without missing a day. During her 27-year running career, she logged more than 77,000 miles.\n\nIn 1967, along with her second husband, John Trent, and several other Alaskan running pioneers, Marcie co-founded the Pulsators Running Club, whose motto was “Run and Rejoice.” Together they also helped establish the Mayors, Glacier, and Resurrection Pass marathons and numerous other shorter distance races.\n\nMarcie and her son Larry died in the summer of 1995 while running the trails of the Chugach mountains, victims of a bear attack.\n\nAs a pioneer in the running movement, Marcie Trent left behind a rich legacy and to this day is fondly remembered and respected by an Alaskan running community that was inspired by her example of as a role model and her spirit of camaraderie.
