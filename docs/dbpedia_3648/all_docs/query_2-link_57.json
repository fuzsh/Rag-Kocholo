        "text": "Jared Butler (Baylor basketball) and Alexandra Watson (Texas rowing) have been selected as the 2020-21 Big 12 Sportspersons of the Year, the Conference announced.\n\nThe Sportsperson of the Year Awards began in 2000-01 to annually recognize student-athletes who displayed an extraordinary degree of sportsmanship, community service and academic achievement. This year’s winners were selected by a 10-person media panel.\n\nButler served as a speaker at Baylor’s student-athlete unity walk last summer. During his speech, he encouraged his fellow student-athletes to strive for equality and racial justice. He also served as a Sunday School teacher for second and third graders at Waco’s Harris Creek Baptist Church. The junior from Reserve, Louisiana, was a student-athlete representative for the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Oversight Committee.\n\nOn the court, Butler had an outstanding campaign as he led Baylor to the National Championship and was tabbed the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. He became the program’s first consensus first team All-American and was named the Associated Press Big 12 Player of the Year and USBWA District VIII Player of the Year. Butler paced the Conference with a .416 three-point field goal percentage and 2.0 steals per contest.\n\nButler graduated from Baylor in three years with a BBA in management. Earlier this season, he was tabbed the Big 12 Men’s Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year and is a three-time Academic All-Big 12 selection.\n\nIn August 2017, Watson was diagnosed with Lemieere syndrome, a bacterial infection in the throat that led to sepsis and nodules. Doctors were unable to operate on her throat as her heart rate spiked, and they opted to place her in an induced coma for three days. As she recovered, Watson was unable to eat, drink, walk or talk, and she lost a considerable amount of weight. She eased her way back on the water and eventually returned to full workouts in February 2018. After she displayed resilience, grit and determination, Watson became the emotional leader for the Texas rowing team. The team used common phrases such as “This one’s for Watson” and “Do it for Wats.”\n\nHer leadership inspired the team to achieve great success over the next few years. Despite her medical prognosis in the fall, Watson did not miss a race during the 2018 season, helping Texas to a third-place finish at the NCAA Championships. In 2019, she earned All-Big 12 honors and was part of the Longhorns’ NCAA Championship runner-up campaign. In 2021, Watson was named the Big 12 Rower of the Year and helped guide Texas to the first NCAA National Championship in program history. She was a member of the First Varsity Eight that won the Grand Final that secured UT’s first title. Rowing at six-seat for most of the season, Watson and the Varsity Eight went undefeated during the season with victories in all eight races and winning the Big 12 title for a sixth-consecutive season."
