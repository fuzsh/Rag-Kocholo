Duncan\n\nBone Joint J 2018;100-B:720–4.\n\nProfessor Robert Dunn\n\nBorn in Cape Town, South Africa, Robert completed both his under and postgraduate studies at the University of Cape Town separated by a few years of military service as a naval doctor which included time in Antarctica and on a submarine.\n\nHe then embarked on an 18-month spine fellowship in London, made possible by Mike Edgar at the Middlesex and Queen Square Hospitals followed by a year at RNOH Stanmore with mentors Tim Morley, Ben Taylor and Jan Lehovsky. Not only did this empower him with clinical skills but also insight into productive organisation. Ben Taylor’s database was a case in point, and while in the UK, Robert wrote a similar surgical database based on the RNOH model which he still uses today, providing a wealth of research data.\n\nOn his return to Cape Town, Robert established a spine service at Groote Schuur and Red Cross Children’s Hospitals to deal with the overwhelming local burden of trauma, infection and deformity. In 2003 he established the Acute Spinal Cord Injury unit, a regional service which processes 180 cases per year. Based on his fellowship experience, he established a local equivalent that trains surgeons from all over Africa.\n\nHe was an ABC fellow and is an active participant in SRS, AOspine, IGASS and local spine research and educational organisations. He has published on the full array of spinal pathology focusing on appropriate intervention in a resource limited community taking the best from the developed world and applying the techniques with consideration to local conditions.\n\nHe has served in many leadership positions, currently the president of the College of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Treasurer of the College of Medicine and on the South African Orthopaedic Association’s executive council.\n\nIn 2012 he was appointed to the Pieter Moll and Nuffield chair of Orthopaedic Surgery as HOD where, in addition to running the department, he continues to lead the spine service with deformity believing passionately that you can’t talk about it if you don’t do it.\n\nTo balance this he enjoys the outdoors, having completed the Comrades 90km ultra-marathon for the last three years. He also hunts, dives and plays the guitar.\n\nYou can read Robert's latest article here,\n\nSpinal tuberculosis review of current management\n\nR. N. Dunn, M.

His practice focuses on primary as well as complex knee surgery, including knee arthroplasty and sports orthopaedics. He holds a Lecturing Chair at Hasselt University, Belgium.\n\nHis academic career started in 1997 with the public defence of his PhD thesis “Osseointegration in porous coated knee arthroplasty”. At the age of 33, he became the youngest professor in surgery that was ever nominated at the Catholic University, Leuven.\n\nSeveral of the recent insights on knee pathology are attributed to him and his group. His paper on the influence of “posterior condylar offset” was published in The Bone & Joint Journal and induced a breakthrough in understanding the frequent problem of limited flexion after knee arthroplasty. His further work on kinematics of the natural and replaced knee was the basis for many of the contemporary knee arthroplasty designs. His work on patella alta made us understand why this condition causes anterior knee pain, and more recently, his work on the anterolateral ligament and its importance in ACL-injury, has been the basis of an ongoing fierce debate on the international knee scene.\n\nIn his free time Prof. Bellemans is a dedicated admirer of international sports.\n\nHe competed as a sailor in the Barcelona 1992 Olympics, where he represented Belgium in the 470 2-man dinghy together with his brother. Since the London Olympic games of 2012 he is Medical Director for the Belgium Olympic Team.\n\nProfessor Bellemans is the author of a paper in the September 2017 issue of The Bone & Joint Journal:\n\nDiagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with alpha-defensin using a lateral flow device\n\nP.

However, due to a numerus fixus he was initially not selected and became a physical therapist. He worked for one year as a therapist and then decided to try once more to become a physician. He succeeded and started the medical programme at the age of 24 years. After receiving his MD cum laude at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, he could start a research fellowship in 1988 under the supervision of Professor Slooff and Professor Rik Huiskes at the same university. During this period he worked on the development of a femoral bone impaction system, and the principle of the instruments of this technique were designed and tested in the goat. He finished his thesis on this subject in 1994. Together with the Exeter group (Robin Ling and Graham Gie, Exeter, United Kingdom) and Howmedica International this resulted in the femoral X-Change device for femoral bone impaction grafting, which is still on the market.\n\nAfter finishing his training as orthopedic surgeon, he took the opportunity to become a faculty member of the Orthopedic Department of the Radboud University as the successor of Professor Slooff in hip surgery. For many years he worked with Dr Jean Gardeniers on the Hip Unit, promoting both acetabular and femoral bone impaction grafting. He is the co-author of more than 130 journal papers and many book chapters. Initially he did a lot of experimental work, however over the last decade he has become more interested in clinical studies. For his research he received several Awards including the prestigious Dutch Anna Award. Recently, he focused his attention more to young patients who are in need of a hip prosthesis, and he believes that reconstruction of the bone loss, often seen already at the primary surgery in these young patients, is the most important step. In the Department we are now following a cohort of more than 500 patients with a total hip prosthesis who were under fifty at the moment of surgery. Working with enthusiastic PhD students on these projects is very stimulating and we are looking forward to present the data of this large cohort in the near future.\n\nHe has fulfilled several positions within the Dutch Orthopedic Society. He is running the obligatory Nijmegen Hip Course for residents orthopedics in the Netherlands for 15 years now. He is a member of several international orthopedic societies including the International Hip Society. His new challenge is that he is the incoming president of the European Hip Society and will organise the EHS meeting in the Hague the Netherlands in 2018.\n\nIn his youth he was an enthusiastic football player but at the age of 22 he realised that he missed some essential skills. So he decided to start running, and has done ever so since 1977. Every year he tries to participate in the Zevenheuvelen run, the biggest event on running in the Netherlands over 15 km. In addition, to stay in shape, he cycles everyday to the hospital, as Dutch people do.\n\nDr Schreurs is the author of a paper in the October 2015 issue of The Bone & Joint Journal:\n\nAcetabular revision with impaction bone grafting and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component: comparison of the Kaplan-Meier analysis to the competing risk analysis in 62 revisions with 25 to 30 years follow-up.\n\nM.

He took house jobs in Southampton followed by A&E at Luton and Dunstable. He then spent 18 months working as a rather bewildered GP (with no formal GP training) at RAF Leuchars in Fife Scotland. The RAF insisted doctors who intended to move into hospital medicine had to work on a flying station to understand how the Air Force worked, which did not seem unreasonable to Michael.\n\nAfter Leuchars Orthopaedic training at RAF Hospitals at Halton, Wegberg (Germany) and Ely with two years secondment to Nottingham (Queens Medical centre and Harlow Wood.) Michael’s interest in spinal surgery developed while working for Bob Mulholland in Nottingham. During his training his biggest influences were from Colin Campbell, Tom Bucher, Chris Colton and Bob Mulholland. However, he still recalls a lot of the knowledge he acquired on the Neurosurgical unit in Southampton as a student with John Garfield and Jason Brice.\n\nMichael came up with the idea for a medico-legal book while at Ely/Nottingham, although he is still not quite sure what inspired him, stating “Perhaps I was too idle to do proper research”. He pursued the project with Phil Fagg and the first edition was published in 1989 and the fourth, the most recent, was published in 2010. Michael is currently unsure as to whether there will be another edition due to the use of the internet, Pubmed, google etc in medical research today.\n\nMichael began as a consultant at PA(H) RAF Wroughton in January 1989 and moved sideways to the NHS in August 1993 at PMH (now GWH) Swindon. He developed and evolved an interest in spinal surgery with buddy Tony Fogg who tragically died in March this year.\n\nHe continues to specialise in spine, hip and knee practice and is the Chairman of the medico-legal committee BOA. He is also involved in a large equestrian/horse racing practice and is proud to have recently been appointed Trustee/Director of Injured Jockeys Fund.\n\nMichael’s sporting interests include golf (at which he is poor to average) and football (a long-suffering season ticket holder at White Hart Lane).\n\nMichael is the author of a paper in the September 2015 issue of The Bone & Joint Journal:\n\nInformed consent: where are we in 2015?\n\nM.

One of his early mentors was Sir Rodney Sweetnam who stimulated an interest in orthopaedic oncology. His orthopaedic training was mainly in the London region but he did have the opportunity to spend one year at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This gave him the chance to work with some of the doyens of American orthopaedic surgery including William Harris and Henry Mankin. He continued his training as a Senior Registrar on the Kings College Hospital rotation. He did two further fellowships, one in Sydney for one year mainly in orthopaedic oncology and lower limb arthroplasty and then spent time in Bern with Professor Ganz, where he was introduced to the techniques of hip joint preservation surgery.\n\nIn 1995 he was appointed as a Consultant at University College London Hospitals and The Middlesex Hospital. Early on following his appointment, he was largely involved with the London Bone Tumour Service but started building up experience with periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia. In 2000 he was awarded an ABC travelling fellowship. Over time, the influence of Reinhold Ganz on his practice has become increasingly apparent. He has developed a service looking after young patients with non-arthritic hip pathology. He has worked to raise the profile of non-arthritic hip diagnosis and management, organising educational sessions under the aegis of the British Hip Society, as well as other courses putting across the concepts of hip joint preservation and the anatomy of the surgical techniques involved. His current practice is focused on hip surgery, in particular minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy, arthroscopic hip surgery and total hip replacement in young patients.\n\nFor many years he felt that the best way to analyse hip morphology was with CT scans also using 3D reconstructions. A number of research publications have been published in relation to identifying specific aspects of the dysplastic hip and hip impingement using this modality. Current research is to develop more information from dynamic analysis of CT scans, as well as functional outcomes and relation to articular cartilage injury. Mr Witt has had a long experience of performing hip replacements in young patients, including children and adolescents and has published the outcomes of cementless hip replacement in these groups, particularly in relation to ceramic on ceramic bearings.\n\nJohan remains an enthusiastic tennis player and is always delighted to challenge colleagues on local courts at meetings around the world.\n\nMr Witt is an author of a paper in the September 2014 issue of The Bone & Joint Journal:\n\nEvaluation of the magnitude and location of Cam deformity using three dimensional CT analysis\n\nO.
