        "text": "Naomi Osaka is one of the world’s most recognizable and marketable athletes. The Japanese tennis player, who’s lived most her life in the U.S., is a four-time Grand Slam winner.\n\nShe’s been open about her struggles with depression and took a break from the sport starting in 2022. Osaka returned last month in Australia after giving birth to her first child in July.\n\nShe spoke to Bloomberg in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 3 about her mental health and her future on and off the court. The 26-year old has been somewhat of a trailblazer, especially among women sports figures, when it comes to investments. Ranked among the highest-paid female athletes, she’s bought stakes in soccer and pickleball teams and has started production and sports-management ventures."
