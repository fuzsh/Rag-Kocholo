        "text": "THE ATHLETIC\n\nA few weeks ago, my counterpart in Atlanta, Jeff Schultz, had this crazy idea it might be fun to rummage through his list of contacts and send a single text to the various sports people in his life.\n\nHere’s what he wrote:\n\nPlease send me a line, anecdote, or something to illustrate what you’re going through right now.\n\nJeff’s crazy idea made for a hugely entertaining read, so much so that the bosses have asked some of us from around the country to give it a go. I tweaked my text ever so slightly, not unlike how the theme song to a TV show gets a bit of a makeover from season to season, and came up with the following:\n\n“What are some of the things you’re most looking forward to doing once the pandemic has been controlled and we’re able to live something close to a normal life again?”\n\nHaving read Jeff’s piece, I knew this would be a fun assignment. I reached out to some heavy hitters, but, as Jeff did, I wanted my list to be a little quirky and eclectic. Again: fun. What never occurred to me is that the assignment would also be cathartic, as it provided a platform for us to commiserate, to share ideas, opinions, outlooks. It was a vivid reminder of how cut off from our lives we all are, and how detached we are from commonplace, everyday communication.\n\nWhen I texted Billy Bean, the former big-league outfielder who now works in the commissioner’s office, we bantered back and forth about my three Labrador retrievers, Roxy, Lola and Maggie.\n\nI was pleased to inform Gary Tanguay of NBC Sports Boston that it was only last week I watched the hit movie “Knives Out,” in which he appears as a news reporter. He gushed about a sequel being in the works.\n\nBilly Rohr, the former Red Sox pitcher who as a 21-year-old rookie in 1967 came within one out of a no-hitter in his first major-league start, lamented the Mookie Betts trade.\n\nThis was all normal, which means it was as refreshing as a spring day. (You do remember spring, right?)\n\nYet there was a touch of melancholy to all this. As I twirled through my contacts I kept coming across the names of people who are no longer with us. Some were people I didn’t know well but I had interviewed for this or that story, after which I had saved their contact info. But there were also people who had become great friends over the years, people whose very presence brought so much joy to my life.\n\nAnd so before we begin, here’s a shoutout to Pete Barker, Carl Beane, Nick Cafardo, Doc Edwards, Pete Frates, Russ Gibson, Lou Gorman, Steve Harris, Ted Lepcio, John Martin, Johnny McKenzie, Bill Monbouquette, Marty Noble, George Scott, Johnny Pesky, Joe Walsh and John Welch.\n\nI can’t call ya’ll any more, but I know where you are.\n\nSo … what are some of the things you’re most looking forward to doing once the pandemic has been controlled and we’re able to live something close to a normal life again?\n\nJoseph Abboud (men’s clothing designer, prominent Red Sox season ticket holder): I now live in New York, but Boston is my emotional home. And I can’t tell you how much I miss it. The thing I’ve thought about most is when I go back to Fenway Park, when I go an hour before the game and sit in my seat, because I love that place. It means so much to me. I don’t like the term “new normal,” but from the world that I live in, which is fashion, and from all the years of dressing the announcers, what’s it going to look like? What is sports going to look like? How are the announcers going to dress? What’s their demeanor going to be? That’s the world I live in, and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens. Fashion is a mirror of society. We dress according to the world we live in, and that’s going to change a great deal. What are we going to wear? How are we going to dress? Are we going to do that whole social distancing? What will clothes mean? I’m fascinated to see what the sports teams are going to be wearing. It’s a new world, and I hope there’s a lot of better things that we haven’t anticipated yet.\n\nMike Adams (retired Boston sports talk-show host): I can’t wait to be able to play golf, go food shopping without feeling like a zombie, and get on a plane and go see my grown kids. It would be nice to get close enough to somebody to realize that their breath smells haha. It would be nice to be able to share a joint with someone once in a while without being paranoid.\n\nJeff Bagwell (Hall of Fame first baseman): At this particular point, I’m looking forward to doing normal things! I’m really good at social distancing and quarantining, but the choice would be nice!!! Haha! Looking forward to watching the Astros playing with a sense of proving their greatness!!! Despite the turbulent offseason, I believe in them to be great!!\n\nRyan Bamford (UMass athletic director): Hug people. My athletes. My coaches. My staff. My parents. The best connection is a big hug. And I fully realize I might upset some of the recipients!!\n\nBilly Bean (vice president & special assistant to the commissioner, MLB; former MLB outfielder): Well, like everyone else there are many things I have been missing, and excited to resume when this pandemic is safely under control. A few: I look forward to my morning runs in our MLB cities in the eye line of our amazing ballparks. If I can see the stadium while I am running, it inspires me to keep moving!! I also can’t wait to play tennis again with my buddies very early in the morning before going to work. Perhaps most of all, sitting down to dinner in NYC with my partner, at any one of the great little restaurants near our home.\n\nWade Boggs (Hall of Fame third baseman): I was looking forward to getting back to high school baseball, but they canceled our season. Looking forward to interacting with friends again and getting back on the water fishing.\n\nAndy Brickley (NESN hockey analyst, former Bruins forward): Before I answer your question I will say that despite this crippling pandemic I appreciate the silver linings. My daughters, who both work and reside in Manhattan, have been home in Hingham for the last weeks … phenomenal family time. … and using this shutdown to reconnect with friends via text, email and phone calls. As to what I look forward to when we eventually get back to our “new” normal … obviously broadcasting a Bruins game, especially playoff hockey, playing golf at Plymouth Country Club, going to the West Village to visit my daughters, mornings at the beach with my newspapers and coffee. I would love to take in a movie, have dinner in a North End restaurant, go to a game at Fenway. I could certainly use a haircut. All selfish endeavors, but I think that’s what you were asking.\n\nTerrell Buckley (former Patriots cornerback): At the top of the list is going to live sporting events. During this pandemic I have done a lot of things to replace the things I was doing before, but I can’t replace what sports brings to my life.\n\nLyndon Byers (talk-show host, actor, former Bruins forward): Sorry for the late back at you. I’ve been kidnapped by my 10-year-old Will and am now a Teen Titans fan and can’t wait for Halloween. I’ve got my Peeps reaching out to Starfire’s Peeps for a guest spot to surprise Willster as a superhero on his favorite TV show. I’m looking forward to ending the nightly viewing of Dr. Seuss’s “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” I think you know where I am going with this. I’m all good with Christmas but it’s only April haha. I’m also looking forward to live sports coming back so athletes and people can get their jobs rolling again. For everyone to get back to full-time work.\n\nTom Caron (Red Sox pre-game host, NESN): I keep thinking about how much I love to sit on a sunny afternoon at Fenway before the park gets busy. There’s nothing better than sitting in the seats around two o’clock, watching the park come to life. Coaches chatting, a few players coming out for extra work, and nothing blaring over the speakers yet. Over the next couple of hours players arrive in full, the media throng starts to pack in, and fans eventually arrive. But being there before all that is the best. It’s a luxury I won’t take for granted when I get to do it again.\n\nJoe Castiglione (Red Sox radio voice): I am looking forward to being with our children and grandchildren. FaceTime has helped but it’s not quite the same. And of course being at the ballpark and with baseball people even if the stands are empty. I’ve had many FaceTime and phone conversations with baseball people but it’s not the same as being at the ballpark. Also looking forward to the freedom to frequent favorite restaurants and to get back to the gym.\n\nLenny Clarke (actor, comedian, captain of Cambridge High & Latin football team Class of ’72): What I really want to do is go to a Sox game on a hot summer night and just enjoy being in Fenway Park again. Back to basics, just taking it all in again.\n\nBob Costas (sportscaster, MLB Network): When it is safe and sane to do so, I want to hit Little Italy in New York, the North End in Boston and The Hill in St Louis, for as much pasta, wine, and laughter with actual in-person friends as we all can stand. Which by that time should be a helluva lot.\n\nJenny Dell (CBS sideline reporter): I can’t wait to travel and see my family and close friends in New England. I certainly love to cook, but I am looking forward to having a break and enjoying a nice meal and cocktail out at a restaurant with my husband (Will Middlebrooks, see below). My job is to cover sports, so I’m looking forward to having sports to discuss and getting back together with my work family. About a week before the pandemic hit, I was scheduled to go on the road for three months with Victory Pictures to shoot “Campus Eats” for the Big Ten Network. I’m hoping we get the opportunity to travel Big Ten Country and eat at the best restaurants they have to offer. I can’t wait to bring my daughters to the playground and the little gym they love! I’ve never been more appreciative of our nanny, who takes such good care of our girls and gives Will and I a much needed break.\n\nTed Donato (Harvard University men’s hockey coach): What I am most looking forward to when we return to “normal life” is people. Live interaction, conversations, and being able to play and watch sports with others. I’m not one to sit still so being able to interact with others whether it’s the daily routine of going to work or having a cold drink and watching sports with others and having a few laughs. Coming off the Hatherly Country Club, having a cold beverage and watching the Red Sox on TV is something I’m looking forward to.\n\nMike Eruzione (captain, 1980 US Olympic hockey team): That’s easy. I’m waiting to go to dinner with my friends and family and going to play golf somewhere.\n\nJohn Frates (ALS activist, father of the late Pete Frates): On that fateful March day in 2012 when Pete received his ALS diagnosis, the doctor asked him three questions: Does this run in the family? Has he had exposure to metals and fertilizer-type chemicals? And has there been an incidence of head trauma? Ruling out the first two, I began to ruminate on all the contact sports Pete played in high school and at BC, as he did confide to us the many more concussions and “dings” he had received than we knew about. Months later, when we broached the subject of sports as a possible link to ALS, Pete snapped, “Don’t ever mention that topic again, not about the sports I love!” Remarkably, the similarities between the virus pandemic and ALS are eerily familiar. Anxiety and hope for the cure are paramount, and dominate all thoughts. So when the coast is clear and we’re all back to a new normal, I will cherish the remaining time I have enjoying the skill, integrity and joy that the sports world offers, but I’ll be more focused and determined to truly drink in the games — as my son Pete would have wanted!\n\nMike Gambino (head baseball coach, Boston College): I’m looking forward to the feel and energy of a college campus at the start of the school year. Fall teams starting their competitions, winter and spring teams getting full squads together for the first time, the constant sound of the metronome from band practice and the excitement, energy and newness of a new school year and start of a new season. All the sights, sounds, smells of baseball practice. As a coach the games are great, but practice is the best. The time with the team as a whole as it starts to come together and figure out what it is and what its personality going to be. And the time with players individually while they are working through things, struggling, failing, learning, growing, asking, getting frustrated and best of all feeling something click or make sense. On a more specific and personal note: my four-year-old son, sort of out of nowhere in February, as our season was getting going, said to me, “Daddy, you remember last year when we went to the Red Sox and took the train with Nana and Grandpa and our whole family? Can we do that again this year, but just with you and me and no one else?” So, yes, it’s about going to Fenway, but it’s any father-son day out of the house. And whatever my daughter asks me to take her to do with just her, that’s just as exciting for her to do as taking the Framingham line in to Fenway to see Mookie Betts (I haven’t had the heart to tell him yet ) is for my son.\n\nDave Goucher (TV voice of the Vegas Golden Knights, former radio voice of the Bruins): I look forward to going to my gym in whatever form that takes. I’d also like to stop into a couple of my favorite spots after a Golden Knights home game. And, lastly, return to the routine of my job, something that’s been a constant in my life for 27 years.\n\nSean Grande (Celtics radio voice): Being home. Now being home, when my son is here, is the best. But something I miss is COMING home. That feeling when the road trip is over, when the wheels hit the runway at Hanscom. Of course I miss the travel, I’m an institutionalized man after 22 years in the NBA. The planes, the hotels, the restaurants, the road buildings. Telling the story of a season, the rhythm of the season. One of the things you really come to appreciate is having a job that’s different every night … when suddenly every day is the same. But the best part of having to travel all the time, is coming home. The wheels down, the drive home, the key in the door.\n\nIsrael Gutierrez (Sportswriter, NBA sideline reporter, ESPN): Supermarket lanes being one-way is something I can’t wait to see go away. Traffic rules for grocery carts is where I draw the line. In terms of covering sports, I miss my time on airplanes, oddly enough. Sitting, awake, in an airplane seat, is when I’m my most creative, for some reason. Watching a major sporting event at a bar and discussing it with complete strangers, I miss that. Even though there’s an 80 percent chance it won’t be a thrilling conversation, those other times it enhances the experience. Mostly, I miss my flag football games. It was an easy way to stay in shape. And as I head toward my 43rd year, I don’t know how much longer I can hang with these 20-somethings. And there’s a great sense of community in my football league, which is something I can’t wait to have back.\n\nSam Kennedy (president and CEO, Red Sox): Skating at Walter Brown Arena with my men’s league hockey team is at the top of the list. The first post-COVID-19, postgame banquet at T’s Pub will be epic. I know many of my teammates were hoping this hiatus would lead to my retirement, but the time off has only reinforced my belief that that needs to wait a few more years.”\n\nTrenni Kusnierek (NBC Sports Boston anchor): I can’t wait to high-five and hug people. Sports are about emotions and community. Even if we can’t get to the ballpark or arena, we might get to watch games on TV sooner rather than later. We might be watching the games with only a few other people at first — friends, family members — but the love for our teams will be strong. I can’t wait for the day when I can once again share a big moment.\n\nMax Lane (retired Patriots offensive lineman): I just hope things get at least somewhat normal before football season, especially since my son will be playing as a freshman at Holy Cross. Other things … food/drinks at bars and restaurants, a hug and kiss from a woman other than my daughter (I’m single/divorced). That last one is on the lighter side, but serious.\n\nTony La Russa (Hall of Fame manager): Looking most forward to prioritizing “We not Me.” All this isolating time has meant having enough of me, and being reminded of the importance of the “we” in our lives — the relationships, reliances and importance of others. Dramatic recent examples are those in the health care sector, first responders and workers in essential industries. I’m excited to get back to enjoying this country’s “freedoms” to work, recreate and pursue personal interests while being influenced by connecting/contributing to others more than self. Along with the priority of we not me, I (along with friends with whom I frequently discuss issues) are desperately hoping to regain trust and respect for those with the power to affect our lives. Way too often they are focusing on themselves, not the greater good. There is a higher standard that attaches to greater power.\n\nJeff Maier (grown-up Yankees fan who as a kid famously deflected a Derek Jeter double into a home run during Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS): Looking forward to coaching my oldest son’s nine-and-under AAU baseball team!! (Though I suspect they will be 10-and-under when we can actually play again.) It’s such an important year as they learn to pitch and the situations of real baseball. Also looking forward to be able to enjoy family activities again (ie: going to the beach, family/friend cookouts, baseball games, etc). And schools opening back up! Teachers need a raise!!! 🙂\n\nCedric Maxwell (Celtics radio analyst, former Celtics forward): Being around the players … staying at the swanky five-star hotels … smelling fresh popcorn at the Garden.\n\nDave McGillivray (race director, Boston Marathon): I am mostly looking forward to both directing my next major road race and I am also looking even more forward to running in my next road race, especially with my kids. I’ve always felt that the comeback is much stronger than the setback, and such will be the case when all this settles.\n\nWill Middlebrooks (former Red Sox third baseman): I’m looking forward to going out on a date night with my wife. (As in Jenny Dell. See above.) I can’t wait to be able to take the kids to the playground to run out that energy. It’s the simple things I miss. Golf with friends. Work. Watching sports. The everyday things I used to take advantage of.\n\nCharlie Moore (NESN’s “The Mad Fisherman”): When this pandemic is over I can’t wait to shop in the grocery store and not follow arrows to grab an extra stick of butter. I can’t wait to make my way to the bar and order one of every drink they make. I can’t wait to hug every friendly person I see. Hell, I am even going to give a few kisses on the cheek. I can’t wait to stop binge-watching episodes of “Golden Girls.” l can’t wait to have a big cookout in my back yard, go to a few of my favorite restaurants and be able to live in a free country where you don’t have to worry about getting arrested for walking in a park or trying to launch your boat. But the one thing I look forward to the most is turning the TV on and seeing pro sports and no more breaking news reports about COVID-19. That will be a day to crack a bottle of wine and truly celebrate the fact that we won the war and we are now free Americans.\n\nJoe Morgan (former Red Sox manager): Playing golf, brother. Right now I wouldn’t have missed much golf anyway, because it’s been raining so much. Since March 15 I bet there haven’t been more than five days I’d be able to golf. But I’m looking forward to being back out there.\n\nChris “Knuckles” Nilan (Boston native, former Montreal Canadiens forward, Montreal-based talk-show host): First, I want to get in my car and come home to Boston and hug my Mom and Dad, my kids and my grandkids — especially three-day-old Cameron Nilan. Yes, I have a grandson named Cam Nilan. I don’t have a home gym so getting back there is important for me. After that I just can’t wait to go fishing. The season opens soon and I’m champing at the bit.\n\nDave O’Brien (Red Sox play-by-play voice, NESN): Hey, for me: One day, to hear the sound of the crowd again. Don’t you miss that? On a big hit, or a close play. Nothing like it. One day soon, I hope.\n\nBilly Rohr (former Red Sox pitcher, came within one out of a no-hitter in his first big-league start): I’m truly looking forward to: The Sox being on the field (instead of reading how many new cases have been diagnosed). Looking very forward to golfing without this freakin’ surgical mask, and going out for a nice dinner. I understand those are pretty pedestrian wishes, but they’re all things I took too much for granted until they weren’t around anymore.\n\nJohn Sterling (radio play-by-play announcer for the Yankees): I am looking forward to doing games. This was going to be a big year for the Yankees. But on a very personal level, what I’d like to do more than anything else is go out to dinner with my family and friends, and hopefully that will happen soon. There’s one restaurant that can’t be more than five minutes from me, on River Road (in Edgewater, N.J.) It’s called The River Palm Terrace. It’s a New York steakhouse in every way and it’s jammed all the time. Or was. They have steaks and chops and lobsters and all that jazz. I miss it.\n\nGary Tanguay (NBC Sports Boston anchor): I am looking forward to my kids GETTING OUT OF THE HOUSE … my daughter getting her diploma, my son getting out of bed before 2 p.m., and my youngest having actual play dates and not virtual ones. I am looking forward to walks in the woods with my dog Frisco and being social with my fellow dog walkers and not socially distant. I am looking forward to a date night with my wife Randi at a restaurant with a maitre d’. I am looking forward to normal, whatever that is.\n\nLuis Tiant (former Red Sox pitcher): The first thing I’m going to do is go out and buy a $200 bottle of Dom Pérignon and celebrate with my family. And I can’t wait to go to Maine. I spend six months a year in Florida and six months a year in Maine, but I’m still in Florida. I’m staying where I’m at for the time being. Tell people not to try to be too smart. Just stay inside.\n\nMike Timlin (former Red Sox pitcher): Well, this pandemic has not changed my life that much. I stay around the house and do stuff here. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and having cookouts with other people, rather than just immediate family. We have a big pig roast every Fourth of July and I would like that to continue. It raises money for the Angel Fund to fight ALS. We love to have people at our house and I’d really like to get back and stay close to our friends and family that come to Colorado. Also, I can’t wait to go to church. I really don’t mind the YouTube videos but would like to sit next to people and worship the Lord. Peace.\n\nJohn Valentin (former Red Sox shortstop): I think it’s still going to be a little while before things get back to normal. This pandemic obviously puts a lot of things in perspective. How we take life for granted. As far as looking forward to doing certain things when we get back to normal? I’m sure a lot of guys said baseball, right? Well, at least we know sports gives us an outlet to relax and have a beer or two. I’m retired now, so I would say a vacation! Being in the hot weather on a beautiful beach and eating great food would be awesome. Being cooped up in the house really sucks, so getting to go to Hawaii would be great!!! Also, I love to watch football. So seeing how Tom Brady adjusts to his new team and playing with Rob Gronkowski again will be nice to see. I wish him well. Seeing if the Patriots can be successful without Tom would also be intriguing to see. I also like to play golf! I’m not that good so it keeps me very busy on working on my game. I would also like to see my son, who lives in Las Vegas.\n\nDonnie Wahlberg (New Kids on the Block singer, actor, film producer, diehard Boston sports fan): I miss people. I miss attending things like Celtics games, of course, but I miss connecting with people at the games. I miss the hugs, the handshakes, the smiles, the connection, the community. It’s always been about more than just the game. It’s the same thing that my fans miss about going to my band’s concerts. In fact, I’d like to play a sold-out New Kids concert at TD Garden day one, then attend a sold-out Celtics game day two. And I’d hug every single person in the building each night.\n\nTim Wakefield (NESN analyst, former Red Sox pitcher): I’m really looking forward to being able to get back to Fenway Park and interact with the fans before the games. To be out on Jersey Street and hear the crowds start to gather as the gates open and to smell all the wonderful food that’s being prepared. Especially the sausage carts.\n\nSuzyn Waldman (Boston native, radio play-by-play announcer for the Yankees): I am looking forward to not being afraid to live my life, to hug my friends, go to see my friends starring on Broadway, have my house cleaned, my nails and hair done, and not be so terrified of every cough that I take my temperature four times a day.\n\nJon Wallach (part of the Toucher & Rich Morning Show on 98.5 The Sports Hub.): Looking forward to driving to Maine for the day for a lobster and the beach. Looking forward to reducing the amount of times washing my hands each day by about half. Looking forward to getting my hair cut by a professional. Looking forward to finding solitude. Looking forward to each day being different.\n\nMarty Walsh (mayor of Boston): One of the things I’m looking forward to, as mayor of Boston, is shaking hands. I haven’t shaken hands with people or really gone out and politicked in two months. And I can’t wait to get back to seeing people, meeting people, giving someone a hug. Away from my job, I’m praying I can go to Foxboro for the first game of the season. I know we don’t have Tom Brady anymore but I’m really looking forward to sitting in my seats at Gillette Stadium and watching the Patriots."
