        "text": "Roy Carroll The West Ham goalkeeper was collecting balls from a goal during training when his foot got caught in the net and injured his knee.\n\nRichard Wright Wright was ruled out of Everton's FA Cup fourth-round replay at Chelsea after suffering a freak injury during the warm-up. Wright ignored a notice warning him not to practise in the goalmouth and promptly fell over the sign, suffering a twisted ankle. He also damaged his shoulder falling through a loft as he was trying to pack away his suitcases.\n\nRio Ferdinand During his spell at Leeds, the England defender managed to pick up a tendon strain in his knee watching television. Ferdinand had his foot up on a coffee table for a number of hours and ended up injured.\n\nSean Flynn The then-Kidderminster captain suffered a broken nose, busted lip and bruised toes after tripping over his son's toy cars.\n\nDave Beasant The veteran goalkeeper managed to rule himself out for eight weeks in 1993 when he dropped a bottle of salad cream on his foot, severing the tendon in his big toe.\n\nDavid James The England goalkeeper once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the television remote control. The keen angler also tweaked his shoulder when trying to land a monster carp.\n\nAlex Stepney In 1975 the Manchester United goalkeeper dislocated his jaw while shouting at his defenders during a match against Birmingham.\n\nChic Brodie The Brentford goalkeeper's career came to an abrupt end in October 1970 when he collided with a dog which had run on to the pitch. Brodie shattered his kneecap while the dog got the ball. \"The dog might have been a small one, but it just happened to be a solid one,\" he reflected.\n\nSantiago Canizares The Spain goalkeeper missed the 2002 World Cup after accidentally shattering a bottle of aftershave in his hotel sink. A piece of glass fell on his foot, severing a tendon in his big toe.\n\nKasey Keller The American international knocked out his front teeth while pulling his golf clubs out of the boot of his car.\n\nAlan Wright The diminutive former Aston Villa full-back strained his knee by stretching to reach the accelerator in his new Ferrari. He subsequently swapped the sports car for a Rover 416.\n\nSteve Morrow The former Northern Ireland defender broke his collarbone after falling off the shoulders of Tony Adams while celebrating the 1993 League Cup final win against Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nSvein Grondalen The Norway defender had to withdraw from an international during the 1970s after colliding with a moose while out jogging.\n\nAlan Mullery The England star missed the 1964 tour of South America after injuring his back while brushing his teeth.\n\nDavid Batty The former Leeds and Blackburn midfielder managed to re-injure his achilles tendon when he was run over by his toddler on a tricycle.\n\nDarren Barnard The former Barnsley midfielder was sidelined for five months with a torn knee ligament after he slipped in a puddle of his puppy's urine on the kitchen floor.\n\nLee Hodges The then Barnet player slipped on a bar of soap in the shower and wrenched his groin.\n\nCharlie George Arsenal's 1971 FA Cup hero managed to cut off his toe with a lawnmower.\n\nKieron Dyer The Newcastle midfielder damaged his left eye when he collided with a pole in training - ruling him out for two weeks.\n\nLeroy Lita The England Under-21 international damaged a muscle while stretching after he woke up.\n\nMichael Stensgaard The Danish goalkeeper was forced to retire after suffering an injury to his shoulder while he attempted to fold down an ironing board.\n\nDerek Lyle The Dundee striker fell through a glass table in his home which required 16 stitches and he missed his side's Scottish Cup quarter-final against Queen of the South.\n\nDarius Vassell The then Aston Villa striker missed several games after he drilled through his toe nail with a home power drill thinking it would relieve the pressure on a swollen toe. The attempt at DIY surgery succeeded only in giving the toe an infection which required medical attention.\n\nKevin Kyle The Kilmarnock striker spent a night in hospital in 2006 when his eight-month-old son kicked a jug of boiling water over his crotch."
