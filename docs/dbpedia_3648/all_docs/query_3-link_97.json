        "text": "Late Thursday night, August 1, President Biden and Vice President Harris welcomed home Americans freed from Russia in a historic prisoner swap. The White House emphasized Biden and Harris’ commitment to reuniting every wrongfully detained or held hostage American with their families, showcasing a significant diplomatic achievement.\n\nOfficials said a complex negotiation involving seven countries culminated in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, Alsu Kurmasheva, and green-card holder Vladimir Kara-Murza. The exchange, which took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkey, saw 24 prisoners transferred from the United States, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Russia.\n\nIt also took place nearly 20 months after WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian penal colony in exchange for Viktor Bout. “Great day. It’s a great day. It’s a great day,” Griner said. “We’ll talk more about it later. But head over heels happy for the families right now. Any day that Americans come home, that’s a win. That’s a win.”\n\nBiden highlighted the unprecedented nature of the deal, marking the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union that Moscow freed prominent dissidents as part of a swap. In total, 16 people were released from Russian custody, including political prisoners who had endured years of suffering and uncertainty.\n\n“Today, three American citizens and one American green card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza,” Biden announced. “This deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. We’ve negotiated the release of 16 people from Russia, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens who were political prisoners in their own country.”\n\nThe President thanked the allies who supported the tough negotiations, including Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, and Turkey. “This is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world whom you can trust and depend upon. Our alliances make Americans safer,” he stated.\n\nBiden also noted that Harris played a vital role in helping secure the release of the detainees. “They and their families have shown incredible courage in the face of atrocious and devastating circumstances,” Harris said. The vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee condemned the sham trials and long prison sentences imposed by Russian authorities, calling it an “appalling perversion of justice.”\n\nHarris also noted the inclusion of Russian political prisoners in the exchange, emphasizing the United States’ support for freedom fighters in Russia. “Earlier today, I spoke with Aleksey Navalny’s widow, Yulia, to discuss the significance of their release,” Harris said. “The United States stands with all of those who are fighting for freedom in Russia.”\n\nAs they celebrated the return of the Americans, both Biden and Harris stressed their ongoing commitment to securing the release of others wrongfully detained worldwide. “We will never stop fighting for their release,” Harris declared.\n\n“I will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family,” Biden added. “My administration has now brought home over 70 such Americans, many of whom were in captivity since before I took office. Still, too many families are suffering and separated from their loved ones, and I have no higher priority as President than bringing those Americans home.”\n\nHe concluded: “Today, we celebrate the return of Paul, Evan, Alsu, and Vladimir and rejoice with their families. We remember all those still wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world. And reaffirm our pledge to their families: We see you. We are with you. And we will never stop working to bring your loved ones home where they belong.”"
