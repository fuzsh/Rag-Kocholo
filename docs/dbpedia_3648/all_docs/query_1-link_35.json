These individuals must either call the Wiregrass home\n\nor have lived here in the past. Recognition shall come at the annual Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame Banquet\n\nsponsored by the Wiregrass Hall of Fame, Inc., which was established as an incorporation in 2003.\n\nRecognition shall also come through the public display of a picture plaque to be located\n\non the first floor of the Dothan Civic Center. To be eligible for induction into the\n\nWiregrass Sports Hall of Fame, the individual must meet the criteria established\n\nby the Hall of Fame Selection Committee."
