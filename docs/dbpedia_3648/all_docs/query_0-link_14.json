        "text": "I posted this experiment over on reddit over the space of a few weeks but thought I'd post it here in full before I simulate the experiment, It's a long read but hopefully an interesting one!\n\nHopefully, this experiment will provide the answer to the following questions:\n\nWhat if the Premier League was split into 20 teams representing UK regions of equal population?\n\nWhich region in the United Kingdom produces the best footballers?\n\nWhere do the real footballing hotbeds lie in the UK?\n\nEssentially, I’ve split up the UK into 20 equal(ish) geographical regions, with the idea being that each region has a team made up of players born in that region. I’ve used this website which shows the population of each county, I then calculated that each team should be made up of players from a region of 3.26m people (65.171m/20). Teams are filled up with whole counties, except for Greater London which has been split up into 3 regions due to having around 9m people in total. Note: Due to the diversity of the county populations and the challenges of geographically dividing the UK, some teams have slightly more/less than the aforementioned 3.26m people.\n\nSplit of Counties into Teams\n\nHere we have it, the 20 regions have been split up. Team 14 (Greater Manchester) have the smallest population but hopefully the produce of the academies of Premier League giants Man Utd and Man City will come to the fore. Team 6 has the largest population, but it remains to be seen whether this will translate into footballing ability just yet. I have also made some maps using my below-average paint skills to help visualise the split geographically.\n\nEngland Map\n\nScotland Map\n\nLondon Boroughs Map\n\nI picked each team using a database of players from Football Manager 2020. I extracted a list of players into excel and began manually allocating each player to a team based on their city of birth (according to FM). Ultimately, I ended up on a squad of 25 players for each team and have tried my best to allocate an even positional spread throughout each squad so that the AI managers aren’t forced to play any ridiculously attacking/defensive formations. Squads have been loosely picked around current ability, reputation and transfer value.\n\nEach team will be managed by a manager born from the region they are managing. I’ve allocated the manager with the highest reputation in each region according to FM to each team. This will add an extra element to the experiment and will be to interesting to see how much of an influence some of the better managers will have on their respective teams.\n\nWithout further ado, I will reveal the teams one by one below in numerical order (I would also like some suggestions on team names for each region, as I am aware they’re not very creative!)\n\n__________\n\nTeam 1 – South-West - Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset – Population: 3,450,896.00\n\nMedia Prediction: 16th - Title Odds: 350-1\n\nManager – Darren Way (Plymouth, Plymouth U18)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nChristian Walton\n\nGK\n\nTruro\n\nBlackburn\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nJack Butland\n\nGK\n\nClevedon\n\nStoke\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nMax O’Leary\n\nGK\n\nBath\n\nBristol City\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nBen White\n\nD (C)\n\nPoole\n\nLeeds Utd\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nEthan Ampadu\n\nD (C), DM\n\nExeter\n\nRB Leipzig\n\nWAL\n\n18\n\nGeorge Friend\n\nD (LC), WB (L)\n\nBarnstaple\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nJack Simpson\n\nD (C)\n\nWeymouth\n\nBournemouth\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nJack Stephens\n\nD (C), DM\n\nPlymouth\n\nSouthampton\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nJordan Storey\n\nD (C)\n\nYeovil\n\nPreston\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nSean Morrison\n\nD (C)\n\nPlymouth\n\nCardiff\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nTyrone Mings\n\nD (LC)\n\nBath\n\nAston Villa\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nMartin Cranie\n\nD (RC)\n\nYeovil\n\nLuton Town\n\nENG\n\nDan Gosling\n\nM (C)\n\nTorquay\n\nBournemouth\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nJosh Sims\n\nM (L), AM (LC)\n\nYeovil\n\nNew York Red Bulls\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nMatt Grimes\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nExeter\n\nSwansea\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nScott Sinclair\n\nM/AM (L)\n\nBath\n\nPreston\n\nENG\n\n30\n\nXavier Amaechi\n\nM/AM (RL)\n\nBath\n\nHamburger SV\n\nENG\n\n18\n\nNicky Law\n\nM (LC)\n\nPlymouth\n\nExeter City\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nDominic Gape\n\nDM, M (C )\n\nWeymouth\n\nWycombe Wanderers\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nRyan Leonard\n\nM (C)\n\nPlymouth\n\nMillwall\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nAshley Barnes\n\nAM (L), ST (C)\n\nBath\n\nBurnley\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nIsaac Vassell\n\nAM (RL), ST (C)\n\nTruro\n\nCardiff\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nKieffer Moore\n\nST (C)\n\nTorquay\n\nWigan\n\nWAL\n\n26\n\nOllie Watkins\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nNewton Abbot\n\nBrentford\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nSam Gallagher\n\nAM (R), ST (C)\n\nExeter\n\nBlackburn\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nA region famous for Pasties, Cheese and Cider, the South West has brought to the nation many good things but unfortunately footballers (and managers) don’t seem to follow that trend. I had to search long and hard to find a manager that was born in this region. I eventually found Darren Way, who according to FM is the current Plymouth Argyle U18 Manager who recently had a spell in charge of League Two side Yeovil Town. Predicted to be in the bottom five come the end of the season, this squad seems like it will need a manager with a bit more experience to do anything of note.\n\nThe squad lacks all round quality, especially fullbacks, let’s hope Darren Way is impartial to a 3 at the back system. Stand out players include Leeds United defender Ben White who has had a great season in the championship this year, Tyrone Mings, who has recently won his first England caps and Austrian U20 capped Burnley striker Ashley Barnes who looks like the best attacking option in the side.\n\nAmongst the rest of the team, Scott Sinclair will occupy the flanks and will be hoping to re-ignite the success he had at Swansea back in the 2011/12 season. Jack Butland will be competing for the number one shirt, who along with Tyrone Mings, shares the squads total England caps (10) between them. The team also some exciting young talent in Ethan Ampadu and Xavier Amaechi, who are both currently learning their trade in the Bundesliga.\n\nI am not hopeful for this team, considering the lack of top players and with the inexperienced Darren Way in charge but I’m hoping he can prove me wrong!\n\n__________\n\nTeam 2 – South-East - East Sussex, West Sussex, Kent – Population: 3,495,475\n\nMedia Prediction: 20th - Title Odds: 600-1\n\nManager: Lee Johnson (Newmarket, Bristol City)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nSam Walker\n\nGK\n\nGravesend\n\nReading\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nJoe Day\n\nGK\n\nBrighton\n\nCardiff City\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nPaul Jones\n\nGK\n\nMaidstone\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nENG\n\n33\n\nLewis Dunk\n\nD (C)\n\nBrighton\n\nBrighton\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nSteve Cook\n\nD (RC)\n\nHastings\n\nBournemouth\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nAdam Webster\n\nD (C)\n\nChichester\n\nBrighton\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nJoel Ward\n\nD (RL)\n\nChichester\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nGrant Hall\n\nD (C)\n\nBrighton\n\nQPR\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nTommy Elphick\n\nD (C)\n\nBrighton\n\nHuddersfield\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nChris Solly\n\nD ( R)\n\nChatham\n\nCharlton\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nGeorge Cox\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nWorthing\n\nBrighton\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nSam McCallum\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nCanterbury\n\nNorwich City\n\nENG\n\n18\n\nSolly March\n\nM (RL), AM (RLC)\n\nEastbourne\n\nBrighton\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nLuke Freeman\n\nM/AM (RLC)\n\nDartford\n\nSheffield United\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nHarrison Reed\n\nDM, M (RC)\n\nWorthing\n\nFulham\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nJonny Williams\n\nM/AM (LC)\n\nTunbridge Wells\n\nCharlton\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nGareth Barry\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nHastings\n\nWest Brom\n\nENG\n\n38\n\nGeorge Boyd\n\nDM, M (RLC), AM ( C)\n\nChatham\n\nPeterborough\n\nENG\n\n33\n\nRobbie Burton\n\nM/AM (C )\n\nGravesend\n\nDinamo Zagreb\n\nWAL\n\n18\n\nGeorge Thorne\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nChatham\n\nOxford United\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nConor Chaplin\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C )\n\nWorthing\n\nBarnsley\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nJames Norwood\n\nST (C )\n\nEastbourne\n\nIpswich\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nConor Washington\n\nAM (RL), ST (C )\n\nChatham\n\nHearts\n\nNIR\n\n27\n\nMatt Godden\n\nST (C )\n\nCanterbury\n\nCoventry\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nJohn Akinde\n\nST (C )\n\nGravesend\n\nGillingham\n\nENG\n\n30\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nUp next, we have the combined counties of Sussex and Kent, the South East of England. Taking the reigns is Lee Johnson, current Bristol City manager, who has done well in recent years in the championship. However, in terms of ability it doesn’t get much worse. The media have predicted them to be rock bottom at the end of the season and have offered odds of 600-1 for a title win for Lee Johnson’s men.\n\nThe squad does boast the experience of Gareth Barry, who is the record all-time premier league appearance maker (653) and has also been capped 53 times by his country will be a frontrunner for captain duties. Sunderland ‘til I die fan favourite Jonny Williams makes an appearance in midfield along with Solly March who looks to be the most promising player in the final third.\n\nThe goalkeeper spot looks to be an issue with not one of the three goalkeepers being the first-choice keeper in their respective championship club sides. However, the Brighton duo of Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster look to be a solid partnership at the back and will be hoping to limit the amount of shots at goal.\n\nWith weaknesses in Goal and up front the media’s prediction is probably warranted, Lack of goals looks to be a big worry with none of the forwards seeming to have top-level experience. I would be impressed with Lee Johnson if he could lead the South-East to safety with the resources at his disposal.\n\n__________\n\nTeam 3 – South Coast - Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Surrey – Population: 3,135,638\n\nMedia Prediction: 8th - Title Odds: 30-1\n\nManager: Neal Ardley (Epsom, Notts County)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nAlex McCarthy\n\nGK\n\nGuildford\n\nSouthampton\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nNeil Etheridge\n\nGK\n\nFleet\n\nCardiff\n\nPHI\n\n29\n\nSimon Moore\n\nGK\n\nIsle of Wight\n\nSheffield United\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nCalum Chambers\n\nD (RC), DM\n\nPortsmouth\n\nArsenal\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nMatthew Targett\n\nD/WB/M (L)\n\nEastleigh\n\nAston Villa\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nJack Whatmough\n\nD (C)\n\nGosport\n\nPortsmouth\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nLee Brown\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nFarnborough\n\nPortsmouth\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nJason McCarthy\n\nD (RC)\n\nSouthampton\n\nMillwall\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nEthan Laird\n\nD/WB (RL)\n\nBasingstoke\n\nMan United\n\nENG\n\n17\n\nJack Hobbs\n\nD (C)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nENG\n\n30\n\nJoe Partington\n\nD (RC)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nEastleigh\n\nWAL\n\n29\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n\nM (RC), AM (RLC)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nLiverpool\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nMason Mount\n\nM (C), AM (LC)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nChelsea\n\nENG\n\n20\n\nJames Ward-Prowse\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nSouthampton\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nWill Hughes\n\nDM, M/AM (RC)\n\nWeybridge\n\nWatford\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nTom Cleverley\n\nM/AM (C)\n\nBasingstoke\n\nWatford\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nMatt Ritchie\n\nD/WB (L), M/AM (RL)\n\nGosport\n\nNewcastle\n\nSCO\n\n29\n\nJoe Ralls\n\nM (LC)\n\nAldershot\n\nCardiff\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nConor Gallagher\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nEpsom\n\nSwansea\n\nENG\n\n19\n\nMarlon Pack\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nCardiff\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nJohn Swift\n\nM/AM (C)\n\nPortsmouth\n\nReading\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nDanny Ings\n\nST (C)\n\nWinchester\n\nSouthampton\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nLyle Taylor\n\nAM (R), ST (C)\n\nStaines-upon-Thames\n\nCharlton\n\nMSR\n\n29\n\nLukas Jutkiewicz\n\nST (C)\n\nSouthampton\n\nBirmingham\n\nENG\n\n30\n\nSam Vokes\n\nST (C)\n\nNew Milton\n\nStoke\n\nWAL\n\n29\n\nLikely Starting 11\n\nSouth Coast is managed by former Wimbledon and Watford winger Neal Ardley, current manager of National League side Notts County.

England Internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mason Mount have genuine quality in the midfield and will be hoping to create the supply for Danny Ings to grab plenty of goals. However, In defence, Calum Chambers is the stand out player out of an average bunch.\n\nNeil Etheridge, who qualifies for the Philippines by virtue of his Filipino mother will compete with Southampton number one, Alex McCarthy for the starting keeper spot.\n\nDescribed as a ‘fairly determined’ squad, South Coast have a lot of industry in the team with players like Matt Ritchie, James Ward-Prowse and Tom Cleverley and will be hoping that this translates on to the pitch with some good performances.\n\nThe overall verdict in this squad is that they have enough ability and experience to finish the top half and could even push top four in my opinion.\n\n__________\n\nTeam 4 – London 1 - London Boroughs: Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth, Islington, Camden, Brent, Ealing, Hounslow, Richmond upon Thames, Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Sutton, Croydon – Population: 3,369,408\n\nMedia Prediction: 6th - Title Odds: 9-1\n\nManager: Roy Hodgson (Croydon, Crystal Palace)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nJamal Blackman\n\nGK\n\nCroydon\n\nBristol Rovers\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nFreddie Woodman\n\nGK\n\nLondon\n\nSwansea\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nJames Shea\n\nGK\n\nLondon\n\nLuton Town\n\nENG\n\n28\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\n\nD/WB (R)\n\nCroydon\n\nMan Utd\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nLuke Shaw\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nKingston upon Thames\n\nMan Utd\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nRyan Sessegnon\n\nD/WB/M/AM (L)\n\nLondon\n\nTottenham\n\nENG\n\n19\n\nMax Aarons\n\nD/WB (R)\n\nLondon\n\nNorwich\n\nENG\n\n19\n\nRyan Fredericks\n\nD/WB/M/AM (R)\n\nLondon\n\nWest Ham\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nChris Mepham\n\nD (C)\n\nLondon\n\nBournemouth\n\nWAL\n\n21\n\nJake Clarke-Salter\n\nD (C)\n\nCarshalton\n\nBirmingham\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nSteven Caulker\n\nD (C)\n\nFeltham\n\nAlanyaspor\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nMichael Mancienne\n\nD (C), DM\n\nIsleworth\n\nNew England Revolution\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi\n\nAM (RLC)\n\nLondon\n\nChelsea\n\nENG\n\n18\n\nJack Cork\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nCarshalton\n\nBurnley\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nDeclan Rice\n\nD (C), DM, M (C)\n\nLondon\n\nWest Ham\n\nENG\n\n20\n\nMichail Antonio\n\nM/AM (R)\n\nLondon\n\nWest Ham\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nBukayo Saka\n\nAM (RL)\n\nLondon\n\nArsenal\n\nENG\n\n17\n\nEmile Smith Rowe\n\nM (RL), AM (RLC)\n\nLondon\n\nHuddersfield\n\nENG\n\n18\n\nSteven Alzate\n\nM/AM (C)\n\nLondon\n\nBrighton\n\nCOL\n\n20\n\nJosh Murphy\n\nAM (RL)\n\nLondon\n\nCardiff\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nPatrick Roberts\n\nAM (RLC)\n\nKingston upon Thames\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nAdemola Lookman\n\nM/AM (RL), ST (C)\n\nLondon\n\nRB Leipzig\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nLewis Grabban\n\nST (C)\n\nCroydon\n\nNottm Forest\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nSone Aluko\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nHounslow\n\nReading\n\nNGA\n\n30\n\nHal Robson-Kanu\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nLondon\n\nWest Brom\n\nWAL\n\n30\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nThe first of the three London teams, which spans most of south and west London is managed by Crystal Palace’s Roy Hodgson. Roy has been a football manager since 1976 and has a wealth of experience to draw upon, including a four-year spell as manager of his country. Despite being at the ripe old age of 72, Roy isn’t the oldest manager in the league..\n\nThe squad, tipped by the media to finish 6th, is an exciting young squad with plenty of players tipped to be a big part of England’s future.\n\nPremier League loanees Freddie Woodman and Jamal Blackman (who is currently playing at Bristol Rovers on his 7th successive year out on loan from Chelsea) will compete for the starting keeping berth.\n\nMan Utd fullbacks Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka will almost certainly occupy their respective positions and will hope to offer an attacking outlet bombing on from their full back positions. One of England’s one cap wonder’s Steven Caulker, who currently plays for Turkish outfit Alanyaspor also makes an appearance in defence.\n\nIn midfield, Declan Rice and Callum Hudson Odoi, both recently capped by England are the strengths which the team will rely on whilst fellow youngsters Ademola Lookman and Steven Alzate who has twice been capped for Colombia will also be looking to make an impact.\n\nIn Attack, Euro 2016 hero Thomas Henry Alex (Hal) Robson-Kanu, Sone Aluko and Lewis Grabban will all fancy themselves to start.\n\nThe youthful squad will bring a lot of pace and energy to the league and Roy Hodgson will be hoping for a top six finish at minimum. I think the squad has enough depth and quality to potentially go all the way.\n\n__________\n\nTeam 5 – London 2 - London Boroughs: City of London, Lambeth, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Bromley, Lewisham, Greenwich, Bexley, Havering, Barking and Dagenham, Newham– Population: 3,009,408\n\nMedia Prediction: 1st- Title Odds: 4-1\n\nManager: Chris Hughton (Forest Gate, Unemployed)\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nThe Media’s favourites, made up of London Boroughs including and east of City of London is the 2nd smallest in terms of catchment area but certainly doesn’t lack quality. Ex-Brighton manager Chris Hughton is in the dugout and has a strong team which looks to have Premier League level quality all round apart from maybe in the goalkeeper position in which Fulham’s Marcus Bettinelli appears to be the likely candidate to start.\n\nAn all premier league back four consisting of Nathaniel Clyne, Joe Gomez, Chris Smalling and Ryan Bertrand, share 74 England caps between them look to be solid partnership and will be hoping to keep as many clean sheets as possible in order to be in with a chance in the title race.\n\nKey man, Jadon Sancho, one of, if not the most exciting player in the league, will be hoping to chip in with as many goals and assists as possible from wherever Chris Hughton deploys him. Jadon has 14 goals and 15 assists in 21 starts this year in the Bundesliga and should be uncontrollable for some of the defences he will be up against. Talented Ruben Loftus-Cheek will be hoping to remain injury free throughout the season and make a good partnership with Jonjo Shelvey who will be looking to dictate play in the middle of the park.\n\nBradley Dack, who according to FM is likely to play off Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham will be looking to provide enough chances for Tammy who should have enough with the level of creative quality surrounding him.\n\nOverall, A very strong team who will be hoping to keep Jadon Sancho injury free all season. Probably rightly favourites for the title, however, will face tough opposition from some of the teams yet to come…\n\n___________\n\nTeam 6 – London 3 & Herts - Hertfordshire and London Boroughs: Redbridge, Waltham Forest, Haringey, Enfield, Barnet, Harrow, – Population: 3,450,896\n\nMedia Prediction: 4th - Title Odds: 7-1\n\nManager – Gareth Southgate (Watford, England)\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nEngland’s hero of the summer of 2018, Gareth Southgate, takes charge of this side. Reaching the semis at the 2018 World cup is Gareth’s best achievement to date which arguably could have been seen as underachievement with the Fixtures and Squad England had. One of the more experienced managers in the league, Gareth will be familiar to plenty of the England boys in the Squad. Tipped to finish in the top 4, Southgate will be hoping to have a crack at his first trophy in (hypothetical) management.\n\nSpearheading the attack is Spurs’ Harry Kane, who is the highest rated player in the competition based on FM current ability. Kane will be a major threat to any defence he faces and is likely to be favourite for the golden boot. Behind Kane, the duo of Adam Lallana and Andros Townsend will offer some threat and creativity and will be hoping to feed Kane with an endless supply of chances.\n\nJack Wilshere, who is probably best known for being the most injury prone player in the league will be hoping to stay fit throughout and make an impact whilst talented young midfielder Harry Winks will sit in front of the back four and dictate the tempo.\n\nIn defence, there is a mix of youth and experience. Young defenders Reece James and Kyle Walker-Peters are joined by 39-time England capped Ashley Young who is currently playing his trade in Milan. Two from Mariappa, Mawson and Clark will occupy the central defender position assuming Southgate plays with a back four.\n\nYet again for another team, the Goalkeeper position is a worry. David Button who is currently second choice for Brighton will likely start although it could be a toss-up between any of the three below-average stoppers.\n\nI have high hopes for this team, if Kane remains injury-free they will surely be in and around the title race.\n\nTeam 7 – South-West Midlands - Berkshire, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire – Population: 3,661,711\n\nMedia Prediction: 18th - Title Odds: 500-1\n\nManager – Brian McDermott (Slough, Unemployed)\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nThe largest team by population out of the 20, South-West Midlands was the only way I could describe this group of counties (very uncreative, I know). Despite having the biggest catchment area of all the clubs, this doesn’t seem to translate to having the biggest impact on the pitch. Out of the 25 players, only 5 are currently playing in the top flight. Brian McDermott has been given the job of managing this team in the experiment, who has surprisingly been out of a job since May 2016 when he had his second stint as Reading manager which lasted only 6 months before he was sacked.\n\nWith 87 England caps between them Theo Walcott and Eric Dier will look to provide leadership in a team which lacks quality all over the pitch. Eric Dier interestingly is predicted to start in defence for McDermott’s men. One of Leicester’s surprise title winners, Andy King adds to the experience but apart from the 3 mentioned players, this appears to be a fairly inexperienced squad.\n\nDom Solanke, who was tipped for big things only a few years ago will likely partner Walcott upfront in a pacey duo. Charlie Austin will also be in the mix and will likely chip in with a few goals over the season. Matty Cash has a lot of potential and will add value to the team whether he plays at fullback or on the right side of midfield.\n\nThis is another team which is lacking a top keeper, Jojo Wollacott is predicted to start. Wollacott has only managed 9 appearances this season at Forest Green Rovers so it doesn’t bode well for the defence in front of him.\n\nOverall, it doesn’t look great for this team, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this team in and around the bottom 3 come the end of the season especially with a worrying lack of quality in goal.\n\nTeam 8 – South-East Midlands - Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire– Population: 3,051,792\n\nMedia Prediction: 14th - Title Odds: 200-1\n\nManager – Sean Dyche (Kettering, Burnley)\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nAnother team with an uncreative name, apologies again to anyone from this region. Team 8 consists of counties Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire and will be managed by Sean Dyche. Expect a mix of deep croaky touchline shouts, direct football and hard work on the pitch. Dyche is experienced at the top level having managed in the premier league for 5 of the last 6 seasons and has even guided Burnley to the Europa League, albeit losing in the Playoff round to Olympiacos.\n\nJohn Ruddy, born in St Ives, will challenge Newcastle ‘keeper Karl Darlow for the starting berth in net. More strength in depth than most of the teams in the experiment in terms of the goalkeeper position.\n\nIn defence, Ben Chilwell is the standout player and will look to bomb up the left flank and create a supply of chances for the team. On the other side Sheffield United’s George Baldock will hope to do the same, as he has done for Chris Wilders men all season. Luton native Charlie l’Anson, who rather amusingly is known in Spain simply as Charlie is currently playing for Rayo Majadahonda in Spain, Sean Dyche will no doubt remind him to keep it simple at the back.\n\nMilton Keynes born Dele Alli features in midfield and looks to be the best player in terms of ability in the team. Dyche will build the attack around Dele and will be hopeful he can provide a big impact and re-discover his form from the 2016/17 season by chipping in with plenty of goals. Chelsea duo Lewis Baker and Izzy Brown will be on the fringes of the team and will both be hoping to showcase their potential to Dyche.\n\nIf Dele plays in a deeper role, Irish internationals Callum Robinson and Sean Maguire, who incidentally both play club football together at Preston, will make a claim to start up front.\n\nDespite being predicted to finish 14th, I can’t tell much difference between this team and the previous one who were predicted to finish 18th. I’d be surprised if this team does anything of note, although Sean Dyche can get the best out of his players that’s for sure.\n\n__________\n\nTeam 9 – East Anglia – Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk - Population: 3,457,571\n\nMedia Prediction: 17th - Title Odds: 400-1\n\nManager – Paul Warne (Norwich, Rotherham United)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nNick Pope\n\nGK\n\nNewmarket\n\nBurnley\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nAngus Gunn\n\nGK\n\nNorwich\n\nSouthampton\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nJed Steer\n\nGK\n\nNorwich\n\nAston Villa\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nJames Tomkins\n\nD (RC)\n\nBasildon\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nENG\n\n30\n\nRyan Bennett\n\nD (C)\n\nThurrock\n\nLeicester\n\nENG\n\n29\n\nSam Byram\n\nD (RL), M/AM (R)\n\nThurrock\n\nNorwich\n\nENG\n\n25\n\nDominic Iorfa\n\nD (RC), WB (R)\n\nSouthend-on-Sea\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nMatt Clarke\n\nD (LC)\n\nIpswich\n\nDerby County\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nCameron Carter-Vickers\n\nD (C)\n\nSouthend-on-Sea\n\nLuton Town\n\nUSA\n\n21\n\nMichael Morrison\n\nD (C)\n\nHaverhill\n\nReading\n\nENG\n\n31\n\nCharlie Daniels\n\nD (L)\n\nHarlow\n\nBournemouth\n\nENG\n\n32\n\nMorgan Fox\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nChelmsford\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nLuke Woolfenden\n\nD (RC)\n\nIpswich\n\nIpswich Town\n\nENG\n\n20\n\nTodd Cantwell\n\nM/AM (RLC)\n\nNorwich\n\nNorwich\n\nENG\n\n21\n\nIsaac Hayden\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nChelmsford\n\nNewcastle\n\nENG\n\n24\n\nAlex Pritchard\n\nAM (RLC)\n\nOrsett\n\nHuddersfield\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nJosh Cullen\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nSouthend-on-Sea\n\nCharlton\n\nIRL\n\n23\n\nFlynn Downes\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nBrentwood\n\nIpswich Town\n\nENG\n\n20\n\nTom Adeyemi\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nNorwich\n\n-\n\nENG\n\n27\n\nJoe Morrell\n\nM (C )\n\nIpswich\n\nBristol City\n\nWAL\n\n23\n\nJoe Ward\n\nD/WB/AM (RL)\n\nChelmsford\n\nPeterborough United\n\nENG\n\n23\n\nIan Henderson\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C )\n\nNorwich\n\nRochdale\n\nENG\n\n34\n\nMacauley Bonne\n\nAM (RL), ST (C )\n\nIpswich\n\nCharlton\n\nZIM\n\n23\n\nCharlie Brown\n\nST (C )\n\nIpswich\n\nChelsea\n\nENG\n\n19\n\nChris Martin\n\nST (C )\n\nLowestoft\n\nDerby County\n\nSCO\n\n30\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nThe trio of counties of Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk make up the next team. Another team which aren’t predicted to fair well in the season, Team 9 will be managed by Paul Warne, who currently manages League 1 Rotherham United. Warne has had a great season so far and could well take the Millers back into the championship.\n\nOnto the players, Nick Pope is the standout player in an extremely average bunch of players. Pope is likely to have a hard season ahead of him with the amount of chances the team could concede. Alongside the only England International, Pope, the squad also features three players who have been capped by USA, Zimbabwe and Scotland. Angus Gunn and Jed Steer make up the goalkeeping contingent.\n\nStand out players in defence include James Tomkins and Ryan Bennett who are no stranger to playing in the top flight. Spurs’ 8-time USA international Cameron Carter-Vickers who is currently on loan at championship side Luton Town also makes an appearance along with Sam Byram and Charlie Daniels in the fullback roles.\n\nTalented young player Todd Cantwell will provide the flair and creativity, alongside Isaac Hayden who will help to add a bit of balance to Paul Warne’s midfield. Apart from that, there isn’t much to shout about for the East Anglians. Chris Martin, who has been capped 17 times for Scotland at senior international level will probably play upfront with there seemingly being a huge deficit of quality in the attacking areas for this side. Goals will surely be a worry for Paul Warne, I think the only chance this team stays up is Nick Pope having a great season.\n\n___________\n\nTeam 10 – Wales & Hereford – Wales, Herefordshire – Population: 3,169,324\n\nMedia Prediction: 12th – Title Odds: 100-1\n\nManager – Tony Pulis (Newport, West Brom)\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nBirth City\n\nClub\n\nNat\n\nAge\n\nDanny Ward\n\nGK\n\nWrexham\n\nLeicester\n\nWAL\n\n26\n\nWayne Hennessey\n\nGK\n\nLlangefni\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nWAL\n\n32\n\nLee Burge\n\nGK\n\nHereford\n\nSunderland\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nBen Davies\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nNeath\n\nTottenham\n\nWAL\n\n26\n\nJoe Rodon\n\nD (C)\n\nSwansea\n\nSwansea\n\nWAL\n\n21\n\nConnor Roberts\n\nD/WB (RL)\n\nNeath\n\nSwansea\n\nWAL\n\n23\n\nNeil Taylor\n\nD/WB (L)\n\nRuthin\n\nAston Villa\n\nWAL\n\n30\n\nAshley Richards\n\nD (RL), WB (R)\n\nSwansea\n\nCardiff\n\nWAL\n\n28\n\nAndrew Hughes\n\nD (LC)\n\nCardiff\n\nPreston\n\nWAL\n\n27\n\nAdam Matthews\n\nD/WB (RL)\n\nSwansea\n\nCharlton\n\nWAL\n\n27\n\nJames Collins\n\nD (C)\n\nNewport\n\n-\n\nWAL\n\n35\n\nJoe Walsh\n\nD (C)\n\nCardiff\n\nMK Dons\n\nWAL\n\n27\n\nGareth Bale\n\nM (L), AM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nCardiff\n\nReal Madrid\n\nWAL\n\n29\n\nAaron Ramsey\n\nM (C), AM (RC)\n\nCaerphilly\n\nJuventus\n\nWAL\n\n28\n\nJarrod Bowen\n\nM (RL), AM (RLC)\n\nHereford\n\nWest Ham\n\nENG\n\n22\n\nHarry Wilson\n\nM (C), AM (RLC)\n\nWrexham\n\nBournemouth\n\nWAL\n\n22\n\nLee Evans\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nNewport\n\nWigan\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nEmyr Huws\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nLlanelli\n\nIpswich Town\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nTom Lawrence\n\nM (RL), AM (RLC)\n\nWrexham\n\nDerby County\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nJoe Allen\n\nDM, M (C)\n\nCarmarthen\n\nStoke\n\nWAL\n\n29\n\nWes Burns\n\nWB/M/AM (R ), ST (C )\n\nCardiff\n\nFleetwood\n\nWAL\n\n24\n\nConnor Wickham\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nHereford\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nENG\n\n26\n\nChed Evans\n\nST (C )\n\nSt Asaph\n\nFleetwood\n\nWAL\n\n30\n\nEllis Harrison\n\nAM (L), ST (C)\n\nNewport\n\nPortsmouth\n\nWAL\n\n25\n\nAaron Collins\n\nAM (RLC), ST (C)\n\nNewport\n\nForest Green Rovers\n\nWAL\n\n22\n\nLikely Starting XI\n\nThe first team containing players born outside of England, Wales and Herefordshire are the tenth team to be revealed and will be managed by Tony Pulis, who gets the nod over Mark Hughes and Ryan Giggs. The thought of Tony Pulis ordering Gareth Bale to launch throw-ins on to Connor Wickham’s head is a frightening one indeed.\n\nThe Welsh national team currently have their ‘golden generation’ of players having reached their highest world rankings of 8th only 4 years ago. The squad, rather staggeringly contains a combined total of 511 Wales caps. Wayne Hennessey being the most experienced with 84 caps for his country. The cream of the crop, in this team is certainly Gareth Bale who is capable of providing a lot of quality. Gareth is the second highest rated player in the league behind Team 6’s Harry Kane.\n\nAnother key player in midfield is Aaron Ramsey, who will act as a box to box player and will give Tony Pulis’ men a bit of quality as well as work rate in the middle. Joe Allen will play in the quarterback role and will look to dictate play in front of the back four.\n\nThe squad is made up of all welsh players apart from the three Hereford lads. One of those include Jarrod Bowen who will make an interesting partnership with Gareth Bale on the wings. Another is Connor Wickham who looks likely to start up front and will provide a platform for the team to build by holding the ball up for the more creative players.\n\nIn defence, there is plenty of experience with the likes of James Collins, Ashley Richards and Ben Davies. The defence looks to be solid compared to the other defences in the league and should work together well in front of either Danny Ward or Wayne Hennessey especially given the discipline Pulis will bring."
