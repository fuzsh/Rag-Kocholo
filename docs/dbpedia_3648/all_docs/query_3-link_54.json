Owner of Viking Rentals, Lars Pettersen, was quoted in a release from the Town. “My family and I are very excited to work with the Town of Okotoks and to sponsor these exceptional venues that serve so many members of our community as well as surrounding areas... We are especially proud that Viking Rentals sponsorship will directly benefit athletes, spectators, and all visitors to the facilities. Sports, particularly hockey, have given me so much in my life, and I have always wanted to give back and help athletes to have the kinds of opportunities that I did. I have always admired people who contribute positively to their community and have been driven to be able to do the same.
