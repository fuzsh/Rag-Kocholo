        "text": "Game 1 no red-light special\n\nBy Mark Kiszla\n\nDenver Post Sports Writer\n\nMay 24 - DALLAS - This joke is on the NHL. While the Colorado Avalanche lived to laugh at the league's incompetence, what happened isn't funny.\n\nThe Avs woke Sunday morning with a 1-0 lead over the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference finals, despite NHL officials' best efforts to steal a victory from Colorado.\n\nHow could Avalanche forward Valeri Kamensky beat Stars goalie Ed Belfour with a clean shot inside the post early in the second period of Game 1, and Colorado's score not count?\n\nAnd how dare the league now so much as contemplate slapping Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix with a fine for his tirade against the obvious injustice?\n\n\"It was like there was a backup goalie there behind Belfour,'' Avs forward Claude Lemieux said Sunday. \"We deserved that goal.''\n\nBut no red light went on to acknowledge the score, because a goal judge was asleep at the switch when Kamensky's shot was fired.\n\nIn what's destined to be remembered as the phantom save, Belfour didn't have to do anything except let the puck sail between his legs. The befuddled Stars goalie never saw what fooled him. Neither did any of the game officials, who missed Kamensky's shot hit an overstuffed, lumpy white canvas bumper illegally attached to inside of the goal post before the puck bounced back at Belfour's feet.\n\n\"I see puck go in. I think it's goal,'' Kamensky said. \"But it hit big, white pillow.''\n\nHow could a league that prides itself on employing instant replay to settle controversial calls be so blind? Two, separate, lengthy video reviews of the play failed to recognize the Avs were robbed.\n\nLacroix immediately screamed injustice until his blue language left him blue in the face. In the press box of Reunion Arena, he loudly berated league supervisor of officials Wally Harris, NHL executive Jim Gregory and every hockey bureaucrat within shouting distance.\n\n\"It's disgusting,'' bellowed Lacroix, sticking his head into a room of replay officials that's strictly off limits to team personnel during games. \"People all over the world are laughing at you!''\n\nWhile his methods were crude, Lacroix deserves applause for standing up in the name of his aggrieved team.\n\nInstead, a league representative confirmed Sunday that Lacroix's tirade is under review by NHL director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, and a fine is possible as punishment for the Colorado general manager's profane attack.\n\n\"We have lots of pride,'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. \"If you enter your house and find all your diamonds are gone, you don't call the cops and tell them, \"Take your time, stop for a doughnut, and whenever you want to show up, you can show up.' We are emotional people.''\n\nEarlier in this year's playoffs, the Philadelphia Flyers' owner and coach were fined a total of $75,000 for protesting a penalty call in terms no ruder than the angry words employed by Lacroix.\n\nWhen Kamensky reclaimed the goal once unjustly denied him with a lucky third-period shot that provided Colorado its 2-1 victory in the series opener, the Avs saved themselves from a colossal injustice.\n\nWhat could have been a nightmare for the visitors ended in a sweet dream. \"Hey, I know one thing,'' said Hartley, noticing that overstuffed pillows seem to be in fashion all over Dallas. \"The pillows in my hotel bed were so comfortable. Big and fluffy.''\n\nBut a good night's sleep isn't enough. Harris owes Hartley and the Avs an apology. Because the NHL did not acquit itself from a major embarrassment.\n\nA sport desperate to be accepted as big-time in the United States keeps tripping over its own skates. The phantom save against Colorado was a gaffe only the NHL is capable of committing. In the playoff photo of the week, hockey was caught with egg on its face.\n\nCan you imagine the goal lines being painted crooked in both end zones at the Super Bowl? Of course not. Trained pros take too much pride in the integrity of their game.\n\nHow would NBA commissioner David Stern react if it was discovered that bent rims had been hung for a postseason game? Heads would roll.\n\nAnd when's the last time the umps forget to nail down home plate at the World Series? A true major league simply wouldn't make such a mistake.\n\nBut this is the NHL. So why be surprised? This is the same organization that will cancel a significant portion of its regular season to play Olympic hockey during the wee hours while everybody in the United States is sleeping. This is the same misguided brain trust that responds to a severe league-wide scoring drought by making no significant rule changes.\n\nIs there a moral to this latest chapter in the NHL's ongoing story of ineptitude?\n\n\"Don't ever let yourself think you're getting stuck with the bad end of the deal, because that's the way you get frustrated,'' Avs defenseman Adam Foote said.\n\nYou can never count on justice from a league that's too blind to see what's right."
