        "text": "On May 5th, River Bluff celebrated seventeen student-athletes who signed national letters of intent to continue their athletic and academic careers at the collegiate level. This is always a momentous occasion for the athletes, their families, friends, and the River Bluff community as years of hard work and dedication pay off in a big way. Congrats to each of these special Gators on their recognition!\n\nWrestling\n\nWill Rogers – The Citadel. State Champion wrestler William Rogers will be attending The Citadel to pursue a business degree and compete in wrestling at the collegiate level. Rogers says he chose The Citadel for two reasons: “Because I wanted to wrestle for them and I believe that The Citadel will prepare me best for my future.” The future Bulldog has been wrestling for 7 years and spent time as a football and soccer player as well. A highlight of his time as a Gator grappler was obviously winning an individual state championship as a senior. He’s a jack-of-all-trades as he also loves photography and spends lots of his free time taking photos and enhancing his photography skills. “Be uncommon among common people” are words Rogers likes to live by and words that will serve him well at the next level. (by Cale Wilson)\n\nFootball\n\nJakari Davis – Carson Newman University. Jakari (JD) Davis will be playing football for Carson Newman in the Fall of 2021. Davis looks forward to carrying his athletic and academic journey to his new home. He cites “the hospitality, love, care, and friendliness from not only the coaching staff and players but also the people in Jefferson City” as reasons for his choice of schools. “Calling it home for the next 3-4 years,” he adds, “seemed to be the right idea while chasing my dreams.” JD says, ” I love the game of football,” and has been playing the sport for 12 years. He has also participated in lacrosse and track and field. One of his favorite memories from his time as a Gator football player was, according to the future Eagle, “knocking off number two Fort Dorchester during 2021 playoffs. Our defense caused absolute havoc,” he adds proudly. JD admits to being a people person and looks forward to the whole college experience at Carson Newman. (by Haley Uptegraft)\n\nEric Hayes – South Carolina State University. Eric (E.J.) Hayes started playing football in the 7th grade and fell in love with the game. Throughout his remaining years in middle school and pushing into his high school career, Hayes remained a dedicated student-athlete, eventually playing varsity football for the River Bluff Gators and even played on the basketball team his junior year. When recalling his high school career, Hayes says, “[My favorite memory is] when we won the first-round game this year against Fort Dorchester after they missed the game-winning field goal.” Hayes signed to play football with SC State, stating, “It’s a great HBCU (Historically Black College and University) and I’ve always wanted to attend an HBCU.” At SC State, he plans to pursue a degree in Business Management while continuing his football career. (by Kobe Beard)\n\nTyler Harris – Concord University. Tyler Harris signed to play football for Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. His interest in Concord arose from the coaching staff’s recruiting efforts. The staff at Concord saw Harris’s potential and his hard work ethic and invited him to continue his athletic and academic career at their school. Harris accepted the offer and hopes to make that offer pay off for both parties, adding, “I want Concord to know that I’m a go-getter and that they are getting an all-out dog!” He has 13 years of experience in football and\n\nhas participated in track and field. He mentions he’ll never forget “those Gator Days during summer workouts” when he first got to River Bluff. Harris also recognizes the opportunity he’s been given. “I have persevered through many hardships and difficulties over the years to get to this point,” says Harris, going on to point out that he stresses the “student” part of being a student-athlete. He will be majoring in Communications of Multimedia. (by Haley Uptegraft)\n\nMen’s Lacrosse\n\nRyan Yanssens – Baldwin Wallace University. Ryan Yanssens signed with the Hornets of Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio to play lacrosse. He will be chasing a degree in Sports Management. When asked why he chose the Hornets, Yanssens replied, “[It’s the] best school I was looking at for academics and the best fit for me.” Yanssens been playing lacrosse for six years and was a team captain for the Gators this season. The sport of lacrosse has made an impact on his life. Yanssens says, “It has pushed me to be the best person and player I can be to get me to the point where I am at right now in my life.” Ryan will be the second athlete in the Yanssens family to go on to play in college. His older brother George plays at Mars Hill. Family also comes up when talking about his favorite memory as a Gator LAX player. Yanssens comments, “When I was a sophomore, my brother was a senior at the time and we got to play together and we won the first-ever region title together. That’s something I’ll never forget in all of my years of playing lacrosse.” (by Cale Wilson)\n\nMen’s Basketball\n\nMyles Jenkins – Anderson University. Myles Jenkins believes that it’s okay not to fit in. Admittedly, it’s difficult to fit in when you stand out from the crowd. River Bluff’s Male Athlete of the Year will be leaving River Bluff and heading to Anderson University with an amazing legacy as a Gator. The All-State, All-Region, All-Star, All-Everything, Region Player of the Year led his team to a Men’s Basketball AAAAA State Championship – the first in program history. Still, while basketball is obviously important to Jenkins, he places a high value on character. He has played basketball for 12 years and as the accolades have poured in recently, Jenkins has remained humble and looks to continue improving in all walks of life, not just on the court. In fact, he views Anderson as “a place to grow.” He plans to pursue a degree in Psychology there. That being said, Jenkins’ competitive spirit and drive have propelled him to the next level of athletics and are evident when he takes the court. That was never more obvious than when he scored 31 points in this season’s state championship game. “Winning the State Championship is one of my greatest memories as a Gator,” says Jenkins, who also played golf for the Gator golf team. One can’t help but feel certain that Myles Jenkins will continue to accomplish great things at Anderson.\n\nLandon Stills – Columbia International University. Basketball floor general Landon Stills signed to play basketball for Columbia International University in the fall of 2021, where he’ll major in Business. Of his choice of schools, Stills stated, “CIU has a great basketball program and it’s a good environment to be in and very Christian-oriented.” Stills has had a love for basketball since he was 5 years old, and even though he currently only plays basketball he is a multi-sport player. He has played football, baseball, and even played tennis for a short period of time. Stills stated that he is a very hard worker and does not give up, which is obvious to see when he’s on the court. Stills, who just recently took home an SCHSL AAAAA Basketball State Championship ring, commented that winning a state title was his favorite memory during his 4 years as a Gator student-athlete, adding, “Winning a state title had been a dream of mine for a long time.” Stills advises future Gators to follow the same mantra he’s been following for years – “Work hard, no matter the circumstances because it will pay off in the long run.” (by Grace Middleton)\n\nGrayson Renner – Newberry College. Grayson Renner, an integral member of the 2020-21 State Champion River Bluff men’s basketball team, will be taking his outside marksman talents to Newberry College in the fall of 2021. The choice of schools came down to a few factors for Renner. “I really liked the community and sense of family I got from Newberry College,” he says, “and decided that since it’s generally close to home to continue my athletics and academics there.” Although he played football in middle school and is an avid video game player, Renner’s first love is basketball. He’s played the game since he was three years old. He believes that “no matter what your dream may be, big or small, if you put the effort in you can make those dreams come true.” That seems to certainly be true for Renner and his teammates this season as they earned the AAAAA State Championship title. In fact, when asked about his favorite experience of his high school career, he’s quick to respond, “Definitely winning a state championship with all of the guys I’ve grown up with.”\n\nMalachi Reeves – Link Year Prep. After having to miss much of his junior season due to injury, Malachi Reeves returned his senior year and certainly made up for lost time, earning All-Region, All-State, and All-Star honors, while helping lead the Gators to their first-ever AAAAA State Championship in Men’s Basketball. Reeves signed with Link Year Prep Academy in Branson, Missouri, stating, “I feel like Link Year is the best spot for me to grow in both athletic abilities and spiritual walk in a great program.” Reeves has played basketball for as long as he can remember and is quite the sportsman, having run track and played tennis for the Gators at one point. When he was younger he played volleyball, frisbee, football, and baseball. He mentions that he loves basketball, reading, and hanging out with friends. Still, while these are important to him, Reeves mentions a higher calling. “I want my relationship with Christ to always be first in my life. Then I will trust him to do whatever he wants with my basketball journey,” claims the youngest of four brothers and a sister. Even though his team recently won a state title, Reeves recalls another memory as his favorite. “I guess my favorite memory is my first time starting a game on varsity,” he says. “It was the end of my freshman season at Spring Valley and I was just so nervous the whole bus ride to the game, but looking back it was a big moment in my time at RB and,” he adds, “it really helped my confidence as an athlete.”\n\nBaseball\n\nEthan Lebron – Newberry College. Gator baseball player Ethan Lebron will continue his baseball career at Newberry College in the fall. Following a line of baseball players, Lebron is following in the footsteps of older brothers Noah, who is playing baseball at Presbyterian College, and Jacob, who will be a teammate at Newberry. At the same time, the youngest Lebron is striking his own path, leading the Gators from the mound this season. Newberry’s campus appealed to Lebron and playing with his brother again is also a major attraction. He has played\n\nbaseball for fourteen years, but it certainly doesn’t feel that long to Lebron. “Time flies when you’re having fun,” the future Wolf adds. His favorite memory as a Gator was winning the AAAAA Lower State championship. (by James Benedict)\n\nWomen’s Basketball\n\nReagan Rozier – Newberry College. Women’s basketball standout Reagan Rozier will be taking her basketball talents to Newberry College in the Fall of 2021. She began playing the sport in the 7th grade and through hard work has seen significant improvements in her game every year, eventually resulting in a fantastic senior season and a national letter of intent signing at the collegiate level. While staying devoted to her basketball career, she can see herself excelling in academics at Newberry, where she will be majoring in Nursing. “I can see myself thriving not just in athletics,” says Rozier, “but academically with Newberry’s smaller class sizes and more attention from professors towards each individual student.” Very passionate about her sport and her fellow female athletes, Rozier says, “Basketball was an outlet I used to push through any challenges life threw at me, but what I want any and all future women athletes to know is that it is okay to make mistakes. Mistakes mean you are going out of your comfort zone and trying and that is exactly what needs to be done. However, “she adds, “most importantly, have fun!” Looking back on her memories, one of her favorites is the most recent. Rozier comments, “I would say my favorite memory from my years as a student-athlete for RBHS would be from this year, my senior year, at my signing because it really gave me that feeling of accomplishment. I never thought my basketball career would continue onto the collegiate level and now finally making it, thanks to Newberry College, I am blessed to continue my career from an RBHS Gator to a Newberry Timberwolf!” (by Haley Pinckney)\n\nWomen’s Soccer\n\nTori Collins – Nicholls State University. Tori Collins says she is excited for what the future holds and her future will begin in the fall at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. At Nicholls State, Collins will not only be a player for the Lady Colonels’ soccer team but will also pursue a major in Mass Communications. On her choice of schools, she says, “I love the atmosphere and the location. The coaching staff makes it feel like home.” The four-year Gator varsity player has been in the River Bluff program for six years and has been playing since the age of three. Being able to continue her soccer career at the collegiate level is a result of hard work, determination, and a competitive spirit. That competitiveness is evident when Collins recalls one of her favorite memories as a Gator is “beating Lexington three times in 2019 (my sophomore year).”\n\nCheer\n\nLauren Hannon – University of South Carolina. With a background in softball, dance, gymnastics, and even horseback riding, Lauren Hannon was definitely prepared for her career in competitive cheer. After six years as a cheerleader, Hannon has signed to continue her cheer and academic pursuits at the University of South Carolina. The future Gamecock says she was lured by “the massive quantities of classes that are available,” at USC and the opportunity the school offers “to create friendships, explore my future self, and set myself up for the future.” When looking back on her time as a Gator cheerleader, Hannon recalls, “My favorite memory is the state dinner (prior to this year’s State Championships). My last state dinner made me recap my 4 years on the RB Varsity Cheer squad and made me realize it was my last time competing with my best friends.”\n\nEmily Mirra – University of South Carolina. Emily Mirra fell in love with cheerleading the day she was introduced to it. Six years later, she will continue to pursue that passion as a Gamecock at the University of South Carolina. In addition to its cheer program and its close proximity to home, USC’s reputation in nursing appealed to Mirra as well. In fact, she plans on majoring in Pre-Nursing. Yet another draw for Mirra is that fellow Gators Lauren Hannon and Brilee Schildknecht will be joining her on the Gamecock squad. When thinking about her time as a Gator and as a future Gamecock, Mirra says, “My favorite memory would be cheering with my best friends and now having the opportunity to continue cheering with them.”\n\nBrilee Schildknecht – University of South Carolina. Brilee Schildknecht was involved in gymnastics for thirteen years. Then she says during her junior year, “I decided to try something new so I joined the cheer team and as a side sport I also did track.” It turned out to be a great move as she will now be a part of the University of South Carolina cheer team. Sports have always played an important role in Schildnecht’s life. She says, “I have always done sports because I like having goals that I can set for myself and sports have given me something to work towards.” That pursuit of goals has allowed her to achieve a dream. “I chose the University of South Carolina because it has always been a school of my choice,” Schildnecht says, adding, “and my mother also attended this University.” She goes on to mention,” They have an amazing cheer team that I’ve always dreamed to be a part of and a variety of majors that I’m interested in.” As part of the trio heading to USC in the fall, the camaraderie as part of the Gator cheer team stands out to Mirra. She recalls, “My favorite memories from cheer are the ones from when we got to travel as a team to football games.” (by Haley Uptegraft)\n\nDance\n\nBryanna Outman – University of South Carolina. Bryanna Outman has been dancing for 8 years, including time on the award-winning River Bluff Dance team. As a result of her hard work and team-player attitude, Outman will now have the opportunity to dance for the Gamecocks at the University of South Carolina, where she will major in Marketing. Outman says she chose Uof SC because she “loves the campus, dance team, and it is so close to home.” Some of her favorite memories as a Gator are from Friday Nights in The Swamp, dancing on the sidelines at football games. Outman is thankful for her time at River Bluff, adding, “River bluff has provided me so many opportunities to succeed both in dance and in education.” (by Carmen Hernandez)\n\nHannah Rivers – University of South Carolina. Like her fellow Gamecock signee from RBHS – Bryanna Outman, Hannah Rivers is seeing years of hard work and dedication pay off with a chance to continue her dance career at the University of South Carolina. Rivers has been dancing since the age of three and is excited about being able to dance at the collegiate level, especially at a school like U of SC. She says, “The University of South Carolina definitely feels like home. It has a welcoming and uplifting atmosphere. It provides a great education and allows me to continue doing what I love.” While dance is certainly something Rivers loves, she has other passions as well. “In my free time, I love hanging out with friends and traveling to new and exciting places,” she mentions, but then adds that her free time is quite minimal, thanks to dance. In fact, she admits that she would have been a part of the track and field team if time had allowed. Rivers does not hesitate when asked about her fondest memories as a Gator dancer. “Definitely dancing on the sidelines at football games,” she states. “I loved cheering on the team while doing what I love.” Rivers also adds, “I also really enjoyed every dance concert performance I had at the school.”"
