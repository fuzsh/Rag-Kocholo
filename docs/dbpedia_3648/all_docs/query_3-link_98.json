        "text": "FOOTBALL\n\nRB Thomas dies\n\nDuane Thomas, a running back for the Dallas Cowboys when they finally broke through and won a Super Bowl to cap the 1971 season, has died. He was 77. The team said Thomas died Sunday but had no other details. Thomas was with the Cowboys in 1970-71, a pair of tumultuous seasons plagued by a contract dispute that once led him to call Coach Tom Landry \"plastic man.\" He was the first player to score a touchdown at Texas Stadium in 1971, when he led the Cowboys with 11 rushing touchdowns. Thomas was born and raised in Dallas before playing college football at West Texas State in the Texas Panhandle. He was a first-round pick by the Cowboys in 1970. As a rookie in 1970, Thomas helped the Cowboys reach the Super Bowl, where they couldn't shake the moniker of \"next year's champions\" after losing to Baltimore. After the season, Thomas' demand for a restructured contract was rejected by the Cowboys and he was traded to New England. He refused to report to the Patriots, and the deal was voided by then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Thomas refused to talk to reporters the entire 1971 season because he believed they had taken management's side, but still played an important role for a team that beat Miami 24-3 for its first Super Bowl title. Thomas was traded to the San Diego Chargers before the 1972 season. Thomas never showed up for training camp with San Diego and was sent to Washington. Thomas didn't play in 1972 before spending the other two of his four pro seasons with Washington. Thomas had 2,038 career yards rushing and 21 touchdowns, with 1,596 yards and 16 touchdowns coming with the Cowboys.\n\nPitbull buys rights at FIU\n\nFlorida International University announced what could end up as a 10-year agreement on Tuesday with international recording artist, Grammy winner and entrepreneur Armando Christian Perez -- the Miami native better known as Pitbull -- to put his name on their on-campus stadium. Perez will pay $1.2 million annually for the next five years, the university said, for the naming rights. He will have an option in August 2029 to extend the deal for another five years and continue the rebranding. \"Yes, we're going to create history in Pitbull Stadium,\" Perez said during a news conference in Miami. \"This isn't just an announcement. This is a movement. This is truly history in the making.\" Perez will also be involved with FIU's efforts in the name, image and likeness space, Athletic Director Scott Carr said.\n\nMorstead honors Gleason\n\nThomas Morstead's punts this season will do more than just change field position for the New York Jets. The veteran punter announced Tuesday he's donating $1,000 as part of his Punt for ALS campaign for each kick he drops inside the opponent's 20-yard line in honor of former New Orleans Saints special teams star Steve Gleason. Gleason was diagnosed with ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, in 2011. He was honored with the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at The ESPYS last month.\n\nMcCaffrey out\n\nSan Francisco 49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday star running back Christian McCaffrey will be out for the preseason with a strained calf. A year ago, McCaffrey didn't play in any of the 49ers' three preseason games and hit the ground running in Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers with 152 yards on 22 carries in a 30-7 win. McCaffrey went on to rush for 1,459 yards on 272 carries, catch 67 passes for 564 yards and score 21 touchdowns rushing and receiving en route to being named the Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nNacua injures knee\n\nLos Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is week to week after sustaining a knee injury in a joint practice with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, but Coach Sean McVay expects him to be available in time to play in the season opener against the Detroit Lions on Sept. 8. Nacua took advantage of a hamstring injury to Cooper Kupp in training camp last season to set the stage for a breakout rookie season, finishing with 1,486 yards receiving on 105 catches with 6 touchdowns after being drafted in the fifth round out of BYU.\n\nSeahawks add Williams\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million with veteran offensive lineman Connor Williams on Tuesday. Williams' representatives Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press, which includes $3 million guaranteed. Williams likely will be thrown into the competition at center where Seattle has the most uncertainty on its offensive line. Olu Oluwatimi, a fifth-round pick in 2023, was the presumptive starter, but Nick Harris has been thrown into the mix in the past week and Coach Mike Macdonald said Monday the competition was on between the pair.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nBean dead at 60\n\nBilly Bean, who became the second former Major League Baseball player to come out as gay in 1999 before becoming the sport's senior vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion, has died. He was 60. MLB released a statement confirming his death. Bean died at home on Tuesday after a yearlong fight with acute myeloid leukemia. The California native played in six big league seasons from 1987 to 1995, making his debut with the Detroit Tigers in a four-hit performance that tied a record for a player in his first game. He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres. He was a two-time All-American outfielder at Loyola Marymount, leading the team to the NCAA College World Series in 1986. Bean wrote a book titled \"Going the Other Way\" and was also a keynote speaker at many events. He publicly came out as gay in 1999, the second former major leaguer to do so after Glenn Burke."
