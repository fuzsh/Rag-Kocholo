        "text": "Australia boast of a proud Olympic legacy, having secured medals at all 29 editions of the modern Summer Games to date.\n\nThe number of Australian athletes at the Summer Olympics has also steadily increased over the past few editions and so has the tally of Olympic medals won by Australia.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, the Australian Olympic Team comprised 486 athletes, the second-largest for the country after the Sydney Olympics.\n\nAt the Paris 2024 Olympics, Australia’s contingent comprises over 460 athletes, who will compete in 33 sports. It is expected to be the third largest Australian contingent to compete at a Games held overseas, behind Tokyo 2020 (486) and Athens 2004 (482).\n\nMore than half of the Australian team will be represented by women, a stark contrast to Paris 1924 when no women were part of the Australian team.\n\nEquestrian Shane Rose, 51, is the oldest member of the 2024 Australian Olympic team while skateboarder Arisa Trew is the youngest at just 14.\n\nTen Indigenous athletes will also represent Australia with Patty Mills the first five-time Indigenous Olympian and Conor Nicholas to become Australia’s first Indigenous sailing Olympian.\n\nAustralia’s Olympic athletics team for Paris 2024 includes high jumpers Nicola Olyslagers, a Tokyo 2020 silver medallist, and 2022 world champion Eleanor Patterson. Matthew Denny, the reigning Diamond League champion in men’s discus throw, will be gunning for his maiden Olympic medal on his third appearance.\n\nTokyo 2020 bronze medallist Harry Garside will lead Australia’s 12-member boxing team.\n\nJessica Fox will return to Paris 2024 in a bid to secure her fifth Olympic medal. The Australian canoeist won the gold medal in the women’s C1 event three years ago. She bagged silver at London 2012 and bronze medals at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 in the K1 events. Fox will compete in both C1 and K1 events in Paris.\n\nAustralia Paris 2024 team for swimming, the sport which has yielded the most medals for the country at the Olympics to date, was announced following the national trials in June.\n\nAustralia will be making debut in breaking along with new disciplines – kayak cross, mixed team race walk, men’s and women’s kiteboarding events and mixed 470 sailing. Australian women will also compete for the first time in basketball 3x3.\n\nThe composition of the Australian Olympic Team, however, may change before the opening competition on July 24, depending on athlete withdrawals or late additional quota spots due to withdrawal of athletes from other nations.\n\nAustralia’s Paris 2024 Olympics team"
