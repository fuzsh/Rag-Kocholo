He was just 20 years old,\" they wrote on Facebook yesterday.\n\n\"The young sportsman, who returned to Auckland this year following a stint with the Gold Coast Titans under-20 side, had been in an induced coma at Auckland Hospital.\n\n\"Zae was an amazing footy player, and well known throughout all codes in Auckland. Many of our Counties Touch Whanau were good friends with the young star.\"\n\nSemi-professional rugby league club the Burleigh Bears, who Wallace played for formally, said his family are in their thoughts and prayers.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we inform you of the passing of Bear #340 Zae Wallace,\" it said on Facebook.\n\n\"Zae was loved by all at the Burleigh Bears and while he will be missed won't be forgotten.\n\n\"The Club would like to offer its condolences to Zae's family and friends especially parents Rose and Wayne and siblings Kirsten, Vann and Leigh in these tough times.\"\n\nWallace had already been in hospital for four weeks when the Givealittle page was created at the start of last month.\n\n\"For those of you who know Zae you will know he is a very talented rugby league and rugby player,\" the page reads.\n\n\"He is a very strong athletic young man who has been in Australia playing league and has just recently returned to NZ to continue playing league with the Northcote Tigers.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Zae has only played one game with them before being struck down with a sudden illness.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Westlake Boys' High School have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to their former student and rugby league captain.\n\n\"The Westlake community is deeply saddened with the loss of former student, Zae Wallace.
