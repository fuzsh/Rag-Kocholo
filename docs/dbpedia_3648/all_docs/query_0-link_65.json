The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nÂ£18,000 FEE READY TO BE PAID FOR EVERTON UTITITY FORWARD\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nJim Harris, Everton’s under-23 international forward may be a West Browmich Albion player today.Â Although there is no question of Harris having been offered for sale, Everton’s recent buying spree and the fact that Alex Young is almost ready to make his appearance in the forward line, has not gone unnoticed and yesterday West Brom’s manager, Mr. Gordon Clark, travelled to Goodison to pop the Â£18,000 question- will you let Harris go?Â Everton manager Mr. John Carey, was taken by surprise at this sudden interest in a player who has missed only one game this season-that against Newcastle a fortnight ago-but Mr. Carey’s intelligent anticipation of possibilities found Mr. Carey willing to discuss possibilities.Â Now, I understand the position is that West Brom are willing to pay a fee acceptable to Everton and only the player’s consent stands in the way of progress.Â Harris was also surprised at development and not unnaturally asked for time to think over the proposition.Â Mr. Clarke expects to receive Harris’s verdict today.Â Like every other player Harris likes first team football and appearances just now suggest that when all men are available there can be no regular position available for him in Everton’s line-up and the thought of filling in only as a reserve is not a very pleasant sort of prospect for a man who has figured regularly in First Division football for several seasons.Â Mr. Clark asked for and received permission to speak to Harris yesterday and no doubt impressed on him that a move to West Brom would guarantee him a continuance of top flight soccer.Â It seemed obvious when West Brom were at Goodison recently that they needed punch in the forward line to pay tribute to the clever play of the men behind and I gather that it is the intention to employ Harris as an outside right if he agrees to the move.\n\nNOT ANXIOUS TO PART\n\nMr. Carey last night said; “If it is in the player’s interests we are prepared to let him go, but we are not anxious to part with him.Â Harris takes the view that with so many players available once the position with injured men is resolved he may have some difficulty in establishing a first team place.”Â Harris a former Birkenhead schoolboy, became a professional on September 28, 1951 but it was not until August 1955 he made his League debut at Burnley.Â Dave Hickson the man deposed, promptly asked for a transfer and within a matter of days joined Aston Villa for a Â£20,000 fee.Â From that time Harris has commanded a more or less regular place in the team, mainly at centre forward or outside right, but with his appearance in the outside left position at Highbury last week he completed his tour of the forward line, having figured in every position.Â According to my records he is only nine games short of his double century of appearances with Everton.Â He was England’s centre forward against Scotland in an Under-23 international match and in November 1958 was inside right in the English League team against the Irish League at Anfield.Â If Harris does agree to go the fee will provide a substantial slice off the Â£55,000 which Everton paid for the Scottish international, Young and Thomson a little over week ago.Â This season Harris has scored four goals, compared with nine all last season.Â Young has been nominated to lead the British Army attack against Middlesbrough next Wednesday but whether he will be fit though is another matter I understand that while he is making good progress from his knee injury, he can be ruled out to tomorrow’s home game with Sheffield Wednesday with some degree of certainly.Â\n\nPRESENT ENGLAND SIDE COULD BECOME TOP OF WORLD, SAYS ROY VERNON\n\nFriday, December 2, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nIf the next World Cup series was to be played in this country, I would stick out my neck and suggest that England would be the winners.Â That is the conclusion I reached after being in the Welsh side to decisively beaten at Wembley.Â It was an ambition fulfilled when I can put on to the famous pitch but I think there my pleasure ended, for even the ground disappointed me.Â Not only was it heavy but it cut up far worse than I had ever thought possible.Â If Wembley were like club grounds played on week after week it would respond like another pitch, and the famous turf renowned the world over would do the annual appearing trick like the rest of them.Â England got an early goal and before we knew where we were Wales were three down and we were playing good football at that.Â Not only did England play far better than I had believed them capable of, but they blended as a team in the way in which every team manager dreams he will one day accomplish.Â If Wales cannot win the World Cup then I hope England do it.Â There was no comparison between this England side and that which I opposed at Cardiff a couple of years ago.Â I don’t think I have played against a better side than this, although Czechoslovakia in Prague in the last world Cup competition were a terrifically able combination.Â This England side could kill stone-dead all the talk about the decline of English soccer and could become top of the world.Â They need English conditions to bring about this desirable state of affairs, but so far the foreigners have had the advantage in weather conditions.Â What is it that makes this English side tick?Â Johnny Haynes, I believe is destined to become one of the greatest England captains of all time, with all due respect to Billy Wright.Â He really takes control on the field and the players look to him.Â They expect him to dictate and he does not disappoint them.Â He is the schemer.Â\n\nALL-ROUND PLAYER\n\nHis association with Jimmy Greaves is a natural partnership.Â There is trouble in plenty with there two around.Â I believe this boy Greaves is tops.Â He is a greatly under-rated player although he is an international and that is possibly because he has acquired a reputation as a goal poacher and spectator’s look on him in that light instead of giving him the credit he deserves as an all-round player.Â He is brilliant on the ball, his control is uncanny and his positional sense leaves one spellbound.Â The ball goes to him as though to a magnet.Â There is talk just now about the possibility of Greaves going on the transfer list.Â If ever it does get to that stage I can imagine somebody, being killed in the rush for his signature, even though only those clubs with outsized cheque books can possibly begin to form a queue.Â Without a shadow of a doubt clubs would have to start talking at about Â£60,000 that is supposing the lay relating to Italian football remains unchanged for no English club could complete with the sort of money the Italians would talk in if it really did become a free-for-all.Â It is not stretching the imagination too far to think in terms of an Italian deal in the Â£100,000 class but it would be a fearful tragedy for English soccer if this lad were allowed to leave.Â The English international side would certainly not be anything like the same and the building we like to think has been done with such good effect, would be in danger of tottering again.Â So many teams play good football up to the fringe of the penalty area.Â Those who saw West Brom at Goodison recently will know what I mean but they simply did not have the finishing punch, a complaint from which several suffer.Â Greaves is the man to supply that touch of class, that infusion of power.Â He could revolutionise the appearance of many a team.Â After the Wembley fiasco from a Welsh point of view, my second disappointment of the week was the fall of Everton at Arsenal.Â Had we been out-played by a better side the ending of our unbeaten run would have been more palatable but very few would class Arsenal as superior to Everton even on that display.Â I don’t think it is a case of sour grapes but for me Arsenal were not in Everton’s class, but it is goals that count not class.Â Three-goals Herd enjoyed what may be his match of the season.Â It was his day and he celebrated most enthusiastically, if he had been trying to impress Mr. Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United he could not have been more deadly but I don’t believe Mr. Busby required any further impression.Â\n\nMind Made Up\n\nHis mind has obviously been made up for quite a time that Herd is the player who has in abundance just what Manchester United lack.Â Mr. Busby has dug his teeth right into this bargain and I don’t believe he will let go until Herd lands at Old Trafford, where the need for him is so much greater now, following the injury to Dennis Violett.Â I was glad to see George Thomson come into his own before the end of the Arsenal game.Â For any player a debut is an ordeal.Â He is trying so desperately hard to please, that performance sometimes suffers.Â It was even more trying for Thomson because this was not merely a debut, but also an introduction to a different class of soccer and I am one of those who believes that an Englishman going into Scotland would find the game far easier to play than anybody taking the reverse route.Â Just as I do not believe we have seen anything like the best of Thomson, I am equally certain that Everton have only touched their best in fleeting moments.Â They have the framework now for a really brilliant side and once we drop into the rhythm just as Tottenham have done this season, I would like to believe that Everton followers are destined for entertainment of the highest class.Â Â The mason confessed to me that he was shaky at first; but felt much better as the game progressed.Â Well that is very natural and I was able to comfort him somewhat by telling him that not every week will he meet a right winger as fast or clever as Danny Clapton.Â The Scot’s style of play is very much that of Everton and I can foresee the time when George will be every bit as effective as Alex Parker, and that is tribute indeed.Â Everton players are just as impatient as their supporters to see Alex Young in action.Â We have seen him in training but with his speed and experience in the middle we are all looking forward to great deeds ahead, I don’t think we will be disappointed even if the forward line does not click immediately.Â Future success I believe is assured.Â\n\nHARRIS WANTS TIME TO DECIDE\n\nLiverpool Echo - Friday 02 December 1960\n\nWEST BROM’S FIRM OFFER\n\nSUBSTANTIAL FEE\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nWest Bromwich Alblon have made firm offer for Everton forward, Jimmy Harris, but the player wants a week or two in which to make up his mind and will not therefore be in the Albion side at Chelsea to-morrow as Mr. Gordon Clarke, the manager, hoped. Â I understand that Harris feels that he should make no move while he is still in the Everton first team. The fee which neither club would disclose, is a very substantial one and higher than that generally thought to be 'the case. Â The West Bromwich Albion manager made a secret trip toÂ Goodison Park yesterday and 'was flabbergasted on his arrival home last night to find that the news had leakedâin Liverpool. He conferred with Mr. Carey about the possibility of players in general and then particularized on Harris whom he sought as a right winger or centre-forward. He was given permission to approach Harris and promised that if he went to The Hawthorns he would be left to play in his own individual style.\n\nHICKSON'S SUCCESSOR\n\nHarris, Birkenhead - born: came into the Everton team with a bang at centre-forward as successor to Dave Hickson. He has a big shot: is fast and has played on both wings and in the centre in the Everton first team this season. He has scored infrequently but has been the attack throughout Everton long spell of League success, broken only by this defeat at Highbury last Saturday.Â Â The coming of Alex Young, and the presence of wingers Ring, Bingham, Lill and Temple might well mean that Harris could lose his place in the near future. When he does 1 anticipate he will be ready to move on to try his luck elsewhere. Harris has made one appearance in the England under-23 teamâat Sheffeld three seasons ago.\n\nEVERTON UNCHANGED\n\nEverton announce an unchanged side for the visit of Sheffield Wednesday. The prospect of Alex Young being fit to take his place at centre forward was never hopeful, and it is unlikely that he will be fit for play for the Army at Middlesbrough next Wednesday. Wednesday's English international goalkeeper, Ron Springett, out of the team for the last four matches after a ligament injury when playing for England in Italy, returns. Otherwise the team is that which lost its last two games by two goals to one.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Thomson; Gabriel, Labone, Harris (B); Bingham, Collins, Wignall, Vernon, Harris (J)\n\nSheffield Wednesday; Springett; Johnson, Megson; McAnearney, Swan, Kaye; Griffin, Craig, Ellis, Fantham, Finney.Â\n\nA FIRST VIEW OF THOMSON AT GOODISON\n\nLiverpool Echo - Friday 02 December 1960\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nThe first home appearance of former Hearts full-back, George Thomson, who made his debut for Everton at Highbury last Saturday coincides with the visit tomorrow of Sheffield Wednesday.Â Thus an early attractive match becomes a must for thousands of fans who want to see their team confirm the belief that they are a better side than the Championship rivals and one who may well demonstrate in a fortnight’s time that they are better than Tottenham, too!Â Everton’s defeat a Highbury âa galliant one after being three down quickly- has been their only real set-back for a long time.Â I don’t think it will affect their confidence and though Wednesday are the only team to have beaten Spurs this season one must not forget that Everton ran the London side goalless until the last ten minutes in the season’s opening game.Â Everton have everything a good side needs- at least they will have when Young is fit to take his place “in the middle” âbut Wednesday, who certainly don’t stand on ceremony, will pose a big problem for them.Â The one certain about the match is that it will produce entertaining football.Â Everton’s main aim is to do this and never in my memory has it been so possible to go to Goodison Park not hoping to see the game’s arts, but certain to have them display, whatever the result.Â A man who has watched football for countless years told me yesterday that his opinion was that Bobby Collins was the finest inside-forward, offensively and defensively he ever saw.Â When you study the little man’s repertoire of art, strength, punch and ability to head a ball his contribution to the side’s success is bound to be enormous.Â\n\nEVERTON MAKE FIGHTING COME-BACK TO WIN\n\nLiverpool Echo - Saturday 03 December 1960\n\nFORCE WEDNESDAY TO MAKE MISTAKES\n\nEVERTON 4, SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 2\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton; DunIop; Parker, Thomsen; Gabriel, Labone, Harris (B), Bingham, Collins, Wignall, Vernon, Harris (J). Sheffield Wednesday;Â Springett; Johnson, Megson; McAneerney, Swan, Key; Griffin, Craig, Ellis, Fantham, Finney. Referee: Mr. W. ClementsÂ (West Bromwich).\n\nThe weather could not have been worse for the gala game_ against Sheffield Wednesday. Fortunately, the rain ceased as the teams came out. But the damage had been done and there were not more than 40.000 present when Everton kicked off towards the Gwladys Street goal.Â It was a sensational opening.Â Dunlop had no sooner saved a deflected shot by Fantham than the ball was punched up-field by the goalkeeper to skid into the possession of Vernon, who showed his speed to get clean through and with Springett having left the goal turned the ball into an empty net, to the accompaniment of tremendous cheering and such wild joy as we see rarely even at Everton.Â Everton stated tremendously, quite apart from their goal, and now Bingham with a back-heel touch opened the way for Wignall to centre fast and had just the right height for Collins whose glancing header seemed long odds on scoring, but Springett saved as brilliantly as Hodgkinson had from Hickson a week ago. In the next phase or play Wednesday equalised in 5 minutes. A lovely pass by Finney found Fantham on the left and that player's good length centre was nodded in just inside the post by the big man Ellis, who got up high and nodded the ball downwards. Everton's new back from Hearts, Thomson, making his home debut, showed the crowd a good physique and a good deal, of artistry, and this early it was quite clear that Everton were going to have battle in spite of enjoying that dramatic lead. The heavy ground and Wednesdays propensity for keeping the ball close often led to the Everton defence stepping in and taking possession.Â At this stage a misunderstanding between Bingham and Collins prevented either from profiting from a diagonal pass put up judiciously by Vernon. Wednesday were unquestionable the better equipped side physically, most of them being sizeable.Â\n\nSharp Tackling\n\nThe tackling from both sides was as sharp as it was uncompromising.Â Wednesday never gave Collins and Vernon a moment’s rest when they were in possession.Â Thomson got right into the crowd’s good books by a most astute pass to find Jimmy Harris and enabled him to pivot quickly and hit the ball straight for the goal.Â Springett fumbled this one, but regarded the ball at the second attempt.Â The crowd did not like Swan’s foul on Wignall, but I think it was more accidental than intended.Â Finney was now operating more on the right wing than on the left, and for the second time a right-wing corner kick, this time attempted by Parker and Bingham, came unstruck badly through misunderstanding.\n\nDANGEROUS FINNEY\n\nFinney was very dangerous at all times and a swerving low centre from him led to Labone and Ellis colliding and going to Â earth slap in front of goal with neither of them able to make contact. Finney now beat both Gabriel and Thomson, took the ball to the line, and pulled it back to force Dunlop to make a half save. Parker hooking the ball away for a corner as a safety first measure. The corner at 27 minutes proved an unlucky one for Everton as immediately following it the ball was wiled back from the left for Craig to volley a vicious shot beyond Dunlop and give Wednesday the lead. Â Vernon prized an opening for a shot but the ball travelled I slower than Springett anticipated and having gone down too early he was lucky to find the shot striking his foot and bounding away to safety.Â\n\nWEDNESDAY ON TOP\n\nLittle Craig with yet another close-in shot might well have scored it the ball had not been deflected for a corner by a rather lucky Everton intervention. Wednesday were now on top and looked as though they meant to stay there. They were a well-balanced side whereas Everton, in attack at least, were inclined to be hasty and rather hit or miss.\n\nSUPERS PLAY\n\nA truly superb bit of full back play by Parker now extricated himself and Everton from a bad position near the corner flag, and as a direct result the ball came straight down field to enable Jimmy Harris in the centre forward position to make a shot which Springett saved brilliantly.Â\n\nBRILLIANT MOVES\n\nNothing was better than the way Brian Harris, Collins and Jimmy Harris moved the ball up the left wing by gorgeous combined operation, and that Bingham’s header flew inches wide off Jimmy Harris' centre was desperate misfortune to one of the finest moves of the game. Alex Parker on the right was going up and passed them as though they did not exist, but Wednesday as a whole looked tremendously impressive and deserved. I thought, their 2-1 lead at the interval.\n\nHalf-time, Everton 1. Sheffield Wednesday 2.\n\nWednesday began the second half as they finished the first with the extreme wingers switched. The red-haired Kay was almost a team in himself.\n\nROUGH TREATMENT\n\nThe crowd did not like Megson's treatment of the tough little Bingham. The free kick produced an equalised for Everton as when Wignall went up to beat Springett to the ball and nodded it towards an empty goat a Wednesday defender dropped back on the line, handled the ball away and the decision could not be other than a penalty.Â I think the offender was Swan. Certainly Mr. Clements, was in no doubt about the crime and Wednesday made', no protest though it must have been only justice when Vernon scored train the spot. Everton now looked as though they sensed their big opportunity, and the game became uproarious on field and off.\n\nFIRST-CLASS SAVE\n\nWhen the ball was passed to 'Vernon following a free kick he punched it towards goal without a second's delay and Sprnigett is to be congratulated on sensing this unexpected bullet, and in getting his hands to it to bring off yet another first-class save. Wignall will never do better than when linking up with a brilliant move on the left and pulling the ball square for Vernon to drive it straight at goal without challenge.\n\nLUCKY WEDNESDAY\n\nWednesday were phenomenally lucky to deflect this one for a corner, and a moment later when Wignall again showed his tremendous potential and a good shot the referee seemed alone in think that Springett had not made the save. He gave Wednesday a goal kick believing the ball had spun off the root of the post and not off Snringett's feet. Â Little Bingham was coming in for some pretty rough treatment from Megson. Once again a free kick against the full back passed his side goal. The kick was taken by Vernon who slid the ball through in the general direction of goal with Bingham flicking it between his outstretched legs as it came through to him. This finesse nearly succeeded, but the ball was within an inch or two of the line and had not crossed it, when Johnson, among others, came in to try and retrieve the situation and only succeeded in turning it over the line.Â So Everton went 3-2 ahead in 59 minutes, and with Vernon threatening to make it 4-2 the din was deafening, and certainly a severe affliction on anyone like me who was using a telephone.\n\nFIERCE TACKLING\n\nHaving felt the weight off Everton’s attack at its best, Wednesday were a bit shaken, but their tackling continued to be as fierce as it was accurate' sand Everton had to fight desperately for every yard of ground they gained. Harris (J.) joined the ranks of the shooters and Swan showed his class against Wignall whose game I thought suggested that he will yet become a great centre forward. Brian Harris' determination and his ability to be here, there and everywhere, was a feature of the Everton half back line.Â As showing that Wednesday were far from beaten. Craig seized on a ball and, besting, his man in a space of an inch or two, went on to hit a shot which Dunlop reached only at full stretch--a most valuable piece of goalkeeping.Â Then Bingham taking the ball on the half volley as it dropped from a deflection hit a shot which swerved Ant just outside the far upright. Â At this point Wignall came to the right wing, leaving Bingham to operate at centre forward. Everton should have scored again when Wignall crossed the ball from the right and Johnson in trying to head clear, could only edge it to Harris (J.), Â whose close-in shot struck the outside and not the inside of the net Harris (J.) scored for Everton 87 minutes. Everton 4, Sheffield Wednesday 2.Â\n\nARSENAL DEFEAT A DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nLiverpool Echo - Saturday 03 December 1960\n\nAN UNLUCKY ENDING TO UNBEATEN RUN, SAYS ALEX PARKER\n\nSO our unbeaten run is ended, and while we would have been disappointed to see it go at any time, the manner in which we lost it to Arsenal was doubly disappointing. I reckon the unluckiest defeat Everton have ever suffered since I have been with them was in the home match against Leicester City a couple of years ago, but last Saturday's ran it close. We were three down at halt-time to a David Herd hat-trick, all shots right out of the blue, and while we realised that we had not played as well as we could, it was really only Herd's shooting that had put us so much behind. His first was from a free-kick which was deflected by Jimmy Gabriel into the goal, and his others were from about 25 yards out, the first of these being the best goal I have seen for a very long time. I think David will agree that it may have finished up anywhere but in the back of the net, as is the case with many great goals, but it fairly whistled past Albert Dunlop, and even from so far out our goalkeeper stood no chance with it. We knew that in the second half we could make a fight of it for it was unlikely that Herd would find his shots coming off so well again. But, unfortunately, our luck was right out.Â\n\nHIT WOODWORK\n\nFrank Wignall hit the woodwork once, Bobby Collins hit it twice, and offside spoilt another goal. Still, I am still convinced that the way we were playing, if the game had gone on another 10 minutes we would have gained at least one point. Talking with George Thomson, our new left back, afterwards he told me how much he had enjoyed his first game in English soccer, despite the defeat. The first question any Scot is asked when he comes down here is about the speed of the game, and George told me he found that he did not have same amount of time to move the ball as he had in Scotland. For instance, he said, with Hearts he had time to gather the ball, and then look to see where he was putting it. Down here he has realised that the gathering and passing have to be done in practically one movement. Highbury, of course is one of the finest stadium in the country, and George was very impressed. “But.\" he said. “It didn't impress me as much as Goodison does. I think that place is terrific.\" When I heard on Monday that we were playing Sheffield United in the third round of the F.A. Cup. I immediately thought of what I had read and heard about their display at Anfield on Saturday. Apparently they are much more than an average Second Division side. Â They seem as certain as anything is in this game to gain promotion, and I hear they play very clever soccer. As we at Everton pride ourselves on trying to do the same it should be a very good match.\n\nHAIG AVENUE VISIT\n\nWhite on the subject of Cup-ties. I went to Haig Avenue to see the Southport v. Bangor City replay. There was quite a crowd of us for in addition to myself there was Roy Vernon. Bobby Collins, Alex Young, Jimmy Gabriel, Billy Bingham, Les Shannon and a few of the junior players. It was the first time I had ever been to the ground and we were all very impressed by the state of the pitch. It looked to be in excellent condition.Â Of course, there were quite a few ex-Evertonians taking part in the match. In Southport's team there were Albert Harris, Alan Bentham, Brian Griffiths and Jimmy Blain, while Bangor's skipper is Ken Birch. The Welsh team started off in great style with magnificent headed goal by Ray Gryba, but I think the League side's training told in the end for they gradually got on top, and once there, never looked like losing. Still, it was a very enjoyable match and makes a pleasant change to see some of the smaller sides in action. On Wednesday night I became a spectator again, this time at Anfield to see the Liverpool-Nantes match. Â\n\nONE SIDED\n\nIt was really too one sided to be interesting, for Liverpool were well on top. I doubt if Bert Slater had more than two kicks at the ball in the second half. Jimmy Harrower followed up last week's hat-trick with two penalties against the French team. He side footed the first in past the goalkeeper's left, the Frenchman diving too late He put his second in exactly the same place, but the keeper dived the other way and Jimmy stood with his hands on his hips shaking his head in disbelief. Naturally the crowd thought this very funny. In fact, most people on the ground did with the possible exceptions of the goalkeeper and his team mates. Alex Young travelled down from Scotland on Monday and reported for training at Goodison Park on Tuesday morning. He went up to Bellefield in the coach with the rest of the team, but as his knee is still sore he could not take part in the practice match with the rest of us. So he did as much training as he could with our other “knee\" victim. Mickey Lill. Incidentally. Mickey is making steady progress and at the time of writing was hoping for a game in one of our teams either to-day or next week. Tommy Ring hopes to get his plaster off on Monday and should start training quite soon.\n\nEVERTON ARE GOING RIGHT UP TO THE TOP\n\nMonday, December 5, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nVERNON STARS IN EVERTON’S FINEST HOUR-AND HALF\n\nEVERTON 4, SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 2\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nWith 50,000 spectators, many of them soaked to the skin and warned only by display of their team, roaring them off the ground at the end of their mighty triumph over Sheffield Wednesday at Goodison Park, Everton’s stock soared to new heights.Â Undoubtedly their finest hour so far, at least for many a long year, it by no means represent’s the peak.Â Everton are going straight to the top.Â If this was a fair sample of the thrills, delights and suspense we can expect from soccer to a Super League, then I am all for it, and with Tottenham and Burnley (twice) to be opposed this month, December could provide an intriguing view of the possible shape of things to come.Â With entertainment at such a high level week after week, the most a demanding spectator would find criticism difficult.Â The ground was a revelation, almost as satisfactory in its way, as the team and I hope nobody will suggest disturbing it again; no matter how good a case may be made out for electric heating.Â Wednesday came to Liverpool boasting the tightest defence in the League and despite conceding a goal, in 35 seconds it was not long before everyone realised that for once figures told a convincing story.Â Their goal enjoyed some miraculous escapes due in part to the magnificence of goalkeeper Springett, but the barrack-square efficiency of their well drilled defence became increasingly impressive and for Everton to riddle it to the tune of four goals was a terrific attainment equalled only by Wolves.Â\n\nComposure Gone\n\nIn face of the prolonged Everton barrage in the second half, gaps began to appear where there had been one before, tackles seemed just that split second slower, and though Wednesday never hoisted the white flag it was obvious that their composure had gone.Â Everton could not have achieved this performance by craft and artistry alone, for while I would hesitate to label this Wednesday rearguard dirty, some of them were robust sometimes to the extreme edge of the dividing line.Â Wignall was knocked down like a skittle with a frequency which was only rivalled by the hammering which came Bingham’s way and any show of resultant hesitant might have been fatal to Everton’s cause.Â There was none.Â The Everton players took the punishment like sportsmen and far from folding under the pressure struck out bravely and resolutely so that it was Wednesday who broke first.Â Sheffield Wednesday retiring at half-time with a 2-1 lead, brought about by goals from Ellis (6 minutes) and Craig (28) against Vernon’s opening thunderbolt had impressed everybody as a thoroughly efficient and able side.Â They had swung the game round their way and I found no reason to grumble either with their lead or their place in the table, even if Springett had affected the most brilliant saves from Collins and Vernon, and Jimmy Harris had fluffed the offering of a lifetime from Vernon.Â Plainly Everton were struggling but they resumed like fighting furies.Â It is not sufficient for a team aiming to be truly great to have only class and quality to back their cause.Â A huge fighting heart is always an urgent necessity and how comforting it was to find that this was a quality which is theirs in measure equally generous as their artistry.Â\n\n“Take It Roy”\n\nWhen Collins stepped aside from a penalty kick after Johnson pushed out a Jimmy Harris header from under the bar, and said to Vernon.Â “You take this Roy,” It was almost an acknowledgement of the fact that this was Vernon’s day.Â With a disarming subtlety he lobbed the ball past Springett and Everton were on terms.Â While Vernon danced, dominated and devastated to give his finest show in an Everton jersey, made the more commendable because it was achieved against opposition as tough and capable as there is to be found anywhere Collins was content to fill a minor role, well though he played.Â Behind them Labone was less robust, but just as uncompromising as the flint-like Swan, and Brian Harris and Jimmy Gabriel, tackling like machine were always on the look-out for chances to convert defence into attack.Â Although there was a general excellence about wing halves in this game, not easily matched none of them I though excelled.Â Harris in his attacking excursions.Â If there was ever a query about this lad’s qualifications to rank with Everton’s great players it must now have gone.Â It took 61 minutes for Everton to lead for the second time and again Vernon was the man behind the goal.Â His free kick following unceremonious treatment of Bingham skimmed along the ground, Bingham opened his legs to allow free passenger and at the last spilt second made a deflecting contact, which caught the defence on the wrong foot.Â All Johnson could do was to stab out a protesting foot, which simply helped the ball over the line and Goodison echoed and re-echoed to an outburst of frenzied enthusiasm.\n\nAlarms Sounded\n\nOne or two notable alarms were to be sounded particularly when Finney skied the ball over the top from an admirable position before Everton set all doubts at rest three minutes from the end, Vernon it was again who measured a through ball to Jimmy Harris to perfection for the winger-turned centre-forward to hammer the ball home.Â This was Everton’s joy day complete, for the victory was emphatic, meritorious and positively inspiring.Â In a scene crowded with talent, Vernon was gifted enough to undisputed the starring role.Â He was the man Wednesday could not control.Â Whether he was laying wide the way for others or tearing through on his own, he was equally effective and only a combination of bad luck and Springett splendour prevented him gaining his first Everton hat-trick, although he has now score fourteen League goals.Â Finney needed only a few minutes to decide that an afternoon’s opposition to a Parker in tip-top form was just about the most futile way of spending an afternoon and promptly exchanged wings with Griffin, a move which imposed an impossible strain on Thomson on view at Goodison for the first time.Â Still struggling to adapt himself to the change of pace, Thomson was on the losing end throughout but that he is a first class long term prospect I am convinced.Â Until he settles into the rhythm there must inevitably be anxious moments.Â One could scarcely be other than enthralled by the work of Kay, the essence of competence and Craig was a lurking menace who had to be kept on the tightest of tight-reins.Â An incident which received more applause than most was when Vernon raced up behind an opponent and with a dexterous flick took the ball yet how many realised that this was a replica of the move which brought his dismissal at Nottingham.Â The difference was that this time Vernon got the ball.Â On the other occasion he got marching orders, but the game at least showed that Vernon has pushed the apparent injustice right out of his system.Â Everton; Dunlop; Parker, Thomson; Gabriel, Labone, H. Harris; Bingham, Collins, Wignall, Vernon, J. Harris.Â Sheffield Wednesday;- Springett; Johnson, Megson; McAnearney, Swan, Kay; Griffins, Craig, Ellis, Fantham, Finney.Â Referee; Mr. W.

I cannot see the players accepting less than their demands in which case the long - awaited Everton v. Tottenham game might be in jeopardy. With all stand tickets sold that would pose a pretty problem. Were there to be a strike, certain clubs might elect to break it by meeting their players' demands. This defection from the Football League by some of the finest teams in the land could only lead to chaos. I hope it does not come to that, but I fear it might. When and if the players' maximum is removed Everton will be among those whose weekly wage bill will rocket. We saw evidence again on Saturday, when they beat Sheffield Wednesday by four goals to two, that they have extraordinary talent in every department. They are riding the crest of the waveâa wave which shows no sign of breaking. Their forthcoming home fixtures against Spurs, Burnley and Aston Villa may, cause marked reshuffling of the top six. If these games produce the drama and sustained excitement of the match against Wednesday we shall be well satisfied. No one, it seems, is suffering indigestion from the rich mixture we are being given, almost match by match, at Goodison Park. This after starvation diet makes the pleasantest of changes.\n\nLed deservedly\n\nWednesday were a great side for 45 minutes and led deservedly, by 2-1, at the interval. Then, as so often happens, Everton slipped into top gear and the others looked second best and finished second best. There was one moment at 3-2 when Fantham might have scored if he had chosen to shoot. Instead, he tried to tee-up a certainty for Finney and Finney's re-actionâand shotâwas deplorable. Thus Jimmy Harris (wanted at West Bromwich, but by no means certain to go there) was able to go on to get the clinching fourth, from a Vernon pass, a few minutes from time. And 4-2 about represented the difference between the sides. Few goals this season have been greeted as deliriously as the one Vernon got in the first minute. Craig had had his shot blocked by the towering Labone and Fantham had seen his deflected shot brilliantly anticipated by Dunlop before the goalkeeper, kicking from hand, punched the ball far up field to the region of the far side of the centre circle. Here Vernon, who had anticipated the skid of the ball as it struck the turf, was able to gain possession, draw Springett and then calmly turn the ball slowly into an open goal. The crowd's reaction was to jump for joy, and if you've never seen 50,000 fans do this, with a forest of waving arms for good measure. You’ve missed one of the sights of our football-crazed city. Wednesday might have been excused losing morale, but they didn't, and when they levelled the scores many must have had niggling doubts about the possible result.\n\nSplendid volley\n\nTHE goal was a good one, starting at McAnearney and finishing via Fantham, at Ellis who was tall enough to leap higher than others and glance the ball in with his head. The volley the busy little Craig hit home for 1-2 was a splendid one. By this time Wednesday, the bigger and more commanding side, seemed set to win and with Finney switched almost from the start to the other wing, better serviced with chances in the second-half it could have been a different story. Yet there was no doubt that Wednesday had enjoyed what breaks were about. Springett, for instance, saved one shot with a foot after going down all too early. His save from a glancing Collins header (from Wignall's centre) was the finest of the match. Dunlop, not nearly so busy, showed his propensity for doing daring deeds after long spells of inaction. I put him in the Swindin class as a goalkeeper who has been most unfortunate never to get a full cap. It is not often free-kicks bring justice as satisfying as those given in Bingham's favour in the second half. Twice Megson cut the feet from under the Irishman; twice Everton \"converted\" Vernon's free-kicks. Wignall nodded the ball towards goal where Johnson fisted it out in the first case and Vernon scored from the penalty spot. In the second case Bingham, turning the ball as it sped between his outstretched legs, all but scored direct and what a goal that would have been ! -before Johnson, in trying to screw the ball clear, slipped and turned it, instead over the line.\n\nOvation for both\n\nIT was nice to see both teams getting a standing ovation at the end. It was good to see Everton confirm the view that they can be unbeatable at best. Though Referee Clements, from West Bromwich, kept a firm grip on the pace at which the game was fought and the grim determination of both sides, especially in defence, made it one of the toughest and most difficult to handle. Except for Collins and the red-head Kay getting at cross purposes for a moment there was hardly a thing to which anyone could take exception. For me the outstanding figures were Finney, Kay, Parker, Brian Harris and Vernon. Finney's artistry in passing a defender or even two was lost on none; Kay's distribution of the ball and his tacklingâlightning fast and unrelenting even when the first one failedâput him in a niche of his own, though not everyone in the crowd appreciated him. There were times when Vernon on a yielding surface held the ball too long and lost it when outnumbered, but he still played brilliantly and for once outshone \" wee Bobby\" who is surely entitled to have a game now and then which falls short of his consistent best. Brian Harris play was superb, Wignall came in for some stern handling from Swan, but I noticed him showing remarkable football acumen and if he could somehow quicken his mental reflexes and his stride he would emerge as dangerous a leader as there is. I like him more and more. Derek Temple, too, has a great potential if it can only be developed. Ellis, at centre, was the one weakness in the Wednesday eleven. The beaten side had non to compare with Alex Parker who had is best game for months and rather put new boy George Thomson in the background. Thomson is very new to English football and would seem to require more time than he was given on Saturday to show what he can do.\n\nSANDY YOUNG THE SECOND\n\nLiverpool Echo - Monday 05 December 1960\n\nAmid all the excitement of the signing of Alex (Sandy-haired) Young from Hearts few have had time to recollect that this Is the second top-line Scottish International centre-forward of precisely the same Christian and surname who has been on Everton's books (writes Leslie Edwards). The first was the famous Alexander (Sandy) Young who scored the only goal of the game for Everton, at Crystal Palace, in the Cup final of 1906 against Newcastle United. He played for Scotland in 1903 against England and in 1907 against Wales. His Cup exploit led to famous song. “Heigh-ho, Sandy scored the goal, Sandy scored the goal, Sandy scored the goal.\" Alexander Young, the second, who has yet to make his debut for Everton has played for Scotland several times, the first occasion being against England last season. Sandy Young, the first, immigrated to Australia after leaving Goodison Park and was Involved, there, in a case of manslaughter.Â\n\nSHALE “PITCH” AT GOODISON\n\nLiverpool Echo - Tuesday 06 December 1960\n\nRESURACING OF PRACTICE GROUND\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton F.C. have decided to put a red court surface on their 50 yards by 40 yards practice ground at Goodison Park. The firm which made such a good job of the relaying of then pitch has been given the contract.Â The effect will be to provide a firm, dry surface under lights which will be available to amateur players for their twice-weekly training sessions held, until now, in the gym under the stand. Years ago the practice ground was wired experimentally against frost. In recent seasons it has tended to become water-logged. Â First team players will use the ground as requiredâthat is whenever it is felt their training ground at Bellefield, West Derby, does not provide decent “going.Â\n\nHE ENVIES EVERTON ONE THING- THEIR FANS\n\nLiverpool Echo - Tuesday 06 December 1960\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nIt will interest many to know that Sheffield Wednesday manager, the old Everton forward, Harry Catterick, envies Everton only one thing-those spectators ! He thinks, and so do his players who were here on Saturday, they're worth a goal start. And who am I to argue with those who have heard Everton's famous roar at close quarters ? Harry believes these terrace onlookers are reaping the reward for their enthusiasm over many postwar years when to watch some Everton teams was a chore and certainly not everyone's idea of the ideal Saturday afternoon. I confess to some surprise at the warmth of applause given to the play of visiting sides this season. That, too, is something, of which to be proud. It could be that Everton's and Liverpool's successâand the probability that they are winning or going to!-sweetens the spectator to the point at which he is prepared to show his appreciation of cleverness by our friends the opposition! Too often in the past the city has gained the reputation for being cruel to the players of both sides. Of this fault the barracking of a home man is much the more heinous. With Catterick, Joe Mercer and Harry Potts all leading teams in the first half dozen in the First Division table Everton can be proud of the former players they have sent on their way as managers, but Harry Potts must beware lest he sets some other river than the Seine on fire with his tantrums. My own belief is that the league should insist that none but the trainer sits on the trainers' bench. It is quite easy, with a telephone at hand, for any manages to his instructions to the field from a seat in the stand. Â Then the trainer could hang up the receiver (and the conversation) whenever the spirit moved him!\n\nGood enough is big enough\n\nMR. BILL PRITCHARD, of Alaunia, Bushell Road, Neston, writes “I must comment on the views of your correspondent, Mr. D. Jones, regarding the signing of Alex Young.” Well do I remember sharing a billet in Tunis with the late Alex Jackson, then the Eighth Army Sports Officer, whom many will recollect as ranking as one of the best wingers ever. “Our conversation naturally turned to football and on so many points we agreed, but when I voiced the opinion that Bill Dean was the greatest centre forward I had ever seen, Alex voted Hughie Gallacher even better. \" I argued somewhat on the lines of Mr. Jones and of Dean's advantage at taking centres from the wings, he being 5ft. 10ins, and Gallacher in the region of 5ft 6 Â½ ins. But Alex pointed out firmly that the whole art of football was positional sense and a true ball player would always come out on top. He quoted the famous Scottish forward line of Blue DevilsâJackson, Dunn, Gallacher, James and Morton all wee except Alex himself. “Answering Mr. Jones further. May I say that I am content to back John Carey's judgment? He has bought big of his own choice and results have proved his sound football acumen. Thus, I see no reason to doubt that he has failed to pick the right man in Young, in whom he has been very interested for some time. Obviously Everton in their present mood have the pick of all players and so must consider Young the centre-forward for their line. \"To play between two of the caliber of Collins and Vernon requires skill and brains and finally let us remember that Mr. Carey is no doubt implementing again his promise of entertainment by paying Â£XX,000 for Scotland's centre.\"\n\nHARRIS SIGNS FOR BIRMINGHAM\n\nLiverpool Echo - Tuesday 06 December 1960\n\nSubstantial Fee\n\nBy Harold Wolfe\n\nJimmy Harris, Everton's under - 23 international forward, was to-day transferred to Birmingham City at a fee said to be a \"substantial\" one. Harris has missed only one game for Everton this season, succeeded Dave Hickson at centre forward, but has appeared at outside left in the last two League matches. A native of Birkenhead, he has been with Everton since he was 15, and made his senior debut in August. 1955. He played in England's Under-23 side in 1956. Harris is likely to make his debut for his new club against Everton at St. Andrew on Saturday.\n\nJIMMY HARRIS CHOOSES BIRMINGHAM\n\nWednesday, December 7, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nDID RELEGATION DANGER-TURN THE SCALE AGAINST W. BROMWICH?\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nAlthough Birmingham City did not make known their interest in Jimmy Harris, the Everton forward until Saturday, when they watched his score his fifth League goal of the season against Sheffield Wednesday, they signed him for Â£20,000 yesterday, and he makes his debut today at St. Andrews against B.K. Copenhagen in the Inter-Cities Fair Cup.Â West Bromwich Albion were shocked by the announcement for they had been first in the field last Thursday, before there had been any hint that Harris might be on the move.Â He had promised them an answer in the next week or so, after having had time to consider the proposal, but the Birmingham approach rapidly brought the position to a head.Â Birmingham agreed terms by telephone yesterday and team manager Gil Merrick accompanied by chief coach Don Dolman travelled to Goodison to complete the deal.Â Harris went back to Birmingham with them.Â I gather that West Bromwich manager, Mr. Gordon Clark, rather sensed that unless he could clinch a deal with Harris quickly his hopes of getting the player would flag, as other clubs were alerted to transfer possibilities.Â\n\nNeighbouring Club\n\nNot only did this prove to be true, but it must have been particularly disappointing to find himself beaten by a neighbouring club, who like themselves are making their strengthening moves now before the spectre of relegation becomes more substantial.Â Why did Harris choose Birmingham?Â Possibly he saw himself destined to Second Division football next season had he signed for West Brom.Â They may be only four points worse off than Birmingham, but their recent record is not exactly inspiring.Â Their last victory was on October 15 and since then they have scored only six goals while conceding 20.Â In the same period Birmingham have won three and lost five.Â Although Harris has only five League goals to his credit this season he will arrive at Birmingham as their second highest scorer, for Hellawell leads the way with a total boosted to six by two goals last Saturday at Blackpool.Â Last season Birmingham took Don Weston from Wrexham in an abortive attempt to give more punch to their attack.Â It is curious that Harris should go to the Midlands for Â£20,000 in view of the fact that Dave Hickson the man he originally supplanted at Everton also moved on to that area as an Aston Villa player for a similar amount when he first found his place in the Everton side in jeopardy.Â\n\nAgainst Everton\n\nProviding he comes through todayâs debut unscathed, Harris will make his first League appearance in Birminghamâs blue against his old team-mates in a match in which it is possible that Alex Young will be wearing Harrisâs old jersey in the opposing Everton side for the first time.Â Last nightâs news was that Young was still not 100 per cent, fit and will not play in the Army game at Middlesbrough today.Â Whether the extra couple of days rest will restore him to fitness for Saturdayâs is something which no-one can yet say with certainty.Â Young is eager to open his English league career as soon as possible, but will not be allowed to let enthusiasm be the only guide, if there is the slightest doubt the opening of a new career which may make such a wonderful difference to Everton, will be delayed a little longer.Â It was good to hear that Mickey Lill was able to take part in a practice match yesterday, his first all-out action since his cartilage operation in October.Â If there is no reaction to the exercise, Lill will be ready for a game in earnest this week-end.Â Tommy Ring has had the plaster removed from his leg and replaced by a lighter gaiter but the report is of satisfactory progress.Â Possibly encouraged by the fact that Birmingham have been able to prise Jimmy Harris away from Goodison Park another League club have sounded Everton about the possibility of being able to do business with the club skipper Tommy Jones but I gather there was no encouragement for their enterprise.Â\n\nYOUNG MAY MAKE DEBUT ON SATURDAY\n\nLiverpool Echo - Wednesday 07 December 1960\n\nMissed Army Game To-day\n\nGOOD PROGRESS\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton's new centre forward, Alex Young, disappointed at missing to-days game for The Army against Middlesbrough, at Middlesbrough, is pleased with his progress towards fitness and could be in the Everton side at Birmingham on Saturday. If he were available, Everton would be particularly keen to give him a full scale run with his new team-mates in view of the game against Tottenham a week on Saturday at Goodison Park. Jimmy Gabriel, another of Everton's star Scots is having hospital visits this week for penicillin injections after a tooth extraction. He played against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday despite feeling off colour. Micky Lill, now well on the way to fitness after cartilage operation, played a full practice yesterday and is likely to get a game on Saturday but it is too early to think of his return to first team duty.\n\nHARRIS LEADS CITY\n\nJimmy Harris signed from Everton yesterday, leads the Birmingham attack against (Copenhagen) in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup match at St. Andrews to-night. He replaces Jimmy Stager, who joined City from Newport in September.\n\nFIVE GAMES IN A WEEK\n\nLiverpool Echo - Wednesday 07 December 1960\n\nIN the days when Sandy Young played for Everton the weekly wage was not Â£24 but Â£4. Bob Trueman, from Birkenhead, was recalling this when telling me how Sandy, after leaving Everton for Spurs, joined South Liverpool in their Grafton Street days and was promised by the late W. J. Sawyer Â£2 a match for the rest of the season. “And we've plenty of matches.\" he added. Â Sandy Young signed and, due to a glut of fixtures, played five times in his first week! Then he went off to Will Cuff, at Everton, and said. \"Fancy, when I played for a great team like Everton I was on Â£4 a week; here in my first week with a village team I've drawn a termer!\" Mc. Cuff's retort can only be imagined. Bob Trueman, who knew Sandy Young well, explained that he was one of a few with a gimmick (no such word in those days). He invariably went on field wearing a solid black, leather belt. Everton Idols, wee Alex Stevenson and Dixie Dean (whose life story strip begins next Saturday in the Football Echo) are again in action alongside each other. Dean has been licensee of the Dublin Packet in Chester for some Years; now to his left, the position he occupied when they were at Everton, is Stevenson who has become host of the Shropshire Arms. As soon as he heard of the arrival of Alex, Dixie went along to see the 5ft 4 Â½ in, Irishman who played at inside-forward with him for three years. In Dixie's bar are ranged the impressive array of international caps he gained while playing for England. Alex has countered with his equally formidable collection of Irish capsâabout 20âa few gained when he played for Glasgow Rangers and the remainder while he was with Everton. Stevenson left Everton in 1949 and became a national coach with the League of Ireland. Later he was manager of the Waterford club. Other Everton players who are now licensees are Norman Greenhalgh (Bromborough Hotel), Ted Sagar (Blue Anchor. Aintree), George Burnett (Pilot Boat. New Brighton) and Eddie Wainwright (Medlock Hotel, Liverpool).\n\n“Daddy” of them all\n\nREADER Alfred E. Jones, 38 Snaefell Avenue, Liverpool 13. says:â \"Your correspondent Mr. N. Jones, of Dinas Lane, is prepared to ignore the footballing ability of Alex Young simply because he is not a six-footer \"Many more, like Mr. Jones are obsessed with the idea that if a player Is around the six-foot mark. He must be good. The command of the air is not won by height. It is a question of judgment and timing. \"Most of the Everton centre-forwards, he says, were tall men. What about Sandy Young, Bobby Parker (Scotch), Boy Browell? Â They weren't six-footers and they seemed to have done alright' \"its football we want to see, not head-ball. After all the greater percentage of the game is played with the ball on the ground. \"We have had some small men in defence too. Dicky Downs, Jack Taylor. Tommy Lucas, Jimmy (Parson) Jackson. All those could out-head the best. Do the big man brigade think Bobby Collins would be a better footballer if he was taller? \"Oh! Mr. Jones if we could only, sign another Hughie Gallagher (5ft. 5in.). The 'daddy' of them all.\"\n\nROY VERNON SUSPENDED FOR FOURTEEN DAYS\n\nLiverpool Echo - Thursday 08 December 1960\n\nWill Miss Vital League Game With Tottenham\n\nEVERTON SHOCKED\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nEverton F.C. were shocked to-day to receive notification that their star Welsh International inside forward. Roy Vernon, had been suspended for 14 days as from yesterday. This means Vernon will not be able to help his side in the most vital League championship match against Tottenham, here, on Saturday week and that he misses the game on Saturday at Birmingham and the League Cup tie at Tranmere on Monday. The suspension arises from his sending off at Nottingham, against Nottingham Forest, on October 29. Mr. F. Reid, of Letchworth, ordered him from the field four minutes from the end for a tackle, from behind, on Iley. Vernon was no less surprised than many spectators. He and his club have awaited, anxiously (but with confidence, I thinks) the result of the deliberations of an F.A. Disciplinary Committee. It was thought that the Committee which sat at Crewe about a fortnight ago would deal with the case, but the matter did not arise. A new Committee, sitting in London yesterday, decided on 14 days suspension. The news is sensational for more than one reason, Everton felt their case so good they did not demand a personal hearing. When Vernon had been given opportunity to review the evidence his club had got together he agreed, I understand, that no useful purpose would be served by asking for a personal hearing. The F.A. have plainly taken into account the fact that he has been sent off twice this year. Lost season not long before he joined Everton, he was ordered from the field in a fierce Cup replay between his club, Blackburn Rovers and Sunderland, at Sunderland. This offence also cost him suspension. Everton's feeling of optimism about the case is understandable. The evidence they offered included Press reports and letters (one I believe which bad appeared in the Echo). Many of the letters were from Nottingham Forest season ticket holders and included one from an official of the team's Supporters' club. All these writers of pleas for leniency spoke of their amazement that a player should be sent to the dressing-room for such a trifling offence. Mr. Carey, the Everton manager, whose wife's mother died last night, in Manchester, would offer no comment on the decision when I spoke to him, but it was plain that he was surprised and very disappointed about it. Having transferred Jimmy Harris to Birmingham Tuesday, he now finds that Vernon's absence for the game at Birmingham and more important, against Spurs leaves him with a restricted number of men from which to select his attack. Vernon, who is 23, comes from Holywell, in Flintshire. He joined Blackburn Rovers 'then managed by the present Everton manager straight from school and developed quickly into one of the finest forwards Wales have ever had. He is slightly built, weighing about 10 stones, but is strong on the ball.\n\nSIGNED IN JANUARY\n\nHis rather fiery Welsh temperament, his artistry, his big shot for so light a man, and his ability to make the most telling passes are all facets of his football make-up. He joined Everton, unexpectedly last January after visiting Merseyside initially and returning to Blackburn saying that hit would not be coming here. Vernon confessed to \"being shattered\" that the referee at Nottingham should order him off. News of his suspension will be even harder to bear. Only one man, so far as I can see, will be pleased about It- the Tranmere Rovers' goalkeeper, George Payne, who now has no Vernon barrage to face in the Cup-tie at Prenton next Monday.Â\n\nREMOVING THE STING\n\nLiverpool Echo - Thursday 08 December 1960\n\nIs a manager to be judged on the players he signs?Â Or the players he transfers'? Or both? The third would seem to be the answer. If it is take a look at these Everton transfers out in the period since Mr. Carey joined the club. It is an astonishing list of outgoings without equal anywhere else in League football; Peter Harburn, Dave Hickson, Jimmy Harris, Eddie O'Hara, Eddie Thomas, Alan Shackleton, Graham Williams, Wally Fielding. Ken Rea, Jimmy O'Neill, Alan Sanders. Alec Ashworth, Eddie Bramwell, Bobby Laverick, Jim Tansey, and Hood, Parkes, Godfrey, Griffiths, Bentham, Blain, Shepherd, Billington and Watson (these last rarely, if ever, used in the first team). Thomas and Ashworth and Bramwell were involved in deals by which players came to Goodison, but the cash return taken from others on this long list must go a long way toward removing the sting of the sums paid for such men as Gabriel, Ring, Lill, Young and Thomson, among others, The steady coming and going of players has not seemed quick, but when one looks at the existing team and at the army of those who have left, the almost complete change of staff is dramatic. And in spite of It Everton are playing better. I think, than in their great championship days pre-war when Dean's head and feet were the things which really mattered.\n\nMr. D. Hackworth, of 5 Stretton Avenue, Wallasey, writes:â\" I am one of the many thousands of Merseyside soccer fans who is proud that football in our city is showing such great promise at last. It is revelation to have both senior clubs second from top in their respective divisions. \"Perhaps the greater praise must naturally go to the Everton Board and to Manager Carey for their expensive but very astute acquisition of class players. It is apparent to all that the transformation of the team is now beginning to reap long-awaited rewards, and this new-found success is doubly enhanced by the fact that the team have not yet reached their peak, mainly owing to injury problems. Finally, a word about Liverpool. They should certainly gain promotion this season and thoroughly deserve to do so, but they may need to strengthen their team, in a similar manner to Everton, to gain further honours next season. “\n\nSUSPENSION FEELS LIKE PRISON SENTENCE\n\nFriday, December 9, 1960 The Liverpool Daily Post\n\n14 DAYS WITHOUT OPTION MAKE ME AN OUTCAST FROM GOODISON PARK\n\nSays Roy Vernon\n\nFourteen Days without the option!Â It sounds like a prison sentence doesn’t it and that’s just what it sounded like to me when I arrived at the Everton club offices yesterday, except that bearer of the evil tidings, secretary Mr. W. Dickenson was not perched up on a bench, nor were there any of the legal trapping but for all that my heart sank right down to my boots.Â “You’re joking,” I said as Mr. Dickinson announced my suspension.Â “I couldn’t be more serious,” said Mr. Dickinson and for a moment my football world seemed to go up in flames.Â If I had expected some sort of punishment as a result of my dismissal in the game against Nottingham Forest on October 29, the impact would have been far less severe but I was so confident that I had done no wrong and that I would be honourably acquitted that this verdict was like a slap in the face.Â My legs went weak and now I know exactly how a pricked balloon would feel as the air rushes out if only a balloon were capable of feeling.Â I am shattered by the apparent injustice of it all.Â Possible I have been lulled into a sort of fool’s paradise by the flood of letters from impartial sources and expressions of opinion from people who owe allegiance neither in Everton nor to me; that so trifling was the offence for which I was dismissed that punishment of this sort was unthinkable.Â It is not with the length of the suspension that I quarrel for it was fairly obvious that as this was the second time I had been ordered from the field a conviction would automatically carry that punishment.Â It is with the conviction itself that I am at variance.Â When I was sent off while playing for Blackburn Rovers against Sunderland and I make no bones about it.Â I retaliated under extreme provocation, as I thought and I deserved my seven days, put if only I could feel that this suspension were equally meritorious it would be so much easier to bear.Â\n\nMarked Man\n\nThis decision must make me a marked me, for I have now been ordered off twice yet for the life of me I cannot even begin to regard myself as a dirty player.Â All I can say is that I have taken very much more punishment that I can ever hand out if I play until I am forty.Â The referee’s report on which the Disciplinary Committee has taken action stated that the marching orders came as punishment for an accumulation of foul-play.Â His case was that he had spoken to me on three occasions in passing for offences committed by me.Â I can honestly say that I recall only one exchange of words between us.Â After Bobby Collins had been subjected to what I thought was a serious foul, I asked the referee if he was going to send off the player to whom he was talking, I was ordered away, and away I went.Â I am neither deaf nor a liar and there is nothing wrong with my memory, so that when I say I have no recollection of any other word from the referee I am telling the whole truth as I reconstruct the situation.Â My belief all the way through is that I was the victim of mistaken identity and as I see things the referee’s report confirms it just as forcibly as anything possible could.Â He believes he spoke to me three times.Â I say he didn’t, if he speak to someone else, in the belief I say he didn’t, if he spoke to someone else, in the belief it was me, then that could be the explanation.Â In no sense do I criticise the club advice I was given not to ask for a personal hearing for such was the excellence of the report made out on my behalf that after reading it through I was even more confident that no harm could come my way.Â Obviously the committee have backed the referee and accepted his view in preference to that of numerous others and of course it is light that referee should be supported always providing there is no reasonable doubt about the views he expresses.Â I submit that in view of the evidence in was able to offer there should have been a reasonable doubt raised and as such I was entitled to the benefit of it.Â For my part I believe the referee’s report was exaggerated, I more little relation to my view of the facts, but I am not accusing the referee of vindictiveness in any way.Â My firm belief is that he made a mistake and throughout the piece he as labouring under a misapprehension.Â I bear him no grudge, hard though this decision is to bear, for in my moment of acutest distress I do not believe he was in any way vindictive.Â He made a mistake, such as we all make from time to time, but unfortunately it is not only Roy Vernon, who has to take the blow, I am worried in case it should do anything to undermine the wonderful team spirit we have built up at Everton.Â I shall miss Everton’s game at Birmingham tomorrow, the League Cup game against Tranmere Rovers on Monday and the match of matches against Tottenham on Saturday week.Â\n\nLetting team down\n\nLike the rest of the Everton boys I have been living for the visit of Spurs to Goodison and now I feel that through no fault of my own I am letting down the whole team, I know they feel almost as badly about the whole thing as I do.Â Financially of course, it will be quite a blow especially coming as it does so near to Christmas.Â I shall lose two weeks playing money at Â£20 a week, Â£13 against Tranmere Rovers on Monday, always providing Everton win, and Â£4 bonuses against both Birmingham and Tottenham assuming an Everton victory in each case.Â In any event I shall have been deprived the opportunity of trying to earn those bonuses so if you should find a Father Christmas in one of the local stores in the next fortnight don’t pass him without a kindly word, it might be me.Â Seriously I couldn’t feel worse about it than I do.Â Imagine being barred from Goodison Park for fourteen days, not seeing the lads and engaging in the marry chatter and not being able to see my team in action.Â I am an outcast from Goodison.Â Is it any wonder, I feel badly about it?Â The only consolation I derive from the sorry business is that the delay in hearing my case at least enabled me to play for Wales against England at Wembley.Â I wouldn’t have missed that for anything but if I had been suspended then, I would not have had the consolation of opposing Tottenham.Â There is also the question of training, I shall have to find some open space to try and keep myself fit, without all the convenience and advantages of Goodison.Â To neglect training for a fortnight would necessitate a period of seven to ten days to get fit again and a fortnight out is bad enough.Â I was just feeling on top of the world.Â People told me that I was playing good stuff and whether that was flatters of not at least I was enjoying my games.Â I have no right of appeal and so the only thing left for me is to express the hope that when I rejoin the club they will be four better off than they are now and ready to face their next foes in the League Cup.Â\n\nVERNON DID NOT DESERVE SUCH A HARSH DECISION\n\nFriday, December 9, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nRoy Vernon, suspended for fourteen days as from December 7.Â That was the announcement-made by the F.A yesterday and it went on to add.Â “The suspension was on misconduct on the field.”Â I can only say that I am appalled at the decision.Â Having seen the game I can say with all the sincerity I can muster that Vernon never came within the proverbial mile of committing an offence worthy of dismissal and to impose upon him a suspension of this nature amounts in my estimation to a savage decision.Â Readily do I concede that I was not on the field of play and consequently could not hear any of the asides which are said to have passed from the referee to the player, but at least I can say that the referee, if he did speak to Vernon on three occasions, was the soul of discretion, for I did not spot his action.Â I can say without the slightest fear of contradiction that in nine out of ten of any League matches played on any day of any season it is possible to spot offences far more serious than that for which Vernon was dismissed, without so much as producing a word from the referee to the offender.Â A free kick for a foul has so often replaced the extreme penalty which Vernon is now order to pay.Â If the standard of conduct-which apparently is called for if this is to be taken as a criterion- were to be generally accepted football would cease to exist as we know it today.Â Players would be fearful of making tackles and would hold up their hands in horror if the tackled player should happen to fall.Â In nearly thirty years of sports reporting without hesitation I label the dismissal of Vernon as the hardest I have ever seen and that is a view liberally shared by those who saw the Nottingham Forest match, I hold no brief for any player, but I do like to see fair play all round.Â\n\nMistaken Identity\n\nVernon, I believe the explanation lies in the fact that this was a clear case of mistaken identity.Â If Vernon was guilty of the conduct for which he now goes into exile for a fortnight, I can only plead guilty to the grossest dereliction of duty in failing to fault his conduct.Â There was one example of hacking and elbowing in this same game which was far and away more serious than anything else in the match not a dirty match by any stretch of imagination and yet the offenders in the case merely had their names taken.Â Â The Disciplinary Committee arrived at their decision on the evidence before it.Â The mistake is not theirs.Â This was a case in my humble submission which should never have reached them at all.Â If only there could be an independent arbiter at every game it would be a great help in cases such as this, although fortunately they do not arise very frequently.Â\n\nPersonal Hearing\n\nCould anything more have been done for Vernon than was done?Â In my opinion, yes, I know that Everton acted as they thought best for their player in deciding against a personal hearing, but I admit that I was dismayed when I heard the decision.Â The mere fact that a personal hearing was not asked far meant that there was no necessity for the referee to attend to give his evidence and submit himself to examination; I can imagine the framing of several questions to the referee which might have produced illumination answers.Â It was only necessary to cast doubt on the accuracy of his observations to earn an acquittal.Â Rightly or wrongly that could have been done, but without a personal hearing the referee’s report must be unquestioned.Â In any event I would have felt far more satisfied if the referee had been questioned and had given completely satisfactory answers.Â Vernon I know was happy to fall in with the recommendation made by the club and mine may be a minority view but if the full defensive battery had gone into action, as was the case when Dave Hickson faced a Disciplinary Committee I would have felt happier to accept the verdict than I do now.Â Manager John Carey will not announce his team to visit Jimmy Harris’s Birmingham side until today, but if Alex Young plays as expected, there may still be a place for Frank Wignall in view of the enforced withdrawal of Vernon.Â Jimmy Gabriel has not been all his best for several days following a gum infection after the withdrawal of his tooth, but I have heard no suggestion, that he will not be fit.Â As expected Jimmy Harris will lead the Birmingham attack for the first time in a League game against his former team-mates and if this proves to be Jimmy’s biggest effort of the season, nobody will be surprised, for Harris will naturally want to impress both Birmingham and Everton.Â Birmingham; Withers; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Hellawell, Stubbs, Harris, Bloomfield, Taylor.Â\n\nWIGNALL CONTINUES AS EVERTON ELADER\n\nLiverpool Echo - Friday 09 December 1960\n\nAlex young still unfit\n\nTyrer Comes In\n\nBy Leslie Edwards\n\nAlex Young will not, after all, make his debut for Everton at Birmingham to-morrow. It had been expected that he would play there after recovering from the knee injury he suffered playing for The Army a few days before Everton signed him. Wignall thus continues to lead the attack. Collins is, switched to inside-left to take the place of Roy Vernon, who is under suspension, and Tyrer, the club's 18-years-old reserve forward comes in at inside-right and Temple returns at outside-left. Otherwise the team is unchanged.

The crew of a B.0.A.C. plane (including a Liverpool man, Mr. D. A. Heald) have found, despite the rail and dock strike which has caused a shortage of beer, a little hostelry near Bowen, Queensland, where the tap still runs. To Australians who have worked all week in a climate of 95-100 degrees the prospect of a dry Saturday night is a nightmare unparalleled in terms of other disasters such as floods, bush fires and the loss of the Ashes. Mr. Heald and his crew members are on route from Southampton to Sydney and are billeted for four days' rest in a small wooden hotel, near the shore, five miles out of Bowen, a pleasant if primitive spot, but one of the few places with beer and a burly landlord character named Bill Koegler who keeps his clients amused with stories of war-time days when the area bad been a supply base for the Aussies as their last-line defence against the enemy in New Guinea. The little bar scarcely contains \" Tiny” the aircraft’s navigator once one of Tommy Farr's sparring partners-he stands six feet 7 inches tall and weighed 19 stone âand who drinks nothing but milk.\n\nLike a typhoon\n\nThe party are washing away the heat of the day in iced beer when the night is disturbed by the roar of arrival of a battered old car crammed with genuine slouch-hatted, bare-chested, brown-as-kippers. back-wood robbers ready for their Saturday night's spree. They hit the bar with the impact of a Coral Sea typhoon. The landlord protests unavailingly Residents only, here.\" To deny a bunch of red-blooded Aussies their birthright would be tantamount to wanting to have one's pub off its stilts and launched on its way to the Great Barrier reef quicker than it takes to say Waltzing Matilda. So the introduction is made of air crew to miners who had driven from over 90 miles away over rough track in the dark. An unerring instinct for the only place in Queensland where there was beer to be had. . - The festivities begin and before long the favourite Australian sport of Pommie-baiting is in swing. The landlord, a J.P., reaches under the bar for whatever he uses to help to keep the peace. Peace is restored. The Aussies, who know a heavy-weight when they see one, are staggered to see \"Tiny\" order (and drink) a glass of milk. . Unlaced. \"I dinna believe it.\" says one, the owner, strangely enough, of a broad Scots accent. He looks incredulous. Mr. Heald asked him how long it was since he left Scotland. Skipped from Liverpool before the first World War.\" he replies. Mr. Heald says.â\"Liverpool!âwhy that's my home town!\" _The stranger's eyes light up: \"Then ye’ll ken Goodison.\" Having been at a match at Everton the previous Saturday. Mr. Heald said he knew Goodison Park very well indeed. The stranger then talked on and on of great matches and great days of long ago, names and events which Mr. Heald confessed meant little to him.\n\nAnd his son . . .\n\nThe old Scot-turned-cobber seemed transformed and transported by his recollections. In a final burst of reminiscence and with a pride his listener can still picture he said. â “I played for Everton ma'ser. I scored the goal which won the Cup.\" Mr. Heald looked at the brown, hairy, chest which had once heaved under an Everton jersey and asked: “Who are you” That was a mystery. He would not say. Then with the piano crashing out old songs and new the old man joined the singing and dancing and jigged an eightsome reel! When finally the Australians prepared to go the stranger sought out Mr. Heald and introduced him to his son, a magnificent specimen who towered over his father. At the door there were handshakes all round.\" Remember me to Everton when you get back,\" commanded the stranger. Mr. Heald was puzzled. \"But who shall I say remembers Everton ?\" \"Tell them.\" said a man who seemed sure his name was among those of soccer's immortals.\" tell them ye met Sandy Youngâthe auld ‘uns’ll remember.\" With a valedictory wave of his battered old hat, his step light as a boy's and Mr. Heald swears the echoes of cheers from Goodison, Hampden Park and Crystal Palace, still in his ears he was gone back to the bush from which he had come. Still the indomitable warrior. Mr. Heald would like to think he was the last Evertonian to shake his hand, but he's no Everton fan and he had no knowledge of Sandy's fame. Only my paragraph last Monday, revived an eleven-years-old memory for him and assured him that he, of all the countless thousands of people who follow Everton, had met the man whose goal first brought the Cup here in 1906 and whose successor at Everton, Alexander Young, the second, may begin a Sandy Young saga afresh to-morrow at Birmingham. Meantime, Swansea Town (including our old boys, Alan Sanders. Roy Saunders and Graham Williams) have a date against potential promotionists. Liverpool, at Anfield.\n\nEVERTON HAD Â£110,000 OF SPARE TALENT\n\nMonday, 12, December 1960, The Liverpool Daily post\n\nBIRMINGHAM 2, EVERTON 4\n\nBy Jack Rowe\n\nThink, on this! Everton came through the mud-bath of St. Andrewâs with a fine victory, gained by a team which contained five players who cost no more than the Â£10 signing fee; Wignll, who cost little more, and five whose total value is something over Â£90,000.Â There was no Vernon, no Young, no Lill, and no Ring, and I wonder if there has ever been another which had won an away victory with about Â£110,000 worth of talent sitting on the sidelines.Â I wonder also just how good Everton are going to be when they can utilise all the star men they have, because when a team can do what they did on Saturday it proves beyond all doubt that the basic asset- signing spirit-is there all the time and it is this more than anything else which enables a club to buy big and have little fear that the blend will come.Â When Young and Lill are fit and when Vernon is available they must play, but from Birmingham came the message that deputies like Wignall, Temple and Tyrer can always be depended on to play their hearts out in the cause of the club.Â It was this which impressed me so much because it can be no secret that when Everton faced this match, they would be most thankful for a point.Â Probably most of their followers believed they faced a defeat, but here are two more points-well earned-which came after twice being behind.\n\nNot Lucky\n\nWere Everton lucky to win?Â Birmingham thought so and so did one or two nearer home, but I do not share that view.Â They did not have as much of the play as Birmingham, for whom Jimmy Harris made his League debut, and had to contend with a second half barrage, but when a team fights as Everton fought, when they defended so competently and when they took their chances, such a victory is well merited.Â Bingham and Tyrer did not have a good first half.Â They were bogged down in the mud, but when Everton at the start of the second half were 2-1 down and Brian Harris off having two stitches in a badly gashed knee, there was no wilting and before Harris returned to continue his brilliance Bingham and Tyrer had played vital parts in the goal which Wignall scored, to make it 2-2.Â They fought when the fight was necessary and I reckon Bingham and Tyrer illustrated this terrific will, for no sooner had Harris come back, then Bingham was lashing in the their goal and Tyrer finally completed the scoring.Â I was glad Tyrer, also slightly injured in the first half scored for he was penalised âharshly I thought-when Neal scored Birminghamâs opening goal from a penalty in 14 minutes but again he was back helping in defence when the ball struck his arm.Â The equaliser to this from Wignall was a beauty, for this tall centre forward hurled himself at a waist-high centre from Temple and sent it flashing into the net.Â His second goal in 52 minutes after Stubbs had headed Birmingham ahead four minutes earlier, following a free kick which Dunlop could not reach because he was impeded by one of his own players, was taken coolly and excellently when Bingham nodded down Gabrielâs header from Templeâs corner.Â Everton had their fortune when the referee did not listen to another penalty appeal- justified this time- and when Gabriel hooked away a header off the line from Jimmy Harris, on the first of the only two occasions he evaded the magnificent Labone, but so did Birmingham.Â Wignall missed a chance early on and in the second half might easily have had two more.Â It is almost impossible these days to find new praise for Collins.Â For me he wins the architect of the victory.Â His captaincy was superb, his inspiration and urging so plain to see.Â His work in defence and attack had the genuine stamp and he was the one man, whose ability to make the most accurate pass was not dented by the ankle-deep mud.Â He had a hand in three goals and surely no one can disagree that no matter what Everton have spent in recent weeks, he remains the best bargain in football.Â I make him the best all-round player in the four counties and the satisfaction of those who brought him to Goodison is entitled to be immense.Â Dunlop was also tremendous not only in the two wonder saves he made, but also by his handling and anticipation and how he misses recognition is beyond me.Â Parker, Gabriel, and Thomson âhis speed is still suspect- played efficient roles in the well-drilled defence, while magnificent describes Labone.Â Next to Collins, I put Brian Harris.Â His injury did not stop him and it is fantastic that a player should be so much improved.Â His application, tinkling and distribution were first class and I have not seen a better wing half this season.Â Stubbs was a better inside forward than Bloomfield and Hellawell a useful winger, but the defence was shaky in the second half.Â Birmingham City; Withers; Farmer, Allen; Watts, Smith, Neal; Hellawell, Stubbs; J.

The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nEverton Reserves 5, Preston N.E Res 1\n\nEverton mastered the icy conditions in registering a long overdue win at Goodison Park.Â The enterprising leadership of Webber brought him three goals with the lively Boner getting the other two, but the star of Evertonâs heartening victory was inside-left Harland.Â Green and Gorrie played immaculately in Evertonâs sound defence, which yielded only a penalty goal to Spavin.Â\n\nEVERTON VICTORY WAS STAMPED WITH COLLINS’ GENIUS\n\nLiverpool Echo - Monday 12 December 1960\n\nEverton, I think, shook some of their more rabid followers by the margin of their fine victory over\n\nBirmingham City in the mud of St. Andrews on Saturday. With Vernon out of the side and Young unfit, most of their fans would have been grateful for a point, in preparation for the great championship clash with Spurs next Saturday. Â But Everton these days are not only a fine footballing side when they have their stars playing, but they are a fighting side in any circumstances, and it was this spirit which contributed so much to the 4-2 success over Birmingham. Â City, of course, had Harris signed from Everton, making his Football League debut and this added drama to game. But Harris did not have a good match against his former colleagues, and yet never was the game without drama of another kind. One of the bit merits of Everton's win was that it was achieved on a pitch which down the middle was literally a sea of mud and which was all against the lighter type of forward like Tyrer and Temple. Another great merit was that was they were twice down and came back on each occasion to were level and then went ahead in a sensational three minutes spell in the second half. When Everton went in at half time at level 1-1 it might have been slightly against the run of the play, for Birmingham did more of the attacking, but on the whole I think they deserved to be on terms for Birmingham's goal was from a penaltyâthe kind which is liable to shake a side Young Tyrer, with this fighting Everton spirit, was back in defence when, to my mind, a shot from Neal struck him on the arm. But the referee’s decision was a penalty, and so in 14 minutes Everton were behind when Neal rammed it home it appeared then, especially as the Everton attack was not showing up at all well, although Wignall had missed a good chance earlier, that the Goodison Park side would be struggling.\n\nGRAND PLAYER\n\nOne could understand the feelings of those supporters who thought they would not manage to hold the Midland club. However, a match in which Bobby Collins plays is always open, and this great little man illustrated yet again what a grand player he is and not even the mud could mar the precision of his passing and neither could it cut down the extent of his endeavour and work. Sure enough, it was Collins who in the 25th minute initiated a goal which even the, Birmingham crowd could not let pass without recognition. His pass to Temple was a beauty, so was the centre from the left winger, and there was Wignall plucking himself out of the mud, and flying through the air to make a header which flashed into the net. This was a goal which kept Everton level at the interval, and when Brian Harris did not come out with them after half timeâhe had to have two stitches in a cut kneeâthe task facing Everton was one of the top magnitude, and to make it worse Stubbs put Birmingham ahead in the forty-eighth minute. But Collins was here and there and everywhere and his part as captain must never be underestimated. In the fifty the second minute Wignall finished off a left wing corner, following a great shot by Bingham, and as Brian Harris reappeared so did Bingham lash in a tremendous drive to make it 3-2.Â There was drama in plenty and there were thrills also as Birmingham hit back.\n\nDUNLOP'S SAVES\n\nBut the Everton defence solid in its application and its tackling and when they beaten Dunlop, in spite of a nasty knock to the body, made super saves from Neal and Stubbs. to add to the one he had made earlier from Bloomfield. Birmingham's second half pressure was intense at times but never was there a sign of - fluster or panic in the Everton defence and one must record that even though Thomson started in a manner which suggested that speed is not his strong point, he fought as hard and as successfully as anyone else. Labone gave Jimmy Harris little chance, and one must have praise for each one of the Everton defenders and in particular for Brian Harris, who looked so good and so competent in the first half, and still contrived to play outstandingly well in the face of what must have been a painful injury. It is probably true that Tyrer and Temple cannot compete with men like Vernon and Young, but after the opening twenty minutes or so they improved and played rousing part In the victory. Tyrer got the last goal in 81 minutes, another fine shot, and he too had felt the effect of a first half knock.\n\nBINGHAM IMPROVES\n\nBingham had a much better second half, when the quick pass revealed shakiness in the City defence, and Wignall in my view, in addition to scoring twice, made his mark by his non-stop battling and might\n\neasily have had another couple of goals. But it is Collins who was the forward genius, and no matter whom Everton have bought since, for me he is the best bargain at the price in football.Â Birmingham could not match Everton in the matter of taking chances. Their defence was suspect in the second half and in the forwards Hellawell did quite well, but of the two inside men I preferred Stubbs to Bloomfield. City might have considered themselves unlucky to be 3-2 down in the second half, but Everton's fighting spirit even though they were not at full strength was grand to see.\n\nTRANMERE GAME OFF\n\nLiverpool Echo - Monday 12 December 1960\n\nThe League Cup-tie between Tranmere Rovers and Everton at Prenton Park, due tonight was postponed at 4.p.m by referee Arthur Ellis because of the state of the pitch and thick fog.\n\nYOUNG CHOSEN\n\nLiverpool Echo - Monday 12 December 1960\n\nAlex Young. Everton s Scottish international centre forward, has been chosen to lead the British Army attack against the Belgian Army at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Because of injury Young has not set played for Everton.\n\nALEX YOUNG TO HAVE FITNESS TEST TODAY\n\nTuesday, December 13, 1960. The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nNEW TRANMERE âEVERTON LEAGUE CUP TIE DATE MAY BE DECEMBER 21\n\nBy Jack Rowe\n\nEverton fans, asking the Â£40,000 question, “Will Alex Young play against the Spurs on Saturday?” could get an answer today- or they may have to wait another couple of days.Â Everything depends on a fitness test which the Scottish international, yet to make his debut for Everton, is having at Goodison Park this morning.Â Young, who has been having constant treatment for the knee ligament which has kept him out of the side, has been chosen to lead the British Army attack against the Belgium Army at Stamford Bridge tomorrow and if he is fit for that he will be fit for the Spurs match.Â The fitness test this morning is to determine whether he makes the trip to London, but the prospects at the moment appear to be against him playing at Stamford Bridge.Â Everton manager Mr. John Carey said last night; “I really don’t know whether he will be fit.Â He was not quite fit enough to have played against Tranmere Rovers if the match had gone on last night and we are trying him out today.”Â It is now nearly three weeks since Young was signed from Hearts and it was hoped that he would make his debut at Birmingham last Saturday, but Manager Carey will not put him in if there is the slightest doubt about his illness.Â But even if Young is not fit for the Army game tomorrow night, it does not rule him out for Saturday because two or three days extra treatment can make a world of difference to an injury.Â Of course, if he is fit for the Spurs classic, Everton supporters will await with great interest the announcement of which position he will fill in view of Wignall’s fine performance in the last two fixtures.\n\nNO REAL PROSPECT\n\nThere was never any real prospect that the Tranmere Rovers-Everton League Cup match due at Prenton Park last night, would be played.Â Early morning hopes that the weather would soften up the ground were soon smashed by the fog which bloated out the area and Referee Arthur Ellis, of Halifax postponed the match.\n\nALEX YOUNG DEBUT HOPE\n\nLiverpool Echo - Wednesday 14 December 1960\n\nKNEE SHOWS AN IMPROVEMENT\n\nThe question whether Alex Young will be fit or not to make his debut in the Everton team against Tottenham Hotspur at Goodison Park on Saturday, is still unresolved (writes Leslie Edwards). Young was forced to miss the Army match against the Belgian Army at Stamford Bridge to-day because of the injury sustained three weeks' ago which held up his first appearance with his new club. - Everton Manager. Mr. Carey told me that Young's knee trouble was improving and that the club very much hoped he would be fit for Saturday, but that it was too early to decide one way or the other. It may be significant that Young took part in a seven-a-side game at Bellefield today and came out of it feeling none the worse\n\nTICKETS\n\nAs all the reserved seats at 7s 6d for the Everton v.Burnley match (December 27) are now sold.

The Liverpool Daily Post\n\nBy Horace Yates\n\nEverton are taking no chance about the fitness of their ground for their most attractive Championship engagement of the season on Saturday-against League leaders Tottenham Hotspur and it seems that only fog could provide an obstacle which they cannot overcome, for St. Helens Rugby League Club are willing to come to the aid of Everton by loaning them the braziers, which have been used with such good effect on occasions at Knowsley Road.Â Yesterday football grounds on Merseyside were frozen hard and unless there is a thaw, it could be a real problem- without the braziers.Â Mr. Jack Sharp chairman of Everton ground committee yesterday contacted the St. Helens club to seek their assistance in combating the problem.Â Mr. Sharp remembered that St. Helens had made their ground fit to play a Rugby match at a time when games in the vicinity had to be called off and no doubt concluded that if the braziers could keep sufficient frost out of the ground to permit the playing of Rugby then it could do the game of soccer with even greater certainty.Â He found the Rugby club only too willing to co-operate.Â They promptly offered to make available their 176 braziers, together with the loan of their grounds man, Mr. Ernie Mills, to advise on silting.Â St. Helens have no game this week-end.Â Now that Everton know the braziers are theirs for the asking they can sit back in comparative ease until Friday.Â If icy conditions continue without forecast of a break, then the brazier squad could go into action early in the day and by keeping the braziers burning throughout the night should be able to achieve their objective.Â Everton need have no worry about damage to their ground, for St. Helens, with one of the finest playing areas of any football club for miles around, have found the method entirely satisfactory and harmless.Â There will be those who will bemoan that Everton cannot simply switch on their ground-heating apparatus to do the job without difficulty, but such a good recovery has the ground made this season, following the disasters which followed the installation of the heating system, that it may be conceded that the inconvenience of the brazier system is to be preferred.Â It may be a somewhat primitive way of overcoming the frost but the main thing is that it is effective, and I think Everton are to be applauded for taking this answer into their consideration.Â The old idea of covering pitches with straw has gone out of favour, not principally because of the labour involved in laying and removing, but because of the damage done by weeds, the inevitable aftermath of the covering with straw.Â In these days of modern weed killers, I wonder if that argument still applies.Â I u"
