        "text": "Very fond memories of Todd.\n\nHe played for the NW Bruins when I was a young teen.\n\nI was a big kid (tall) who was really skinny, but went through a big growth spurt (finally filled out) late.\n\nI was too physically weak (despite working out regularly from when I was 14). When I finally stopped gaining height, and filled out I had put on 40+ pounds in 2 years and made it through the NW Bruins rookie camp and invited to their main camp.\n\nI wanted to be the team's next Todd Ewen, as I enjoyed that part of the game.\n\nAs a real young kid I used to dream about being Guy Lafleur. As a teenager, those dreams had changed to being the next Todd Ewen. I loved how the fans in New West loved him so much.\n\nHe was scary tough in the WHL, with just the right amount of 'crazy'. He also became a very good hockey player as an overager.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, he was the team's MVP in his overage season.\n\nThe Oilers already had Semenko; as a Nucks fan, I was so relieved when they traded Ewen to the Blues.\n\nA really underrated tough guy. His TKO of a prime Probert is legendary in fight circles. Even in rematches, he could hold his own against him (IMO Probert had to come out of his jersey to beat Ewen in a couple of their fights).\n\nIt's tragic that both those guys are now gone.\n\nMany blessings to Todd, and his family.\n\nVery fond memories of Todd.\n\nHe played for the NW Bruins when I was a young teen.\n\nI was a big kid (tall) who was really skinny, but went through a big growth spurt (finally filled out) late.\n\nI was too physically weak (despite working out regularly from when I was 14).

So easy to forget where these guys come from sometimes."
