        "text": "Male pattern baldness and other types of hair loss affect everyone — including the rich and famous. Just like the rest of us, dozens of celebrities eventually lose their hair, especially as they get older.\n\nFortunately, going bald isn’t a death knell for a great career. From actors to musicians, athletes to politicians, baldness has become a hallmark of success and individuality.\n\nHere are 37 bald celebrities rocking a buzzcut or bald look in 2024.\n\n6. Jason Alexander\n\nJason Alexander played George Costanza in Seinfeld, who was famously based on Larry David. So it makes sense that he should have similar levels of natural baldness as Larry himself.\n\nMore recently, Jason has worn hairpieces to disguise his baldness (see photo below).\n\n8. Ed Harris\n\nActor Ed Harris of The Truman Show has been balding since a fairly young age. Fortunately, his bald celebrity status hasn’t hindered his acting career.\n\nIn recent years, he’s also starred in the hit show Westworld and the second-highest-grossing film of 2022, Top Gun: Maverick.\n\n“It all happened in the space of a year. I thought everything was over, especially one aspect of my life – ladies. Finished! No one is going to want me. It actually didn’t end up that way, but I felt like I was inhibited by it.”\n\n18. John Travolta\n\nLike lots of actors, John Travolta has switched up his style for various roles over the years. As a result, there have been rumours that he’s had a hair transplant in recent years, though this has never been confirmed. He’s now more often seen sporting a fully bald head. Read more John Travolta’s hair transplant and hair journey over the years.\n\nBald celebrities with beards\n\nLosing your hair is an opportunity to experiment with a new look. These eight celebrities have grown out their facial hair while embracing their baldness.\n\n1. Samuel L. Jackson\n\nSamuel L. Jackson’s bald with a beard look shows how facial hair can add style and sophistication to your appearance.\n\n“I am living a lie, because I am really not bald at all. I shave my head every day. But see, the thing is, if it grows in, people will go, ‘Who is he? What is that?’ And people get really disturbed when I grow it. So I’ve been this way for 30 years.”\n\nYoung bald celebrities\n\nMany men start losing hair in their mid-20s or even earlier. Here are six young men experiencing hair loss.\n\n1. Nicolas Srut Roman\n\nYouTuber Nicolas Srut Roman was diagnosed with alopecia universalis at the age of 7. Now, aged 24, he uses his online presence to raise awareness of this condition."
