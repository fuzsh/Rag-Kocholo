        "text": "Ian McCaw has a vision for Liberty Athletics, and he has worked quickly to make that vision a reality since being named the department’s 11th director of athletics on Nov. 28, 2016.\n\nHis vision for Liberty’s intercollegiate athletics program is to train Champions for Christ by providing a high quality student-athlete experience and achieving victory with integrity.\n\nMcCaw has lived out this mission, guiding Liberty Athletics to unparalleled success on the field, in the classroom and the local community in his short time on Liberty Mountain.\n\nHeading into the 2024-25 athletics season, Liberty’s teams have captured 69 total conference titles since McCaw’s arrival on Liberty Mountain.\n\nUnder McCaw’s leadership, Liberty Athletics is the fastest growing athletics department in the country. Nearly all 20 of its NCAA Division I programs have reached new heights at the national level in the last few years.\n\nFollowing a highly successful five-year run as a member of the ASUN Conference, Liberty Athletics moved into its first-ever FBS athletics conference when it joined Conference USA on July 1, 2023.\n\nLiberty Athletics made quite an impression during its first year of Conference USA membership, winning a league-high 10 conference titles. Football and softball each swept the CUSA regular-season and championship titles, while men’s golf, women’s soccer, men’s indoor track & field, men’s outdoor track & field, women’s indoor track & field and women’s outdoor track & field were all victorious at their respective CUSA Championship events.\n\nWomen’s swimming & diving captured the Atlantic Sun Conference title, while field hockey earned a BIG EAST regular-season crown, bringing the Flames’ yearly total to 12 conference championships.\n\nLiberty captured five titles during its fifth and final year of ASUN Conference membership in 2022-23, including men’s golf, men’s indoor track & field, men’s outdoor track & field, women’s indoor track & field and women’s outdoor track & field. The Flames also won a BIG EAST title (field hockey) and a CCSA championship (women’s swimming & diving).\n\nThe Flames ranked No. 98 in the final 2022-23 Learfield Directors' Cup standings. Liberty has finished inside the top 100 ranking of the top collegiate athletics departments in the country three out of the last four years and five total times in athletics department history.\n\nLiberty’s other top 100 national rankings include No. 70 (2020-21), No. 74 (2021-22), No. 82 (2001-02) and No. 96 (2011-12).\n\nUnder McCaw’s leadership, Liberty’s transition to the FBS ranks has been one of the most successful in NCAA history.\n\nLiberty is one of three teams (also Appalachian State and Marshall) to become bowl eligible in each\n\nof its first five seasons after transitioning from the FCS to FBS. The Flames are 3-2 in bowl games, winning the 2019 Cure Bowl, 2020 Cure Bowl and 2021 LendingTree Bowl titles.\n\nThe Flames’ fifth-straight bowl game appearance marked the most notable athletics event in Liberty Athletics’ 50-plus year history. Following an undefeated regular season in 2023 and a win in the CUSA Football Championship game, Liberty made its first-ever New Years Six bowl game appearance where the No. 23 ranked Flames battled No. 8 Oregon in the 2024 Vrbo Fiesta Bowl.\n\nLiberty’s success on the field during McCaw’s time on Liberty Mountain has allowed the visionary athletics director to reshape conference affiliation for the Flames.\n\nLess than three months into his time at the head of the athletics department, McCaw helped launch Liberty into the top level of intercollegiate competition. On Feb. 16, 2017, Liberty received notification that the NCAA had approved its request to enter into a two-year Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) reclassification process.\n\nMcCaw then helped pave the way for the future of Liberty Athletics on May 17, 2018, when it was announced that 17 of the 20 NCAA Division I programs will end a 27-year run in the Big South Conference to join the ASUN Conference for the 2018-19 athletics season.\n\nLiberty Athletics swept all three All-Sport trophies each year the conference presented the award during the Flames’ five-year run as a conference member: 2018-19, 2021-22 and 2022-23.\n\nThe league did not award any All-Sport trophies during the 2019-20 and 2020-21 athletics seasons due to the cancellation and disruption of the seasons caused by COVID-19.\n\nIn the era of massive conference realignment, McCaw positioned the Flames to make another conference leap when Liberty moving to Conference USA, starting with the 2023-24 athletics season.\n\nConference USA is now the all-sports conference for Liberty Athletics, including the Flames’ football team that has competed as an FBS independent program since moving up to the FBS level in 2018.\n\nLiberty’s recent success has spawned unprecedented growth in the Flames Club and record-setting football and basketball season ticket sales.\n\nFinancial support for Liberty Athletics continues to grow at a record pace as the Flames Club finished the 2023-24 year with a record number of members (5,041), an increase of 1,342 donors since 2018.\n\nLiberty’s success has not just been limited to the field of competition, as Flames student-athletes are also winning in the classroom.\n\nWhile Liberty Athletics was making the next major step onto the national scene on the field of competition, its student-athletes matched the effort in the classroom during the 2023-24 academic year. Liberty Athletics concluded the 2023-24 academic year with a 3.36 cumulative GPA, the highest year-end mark in athletics department history.\n\nAdditionally, Liberty’s 3.36 cumulative GPA was the highest athletics department GPA in Conference USA in 2023-24, earning Liberty Athletics the CUSA Institutional Excellence Award. The award is given to the school with the highest GPA for all student-athletes in conference-sponsored sports.\n\nAll 20 of Liberty’s teams earned a 3.0 or higher GPA during the spring 2024 semester, the first time in school history that every team has achieved this feat. Additionally, all 20 teams achieved a 3.0 or greater GPA for the 2023-24 academic year for the first time ever.\n\nOverall, the cumulative GPA for Liberty’s 590-plus student-athletes has risen 13 out of the last 15 semesters.\n\nLiberty’s graduation success rate (GSR) climbed to an all-time high of 96 percent and has seen an increase or matched its previous year’s total each of the last 11 years and 12 out of the last 13 years. A total of 133 Liberty Flames student-athletes were honored as a part of the 2024 Liberty University graduating class.\n\nOutside the classroom, our NCAA student-athletes remain dedicated to serving the Lynchburg community while growing as individuals. During the 2023-24 academic year, Liberty’s student-athletes participated in over 40 different community service and outreach projects and more than 75 different personal development workshops, seminars and programs.\n\nThe Lord continues to move among our student-athletes with 13 finding newfound faith in Jesus Christ this year, while many others took their profession of faith public with a baptism. During the 2023-24 academic year, a total of 39 student-athletes were baptized, including some by their fellow teammates or coaches.\n\nRoad to Liberty Mountain\n\nMcCaw is well equipped to lead Liberty at the highest level of college athletics, having nearly two decades of previous service as director of athletics at Baylor (2003-16), Massachusetts (2002-03), and Northeastern (1997-2002).\n\nDuring his time at Baylor, the Bears experienced tremendous success on the field, in the classroom, and in fundraising and facility development. McCaw helped Baylor capture five team national championships (acrobatics & tumbling, 2015; equestrian, 2012; men’s tennis, 2004; and women’s basketball, 2005 and 2012), had 17 student-athletes win individual national championships (track & field and men’s and women’s tennis), and captured 58 Big 12 Conference titles.\n\nBaylor’s football team reached bowl games for six consecutive years (2010-15) and won the Big 12 Championship in 2013 and 2014. The Bears’ Robert Griffin III became the nation’s top collegiate football player in 2011 when he was named the school’s first ever Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nDuring his final five seasons at Baylor, the Bears’ football and men’s and women’s basketball programs posted a combined 350-84 record, the best mark in the country during that span.\n\nUnder McCaw’s watch, student-athletes thrived in the classroom as Baylor finished first or second in the Big 12 in graduation success rate in seven of his last nine years. The school recorded its highest ever cumulative GPA in 2015-16 (3.34).\n\nWhile Baylor enjoyed extraordinary academic and athletic success under McCaw’s leadership, his department also made significant administrative strides.\n\nAbove and Beyond, a five-year strategic plan for intercollegiate athletics, was developed and implemented to achieve the department’s goals and objectives. An outgrowth of this plan was the creation and successful completion of the Victory with Integrity and From Here We Build development campaigns. During his 13 years as Baylor’s director of athletics, the department raised more than $390 million for capital projects and student-athlete scholarships.\n\nWhile at Baylor, McCaw created a robust sports ministry program that included student-athlete and team mission trips and service programs, and he strengthened the school’s relationship with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\nPrior to his days at Baylor, McCaw served as the director of athletics at the University of Massachusetts during the 2002-03 academic year. At UMass, he was responsible for a 23-sport program, helping develop and implement a five-year strategic plan and secure funding for basketball locker room renovations.\n\nPrior to his time at UMass, McCaw served as director of intercollegiate athletics and campus recreation at Northeastern from 1997-2002. During the last of his five years with the Huskies, Northeastern captured a school-record six America East Conference championships and had five teams finish among the nation’s top 20.\n\nMcCaw went to Northeastern from Tulane, where he served as senior associate athletic director for development and associate athletic director for external affairs from 1992-97. He was also Tulane’s co-interim director of athletics in 1996.\n\nPrior to his years at Tulane, McCaw worked in a variety of athletic administrative posts at the University of Maine from 1986-92, including sports information, marketing, and external affairs.\n\nRecognized as a national leader in intercollegiate athletics, McCaw has served as chair of the NCAA Recruiting and Personnel Issues Cabinet. He was also a member of the Big 12 Television & Game Management and Officiating Committees. Additionally, he served on the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Executive Committee and was on the Division I-A Athletics Director Association Board of Trustees.\n\nMcCaw was named 2014-15 FBS NACDA Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year and was a finalist for the 2012 and 2015 Sports Business Journal Athletics Director of the Year awards. He was named the 2012 NACDA West Region Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year and the 2010 Waco Tribune-Herald Central Texas Sportsman of the Year. He also received the 2013 VanderZwaag Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Massachusetts Sport Management Program.\n\nMcCaw earned his master’s degree in sport management from Massachusetts in 1987, after receiving a bachelor’s degree in sports administration at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, in 1985. McCaw and his wife, Heather, have four children: Christy, Paul, Callie, and Corinne."
