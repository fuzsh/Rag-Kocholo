Honestly I am very much just writing down whatever I happen to find interesting because it makes me feel better to have somewhere to put all that, and it makes me really happy every time I hear about other people enjoying it. It's quite cool that that can happen separate from the source material as well, I think that makes sense in a way because the best things about media are things that can be related to real life so they can be recognized by anyone."
