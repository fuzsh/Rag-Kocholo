        "text": "Award-winning comedian Rob Brydon and his eight-piece band, including Paul Herbert (Musical Director, Arranger and Pianist), are back in the UK & Ireland next year with their widely praised tour, Rob Brydon – A Night of Songs & Laughter.\n\nThe production took UK critics and audiences by storm in 2022 before playing to sold-out venues across Australia and New Zealand in 2023 and is now set to return from Sunday 18 February 2024 at Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, playing through a variety of venues until its final date at Dublin’s Bord Gáis Energy Theatre on Tuesday 26 March 2024.\n\nA Night of Songs & Laughter features Rob’s brilliant stand-up comedy plus songs ranging from Tom Waits to Tom Jones, and Guys and Dolls to Elvis (and almost everything in between), telling Rob’s personal musical journey from South Wales to the West End and beyond. Audiences can expect Rob’s usual warmth and humour, along with his famed gallery of voices, as he regales them with hilarious tales from his distant and recent past.\n\nRob Brydon said, “It turns out that touring with a band is the most fun you can have, I can’t wait to get back out to some new towns and cities and to revisiting some of the old ones we loved playing on the first leg.”\n\nRob Brydon’s varied career began with the TV comedy shows Marion and Geoff and Human Remains in 2000, for which he won British Comedy Awards. Since then, his comedy credits have included A Small Summer Party, The Keith Barret Show, Directors Commentary, Supernova, Cruise Of The Gods, Black Books, I’m Alan Partridge, Little Britain, Live At The Apollo, Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive, QI, The Big Fat Quiz Of The Year, Have I Got News For You, Gavin and Stacey, Rob Brydon’s Identity Crisis, Would I Lie To You? and The Trip.\n\nHe has also appeared in the dramas Oliver Twist, Heroes and Villains: Napoleon, The Way We Live Now, Murder In Mind, Kenneth Tynan: In Praise of Hardcore, Marple and the films 24 Hour Party People, MirrorMask, A Cock and Bull Story, Swimming with Men, Cinderella, The Huntsman: Winter’s War, Blinded By The Light, Holmes and Watson and Barbie.\n\nIn 2009, alongside Ruth Jones, Robin Gibb and Sir Tom Jones, Rob reached number one in the UK charts with the single Islands in The Stream, in aid of Comic Relief. He also embarked on an 87-date tour of the UK with his stand-up show, Rob Brydon Live which included a three-week run in London’s West End. Rob subsequently enjoyed a sold-out tour, Town to Town, with Lee Mack and David Mitchell, before completing another sold-out solo tour in 2020.\n\nMore recently, Rob performed in the one-off concert, Old Friends, at The Sondheim Theatre in May 2022 which celebrated the life of the legendary composer Stephen Sondheim and raised funds for the Stephen Sondheim Foundation, which generates new musical theatre talent for the future.\n\nLISTINGS\n\nRob Brydon – A Night of Songs & Laughter\n\nProduced and presented by Fiery Angel Entertainment\n\nTOUR DATES 2024\n\nSunday 18 February Edinburgh, Festival Theatre\n\nMonday 19 February Aberdeen, Music Hall\n\nTuesday 20 February Perth, Concert Hall\n\nFriday 23 February Tunbridge Wells, Assembly Hall\n\nSunday 25 February Plymouth, Theatre Royal\n\nMonday 26 February Bath, Forum\n\nTuesday 27 February Llandudno, Venue Cymru\n\nFri 1 and Sat 2 March Kingston, Rose Theatre\n\nSunday 3 March Chichester, Festival Theatre\n\nTuesday 5 March Norwich, Theatre Royal\n\nThursday 7 March Gateshead, The Glasshouse\n\nSunday 10 March Southampton, Mayflower\n\nMonday 11 March Cardiff, Wales Millennium Centre\n\nWednesday 13 March Wolverhampton, Grand\n\nFriday 15 March Oxford, New Theatre\n\nSunday 17 March Swansea, Arena\n\nMonday 18 March Manchester, Bridgewater Hall\n\nWednesday 20 March Canterbury, Marlow\n\nSunday 24 March Leicester, Curve\n\nTuesday 26 March Dublin, Bord Gáis Energy Theatre\n\nRelated News & Reviews Past & Present"
