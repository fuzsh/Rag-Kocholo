        "text": "Milo McCabe is a TV presenter, actor and stand-up comedian. These days Milo is more specifically known for hanging around shop doorways as his alter ego Troy Hawke; the character from his stand-up routine has garnered critical acclaim from festivals and tours around the world.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Troy Hawke, a quick YouTube search will sort you out with a ‘This Morning’ clip topping the bill. Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were fulsome in their appreciation for the Hawke character who has set up the Greeters Guild to welcome shoppers to their favourite stores and other high street locations (follow him yourself here on his Facebook page).\n\nImagine, if you will, you are about to pop into your local supermarket, gym or pub, and a man with slick hair, a neat moustache and a clipped accent, dressed in a silky smoking jacket, cravat and spectator shoes gives you an enthusiastic welcome. The reserved Brits do not know what to make of it, while others really appreciate the effort (even if they are not sure if it is meant to be humorous), and store managers and security guards are often less than welcoming. It’s comfortingly cringey.\n\nMilo’s website describes Troy as “The Errol Flynn of the high street. Educated, sophisticated, but utterly clueless.” His style sets him out from the crowd. The 1930s outfit caught our eye…with the spectators being the standout feature for us (naturally).\n\nOriginally shoes worn by sporting gentlemen for golf and cricket, the spectators started wearing them too. They are also known as co-respondents, after the wrongdoer named in a divorce suit. See King Edward VII and Wallace Simpson for one of the most notorious divorces and enthusiastic wearers of two-tone shoes!\n\nSpectator shoes are thoroughly British and a bit decadent. Troy is the perfect fit for his Herring Henley.\n\nWhen asked about how the Troy Hawke look came about, Milo’s answer was honest and simple: “The whole Troy aesthetic is something of an accident of circumstance. I had the 1930s look with high waisted and braced trouser, cravat and smoking jacket just winking at me from a shop window.”\n\nIt just goes to show that often the best ideas come about by accident!\n\nAnd when Milo isn’t being Troy, he makes no bones about his general attire: “Mid-life crisis dad gear,” he says while laughing.\n\nAnd who can blame him, being dapperly dressed to the hilt either on stage or out in the field with the Greeters Guild seven days a week, will make anyone long for their comfy clothes.\n\nAway from Troy, Milo has appeared on ITV’s Benidorm, BBC3’s Live at the Electric and Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive. He has presented ITV’s Dare and The Mint. He was also a drummer for Tim Booth and the Individuals, playing Glastonbury, T in the Park and V Festival.\n\nTroy Hawke though is the man of the moment with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, European dates and a sell-out UK tour, ‘Sigmund Troy’d’, dominating the latter half of 2022. Who knew a 1930s throwback could do so well?"
