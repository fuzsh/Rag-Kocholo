        "text": "Pity he doesn't do The Keith Barrat show again.\n\nI saw him as Keith Barrat when he came to Rhyl (where I live). I qued up to get his autograph and when I came to him, I asked him to sign my program (To my little smasher David) and then ... my chest. I unbuttoned my shirt and with a mock-shaky hand he signed it and turned to the others in the line and said, \"You heard him, he did ask!\" I thanked him and said I knew all about the restraining order but I just had to come!\n\nI've only seen the first episode from the second series and it was pretty good. Sharon Horgan grated on me in the first series – I really hate those 'guy fancies girl, girl thinks he's a twat' scenarios. Why not make the guy a complete twat and have the girl really fancy him? That's truer to life\n\nThe problem for me is that it's just Partridge under another name. Replace Brydon with Partridge and you wouldn't have to change a line. Which is spooky.\n\nWhy can't we just have more Partridge?\n\nQuote: Godot Taxis @ May 26, 2007, 6:19 AM\n\nI've only seen the first episode from the second series and it was pretty good. Sharon Horgan grated on me in the first series â€“ I really hate those 'guy fancies girl, girl thinks he's a twat' scenarios. Why not make the guy a complete twat and have the girl really fancy him? That's truer to life\n\nIt's amazing isn't it... just how many 'scenes' are played out over and over again? Seemingly 'gainst real life?\n\nI guess it's just how an audience prefers it. Although that's another debate entirely...\n\nI don't hate Annually Retentive, i just can't seem to care about it. Sometimes it feels like you're watching Memento the right way round! It has no structure and that's what let's it down. I like Brydon but i think he's a better performer than writer. If you look at his best stuff it's been when he's been writing with someone else, (Marion and Geoff, Hugo Blick. Human Remains, Julia Davis) but as an actor i simply can't fault him.\n\nQuote: zooo @ June 2, 2007, 12:51 PM\n\nDid anyone watch the most recent one? (Climbing wall episode)\n\nIt was fantastic!\n\nSort of came together a bit.\n\nYeah... I loved it. I like the fact that there is now some development of the relationship between his character and the show's producer. It's a shame that perhaps it's been too subtle (or slow) for a 6-part series."
