Since leaving the RSC, he has worked mostly as a voice actor, notably on several high profile science-fiction projects.\n\nToby can be heard on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and on Judge Dredd: Solo - in which he provided the voices for all 34 roles. This was pulled off with some effects and multi-track recording, but mainly by his own ability to impersonate multiple characters.\n\nToby has appeared in Nighty Night, Rob Brydonâ€™s Annually Retentive and Extras. He also provided voices for Lott Dod and Gragra in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."
