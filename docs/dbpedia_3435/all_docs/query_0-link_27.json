Her first performance was at a club in Chester, because that was far enough from home that if it went badly no one would know her.\n\nAs an actress, she has made brief appearances in Life's a Pitch and Absolute Power. Her first high profile acting role was alongside Christian Slater in the stage version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2004. She reprised her role of a nurse for the 2005 London production.\n\nIn 2005, she made regular appearances on Broken News as Claudia Van Sant.\n\nShe has been one of the writers for all nine series of Parsons and Naylor's Pull-Out Sections, appearing as a special guest performer in many editions. Porter also starred in The Powder Room alongside Julia Morris and Gina Yashere, which was also broadcast on BBC Radio 2.\n\nShe is also the script writer for two series of BBC Three's Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife.\n\nIn July 2006 she appeared in the first episode of Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive panel show-based comedy. She was a panelist on show 7 of satirical news quiz show Have I Got News For You's 32nd series, and has appeared on other popular UK panel shows, such as Never Mind The Buzzcocks and Mock the Week.\n\nIn May 2007, Porter became host of a The Guardian podcast, Many Questions and more recently 'The Heckle'. In June 2007, Porter came second in a celebrity edition of The Weakest Link. Porter appeared in 2007 on ITV2's Comedy Cuts, a programme showcasing the best of the British stand-up comedy circuit.\n\nIn 2008, Porter began work as a team captain on the BBC Radio 4 panel game Act Your Age.\n\nLucy Porter has recorded her stand-up show The Good Life for a DVD release by independent label Go Faster Stripe, and appeared in the 2008 and 2009 series of Mock The Week .

In the original Lucy claimed she was unlikely to ever marry because of an “allergy to gold”, and therefore would never be able to put on a wedding ring; on tour, she makes self-deprecating reference to the original material, given that she is now married.\n\nIn February 2010 it was revealed that Lucy is set to present FirstPlay, a weekly digital \"magazine\" for European customers on the Playstation 3.\n\nLive shows[]\n\n2002\n\nThe Stonewall Gala\n\n2003\n\nLive At The Underbelly\n\n2004\n\nLady Luck\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\n\n2005\n\nHappiness\n\nStand Up For Freedom\n\n2006\n\nThe Good Life\n\nStand Up For Freedom\n\n2007\n\nLucy Porter's Love In\n\n2008\n\nLucy And Des Show Off\n\nEdinburgh Festival Fringe: The Bare Necessities\n\n2009\n\n(6–31 August) Edinburgh Festival Fringe: Fool's Gold\n\n(12 November) LIVEstock 2009, Friends of the Earth's comedy and music event\n\nUK tours\n\n2009 The Bare Necessities:\n\n2010 Fool's Gold\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nLucy married her boyfriend, comic actor Justin Edwards, in December 2009.
