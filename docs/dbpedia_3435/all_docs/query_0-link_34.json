        "text": "Paul Foot is a famous British comedian with a unique style that makes him stand out from the rest. Described by The Daily Express as ‘a rare exotic bird’ and by The Independent as ‘a comedy genius’, he is a comic unlike any other. Available through the Champions Music and Entertainment agency, Paul is the ideal host, compere, comedian, and actor for any event, broadcast, or appearance.\n\nFoot is an eccentric comic known for his rants, ‘disturbances’, musings, and occasional anti-joke style. Such is his style that Foot’s ‘Still Life’ show at the Bloomsbury Theatre had the comic sit with the audience for the first 30 minutes of the performance, followed by a nonsense language dictated by a horse, readings of hand decorated cards, and other bizarre art forms. His comedy is rough around the edges and appears off the cuff, but each and every performance is formed like a well-thought-out collage of comedy.\n\nFoot was born and raised in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, before studying mathematics at Oxford. He graduated in 1995, and after a short stint at a computer software company, he found his passion performing comedy at open mic nights.\n\nSince then Foot has become a regular at the Edinburgh Fringe. Performing By the Yard in 2009, Ash in the Attic in 2010, and Words in 2013 he wowed audiences and established himself as a star performer. Foot is a frequently touring comedian with shows from 2003 to the present.\n\nAsh in the Attic was a particular highlight. Directed by Noel Fielding and performed by Foot, the show enjoyed two sell-out tours at the Soho Theatre in London. The show went international as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival programme. It received rave reviews and Foot has often toured Australia as a result.\n\nFoot has gone on to appear as a guest on several television series and panel shows including FAQ U, Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive, Come Dine With Me, Richard and Judy, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Russell Howard’s Good News Extra, Would I Lie To You, and 8 Out Of 10 Cats. In 2008, the successful comic even reached the final of NBC’s Last Comic Standing."
