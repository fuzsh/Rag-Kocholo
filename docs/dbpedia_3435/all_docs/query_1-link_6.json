        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIs it a comedy or is it a panel game? It's a bit of both but mostly the former, if you ask us, but it isn't listed in the BBC Online Comedy Guide as a comedy so who knows?\n\nWe're listing this for historical value only, if we're honest. Rob Brydon - playing a nastier, more callous version of himself - hosts a comedy panel game for real in front of a real audience who think it's real. However, the programme actually appears in clip format as a show-with-a-show (it's as if The Mousetrap hadn't happened) with heavily-scripted behind the scenes preparations packaged around it. Therefore, essentially this is a sitcom based around a game show, not vice versa.\n\nSomehow Rob Brydon's far too likeable and endearing to be believable as a shallow celebrity host, unlike Gary Shandling's Larry Sanders, and the concept falls down rather on that point. However, there are some good gags if you stick with it.\n\nWeb links\n\nBBC programme page\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nBritish Comedy Guide entry\n\nSee also\n\nWeaver's Week review\n\nFeedback"
