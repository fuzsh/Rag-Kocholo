Our comedy doors open at 8pm - for customers who wish to dine in the main venue restaurant before the comedy begins, there is strictly limited seating available up to 7.30pm, reservation essential!\n\nHal Cruttenden\n\nAs seen on The Royal Variety Performance\n\nNominee, Perrier Best Newcomer 2002\n\n“Hal Cruttenden is one of the one of the top comedians working in the UK today, as well as being an accomplished writer and actor. Already this year he has appeared on 'Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive' for BBC3 and has just finished writing and performing in 'The Omid Djalili Show' due to be aired on BBC1 towards the end of the year.” Comedy CV website\n\n“a polished, slick act with a bounty of reliable punchlines likely to entertain almost any club audience” Chortle website\n\n“A delightful surprise? warm-hearted, quick-witted observations about being a camp, middle class heterosexual.” The Daily Telegraph\n\n“done with high camp and nattily constructed punchlines, it definitely holds charm.” The Guardian\n\nTom Stade\n\nAs seen on Michael McIntyre’s Comedy Roadshow, Mock the Week and Frankie Boyle’s Tramadol Nights\n\n“An insider’s tip for comedy greatness” Metro\n\n“Sublime…wonderfully imaginative, original and hilarious” Rhod Gilbert\n\n“So cool he could well be the answer to global warming...gloriously funny silly and smart. He has a gift of making his audience feel like friends...clever and funny” Scotsman\n\n“One of the best practitioners of stand-up we’ve got, with a shedful of classy routines...stand-up elite” Chortle\n\n\"No other standup oozes 'star' like Stade\" Toronto Star\n\n\"Not only is his act filled with intelligent and highly perceptive observations, but when watching Tom you feel like he is your buddy who just wandered onto the stage to have a good time. There is no artifice, no pretense ... and he's hysterical\" Freewheelin'\n\n\"The insolent Vancouver party animal... pushing the limits of taste just far enough to not come out as outright dangerous. He will go far.\" Now Magazine's \"Best of Comedy\"\n\nJoseph Wilson\n\nFinalist, Chortle Student Comedy Awards 2008\n\nFinalist, Paramount Funniest Student 2009\n\n“Delivers [his material] with conviction and energy… and shows a flair for impersonation, from Kermit The Frog to a splendid Jimmy Carr. Undeniable performance skills” Chortle website\n\n\"Cheeky showman with wide appeal who is showing potential to carve himself a reputation on the circuit\" The Glee\n\n“An infectious onstage energy mixing physical comedy with excellent vocal trickery\" Western Daily Press\n\nAndy Davies\n\n\"Loud, brash, cheeky and charming, with an anecdotal style and a love of audience banter. Andy also comperes regularly at the Mixt Nutz nights and Stand Up and Coming.\" Comedy CV Website\n\nMC - Robin Banks\n\n“Though primarily known as the compere at the Comedy Pit venues he runs in South London, Banks also performs his own act in the guise of a rough diamond ex-con. However, he shuns the expected tough-guy shtick in favour of some airy-fairy surrealism… The discrepancy between image and material produces its fair share of laughs” Chortle website\n\nPlease check this page regularly for updated line-ups.
