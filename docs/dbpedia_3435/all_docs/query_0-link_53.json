        "text": "ROB Brydon's new panel show is a post-modern hybrid of Have I Got News For You, Never Mind The Buzzcocks and The Larry Sanders Show.\n\nWhile we see celebrities answering questions about a certain year in history and acting out news stories, we also see all the behind-the scenes production meetings, in which Brydon bemoans having to present just another stupid panel show that's just stolen all the good bits from other stupid panel shows.\n\n\"I preferred being unknown for doing good stuff,\" he grumbles. And he's not impressed by the choice of Z-list guests either.\n\n\"Outside of her immediate family, is there anybody who's going to go 'ooh, look who it is'?\" he complains about one celebrity - and he does have a point.\n\nVery funny, in an in-jokey kind of way."
