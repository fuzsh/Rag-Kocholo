        "text": "First today, the next episode of Torchwood – Ghost Machine. It opens with a chase through the city centre. Gwen almost gets the man they’re chasing, but is left with his jacket. Tosh (monitoring from the Hub) tells her whatever they were chasing is in the jacket. Gwen finds an alien artefact, and when she presses a button (surely the team have guidelines on handling possible alien technology?) she has a vision and sees a little boy on his own with a luggage label on his coat.\n\nShe snaps out of it, and later describes what she saw. They trace the name on the label to a man still living in the city. He tells her the story of when he was evacuated to Cardiff during the war, and how he’s lived there ever since, because his parents in London died in the Blitz.\n\nThey want to track down the man who originally had the artefact. “This kid, Bernie, where does he live?” “Splott.” “Splott?” Ianto says “I believe estate agents pronounce it “Sploe”.” I’ve always loved this joke, as it’s probably true.\n\nThey can’t find him, and everyone who knows him seems to hate him. They’re about to give up, when Owen has a vision with the device. He sees a young woman crying under a bridge, then a young man finds her, obviously the cause of the tears, and he pulls a knife on her and takes her somewhere Owen doesn’t see, but he knows it’s nothing good, because the device makes you feel emotions as well as seeing things.\n\nGwen gets some shooting lessons from Jack. It feels like Jack is seducing her, which wouldn’t be out of character. But she seems pretty good with the guns.\n\nOwen becomes obsessed with what he saw, and tracks down the man, Ed Morgan. (It’s useful that people say names out loud in their visions.) He’s old now, and Owen tells him he knows exactly what he did. Eventually, Morgan snaps and angrily ejects him from his house. “You’ll get nothing from me! I told you before, you’ll get nothing!” Morgan is played by Gareth Thomas, who fellow SF fans will know played Blake in Blake’s 7. Ironic that in that show, Blake was arrested on false charges of child abuse, but now he’s playing an actual rapist and murderer. Probably coincidental.\n\nOutside the house, Owen sees a familiar face. It’s Bernie, the man who originally had the alien device. So we get the second high-velocity foot chase. I’m wondering if they were inspired by anything. My guess is Shaun of the Dead especially when the chase takes them over garden fences and walls.\n\nThey talk to him in the pub, and he tells them the device was part of some junk left in a lock-up that he and a friend used. He also reveals that although his name is Sean, people call him Bernie because “I burned my neighbour’s shed down when I was 12.” He also tells her that one of the things he saw was a woman putting her dead baby in the river. “So I goes up to see her. Told her what I’d seen. She give me money not to tell anyone.”\n\nBack at his flat, they pick up the other bits of alien junk that he’d found, along with the other half of the device which, when reassembled, makes it look like a game controller. Bernie tells them what he saw when both parts were attached. “I’m going to die. I’ve seen it happen, out there on the road. I’m just lying there, bleeding, and then I die. Just like I am now, not old.”\n\nOutside the house, as they’re preparing to go, Gwen activates the device again, and sees herself, hands covered in blood. “I was too late, I couldn’t stop it.” “Stop what?” “He’s dead. Owen had the knife. He wanted to kill him.” “Owen?” “Oh God, I couldn’t stop it!”\n\nThings reach a climax when Ed Morgan decides to visit Bernie, confronting him, knife in hand. Gwen is already there, she’d been asking him if he’d contacted Ed.\n\nThe team subdue Ed (not hard, given his age) but Owen has a lot of anger about what he saw, and threatens Ed with the knife.\n\nBut Gwen takes the knife from him. She thinks she’s stopped it all from happening, but as she’s holding the knife – pointing up in a way your parents would tell you never to hold a knife – Ed lurches towards her. The staging here doesn’t make it clear if he hasn’t noticed the knife, or if he’s reflexively attacking the nearest woman, but whatever the reason, he impales himself on the knife she’s holding, making her vision come true. (I’m not quite sure why there’s a kitchen sink behind Gwen in this shot, except that the road here was strewn with rubbish in an earlier scene, but I can’t help wondering if this was a deliberate joke.)\n\nThe usual Media Centre Description is missing, as is the episode title. I’m unsure if this was a consequence of this recording being edited, or if it was just missing on the original broadcast. The broadcast time is intact and correct.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Sunday 29 October 2006 22:00\n\nThe next recording is from later in the evening, and opens with the end of the episode we’ve just seen (although a later repeat).\n\nThere’s a BBC Three new season trail, then there’s the first episode we’ve seen of the companion programme Torchwood: Declassified – Living History. This one focuses on Owen’s character, and opens with a montage of cast and crew talking about him. I’d have to disagree with Naoko Mori, though, who says “You can’t help but like him”.\n\nRussell T Davies calls him a “Geezer” and says it’s the kind of character that “sparks the banter”. Owen never struck me as a “cheeky chappie”, I always thought of him as a grim misogynist.\n\nBurn Gorman describes him as a chancer, which isn’t wrong.\n\nJulie Gardner: ” I think you start to see that he can care, that he can emotionally engage in some of the stories”.\n\nJohn Barrowman: “I think you learn that Owen is not as big a tough guy as he really sees himself.”\n\nColin Teague: “He very much goes against Jack and the unit.”\n\nNaoko Mori: “That’s when you kind of go ‘Oh I see this is what Owen’s about.'”\n\nWriter Helen Raynor talks about the Cardiff setting. “the Cardiff setting for me is an absolute gift because I live here, I can walk around town and think wow, that’s a brilliant bridge or that’s actually fantastic landmark or wouldn’t it be amazing to have a scene up there?”\n\nThey talk about the chase through the gardens. Producer Richard Stokes thought it would be impossible to shoot. “I couldn’t believe that we would get six or seven houses in a row all to agree to shoot that sequence.”\n\nFor a fast shot of them running across a bridge, they used a Rickshaw with a cameraman sitting on the back being pulled at speed across the bridge.\n\nThe “coming up” section seems unduly spoileriffic, so I won’t mention that here.\n\nHere’s someone else’s upload of the episode. These are all a lot shorter than typical Doctor Who Confidential.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Going behind the scenes of Torchwood. Director Colin Teague tells how he made one of this episode’s many action sequences, while executive producers Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner talk about how episode three shows the character of bad boy Owen in a new light.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Monday 30 October 2006 01:10\n\nFollowing this there’s trails for Dog Borstal, Celebrity Scissorhands. Then the recording ends after a few minutes of The Real Hustle.\n\nToday’s first recording starts with the end of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nThere’s a trail for Robin Hood, another strange Electric Proms ad, and Eastenders trail, and another trail for The State Within.\n\nThen, it’s back to Sherwood Forest for another episode of Robin Hood – Parent Hood.\n\nRobin and the men steal some horses from Guy of Gisborne, and when they’ve escaped and are congratulating themselves, they hear a crying sound, and find a baby. To make matters worse, Gisborne had marked the shoes of the horses they stole, and tracked them, so Robin has to fight while holding the baby.\n\nThe Sheriff brings good news. There has been no new outbreak of the pestilence in the village of Clun for two weeks. Marian asks if the quarantine will be lifted, but the Sheriff refuses. “Simpler to keep the quarantine in place and then after one or two weeks, we say that the village has been… cleansed. I may house my garrison there.” I think Matt Hancock modelled his career as Health Secretary after the Sheriff. He even insults Marian. “Interesting, mmm? This fire in your belly. Is this reason talking? Or is it frustration? Frustration at being… how old now and still a maiden?”\n\nRoy, one of Robin’s men, has been captured. The woman who brings him water tells him that she’s the mother of Gisborne’s child, and that he’s taken the baby to the Abbey of Kirklees. Roy realises that the baby they found is probably hers. And therefore Gisborne’s, which he left to die.\n\nThe Sheriff finds Roy’s mother in Nottingham, and offers him a choice – kill Robin Hood, or his mother will die.\n\nMarian brings food for the quarantined village. The guards won’t let her in.\n\nRoy tells Robin that he knows who the mother of the baby is, and wants to take him to her village. On the way they come across Marian, and get rid of the guards. Then they deliver the food by arrow.\n\nRobin gets an arrow to the knee arm, and Marian does some field surgery.\n\nThe Sheriff hears about Marian’s food delivery, and has to punish her. It’s nicely set up, looking like a hanging, but the punishment is to have her long hair cut off.\n\nRoy finally can’t put it off any longer, and tries to kill Robin. He fails, obviously, and has to tell them that the Sheriff has his mother. He also tells them that the baby is Gisborne’s and the mother works in the castle kitchens.\n\nThey break into the cells, looking for Roy’s mother, but she’s not there, and they’re captured by the Sheriff, forced to see Roy’s mother hanged.\n\nBut the other mother interrupts proceedings, angry with Gisborne after learning what he did with the baby.\n\nThey’re escaping, when the Sheriff grabs Roy. Robin can’t let him die, and is about to give himself up again, but Roy breaks free of the Sheriff, shouts at Robin to go, and lets the Sheriff’s men kill him. “My name is Royston White and I fight for Robin Hood and King Richard…” I’ll admit, this had me tearing up.\n\nThe baby and his mother are given safe passage to somewhere they will be looked after, far away from Nottingham.\n\nMarian’s sporting her shorter hair.\n\nAnd the baby even gets a gift.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Drama series which gives a contemporary feel to the classic Robin Hood legend. Robin and his men discover an abandoned baby in Sherwood Forest moments before the Sheriff kidnaps Roy. Roy is given a dilemma – kill Robin Hood or watch his mother hang at sunrise.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC ONE Saturday 28 October 2006 19:10\n\nAfter this, there’s a trail for a one-off special of The Royle Family.\n\nAnd a trail for tomorrow’s showing of Torchwood on BBC Three.\n\nThen the recording stops after a few minutes of National Lottery 1 vs 100. The first question I thought was fairly easy.\n\nI’d definitely come a cropper at the second question, as geography is one of my weak spots. All we did at School was oxbow lakes and scarp slopes.\n\nThe second recording today is a repeat of yesterday’s episode of QI.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Stephen Fry hosts the quiz show in which contestants are rewarded more if their answers are ‘quite interesting’. This edition features Alan Davies, Sean Lock, Andy Parsons and Clive Anderson tackling the subject of Death.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC TWO Saturday 28 October 2006 20:00\n\nAfter this, there’s a trail for The Catherine Tate Show. I’m fairly sure the start was shot in one of the BBC buildings in White City.\n\nThere’s also a trail for Children in Need (the buff Terry Wogan one).\n\nThen the recording stops after a bit of Top of the Pops 2. Haysee Fantaysee. There’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time. A long time.\n\nToday’s first programme is a partial recording of Charlie and Lola – What If I Get Lost in the Middle of Nowhere. It’s missing the beginning.\n\nLola has lost her toy fox, and can’t find it.\n\nThis leads to her getting very stressed out about a forthcoming school trip, and worrying that she might get lost. Charlie and Marv try to reassure her and Lotta that there are things they can do not to get lost. Like wearing bright clothes.\n\nThey can carry whistles so people can hear where they are.\n\nOr do what Hansel and Gretel did, and drop pebbles along the way.\n\nTheir school trip turns out to be a garden maze. This made me laugh a lot.\n\nLola and Lotta remember to drop their pebbles, but they soon run out.\n\nBut after some wrong turns, they all make it to the centre.\n\nCharlie and Marv want to race to see who can get out first. Lotta and Lola find their pebbles.\n\nBy the time Charlie and Marv find their way out, Lola and Lotta have already got their ice creams and are waiting for them.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Children’s animation. Join Lola and Charlie, a brother and sister, as they deal with topics that affect their everyday lives. A surprise school trip is planned. As Charlie, Marv and Lotta speculate about where it might be to, Lola starts to worry that she might get lost. Bright clothes, whistles and pebbles all come into play in an attempt to avoid getting lost. Finally, however, the school trip takes them to a place where you are meant to get lost – a maze!\n\nBBC Genome: BBC TWO Wednesday 25 October 2006 07:00\n\nNext today, two copies of the same recording, but one of them is edited, so let’s look at the unedited one.\n\nIt opens with the end of a documentary about ravens.\n\nThere’s trails for Never Mind the Buzzcocks, the Electric Proms and The State Within.\n\nThen, a double bill of the first two episodes of Torchwood. We’ve already looked at Everything Changes, so let’s take a look at Day One. It starts with Gwen and Rhys out for the evening, bowling, taking in a movie, and a meal, which is interrupted by a meteor streaking through the air, and text telling Gwen to come to work.\n\nThe back seats of the black SUV they drive have screens and keyboards that pop down while they’re driving.\n\nThey reach the meteor, wave away the army, and start investigating. Owen is annoying sexist to Gwen, so she throws a chisel at him (to be fair, that was what he asked for) but it hits the meteor and releases a cloud of alien gas which flows around a bit then escapes. They should have brought a Henry Hoover.\n\nThe gas finds its way to the back alley of a nightclub where a girl is leaving an angry voicemail for her boyfriend, and it possesses her.\n\nShe goes into the nightclub, finds a young man, drags him into the toilet and starts having sex with him, until he orgasms and turns into energy which she absorbs. Yes, it’s an Alien Sex Gas.\n\nBack at the Torchwood Hub, the team are recriminating after Gwen’s chisel mishap. My conclusion would be it would have been better if it had hit Owen. But Ianto tells them that there’s been a strange murder report at the nightclub, so they go to investigate. PC Andy is on the door, and there’s an awkward exchange as Gwen goes in. She says “You can get away now. No point you freezing your arse off out here.” Andy pouts “Boss of me now, are you?” “Say hi to everyone for me.”\n\nGiven that the man’s death left just a small pile of dust, the team are curious how the nightclub know there was a murder. And I really wish we hadn’t found out, as we see a flashback to a security guard wanking while watching the woman and man bonking. I know I’m an old man now, but this really is the televisual equivalent of those books by middle-aged male authors that get Bad Sex awards. The recipient in this case being writer Chris Chibnall. It’s almost redeemed by the cut from the flashback to the team in the toilets, surrounding the man, and he says, of watching the man vanish into a puff of sex gas, “Bit of a shock, I tell you.”\n\nThe team look at the CCTV, run her blurry picture against their database of every face in the UK (which Gwen points out breaks all sorts of privacy laws) and track down her address. They catch her just in time, as she’s just started shagging her postman. She tries to run away, but Owen traps her in an alien portable cell, which Jack reminds him he shouldn’t use outside the Hub.\n\nJack asks Gwen to talk to the woman to see if they can learn something about the Alien Sex Gas. It’s not long before they’re snogging. And what do Owen and Toshiko do when they see it on the CCTV? They just watch, and Owen starts recording. This is a very dysfunctional workplace, and they should all receive some mandatory training.\n\nTo calm things down, Jack orders some Chinese food. When Jack goes to the toilet, the others start asking Gwen what she knows about Jack. “You’ve been here longer than I have.” “We were banking on you! You’re a copper, trained to ask questions.”\n\nGwen gets upset when she hears the girl, Carys, crying in the cell. She thinks Jack isn’t doing enough. “Spending so much time with the alien stuff, you’ve lost what it means to be human.” He replies “So remind us. Tell me what it means to be human in the 21st century.” She prints out a stack of information about the girl. This feels like the programme is suddenly trying to be rounded, and grown-up in between all the wanking gags. I’d be genuinely curious to know if this script was heavily edited, and if that’s the case, which bits were who.\n\nThe air in the cell is showing signs of potent sex pheromones, which at least explains why Gwen was snogging her at the drop of a hat. “God, no! We can’t let any man near… Owen!” But when they get to the cell, it’s a bit late. I admit, this bit was funny.\n\nCarys can’t find a way out of the Hub, and Jack is chasing her. But she manages to get away by grabbing the hand in a jar that we saw in the first episode. Jack is extremely worried about it getting damaged, and as a result Carys is able to distract him enough to get away. We hear a familiar musical motif as Jack is picking up the hand from the floor where she threw it – it’s the Doctor’s Theme.\n\nOwen has been doing some research, and has determined the effect of the gas in rats. It’s not pleasant, and he thinks the same thing will happen to Carys soon.\n\nThere’s a really leery montage as Carys is walking through town, lots of people snogging and naked bodies in adverts. This is pornier than the average Game of Thrones episode. She finds her ex-boyfriend, and when he’s nasty to her, she has a very effective revenge shag. The Torchwood team turn up too late, only to find her gone, and him a pile of dust. Time is running out. They find her employment profile, and find she was working at a fertility clinic. It’s the perfect place for the Alien Sex Gas Orgasm Eater – a building full of wankers.\n\nThey’re too late to save all the men, but Carys is still there. How can they save her from the Alien Sex Gas? Jack offers something of his own. “I’ve got a surplus of alive. I’m giving it away.”\n\nGwen tells the alien to take her as a host. It finally leaves Carys, but before it can possess Gwen, Jack drops the portable Cell, and captures it.\n\nCarys is reunited with her dad.\n\nAfter a very strong first episode, I think this was a big drop in quality.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Episodes 1 and 2 of this new science-fiction and crime drama series.

Then, the start of Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman.\n\nWe’re really getting through this new series of Charlie and Lola. I hope it’s not too boring for my regulars, but I’m enjoying rewatching this, especially since my children have quite strong memories of watching these. This episode is Will You Please Stop Messing About?\n\nCharlie is looking forward to seeing his favourite programme, Space Family Hudson.\n\nBut their parents have given them a lot of chores to do before they can watch TV.\n\nLola keeps turning hers into games.\n\n“This is fun Charlie.” “No it’s not.”\n\nI feel for Charlie. I hate putting the washing up away.\n\nAnd frankly, who could resist pretending to be a ghost when putting the washing away.\n\nThe last chore is picking up all the fallen apples, but in the end, they’re having so much fun playing games with the apples, that when Lola says “Charlie, you are going to miss it” he replies “I’m sure I can see it again sometime.” of course, if their family were nice, they’d be recording it for him anyway. This is 2006 after all. (Give it four years, and iPlayer eliminates most of these stresses.)\n\nMedia Centre Description: Children’s animation. Join Lola and Charlie, a brother and sister, as they deal with topics that affect their everyday lives. Charlie can only watch his favourite TV show Space Family Hudson after he and Lola have completed some little jobs for Mum and Dad.

Charlie begs Lola to hurry.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC TWO Monday 23 October 2006 07:00\n\nThe next recording is the BBC One repeat of last week’s Spooks.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Drama series about the British Security Service. Ros is trapped in the Saudi siege, forced to watch hourly assassinations as the government refuse to negotiate with the terrorists who demand the return of Al Qaeda prisoners in Saudi Arabia. But are these terrorists really Al Qaeda?\n\nRecorded from BBC ONE on Monday 23 October 2006 21:00\n\nBBC Genome: BBC ONE Monday 23 October 2006 21:00\n\nAfter this there’s a trail for Graham Norton’s Bigger Picture.\n\nThere’s a Torchwood trail, this time for the BBC Two showing. And a trailer for the Electric Proms, which has frankly left me puzzled.\n\nThen the recording stops after a few minutes of the 10 O’Clock News, leading with an inquiry into cash for honours. Yet another news story that’s echoing today.\n\nThe next recording hops over to BBC Three for the end of Eastenders. And another of those very strange trails for the Electric Proms.\n\nThere’s also a mega trail for new programmes on BBC Three.\n\nThen, the next episode of Spooks. It starts with a man praying (note the prominent crucifix on the wall) and then kissing a bullet. I’m guessing he’s not a good guy.\n\nHarry is told by another carbon-copy supercilious government adviser, Charles Lee (Pip Torrens) that the muslim cleric and terrorist Khalid Mansoor will not face trial, despite MI5 having video of him trying to persuade an 18 year old to blow himself up in Westminster Abbey. He implies that MI5’s methods might have rendered the evidence inadmissible. He also tells Harry that he will need to supervise his briefing documents to the Home Office.\n\nThe team watch the news coverage, as Mansoor walks out of the high court. There’s gunshots, as the man we saw in the opening shoots him dead, shouts “Death to the enemies of Christ” and shoots himself. Adam asks Harry “Tell me that wasn’t us, Harry.”\n\nOn TV, Bishop David Newman (Lennie James) is denying that this is Christians “rising up” against Islam.\n\nThey identify the killer, a former marine with drug and alcohol problems, whose last address was a homeless shelter. “These places offer free bed and board as long as you accept Jesus.” “So this place cured Ellis of his addiction?” “And introduced him to a new one. Religion. The opium of the masses.” Cut to that self same shelter, and Steven Paynton is lecturing a lot of very hard looking men about how Jesus Christ is the best addiction of all. He’s played by Shaun Dingwall, Pete Tyler himself. So with him and Lennie James, that’s two guest stars drawn from Doctor Who. And as the men are reciting the Lord’s Prayer, we see another very heavy-set man walk up to a muslim man, say “Death to the enemies of Christ” and let off a hand grenade.\n\nBishop Newman and Paynton meet. Newman seems to have condoned the death of Mansoor but not the second attack. “The death of Khalid Mansoor was supposed to be the beginning and the end of this, Steven. An example to our enemies that we can’t be pushed around, and to our government that the people would support a tougher stance on Islam and it was working. Our job was done.” But Paynton says the job needs to continue.\n\nMI5 very soon identify Paynton as a common link between the two attacks. They monitor the internet café he frequents, using fibre-optic surveillance directly through a monitor. And although the computer he sat down at looks like a PC, if you flip the screenshot it’s a Mac running Safari. They’ve sent him an email from an organisation called the League of Christ, which used to be a genuine organisation, but which died out, and the team have set it up as a front, an organisation that’s “cash-rich and eager to fund Paynton’s holy war.”\n\nAdam has a mission that means he has to be undercover, and his son Wes is sad that he’s leaving again.\n\nAdam is posing as the head of a brokerage firm that manages the under the table financial transactions for extremist religious groups. “If we tempt him with a possibility of a big strike against his enemies, we can persuade him to postpone his attacks and buy ourselves enough time to uncover his organisation.”\n\nCharles Lee quizzes Harry about the League of Christ. Harry doesn’t tell him that it’s their own cover, just that it wants to fund Paynton’s war. Lee pushes Harry for more information, but Harry won’t compromise the details of their operations. Which is a good thing because the next time we see him, Lee is talking to Bishop Newman about the League of Christ. We learn that the two of them encouraged Paynton to organise the hit on Mansoor, but didn’t expect him to keep going. Because fanatical religious murderers always stop at one, don’t they?\n\nPaynton visits the church again. He knows Newman has asked him there to try to kill him, but he also knows he won’t, and taunts him. “I know why you brought me here. But you haven’t got the guts to kill me, any more than you had the guts to deal with Khalid Mansoor by yourself.”\n\nNewman meets with Lee again. They both know they’re in over their heads, that neither can control Paynton. And Lee has also found out that the League of Christ is an MI5 cover operation, thanks to information leaked to him by the Israeli embassy, who are worried about the organisation because “They smell anti-Semiticism (sic)”. So he knows that MI5 are close to getting the information they need from Paynton which will lead them to Lee and Newman. Lee says that he’s going to let the Israelis think that the League of Christ is genuine. “Perhaps the time has come to confirm their worst suspicions and to suggest that they put an end to the sorry fiasco in their own inimitable way.”\n\nAdam needs to get the information about who was backing Paynton. They know that whoever it was probably knows they are getting close to him, so they’ll either tell him, or kill him. So Adam suggests that he grab Paynton in character as the League of Christ broker. He does this, and Paynton admits that David Newman told him to kill Mansoor.\n\nBut all’s not well, when Jenny phones Thames House to tell them that Adam’s son Wes has gone missing. It looks like he’s run away from home. Zaf tells Adam, but Adam still has to get the full details of Paynton’s army from him, so he has to somehow put it out of his mind.\n\nHarry pays Bishop Newman a visit. When Newman asks how he can protect people like Mansoor, Harry tells him “You see a man like Khalid Mansoor, talking about a Britain under Islamic rule, and it frightens you. It frightens a lot of people. But I see a man like you – conspiring to kill Mansoor, embarking on a journey from which there can be no return… and it frightens me just as much. Today you kill Muslims, tomorrow Jews, and soon we’ll be back burning Catholics and witches. Afghanistan under the Taliban frightens me no more than England under Cromwell.”\n\nAdam takes Paynton to the homeless shelter he runs, to get the names of his ‘soldiers’. One interesting morsel – it looks like this episode is set in February 2007. Paynton tells Adam that one of the men is going to set off a huge explosion in Manchester within the hour. Then the lights in the shelter cut out. Adam is starting to have a breakdown thinking about his son.\n\nThermal imaging shows a team of armed me making their way through the building, and they’re not MI5. Paynton gets shot by them.\n\nRos is the only backup, so she has to go in. She hits the guard, and from his gun identifies the men as Mossad, the Israeli secret service.\n\nAdam recovers when they tell him Wes has been found, but he and Ros are still up against several armed men with night vision goggles. Harry is on the phone to the Israeli embassy telling them that the League of Christ was their cover, and it’s not a real organisation. Adam comes face to face with one of the agents, there’s a dramatic pause, the armed man gets a message, and walks off.\n\nWhen it’s all safe, Zaf arrives in Thames house to tell them they’ve found Wes, at Paddington, trying to get to Heathrow. So Jo lied to Adam.\n\nHarry tells Ros that the loose ends are tied up. The story will be that Paynton was a “delusional right-wing psychopath who managed to persuade two of his converts to martyr themselves for his cause. When the Western world didn’t rise up in support, he took his own life. There was no sponsor.” “And Mossad?” “Tail firmly between their legs.” “They could tell us who put them up to it.” “I suspect whoever that was won’t be making it into work this morning.” Then we see Lee being watched.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Drama series about the British Security Service.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Monday 23 October 2006 22:30\n\nAfter this, a trail for the next episode of Torchwood.\n\nThere’s some 60 Seconds news, including Richard Hammond after his almost fatal car crash.\n\nToday, we’ve got the very first episode of Torchwood – Everything Changes. At the time, this was a very big deal. A spin-off from the new Doctor Who co-created by Russell T Davies, starring the then very popular Captain Jack Harkness. Expectations were quite high.\n\nWe had to find the time to watch it when the children were in bed, because it was billed as ‘adult’ (a word that covers a multitude of good and bad things).\n\nLet’s see what the first episode has in store for us.\n\nIt opens in the rain. The police are attending a murder. PC Gwen Cooper arrives, played by Eve Myles. She chats a bit with her colleague PC Andy. Then the forensic team suddenly start packing off and leaving. Gwen asks why. “Buggered if I know. It’s orders from above.” “But the body’s still in there though, isn’t it? We can’t just leave it.” “Move back, they said, clear the site. Special access, they said.” “For who?” “Torchwood.” “Who’s Torchwood?” “Special ops or something.”\n\nA black car arrives, and out stride four people led by the familiar face of Captain Jack Harkness off of Doctor Who. Of course, Gwen doesn’t know that. The last we saw, Captain Jack had been exterminated by Daleks, and had just been brought back to life by Rose using the power of the Tardis. But that was in the year 200,100, so somehow he travelled back in time. All this is just fan speculation, though, as this programme is setting up a mystery, and we don’t have to know any of that. Yet.\n\nJack gives a soliloquoy about oestrogen in the rain. One of the team puts on a strange gauntlet, puts it under the dead man’s head, and concentrates a bit, then the man wakes up. The tell him he’s dead, and he only has 2 minutes, but he can’t remember anything about what happened. He was stabbed from behind. Then he’s dead again. Gwen watches the whole thing from above, from a multistorey car park. But Jack notices her.\n\nThis recording was a bit glitchy. In this scene there’s a couple of moments where the picture glitches, and we miss a second or so. It’s playing havoc with the subtitles. (See later for a shocking revelation of the source of these glitches.)\n\nUnsure quite what she’s just seen, Gwen returns home where Boyfriend Rhys is watching TV. I do think one of the strengths of this episode is the domesticity. Mysterious things may be happening, but you do get the sense that these are real people.\n\nGwen’s partner PC Andy has some of the best lines. “Bet you ten quid they’re DNA specialists, it’s all DNA these days, like that CSI bollocks. CSI Cardiff, I’d like to see that. They’d be measuring the velocity of a kebab.”\n\nGwen gets slightly injured breaking up a pub fight, and when she’s at hospital getting it treated, she spots Jack heading up some stairs. She finds the room at the top of the stairs sealed off, but when she asks, they don’t know why. There’s a long corridor, and she sees someone at the end. He’s not answering her when she asks him what’s going on, and as she looks closer, he looks like he’s wearing a weird mask.\n\nThe man she’d asked about the room being sealed up arrives, and hasn’t found out why. He’s also impressed with the mask. “Bloody hell, that is brilliant. That’s like, em, Hellraiser. That’s first class, that is. Look at that, it’s just like real teeth.” Famous last words as the creature grabs him and starts chomping on his neck, with more blood that we’d expect to see if this were Doctor Who.\n\nJack and his team appear to subdue the creature, and Jack rushes Gwen out of the room. She leaves the hospital, rather shellshocked. The Torchwood car screeches past, so she gets in her police car and goes in pursuit, leaving poor PC Andy standing there. She gives the registration over the radio, and a colleague updates her on the search for someone called Captain Jack Harkness. They found one, but it can’t be him. “American volunteer, Royal Air Force, 133 Squadron. Except he disappeared. Vanished off the records. Presumed dead.” “When was that?” “1941. At the height of the Blitz. On the morning of January 21 1941, Captain Jack Harkness failed to report for duty, never seen again, till now.”\n\nShe follows the car to the centre of Cardiff, and calls to them. But while she’s distracted by someone telling her she can’t leave her car there, when she looks again, they’ve disappeared.\n\nThat night, she goes back to the city centre (the show making the most of a very distinctive looking locale) and figures out a ruse. She asks the local pizza place if they ever deliver to a Captain Jack Harkness, but nothing comes up. She’s about to leave, foiled again, when she asks “I don’t suppose you’ve got a Torchwood?” “Oh, aye, we do them all the time. They’re good customers.” So she gets the details, orders a couple of pizzas, and knocks on Torchwood’s doors. It looks like a tourist information booth. A young man asks her who the pizza is for, seems amused when she says it’s for Mr Harkness, and presses a button, opening a secret door.\n\nShe goes down a corridor, into a lift, then out into a very large space filled with stuff. There’s things preserved in liquid.\n\nSomeone’s doing welding.\n\nSomeone else is doing weird computer stuff.\n\nEveryone seems to be ignoring her as she walks slowly through, until one of them starts laughing. “I can’t do this, I’m sorry. I’m rubbish. I give up!” The others start laughing too. They’ve clearly been pretending to ignore her, despite knowing why she’s really there. Jack comes out, telling them all about the hilarious banter he’d got worked out. Gwen is deflated. “There’s your pizza. I think I’d better go.” “I think we’ve gone past that stage” replies Jack.\n\nThis is a good scene. It plays off our and Gwen’s expectation that in such a super secret organisation, when she’s been allowed to see so much, and she’s already seen a mad murdered by a strange creature, which they covered up, it’s probably her turn to disappear. But Jack offers to give her the tour. Including, with no explanation, a pterodactyl flying around.\n\nHe shows her the thing that murdered the man in the hospital. It’s a “Weevil”. “But we’ve got a couple of hundred of them in the city living in the sewers, feeding off the… Well, it’s the sewers, you can guess.”\n\nHe introduces her (and us) to the team. Owen Harper (Burn Gorman).\n\nToshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) who was first seen in the Doctor Who episode Aliens of London.\n\nSuzie Costello, second in command (Indira Varma).\n\nAnd Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). “Ianto cleans up after us and gets us everywhere on time.”\n\nGwen is still convinced they’re going to lock her up or do her in. Jack has other plans. “You’re coming with me.” “I’m getting tired of following you.” “No you’re not, and you never will.”\n\nHe takes her out through the scenic route, a platform that goes right up to the ceiling.\n\nAnd through, up to the centre of Cardiff. People are walking past and nobody bats an eyelid. “It’s called a perception filter. He can sort of see us, but we don’t quite register. Just like something in the corner of your eye. It only works on this exact spot.”\n\nJack takes her for a drink. They discuss Torchwood, and its mission to investigate all manner of alien threat. They discuss some of the rather obvious alien happenings recently (as seen in Doctor Who). Gwen says “My boyfriend says it’s like a sort of terrorism. Like they put drugs in the water supplies – psychotropic drugs, causing mass hallucinations and stuff.” He says they collect alien technology, keeping it safe from any one nation. “Cos if one power got hold of this stuff, they could use it for their own purposes.” “But so could you.” “All alien technology stays on the base. No-one’s allowed to take anything outside.”\n\nCut to Toshiko, who’s brought an alien gizmo home with her.\n\nOwen’s got a glowy alien after-shave.\n\nSuzie has taken the life-bringing glove home.\n\nBack at the bar, Gwen tells Jack he could be helping her and the police find the serial killer, whose victim we saw at the start of the episode. He tells her they weren’t there to find the killer, they were there to test the magic glove that brought him back to life. “Well, that’s tough shit. Cos if you let me go, then I have a duty, cos that glove could help us.” “If you remember.” “What d’you mean?” “How’s your drink?” “Have you poisoned me?” “Don’t be so dramatic. It’s an amnesia pill. My own recipe, with a touch of denial and a dash of retcon.” I love that the amnesia drug is called retcon, a name that could only come from someone who’s been in fandom a long time. Gwen goes home and starts writing a document about everything she’s seen, her typing getting more and more random. But Ianto is hacking in to her computer, and deletes everything.\n\nInteresting, during the montage of the Torchwood team, where we see Toshiko use her gizmo to scan an entire book while it’s still on the bookshelf (I want one of those) and Suzie using the glove to revive a dead fly, this broadcast is entirely missing the scene where Owen is in a nightclub, and uses his magic aftershave to make himself irresistible to a woman, and then, to her angry boyfriend. I suspect it’s the swearing that might have caused the cut, despite this going out at 9PM on BBC Three. But the whole scene is missing. (It’s on the iPlayer copy which is how I know). (Once again, this mystery is solved later.)\n\nThese sweeping shots of Jack atop a very high building look slightly like it’s actually a Captain Jack action figure. It’s probably a stuntman, though.\n\nNext morning, Gwen doesn’t even remember who Captain Jack Harkness is. She goes to work as normal. But in the office where they’re investigating the serial killer, she sees a picture of the suspected murder weapon. “Clever, mind, they worked it all out on a computer. Took measurements from the stab wounds, calculated the shape of the blade and stuff, even those prongs – I don’t know how they do it.” But the picture sets her mind off. It reminds her of something she’s seen, but can’t remember.\n\nIt takes a whole montage of Gwen at work and home to percolate through, but eventually she goes back to the city centre. Suzie is there, at the monument. “Hello again. You were right. You told Jack we should liaise with the police. I was the only one who bothered. So I was the only one who saw the report. They got a good likeness.” She shows Gwen the knife. Gwen says “I’m arresting you for… How do I know you?” Suzie pulls a gun, and starts monologuing about how the job gets into you, how she has to leave now to get away. “How come we get all the Weevils and bollocks and shit? Is that what alien life is? Filth?” “Why did you kill those people?” “For the glove. I needed the bodies. That’s how it works. Violent death.” I’ve noticed something strange about this broadcast. There’s been a few MPEG glitches, and they all seem to coincide with, shall we say, adult moments. Swear words, violent scenes. Up till now I had thought it was just a poor recording, but now I think that these aren’t glitches or cuts to the broadcast programme, I think these are edits that I’ve made to the raw file. I think I might have been seeing if it was possible to edit a version of the episode that we could show to our young children, who were already big Doctor Who fans. In the end, I don’t think we did, not for this series. But it certainly explains why this has appeared to be so very, and specifically, glitchy. My editing software must have not been very good at cleaning up the edits. (Sure enough, as I keep watching, there’s another line containing the word “Shit” that’s glitched over.)\n\nAs Suzie goes on, Jack rises up from the magic lift, unseen by both of them. And Suzie talks about how she’s always working, then says “and that’s why the perception filter isn’t gonna work on me” as she shoots him in the head. Oddly, that shot seems to be intact. Was it only the swearing I was worried about? Anyway, Suzie levels the gun at Gwen, but here she hesitates, long enough for Captain Jack to stand up behind her and tell her to put down the gun, as the bullet wound in his head heals up. But Suzie can’t go quietly, and uses the gun on herself (and this shot was edited out).\n\nJack and Gwen have a debrief, on the top of another large building. “Owen and Toshiko, you didn’t tell them that you were shot in the head and survived.” “You didn’t tell them either. Followed my lead. Keep doing that, and you might just get through this.” Jack offers Gwen a job, now there’s a vacancy, and she accepts. And the last edit here was the Next Time trailer and credits. So I was being brutal.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Science-fiction and crime drama created by Russell T Davies dealing with the machinations and activities of the fictional Torchwood Institute in Cardiff.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Sunday 22 October 2006 21:00\n\nI think this still really holds up as the opening episode. There’s only a little of the leery sex side of it, and much more of the mystery. It’s a very good start.\n\nIt seems a bit odd that I don’t have the second episode, broadcast immediately after this one, but I can see that I have a later recording of the BBC Two Double Bill coming up, so I guess that was the one I wanted to keep because it doesn’t have the BBC Three Logo all over it.\n\nThis recording opens with trails for The Catherine Tate Show and it’s “Hello to Jason Isaacs” with a first full trailer for The State Within.\n\nThen, episode three of Robin Hood – Who Shot the Sheriff? In Nettlestone village, a man and his family are being evicted from the mill they’ve worked for years. Robin intercedes, paying off the man’s debt, but when the bailiff arrives in the village to talk to them, before he can say anything, he’s shot in the back with an arrow.\n\nRobin spots a hooded and masked figure running, and chases him, but doesn’t catch him. Will tells him the figure was the Nightwatchman. “The Nightwatchman? Been around for years. He’s a good man. He’s talked about in all the villages. He’s been seen in Nottingham. Even at the castle, always at night. Leaves medicine and stuff. Food. Sheriff’s men are ordered to shoot him on sight, but he’s never hurt a fly.” “Why did he kill Joderic, then?”\n\nThe Sheriff seems happy that Robin has apparently killed an innocent man. His Master-at Arms, de Fourtnoy, (Kwame Kwei-Armah) thinks “There is a political advantage to be had here.” The Sheriff agrees. “Robin Hood has given us the high ground. We should keep it. My thoughts exactly.” “We could have the town criers announce what’s taken place. Make sure everybody knows that an innocent was killed.”\n\nThe Sheriff uses the funeral of Joderic the bailiff to stoke the anti-Robin sentiment. Marion sees someone she knows, who has been called out of retirement to be a guard. I guess it was either that or working for Deliveroo. He talks of his sadness since his wife died.\n\nRobin talks to Marian. She’s angry he killed Joderic, but he protests his innocence, and tells her it was the Nightwatchman. She tells him it wasn’t the Nightwatchman and thinks he’s wasting his time looking for him.\n\nA young boy from Nettleton, the son of the family who were being evicted, is working at the castle. So you know something might happen. Which it does, when the poor boy is shot as he serves the Sheriff. The Sheriff tells de Fourtnoy to lock down the castle. “This is nothing to do with Robin Hood! Lock down this castle. You tell Gisborne to scrap the dogs and find the killer.” But moments later he changes his mind and tells him to double the dogs hunting Robin. “But, my Lord, I thought you said it could not be Hood.” “Two words – mud sticks. Hood’s been blamed for one death, blame him for two. Let Gisborne hunt. Meanwhile, you find out who’s really responsible for this.” Then later, “Do you think… ..two deaths are enough? To get them to really turn against him? The rabble? If we’re going to blame Hood, well, let’s do it properly. What do you think? I think maybe… a few more deaths. Be interesting. Pretty deaths, not just boys. But pretty deaths.”\n\nShortly, a woman is shot by an arrow as Marian is passing her. De Fourtnoy arrives shortly after to urge her to return to her room for safety.\n\nMarian asks her retired friend if it was possible to shoot at the Sheriff’s room from the courtyard. She’s going all CSI ballistics analysis. They also talk again about his dead wife. And he gives her some advice about Robin. “You’re trying to prove it couldn’t be him. You still love him?” “No. Who?” “Tell him. Not that you ever see him, but tell him. Good people do still love him.”\n\nRobin breaks into the castle to talk to the Sheriff. He wants to find the killer as much as the Sheriff. He offers a plan. “Ride through Nettlestone village. Parade yourself. Make sure everybody knows you’re there. That will draw out the killer. And my men will shoot him.”\n\nRobin is spotted in the corridor, but ducks into a room. Luckily, it’s Marian’s room, and he’s able to hide in her bed. They discuss the murders. She thinks De Fourtnoy killed the maid.\n\nThe Sheriff does his walkabout in Nettlestone, and sure enough, the killer is there, but only hits a guard as he walks in front of the Sheriff. Robin spots the Nightwatchman and pursues, this time catching him. And (as I had guessed near the start) it turns out to be Marian. She tells Robin that she knows who the killer is. It’s her retired friend Joe.\n\nThey confront him and beg him to stop. He wants revenge for his wife. “My Ruth, she worked all her life in the castle. When she lay dying, where was the Sheriff? Did he come and visit? Did he send food? No, he sent Joderic because we hadn’t paid our taxes. He put us out and she died like a dog on the street. And now so will he.”\n\nHe won’t back down, and shoots the Sheriff before Robin and Marian can stop him. They shoot him in the arm and he rolls down the hill, but he doesn’t care. “I did it, Ruth, I shot the Sheriff.” The Sheriff steps out from the background, not dead. “No, you shot the Deputy. My lookalike.” I am not surprised they pulled that joke.\n\nBack at the castle, the Sheriff needs a loose end tied up, so he sends Gisborne to kill De Fourtnoy, and get a promotion to Master at Arms into the bargain.\n\nRobin returns to Nettleton to give money to the parents of the murdered Matthew, and to reopen their mill, so the people love him again.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Robin Hood gets the blame when a mysterious sniper murders innocent people in Nottingham.
