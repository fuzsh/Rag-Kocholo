        "text": "English actor, writer, and comedian Simon Pegg was born Simon John Beckingham in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, to Gillian Rosemary (Smith), a civil servant, and John Henry Beckingham, a jazz musician. His parents divorced when he was seven. He later took his stepfather's surname \"Pegg.\" He was educated at Brockworth Comprehensive Secondary School in Gloucestershire and went on to Stratford-upon-Avon College to study English literature and performance studies. He then attended the University of Bristol, and earned a bachelor's degree in drama. In the early 2000s, Pegg moved to London and began forging a successful career in stand-up comedy. Television opportunities followed including roles in Six Pairs of Pants (1995), Asylum (1996), and We Know Where You Live (1997). In 1999, Pegg and Jessica Hynes teamed up to write and star in cult sitcom Spaced (1999), directed by Edgar Wright. The series also featured Pegg's best friend Nick Frost. Pegg's breakthrough in film came with the zom-rom-com Shaun of the Dead (2004), which he also co-wrote with director Edgar Wright. Again, the film featured Nick Frost. The trio also scored a hit with police comedy Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis (2007). Further film successes followed for Pegg, notably in the iconic role of Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in Star Trek (2009) and alongside Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible III (2006) and Mission: Impossible - Phantom Protokoll (2011).\n\nAs both a writer and performer, Jessica Hynes has worked prolifically in television, film and theatre. Born in Lewisham, South London in 1972, she was brought up in Brighton, Sussex. At school, she would write bizarre sci-fi stories. At age 15, she joined the National Youth Theatre and left home at age 18. She then moved to London and took bit parts as an actress and comedienne. She worked on stage with Katy Carmichael, who would later appear as \"Twist\" on Spaced (1999), they both joined Simon Pegg on the sketch show, Six Pairs of Pants (1995). Simon Pegg recommended Jessica for a part on another sketch show, Asylum (1996), which was directed by Edgar Wright. Simon and Jessica became friends, immediately, and decided that they wanted to write comedy together. They came up with Spaced (1999), a sitcom about dysfunction among a group of strange twenty-somethings. Edgar Wright was brought in to direct and the show was filmed in 1998 in North London, during Jessica's first pregnancy. An instant success, \"Spaced\" was commissioned for a second series and Jessica moved on to work in films, winning two British Comedy Awards. She was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for her work in the play, \"The Night Heron\", in 2001, during filming of series 2. She was also nominated for a Best Actress BAFTA Award for the film, Tomorrow La Scala! (2002). Jessica, Simon and Edgar was reunited for the film, Shaun of the Dead (2004), in which Jessica played Simon's school-friend, \"Yvonne\". Her second child was born in 2002. She is now working mainly in film, and is still writing comedy.\n\nCrosbie was born in Gorebridge, Midlothian, Scotland, to Presbyterian parents who disapproved of her becoming an actress. Nevertheless, she joined the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School while still in her teens. Her big break came in 1970 when she was cast as Catherine of Aragon in the BBC television series The Six Wives of Henry VIII, for which she won the 1971 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress. In 1973, she starred alongside Vanessa Redgrave in the BBC serial, A Picture of Katherine Mansfield.\n\nIn 1975, Crosbie made a similar impact as another Queen, Queen Victoria, in the ITV period drama Edward the Seventh, for which she won the 1976 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress. She played Cinderella's fairy godmother in The Slipper and the Rose, which was chosen as the Royal Film Première for 1976. In that film, Crosbie sang the Sherman Brothers' song, \"Suddenly It Happens\". In Ralph Bakshi's animated movie, The Lord of the Rings, filmed in 1978, Crosbie voiced the character of Galadriel, Lady of the Elves. In 1980, she played the abbess in Hawk the Slayer. In 1986, she appeared as the vicar's wife in Paradise Postponed.\n\nAfter appearing in the BBC1 drama Take Me Home, Crosbie's next major role was as Margaret Meldrew, the long-suffering wife of Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave (1990-2000) for which she is best known. She also played Janet, the housekeeper to Dr. Finlay, in the 1993 revival of A.J. Cronin's popular stories. She also had a poignant role in the thriller The Debt Collector (1999).\n\nCrosbie's other roles include playing the monkey-lover Ingrid Strange in an episode of Jonathan Creek (1997), Edith Sparshott in An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1997-2001), and Jessie in the film Calendar Girls (2003). In 2004, Crosbie appeared alongside Sam Kelly in an episode of the third series of Black Books, as the mother of the character Manny Bianco. In the series six and seven of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series Old Harry's Game, she played a recently deceased historian named Edith.\n\nIn 2008 she appeared in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit and an AXA Sun Life television advertisement for the over-50s. In 2009, she portrayed Sadie Cairncross in the BBC television series Hope Springs. In 2010 Crosbie appeared in the Doctor Who episode \"The Eleventh Hour\" and in the New Tricks episode \"Coming Out Ball\". In 2014 Crosbie appeared in the movies What We Did on Our Holiday and Into the Woods. In 2015 she appeared in a BBC adaptation of the novel Cider with Rosie. In 2016 she appeared in the new film version of Dad's Army .\n\nCrosbie was awarded an OBE in 1998 for services to drama.\n\nCrosbie is divorced from Michael Griffiths, the father of both her children, Owen and Selina (also an actress).\n\nShe is a campaigner for greyhound welfare. Since 2003, she has been President of the League Against Cruel Sports. She has also fronted commercials for Sun Life Direct insurance.\n\nGenial Manchester-born comic actor Sam Kelly had a considerable gift for timing and observation. His special forte was playing decrepit, rheumy characters of more advanced years than his own actual age. Among the many endearing impressions he made on the small screen, he is probably best remembered as the illiterate crook 'Bunny' Warren in Porridge (1974) and as the inept German officer Hans Geering in 'Allo 'Allo! (1982), forever abbreviating the Nazi salute to a shout of \"Tler!\" (which to many ears sounded like 'klop' or 'club'). His other sitcom credits include Norman Elston in Now and Then (1983), the servant Nathaniel Grunge in the Georgian period romp Haggard (1990) and the chauffeur Sam Jones in On the Up (1990). Kelly's expressive features also splendidly suited a varied gallery of Dickensian characters: the timid Mr. Snagsby (Bleak House (1985); the undertaker Mr. Mould (Martin Chuzzlewit (1994); the kindly manservant Giles (Oliver Twist (1999); and the grocer Cudlipp (in John Sullivan's ITV adaptation Micawber (2001)).\n\nBy his own admission, Kelly might have been content running a village post office. He began his working life as a clerk in the Liverpool civil service before enrolling at the London Academy of Dramatic Arts at the age of twenty. He graduated in 1967 and then acted in regional repertory theatre for five years. In the course of his subsequent career, he made frequent appearances at London's West End, at the Old Vic and at the Royal Court in plays ranging from \"The Odd Couple\" and \"HMS Pinafore\" to \"War and Peace\". The stage was to remain his preferred medium, allowing him to occasionally branch out into serious roles (while regular television work necessarily paid the bills). His dramatic performance as a sorrowful bachelor facing retirement in \"Grief\" (2011) at the National Theatre was said to have been his best.\n\nIn 1977, Kelly co-founded the Croydon Warehouse Theatre, which operated until its closure due to financial and structural problems in 2012.\n\nAn actor and stand up comedian, born in London to Iranian parents of the Baha'i faith. He studied English and Theatre Studies. He recently starred in the Netflix Global drama Der Brief für den König (2020) as Sir Fantumar and the HBO/BBC series His Dark Materials (2019). A Perrier Award nominee in 2002 and Edinburgh Comedy Award Panel Prize winner in 2016, Omid has starred in films such as the smash hits Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! (2018), the Oscar nominated Shaun das Schaf: Der Film (2015), Oscar winning Gladiator (2000), Sex and The City 2, The Mummy and The Infidel. Other films include Mr Nice, Grown Your Own, Over the Hedge, Casanova, Modigliani, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Calcium Kid, Anita & Me, Mean Machine and Spy Game. Other notable TV credits include two series of his own BBC One show, The Omid Djalili Show (2007), and a co-starring role in Whoopi Goldberg's NBC sitcom Whoopi. Omid was also part of the 2018 line-up for ITV's We Are Most Amused and Amazed, a televised celebration for The Prince of Wales' 70th birthday. Omid executive produced the acclaimed 2015 documentary We Are Many (2014) about the global anti-war demonstrations that took place in 800 cities on 15th February 2003."
