        "text": "LONDON – Award winning comedian Rob Brydon and his eight-piece band will take to the road next year with a brand new show, Rob Brydon – Songs and Stories. This is the first time that Brydon has created a show that includes songs and music as well as his acclaimed wit and comedy.\n\nThis extensive new tour begins in February 2020 and will travel to almost 30 venues across the country beginning in Colchester on 26 February 2020 and going on to Bexhill-on-Sea, the Alexandra Palace in London, High Wycombe, Weymouth, Swansea, Aberystwyth, Folkestone, Salisbury, Stevenage, Guildford, Warrington, Hull, Huddersfield, Aylesbury, Woking, Watford, Cheltenham, St Albans, Worthing, Buxton, Rhyl, Inverness, Perth, and finishing in Aberdeen on 30th April.\n\nWith songs from Sondheim to Rodgers and Hammerstein, from Paul Simon to Tom Waits and almost everything in between, audiences can expect Rob’s usual warmth and humour as well as some of his famed gallery of voices.\n\nRob is aware that some people might be taken aback by what they might perceive as a change of tack with “Songs & Stories”. He said of his new show: “It will take some people by surprise. There are so many media outlets nowadays that some people might only know me from Gavin and Stacey or Would I Lie To You?. Those people often say to me, ‘I didn’t know you could sing’, and yet I have sung a lot. I hope this show is a very pleasant surprise for audiences.”\n\nBefore the show begins its Spring tour, Rob Brydon – Songs & Stories will be performed in December 2019 with pianist and musical director Paul Herbert in the intimate surroundings of Crazy Coqs in London.\n\nRob Brydon’s varied career began with the TV comedy shows Marion and Geoff and Human Remains in 2000, for which he won British Comedy Awards. Since then his comedy credits have included A Small Summer Party, The Keith Barret Show, Directors Commentary, Supernova, Cruise Of The Gods, Black Books, I’m Alan Partridge, Little Britain, Live At The Apollo, Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive, QI, The Big Fat Quiz Of The Year, Have I Got News For You, Gavin and Stacey, Rob Brydon’s Identity Crisis, Would I Lie To You and The Trip with Steve Coogan.\n\nHe has also appeared in the dramas Oliver Twist, Heroes and Villains: Napoleon, The Way We Live Now, Murder In Mind, Kenneth Tynan: In Praise of Hardcore, Marple and the films 24 Hour Party People, MirrorMask, A Cock and Bull Story and the film Swimming with Men.\n\nIn 2009 alongside Ruth Jones, Robin Gibb and Sir Tom Jones, Rob reached number one in the UK charts with the single Islands in The Stream, in aid of Comic Relief. He also embarked on an 87 date tour of the UK with his stand up show, Rob Brydon Live which included a three week run in London’s West End. He is currently on a sold-out tour with Lee Mack and David Mitchell."
