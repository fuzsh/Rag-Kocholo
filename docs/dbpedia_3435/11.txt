Rob Brydon's spoof panel show, Annually Retentive, launched with more than 400,000 viewers on BBC3 last night.

Annually Retentive gives viewers a glimpse backstage to see guests rehearsing their ad libs and Brydon's host slagging off virtually everyone around him.

The six-parter made its debut with 408,000 viewers between 10.30pm and 11pm, making Annually Retentive the most watched multichannel show in its slot.

Annually Retentive was up against ITV2's Love Island Aftersun, which attracted 261,000 viewers.

E4 also introduced a new series last night, Ghost Whisperer, a US drama import starring Jennifer Love Hewitt as a young woman who sees dead people.

Ghost Whisperer was watched by 411,000 viewers in the 9pm hour, making it the second most watched multichannel programme at that time.

The most popular 9pm show in multichannel homes was ITV3's Rosemary and Thyme repeat, which attracted 654,000 viewers.

ITV3 also ruled the multichannel roost in the preceding hour, with a Poirot repeat attracting 630,000 viewers from 8pm.

However, the most popular multichannel programme of the day was E4's Lost premiere in the hour from 11pm, which had 864,000 viewers.

BBC3's 10pm EastEnders repeat came in second in multichannel homes, pulling in 789,000 viewers.

In the same slot, E4's Russell Brand-fronted Big Brother's Big Mouth drew 427,000 viewers.

Earlier in the day, E4's Hollyoaks premiere from 7pm attracted 459,000 viewers, while Sky One's best-rating show was a Simpsons repeat at 7.30pm, which had 402,000 viewers.
