American colleges and universities in 2016-17.\n\nFrancis Su, outgoing President of the American Mathematical Association, marked the end of his term with a speech on mathematics for human flourishing. I won‚Äôt try to summarize it, just go read it. Best thing you‚Äôll read all week, I promise.\n\nMarkus Eichhorn on discovering that pioneering plant ecologist Heinz Ellenberg was a Nazi collaborator. Ellenberg was part of a scientific team assembled by enthusiastic fascist Otto Schultz-Kampfhenkel to produce maps for the German military. Markus suggests that scientists and their science ought to be evaluated separately. I agree.\n\n‚ÄúVast literatures‚Äù as ‚Äúmud moats‚Äù that prevent productive online discussion of controversial topics. Includes a very interesting suggestion, the ‚Äútwo paper rule‚Äù, that might improve matters.\n\nSticking with Noahpinion: he says that economists need to do a better job of linking theory and data. Read it, compare to how ecologists link theory and data.\n\nFollowing on from the previous link: You probably think that the two modes of inference are deduction and induction. But there‚Äôs a third: abduction. Also known as ‚Äúinference to the best explanation‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fascinating, understudied, and controversial topic in philosophy of science, since it‚Äôs not easy to say what distinguishes a good abductive inference from overfitting and researcher degrees of freedom. The philosophical literature on abduction is of direct practical scientific relevance since many everyday scientific inferences are best thought of as abductive rather than inductive or deductive. Here‚Äôs a great accessible primer on abduction in the context of economics, that applies straightforwardly to ecology as well. And here‚Äôs another accessible primer aimed at philosophers. (ht @Noahpinion)\n\nHoisted from the comments: In past posts I‚Äôve asked readers to name neglected should-be classics in ecology and evolution. Writing in Am Nat, Pennell & O‚ÄôConnor suggest a candidate: Felsenstein 1978 on the evolution of ecosystems. Joe Felsenstein‚Äôs name also comes up in discussions of everything from great acknowledgments to amusing co-authors to classic contrarian papers. In another old post that I can‚Äôt find just now, I asked readers to name current or past scientists who would be, or would‚Äôve been, great bloggers. I‚Äôm embarrassed that Joe Felsenstein‚Äôs name didn‚Äôt come up‚Äìhe should‚Äôve been right at the top of the list!\n\nThe Trump administration is making it harder to access all sorts of government data. This seems to me like the sort of thing that scientists ought to push back against hard, and that scientists can push back against without being seen as left-wing partisans. (ht @dandrezner)\n\nGrade inflation and compression is a thing, especially (but not exclusively) at elite US prep schools, colleges, and universities. In response, some elite institutions are proposing to get rid of grades entirely in favor of qualitative transcripts that would resemble reference letters. Catherine Rampell argues that this move is what game theory would predict‚Äìand that it‚Äôs not in the interests of less well-off students. (ht Crooked Timber, which has commentary)\n\nAdvice for interviewing for a PhD position in the UK. See also the previous post on preparing your PhD application.\n\nWait, cicada brood X is emerging 4 years early? Anybody know more about this? Is it always the case that there‚Äôs a ton of within-brood variance in emergence time?\n\nAaron Ellison on why he blogs, and some advice on how to get started. Remarks for a general public audience. Related: my advice for anyone thinking of starting a science blog.\n\nSticking with Aaron: advice for anyone editing a book of contributed chapters. The final piece of advice is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do it!‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm a bit late to this, so slightly belated congratulations to David Tilman FRS! (ht@JeffOllerton)\n\nNeil Gaiman on Neil Armstrong‚Äôs (and his own) imposter syndrome. (ht @jtlevy)\n\nPop lyrics are getting more repetitive. As demonstrated via compression algorithms. (ht Marginal Revolution)\n\nAnd finally, a cheerful visual history of philosophy. üôÇ (ht @kjhealy) Which inspired me to do the same thing for evolutionary biology. Behold:\n\nFrom Meghan:"
