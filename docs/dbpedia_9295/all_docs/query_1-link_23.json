        "text": "s a teenager he became obsessed with shooting and would often go out to shoot with his Uncle Jos (Josiah Wedgwood) and William Owen, the head of the other household that the family were close to. His father was worried that the boy would become one of the idle rich, prompting him to tell Charles that ‘you care for nothing but shooting, dogs and rat-catching; and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family’. Shooting birds was then a very acceptable sport which the young Darwin clearly enjoyed and was very good at. But his passion for shooting eventually faded, one story states that he once came across a bird that was shot the day before but was still alive; another tells of a beetle that was sent to him as an old man, alive but clearly suffering, Darwin gently put both of these creatures out of their suffering. It is also clear that Darwin’s zeal for shooting on the Beagle Voyage started to diminish, and he often hired men to do the shooting for him.\n\nHis passion for collecting never stalled. As a university student at Christ’s College, Cambridge Darwin was an avid beetle collector, eventually amassing one of the best beetle collections he knew of. His beetle collecting also got his name in print for the first time, J. F. Stephen lists Darwin as a collector in his Illustrations of British Entomology. Throughout his life Darwin continued to collect; on the Beagle voyage it was his main occupation, he later (by post) collected enough barnacles to write the authoritative account of the group, his next project saw him collect the bones and measurements of many domestic animals, and of course the greatest hallmark of Darwin’s work was his collecting of facts which he used so well to outline and support his theories!\n\nLike most young men Darwin had eyes for more than just beetles and birds. When he was 18 the young Charles set his eye on a different sort of bird, Fanny Owen, the daughter of a family friend. She was dark eyed, petite and apparently quite striking, and a bit of a flirt. Darwin, the young romantic, took her shooting and for walks in the Owen country estate and they exchanged flirtaceous letters referring to one another as Mr. Postillion and the dutiful housemaid; Darwin even had thoughts of marriage!\n\nWhen he went off to university there was a possibility she might have waited for him, but when he decided to go on a round the world trip she did not. Whilst on the other side of the world Darwin got letters saying Fanny had married another, he was devastated! Especially when she continued to send flirty letters…\n\nWritten by Sarah Gardner"
