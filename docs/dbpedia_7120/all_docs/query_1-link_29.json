        "text": "Hi there, welcome to the forum!\n\nâ€‹\n\nOverview\n\nThe Delhi Metro covers the city of Delhi, along with the outskirts of the city like Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and of course, Ghaziabad. It is one of the most extensive local train networks around the world. It has an estimated 20 million passengers on a daily basis, making it one of the most utilised metro systems in the world too. Another good feature of the Delhi Metro is that some stations are directly just adjacent to some of the stations of the Indian Railways. Some of these are the Anand Vihar Metro Station, Chandni Chowk Metro Station, Nangloi Metro Station and of course, the New Delhi Metro Station.\n\nThe New Delhi Railway Station - Nearest Metro Stations\n\nMetro StationDistance from New Delhi Railway StationLineNew Delhi Metro Station800 metresYellowRamakrishna Ashram Marg Metro Station2.3 kilometresBlueKirti Nagar Metro Station10.6 kilometresBlueAIIMS Metro Station11.7 kilometresYellowGTB Nagar Metro Station12.6 kilometresYellowJanak Puri East Metro Station15.6 kilometresBlueRithala Metro Station20.9 kilometresRed\n\nThese are the nearest metro stations to the New Delhi Railway Station, also included are their distances from the railway station and their line.
