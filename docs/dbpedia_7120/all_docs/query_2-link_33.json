        "text": "Metrolite\n\nNew Delhi, India (Urban Transport News): A team of TechPro Engineers Pvt. Ltd. under the supervision of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC) has commenced soil testing and geotechnical investigation activities for the proposed Kirti Nagar-Bamnoli Village Metrolite project in Delhi.\n\nThe Geotechnical investigation work has been started on 18th September 2020 by the contractor at various locations by deploying ground boring machines to dig the land in depths of 1.5 meters to 24 meters. These activities are performed by geotechnical engineers to obtain information on the physical properties of soil earthworks and foundations for proposed structures.\n\nAccording to DMRC officials, the data captured through geotechnical investigation reports will serve to help them to determine the line’s optimal alignment. Later it will be included in the upcoming civil construction tenders to help construction firms. This will help the bidders to understand the use of appropriate machinery, methods & technology during the construction phase of the Metrolite project.\n\nThe contract worth Rs 68.08 lakh was awarded to TechPro Engineers back in August 2020. The firm has to complete the work within 4 months.\n\nThe topographical survey and utility identification will be carried out by Gaveshana Geosciences Pvt Ltd. as a contract worth Rs 37.80 lakh was awarded to the firm by DMRC in August 2020.\n\nThe 19.15 km Metrolite corridor will connect Kirti Nagar to Bamnoli Village in Dwarka sub-city through 21 mixes of elevated and at-grade stations. The names of the proposed station are Kirti Nagar, Saraswati Garden, Mayapuri Bus Depot, Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Mayapuri Industrial Area (MIA), Mayapuri Industrial Area 2 (MIA 2), Tihar Jail, Shivpuri, Dabri Village, Sitapuri, Mahavir Enclave, Dwarka Sector 2, Dwarka Sector 7, Dwarka Sector 6, Dwarka Court, Dwarka Sector 20, Dwarka Sector 23, Dhul Siras – Dwarka Sector 24, Dwarka Sector 25 – ECC Centre and Bamnoli Village.\n\nThe Metrolite is a cheaper, smaller and slower urban rail transit system compared to the metro rail system."
