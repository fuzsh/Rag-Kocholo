        "text": "Nỉ hào ma? Welcome to Vietnam and Ventech Asia. Lovely to have a new task of being a reliable local point of contact to those who wish to come to Vietnam and Indochina to make businesses Many of my Singaporean partners and friends have frequently sent my contact to new comers who have been assigned to travel to Vietnam to explore new business opportunities. As \"think globally, act locally\" advices, knowing and understanding local culture is a must to those who would like to go beyond their traditional territories to carry out their new assignments. It is true that different country has different culture where its population's thought, acts and decision-making process are not the same. Even in the same country, different region's inhabitants are not thinking and doing the same. So reading, learning, proactive interactions and keen observations in everywhere we travel would help bridge the culture gaps and enhance our understanding of different cultures across the globe.\n\n“Back to basics”. That was the underlying theme of the recent McDonald’s Japan Convention I attended, and I think it has a powerful message for all of us. It was a fantastic event, I must say. 5,000 plus individuals gathered to explore the future of this global giant in the region, and there were some insightful discussions around the room. Their own “back to basics” strategy, focusing on their core strengths like great products, a vibrant culture, and a loyal customer base, was definitely the highlight for me. I think we can all agree it’s easy to be swayed by the newest trends or challenges. And yet, all too often, the simple, foundational elements of our operations are what truly drive success. At Welbilt, we pride ourselves on a similar foundation. Yes, we always have an eye on putting innovation on the table, but we never lose sight of the fundamentals that put us on the map. Those key elements that truly reflect our purpose, commitment to quality and simplicity, and connect us with our customers - that is ultimately what keeps our team dedicated and our clients loyal. As we prepare to celebrate Singapore National Day tomorrow, I felt this was an important message to share. Let’s embody this spirit of acknowledging and appreciating our roots. To honour our heritage and the fundamental values that have shaped this great nation. Happy National Day, Singapore! And to my Welbilt team, may we continue to deliver excellence.

Joy and Hope in the future 🏅 In the past year, Hong Kong has been struggling with a worrying economy. 😞 People walking at the streets either look frustrated or disappointed with the economy. Our city was full of negative news previously: - closure of retail stores - layoffs - declining property prices - government deficits ☀ Finally this summer, Hong Kong has exciting news to share. 🔥 In a city of about 7 million people, we have 3 Olympic winners who won us 4 medals! This represents our Hong Kong spirit & capability: ☄ We never give up! ☄ We make use of what’s available to us and maximise our full potential! ☄ We might always fall down but we stand back up and improve and reinvent ourselves with a new and better version. 🚶♀️ Now when I walk at the streets, I see many proud, joyful and happy faces! This is very motivating because our Olympic medallists taught us the mindset of perseverance. 🔶 No matter what your struggle is, keep grinding through. 🔶 We will find a way through darkness and search a way out. 🔶 If what we are doing now is not working, try another path but do not give up. ✨ For more career & personal growth tips, please visit my site at www.thenicolehui.com I wrote a guide on: 📝 Fixing your CV & LinkedIn in 1 Day: Link: https://lnkd.in/ggNqAK87 🔥 Negotiate for salary increase or promotion!

As a Singaporean leading a sales team in Bangkok many years ago, my background initially made me feel like a puzzle piece from a different set – unsure if I'd truly fit. The vibrant and dynamic Thai culture added another layer to the challenge. But the MD that hired me saw a different picture. He chuckled and said, \"𝘉𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧, 𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘮𝘦 𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 𝘢𝘨𝘰 𝘢𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘤𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘳? 𝘛𝘩𝘢𝘵'𝘭𝘭 𝘣𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘵𝘩 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰𝘰.\" His unexpected reference to a past positive interaction instilled a welcome sense of confidence. 𝐁𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐆𝐚𝐩 Many of us, including myself, feels unsure of how our unique experiences can bridge the cultural gap. Here's how I embraced the challenge: ▶ 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬: I actively learned about Thai language communication styles, respect for hierarchy, and collectivism. This understanding paved the way for stronger connections with my team. ▶ 𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐦𝐲 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: My Singaporean directness, while a valuable asset, could be perceived as aggressive in the Thai environment. I learned to adapt by incorporating a touch of Thai graciousness, or \"mai pen rai\" whenever necessary. ▶ 𝐅𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐭: Open communication and teamwork became the cornerstones of our team dynamic. We celebrated both individual strengths and the collective achievements of the team. We also bonded through team dinners and weekend events where staff families joined in a carnival-like atmosphere. By cultivating cultural awareness, appreciating my own background, and fostering collaboration, I transformed a team with initial resistance into a powerful, high-performing unit. ❓ Have you ever been deployed to a team with colleagues from different backgrounds and nationalities? How did you managed the cross culture difference? _______________ 💡 𝘍𝘰𝘭𝘭𝘰𝘸 𝘮𝘦 #thomashoon 𝘢𝘴 𝘐 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦 𝘰𝘯 𝘊𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘢, 𝘴𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘴, 𝘮𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵, 𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘱, 𝘵𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘶𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘱𝘰𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘢𝘭 #leadershipdevelopment #globalmindset #culturaldiversity #globalleadership #thailand\n\nI was fortunate enough to celebrate New Year in Singapore – what an incredible place. My daughter had previously worked there and returning for New Year together, was a post COVID plan which we were finally able to achieve. We enjoyed many aspects of an engaging nation, with ease of access to transport, walking routes and a real sense of East meets West in a blend of culture and history. Visiting the National Gallery was a highlight. I am not usually an ‘art person’ – I know what I like, but the Liu Kuo-Sung exhibition on Experimentation as Method, triggered hugely positive engagement and discussion in relation to challenge and the critical role that innovation contributes. His narrative was fascinating and I could not help but draw parallels in achieving excellence in HR’s role to encourage interaction, supporting mutual growth and maturity; naturally restraining each other as a new vitality is created through collaboration. Over a 70 year+ career, Liu Kuo-Sung has said that he continues to progress his thinking and now feels that art or culture, should be borderless and global, not nationalist. He was asked the question: where do you find inspiration to express yourself? ….a great question. A very thought provoking visit. #singapore #nationalgallerysingapore #liukuosung #experimentationasmethod #reinvention #perspectives\n\n🌟 Celebrating Local Excellence: Shanti Pereira's Historic Asian Games Gold and the Untapped Potential of Singaporean Talent 🇸🇬🥇 Today, let's celebrate the extraordinary achievements of Singaporean sprinter Shanti Pereira 🏃♀️. She not only won a silver medal but also clinched a historic gold in the 200m at the Asian Games 2023 🥇🥈. 🤔 Colonial Mentality 🕰️ This \"colonial mentality\" often favors overseas talent, affecting various sectors from sports to academia and corporate leadership. Shanti's victory challenges this mindset, showcasing the capabilities of our local talents. 🎓 Academic Lens 👓 In academia, international perspectives are valuable, but local expertise shouldn't be overlooked. Local leaders understand domestic nuances and have a vested interest in long-term success. They can provide insights that are deeply rooted in the local context, enriching the academic landscape. 🏢 Corporate View 💼 In business, expatriates often fill senior roles, sidelining equally qualified locals. Local leaders, however, understand the domestic market better and are invested in long-term success. They bring a unique blend of local insights and global perspectives, making them invaluable assets. 🏆 Sports and Beyond ⚽ Shanti Pereira's historic gold medal win is a testament to the potential of local athletes. Talent programs should focus on nurturing homegrown talent. These athletes not only bring glory to the nation but also inspire the younger generation to pursue excellence. 🤝 Balanced Approach 🌐 Advocating for local talent isn't xenophobia. Singapore thrives on openness and inclusivity. A balanced approach values both local and overseas talents, creating a harmonious and productive environment. 🔑 Conclusion 🎯 Shanti Pereira's historic achievements serve as a compelling reminder of the untapped potential of local talent. It's crucial for Singapore to invest in its people, offering them opportunities to shine. This investment will pay dividends in the form of a more vibrant, diverse, and inclusive society. #LocalTalent 🇸🇬 #ShantiPereira 🏃♀️ #AsianGamesGold 🥇 #Singapore 🇸🇬 #TalentDevelopment 🌱 #Inclusivity 🤝 #Diversity 🌈\n\n🛍 Yesterday, I was shopping leisurely at TANGS when I came across this racing green banner that says “91 years of joy”. I’m sure it’s equally joyful for TANGS and their customers over the years. ☺️ 🛍 So I was like Wow! They must have evolved and done something right to stay in business for so long. 🛍 I start to wonder how many companies in Singapore will surpass or has surpassed the 100 year mark. 📰 Here’s what I found from a ST article in 2017 (6yrs ago). Feel free to contribute if you know more companies that I missed out. 🛍 Founded in 1932, TANGS is probably one of the oldest retail store in Singapore. So what other companies are or approaching 100 years old? 1. CYC (1935) The family-run tailoring business. Also the tailor of our beloved late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. 2. EU YAN SANG (1879) A trusted household name in the TCM (traditional Chinese medicine)space. 3. LKF MEDICAL (1928) Leung Kai Fook Medical. Doesn’t ring a bell? Think Axe Oil? 4. HAW PAR (1900s) Sounds familiar? Of course! You have may have heard or even used their famous Tiger Balm.🐯 5. YEO HIAP SENG (1901) The company that brought us soft drinks in tetra packs. 🛍 Whether it’s Singapore or any other country, heritage companies need to evolve and stay relevant to stay in business. 🛍 Being too absorbed in their own heritage or way of doing things and thinking that’s what sets them apart is not good enough. They have to stay relevant to a generation of Gen Z, Alpha and beyond digital natives who yearn not only quality products but also something sustainable and unique. 💪 Personally I hope to see more Singapore companies crossing the 100 year mark. Not easy but doable. I’m Kelvin Cheong 鍾冠雄. Happy to connect.
