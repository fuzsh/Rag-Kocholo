        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” EMusic.com issued a stern decree to Napster and its users to halt the trade of the online retailer's licensed songs.\n\nTo back up its threat, EMusic said it would deploy a new technology to identify its music and send an instant message to song-swapping offenders to stop in their tracks and quit trading the tunes within 24 hours.\n\nEMusic president and CEO Gene Hoffman said Napster balked at other solutions to stem the unauthorized trade of music, leaving the online retailer no choice but to crack down on the song sharing.\n\n\"Over the past several months, EMusic has continually offered to work in good faith with Napster on this issue,\" Hoffman said. \"Napster's unfortunate and inflexible response has been that EMusic's only course of action is to request that offending users' accounts be cut off completely.\"\n\nNapster officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nUsing something it called \"acoustic fingerprinting,\" EMusic hopes to spy on the music trading habits of Napster users and ferret out the music it owns license rights to distribute. EMusic's label partners and artists include Green Day, Louis Armstrong and Kenny Rogers.\n\nEmusic plans to flash an on-screen message to the music trader that the file being shared is copyrighted material and should be removed. Napster told EMusic it would only block access to those users whose names were provided to it.\n\n\"It seems Napster would rather shut down user accounts, than to deal directly with the problem of illegally distributed files,\" Hoffman said.\n\nIt's a battle between two fledgling Redwood City-based companies trying to get a foothold in the lucrative online music distribution market, one that could explode with activity as faster Internet connections become more prevalent.\n\nNapster has been dogged by copyright infringement complaints since its inception. The company was sued in federal court by major record labels for copyright infringement shortly after the song-sharing service launched last year. That case is currently on appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court.\n\nLast month, Napster reached a tentative deal with Bertelsmann's BMG music division to develop what the partners characterized as a new, secure membership-based distribution system that will guarantee payments to artists.\n\nNapster claims to have 38 million registered users.\n\nEMusic has licensing agreements with more than 600 independent record labels and popular artists and allows sampling and purchases of music in the popular MP3 format.\n\nOnline music sales sites such as EMusic's are still an unproven entity. When Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to pay Emusic.com Inc. $3 million in a cross-marketing deal, the sum exceeded the aggregate sales of all music downloads, according to Aram Sinnreich of Jupiter Research."
