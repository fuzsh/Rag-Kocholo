        "text": "April 4\n\nNitti Signs Label Deal With Warner Bros. Records\n\nWBR to Become New Home for Grammy-Nominated Producer's Playmaker Music\n\nApril 04, 2007 -- Warner Bros. Records is pleased to announce it has signed a label deal with Grammy-nominated producer Nitti for his label Playmaker Music. Under the deal, Warner Bros. Records will market, promote, and distribute new artists that Nitti, who was previously a staff producer for Jermaine Dupri's So So Def Recordings, signs to Playmaker Music.\n\nAn in-demand hip-hop producer who is known for a distinctive production style that features a high-tempo, snap-like beat, Nitti has produced a string of chart-topping singles, including Yung Joc's blockbuster \"It's Goin' Down,\" Boyz In the Hood's \"Dem Boyz,\" Eightball's \"Stop Playin' Games,\" Gucci Mane's \"Go Head,\" Ali and Gipp's \"Hard in the Paint,\" Sunny V's \"F You Pay Me,\" and T.I.'s most recent single \"Where They At.\" The Decatur, Georgia-born producer also has album cuts on Young Jeezy's \"Thug Motivation 101,\" Young Dro's \"Best Thang Smokin',\" and \"Lights, Camera, Action,\" from Atlanta's Young Capone's forthcoming album.\n\n\"I've been producing beats and making music my whole life,\" says Nitti, \"and I feel that Warner Bros. understands and appreciates what I have to offer as a producer and musician. I look forward to a truly successful venture for everyone.\"\n\nNitti has also crafted beats for a variety of best-selling rappers, including Nelly, Bow Wow, and Ludacris. A multi-instrumentalist who plays guitar, keyboard, and drums, Nitti, whose mother was a program director for a local gospel radio station, credits a church background in Decatur for his unique take on hip-hop rhythms. \"Gospel taught me how to listen to melodies and arrange songs,\" he says. \"My music is real street and clubby. It's hard, but at the same time, it makes you want to move.\"\n\nNitti has been nominated for several awards including a 2007 Grammy for \"Best Rap Song\" for \"It's Goin' Down,\" two BET Hip-Hop Award noms for \"Producer of the Year\" and \"Track of the Year\" (which he won), and a Southern Entertainment Award for \"Producer of the Year.\"\n\nFor more information about Nitti, please visit www.myspace.com/rickflaire.\n\nMar 31\n\nR.E.M. Announce First Live Shows in Two Years to Take Place in Ireland in July\n\nFive-Night Residency at Dublin's Historic Olympia Theatre to Serve as 'Live Rehearsal' for Subsequent Recording of Band's 14th Studio Album\n\nR.E.M. has announced a special five-night residency at Dublin, Ireland's fabled Olympia Theatre to take place June 30th, July 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, enabling the band -- singer Michael Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck, and bassist Mike Mills -- to test out brand-new songs for their upcoming 14th studio album.\n\n\"Returning to Dublin for our live rehearsal this summer provides the great start we need for our next album's work,\" says Stipe. \"I intend to hit the ground running.\" Mills says the band chose the Olympia, a historic music hall built in 1879, because of all the great shows they've seen there over the years: \"From the Waterboys to Lou Reed. I am thrilled to play at this wonderful venue, and in front of some of the best fans in the world,\" he says.\n\nThe shows -- which are R.E.M.'s first since their memorable concert in London's Hyde Park in July 2005 -- coincide with the recording of the new album, which will take place in Dublin, Vancouver, and the band's hometown of Athens, GA. Grammy Award-winning producer Jacknife Lee, best known for his production work on U2's \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,\" as well as albums by Snow Patrol, The Hives, Kasabian, Aqualung, and Bloc Party, will be at the helm. Lee, who met with the band in Athens in February, calls R.E.M.'s new material \"some of their most exciting and visceral yet.\"\n\nThe album will be the Grammy-winning band's first studio album since 2004's \"Around the Sun.\" In September 2006, R.E.M. released a two-disc retrospective, \"And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982-1987,\" which featured songs from the band's early years on indie label I.R.S.\n\nEarlier this month R.E.M. were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame with former drummer Bill Berry. Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who presented the band at the ceremony in New York City, called their music \"truly all-encompassing.\"\n\nTickets for the Dublin shows are available now at www.remhq.com or in person at the Olympia Theatre box office starting at 9 a.m. Saturday, March 31st.\n\nwww.remhq.com\n\nMar 29\n\nThe Third Soundtrack Album From \"ONE TREE HILL\" to Be Released April 3 on Warner Bros. Records\n\nCharacters on the Popular Series Take a Road Trip to Honey Grove, Texas, While Listening to \"The Road Mix\"\n\nThe CW Network drama \"ONE TREE HILL\" has often offered its fans unique opportunities to interact with its characters and their storylines outside of traditional television viewing. The show's latest effort to reach viewers takes the cast and crew from their North Carolina set to the small town of Honey Grove, Texas. Everyone knows that a good mix of music is the key to any road trip's success. \"The Road Mix,\" the third soundtrack of \"ONE TREE HILL,\" will be released on Tuesday, April 3 on Warner Bros. Records.\n\nAn upcoming episode of \"ONE TREE HILL\" follows Lucas (Chad Michael Murray), Peyton (Hilarie Burton), Brooke (Sophia Bush), Nathan (James Lafferty) and Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) as they take a 20-hour road trip from the fictional town of Tree Hill, North Carolina, to the real town of Honey Grove, Texas, (pop. 1,746) to find their friend Mouth (Lee Norris). The episode airs on Wednesday, May 9 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET).\n\nIn December 2006, \"ONE TREE HILL\" producers launched a national contest that allowed viewers to submit videos about why the show should shoot an episode in their hometown. Loyal fans in Honey Grove won the opportunity to appear in an upcoming episode (May 9) of the series.\n\n\"When we decided to travel to Honey Grove, we knew we'd need a great road mix for the journey. This soundtrack is just that -- a representation of some of the best songs and artists we've featured on 'One Tree Hill,'\" says creator and executive producer Mark Schwahn. \"The show has a strong musical heritage, and this mix makes me proud.\"\n\nThe new \"ONE TREE HILL\" soundtrack CD, \"The Road Mix,\" will feature original tracks from Gym Class Heroes and Tyler Hilton, along with songs from The Wreckers, Dashboard Confessional, Lupe Fiasco, Band of Horses, The Honorary Title, Kooks, Jose Gonzalez, The Constantines, Iron & Wine/Calexico, Lucero, Songs: Ohia, The Weepies, La Rocca and Mother Love Bone.\n\nMusic has always played a fundamental role on \"ONE TREE HILL,\" both within the show and in real life. Music artists such as Gavin DeGraw (who sings the show's theme song \"I Don't Want To Be\"), Sheryl Crow, Jimmy Eat World, Lupe Fiasco, The Wreckers and Fall Out Boy have all appeared as themselves on the series, performing in one of the show's two fictional venues: Club Tric and Karen's Café. And in a case of art imitating life imitating art, two series characters embarked on a successful real-life multi-city tour in the summer of 2005 with Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Galeotti performing in support of the first soundtrack album. The second album, \"Friends with Benefits,\" was created to accompany a storyline dealing with breast cancer, with proceeds benefiting the National Breast Cancer Foundation.\n\n\"ONE TREE HILL\" airs Wednesday (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET on The CW). The series was created by Mark Schwahn and is executive produced by Schwahn, Mike Tollin, Brian Robbins and Joe Davola. \"ONE TREE HILL\" is a Tollin/Robbins Production in association with Warner Bros. Television.\n\nMar 28\n\nSECONDHAND SERENADE Named \"MTV Discover & Download Artist\"; Band Now Featured on Yahoo! \"Who's Next?\" and AOL \"Breakers\" Online Competitions\n\n\"Vulnerable\" Video to Air on Fuse TV's \"OVEN FRESH\" and Added to MTVU; SECONDHAND SERENADE Confirms \"2007 Couch Tour\" With Monty Are I\n\nIndie phenomenon SECONDHAND SERENADE -- who is acoustic singer/songwriter JOHN VESELY -- was named \"MTV Discover & Download Artist\" and the video for \"Vulnerable\" -- lensed by Frank Borin (Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Dani California\") -- will be airing on Fuse TV's \"OVEN FRESH\" next week. \"OVEN FRESH\" airs Monday through Friday at 7:00 AM Eastern Time and the audience will be able to vote for their favorite video online at http://fuse.tv/tv/ovenfresh/index.php.

Records Puts Singer on Map with Low-Cost Mobile-to-Web Viral Marketing Tool\n\nAshley Tisdale, the 21-year-old actress whose debut album for Warner Bros. Records bowed at #5 last month, has become the first performing artist to make the charts on her freshman outing with the aid of an Internet-enabled camera phone. The strategy hatched by the record label has turned Tisdale into a YouTube star and helped drive over 65,000 first week sales of her \"Headstrong\" CD. Ashley's first single, \"Be Good To Me\" is currently climbing the Top 40 radio chart, with Z100 (NYC) leading the pack.\n\nUsing a handset equipped with one-click image uploading technology from ShoZu Inc., Tisdale has created and posted dozens of personal behind-the-scenes videos that have generated more than 6.7 million YouTube views at an average of 225,000 views per clip. Her YouTube channel has ranked #4 in the music category for months and is the #5 most-viewed of all channels this month.\n\nTisdale has used the ShoZu phone to chronicle everything from dressing room interviews to a panic over losing her keys, scenes from the album release party, and a live performance of the song \"He Said She Said,\" all with a girl-next-door demeanor that has endeared her to legions of teenage fans. She has also documented her experiences on tour with \"High School Musical,\" the Disney production that began with a television movie in which she also had a role.\n\n\"Ashley understands the power of posting video directly from her phone and her ShoZu phone is a natural fit for her personality\" said Jeremy Welt, VP New Media, for Warner Bros. Records. \"While the original goal was to use ShoZu to deal with her busy schedule, her ShoZu video clips became one of the main ways we built anticipation for her solo debut.\"\n\n\"Anyone can use our image uploading service to share images from their mobile phones with a click, but Ashley Tisdale has proved that a superstar can use it to help build a career,\" said Jen Grenz, Global Partner Marketing Director for ShoZu. \"It's a new way to keep your fan base interested, and it provides two critical benefits -- intimacy and immediacy -- that fit right into today's culture of celebrity and 24x7 connectivity.\"\n\nTisdale is among of a group of artists that Warner Bros. Records has equipped with ShoZu-powered phones to enhance the use of the mobile channel in their street marketing efforts.\n\nShoZu's Share-It service enables users to upload photos and video clips captured on their camera phones with fewer clicks, at higher resolution and to more Web destinations than any other method.

Records is pleased to announce that it has signed the uniquely hip talent, J*DaVeY to an exclusive recording contract. After several opening gigs for Prince, J*DaVeY, the Los Angeles-based duo (Miss Jack Davey and Brook D'Leau) have returned to the studio to gear up for the eagerly awaited album, title TBD, slated for a 2007 release.\n\n\"It's simple, we are a post hip-hop electronic new wave funk punk jazz band,\" says Brook. Adding Jack, \"And we're glad that Warner Bros. Records had the vision and guts to follow through on two quirky kids who make unconventional pop hits.\"\n\nCombining Hip-Hop, Soul, and New Wave, Jack and D'Leau break typical music barriers by transforming themselves into Electro-Soul carriers of futuristic \"Funk-Punk\" sounds. Similar to their non-conformist influences, the \"urban Eurythmics\" believe that music takes on many forms, and there are no limitations of expression -- to create one's identity means drawing outside the lines.\n\n\"We are so proud and excited to be working with such a unique and talented artist. There is nothing on the WBR roster or for that matter on the planet that sounds like J*DaVeY,\" says VP of A&R, Craig Aaronson. Adds fellow A&R representative, Tick, \"When we saw J*DaVeY live we knew it was special. The group crosses all genres and knows no boundaries. From their influences to their material, a guy named Brook and a girl named Jack would start a party we all haven't been to in a long time.\"\n\nAnd to their success, J*DaVeY's music has been licensed for episodes on the popular television drama \"CSI: New York,\" Snoop Dogg's latest film \"Bossin' Up,\" and the HBO series, \"Entourage.\" Their demo songs, which were first leaked in cyber-space, are being played on radio stations in The States, as well as overseas by way of popular and award-winning radio personalities Gilles Peterson, Benji B, and Berry King.\n\nThe launch of their website has provided the group with a supportive fanbase, averaging 100,000 hits per month. And with no full album to date, the group has already received coverage in major music publications such as The Fader (May/June '05), URB Magazine (March '06), Xlr8r (March '06), YRB (January '07) and the COVER of BPM Magazine (January '07).

John Wayne first worked in the film business as a laborer on the Fox lot during summer vacations from U.S.C., which he attended on a football scholarship. He met and was befriended by John Ford, a young director who was beginning to make a name for himself in action films, comedies and dramas. It was Ford who recommended Wayne to director Raoul Walsh for the male lead in the 1930 epic Western The Big Trail, and, although it was a box office failure, the movie showed Wayne's potential.\n\nFor the next nine years, Wayne worked in a multitude of B-Westerns and serials in between bit parts in larger features. Wayne's big break came in 1939, when Ford cast him as the Ringo Kid in the adventure Stagecoach. Wayne nearly stole the picture from his more seasoned co-stars, and his career as a box-office superstar began. During his 50 year film career, Wayne played the lead in 142 movies, an as yet unsurpassed record, and was nominated for three Academy Awards(R), winning the Best Actor award in 1970 for his performance in True Grit.\n\nThe Films\n\nTrue Grit: Special Collector's Edition (PHE)\n\nThis classic cinematic masterpiece features Wayne in a larger-than-life performance as the drunken, uncouth and totally fearless one-eyed U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn. The role won him his only Academy Award(R) for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the age of 63 after 40 years of making films, and Wayne himself said that it was \"my first chance to play a character role instead of John Wayne.\" Called \"one of the most delightful, joyous and scary movies of all time\" (Roger Ebert), True Grit is a glorious adventure and American odyssey lead by Wayne, whose screen presence fully embodies his status as a star and legend. Directed by prolific filmmaker Henry Hathaway, the film also features enchanting performances by Kim Darby, Glen Campbell, Robert Duvall and Strother Martin.\n\nBonus features:\n\n-- Commentary by Jeb Rosebrook, Bob Boze Bell and J. Stuart Rosebrook\n\n-- True Writing\n\n-- Working with the Duke\n\n-- Aspen Gold: Locations of True Grit\n\n-- The Law and the Lawless\n\n-- Theatrical trailer\n\nRio Bravo: Special Edition and Ultimate Collector's Edition (WHV)\n\nDirector Howard Hawks lifted the Western to new heights with Red River. He does it here again, capturing the legendary West with a stellar cast in peak form. Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance, a small-town lawman enlisting the help of a ragtag team to hold a murderer in jail until the state marshal can arrive. On one side is an army of gunmen dead-set on springing the murderous cohort from jail. On the other are Chance and his two deputies: one a recovering drunkard (Dean Martin), the other a crippled codger (Walter Brennan). Also in their ranks are an unseasoned, trigger-happy youth (Ricky Nelson) and a woman with a past (Angie Dickinson) - and her eye on Chance. Rio Bravo will feature a new digital transfer from restored picture and audio elements.\n\nDVD Special Features:\n\nDisc One\n\n-- Remastered feature film\n\n-- Commentary by John Carpenter and Richard Schickel (Renowned director Carpenter and film critic Schickel explore how this legendary Western was an extension of Hawks' own personality and why it's considered such an influential classic today)\n\n-- Wayne trailer gallery\n\nDisc Two -0-\n\n-- The Men Who Made the Movies: Howard Hawks (1973 documentary) -- Two All New Featurettes: -- Commemoration: Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo -- Old Tucson: Where the Legends Walked\n\nUltimate Collector's Edition includes everything in the Rio Bravo Special Edition plus the following collectible memorabilia:\n\n-- Press book\n\n-- Dell comic book\n\n-- Lobby cards\n\nThe Cowboys: Deluxe Edition (WHV)\n\nThis deluxe edition has been newly restored and remastered, and features a new cast/director featurette. The Cowboys gave Wayne one of his juiciest roles as a leather-tough rancher who, deserted by his regular help, hires 11 greenhorn schoolboys for a cattle drive across 400 treacherous miles. When the dust settled, Wayne had given one of his best performances. \"In The Cowboys,\" Rex Reed wrote, \"all the forces that have made him a dominant personality as well as a major screen presence seem to combine. Old Dusty Britches can act.\" Co-starring the equally memorable Roscoe Lee Browne, Colleen Dewhurst and Bruce Dern, The Cowboys was directed by Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond).\n\nDVD Special Features:\n\n-- Commentary by Mark Rydell (Director Rydell discusses how he helped his young, inexperienced cast work with screen legend Wayne)\n\n-- The Cowboys: Together Again\n\n-- The Breaking of Boys and the Making of Men\n\n-- Theatrical Trailer\n\nAllegheny Uprising (WHV)\n\nOnly months after his Stagecoach breakthrough, John Wayne brings his one-of-a-kind line readings and presence to the real-life role of colonial man of action James Smith. The place is Pennsylvania a decade before the American Revolution. Joined by like-minded frontiersmen, Smith intercepts trade shipments, besieges forts and risks the certain-death charge of treason against the king. Another Stagecoach alumna joins the Duke: Claire Trevor, playing a fiery barmaid eager to join the scrap against the redcoats.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- The Bill of Rights (1939 WB short)\n\n-- Land of the Midnight Fun (1939 WB cartoon)\n\nBig Jim McLain (WHV)\n\nAll 6'4\" of John Wayne plays the title role, a federal agent ferreting out subversives in Hawaii. Rallying to the cause are co-stars Nancy Olsen and Veda Ann Borg. And 6'7\" James Arness (whom Wayne would later recommend to star on TV's \"Gunsmoke\") is McLain's war-hero partner, Baxter. The documentary-style story moves swiftly, with good-natured humor peppered throughout. Pre-statehood Hawaii locales range from elite resorts to a Shinto temple and from the sunken remains of the battleship Arizona to a Molokai leper colony.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- So You Want to Enjoy Life (1952 WB short)\n\n-- The Super Snooper (1952 WB cartoon)\n\n-- Theatrical Trailer\n\nReunion in France (WHV)\n\nJohn Wayne is in straight-up heroic mode as a fugitive RAF pilot on the run from the Gestapo, and Joan Crawford (in haute couture despite the war) is Michele, the spoiled, high-society Parisian who discovers her own patriotism as she helps the airman escape his Nazi pursuers. This glossy, briskly paced thriller also stars Philip Dorn as Michele's fiance, an industrialist she suspects of collaborating with the Germans.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- We Do It Because (1942 MGM short)\n\n-- War Dogs (1943 MGM cartoon)\n\n-- Theatrical Trailer\n\nTrouble Along The Way (WHV)\n\nThis sports comedy-drama is directed by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca). John Wayne tackles the role of Steve Williams, a former top football coach who has been banned from the major conferences for his inability to conform and is making ends meet as a bookie. When he receives a call from likable Father Burke (Charles Coburn) with an offer to establish a football program - fast - in a last-ditch effort to save his tiny St. Anthony's College from bankruptcy, Williams sees it as a way to prove to a Children's Court officer (Donna Reed) that he's a fit parent as he fights for custody of his 12 year old tomboy daughter. Of course, there's bound to be Trouble Along the Way.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- So You Think You Can't Sleep (1953 WB short)\n\n-- Muscle Tussle (1953 WB cartoon)\n\n-- Theatrical trailer\n\nTycoon (WHV)\n\nA tumultuous love story (with co-star Laraine Day), a dynamite supporting cast, horizon-spanning location filming and brilliant Technicolor make Tycoon exciting entertainment. But the biggest thrill is watching Wayne as a bold, bare-knuckled railroad honcho high above an Andean gorge in a breathless grand finale that involves a half-built bridge, an onrushing wall of water, and a locomotive with the Duke at the controls.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- Hollywood Wonderland (1947 WB short)\n\n-- Red Hot Rangers (1947 MGM cartoon)\n\nWithout Reservations (WHV)\n\nClaudette Colbert and Wayne are a double delight in this playful, romantic comedy. Colbert plays Kit Madden, a novelist who's heading to Hollywood to turn her bestseller about a handsome pilot into a film. On the train she meets a real-life marine pilot (John Wayne) and thinks he's the perfect man to portray her screen hero... except he thinks the whole thing is \"a lot of hooey.\" Their comedic rapport becomes more captivating with one misadventure after another as they make their way cross-country. Adding to the fun are surprise walk-ons from stars like Jack Benny, Cary Grant, Louella Parsons playing herself, and director Warner LeRoy.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n-- I Love My Husband, But!

We're confident we can develop and identify some exciting and unique new licensing opportunities for these well-known game compositions.\"\n\n\"We have developed a large library of video game music and are excited to make it available for placement beyond games,\" said Ed Ventura, Senior Director of the Franchise Development Group in the Interactive Entertainment Division. \"By partnering with Warner/Chappell, we can continue to extend the value and experiences for our music and also inspire and give further recognition to the composers who are dedicated to working on video games.\"\n\nAbout Warner/Chappell Music\n\nWarner/Chappell Music is WMG's award-winning global music publishing company.

The second film, \"Planet Terror,\" was directed by Robert Rodriguez. In between the two features, trailers advertising fake films, directed by Eli Roth and Rob Zombie, among others, will be shown.\n\n\"Death Proof\" follows Austin's hottest DJ, Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) as she sets out into the night to unwind with her two friends Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito). Covertly tracking their moves is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a scarred rebel leering from behind the wheel of his muscle car, revving just feet away.\n\nThe soundtrack includes classic songs from the '60s and '70s, such as \"Jeepster\" from British glam rock band T Rex, \"Staggolee\" from San Francisco blues band Pacific Gas & Electric, \"Down In Mexico\" from doo-wop legends The Coasters, and \"Good Love, Bad Love\" by Stax R&B legend Eddie Floyd. It also features a haunting composition, entitled \"Paranoia Prima,\" from legendary Italian film score composer Ennio Morricone. The songs are interspersed with dialogue voiced by the actors including Russell, Rose McGowan, Eli Roth, and Michael Bacall.\n\nThe music perfectly captures the feel of the exploitation films that became popular in American cinema in the late '60s and '70s. With their explicit sex and excessive violence and gore, the films were mainly shown in inner-city theaters, called \"grindhouses,\" usually as back-to-back double features. \"I grew up watching those type of movies and I loved them,\" Tarantino says in \"Grindhouse: The Sleaze-Filled Saga of An Exploitation Double Feature.\" \"The whole grindhouse experience, where you would see two horror films in these low ghetto theaters. Robert and I had the idea to actually do this film that is closer to a grindhouse ride and recreates the experience in one movie and in the best possible version ever presented.\"\n\nTo watch teaser trailers and get more information about \"Grindhouse,\" please visit www.grindhousemovie.net.\n\nThe track-listing for the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's \"Death Proof\" is as follows:\n\n\"The Last Race\" -- Jack Nitzsche\n\n\"Baby, It's You\" -- Smith\n\n\"Paranoia Prima\" -- Ennio Morricone\n\n\"Planning & Scheming\" -- Eli Roth & Michael Bacall\n\n\"Jeepster\" -- T Rex\n\n\"Stuntman Mike\" -- Rose McGowan & Kurt Russell\n\n\"Staggolee\" -- Pacific Gas & Electric\n\n\"The Love You Save (May Be Your Own)\" -- Joe Tex\n\n\"Good Love, Bad Love\" -- Eddie Floyd\n\n\"Down In Mexico\" -- The Coasters\n\n\"Hold Tight\" -- Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich\n\n\"Sally and Jack (From the Motion Picture \"Blow Out\")\" -- Pino Donaggio\n\n\"It's So Easy\" -- Willy DeVille\n\n\"Whatever-However\" -- Tracie Thoms & Zoe Bell\n\n\"Riot In Thunder Alley\" -- Eddie Beram\n\n\"Chick Habit\" -- April March\n\nFeb 22\n\nWarner/Chappell Music Signs Worldwide Publishing Agreements With Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars\n\nWarner/Chappell Music, the publishing arm of Warner Music Group Corp.
