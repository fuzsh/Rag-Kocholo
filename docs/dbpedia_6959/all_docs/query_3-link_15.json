        "text": "In this post we will discuss what a music distributor is, what they actually do for you, and how they make money. We then breakdown the different types of distribution available and review the distribution companies available to you. And finally give you some real world examples of the distribution deals we have done.\n\nYour distributor makes up an essential part of your record label setup so itâ€™s important to spend enough time reviewing and choosing the different options available to you.\n\nAri Herstand has written a great article about the different types and it's worth checking out, however it's always smart to get a second opinion ðŸ™‚\n\nHaving access to all these reviews can be overwhelming, which is why we created a handy 'distribution picker' tool to help you decide which is best for you after answering a series of questions.\n\nFind the best distributor now\n\nFirst of all â€“ what is a distributor and what is distribution?\n\nIn a nutshell, music distribution is taking your final mastered song and artwork files and ingesting them into a system that then distributes them to all of the music stores; Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, Google, Deezer, where the music is downloaded or streamed by music fans.\n\nThe distributor then collect the music royalties from all of these stores as well as sales reports and sends these to you every month. There is an approximate delay of about 3 months from when a sale or stream is made to when you receive the sales reports and royalty money.\n\nThis whole system is the distribution process.\n\nAs each store requires different formats for content delivery and different software for reporting sales, distributors have often developed software systems to automate the process and this is what usually sets them apart from each other.\n\nEvery record label has a distributor of some sort that they work with, as you can't simply upload your music directly to Amazon, iTunes, or Google play. Spotify is trialing artists directly uploading to the platform, but only with select artists and itâ€™s not public yet. (as of this post date)\n\nIt is important to note that a distributor is not a record label and does not own your music or copyrights. They may offer â€˜label servicesâ€™ but that does not mean it's a label deal. They provide a service and take a fee or percentage from your revenue for doing so.\n\nHow do distributors make money?\n\nDistributors make money in one of two ways. They either charge a fee for uploading and distributing each release to the stores, or they take a commission on your music revenue. Typically the larger and more established distributors that have bigger labels and artists as clients will use the commission model. Some will also offer a combination of the two, and others will offer extra services such as marketing or specialists store uploads.\n\nSome distributors offer deals where they manufacture actual products and distribute these to the physical music stores (that still exist!). Triple V in the Netherlands is a good example of this. If they believe a track has enough of a buzz they will press up 500-1000 copies of vinyl and distribute these to stores around the world. The margins are so low that the cost of manufacturing pretty much covers the profits, so you may only get a bit of pocket change, but it is nice to have your music pressed on vinyl â€“ and looks cool hanging on your wall.\n\nBut let's concentrate on digital distribution, as that's where 99% of your sales will come from. Once established you can always look into someone that will do your vinyl, or you can do it yourself. (More on that later...)\n\nDifferences between Aggregators, Service Distributors, and Self-Distribution\n\nI'm going to briefly talk about the differences between the main types of distribution companies.\n\nAggregators\n\nAn aggregator amasses hundreds of digital platforms under one roof and is the largest of digital music distributors. The Orchard is a good example of an aggregator. They have direct links to the major online music stores database and back-end systems like iTunes, Amazon and Spotify and provide quality control for the stores.\n\nOften smaller distributors will actually plug into these bigger aggregators as well and use them on the back-end to handle digital distribution of their own content.\n\nServiced Distribution Companies\n\nSome distributors offer other extras that help with running a label, especially in the electronic world. They offer DJ emailing services for promo, built-in accounting, and the good ones will be there to answer any questions you have when youâ€™re confused or there is an issue with a release in a store.\n\nThese types of distributors offer what they call 'label services' or 'label management' where for a higher commission they can do all the admin â€˜heavy liftingâ€™ for you. Examples of these are Believe Digital, Ingrooves, and AWAL, and they all have worldwide offices in the UK and the US along with marketing teams inside the company that can help with promoting your bigger releases, or albums. They often work with very established and older acts that were signed to a major label in the past and now want to release their own music with a team around them.\n\nThese serviced distributors will have an application process so this is where having your business plan comes in handy. When you apply you will give them your business plan along with what your first 3 releases will be, and how you will do promotion etc.\n\nOften after you have achieved some success as a self-distributed label, these companies will reach out to you, as they will recognize the value in your catalogue.\n\nAll service distributors take a % of your sales and typically this will be anything from 15-30%. Usually it's toward the higher end if youâ€™re starting out, and once your sales get higher they normally lower the %. Another bonus is that they donâ€™t change upfront fees.\n\nBear in mind that while they take a % of the sales this means it is in their interest for your music to do well as the more sales you make the more money they also make. Contrast this with a self-distribution service that charges an upfront fee, but has no financial interest in your music selling well.\n\nIf you are going to be predominantly an electronic record label then there are specialist distribution companies that focus on electronic music and have a good relationship with Beatport and can help you get a label account there. The major players to consider are FUGA, Label Engine, Label-Worx, and Symphonic.\n\nSelf-Distribution Companies\n\nWith self-distribution, you get a very simple no-frills distribution service and they wonâ€™t provide any marketing support or extra accounting or promotion services, and they usually charge a flat fee to distribute your music.\n\nWhile they do charge an upfront fee there is usually a very low or no commission % taken from your royalties. Companies such as DistroKid, CD Baby, and Tunecore are examples of this type of distributor.\n\nThere is usually no application process to use this type of distribution. As long as your material is inoffensive, you can upload any music and artwork and have it distributed on 95% of the digital stores.\n\nThese are great options when starting out due to the low cost of distribution. While they offer very limited support this won't be an issue, as you will have the support of The Label Machine to guide you through the releases.\n\nThese companies are also usually focused on individual artists that want to sell their own music directly without a major record label. When you create a release on a distribution platform you have to list a record label, at which point an artist without a record label lists themselves as the record label, for example Jonny Rotten Records. This is why even if you choose to sell only your own music, to do this successfully you still need to build a structure around you.\n\nThe structure you would build is essentially what a record label is.\n\nToo much information - just tell me who to go with already!\n\nUnfortunately there is no ultimate distributor to choose as it depends on your label goals and current situation but as mentioned earlier we have created a distribution picker tool that will narrow it down for you to find the best option.\n\nFind the best distributor now\n\nBelow is a list of all the major distributors available to indie record labels.

They have an extensive vinyl distribution network and can offer P&D deals for labels that get good traction.\n\nElectronic music focused\n\n5-15% commission of royalties\n\nOffers vinyl manufacturing and distribution\n\nDistributes to Beatport\n\nStrict application only\n\nHas mastering solutions in-house\n\nReal World Examples\n\nSo, letâ€™s head to storytelling time so you can hear some real world examples of my experiences with the different options, and how they panned out.\n\nWhen I started my first record label we had a solid first release, and via some connections in the music world, we managed to get a Beatport Label account. That was the important one for us back in 2010. Now, we still had to get distribution to the other platforms - iTunes, Spotify, Amazon.\n\nAfter researching the options available I went with Tunecore. It was $50 a year for a release (you could buy up to 3 years for an extra $30) and we kept 100% of the royalties. Now $50 / year per release might sound like it will get expensive when you are up to 20 releases in a year ($1000+).\n\nHowever, consider this; we had a couple of tracks that were making about $80,000 a year when they peaked. Had we been with a distributor - 15% on $80,000 is $12,000. Suddenly that $1000 a year didn't seem so much!\n\nWhen we started getting a bit of a name the distribution offers came knocking, and we met with bunch of companies but ultimately they couldn't really offer us much. The rate we were on with Tunecore effectively worked out at 2%, and the lowest any distribution company went to was 15% so we stayed with Tunecore and our direct deal with Beatport.\n\nHowever, after 4 years with Tunecore we moved to Label Engine. Why? When we started out I did all the royalty accounting on spreadsheets. After the 10th release it was getting very tricky balancing everything out. Especially as in the electronic world you have remixes splits on EPs and tracks and maintaining this is a lot of hard work. We then discovered DJ Lazy Rich's platform Label Engine â€“ which basically handled all the accounting for you. You upload the sales sheets, create a template for how the release sales were divided up between label, artist and remixes, and every 6 months it would tell us who was owed what, and really helpfully would even send statements to the artists if requested.\n\nSo we moved to this system, then after a few years the Label Engine also started to support distribution and after a long courtship in which they ended up giving us a very favourable distribution deal we decided to move all of our distribution to one place.\n\nWhen we started the next couple of record labels we decided to go with more traditional bigger indie distribution companies. We chose Ingrooves for the second record label and Believe Digital for the third record label. The idea was to see how each of them worked and if the 15% they took make a difference.\n\nAdvantages of using a distributor like this is that you will have a label representative that oversees your label and you can contact to answer any questions or problems that may arise with your releases or distribution. They also offered a lot of extra services as mentioned earlier which was great when starting a new label.\n\nThe label representative will usually have an internal team that talk to the major platform stores, for example Beatport, and they will submit your press releases directly to them, which can increase your chance of being featured in playlists and genre banners.\n\nAnother label we started, we went with Triple V in Netherlands. These guys gave us a very favourable percentage on the distribution fee as well as offering a P&D deal for vinyl manufacturing. They also handle the distribution for a lot of the top drum and bass labels and as Get Hype Records was going to be a predominantly drum and bass label it made sense to go with them.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nA great strategy I would suggest is to go for self-distribution via Distrokid and then as you build up your catalogue, approach one of the more specialist distributors such as InGrooves that offer extra services for a percentage of revenue. Backed with a solid business plan, and evidence of successfully releasing music you will have an easier time having a successful application.\n\nIf you are releasing electronic music and getting on the Beatport charts is important to you then apply to Label-Engine or Label Worx with a solid business plan, which includes your first three releases planned."
