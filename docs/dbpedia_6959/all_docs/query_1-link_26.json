        "text": "FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of June 29, 2020 (this Supplemental Indenture), among WMG Acquisition Corp. (together with its successors and assigns, the Company), as issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Indenture referred to below (the Subsidiary Guarantors), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee.\n\nW I T N E S S E T H:\n\nWHEREAS, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee, the Notes Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent are party to the Indenture, dated as of June 29, 2020 (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time, the Indenture), which provides for the issuance from time to time of Notes by the Company;\n\nWHEREAS, Section 9.01(8) of the Indenture provides that the Company may provide for the issuance of Initial Dollar Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture as of the Closing Date;\n\nWHEREAS, in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Dollar Notes (as defined herein), the Company has duly authorized the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture to establish the forms and terms of the 2030 Dollar Notes as hereinafter described; and\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the parties hereto are authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture to amend the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the benefit of the Holders as follows:\n\n1. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.\n\n2. Title of Notes. There shall be a series of Notes of the Company designated the 3.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Dollar Notes), which Notes shall be Dollar denominated.\n\n3. Maturity Date. The Maturity Date of the 2030 Dollar Notes shall be July 15, 2030.\n\n4. Interest and Interest Rates. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of 2030 Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.875% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 in each year, commencing on January 15,\n\n2\n\n2021, to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1, respectively (each such January 1 and July 1, a Record Date). Interest on the 2030 Dollar Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from June 29, 2020, except that interest on any Additional 2030 Dollar Notes (as defined below) issued on or after the first Interest Payment Date (and Exchange Notes issued in exchange therefor) will accrue (or will be deemed to have accrued) from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from June 29, 2020 (or if the date of issuance of such Additional 2030 Dollar Notes is an Interest Payment Date, from such date of issuance); provided that if any 2030 Dollar Note and any Exchange Notes issued in exchange therefor are surrendered for exchange on or after a record date for an Interest Payment Date that will occur on or after the date of such exchange, interest on such Note received in exchange thereof will accrue from such Interest Payment Date.\n\n5. No Limitation on Aggregate Principal Amount. The aggregate principal amount of 2030 Dollar Notes that may be authenticated and delivered and outstanding under the Indenture is not limited. The aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Dollar Notes shall initially be $535 million. The Company may from time to time, without the consent of the Holders, create and issue Additional Notes having the same terms and conditions as the 2030 Dollar Notes in all respects or in all respects except for issue date, issue price and, if applicable, the first date on which interest accrues and the first payment of interest thereon. Additional Notes issued in this manner will be consolidated with, and will form a single series with, the 2030 Dollar Notes (any such Additional Notes, Additional 2030 Dollar Notes), unless otherwise specified for Additional Notes in an applicable Notes Supplemental Indenture, or otherwise designated by the Company, as contemplated by Section 2.01 of the Indenture.\n\n6. Redemption. (a) The 2030 Dollar Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 15, 2025, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Dollar Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the applicable Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\n\nApplicable Premium means, with respect to any 2030 Dollar Note on any applicable Redemption Date, the greater of:\n\n(1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of such 2030 Dollar Note; and\n\n(2) the excess, if any, of:\n\n(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 2030 Dollar Note at July 15, 2025 (such redemption price being set forth in the table appearing in Section 6(b)) plus (ii) all required\n\n3\n\nremaining scheduled interest payments due on the 2030 Dollar Note through July 15, 2025 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to such redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such redemption date plus 75.0 basis points; over\n\n(b) the then outstanding principal amount of the 2030 Dollar Note.\n\nTreasury Rate means, as of the applicable redemption date, the yield to maturity as of such redemption date of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two business days prior to such redemption date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from such redemption date to July 15, 2025; provided, that if the Treasury Rate determined in accordance with the foregoing shall be less than zero, the Treasury Rate shall be deemed to be zero for all purposes of the Indenture.\n\n(b) On or after July 15, 2025, the Company may redeem all or a part of the 2030 Dollar Notes, at its option, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the 2030 Dollar Notes to be redeemed to the applicable Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below:\n\nYear Percentage\n\n2025\n\n101.938%\n\n2026\n\n101.292%\n\n2027\n\n100.646%\n\n2028 and thereafter\n\n100.000%\n\n(c) At any time prior to July 15, 2023, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 2030 Dollar Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any Additional 2030 Dollar Notes) issued under the Indenture, at its option, at a redemption price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount of the 2030 Dollar Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant Record Date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (each, a Note Equity Offering Redemption), with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Company or any contribution to the Companys common equity capital made with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings by the Companys direct or indirect parent; provided that:\n\n(i) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of 2030 Dollar Notes originally issued under the Indenture (including the aggregate principal amount of any Additional 2030 Dollar Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of\n\n4\n\nsuch redemption (unless all such 2030 Dollar Notes are otherwise repurchased or redeemed substantially concurrently with the corresponding Note Equity Offering Redemption); and\n\n(ii) notice of such redemption is given no more than 180 days after the date of, and may be conditioned upon, the closing of such Equity Offering.\n\n(d) In addition, during any twelve-month period prior to July 15, 2025, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Dollar Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional 2030 Dollar Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date).\n\n(e) The Company may acquire 2030 Dollar Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.\n\n(f) Any redemption or notice of any redemption may, at the Companys discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering, other offering or other corporate transactions or event. Notice of any redemption in respect of an Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.\n\n7. [Reserved].\n\n8. Form. The 2030 Dollar Notes shall be issued substantially in the form set forth, or referenced, in Article Two of the Indenture, and Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit C-1 attached to the Indenture, in each case as provided for in Section 2.02 of the Indenture (as such form may be modified in accordance with Section 2.01 of the Indenture).\n\n9. Governing Law. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.\n\n10. Ratification of Indenture; Supplemental Indentures Part of Indenture. Except as expressly amended hereby, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed and all the terms, conditions and provisions thereof shall remain in full force and effect. This Supplemental Indenture shall form a part of the Indenture for all purposes, and every Holder heretofore or hereafter authenticated and delivered shall be bound hereby.
