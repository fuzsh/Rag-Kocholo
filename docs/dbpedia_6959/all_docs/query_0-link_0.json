        "text": "American independent record label\n\nRecord label\n\nFerret Music was an American independent record label turned Warner Music Group subsidiary, founded in 1996. The label is owned by metalcore band NORA's vocalist, Carl Severson, and based in West Windsor, New Jersey.[1] Ferret recently started an imprint called New Weathermen Records. Warner Music Group's Alternative Distribution Alliance acquired a stake in Ferret Music in August, 2006,[2] and as a result is currently distributed by Fontana Distribution, Alternative Distribution Alliance and eOne Music.\n\nAs of September 12, 2007, Ferret partnered with an uprising extreme metal and hardcore punk label out of the UK, Siege of Amida Records (S.O.A.R.). S.O.A.R will retain A&R responsibilities. On February 18, 2010 Carl Severson and his business partner at Ferret and ChannelZERO, Paul Conroy, announced their departure from the company to start Good Fight Entertainment, a management company with music and sports divisions along with a new record label.[3] Ferret's official website was last updated in 2009, adding to speculation that the label is defunct. According to Scott Mellinger, lead guitarist for Zao, Ferret Records sold to Warner Music while Severson went on to start Good Fight.[4]\n\nPast artists\n\n[edit]\n\n36 Crazyfists (active, on Spinefarm Records)\n\nA Life Once Lost (disbanded)\n\nA Static Lullaby (active, unsigned)\n\nAll Chrome (disbanded)\n\nAnnotations of an Autopsy (active, unsigned)\n\nBlood Has Been Shed (disbanded)\n\nBoris The Blade (disbanded)\n\nBoys Night Out (active, with Good Fight Music)\n\nBurnt by the Sun (disbanded)\n\nblessthefall (active, on Rise Records)\n\nCataract (disbanded)\n\nChimaira (active)\n\nDead Hearts (disbanded)\n\nDisembodied (active, on Good Fight Music)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (active, on Solid State Records)\n\nElysia (disbanded)\n\nEternal Lord (disbanded)\n\nEvery Time I Die (disbanded)\n\nFor the Love of...
