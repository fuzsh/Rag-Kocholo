        "text": "When the COVID-19 pandemic hit new heights in March, the last thing on rapper CJ Fly’s mind was reaching fans at home via social media to promote his new album. “I was trying to figure out my way around quarantine and I had family members who were sick,” he says via Zoom. “I was dealing with life. It’s not easy for artists to do these things alone.”\n\nFortunately, he’s not alone: As a founding member of Brooklyn-based collective and independent record label Pro Era, CJ Fly also has at his disposal the resources of Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA), the independent music distribution arm of Warner Music Group. The partnership, dating back to April 2019, spawned from Joey Badass, CJ Fly’s fellow Pro Era founding member and a Mr. Robot cast regular, seeking out a “flexible and understanding” collaborator for the label. “We were at the growing stage, and ADA presented the best possible opportunity for us at the time,” Joey Badass says. “It’s even better when the partnership can manifest great individual relationships with the ADA's people, and that’s what it is for us.”\n\nFor ADA, working with Pro Era meant partnering with an independent label that has admirably established itself over the course of nearly a decade, but still had room to grow in terms of marketing, sync licensing, and more on a global scale. “ADA looks for partners that have their own point of view and a story to tell, with which we act as an amplifier,” says ADA President of A&R/Label Services Kenny Weagly. “Pro Era Records is synonymous with quality. While the individual artists each bring their own style, it’s a timeless hip-hop sound that they all have in common, rather than just reflecting current trends, which come and go. CJ and his album Rudebwoy are great examples of this.”\n\nSure enough, Rudebwoy, released in March, stands out among the 2020 hip-hop landscape with its blend of boom-bap and reggae/dancehall, an homage to both CJ Fly’s and hip-hop’s roots in Jamaica and New York City. (DJ Kool Herc, credited with helping originate hip-hop in the Bronx, was born in Kingston, Jamaica.) After taking a few years to create the autobiographical project, CJ Fly was excited for its release, and got help from ADA on a robust promotional strategy that included a short film series and a visit to “Sway in the Morning.” But the week he was scheduled to display his freestyle skills on the radio show’s famous “The 5 Fingers of Death” segment, the country began enforcing shelter-in-place orders to contain the spread of COVID-19. “It was the most devastating thing ever,” says CJ Fly, while still acknowledging positive reactions from fans. “I feel like people are very appreciative to have the music…so the fact that it’s healing during the pandemic is a blessing.”\n\nIt also helps that the creative minds at ADA are helping CJ Fly promote Rudebwoy in a way that references the album’s themes and reaches fans right at home. They developed the concept for “Rudebwoy Fridays,” CJ Fly’s weekly Instagram Live series launched last week, in which he adjusts to the new normal in different ways. In the forthcoming “Rudebwoy Riddims” episode, he’ll be freestyling over Jamaican dancehall instrumentals from his makeshift studio at home, and in “Rudebwoy Recipes,” he’ll hone his Caribbean culinary skills. He’ll have guests, too—in today’s episode, “Rudebwoy Wellness w/ Emilia,” he goes live with his girlfriend Emilia Ortiz, a spiritual advisor and mental health advocate, to do a deep dive on the impact of our current circumstances on mental health, coping techniques, and giving back to others. “I just want to be able to connect more with the people,” says CJ Fly. “That was the whole goal with this album.”\n\nIt’s a prime example of the synergy between ADA and its partners, utilizing the resources of the former to expound, and not infringe, upon the creative identity and goals of the latter. Pro Era has been adamant about this type of creative independence from the beginning. “To be honest, a lot of that was from being young and not understanding the business too much,” says CJ Fly. (He and his fellow founding members were in their teens when Pro Era formed.) “But it was a great decision. A lot of people end up signing deals with the wrong partner and losing creative control. But we have to protect the artistry.”\n\nWeagly shares that passion: “It is important for artists, managers, and independent labels to have access to the resources, relationships, and experience required to share their creative vision with a global audience. Utilizing ADA resources, they can maintain creative control, business control, and own their own masters, while having the tools to compete in today’s global landscape.”\n\nOne such tool is ADA’s foresight. The team developed a virtual performance by Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys on St. Patrick’s Day, before such acts had become the norm, and Macklemore and Anderson .Paak participated in Warner Music Group’s 72-hour PlayOn Fest in late April. “The current climate has allowed ADA to help partners find unique opportunities for fan engagement without the luxury of touring or content shot outside of the home,” says Weagly. “It has further spotlighted the need to help weave together social media strategy, an engaging content creation plan (even if that is now content shot at home), and great music to help connect artists and fans.”\n\nFor ADA and its partners, the pandemic isn’t a road block; rather, it’s a challenge to think outside of the box. “We are engaging in charitable opportunities in conjunction with our music and artists, and even working on some Guinness World Records opportunities utilizing fan engagement from home.” says Weagly. “Pandemic or not, our marketing, publicity, radio promotion, digital strategy, and sync licensing team members haven’t slowed up a bit.”"
