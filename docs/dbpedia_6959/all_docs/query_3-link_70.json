        "text": "There’s been a big change at Warner Music Group (WMG).\n\nCat Kreidich has been promoted to President of ADA Worldwide, WMG’s independent label and artist services arm, just months after joining the company from Sony Music.\n\nThe respected exec will now oversee a number operations at Warner that service the independent community including ADA, the Asylum label, and WMG’s in-house TuneCore rival, Level Music.\n\nKreidich will report to directly to Max Lousada, CEO, Warner Recorded Music.\n\nAs the new boss of ADA, Kreidich succeeds Eliah Seton, who we’re told has taken a new role outside of Warner Music Group after more than a decade with the company.\n\nThe exit of Seton from Warner is something of a shock: the New York-based exec has been one of the most influential senior executives at WMG ever since he joined the major in 2009 as Director of Business Development – a role which saw him directly involved in the process of the $3.3bn sale of WMG to Len Blavatnik‘s Access Industries in 2011.\n\nFrom that point to his most recent job at Warner – President of Independent Music & Creator Services – Seton has worked closely with WMG’s C-suite, including the firm’s CEO, Steve Cooper.\n\nBefore joining ADA in 2015, Seton – working with WMG’s ex-CEO of International, Stu Bergen – played a key role in driving WMG’s emerging markets strategy, including standout M&A moves in China and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn her new role, Cat Kreidich is promoted from her position as EVP of ADA, to which she was appointed at the end of last year.\n\nKreidich came to ADA from Sony Music. There she was SVP, Commerce for the major’s global catalog, leading commercial activity across digital and physical for the likes of Mariah Carey, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, and more.\n\n“In the short time since Cat’s return to ADA, she’s already inspired everyone with her passion and creativity, her deep devotion to the indie community, and her wide-ranging global expertise. She’s the ideal choice to lead ADA into the future.”\n\nMax Lousada, Warner Music Group\n\nPrior to that role, Kreidich spent nearly eight years at The Orchard as SVP of Account Management, Advertising, and Data Analysis. There, she led a global team which she re-organized and strategically positioned during a period of rapid global expansion. She also founded The Orchard’s Commercial Insights team.\n\nKreidich previously served in a variety of other roles in the industry, including stints at Ultra Records, Caroline Distribution, Virgin Records, and Motown Records.\n\nMax Lousada said: “At Warner, we’re strengthening how we serve original artists and entrepreneurs at every stage of career development. As part of that mission, ADA is a beacon of expertise and support for independent artists and independent labels around the world.\n\n“In the short time since Cat’s return to ADA, she’s already inspired everyone with her passion and creativity, her deep devotion to the indie community, and her wide-ranging global expertise. She’s the ideal choice to lead ADA into the future.”\n\nLousada continued: “I’d also like to say a massive thanks to Eliah for his commitment to the evolution of ADA into the world leader that it is today. Throughout his time at WMG, he’s helped guide the company through many transformational moments. He’s done an amazing job and he leaves with our deepest gratitude and support.”\n\n“Building on the great foundation and world-class teams that Eliah has put in place, I’m focused on leaning into our insights to find new and disruptive ways to magnify the visions of music-makers and creators across the globe.”\n\nCat Kreidich, ADA\n\nKreidich noted: “Championing the indie community is in my blood; it’s what has guided my career over the last two decades, and I’m honored to shape the future of this space with a powerhouse like ADA.\n\n“Building on the great foundation and world-class teams that Eliah has put in place, I’m focused on leaning into our insights to find new and disruptive ways to magnify the visions of music-makers and creators across the globe. I want to thank Max for this great opportunity.”\n\nSeton said: “Cat’s an absolute superstar. I’m so happy to welcome her into this critical role for WMG’s future, and I’ll be cheering her on as she takes the company to even greater heights.\n\n“It’s a bittersweet moment as I leave my Warner family, full of gratitude and pride in all that we’ve accomplished together, but I look forward to what’s ahead and sharing my next chapter with everyone very soon. I want to thank Len, Steve, and Max for the extraordinary opportunities they have afforded me.”\n\n“It’s a bittersweet moment as I leave my Warner family, full of gratitude and pride in all that we’ve accomplished together, but I look forward to what’s ahead and sharing my next chapter with everyone very soon.”\n\nEliah Seton\n\nIn recent months, ADA has expanded its global operations with ADA Latin (Latin America, Spain and Portugal) and ADA Asia (Greater China, Korea, and South East Asia).\n\nIt’s also inked strategic licensing deals with partners such as Malaysian indie label, KRU Music; fast-growing Punjabi aggregator, Sky Digital India; Africa’s largest indie hub, Africori; and the Arab world’s leading independent record label, Rotana Music.\n\nLast week, ADA announced an exclusive partnership with Billy Mann and Benton James, launching JV label icons+giants.Music Business Worldwide"
