        "text": "IPA | 6.9% | 63 IBU\n\nWe made up our minds, and we started brewing.\n\nWe mashed before the sun came up that day.\n\nAn exit to eternal summer slacking,\n\nBut what were we making without ever knowing the hop?\n\nAnyone can see the hop that we used here tastes like gold.\n\nAnd its 5 - 8 - 6\n\nAnd it’s definitely not old.\n\nWe got it from Yakima (Chief Hops)\n\nWe added the Simcoe\n\nA little Mosaic, we’re happier here today.\n\nWe could keep on with these lyrics that don’t make sense\n\nBut we’ll spare ourselves the embarrassment.\n\nPlease Enjoy. K, Thx, Bye.\n\nIPA | 6.6% | 65 IBU\n\nYeah, sure, some people would take this term as a backhanded compliment. But being your second beer, your next best option, has plenty of perks. First, there’s less pressure than being your first choice. Less expectations too. Especially if your first choice was a dud. That happens sometimes, and when it does - oof.. And also there’s no palette shock & adjusting the flavors in your mouth from something else (especially something weird) to drinking beer. So you move on to the next best option, and BOOM! SLAP! WOW! We take you by surprise with this reliable, consistent, perfectly fine IPA brewed with Citra, Chinook, Cascade Cryo, Columbus Cryo upon a base of 2-Row with a splash of crystal malt. You didn’t even know what was coming! And now your Next Best Option is also your favorite beer of the night. See? We got you."
