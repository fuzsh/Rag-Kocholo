        "text": "The 5 Types Of Record Deals For Musicians\n\nKnowing what the types of record deals are is very important as you're growing your music career.\n\nEver wondered - which record deal is most ideal for me as an independent artist?\n\nIt really seems like there are ENDLESS options when it comes to music sales...\n\nLike, what the heck is the difference between a production deal and a distribution deal, to begin with?\n\n(Note: it's larger than you may think by the way.)\n\nDo you make good music?\n\nBefore signing a record deal, make sure you do your research:\n\nHow a label pays independent artists\n\nHow to avoid a bad deal for all music artists\n\nWhy independent labels are better for small artists than major labels\n\nWhat to do if you don't have an entertainment lawyer\n\nHow to sell your music whether signed or not signed\n\nHow to record label pay artists\n\nLet's dig in, shall we? üî•\n\nBonus: Learn the do's and don'ts of how to get a record deal.\n\nRead THIS Before Signing A Record Deal.\n\nThis banner above (with the book) ‚òùÔ∏è is the BEST resource in the music biz.\n\nThis book is widely used in music schools around the world and was called \"the best how-to book of its kind\" by Music Connection.\n\nIt inspired thousands of people to stop waiting for their \"big break.\" and to claim success!\n\n(He's become a friend of mind too, cool guy. üòÜ)\n\nMastering social media\n\nMastering the art of merchandising\n\nEmbracing real connections with fans\n\nAnd just learning how to keep going\n\nIf you can't invest $25.00 into your brain - just quit your music career.\n\nThe information is working a thousand times over.\n\nFirstly, There Are Many Types Of Record Deals\n\nNot All Record Deals Are The Same.\n\nIn fact, almost every label offers many varieties of record deals. From Spinnin' Records to Internet Money, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense considering major labels have different genres of music.\n\nDifferent management styles fit the record labels individually - artists are signed for various reasons.\n\nTake note: the more difficult a music genre composition is to create, the more complex a record agreement contract will be.\n\nThis is because labels will have to offer more studio time, promotion agreements & marketing help to get it heard.\n\nCommercial tracks are much easier to sell.\n\nSales are awesome!\n\nFor example: If you make electronic music.\n\nMost EDM can be replicated on an iPhone with the Garageband app.\n\nIn this case, you'll be better with distribution deals using small indie labels rather than embarking on a huge production deal with a label.\n\nHowever, if you're in a rock band... Samples can't replicate the original guitar quality sadly.\n\nIn this case, a record label pays a lot of money just to get you the best audio recording equipment.\n\nThis is to produce the best-finished product imaginable!\n\nSummary: not all labels are equal, select accordingly.\n\n5 Types Of Record Deals For Music Artists\n\nThere's More Than One Type Of Different Deal That You Can Choose From.\n\nMajor label artists are not stupid - they know the danger of getting a record deal.\n\nDue to the added pressure to improve recording contracts, a new type of profit split deal must be made.\n\nThey can be, but are not limited to:\n\nProduction deals\n\nRecording deal\n\nDistribution deals\n\nPublishing deal\n\nDevelopment deal\n\nThe reason record labels offer so many different deals is that they generally own smaller record labels under them.\n\nA publishing deal is done with a publishing firm, which a label often owns.\n\nThere are many publishing deals you can make.\n\nUnderstanding Music Copyright\n\nBefore I hop into the wonders of how a record deal works, you must have a basic understanding of how music copyright works concerning a record company.\n\nPlease, get an entertainment lawyer by all means.\n\nSee, copyright law is extremely complex.\n\nYou can't be signing just any agreement contract that comes your way. Sign carefully.\n\nThere are two types of copyrights in the industry:\n\nMaster rights\n\nComposition rights\n\nTo break it down - the master right is the right to the completed record (the master refers to the final version of the track).\n\nThe composition rights are the rights to the song elements (lyrics melodies, vocals, etc.)\n\nIf you sign a huge label deal with a large advance, they will most likely own the master rights.\n\nThe trade-off for working with a huge record label is that can keep your composition rights (choose where to publish the song.)\n\nThrough this, you'll still be able to utilize your music to monetize in alternative methods when you sign with a label.\n\nRecord deal logistics can be complicated so make sure you read before you sign!\n\nHow To Navigate Music Law Without An Entertainment Lawyer\n\nOf Course, Not All Artists Have A Trusted Entertainment Lawyer To Go To.\n\nIn these cases, you'll need one to maintain creative control and fight to retain your master recordings!\n\nWhat if you're offered a hefty advance that may potentially be the best deal of all time...\n\nGetting advice from an entertainment lawyer before you sign is essential.\n\nIf you don't have an entertainment lawyer these are the steps you can take to protect yourself from crappy contracts:\n\nRead the fine print for every agreement before you sign\n\nRelease your album records via distribution deals using multiple publishing companies\n\nTake a few days before you sign any agreement or deals\n\nNegotiate for more control as an artist if a large advance opportunity comes\n\nCarefully scout for other potential expenses and fees\n\nShop for all deals offered before you sign (if you're large enough)\n\nThe most important thing is to act as your own entertainment lawyer.\n\nIf you're getting a hefty advance then it's important to seek out an official entertainment lawyer rather than fighting for your master recording single-handedly.\n\nThat said you should understand where your finished product is going to manage the contract agreement with most Finesse.\n\nDo you make good music?\n\nHow Does A Record Advance Work\n\nThe Conventional Record Deal Is Pretty Simple. (That Said I Still Want You To Get An Entertainment Lawyer!)\n\nI won't go deep into the breakdown of a record deal agreement contract.\n\nI don't want you to fall asleep reading this.\n\nThe most important thing to know is that a major label will give you a large advance on your future royalty earnings.\n\nThis means that you owe your record sales money back to the record label.\n\nAll recording contracts are different but the main premise is that the hefty advance means you won't own the master recordings nor have full creative control.\n\nA record deal advance is not all sunshine and rainbows though because in many cases the artist may need to pay for their own investments with the advance money.\n\nThis can range from:\n\nThe cost of making music videos\n\nThe cost of promotional materials\n\nThe cost to run release promotion\n\nIt can take a lot of money to make really good records, and not see any profit when you do end up selling them.\n\nBecause record labels on your masters, almost every major label artist makes their money through having concerts and selling merch.\n\nThis is attached to the major label artist's brand and not necessarily to the music itself.\n\nWhat Is A 360 Deal In The Music Industry?\n\nMost Artists Are Scared Of Working With Record Labels Simply Because Of 360 Record Deals.\n\nAnd trust me... You want to stay as far away from a 360 major label deal as you can.\n\nThis type of record deal is so notorious.\n\nWe've all heard horror stories of record companies taking advantage of new artists by setting them up with an extremely bad deal that compromises full control of their entire music business.\n\nWith a 360 major label deal, the pay structure is set up so the artist is practically an employee of the major label.\n\nIf you want to go touring or sell additional products to monetize an artist... The 360 deal will take a cut.\n\nThis sucks because merch and touring the number on the way a label artist could profit after paying back their big advance to the record label.\n\nThe record labels have their hands in every potential revenue stream.\n\nThe artist not only sacrifices the royalty rate but you will not be able to make as much from touring and merch sales.\n\nFortunately, record labels are moving away from 360 types of record deals.\n\nWhich Type Of Record Deal Is Best For You?\n\nDo You Want To Work With A Record Label At Some Point?\n\nMost rappers would dream of getting contacts with major labels!\n\nThere are many different types of record deals and depending on which record labels you want to work with you'll have to consider all the variable options.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that most major labels only reserve specific deals for artists that are already breaking out.\n\nThis means that only a few major label artists have access to major label services.\n\nAwww man!\n\nTo be a real music industry player you need to know which type of music label deal is best for you.\n\nNot only will this help you to optimize your music sales but I can help you set record contracts that are fair for both the record label as well as you.\n\nShould You Use An Indie Label As An Independent Artist?\n\nThe First Thing any Info That Artists Such As Yourself Should Consider Is. \"How About If I Use An Indie Label?\"\n\nIt's a smart idea to read about indie labels!\n\nThe majority of indie labels are not real record labels - they don't handle the marketing, or promotion, nor offer a big advance.\n\nInstead, they go to trusted Promotion firms such as Boost Collective for promotional materials.\n\nWhether you want a large advance is not important in most cases.\n\nThat said, the support you get from any labels is a lot smaller than you may think.\n\nThis makes sense because an indie label generally has a larger catalog of independent artists who work with them.\n\nIn other words, you may be better off just hiring an excellent music marketing firm such as Boost Collective rather than signing off your rights to small indie labels.\n\nIndie labels don't take large cuts though, which is nice.\n\nIt's usually between 5-10%\n\nStill, on an indie label, you're getting a profit split deal, meaning that you're still getting only a cut of your royalty rate rather than the complete money amount.\n\nThis is a cut from your composition rights, so you get to keep your masters though.\n\nNice!\n\nDistribution Deal Explained\n\nDistribution deals are one of the best methods for independent artists to get heard.\n\nThis is how NLE Choppa gets his music to his fans.\n\nIn other words, it's the best deal for artists since you don't sign off your rights in the agreement contract.\n\nA distribution deal is where the company just helps get it on major stores and puts in marketing efforts to get the best promotion.\n\nServices such as Boost Collective and alternative distribution alliance are designed to get to the best distribution deal.\n\nThis is different from a production deal where they actually help you create the song recording.\n\nIn a production deal scenario, they'll either offer a big advance or take a cut from the royalty rate in exchange for studio time and handling other expenses that deal with creating a final recording.\n\nRecording costs are not cheap which is why production deals are extremely attractive.\n\nMichael Jackson would use a production deal.\n\nThe most important thing is to sign a contract agreement for only a single record out of time.\n\nAvoid any contract agreement that binds you with a specific label for multiple projects or multiple years.\n\nArtist Development Deal Example\n\nA good example of an artist development deal is leveraging the Boost Collective platform.\n\nWhat they do is offer Free Promotion, Free Distribution, and Free Marketing for zero cost.\n\nHere, you work with them on a strategic partnership level, with mutual benefits and they do not take your ownership.\n\nThis is the future of music distribution, and an artist development deal like this is designed to put artists first and to put you in a position to grow as a musician.\n\nIn the past artist development deals were not that common and over time as things change are becoming more and more frequent and this will inevitably take over in the music industry...\n\nHow To Keep Recording Costs Low\n\nThe Largest Value The Label Can Provide Is Giving You Amazing Master Recordings.\n\nThe only issue is in return they expect to \"invest in you\"... In other words on your recording contract.\n\nThis way I urge you to stay independent, watch all music videos, and book your own time in the studio to record an album.\n\nYou can form an agreement with your studio engineer to have a payback plan if you don't have the funds for an entire album release.\n\nIf you can also coordinate with other artists to share equipment, you can cut many other expenses down.\n\nThis is why networking is key!\n\n(Of course, doesn't hurt if you have a trusted entertainment lawyer as well.)\n\nHow To Get The Most Revenue From Music Sales With A Record Label\n\nThe whole point of a record deal is to propel your music CAREER further.\n\nAlways consider that as an independent artist.\n\nThrough record labels, you most likely not get as many record sales as you think you will.\n\nThis is because the record labels pay you only a portion of Music sales rather than the full amount.\n\nYour best pay structure is to use the label as a publishing company and set up a distribution deal.\n\nJust keep in mind that this recording contract will not include marketing for your release as well if you are an indie artist.\n\nYou should get a single deal with an indie label such as Amuse:\n\nIt's not designed for your label artist however it's a great way for an independent artist to generate music sales through a distribution deal.\n\nI hope you now know the major types of record deals artists should sign!\n\nGet your music on playlists now.\n\nIt‚Äôs time you get your exposure and listeners up - playlisting by Boost Collective has been trusted by 50,000+ artists worldwide.\n\nIt‚Äôs easy: Search your song, get on playlists, and track your campaign.\n\nWhat‚Äôre you waiting for?
