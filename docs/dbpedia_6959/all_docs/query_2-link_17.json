        "text": "Jeffrey Holmes composes post-spectral, teleological music incorporating elements of mysticism and lyrical expression. His creative inspiration is rooted in primitive myths, transcendent legends, and dramatic elemental landscapes in their primal and violent natural states. Jeffrey Holmes’ music has been called “Captivating…haunting and slightly disorienting” by the Los Angeles Times, “Drifting…ethereal” by the San Francisco Classical Voice, and “Interesting and musically arresting, music to be really heard and deserving of reflection” by the Society of Composers, INC. His works have been performed at festivals including the Darmstadt Ferienkurs für Neue Musik (Germany), Los Angeles Philharmonic’s “Green Umbrella” (Los Angeles), Cap Ferret Music Festival (Cap Ferret, France), the HEAR NOW Festival of New Music (in both Paris, France, and Los Angeles, California), June in Buffalo (New York), the Etchings Festival (Maulin a Nef, Auvillar, France), the La Pietra Forum for Contemporary Music (Villa La Pietra, Florence, Italy), “Beyond: Microtonal Music Festival” (Pittsburgh), “Outside the Box” (Southern Illinois University Carbondale), the Festival en el Conservatorio de los Rosas (Morelia, Mexico), and at MicroFest and the “What’s Next?” festivals (Los Angeles). Jeffrey Holmes has received commissions, performances, and awards from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, Carnegie Hall, the American Composers Forum, ASCAP, the Jebediah Foundation New Music Commissions (JFNMC), the Talea Ensemble, the JACK Quartet, bass-baritone Nicholas Isherwood, the Firebird Ensemble, the Penderecki String Quartet, Ensemble Sound-Initiative (France), the East Coast Contemporary Ensemble (ECCE), Piano Spheres, the Lyris Quartet, FretX Duo (Dan Lippel and Mak Grgić), USC Thornton Symphony, Mark Menzies and the “Inauthentica” Chamber Orchestra, California Institute of the Arts Orchestra, Duo Resonances – France, the Eclipse String Quartet, Brightwork New Music Ensemble, Duo Amantis, the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet (LAGQ), the Los Angeles Percussion Quartet, and others. Jeffrey Holmes holds a doctorate in music composition from the University of Southern California, and has studied with composers Donald Crockett, Georg Friedrich Haas, Stephen Hartke, and Dusan Bogdanovic. Currently, he is Associate Professor of Composition at Chapman University, and has been on the faculty at the University of Southern California. His music is published by Edition Svitzer (Copenhagen, Denmark), Doberman-Yppan/Les Productions d’OZ (Quebec), and Theodore Front Musical Literature and J.W.
