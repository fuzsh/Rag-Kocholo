        "text": "Recording artists who endorse products or license music to advertisers used to be labeled sellouts; now they are entrepreneurs. The year 2004 will be the first in four that the music business has managed to increase American album sales. But sales are up about 2 percent, a meager showing over last year's weak figures. That places high pressure on artists to ferret out other sources of income. The stars-turned-marketers range from Britney Spears (television movie, fragrance) to Lil Jon (energy drink, adult film and soon an authorized Halloween costume). But few have out-hustled 50 Cent, the Queens-bred rap star who has been striking deals with the urgency recommended so starkly in the title of his debut CD, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'.\" Sources close to the artist say 50 Cent's forays into fashion, entertainment and even beverages in the last 12 months or so generated income in the $50 million range. Here's a rundown of his ventures. JEFF LEEDS\n\nFOOTWEAR -- As part of a five-year deal with Reebok International, 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, introduced two new shoe lines this year: the Gxt cross-trainer sneaker (about $90) and the G-Unit boot (about $110). His earnings from the deal are estimated at more than $20 million so far.\n\nRINGTONES -- 50 Cent struck a deal with the mobile-phone entertainment company Zingy Inc. to distribute voice ringtones, which sell for up to $2.99. A sample: \"Ay yo what's up, yo this is the kid, 50 Cent man. Stop playin', you better answer!\" The pact comes on top of the earnings he receives from selling ringtones of his songs.\n\nFILM -- Trailing one of his mentors, Eminem, 50 Cent will star in a semi-autobiographical film. He will play a street hustler who turns away from a life of crime to take a crack at the music business. The film, which is to be released by Paramount Pictures and MTV Films, is being directed by Jim Sheridan, who was co-writer and director of the critically acclaimed \"In America.\""
