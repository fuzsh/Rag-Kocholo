        "text": "This #WorldRadioDay, let's confront the stark reality of the persistent, decades-long oversight that has artists from GRAMMY-winning global icons to local emerging artists left uncompensated for U.S. radio airplay. It's a mistreatment that often takes people by surprise, and it's easy to understand why. It's in sharp contrast to both global norms and practices within other platforms in the United States. Across every other democracy, terrestrial radio compensates artists for their work. Similarly, the U.S. recognizes the value artists bring to streaming, satellite, and cable. Yet #BigRadio has benefited from hundreds of billions in advertising revenue generated over a century from the loophole that exempts them from paying artists for their music. This is all at the expense of those who created the music that drew in the listeners. Artists should be fairly compensated each and every time their recorded work is used. It's the right thing to do. It’s time that broadcasters share a fair portion of their earnings. The American Music Fairness Act is a pivotal opportunity to correct the longstanding oversight. Let's join together to ensure a fairer future. It's not just about music; it's about justice, equity, and the future of our industry. #MusicFairness #FairCompensation #IRespectMusic\n\nIn the music industry, too many artists are pigeonholed based on race, expected to fit certain stereotypes. This stifles creativity and limits opportunities, reducing our art to narrow, outdated narratives. It’s time to break these barriers. Our music should reflect who we truly are—not what the industry expects based on race. When we embrace diversity in its fullest form, we unlock the potential for groundbreaking sounds and genuine expression. To the industry: Recognize talent for its true value, free from racial biases. Let’s celebrate diversity and innovation by allowing artists to be authentic, not stereotyped. To fellow artists: Don’t let anyone box you in. Your voice is unique, and your story deserves to be told on your own terms. Together, we can push for a music industry that values authenticity over stereotypes. #BreakTheMold #DiversityInMusic #RacialEquality #AuthenticArtistry\n\nQuite relevant after Spotify announced that it would not pay artists until they hit an as yet unannounced threshold. The fact that artists who use Spotify still have to pay their monthly £10.99 subscription fee is incredulous and downright cheeky. \"Sorry, you need to have to have at least (for example) 1,000 streams to get paid the 30p that it generates. By the way, pay us our eleven quid subscription fee.\" Spotify says it's about being fairer to \"working artists\", but what does that even mean? I make my synthy music at home. I work very hard on it, but a) I don't make albums every day, since composition, article/novel writing and life take up a lot of my time), and b) I don't gig my one man in-the-box ambient music, for obvious reasons: it's hardly club-filling bangers to boogie to. Spotify also claim that this was to add quality control to the music in its catalogue. So, \"unpopular\" music is bad music? How naive do they think we are? We know EXACTLY how it works. Money talks. Mo' money, mo' curated playlist appearances. It's a nonsense, and how the industry is clawing back power from independent and working class artists. Great for Ed Sheeran, superstar, but not for Ed Smith, singer songwriter from Dagenham.
