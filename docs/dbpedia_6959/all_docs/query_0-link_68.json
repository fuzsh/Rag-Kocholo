        "text": "Ice Nine Kills, with band members from Swampscott and Marblehead, has just signed with a prominent indie label in the metal and hardcore music scene called Ferret Music.\n\nFerret and Red Blue Records will jointly release an upcoming album from the band in the fall, says band member Spencer Charnas of Swampscott. Marbleheader Jeremy Schwartz is also in the band which will perform live at the Comcast Center in Mansfield on July 21.\n\nWith Alternative Press’s stamp of approval, a fanatical online following (consistently landing the band in the top 10 on both the MySpace and PureVolume charts, and a newly formed partnership with the The Artery Foundation (A Day to Remember, The Devil Wears Prada), Ice Nine Kills “hopes to do some serious damage in 2009,” Charnas says.\n\nIn the past year, the band has embarked on four full U.S. tours as well as opening for such notables as Thursday, Bring Me The Horizon, Bury Your Dead, Drop Dead, Gorgeous and Paramore.\n\nThey will also be having a run on the Warped Tour this summer.\n\n“We are very honored to have Ferret behind our band now,” says guitarist/vocalist Charnes. “Not only do they have a strong track record for success, they have also released records by bands that have had a major influence on our music. Ferret joining forces with Red Blue, a label that we love and whose work ethic is unmatched, is going to be a very strong combination.”\n\nThe band will enter the recording studio with Tom from “A Day To Remember” before the Warped Tour dates.\n\nOriginally a guitarist of Gone Baby Gone, Michael David Allen David Krilivsky started Red Blue Records on May 31st 2006 as a label to cater toward hard-working artists that live and die by their music. Come June, Red Blue Records will have had 18 releases, and six active artists including Ice Nine Kills, Death In The Park, Phone Calls From Home, The Venetia Fair, Remember Tomorrow and Sound We Sleep.\n\nThe label also helped alumni band The Invite sign to Atlantic Records and Gone Baby Gone sign to Inyaface Records (Set Your Goals's Japanese record label).\n\nSpeaking on the joint venture, Krilivsky said “After Ice Nine Kills excelled with an opening spot on the One Moment Tour, I contacted Carl (Ferret Music) about going to lunch. He took me to discuss strategy which led to Red Blue securing an MRI distribution deal.\n\nDuring that meal Carl said ‘Mike, you remind me of ME ten years ago. You’re a hard worker and all hustle.’ I don’t think I’ll ever forget those words. Ever since that quote, I knew we’d be working together and something great would happen.”"
