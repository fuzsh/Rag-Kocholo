The Alternative Distribution Alliance has been in existence since 1993 and became a part of Warner Music Group in 2009. ADA’s entire existence is focused on the independent music business and on developing independent labels through practical distribution. ADA gives independent record labels the distribution that major labels have while allowing the independents to take care of all other business in-house.

The Alternative Distribution Alliance exists to serve those record labels it distributes. While some need only a distribution plan, others want help in marketing and product management. ADA offers a wide variety of services for labels of all sizes and needs. These services include:

Physical and digital global distribution

Physical production

Merchandise production and distribution

Nontraditional account management

Music licensing

Custom products services

Strategic marketing and sponsorships

Digital marketing and associated tools

Beggars Group has consistently been one of ADA’s strongest label groups. It was a Beggars Group artist – Vampire Weekend – who gave ADA their first number one album. Since then, Beggars Group artists have consistently met and exceeded all expectations, in terms of both overall sales and in quality of music produced.
