    "text": "Oscar-winning filmmaker Billy Wilder, who died on Thursday, was one of Hollywood's greatest ever directors.\n\nIn a career spanning six decades, the former refugee from Nazi Germany received 21 Academy Award nominations and won a total of six Oscars.\n\nHe became the first filmmaker to win three Academy Awards in a year.\n\nHe was born Samuel Wilder in the small town of Sucha, 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Vienna, in what is now Poland. He first trained to be a lawyer. From 1929 he worked as a screenwriter for silent films in Berlin until the Nazis came to power and he left for America. Despite knowing no English when he arrived in Hollywood, he was a fast learner and broke into the film industry through the help of friends like the film star Peter Lorre, with whom he once shared an apartment. Billy Wilder never lost his Austrian accent, though, which he said was like a cross between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Racy and literate In 1940s Hollywood Wilder wrote and directed classics like Double Indemnity, a black tale of murder and adultery. \"The best directors,\" he once said, \"don't draw attention to themselves in their work.\" The Seven Year Itch, starring Marilyn Monroe, created one of Hollywood's most enduring images involving a white dress and a pavement ventilation system."
