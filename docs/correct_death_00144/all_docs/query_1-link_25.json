        "text": "He was born Samuel Wilder in the small town of Sucha, 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Vienna, in what is now Poland. He first trained to be a lawyer. From 1929 he worked as a screenwriter for silent films in Berlin until the Nazis came to power and he left for America.\n\nDespite knowing no English when he arrived in Hollywood, he was a fast learner and broke into the film industry through the help of friends like the film star Peter Lorre, with whom he once shared an apartment.\n\nBilly Wilder never lost his Austrian accent, though, which he said was like a cross between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nRacy and literate\n\nIn 1940s Hollywood Wilder wrote and directed classics like Double Indemnity, a black tale of murder and adultery.\n\n\"The best directors,\" he once said, \"don't draw attention to themselves in their work.\" The Seven Year Itch, starring Marilyn Monroe, created one of Hollywood's most enduring images involving a white dress and a pavement ventilation system.\n\nMonroe starred again under Wilder's direction in Some Like it Hot, opposite Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as a pair of musicians on the run from the Mob.\n\nWilder's scripts were racy and littered with barbed jokes. His films, glitzy and literate, won him six Oscars, including two for The Apartment, written with long-time collaborator IAL Diamond.\n\nLater films, like a remake of The Front Page with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, never achieved the commercial success of his earlier films.\n\nWilder was a cynic but also, he maintained, a principled film-maker.\n\nThough his last film was made in 1981, Billy Wilder was still turning up to work at his Hollywood office well into his 80s: his legacy is some of Tinseltown's finest and funniest films, sophisticated, stylish and sometimes surprising.\n\nHis own favourite was Sunset Boulevard. The melodramatic story of a faded silent screen star, it satirised the Hollywood in which Wilder himself flourished for 60 years and won him an Oscar for the screenplay."
