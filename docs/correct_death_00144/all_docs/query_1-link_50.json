    "text": "Film-maker Billy Wilder, the man who directed Some Like It Hot, died of pneumonia yesterday in Beverly Hills. He was 95.\n\nHe won six Oscars, including three for The Apartment in 1960, making him the first person to win three in one year.\n\nHe also directed Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend and was the first director to pair Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Here Glenys Roberts looks back at the film legend's long and memorable career.\n\nBilly Wilder will always be remembered as the director who made the funniest film of all time, Some Like It Hot.\n\nStarring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, everyone has their own favourite moment, whether it be Curtis's impersonation of Cary Grant or Joe E. Brown's immortal pay-off line: 'Nobody's perfect.'\n\nWilder was the last of the great generation of European immigrants who enriched Hollywood with a sophistication entirely absent from the town today, world-class wits bruised in a tumultuous cauldron of history.\n\nThough he left Europe in 1933 when Hitler came to power, he never forgot his Austrian roots or lost his Viennese accent, or, unsurprisingly perhaps, his cynical attitude.\n\nIt is almost impossible to imagine that someone with such a feeling for comedy owed his career in America to the fact that most of his family, including his mother, died in Auschwitz.\n\nTowards the end of his life he confessed he would have loved to have made Schindler's List, about the Nazi death camps, but that Steven Spielberg would not give up the rights. Wilder was gracious enough to say Spielberg had made a great movie.\n\nA small man physically, Wilder's twin trademarks were the pork pie hats he always wore - to hide his red hair - and the caustic observations that never allowed anyone to get really close to him.\n\nHe was, according to Gloria Swanson, star of his first great film, Sunset Boulevard, 'elfin, witty, confident and a bit overactive'.\n\nHe was a wonderful raconteur, and inspired just as many stories about himself. As\n\na young man he trailed actor Ray Milland for miles all the way home in his car, drawing up next to him and yelling through the window: 'Would you work in a picture I am going to direct?'\n\nMilland agreed, leading to Wilder's first Hollywood movie, The Major And The Minor starring Ginger Rogers in 1942, and the start of a brilliant and prolific career.\n\nIrma La Douce, The Lost Weekend, The Spirit Of St Louis, Double Indemnity, the remake of The Front Page and The Seven Year Itch with its famous scene in which Marilyn Monroe's skirt billows up over the pavement grating, all bore Wilder's wonderful touch.\n\nHe divorced his first wife Judith in the early 1940s. With his second wife Audrey he would host starry parties at the Beverly Hills apartment they moved in to in their later years.\n\n'Jack Lemmon, David Hockney, Walter Matthau, you name the person, they were there,' said one who often was. 'The three qualifications were you had to be interesting, pretty or creative - rich was not necessary.\n\n'They were wonderfully elegant occasions full of witty conversation. Billy told his cynical stories while Audrey, who used to be a singer, serenaded the guests with all the old standards - and all this surrounded by Wilder's fabulous art collection.'\n\nAmong artworks he had owned were pieces by Renoir, Braque and Picasso.\n\nThe glamour belied his poor upbringing in an area of Poland that was then part of Austria. He first earned his living as a gigolo, dancing the Charleston with elderly ladies at Berlin tea-dances. Then he became\n\na journalist, interviewing Sigmund Freud, and a ghostwriter for the Berlin film industry, discovering a lifelong fascination for human folly.\n\nWhen he heard Hitler had become Chancellor he left for Hollywood, sharing a room with actor Peter Lorre, living on a can of soup a day and writing scripts.\n\nIn 1950 he made Sunset Boulevard, but not everyone saw its potential. After the first screening, studio head Louis B Mayer demanded: 'How dare this young man, Wilder, bite the hand that feeds him?' The director famously retorted: 'I am Mr Wilder and go f*** yourself.'\n\nHis most memorable films were made with women, whom he absolutely loved. Raymond Chandler, with whom he co-wrote Double Indemnity, said it was impossible to work with him because he was always on the phone to the fair sex.\n\nWilder knew all the great female stars and managed to remain friends with even the most temperamental.\n\n'I told them I loved them all, how else do you keep such a collection of women happy?' was his recipe. 'With leading ladies it is not enough to be a good director, you have to be a good psychiatrist too.'\n\nAccording to Wilder the greatest of them all was Monroe, but she exasperated him because she could never remember her lines.\n\nOn Some Like It Hot he had to shoot the line 'It's me, Sugar' 50 times because she kept saying: 'It's Sugar me.'\n\nLater, all was forgiven. He said of Monroe: 'I have never met anyone as utterly mean nor as utterly fabulous on the screen.'\n\nOf Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo, he said neither were great actresses - 'Garbo was the same in every film, half asleep' - but both knew how to capture an audience.\n\nHe adored Audrey Hepburn, saying: 'Audrey was known for something which has disappeared, and that's elegance, grace and manners. God kissed her on the cheek, and there she was.'\n\nAmong modern directors he said he liked Scorsese, Kubrick and Jonathan Demme, some Japanese and some Italians and of course Spielberg.\n\nHe dined with Spielberg shortly after Schindler's List and watched him mobbed by autograph hunters. Only one fan asked Wilder for his autograph and then asked him to sign it three times. When Wilder asked why, the fan replied: 'Because for three Wilders I can exchange one Spielberg.'\n\nHe did not make a film after 1980, explaining: 'I don't make a picture unless I get final cut from the studio and I have enough money to say, 'Screw you, I don't need you.'\n\nIn 1997, when Tom Cruise asked him to play an acting part in Jerry Maguire, Wilder simply remonstrated with him for wearing jeans.\n\nThe film's director, Cameron Crowe, pleaded with him to reconsider, saying: 'It's just a small part.' Wilder retorted: 'Then I definitely won't do it.'\n\nHollywood will be in deep mourning today. We won't see his like again."
