        "text": "Originally planning to become a lawyer, Billy Wilder abandoned that career in favor of working as a reporter for a Viennese newspaper, using this experience to move to Berlin, where he worked for the city's largest tabloid. He broke into films as a screenwriter in 1929 and wrote scripts for many German films until Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Wilder immediately realized his Jewish ancestry would cause problems, so he emigrated to Paris, then the US. Although he spoke no English when he arrived in Hollywood, Wilder was a fast learner and thanks to contacts such as Peter Lorre (with whom he shared an apartment), he was able to break into American films. His partnership with Charles Brackett started in 1938 and the team was responsible for writing some of Hollywood's classic comedies, including Ninotschka (1939) and Wirbelwind der Liebe (1941). The partnership expanded into a producer-director one in 1942, with Brackett producing and the two turned out such classics as Fünf Gräber bis Kairo (1943), Das verlorene Wochenende (1945) (Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay) and Boulevard der Dämmerung (1950) (Oscars for Best Screenplay), after which the partnership dissolved. (Wilder had already made one film, Frau ohne Gewissen (1944) without Brackett, as the latter had refused to work on a film he felt dealt with such disreputable characters.) Wilder's subsequent self-produced films would become more caustic and cynical, notably Reporter des Satans (1951), though he also produced such sublime comedies as Manche mögen's heiß (1959) and Das Appartement (1960) (which won him Best Picture and Director Oscars). He retired in 1981.\n\nBilly Wilder is an Austrian-born American film director and screenwriter whose career spanned more than five decades.\n\nHe is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of the Hollywood Golden Age of cinema. With Das Appartement (1960), Wilder became the first person to win Academy Awards as producer, director, and screenwriter for the same film.\n\nWilder became a screenwriter in the late 1920s while living in Berlin. Later he left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut. He moved to Hollywood in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit when he co-wrote the screenplay for the romantic comedy Ninotschka (1939), starring Greta Garbo. Wilder established his directorial reputation with an adaption of James M. Cain's Frau ohne Gewissen (1944), a film noir. He co-wrote the screenplay with crime novelist Raymond Chandler. Wilder earned the Best Director and Best Screenplay Academy Awards for the adaptation of a Charles R. Jackson story Das verlorene Wochenende (1945). In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the Boulevard der Dämmerung (1950), as well as Stalag 17 (1953) in 1953.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Wilder made mostly comedies. Among the classics created in this period are Das verflixte 7. Jahr (1955) and Manche mögen's heiß (1959), and satires such as Das Appartement (1960). He directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances."
