    "text": "He collaborated closely with Steven Spielberg on the script for Schindler's List (1993) , and was one of several directors considered to direct it ( Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese ; both turned down the project). Although Wilder strongly considered directing Schindler's List (1993) , he felt he was a little too old (he had already retired) and the subject was almost too personal (his mother, step-father and grandmother were killed in the Holocaust). It was ultimately Wilder who told Spielberg he should direct it."
