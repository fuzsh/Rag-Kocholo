    "text": "Billy Wilder is one of our great film directors, an artist whose track record speaks for itself, a guy who somehow made multiple genre-defining-and-modifying masterpieces one after the other like some kind of incredible filmic assembly line. For any sincere fan or creator of cinema, Wilder's work is simply essential.\n\nBorn in 1906 in the Austria-Hungarian Empire (what we now know as Poland), Wilder began his career in Berlin, working first as a journalist and then eventually as a screenwriter. The traumas of the Holocaust affected Wilder's family tragically — his mother, grandmother, and stepfather were murdered in different concentration camps. To escape the horrors of Nazi Germany, Wilder fled to Paris, where he directed his first film Mauvaise Graine (Bad Seed). After that, he moved to the United States, became an American citizen, and began his sterling work in the Hollywood film industry. Wilder directed 27 films in his lifetime, won six Oscars, received many lifetime achievement awards, and had 10 of his films preserved in the National Film Registry by Congress. He died in 2002 at the age of 95.\n\nIn chronological order, here are 10 essential Billy Wilder films for you to crack into for the first time, or revisit for the umpteenth. Even in our modern day content overload, they still remain entertaining, fiery, passionate, immaculately constructed, and always empathetic pieces of work. And if you don't like one of them, well, nobody's perfect.\n\nDouble Indemnity\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nA vital essential in the film noir canon, Double Indemnity is stylish, iconic, taut, venomous, and still cynical even upon modern eyes. Barbara Stanwyck is, simply, the femme fatale, an alluringly bored housewife who wants to stage the murder of her husband (Tom Powers) as an accident, so she can claim that elusive \"double indemnity\" clause in his life insurance policy and get double the money. Along for the ride is Fred MacMurray, a very normal insurance salesman who gets swirled further and further into this underworld of casual criminality, until his conscience is irrevocably eroded. The story's \"detective\"? Edward G. Robinson, MacMurray's coworker, a claims adjuster whose job it is to find holes in Stanwyck's story — and inadvertently indict MacMurray in the process. Double Indemnity puts the viewer in an appealingly complicated position. We want desperately to see Robinson find the truth, but also want desperately to see Stanwyck and her dope shades succeed, but also also want MacMurray to redeem himself even though we know he can't and also also also want him to get punished... There's a lot going on in Double Indemnity, is what I'm saying. Wilder's masterfully composed touch makes it all a peerlessly entertaining, much-copied ride.\n\nThe Lost Weekend\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nTo modern viewers, the depictions of demons in The Lost Weekend may read as melodrama, as over-intense or unrealistic. One: The power of cinematic melodrama, of the sincere blasting and overwhelming of emotions using every tool in a filmmaker's palate, is underrated; what better way to immerse a viewer directly into a character's psychological state of being than to heighten it to mythic stakes and place the viewer directly in the center? And two: The central performances of Ray Milland as an alcoholic author and Jane Wyman as his girlfriend determined to help him are necessary watches for any fans or practicers of screen acting. Milland's sheer self-destructive determination to escape into the forgetful pleasures of the bottle is grimly, beautifully, and even sparsely played, Wilder's close-ups allowing for plenty of interior reckoning. And Wyman's seemingly bottomless pit of empathy, of pleading, of reminders in the inherent kindness and purpose of all of us gives the film an inherent kindness and purpose. The Lost Weekend isn't just a miserablist, kitchen-sink-cum-melodrama slide into decay. It shows us how to climb out, too.\n\nSunset Boulevard\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nA metatextual tragedy that reaches the highest heights of emotional intensity by plunging further and further into primal, emotional lows. That's not true just of the characters within Sunset Boulevard, but of the real-life film systems that allowed its characters (and performers) to flourish before evolving past the point of their relevance — an evolution that, in bitter irony, needed to happen to allow such a picture like Sunset Boulevard to even exist. Famed silent film performer Gloria Swanson gives an unshakable, fearless performance as Norma Desmond, a woman stuck in her past accolades, existing in a living tomb of Hollywood excess and sycophancy (enabled in part by famed silent film director Erich von Stroheim as her loyal butler, giving arguably the film's most tragic performance). Other notable Hollywood luminaries showing up to mourn and muck with their legacies include Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and most importantly Cecil B. DeMille (hmm, isn't there some famous line about being ready for his closeup or something?). At the eye of this hurricane, representing the unending speed of change not just in his character function but in his performance, is William Holden as a struggling screenwriter, who takes the gig to turn Swanson's mad musings into something resembling a screenplay, before falling under the call of her pallor splendor. A film of astonishing power. Take a shower after.\n\nAce in the Hole\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nIf you're feeling dour about the state of contemporary media and need a pick-me-up, do not watch Ace in the Hole. While we primarily know Kirk Douglas as an onscreen paragon of virtue thanks to iconic rah-rah roles like Spartacus, Wilder has the actor fold, tighten, and sharpen his natural charm into a forceful weapon. Douglas plays a has-been newspaper reporter who is desperate to find his way back on top, and will do anything to get there. And when I say anything, I mean it. Distorting the truth behind stories, aligning with corrupt forces, berating and belittling anyone who dares get in his way — Ace in the Hole is a single-minded sprint through the corrupting forces of power, and the disquieting folks who seek it. It was such a bitter pill to swallow that critics at the time panned it, but this might play as Wilder's most modern-feeling film. Pair this with Sweet Smell of Success for a wonderful \"classic Hollywood corrupt journalism\" double feature.\n\nStalag 17\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nYou can see a hint of the kind of tone that might become M*A*S*H in Stalag 17, Wilder's reunion with his Sunset Boulevard star William Holden. The stakes and circumstances are high and dire — Wilder's adaptation of a hit Broadway play takes place in a Germany World War II prisoner of war, and its imprisoned characters start to believe there is a there is an informant among their ranks. And when Wilder needs to turn the screws of this vicious reality, he does with uncompromised detail (I'm especially fond of his giant contrasts between light and shadow illustrating the moral trickery going on). But much of the picture, anchored by Holden's Oscar-winning performance, strikes a gratefully light tone. The prisoners have a pervasive sense of survival/gallows humor to cope with the misery of their surroundings, from mouse races to pining over Hollywood stars to even bantering openly with their German captors to secure creature comforts. This bed of \"dramedy\" makes the truly \"dramatic\" moments of life-and-death stakes disrupt even harder, and gives Holden's arc (from cynicism to belief) and the crew's plans (actually escaping the prison) an endearing emotional oomph.\n\nSabrina\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\nHow's this for some classic Hollywood flavor? Sabrina gives us another indelible Wilder-Holden collaboration, with the addition of two absolute superstars: Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. These three undergo a delicious love triangle that is as sparkly, sweet, and sharp as you might imagine from such magnificent Hollywood players. But it's not purely rosé; there's an undercurrent of complex flavors that gives Sabrina an unprecedented sense of \"edge,\" differentiating it from most classic romance films. Bogart and Holden play brothers, giving the love triangle a sense of eyebrow-raising stakes that both actors lean into, to shocking, even \"icky\" comedic success. Hepburn, forever a paragon of class with bite, falls into the love triangle plot of the picture by virtue of a suicide attempt. And Bogart had real-life, behind-the-scenes drama with everyone involved, thinking he wasn't right for this kind of film and belittling the choices of all primary members. Bogart later apologized, but you can feel his sense of unease, of not quite \"fitting\" into the sparkly romance genre throughout the film. And I would argue it's a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe Seven Year Itch\n\nImage via 20th Century Fox\n\nWhen you think of Marilyn Monroe, you think of her in a white dress, the sudden steam of a subway grate causing it to blow around her as she grabs it and laughs. This beyond-iconic image, perhaps the image of what we call \"classic Hollywood,\" comes to us courtesy of Billy Wilder's The Seven Year Itch. Referring to the amount of time someone can spend in a monogamous relationship before they get, y'know, \"itchy,\" The Seven Year Itch stars Tom Ewell as an absolute dorkus who has a nice job, a wonderful marriage, and an imagination prone to wild flights of fancy (a proto-Zach Braff, if you will). When his wife (Evelyn Keyes) leaves town on vacation, Ewell's imagination, coupled with this burgeoning \"itch,\" tripled with the arrival of new neighbor Monroe leads to a series of wild fantasy sequences jutting up sharply against the more complicated, less smooth truths of maintaining a relationship. The Seven Year Itch is an all-out, Technicolor, Cinemascope blast of a film, a true romp that has fun playing with all kinds of genres before the hard-cut to reality reminds us that some ideas are better left in the brain. Later in life, Wilder himself regretted the final film, calling it \"a nothing picture,\" complaining of the censorship inherent in film production at the time, and wishing he could remake it so the imagined affair could become more explicit. I would argue the limitations of the film's sexual explorations add up to many of its charms and themes, and while Wilder may have wished the drink was a little stronger, his 7Up tastes pretty damn bubbly to me.\n\nWitness for the Prosecution\n\nImage via United Artists\n\nWitness for the Prosecution works so well as a fiery intersection between various different modes and impulses. It's a classical courtroom drama that also functions as a gripping whodunit, courtesy of Agatha Christie's source material. It's made by the great American filmmaker Billy Wilder, but it is an utterly British-feeling film, allowing this \"great American filmmaker\" to tap into his more complicated international history. And it contains bonafide movie stars like Marlene Dietrich delivering performances that burrow into characters we've never seen them play before, shedding any preconceived notions or personas. Witness for the Prosecution is the story of a man accused of murder (Tyrone Power), his wife who has something to hide (Dietrich), and the aging lawyer — sorry, \"barrister\" — trying desperately to put it all together (Charles Laughton). For fans of character-driven legal procedurals (i.e. me times one billion), you are already sold on Witness for the Prosecution, and must watch it posthaste. For those who find Law & Order reruns boring, I encourage you to still give the film a chance. Wilder and his performers are simply working at the top of their game, in immaculate control of every facet of the film, and I promise you will be leaning forward as you watch, gripped in tight suspense and thrill. Just thinking about the ending gives me goosebumps!\n\nSome Like It Hot\n\nImage via United Artists\n\nSome Like It Hot is a peerless watch, a fierce and fascinating crime-rom-com with ripples that have affected nearly every comedy since, especially those that play with other genres and odd couple relationships (there is no Rush Hour without Some Like It Hot, and I will not be taking questions at this time). Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis star as jazz musicians, best friends, and traders of some of the best screenwriting banter you'll ever hear. When they accidentally witness mobsters committing an atrocious crime (how's that for an inciting incident? In a damn comedy, no less!), they head on the run with a band, supporting lead singer and returning Wilder star Marilyn Monroe. Just one other twist — to stay disguised from the criminals out to silence their last witnesses, Lemmon and Curtis develop drag personas, effectively becoming new women in the process. Complications, shenanigans, lovestruckness, and some of the wildest, sharpest farcical plot constructions you'll ever see ensue, ensuring you will never be bored by a single scene. Wilder's film is perhaps an answer to the relative conservatism of his previous Monroe collaboration; Some Like It Hot's muckraking in social taboos of the day ensured its release without approval of the Hays Motion Picture Production Code, and its smash success ensured the demise of the Hays Motion Picture Production Code. It's a riotous, modern-feeling watch to this day, and the very last line is one for the ages.\n\nThe Apartment\n\nImage via United Artists\n\nA slice-of-life dramedy whose tragedies are tempered by moments of mirth, whose intimate hiccups are rendered in heightened emotional states, and whose ultimate optimism feels attainably realistic. The Apartment is one heckuva motion picture, is what I'm saying. Lemmon returns to play in Wilder's world, but a much more subdued, realistic one, that I might argue represents the peak of both of their powers. His Bud, a mid-level insurance agent whose titular apartment is used and abused by his various superiors for all kinds of indiscretions, is a man constantly picked on. But Lemmon doesn't play him like a passive, sad-sack protagonist. He remains active, always striving, always clawing against the inherent unfairness of life. When he finally meets someone — well, not \"someone,\" the hall-of-famer Shirley MacLaine giving a hall-of-fame performance — who seems to share a similar zest for life despite life's overly pulpy nature, both parties may finally have a chance for hope, romance, and redemption. But it's gonna take a lot of work, heartbreak, and desperation to get there, which Wilder renders in both unsparing detail and never-ceasing joy. Once again, the last line is one for the ages."
