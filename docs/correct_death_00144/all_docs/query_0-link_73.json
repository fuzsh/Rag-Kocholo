    "text": "Before the days of swimming pools, almost every house north of Sunset Boulevard had its own stables. In those days, there was no traffic and the street signs said, “Horses have the right of way.” In the roaring ‘20s, the southern part of the City was dominated by the Los Angeles Speedway that hosted 80,000 spectators for the 1924 Speed King of the Year championship race. You could still ride your horse down Rodeo until the mid 1950s when the sleepy street started to transform into a legendary destination. The flowerbeds in the middle of the street are a remnant of the bridle path that once ran up and down Rodeo.\n\nFor more about the influence of horses and horsepower on Beverly Hills, watch the video below."
