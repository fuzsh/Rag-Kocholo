    "text": "I. A. L. Diamond, the Hollywood screenwriter and the longtime collaborator of the director Billy Wilder, died of multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills. He was 67 years old. Mr. Diamond, who spent his entire professional life writing movies, was best known for the films he made with Mr. Wilder. These included ''Love in the Afternoon,'' ''Some Like It Hot,'' ''The Apartment,'' ''One, Two, Three,'' ''The Fortune Cookie,'' ''Irma la Douce,'' ''Kiss Me, Stupid,'' ''The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,'' ''The Front Page,'' ''Fedora,'' ''Avanti'' and ''Buddy, Buddy.''\n\nWhen Mr. Wilder was given the Irving G. Thalberg Award for lifetime achievement at the Academy Awards ceremony this month, he acknowledged Mr. Diamond's contributions to his work in his acceptance speech.\n\nMr. Diamond won an Academy Award for ''The Apartment,'' but in general he was a retiring sort who talked little and seemed perfectly happy with his relative obscurity. In addition to writing, he also collaborated with Mr. Wilder in planning a good deal of the direction of a picture. ''If I ever lost this guy, I'd feel like Abercrombie without Fitch,'' Mr. Wilder once said. 'Never Had It So Good'\n\nMr. Diamond's credits also included ''Cactus Flower,'' ''Merry Andrews,'' the Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe movie called ''Monkey Business,'' ''Love Nest,'' ''Let's Make It Legal,'' ''Romance on the High Seas,'' ''Two Guys From Texas,'' ''It's a Great Feeling,'' ''Love and Learn,'' ''Never Say Goodbye,'' ''The Girl From Jones Beach'' and ''Murder in the Blue Room,'' among others."
