Wilder became a screenwriter in the late 1920s while living in Berlin. After the rise of the Nazi Party, Wilder, who was Jewish, left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut. From the mid-1950s on, Wilder made mostly comedies. He directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances.
