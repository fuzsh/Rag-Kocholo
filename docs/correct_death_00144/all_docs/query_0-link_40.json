She is best known for the movie Sunset Boulevard, and he was a hugely popular movie star, radio personality, political humorist, and the first honorary mayor of Beverly Hills. Rogers had a Polo field on his property and when the riders were done, theyâ€™d walk across the street to the hotel bar. When Rogers died, the hotel named that bar in his honor and the Polo Lounge was born.\n\nTo learn more about the first honorary mayor of Beverly Hills, watch the video below."
