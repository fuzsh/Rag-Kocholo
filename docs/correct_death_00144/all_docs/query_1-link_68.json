        "meta_description": "Billy Wilder was an Austrian Jew whose glittering career spanned five decades. He was a producer, director and screenwriter who was nominated for 21 Academy Awards and won seven. His films, which encompass the golden age of Hollywood, include “Double Indemnity,” “Witness for the Prosecution,” “The Lost Weekend,” “The Apartment,” “The Seven Year Itch” and perhaps the greatest dark comedy, “Some Like it Hot.” When he died at the age of 96, his obituary in the French newspaper “Le Monde” proclaimed “Billy Wilder is dead. Nobody is perfect.”",
