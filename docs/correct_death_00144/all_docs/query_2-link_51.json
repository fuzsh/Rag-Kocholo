        "text": "Released in 1968, the Eames ES106 Chaise Longue would also become affectionately known as the Eames 'Billy Wilder' Chaise and later be re-coded into model H106. It was essentially a luxurious full leather daybed but with an extra twist.\n\nThe anecdotal story that always surrounded the Eames ES106 Chaise Longue was that the idea came from a visit by Charles and Ray to the actor Billy Wilder. He remarked on his need for a daybed and was currently using a long 6 foot plank suspended between 2 sawhorses. The reality however is that there was some 13 years between that moment and the release of the ES106 so the level of direct inspiration is patchy. Wilder was however, presented with one of the first to come from the production line.\n\nThe Eames ES106 Chaise Longue was very much in tandem with other designs of the period, including the Intermediate Chair and Soft Pad Range. It had 6 separate soft cushions, made from the best leather upholstery, tied together to sit on the frame of the Chaise. There was then two extra pillows for added comfort. The Chaise was initially released only in the very best Black leather and aubergine/eggplant frame but would later be available in other colors, black frame and sometimes fabric.\n\nUnlike other daybeds, the Eames ES106 Chaise Longue was not designed for sleeping but for cat (or power) napping. The thin profile of the Chaise Longue meant that the user had to rest their arms on the chest rather than by the side. Should the user then begin to fall into a deep sleep, the motion of their users arms dropping heavily down would wake them."
