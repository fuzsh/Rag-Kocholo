Or like Minnelli, doing the great Metro musicals. As a picture-maker, and I think most of us are this way, I am not aware of patterns. We're not aware that 'This picture will be in this genre.' It comes naturally, just the way you do your handwriting.\" An excerpt from Film Noir Reader 3 (November 2001, Limelight Editions).\n\nGo to the interview"
