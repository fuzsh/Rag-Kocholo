    "text": "This undated photo provided by the @One Cut of the Dead Mission: Remote shows Shinichiro Ueda, director of One Cut of the Dead Mission: Remote, a YouTube spinoff of his 2017 award-winning film. A comedic horror film centered around teleworking, \"One Cut of the Dead Mission: Remote” was released earlier this year and shared for free on YouTube. It features the same characters from his award-winning 2017 film “One Cut of the Dead,” which has one shot that was 37-minutes long. Ueda’s style incorporates slapstick comedy and focuses on visual, rather than explanatory verbal storytelling, an approach relatively rare in contemporary Japanese film. “It’s only after 200 or 300 bad films you will have that one great film,” he said."
