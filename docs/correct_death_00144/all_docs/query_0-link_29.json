U.S. motion-picture writer, director, and producer Billy Wilder was known for satirical treatments of controversial subjects that provided humorous but biting glimpses into the hypocrisy of American life. Over the course of his remarkable career, Wilder made more than 50 films and received seven Academy awards, including the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Award. Wilder also was honored by President Bill Clinton, who awarded him the National Medal of Honor for his contributions to film.\n\nBorn Samuel Wilder in Sucha, Austria, on June 22, 1906, he attended the University of Vienna for a year before finding work as a journalist in Vienna and then in Berlin. In 1929 he collaborated on his first screenplay, a semidocumentary entitled People on Sunday, which he also codirected. For the next four years Wilder wrote for the German and French cinemas. With Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in Germany in 1933, Wilder, a Jew, decided to immigrate to the United States, settling in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1944 Wilder established his credentials as a director with his first American film, Double Indemnity. Thereafter, in collaboration first with Charles Brackett until 1950 and then with I.A.L. Diamond from 1957, Wilder wrote films that he directed and frequently produced. His screenplays often dealt with subject matter that previously had been considered unacceptable for the screen, including alcoholism (The Lost Weekend, 1945), prisoner-of-war camps (Stalag 17, 1953), and prostitution (Irma La Douce, 1963). A number of his films, such as Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Apartment (1960), weighed the emptiness of modern life. Wilder returned to the same themes later in his career in such films as Avanti! (1972), Fedora (1978), and Buddy Buddy (1981). Many of Wilder’s most successful films were comedies—Sabrina (1954), The Seven Year Itch (1955), Some Like It Hot (1959), and One, Two, Three (1961)—in which his usual social commentary was either missing or more subtly interwoven into the story line.\n\nIn 1986 the American Film Institute gave Wilder its Life Achievement Award, and in 1988 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with the Irving G. Thalberg Award for outstanding achievement. Wilder was one of the 1990 recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual gala that honors lifetime achievement in the performing arts. On March 27, 2002, Wilder died in Beverly Hills, California."
