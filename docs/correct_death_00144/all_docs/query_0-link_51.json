    "text": "Sunset Boulevard (sometimes known as SUNSET BLVD.) is a 1950 American film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the thoroughfare with the same name that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California.\n\nWhy It Rocks [ ]\n\nFilmmakers turning the camera on themselves throughout the history of the medium is nothing new. But while most of those previous movies where comedies; affectionate stories with occasional sarcasm (i.e. Show People and Boy Meets Girl), Paramount would notably take a more hard-edged approach with its unofficial trilogy of The Last Command , Sullivan's Travels , and Sunset Blvd., as these films would offer some of the darkest accounts of the industry on film. In this case, the film gives the viewers a dark but realistic look at what fame and power can do someone if they let it get to their head, and pulls no punches in showing how Hollywood isn't as glamorous as one would expect. Considering that director Billy Wilder had a background as a gigolo and a screenwriter, it makes sense that he would be able to write such a compelling script about a Midwest screenwriter becoming a sort of paid escort to the star. The film's still a semi-comedy, although it became something dark and sordid, with elements of horror and film noir mixed in. There's just enough truth to the story and characters in the film to keep viewers unsettled. This includes incorporating the Paramount lot, where Cecil B. DeMille was filming Samson and Delilah, or featuring real stars of the silent film era as the \"waxworks\" bridge players. In fact, Wilder's usage of reality in the film was ahead of its time, as the industry wasn't even prepared for it. All the central characters give phenomenal performances in their roles including William Holden, Erich von Stroheim, and Nancy Olson. Special mention goes to real-life silent film star Gloria Swanson who played Norma Desmond incredibly well and get us to feel for her. Plus, Swanson herself was of the many silent film stars unable to properly transition to sound films, due to her age and her overly expressing acting than to her voice. These elements would be translated to her character Norma Desmond. Swanson would accept the project wholeheartedly, offering some photographs and mementos from her films, and even allowing Wilder to use a clip from 1929's Queen Kelly. Well-written and complex characters all around. More than the accuracy of the sets and props, Wilder achieved psychological honesty about his characters that was as ghastly as it was transfixing: Norma Desmond is a very sympathetic antagonist who rarely has any contact with outsiders and loses her love and respect as her career ends, and a dramatized reflection of Gloria Swanson who went through similar experiences.\n\nJoe Gillis is a broken down screenwriter who sticks with Norma because he thinks that she can help her out, then feels like he's being used and tries getting away from her.\n\nMax von Mayerling is Norma's first husband, and a former director who became her butler hoping he can keep Norma from losing herself.\n\nBetty Schaefer is one of the nicest characters in the film, as she's a Hollywood script-reader who dreams of being an official Hollywood writer and is also a great foil to both of the film's central characters, Joe and Norma. The story manages to blend in Norma's substory and how Joe had died at the beginning of the film very well without throwing in any plot-holes or unnecessary details. Countless memorable quotes that are parodied constantly in other media, most of which are from Norma. Real life silent film stars and directors made appearances within the film. These include Cecil B. DeMille, H.B. Warner, Anna Q. Nilsson, and Buster Keaton. Erich von Stroheim even played Norma's butler/former silent film director, which was pretty smart since he was a director in real life AND worked with Gloria Swanson. Talk about showing your work.\n\nThe Only Bad Quality [ ]\n\nSome of the film's characters can be hard to relate to for today's standards. Though this is partially justified since they're showing us the dark side of Hollywood.\n\nTrivia [ ]"
