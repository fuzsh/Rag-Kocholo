        "text": "Imagine for a moment a party, a somewhat elegant affair, populated solely by characters from the films of Billy Wilder.\n\nOver there at the piano, swirling a drink, is the doomed Walter Neff from Double Indemnity. He’s trying not to stare at the effervescent Sugar Kane from Some Like It Hot. Fran Kubelik and C. C. Baxter from The Apartment dance closely to some postmodern jazz in another room, while Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard descends the main staircase. And outside, hiding in a tree on this moonlit night, yearning for a glimpse of David Larrabee, studying every movement in this full house of wildly different characters, crouches the lovesick Sabrina.\n\nWhat an evening it would be. And yet chances are the host wouldn’t stick around to take many bows for himself. Billy Wilder, master of the screen story, isn’t much for the collecting of compliments. Physically, the Wilder of today moves deliberately, sometimes with a cane. Yet he shows up at his Beverly Hills office almost daily, reading, tending to his relationships in the art world, and still staying in touch with the supercharged and, sadly, often character-deprived film farce of today.\n\nA few fast details on a rich and well-traveled life. Wilder was born on June 22, 1906, in the town of Sucha, in an area of Poland that was then part of Austria. His name was Samuel, but his mother always called him Billie. The Wilders moved to Vienna a few years later. His creative life began when Wider took on a job as a newspaper reporter in Vienna. He flourished in the role and built a quick reputation for dogged pursuit of his subjects. Wilder traveled to Berlin in June of 1926 and there became a ghostwriter for the German film industry. Soon he was a credited writer, and his work grew in stature as wartime approached. Escaping to Paris, and then to America, Wilder turned up in Los Angeles and fell in with other refugees from Europe who would change film history. Ernst Lubitsch, the German director of sophisticated comedies, had arrived previously, and before long Wilder would link up with his hero to co-write Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife in 1938 and, a year later, the seminal Ninotchka, the film in which Greta Garbo, as the ads famously trumpeted, laughs. Wilder began directing in 1942 with The Major and the Minor, from a script written with his first great collaborator, Charles Brackett. His most recent film is 1981’s Buddy Buddy, written with another landmark collaborator, I. A. L. Diamond.\n\nWilder’s talent for taking the darkness in men and skewering it with illuminating humor arrived early. “I was beaten in the home,” he says matter-of-factly, with a characteristic lack of self-pity. Asked pointedly about his childhood, Wilder can be detached and uncommunicative. A new subject and a joke cannot be far behind.\n\nIn 1928, Wilder’s father died in Berlin, where he was visiting Billy on a stopover from a trip to America. Wilder’s mother died in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. He battled the horrible memory with career perseverance and an unparalleled wit—there are few filmmakers who don’t crave being compared to him. His is a tough-minded romanticism and elegance; the lack of sentimentality has left him forever relevant as an artist. He has won every award, received every accolade. A magnificent life, perfectly written and performed, and one can’t help wondering: Perhaps the greatest character creation of young Billie Wilder . . . is Billy Wilder himself.\n\nKISSING OFF LOUIS B. MAYER . . . SUNSET BOULEVARD . . . DOUBLE INDEMNITY\n\nCAMERON CROWE: There is a famous story from the first Hollywood screening of Sunset Boulevard [in 1950]. Louis B. Mayer [head of MGM] was standing on a stairway, railing about “How dare this young man, Wilder, bite the hand that feeds him?” What did you say to him when you overheard all this?\n\nBILLY WILDER: “I am Mr. Wilder, and go fuck yourself.”\n\nCROWE: What did he say to that?\n\nWILDER: He was astonished. He was standing with the great MGM bosses who were below him, there at the studio, Mr. [Eddie] Mannix and Mr. [Joe] Cohen. And that so astonished them, that somebody had the guts to say, “Why don’t you go and fuck yourself,” because I knew that I had a good picture there.\n\nCROWE: Is Sunset Boulevard a black comedy?\n\nWILDER: No. Just a picture.\n\nCROWE: What was the initial inspiration behind Sunset Boulevard?\n\nWILDER: I wanted to make things a little harder for myself, I wanted to do that thing which never quite works—a picture about Hollywood. Originally it was a comedy, possibly for Mae West. The picture became about a silent star and a writer. [It’s a dark romance between the washed-up star and the young screenwriter.] And we could not find the person to play the great silent star. Mae West did not want to do it. Mary Pickford, no. We were about to sign or not sign Pola Negri for the movie. Then we came upon the idea of Gloria Swanson [then only 51, but who hadn’t made a film since 1941]. It might have been George Cukor who first suggested her. She had already been abandoned; she was a death knell—she had lost a lot of money on the Paramount lot. But I insisted on her. A wonderful idea that carried with it the great value that she had been a silent star and had made a picture with [director] Erich von Stroheim called Queen Kelly, which we could also use on the projection screen in her home. We did a screen test, she did a few lines, where an angry Swanson maintains that she’s still the greatest. Now we had a picture. She got a minimal salary, $150,000, less than [co-star William] Holden. And it was a wonderful thing that I also had Stroheim [as an actor, playing Swanson’s butler]. He had two ideas for the film, one of which I used—the writing of the fan letters himself. The other was, he wished to be seen washing her underwear. [He demonstrates Stroheim lovingly washing the garments.] Stroheim!\n\nMontgomery Clift was to play the writer. Three days before, he pulled out.\n\nCROWE: How did you find out? Did Clift call himself?\n\nWILDER: A lady agent called. It so happens Mr. Clift had an affair with an older woman in New York [torch singer Libby Holman]. And he did not want to make his first big picture, playing the lead, the story of a man being kept by a very rich woman twice his age. He did not want Hollywood talk. He was a New York actor, and he did not want to start his career that way.\n\nCROWE: Did you get angry?\n\nWILDER: What is angry? Angry is not good, you know. It’s just “Who do we take?” Leading men at that time were all under contract to the studios. And I have to start shooting on Monday, right? So I went through the list Paramount had at that time. And they had a young actor by the name of William Holden. Beedle was his name, really, and he had changed it. He made a picture I enjoyed. It was very good, Golden Boy [1939]. I gave the script to Holden at one o’clock, and at three he was at my house, and he said, “Absolutely, I want to do it.” And people underestimated him, you know, because he was very good. He was a very good actor. And I made other pictures, like Stalag 17 [1953], with him, and Sabrina [1954]. It was kind of like what I had with [Jack] Lemmon later on, you know.\n\nWhen I did Double Indemnity [1944], I tried every leading man in town. I went about as low as George Raft, that’s pretty low. [Laughs.] He had somebody read the script for him, because he could not read. Could not write and could not read. So somebody read the script [in which the hero is manipulated into committing murder by a femme fatale], and then halfway through he came over to the studio and said, “I’m halfway through that script, and where comes the lapel?” And I said, “The lapel?” “You know what I mean—when does he show that he’s an F.B.I. man? The lapel!” [Wilder demonstrates turning the lapel of a coat over, showing an F.B.I. badge.] “There’s no lapel,” I tell him. “I really am a murderer!? I wouldn’t do that! I wouldn’t touch it, for God’s sake!” But [Barbara] Stanwyck knew that it was good stuff, and she grabbed it. She took the script, loved it, right from the word go, didn’t have the agent come and say, “Look, she’s to play a murderess, she must get more money, because she’s never going to work again.” With Stanwyck, I had absolutely no difficulties at all.\n\nCROWE: Did you write the part for her?\n\nWILDER: Yeah. And then there was an actor by the name of Fred MacMurray at Paramount, and he played comedies. Small dramatic parts, big parts in comedies. I let him read it, and he said, “I can’t do that.” And I said, “Why can’t you?” He said, “It requires acting!” [Laughs.] I said, “Look, you have now arrived in comedy, you’re at a certain point where you either have to stop or you have to jump over the river and start something new.” He said, “Will you tell me when I’m no good?” [He nods: a partnership is born.] And he was wonderful because it’s odd casting.\n\nCROWE: Why didn’t you use the gas-chamber ending you’d scripted and shot with Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson?\n\nWILDER: I did not need it. I knew it as I was filming the next-to-the-last scene [in which insurance investigator Robinson lights a cigarette for the severely wounded MacMurray]. The story was between the two guys. I knew it, even though I had already filmed the gas-chamber scene. Here was the scene I didn’t use. It was a close-up of Robinson and a close-up of MacMurray. The looks. There was a connection with his heart. The doctor was standing there listening to the heartbeat when the heartbeat stopped. I had it all, a wonderful look between the two, and then MacMurray was filled with gas. Robinson comes out, and the other witnesses are there. And he took a cigar, opened the cigar case, and struck the match. It was moving—but the other scene, the previous scene, was moving in itself. You didn’t know if it was the police siren in the background or the hospital sending the doctor. What the hell do we need to see him die for? Right? So we just took out that scene in the gas chamber— cost us about $5,000, because we had to build that thing. It was an exact duplicate, and there are always two chairs there—two chairs, in case of a double murder and they execute them together. So one chair was empty. It was a very good scene. But we’d said it.\n\nCROWE: It was a bold move, robbing yourself of the shocking ending in favor of a quieter scene.\n\nWILDER: There was no greater significance than this—we’d said it.\n\nSTALAG 17\n\nWILDER: Stalag 17, that’s one of my favorite pictures. Isn’t it nice? It was very good. It was a commercial hit on Broadway too [in its original version, a play about American P.O.W’s in a German camp during World War II], but I think that I improved it 100 percent, if I say so myself. Yeah. The whole character of Sefton—that was the character that Holden played. The idea of making him a braggart—people think a liar and a phony—then we find out slowly that he is really a hero. At the end, he tucks his head out again, from the hole they have there in the barracks, and says, “If I ever see any of you mugs again, let’s just pretend that we don’t know each other.” And off he goes [to help another prisoner, facing death, escape]. And he only does it because the mother of the lieutenant who is captured is a rich woman, and he’s gonna get $10,000. He’s no hero, he’s a black-market dealer—a good character, and wonderfully played by Holden.\n\nCROWE: I’ve heard that they were trying to shut you down while you were making Stalag 17, because of the politics.\n\nWILDER: I don’t remember it. I was called in by the front office, and I had a couple of guys, prisoners, I had them in dirty underwear. It was too dirty for them. They said, “We can’t go on with that picture with the men being so dirty running around.” I said, “Like hell I will. I will close down the picture, and you can have somebody else do it.” And I did it dirty, as it was. The war was over, and what were we afraid of?\n\nCROWE: But the whole idea, as in Stalag 17, of two men dancing together, the role reversals, the masks—these were all elements that would come to be a part of your style.\n\nWILDER: Yeah, when I saw the play, I saw the potential. And I wrote it—rewrote it, I should say. It was not one of the nominated pictures, but it hung to me as a medal. You know, maybe not a gold, maybe a silver medal.\n\nTHE SEVEN YEAR ITCH . . . WORKING WITH MARILYN MONROE . . . ARTHUR MILLER: IDIOT\n\nCROWE: The Seven Year Itch [1955]?\n\nWILDER: Seven Year Itch was just a play [a comedy about a Manhattan husband who is tempted by his bombshell upstairs neighbor]. I was angry there, I was on loan to Fox. But I thought, if nothing else, the picture was good for the invention of that girl [Marilyn Monroe’s character], the girl who is always hot, you know. She’s got no air-conditioning. But she says, “Let me just change my clothes. I’ve got to run up to my icebox.” [Co-star Tom Ewell] says, “You what? You—” Yeah, I keep my underwear in my icebox, why not? It leaves you kind of really astonished, my God. Then they go to see that movie [Creature from the Black Lagoon], and then they walk back, and she stands there over the grille, where the cold wind is coming, and her skirt blows up. [Aside:] I had guys fighting as to who was going to put the ventilator on, in the shaft there, below the grille.\n\nCROWE: So you knew at the time that it was going to be a famous sequence.\n\nWILDER: Yeah, I did know, I did know, and it played very well. But then again, I was so stupid, because we were looking for a representative ad [for the movie], and it did not occur to me that this thing, where she’s kind of trying to keep the dress down, that this is it! They copied it. They made little figurines and sold it. We had some noninteresting ad for the movie. [Pause.] But it was a ploy, you know. It was not much, but I don’t think it was [a failure]. The people had a good time, it was a success.\n\nCROWE: Years later, do you think Arthur Miller was out of line to make such a fuss over your treatment of Marilyn Monroe on Some Like It Hot [1959]? He famously took you on for the so-called “exploiting” of his wife.\n\nWILDER: He was an idiot. He came to me one day toward the end of Some Like It Hot—we were at the [Hotel del] Coronado [in San Diego]. He takes me aside and he says, “Marilyn is pregnant, so please, don’t make her work before, let’s say, 11 o’clock. Don’t have her come up there.” I say, “Before 11 o’clock? She’s never on the set before 11 o’clock! I wish you would be directing it—you would be tearing out your hair, you would slit your own throat, because she’s never there!” She was either a maniac or she was very, very soft and gentle. “I would be delighted if she came after lunch. Every day after lunch? Please, I would be delighted to have her.”\n\nBut there’s a very good joke about Marilyn Monroe when she married Arthur Miller. They were engaged then. He said, “I would like you to meet my mother, she would like to see you. So I thought we’d go to her little apartment in the Bronx, we’ll have a little dinner, and she’ll get to know you.” And Marilyn said, “Wonderful, wonderful.” So they go there, to that tiny little apartment, with a kind of very flimsy door between the living room and the toilet. They’re having a very good time, they get along great, and then Marilyn Monroe says she’s got to go to the W.C., the toilet. And she goes, and because the walls are thin, she turns on all the faucets so they would not hear it in the next room. Now she comes out, and everything’s beautiful, kiss, kiss, kiss. Next day, Arthur calls the mother and says, “How did you like her?” And the mother says, “She’s sweet, a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful girl, but she pisses like a horse!”\n\nIt’s very difficult to talk seriously about Monroe, because she was so glitzy, you know. She escaped the seriousness somehow; she changed the subject. Except she was very tough to work with. But what you had, by hook or crook, once you saw it on the screen, it was just amazing. Amazing, the radiation that came out. And she was, believe it or not, an excellent dialogue actress. She knew where the laugh was. She knew. But then again, we would have 300 extras, Miss Monroe is called for nine o’clock, and she would appear at five in the afternoon. And she would stand there and say, “I’m sorry, but I lost my way to the studio.” She had been under contract there for seven years!\n\nCROWE: Do you remember your last conversation with Monroe?\n\nWILDER: Whenever I saw her, I always forgave her. The last time I saw her, she was pregnant, and she was breaking up with Miller. She was with Yves Montand. She came to a party at Romanoff’s, after a screening of The Apartment. She was shooting a picture with George Cukor [Let’s Make Love, 1960], as nice a man as you can find. But [Monroe and I] never had any great or close personal relations. I did not bend, you know, to her whims. I was there. I was there and she was not there. I would send somebody for her, to knock on the door to her dressing room, the second assistant. “Miss Monroe, we’re ready.” “Oh, fuck off!” [Laughs.] I did not want to expose my first assistant, or myself. She was a . . . I don’t know, she was just a continuous puzzle, without any solution.\n\nSOME LIKE IT HOT\n\nCROWE: What was the genesis of Some Like It Hot?\n\nWILDER: The genesis of the idea was a very low-budget, very third-class German picture [Fanfares of Love, 1932] where two guys who need a job go into blackface to get into a band. . . . They also dress up [in drag] to go into a female band. But there was not one other thing that came from this terrible picture. We had to find, I thought, the key to why they go into that band and what keeps them there. If the gangsters who are chasing them see them as women, only as women, then . . . once they are seen as men, they are dead. It’s life and death. They cannot come out into the open. It’s a question of life and death. That triggered everything. So we began to have a picture.\n\nCROWE: Were you daunted by the tone?\n\nWILDER: Not really. I was asked by [producer David O.] Selznick what I was working on. I told him it was a comedy set in the 20s, in the era of Prohibition, based around the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre. He said, “Oh my God, you’re not doing a comedy with murder? They’re going to crucify you. They’re going to walk out in droves! It’s just going to be embarrassing.” I told him, “I’m going to take a little chance here.” We would be careful and delicate about it, but . . . that’s the picture. It was set around the massacre, and that’s the way it was. We did some comedy at the top, then Saint Valentine’s Day, the massacre, and they swallowed it because they were with me already. The two guys, Lemmon and [Tony] Curtis, up on the stage playing those instruments . . . that set the mood that allowed us to spill a little blood.\n\nWe were pretty sure it would be a good comedy. What we did not know was that it would be a great comedy. That we did not know. . . .\n\nAfter Seven Year Itch, I said, “I’ll never work with [Monroe] again.” But then I was delighted when I heard that she had read the script and she would like to do Some Like It Hot. I wanted to have Mitzi Gaynor or somebody like this. It’s wonderful that Monroe wanted to do the part [she plays the ukulele in the all-girl band]. We had a big, big bomb there in that cannon that we could shoot off. We would not have had that sex thing. And, you know, those are the funny things that happen, where you stumble onto something that not everybody would have thought of.\n\nCROWE: And it makes the movie.\n\nWILDER: And you get very, very proud of yourself, and that was the situation.\n\nThere was, for instance, the situation where Tony Curtis steals the clothes of the guy and plays now Mr. Shell [a phony oil millionaire]. The Shell family, do you remember? And he now gets also the boat of Mr. Joe E. Brown, who is dancing somewhere with Mr. Lemmon [who, in drag, is being romanced by Brown]. You have two things going there. Now, Joe E. Brown, dancing a tango with Lemmon, that’s going to be good, I knew that. We had that cold, the dips, and the rose in the teeth, you know.\n\nCROWE: Is that the kind of moment you’d already acted out in the room, writing with Izzy [I. A. L. Diamond]?\n\nWILDER: [Shakes his head immediately.] No, we just knew it.\n\nNow, when we were writing, we got a very good idea, a very important part of the picture. The idea was that he, Curtis, invites Monroe back to the boat of Mr. Shell. And it’s all set up, they’re alone. Now there’s going to be sex, right? I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking, This is no good, this is expected. But what we will do is that [sparkle in his eye] he plays it impotent! And she suggests the sex. And she fucks him—that has to be better. It must be better to be subdued, seduced, and screwed by Marilyn Monroe—what could be better? So we switched this thing around. And we had the scene, right? I came in the morning before we filmed. I just said, “Look—we are now at the situation where he takes her to the boat. There’s nothing new here. But how about this?”\n\nNow, we set it up, it was just like picking oranges, you know. Because it was just all there. And now we can say what his family spent a fortune on, trying to cure him. “We tried Javanese dancers with bells on, we had every goddamn thing, and every doctor—it doesn’t work.” [Laughs.] And she says, “May I try?” And then they try. And you know his real feelings by what happens to his leg, as it goes up, the leg goes up, and she’s kissing him. “How is that?” she says. “I don’t know,” he says. And up goes the leg. She says, “Let me give it another try, just one more thing.” Now we lose them and we know what happens. So the idea, that made that scene. Because otherwise it’s just too flat. [Wilder still marvels at the scene.] She’s kissing him, and Curtis is lying there on the couch. Kissing him, with the camera here, and now you see the leg coming up, in back of her. Wonderful!\n\nCROWE: And the leg is so important, it’s the final touch.\n\nWILDER: Absolutely, yes.\n\nCROWE: The leg is everything. And did that come in the rehearsals, or was that part of the idea?\n\nWILDER: That was part of the writing. It was easy. It just came. . . .\n\nThe final scene of Some Like It Hot we wrote on a weekend in the studio. We just did not have it. We had the guys escaping, jumping into the motorboat of Mr. Joe E. Brown. And a little dialogue between Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis. And then we came to the unmasking, when Jack Lemmon says, “You know I cannot marry you because . . . I smoke.” And finally he takes that wig off and says, “Look, I’m a man.” Now we needed a line [for Brown] and could not find it. But somewhere in the beginning of our discussion, Iz said, “Nobody’s perfect.” And I said, “Look, let’s go back to your line, ‘Nobody’s perfect.’ Let’s send it to the mimeograph department so that they have something, and then we’re going to really sit down and make a real funny last line.”\n\nWe never found the line, so we went with “Nobody’s perfect.” The audience just exploded at the preview in Westwood. This was also very funny, how you make pictures. We wrote it on Sunday, we shot it on Monday.\n\nNobody thought of Joe E. Brown. I had seen him in some silent pictures, but I did not know that he was around, and we were starting to cast. And Aud [Wilder’s wife, Audrey] and I and Iz and his wife were there at the opening-day ceremonies for the Dodgers at the Coliseum. There was a loudspeaker on the field behind home plate, and people talking, and now comes the next speaker and it’s Joe E. Brown. And I said, “That’s our guy. That’s the guy!” Nobody ever thought of him.\n\nSo I asked him, “Would you like to read?” “Would I? Of course I would.” He did the part, and shortly after, he died. He was an absolute surprise to people, to young people, because they’d never seen him. He had the biggest mouth in the world. He was the nicest guy.\n\nIt’s always very difficult for me to say, “This is mine and this is his,” always, except of course I have to give [Diamond] credit for “Nobody’s perfect.” Because that’s the thing they jump on, and I say, “That was a temporary line, suggested by Mr. Diamond.” And it wound up to be our funniest last line. I was asked by many people, “What is going to happen now? What happens now to Lemmon? What happens to his husband?” And I always said, “I have no idea.” “Nobody’s perfect.” Leave it up there on the screen. You cannot top that.\n\nFALLING IN LOVE WITH AUDREY HEPBURN . . . MORE MARILYN TROUBLE\n\nCROWE: I once heard this advice: When directing a romance, or a romantic comedy, a director must fall in love with his leading lady through the lens. “If you don’t, no one else will.“ How did it feel to direct Audrey Hepburn [who starred for Wilder in Sabrina and 1957’s Love in the Afternoon*]? Did you fall in love with her, through the lens?*\n\nWILDER: Of course. There was so much inside her, a feeling that communicated. But was she “sexy”? Off-camera, she was just an actress. She was very thin, a good person. Sometimes standing on the set she disappeared. But there was something very likable about her. You trusted her, this tiny person. When she stood before the cameras, she became Miss Audrey Hepburn. And she could put it on a little bit, the sexiness, and the effect was really something. For instance, in Sabrina, when she came back from Paris with the dress. There was gold in that picture. . . .\n\nCROWE: The opening shot of her in the tree is one of your best character introductions. It’s such a perfectly composed close-up, with Audrey Hepburn longing to be a part of the Larrabees’ ball. . . . It creates a spell that lasts the entire movie.\n\nWILDER: Yes, yes, sure, because you felt for the girl [Hepburn’s character, a chauffeur’s daughter, carries a torch for the playboy son of a rich family]. You fell in love with the girl immediately, barefoot as she was. . . . [Fond memories.] She was just sort of kibitzing with the father who was washing the car. And she was in love. It reminded you of when you were in love. But in the remake [Sydney Pollack’s 1995 version with Julia Ormond], there was a cold fish in that tree. She was not right, she was not in love.\n\nCROWE: Every year, it seems, somebody is heralded as the new Audrey Hepburn. Every new young actress is called the “next” Audrey Hepburn.\n\nWILDER: Again, that’s the element X that people have, or don’t have. You can meet somebody and you can be enchanted, and then you photograph them and it’s nothing. But she had it. And there will not be another. Today, there is Julia Roberts. She is quite capable, very funny. . . . I loved her instantly in Pretty Woman. But no actress should be expected to be Audrey Hepburn. That dress by Mr. Givenchy has already been filled.\n\nCROWE: I read the Humphrey Bogart biography written by his son. He quotes Bogart [who co-starred in Sabrina*] as saying about Audrey Hepburn, “Yeah, she’s great, if you can give her twenty-six takes.”*\n\nWILDER: [Surprised.] Twenty-six takes? Audrey Hepburn? Twenty-six, no. That was Marilyn Monroe, before we could get the line straight. Just a little line, like “Where’s that bourbon?” [from Some Like It Hot]. She couldn’t get it. That was 80 takes or something. You have to remember, when a man muffs a line, and they do it again and again and again, then you replace him, because he plays a small part. Marilyn was the star. She does the takes because it’s gonna be in the picture.\n\nCROWE: In the finished film, the “Where’s that bourbon?“ line is played on Marilyn Monroe’s back. Did you never really get it?\n\nWILDER: [Laughs at the specificity of the question.] Maybe we did it two ways. I just remember that we had about 50-plus takes, and there was the whole afternoon trying to get it, because she cried after every take, because she didn’t get it, and then she had to be made up again. And then also we lost the morning because she didn’t show up, and we lost the afternoon because she didn’t remember the line. And I had to get the line in that location, because a close-up [shot later] would stick out like a sore thumb. Then again later, for instance, in the scene on the beach with Tony Curtis in the blazer and cap, where he is the co-owner of Shell Oil, there she had a three-page dialogue scene—which we had to get quickly because there were marine planes taking off at 10-minute intervals. She got it the first take. That went in three minutes; we had the shot. She almost fainted.\n\nCROWE: But normally you wouldn’t spend that much time on a line like “Where’s that bourbon?“ if you knew it could be played on her back.\n\nWILDER: Then maybe I was just stupid. I was just kind of totally impressed with the thing [the line], or totally convinced that I had to have it on her forehead, or in her brain, and she had to say “Where’s that bourbon?” I don’t really know, but you don’t have to be that accurate, because this was not the only line that she missed in the two pictures. We spent quite a few takes getting “It’s me, Sugar!” I had signs painted on the door: IT’S. ME. SUGAR. “Action” would come and she would say, “It’s Sugar, me!” I took her to the side after about Take 50, and I said, “Don’t worry about it.” And she said, “Worry about what?” [Shakes head.] The 50th take, that was, and then there was the 51st, and the 52nd. . . . As I’ve said before, I’ve got an old aunt in Vienna who would say every line perfectly. But who would see such a picture? [Laughs.] She missed a lot of [lines, but] then again, when I have a three-page dialogue scene—boom!\n\nNOT WORKING WITH CARY GRANT . . . WORKING WITH HUMPHREY BOGART (BUT NOT LIKING IT)\n\nCROWE: The language and rhythms of your scripts are so specific, did you often give actors line readings? Would you perform the line for the actor, the way you wanted to hear it?\n\nWILDER: Yeah, but I am not a [Actors Studio artistic director Lee] Strasberg man. I am not an actor. I’m not even a born director. I became a director because so many of our scripts had been screwed up. . . . But I get along very, very well with actors, except when I work with sons of bitches like Mr. Bogart, who was a Warner Bros. man. [Wilder was then at Paramount.] He suddenly became available, he wanted a picture, and I had one, something called Sabrina [in which Bogart is the older, all-business brother of the playboy Audrey Hepburn’s character falls for]. But I wanted Cary Grant. I would always say, “Well, let’s get Cary Grant.”\n\nI had Cary Grant in mind for four of my pictures. He was a friend of mine, and I liked him enormously, and he liked me. But he was apprehensive; he did not want to be in new hands. . . . So [after Grant pulled out of Sabrina] I just said, “Look, take somebody that is older than Holden [as the playboy], and not so pretty.” Sam Cohn, the agent who suggested it to Bogart, said, “There’s a nice part in this picture with Audrey Hepburn.” But Bogart was used to having most of the pictures directed by [John] Huston, and they were drinking all the time. He did not like me, because in the very beginning, after the shooting, there was a little bit of drinking, like two or three martinis, in Holden’s dressing room. I forgot to invite him. He was all by himself, in the dressing room with the hairdresser who had to put that hairpiece on there. He was not part of the crowd. I finally went to invite him and he said, “No, thank you very much.”\n\nI rewrote [the role] for him. I would have a little rewrite. I would bring him the scene. He looks at it and says, “How old is your daughter?” I said, “My daughter is about seven.” “Did she write that?” But very loud, you know. And he wanted a big laugh. He was new at Paramount. I was an old hand. He didn’t get a laugh, because everybody was on my side. He was a shit. Because he knew that I wanted to have Cary Grant. And also because I did not invite him with a big flask of gin. He probably would not have come if I’d asked him, but the fact that I did not ask him, he never forgot.\n\nSo now, Mr. Bogart. When we were finished with the shooting, we had a little party there. He did not come. Then I hear that he’s got cancer, and then I hear from his wife, Lauren Bacall, that he would like to see me. I rushed over, and he was wonderful, absolutely wonderful, and he begged my pardon. And I said, “Forget it, this is not a British court ceremonial that we have. I fight with a lot of people.” It’s not true. [Shrugs and laughs.] But I told him that. And he had that incurable cancer and he was going very quickly, and the last memory of Bogart I have is, he was a wonderful guy, because that’s the way I saw him last. He was very good [in Sabrina], better than he thought he was. He liked to play the hero, and in the end, he was.\n\nI remember, the cameraman took me to the side and said, “You have to do something about the lights, because Bogart spits when he speaks. So don’t have the lights in the back there. The back light is terrible.” So I just warned the wardrobe woman who took care of Audrey Hepburn to be ready with a towel every time. But to do it discreetly.\n\nCROWE: I have a question about Cary Grant, your friend. In the books I’ve read about you, I find that you can really fight for an actor that you want. Cary Grant was so right for your material. Why didn’t you fight harder to get him?\n\nWILDER: As a matter of fact, [Bogart in Sabrina is} even better casting than Cary Grant, because Cary Grant young could have played the part of Bill Holden. Bogart was a businessman. You don’t think that this guy is all business, but he was.\n\nBut, yeah, with this Cary Grant —I always wanted to work with him. I wanted him to play the part that Gary Cooper played in Love in the Afternoon. It would have been wonderful, right? “Cannot do it . . . please don’t. Don’t persist. Look, I like you, Wilder, but I cannot explain it. I just . . . the wrong signals come up in me.”\n\nCROWE: Did you feel he loved your movies?\n\nWILDER: Yeah. He loved my movies. He called me after Some Like It Hot and congratulated me that Curtis had done a wonderful imitation. No, he was very nice, he was absolutely great. But he was a very, very peculiar man, and he was very stingy. Stingy, Mr. Cary Grant. We had a dinner party at our apartment, and then after dinner we went to my den, where I have my radio and my television. I started playing for him a recording by a German composer, a medieval hymn of instruments and of voices. Orff was the name of the composer. [The piece was Carmina Burana.] It was very, very strong and very loud. So he sits there, and he says, “How much is your loudspeaker? How much is your phonograph?” So, knowing how stingy he is, I say, “A hundred and eleven dollars.” So he calls his wife: “Barbara! This machine here! We are crazy, we are crazy. We paid 215!” [Laughs.] He says, “Now, tell me, those two loudspeakers. Tell me, are they included in the $111?” And I say, “No, they were extra.” He says, “How much?” “Sixty-five apiece.” “Barbara!!! Barbara!!!“ [Laughs.] He was absolutely . . . [Shakes head with wonder.] I’ve never seen it, but I understand he had a room in the basement that was filled with gold cigarette cases. He would buy them and throw them down there. A pile of gold. Very, very nice guy otherwise.\n\nWITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION . . . DIETRICH AND GARBO: NOT THAT GREAT\n\nCROWE: Another quote from you on screenwriting. “The second-act curtain hunches the end of the picture.”\n\nWILDER: Yes, but not just the end. You’d better have another twist in the third act—like the twist in Witness for the Prosecution [a courtroom drama based on an Agatha Christie play, made in 1957]. There’s another end, you know? You expect that it’s all over. No. Now comes the end. In Double Indemnity, I followed everything very logically. I did not have any other possibility. It was not a detective story, where you follow the detective and you know everything he knows. I played with open cards. In Witness, we did a complete switch, right? And they went for it.\n\nCROWE: The character Marlene Dietrich plays in Witness for the Prosecution is one of the most unsympathetic roles a woman could have played—until the end. [Dietrich plays the wife of an accused murderer who herself comes under suspicion.] Getting an actress to do that must have taken some persuading.\n\nWILDER: Yeah, it took some, but that she liked. She likes to play a murderess, she likes to do anything that is action. She was, I think, a little bit embarrassed when she played the love scenes. I think that she was a little bit embarrassed for her privacy because she just thought, I would not do it. I would do it, but not for people. I don’t know, she was just strange. But she kind of captured the audience with the way she was—the way she wore clothes, for instance. She was some model there. But I don’t think she was as good an actress. Then again, I didn’t think that Garbo was a great actress. She just always did the same, kind of half-asleep thing. Never angry. She was always holding the arm like this [does Garbo]. But it was Garbo. I just think that Marlene played [the part] quite well.\n\nCROWE: You don’t see any of her plot moves coming.\n\nWILDER: No. If it were an American, or it was just another actress . . . [Shakes head, as if to say, “It would be a much different story.“] But those stars, they don’t exist anymore.\n\nTHE APARTMENT . . . PREVIEWING NINOTCHKA\n\nCROWE: I want to show you some photos. Here’s one from The Apartment. It looks like the studio commissary, a picture of you and Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and I. A. L. Diamond. A great team, and you all look like you’re having fun. Was that the situation making the movie?\n\nWILDER: Not with everybody. That was a very lucky and happy picture, The Apartment. Also, at one time, halfway through, Aud, my wife, came on the set. She never comes on the set, but she came, so Shirley MacLaine takes her on the side and says, “Does Billy really think this is going to be good?” She was not sure at first. [The film is a very adult romance about a corporate flunky, Lemmon, whose apartment is used for trysts by his married bosses.]\n\nCROWE: Who wrote the last line in The Apartment—“Shut up and deal“—you or I. A. L. Diamond?\n\nWILDER: [Famously cagey on the subject of which collaborator wrote which lines, Wilder eyes me evenly.] “Shut up and deal“? I don’t remember. Could have been Iz. Could have been me. [Pause.] We had that gin game in the plot—when [MacLaine, as Lemmon’s love interest, is] recovering from her suicide attempt, they played gin, and the game’s not finished—and we didn’t want to have a kiss, and we didn’t want to have something too sweet. But we had a very good steppingstone for the last scene. We had planted somewhere that he once attempted suicide, with a gun, but he did not quite know how to handle it and shot himself in the knee. So we knew that he had a gun. Then we also planted there that it’s in his luggage, which he’s packing up because he’s going back to Cincinnati, or wherever. We also planted there that Dr. Dreyfuss brings him a bottle of champagne. So we had that thing, you remember, it was at midnight, the lights go out. It’s New Year’s Eve. Mr. Fred MacMurray [playing Lemmon’s boss, who has been having an affair with MacLaine’s character], by this time, is divorced. He’s popped the question to Shirley MacLaine, finally, finally, finally. Then when the lights go on, she’s gone. We used that trick that at midnight all the lights go out. Now, she’s running [from MacMurray to Lemmon], she’s running and running and running to the apartment. And we know that it’s . . . that could be the ending, right?\n\nCROWE: Right—\n\nWILDER: [Lemmon] could be standing in the window and wave at her, or he opens the door and she kisses him. We didn’t want to have that ending, that kiss ending. We had that good idea of she’s running, and now she hears a shot. And now, we don’t know yet, but she thinks, My God, he wanted to commit suicide on account of another girl, but maybe this time he’s not gonna hit his knee! So she hurries up much more, and she’s faster and faster, and she gets to his door, and she knocks. He opens it and he’s got the bottle of champagne foaming over [grinning], which it always does when you shake it. So, “Oh God, thank God,” but still no kiss. But he wants to ask her, “What’s the matter?” “Nothing, let’s finish the gin game.” They’ve got the cards there, still down on the table. And he asks her something amorous.\n\nCROWE: He says, “I love you, Miss Kubelik.”\n\nWILDER: “I love you.” Then she says, “Shut up and deal.” And he deals the whole deck, you know, not just 10 cards.\n\nCROWE: The kiss would have been too romantic, too sweet.\n\nWILDER: Yeah. It’s not an ending like “Nobody’s perfect.” But then again, not every ending’s perfect. But it was not too schmaltzy.\n\nCROWE: What were the first previews like for The Apartment? What was it like showing that picture to the public for the first time?\n\nWILDER: [Pause.] I’ll tell you my best story, which has something to do with previews. We were previewing Ninotchka, and Lubitsch took the writers along, too, in Long Beach. And they are outside in the lobby there, a stack of cards, with the audience invited to put down their thoughts. So the picture starts playing, and it plays very well. Now Lubitsch takes the cards, a heap of the cards, doesn’t let anybody else touch them. We get into the big MGM limousine. We turn the lights up. Now, so, he takes the preview cards and he starts reading. “‘Very good’ . . . ‘brilliant’ . . .” Twenty cards. But when he comes to the 21st card, he starts laughing as hard as I ever saw him laugh, and we say, “What is it?” He keeps the cards to himself, he does not let anybody even look. Then, finally, he calms down a little and starts reading. And what he read was—I have the card—“Funniest picture I ever saw. So funny that I peed in my girlfriend’s hand.” [Laughs.]\n\nMENTOR . . . RIVALS . . . PARTNERS\n\nCROWE: It’s been analyzed quite a bit by others, but what was “the Lubitsch touch” to you?\n\nWILDER: It was the elegant use of the Superjoke. You had a joke, and you felt satisfied, and then there was one more big joke on top of it. The joke you didn’t expect. That was the Lubitsch touch. To think as he did, that is a goal worth having. Collaborating with him, he would have many questions. “What are you going to do with this story point?” “Let’s find some way to say this differently.”\n\nCROWE: Who were your rivals back in the 40s, 50s?\n\nWILDER: Preston Sturges, who was the first writer who just freed himself and became a director [The Lady Eve, Sullivan’s Travels]. Joe Mankiewicz [All About Eve, A Letter to Three Wives]. Then Norman Krasna—he did comedies [White Christmas, Let’s Make Love]. Then Claude Binyon [Holiday Inn, This Is the Army]. There were [other writing] teams, you know, but not [with one] as a director. Some of them tried it. But then they said, “Oh shit, this is too tough and this is no good.” Some of them made it, some of them did not make it.\n\nCROWE: Did you feel competitive with them?\n\nWILDER: No. We were very open, we talked about it. There were very few. Some found it difficult to get into the dialogue, but it was fine. There were 104 writers under contract at Paramount at the same time. There was a Writers Building, a Writers Annex Building, and a Writers Annex Annex Building. There were many scripts that were never made, you know. Finished, but they were never made. We made 50 pictures a year then. But we wrote 150.\n\nCROWE: How would you describe your first screenwriting partner, Charles Brackett?\n\nWILDER: Brackett [in addition to their work for Lubitsch, Wilder and Brackett wrote The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard] was a very loquacious man. He was kind of a member of the Algonquin Round Table. That was his milieu. (A) He was a Republican, a rabid Republican. (B) He was in the forefront of writers of the class of Hemingway, of Scott Fitzgerald—those were the people that he knew. And he learned very quickly, because he wrote some short stories for The Saturday Evening Post, and that’s how he got into movies. And he was just kind of hanging around Paramount and did not know what the hell to do.\n\nManny Wolf, the man who was the head of the writing department, he got the two of us together. Introduced me and said, “Now you two go and talk to Mr. Lubitsch, and see whether he likes you.” So we talked, and we go to Lubitsch, and about half an hour later we had the job of Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife. It was not a very good picture, but it was kind of all right. And then he wanted us again for Ninotchka.\n\nBut with Brackett . . . we had nothing in common except writing. We did get along. We just never saw each other, or very rarely, after the shooting or after the writing, for dinner. We never did that.\n\nCROWE: How did it end with Brackett?\n\nWILDER: I always used to say, the surface of the matchbook had worn down. We were having a discussion one day in a car, parked at the studio. Nothing to do with pictures—a personal discussion about his grandson, I think. Then it turned. He kind of flew off the handle. He just . . . [Pauses, admits thoughtfully:] I kind of made him dismiss me. And that was how it ended. Then he came back, and I was already with someone else, collaborating. But it ended with a discussion in my car that had grown loud. We spoke after, we were friends. He always wanted to come back. Then he was sick—he had a stroke—and we never came back together. [Brackett died in 1969 at the age of 76.] But it ended on a discussion of something personal.\n\nCROWE: But what about Diamond?\n\nWILDER: [Laughs.] I was with Iz Diamond for 20, 25 years. [Diamond died in 1988 at the age of 67.] We never talked about personal things. That was the beauty of it. I came in the morning; he came in the morning. He gets The Hollywood Reporter, and I get the Variety. Then we exchanged the trade papers, and then we said, “Now, where are we?” “Oh, yes . . .“ And then it goes on. He was a unique man, so unique.\n\nIt was not a collaboration like with Brackett, where he told me who his dentist is, kind of things that don’t belong, you know. But Iz Diamond was a very taciturn guy, my partner. It was wonderful to talk about dialogue, or about structure. He was always on the set with me.\n\nCROWE: And you liked it that way . . .\n\nWILDER: I liked it that way because there was . . . you know, the peculiar thing about Iz Diamond, whom I liked very much, like a younger brother, was his discretion. He was a very, very correct man. I am an accumulator, I am a collector. I cannot be in London, for instance, or Paris, for a day without buying something, be it an antique little piece, or shoes, or something. So I would be walking down the Burlington Arcade, and I would not even ask him anymore, “I’m going in here for a minute, would you like to come?” He would say, “No no no no, I stay outside.” [Laughs.] Now, of course, it’s not a minute, it’s an hour. And he waited outside. Then I come out with two big paper bags full of stuff. And he never did ask me, “What did you buy?”! Nothing. [Laughs.] Absolutely never asked me. [He grins, still marveling.] That’s wonderful.\n\nNOT GETTING PERSONAL . . . NOT MAKING SCHINDLER’S LIST . . . THE PRESSURE TO BE “WILDERESQUE”\n\nCROWE: It’s been theorized that you got part of your sense of humor from trying to make your mother laugh. Your mom, apparently, was a tough laugh to get.\n\nWILDER: She was a very tough laugh. My father was a rather easy laugh. My father had kind of everyday humor. He, for instance, would construct a joke. He would come out of the bathroom and I would say to him, “Dad, you forgot to button your pants” —in those days we had buttons—and he looked at me and said, “I have not. There is a law that you don’t know, my son, which says, ‘Where there is a corpse, the window must be open.’”\n\nCROWE: Here’s an observation that has been made about many great writers: There is sometimes a central event or a theme in their lives that they keep revisiting, reworking, and examining. Is that true of you?\n\nWILDER: [Shifts in chair.] No. Maybe some similar situation, or maybe the beginning of a situation, which I then developed in the picture.\n\nCROWE: I just wondered if there was a key event in your life that continued to inspire you.\n\nWILDER: To do something better than I did the last time. [Pause.] But my life was kind of . . . Except for the fact that three-quarters of my family was extinguished in Auschwitz, I don’t really think that . . . [Wilder considers this, the first inescapably personal question of our interviews. He decides to keep it at arm’s length.]\n\nCROWE: I wanted to ask you about Schindler’s List. I’ve read that you wanted to make this your last picture, but Spielberg already had the rights.\n\nWILDER: Yeah, that made him take it. [Laughs.] I wanted to do it. We spoke about it. He was a gentleman, of course, and we acknowledged each other’s strong desires. In the end, he could not give it up. He had to do it. I would have done it differently—not necessarily better. I wanted to do it as a kind of memorial to my mother and my grandmother and my stepfather. Spielberg was always a wonderful director. When he was 12 years old he was a wonderful director. Especially pictures that were for children. I think there were a lot of things in E.T. that were very, very funny, especially when E.T. gets drunk. But Schindler’s List—it would have been something of my heart, you know.\n\nCROWE: If someone were to look over all your films, which would be the more personal ones? Is there one that stands out to you, the one that really felt closest to your heart?\n\nWILDER: You know, I make a picture and then I forget about it. I don’t have a print, I don’t have a cassette. I have a script at the office, in case I would like to look. Which is the best picture I have ever seen? My answer always is Battleship Potemkin [1925], by [Sergei] Eisenstein.\n\nCROWE: How about a best picture of yours?\n\nWILDER: I used to say, “The next one.” [Laughs.] I’m not doing any more.\n\nCROWE: [Pressing.] But I wondered if there was one. You said that if you had made Schindler’s List it would have been very personal for you. Of the movies that you did make, which one feels the most complete? Which one feels the closest to who you are?\n\nWILDER: The picture maybe that has the fewest faults, obvious faults, would be The Apartment. But I like the end result in Some Like It Hot. It was a very successful picture. Or maybe this and Sunset Boulevard. It really caught them unaware. Nobody expected a picture like it. And it’s very difficult to make a picture in Hollywood about Hollywood. Because they really scrutinize you.\n\nCROWE: And the characters you felt closest to?\n\nWILDER: I liked William Holden in Stalag 17. Perfect. I liked having him around. I would maybe like to have been Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot. [Laughs.] Norma Desmond, very much. And Sabrina. [Pause.] I liked that. It’s a very, very mild picture, compared with some of the other pictures.\n\nCROWE: Mild in what way?\n\nWILDER: Mild in the love scenes, you know, because I don’t think she exudes a long sexual history. She was Miss Audrey Hepburn. Now it comes out that she had love stories, secret rendezvous and stuff. I had no idea. I never had any desire of having an affair with any woman during the picture, because I’m so intrigued by the picture itself. The film does not give me any time. But sometimes your vision is altered. I was attracted to Swanson. I was attracted to Barbara Stanwyck. Yeah, they are there, these things. But that is all on the screen. You are attracted to something which is on the screen, and this just means you are doing a good job."
