    "text": "CROWE: I wanted to ask you about Schindler’s List. I’ve read that you wanted to make this your last picture, but Spielberg already had the rights.\n\nWILDER: Yeah, that made him take it. [Laughs.] I wanted to do it. We spoke about it. He was a gentleman, of course, and we acknowledged each other’s strong desires. In the end, he could not give it up. He had to do it. I would have done it differently—not necessarily better. I wanted to do it as a kind of memorial to my mother and my grandmother and my stepfather. Spielberg was always a wonderful director. When he was 12 years old he was a wonderful director. Especially pictures that were for children. I think there were a lot of things in E.T. that were very, very funny, especially when E.T. gets drunk. But Schindler’s List—it would have been something of my heart, you know.\n\nCROWE: If someone were to look over all your films, which would be the more personal ones? Is there one that stands out to you, the one that really felt closest to your heart?\n\nWILDER: You know, I make a picture and then I forget about it. I don’t have a print, I don’t have a cassette. I have a script at the office, in case I would like to look. Which is the best picture I have ever seen? My answer always is Battleship Potemkin [1925], by [Sergei] Eisenstein.\n\nCROWE: How about a best picture of yours?\n\nWILDER: I used to say, “The next one.” [Laughs.] I’m not doing any more.\n\nCROWE: [Pressing.] But I wondered if there was one. You said that if you had made Schindler’s List it would have been very personal for you. Of the movies that you did make, which one feels the most complete? Which one feels the closest to who you are?\n\nWILDER: The picture maybe that has the fewest faults, obvious faults, would be The Apartment. But I like the end result in Some Like It Hot. It was a very successful picture. Or maybe this and Sunset Boulevard. It really caught them unaware. Nobody expected a picture like it. And it’s very difficult to make a picture in Hollywood about Hollywood. Because they really scrutinize you.\n\nCROWE: And the characters you felt closest to?\n\nWILDER: I liked William Holden in Stalag 17. Perfect. I liked having him around. I would maybe like to have been Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot. [Laughs.] Norma Desmond, very much. And Sabrina. [Pause.] I liked that. It’s a very, very mild picture, compared with some of the other pictures.\n\nCROWE: Mild in what way?\n\nWILDER: Mild in the love scenes, you know, because I don’t think she exudes a long sexual history. She was Miss Audrey Hepburn. Now it comes out that she had love stories, secret rendezvous and stuff. I had no idea. I never had any desire of having an affair with any woman during the picture, because I’m so intrigued by the picture itself. The film does not give me any time. But sometimes your vision is altered. I was attracted to Swanson. I was attracted to Barbara Stanwyck. Yeah, they are there, these things. But that is all on the screen. You are attracted to something which is on the screen, and this just means you are doing a good job."
