    "text": "Legendary director Billy Wilder will be remembered by Hollywood with a screening of excerpts of his best work and tributes from his friends in the film industry.\n\nTony Curtis, who starred in Wilder's hit Some Like It Hot, and Kevin Spacey will be among those to speak about Wilder at a memorial event that will take place on Wednesday.\n\nThe event will also include a montage of clips from some of his best-loved films, which also include Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard. Wilder, who was 95, won seven Oscars in his career and was regarded as one of Hollywood's greatest ever directors and was nominated for a further 14 Academy Awards. He died of pneumonia at his home in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, 27 March. No funeral service or public service was held. The memorial event is being organised by two of the biggest unions in Hollywood, the Directors' Guild of America and the Writers' Guild of America."
