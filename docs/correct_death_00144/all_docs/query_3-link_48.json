    "text": "Film director Billy Wilder dies at 95\n\nLOS ANGELES â€” Oscar-winning filmmaker Billy Wilder, the Austrian-born cynic whose gifts for writing and directing led to such classics as \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Double Indemnity,\" has died. He was 95.\n\nWilder died Wednesday night at his home, said George Schlatter, a producer and longtime friend. Schlatter said his friend of 40 years had been in failing health in recent months and he believed Wilder had been suffering from a bout with pneumonia.\n\n\"We've lost a biggie,\" Schlatter, producer of the 1960s comedy show \"Laugh In,\" said yesterday. \"I met him when I was just a kid, you know. And I was a fan all that time.\"\n\nAs co-writer, director and producer of the 1960 film \"The Apartment,\" Wilder collected three Oscars, the only person to do so for one film until James Cameron won three for 1997's \"Titanic.\"\n\nAmong his other classics: \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"Double Indemnity,\" \"Stalag 17,\" \"The Lost Weekend,\" \"The Seven Year Itch,\" \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Witness for the Prosecution.\"\n\nHis wry commentaries on the dark side of authority, love and fame influenced many contemporary filmmakers such as Cameron Crowe, Steven Soderbergh and Curtis Hanson.\n\n\"His mind and personality were so strong it was easy to be lulled into thinking he'd go on forever,\" said Hanson, director of \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Wonder Boys.\" \"As a man he was witt irreverent of course, but he was also a humanist.\"\n\nShirley MacLaine, who was in her mid-20s when she co-starred in \"The Apartment,\" said he was an important influence on her career.\n\n\"The great master is finished here,\" she said. \"He will write and direct another masterpiece in heaven. I learned more from him than anyone else.\"\n\nWilder was also noted as one of Hollywood's best wits. He once remarked of postwar France: \"It's a country where you can't tear the toilet paper but the currency crumbles in your hands.\" William Holden said Wilder had \"a mind full of razor blades.\"\n\nHis films were notable for their clever dialogue and an overlay of cynicism and betrayal. His actors won Oscars for their hard-bitten portrayals: Ray Milland as the unremitting alcoholic in \"The Lost Weekend,\" Holden as the suspected prison-camp traitor in \"Stalag 17,\" Walter Matthau as an insurance cheater in \"The Fortune Cookie.\"\n\nCareer profile Films by Billy Wilder include:\n\nAs writer: People on Sunday, 1929 Emil and the Detectives, 1931 Adorable, 1933 One Exciting Adventure, 1934 Music in the Air, 1934 Lottery Lover, 1935 Champagne Waltz, 1937 Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, 1938 Midnight, 1939 What a Life, 1939 Ninotchka, 1939 Rhythm of the River, 1940 Arise My Love, 1940 Hold Back the Dawn, 1941 Ball of Fire, 1942 A Song Is Born, 1948 Casino Royale, 1967\n\nAs writer-director, many also as producer: The Major and the Minor, 1942 Five Graves to Cairo, 1943 Double Indemnity, 1944 The Lost Weekend, 1945 The Emperor Waltz, 1948 A Foreign Affair, 1948 Sunset Boulevard, 1950 Ace in the Hole (also known as The Big Carnival), 1951 Stalag 17, 1953 Sabrina, 1954 The Seven Year Itch, 1955 The Spirit of St. Louis, 1957 Love in the Afternoon, 1957 Witness for the Prosecution, 1958 Some Like It Hot, 1959 The Apartment, 1960 One, Two, Three, 1961 Irma la Douce, 1963 Kiss Me Stupid, 1964 The Fortune Cookie, 1966 The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 1970 Avanti! 1972 The Front Page, 1974 Fedora, 1978 Buddy Buddy, 1981.\n\n\"Making movies is a little like walking into a dark room,\" he once mused. \"Some people stumble across furniture, others break their legs, but some of us see better in the dark than others. The ultimate trick is to convince, persuade. Every single person out there is an idiot, but collectively they're a genius.\"\n\nAfter directing Marilyn Monroe in her two best comedies, \"The Seven Year Itch\" and \"Some Like It Hot,\" Wilder said he would never again direct the chronically tardy star.\n\n\"I have discussed this with my doctor and my psychiatrist and my accountant, and they tell me I am too old and too rich to go through this again,\" he said.\n\nThe Wilder career peaked with \"The Apartment,\" a cynical tale of corporate corruption. Jack Lemmon played an underling who lends his apartment to company executives for trysts with secretaries. MacLaine was the romantic victim of a lying boss, Fred MacMurray, in a rare change of type (his other: \"Double Indemnity\").\n\nWilder continued filming for 20 years, but except for the 1963 \"Irma La Douce,\" he never duplicated his previous successes. The films after \"The Apartment\": \"One, Two, Three,\" \"Kiss Me, Stupid,\" \"The Fortune Cookie,\" \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,\" \"Avanti!\" \"The Front Page,\" \"Fedora.\" His last film was \"Buddy Buddy\" in 1981 with Lemmon and Matthau.\n\nHe was born Samuel Wilder on June 22, 1906, in the small town of Sucha, 100 miles east of Vienna. The boy haunted theaters that played American films, and admired early stars like William S. Hart and Tom Mix.\n\nA first marriage to California socialite Judith Iribe ended in 1947 after nine years they had a daughter, Victoria.\n\nIn 1949, Wilder married a former starlet and band singer, Audrey Young. For many years they lived in a spacious penthouse apartment in Westwood, surrounded by works of Picasso, Miro and other masters. In 1989, more than 80 items from his collection were sold at auction for more than $30 million.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and daughter."
