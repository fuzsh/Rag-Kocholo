    "text": "Tonight, my heart is broken I have just found out that Sandra Warner passed away. Not only that, but she passed away 13th March 2022 age 87.\n\nLooking through the archives, it wasn’t posted here at the time and I’m just so sorry for her friends and family that this news didn’t reach the Marilyn community sooner, as I’m sure we would have all showered her memory with love.\n\nSandra Warner was one of the last remaining “Sweet Sue And Her Society Syncopators” from “Some Like It Hot.” She played Emily and most famously chirps “Toodle-ooh!” to Jack Lemmon’s character Daphne in the train sequence of the film… “How about that “Toodle-Oooh?!” Jerry/Daphne excitedly responds!\n\nNot only that, but she was Marilyn’s body double for all the promotional shots made for the movie after filming wrapped.\n\nSpeaking in 2001, Warner said:\n\n“Marilyn and I were very round. I was a little taller than her, but I fit into her wardrobe.. and because she was pregnant, I was asked to do her publicity stills. Most of the albums, or wherever you see marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, they would use my body and Marilyn’s face… and it worked out perfectly, it couldn’t have been better and I enjoyed doing it."
