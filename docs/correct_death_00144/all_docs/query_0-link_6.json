Prominent buyers include over 200 bookstores and other retailers as well as tens of thousands of Internet customers. Snapshots of the Past was selected as a vendor for the White House redecoration project of 2008.\n\n[American Memory] A great revolution in the history of poster prints was the development of printing techniques that allowed for inexpensive, mass production. Notably, lithography, was invented in 1796. In 1989 a Library of Congress pilot project aptly titled American Memory laid the foundation for the National Digital Library Program which began in 1995. This program works to digitize selected collections of the Library that emphasize the complex history of an American cultural heritage.\n\n[Museum Quality] Reproduction prints are created using some of the most respected brands of fine art and archival paper in the industry. Prints made with archival paper and pigmented inks can be enjoyed for a lifetime and passed down for generations to come.\n\n[Great Gifts] Wouldn't it be a conversation starter to display an old Halloween, Mother's or Valentine's Day poster? Or one of the earliest aerial views of Manhattan, Boston, Chicago or San Francisco? Posters in the retro style add an air of elegance to your home, study or workplace. And they make great gifts."
