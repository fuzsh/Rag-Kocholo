    "text": "BEVERLY HILLS - Billy Wilder was 75 years old when I met him in his Los Angeles office. At first glance, he reminded me of people that I knew many years ago in Haifa: witty, energetic, cynical, curious, impatient - very Jewish. He observed me with what I interpreted as an amused look. By then he was probably less brilliant than he had been when he wrote and directed 25 movies, some of them among the best ever produced in Hollywood. It didn't even occur to me - and, I assume, certainly not to him - that he would not be allowed to direct another movie. For 21 years, the clever heads of Hollywood studios did not let one of the industry's true geniuses take the helm of another project.\n\nWilder's movies entertained hundreds of millions of viewers and helped to shape their opinions about the world. To this very day, I still remember where I watched \"Some Like it Hot\" and \"Stalag 17\" for the first time. However, when I sat across from the famous director, on a blue California morning about 20 years ago, I felt very far away from Haifa of the 1950s. The \"Hundred Years War\" forced upon the State of Israel by the Arabs was being waged, that year, on enemy territory, in the heart of Beirut. Hard video images, not unlike the current ones, appeared day and night on countless TV sets all over the world, the Israeli public-relations effort was much clumsier than the current one, and Wilder looked somewhat surprised when I chose to open the interview - which was written, but never published - with the other, tougher reality. But then, how could I ask him to talk only about the movies?\n\n\"I don't feel good about [the siege on] Beirut,\" he said and lit a huge cigar, \"but my heart is with the soldiers. I cross my fingers for them. The problem is that the bloody reports on television create a huge residue of fury among the non-Jewish viewers. I wish it wasn't so. However, if [then prime minister Menachem] Begin thinks that Israel must do it in order to survive - all power to him! What really bothers me is that Israel, with its erudite and intelligent society, have the worst PR in the world. The Arabs invest billions of dollars in an attempt to present the Israelis as killers of babies and people who starve whole populations, while the Israeli side of the story is seldom being heard.\n\n\"I would have liked someone to explain to me, for instance, how the problem will be solved if we take the cancer from Beirut and transfer it to Damascus or Riyadh. It seems to me that this isn't the way Israel used to wage wars. In the past, you did it like the Russian. When the Russians had a problem in Czechoslovakia or Hungary, they came in with the army and tanks - and boom! boom! The whole world shouted with fury - but within four days everything was finished. In Lebanon it's been going on for two months already. When you talk to the average American, or to your non-Jewish wife, you feel disappointment, you sense their apprehension that the state, which always looked brilliant and sophisticated, is sinking into some kind of fanatical aggression, a cycle of an eye for an eye.\"\n\nIn the life of every nation comes a moment when it must muster its fanatical aggression in order to defend itself.\n\nWilder: \"But how can you put an end to this problem? Let's say that the Allies, during the early 1930s, when it became obviously clear that Hitler and his Nazi Party represented a grave danger, would have entered Berlin, captured Hitler and his SS men, and ordered - out! Sweden would have absorbed some of them, a few would have gone to Switzerland, others to Spain and Austria. This would have silenced Hitler?\"\n\nA bullet in the head would have silenced Hitler.\n\n\"I don't believe that the elimination of [Yasser] Arafat will solve the problem. In [the Palestinians'] ranks fight kids who were taught, since they were two years old, that they should destroy the State of Israel. This war [in Lebanon] is turning into a fanatic, religious war. They will always strive to take over Jerusalem. In 100 years, in 500 years, they would still want to do it. And you are bleeding.\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, there are exactly five minutes left to this soccer game. And after it's over, there will be other problems. The Palestine Liberation Organization won't bury the ax of war and won't stop plotting against Israel in some apartment in Damascus or a cellar in Baghdad. They will go on doing it, feverishly. And in the Houses of Representatives in the U.S., England and France, they will put the Palestinian problem under the microscope and appease and pamper the `moderate' Arab states at Israel's expense. I am afraid they'll want to weaken Israel. And where will you get the weapon systems for the next round? Where will the ammunition and aircrafts and food come from?\"\n\nWhat do you think is the main PR problem Israel has in the U.S.?\n\n\"The average American doesn't think about the problems in an orderly way. He feels them. In Begin and [Yitzhak] Shamir, with their funny accents, he sees Jews as they were portrayed in Vaudeville. And when he hears that Begin - a genius, as far as I'm concerned - vehemently rejects the idea that UN observers will help the separation of the forces in Lebanon - he doesn't understand it. Why reject it? Do they want to shoot them while they evacuate? Do they want to pass them between two lines of tanks and ridicule and curse them? Something here is not kosher. The average American is afraid that the Israelis with the funny accents may drag the world into a World War III.\"\n\nHow would you create a better image for Israel?\n\n\"I don't know. It's like finding a cure for the common cold. It seems to me that you desperately need a few good people that will be - to use a term from the movie business - blockbusters. People that will be able to sell the Israeli version of the conflict to the American people. Right now, it seems to me, the Americans aren't buying. They are worried.\"\n\nGerman past\n\nTell me about Germany. I understand you left in 1933.\n\n\"On January 30, 1933, when Hitler was elected chancellor, I was at a ski resort in Switzerland. When I came back to Berlin, someone wearing the uniform of the Nazi Party was sitting behind my desk. All of a sudden, they all came out of the closets. I remember myself sitting in some coffee shop and watching, utterly helpless, 10 SS men beating an old Jewish man. The danger became very real. People started to disappear. A day after the Reichstag was burned, I left for Paris and from there to America. My mother and my grandmother were killed in Auschwitz.\"\n\nDid you understand, at that point, that there was going to be a terrible disaster?\n\n\"No one knew. I'm sure that here and there, a few ambassadors reported to their governments that the Germans were killing the Jews, but no one protested. No one wanted to know. By the way, it will happen again. Not under the same circumstances. Anti-Semitism will not become the law of the land. No government will give an order to eliminate the Jews. This is unthinkable. But in a different way - it will happen. Anti-Semitism is a time bomb. It depends on what will trigger the bomb this time, what dramatic event will bring them back, marching in the streets.\"\n\nHow do you remember Hollywood in the 1930s?\n\n\"A very different place, a very fast and vital city. There were six or seven huge studios that employed hundreds of writers, directors and actors and produced 50 or 60 movies a year. Clark Gable earned $5,000 a week - then it was a lot of money - and appeared in three movies a year. No one talked about interest rates or completion fees. Everybody talked about movies, themes, stars, locations - not about finances and deals. Now they throw a party not because the movie won an Oscar, but because at long last they managed to finance it. Now it takes me a full year to raise the money for the movie, and by the time I close the deal, I'm so exhausted that I need to go on vacation even before I shoot one foot of film.\"\n\nThe movies that Hollywood produced during those years made the U.S. the most popular country in the world.\n\n\"And Washington always hated it for that. Hollywood turned into the biggest and most important PR agency in America, the American movies made a huge impression all over the world, but the politicians screwed Hollywood any time they could. They always attached to Hollywood all those silly myths about wild parties and sex scandals, as if precisely the same kinds of things do not happen, all the time, within the dentist's community in Albany, N.Y. They forced the big studios to give up their share in the movie theaters. They wouldn't dare demand the same thing from the oil companies. When they had a chance to knock Hollywood with [Senator Joseph] McCarthy and the blacklists - they did it.\"\n\nWere you, too, attacked by McCarthy?\n\n\"Oh, yes. They had a list of 3,000 suspected members of the Communist Party. Of course I was included. I would have been very insulted had I not been included. They searched desperately for any sign of communist propaganda in my movies. They found none.\"\n\nRoulette with 360 numbers\n\nYou once said that the script is 80 percent of the movie.\n\n\"What I meant to say was that a mediocre director won't manage to ruin a good script and that even a great director can't save a bad one. That's the heart of the matter. A talented and imaginative director leaves his unique stamp even on popular material like `Star Wars' or `E.T.,' and makes movies that earn hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nHow do you explain the success of such movies?\n\n\"Television. America's senior citizens are afraid of the dark. They tend not to leave their homes. They are glued to their television sets. The young crave leaving their houses and going to the movies. As a director, you must find a theme that will work on audiences between the ages of six and 23. If you are blessed with this magic touch - the way Steven Spielberg is - you are all set. Sophisticated comedies in the style directed by Ernest Lubitsch don't have an audience nowadays. A Lubitsch movie, even one produced for only $12 million, won't break even. That's why they prefer to produce `Rocky IV' and `Rocky V' - movies that prove they have an audience - rather then take risks with new material. Today, if you have $10 million, you are better off investing the money in government bonds, rather than lose it in the movies.\n\n\"In this business, we're playing roulette not with 36 numbers, but with 360 numbers. What drives everybody are the huge wins - 50 times the original investment. However, while some movies draw $300 million, others stumble by the roadside and nobody sees them. At this point the whole movie industry is in a waiting mode. What will happen? Does the future lie with cable? With satellites? With the small movie theaters? Or maybe with pay TV?\n\n\"Personally, and regretfully, in the autumn of my life, not only do I think that the movie industry isn't finished - I am convinced that we barely scratched the surface. At the end of the day, after the new formats will be created, everybody will come back to us, the artists and the creators. After all, what's the use in a state-of-the-art oven if you don't have a chef who knows how to cook?\"\n\nDo you sometimes watch your old movies?\n\n\"Sometimes. Mainly when I'm being honored with a special retrospective of my movies. I hate to see my old movies. I always want to re-edit them and, if possible, redirect them, too. When you reproduce an old, good play, the actors move and talk in a different pace. The dialogue may be the same, but the pace and approach in most cases are entirely different. When you watch your old movies, you see them the way you directed them 30 years ago and you mumble to yourself repeatedly, `God, why is it so slow? Come on, come on, cut already.' Movies are very much like airplanes. A perfectly designed airplane may crash during takeoff while another airplane, not so perfect, flies for many years.\"\n\nAfter 54 years in the movie business, do you have a theory that explains this phenomenon?\n\n\"If I had had such a theory, I would have been a very rich man. In this business you always deal with the unknown. You enter a dark room and stumble and break a leg. Some of us get used to the darkness faster than others, but [there is] no guarantee that the movie will work. That's what so beautiful about the movie business. It's very hard to know if you are bringing into the world a beautiful and bright child or an utter idiot.\"\n\nWhich of the movies you directed makes you especially proud?\n\n\"I'm proud that I kept my honesty, that I kept going on even after failures, that I didn't lose hope. I was lucky to always work with very talented artists, like Ernest Lubitsch, Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe.\"\n\nHow do remember Marilyn Monroe?\n\n\"Now, 20 years after her death, there is a tendency to color everything in rosy colors. She wasn't easy. With anyone. She was very strange, suffered from depression, sometimes wasn't able to work for days on end. She was an unstable woman. But she had a special quality that today no other star has.\n\n\"Today we don't have stars. All the rules of the game were changed. The question I asked myself today is, `Do I have enough power to force [myself] upon them and bring them to the movie theaters without changing my tune?' As a talented composer of waltzes - do I now start to write rock-'n-roll operas? I don't think so. I don't think I should start directing movies about spaceships. The subject simply doesn't interest me.\""
