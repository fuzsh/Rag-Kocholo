One was an immense, dreary heap in which a madwoman loses what's left of her shaky mind in the odd Hollywood-on-Hollywood movie he was writing and filming that year. The other was a steel-and-glass gem for him and his sharp, chic wife, Audrey, to live in. The former, owned by one of J. Paul Getty's ex-wives, was sweetened (or, perhaps better, further soured) for the occasion by Paramount's art director, Hans Dreier, and his team of set decorators, who added gloomy draperies and a few stained-glass windows to enhance the mansion's funereal air (see Architectural Digest, April 1998). The latter, with its clean angles and spare construction, was designed for the Wilders by their close friends Charles and Ray Eames. The musty, fusty mansion would be the architectural expression of its occupant's dreadfully declining state of mind. The Eames house would be all about clear light and air.\n\nThe madwoman, of course, is Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), the centerpiece of Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950), in which a blown-out tire sends a young screenwriter, Joe Gillis (William Holden), careening into the has-been star's driveway. \"It was a great big white elephant of a place,\" Gillis tells us in noirish voice-over—\"the kind crazy movie people built in the crazy twenties. A neglected house gets an unhappy look. This one had it in spades. It was like that old woman in Great Expectations—that Miss Havisham in her rotting wedding dress and her torn veil, taking it out on the world because she'd been given the go-by.\"\n\nWilder, along with his coscreenwriters, Charles Brackett and D. M. Marshman, Jr., had been cooking up Sunset Boulevard since late 1948. It's a film permeated by death and cobwebby insanity, from the corpse floating in Norma's pool to Norma's dead monkey laid out, as she puts it, \"on the massage table in front of the fire. He always liked fires, and poking at them with a stick!\" Wilder even wrote and shot an opening scene that featured talking cadavers in the L.A. County morgue, a comically macabre scene that was scrapped after preview audiences reacted badly to it.\n\nThe house the Eameses designed for the Wilders, in contrast, was to be as sleek and fresh and forward-looking as the couple themselves. Wilder was introduced to the Eames-es by the graphic designer Alvin Lustig, who was using the garage of Wilder's house on North Beverly Drive as a design studio. Wilder loved the elegant intelligence of the Eameses' designs and bought a prototype of the soon-to-be-iconic 1946 plywood chairs.\n\nWilder had moved into the house on North Beverly in the spring of 1944. He was still married to his first wife, Judith, but the relationship was getting even rockier than it had been all along. He launched an affair with the actress Doris Dowling, who played the prostitute, Gloria, in his film The Lost Weekend (1945), but soon began cheating on his new mistress with Audrey Young, a snappy big-band singer who also played a bit part in The Lost Weekend. In March 1947, after a year and a half of legal separation, Judith's divorce from Wilder was finalized. Doris Dowling moved to Rome, and Young moved in with Wilder."
