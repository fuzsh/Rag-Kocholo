        "text": "Christoph Waltz is to lead Stephen Frears and Christopher Hampton‘s adaptation of Billy Wilder & Me.\n\nThe No Time to Die and Inglorious Basterds star will play Wilder in the part coming-of-age story, part true-to-life portrait of the Hollywood icon, which is adapted from a book by Jonathan Coe. In the summer of 1977, an innocent young woman begins working for famed director Billy Wilder and his screenwriter Iz Diamond on a Greek island during the filming of Fedora. When she follows Wilder to Germany to continue the shoot, she finds herself joining him on a journey of memory into the heart of his family history.\n\nThe film sees Frears and two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter Hampton reunited for their third collaboration after Dangerous Liaisons and Cheri.\n\nProduction will commence in Greece, Munich and Paris, with casting of further principal roles coming shortly.\n\nWaltz said: “Christoph Waltz said: “Billy Wilder said “You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning“. A Stephen Frears movie from a Christopher Hampton script produced by Jeremy Thomas should do the trick for me.”"
