    "text": "Introduction\n\nBilly Wilder (b. 1906–d. 2002) was a writer-director who was responsible for many classics of the Hollywood studio era. Famous for his mordant wit, he was born Samuel Wilder to a Jewish family in a province of the Austro-Hungarian empire that is now part of Poland. His mother, who loved American popular culture, nicknamed him “Billie” after Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show (Wilder later changed the spelling). He worked as a journalist and screenwriter in Vienna and Berlin until 1933, when Hitler’s rise to power prompted him to flee to Paris. Fluent in French, Wilder continued writing scripts and even co-directed Mauvaise Graine (Bad Seed, 1933), a film about a band of young car thieves shot on a shoestring budget. Joe May, a director Wilder had known from his days at the UFA movie studio in Berlin, was by this time producing movies in Hollywood for Columbia. Wilder sent him a story idea and was hired by the studio, arriving in the United States knowing only a few words in English. He shared a room with Peter Lorre, a fellow member of Southern California’s German-speaking émigré community, and listened to American radio every day. As he gradually acquired the language, Columbia paired him with a writing partner: Charles Brackett, the Harvard-educated son of a state senator. Brackett and Wilder’s first script together was for Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife (1938), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, one of Wilder’s idols and a key influence on Wilder’s own body of work. The Brackett-Wilder team produced fifteen films over a dozen years (1938–1950). It was the first of two fruitful collaborations for Wilder. After he and Brackett parted ways with Sunset Boulevard (1950), Wilder joined forces with Romanian-born screenwriter I. A. L. Diamond to write twelve films during the period 1957–1981. Wilder turned to directing with 1942’s The Major and the Minor, determined to protect his scripts from tampering by other directors and actors. He went on to direct such genre-defining works as Double Indemnity (1944) (from a screenplay he co-wrote with Raymond Chandler), The Lost Weekend (1945), Some Like It Hot (1959), and The Apartment (1960). Over the course of his career, Wilder received six Oscars (out of a total of twenty-one nominations) for writing, directing, and producing. He died of pneumonia at his home in Beverly Hills at the age of ninety-five."
