        "text": "Lady with a Blot\n\nBrought Back from Berlin\n\nMarlene Dietrich and Billy Wilder present New Yorkers with what they brought back from Berlin. More than a year ago, they visited the extremely dilapidated site of their previous endeavors.\n\nThey not only celebrated various reunions—between Marlene and her mother, Billy and the Ullstein Building and the torso of the Romanisches Café, once his local. They also filmed a segment for A Foreign Affair, which has just opened in New York.\n\nViewed from an airplane and from street level, we see the ruinously weathered Berlin. It is the backdrop for an amusing game from a time when fraternizing was still frowned upon.\n\nMarlene Dietrich appears as both a woman born Maria Magdalena von Losch and as a certain von Schlütow. With three songs, notorious sex appeal and a blot on her past. Once the girlfriend of a powerful Nazi, as a nightclub singer she now cheerfully fraternizes with an American officer (the appealingly gangling John Lund).\n\nFrom the air arrives a Congressional delegation from Washington, charged with investigating the morale of the occupying troops. The crisp Jean Arthur, a representative from Iowa in the rural provinces, is dissatisfied with the chief of staff’s curt answer that there will be no fraternizing and decides to test it herself.\n\nShe meets John Lund, and he pretends a romantic interest in her to spare Miss von Losch any unpleasant repercussions. Until the Congresswoman awakens from her faux love affair and everything ends happily, the audience has laughed itself silly and the author and director Billy Wilder has strewn a few scraps of wisdom.\n\nBilly Wilder has managed another great hit in Hollywood after the boozy Lost Weekend. In New York, at least, critics and audiences alike agree that Marlene Dietrich and Billy Wilder have brought something delightful back from Berlin."
