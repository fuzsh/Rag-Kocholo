He never directed a film he did not write. . . . Although many of Wilder's visual-literary storytelling devicesm—mistaken identities, disguises, formal narrationm—are as old as storytelling itself and derive from his silent-film experience, his typical themes are highly personal. Over and over Wilder's characters and plots bespeak a love-hate relationship with American life and values, the duality of cynicism and sentimentality, the attraction and repulsion of moviemaking itself, and a growing preoccupation with his own body of work.\"\n\nWilder's place among the finest of American screenwriters and directors is secure. The American Film Institute lists four of Wilder's films among its top 100 films of all time: Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, and The Apartment. In Conversations with Wilder, fellow filmmaker Cameron Crowe summarized the older director's filmmaking career: \"In his canon of work are fall-down-laughing comedies, stinging character studies, social satire, true suspense, aching romance, the best in life, the sad and the giddy, the ironic and harrowing all have equal weight in his work.\"\n\nWilder was born Samuel Wilder in Sucha, Austria, on June 22, 1906. His father, a businessman who operated a series of cafes and hotels, sometimes found himself in financial trouble. His mother, who had visited the United States, gave her son the nickname \"Billy\" in honor of America's Buffalo Bill. Wilder studied law at the University of Vienna to please his parents, but he soon dropped out and began a career as a newspaper journalist, where his specialty was interviewing interesting people in the news, especially sports figures. In 1926 he moved to Berlin, Germany, hoping to write scripts for that country's growing silent-film industry. By 1929, the first of his screenplays had been filmed. Wilder was on his way in his new career, and worked for Universal, Film-studio Germania, Aafa-Film AG, and finally UFA, Germany's largest film studio.\n\nLeaves Europe for the United States\n\nWilder decided that it was time for him to leave Germany when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party assumed power in 1933; a left-leaning Jew, he was viewed with suspicion by the new regime. Knowing little English, and with almost no money, he headed for the United States, having won a small contract to write a screenplay for Columbia Pictures. In Hollywood, Wilder befriended German actor Peter Lorre, a fellow refugee who took his countryman under his wing. After finishing the screenplay for Columbia, Wilder endured two years of unemployment. \"I kind of starved for a little bit,\" he once admitted. \"I shared a room with Peter Lorre, and we lived on a can of soup a day.\" Then, in 1936, he landed a job at Paramount, and on the whim of a producer, he was teamed with Charles Brackett, a novelist and former drama critic for theNew Yorker. The two men would go on to become one of Hollywood's most famous screenwriting teams, penning fourteen consecutive hit films.\n\nIn 1939 Wilder and Brackett combined forces with Walter Reisch and director Ernst Lubitsch on the film Ninotchka. The film, now considered a classic, was envisioned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) as a comic vehicle for film star Greta Garbo. The basic plot revolves around a Soviet girl who travels to the decadent West on party business, only to discover that the West is much better than she has been led to believe. Ninotchka was a risky move in some ways, because some in the Hollywood elite were sympathetic to Soviet Russia in the late 1930s. Nonetheless, the Wilder/Brackett screenplay deals openly with the Moscow show trials in which innocent people were forced to confess to being \"enemies of the state,\" the purges in which party faithful were forcibly removed from office and either executed or imprisoned, and the bloody Five-Year plans that pushed the Russian people to meet impossible production quotas. While the first part of the film is light romantic comedy, detailing Garbo's romance with a Parisian, the final section is relentless political satire. As Moore explained, \"communist ideology is shown to be no match for love, let alone the good life.\" Wilder earned his first Academy Award nomination for Ninotchka.\n\nHis Academy Award success, along with a longtime dissatisfaction with how his screenplays were being filmed, pushed Wilder to take on the role of director himself. In an interview with Charles Higham, he later revealed: \"I had made myself rather unpopular as a writer at Paramount because I would come on the set and they would chase me off it. I was always trying to put them right on misinterpretations.\" In 1942, Paramount agreed to let him direct The Major and the Minor, a comedy. Wilder knew the studio expected him to fail and thereafter behave himself. But he was careful, avoiding the \"arty\" route in favor of making a commercial film that made money for Paramount. From then on, Wilder always directed his own screenplays.\n\nFilm Noir Classic\n\nDuring his fifty years in the film industry, Wilder was known for writing and directing several classic films in two distinct genres: comedy and film noir, the shadowy crime films filled with double crosses and twisted plots. His first film noir titlem—and one of the classics of the genrem—was the 1944 film Double Indemnity. Fred MacMurray plays a corrupt insurance salesman in love with a vicious, sex-driven Barbara Stanwyck. Together they murder Stanwyck's husband for a large insurance settlement, making it look like an accidental fall from a train. Only later do they learn that they cannot collect the money. MacMurray's friend and coworker, Edward G. Robinson, is suspicious of the so-called accident and will not let it go. The film ends with a climactic showdown between the two lovers: Stanwyck shoots MacMurray but does not have the heart to finish him off; when she lets the gun drop to the floor, MacMurray guns her down, returns to his office, and bleeds to death as he dictates the story into a machine. \"Perhaps the purest, the least compromised and sensationalised of all Wilder's films, Double Indemnity retains an undiminished power,\" asserted Higham.\n\nMoore found that Double Indemnity \"is the first virtuoso use by Wilder of the extended flashback. . . . [T]he corrupted agent, tells virtually the whole story to his dictaphone; the voice-over narration to this flashback leads unerringly to the showdown scene with the ethical agent played by Robinson. Wilder remarked later that the device had been so effective that it rendered unnecessary the original filmed ending of MacMurray going to his execution. Double Indemity is also Wilder's first extensive story of friendship between men. In this film it is the relationship of straightforward father and wayward son that is interrupted and perverted by the worship of money and ambition, personified by a woman.\"\n\nThe making of Double Indemnity brought Wilder several unpleasant experiences. After a heated argument with Brackett, Wilder sought out mystery writer Raymond Chandler's assistance with the script. Their collaboration dragged on for six months in a plague of arguments, apologies, and tantrums. Despite the complications, however, Wilder earned Academy Award nominations for best screenplay and best director that year.\n\nWilder and Brackett's last screenplay collaboration was Sunset Boulevard. The story tells of an aging, once-popular star of silent movies, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose desperate dream of a come-back is lived out in a somber, run-down mansion on Sunset Boulevard. To sustain her delusions of undiminished youth and fame, she takes in down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden), and fuels her delusion by reading the fan mail that, unbeknownst to her, is written by her own butler. When Gillis attempts to leave his benefactress, she shoots him in the back, and he falls dead in her swimming pool. The movie ends with a totally insane Desmond greeting a rush of newsreel cameramen, whom she mistakes for cinematographers.\n\nSunset Boulevard is replete with celebrated scenes. The movie opens with a riveting shot of Gillis's corpse floating face down in the pool, the camera looking up through the water at the distorted faces of policemen and photographers discovering the body. Other famous scenes include the \"waxworks\" card game, played by silent screen stars Anna Q. Nilsson, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner, and Gloria Swanson, and a garden funeral staged for Desmond's dead chimpanzee. \"The film succeeds entirely through the application of a mannered, stylized technique so brilliantly manipulated that disbelief is totally suspended,\" Higham stated.\n\nWilder knew Sunset Boulevard would be controversial in Hollywood due to its scathing depiction of the film industry. Fearing that Paramount would kill the project if they knew about its real subject matter, he sent the studio executives weekly progress reports on a nonexistent film titled \"A Can of Beans.\" Only when he was finished did he invite the Hollywood elite to a special screening of the film. Some film executives, including Louis B. Mayer, were furious at Wilder for his sarcastic and dark portrait of Hollywood, summarized in Desmond's classic line, \"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\" However, among the moviegoing public, Sunset Boulevard was a huge success. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, with Wilder taking Oscars for best writing, story and screenplay. Because the film also marked the end of the Wilder-Brackett writing team, in future films Wilder teamed up in 1956 with I. A. L. Diamond, with whom he collaborated until Diamond's death in 1988.\n\nDirects a Masterpiece\n\nWhile Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard are classics of film noir, Wilder also had great success with lighter fare, including the film many critics consider his masterpiece: Some Like It Hot. The plot concerns unemployed musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon), who accidentally witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929, earning themselves the wrath of the local crime boss. To save their lives, the boys don female garb, change their names to Josephine and Daphne, and join an all-girl band bound for a Miami hotel. The desperate pair figure they can drop the female impersonating once they are safe in Florida. But along the way they meet fellow band member Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) who is hoping to marry a millionaire in Florida. Both boys are smitten with her. Having redisguised himself as a millionaire, Joe eventually wins Sugar's love, whereas Jerry finds himself engaged to Osgood, who thinks he is a woman. After accidentally witnessing another gang-land murder, Joe and Jerry make a second escape, this time in the company of Sugar and Osgood. As all four speed off in a motorboat, the movie ends with Osgood still planning marriage to Jerry.\n\nWilder created a darker kind of comedy in The Apartment, in which Jack Lemmon plays Bud Baxter, a corporate accountant whose apartment is conveniently close to his place of work. So close, in fact, that soon higher-ups in the company are borrowing the place for their after-work dalliances, leaving the guilty but ambitious Baxter out in the cold some nights. \"Baxter is a symbol of Joe Public's complicity in corporate ethics,\" according to Richard Armstrong, writing on the Senses of Cinema Web site. \"Harassed, understanding the way the game is played, he is nevertheless a pure-at-heart naif,\" Moore stated. \"His female counterpart is Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the elevator operator who is carrying on a hopeless affair with the man who can get Bud promoted. All of Wilder's favorite devices work superlatively in The Apartment, including his ear for current slang and his laconic voice-over narration. There are the running gags, such as a neighbor's marveling at Bud Baxter's sexual endurance (he thinks that all the trysts in the upstairs apartment are actually Bud's). The Apartment was one of Wilder's greatest successes.\" He won three Oscars for writing, directing, and producing, the first time anyone had won those three major awards in one night.\n\nWilder was once asked by a writer for the New York Times what made a film successful. He replied: \"The basic point is to bring them in and keep them awake.\" His own efforts to do just that were well rewarded. As Les Spindle remarked in Back Stage West, Wilder \"stands among the great filmmakers of all time, boasting 21 Oscar nominations and six wins.\" \"I was not a guy who was writing deep-dish revelations,\" Kyle Smith of People quoted Wilder as saying. \"If people see a picture of mine and then sit down and talk about it for 15 minutes, that is a very fine reward, I think. That's good enough for me.\" Writing in Time, Richard Corliss admitted: \"It's hard to think of another filmmaker whose pictures have given so much ripe, intelligent pleasure and are still as fresh as when he concocted them. And what about his rare failures? 'Well,' as Joe E. Brown says at the end of Some Like It Hot, when told that his fiancee is really a man, 'nobody's perfect.''\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Billy Wilder\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Billy Wilder, you may also want to check out the following:\n\nDial M for Murder, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, 1954.\n\nA Face in the Crowd, directed by Elia Kazan, 1957.\n\nTouch of Evil, directed by Orson Welles, 1958.\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nArmstrong, Richard, Billy Wilder, American Film Realist, McFarland, 2000.\n\nChandler, Charlotte, Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, a Personal Biography, Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 2002.\n\nCrowe, Cameron, Conversations with Wilder, Knopf (New York, NY), 1999.\n\nDick, Bernard F., Billy Wilder, Da Capo Press (New York, NY), 1996.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 26: American Screenwriters, First Series, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1984.\n\nHigham, Charles, and Joel Greenberg, Celluloid Muse, Regnery (Washington, DC), 1969.\n\nHigham, Charles, The Art of the American Film, Anchor Press-Doubleday (New York, NY), 1973.\n\nHopp, Glenn, Billy Wilder, Pocket Essentials, 2001.\n\nHorton, Robert, Billy Wilder: Interviews, University Press of Mississippi, 2002.\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Volume 2: Directors, 4th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 2000.\n\nKoszarski, Richard, Hollywood Directors, 1941-1976, Oxford University Press (New York, NY), 1977.\n\nLally, Kevin, Wilder Times: The Life of Billy Wilder, Holt (New York, NY), 1996.\n\nMadsen, Axel, Billy Wilder, Indiana University Press, 1969.\n\nPorfirio, Robert, Alain Silver, and James Ursini, editors, Film Noir Reader 3, Limelight Editions, 2001.\n\nSarris, Andrew, The American Cinema, Dutton (New York, NY), 1968.\n\nSeidman, Steve, The Film Career of Billy Wilder, G.
