(more)\n\nJust as daring in its way was The Apartment (1960), in which Lemmon played a milquetoast business executive who, hoping for a promotion, lets his tyrannical boss (MacMurray, cast against type, again with splendid results) use his apartment to conduct an extramarital affair with neurotic elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) and then comes to her rescue (falling in love with her in the process) when she tries to commit suicide. Bold for its time, this moralistic tale won the Academy Award for best picture. Wilder also won the awards for best director and best screenplay (with Diamond).\n\nIrma La Douce Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon in a publicity still for Irma La Douce (1963), directed by Billy Wilder. (more)\n\nOne, Two, Three (1961) was a frenetic Cold War farce that was shot on location in Germany (as the Berlin Wall was being constructed) and starred James Cagney as a Coca-Cola executive in West Berlin whose job is on the line when his boss’s visiting daughter (Pamela Tiffin) falls for and marries a bohemian East German communist (Horst Buchholz). One, Two, Three was not a hit with contemporary audiences (though appreciation of it grew as the Cold War faded into history), but Wilder’s next film, Irma La Douce (1963), was. The nonmusical adaptation of a French (and later Broadway) musical by Alexandre Breffort and Marguerite Monnot starred MacLaine and Lemmon as, respectively, a philosophical Parisian prostitute and the self-righteous constable who tries to shut down her operation. MacLaine received an Academy Award nomination as best actress for her performance.\n\nThe provocative Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) was reviled by contemporary critics, condemned by the Legion of Decency, and failed at the box-office. Although film historians have had a more mixed response, Kiss Me, Stupid is generally thought to represent the nadir of Wilder’s career. Ray Walston played a small-town songwriter whose attempt to sell his songs to an egotistical pop singer (Dean Martin) includes offering up the favours of a prostitute (Kim Novak) whom he presents as his wife.\n\nThe Fortune Cookie Jack Lemmon (left) and Walter Matthau in The Fortune Cookie (1966). (more)\n\nWilder and Diamond bounced back with one of their tartest comedies, The Fortune Cookie (1966). Lemmon played a television cameraman who is accidentally trampled by a running back while covering a gridiron football game. Although the cameraman’s injuries are minor, he allows his brother-in-law (Walter Matthau), an ambulance-chasing lawyer referred to by his peers as Whiplash Willie, to talk him into suing the Cleveland Browns for a million dollars. Matthau won a best supporting actor Academy Award, and the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award."
