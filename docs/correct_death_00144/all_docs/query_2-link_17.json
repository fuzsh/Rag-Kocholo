        "text": "Just as daring in its way was The Apartment (1960), in which Lemmon played a milquetoast business executive who, hoping for a promotion, lets his tyrannical boss (MacMurray, cast against type, again with splendid results) use his apartment to conduct an extramarital affair with neurotic elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) and then comes to her rescue (falling in love with her in the process) when she tries to commit suicide. Bold for its time, this moralistic tale won the Academy Award for best picture. Wilder also won the awards for best director and best screenplay (with Diamond).\n\nOne, Two, Three (1961) was a frenetic Cold War farce that was shot on location in Germany (as the Berlin Wall was being constructed) and starred James Cagney as a Coca-Cola executive in West Berlin whose job is on the line when his boss’s visiting daughter (Pamela Tiffin) falls for and marries a bohemian East German communist (Horst Buchholz). One, Two, Three was not a hit with contemporary audiences (though appreciation of it grew as the Cold War faded into history), but Wilder’s next film, Irma La Douce (1963), was. The nonmusical adaptation of a French (and later Broadway) musical by Alexandre Breffort and Marguerite Monnot starred MacLaine and Lemmon as, respectively, a philosophical Parisian prostitute and the self-righteous constable who tries to shut down her operation. MacLaine received an Academy Award nomination as best actress for her performance.\n\nThe provocative Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) was reviled by contemporary critics, condemned by the Legion of Decency, and failed at the box-office. Although film historians have had a more mixed response, Kiss Me, Stupid is generally thought to represent the nadir of Wilder’s career. Ray Walston played a small-town songwriter whose attempt to sell his songs to an egotistical pop singer (Dean Martin) includes offering up the favours of a prostitute (Kim Novak) whom he presents as his wife.\n\nWilder and Diamond bounced back with one of their tartest comedies, The Fortune Cookie (1966). Lemmon played a television cameraman who is accidentally trampled by a running back while covering a gridiron football game. Although the cameraman’s injuries are minor, he allows his brother-in-law (Walter Matthau), an ambulance-chasing lawyer referred to by his peers as Whiplash Willie, to talk him into suing the Cleveland Browns for a million dollars. Matthau won a best supporting actor Academy Award, and the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nLast films\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAfter being absent from the screen for the next four years, Wilder returned in 1970 with The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (coscripted with Diamond), a generally underrated revisionist take on the fictional detective. Avanti! (1972) followed and starred Lemmon as a millionaire who travels to Italy to bury his father only to fall in love with the daughter (Juliet Mills) of his father’s mistress. Like The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, it did not fare well commercially, though, arguably, this was a function not of any deficiency in the work itself but rather of Wilder’s being out of step with the times. Contemporary critics were inclined to find fault with the gentle patiently paced romantic comedy, but later critics hailed it as an underappreciated gem.\n\nAudiences did turn out to see Lemmon and Matthau paired in The Front Page (1974), but few critics thought Wilder’s remake of the Ben Hecht–Charles MacArthur play was the equal of Lewis Milestone’s 1931 original or Howard Hawks’s version, His Girl Friday (1940). More interesting but little seen was the German-financed Fedora (1978), in which Holden played a producer who tries to coax a Greta Garbo-like actress (Martha Keller) out of retirement. Matthau and Lemmon were teamed by Wilder one last time in his final film, Buddy Buddy (1981), adapted by Wilder and Diamond from the French farce L’Emmerdeur (A Pain in the A—; 1973).\n\nLegacy\n\nWilder has often been characterized as the cynical purveyor of savage humour, but it is probably more accurate to see his cinematic art as a mixture of cynicism and romanticism. Richard Griffith, the curator of the Museum of Modern Art’s Film Library, wrote of Wilder, “Whether his scene is the fleshpots of Long Island, the deceptive blandness of corporate life, or a desolate cave in a Western desert, there is visible behind his story-lines what has to be called a theme: the bewilderment of us all who, living in the midst of plenty and under the shadow of doomsday, must still make choices, and make them without guidance, flying blind.”\n\nDuring his career, Wilder was nominated for 20 Academy Awards and won six. At the 1988 Academy Awards, he was given the Irving G. Thalberg Award for a consistently high quality of motion-picture production, having already received a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute (AFI) in 1986. Four of his films—Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, Double Indemnity, and The Apartment—appeared on the AFI’s list of Top 100 films, in both the list’s original (1998) and 10th-anniversary (2007) incarnations.\n\nMichael Barson The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
