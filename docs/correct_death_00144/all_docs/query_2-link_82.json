So begins Walter Neff’s (Fred M acMurray) confession in Billy\n\nWilder’s Double Indemnity, a confession that tells how he fell for femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson,\n\nhow h e planned and under took the murder of her husband, and attempted to claim the life\n\ninsurance h e had himself sold to the dead man. The audience also hears that Neff’s actions\n\naroused the suspicions of his boss and mentor, Keyes, and led to a shoot out with Phyllis that\n\nproves fat al for both. Hence t hat famou s opening line. M ore than just an example of Raymond\n\nChandler’s and Wilder’s pithy dialogue, the li ne encapsulates the film’s criticism of the American\n\nideal. Neff’s future of u pward mobility and a loving wife is g one. F urthermore, in the course of\n\npursuing this dream, h e has destr oyed a family, attempted t o cheat his employer and murdered a\n\ntypical h ard-working citizen. With this statement comes the verbal proof of what the plot goes\n\non to demonstrate: the American Dream is dead.\n\nDouble Indemnity is by no means the only film to express su ch sentiment. In the struggle to define\n\nFilm Noir, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton cite ‘a specific sense of malaise’ ( Borde and\n\nChaumeton 2002, 1 3). This malaise is as v ital to the g enre as v iolent death or dangerous women;\n\nit is in this structure of Noir that we find its strongest assault on the Am erican promise. In Double\n\nIndemnity such pessimistic melancholy is almost obscenely abundant. The film reeks of modernist\n\ndiscontent w ith the direction A merica was heading, and b orrows from that movement the tropes\n\nof fragmentation, alienation, non -linear plots and s ubjective narration to expr e ss a similar disd ain\n\nfor mo dernity (Naremore 1998, 45 ; Abbott 2002 , 2). By the t ime of t he film’s release in 1944,\n\ncreators of t he Noir aesthetic l ike W ilder, Chandler and J ames M. Cain (w ho wr ote the novel\n\nfrom which the film was adapted) had r ecently seen reces sion, war and race r iots. They w ere fas t\n\nbecoming disillusioned w ith their nat ion, bei ng faced with what director Joseph Losey called ‘the\n\ncomplete unreality of the American Dream’ (Anderson 1985, 187). It is how they articulated t heir\n\ndisillusionment that I seek to explain.\n\nFew st udies thus f ar have connected Film Noir with criticism of the A merican Dream. Of those\n\nthat have, the most not able include Scott Loren’s ‘Out of the Past’: Freedom, Film Noir and the\n\nAmerican Dre am’s M yth of Reinvention (2007), Paula Rabinowitz’s Black & White & Noir: America’s\n\nPulp Modernism (2002) and Ken Hillis’s Film Noir and the Amer ican Dream: The Dark Side of\n\nEnlightenment (2005). Loren sees Noir as a ‘moralizing commentary on [the] refashioning and self -\n\ninvention’ at the h eart of the Ame rican Dream, and there is a great deal of truth in s uch an\n\nassertion (Scott 2007 , 371) . How ever, Loren looks more at t he trend of self-reinvention o f Film\n\nNoir characters attemp ting to escape their pas ts, and less at ho w their actions denote c riticism of\n\nindividual hist orical components o f the Dream. Rabinowitz briefly connects the development of\n\nNoir style t o a loss o f faith in America but a more de tailed analysis can be don e (Rabinowitz\n\n2002, 111). Hillis curiously chooses to argue that Noir protagonists are faced with a crisis of\n\nEnlightenment philosophy th at for them dim inishes America’s promise (Hillis 2 005, 3 ). More\n\ntangible e lements, such as family, upwa rd mobility, h ard wo rk and consumerism s hould be\n\nexamined. Furthermore, the trappings of modernist thinking are far more obvious than\n\nEnlightenment philosophy in the critique for med in Double Indemnit y .\n\nTo understand how Film Noir disparages the Ame rican Dream, a definition of the Dream itself i s\n\nneeded. As has often been pointed out, ‘few terms are defined in so many different w ays or\n\nbandied abou t more loos ely’ (Fossum and R oth 1981, 5). W hile certainly signifying the promise\n\nthat America offers to its inhabitants, the American Dream remains an amorphous and fluid\n\nnotion that has constantly been rev ised according to historical period and thus is n ot easily\n\npinned down. But there are recognisable tenets. In it s earliest phase, puritan s ettlers defined it as\n\nfreedom of r eligion (Wright 1996, 31). The founding fathers gave it its most famous wr itten"
