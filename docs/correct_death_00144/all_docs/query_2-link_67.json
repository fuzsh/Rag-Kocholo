    "text": "For a long time, when I thought about the goddamn injustice of Hollywood, the image my mind centered on was a seventy and eighty-something Billy Wilder, his mind still razor-sharp, his wit still a volcanic force, coming into his office each day eager to make films and succeeding only occasionally, and after a certain point not at all.\n\nI could not bear the idea that the man who gave the world One, Two, Three and Ace in the Hole and Some Like It Hot and so many other ferociously smart, verbal masterpieces had difficulty getting films made while Hollywood spent a bizarre number of years under the illusion that if they just threw money at Joe Eszterhas of all people, those millions would be returned to them a thousandfold in both art and commerce in a karmic bonanza of epic proportions.\n\nMy heart broke for Wilder, who I wished had the kind of late-career renaissance of someone like Clint Eastwood, who stayed in the game, cranking out a film a year even after his mind had gone to the point where he thought having an animated conversation with a chair in front of tens of millions of confused and concerned people was a good idea."
