        "text": "Billy Wilder, who has died aged 95, could seem like history itself. He had helped write the scene where Garbo laughed in Ninotchka (1939) - he also wanted her to say \"bottom\", but the star thought it was vulgar. He was endlessly patient with Marilyn Monroe on Some Like It Hot (1959), and turned out a comedy that felt as spontaneous as it was startling.\n\nAs a kid in Vienna, Wilder interviewed Richard Strauss, Arthur Schnitzler, Alfred Adler and Sigmund Freud - on the same day. Much later, in his apartment high above Wilshire Boulevard, he showed off his art collection - and went almost daily to his office where he sat with his seven Oscars and waited for the phone to ring. \"Let me work,\" he said, but the system had decided that he was too old or out of touch. Whereas Wilder breathed \"touch\".\n\nWilder exemplified what the tough sentiment of Berlin and Vienna meant to the Hollywood movie at its peak. He had learnt irony under the Hapsburgs, human nature under the covers, and resignation from the awesome mix of enterprise and stupidity that was Paramount. Smart, funny, wicked, dirty, urbane, naughty - he was ultimately his own character, fit company for Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, Walter Neff and Phyllis Diedrichson, Daphne and Josephine.\n\nHe was born Samuel Wilder in Sucha, in what was then the Galician part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He was Jewish, the son of a former head waiter-cum- Krakow hotel owner. His mother loved all things American, and she called Samuel \"Billy\" after Buffalo Bill Cody, whose wild west show she had once seen in New York. She had lived there as a girl, and longed to go back - alas, she would perish in Auschwitz.\n\nWith the first world war, the Wilders moved to Vienna. Billy was a teenager in the post-war years when Vienna faced the perilous new world. He saw mobs, a ruined currency and shattered families. That would add to his reputation for cynicism, but Wilder was someone who had had to digest the end of an empire and the need to survive. He knew that dukes, fine ladies and poetical geniuses had enough of the rat in them.\n\nIn 1924, he entered Vienna's university to read law, a calling that wilted as he became a part-time journalist. He loved gossip, roaming the city for human incident, enjoying café society, dance halls, billiard parlours and the underworld.\n\nThe young Wilder was a terrific dancer, a womaniser and a wit. He moved to Berlin in 1926 as an aide to the American jazz orchestra leader, Paul Whiteman. There he was the intimate of jazz musicians, a friend to a little-known Marlene Dietrich, and a journalist who made his name with a series on being a gigolo. He began moving in cinematic circles, partly through a friendship with screenwriter Carl Mayer. And so it was that in 1929 Wilder became scenarist (or title writer) on Menschen am Sonntag (People on Sunday), a pan-orama of stories about young people on the loose in Berlin and made by a core group - including director Robert Siodmak - who would all be Hollywood figures.\n\nAs a screenwriter he then wrote Der Teufelsreporter (1929), Der Mann, Der Seinen Morder Sucht (1931), for Siodmak again, Emil Und Die Detektive (1931) and Das Blaue Vom Himmel (1932). Early in 1933, Hitler was appointed chancellor, and Wilder told his girlfriend, Hella Hartwig, that it was time to leave. The day after the Reichstag fire, she gathered her jewellery and he put his money in his hat band, and they moved to Paris, and a hotel that already housed Peter Lorre and the composers Franz Waxmann and Friedrich Hollander. Wilder had a tough time but he got to direct for the first time - Mauvaise Graine (1933) - starring the teenage Danielle Darrieux in a fast-moving story about young thieves, shot on location, and with a jazz score by Waxmann, who, dropping an \"n\" won an Oscar for his Sunset Boulevard music.\n\nWilder didn't enjoy directing. He was content to be a writer. Late in 1933, through the director Joe May, he sold a script to Columbia and sailed to New York on the Aquitania, practising English all the way to Los Angeles. May met him at the station and drove him around the town. The legend was that Wilder paused at one street sign that seemed to be absurdly poetic. \"What's that, Joe?\" he asked. \"Sunset Boulevard\" was the reply.\n\nThat was 1934, and Wilder did not direct his next film, The Major And The Minor, until 1942. But he mastered the language and idioms of Hollywood. He was hard-up for years and again relied on Peter Lorre's charity. He wrote a few unremarkable movies - Music In The Air (1934), Lottery Lover (1935) and Champagne Waltz (1937). In 1935, he met Judith Coppiza Iribe, a gorgeous, witty sophisticate, and in 1936 they married. And then, in 1938, Wilder met Charles Brackett, from Williams College and Harvard Law School, a novelist who had been wooed by Paramount in the early 1930s. Brackett, a Wasp, was gentlemanly and honourable - Wilder was racy and impish. But they clicked and began a writing partnership that took the business by storm - Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938), for Ernst Lubitsch; Midnight (1939), for Mitchell Leisen - one of the wittiest romances of the era; Ninotchka (1939), for Lubitsch, again; Arise My Love (1940), in which reporter Claudette Colbert rescues flyer Ray Milland in civil war Spain, for Leisen again; Hold Back The Dawn (1941), derived from Wilder's time in Mexico, trying to get his American citizenship (achieved in 1939); and Ball Of Fire (1941), the Howard Hawks movie about a group of lexicographers, led by Gary Cooper, and the gangster's moll (Barbara Stanwyck) they meet.\n\nThe Ninotchka script got an Oscar nomination (it lost to Gone With The Wind), as did Ball Of Fire and Hold Back The Dawn. Brackett and Wilder turned themselves into a Paramount production team: they wrote together, Brackett produced and Wilder directed. They began modestly with the comedy The Major And The Minor (1942), in which Ray Milland gets involved with a Ginger Rogers who is masquerading as a 12-year-old and Five Graves To Cairo (1943), in which Erich von Stroheim played Rommel.\n\nThen Wilder hit the jackpot. It was said that no one could film James M Cain's 1936 novella, Double Indemnity, for censorship reasons and Brackett found the story disgusting. Wilder went for it with another producer, Joe Sistrom, and they got Raymond Chandler to help write it. Chandler admired Wilder but hated the experience and ended up alarmed by Wilder's needling and unscrupulous attitude. The result was tamer than Cain but it is superior entertainment. In its creation of Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) and Phyllis Diedrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), and their sordid deal, it helped lay a foundation for film noir. Double Indemnity was nominated for best picture, for direction and for screenplay and, though it intimidated audiences, in the business it established Wilder's authority.\n\nReunited, Wilder and Brackett took a big gamble in electing to film Charles Jackson's The Lost Weekend, a portrait of alcoholism that starred Ray Milland as the charming fatalist trying to kick his habit. Previewed early in 1945, audiences flinched from the film's scary treatment of weakness and the delirium sequences. Paramount was afraid to release it - there was even talk of the movie being bought (and then lost) by a distillers' syndicate. Out of love with the business, Wilder became a colonel in psychological warfare, spending time in Paris and Germany, viewing the destruction, and beginning his art collection. That autumn, when he got back, Paramount decided it could swallow The Lost Weekend. It won Oscars for best picture, director, screenplay and actor and remains both a harrowing picture and a step forward in understanding of addictive behaviour.\n\nWith two films, Wilder had won a reputation for sardonic realism and a pessimistic view of human nature - in truth, both Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend were very stylish melodramas. He seemed to be a director with a cool finger on America's corrupt pulse, whereas he was someone who anticipated the new vogue for hardboiled and \"cynical\" attitudes.\n\nTo counter that, maybe, The Emperor Waltz (1948) was set in turn of the century Vienna, with songs, sunshine and a sly humour. Darkness returned in A Foreign Affair (1948), a bitter comedy set in post-war Berlin. It opposed an idealistic and not very worldly congresswoman (Jean Arthur) with a rueful, very experienced café singer (Marlene Dietrich, with songs by Frederick Hollander). It has extraordinary moments - \"Isn't It Romantic?\" played over shots of a ruined Berlin - but in the end it is an evasion of its own darker instincts.\n\nIn 1950 Wilder and Brackett were back with a treatment of their own world that has become a byword: Sunset Boulevard, maybe the most exultant confession of Hollywood's own tendency to madness, an exposé if you like, yet always an opera in the making, with a wicked witch who was still a princess in her mind. We all love and understand Norma Desmond now, but in 1950 there were Hollywood veterans like Louis B Mayer who felt the picture was a wilful betrayal of its own religion. But once again, the exposé was a hugely entertaining melodrama, aglow with the cynical aplomb of Joe Gillis, the corpse who narrates the story. Nominated for six major Oscars, Sunset Boulevard won only for screenplay - too many people in Hollywood remained in shock. The film that beat it in several categories, All About Eve, was another acid treatment of showbusiness. Wilder's touch was proved yet again: he had guessed that the world was ready to have its dream factory reappraised.\n\nThen Wilder and Brackett parted. Brackett never understood the breach, but those close to them felt that Wilder simply feared being so dependent on, or so fond of, anyone else. It went against the deepest instincts of the survivor. He could not bear to be loved as Brackett loved him. For there was an eternally competitive and abrasive spirit in Wilder, a man who craved company (or an audience) yet felt irked by it, too. Some have noted the recurrance in Wilder films of a close male partnership that is also bitter, destructive and full of hostility - it's there with MacMurray and Edward G Robinson in Double Indemnity; Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot; Lemmon and Walter Matthau in so many of the later films; and Holmes and Watson in the 1970 treatment of that partnership.\n\nAlone at last, in 1951, Wilder made Ace In The Hole, about a ruthless journalist (Kirk Douglas) who manipulates a story to boost his own career. This is maybe his most misanthropic picture, and one of the least appreciated. Wilder seemed to heed the warning in its box-office failure, for he made himself gentler, more amusing and more compromised in the next films, pictures in which often bleak situations are happily resolved; Stalag 17 (1953); Sabrina (1954); The Seven Year Itch (1955); The Spirit Of St Louis (1957), an awkward account of Lindbergh's transatlantic flight; Witness For The Prosecution (1957), so old-fashioned it would have made Norma Desmond blush. Then, as he made Love In The Afternoon (1957) a tribute to the spirit of Lubitsch, and a May- October romance with Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, he met the writer IAL Diamond who would become his new partner.\n\n\"Iz\" Diamond was a Romanian maths wizard; IAL, he said stood for Interscholastic Algebra League. Quiet, shy, deferential, very smart, when Wilder lost his temper, Iz just waited for him to get it back - Brackett had too often lost his, in competition. And so Wilder was tamed. Harry Kurnitz, his co-writer on Witness for The Prosecution, had said there were two Wilders - Mr Hyde, and Mr Hyde.\n\nThe cocktail fizzed immedi ately. Taking up an old German 1930s comedy, about two musicians who got work in a black band by putting on black face, they came up with Some Like It Hot, not just a perfect, screwball comedy, but an almost unconscious mix of gender confusion and erotic fantasy. In its way, Some Like It Hot was more audacious and influential than Lost Weekend, for somehow Wilder knew a sexual riot was coming. Again, the Academy was taken aback, though audiences were swept along. But the foundations of sexual \"normality\" were being tested. Wilder didn't show a hint of gayness but Some Like It Hot is so abandoned, so radical, and so happy a genre entertainment that it freed countless closeted urges. It is one of the great American movies, almost certainly because no one involved on it ever fully grasped it.\n\nThe Apartment, the next year, won Oscars for best picture, best direction and screenplay, yet it's a plainer picture, even if it shows a shrewd, quite nasty awareness of the compromising in American life. It could have been a piece of shabby realism in which no character is really likeable or honest. But it opts cannily for a sweeter, cleansing ending. Indeed, when given a chance to be very tough, Wilder could sometimes betray himself and settle for box-office politics. Which may have been one more reason for not liking the system, or himself.\n\nOne, Two, Three (1961) is a comedy with James Cagney as a Coca-Cola executive in a divided modern Berlin. Irma la Douce (1963) had Shirley MacLaine as a sweet tart and Jack Lemmon as the gendarme in love with her. Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) - a signal failure - is filled with disdain for American manners and feelings. The Private Life Of Sherlock Holmes (1970) is the most ambitious and deeply felt of the later films, and there are those who hail its full-length version (it was much cut) as a masterpiece. There was also The Fortune Cookie (1966), his first pairing of Lemmon and Walter Matthau, Avanti! (1972), The Front Page (1974) and Fedora (1978), a forlorn attempt to recapture the Hollywood intrigue of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nThen came the years of grumbling inactivity, the Wilder who was bitter at not being employed while still happily married to his second wife, Audrey Young, a singer and actress. They had been married since just after Sunset Boulevard and they became a very social couple. Wilder was a superb raconteur, a great art collector and friend to painters such as David Hockney - an institution. His packed life and rather tricky soul cry out for a great biography, one task of which would be to decide if he deserves respect as a true artist. If not, is it enough to say of Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Ace In The Hole and Some Like It Hot that they were just brilliant entertainments?\n\nHis marriage to Judith Iribe ended in 1947; he is survived by his second wife, Audrey, and his daughter from his first marriage."
