    "text": "No, this isn't a production still from James Cameron's TITANIC, this is the original Bistro restaurant once located in Beverly Hills. The original address was 235 Canon Drive. Today this room is the 2nd floor of Mastro’s Steak House (although it looks nothing like this now).\n\nThe Bistro catered to high-powered crowd thick with denizens of the film industry and high society from 1963 until 1996. The Bistro was a favorite of Billy Wilder, Groucho Marx, Debbie Reynolds, and Elizabeth Taylor to name a very selective few.\n\nThe decor was originally the set for Billy Wilder's movie,\"Irma La Douce\". When filming was finished, he donated it all to the restaurant. Thus the name... Bistro\n\nThe decor was originally the set for Billy Wilder's movie,\"Irma La Douce\".

According to columnist Early Wilson, she sang, \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\", \"Chicago\", and \"The Man That Got Away\". Sadly, no recording is available.\n\nMy mother had her baby shower for me on the second floor event room. It was given by Karen Kramer, wife of Stanley Kramer. And check out my grandmother in white go-go boots!\n\nMy mother had her baby shower for me on the second floor event room. It was given by Karen Kramer, wife of Stanley Kramer.

Also, bridal showers, weddings & receptions, bar mitzvahs, birthday & holiday parties. It was quite a room for an event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSammy Davis Jr., Dyan Cannon, and Carol Channing\n\n\n\n\n\nScores of residents and Hollywood types did what they could to keep the party circuit going. If it wasn't a luncheon it was a black tie dinner-dance affair. Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck would often frequent the Bistro, and James Stewart never seemed to mind sitting next to out-of-town guests sipping a \"Silver Bullet\" - a gin & tonic with Scotch floating on top. It was party central and 'where to be seen'. For example, shortly after Mia Farrow married Frank Sinatra they attended a party where Princess Margaret, and her husband, the Earl of Snowdon, met the elite of Hollywood. It was at that party, Mia showed off hew new short Vidal Sasoon haircut. In 1974, Debbie Reynolds was presented the \"Americana Award\" during a buffet dinner and Christina Onassis had her 21st birthday upstairs. But, Niklas said the greatest party that ever took place in the Garden’s private Pavilion Room was producer Jerry Perenchio’s one-year wedding anniversary bash. “He flew Pavarotti over to sing.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Alda and Roger Daltrey in conversation at the Bistro in 1974\n\nThe Bistro was one of the greatest places to see Hollywood movie stars mingling with rockstars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cassidy, Elliot Mintz and Elton John\n\nMCA Records party for Elton John Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli at the Bistro, 1977\n\n\n\n\n\nXanadu launch party in 1979\n\n\n\nThe Bistro was also recreated on a sound stage for Robert Towne & Hal Ashby’s SHAMPOO. Production was denied permission to shoot at the original location because of the restaurants tight event schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Shampoo\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie Collins was inspired by the Bistro Garden to write her 1983 novel “Hollywood Wives.”\n\n\n\nIn 1977 the Bistro moved down the street to 176 Canon and was renamed the Bistro Garden. It closed 20 years later after scandalous rumors of an anti-Semitic insult to a patron had caused a number of customers to defect. That 'rumor' had the phones ringing off the hook. It was most likely a big misunderstanding, and Kurt apologized publicly and profusely, but a particular influential society matron refused to let it go, kept the story circulating and initiated a boycott. And that was the beginning of the end for the Beverly Hills location. One of the first examples of cancel culture."
