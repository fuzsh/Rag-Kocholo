        "text": "Billy Wilder, one of the giants of American films, left a remarkable and far-reaching legacy of work. Wilder, who died last week of pneumonia at the age of 95, was noted for his wry and sometimes trenchant wit both on and off the screen.\n\nHe was responsible for such classics as \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), \"The Apartment\" (1960), \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), \"Double Indemnity\" (1944) and \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945). Both \"The Apartment\" and \"The Lost Weekend\" won Oscars for best picture and for Wilder's direction. He won four other Academy Awards, for writing \"Sunset Boulevard\" and for writing, directing and producing \"The Apartment.\"\n\nIn addition, he directed such critical and commercial hits as \"The Big Carnival\" (1951), \"The Seven Year Itch\" (1955), \"Sabrina\" (1954), \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), \"A Foreign Affair\" (1948), \"The Fortune Cookie\" (1966), \"Stalag 17\" (1953) and \"Irma La Douce\" (1963).\n\nFew other filmmakers could match the quality, consistency and durability of his movies.\n\nWilder's camera movements were almost musical in their grace, and three musical versions of his films became hits on the Broadway stage. \"Sunset Boulevard\" retained its original title, while \"Some Like It Hot\" became \"Sugar,\" and \"The Apartment\" was transformed into \"Promises, Promises.\" Although successful, none of these stage translations erased the memory of his films.\n\nIt was simply impossible to duplicate the Wilder touch. In 1995, Sydney Pollack, the lauded director of \"Out of Africa\" and \"Tootsie,\" helmed a visually lovely remake of Sabrina, but the public clearly preferred the Wilder version. Cameron Crowe, who directed the 1996 hit \"Jerry Maguire,\" said he tried to duplicate the tone of \"The Apartment\" in the Tom Cruise film.\n\nHis films expertly showcased such luminaries as Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, William Holden, Shirley MacLaine, Barbara Stanwyck, Kirk Douglas, Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power and Charles Laughton.\n\nFrequently, he would navigate his stars into uncharted waters. Stanwyck often played strong women, but she hesitated when offered the part of a homicidal suburbanite in \"Double Indemnity.\" \"Are you an actress or a mouse?\" he asked the reluctant Stanwyck. She took his challenge, and the result was one of her best-remembered roles.\n\n\"Double Indemnity\" co-star Fred MacMurray played heels in both that film and later in \"The Apartment.\" Ordinarily cast as all-American good guy, he was closely associated with Disney comedies when \"The Apartment\" was released. He chuckled when recalling how, during a Disneyland appearance on a rainy day, he was confronted by a group of hostile women, who hit him over the head with their umbrellas and asked how he could treat MacLaine so shabbily in \"The Apartment.\"\n\nWilder also had his mishaps. Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn were mismatched in \"Love in the Afternoon,\" and James Stewart as Charles Lindbergh in \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" was a major disappointment. (\"The biggest flop in the history of Warner Bros.,\" moaned studio chief Jack Warner). The film didn't suggest the aviator's conflicted personality, which was the center of the then-recent biography by A. Scott Berg.\n\nLater Wilder films, including \"Fedora\" and \"Buddy, Buddy,\" were pale imitations of earlier triumphs.\n\nHe remained a favorite with actors, with the exception of Marilyn Monroe.\n\n\"She hated me, and I hated her, but she transformed the screen,\" he said of the star of \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"The Seven Year Itch.\"\n\nHowever, he received lauds from most other colleagues. Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"The two most important words in the motion picture business are Billy Wilder.\"\n\nWhen Wilder received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1986, Audrey Hepburn praised him as \"a wonderful, witty, tender, unique genius.\"\n\nTypically, at a press conference before the AFI tribute, he derided such ceremonies for having \"an urgency about them, like 'Let's get 'em quick before they croak.' \"\n\nWilliam Holden's career was turned around by \"Sunset Boulevard,\" and he won an Oscar for \"Stalag 17.\" His last film with the director, \"Fedora,\" flopped. But he maintained no regrets. \"No actor ever regrets making a Billy Wilder film,\" he said. \"There's so much everyone involved in filmmaking can learn from him.\"\n\nOne lesson culled from the Wilder library is respect for witty, probing dialogue. The filmmaker had been a Hollywood screenwriter for eight years before directing, and he co-wrote the screenplays for such comedy hits as \"Ball of Fire\" and \"Midnight.\"\n\n\"I became a director not because I had a mad urge to direct but to protect our scripts,\" said Wilder, who, with the success of \"The Lost Weekend,\" became the first person to win Oscars for both direction and screenplay.\n\nAlthough most commonly regarded as a director of romantic comedies, he rarely shied away from provocative themes. \"The Lost Weekend\" was one of the screen's first unflinching looks at alcoholism. \"A Foreign Affair\" dealt with the presence of the American military in post-war Berlin. \"One, Two, Three\" made audiences both laugh at and reflect upon the Cold War.\n\n\"The Big Carnival,\" also known as \"Ace in the Hole,\" held a mirror up to media manipulation long before it became a popular topic. Of course, \"Sunset Boulevard\" hit Hollywood where it hurt most, commenting on the movie industry's treatment of stars who are past their prime.\n\nEventually, the phrase \"past his prime\" applied to Wilder, too. Like many veterans, he received scant regard from dollar-oriented New Hollywood.\n\n\"Getting a film made now is ridiculous,\" he said in 1989. \"The executives are like Nero in the Coliseum. They can hardly stay awake unless there are car crashes or spaceships.\"\n\nBut he praised such directors as Steven Spielberg and Woody Allen, calling Spielberg's \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" \"marvelous\" and Allen's \"Broadway Danny Rose\" \"an excellent film.\"\n\nWilder's own life was never void of drama. Born and raised in a section of Poland that was then part of the Austrian Empire, he went to Berlin and worked as a crime reporter before writing screenplays for silent films at Berlin's giant UFA movie studio. But he left Germany in 1934 as Hitler's power increased.\n\n\"It seemed the right thing for a Jew to do,\" he said in later years.\n\nThat wry understatement probably camouflaged much sadness. His father, who ran a chain of railway cafes, had died in 1926, but his mother, stepfather and grandmother all perished in concentration camps. His mother had instilled in him a love of all things American. He was born Samuel Wilder, but she nicknamed him \"Billy\" because of her fondness for American folk heroes like Buffalo Bill.\n\nAfter a brief stay in Paris, he came to the United States in 1934 and described his reaction as \"love at first sight.\" He immediately came to Hollywood, where he shared lodgings with another enterprising young talent, character-actor Peter Lorre.\n\nIn 1936 Wilder married Judith Iribe, a union that ended in divorce. He wed Audrey Young in 1949, and their marriage lasted until his death. Socially, they were one of Hollywood's most popular couples, and Wilder's humor served him well at soirees.\n\nHe once said that a director must be a variety of things. Among them were \"policeman, midwife, psychoanalyst and sycophant.\"\n\nWhatever the actual definition of director, he fulfilled it with the style of a true master."
