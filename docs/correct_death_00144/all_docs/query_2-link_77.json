    "text": "Originally opened in 1901, Angels Flight is a funicular that takes passengers from its Lower Station on Hill Street across from Grand Central Market, up 298 feet to the Top Station at California Plaza on Bunker Hill. Fare for the \"shortest railway in the world\" is $1 each way, or $.50 for Metro TAP Card users. A souvenir round-trip ticket is available for $2. Angels Flight is open daily from 6:45am to 10pm, including weekends and holidays.\n\nAngels Flight has starred in generations of films, including film noirs like Criss Cross (1949), the 1951 remake of M, The Turning Point (1952), Cry of the Hunted (1953), and Kiss Me Deadly (1955).\n\nA late-era film noir, Angel's Flight (1965) is described by AFI as \"prized for its location coverage of [LA's] Bunker Hill neighborhood, which was slowly being razed when filming took place.\" The low budget thriller stars William Thourlby as alcoholic reporter Ben Wylie, who is on the trail of the \"Bunker Hill Killer\" - an exotic dancer named Liz (Indus Arthur). The climax takes place at the funicular.\n\nOther appearances include The Glenn Miller Story (1954), The Exiles (1961), The Muppets (2011), La La Land (2016), and TV shows like Perry Mason (both the original and the 2020 HBO series) and the classic Dragnet. Season 4 of the Amazon series Bosch, which is based on Michael Connelly's sixth Bosch book (also called Angels Flight), features LAPD detective Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch investigating the murder of an attorney on Angels Flight, which appears throughout the season."
