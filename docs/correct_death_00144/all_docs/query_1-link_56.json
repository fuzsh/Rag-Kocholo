Schlatter said Wilder's health had been failing in recent months.\n\nSchlatter said his friend of 40 years had been in failing health in recent months and he believed Wilder had been suffering from a bout with pneumonia.\n\nAs co-writer, director and producer of the 1960 film The Apartment, Wilder collected three Oscars, the only person to do so for one film.\n\nAmong his other classics: Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, The Lost Weekend, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot and Witness for the Prosecution.\n\nWilder was also noted as one of Hollywood's best wits. He once remarked of post-war France: \"It's a country where you can't tear the toilet paper but the currency crumbles in your hands.\" William Holden said Wilder had \"a mind full of razor blades\".\n\nHis films were notable for their clever dialogue and an overlay of cynicism.\n\nAfter beginning his film career in Europe, Wilder came to Hollywood knowing 100 words of English.\n\nHis career peaked with The Apartment, a cynical tale of corporate corruption. Jack Lemmon played an underling who lends his apartment to company executives for trysts with secretaries.\n\nWilder continued filming for 20 years, but except for the 1963 Irma La Douce, he never duplicated his previous successes.\n\nDespite the failures, Wilder was still working on film projects in his 80s. He never lost his wonderment at the magic of movies."
