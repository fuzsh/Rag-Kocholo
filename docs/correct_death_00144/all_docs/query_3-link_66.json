        "text": "Billy Wilder is my favorite writer-director and although he died in 1999, I think it’s appropriate to celebrate today which would have been his 110th birthday. Wilder’s list of movie credits is astounding — check out his IMDb page — showing incredible range. To me, The Apartment is as close to a perfect movie as there is.\n\nSo to honor Mr. Wilder, I’ve aggregated here all of the interviews with the master I have posted over the years, plus other links.\n\nHere is a 13 part breakdown I did of a 1966 Wilder interview with The Paris Review called ‘The Art of Screenwriting’.\n\nHere is a 10 part breakdown of a conversation between Wilder and longtime writing partner I.A.L. “Izzy” Diamond.\n\nHere is my 26 part series of reflections based on the book “Conversations with Wilder” by Cameron Crowe.\n\nFinally here is Wilder accepting the Irving Thalberg Award at the 1988 Academy Awards.\n\nHappy Birthday, Billy Wilder! You may have departed our world, but your cinematic legacy lives on and on!"
