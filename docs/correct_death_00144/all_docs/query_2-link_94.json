    "text": "\"Along the way, in fifty years, Wilde had some great picture ideas, visions of men as pretty (and pretty-talking) reptiles, drunks, fantasists, and sexual wrecks. Of course, he was correct. But with that knowledge, if he'd had a pinch more courage and grace he could have been a great man - instead of just a scathing observer. As it is, too often I feel he's dead, or lost, to the life of his films, a grinning corpse floating on top, preserved by sardonic fluids and voice-over.\" - David Thomson (The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, 2002)"
