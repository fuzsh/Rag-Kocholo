    "text": "HOLLYWOOD — Fans in the media and in showbiz paid tribute over the weekend to Billy Wilder, trying to sum up his amazing life and work.\n\nThe 95-year-old writer-director-producer, who died Wednesday night at his home in Westwood, was known in Hollywood as a resident wit and a consummate art collector. But to the world, he was simply one of Hollywood’s greatest writer-director-producers, whose films ranged from thrillers and melodramas to comedies and romances.\n\nWhen he was honored in 1991 with the Preston Sturges Award, a rare honor given jointly by WGA West and the Directors Guild, Wilder said he’d most like to be remembered as a writer.\n\n“I became a director because I wanted to get the utmost of the script on the screen,” he confessed. He was thrilled that his idol, Ernst Lubitsch, had directed the 1939 “Ninotchka,” co-scripted by Wilder; but he said there were not many Lubitsches around, so to protect his work from less talented helmers, he became one of Hollywood’s first hyphenates.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSix Oscars\n\nActor William Holden once said Wilder had a mind “full of rusty razor blades.” His pics, such as “Double Indemnity,” “Sunset Blvd.” and “Some Like It Hot,” were sophisticated, impeccably constructed studies of human frailty, refracted through a dark mirror — even the comedies. The films won him six Oscars (including a special Thalberg Award) and 21 nominations.\n\nHis films, commenting acutely on American means and mores, often pushed the envelope of conventional morality. “The Lost Weekend” in 1945 took a sympathetic look at the then-taboo subject of alcoholism; only a few years after WWII ended, “A Foreign Affair” mocked U.S. postwar efforts in Europe and “Stalag 17” took a scabrous, often comical look at life in a POW camp.\n\nThe heroes in “Sunset Blvd.,” “The Apartment” and “Kiss Me, Stupid” were willing to do anything to get ahead. And Jack Lemmon learned to revel in a transvestite lifestyle in “Some Like It Hot,” an outrageous attitude for 1959. But auds frequently embraced these assaults on their preconceptions because Wilder’s films featured such sharp writing and performances and such intelligent observations.\n\nSharp-witted, romantic\n\nWilder’s acerbic wit was a product of his Old World sensibility. Yet his films, mostly co-written with one of two partners, Charles Brackett and I.A.L. Diamond, were the product of what critic Andrew Sarris dubbed a closet romantic.\n\n“It’s an old Viennese tradition that comes down from (dramatist Arthur) Schnitzler,” Diamond once commented: “a Middle European attitude, a combination of cynicism and romanticism.”\n\nThe romantic fatalism melded brilliantly in such classic films as “Indemnity” (co-written with Raymond Chandler), “Sunset Blvd.,” “Lost Weekend” and “The Apartment.” The latter two films won Wilder Oscars for his writing and directing. He also won a writing Oscar for “Sunset Blvd.”\n\nBut there were lighter films, such as “Ninotchka” and “Midnight” (which he co-wrote with Brackett) and, later, as a director, “Sabrina” and “Love in the Afternoon,” comedies of manners in the tradition of Lubitsch, Wilder’s mentor.\n\nSon of cafe owner\n\nHe was born Samuel Wilder on June 22, 1906, in the town of Sucha in Galicia, Poland, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Max, who died in 1926, ran a chain of railway cafes. His mother, Eugenia, died at Auschwitz during World War II. She nicknamed her sons Billy and Willy (his older brother Wilhelm became a Hollywood producer under the name W. Lee Wilder), because they sounded American. She had lived briefly in the U.S.\n\nWilder grew up in Vienna, where he became enamored of all things American, such as jazz and Westerns (though he never made a Western). After a brief stab at higher education at the U. of Vienna, Wilder began his career as a journalist at the tabloid Die Stunde. He wrote interviews, crime and sports stories.\n\n(His experience as a reporter later surfaced in the biting “Ace in the Hole” starring Kirk Douglas as an opportunistic, amoral newspaper writer, and in his 1974 remake of “The Front Page.”)\n\nStarted writing scripts\n\nAfter moving to Berlin, he continued to work as a journalist, but was quietly writing scripts for silent films on the side. In 1929 he collaborated with Fred Zinnemann on the script for Robert Siodmak’s “Menschen am Sonntag,” which helped him land a job at Germany’s giant UFA production facility.\n\nBut as a Jew, working for pro-Nazi industrialist Alfred Hugenberg, there was little hope of a future, and Wilder fled to Paris in 1933, a week after the famous Reichstag fire.\n\nHe directed his first film in Paris, the 1933 “Mauvaise Graine,” and was about to start another when he received an offer from Columbia Pictures for his script “Pam Pam” and a six-month contract at $150 a week. It took him two years to learn English.\n\nBut Wilder obviously learned the language well. In 1937, he received his first screen credit on “Music in the Air,” which starred Gloria Swanson. After co-writing (with Hy Kraft) “Champagne Waltz” for Paramount, he was offered a $250-per-week contract.\n\nCornucopia of comedies\n\nWilder remained at Par for 17 years. Soon after his arrival he was paired with Brackett, the former theater critic for the New Yorker. The result was a number of sterling comedy scenarios including “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,” “Midnight” and “Ninotchka” (for MGM), as well as a number of above-average dramas such as “Arise My Love” and “Hold Back the Dawn.”\n\nWilder began collaborating because he was unsure of his English, he said, but continued to partner with Brackett and, later, Diamond, because he found the process of writing “suicidally boring.”\n\nBrackett served as producer on Wilder’s U.S. directorial debut, the 1942 “The Major and the Minor,” a light comedy starring Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. The next year, he did a 180-degree turn with “Five Graves to Cairo,” but neither pic prepared anyone for 1944’s searing “Double Indemnity,” based on James M. Cain’s novel. The quintessential film noir was one of Chandler’s few screen credits.\n\n“The Lost Weekend,” a harrowing tale of alcoholism, won four Academy Awards for 1945, including two for Wilder, and shared the Grand Prix at the first Cannes Film Fest in 1946, where star Milland took best actor kudos.\n\nHelped film industry\n\nAfter the war Wilder spent six months in Germany helping in the restructuring of the UFA-dominated film industry. “It was like somebody opened the door to Dante’s Inferno and you’re walking through the Inferno like it’s a museum,” he said of the experience. “It was a very hot summer, and the smell of the corpses was everywhere.”\n\nThe memories of what he saw, and the loss of his mother, stepfather and grandmother, informed the 1948 black comedy “A Foreign Affair,” starring Jean Arthur and Marlene Dietrich. The political satire of Americans in postwar Germany was denounced in Congress and by the Defense Dept.\n\nThat same year, he helmed “The Emperor Waltz.”\n\nHis palate became ever darker with the lacerating 1950 “Sunset Blvd.,” starring William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich Von Stroheim, still considered one of the best films ever made about Hollywood.\n\nCynical and bracing\n\n“Ace in the Hole” and “Stalag 17” were similarly cynical and bracing, but Wilder also directed several comedies in the ’50s, starting with “Sabrina” and ending with one of the great American film comedies, “Some Like It Hot” in 1959.\n\nIn between was 1955’s “The Seven Year Itch,” which featured Marilyn Monroe in that infamous pose, her white dress billowing as she stands over a gust of air rising from a subway grate.\n\nAlso during that time he tackled the Agatha Christie drama “Witness for the Prosecution” and the biography of Charles Lindbergh, “The Spirit of St. Louis.”\n\nWilder’s second directing Oscar and his third writing Oscar (with his new partner Diamond) came in 1960 for the satiric drama “The Apartment,” which also earned him an Academy Award as producer.\n\nMocked Cold War\n\nLess successful, but highly praised, was the 1961 “One, Two Three,” which, like “The Apartment,” was a pointed commentary on American capitalism and which dared to mock America’s top source of anxiety, the Cold War. In 1963, his “Irma la Douce,” a nonmusical adaptation of the stage tuner, was one of the first Hollywood films to take a lighthearted look at prostitutes.\n\nBy the mid-’60s, the industry had changed. Through the end of the 1970s, Wilder continued to make interesting and quirky films including “The Fortune Cookie,” “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,” “Avanti” and “Fedora,” but they did not compare to his vintage work and did not capture the era’s zeitgeist. His last film was the 1981 dark comedy “Buddy, Buddy,” starring Lemmon and Walter Matthau, with whom he’d previously worked in “Fortune” and “Front Page.”\n\n“I’ve been floundering,” Wilder admitted in 1982 when he was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. “People say, ‘It wasn’t your year.’ Well, it hasn’t been my decade. I guess I lost contact with the audience.”\n\nBut more than that, Wilder had become apprehensive about catering to the “blockbuster” mentality that had overtaken Hollywood and his lack of desire to make films on that basis.\n\n“It was more fun to make pictures (in the old studio system). Today it is bloodletting, everybody looking over your shoulder. — We had a better time then.”\n\nProlific perfectionist\n\nEver the perfectionist, in 1991 he abandoned his autobiography after writing 620 pages. “It’s not really what I want,” Wilder said.\n\nStill, his name continued to be attached to film projects throughout the decade, and he continued to dream of making another movie, even after Diamond’s death in 1988. That year, Wilder received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences’ Irving Thalberg Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nWilder was married for 11 years to Judith Copicus Iribe starting in 1937. They had twins Victoria and Vincent. Vincent died shortly after birth.\n\nShortly after their divorce in 1949, he married a young actress and singer, Audrey Young. The couple resided in a large apartment on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood, the home of Wilder’s noted art collection — some of which was destroyed in a fire several years ago.\n\nHis widow, Audrey, last Thursday told Daily Variety‘s Army Archerd “Anybody who was around him learned something if only by osmosis.”\n\nThere will be no funeral. A memorial will be planned for later in the year.\n\nIn addition to his wife and daughter, Wilder is survived by nephew Myles Wilder and grandniece Kim Wilder-Lee, both writers.\n\n(Timothy M.
