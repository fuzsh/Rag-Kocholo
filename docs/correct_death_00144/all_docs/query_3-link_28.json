    "text": "Oscar-winning filmmaker Billy Wilder, the Austrian-born cynic whose gifts for writing and directing led to such classics as \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Some Like it Hot\" and \"Double Indemnity\", has died, a family friend said today. He was 95.\n\nWilder died last night at his home, said George Schlatter, a producer and long-time friend. Schlatter said Wilder's health had been failing in recent months.\n\nSchlatter said he believed his friend of 40 years had been suffering from pneumonia.\n\nAs co-writer, director and producer of the 1960 film \"The Apartment\", Wilder collected three Oscars, the only person to do so for one film.\n\nAmong his other classics: \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Double Indemnity\", \"Stalag 17\", \"The Lost Weekend\", \"The Seven Year Itch\", \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Witness for the Prosecution\"."
