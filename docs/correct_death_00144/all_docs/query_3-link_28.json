        "text": "Oscar-winning filmmaker Billy Wilder, the Austrian-born cynic whose gifts for writing and directing led to such classics as \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Some Like it Hot\" and \"Double Indemnity\", has died, a family friend said today. He was 95.\n\nWilder died last night at his home, said George Schlatter, a producer and long-time friend. Schlatter said Wilder's health had been failing in recent months.\n\nSchlatter said he believed his friend of 40 years had been suffering from pneumonia.\n\nAs co-writer, director and producer of the 1960 film \"The Apartment\", Wilder collected three Oscars, the only person to do so for one film.\n\nAmong his other classics: \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Double Indemnity\", \"Stalag 17\", \"The Lost Weekend\", \"The Seven Year Itch\", \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Witness for the Prosecution\".\n\nWilder was also noted as one of Hollywood's best wits. He once remarked of postwar France: \"It's a country where you can't tear the toilet paper but the currency crumbles in your hands.\" William Holden said Wilder had \"a mind full of razor blades\".\n\nHis films were notable for their clever dialogue and an overlay of cynicism and betrayal.\n\nHis actors won Oscars for their hard-bitten portrayals: Ray Milland as the unremitting alcoholic in \"The Lost Weekend\", Holden as the suspected prison-camp traitor in \"Stalag 17\", Walter Matthau as an insurance cheater in \"The Fortune Cookie\".\n\n\"Making movies is a little like walking into a dark room,\" he once mused. \"Some people stumble across furniture, others break their legs, but some of us see better in the dark than others. The ultimate trick is to convince, persuade. Every single person out there is an idiot, but collectively they're a genius.\"\n\nAfter beginning his film career in Europe, Wilder came to Hollywood knowing 100 words of English. His fortunes turned in 1938 when he first teamed with Charles Brackett, a polished, erudite member of New York's literary establishment.\n\nBrackett's refinement and Wilder's \"vulgar energy\" produced such scripts as \"Midnight\", \"Hold Back the Dawn\", \"Bluebeard's Eighth Wife\" and the Greta Garbo comedy \"Ninotchka\".\n\nThe collaboration lasted 12 years, then Wilder wrote with the late I.A.L. \"Izzy\" Diamond for 30 years. Unsure in English - he spoke with an accent after six decades in America - he always needed a writing partner.\n\nWilder began directing with \"The Major and the Minor\", a 1942 comedy with Ginger Rogers and Milland. With \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Lost Weekend\", he became a major director as well as writer; the latter brought Oscars in both categories.\n\nBrackett, who produced their films, and Wilder ended the partnership with \"Sunset Boulevard\", which brought Wilder a writing Oscar. From then on, Wilder produced his own films.\n\nAfter directing Marilyn Monroe in her two best comedies, \"The Seven Year Itch\" and \"Some Like It Hot\", Wilder said he would never again direct the chronically tardy star.\n\n\"I have discussed this with my doctor and my psychiatrist and my accountant, and they tell me I am too old and too rich to go through this again,\" he said.\n\nThe Wilder career peaked with \"The Apartment\", a cynical tale of corporate corruption.\n\nJack Lemmon played an underling who lends his apartment to company executives for trysts with secretaries. Shirley MacLaine was the romantic victim of a lying boss, Fred MacMurray, in a rare change of type (his other: \"Double Indemnity\").\n\nWilder continued filming for 20 years, but except for the 1963 \"Irma La Douce\", he never duplicated his previous successes.\n\nThe later films: \"One, Two, Three\", \"Kiss Me, Stupid\", \"The Fortune Cookie\", \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\", \"Avanti!\", \"The Front Page\", \"Fedora.\" His last film was \"Buddy Buddy\" in 1981 with Lemmon and Matthau.\n\nDespite the failures, Wilder was still working on film projects in his 80s. He never lost his wonderment at the magic of movies.\n\nIn his late years, Wilder was laden with honors, including the Motion Picture Academy's Irving Thalberg award for a consistently high level of production and the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, both in 1988.\n\nWhen the film institute ran a survey in 1998 to pick the 100 best American movies, four directed by Wilder made the list; when it picked the 100 funniest American movies in 2000, \"Some Like It Hot\" was No 1.\n\nWilder always looked the same on movie sets: slender, slightly hunched, wearing a sweater with sleeves rolled up, Tyrolean hat and cigar, always with ready wit (\"If there's anything I hate more than being taken seriously, it's being taken too seriously\").\n\nHe was born Samuel Wilder on June 22, 1906, in the small town of Sucha, 160km east of Vienna. The boy haunted theaters that played American films, and admired early stars such as William S Hart and Tom Mix.\n\n\"The guy I really went for was Douglas Fairbanks,\" Wilder said in later years. \"He conquered a screen. And he had such panache in his whole lifestyle.\"\n\nAfter short stints at the University of Vienna and working as a journalist, he broke into the movies when he was hired to write a semidocumentary, \"People on Sunday\", in 1929.\n\nWilder's screenwriting career flourished until 1933, when Hitler captured power in Germany. Wilder, a Jew, fled to Paris; his mother, grandmother and stepfather died at Auschwitz.\n\nHe co-directed a film with Danielle Darrieux, and then left for the United States after receiving an offer to write scripts for Columbia Pictures at $US150-a-week.\n\nA first marriage to a California socialite ended in 1947 after nine years; they had a daughter, Victoria."
