        "text": "It’s 1988 and Billy Wilder sits in his Beverly Hills office. Fielding a question about comedic pacing, the 83-year-old, seven-time Oscar winner takes a bamboo back scratcher and works a shoulder. Then he reads a scene from “Some Like It Hot,” his and I.A.L. Diamond’s deliciously gender-bending and persistently contemporary comedy.\n\nTony Curtis’ character, Joe, climbs into the hotel room of friend Jerry, played by Jack Lemmon. The two are on the lam from the mob, hiding out by donning drag.\n\n“Have I got things to tell you!” Jerry says, lying on a bed in a wig and dress, humming blissfully as he shakes maracas.\n\n“What happened?” Joe asks.\n\n“I’m engaged.”\n\n“Congratulations,” says Joe, dressed for the moment as a tycoon to impress Marilyn Monroe’s songbird Sugar Kane. “Who’s the lucky girl?”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“WHAT?”\n\n“Osgood proposed to me. We’re planning a June wedding.”\n\n“What are you talking about? You can’t marry Osgood.”\n\nJerry gets up, perplexed. “You think he’s too old for me?”\n\nEven if those were the only punch lines, they would be golden. But Wilder and Diamond teased their “who’s-on-\n\nfirst?” gimmick into a shtick that defies bigotry.\n\n“From the moment the guy says ‘I’m engaged,’ the thing works,” Wilder tells German director Volker Schlöndorff.\n\nNext month, an inviting two-disc collector’s edition of that savvy 1959 comedy hits stores (July 18, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, $24.96).\n\nWilder would have turned 100 on Thursday. To mark the centenary of the director’s birth, Turner Classic Movies celebrates with the American premiere of Schlöndorff’s documentary “Billy Wilder Speaks.” (TCM at 6 p.m. Thursday.)\n\nFor years, the 1979 winner of the foreign language Oscar (“The Tin Drum” ) wanted to interview Wilder. In 1988, the writer-director finally consented with the caveat that the film not be shown until after his death. He died in 2002.\n\nThe documentary originally was made for German television, and the two men swing between English and German (subtitled). Born in 1906 in what is now Poland, Wilder fled the Nazis, landing in Paris before heading to the U.S. and Hollywood in 1933. (His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at Auschwitz.)\n\nAs biographical documentaries go, “Wilder Speaks” feels too much like a rangy tutorial, with Schlöndorff as the avid student. Then again, who can blame him? Wilder remains the second-most-nominated director in Academy history, after William Wyler.\n\nThe movie’s title echoes MGM’s marketing hook – “Garbo Laughs!” – for Ernst Lubitsch’s 1939 “Ninotchka.” Wilder penned that comedy with long-time writing partner Charles Brackett.\n\nIn addition to “Billy Wilder Speaks,” TCM will air six Wilder movies: “The Lost Weekend,” “Sabrina,” “Sunset Boulevard,” “Foreign Affair,” “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,” and “Double Indemnity.” Except for “Double Indemnity,” the films run in the wee hours: Set your TiVo or plan a visit to your favorite video purveyor.\n\nWilder co-wrote the noir knockout “Double Indemnity,” based on James M. Cain’s novel, with Raymond Chandler. Fred MacMurray stars as Walter Neff, an insurance agent who engineers the seemingly perfect crime for married fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nBut it’s Edward G. Robinson, as Neff’s boss Barton Keyes,who delivers a startling plunge into the poetic depths when he theorizes about suicides. The riveting last scene between Neff and Keyes proves even the most hard-boiled work can achieve a sentimental grace."
