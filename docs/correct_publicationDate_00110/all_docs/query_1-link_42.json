Heitman, Cape Town, 2 May, 1985.\"\n\nFrom the front flap:\n\n'Although the South African armed forces have attracted world-wide media attention in recent years and have become known as the most powerful and efficient in Southern Africa, comparatively few details of their operations and organisation are known. South African War Machine briefly describes the history of South Africa's armed forces, outlining their roles in the two World Wars and in Korea and explaining how this background has contributed to the unique make-up of South Africa's defence force today. The weapons, organisation and training of each of the South African armed services are fully described with sections on elite formations like 1 Reconnaissance Commando and 44 Parachute Brigade and the special techniques they have developed. The campaigns in South West Africa (Namibia) against the SWAPO guerrillas are fully described as are the various operations in Angola from the initial South African involvement in 1975.'"
