Corrupt, decadent, autocratic, oppressive aliens...\n\n\"For Reasons of State\" they ripped his marriage apart and forced his wife into the bed of another man. Now their empire is in danger and he is the one man in place to stop the alien threat.\n\nBut there's a problem: when the Empire ruined this loyal servant's perfect marriage—and his life—with its political maneuverings they turned Captain Allison Spencer into a junkie.\n\nBut sometimes necessity can bring out the best in a man, no matter how far he's fallen. In a story of personal heroism and individual boldness Drake & Allen bring The Crisis of Empire to a rousing climax.\n\nWhat's worse than a corrupt, decadent, autocratic, oppressive regime?
