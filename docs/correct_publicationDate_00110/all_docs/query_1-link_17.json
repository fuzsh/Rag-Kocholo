        "text": "Praise for the First Edition\n\n“This politically informed book demonstrates how war movies are more than just entertainment. They serve—intentionally or not—as a cultural weapon of global empire. Clearly written, richly researched, and persuasively argued, The Hollywood War Machine is a feast for any opponent of militaristic propaganda.”\n\n—Michael Parenti, author of Superpatriotism and The Culture Struggle\n\n“From Tom Cruise in Top Gun down to United 93, about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hollywood has played a crucial role in implanting militarism, hypermasculinity, and racism deep in the American psyche. Carl Boggs and Tom Pollard’s The Hollywood War Machine is an invaluable contribution to our understanding of American imperialism.”\n\n—Chalmers Johnson, author of Blowback and The Sorrows of Empire\n\n“A critical cultural chronicle of postwar American political history. Engaging and penetrating. . . . It patiently relates the complicity of Hollywood in the culture of American militarism.”\n\n—Jan Nederveen Pieterse, author of Globalization and Culture: Global Mélange\n\n“Opinionated and witty . . . it has fizz.”\n\n—Terrell Carver, author of Engels: A Very Short Introduction"
