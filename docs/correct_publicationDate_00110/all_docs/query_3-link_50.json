        "text": "The worldâs first Time Capsule, filled with artifacts and documents that tell the story of 1930s America, was buried at the site of the 1939-1940 New York Worldâs Fair. Time Capsule II was buried ten feet away at the 1964-1965 Fair. Together, the two Time Capsules comprise a message to the future, meant to be opened by the people of the year 6939 A.D. But what if, by that date, all knowledge of the Fairs, of New York City, of the English language itself, has been lost in the mists of time? How were the Futurians to find this hidden trove of knowledge, or know what it contained? The simple but wildly ambitious answer: The Book of Record of the Time Capsuleâa treasure map in book form, intended to teach the Futurians our language, tell them who we were, and lead them to the buried treasure that awaits them. Time Capsule: The Book of Record precisely reproduces every page of the text typesetting and illustrations of the original Book of Record, and includes a brief but detailed history of the Time Capsules and the original Book of Record, brief biographies of the men who created The Book of Record, and a full index."
