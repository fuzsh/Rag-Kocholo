The Libertarian Party and People's Party, a left-wing group, are holding the event to protest U.S. support for Ukraine. They are also calling to \"slash\" the Pentagon budget and \"abolish\" the CIA.\n\nRitter’s withdrawal caps a tumultuous behind-the-scenes debate over whether he should appear at the rally. Libertarian Party leaders asked Ritter to withdraw from the event last week after a Washington Free Beacon report about his criminal past. Ritter was detained twice in 2001 after he arranged meetings with undercover police officers posing as a 14-year-old girl and 15-year-old girl. He was sentenced to prison in 2011 after he masturbated online in front of an undercover cop posing as a 15-year-old girl.\n\nRitter was reinstated to the event after outcry from some of his fellow speakers. Andrew Napolitano, a former Fox News analyst, rallied to Ritter’s defense. So did Tara Reade, the former Joe Biden aide who has leveled unconfirmed sexual assault allegations against the president.\n\nLibertarians called on Ritter again to drop out earlier this week, citing both his sex offender status as well as his comments that Ukraine was akin to a \"rabid dog\" that needed to be put down by Russia.\n\nRitter released text from the speech he planned to give at the rally. In it, Ritter strikes a decidedly pro-Russia tone and recites from Martin Luther King, Jr.’s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, which the civil rights leader gave at the Lincoln Memorial nearly 60 years ago.\n\n\"I too have a dream,\" Ritter says in his prepared remarks. \"That by overcoming the hate generated by systemic Russophobia we can work with our fellow human beings in Russia to create communities of compassion that, when united, make a world filled with nuclear weapons undesirable, and policies built on the principles of mutually beneficial arms control second nature.\"\n\nNick Brana, the head of the People's Party, said it was \"a shame\" that Ritter pulled out of the event.\n\n\"Scott Ritter is a hero who has done more to stop war and save lives than almost anyone on Earth,\" said Brana, who served as national political outreach coordinator for Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nANSWER Coalition Connection\n\nMany of the same individuals and organizations who took part in the Rage Against the War Machine protest also took part in the communist-tied Answer Coalition demonstration on March 18, 2023 to protest Russian sanctions in the wake of the Ukraine invasion:[4]\n\nFrom a flyer on their website:[5]\n\nJill Stein, two-time Green Party presidential candidate\n\nWorld BEYOND War\n\nRoger Waters\n\nGreen Party of the United States\n\nThe Libertarian Institute\n\nPeople's Party\n\nThe Empire Files\n\nAdditional supporters included the Party for Socialism and Liberation, League of Revolutionaries for a New America, Party of Communists USA (PCUSA), League of Young Communists USA (LYCUSA), DC Young Communist League, Peoples School for Marxist-Leninist Studies, Communist Party USA - Detroit Club, Green Party of New Jersey, National Lawyers Guild International Committee.
