Per Deadline’s report, Hughes also co-wrote the script alongside James Beaufort (Machine).\n\nBest known for directing the two Ryan Reynolds-led The Hitman’s Bodyguard movies, Hughes has embarked on another project, this time collaborating with the Reacher star. Hailing from Lionsgate, War Machine is produced by Todd Lieberman, Alex Young, Rich Cook, and Greg McLean.\n\n“In the final 24 Hours of the world’s toughest selection process, a team of Army Rangers encounter a threat beyond their imagination,” the synopsis for War Machine reads (via Deadline).\n\nAlan Ritchon’s other projects\n\nThough best known now as Jack Reacher in Prime Video’s Reacher, the actor first appeared on American Idol as one of the top 87 contestants back in 2004 and got cut not long after. He then went on to appear in recurring roles in Smallville and other small roles before he started playing a major role in 2010 with Blue Mountain State as Thad Castle.\n\nSince then, Ritchson’s career has soared to new heights with television roles in Blood Drive, Titans, and Reacher. The actor also starred in several movies, like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Wedding Ringer, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Office Uprising, Above the Shadows, The Turkey Bowl, and Fast X.\n\nProduction for Reacher Season 3 will resume soon, with Ritchson reprising his role. He is also currently filming for Playdate, an upcoming action comedy starring Kevin James. In addition to War Machine, Ritchson will next star in Guy Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare opposite Henry Cavill and will star as Aimes once again in the still-untitled Fast and Furious 11th installment."
