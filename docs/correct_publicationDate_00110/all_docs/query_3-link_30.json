        "text": "Roger MacBride Allen's Web Page\n\nSome Somewhat Elderly Essays\n\nI attended the the Wrangling with Writers Conferences 24-26 September, 2010, in Tucson, Arizona. These files are a bit long in the tooth, but I think the observations and advice are still valid. All files are in PDF format, so you'll need Adobe Reader or the like. You can right-click on the links and save the files direct to your own computer. Enjoy.\n\nManuscript Style <<>> The Standard Deviations of Writing<<>> Notes for Talks I Presented at the Conference <<>> <<>>Why Media Tie-Ins Are Tough<<>>\n\nAnd here's an essay full of the worst advice ever offered: How to Submit a Manuscript\n\nBut wait -- here's more advice, maybe even good advice this time, in the form of some very bad examples.\n\nBook News from Roger:\n\nTwo books co-authored with my father, and a trilogy of science fiction detective novels:\n\nEssays & Journals Family & Friends Links to other Pages of interest\n\nA Quick Note from the Proprietor ...\n\nThis photo is alarmingly out of date. I'll try to dig up one that reflects my current and more decrepit condition.\n\nAlmost everything below this point on the page is years out of date. However, there are suddenly (a) incentives for updating it and (b) maybe the time to do it -- both at the same time! How about that! So I hope to refurb more of this material Real Soon*\n\nAll the best --\n\nRoger\n\n*That's not accidental bad grammar -- it's a Buckaroo Banzai reference.\n\n(Just between us chickens, everything below this point on the page is amazingly out of date, but repairs elsewhere must needs take precedence. Things went blooie, folks.)\n\n20 July 2005. Happy Moonday! (35th Anniversary of the first Moon landing.) As ever and always, I have been very late in getting this site up to date.We're moving back to the United States next week, after three years here in Germany, and there is a lot to do -- so I STILL won't get this thing up to date. Suffice to say, for the moment, that I have I delivered the revisions on a new novel to Bantam, and I'm waiting to hear back.(Current planned title is BSI STARSIDE: THE CAUSE OF DEATH.) Two day after we return to America, I am going to my 30th high school reunion -- and that ought to be interesting as well. I am looking forward to more time to work on my books, on FoxAcre Press, and about 53 other things. Probably I won't actually have the time,, but hope springs eternal. More soon. I promise.\n\n15 August 2004. It's been forever since I updated this thing -- long enough for us to have a new baby, James Maury Allen-- see his brother's website at www.matthew-tom.com for more details -- and for me to write and publish THE SHORES OF TOMORROW, the final book in the trilogy started by THE DEPTHS OF TIME and THE OCEAN OF YEARS. I am nearly done with the next book, but more on that later. There's lots of other news too, but it will all have to wait until I get the current book done...\n\n20 May 2003. We're gearing up for a visit home for about two weeks. Various travel snafus result in my wife travelling by herself via the direct route, while I travel with our son by a longer and more complicated route, via cab, train, bus, car, two flights, sixteen hours, and three countries -- if all goes well. Those who have travelled with a four-year-old will understand my lack of enthusiasm. Time to stock up on coloring books...\n\n31 January 2003: Well, we've been in Leipzig, Germany, since September 15, 2002, and about as settled in as we're going to get. Yesterday I finished the first draft of THE SHORES OF TOMORROW (see link above) so maybe I'll have more time to write about what's going on here.\n\nWrite to me at rmallen@attglobal.net.

The Shores of Tomorrow is now available from bookstores and online booksellers.\n\n20 May 2003. Well, the manuscript has been back and forth from my editor, and I have now completed the basic proofreading on THE SHORES OF TOMORROW, and everything seems to be moving along smoothly.\n\nOn 30 January 2003, I completed the first draft of THE SHORES OF TOMORROW, third book in the trilogy started by THE DEPTHS OF TIME and THE OCEAN OF YEARS. This series is grand-scale science fiction of the far future that takes in time travel, terraforming, interstellar travel, wormholes, and a mystery centuries old.

Well, maybe that's an exageration, but there haven't been many earth-shattering developments around here. Between proof-reading my manuscript and my work on various projects for FoxAcre Press, I don't get out much.\n\nNot Quite So New\n\nMy book, THE GAME OF WORLDS, won the HAL CLEMENT AWARD for 2000. It is part of OUT OF TIME, a series developed by David Brin, and featuring books by Nancy Kress and Sheila Finch.\n\nJump to the GAME OF WORLDS info page\n\nYanked! by Nancy Kress\n\nTiger in Sky by Sheila Finch\n\nThe Game of Worlds by Roger MacBride Allen\n\nClick on a title or book cover to go directly to that book's order page on WWW.AMAZON.COM.

Old columns from THE VIEW FROM HERE are also available. I haven't done a column in a long, long time. Until I get some new one posted, click here to see the old columns.\n\nIt's a bit long in the tooth, but here's our 1997 Summer Travel Journal. This journal covers the period of our departure from Brazil, our travels and visits about Jamaica and the United States, and our return to the Washington, D.C. area. Click on 1997 Summer Travel Journal. There are no doubt typos galore in it, but it was entered from the road under make-it-up-as-you-go-along conditions. But, for all of that, it's an accurate, and I hope entertaining, account of what life was like for Eleanore and myself during that long and complicated trip.\n\nIt's several years old now, but here's my Winter 1996-97 Travel Journal details my adventures over the Christmas break in Brasilia, Sao Paulo, Atlanta, San Francisco, Carmel, Fresno, Salt Lake City, New York City, Washington, Chicago, Evanston, Detroit, and London. It was quite a trip.\n\nTo learn more about the Writers' Workshop I used to teach on CompuServe Science Fiction Literature Forum, click on Workshop.\n\nClick Here to see what I've learned from years spent in teaching the craft of writing fiction.\n\nThis link will lead you to a discussion of Media Tie-Ins and why it is not only just impossible for a beginning writer to get one published, but also why it a bad idea to take the gamble. The short form: your odds of success are far greater if you write your own completely original material.\n\nAnd in a somewhat less serious vein, Click Here to see how the professionals format manuscripts, prepare cover letters, and prepare the all-important Self-Addressed Stamped Envelope.\n\nIn January 1998, USA Today's Online Edition asked me to write the opening of a science fiction story. Readers were invited to submit the subsequent paragraphs of the story. My job, at the end of January, was to come in and do the ending. It sounded like fun to me. It was a fascinating and entertaining exercise for me. Every one of the co-authors took the story in a quite unexpected direction. Trying to get at least some of their ideas worked into my ending was far from easy. I also have to admit that the word-length limits were a real challenge. I am used to working in hundreds of thousands of words. I had to compress my contribution down to the absolute bare minimum. It was a fun and interesting challenge. This link will take you to the resulting story.\n\nClick here to see a complete list of my books in print.\n\nClick here to write to me at my email address, rmallen@attglobal.net\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nBook News\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nClick here for a complete list of my books.\n\nMy latest novel, THE DEPTHS OF TIME was published at the end of February, 2000. It is the beginning of THE CHRONICLES OF SOLACE, and tells the story of a far-future society where both a carefully controlled form of time travel and a less-well-controlled form of terraforming are in common use. It is also the story of what happens when something goes terribly wrong with both technologies... This is a new start for me, and is unrelated to any of my previous work. I am quite pleased with it. Click here to read Chapter One. Or else have a look at the quite favorable reviews.\n\nUTOPIA, was a MAIN SELECTION for the Science Fiction Book Club in February, 1997. UTOPIA was published by Ace Books in a trade paperback edition in November 1996. I have had several books at the SFBC in the past, but never as a Main Selection. It's a tremendous honor, and I am absolutely delighted by the news. Click on the book cover to see a sample chapter.\n\nUTOPIA , published in November 1996 in trade paperback by Ace Books, is the third book of a trilogy of Asimovian robot novels. The previous two volumes in the series, CALIBAN and INFERNO, were quite well received, and I think -- or at least hope -- that UTOPIA will bring the series to a satisfactory conclusion. Millennium Books is publishing the series in Great Britain. Click here to see a sample chapter of UTOPIA.\n\nIn 1995 I published a trilogy of STAR WARS novels, {Bantam Books, paperback, 1995}. These are AMBUSH AT CORELLIA, ASSAULT AT SELONIA, and SHOWDOWN AT CENTERPOINT. All three books are currently available. To describe the books very briefly, they describe the journey of Han Solo and his family to Han's home planet of Corellia -- where they stumble into the middle of a dangerous rebellion against the New Republic. I am pleased to report that these three books each spent about a month on the New York Times Bestseller List\n\nI receive manyqueries, asking if I plan to do any further work in the series of books started with THE RING OF CHARON and THE SHATTERED SPHERE. The answer is yes -- but not just yet. I have not decide when I will write the next one, but I definitely will write it. I have always intended to write an open-ended series of book in this universe. I plan to call the next one THE FALLING WORLD. I looked over my notes for that book a while back, and I must admit reading them made me want to get started on it soon. However -- I do have other books I want to write as well. Sooner or later, I will juggle my time enough to let me make a start on THE FALLING WORLD. I'll keep you posted.\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nAmong my other recent works are --\n\nALLIES & ALIENS (Baen Books, paperback, June, 1995).\n\nTHE SHATTERED SPHERE (Tor Books, hardcover July, 1994, paperback September 1995)\n\nISAAC ASIMOV'S INFERNO (Ace Books, trade paperback, October 1994).\n\nClick here for details on these and other books.\n\nFamily, Friends, and Everyday Life\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nClick Here for a brief biography of Roger MacBride Allen\n\nClick HERE or on the picture for the latest photos of our son, MATTHEW THOMAS ALLEN.
