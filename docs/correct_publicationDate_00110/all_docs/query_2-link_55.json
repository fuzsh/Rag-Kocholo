        "text": "Brad Pitt’s new vehicle, “War Machine,” written and directed by David Michôd, is a political satire that grapples with its subject only half-acidly. (It’s available on Netflix, which financed and distributed the film and is also giving it a minimal theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles.) The movie is a dramatization of the 2012 book “The Operators,” by the late Michael Hastings, which was itself an expansion of Hastings’s 2010 Rolling Stone_ _profile of General Stanley McChrystal, who at the time had recently been named the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. The article, which exposed behavior on the part of McChrystal and his staff that ranged from cavalier to insubordinate, quickly cost McChrystal his post. (That, too, is fictionalized in “War Machine.”)\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that a film based on such material and endowed with such a talented cast (including Anthony Michael Hall, Ben Kingsley, Lakeith Stanfield, Meg Tilly, Emory Cohen, Tilda Swinton, and Topher Grace, along with Pitt) wouldn’t be at least baseline engaging, and so it is, for the most part. But it’s no mere entertainment; it addresses such mighty matters as the war in Afghanistan, the American way of war, the diplomatic glue of international relations, and the role of journalism in the political order, and does so only superficially. In dramatizing the oblivious frivolity at the core of the American command, it takes on some of that frivolity, fluctuating in tone between antic comedy and earnest realism, and achieving neither with any uninhibited precision.\n\nPitt stars as General Glen McMahon, a hands-on soldier as well as a military scholar, a master administrator as well as a skilled strategist, who was brought in to handle a seemingly impossible situation: to win an unwinnable war. “War Machine” dramatizes McMahon’s own devotedly single-minded efforts to win it nonetheless—and the intellectual gymnastics involved in his own deluded and self-deluding efforts to define that elusive victory (or to define it down). As part of the political side to his work—and a not-unconnected taste for his own newfound celebrity—McMahon allows a Rolling Stone reporter named Sean Cullen (Scoot McNairy) to embed with his command. Sean observes and reports on McMahon and his staff’s contemptuous remarks about President Barack Obama and his Administration, as well as some out-of-control partying on a business trip in Europe that was intended to secure additional troop commitments; soon after the article appears, Obama fires McMahon. (This, of course, is what happened to McChrystal, too.)\n\nThe movie is full of portraits à clef, including McMahon’s second-in-command, a general named Greg Pulver (played by Hall), who is a stand-in for Michael Flynn; a diplomat named Dick Waddle (Nicholas Jones), who, as the late Richard Holbrooke did, makes a point of not wanting to be called Dick; and even a surrogate for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (There’s also a brief impersonation of Barack Obama, by the actor Reggie Brown.)\n\nI’ve seen the film both in a screening room and on my computer, and watching it on the small screen wasn’t any less of an experience—or, rather, seeing it on the big screen wasn’t any more of one. The most significant and imaginative thing in the movie is a voice, namely, Sean Cullen’s—the entire movie is narrated from the perspective of the journalist, who shows up midway through the action and stays onscreen only briefly, but whose reporting and perspective inform the whole story. Michôd’s meshing of the voice-over with the onscreen character is admirably deft but ultimately insubstantial, offering too little of the character behind that voice—of Sean’s own character, interests, and motives—and none of the passion and discernment behind the report.\n\nAs General McMahon, Pitt chews and growls his words, strutting and glowering with an air of authority that he rarely actually conveys. It’s a movie that depends on the embodiment of voices, the conversion of plans and orders into action. Most of the movie is people talking on camera in the middle distance, as Michôd shows the behind-the-scenes wrangling among officers and between military and civilian authorities, but he doesn’t find much physicality in those voices and rarely makes the cinematic word flesh. His direction is, for the most part, functional and blandly inexpressive, but he allows (or encourages) his cast to do plenty of conspicuous expressing, which hardly helps Pitt, whose fervent stolidity is an ideal trait for the role of McMahon. (A director better attuned to the blend of subject matter and personnel would have located pathos in the compact tension of a sincerely, even passionately, misguided warrior.)\n\nThe movie interweaves many strands of absurdity, starting with the ongoing American and international military presence in Afghanistan, continuing to the vagueness of the mission there, and including the contrast between the serious import of military might and the office-bound bureaucratic impracticality of military policy, as well as the earnestness of military service and the frivolity of military life, and the detachment of military life from that of civilians. The best touches in the film make much of those contrasts in the pathos of secondary characters—in the bumbling but painfully self-aware figure of the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai (Kingsley); in the anguish of a brave and talented soldier, Billy Cole (Stanfield), who is involved in a monstrous and misguided mission; and, above all, in the sacrifices endured out of the spotlight by McMahon’s wife, Jeannie (Tilly), whose steadfast support of her husband comes at the high price of solitude, pain, and silence.\n\nThat’s why the movie’s flatness, its superficial approach to its material, is all the more disappointing. For instance, though gender plays such a striking role in the film’s emotional temperature, there are no women serving at the base that McMahon commands; it’s a man’s world, even more than in a Second World War battlefield drama, and Michôd can’t be bothered to wonder why that is so. Race is a factor—only Cole (one of just two black soldiers with roles in the outfit) raises doubts about the mission—but Michôd doesn’t approach this fact dramatically, either. Above all, however, the movie’s failure is due to more than any particular dramatic omission; it’s due to an over-all (and fairly common) misconception regarding both screenwriting and direction—the failure to take into cinematic account the essential differences between nonfiction and fiction. It’s enough for a journalist such as Hastings to observe events and to describe in insightful detail what he sees, experiences, and learns. The virtue of fiction is to go beyond the events. That’s especially necessary in a film such as “War Machine,” which is no mere sketch of actions within the director’s immediate purview but a political and intellectual study of rot at the core of American politics, in one particular group of officers—and at the core of one particular officer of outsized character and outsized power, whose great virtues and great vices seem inseparable. While considering what was missing from the film, I recalled a passage from the great cinematographer Arthur Jafa, whose 1992 essay “Black Visual Intonation” offers a critical touchstone of directorial imagination:\n\nI like to think about films and the kinds of things that are possible. For example, I want to do Martin Luther King’s life in the style of “In the Realm of the Senses” (Nagisa Oshima’s amazing hard-core feature). I want to do Malcolm X’s life as a series of moments—Malcolm arriving home at two o’clock in the morning and looking at his little girls asleep. . . . And I would like to know what kind of version of Little Richard’s life Andrei Tarkovsky would do.\n\nIn “War Machine,” the absolute absence of intimacy, of psychology, of characters’ self-revelation in thought and desire, is a failure of form and style as much as of content. Michôd takes on an enormous subject that calls for enormous imagination, enormous creativity, enormous audacity, and he renders it anecdotal, ordinary, trivial."
