        "text": "That grimace. Brad Pitt's face in \"War Machine\" looks like a political cartoon of a military commander brought to life. The rest of the movie, available today on Netflix, isn't as broadly satirical in depicting the U.S. role in the long, long war in Afghanistan. But is that a good thing?\n\n\"You can't build a nation at gunpoint,\" says the film's narrator, a Rolling Stone journalist named Sean Cullen (Scoot McNairy). He's based on the late Michael Hastings, whose book \"The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan\" inspired the film.\n\nPitt plays Gen. Glen McMahon, a fictionalized version of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. In real life, McChrystal lost his assignment as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan after Hastings wrote about him in a controversial 2010 Rolling Stone article, “The Runaway General.\" Here, it's 2009 and McMahon is just arriving to his new job, bringing misplaced confidence to a quagmire of flawed policies and assumptions.\n\nAs interpreted with scenery-chewing gusto by Brad Pitt, McMahon is unafraid to stir trouble, beloved by his closest aides and nicknamed “the Glenimal” for his ultra-gung-ho style. Even while sitting on the toilet, McMahon seems to be at attention, never at ease.\n\nWhen McMahon is told not to ask for more troops, he requests 40,000 more troops. When he's informed a certain region is unconquerable and not really crucial, he announces plans to take it anyway. As a symbol of hubris and optimism, Pitt tries to be everything bad and good about America's intentions simultaneously. And that's a tall order for any performance.\n\nThe good news is the acting is never dull. The cast is stacked with pros like Anthony Michael Hall as McMahon’s no-nonsense military colleague, Topher Grace as a too-hip media consultant contractor who invites Cullen into the inner circle, and Ben Kingsley as a comic relief version of past Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai. Particularly powerful is Meg Tilly, who deserves to be seen more on screen. As McMahon’s sturdy but often ignored wife, she provides a devastating moment when she quietly shares her calculation that she's only spent 30 days per year with her husband for the past eight years.\n\nThere’s a tinge of “The Big Short” in the way McMahon's downfall unfolds in the midst of civilian-vs.-military head-butting and brash assumptions. There's also a late-in-the-game attempt to focus seriously on the soldiers who are pawns of McMahon's certainty. This lack of a consistent tone keeps \"War Machine\" from achieving its mission goals.\n\nBut it's sort of fascinating to watch Pitt aim for something close to George C. Scott's hyper-confident Gen. Buck Turgidson from the Stanley Kubrick 1964 Cold War classic \"Dr. Strangelove.\" With his perma-squint and a raspy growl that's very Scott-esque, Pitt seems determined to become larger than life. But, like the general he plays, Pitt can't win through personal commitment alone, no matter how hard he tries."
