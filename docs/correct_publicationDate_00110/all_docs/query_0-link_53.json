        "text": "Last modified: 02 April 2024\n\nIn June 1996 in rec.arts.books I asked if anyone knew of novels where the author inserted footnotes. There were many followups and some personal replies and I put together a summary, which I also posted. In July, I asked a similar question about indexes. I didnât get very many responses (indexes are a much less common device in fiction) so I just added that list here. Since then Iâve made a number of additions to both lists.\n\nIf you know of any other works of fiction that use footnotes or have an index, please let me know. Comments and elaborations are welcome. Thanks to everyone whoâs sent me mail about this.\n\nFor a long list of pre-1900 works with footnotes, see Miriam Lahrsowâs Self-Annotated Literary Works 1300-1900: An Extensive Collection of Titles and Selected Metadata.\n\nAnd when I say footnotes, I include endnotes.\n\nJ.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst: S. The footnotes are by the fictional translator of the novel-within-a-novel Ship of Theseus.\n\nDouglas Adams: the Hitchhiker Trilogy (specifically the first book).\n\nRoger MacBride Allen: âMonkey Seeâ (collected in Whatdunits, edited by Mike Resnick). An epistolary mystery, with letters by three scientists, and footnotes clarifying and arguing points.\n\nMargery Allingham: Death of a Ghost (1934).\n\nEric Ambler: The Dark Frontier.\n\nPiers Anthony: the 1989 Tor edition of But What of Earth?. Footnotes are comments by various editors who had rejected the manuscript.\n\nIsaac Asimov: Foundation, Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation, one each book, where the first quote from the Encyclopedia Galatica gets a citation. (Perhaps other Foundation books too?). Also, Murder at the ABA, where Asimov argues with the narrator, Darius Just.\n\nPaul Auster: Oracle Night (2003).\n\nNicholson Baker: The Mezzanine (1988).\n\nJ.G. Ballard: âNotes Towards a Mental Breakdown,â collected in War Fever. Itâs âone sentence (âA discharged Broadmoor patient compiles âNotes Towards a Mental Breakdown,â recalling his wifeâs murder, his trial and exoneration.â) and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.â See also the indexes list. As well, The Atrocity Exhibition, a collection of short stories, âmost of which consist of paragraphs with headings, some of which are pseudo-scientific reports. The reissue in 1990 had a series of marginal annotations by Ballard, about 10,000 words worth.â\n\nWilton Barnhardt: Gospel. Footnotes annotate the gospel the characters seek. Has an index, too.\n\nStephanie Barron (Francine Matthews): Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor: being the first Jane Austen Mystery (1996). Supposed diary account of Jane Austenâs adventures as a detective; includes âeditorialâ footnotes.\n\nRoland Barthes: S/Z.\n\nEmily Barton: The Testament of Yves Gundrun.\n\nL. Frank Baum: Ozma of Oz. One footnote: âIt may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such a common thing as darn stockings. But, if you will stop to think, you will realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings, the same as other people; only it isnât considered quite polite to mention the matter.â\n\nSamuel Beckett: Watt. Nine footnotes, including âHaemophilia is, like enlargement of the prostate, an exclusively male disorder. But not in this work.â\n\nLarry Beinhart: American Hero (on which the movie Wag the Dog was based).\n\nJosephine Bell: No Escape (1965).\n\nAnthony Berkeley: The Second Shot (1930), Murder in the Basement (1932), and Trial and Error (1937).\n\nMax Besora: The Adventures and Misadventures of the Extraordinary and Admirable Joan OrpÃ­, Conquistador and Founder of New Catalonia, translated from Catalan into English by Mara Faye Lethem (2021).\n\nPamela Wharton Blanpied: DragonsâAn Introduction to the Modern Infestation.

If youâre interested in fiction with footnotes, you probably already know Borges, and if you donât, go read this book immediately.\n\nKaryn Bosnak: 20 Times a Lady (also published as Whatâs Your Number).\n\nAnthony Boucher: The Case of the Seven of Calvary (1937), The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (1940), Nine Times Nine (1940), The Case of the Seven Sneezes (1942).\n\nRoger Boylan: Killoyle: An Irish Farce and The Great Pint-Pulling Olympiad: A Mostly Irish Farce (the excerpt has 18 footnotes).\n\nT.C. Boyle: The Women (2009).\n\nMax Brooks: World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\n\nJohn Brunner: The Shockwave Rider. Itâs actually a footnote from a quoted piece of text.\n\nSteven Brustâs Dumas-inspired Khaavren Romances.\n\nJohn Bude: The Sussex Downs Murder (1936)\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs: A Princess of Mars. ERB is the âeditorâ of John Carterâs manuscript. The one footnote reads, âI have used the word radium in describing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries on Earth I believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base. In Captain Carterâs manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in the written language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it would be too difficult and useless to reproduce.â\n\nJames Branch Cabell.

Footnotes by the supposed author, Major Thompson, and the supposed editor, Daninos, who footnotes some of Thompsonâs footnotes.\n\nJosÃ© de Alencar: Iracema (1865).\n\nSergio De La Pava: Personae.\n\nJohn DeChancieâs Castle series: Castle Perilous etc.\n\nLen Deighton: The Ipcress File.

Dumas has a few footnotes commenting on French history, one of which gets its own endnote in the Oxford Classics edition. La Reine Margot has one footnote, in chapter 36, when Charles IX takes Henri de Navarre to see his mistress and illegitimate son: âThis natural child was afterwards the famous duke dâAngoulÃªme, who died in 1650; and had he been legitimate, would have taken precendence of Henry III, Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, etc. What were we given instead? The mind cannot grasp the implications of such a question.â In the Oxford Worldâs Classics edition, this footnote has an endnote.\n\nMark Dunn: Ibid: A Novel.

A good union man.â âTEDDY ROOSEVELT: An American President.â\n\nIan Fleming: Live and Let Die. One footnote points back to the previous James Bond novel when CIA agent Felix Leiter mentions the âCasino jobâ they worked on: âThis terrifying gambling case is described in the authorâs Casina Royale.â The other is at the start of a lengthy quote from The Travellers Tree by Patrick Leigh Fermor: âThis, one of the great travel books, is published by John Murray at 25s.â\n\nM.A. Foster: The Gameplayers of Zan.\n\nPaul Fournel: Suburbia (original French Banlieue). âIncludes both footnotes and an index ( well as a foreword, an afterword, an âany resemblanceâ disclaimer, two epigraphs, a dedication, a table of contents, introductory notes by the author and the publisher, a supplement for school use, an errata list, and a biographical note), but has no text aside from these paratexts.â\n\nJohn Fowles: The French Lieutenantâs Woman.\n\nGeorge MacDonald Fraser: the entire Flashman series.

The footnotes go off on tangential plots in Battlefield Earth.\n\nGary Jaron: Through the Gate of Dreams. 248 endotes, and a bibliography.\n\nCaptain W.E. Johns: Biggles Defends the Desert. Probably just in this particular edition, published by Red Fox in 1993. The footnotes explain what a Spitfire is, what N.C.O. stands for, that âBocheâ (as in âjolly old Bocheâ) is derogatory slang for Germans, etc. Further checking shows a footnote or two in a 1940s edition of Biggles in the Orient. In fact I think quite a few Biggles books have footnotes.\n\nSusan Johnson: Love Storm, A Touch of Sin, Golden Paradise, and other erotic romance novels.\n\nBen Jonson: Sejanus. Robert Teeter wrote me that âApparently, Ben was concerned that if he didnât back up his play with historical proof, people would think he was writing an allegory advocating overthrow of the monarch(y).â\n\nStephen Graham Jones: Demon Theory. Novelization of a nonexistent horror movie.\n\nJames Joyce: the âlessonsâ chapter of Finnegans Wake.\n\nBilge Karasu: Gece. Itâs in Turkish, and the English translation is Night.\n\nDara Kavanagh: Jabberwock (2023).\n\nHarry Stephen Keeler has a few. The Marceau Case has one footnote. In a letter to Aleck Snide, Jane Trotter refers to Xenius Jonesâ âFourth Day-Mentioned Continuation.â A âPublisherâs Noteâ states, âObviously Jane is referring above to some mention made to her, by Jones, in connection with his criminological theories, of â4th Dimensional Continuum.ââ X. Jones of Scotland Yard, the sequel, also consists of documents like postcards and letters, some of which have footnotes; it also contains a footnote from the publisher directing the reader to another book regarding a certain plot point. Keeler also uses footnotes in Behind That Mask to refer to another book, Finger! Finger!, which involves some of the same events.\n\nPhilip Kerr: The Second Angel. Mostly used for massive information dumps.\n\nGarrison Keillor: Lake Wobegon Days.\n\nC. Daly King: Obelists Fly High (1935).\n\nSophie Kinsella: Iâve Got Your Number.\n\nC.H.B. Kitchin: Death of His Uncle (1939), The Cornish Fox (1949).\n\nRonald Knox: The Viaduct Murder (1926).\n\nR.F. Kuang: Babel: An Arcane History (2022).

Mathematics is not divorced from culture.â\n\nMichael Kun: You Poor Monster.\n\nBarbara Lachman: The Journal of Hildegard of Bingen.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin: The Dispossessed. One footnote, for the word tadde: âPapa. A small child may call any mamme or tadde. Gimarâs tadde may have been her father, an uncle, or an unrelated adult who showed her parental or grandparental responsibility and affection. She may have called several people tadde or mamme, but the word has a more specific use than ammar (brother/sister), which may be used to anybody.â\n\nGaston Leroux: The Mystery of the Yellow Room (1908), The Secret of the Night (1912).\n\nC.S. Lewis: Perelandra. Only one.\n\nHerbert Samuel Lindenberger: Saulâs Fall. âSaulâs Fallâ is also the title of a play, by Orlando Hennessy-Garcia, which is included, and itâs the basis for all the critical essays and papers that fill up the rest of the book. The entire thing (which has footnotes), including the editor of the book, is a fabrication by Lindenberger.\n\nE. Lockhart: The Boyfriend List (2005). A book for teenage girls. A girl recounts stories of all her boyfriends and crushes, heavily laced with footnotes.\n\nJack London: The Iron Heel. Howard Zinn wrote the introduction to the 1971 Bantam edition, and said, âThe footnotes of The Iron Heel, supposedly written many centuries later to inform readers of what life was like in the early twentieth century, still cut deep to fundamental truths.â\n\nDustin Long: Icelander (2006). Prefatory note from the âeditorâ says: âAs the author of Icelander seems to assume at least some knowledge of Magnus Valisonâs The Memoirs of Emily Bean, I have seen fit to scatter a few explanatory footnotes wherever I felt that readers unfamiliar with that series might benefit from a bit of background elucidation.â\n\nBarry Lopez: âRubin Mendoza Vega,â collected in Light Action in the Carribean. Itâs one paragraph with sixteen footnotes.\n\nLisa Lutz: The Spellman Files. Humorous mystery. The footnotes are available for download on their own.\n\nVictor MacClure: The Clue of the Dead Goldfish (1933), Hi-Spy-Kick-the-Can (1936).\n\nPhilip MacDonald: The Rasp (1924), The Link (1930), The Rynox Mystery (1930), The Crime Conductor (1931), Warrant for X (1938).\n\nVirgil Markham: Death in the Dusk (1928).\n\nNgaio Marsh: Vintage Murder (1937).\n\nHerman Melville: Moby-Dick.\n\nJean Merrill: The Pushcart War, a childrenâs novel.\n\nMark Merlis: An Arrowâs Flight.

Much of Peacockâs poetry has footnotes, even poetry for children, such as Sir Hornbook, or Childe Launcelotâs Expedition and The Round Table, or King Arthurâs Feast.\n\nGeorges Perec: Life A Userâs Manual (La Vie mode dâemploi).

Science fiction.\n\nJonathan Stroudâs Bartimaeus Trilogy: The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golemâs Eye, Ptolemyâs Gate. In the first book (and I assume the other two) there are two narratives, one in the first person by a djinni, and he makes heavy use of footnotes. Itâs as close as he can come for humans to his ability to read multiple things at once.\n\nJonathan Swift: A Tale of a Tub.\n\nJulian Symons: The Immaterial Murder Case (1945).\n\nN.A. Temple-Ellis: The Inconsistent Villains (1929).\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray: Vanity Fair. In chapter 28 another authorâs recounting of an incident is footnoted.\n\nLeo Tolstoy: War and Peace.

And there are about eight footnotes in the Harvard Lampoonâs Bored of the Rings.\n\nAmor Towles: A Gentleman in Moscow.\n\nTrevanian: Shibumi. Three footnotes. The first says in part, âSimple social responsibility now dictates that he [the author] avoid exact description of tactics and events which, although, they might be of interest to a handful of readers, might contribute to the harm done to (and by) the uninitiated.â The third explains a Basque joke.\n\nAnthony Trollope: The Warden, in the 1878 edition of this book first published in 1855. In chapter 16 Mr. Harding goes to the Strangersâ Gallery in the House of Commons, and a footnote says of the arrangements, âHow these pleasant things have been altered since this was written a quarter of a century ago! [1878]â Two other footnotes say, âAgain what a change!â\n\nMark Twain: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. A single footnote, in chapter ten: âIf Mr. Harbison had owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as âHarbisonâs Bull,â but a son or a dog of that name was âBull Harbison.ââ\n\nJohn Updike: Memories of the Ford Administration.\n\nS.S.

The inevitable result of a child marriageâ and â2. The subject of this epigrammatic poem is obviously from the provinces, since a native Parisian would take this famous old market for granted.â\n\nJeff VanderMeer, City of Saints and Madmen: The Book of Ambergris.\n\nJack Vance: ânearly allâ of his novels.\n\nJules Verne: Around the World in Eighty Days has one footnote, which gives details on salaries earned by civil servants in British India; Journey to the Centre of the Earth has a few, giving currency exchanges or explaining scientific details.\n\nUrsula Vernon: the Dragonbreath series of childrenâs books.\n\nWilliam T. Vollmann: The Ice Shirt and Fathers and Crows.\n\nVoltaire: LâIngÃ©nu. One footnote: âTous ces noms sont en effet huronsâ (âAll these words are really Huronâ).\n\nHenry Wade: The Hanging Captain (1933), Constable, Guard Thyself (1934), Gold Was Our Grave (1954).\n\nDavid Foster Wallace: Infinite Jest. Lots of them. Lots. He liked footnotes. Also, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.\n\nMargaret Weis and Tracy Hickman: The Death Gate Cycle, a seven-book novel sequence. Possibly also other Weis and Hickman novels, as well.\n\nDonald E. Westlake: Donât Ask (1993). Two chapter headings have footnotes that identify them as âOptionalâhistorical asideânot for credit.â Chapter six mentions a street with âa whole block of taxpayers.â This is footnoted: âA temporary structure, commonly one story in height and containing shops of the most ephemeral sort. Constructed by owners of the land when a delay is anticipated, sometimes of several decadesâ duration, between the razing of the previous unwanted edifice and the erection of the new blight on the landscape. Called a âtaxpayerâ because thatâs what it does.â â The second footnote, indented under the first, says, âDidnât expect a footnote in a novel, did you? And a real informative one, too. Pays to keep on your toes.â\n\nCharles Willeford: The Woman Chaser (1960). A copyright notice for the song âLumpy Gritsâ where its lyrics are included.\n\nColin Wilson: The Mind Parasites.

Footnotes to footnotes.\n\nPaul Auster, Hand to Mouth, his autobiography. Correspondent reports it âhas three footnotes which are given in the end of the book as they are quite lengthy â literally, they are different books themselves: the one is a novel, the baseball thriller Squeeze Play. The second footnote consists of three short plays. The third is a card game.â\n\nThe Pinball Effect and Other Journeys Through Knowledge, James Burke. Has hypertext jumps done with a marginal numbering system.\n\nA Pilgrimage to Al-Medina and Meccah, Sir Richard Francis Burton.

The translator went to the city, compared it with the books, and added in an appendix with photos and tips. My correspondent says you can use the books as city guides.\n\nFrom Hell, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, was heavily annotated by Moore.\n\nPale Fire, Vladimir Nabokov. Analysis of a poem, referenced by line.\n\nThe Martyrology Book Five, bp Nichol. Part of a very long poem; some lines have numbers which indicate jumps to other sections of the book.\n\nLempriereâs Dictionary, Lawrence Norfolk.

However, a German translator became intrigued with them and added 66 pages of glossary and notes.\n\nâA Garland of Ibids,â in A Subtreasury of American Humor, Frank Sullivan (parody of Van Wyck Brooks).\n\nBlue, by Benjamin Zucker. âBased on the structure of the Talmud,â says the Globe and Mail (19 August 2000), âthe novel has at its heart a story running down the centre of each page. Surrounding that column of type are commentaries in voices both of related fictional characters and of unrelated historical figures. Facing each page is a visual document relating either to the main story or one of the commentariesâ¦. It strikes me as a musty curiosity, and a very expensive one at that.â\n\nSome people mentioned critical editions of books. Someone mentioned comic books, which have footnotes to tie the story in to earlier issues.\n\nAnderson, Bruce. The Decline and Fall of Footnotes.\n\nBenstock, Shari. âAt the Margin of Discourse: Footnotes in the Fictional Text.â PMLA (Publications of the Modern Languages Association of America) 98.2 (March 1983), 204â225. Contains such sentences as, âSuch diametrically opposed claims, making notations cooperative with the text but not intrinsic to it and insisting that comments be both inner- and outer-directed, frequently result in a critical appendage that bears an uneasy relation to its parent.â\n\nBurkle-Young, Francis A., and Saundra Rose Maley, The Art of the Footnote: The Intelligent Studentâs Guide to the Art and Science of Annotating Texts.\n\nEffron, Malcah. âOn the Borders of the Page, on the Borders of Genre: Artificial Paratexts in Golden Age Detective Fiction.â Narrative 18.2 (2010), 199â219.
