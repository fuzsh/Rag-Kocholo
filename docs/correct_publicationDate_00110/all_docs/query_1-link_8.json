        "text": "October 29, 2023\n\nFollowing the events in Dubai that killed terror mastermind Hamza al-Saud, Qasim Nadar is a national hero back home in England. The aeronautical engineer is the brains of Britain's newest unmanned stealth drone with A.I. as well as the new leader of al Qadar as a side gig. Political pressure and a lack of intestinal fortitude has resulted in all investigations into Nadar being dropped due to his hero status. Nadar uses his new fame to help further his plan of using Britain's newest weapon of war against itself. Chunk, Whitney and the rest of the team join up with MI-6 to stop Nadar from exacting his revenge that's been decades in the making.\n\nThe definition of automatic in the dictionary is just a picture of Andrews & Wilson's smiling faces. It's absurd how good these guys are and they don't appear to be slowing down any time soon. A&W aren't afraid to take risks and push the bounds of not-- only the story-- but their characters as well. I enjoy the growth of the characters and their interactions as much as the action.\n\nIf you've never read any of their work, Sons of Valor III: War :Machine is a great place to start. All of their work has my highest recommendation.\n\nThank you to Blackstone Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of Sons of Valor III: War Machine.\n\nFebruary 6, 2024\n\nI'm mostly on hiatus from listening/reviewing new stuff - but this has been on my TBL for a bit and I was in the mood. I was not disappointed. While you kinda, sorta could listen to this on it's own - it's best enjoyed after books 1 & 2. There's some events and characters that build up to all the action in War Machine.\n\nAndrews & Wilson have always done a great job giving readers strong, intelligent, and capable female characters - but they elevated that to a new level with Whitney Watts. HOOOOOYAHHHH HEELS!\n\nThere's no great way to describe my love for this book without spoilers. So - you're just going to have to trust me that the pacing, action, suspense, and characters are spot on. Chunk & his team were their fabulous mix of trained, focused, and sometimes hilarious. Even with my busy schedule I was sneaking in listening time anywhere I could because I was so engaged in this. When it got to the last 2 hours I flat out hid in my room to finish it up. Good stuff!\n\nCan't wait for more. A&W have so many series going and they're doing them all well - I don't know what's up next, but I'm in for the ride.\n\nNarration:\n\nRay Porter - you amazing man! Voices, accents, emotion. Seriously, who cries at a Thriller? Me. That's who. I was fully immersed with all these characters (even the bad guys) and Porter's talent makes it even better.\n\nAugust 31, 2023\n\nWhitney Watts and \"Chunk\" Redman is back in Sons Of Valor III: War Machine and it's another masterpiece by writer duo Brian Andrews and Jeffrey Wilson. I think this is one of the best books in this series and due to what happens in this story I wonder what will this group of defenders encounter next? This book is as always well written and full of action and suspense and it deals with some of the troubles with working internationally as well as politically. I really recommend that you try this series and I give a big thanks to Blackstone Publishing, Edelweiss and Netgalley for giving me an advance copy of this great book.\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nI was so excited waiting for this book and it did not disappoint!! Best part was heels getting to be a bigger part of the plot\n\nAugust 20, 2023\n\nAndrews & Wilson have done it again!! Of the three Sons of Valor series this one has more depth and intrigue and explores the personalities of the lead characters. The reader will learn so much more about Chunk, Heels, and we got Lucy again in this book. The bravery and determination that the characters display is very profound and the reader will cheer them on. The language and situations are so true to life that the reader is immersed into the story. I cannot wait for the next Andrews & Wilson book!!\n\nNovember 6, 2023\n\nWar Machine is the third book in the Sons of Valor series, and Andrews and Wilson don’t disappoint.\n\nIn this latest installment, Chunk and the rest of the Tier One SEAL team find themselves back in action, facing what everyone had assumed was a defeated foe—everyone, that is, except Whitney Watts and her MI6 counterpart, Lucy Kim.\n\nAlthough the British government has closed the book on al Qadar, the women launch their own mission to prove the terror group is still very much a clear and present danger.\n\nSons of Valor proves to be a suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end, with Whitney having to go toe to toe with a terrorist mastermind and his cohorts. As Chunk and her other Tier One brothers race to intervene, the counter-terrorism analyst must draw on everything she’s learned from her team to both survive and stop a jihadist lunatic in his tracts.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Blackstone Publishing for allowing me to review this advanced reader copy of War Machine.\n\nApril 21, 2024\n\nThe worst part about reading these books is reaching the last page, and knowing there is going to be a wait before the next chapter in their saga comes out. These characters are so realistic. Their struggles l, their worries, their concerns and fears. the relationship idiosyncrasies are so tangible. I guess that’s one of the things I like most about these stories is the relationship between the gold team and those that are privileged to be in their inner circle. I often wonder how much of what lives out on the pages of these stories are actually happening in the real world that we will never know about them because of men and woman like Lt. Commander Chuck Redman, Whitney Watts and their team. Whitney is pushed to her limit and beyond in this story. There were moments I wasn’t sure how much more she could take, how much longer she would last, or if she could push past the circumstances and challenges. How much can 1 girl endure? We all like to believe we’re strong and can persevere, but you don’t know until you’re in the middle of it. This book was very fast-paced, nailbiting, gut wrenching, hold your breath, and yes, I even cried a few tears. Those are the marks of a good book and an amazing story with incredible characters. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I am so in love with Lt. Commander Redman. I can’t wait to read the next chapter in his story.\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nI love military action books like this one. I also appreciate seeing the same characters book after book and some even in a couple series. It’s easier to get into the action when you’re not starting from square one. I have always liked Chunk and Heels. Their interactions together are intense. I wish some things had ended differently for them but it makes for an interesting build up for the next book.\n\nI thought it was great to see Watts/Heels taking a bigger role. She’s not as seasoned as the tier one men and seems more vulnerable yet still strong. It’s an interesting combination.\n\nThis was an exciting book full of danger. I’d highly recommend it to anyone who likes military fiction. Thank you to Blackstone Publishing for providing me with a free e-copy of this book. All opinions are my own\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nFantastic! The team just knocked another one out of the park!\n\nOkay, I'm getting to the point where I'm not really sure what there is left to say. Obviously, I am a huge fan of this writing duo and there is not really anything that they have written that I have not thought was excellent. This series is no different.\n\nThis book is continuing the overarching story arc following the terrorist Qasim Nadar. We make some enormous strides in his storyline and his part in the story reaches its climax. At this point, we are in the third book in the series and by this point, we have gotten to really understand the dynamics of this team. That makes it even harder when one of the members finds herself in dire circumstances.\n\nThere is a lot that happens in this book and in their magnificent way, the team somehow keeps the tension high throughout the entire book. It feels like the suspense just grows and grows as events begin unfolding and it gets to a point where it is down to the wire.\n\nAs usual, I listened to most of this on audio (In fact, it was a pre-order from Audible) and Ray Porter did his usual amazing job as a narrator. Man, I love anything that Mr. Porter narrates, and I am so glad that he has chosen to narrate this series. I know he signed on with this writing duo several books ago but I am still thrilled each and every time I see his name attached.\n\nI can't wait for whatever is next to come - I am definitely invested.\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nAnother excellent addition to this series. The story picks up from book 2 and keeps going full speed. The writing is descriptive without being overly detailed into unnecessary minutiae. The authors build tension so brilliantly that I couldn’t put down the book. Much of the tension is focused around Whitney with the rest of team providing the ops action. I liked that the epilogue ended the way it did. Otherwise, I think there could have been a future impact to the gold squadron if it had gone a different direction.\n\nHope this series does not end as a trilogy. I definitely would like more of Chunk and the gold squadron. A solid 4.5 stars but I rounded up because A&W never disappoint, and it was another phenomenal narration by Ray Porter.\n\nNovember 10, 2023\n\nThis entry in the Sons of Valor series is great; the character development over the course of the series of books have made these books really enjoyable. The plot was a believable one with the advance in technology happening rapidly, what would happen if terrorists got a hold of an advanced drone? Also, this book wraps up the overarching storyline of Nadar. Will be interesting to see what comes next in story for Chunk, Watts and the gang.. The authors have quickly become my favorites!\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nWhitney goes to London on a hunch to find Nadar and pairs up with a colleague who has befriended Nadars wife. Things go bad and Chunk and the team have a tight timeframe to intervene. Less nuanced than earlier books but an excellent series, fast passed and total escapist fiction. Excellent narration by Ray Porter.\n\nNovember 12, 2023\n\nChunk and Heels\n\nHeels and Chuck. Really good book with a fabulous ending. Well written and a page turner, just like Ben Porter in his five books. Read them also!\n\nNovember 21, 2023\n\nAlways enjoyed this series!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\nProbably my favorite book of the series! What a wonderful book and the twist and turns kept me engaged the entire time!\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nAnother great book in the series Sons of valor 3. The action is strong and but what I really like is the relationship between the characters is so strong. The characters in this series are built so well that I want more. Andrews and Wilson build characters and let us get to know them so well it’s like having a friend or family member written into the book.\n\nDecember 10, 2023\n\nChunk, Heels and team are back in action in Sons of Valor III: War Machine. Andrews and Wilson know how to bring the action, drama, suspense and character relationships that suck you in, keep you engrossed and leave you wanting more when you turn the last page.\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nI absolutely loved this book. The way the authors put heels as a significant part of the story. The book was amazing\n\nNovember 26, 2023\n\nall the action I wanted and the continuing storyline. love the relationships.\n\nLoved it, sad the series may be over. Hour that Chunk and the group return. Looking forward to more stories b6 the authors.\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nThe Best!!\n\nI know this wrapped it up, but it was really the best. I loved the end, except for the wheel agreement, but I know poo that's fluid.\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nI’m really sad there isn’t another book!! Hopefully the authors will write another one.\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\nAwesome!\n\nFantastic as always. The story was gripping and the characters are deep. I can't wait for the next one hopefully.\n\nNovember 17, 2023\n\nThe best just got better! Each entry in the series raises the stakes and delivers a smart, emotional, action packed narrative that has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Highly recommend for everyone! Cannot wait for the next entry!\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nThere is way too much to rave about….just go get the damn book and read it! Get all of the Tier One/Sons of Valor books and read them! Now I have to wait…..damn you Andrews and Wilson!\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nAndrew’s & Wilson do it again! I really liked this book, and I appreciated the way the tied up some loose ends. This book kept me engaged, and I honestly really enjoy how Ray Porter did this book. This book as usual is up to date with tech and current affairs. I can’t wait to find out what happens in the next Sons of Valor novel.\n\nI look forward to all the different novels that Andrews & Wilson put out their characters are great, and their attention to detail is very much appreciated.\n\nAugust 6, 2023\n\nChunk is the man! Great series continues. Every chapter feels like a cliffhanger—-couldn’t put this one down because every time I tried to stop I needed to know what would happen in the next chapter. Alongside Dempsey, two amazing series that I cannot wait for the next title!"
