Weird, right? I would never have thought KISS would have recorded a Bryan Adams song. KISS said they liked his track \"Rock And Roll Hell\" and wanted to do a cover of it for the record. When Bryan was in the studio with them, Gene had an unfinished riff that Bryan took back to Canada and that ended up becoming \"War Machine\".",

When Bryan was in the studio with them, Gene had an unfinished riff that Bryan took back to Canada and that ended up becoming “War Machine”.\n\nBryan said he had a live concert in mind when he wrote the song. Since he had never seen the band play live, he was happy to hear they were still playing it in concert 40 years later.\n\nAnd that’s not all. For Adam’s next album, 1983′s epic “Cuts Like A Knife”, Eric Carr went in and offered up a riff for Bryan which ended up as “Don’t Leave Me Lonely”. I hadn’t heard that song until I was writing this blog and to be honest, it kinda sounds like Bryan Adams doing a KISS song. Check it out below if you don’t already know it.\n\nHere’s a very old, very low definition, video of the song live from ‘84. I can’t hear Bryan in this song anywhere, but maybe that’s the point.\n\nCox Media Group"
