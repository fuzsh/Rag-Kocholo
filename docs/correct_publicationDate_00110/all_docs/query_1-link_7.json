        "text": "“What is especially notable about this work is the combination of sophisticated social theorizing with intrepid ethnographic fieldwork in a very dangerous world. Hoffman’s book is one of the best examples of this new anthropological genre of studying war and violence with fieldwork methods that generate data about the lived experience of violence. Such methods and data help dislodge common assumptions about this violence – wild youth on a rampage, primordial ethnic hatred, et cetera.” — William P. Murphey, African Affairs\n\n“[A] path-breaking ethnography that offers a completely novel analytical framework for the anthropology of war in general, and for the interconnected wars in the West African Mano River Basin region in particular.” — Sverker Finnström, African Studies Quarterly\n\n“Hoffman avoids the common language of chaos and failed states, noting that though it is hard to idealize militia life, in this context it may be seen as asocial movement prepared to defend itself against external predations. Highly recommended.” — O. Pi-Sunyer, Choice\n\n“Hoffman’s book is at once a tightly-wound first person account of life amongst Sierra Leone’s ‘lumpen proletariat’ and an impressive work of economic and cultural theory. It is this unusual lens that makes The War Machines so thought-provoking, even for those intimately familiar with the Mano River War, and Hoffman provides enough background and context that it is still a powerful read for the uninitiated. “ — D. Tsomondo, cool'eh\n\n“It is to Hoffman’s great credit as a scholar and author that his writing… is equally compelling, deftly articulating political philosophical concepts (no small feat with the repertoire he has selected) and evocatively rendering dynamic social environments…. Hoffman succeeds in making the political, economic and social connections he sets out to make. The War Machines provides a welcome addition to the modest Mano River canon, and a valuable entry point for academic visitors in and voyageurs out.” — Zoe Marks, Journal of Modern African Studies\n\n“It’s clear from the onset that the questions pursued are quite original and nontraditional for an anthropological reading of young West African combatants….widely accessable to those without a specific interest in an anthropological study of Africa.” — Sammy Badran, Theory & Event\n\n“The ethnographic narrative, as well as the crafted images throughout the text, conveys a rich and nuanced portrayal of the lives of Hoffman’s subjects and their context, which avoids at all times violence aestheticizing or full denial of individual’s agency…. This book is a must read for any serious scholar interested in the study of globalisation, post-colonialism, or visual research methodology.” — Yolanda C. Martin, Visual Studies\n\n“This is a novel departure from most previous studies of youth and violence in Africa, and as such it is a necessary and provocative addition to the literature.… [A] wealth of material he brings to bear on our understanding of youth violence.” — Catherine Bolten, Anthropos"
