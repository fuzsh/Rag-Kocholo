        "text": "Netflix has nabbed distribution rights to Brad Pitt‘s “War Machine.”\n\nThe satirical comedy, directed by David Michôd (“Animal Kingdom”) and based on Michael Hastings’ bestselling book “The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan,” marks the biggest film acquisition to date for the streaming service.\n\nMichôd also wrote the film, which will be produced by Pitt and his Plan B partners Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, along with Ian Bryce (“World War Z”).\n\n“We are so excited to be a part of the inspiring commitment by Netflix to produce cutting-edge content and to deliver it to a global audience,” Pitt said in a press release.\n\n“I’m humbled to be making a big, bold movie about the whole sprawling, complex, cumbersome and crazy machinery of modern war and the many lives it touches,” Michôd added.\n\n“War Machine” follows Pitt, a four-star U.S. military general, patterned after Gen. Stanley McChrystal, determined to win the “impossible” war in Afghanistan.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n“War Machine is a rip-roaring, behind-the-facade tale of modern war decision-makers, from the corridors of power to the distant regions of America’s ambitions,“ Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said. “Brad and David are a perfect team to make this timely, compelling and entertaining film.”\n\nThe Netflix original film will be available in theaters and to Netflix subscribers in 2016.\n\nNetflix made its first big splash at the Cannes Film Festival last month by acquiring worldwide distribution rights to the upcoming Kevin James comedy “The True Memoirs of an International Assassin.”\n\nThe streaming site continues to build its reputation in the realm of distributing new movies. In addition to signing a four-movie deal with Adam Sandler in 2014, Netflix landed worldwide rights to Cary Fukunaga’s “Beasts of No Nation” ($12 million) and the Jamie Dornan-starrer “Jadotville” ($17 million) earlier this year."
