        "text": "Early life and journalism career\n\nMcBride was the eighth child of an interracial and interfaith couple. His mother, Ruth McBride (née Ruchel Zylska, later spelled Rachel Shilsky), was white and a Jewish immigrant from Poland. His father, Andrew McBride, was an African American Baptist pastor. McBride’s father died while Ruth McBride was pregnant with James. She later remarried, to a part Black and part Native American man named Hunter Jordan, and they had four children together while raising the eight children from Ruth’s first marriage.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\n12 Contemporary Black Authors You Must Read: James McBride\n\nMcBride and his siblings mainly grew up in public housing in Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood. On the experience of growing up in public housing, McBride told National Public Radio in 2020, “It was the sense of being in a village, and a sense of us against the world.” He also described his childhood as poor and said that his mother was too busy worrying about “the next meal, the next pair of shoes” to be concerned about the social taboo of being a white mother with 12 Black children. The family was musical; they had a piano in the home, and McBride and his siblings played music together. McBride also played the saxophone from a young age.\n\nIn high school McBride often skipped class, until he was compelled to change his ways during his sophomore year. He credits the intervention of his school’s guidance counselor, who told McBride that continuing down the path he was on “would be such a waste of talent.” Also during McBride’s high-school years, his stepfather died, and his family moved from New York City to Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nAfter graduating from P.S. du Pont High School in Wilmington, McBride attended Oberlin College in Ohio, where he majored in communications and also studied jazz and composition at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. It was there that he was introduced to writing. For a class he wrote a story about a man who went to the bathroom, had a heart attack, and died. McBride has publicly joked that it was a horrible story, but his professor at the time told him that he had a talent for the craft of writing. McBride received a master’s degree in journalism from Columbia University, New York, in 1980 and went on to work as a journalist for several years, beginning with the News Journal in Wilmington. Later he served as a reporter or staff writer with The Boston Globe, People, Rolling Stone, and The Washington Post. During his time with People, McBride covered Michael Jackson on tour following the release of Jackson’s mega-selling album Thriller (1982).\n\nLiterary career\n\nMcBride published his first book, The Color of Water: A Black Man’s Tribute to His White Mother, in 1996, a memoir of his upbringing and his mother’s childhood as a European immigrant who was raised in the American South by a domineering father in an Orthodox Jewish household. The book sold more than two million copies and spent more than two years on The New York Times’s bestseller list. The title of the book comes from Ruth McBride Jordan’s answer to her son’s childhood question, “What color is God?” She answered him, “God is the color of water.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The acclaimed book was adapted into a film, directed by Spike Lee, in 2008. McBride wrote the film adaptation’s screenplay.\n\nIn 2013 McBride published the novel The Good Lord Bird, a fictionalization of the American abolitionist John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry in what is now West Virginia. The story is told from the perspective of Henry Shackleford, a young enslaved man who flees his enslaver to travel with Brown’s group but disguised as a woman. Praised by critics for its absorbing storytelling, the book won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2013 and was made into a television miniseries, starring Ethan Hawke as Brown, in 2020.\n\nMcBride’s novel The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store (2023) also received great critical acclaim. Barnes & Noble named the novel its 2023 Book of the Year, and McBride won the 2023 Kirkus Prize for Fiction. Set mostly in the 1920s and ’30s in the Chicken Hill neighborhood of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, an area populated primarily by Jewish immigrants and African Americans, the novel contains a murder mystery at its heart. Music plays an essential part in its storyline, as two of the Jewish characters, Moshe and Chona Ludlow, operate one of the region’s first integrated dance halls, showcasing Black talent.\n\nOther works by McBride include Song Yet Sung (2008), a novel about slavery that mixes history with fiction; the nonfiction book Kill ’Em and Leave: Searching for James Brown and the American Soul (2016), about the legacy of the great soul singer; the short-story collection Five-Carat Soul (2017); and the best-selling novel and Oprah’s Book Club pick Deacon King Kong (2020), which is set in New York City in 1969.\n\nIn 2015 U.S. Pres. Barack Obama awarded McBride the National Humanities Medal for his literary contributions toward “humanizing the complexities of discussing race in America.”\n\nMusic and screenwriting career\n\nAfter leaving his career in journalism, McBride began working professionally as a musician, playing tenor sax for jazz artist Jimmy Scott. It was while on tour with Scott that McBride wrote The Color of Water, and he has described the book as having been written “in hotel rooms, vans, airports, libraries and on buses.” McBride also wrote music for soul and rhythm-and-blues singer Anita Baker, jazz-funk saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr., and the popular children’s television show Barney & Friends (1992–2010), starring Barney the purple dinosaur. (McBride has stated that he did not write Barney’s theme song “I Love You” but that he wishes he had.) Other notable music projects include the jazz and hip-hop musical Bobos (1993), for which McBride won the Stephen Sondheim Award, and the jazz album The Process–Volume One (2003).\n\nIn addition, McBride has written original scripts for film, notably cowriting (with Spike Lee) the screenplay for Red Hook Summer (2012), which Lee directed and which was partially based on McBride’s childhood in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The film is about a young boy from Atlanta who is sent to New York to spend the summer with his grandfather, a preacher living in the Red Hook Houses."
