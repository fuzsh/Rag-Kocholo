        "text": "The team just knocked another one out of the park!\n\nFantastic!\n\nOkay, I'm getting to the point where I'm not really sure what there is left to say. Obviously, I am a huge fan of this writing duo and there is not really anything that they have written that I have not thought was excellent. This series is no different.\n\nThis book is continuing the overarching story arc following the terrorist Qasim Nadar. We make some enormous strides in his storyline and his part in the story reaches its climax. At this point, we are in the third book in the series and by this point, we have gotten to really understand the dynamics of this team. That makes it even harder when one of the members finds herself in dire circumstances.\n\nThere is a lot that happens in this book and in their magnificent way, the team somehow keeps the tension high throughout the entire book. It feels like the suspense just grows and grows as events begin unfolding and it gets to a point where it is down to the wire.\n\nAs usual, I listened to most of this on audio (In fact, it was a pre-order from Audible) and Ray Porter did his usual amazing job as a narrator. Man, I love anything that Mr. Porter narrates, and I am so glad that he has chosen to narrate this series. I know he signed on with this writing duo several books ago but I am still thrilled each and every time I see his name attached.\n\nI can't wait for whatever is next to come - I am definitely invested.\n\nSo So So GOOD!\n\nI’ve been waiting for this book to be released for nearly a year. It carry’s all the action, suspense and humor that you expect if you’ve read the other books in this series or the Tier 1 series. It was so good, in fact, that my wife was pissed off at me since I wore my earbuds all day because I just couldn’t stop listening. I would give this book 10 stars if I could. I sincerely hope there is more to follow!\n\nI’m so mad…..\n\nI waited months for this to come out and then I listened to the whole thing in a day and a half….I wish books 4 - 6 were already available. In all seriousness I really hope there will be more of this series to come. For now I will start back at the beginning and listen to all of the Chunk/ Dempsey books again.\n\nGreat addition to the series.\n\nWhile waiting for this to be released, I had to go back through the entire collection. Starting with Tier One through this installment. While I enjoy the entire universe, this was one of my favorites. I don’t think will be the last of the series, and I am sooo looking forward to the combination of the JD and Chunk universes in a book now that these characters are so well developed."
