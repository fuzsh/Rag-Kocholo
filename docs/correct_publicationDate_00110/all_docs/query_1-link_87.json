        "text": "This page used to be a part of the Tale of Diep namespace. It is now considered fanon.\n\nThe War Machine is a multi-piece death machine designed for the purpose destroying its combatants and study their methods. Tanks shiver when the name War Machine is whispered or even mentioned.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe War Machine is a complex boss that spawns in [UNKNOWN LOCATION]. It is made up of five large units and one core. The units rotate around the core, attacking players that dare approach it. It has a massive arsenal, [FURTHER INFORMATION CURRENTLY OBFUSCATED] and is intended to be fought by most, if not all players currently in the server.\n\nThe Components[]\n\nIt is made of six separate parts, each with their own individual health pool, but the entire machine shares one Health Bar at the top of the screen. When a piece runs out of health, it blows up, dealing damage to players near it. After that, all of the pieces will re-structure themselves to be evenly spaced apart. The Core is impervious to damage before the five rotating segments are destroyed. The six components are:\n\nThe Core: The massive center that the other parts are attached to. It can also fire twin lasers that target separately from the yellow lasers on its center. These lasers will slowly increase in damage over time, but can be reset by dealing enough damage to The Core. Is completely Invulnerable until the five segments mentioned below are destroyed.\n\nThe Gatling: A tank attached to the Core with four thin barrels that aim at players. It shoots a RAPID, like almost stacked, stream of bullets at those who approach it. They don't do much damage and are comparable to the size of Gunner bullets.\n\nThe Spire: An Overseer-like turret that pumps out Drones that orbit the War Machine like a shield, or attack players. These drones are red and metal plated like the Machine itself. The summoning speed is about 120% of a normal Overseer. These deal moderate damage.\n\nThe Chainspike: A sharp hook that splits into three hooks seconds before making contact with the player its after. The two other chains go out in the respective diagonal directions next to the point, hitting more players. If a player is latched, they will be pulled in a bit, before being fired out.\n\nThe Seeker: A Triple Shot that shoots red missile shapes that will chase after players. They have a red circle 2x the size of a tank around their center. If a player enters it, the missile will stop homing, and start traveling straight forward. These missiles on contact with a player or object deal heavy area damage.\n\nThe Slayer: At first it looks innocent and small, like a sword, but then it extends and four barrels stick out of it! They fire incredibly fast bullets in sync, creating a wall of shots for those in its path to dodge. These bullets don't do a lot of damage on contact.\n\nBackground Music[]\n\nFeaturing song from the album Polygonal Retribution by Zander GComet.\n\nTrivia[]"
