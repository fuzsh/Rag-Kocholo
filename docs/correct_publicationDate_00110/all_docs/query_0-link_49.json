In this world, there are no police and the government uses elite bounty hunters to do the police work. Sam McCade is one of the best, if not the best. McCade is on the chase of a traitorous navy captain. McCade is the only one who can stop him and if he doesn’t, an alien threat is promising the destruction of the Terran Empire.\n\nThe first book in The Legion of the Damned series is Andromeda’s Fall. This book is set years in the future when space travel, advanced medicine and technology are the norm. The more our world changes, the more it stays the same. Cat is a lady of power who lives only for joy. The next party is her main worry until her brother is murdered by an Empress. She soon finds herself among the society’s misfits, the Legion, and suddenly she has something besides the next part to think of: revenge on Empress Ophelia for what she did to her brother."
