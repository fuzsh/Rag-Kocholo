Han Solo takes his wife, Leia Organo Solo, Chewbacca, and his three children to visit his home world of Corellia.

As the evidence mounts that australopithicines are alive in the present day, a question that no one ever thought to ask before suddenly become more more urgent -- what, exactly, is a human being. {Baen Books, paperback, 1988, FoxAcre Press 2002.}\n\nFARSIDE CANNON\n\nScientists working in the high arctic wastes of Iceland discover proof that an asteroid strike killed the dinosaurs. But their evidence is less than welcome to the people planning to move the asteroid Cornucopia into Earth orbit. There seems to be only one way to stop the asteroid -- and the only place to do it from is the lunar Farside. {Baen Books, paperback, 1989}. This book takes place in the same universe as the Hunted Earth series, about a hundred years prior to THE RING OF CHARON.\n\nTHE RING OF CHARON\n\nThe first book of the Hunted Earth. An incredibly powerful group of aliens, the Charonians, steal the planet Earth, removing it completely from the Solar System. {Tor Books, paperback December 1990}\n\nTHE SHATTERED SPHERE\n\nThe Second book of the Hunted Earth.

But Sheriff Alvar Kresh soon learns, much to his horror, that, all of a sudden, such a thing is possible -- because the scientist who was attacked had made some changes in the Three Laws. {Ace Books, trade paperback, 1993}\n\nISAAC ASIMOV'S INFERNO\n\nA political assassination throws the planet Inferno into chaos just as draconian measures to rescue the planetary climate are going into effect.

See above for details.\n\nTHE MODULAR MAN\n\nIn a world where the line between man and machine has become increasingly blurred, a robotic household maintenance unit is arrested for murder, and the dead man's widow decides to defend the machine herself. For the case is not just about murder. The prosecution wants the court to rule that no machine can stand trial, because no machine has rights under the law. Except there are very good reasons to argue this one does -- because the prosecution beleives the dead man is very much alive, his mind stored inside the robot. In effect, the victim has been arrested for murdering himself. {Bantam Books, paperback, 1992}.\n\nSUPERNOVA\n\n(with Eric Kotani)\n\nAs the twentieth century draws to its close, a young scientist discovers evidence that Sirius B, one of the closest stars to Earth, is about to undergo a Supernova explosion. Indeed, it may have already exploded, with the explosion shock wave already on its way to Earth. At first, it seems just a scientific curiosity, but even from a distance of many light years, a supernova explosion can have strange -- and disastrous -- consequences.\n\nTHE WAR MACHINE\n\n(with David Drake)\n\nThe Pact, the despotic and corrupt system that has held all the worlds and star sytems together for so long, is finally starting to unravel. But as bad as it is, the chaos and upheaval that will come in the wake of the Pact's collapse can only be worse. A young officer, his marriage wrecked for the momentary advantage of one political faction over another, is forced to do battle against a unseen enemy in the name of the Pact. {Baen Books, paperback, 1989.}\n\nClick Here to return to Roger MacBride Allen's home page\n\nLast Updated: Februrary 28, 2002"
