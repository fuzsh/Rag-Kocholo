Dietz was born and raised in Seattle, USA. He spent some time serving in the Navy and Marine Corps. Dietz attended Washington University and worked as a college tutor, surgical technician, and a news writer. Later, he worked for US West in various distinctive advertising and marketing related positions, previously leaving to start a new job as Director of Public Relations and Marketing for a global phone organization, edge2net. Dietz has been a full-time author since 2002. Among the works from Dietz is the novel adaptation of a computer game known as Halo: the book titled The Flood and was released in 2003. William Dietz and his wife Marjorie live close to the city of Gig Harbor in Washington State.\n\nWilliam C. Dietz\n\nThe Legion\n\nSet in a dim, dreary and immoral future when people have spread in millions across the world, the story talks about the adventures of the Legion, the future appearance of the French Foreign Legion. Like their verifiable namesake, the Legion is comprised of a mixed gathering of social oddities’ and troublemakers who relish fighting in wars and engaging in endless conflicts on the edges of Imperial Earth’s region.\n\nNevertheless, training for the Legion has changed after some time. Denounced crooks and those with terminal diseases may join the Legion after death (consequently the book’s title). This applies instantly following their execution or death; volunteers have their brains moved into cyborg fight suits that are portable, spry, and antagonistic and super clusters of the deadly. They then go through a thorough, second dangerous rigorous system of which less than half survive.\n\nWhen recruited, prepared and given the title of Legionnaire, they turn out to be the most dreaded creatures in the Empire. The Legion makes up three fundamental parts. There are Quads, the four-legged cyborg tanks, and vigorously reinforced vehicles. The Quads are bolstered by a more substantial number of Cyborg ground fighters called Troopers and a substantially more significant number of “typical” human Legionnaires alluded to as Bio-Bods.\n\nThe Legion is exceptionally portrayed and tied into the historical backdrop of the French Foreign Legions through stories of their most remarkable undertakings; utilized as both showing instruments and spirit-boosting lessons. Legionnaires must be instilled with a wild feeling of steadfastness and spirit corps that makes them outstanding untouchables of the world.\n\nWe also read about the flippant, fierce “Nero-fiddling, burning Rome of an Empire known as the Hudathans. The Hudathans are chauvinistic and view any intelligent species as a risk to their reality. Humans being aware, they need to go, and the outsiders have started obliterating nearby terrestrial groups after closing the solar system while the Emperor and the voices in his mind have been debating how to react.\n\nIntricate read but extremely enjoyable. In addition, the idea of the Legion and how their winnowed position forms the overall public is marvelous. I loved the idea of rebels and social savages reawakening and given a possibility of reclamation while working through the guilt and anxiety of their previous lives. We get the chance to follow the humans in their final moments of turning into lethal trained Legionnaires. It makes for superb heroes. Readers get to follow, several recruits, from their last minutes as human-beings, as they are converted into combat-tested, Legionnaires. This in turn, makes for superb three-dimensional characters.\n\nHalo: The Flood\n\nThe Human-Covenant War, a frantic battle for humanity’s survival, has achieved its breaking point on the secretive, sphere world called Halo. In any case, the savage Covenant warriors, the most stringent outsider military power known, are by all account not the only risk that lies in the holdup. Halo Combat is an adaptation of a video game. The Master Chief and Cortana, and his A.I. partner wander crosswise over Halo to finish a reiteration of missions and goals. These scenes came straight from the game, Halo Combat Evolved, and some parts had to change to accommodate the book narrative.\n\nThe chief circumstance, where the story broke was the point at which is interlaced with the opposite side stories told in the book, and not featured in the game. Likewise, I saw that a considerable lot of the lines from the diversion with little adjustments in the texts. The progressions were too minor and did not influence the story. There was a new discourse between the Master Chief and Cortana, which fleshed out our heroes in a way, did not fulfill sufficiently. In spite of the fact that this was the principle story in the book, I observed it is somewhat dry on occasion, mainly as it concerned the combat groupings. There are just such vast numbers of ways one can depict a firearms fight or the slaughtering of an enemy. The lengths taken to describe these scenes dragged on too far and made the story quite long, in my opinion.\n\nIn another scene, a gathering of surviving ODST officers later surrenders the Pillar of Autumn. The more significant part of their story occurred on an improvised base called Alpha Base and involved a shallow tale of the narrative. They take their break from the Covenant ahead of time in light of holding the position down for their chance and finish one mission to their ship near the end. They don’t do much, and at whatever point something significant occurs with them. It turns into a long, excessively drawn out, ineffectively written description that goes on and on endlessly you’d be bored to tears if you read the entire book word for word. Skim through the boring parts…\n\nThe last and most exciting part was an elite commando named Zuka ‘Zamamee and his Grunt buddy Yayap. ‘Zamamee is almost murdered by the Master Chief and is rescued by Yayap. Given new life, ‘Zamamee is tasked with finding his aggressor and kill him. As you could presumably figure, this arrangement does not go too well for him. Notwithstanding this story does not excite as much as the first edition. It was fascinating to peruse due to the understanding gave into the progression and operations of the Treaty. These parts were shallow in describing the story, though the book is rich with imagination and thrilling where humans engage in battle with their enemies in outer space.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » William C.
