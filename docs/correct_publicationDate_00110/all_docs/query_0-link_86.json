Known for creating science fiction and fantasy series, including his well-known \"Hammer's Slammers\" and \"Lord of the Isles,\" Drake is considered by many critics to be a master of epic, military science fiction.\n\nIn Drake's Lord of the Isles, the author \"uses his experience writing military and historical sf to craft an intricate first book in a new epic fantasy series,\" commented Susan Hamburger in Library Journal. Booklist reviewer Roland Green, commenting that Drake is suited to the saga form, found the cast \"large and well drawn, the pacing brisk, the world building outstanding.\" A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly faulted the book for resolving unsatisfactorily, but praised Drake's use of magic as more complex than typical fantasy novels: \"His settings and magical creatures provide surprise and drama as well as plenty of color.\" The reviewer also noted: \"This substantial fantasy, in which moral and physical threats are serious and the actions of the characters have real consequences, will appeal to those tired of watered-down myth.\"\n\nDrake's other works have received similar critical reception. Drake's 1998 novel With the Lightnings was called an \"intelligent page-turner\" by Roland Green in Booklist. Green commented: \"Drake seldom falls down in his pacing or fails to deliver ingenious hardware and gripping action scenes.\" Jackie Cassada in Library Journal wrote: \"[With the Lightnings] once again demonstrates the author's talent for arcane politics and vivid battle scenes.\"\n\nDrake's sequel to Lord of the Isles, Queen of Demons, was faulted by some critics for involving too many subplots. Many critics, however, lauded other aspects of the work. A Publishers Weekly contributor claimed: \"Drake conjures a sense of enchantment—and danger—with original and convincing settings, situations and characters. Moreover, unlike too many fantasy characters, these protagonists mature through their adventures.\" \"Imaginative world-building and attention to magical details makes this a good choice for most fantasy collections,\" argued Jackie Cassada in Library Journal.\n\nIn 1999, Drake published Destiny's Shield, the third novel in a series co-written with Eric Flint. \"Drake's consummate skill as a creator of military sf and Flint's historical expertise come together in a historical fantasy with sf overtones,\" noted Cassada in Library Journal. Though a Publishers Weekly contributor found the resolution to the novel \"superficial,\" the reviewer nonetheless praised the \"battle scenes and strategies\" as \"expert as expected in a book with Drake's name on it.\"\n\nIn the third book in the \"Lord of the Isles\" series, Servant of the Dragon, the four primary characters each have a quest that leads them to battle sorcery. Roland Green, writing in Booklist, noted that the book includes \"Dalar the pirate, one of the saga's more engaging and original characters.\" The next book in the series, Mistress of the Catacombs, was called a \"worthwhile continuation of what is emerging as the author's most important work\" by a Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nGoddess of the Ice Realm, continues the \"Lord of the Isles\" series and features King Garric's adviser, the sorceress Tenoctris and an effort to unite the Kingdom of the Isles. Green, once again writing in Booklist, noted that the volume includes a \"climax in which everyone is swept toward a grand, ultimately compellingly powerful, resolution.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor commented that the novel is \"written in an accessible style.\" In Master of the Cauldron, one of the primary characters, King Garric, is now lord of all the isles but soon faces someone who wishes to dethrone him. Booklist contributor Green noted the novel's battle sequences and wrote that the author \"draws [them] with great, gritty realism on both material and magical planes.\"\n\nFortress of Glass is a part of the \"Lord of the Isles\" series but also the first in a trilogy, as the author noted on his Web site, \"whose individual pieces will read far better in order as a whole.\" Writing in the Library Journal, Jackie Cassada noted the author's \"inventive approach to magic and his solidly built characters.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor commented that Drake \"makes the most of his setting based on the classical Mediterranean world.\"\n\nFortune's Stroke is the fourth novel in the alternate-history series cowritten with Eric Flint and features two beings from the future traveling back to the sixth century to alter the future. The storyline features the future beings inhabiting human hosts to influence both the Malwa and Byzantine Empires. A Publishers Weekly contributor noted that readers \"should sit back and chortle while admiring the authors' alternate-technological ingenuity.\" Roland Green, once again writing in Booklist, commented: \"If one accepts the series' fantastic premises, enjoyment is ensured.\" In the Tide of Victory, the Malway empire is facing war conducted by the Romans, Ethiopians, and Persians, with the war leading to a rebellion by the Malwa people. Green called the book \"a feast for any military sf reader with a sense of humor.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor commented: \"Overall, though, the fascination of seeing familiar tactics applied in unfamiliar situations makes this novel a winner.\"\n\nDrake tells the story of Royal Cinnabar Navy Lieutenant Daniel Leary and his involvement in a political predicament on another planet in Lt. Leary, Commanding, which is the sequel to With the Lightnings, Along with his \"cybernetician\" partner Adele Mundy, Drake helps a local princess fight off factions wishing to overthrow her family. Booklist contributor Roland Green commented that the author's \"sense of humor infuses the characters here with agreeable qualities.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor noted \"the wonderfully strong quality of the follow-up.\" The Far Side of the Stars also features Leary and his partner Mundy, who this time are on the search for the last known map of Old Earth. Booklist contributor Roland Green noted: \"Readers who have been entranced by the previous adventures … will sigh with relief to see them again.\" Some Golden Harbor also features Leary and was called a \"rousing old-fashioned space opera\" by a Publishers Weekly reviewer.\n\nDrake also collaborated with Eric Flint on The Tyrant, a sequel to The Reformer which Drake wrote with Steve Stirling. The novel revolves around the fall of the Roman Republic. Writing in Booklist, Roland Green commented that even readers unfamiliar with the previous book \"will eventually join the historically versed in sitting back and enjoying.\"\n\nPaying the Piper is another entry in the \"Hammer's Slammers\" series and includes three novellas, each of which feature the adventures of Lt. Arnie Huber. Booklist contributor Green noted that \"the action scenes … are … vivid and compelling.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAnalog Science Fiction-Science Fact, December, 1983, Tom Easton, review of Skyripper, p. 163; October, 1984, Tom Easton, review of The Forlorn Hope, p. 148; March, 1985, Tom Easton, review of Birds of Prey, p. 146; June, 1985, Tom Easton, review of Killer, p. 162; November, 1986, Tom Easton, review of Ranks of Bronze, p. 177; May 15, 2001, Roland Green, review of The Tide of Victory, p. 1738; February 1, 2006, Roland Green, review of The Fortress of Glass, p. 37.\n\nBooklist, August, 1996, Roland Green, review of Redliners, p. 1888; August, 1997, Roland Green, review of Lord of the Isles, p. 1886; May 15, 1998, Roland Green, review of With the Lightnings, p. 1600; July, 1998, Roland Green, review of Caught in the Crossfire, p. 1867; August, 1998, Roland Green, review of Queen of the Demons, p. 1978; September 15, 1999, Roland Green, review of Servant of the Dragons p. 239; May 15, 2000, Roland Green, review of Fortune's Stroke, p. 1734; July, 2000, Roland Green, review of Lt.
