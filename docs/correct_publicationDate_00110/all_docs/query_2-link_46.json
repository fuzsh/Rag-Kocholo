        "text": "Reacher star Alan Ritchson is set to star in a sci-fi action film titled War Machine, which will be written and directed by Patrick Hughes (The Hitman’s Bodyguard). The project was developed by Lionsgate, but the film will be coming to Netflix. Hughes wrote the script with James Beaufort (Machine).\n\nIn the story, “In the final 24 Hours of the world’s toughest selection process, a team of Army Rangers encounter a threat beyond their imagination.”\n\nThere are no other details than that, but it will be interesting to see how the film comes together. I’m sure that this will be another good project fro Ritchson.\n\nRitchson will next be seen opposite Henry Cavill in Guy Ritchie’s World War II film, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Ritchson is also set to reprise his role as Aimes in the untitled 11th installment of the Fast and Furious franchise from Universal Pictures. He’s currently in production on Reacheer Season 3."
