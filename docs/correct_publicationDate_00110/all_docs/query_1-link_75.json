        "text": "A war machine is a construct of terrible power built from various metals, and granted the powers of another creature. Designed to resemble a living creature, a war machine’s body is a complicated construction of layered metals that give it the shape the desired creature would normally have. Magic grants the war machine the powers of the creature it was built to resemble.\n\nA war machine follows the commands of its creator much as a golem does. Although unintelligent, it has an instinctual understanding of its abilities and of combat. A war machine is capable of limited strategy when carrying out its creator’s instructions and it can follow any simple command that the creator can give in a few sentences.\n\nCreating a War Machine\n\nâWar machineâ is an inherited template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature except those with the ooze type (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A war machine uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.\n\nChallenge Rating: Same as the base creature +3.\n\nAlignment: Always neutral.\n\nType: The creature’s type changes to construct and loses all racial subtypes.\n\nArmor Class: Natural armor class increases by +5.\n\nHit Dice: Change all of the base creature’s racial HD to d10s. The creature gains bonus hit points as a construct of its size category, but loses hit points from Constitution.\n\nDefensive Abilities: The base creature gains all of the defensive abilities granted by the construct type. Additionally, it gains DR 10/â, acid, cold and fire resistance 10, and immunity to electricity. If the base creature has better resistances or immunities, it keeps those.\n\nWeaknesses: The base creature gains the following weakness:\n\nSpeed: Each of the war machine’s speeds is double the corresponding speed of the base creature and gains the following.\n\nAttacks: Each of a war machine’s natural attacks deals damage as though the war machine was two size categories larger than it is. Furthermore, the war machine can wield weapons up to two size categories larger than the base creature could without taking penalties.\n\nSpecial Attacks: A war machine gains the following.\n\nAbilities: Str +6, Dex +6, Wis +4, Cha â4 (minimum 1). As an unintelligent construct, a war machine has no Constitution or Intelligence score.\n\nSkills: Ignore the base creature’s skill modifiers, since a war machine has no skill points. However, it retains any racial bonuses that the base creature has. In addition, a war machine gains a +10 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Perception checks.\n\nFeats: A war machine retains the base creature’s bonus feats, but loses all others.\n\nSpecial Qualities: A war machine gains the mindless universal monster ability, as well as the following.\n\nEnvironment: Change to any.\n\nOrganization: Change to solitary, pair, or squad (3-6)\n\nTreasure: none\n\nWar Machine Construction\n\nWar machines are created in the same manner as golems. Because a war machine is composed of various metals, it weighs three times what the base creature does.\n\nCONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS\n\nPrice 2,400 gp Ã twice the war machine’s CR; Feats Craft Construct; Spells geas/quest, greater polymorph, limited wish, resist energy"
