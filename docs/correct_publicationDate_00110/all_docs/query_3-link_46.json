She's been writing fantasy for a long time, and it's good to see her latest work looks as fresh as her first. \"Jerlayne's mother had warned her not to marry the handsome elf, but Jerlayne refused to listen. Now a century after the wedding, Jerlayne's marriage is in shambles and none of their children have matured into elves like their parents. Jerlayne wants answers--she wants to know why her mother was so opposed to her marriage, and in finding those answers, these two elven women will confront an issue that will rock both realms down to their very foundation.\" [Dark Sun] The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King\n\nLynn Abbey\n\nTSR paperback\n\nThis is volume three in the Chronicles of Athas. [Dark Sun] Cinnabar Shadows\n\nLynn Abbey\n\nTSR paperback\n\nThis is volume 4 in the Chronicles of Athas.

Released simultaneously with the second volume (below) and -- like all good action serials -- followed by the concluding chapter in thirty days. From the author of two previous Star Trek: Deep Space Nine books, Fallen Heroes and Vengeance, as well as the novelizations of the computer game Doom, including Hell on Earth and Knee-Deep in the Dead. \"When Captain Sisko leads the \"Defiant\" on a dangerous mission into the Gamma Quadrant to liberate a conquered world, the Bajoran government insists that Kai Winn, the Federation's long-time nemesis, assume complete control of the space station.\" Rebels, Book Two (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Book 25)\n\nDaffyd ab Hugh\n\nPocket (paperback, 235 pages, $6.50 US/$8.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: February 9, 1999\n\nMiddle volume of the trilogy. The concluding volume will be available on March 9th. Daffyd ab Hugh is also the author of Balance of Power (Star Trek: The Next Generation, No 33) and The Final Fury (Star Trek: Voyager: Invasion, Book 4). He's certainly been around the Federation a few times. \"Kai Winn has never divulged what she personally did during the harsh and perilous days of the Occupation. But now, as Cardassian warships fight to reclaim Deep Space Nine, she cannot help recalling those bygone days -- and her own private war against the Cardassian oppressors.\" Chris Achilleos: Angels and Amazons\n\nChris Achilleos\n\nFPG (art, hardcover and trade paperback)\n\nA brand new collection of art from British artist Achilleos, the man who has done so much for the chain mail bikini. To quote another, \"I think they'd heal if you stopped wearing the chain mail bikini.\"\n\nAckermanthology: 60 Little Known Sci-Fi Short Stories\n\nedited by Forrest J. Ackerman\n\nGeneral Publishing Group trade paper\n\nIt's been a while since we've had a new anthology from Forrie -- the last one we can recall is Gosh! Wow! (Sense of Wonder) nearly ten years ago. Before that, there were all those short-short pieces in the back of the English-language Perry Rhodan books. No one knows the field like Ackerman, and here he presents a collection of lost gems by Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and many others. Grab it.\n\nTales from Watership Down\n\nRichard Adams\n\nAvon paperback\n\nWatership Down is one of the great classics of fantasy literature, one of the few that can rank with Lord of the Rings and the works of C. S. Lewis. With this collection of stories Richard Adams returns to that world for the first time, offering both an assortment of self-contained tales and a mini-sequel to the epic story of Hazel, Fiver, and Bigwig. Most of the stories follow the mythical adventures of the legendary El-ahrairah, the rabbit hero whose quests in a bygone era gave rabbits the tools of survival, while a few others update the lives of the rabbits following General Woundwort's defeat at the end of Watership Down. The Cockatrice Boys\n\nJoan Aiken; illustrated by Jason Van Hollander\n\nTor trade paper\n\nAiken's books for young readers include Cold Shoulder Road and the extremely popular Wolves of Willoughby Chase. In The Cockatrice Boys she delivers an adult novel of classic Weird Fantasy. Without warning the world is invaded by a host of grotesque monsters, originating from somewhere in England. Before long civilization collapses, the countryside becomes a dangerous wasteland and cities become isolated fortresses as the ravenous and constantly multiplying creatures spread across the land. In desperation a heroic band calling itself the Cockatrice Corps forms to bring food for the starving people of Manchester, eventually taking on the dangerous task of locating the source of the monstrous invasion -- and somehow ending it. Cold Shoulder Road\n\nJoan Aiken\n\nDell Yearling paperback\n\nThe sequel to Is Underground, one of my favorite recent young-adult books. Having freed the children enslaved in the northern mines, Is Twite and her cousin Arun return to find Arun's mother has disappeared. In fact, there's plenty of strange goings-on now that the Channel Tunnel is open, and smugglers called the Merry Gentry have the whole countryside terrified. An American Bookseller Pick of the Lists.\n\nBarbara McClintock\n\nStranger at the Window\n\nVivien Alcock\n\nHoughton Mifflin (First US printing, hardcover, 200 pages, $16 US)\n\nPublication date: April, 1998\n\nVivien Alcock is one of our favorite Young Adult writers, and for good reason. Her fantasy novels, including The Haunting of Cassie Palmer and The Red-Eared Ghosts are original, suspenseful, and fun for all ages. Now she returns with a fine new volume of mystery and suspense. Eleven-year-old Lesley hasn't had much luck recently. Her mother accepted a new job in Cairo, but when Lesley contracted hepatitis she was left to recuperate in London with her widowed Aunt Amy. Soon Lesley is drawn into a strange mystery when she sees an odd child peering down at her from the attic of the house next door.

The main character is a young teenage girl who can see ghosts... who all have red ears. The characters are strongly written and the pace is swift... a truly well written and entertaining story.\" See for yourself why Vivien Alcock has rapidly become one of our favorites.\n\nArt: Barb McClintock\n\nThe Stonewalkers\n\nVivien Alcock\n\nHoughton Mifflin (reprint, trade paperback, 169 pages, $4.95 US)\n\nPublication date: March 1998 (First Printing: 1981)\n\nEveryone's so tired of listening to Poppy Brown's stories that she's started talking to statues. When her favorite garden statue is hit by lightning and begins to move, Poppy find herself in possession of the most unbelievable story of her life... and absolutely no one who will even listen to it. Still, her skeptical classmate Emma is at least curious enough to offer to help investigate -- especially when statues all over town begin to vanish, and some are spotted assembling deep in the moors. \"An absorbing tale of terror... an intrusion of nightmares into the mundane.\" -- Horn Book. The Haunting of Cassie Palmer\n\nVivien Alcock\n\nHoughton Mifflin/Sandpiper paperback\n\nBeing the seventh child of a seventh child doesn't just mean wearing hand-me-downs.

His five-volume series set in the enchanted world of Prydain was filmed by Disney as The Black Cauldron, and he is the winner of the Newbery Award for The High King. Dutton will be bringing his latest novel, Gypsy Rizka, out this April. In the meantime, Puffin is keeping many of his most popular YA novels in print, including the following four. \"As he did in Time Cat, Alexander brings a cast of feline characters to life with his trademark verse, making sure readers never take a cat for granted again!\"\n\nDan Craig\n\nThe Wizard in the Tree\n\nLloyd Alexander, illustrated by Laszlo Kubinyi\n\nPuffin (reprint, trade paperback, 138 pages, $4.50/$5.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: September, 1998 (First Edition: 1975)\n\nA light-hearted stand-alone fantasy, well illustrated by the talented Laszlo Kubinyi. \"Mallory notices there's something funny about an old oak tree, takes a closer look, and before she knows it, she's broken a magical spell.

But Hooks worsens Tooley's bad luck. It's up to Tooley's wise cat to get rid of Hooks - by summoning the dreaded House Gobbaleen!

He's one of the finest craftsmen in the field, and while the majority of his work is labeled Young Adult, virtually all of it is delightful to readers of all ages (a maxim that is true far less often than it is claimed). The author of The Iron Ring, The Arkadians, and the five-volume Prydain Chronicles (basis for the Disney movie The Black Cauldron), has written nearly 70 works of fantasy. \"While in the town square watching a magician, Lukas suddenly finds himself in a far-distant sea. When he comes ashore, the first people he meets hail him as king of Abadan, which would be fine with Lukas -- if only everyone wasn't trying to murder him.\" The Iron Ring\n\nLloyd Alexander\n\nPenguin/Dutton hard cover\n\nA major new release from one of the most beloved YA authors at work today. The five books in The Black Cauldron series are perhaps still his most famous, but he has contributed a remarkable body of work. If you've been looking for a fresh, lively tale that will re-invigorate your love of the genre, this is it. Set in mythic India, the book follows young King Tamar as, driven by his sense of \"dharma\" (honor), he sets off on a perilous journey with a greater significance than he realizes. On his quest he encounters talking animals, villainous and noble kings, demons -- and the love of his life.

From author of the Prydain Chronicles, The Westmark Trilogy, and the Vesper Holly adventures.\n\nBruce Jensen\n\nIsaac Asimov's Utopia (The Caliban Trilogy, Book 3)\n\nRoger MacBride Allen\n\nAce (reprint, paperback, 351 pages, $6.50/$8.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: March, 1999 (First Edition: November, 1996)\n\nRoger MacBride Allen built a rep on his own first -- with such novels as Ambush at Corella, The Modular Man, and The Ring of Charon -- but it was with The Caliban Trilogy, sanctioned by the late Isaac Asimov, that he first drew a major audience. The first two bestsellers, Caliban and Inferno, explored the first two of Asimov's famous Laws of Robotics, and this one tackles the last in a complex tale of Inferno -- a world where Spacers work with Settlers, where standard Three-Law robots work alongside the controversial New-Law robots... and a world that is dying. Note: although the copyright page claims this is an original work that has never before been printed, it is in fact a reprint of a 1996 edition.

The hunt for his ship, the Iron Fist, is underway as Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron unite, under Wedge's command, for the first time. In scenes reminiscent of the hunt for the Nazi battleship, \"Bismarck,\" Alliance forces gear up for an all-out assault on the Super Star Destroyer.\" From the author of Doc Sidhe. Star Wars: X-Wing: Iron Fist (X-Wing, Book 6)\n\nAaron Allston\n\nBantam Spectra (paperback, 310 pages, $5.99 US/$7.99 Canada)\n\nPublication date: July 13, 1998\n\nOne of the more popular Star Wars novel series, the X-Wing books chronicle the adventures of Wraith Squadron, the Rebel Alliance's ultimate strike force. This time they're given the nearly impossible task of stopping the warlord Zsinj and his Super Star destroyer -- before he decides to join the Empire, turning the tide of battle. From the author of X-Wing: Wraith Squadron (and designer of the computer game Ultima: The Savage Empire, and editor of one of the best gaming magazines of all time, the fondly-remembered The Space Gamer.) Trust us -- Allston knows action and adventure, in more than a few genres. Star Wars X-Wing: Wraith Squadron (X-Wing series, Volume 5)\n\nAaron Allston\n\nBantam Spectra paperback\n\nYou know this stuff is bad for you. You should be supporting some struggling new author instead of spending your hard-earned book dollars on a movie tie-in, right? But you peek at the first chapter anyway. Eight hours later you're hunched over in an armchair deep into chapter seventeen, surrounded by empty Dorito bags, and the distant buzzing is the upstairs alarm telling you it's time to get up and go to work. Told you these things were bad for you. Next time you should listen to us. From the author of Doc Sidhe and I, Tyrant. Meg\n\nSteve Alten\n\nDoubleday hard cover\n\nWe love monster books, and this looks like a whopper. Jonas Taylor was the sole survivor of a top-secret dive into the Pacific's deepest canyon, but for years he's been unable to prove that what he saw really exists: Carcharodon megalodon, the massive and prehistoric mother of the great white shark. He spends his time on a Ph.D. in paleontology, lecturing and writing about the possibility that Meg still feeds at the deepest levels of the ocean. But when he's lured back into the water by an old friend in need and a hotshot female submarine pilot, Taylor finds himself diving deeper than ever before and facing a terror worse than he'd ever imagined. \"Jurassic Shark\" indeed.\n\nBooks by Kevin J. Anderson Turn of the Century\n\nKurt Anderson\n\nRandom House (hardcover, 659 pages, $24.95 US)\n\nPublication date: May, 1999\n\nAnother millennial novel -- wait, don't run away screaming just yet. This one is just a tad more daring than most. It's the year 2000 in Manhattan, and ex-Newsweek and PBS writer George Mactier has maneuvered his way into a producer position at the sinister MBC network -- where his cop drama NARCS mixes actors, real police, and real drug busts. His wife Lizie is a rising software entrepreneur whose alternative-history computer game has revolutionary technology that can sense fear and adjust accordingly, guaranteeing an authentic thrill ride. When Lizzie stumbles into a Microsoft deal that soon goes awry, events sweep her and George into a bizarre plot involving billionaire media mogul Harold Mose, fin-de-siècle Hollywood, a grab for cyberspace, and the potential death of Bill Gates. \"An astonishing doorstop of a debut that deconstructs the 1990s by peering just over the border into the next decade.... the first most promising novelist of the Third Millennium\" -- Entertainment Weekly. Books by Poul Anderson Heart Song\n\nV.C. Andrews\n\nPocket\n\nNew novel from a woman who's been dead for some time. You have to admire that kind of dedication."
