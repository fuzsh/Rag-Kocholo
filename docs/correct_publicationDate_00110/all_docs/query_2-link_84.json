        "text": "Sounded pretty awesome until the whiny predictable vocals come in. I'm so tired of that sound now. It's such a blatant box tick to their songwriting, sucks the soul out of it for me. The other vocalist sounds good though, guessing it's Andrew? Can't they just use him lol\n\nActually listened and Andrew Wells sounds great on this ... why couldn't they just boot Tillian and stick with him or bring in another vocalist to freshen up the sound. Could have even brought back Kurt who sounds better than ever. I am so bored with this band.\n\n@Monotone no cap! I am not a true bears fans so there is no hard feelings seeing them lose, but I like Fields and wanna see him succeed.\n\nlevis should have an interesting day against the falcons defense. ridder will continue to show off his mastery of the art of the turnover. the game will be interesting in the same way that a derailment is. falcons win 3-2 on a walkoff by the god younghoe koo. falcons will immediately be invited to join the B1G West.\n\nsong is tight.\n\nTillian is sounding better than ever here, the addition of Andrew is a blessing, Johns throat shredding is awesome. This sounds like the best culmination possible at this point in their career.\n\nThe lyrics are definitely an insight to the internal struggles they've had to overcome in the past few years. I'm glad we finally have some perspective on what really went down.\n\nCan't wait to see them live\n\nWe're at a point where I think we can agree Hail the Sun's entire career overshadows DGD.\n\nWhich I already believed tbf, but nowadays, especially in the wake of Divine Inner Tension, feel like that's like a barely lukewarm take at best\n\n“Tillian is sounding better than ever here, the addition of Andrew is a blessing, Johns throat shredding is awesome.

I'm glad we finally have some perspective on what really went down“\n\nThat last line made me want to puke.\n\n\"@MeatSalad Sure, but the McBook thief can sing at least\"\n\nNah this narrative needs to die. Jonnyboi has been overdoing it on his past several appearances on whatever music project he uses to attempt to cling to relevance. He's got a great voice but just goes entirely overboard with it and it's grating as hell. Gimme Kurt any day of the week.\n\nYeah, letting Tilian back in cemented them all as douchebags but people were ragging on Mess and Swan just as hard when all this information first started coming out about Til.\n\nI was unaware if those two have also had a history of predatory behavior\n\n\"I can understand Tilian obviously but why do people hate Mess and Swan? This is a legitimate question, I'm not trying to sound ignorant or insensitive\"\n\nWhen he was 31 he and his girl announced their relationship at her 18th bday party\n\nI’ve invested in the war machine\n\nYou’re a piece of shit who doesn’t care\n\nI’ve got millions of mouths to feed\n\nMy seed you know, I love to share\n\nEndless violence is my only vice\n\nIt’s my skin suit I never wear\n\n(Skin suit I never wear)\n\nI’m always grinning with my pearly whites\n\nAt your blue eyes and long hair\n\nI’ve invested in the war machine\n\n\"You’re a piece of shit who doesn’t care\n\nI’ve got millions of mouths to feed\n\nMy seed you know, I love to share\n\nEndless violence is my only vice\n\nIt’s my skin suit I never wear\n\n(Skin suit I never wear)\n\nI’m always grinning with my pearly whites\n\nAt your blue eyes and long hair'\n\nIcky\n\nTillian is so boring as a vocalist now. They need a fresh sound. Part of what made DGD stand the test of time for so long is so many different eras of singers. Not to mention he's a complete asshole.\n\n\"Part of what made DGD stand the test of time for so long is so many different eras of singers.\" [2] Their first 4 albums sound so unique from each other, a lot of that being in part to who was in the band at the time.\n\nHot take: Andrew sounds bad here. Band needs to stop\n\nJon Mess dated an 18 yr old when he was 30, but the same people who cancelled Tilian actively ignore that\n\nThe band continues to support Tilian and his behavior, thus they are all shitty humans by proxy\"\n\nNailed it. Band is infested with scumbags and they need to stop\n\nim also not a huge andrew fan, he's pretty hit or miss with dgd and this is a miss tbh.\n\nyeah the jon shit gets hit with the \"not technically illegal\" and like yeah sure but still big gross lmfao, dude was at her hs graduation apparently!?!? big gross\n\nThe band continues to support Tilian and his behavior, thus they are all shitty humans by proxy [3]\n\nIf they had called their quits after DBM2 they could've had one of the best legacies in post-hardcore, they've been living off of fangirls ever since, it's because of their fanbases obsessive behaviour that they can get away with all their scummy things.\n\nThe case with Tilian just showcases that in their opinion you can get back to it without any repercussions after some serious allegations, some of them you have admitted to, so doesn't that just send the message that it's never been taken seriously?\n\nAllowing him back to the stage and shouting these perverted creepy shite lyrics is truly fucked up\n\n\"Will Levis is presumably starting this weekend, that should be pretty entertaining too!\"\n\nAs a Falcons fan this is at least exciting for me. I get to feel optimistic about the Falcons this year which is a rare occurrence for me. I'll take the hopium wherever I can get it\n\nWhen a member of a Podcast I listened to ended up doing some really shitty things the other members, his long time friends, instead of sweeping it under the rug kicked his ass off, got a new cohost, and moved on with their lives.\n\nIt's really not that hard to do the right thing and just get rid of the shithead, but bands like DGD act like holding on to Tilian is paramount to their survival. They could have just given him the boot and avoided this persistent narrative. At the very least it would have breathed some new life into their stagnant sound.\n\nOn the plus side at least they didn't pay Tilian a fully guaranteed $230 Million to not ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶o̶o̶t̶b̶a̶l̶l̶ sing.\n\n\"If they had called their quits after DBM2 they could've had one of the best legacies in post-hardcore, they've been living off of fangirls ever since, it's because of their fanbases obsessive behaviour that they can get away with all their scummy things.\"\n\nlegacy don't pay the bills homie\n\n@calc yeah I know, I would think that they're good enough musicians to have managed to carry on with different projects\n\nwith that said that's just what would've been perfect in my opinion, but after last year, they really should've called it's quits\n\nYeah with new Closure In Moscow and Wolf & Bear out this weekend (not too mention Kurt still killing it in Gold Necklace and elsewhere) there's absolutely no reason to listen to DGD anymore. I had a good ten year run of absolutely loving this band but holy fuck their sound is so played out and their fanbase are fucking creepy and weird as shit. Mothership should have been their last album.\n\n^ especially when dude beat-around-the-bush-admitted to it and then went to therapy for only a couple months to “work on it”\n\nPlus, they’re corny and wrote a song jerking themselves off over the whole thing and how they’ll rise up from it, like, really pulling the Tim Lambreastis card is gonna make them seem brave and like victims"
