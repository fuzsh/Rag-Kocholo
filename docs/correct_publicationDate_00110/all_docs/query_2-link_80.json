        "text": "Nick Cave and Bad Seeds bandmate Warren Ellis released a new collaborative track, “War Machine,” which appears on the soundtrack to Netflix’s upcoming film of the same name starring Brad Pitt.\n\nThe ambient instrumental kicks off with swirling analog synthesizers that harken back to the 1970s heyday of kraut-rock. From there, the song builds with marching snares and ringing bells, climaxing with a flurry of harmonized vocals.\n\nCave and Ellis, who recently scored Jeff Bridges Western Hell or High Water , said in a statement that “War Machine” epitomizes the tonal duality of their project. “Together we made a score that was both light and dark, propulsive and meditative at the same time,” they said. “We developed a kind of ‘spiritual electronics’ that captured both the melancholy and the terrible absurdity of the Afghan war. It was a great pleasure to work with David Michôd, who is not only an extraordinary filmmaker but a musician too. Our favorite score!”\n\nThe War Machine soundtrack is out via Lakeshore Records/Invada Records on May 26th, the same day the David Michôd-directed film debuts on Netflix, Pitchfork reports. Cave and Ellis contributed 14 of the album’s 19 tracks, alongside electronic/kraut-rock innovator Roedelius and chamber-rock band Rachel’s.\n\nTrending\n\nWar Machine stars Pitt as four-star General Glen McMahon, who is responsible for ending former president George W. Bush’s war in Afghanistan. The film co-stars Tilda Swinton, Sir Ben Kingsley, Anthony Michael Hall and Topher Grace.\n\nWar Machine Soundtrack Track List"
