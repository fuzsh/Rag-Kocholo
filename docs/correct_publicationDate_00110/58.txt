In June 1996 in rec.arts.books I asked if anyone knew of novels where the author inserted footnotes. There were many followups and some personal replies and I put together a summary, which I also posted. In July, I asked a similar question about indexes. I didnât get very many responses (indexes are a much less common device in fiction) so I just added that list here. Since then Iâve made a number of additions to both lists.

If you know of any other works of fiction that use footnotes or have an index, please let me know. Comments and elaborations are welcome. Thanks to everyone whoâs sent me mail about this.

For a long list of pre-1900 works with footnotes, see Miriam Lahrsowâs Self-Annotated Literary Works 1300-1900: An Extensive Collection of Titles and Selected Metadata.

And when I say footnotes, I include endnotes.

J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst: S. The footnotes are by the fictional translator of the novel-within-a-novel Ship of Theseus.

Douglas Adams: the Hitchhiker Trilogy (specifically the first book).

Roger MacBride Allen: âMonkey Seeâ (collected in Whatdunits, edited by Mike Resnick). An epistolary mystery, with letters by three scientists, and footnotes clarifying and arguing points.

Margery Allingham: Death of a Ghost (1934).

Eric Ambler: The Dark Frontier.

Piers Anthony: the 1989 Tor edition of But What of Earth?. Footnotes are comments by various editors who had rejected the manuscript.

Isaac Asimov: Foundation, Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation, one each book, where the first quote from the Encyclopedia Galatica gets a citation. (Perhaps other Foundation books too?). Also, Murder at the ABA, where Asimov argues with the narrator, Darius Just.

Paul Auster: Oracle Night (2003).

Nicholson Baker: The Mezzanine (1988).

J.G. Ballard: âNotes Towards a Mental Breakdown,â collected in War Fever. Itâs âone sentence (âA discharged Broadmoor patient compiles âNotes Towards a Mental Breakdown,â recalling his wifeâs murder, his trial and exoneration.â) and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.â See also the indexes list. As well, The Atrocity Exhibition, a collection of short stories, âmost of which consist of paragraphs with headings, some of which are pseudo-scientific reports. The reissue in 1990 had a series of marginal annotations by Ballard, about 10,000 words worth.â

Wilton Barnhardt: Gospel. Footnotes annotate the gospel the characters seek. Has an index, too.

Stephanie Barron (Francine Matthews): Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor: being the first Jane Austen Mystery (1996). Supposed diary account of Jane Austenâs adventures as a detective; includes âeditorialâ footnotes.

Roland Barthes: S/Z.

Emily Barton: The Testament of Yves Gundrun.

L. Frank Baum: Ozma of Oz. One footnote: âIt may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such a common thing as darn stockings. But, if you will stop to think, you will realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings, the same as other people; only it isnât considered quite polite to mention the matter.â

Samuel Beckett: Watt. Nine footnotes, including âHaemophilia is, like enlargement of the prostate, an exclusively male disorder. But not in this work.â

Larry Beinhart: American Hero (on which the movie Wag the Dog was based).

Josephine Bell: No Escape (1965).

Pamela Wharton Blanpied: DragonsâAn Introduction to the Modern Infestation. Not just footnotes and indexes, Iâm told, but charts, graphs, photographs, and a six-page bibliography.

Lawrence Blochman: See You at the Morgue (1941).

Michael Blumlein: X, Y.

Jorge Luis Borges: Ficciones. If youâre interested in fiction with footnotes, you probably already know Borges, and if you donât, go read this book immediately.

Karyn Bosnak: 20 Times a Lady (also published as Whatâs Your Number).

Anthony Boucher: The Case of the Seven of Calvary (1937), The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (1940), Nine Times Nine (1940), The Case of the Seven Sneezes (1942).

John Bude: The Sussex Downs Murder (1936)

Edgar Rice Burroughs: A Princess of Mars. ERB is the âeditorâ of John Carterâs manuscript. The one footnote reads, âI have used the word radium in describing this powder because in the light of recent discoveries on Earth I believe it to be a mixture of which radium is the base. In Captain Carterâs manuscript it is mentioned always by the name used in the written language of Helium and is spelled in hieroglyphics which it would be too difficult and useless to reproduce.â

A good union man.â âTEDDY ROOSEVELT: An American President.â

One footnote points back to the previous James Bond novel when CIA agent Felix Leiter mentions the âCasino jobâ they worked on: âThis terrifying gambling case is described in the authorâs Casina Royale.â The other is at the start of a lengthy quote from The Travellers Tree by Patrick Leigh Fermor: âThis, one of the great travel books, is published by John Murray at 25s.â

Cyril Hare: Death Is No Sportsman (1938).

L. Ron Hubbard: Battlefield Earth and the Mission Earth dekology. The footnotes go off on tangential plots in Battlefield Earth.

Gary Jaron: Through the Gate of Dreams. 248 endotes, and a bibliography.

Captain W.E. Johns: Biggles Defends the Desert. Probably just in this particular edition, published by Red Fox in 1993. The footnotes explain what a Spitfire is, what N.C.O. stands for, that âBocheâ (as in âjolly old Bocheâ) is derogatory slang for Germans, etc. Further checking shows a footnote or two in a 1940s edition of Biggles in the Orient. In fact I think quite a few Biggles books have footnotes.

Susan Johnson: Love Storm, A Touch of Sin, Golden Paradise, and other erotic romance novels.

Ben Jonson: Sejanus. Robert Teeter wrote me that âApparently, Ben was concerned that if he didnât back up his play with historical proof, people would think he was writing an allegory advocating overthrow of the monarch(y).â

Stephen Graham Jones: Demon Theory. Novelization of a nonexistent horror movie.

James Joyce: the âlessonsâ chapter of Finnegans Wake.

Jones of Scotland Yard, the sequel, also consists of documents like postcards and letters, some of which have footnotes; it also contains a footnote from the publisher directing the reader to another book regarding a certain plot point.

Michael Kun: You Poor Monster.

Barbara Lachman: The Journal of Hildegard of Bingen.

Ursula K. Le Guin: The Dispossessed. One footnote, for the word tadde: âPapa. A small child may call any mamme or tadde. Gimarâs tadde may have been her father, an uncle, or an unrelated adult who showed her parental or grandparental responsibility and affection. She may have called several people tadde or mamme, but the word has a more specific use than ammar (brother/sister), which may be used to anybody.â

The entire thing (which has footnotes), including the editor of the book, is a fabrication by Lindenberger.

E. Lockhart: The Boyfriend List (2005). A book for teenage girls. A girl recounts stories of all her boyfriends and crushes, heavily laced with footnotes.

Jack London: The Iron Heel. Howard Zinn wrote the introduction to the 1971 Bantam edition, and said, âThe footnotes of The Iron Heel, supposedly written many centuries later to inform readers of what life was like in the early twentieth century, still cut deep to fundamental truths.â

Dustin Long: Icelander (2006). Prefatory note from the âeditorâ says: âAs the author of Icelander seems to assume at least some knowledge of Magnus Valisonâs The Memoirs of Emily Bean, I have seen fit to scatter a few explanatory footnotes wherever I felt that readers unfamiliar with that series might benefit from a bit of background elucidation.â

Barry Lopez: âRubin Mendoza Vega,â collected in Light Action in the Carribean. Itâs one paragraph with sixteen footnotes.

In the first book (and I assume the other two) there are two narratives, one in the first person by a djinni, and he makes heavy use of footnotes.

Anthony Trollope: The Warden, in the 1878 edition of this book first published in 1855. In chapter 16 Mr. Harding goes to the Strangersâ Gallery in the House of Commons, and a footnote says of the arrangements, âHow these pleasant things have been altered since this was written a quarter of a century ago! [1878]â Two other footnotes say, âAgain what a change!â

Mark Twain: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. A single footnote, in chapter ten: âIf Mr. Harbison had owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as âHarbisonâs Bull,â but a son or a dog of that name was âBull Harbison.ââ

The inevitable result of a child marriageâ and â2. The subject of this epigrammatic poem is obviously from the provinces, since a native Parisian would take this famous old market for granted.â

Donald E. Westlake: Donât Ask (1993). Two chapter headings have footnotes that identify them as âOptionalâhistorical asideânot for credit.â Chapter six mentions a street with âa whole block of taxpayers.â This is footnoted: âA temporary structure, commonly one story in height and containing shops of the most ephemeral sort. Constructed by owners of the land when a delay is anticipated, sometimes of several decadesâ duration, between the razing of the previous unwanted edifice and the erection of the new blight on the landscape. Called a âtaxpayerâ because thatâs what it does.â â The second footnote, indented under the first, says, âDidnât expect a footnote in a novel, did you? And a real informative one, too. Pays to keep on your toes.â

Other

Bruce Andrews (the Language poet), âIndex,â included in Essaying Essays: Alternative Forms of Exposition (1975) edited by Richard Kostelanetz. Footnotes to footnotes.

Paul Auster, Hand to Mouth, his autobiography. Correspondent reports it âhas three footnotes which are given in the end of the book as they are quite lengthy â literally, they are different books themselves: the one is a novel, the baseball thriller Squeeze Play. The second footnote consists of three short plays. The third is a card game.â

The Pinball Effect and Other Journeys Through Knowledge, James Burke. Has hypertext jumps done with a marginal numbering system.

A Pilgrimage to Al-Medina and Meccah, Sir Richard Francis Burton. Not only does this have extensive footnotes, after revisions it ended up with some footnotes having footnotes. Burtonâs translation of The Thousand and One Nights also has lots of footnotes.

Hopscotch, Julio Cortazar. Almost 100 extra chapters can be added in for more information and digressions.

Generation X, Douglas Coupland. Definitions and things in the margins.

âThe Wasteland,â T.S. Eliot.

John Hollander, a poet, uses endotes.

âThe Anathemata,â David Jones. Poetry.

Nestor Burma mysteries, by Leo Malet, in German translation (I donât know if itâs the same translator as above). Each Burma story takes place in a different arrondissement of Paris.

Lempriereâs Dictionary, Lawrence Norfolk. He submitted notes with his (English) manuscript explaining the relation between the story and historical facts, but they werenât published. However, a German translator became intrigued with them and added 66 pages of glossary and notes.

âA Garland of Ibids,â in A Subtreasury of American Humor, Frank Sullivan (parody of Van Wyck Brooks).

Blue, by Benjamin Zucker. âBased on the structure of the Talmud,â says the Globe and Mail (19 August 2000), âthe novel has at its heart a story running down the centre of each page. Surrounding that column of type are commentaries in voices both of related fictional characters and of unrelated historical figures. Facing each page is a visual document relating either to the main story or one of the commentariesâ¦. It strikes me as a musty curiosity, and a very expensive one at that.â

Some people mentioned critical editions of books. Someone mentioned comic books, which have footnotes to tie the story in to earlier issues.
