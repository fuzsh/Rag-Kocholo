        "text": "A highly acclaimed and influential independent film that was written and directed by a Marion native is among the 2017 selections to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nRecently, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden announced the 2017 selections to the National Film Registry. This is an elite group of movies chosen by federal officials to be worthy of preservation by the Library of Congress.\n\nSelected for their cultural, historic and/or aesthetic importance, the latest group of 25 motion pictures range from an early film of the New York subway in 1905 to home movies and documentaries. The latest group chosen for the National Registry also includes Hollywood blockbusters like “Superman,” “The Goonies,” “Die Hard” and “Titanic,” according to a news release.\n\n“The selection of a film to the National Film Registry recognizes its importance to American cinema and the nation’s cultural and historical heritage,” Hayden said in the news release. “Our love affair with motion pictures is a testament to their enduring power to enlighten, inspire and inform us as individuals and a nation as a whole. Being tasked with selecting only 25 each year is daunting because there are so many great films deserving of this honor.”\n\n“Wanda,” the independent film written and directed by Barbara Loden, is one of those 25 motion pictures selected for the National Film Registry. Loden, who also starred as the title character, was born and raised in Marion.\n\nDepending on the source, the year of the movie’s release is either given as 1970 or 1971.\n\nThe Library of Congress describes “Wanda” as an “affecting and insightful character study about an uneducated, passive woman from the coal-mining region of Pennsylvania, where the cinema verite-like film was shot.”\n\n“The title character possesses critically low self-esteem, leaves her kids and husband and then drifts aimlessly into a series of one-night stands and a dangerous relationship with a bank robber,” reads the news release. “Today, many consider this low-budget study of loneliness and personal isolation one of the finest works of independent cinema during the 1970s.”\n\nSteve Leggett is the program coordinator for the National Film Preservation Board. He told The McDowell News that this board in Washington, D.C. has been criticized by film buffs over the years for not including “Wanda” in its registry. It is usually listed by critics as one of the finest independent films ever made.\n\n“Its status has really increased over the past couple of decades,” he said.\n\nHe added that after the announcement, he heard from people who told him they assumed “Wanda” had already been named.\n\n“She had a good eye as a filmmaker,” Leggett said of Loden. “There weren’t a lot of women directors at the time. She was a pioneer.”\n\nLoden wrote the script for “Wanda” and directed it on a budget of $115,000. She used mostly nonprofessional actors.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn a 1970s interview published in The McDowell News, Loden talked about a real-life woman who inspired her film.\n\n“She was given an unusually long sentence, and at the sentencing, she thanked the judge,” Loden said at the time. “I started to think about the kind of person for whom prison would be a relief, a person like Wanda who has no equipment to deal with life.”\n\nShe also talked to The McDowell News about her own life and career.\n\n“I have such a mishmash life,” she said at the time. “I’m not career oriented. I’ve always been interested in lots of different things, most of all learning and self education. I’m a professional student. And I always try to be my own person.”\n\nRight after the release of “Wanda,” Loden appeared, alongside John Lennon and Yoko Ono, on “The Mike Douglas Show” and talked about her film and presented a clip from it.

It has been shown on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nFor this work, Loden earned the International Critics Prize at the Venice Film Festival, the oldest event of its kind in the world. It was the only American film to appear at that year’s festival in Venice, Italy.\n\nBorn in Marion in 1932, Loden grew up on Sugar Hill Road and her parents divorced when she was young. She left her hometown as a teen for New York City with the ambition of becoming an actress. She more than achieved that goal. The attractive Loden went on appear on TV with comedian Ernie Kovacs and star in movies like “Wild River” and “Splendor in the Grass.” She won a Tony Award for her performance in Arthur Miller’s play “After the Fall.” She married legendary filmmaker Elia Kazan, who directed the Academy Award-winning “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “On the Waterfront.” Loden herself directed Off-Broadway productions for the New York stage.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Loden made “Wanda” and it would bring her out from the shadow of her famous husband and leave a lasting impact on critics and future directors alike. Through “Wanda,” Loden would earn her place in film history. Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum cites her work as one of the 100 greatest American films ever made. Her acting as the main character received much praise too. “Wanda” would also spark debates among some feminists who objected to what they perceived to be the main character’s weakness and portrayal as a victim, according to an article in The New York Times.\n\nDespite the critical acclaim from “Wanda,” Loden did not attempt to direct another feature film until 1980. She planned to adapt Kate Chopin’s classic novel “The Awakening” into a motion picture. In her later years, she kept in touch with relatives who lived in Marion.\n\nBut sadly, her time was short. A decade after the release of “Wanda,” Barbara Loden died of breast cancer in 1980 at age 48.\n\nUnder the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, each year the Librarian of Congress names to the National Film Registry 25 motion pictures that are “culturally, historically or aesthetically” significant. The films must be at least 10 years old. Spanning the period 1905 to 2000, the films named to this year’s registry include Hollywood blockbusters, documentaries, silent movies, animation, shorts and independent and home movies. The 2017 selections bring the number of films in the registry to 725, which is a small fraction of the Library’s vast moving-image collection of 1.3 million items, according to the news release.\n\nLeggett said to The McDowell News that some of the films named to the National Registry are in need of preservation and the Library of Congress works to make sure they will be available for future generations. In the case of “Wanda,” that work has already been done.\n\nA few years ago, the UCLA Film & Television Archive restored Loden’s work with funding provided by Gucci and The Film Foundation. Special screenings of “Wanda” were also held at that time in Venice, Italy and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
