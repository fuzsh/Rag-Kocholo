        "text": "Barbara Loden's life story is a scriptwriter's dream. A poverty stricken childhood, which she escaped first via modelling, then television and Hollywood stardom. Tempestuous marriage to On the Waterfront director Elia Kazan during which in 1970 she wrote, starred in and directed the movie Wanda. Finally, there was the fight to follow up on her impressive directorial debut, cruelly denied when she died 10 years later aged just 48, at precisely the time her remarkable film was finally gaining long overdue recognition.\n\nWanda's reputation continues to grow and perhaps the key to its deep resonance, which BFI London film festival audiences can experience at two rare screenings this month, is that its source is so personal to Loden.\n\nHer extraordinary performance as the acquiescent and emotionally blank Wanda is part of what makes the film so memorable. \"I used to be a lot like that,\" she admitted in an interview at the time of the movie's release. \"I had no identity of my own. I just became whatever I thought people wanted me to become.\"\n\nLoden was inspired by the story of a convicted female bank robbery accomplice who thanked the judge after he sentenced her to 20 years in jail. \"That's what struck me,\" said Loden discussing the film's origins. \"Why would this girl feel glad to be put away?\"\n\nThe resulting screenplay, reworked from Kaza's original, depicts a Pennsylvania housewife who abandons her family (as Loden's parents had similarly left the director to be raised by her grandparents) and frequents the seedy bars and motels of middle America before eventually going on the run with a small-time crook who plans a bank heist.\n\nWanda is a road movie that harks back to trailblazers of the US's independent scene, such as Andy Warhol, who Loden cited as an influence. Nicholas Proferes, the film's cinematographer and editor, worked on documentaries and his cinema-verite style was crucial in fashioning what is now recognised as a landmark in American independent film. Proferes's hand-held camerawork, the authenticity of the grimy milieu and Loden's acting caught the attention of the Venice film festival jury, where Wanda won the critic's prize in 1970.\n\nWanda, the character, disappears back into obscurity at the end, the arresting final image a nod to seminal French New Wave film The 400 Blows. That was also the fate of Loden's movie, which was fitfully revived – and only then in Europe – in the decade following its release. Kazan revealed in his autobiography that his wife died on the very day she was due to fly out to see it shown in France.\n\nPart of the reason her work was lost was that while Loden's film-making credentials were never in doubt, her singular portrait of Wanda was neglected by academics and cinema theorists. \"Wanda has been ignored by every major text of feminist film theory published in English over the last 20 years,\" said Bérénice Reynaud in an essay on Wanda in 2002.\n\n\"Wanda's historical importance [is that] Loden wanted to suggest, from the vantage point of her own experience, what it meant to be a damaged, alienated woman – not to fashion a 'new woman' or a positive heroine,\" argued Reynaud.\n\nRoss Lipman, who worked on Wanda's restoration for UCLA and who is travelling from California to introduce the LFF screening, says the response to the film's rediscovery has been overwhelming.\n\n\"I can't recall a screening where the audience was so moved by a film,\" he explained. \"This movie clearly taps into something which we've all known about but haven't seen addressed on screen. Wanda's character is at odds with any politicised sense of an empowering role for women – yet the film presents the direness of her situation more clearly than any polemical or 'politically correct' presentation could hope to achieve. It presents what many have felt or sensed, but dare not speak of.\"\n\nCritic Jonathan Rosenbaum has placed Wanda in his list of top 100 American movies and French actor Isabelle Huppert championed the film by releasing a DVD version in 2004. The newly restored movie, financed by Gucci and the Film Foundation, is currently being worked on for a fresh digital release. Lipman points out how lucky fans of Wanda are to see it at all.\n\nHe described how he found reels marked \"Wanda\" in 2007 in an abandoned film and video laboratory in Hollywood, where everything had been earmarked for the dump. \"Unspooling them on my workbench I quickly realised they were the original camera rolls, and that was only the beginning. The film was shot on a beautiful, unfaded Ektachrome reversal stock: any potential restoration would perhaps look better than even the original release. One day more and the original would have gone to landfill.\""
