        "text": "Barbara Loden is a filmmaker whose story is one shrouded in tragedy, both in life and death. In her early life she suffered under “incestuous rape by an uncle who would slip into her bed at night,” and only found relief when she ran away to join a “little troupe,” eventually winding up in New York (Léger 63). Eventually, Loden found her voice when she directed her feature length film, Wanda, which she wrote, directed, and starred in, citing her reasoning for playing the role of a woman abused, mistreated, misunderstood, and dominated by men as simply, “‘I was the best for it’” (Léger 19). Though what is most tragic about Loden’s story is that it is one which is rarely told. After Wanda’s initial release, she received critical acclaim and attention, which rapidly died down soon after the film’s extremely limited release, its only being shown “in one theatre in New York, Cinema II, and never shown in the rest of the country” (Reynaud 223). Although it was rumoured that she had plans to make additional films, her career was tragically cut short by cancer and she died at age 48 (IMDB). Extremely limited information can be found about Loden, and researching her is incredibly difficult. The most attention paid to her came from articles written about her contemporary, John Cassavetes, comparing their strikingly similar filmmaking styles, in which she is mentioned briefly, and in what was written about her by her second husband, Elia Kazan. Though Loden has been nearly forgotten in cinema discourse, this does not make her any less relevant to cinema. Rather, she is one of the most revolutionary and overlooked representations of the female voice in film.\n\nThe most comprehensive account of Barbara Loden’s life can be found in the book Suite for Barbara Loden, written by Nathalie Léger. This text, originally written in French, delves into the plot and creation of Loden’s only feature length film, Wanda, as well as other major points in Loden’s life which may have impacted her work. Léger details in the book a major issue one has when attempting to conduct research on Loden: there hardly exists any information. The overwhelming majority of information regarding Loden resides in a few personal documents she kept, retained by Loden’s son and a friend who co-wrote WANDA and other planned screenplays (Léger 57-60). The former, Léger details, denied her request and the latter sent her a letter which read “‘I don’t want to talk to you. For me that film, made forty years ago, is no longer part of my life, do you understand, it is no longer part of who I am’” (Léger 60). What further made writing about Loden extremely difficult was the “20-odd years of silence” in critical writing about Loden and her work after the initial early 1970s reviews of her film, Wanda (Reynaud 224). This silence was “sometimes broken by Raymond Carney, who, in his two books on John Cassavetes, mentions Loden as a director working along similar lines” (Reynaud 224).\n\nDespite having relatively nothing with which she could define the director, actress, and model, Léger pieced together Loden’s life in her 2012 book by referring to a book written by her second husband, Elia Kazan, the protagonists of which are strongly based on the lives and relationship history of Kazan and Loden. Slipping out of fiction and fact found in interviews and parsing out truth from Kazan’s 1967 book, the Arrangement, Léger provides one of the most concise histories of Loden’s life.\n\nBarbara Loden was born in North Carolina, in “hillbilly country” (Léger 23). She finally left when she “ran off to join Robert Brown’s Science Circus,” which eventually led her to New York at age 17. In New York, she worked under the name Candy Loden as she “posed for photo novellas and women’s magazines” (Léger 24). Eventually she took acting classes under the tutelage of Paul Mann and also classes in “dance, elocution, [and] singing” (Léger 25). In 1957 she “acted in Compulsion by Meyer Levin, on Broadway” and when she was 25 years old, she met her future husband, Elia Kazan, who “was twice her age” (Léger 25). In February of 1964, Loden “starred in the role of Maggie in Arthur Miller’s new play After the Fall” (Léger 54). In 1967, Kazan married Loden (Léger 26). Eventually, Loden was inspired to begin writing a screenplay based on the events detailed in a March 27, 1960 newspaper (Léger 9, 73). The newspaper article detailed “the story of the assault,. . . the kidnapping of the bank manager from his home, the lame attempt at a heist and the death of the little rough-neck named Ansley” (Léger 73). Loden felt moved to write about the woman at the center of the story, Alma Malone, as after she was “[s]entenced to twenty years in prison, she thanked the judge” (Léger 9). In an interview she gave shortly after her film based on this woman’s life, WANDA, won the International Critics Award at the 1970 Venice Film Festival, Loden “would say how deeply affected she had been by the story of this woman - what pain, what hopelessness could make a person desire to be put away? How could imprisonment be relief?” (Léger 9-10). Two of the most telling statements about who Barbara Loden was as an individual was her explaining the character of Wanda and describing herself. As Loden said, “‘Wanda’s character is based on my own life and on my character, and also the way I understand other people’s lives. Everything comes from my own experience. Everything I do is me’” (Léger 30). In a February 21, 1971 Sunday News article, she had the following to say about her childhood: “‘I was nothing. I had no friends. No talent. I was like a shadow. I didn’t learn a thing in school. I still can’t count. I hated movies as a child, people on the screen were perfect and it made me feel inferior’” (Léger 26). Later, in an interview with the Post, she stated: “‘I used to hide behind doors. I spent my childhood hiding behind my grandmother’s stove. I was very lonely’” (Léger 26). In an interview with Positif, she says “‘I’ve gone through my whole life like I was autistic, convinced I was worth nothing. I didn’t know who I was, I was all over the place, I had no pride’” (Léger 26). Barbara Loden died on September 5, 1980 in New York of cancer (Léger 32, IMDB). The last words she said were apparently, “Shit, Shit, Shit” (Léger 33).\n\nBased off of this description of herself, her 1970 feature length film Wanda reads as an unflinching exploration into what it means to be a woman; trying to work through what “feminine” means and what it is to be female to Loden herself and society. For this endeavor, this film is feminist, even though there are multiple moments within the film which could be argued as anti-woman or anti-feminist. Despite these moments in the film, overall, Wanda is a respectful look at a woman who is unsure of who she is, and therefore is someone who allows herself to be led around by men. Although the idea that a work can be respectful while still portraying a protagonist with little to no self-awareness or agency seems contradictory, the reason why they are not is because the act of attempting to merge these two ideas is an under-explored facet of womanhood, and an experience many women face which is often not represented in cinema. Wanda presents a different kind of woman. Through this dangerously underdeveloped character, Loden crafts a narrative which is propelled by social ills women face or are threatened with continually: physical abuse; rape; being valued only for their bodies or looks; and being categorised only as a mother and a home-maker, and having those small attributes define and determine one’s worth. In order to tell her story, Loden utilises a cinéma vérité, or documentary, style of filmmaking, allowing the audience to look at Wanda like the caged animal on display that she is.\n\nHer other two films, shorts released in 1975, are both educational in tone and are a far departure tonally and narratively from Wanda. The way in which The Frontier Experience is similar to Wanda is that it focuses intensely on a female character. Though where it radically departs narratively from Wanda is that it focuses on not only a family, but a 1869 settler family as they attempt to make a life for themselves in Kansas. In this short, Loden plays the mother of a family and is the direct opposite to Wanda. The mother in The Frontier Experience is a doting and dedicated homemaker and housewife who is heartbroken when her husband dies and makes difficult sacrifices for her family. Tonally, this short is strikingly similar to Wanda, in that while there will be a brief moment of relief from the sadness of the film, this moment is quickly undermined by additional depressive realities. This is best exemplified by the foot racing scene, which at its close, the mother gives her son over to a strange man so that he can make desperately needed money for the family, a sequence which is finished with a close-up shot of Loden’s face lit by the setting sun as she stands in the middle of nowhere, staring off into the distance.\n\nThe Boy Who Liked Deer is a short which is wholly dissimilar to both The Frontier Experience and Wanda both narratively and tonally. Surprisingly, in this short, the characters’ actions have direct consequences, which leads the film to have a strong moralistic tone unlike Loden’s other two works. Furthermore, the harsh interior lighting of this film, its tone, and narrative lend it to feeling like an after-school special which wants to impress upon children to behave well, focus on their schoolwork, and respect their elders. The children are cartoonishly bad, something which culminates in their destroying their teacher’s classroom and his autographed book, which is his prized possession. This results in the protagonist finding the teacher, thinking he is alone, crying. Directly after this, the child finds the deer he cared for near death or dead because of his reckless actions which resulted in them eating rat poison mixed in with their feed, making the child cry. Though what leads one to identify that this is a Loden film is the freeze frame at the end of the film on the protagonist, which also occurs at the end of Wanda, and the fact that the film ends on a depressing and hopeless tone.\n\nCritical responses to Barbara Loden’s work focus on Wanda, rather than her two shorts. The New Yorker incorrectly called the film “Barbara Loden’s only film as a director,” though went on to praise Wanda as “an authentic, original masterpiece,” stating that “[h]er grainy images, with their attention to place, light, and detail, have an intimate, sculptural texture; they give matter a soul. If there is a female counterpart to John Cassavetes, Barbara Loden is it” (“Movies”). In an Autumn 1971 edition of Film Quarterly, Estelle Changas claims that “Wanda is so burdened with the horror of belonging to the abject, outcast race of impoverished Americans that she hasn’t the luxury to lament her role as a female,” interestingly equating America’s poor to criminals, which is what Wanda and her accomplice, Mr. Dennis, become by the end of the film and describing Wanda’s journey as a lamentable one, when in fact, it is a journey she started by divorcing her husband and making the choice to abandon him and her children (Changas 50). Changas further asserts that “Loden is concerned with a more basic, universal question than sexual politics - the stark deprivation of the abandoned poor” (Changas 50). In a 2011 L.A. Weekly article, Karina Longworth cites Wanda as being “recognized as a feminist landmark of counter-Hollywood film” after its initial release, something I could not find corroborated in any other source (Longworth). In the rest of her article, she goes on to describe the basic information about Loden which one can find in a quick internet search, such as her cause of death and the age at which she died (Longworth). Then, apparently hitting the same issue which haunted Léger as she wrote her book, a lack of information on who Barbara Loden was, Longworth frequently cites Loden’s husband, Kazan, to provide the bulk of information about who she was in her article (Longworth). This leaves the unfortunate reality one has to face about Loden: as she was mostly ignored when alive, not much information can be found about her aside from what her husband decided he would say about her, thereby leaving her story to inevitably be told with a male perspective and influence. In a review by Marion Meade, she darkly states, “‘But now Barbara Loden arrives at the crux of the problem, which is, where do you go after you reject the only life society permits? And once a woman gains her freedom, what can she do with it? The answer: nowhere and nothing’” (Reynaud 224).\n\nThe only other filmmaker to whom Barbara Loden could be compared is John Cassavetes, her contemporary with which she shared a strikingly similar style and tonality. Cassavetes’ 1977 film, Opening Night, is closest to Wanda not only in its cinéma vérité style, narrative, and focus on a female protagonist, but also in that it is a film which he wrote, starred in, and directed.\n\nNarratively, both Wanda and Opening Night present as their protagonists broken and fractured women who do not have a firm grasp on who they are and how they exist in the world. Although at first glance, Loden’s Wanda and Cassavetes’ Myrtle seem to be worlds apart, Wanda being an impoverished, reluctant mother and housewife who goes on a self-imposed journey to find liberation and Myrtle being a successful theatre star fighting to maintain relevance in the face of younger, desperate female talent ready to replace her, the way their stories are told and the core message of both of their stories are essentially the same. As Myrtle slips in and out of sanity and Cassavetes blurs the lines between art and reality in his narrative, camera work, and acting style, so does Loden’s Wanda also lose society’s traditional concept of female sanity, deserting her family in order to live a life on her own, a major plot point which is given no justification narratively, through the camera work, or Loden’s realistic and sheepish acting style. Neither Wanda nor Myrtle are particularly brave or revolutionary feminist icons. Rather, the respective works in which they exist are feminist because both Wanda and Myrtle are shown dignity. Not only is their perspective explored thoroughly through the narrative, but also the camera work is highly expressive as it focuses on the women in long takes and close-up shots, tracking and moving with them as if personified as an empathetic spectator seeking to understand them or help them understand themselves. These films neither chastise nor deify their protagonists, providing for them excuses for their erratic behaviour; instead, the camera simply watches.\n\nIn order that one understand how similar Cassavetes and Loden’s directorial styles are, it is crucial to understand the meaning of their shared influence, cinéma vérité. This style of filmmaking was pioneered by Jean Rouch as he “moved away from this very purist cinéma direct to a more sociological investigation where he did intervene in the staging of shots and put his footage through the editing process - what has come to be termed cinéma-vérité” (Hayward 75). This type of cinema was created with the “the intention of provoking its spectators” through a kind of deconstructed take on film (Hayward 75). Cinéma vérité “is upstaged, non-dramatized, non-narrative cinema,” something which influenced both Godard and Guérin’s Dziga-Vertov group (Hayward 75). The reason why Cassavetes and Loden’s films are in the style of cinéma vérité rather than being cinéma vérité films is because one of the requirements to be considered a cinéma vérité film is that a film “puts forward an alternative version to hegemonic and institutionalized history by offering a plurality of histories told by non-elites;” in other words, a cinéma vérité film is one which is categorised as “quite a politicized cinema” (Hayward 75).\n\nThrough adopting a filmmaking style which mirrors that of a documentary film, Cassavetes and Loden allow their subjects and their camera work to wander and their actors to adopt a naturalistic manner of speaking. In Wanda, Loden’s characters, especially Wanda, all speak with “Um”’s and hesitations, as if they are making up their lines as they speak, making the audience forget that they are performing pre-written dialogue. Wanda’s line delivery is strikingly similar to that of Opening Night, as Cassavetes’ characters also speak as if their lines are unrehearsed, making it seem as though they are real people speaking whatever comes to their minds in real time. James Naremore contextualises the “impressive, utterly naturalistic looking characterization in Wanda” by ruminating that Loden “no doubt makes use of Method-style ‘sensory memory’ or even personal deprivation to create states of fatigue and hunger (see especially the scene in which she sops up spaghetti sauce with breads and chews with gusto while also smoking a cigarette)” (Naremore 35). Todd Berliner describes the acting style of Cassavetes’ actors as being the direct opposite of traditional Hollywood film dialogue, dissecting well-known cinematic conversations only to discover “a curious paradox about Hollywood movie dialogue: such dialogue may strike us as realistic, but it is most unlike real speech” (Berliner 6). Cassavetes’ dialogue, like Loden’s, “comes so close to real speech that it often sounds peculiar, like ad-libbing” (Berliner 8).\n\nIn addition to a shared manner of writing and line delivery, Cassavetes and Loden share a remarkably similar directorial style: one which appears unprofessional, stylised, and rough. Two scenes which best represent how similar the directors are is the scene in Wanda where Mr. Dennis and Wanda eat at their stolen car and the hitting scene in Opening Night. In the former, Loden pans into Wanda’s face, moving the frame in from a medium to a close-up shot and utilises multiple close-up shots of Wanda and Mr. Dennis’ face. Close-ups and camera movements are not ulitised as they would be traditionally, to accent a particularly important line or activity. Instead, the camera work is haphazard; shots simply happen, reminiscent of a nature documentary film, wherein the camera becomes transfixing and a character in itself. Similarly, John Cassavetes utilises the same directorial style in the grueling, most unbearably difficult scene to watch in Opening Night, the scene during which Maurice, Myrtle, and Manny rehearse the scene in which she is to be struck by Maurice on stage as a few characters watch from the theatre seats. In this scene, the audience is made aware that the camera exists in that its movements are schizophrenic: cutting from intense close-ups to extreme close-ups of characters’ faces, framing the theatre stage in a medium long shot so that the film audience feels as though they are sitting in the theatre watching the rehearsal, and swirling the camera around the space of the theatre during the sequence in which Myrtle falls to the ground after actually being struck by Maurice. Raymond Carney describes Cassavetes’ films as being of the type where “[m]eanings have none of the expansiveness, impersonality, or metaphoric generality of a visionary experience. . . That is why, to an eye accustomed to visionary stylistics, Cassavetes films look confused and disorganized” (Carney 115). Carney goes on to elaborate that Cassavetes’ camera work “is not the mess of unplanned, sloppy work that one is witnessing, but the mess of life lived without visionary releases and clarifications” (Carney 115). This stylistic endeavor creates in the viewer a sensation which is best described by Cassavetes himself: “‘I’m interested in shaking people up, not making them happy by soothing them. . . It’s never easy. I think that it’s only in ‘the movies’ that it’s easy’” (Carney 106).\n\nBarbara Loden is valuable to cinema discourse not only because she offers just as much as her contemporary, John Cassavetes, or any other male artist, but because she is talented in her own right. The most reasonable, and unfortunate, conclusion as to why she has been left in near obscurity despite her well-received debut film is that she was simply overshadowed by the men in her life and in her field, most notably Elia Kazan and Cassavetes. Although she is an artist who will most likely be undiscovered by many, Loden is an irreplaceable auteur who has proven her worth in only one feature film, an incredibly rare achievement."
