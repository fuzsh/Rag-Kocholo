        "text": "Feeling poor and powerless? On 22 November, our ninth Dead Ladies Show resurrects three awe-inspiring women who battled poverty and patriarchy to achieve great things. Join us in your finest rags at 8 pm in the ACUD Studio to hear their amazing stories (in German and English) over a drink or two (alcoholic or non-). Entry will be €5 (€3 for the financially challenged), and, as always, invite your friends!\n\nYour beloved co-host Florian Duijsens presents artist Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, writer and translator Amanda DeMarco brings you director Barbara Loden, and filmmaker Marlene Pardeller shares the story of Tina Modotti. We expect you to go home feeling rebellious, riotous, righteous, and ready to change the world yourselves.\n\nELSA VON FREYTAG-LORINGHOVEN was one of those eccentric dames we know you just love to love. A Dada artist who married a penniless busboy baron and lived in grinding poverty in New York and Paris, she is now thought to be the real inventor of the famous “readymade” claimed by Marcel Duchamp. One of her outfits consisted of a bra made from two tomato cans and green string, a small birdcage complete with canary hung around her neck, a large number of stolen curtain rings worn as bracelets, and a hat decorated with vegetables, all worn with a red coat over the top. Elsa was art.\n\nBARBARA LODEN was an ace movie director.\n\nTINA MODOTTI, as a teenager, left behind the shoe factory in Udine where she had started working at the age of 8, and set off to San Francisco to become a silent-movie star. Soon the camera itself attracted her, and she ended up photographing the Mexican revolution. From there, she moved on to the Soviet Union and then the Spanish Civil War, only to mysteriously abandon photography and become a nurse and war reporter. Returning to Mexico a convinced revolutionary, Modotti died under unclear circumstances but is widely remembered both there and abroad.\n\nIt’s freezing outside and you may well be facing your family for days on end rather soon.\n\nSo first, why not enjoy a seasonal evening celebrating three seasoned ladies: cabaret performer and famed trouser-wearer Claire Waldoff, plus two Hollywood legends, actress and director Barbara Loden, and child and adult star Natalie Wood. All presented to you by translator and publisher Amanda DeMarco, and author and journalist Katja Kullmann, then after a break co-host Katy Derbyshire with special musical guests Hans Kellett and Sigrid Grajek. All in a mishmash of English and German! Your beloved co-host Florian Duijsens will be holding it all together.\n\nEvent includes seasonal socializing/commiseration and very possibly eggnog, Gühwein, or a similarly wintry beverage. Heating and conviviality will be provided free of charge."
