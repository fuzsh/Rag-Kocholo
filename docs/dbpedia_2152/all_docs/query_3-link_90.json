        "text": "NEW YORK -- Director Elia Kazan whose triumphs included the original Broadway productions of \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and the Academy Award-winning film \"On the Waterfront\" died yesterday. He was 94.\n\nKazan was at home in Manhattan when he died lawyer Floria Lasky said. She did not give a cause of death.\n\n\"A genius left us\" Lasky said. \"He was one of the greats.\"\n\nFive of the plays he staged won Pulitzer Prizes for their authors \"The Skin of Our Teeth\" \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" \"Death of a Salesman\" \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" and \"J.B.\" for which Kazan himself won a Tony Award. Other stage credits included \"Camino Real\" \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" and \"Tea and Sympathy.\"\n\nIn Hollywood he won Oscars for directing \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and \"On the Waterfront.\" He also did \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" the film version of \"Streetcar\" \"East of Eden\" \"Splendor in the Grass\" \"A Face in the Crowd\" and \"The Last Tycoon.\"\n\nHe turned to writing in his 50s and produced six novels -- including several best sellers -- and an autobiography. The first two novels \"America America\" and \"The Arrangement\" he also made into movies.\n\n\"Even when I was a boy I wanted to live three or four lives\" he once said.\n\nTo some Kazan diminished his stature when he went before the House Committee on Un-American Activities during the McCarthy era and named people he said had been members of the Communist Party with him in the mid-1930s.\n\nBut he insisted years later that he bore no guilt as a result of what some saw as a betrayal. \"There's a normal sadness about hurting people but I'd rather hurt them a little than hurt myself a lot\" he said.\n\nIn early 1999 leaders of the motion picture academy announced they would give Kazan a special Academy Award for his life's work. The decision reopened wounds and touched off a painful controversy.\n\nOn awards night some in the audience withheld applause though others gave him a warm reception. Director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro presented the award.\n\n\"I thank you very much. I really like to hear that and I want to thank the academy for its courage generosity\" Kazan said.\n\nHe started out as a stage actor but his ambition was to direct which he began doing in the mid-1930s. The breakthrough came when he staged Thornton Wilder's \"The Skin of Our Teeth\" in 1942 and won a New York Drama Critics Award.\n\nHe first teamed with Arthur Miller to direct \"All My Sons\" and went on to do \"Death of a Salesman\" which one critic termed \"as exciting and devastating a theatrical blast as the nerves of modern playgoers can stand.\"\n\nHis Broadway collaboration with Tennessee Williams began with \"Streetcar\" in 1947 and later included \"Camino Real\" \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" and \"Sweet Bird of Youth.\"\n\n\"He approaches a play more critically than anyone I know; you find yourself doing more revisions for him than for any other director\" Williams once said.\n\nKazan Lee Strasberg and other Group Theatre alumni founded the Actors Studio in 1948 which became a sort of spiritual home for theater people. Actors liked Kazan's approach to directing.\n\n\"Some directors regard actors as a necessary evil; others as children to be handled\" actress Mildred Dunnock once said adding that Kazan treated actors \"like an equal. Once he casts you he makes you confident.\"\n\nKazan left Broadway and the Actors Studio in 1962 to co-direct with Robert Whitehead the Lincoln Center Repertory Company. He resigned after two disastrous seasons saying he was \"not an administrator by taste.\"\n\nHis friendship with Miller was never the same after his congressional testimony. Kazan talked with Miller before he testified and Miller later wrote in his journal about a side of his friend that he had not seen before \"He would have sacrificed me as well.\"\n\nKazan told the committee that he had joined a unit of the Communist Party made up of members of the Group Theatre in summer 1934 and left 18 months later disillusioned at \"being told what to think and say and do.\"\n\nPlaywright Clifford Odets actress Phoebe Brand and Paula Miller Strasberg's actress-wife were among the eight he identified as communists.\n\nHe defended his naming names on the grounds that all were already known to the committee; others have said that at least half were not.\n\nSome critics saw in a subtext of \"On the Waterfront\" a justification for Kazan's decision to cooperate with congressional red hunters. The movie's hero portrayed by Marlon Brando breaks the code of silence on the docks and courageously fingers a corrupt murderous union boss in televised hearings.\n\nIn his 1988 autobiography an 848-page tome titled \"Elia Kazan -- A Life\" Kazan wrote candidly of the many affairs he had over the years including one with Marilyn Monroe.\n\n\"The affairs I've had were sources of knowledge; they were my education\" he wrote. \"For many years in this area and only in this area I've used the lie and I'm not proud of that. But I must add this My 'womanizing' saved my life. It kept the juices pumping and saved me from drying up turning to dust and blowing away.\"\n\nKazan once said he turned to writing because \"I wanted to say exactly what I felt. I like to say what I feel about things directly and no matter whose play you direct or how sympathetic you are to the playwright what you finally are trying to do is interpret his view of life. ... When I speak for myself I get a tremendous sense of liberation.\"\n\nBorn Elia Kazanjoglous on Sept. 7 1909 in what was then Constantinople Turkey he was the son of a Greek rug merchant. The family came to New York when Kazan was 4 and he grew up in a Greek neighborhood in Harlem and later suburban New Rochelle.\n\nHe went to Williams College where he picked up the nickname Gadget -- \"I guess because I was small compact and eccentric\" he once said. Shortened to Gadge it was a name that stuck and one that he came to loathe.\n\nDuring his senior year he saw Sergei Eisenstein's film \"Potemkin\" and focused on the performing arts. After graduating with high honors he attended the Yale University Drama School then joined the Group Theatre in New York in 1933.\n\nKazan a short stocky intense man preferred casual dress and was direct in social dealings.\n\n\"Gadge is the kind of man who sends a suit out to be cleaned and rumpled\" actress Vivien Leigh once remarked. \"He doesn't believe in social amenities and if he is bored by any individual or group he simply departs without apology or explanation.\"\n\nKazan married three times. With first wife Molly Day Thatcher he had four children Judy Chris Nick and Katharine. After her death he married Barbara Loden and they had two sons Leo and Marco. She died of cancer in 1967; in 1982 he married Frances Rudge.\n\nThis story appeared on Page A14 of The Standard-Times on September 29 2003."
