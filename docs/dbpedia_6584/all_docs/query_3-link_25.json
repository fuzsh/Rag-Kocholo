        "text": "Vincent Van Gogh once said, “What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?”\n\nI am most afraid of heights and snakes. I used to be afraid of public speaking. However, lots of speaking opportunities has allowed me to embrace and enjoy it, and become effective.\n\nThe months of August, September and October are known as fall baseball months. This is when travel baseball coaches advertise that their players get to work on things for the sake of development.\n\nIt sounds like a great plan, but often is never implemented because we don’t have an understanding of development.\n\nI’ve been coaching players for more than 25 year. In the beginning, failing to get players to reach their full potential on purpose forced me to become an avid reader and get a coaching mentor of my own.\n\nI’ve grown to understand that development has a starting and ending point—one rooted in a mission and vision that has an evaluable outcome.\n\nMission – A mission is a short statement of why you are doing what you are doing, as well as the overall goal(s).\n\nVision – A vision is what happens when the mission is accomplished.\n\nEvaluable Outcome – Outcome evaluation is used to identify the results of a program’s effort.\n\nFor some, the word development can be like air. You know it is there and why it is needed, but you don’t completely understand how it works.\n\nCourage is what we do in response to our feelings of fear.\n\nMost hitters are afraid to try new things because they are afraid to fail. I get it. But if you ain’t failing, you ain’t excelling.\n\nUnder my leadership, my hitters are committed to trying new things to determine what works and what doesn’t August through October.\n\nI challenged them to try different stances and different loads to improve their approach to the ball, and in an effort to try to produce more power.\n\nIf they cannot be allowed three months to be innovative and to tap into their athleticism, how will they ever be able to compete at the collegiate and/or professional levels.\n\n“The hallmark of successful people is that they are always stretching themselves to learn new things.” — Carol S. Dweck\n\nFor more information, visit L.E.A.D. Center for Youth today. Also, check out our Digital Magazine.\n\nC.J.

And belief comes from experience. The critical change construct that I have created for my life begins with conviction and ends with change.\n\nConviction\n\nConnection\n\nConsensus\n\nCollaboration\n\nChange\n\nStarting with conviction allows me to get connected with others at the heart and then the head. Dealing with heart issues can cause hurt feelings and hurt feelings can lead to helpful friends.\n\nI am suggesting that the experience of hurt can lead to change and our overcoming of the hurt can cause us to have strong belief in ourselves to do significant and extraordinary things.\n\nAccording to Vinney (Smile) Chopra, there are five amazing benefits of believing in oneself:\n\nYou become more focused in life.\n\nYou begin to be an inspiration.\n\nYou’re contaminated with positivity.\n\nYou’ll come up with better decisions.\n\nYou’re happier.\n\nIt is true that hurting people hurts people. Let conviction lead the way to change and remember that experiences can lead to empowerment.\n\nFor more information, visit L.E.A.D. Center for Youth today.

There was a horse, a coachman to stir the reins used to direct the horse, and the coach was where the passenger rested until they reached their destination.\n\nT – Talent\n\nA – Attitude\n\nL – Listening\n\nL – Leveling-up\n\nTalent\n\nTalent is what you do well.\n\nHaving God-given bat speed is talent. Being able to maintain that bat speed, making contact and driving the ball against varying pitch types, locations and speeds is skill.\n\nAttitude\n\nAttitude is how you act.\n\nHaving a good attitude when things are going well is one thing. Maintaining it when things are not going well is another thing.\n\nListen\n\nListening and hearing are not the same. Listening leads to understanding and when you understand something, you can do something.\n\nWhat if you had an opportunity to be trained by the world’s greatest hitting coach for a week with a guarantee you could develop into one of the top hitters in America?\n\nBut what if your new hitting coach did not speak the same language as you? You could hear what he was saying, but you wouldn’t be able to understand.\n\nAs Alan Alda said, “Listening is being able to be changed by the other person.”\n\nLeveling-up\n\nTo level up means to increase something in order to remove unfair treatment of others.\n\nWhat do you call a person who has success and uses it to serve others? I call that person significant.\n\nRemember: Skills pay the bills and significant people can change the life of struggling people.\n\nSince talent is what you do well and habits are things you do well repeatedly without thought, skills are things you do well repeatedly without thought while under stress.\n\nI challenge you to use fall baseball wisely so you can develop the skills you need to achieve your future goal because there are people whose lives are tied to your dreams.\n\nFor more information, visit L.E.A.D.

Stewart has a proven system of development and a track record of success that can work for you.\n\nMy coaching philosophy is that practice prepares you to perform and performance prepares you to practice. My four phase development strategy starts in August each year with a commitment to assessment to determine what does not work and what does work for three months.\n\nThis is how I do things and it works for me—those who I instruct to coach and the boys who are coached by my coaches.\n\nI was on vacation with my family in July in Jamaica, where you have to drive on the left side of the road. That can be crazy.\n\nIt’s about what’s right in addition to who’s right.\n\nIt was my first time experiencing this and I was a bit uneasy. I had to trust the experience and expertise of the other driver. I had to submit and humble myself.\n\nIn our Assessment Phase for L.E.A.D. Center For Youth, we don’t teach; we use contests and competition to lead the learning for our players.\n\nBeing athletic is about being able to think critically at a high level to get things down that you’ve never done before or have little experience doing. I am convinced that coaches coach greatness out of our players more than we do to bring it out by spending too much time talking rather than allowing our players to figure things out.\n\nKinesthetic learners love the Assessment Phase because they are hands on. Visual and auditory learners struggle during this time but their dominant learning style is elevated during our Engagement Phase (November-January) when it is time to build habits and strength based on what works.\n\nWe do a lot of teaching during this time now that I have seen what they can and cannot do for three months.\n\nThis fall, I ask my players to do three things: be athletic, submit and be humble.\n\nAthletic – being able to think critically at a high level to get things down that you’ve never done before or have little experience doing\n\nSubmit – yield to the authority or the will of another person\n\nHumility – not thinking less than of myself but thinking of others more than myself\n\nI want my players to get the best:\n\nCollege baseball offers\n\nMLB Signing Bonuses\n\nNIL Deals in high school and college\n\nPost athletic career transition\n\nFor more information, visit L.E.A.D.

Stewart has a proven system of development and a track record of success that can work for you.\n\nAssessment before teaching is like a baby learning to walk before running. With more than 25 years of experience developing some of baseball’s top players, I have learned a lot of great lessons the hard way.\n\nI’ve wasted time throwing batting practice to hitters who couldn’t take two consecutive good swings using a tee.\n\nI’ve talked too much to hitters who are dominant visual learners.\n\nI have operated my business on the trite “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” mantra because I didn’t have a proven coaching philosophy or methodology.\n\nI am no longer that rookie “faking it until I make it coach.”\n\nMy coaching philosophy is that practice prepares you for performance and performance prepares you for practice. My time tested and true A.T.B.A.T.S. Methodology starts with a thorough assessment of my hitters ensuring that I tap into their mind, body and soul.\n\nAs I was recently on a flight at 30,000 feet, I started thinking about the word assess. The word has been on my mind because L.E.A.D. Center For Youth is now partnering with Minority Baseball Prospects (MBP), which will help us win championships on the diamond and continue helping our boys win at the game of life.\n\nOn Sunday, Aug. 20, 2023, LEAD is sponsoring 100 slots for baseball players in Atlanta Public Schools (2024-2028 classes) to get evaluated by MBP’s proprietary, signature Swaggy Chain rating system. Select baseball players will be invited to join LEAD’s Ambassador Program which includes year round baseball training, development and competition as well as college and career support, all at no-cost to families.\n\nI struggle with ADHD and I am high functioning. Because of this, acronyms are a Godsend for me.\n\nA – Adaptable\n\nS – Sluggish\n\nS – Safe\n\nE – Energetic\n\nS – Stress-conqueror\n\nS – Skilled\n\n“Success is not for those who want it, nor those who need it, but for those who are utterly determined to seize it–whatever it takes.” — Darren Hardy\n\nPeople that want to become Major League Citizens in Atlanta and/or Major League Baseball Players must be adaptable rather than being sluggish and playing it safe. Their energy needs to be on 100% especially when there is stress because skills pay the bills.\n\n“Words are potent weapons for all causes, good or bad.” — Manly Hall\n\nadaptable – The ability to adjust to new conditions.\n\nsluggish – Slow moving oftentimes as a result of lack confidence in your ability to do something.\n\n“playing it safe” – To be careful and not take risks to avoid failure.\n\nenergy – The strength required for sustained physical, emotional and/or mental activity.\n\nstress – There are two types of stress, eustress and distress. Eustress is moderate or normal psychological stress and interpreted as being beneficial. Distress is extreme anxiety, sorrow, or pain and is interpreted as being detrimental.\n\nskills – Talent is what you do well and habits are things that you do well repeatedly without thought. Skills are things that you do well repeatedly without thought while under stress.\n\nFor more information, visit L.E.A.D. Center for Youth today. Also, check out our Digital Magazine.\n\nC.J.
