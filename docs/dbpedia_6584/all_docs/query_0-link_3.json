        "text": "Story by Yinzer Crazy Contributor Charlotte Hopkins\n\nIn 1880, the Allegheny Base Ball Club was established, becoming the first professional sports team in the Pittsburgh area. The team called Allegheny City home, which is now called North Side. In 1887, they were renamed Pittsburgh Alleghenys. In 1991, their name was changed one final time to the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pittsburgh Penguins were founded in 1967 and the Pittsburgh Steelers were established on July 8, 1933. Between the rise of these teams were many more that came and went, including the Pittsburgh Amercks (football), Pittsburgh rebels (baseball), and the Pittsburgh Victorias (hockey). These are 18 more Pittsburgh sports teams that no longer exist.\n\n1) The Pittsburgh Burghers played for one season in 1890 where they finished in 6th place. Several players went on to play for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the team that became the Pittsburgh Pirates. John Tener, of the Burghers, went on to serve as the Governor of Pennsylvania from 1911-1915.\n\n2) The Pittsburgh Duquesne hockey team played intermittently following their debut in 1895. They played for one year and came back in 1898 to play for another year. They came back in 1908 and played for two years. The team was re-established in 1916 and played until 1920.\n\n3) The Pittsburgh Bankers hockey team was established in 1899 and played until 1904. They were brought back in 1907 and played until 1909. They were the first hockey team to call Pittsburgh home. They were also the first team to trade professional hockey players. The Pittsburgh Bankers hired men in Canada to come to Pittsburgh to play hockey. However, they were also required to work a set number of hours in the bank. Players were nicknamed “the money men.”\n\n4) The Homestead Grays got their start in 1900 under the name the Germantown Blue Ribbons. In 1910, they were renamed the Murdock Grays. It was two years later (1912) that they were named the Homestead Grays. The team played until 1950.\n\n5) This is the only known photo of the Pittsburg Stars football team. They only played for one season (1902). Though they won the national championship title, they disbanded a year later.\n\n6) The Pittsburgh Professionals was a hockey team that played from 1904-1907. Hod Stuart, who played for the Pittsburgh Professionals, was later dubbed the “greatest hockey player in the world.”\n\n7) The Pitcairn Quakers played football from 1904-1920. The team was founded by Terry DeLozier, Clyde Collins, and John Johnstonbaugh. DeLozier was a former quarterback for Pitt.\n\n8) The Pittsburgh Lyceum hockey team played from 1907-1908. They disbanded due to their players leaving to play for other teams. Lyceum player, Tommy Smith, went on to play for 16 teams and was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n9) The HJ Heinz baseball team was comprised of employees from the Heinz factory. The team played from 1907-12.\n\n10) The Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets played from 1915-1925 as a part of the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA). In 1924, they were re-established under the National Hockey League and their name was changed to the Pittsburgh Pirates. They played hockey under the Pirates name until 1930. From there, they became a part of the Eastern Hockey League, under their original name, the Yellow Jackets. They played from 1935-1937. They were the first Pittsburgh hockey team to win a national title.\n\n11) Gus Greenlee established the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1932. He named the team after the Crawford Grill Club, one of his favorite establishments in the city. They played from 1933-1937.\n\n12) The Pittsburgh Shamrocks Hockey team only played for one season, from 1935-1936. This photo features Nick Wasnie, Billy Hudson, Scotty Martin, Conrad Bourcier, Henri Goulet, and Jean Bourcier. Players Hidson and Martin were the only ones to play in all 46 games.\n\n13) The Pittsburgh Hornets were a part of the American Hockey League. They were established in 1936 and played until 1956. They were brought back in 1962 and were disbanded in 1967. When the team started, their colors were red and white. It was not until the 1950s that they switched to black and gold, the city’s trademark colors.\n\n14) During World War II, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles lost a number of players who were now serving overseas in the military. Art Rooney (Steelers owner) and Burt Bell (Eagles owner) decided to merge their teams and created the Steagles. On the record, they were named Phil-Pitt. The fans referred to them as the Steagles and that would be the name that would stick. The team only played for one season in 1943.\n\n16) The Pittsburgh Rens (short for Renaissance) made their debut in 1961. They were one of the eight teams that made up the American Basketball League (ABL). The Ren played their last game in 1967.\n\n17) The Pittsburgh Pipers basketball team was founded in 1967 as part of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Haven Industries bought the team in 1968 and renamed them the Condors.\n\n18) Pittsburgh Spirit was one of the original 6 teams that made up the Major Indoor Soccer League. They were established in 1978 and played until 1981. They were brought back in 1982 by Edward DeBartolo. They continued to play from 1981-1986."
