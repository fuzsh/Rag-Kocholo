        "text": "IN SHORT\n\nGONACON VACCINE COULD OFFER LASTING RESULTS FOR MANAGING WILD HORSE POPULATION\n\nColorado State University recently released a study touting the use of the GonaCon-Equine immunocontraceptive vaccine as a longer-lasting solution to decreasing fertility in wild horses.\n\nThe CSU research team first vaccinated mares at the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota in 2009 and saw a modest decline in foaling. Researchers decided to re-administer the vaccine to the same mares in 2013.\n\n“No one had tried revaccinating with GonaCon-Equine and it's proving to be much more successful than we expected. … It has been about 90 percent effective for going on four years now,” said Dan L. Baker, PhD, co-principal investigator on the project and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the CSU College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThe vaccine produces antibodies against gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which prevents the mares from ovulating and from displaying sexual behavior, said Terry M. Nett, PhD, co-principal investigator on the project and a professor in the CVMBS' Department of Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThis new vaccine could aid in better controlling the population of wild horses. The number of wild horses and burros that can live in balance with the ecology of public lands is 27,000 but there are currently 82,000 wild horses and burros living on public lands, according to the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nMERCK OFFERS VIDEO INTERVIEWS WITH EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS\n\nThe Merck Veterinary Manual has added a series of video interviews with its editorial board members to its collection of digital resources. Board members discuss their personal experiences in veterinary medicine, provide career advice, and explore current issues in animal health.\n\nThe interviews feature Drs. Peter D. Constable, dean of the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine; Peter R. Davies, a professor of swine health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine; and Katherine E. Quesenberry, head of avian and exotic pet medicine at the Animal Medical Center in New York City.\n\nThe interviews are available at www.merckvetmanual.com by clicking on “Editorial Board” under the “About” tab.\n\nSURVEY FINDS MORAL DISTRESS AMONG VETERINARIANS\n\nVeterinarians across many practice types and demographic categories experience widespread ethical conflict and moral distress, according to a study published Oct. 15 in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine.\n\nA survey of nearly 900 current and former practicing veterinarians in the U.S. and Canada found a majority felt conflicted over appropriate patient care. Seventy-nine percent of respondents reported being asked to provide care they considered futile, and more than 70 percent reported having no training in conflict resolution or self-care.\n\n“Our findings show that many veterinarians are distressed and anxious about their work and are troubled by many of the requests that are made of them,” the study authors wrote. “Many feel like they are just ‘going through the motions’ and although many are troubled, very few receive any professional help. The majority of respondents who do take action to cope with their distress talk with colleagues or others, presumably informally, instead of seeking professional help.”\n\nThe authors concluded that ethical conflict and resulting moral distress may be an important source of stress and poor well-being among veterinarians that is neither widely recognized nor well-defined. They encouraged the adoption of tools used to decrease moral distress in human health care workers.\n\nThe study is available at https://jav.ma/DisStudy.\n\nPlease send comments and story ideas to JAVMANews@avma.org.\n\nLowering hurdles of licenses\n\nGovernment, veterinary coalitions try to ease licensing barriers across states\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nGovernment and veterinary leaders are trying to make it easier for professionals to keep working when they change states.\n\nVeterinary associations, governors, legislators, and federal trade regulators are running a mix of projects to reduce the work people need to do to meet state job licensing requirements. At the same time, legislators in a dozen states have proposed revising or reviewing professional licensing rules, raising concerns in veterinary organizations that veterinary technicians could become targets.\n\nFederal Trade Commission officials published a policy paper this fall that encourages state authorities to improve license portability for a wide spectrum of professions. Licensing of many professions protects the public, but state-by-state job licensing requirements burden people who want to sell services or live in another state, the document states.\n\nOPENING THE VAULT\n\nJames Penrod, executive director of the American Association of Veterinary State Boards, said association staff are trying to simplify the process of licensing veterinarians and veterinary technicians already recognized in other states.\n\nFor 20 years, the association has given licensing boards background information on veterinarians and veterinary technicians through its Veterinary Information Verifying Agency database, which contains scores from licensing examinations and other credentials. AAVSB staff now are building on that database with the Veterinary Application for Uniform Licensure Transfer program.\n\nThe VAULT is intended as a single source for license application information, including primary source documents and discipline history. Penrod provided information that indicates VAULT reduces efforts needed to gather and coordinate information for license review, and the AAVSB guarantees that documents sent to boards are authentic.\n\nVeterinary boards from eleven states are using VAULT, and representatives from 14 more have expressed interest, Penrod said.\n\nUNITING THE STATES\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures, Council of State Governments, and National Governors Association also are examining state licensing rules in a three-year project backed by $7.5 million from the Department of Labor. The organizations together represent state legislators, governors, judges, and employees.\n\nIn the project, elected officials and staff representatives from 11 states are studying how state rules vary for 34 jobs, including veterinary technicians. All of the jobs are growing professions that require less than four-year degrees and are regulated in at least 30 states.\n\nAn NCSL report from January notes that people without four-year degrees have higher unemployment rates. The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that, as of August 2018, unemployment rates for people 25 and older ranged from 3.5 percent among people with associate degrees to 5.7 percent among people with less than a high school diploma.\n\nSuzanne Hultin, director of the Employment, Labor & Retirement Program for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the project of examining state licensing rules helps policymakers research effects of license requirements on people such as military veterans and their spouses, immigrants who have work authorization, and people with criminal histories. The project is helping policymakers connect with experts and learn from one another, she said.\n\nBut people have mistaken the focus on the 34 professions for a “hit list” for deregulation, Hultin said.\n\n“You could argue that, if it's licensed in 30 or more states, chances are there's a reason for that,” Hultin said. “It's more the occupations that are licensed in one or two states that people tend to question a little bit more.”\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures plans to publish a final report on the project by December 2019.\n\nA 2017 NCSL report states that about 25 percent of people employed in the U.S. have job licenses, up from about 5 percent in the 1950s, and state rules frustrate people who want to work and increase costs. The authors noted a few actions by state leaders.\n\nIn 2016, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed a law that eliminated licenses for a variety of jobs including citrus fruit packer and yoga instructor, the report states. The same year, the Georgia and Illinois governments directed state agencies to let people with criminal records work in licensed jobs when their convictions are unrelated to the work.\n\nPenrod of the AAVSB said that, in 2018, legislators in at least 15 states introduced legislation that would revise professional licensing rules. His organization has tried to help member boards teach legislators why licensing requirements are important in the veterinary profession.\n\nPenrod said legislatures seldom remove license requirements, and he thinks it's unlikely to happen to veterinary technicians in those states where licenses are required. But he has heard rhetoric from elected officials who want to reduce licensing requirements.\n\nSome jobs targeted in the past decade by governors and legislators include talent agent, hair braider, potato shipper, motor vehicle salesperson, ballroom dance instructor, and animal masseuse, according to bill text, announcements, and a 2012 report from the Institute of Justice.\n\nDRIVING FOR LICENSES\n\nIn a Sept. 24 report from the FTC Economic Liberty Task Force, the authors urge policymakers to reduce or eliminate licensing mandates that erect barriers and increase prices without improving quality or protecting public health and safety.\n\n“There is little justification for the burdensome, costly, and redundant licensing processes that many states impose on qualified, licensed, out-of-state applicants,” the report states. “Such requirements likely inhibit multistate practice and delay or even prevent licensees from working in their occupations upon relocation to a new state.”\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is giving professional licensing boards money to develop licensing compacts in the health professions, the report states. For example, 24 states and one U.S. territory are participating in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which expedites physician licensing.\n\nEarlier this year, the AVMA, AAVSB, Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, and National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America signed a joint statement that the licensing of veterinarians and veterinary technicians protects the health, safety, and well-being of people and animals and ensures those working in veterinary medicine are competent, up to date on training, and working in clinics that meet standards.\n\n“Public protection through licensure is equally essential for fields where public health may be impacted,” the organizations said. “Veterinary professionals play a key role in disease prevention, identification and treatment of zoonotic diseases, ensuring the safety of food and feed, dog bite injury prevention, animal control, and ensuring the functional health of working animals, such as service dogs.”\n\nThe statement also argues that, rather than licensing preventing competition and imposing unnecessary costs, some research indicates licensing increases the supply of qualified workers and access to professions.\n\nAVMA Deputy CEO Adrian Hochstadt said the organizations wrote the statement when the AAVSB raised concerns that licensing was under attack. Lawmakers have proposed not only removing licensing for some professions but also imposing review cycles for all occupational licenses.\n\nLeaders of the groups see veterinary technician licensing as more vulnerable than veterinarian licensing, he said.\n\nFTC information notes efforts since 2011 to review job licensing in several states, such as a 2011–12 review in Michigan of which occupations should remain licensed and proposals since 2016 in Delaware and Wisconsin to review which job licenses are in the public interest.\n\nIn July 2017, House and Senate Republicans introduced bills to give licensing boards immunity from antitrust laws if they develop systems to review their regulations and, when considering adding license requirements, study less-restrictive alternatives. Neither bill has received any votes.\n\nHochstadt said the AVMA is learning from and supporting partners in veterinary medicine. The AVMA is preparing in case legislators challenge license requirements next year.\n\nThe joint statement notes that NAVTA leaders have been working to standardize veterinary technician credentials. Mary Berg, immediate past president for NAVTA, said license portability is among the concerns her organization is trying to address through the Veterinary Nurse Initiative, which involves standardizing professional credentials and adoption of the title of veterinary nurse.\n\nBerg said she and other NAVTA leaders had heard concerns that states could consider removing veterinary technician licensing requirements, and she sees reason for concern.\n\nVeterinary technicians need to be licensed or registered in 37 states, according to lists from NAVTA and the NCSL, but there are about a dozen where credentialing isn't mandatory.\n\nThe AAVSB has distributed a document that describes the health care procedures performed by veterinary technicians with little to no supervision and the ways technicians reduce potential harms to patients, clinics, veterinary professions, and the public.\n\nPenrod said legislators could help protect the public by introducing bills where veterinary technicians are not licensed. But he said his organization and its members are educators, and it is up to other parts of the veterinary profession to advocate.\n\nTEXAS VET FIGHTS IN-PERSON EXAM REQUIREMENT, AGAIN\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nA veterinarian in Texas is challenging, for the second time, state rules against giving medical advice without first performing an in-person examination.\n\nDr. Ronald S. Hines gave pet owners medical advice by phone, video call, and email until 2012. The Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners told him that was illegal because the state requires a physical examination of patients, and he sued in 2013.\n\nAppellate court justices ruled against Dr. Hines in 2015, finding that the board has authority to regulate his advice to pet owners as professional conduct, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case. In October 2018, he filed a second complaint, arguing that a June 2018 Supreme Court ruling in a separate case will change the outcome for him.\n\nIn National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, a five-justice majority ruled in favor of anti-abortion organizations that challenged a California law that required disclosures to women who came to their pregnancy services clinics. The majority ruled that the law was unduly burdensome in requiring that clinic staff tell women about free or low-cost state services, including abortions, and notify women if the clinics lack licensing to provide medical services.\n\nAndrew Ward, one of Dr. Hines' attorneys through the Institute for Justice, said appellate courts ruled before that professional speech was subject to different rules than most other speech, but he said the Supreme Court ruling indicates speech by professionals retains constitutional protections. He argues that Texas lacks sufficient reason to prohibit Dr. Hines' speech related to medical advice.\n\nCiting current technology, research, and state and federal regulations, the AVMA advises that veterinary telemedicine—medicine conducted at a distance—should follow an in-person examination to establish a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, with the exception of emergencies.\n\nMichelle Griffin, general counsel for the TBVME, said she and others with the board could not comment on the pending litigation.\n\nIn his complaint filed in the Southern District of Texas, Dr. Hines says he wrote about 400 articles about pet health and care and published them on his website, www.2ndchance.info. Pet owners sought his help, and he asked for medical records or referred people to veterinarians when records were unavailable.\n\nThe complaint also describes consultations for people who wanted second opinions, were unable to find local veterinarians, or needed help finding inexpensive care.\n\nDr. Hines said he expects no personal benefits from the lawsuit. He is 75 years old, with limited mobility from a spinal injury endured 40 years ago, he said.\n\nBut younger veterinarians could offer excellent remote services, he said.\n\nMind the pay gaps\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nWage gaps among various groups of veterinarians are best thought of as a Rubik's Cube, according to Clinton L. Neill, PhD—there are a lot of factors and moving parts involved in identifying and solving the gaps.\n\nThe gender pay gap has received the most attention because women comprise a majority of the profession. But other gaps exist. For example, male or female, veterinarians who are parents make less money than veterinarians who are not. And, although minority groups likely also experience pay gaps, data are lacking.\n\nSpeaking at the 2018 AVMA Economic Summit, Oct. 22–23 in Rosemont, Illinois, Dr. Neill said it appears the gender wage gap is relatively small among new veterinarians. For 2018, men who had accepted full-time employment (excluding those in internships and residencies) had a mean starting salary of $85,000, compared with $82,000 for women. That gap in nominal starting salaries by gender has closed in recent years, from 9 percent in 2012 to 3 percent in 2018.\n\nHowever, the gender pay gap grows over time and is most prominent among veterinarians with incomes over $100,000 across all practice types. There is a 2 to 20 percent disparity, depending on experience level, between men and woman in the upper income brackets. One contributing factor may be that 46.5 percent of those in the upper income range are practice owners, and 59 percent of practice owners are male in this income range.\n\n“We see that females do make less than their male counterparts,” Dr. Neill said. “What is even more interesting is that … those that do have children, whether male or female, see lower incomes on the average.“\n\nDr. Neill, an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, is currently identifying factors related to earning potential for the AVMA.\n\nThere may still be unconscious biases within the hiring process, Dr. Neill said. During his research, he brought together six veterinarians and one practice manager for a focus group in the Atlanta area. A key takeaway from that meeting was that veterinarians with young children are likely to receive lower incomes.\n\n“What they're expecting from new hires is for them to be working full time and for that to continue in the long run,” Dr. Neill said. “They don't want somebody that is not going to be there. … Across male and female, these hiring managers brought up that (they) don't want a young vet that has young children, because (they know) their children come first. They perceive that as taking time away from the practice.”\n\nEfforts to close the gender pay gap among veterinarians have included presentations by the AVMA, including talks for Student AVMA members on negotiating salaries.\n\n“As part of our student outreach efforts, the AVMA Student Initiatives Team has been offering one-hour lunch talk presentations on negotiations for over a year to our SAVMA chapters,” said Dr. Caroline Cantner, assistant director for student initiatives in the AVMA Division of Membership and Field Services. “Student AVMA chapters have the opportunity to select this presentation topic for their annual AVMA on-campus meeting, and the presentations have been well-received by Student AVMA members. … We look forward to continuing to provide education around this important topic to veterinary students.”\n\nOther organizations have been involved in efforts to close the gender pay gap, such as the Women's Veterinary Leadership Development Initiative, which has given presentations to inform women about how to look for alternative career opportunities, better network with colleagues, and gain leadership skills.\n\n“Increasing women in leadership roles in our profession will provide valuable role models for women and encourage discussion regarding the wage gap and steps that can be taken to address it,” said Dr. Bridget Heilsberg, president of the WVLDI. “It will only be corrected with consistent messaging over time—and empowering women to ask for higher salaries commensurate with skill and experience, regardless of gender.”\n\nThe gender wage gap is not specific to veterinary medicine. Women across the U.S. earned about 82 percent of what men earned in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings for part- and full-time workers over the age of 16.\n\nHowever, while women may be paid less than their male counterparts, minorities across all industries are paid even less on average. In the U.S., black men made $710 and black women made $657 in median weekly earnings in 2017, while white men made $971 and white women made $795, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn veterinary medicine, some experts report not having enough responses within data sets to make conclusions about pay gaps for minority groups within the profession because of the small number of ethnic minorities working in the veterinary industry. According to the 2017 BLS report “Labor Force Characteristics by Race and Ethnicity,” about 92 percent of the veterinarians in the U.S. are white.\n\n“Small size does not mean you can't get rich data,” said Dr. Michael Bailey, a member of the AVMA Board of Directors and a veterinary radiologist, who is black. “The information is not there because of a lack of academic rigor.”\n\nDr. Bailey noted that it is possible to measure small groups and said not measuring them is “intellectual dishonesty.”\n\nVeterinary medicine is one of the whitest professions in the nation even as the overall U.S. and global population continues to become more diverse, which raises concerns for Dr. Bailey and should raise concerns for the profession, he said.\n\n“I am representing my profession, but I want my profession to represent me,” Dr. Bailey said.\n\nThere have been some efforts to create diversity within the profession. The Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges created its DiVersity Matters initiative more than a decade ago, seeking to increase diversity at U.S. veterinary colleges. More recently, Tuskegee University School of Veterinary Medicine, a historically black university, received a $7.1 million federal grant in 2015 to supports its efforts to recruit and train a varied population of veterinary students.\n\nMarket for veterinarians still going strong\n\nStory and photo by R. Scott Nolen\n\nThe market for veterinarians remains robust for a third straight year, according to Charlotte Hansen, a statistical analyst with the AVMA Veterinary Economics Division.\n\nAll indicators for the veterinary labor market are favorable, said Hansen, who presented on the second day of the 2018 AVMA Economic Summit, held Oct. 22–23 in Rosemont, Illinois. “We see increases in (veterinary) salaries, veterinary unemployment is below the national level, … and we have more jobs than there are applicants applying for those positions,” she explained.\n\n“We have negative underemployment, where there are more veterinarians wanting to work fewer hours for less compensation than there are veterinarians wanting to work more hours for more compensation,” said Hansen, adding that well-being in the profession is generally good.\n\nPrior to Hansen's presentation, Frederic Ouedraogo, PhD, highlighted the growing demand for specialty and emergency and critical care veterinary services. Demand for production animal and wildlife veterinary services is beginning to decline, however. Dr. Ouedraogo, an assistant director in the AVMA's economic division, described the market for veterinary services as consolidating and trending toward larger practices.\n\nExcess capacity remains a substantial challenge for veterinary practices, he said. Excess capacity describes a practice that, for a number of reasons, including failure to fully use examination rooms or veterinary technicians, is producing less than it potentially could. Just over half of all private veterinary practices are characterized by excess capacity, explained Dr. Ouedraogo.\n\nIn her presentation, Hansen talked about the net present value of a veterinary degree compared with a bachelor's degree, with net present value representing the present value of the costs and benefits associated with earning a degree. Overall, both men and women earn more with a veterinary degree than those who only obtain a bachelor's degree.\n\n“Female veterinarians, on average, earn $600,000 in today's dollars over their lifetime more than they would have had they stopped at a bachelor's degree, while men with a DVM, on average, earn around $200,000 more than if they had just taken a bachelor's degree,” Hansen said.\n\nStarting salaries for male and female veterinarians continue to climb, said Hansen (see page 1500).\n\nWhile the national unemployment rate in October was 3.7 percent, only 1.6 percent of surveyed veterinarians reported they were actively seeking work, according to Hansen. In addition, Hansen said more than 6,200 full-time-equivalent veterinarians are needed to satisfy the work hour preferences reported by practitioners.\n\nAccording to data from the AVMA Veterinary Career Center, the number of job openings for the past year has outpaced the number of applicants. “This is good for veterinarians seeking jobs, but less so for owners of veterinary businesses and consumers of veterinary services,” said Hansen.\n\nThe final market indicator the AVMA looked at was well-being. As Hansen explained, the AVMA used the Professional Quality of Life Tool to measure well-being among some 4,000 veterinarians in the following areas: compassion satisfaction—that is, the pleasure derived from work—burnout, and secondary managed stress, which includes fear and work-related trauma.\n\n“Overall, veterinarians are in the average range across all professions for well-being,” she noted.\n\nSalaries, debt for new graduates continue to increase\n\nBy Malinda Larkin\n\nThe latest figures on salaries and debt for the Class of 2018 show increases in both categories.\n\nIn 2014 dollars, the real mean debt of all 2018 graduates from U.S. veterinary colleges, including those without debt, was $143,111, an increase from $133,086 in 2017 and $138,151 in 2016.\n\nAmong 2018 graduates with debt, about 35 percent had borrowed $10,000 to $40,000 more than the total cost of education plus interest. Twenty-one percent had borrowed $50,000 to $90,000 above that level, and strikingly 44 percent had borrowed $100,000 or more over the cost of attendance plus interest.\n\nThe information was presented by Charlotte Hansen, statistical analyst in the AVMA Veterinary Economics Division, during a talk on the “Supply of Educational Services” at the 2018 AVMA Economic Summit, held Oct. 22–23 in Rosemont, Illinois.\n\nGOING UP\n\nSalaries among graduates also continue to increase. In 2014 dollars, real mean starting salary for 2018 U.S. graduates finding full-time employment prior to graduation (weighted to account for changes in gender, practice type, and region) was $76,633, up from $73,626 in 2017 and $72,187 in 2016. Household incomes have risen, so there's more spending on veterinary services, which has resulted in the increase in starting salaries, Hansen said.\n\nThe overall debt-to-income ratio among 2018 graduates was 2.26:1, up from 1.85:1 last year. Hansen added that the inclusion in the data set of the two new veterinary colleges at Midwestern University and Lincoln Memorial University (see pages 1508 and 1510) contributed the most to the sharp increase.\n\nNotably, the DIR for graduates of the Caribbean veterinary colleges at Ross University and St. George's University, which have high populations of students from the U.S., differed from the DIR for their colleagues who attended U.S. institutions. However, there was only a 35 to 40 percent response rate from the Caribbean institutions, compared with a 90 percent response rate for the U.S. colleges.\n\nThough the starting salaries hardly differed between U.S. and Caribbean veterinary graduates in 2018, the mean debt for Caribbean veterinary graduates was nearly double that of U.S. graduates—$260,388 in 2018 and $253,734 in 2017. That meant the DIR of new veterinary graduates from Ross and St. George's was 3.37:1 this year. Notably, more than 50 percent of these graduates had a DIR of 4:1 or more. Also, the AVMA mean debt figures include all graduates, even those with zero debt. The mean debt levels of only those graduates with any amount of debt would be much higher.\n\nMuch of the information came from the AVMA Senior Survey, conducted each spring among the graduating students of U.S. veterinary colleges accredited by the AVMA Council on Education. The document takes an in-depth look at new-veterinarian incomes, educational debt load, and debt-to-income ratio, among other things.\n\nThe 2018 Veterinary Economic Reports are available at https://jav.ma/2018econreports.\n\nREPAYMENT STRATEGIES\n\nThe VIN Foundation's student debt expert, Dr. Tony Bartels, spoke at the summit about what students and veterinarians can do to better manage their loan debt. He says a majority of borrowers now have a debt-to-income ratio much greater than 1:1, which does not lend itself to traditional repayment methods that involve borrowers trying to pay back the money as fast as they can. Instead, he recommends veterinarians consider income-driven repayment programs, which set a monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable on the basis of income and family size.\n\nFor example, with the Pay As You Earn program, borrowers pay 10 percent of their discretionary income each month. After making 240 monthly payments on qualifying direct loans, any remaining balance is forgiven. Because the forgiven amount is treated as taxable income, Dr. Bartels said, “You just have to plan for the tax at the end, and you can even do that as you're paying off the loan. Put money into an account where you can earn a return on your forgiveness savings.”\n\nThe VIN Foundation Student Debt Center has a Student Loan Repayment Simulator that helps students and recent graduates figure out the best way to pay off their loans. It is available at www.vinfoundation.com/studentdebtcenter.\n\n“If you pick the right repayment plan sooner than later, this can save you tens of thousands of dollars in the course of repaying,” Dr. Bartels said.\n\nHe also made the following recommendations for veterinary students to consider:\n\n• Don't pay interest while in school.\n\n• Reduce award amounts or return any money borrowed that was not used, which can also decrease the interest and fees associated with borrowing.\n\n• No more than 10 to 15 percent of your income should go toward repaying student loans.\n\n• If doing an internship or residency, don't defer loans, but start an income-driven repayment program to avoid further capitalization of interest.\n\n• Avoid using retirement savings to pay off student loans.\n\nMatthew Salois, PhD, director of the AVMA Veterinary Economics Division, emphasized that educational debt is not an issue for the veterinary profession alone, but a bigger and more complicated societal issue. For context, he said veterinary educational debt accounts for $400 to $500 million compared with the overall $1.5 trillion in educational loan debt in 2018, according to the Federal Reserve. Educational debt is now the second-highest category of consumer debt—behind only mortgage debt—and higher than debt from both credit cards and car loans.\n\n“We often talk about debt in the confines of the veterinary profession, but there is not something inherently wrong with veterinary education; it extends nationally across all disciplines,” he said. “There are things we can do as a veterinary profession to address this, but because it's part of a complicated issue, we have to look beyond the profession in order for it to be addressed.”\n\nMIDWESTERN RECEIVES ACCREDITATION ANSWER FROM COE\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nA gathering of students and staff at Midwestern University College of Veterinary Medicine in Glendale, Arizona, erupted with cheers as the news was announced that the veterinary college had become the 29th U.S. institution to receive full accreditation from the AVMA Council on Education.\n\n“It is an incredibly good feeling. It's a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it should be difficult, as far as I am concerned,” said Dr. Thomas K. Graves, dean of the veterinary college. “It was a true team effort here, and that makes it really rewarding.”\n\nThe decision came down during the COE's Sept. 23–25 meeting at AVMA headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois.\n\nMidwestern University, a private, nonprofit institution specializing in health care education, announced in March 2012 that it would create Arizona's only veterinary school at its 144-acre central Arizona campus. In 2013, the program received a letter of reasonable assurance of accreditation after a COE site team conducted a consultative site visit in January of that year.\n\nReasonable assurance is not a pre-accreditation action by the AVMA COE. Rather, for a new institution seeking initial accreditation, such a letter indicates there is reasonable assurance of future accreditation if the program is established according to plans presented to the COE and if the institution is able to demonstrate a realistic plan to comply with the standards of accreditation.\n\nThen, from April 22-May 3 this year, the council sent a site team to do a comprehensive site visit, which informed the COE's decision at its most recent meeting. The council makes accreditation decisions based on its 11 standards, which include such categories as finances, physical facilities, clinical resources, and curriculum.\n\nThe status of full accreditation is granted for a period of up to seven years when a veterinary college has no deficiencies in the standards. Veterinary colleges submit annual reports to the COE to demonstrate their continued compliance.\n\nMidwestern has spent about five years working towards this status, but the veterinary college isn't done yet, Dr. Graves said.\n\n“We've identified challenges, things that we need to celebrate, and things that we need to do better,” he said. “This is just a jumping-off point for us to continue to grow in terms of the quality of our program.”\n\nFull accreditation means that members of Midwestern's 2018 graduating class, its first, will retroactively be identified as having received their diplomas from a COE-accredited school.\n\nMidwestern has seen an increase in the number of applicants over the past five years from about 500 to 1,200 annually. Dr. Graves anticipates that number will continue to grow.\n\n“There is a level of comfort, I think, that students have knowing that a program is fully accredited. It will take a while for the applicant pool to realize that, but I think it will increase the number of applicants that we have,” Dr. Graves said.\n\nThe inaugural Class of 2018 comprised 90 veterinary students after matriculating 102. Over a quarter of the graduating class will be taking positions in rural areas across the nation, and 23 percent of the graduates will be remaining in Arizona to practice, according to a university press release.\n\nTotal four-year tuition for the class was $270,014—the highest among all U.S. veterinary colleges, according to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges' Cost Comparison Tool.\n\nMidwestern's veterinary college expects its Class of 2023 to number about 110 to 120 students.\n\nLMU STILL WORKING TOWARD FULL ACCREDITATION\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson and Malinda Larkin\n\nLincoln Memorial University College of Veterinary Medicine in Harrogate, Tennessee, will continue its provisional accreditation status. The veterinary college was working toward potentially receiving full accreditation from the AVMA Council on Education as early as this fall. The decision is based on a comprehensive site visit from March 25–29 and came during the COE's Sept. 23–25 meeting at AVMA headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois.\n\nThe council did not release any further information, and the veterinary college declined to comment at this time on the COE decision.\n\nLincoln Memorial is a nonprofit, private, liberal arts institution that sits on a 1,000-acre wooded campus where Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia meet at the Cumberland Gap. The veterinary college is located on LMU's main campus with additional academic facilities in nearby Lee County, Virginia. The program has developed a hybrid distributive model for clinical education in which students may choose from 150 affiliates in their fourth year while also receiving hands-on experience at its DeBusk Veterinary Teaching Center from the first semester onward.\n\nThe veterinary college is in the process of completing a dedicated building for the program. It is three stories high, covers over 85,000 square feet of space, and is due to be finished in January. The facility will include two large lecture halls that can be combined to accommodate over 500 people, 24 communications laboratories, simulation laboratories, basic and clinical sciences classrooms, numerous study rooms, student break areas, student and academic services offices, clinical relations offices, and the deans' suite, according to a university press release. The building will also provide research space, including a home for the Center for Animal and Human Health in Appalachia.\n\nLMU conducted a feasibility study in 2010 and asked for a consultative site visit from the COE in 2011; the visit to its veterinary college was conducted Oct. 23–27 that year. Lincoln Memorial filed a letter of application with the COE in 2012 seeking a letter of reasonable assurance of accreditation, and a site team traveled to Harrogate for a comprehensive site visit from Jan. 26–30, 2013. The veterinary college received a letter of reasonable assurance in July 2013, and the first class matriculated in the fall of 2014.\n\nAppalachian students made up a quarter of the veterinary college's inaugural class, and four years later, 27 percent of the Class of 2018 is living and working in Appalachia, according to a university press release. Overall, the graduates reside in 24 states, and 34 percent of the graduates are working in large animal or mixed animal practices.\n\nWhen a student graduates from a veterinary college that is operating under any classification of COE accreditation, the student is considered a graduate of an accredited school for purposes of licensing examinations or other certification that requires graduation from a COE-accredited institution as a prerequisite, according to the council's FAQ.\n\nDifferent classifications of accreditation, however, do exist and reflect the institution's compliance with the standards of accreditation.\n\nProvisional accreditation means LMU must file reports at six-month intervals to demonstrate its progress. Provisional accreditation may remain in effect for no more than five years, which will be fall 2019 for Lincoln Memorial. If the program has the status for a longer period or does not provide evidence that its program will comply, it will be placed on terminal accreditation. More information on the COE's accreditation classifications is available at https://jav.ma/COEclassifications.\n\nLincoln Memorial is one of 30 COE-accredited veterinary colleges in the U.S. and 19 in Canada and other countries.\n\nOther COE actions from its fall meeting are as follows:\n\n• University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine received continued probationary accreditation with minor deficiencies. Probationary accreditation is granted to a veterinary college that has one or more major deficiencies that have more than a minimal impact on student learning and safety. The COE reviewed the veterinary school's progress and found that it was lacking in Standard 3 (Physical Facilities and Equipment). The deficiency must be corrected within one year. The veterinary school must also submit reports to the COE every six months.\n\n• Oklahoma State University Center for Veterinary Health Sciences continued its probationary accreditation with major deficiencies. The center received this status from the COE because of several minor and major deficiencies in the required standards including Standard 2 (Finances), Standard 6 (Students), Standard 8 (Faculty), Standard 3 (Physical Facilities and Equipment), Standard 9 (Curriculum), and Standard 11 (Outcomes Assessment).\n\n• National Autonomous University of Mexico School of Veterinary Medicine will continue its probationary accreditation because of a major deficiency in Standard 3 (Physical Facilities and Equipment). The COE determined its status during a site visit in spring 2018. The veterinary college has two years to correct the problem.\n\n• Ross University College of Veterinary Medicine will continue its probationary accreditation with a major deficiency in Standard 11 (Outcomes Assessment). The veterinary college received this evaluation on the basis of a site visit in spring 2018. Ross University would not comment on the COE decision.\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REVIEW OF AVMA COUNCIL ON EDUCATION UNDERWAY\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education's National Advisory Committee for Institutional Quality and Integrity has begun its periodic review of the AVMA Council on Education, the official accrediting agency for veterinary colleges.\n\nNACIQI's main job is to vote to recommend to the education secretary whether the accrediting agencies it reviews, such as the COE, deserve the department's recognition. The Department of Education then determines whether to recognize those agencies as qualified to evaluate the education and training provided by higher education programs and to provide accreditation or pre-accreditation when appropriate.\n\nRecognition must be renewed every five years.\n\nAt the start of the 2012 renewal process, department staff identified issues that needed to be addressed by the COE. The council retained its recognition as an accreditor while addressing those issues, which included concerns about alleged conflicts of interest, education standards, communication, and acceptance of the council among educators and veterinarians.\n\nThe COE went before NACIQI again in 2014, and, on the basis of a USDE staff report, the advisory committee told the council it must continue working on these issues.\n\nIn response to input from the public and members of the veterinary community, the COE has made substantial changes in its policies and procedures in recent years. These include changes to how COE members are appointed and supported by the AVMA and the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, as well as how site visits are conducted. Changes in accreditation standards, such as those pertaining to diversity, student wellness, and financial and debt management, have also been made by the COE in recent years. Plus, the council held a number of listening sessions at veterinary conferences.\n\nIn 2016, NACIQI recommended that the COE retain federal recognition at least through December 2017, which the USDE secretary approved. The five-year recognition renewal cycle restarted in 2018. The comment period ended Sept. 30.\n\nA public hearing during which interested individuals will have an opportunity to provide oral comments will be held on Feb. 5, 2019, in the Washington, D.C., area. Additional information about registering for that event is available in the Sept. 4 Federal Register at https://jav.ma/NACIQIcomments.\n\nEFFORTS TO MAKE WORKPLACES, HOUSING MORE PET-FRIENDLY TAKE ROOT\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nThe Pet Leadership Council, in partnership with Mars Petcare and the Human Animal Bond Research Institute, is leading a pilot program to make workspaces and housing more pet-friendly in Austin, Texas, and Columbus, Ohio.\n\n“We think these are two things a city can do that would be significant for the health of the community, good for pets, good for pet owners, and ultimately good for veterinarians,” said Mark Cushing, CEO and founder of the Animal Policy Group and leader of the pilot program.\n\nThe efforts are mostly volunteer-run and use the playbook of Mars Petcare's Better Cities for Pets program. The guide has been in the works since 2012 and was published earlier this year. Available at https://jav.ma/playbook, it covers 12 specific traits of pet-friendly cities and how to achieve them.\n\n“Both (Austin and Columbus) view themselves as pet-friendly … but developers and apartment owners haven't necessarily caught up with the preferences of folks in their cities,” Cushing said. “We are putting together a list of targets (developers and companies) in both cities, and will create a lot of one-on-one engagement using Mars Petcare's Better Cities for Pets tools. … It's an effort to get the conversations going and have people talk, address concerns, and see if we can't get developers and companies in each city to say they will try it. It's an intentional effort, but low-key.”\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Animal Policy Group in 25 markets, Austin and Columbus have low percentages of pet-friendly housing available, 28 percent and 38 percent respectively.\n\nAt year-end 2016, 57 percent of all U.S. households owned a pet, according to the 2017–18 edition of the AVMA Pet Ownership and Demographics Sourcebook.\n\n“(And yet) there are so many barriers for people with pets,” said Angel May, corporate citizenship lead at Mars Petcare.\n\nEven though research has shown that pets make people happier and healthier, May said, there are still issues with where pets are allowed, so the goal of the Better Cities for Pets model and playbook was to understand the issues and create a foundation to drive change.\n\nFor example, many apartments across the U.S. have breed and size restrictions for pets in rental agreements. The Better Cities for Pets guide outlines this specific issue and then offers possible strategies such as evaluating each pet individually rather than having such restrictions.\n\n“Judge (the animal) for its energy, not how it looks,” May said. “We don't want people to be judged by how they look. It is the same for dogs. They are individual. They do have breed characteristics, but not every dog is the same.”\n\nMay said the pilot program in Austin and Columbus will allow the partner organizations to test the solutions that the Better Cities for Pets program has developed, better understand what the two cities are currently doing, and advocate for more pet-friendly solutions.\n\nAAHA ISSUES GUIDELINES ON INFECTION CONTROL\n\nHospital-acquired infections are an ongoing battle for health care facilities in both human and veterinary medicine. The American Animal Hospital Association has released the first AAHA Infection Control, Prevention, and Biosecurity Guidelines to provide ways for veterinary professionals to tackle this problem and prevent the spread of disease in veterinary practices.\n\nAccording to the abstract: “A veterinary team's best work can be undone by a breach in infection control, prevention, and biosecurity (ICPB). Such a breach, in the practice or home-care setting, can lead to medical, social, and financial impacts on patients, clients, and staff, as well as damage the reputation of the hospital. To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout the hospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice.”\n\nThe guidelines offer standard operating procedures to guide the veterinary team in creating a clean and safe environment. Among the procedures are cleaning and disinfection, hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, identifying high-risk patients, and managing contagious patients in isolation.\n\nThe guidelines also include a staff training video to help team members achieve a safe environment, personalized checklists of tasks to improve compliance, evaluation tools to ensure success, staff and client educational materials, and a process for designating team members to become infection control practitioners.\n\nDr. Jason W. Stull, an assistant professor at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, chaired the task force that prepared the guidelines. In a Nov. 7 AAHA announcement, he said: “We have approached this area from the perspective of the busy veterinary team member, often with little background in infection control, and distilled the key practices with greatest potential for success into a succinct ‘how-to manual.’ With these guidelines, every practice can have an infection control program of which they can be proud and that will protect patient, owner, and personnel health.”\n\nThe guidelines are available in the November/December issue of the Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association or online at www.aaha.org/biosecurity.\n\nAAFP RELEASES CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON HOW TO FEED A CAT\n\nFeeding a cat may seem like a straightforward activity, but according to feline veterinarians, it is an often-overlooked aspect of cat health.\n\nOn Oct. 30, the American Association of Feline Practitioners released the consensus statement “Feline Feeding Programs: Addressing Behavioral Needs to Improve Feline Health and Wellbeing” and an accompanying client brochure.\n\nThe consensus statement, published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery (J Feline Med Surg 2018;20:1049–1055), explores the medical, social, and emotional problems that can result from the manner in which most cats are currently fed. The statement identifies normal feeding behaviors in cats. It provides strategies to allow these normal feline feeding behaviors, ranging from hunting and foraging to eating frequent small meals in a solitary fashion, to occur in the home environment—even in a multiple-pet home. Allowing cats to exhibit these normal feeding behaviors regularly can help alleviate or prevent stress-related issues such as cystitis and obesity-related problems such as inactivity and overeating. Reducing stress with appropriate feeding programs can also help anxious cats that, in an attempt to avoid other pets in the household, may not access food frequently enough and lose weight.\n\n“Currently, most pet cats are fed in one location ad libitum, or receive one or two large and usually quite palatable meals daily. In addition, many indoor cats have little environmental stimulation, and eating can become an activity in and of itself,” said Dr. Tammy Sadek, chair of the panel that developed the consensus statement, in an AAFP announcement. “This current type of feeding process does not address the behavioral needs of cats. Appropriate feeding programs need to be customized for each household, and should incorporate the needs of all cats for play, predation, and a location to eat and drink where they feel safe.”\n\nThe consensus statement and client brochure offer strategies for cat caregivers to understand feeding preferences and provide the proper environment for feeding that makes cats happier and helps avoid overfeeding or underfeeding. The statement also highlights the importance of feeding programs, which should be designed to consider whether cats are indoor-only or have outdoor access, live in multiple-pet households, or are aged or debilitated. Feeding programs can include offering frequent small meals using appropriate puzzle feeders, forage feeding by putting food in different locations, and multiple food and water stations—and may include automatic feeders in some instances. According to the AAFP, veterinary professionals and clients need to work together to develop and implement a safe, effective feeding program that optimizes each cat's physical and emotional health and well-being.\n\nThe AAFP encourages cat caregivers who are concerned with their cat's weight and health, who have multiple cats in the home, or who are concerned with overfeeding or underfeeding to seek guidance from their veterinarian. Additionally, appropriate nutrition and feeding programs should be discussed during the cat's routine check-up, according to the AAFP.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE LEADS GLOBAL AQUACULTURE PROJECT\n\nMississippi State University will lead a new $15 million federal initiative to reduce poverty and improve living standards for impoverished populations dependent on aquaculture-led economies, the university announced in October.\n\nU.S. Agency for International Development funding over the next five years will support the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Fish, led through the university's Global Center for Aquatic Food Security run by Dr. Mark Lawrence.\n\n“The overall goal of the FIL is conducting research that leads to real world impact. USAID expects much more than just published papers,” said Dr. Lawrence, associate dean and professor in MSU's College of Veterinary Medicine, in the press release. “True success will be measured by adoption of our findings and changes in practice, leading to an actual benefit to farmers, feed producers, and families.”\n\nThe laboratory is not a specific site, but rather, a mechanism through which academic, private, and public partners can identify solutions for global challenges.\n\nIt is one of 22 Feed the Future Innovation Labs. The others focus on different agricultural commodities or themes to improve human outcomes through research on agriculture, including the University of Florida's focus on livestock systems.\n\nFish are among the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. However, additional research is needed to understand how developing countries can maximize aquaculture and benefit their people. The new lab will work to fill in these gaps by studying ways of improving production, reducing and mitigating risk to fish production systems, and improving human outcomes, according to the release.\n\nProject activities will initially focus on regions deemed priority areas for aquaculture and fisheries development by FIL and USAID: West Africa, East Africa, and Asia. Initial work will take place at the local level to develop best practices that can be scaled to national and regional levels.\n\nThe Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish uses a “Leader with Associates” model, through which MSU will facilitate associate awards to research and development partners. The university will identify and manage a portfolio of investments for research and development activities that address both promising innovations and emerging challenges in aquaculture and fisheries through an integrated approach of blending multiple disciplines.\n\nUSDA WANTS BETTER TRACKING FOR LIVESTOCK\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nLivestock animals that cross state lines should have electronic identification, according to federal agriculture leaders.\n\nStates, industry, and the Department of Agriculture also should share data that can be used to identify and isolate animals sickened and exposed to dangerous pathogens, according to goals described this fall. Greg Ibach, USDA undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said in an announcement that meeting those goals would help keep animals healthy and valuable.\n\n“We have a responsibility to these producers and American agriculture as a whole to make animal disease traceability what it should be—a modern system that tracks animals from birth to slaughter using affordable technology that allows USDA to quickly trace sick and exposed animals to stop disease spread,” he said.\n\nThe USDA officials who plan to implement that system have yet to describe in detail how animal identification and tracking systems will change and how soon that will happen. Agency spokeswoman Joelle Hayden said in early November that the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service was developing plans, but none were ready for sharing.\n\nDr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive vice president of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said association leaders have talked for years with cattle industry partners about livestock tracking systems, although he has not talked with USDA officials about the latest proposal.\n\n“I can tell you that we believe having a robust traceability system in place is necessary to protect the health of the nation's cattle herd,” he said.\n\nThis is especially true during an outbreak of a foreign disease. He said the U.S. and India are the only major beef exporters who lack robust cattle tracking systems.\n\nAbout 700,000 farms and other operations have cattle raised for beef, Dr. Gingrich said. Farmers and ranchers send cattle from across the country to the central U.S. for finishing in feed yards, and the commingling and transportation involved present risks if one of them develops a contagious disease.\n\nBut Dr. Gingrich said any animal tracking system raises concerns about cost and privacy, especially if people can access program data through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nWith some exceptions, companies shipping livestock across state lines or U.S. borders already need individual or group identification for the animals, depending on the species.\n\nThe identification can be ear tags for ruminants, group documents for pigs, group documents or leg bands for poultry, and descriptions or images for horses. Some states accept hot-iron brands for cattle.\n\nThose requirements took effect in March 2013. USDA officials had pushed for more stringent tracking standards, with uniform electronic tracking, through a National Animal Identification System but abandoned much of the program in favor of state-based identification after livestock owners proved reluctant to participate.\n\nOnly one-third of livestock owners participated, despite $120 million spent by the USDA, a 2013 JAVMA News article states.\n\nThe goals described this year by Ibach include switching all animals to some type of electronic identification, although USDA will not mandate use of a specific tag technology, the announcement states. The department also would stop giving free metal ear tags, instead offering to share costs of electronic tags.\n\nAlthough the announcement says the USDA wants to improve data sharing, the types of data are unidentified.\n\nAGRICULTURE AGENCIES REORGANIZE, PLAN MOVES\n\nAgencies in the Department of Agriculture are consolidating and moving offices in reorganizations.\n\nUSDA administrators have been considering sites in 35 states as possible new homes for offices of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in an August announcement that he plans to select one or more sites for those offices by January 2019, and employees will leave the Washington, D.C., region by late 2019.\n\nThe move is intended to bring USDA offices closer to stakeholders, reduce employment costs and rent, and attract staff interested in agriculture, especially among people from land-grant universities.\n\nCurrent employees would be given opportunities to move with their jobs.\n\nVeterinary Services, part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, also consolidated import-export centers from six to four as well as district offices from six to four, effective Oct. 15. But the agency is keeping the same number of employees.\n\nIn a letter to stakeholders, Dr. Jack A. Shere, chief veterinary officer and deputy administrator of Veterinary Services, noted that Veterinary Services reorganized five years ago. Employees and agency partners, in government and industry, since have suggested further changes, and APHIS was adjusting in response.\n\n“We are simply consolidating expertise and shifting reporting structures so we can provide better customer service,” he said.\n\nUSDA Food Safety and Inspection Service officials also announced in October plans to reorganize their agency with a “business center” model promoted by the agriculture secretary. But that change would have no effects on job positions, grade levels, salaries, or work locations. Some responsibilities may shift, but daily work will remain the same, the announcement states.\n\nUSDA AWARDS $2.4 MILLION TO SUPPORT RURAL VETERINARY SERVICES\n\nThe Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture recently announced that it has awarded 14 grants through the Veterinary Services Grant Program to support rural veterinary services and relieve shortages of veterinarians in parts of the U.S.\n\nAmong the recipients, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners received its second grant to provide workshops on business management for recent veterinary graduates.\n\n“Veterinarians are trained to be analytical problem solvers and as a profession are caregivers,” said Dr. David Welch, project manager for the workshops. “Unfortunately, all too often they do not apply that same analytical effort and care to evaluate the profitability and sustainability of their practices.”\n\nThe AABP designed the workshops to address this situation. The new round of workshops will have an increased emphasis on human resources management.\n\nOverall, NIFA awarded $2.4 million in grants as follows:\n\nEDUCATION, EXTENSION, AND TRAINING\n\n• AABP, $238,270, “Manage your rural practice for success.”\n\n• University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, $94,385, “UA Cooperative Extension Service food animal medicine workshop series: Utilizing extension to provide continuing education for the expansion of veterinary services in shortage situations.”\n\n• University of Georgia, $243,500, “Veterinary microbiology residency program at the Tifton Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory.”\n\n• Iowa State University, $243,500, “Zoonotic disease prevention tools for rural veterinary practices.”\n\n• Michigan State University, $245,500, “Improving food-animal veterinary service shortage situations in rural bovine practice through recruitment and continuing education of early-career veterinarians.”\n\n• Pennsylvania State University, $243,500, “Poultry training for large and small animal veterinarians in Pennsylvania counties with a defined veterinarian shortage situation.”\n\n• Texas A&M University, $243,500, “Texas Panhandle and plains rural veterinary practice revitalization.”\n\nRURAL PRACTICE ENHANCEMENT\n\n• Bear Lake Animal Hospital LLC, Montpelier, Idaho, $122,000, “Rural practice expansion and growth of veterinary services to the under-served agricultural entities of Idaho in the Bear Lake and Caribou counties.”\n\n• Dutton Veterinary Services PLLC, Walton, New York, $122,000, “Dutton Veterinary Services NY-182.”\n\n• Southwest Veterinary Services, Espanola, New Mexico, $104,845, “The goal is to provide veterinary care to under-served, low income community, with a large percentage of food animals that are not receiving veterinary care.”\n\n• KN Veterinary Services PLLC, Clifton, Texas, $121,000, “Application to provide high quality in house, telehealth and mobile veterinary services to rural central Texas.”\n\n• Mountain Legacy Veterinary Services LLC, Gunnison, Colorado, $122,000, “To demonstrate our commitment to the ranching community while providing excellent veterinary care and customer service with the common goal of ranch sustainability in a rural mountain town.”\n\n• Stonehouse Veterinary Service LLC, Saint Clairsville, Ohio, $122,000, “OH182 enhancing the level of veterinary service in rural eastern Ohio.”\n\n• Uinta Veterinary Hospital, Fort Bridger, Wyoming, $121,000, “Uinta Veterinary Hospital type II shortage area grant proposal, ID code: WY 184.”\n\nProject details are available at https://jav.ma/VSGPeducation and https://jav.ma/VSGPpractice.\n\nThe heated topic of raw milk\n\nUnpasteurized milk has a devoted following despite safety concerns, varying legality\n\nBy Katie Burns\n\nWhat could be more wholesome than chocolate milk from an Amish farm?\n\nIn November 2015, the International Raw Milk Symposium in Anaheim, California, brought in unpasteurized chocolate milk from an Amish farm in Pennsylvania. The sale of raw milk is legal in California and Pennsylvania, but the interstate sale of raw milk is illegal. Authorities embargoed the chocolate milk and sent a sample to the Food and Drug Administration—turning up Listeria.\n\nAn investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments found that Listeria isolates from the milk seized at the symposium were related to isolates obtained from two people in 2014. One person in California had been hospitalized and the other, a cancer patient in Florida, had died.\n\nThe investigation revealed some of the risks of raw milk and some of the complexities of buyers' clubs, which can be so secretive as to involve drop points and burner phones for temporary use. The AVMA supports laws requiring pasteurization of all milk, but unpasteurized milk has a devoted following despite the safety concerns and varying legality among states.\n\nFor fans, raw milk is bucolic and natural. At All Grass Farms outside Chicago, cows and calves munch on a pasture of grass, clover, and blue-flowered chicory. Customers come to the farm store to buy various products, including raw milk at $6 per half-gallon.\n\nThe farm owner is a convert himself to unpasteurized milk, which many people believe to taste better and provide health benefits; he argues that people should be able to weigh the risks and benefits for themselves. Two speakers at AVMA Convention 2018 this past July in Denver also took a look at the heated topic.\n\nAVMA POLICY\n\nThe AVMA Board of Directors approved the latest revisions to the AVMA policy “Raw Milk” in November 2016 on a recommendation from the AVMA Food Safety Advisory Committee. According to background materials, the purpose of the revisions was “to strengthen the language and more clearly convey the AVMA's thinking regarding sale, distribution, and labeling of raw milk and raw milk products.”\n\nThe policy reads as follows:\n\n“The AVMA opposes the direct sale or distribution to the consumer of unpasteurized milk or other unpasteurized dairy products. In those states where the sale of such is allowed, those products should be labeled ‘Not Pasteurized and May Contain Organisms that cause Human Disease.’ Furthermore, the AVMA supports laws requiring pasteurization of all milk to be sold within a state and consumed as fluid milk or to be used in the manufacture of dairy products.\n\n“Healthy mammals can shed organisms in their milk that are pathogenic to human beings and may cause diseases such as brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, coxiellosis, cryptosporidiosis, listeriosis, salmonellosis, tuberculosis, and E coli O157:H7 infection. Secondly, pathogenic agents may be introduced during milk handling; therefore, only pasteurized milk and milk products should be sold.”\n\nALL GRASS FARMS\n\nCliff McConville, owner of All Grass Farms in Dundee, Illinois, worked in downtown Chicago for 20 years in the insurance business. He began farming on a small scale in 2011 when he started working from home. He kept chickens, pigs, and beef cattle on 8 1/2 acres. People who learned that he kept cattle asked if he sold raw milk.\n\nHe bought two Guernsey cows in 2012 to sell raw milk, and he had so much demand that he bought two more Guernsey cows a week later. He leased land in 2015 to establish All Grass Farms. The farm has about two dozen Guernsey cows at a time along with chickens, turkeys, pigs, and beef cattle as well as vegetable and herb gardens.\n\nMcConville thinks the growing demand for raw milk ties into the whole movement by consumers who want to know where and how food animals are raised, with concerns ranging from animal welfare to what the animals eat.\n\nBut state laws on raw milk are a patchwork. Some states prohibit the sale of raw milk. Other states allow retail sale, on-farm sales, herd shares, or sales of raw milk ostensibly as food for animals.\n\nWhen McConville started out, the Illinois government was developing regulations for raw milk, and he got involved. As of 2016, permit holders in Illinois may sell raw milk on the farm where the cows are located. The farm must pass an initial inspection, and milk samples must pass initial and ongoing testing. McConville said the keys are to make sure the cows are clean and healthy and the milking equipment is clean.\n\nMcConville developed a taste for raw milk, and now he drinks it every day. He said the breed and diet of his cows affect the flavor of his milk, but he also believes pasteurization affects the flavor of milk. Among health benefits, advocates believe raw milk can improve digestion and strengthen the immune system.\n\n“Clearly, it's a little bit riskier, just like if you're eating a raw vegetable versus a cooked vegetable or raw meat versus cooked meat,” McConville said. “It's a little riskier, but there's benefits to it.”\n\nMcConville pointed to a 2015 study and a 2011 study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: “Consumption of unprocessed cow's milk protects infants from common respiratory infections” (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2015;135:56–62) and “The protective effect of farm milk consumption on childhood asthma and atopy: the GABRIELA study” (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:766–773). He also pointed to a 2007 study in Clinical and Experimental Allergy, “Inverse association of farm milk consumption with asthma and allergy in rural and suburban populations across Europe” (Clin Exp Allergy 2007;37:661–70).\n\nIf farms can't provide raw milk legally, McConville continued, customers will buy it from somewhere illegally. In his mind, that's a bigger risk.\n\nWEIGHING THE EVIDENCE\n\nBuyers' clubs for raw milk may require members to sign a contract that can include agreeing not to talk to the government and not to share information outside the club—and agreeing that it is the member's responsibility if he or she develops an illness. Instead of raw milk-associated outbreaks occurring in single states, now they are more widely distributed, sometimes only detected by laboratory surveillance, said Dr. Megin Nichols, a CDC veterinarian, who presented “Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Interstate Shipment of Raw Milk” at AVMA Convention 2018.\n\nMore states have been allowing raw milk, too. The United States had 30 outbreaks linked to raw milk from 2007–09, increasing to 51 outbreaks from 2010–12. So why drink raw milk?\n\nAdvocates say raw milk is creamier, but creaminess relates to homogenization rather than pasteurization. Dr. Nichols said pasteurization does not substantially change lactose content. The 2011 study finding that consumption of raw milk was inversely associated with asthma and allergy was in rural areas, where the setting might have had an effect. The concentration of estrogenic hormones in milk has to do with the pregnancy status of the cow, not with pasteurization. The amount of vitamins and nutrients in pasteurized milk does not significantly differ from the amounts in raw milk.\n\nDr. Nichols said there is a misperception that the risk of infection and the outbreak rates for pasteurized and raw milk are similar or are lower for raw milk, but many more people drink pasteurized milk, so more outbreaks are associated with pasteurized milk. Current estimates are that 3.5 percent of the U.S. population drinks raw milk.\n\nNo scientific evidence supports the claim that the benefits of consuming raw milk outweigh the risks, Dr. Nichols said, noting, “We do need some additional studies, especially around biologic mechanisms that might reduce allergies.”\n\nIn the investigation that Dr. Nichols highlighted, the Listeria isolates from the ill people had indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and were highly related by whole genome sequencing to isolates from the sample of raw chocolate milk produced by the Amish farm in Pennsylvania. Dr. Nichols said the farm was part of a very complex online business, working with outside help, yet did not have a phone at all.\n\nOfficials eventually managed to talk with the farmer, explaining that there was an outbreak and could be ongoing contamination. The CDC issued an announcement about the outbreak in March 2016 and closed the investigation in December 2016 after no additional people were reported to be infected with the outbreak strain.\n\nFOOD-RICH NATION\n\nDr. Danelle Bickett-Weddle of the Iowa State University Center for Food Security and Public Health says it is becoming more common for people to think that pasteurization destroys the health benefits of milk.\n\nPasteurization does destroy some enzymes in milk, but the enzymes in milk do not contribute to digestion in the human stomach, Dr. Bickett-Weddle said during her presentation, “Raw Milk: It Doesn't Do a Body Good …,” at AVMA Convention 2018. She showed a slide with a list of pathogens that can be found in raw milk, and she showed a blank slide as a list of the pathogens associated with pasteurized milk—noting that pasteurized milk can be contaminated after pasteurization. The CDC estimates that raw milk is 150 times as likely to cause illness as pasteurized milk.\n\nOf the 81 raw milk-related outbreaks from 2007–12, 81 percent were from Campylobacter contamination. In 2017, two outbreaks were traced back to the Brucella abortus vaccine strain RB51.\n\n“We are a food-rich nation. We are allowed financially to make decisions that other countries would dream to do,” Dr. Bickett-Weddle said. “I try to have these conversations with people any chance I get about what the risks are. Some of them you'll never convince, even with the science.”\n\nSTILL PRACTICING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS\n\nBy R. Scott Nolen\n\nIn 1918, Daylight Saving Time was observed for the first time in the United States, Babe Ruth still played for the Boston Red Sox, and Germany signed an armistice agreement with the Allies, ending World War I.\n\nDr. Paul Wise was born that same year, on Sept. 5 to be exact. At age 100, he continues to practice veterinary medicine. On Fridays and Saturdays, Dr. Wise can be found at Evers Veterinary Clinic in Chico, California, running the low-cost vaccination clinic, a part-time position he's held since 1981.\n\nReached by phone at his home and asked to comment on his prodigious work ethic, Dr. Wise quipped, “Oh, for heaven's sakes. I guess all you have to do is live to a hundred and still be able to walk to be famous.”\n\nAfter growing up on a small farm in Hotchkiss, Colorado, Dr. Wise moved to Santa Ana, California, to study engineering at the junior college. While working nights and weekends at the local veterinary hospital, he realized that the life of an engineer wasn't for him. “I decided I liked what (the hospital owner) was doing better than what I was planning to do,” he explained.\n\nDr. Wise enrolled in Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, graduating in 1950. With his veterinary degree in hand, Dr. Wise returned to the Santa Ana hospital, no longer a kennel worker but an associate. And there he remained for seven years before opening his own practice, Grand Avenue Pet Hospital, also in Santa Ana.\n\nIn 1972, Dr. Wise retired and sold his practice to two veterinarians “fresh out of the Army.”\n\nIt turns out that retirement, like a career in engineering, wasn't in the cards for Dr. Wise. “I retired for one full year, and my wife (Lorraine) said, ‘I know I married you for better or for worse, but not for lunch every day.’ I took that as a clue she wanted me out of the house part of the time,” he recalled.\n\nDr. Wise followed the advice of his wife, now deceased, and found ways to keep himself busy. Then, in 1981, Dr. Hank Evers hired the “retired” veterinarian, now in his early 60s, to run the vaccination clinic at Evers Veterinary Clinic. The late Dr. Evers opened the Chico small animal hospital with his wife, Marilyn, a licensed veterinary technician. The practice has passed to his daughter, Dr. Susan Evers.\n\n“The agreement my father and I had was to always have a position for Dr. Wise as long as he wanted to work,” Dr. Susan Evers said. “Veterinary medicine is his passion, and working recharges him. His dedication, loyalty, and encouragement are priceless.\n\n“Since my father's death, I value Dr. Wise's advice even more. He is a sincere, kind person and a mentor to many. He is an adopted member of my personal and veterinary family and loved by everyone he comes in contact with.”\n\nFor anyone considering becoming a veterinarian, Dr. Wise offers a bit of wisdom gained from a career of 68 years and counting: “If you're not interested in a life where no two days are alike, then you'd better not go into veterinary medicine.”\n\nTEACHING, RESEARCH AWARDS CONFERRED\n\nThe following individuals are winners of the 2018 Zoetis Distinguished Veterinary Teacher Award and the Zoetis Award for Veterinary Research Excellence.
