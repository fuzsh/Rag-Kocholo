        "text": "Most people don't realize how long hockey dates back in Pittsburgh as it was the epicenter of amateur and semi/pro hockey from the late 1890's through the early 1900's in the United States. Most people think of Mario and Sid when it comes to Pittsburgh hockey but believe it or not, the steel city has been very involved in professional hockey dating back more than 100 years. Here are some good reads and highlights.\n\nPittsburgh Hockey History Timeline\n\n*Odie Cleghorn, who had won the Cup with them in 1924, left the Montreal Canadiens to coach the Pirates. In Pittsburgh, he gained hockey fame by becoming the first coach to make line changes “on the fly.” He even played goal briefly when Worters had pneumonia.\n\n*Pittsburgh’s first NHL game was Nov. 26, 1925 at Boston, a 2-1 victory. Two nights later, Pittsburgh beat the Canadiens, 1-0, at Mt. Royal Arena in a game of historical significance. It was the last for the great Georges Vezina, whose goaltending superiority led the league to name after him a year-end trophy honoring its best goaltender. Vezina left the game after the first period with a high fever and died four months later of tuberculosis.\n\n1900-10 Early Pro Hockey\n\n*By 1901-02 Pittsburgh had lured future Hall-of-Famers like Riley Hern and Alf Smith into their fold, along with some of the top players of the day like Bert Morrison, Lorne Campbell and Art Sixsmith as well.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania Hockey League - Wikipedia\n\n*In what might have been the first trade involving professional hockey players, the Pirates sent James MacKay, Edgar Dey and Dunc Taylor to the Bankers for Joseph Donnelly, Clint Bennest and a player named \"McGuire\" on January 28, 1908.[15][17]\n\n*The league lured players from Canada with promises of high-paid employment and small cash incentives, which was around $30 a week.[12] At this time all Canadian associations were still amateur, and since many of the players had been already expelled from hockey in Canada for being professionals.[13] However, according to Garnet Sixsmith, who played in the league between 1902–1910, the players were paid between $10–$15 a week and each were given jobs on the side. Each team, consisted of a manager who was paid a lump sum of money to have a team on the ice. The less money the manager had to pay his players, the more money that manager got to keep.[11] As a result, the Pittsburgh teams were able to get many great players such as future Hall of Famers Alf Smith, Hod Stuart and Riley Hern. These players played for pay in Pittsburgh, eventually forcing the Canadian leagues to go pro in 1907, a development that led directly to the formation of the National Hockey League in 1917.[14\n\nThe following players are members of the Hockey Hall of Fame:\n\nRiley Hern (1962, Keystones)\n\nAlf Smith (1962, Athletic Club/Bankers/Duquesne)\n\nTommy Smith (1973, Lyceum/Bankers)\n\nBruce Stuart (1961, Victorias)\n\nHod Stuart (1945, Bankers)\n\nCyclone Taylor (1947, Athletic Club)\n\n[TBODY] [/TBODY]\n\nDuquesne Gardens - Wikipedia\n\n*In 1895, Pittsburgh officials, constructed the Schenley Park Casino which featured the first artificial ice-making plant in North America\n\n*The Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which was the first ice hockey league to openly hire and trade players, played all of its games at the Gardens.\n\n*The Duquesne was also the first hockey rink to ever use glass above the dasher boards.\n\n*And with 26,000 square feet of ice surface at the Gardens,[2] was nearly 50 feet longer than the modern-day rinks in the National Hockey League (NHL) and had state-of-the-art refrigeration and resurfacing technology.[1] On January 24, 1899, the Gardens hosted its first ice hockey game in a match between the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University of Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh).\n\n*According to Total Hockey, the official encyclopedia of the NHL, Pittsburgh was one of the first cities in North America to lure amateur Canadian players for what was a standard $30 a week stipend and a local job in the early 1900s. The manager of a Canadian team returned from a trip to the Gardens in 1902, according to an account in Total Hockey, and gave the following description to the Toronto Globe: \"Pittsburgh is hockey crazy. Over 10,000 turned out for our three games there. The general admission being 35 cents and 75 cents for a box seat . . . the Pittsburgh rink is a dream . . . What a marvellous place it is.\"\n\nPittsburgh Professionals - Wikipedia\n\nHowever the following season, the team acquired Hod Stuart, who was considered the best player of his era, in certain hockey circles. On December 11, 1905, before the start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart, who previously played in Pittsburgh (for the Bankers of the WPHL in 1903), was suspended from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league.[10]\n\nThe following members of the Pittsburgh Professionals later became members of the Hockey Hall of Fame:\n\nJimmy Gardner (1963)\n\nTommy Smith (1973)\n\nBruce Stuart (1961)\n\nHod Stuart (1945)\n\nPittsburgh Hornets - Wikipedia\n\nThe Pittsburgh Hornets were a minor-league professional men's ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Pittsburgh Hornets did not evolve from the International Hockey League's Pittsburgh Shamrocks. The franchise started play in 1927, playing their first nine seasons as the Detroit Olympics. Then on October 4, 1936, after winning the IHL championship, the Olympics moved to Pittsburgh to become the Hornets. Bill Anderson and Bill Hudson were the only two players from the Shamrocks to be on the Hornets roster at the start of the 1936–37 season.\n\nThe Hornets disbanded after the 1955–56 season. The franchise was suspended because the archaic Duquesne Gardens was torn down. The Hornets reappeared in the new Civic Arena in 1961 and, after a poor start, they became AHL contenders again, this time as a farm club for the Detroit Red Wings. They won a division title in 1964 and won the Calder Cup in 1967. Following the 1967 win, the Hornets were closed for good, victims of NHLexpansion. The Pittsburgh Penguins have served the market since. The Hornets were three-time winners of the American Hockey League's Calder Cup.\n\nOn February 8, 1966, Pittsburgh was granted an NHL franchise, which would become the Pittsburgh Penguins. To make room for the NHL, Pittsburgh's AHL franchise had to be closed. However, the Hornets would go out with a bang. On April 30, 1967, they finished the sweep of Rochester Americans in the Calder Cup Finals after Billy Harris scored:26 seconds into overtime in what would be the last goal in Pittsburgh Hornets’ history. Thirty-one years after the Hornets first game, Coach Baz Bastien and team captain Ab McDonald were presented with the Calder Cup. The Hornets were Calder Cup Champions one last time.\n\nHall of Famers to have played with or worked for the Pittsburgh Hornets:\n\nPlayer\n\nSid Abel 1969\n\nGeorge Armstrong 1975\n\nMarty Barry 1965\n\nAndy Bathgate 1978\n\nLeo Boivin 1986\n\nGerry Cheevers 1985\n\nFernie Flaman 1996\n\nDoug Harvey 1973\n\nTim Horton 1977\n\nJack Stewart 1964\n\nBuilder\n\nFrank Mathers 1992 Coach\n\nBill Torrey 1995 General manager\n\nOther\n\nHowie Meeker 1998 Pittsburgh Hornets Broadcaster\n\nIt's a bit sad that people talk about Pittsburgh being a big bandwagon city as it pertains to hockey because of the struggles they faced after coming into the NHL scene before Lemieux arrived and then again before the Crosby era. The struggles were tied far more to financial reasoning and horrendous management (plus being a very small market in a league that didn't have a salary cap), rather than lack of fan interest. Also don't undersell the untimely death of a budding star in Michel Briere. He looked to be well on his way to having a great career. He could have been the building block for a Pens surge in the early 70's as they manged to get within 2 games of the SCF in Briere's first and only pro season.\n\nHockey in Pittsburgh dates almost as far back as the Pirates (baseball) which is amazing considering how much longer baseball had been around in the States, not to mention disparity in overall popularity. And quite frankly as much as Pittsburgh is referred to as a football town, hockey has a far more wide reaching and richer history with hockey. The NHL was formed, in some part, because of the WPHL's emergence and set up the decade prior. Especially when you look at the financial aspect with paying players a salary."
