        "text": "Defund the Police – Top 3 Pros and Cons\n\nAmid the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020, calls to “defund the police” began to populate protest signs and social media posts.\n\nWhile there are multiple interpretations of “defund the police,” the basic definition is to move funding away from police departments and into community resources such as mental health experts, housing, and social workers. In the larger scope of the civil rights movement, some advocates would reallocate some police funding while keeping police departments, others would combine defunding with other police reforms such as body cameras and bias training, and others see defunding as a small step toward ultimately abolishing police departments and the prison system entirely.\n\nAccording to the most recent data available, departments received about $129 billion nationwide in 2020 from state and local governments, up from $42.3 billion in 1977. Police budgets have made up around 4% of total state and local budgets since 1977. According to the Urban Institute, “from 1977 to 2020, in 2020 inflation-adjusted dollars, state and local government spending on police increased from $45 billion to $129 billion, an increase of 189 percent.” Individual cities or counties may allocate more (or fewer) funds to police departments. The 2017 Los Angeles city budget, for example, provided 23% of the budget to police, while 9% of Los Angeles county’s budget went to policing. About 97% of police budgets go toward operational costs such as salaries and benefits.\n\nIn June 2020, 64% of Americans opposed the abstract idea of defunding the police, while 34% supported the movement. 60% were against reallocating police budget funds to other public health and social programs, while 39% were in favor.\n\nIn Oct. 2021, 21% of American adults wanted police budgets “increased a lot” and 26% wanted budgets “increased a little,” while 9% wanted police budgets “decreased a little” and 6% “decreased a lot.” 37% said budgets should “stay about the same.”\n\nIn his Mar. 1, 2022 State of the Union address, President Joe Biden declared, “We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training.” By Aug. 31, 2022, the movement was largely quiet, with opinion articles declaring “‘Defund the Police’ Is Dead.”\n\nA Mar. 2023 criminology study found that while police departments have not been widely defunded, the departments are experiencing between a 2.2% and 16% loss of full-time police officers. The loss has prompted some departments, including the New Orleans Police Department, to use third party organizations to respond to some 911 calls including minor traffic accidents. Ethan Cheramie, founder of On Scene Services (OSS) that hires former police officers as unarmed responders states, “Citizens still call 911, their call is still dispatched. However, it is dispatched to our agents…. You’re going to continue to see alternative police response be divested from guys with guns over to civilians to respond to these nonviolent calls for service.”\n\nShould Police Departments Be Defunded, if Not Abolished?\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n1. Should police departments be defunded? Why or why not?\n\n2. Are any police reform efforts helpful? Which reforms? Explain your answers.\n\n3. Do you think abolishing police departments would resolve or create more problems for communities of color? Explain your answer.\n\n4. Do you think defunding or eliminating police departments would lead to greater violence in our cities? Explain your answer.\n\nTake Action\n\n1. Explore the resources provided by Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), which promotes defunding the police.\n\n2. Examine which states have and have not enacted police reform laws since May 25, 2020 with the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n3. Consider the con position of Black former police officer, Erroll G. Southers.\n\n4. Consider how you felt about the issue before reading this article. After reading the pros and cons on this topic, has your thinking changed? If so, how? List two to three ways. If your thoughts have not changed, list two to three ways your better understanding of the “other side of the issue” now helps you better argue your position.\n\n5. Push for the position and policies you support by writing US national senators and representatives.\n\nSources"
