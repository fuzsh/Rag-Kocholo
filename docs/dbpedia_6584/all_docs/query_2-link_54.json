Many of their past stars returned to Canada to play pro hockey on newly formed Pro teams. The first year in Canada that the Ontario Hockey League allowed their players to turn professional was after the 1907 season.\n\nAfter the International Hockey (Pro) League from 1904-1907 broke up, many players in the IHL league went on to play pro hockey for teams across the Nation and Canada.
