        "text": "No. That wasn't even close to my point. If you actually read my full post instead of taking a piece of it out of context to misconstrue, you would have read that I pointedly said I wasn't taking a position on that issue at all. But go ahead and beat a straw man. If you had actually read the sequence of posts, you would see that they were directed at the hyperbole of some posters about \"throwing the referee under the bus\" -- which isn't what happened here at all, as the powers that be treated the incident the same way the referee did.\n\n(And before you get overly sanctimonious about how the Suarez incident (which the referee did not see) supports your argument, you might ponder how FIFA addressd the Neymar injury incident (which the referee did see and made a decision about).)\n\nSo please explain to me how you came to be the unquestionable source of what our social norms and values are and someone else is not even allowed to speak their opinion on an internet forum? Isn't that exactly what public 'forums' are for?\n\nI have been doing two things.\n\n1 - responding to the tone of the posts in this thread, specifically those of aek chicago.\n\nand\n\n2 - Making a point that the difference in genders of the ref and players does indeed have an effect on what is appropriate and what isn't.\n\nI stated I think the issue that started the discussion was dealt with just fine.\n\nNow, go read through aek chicago's posts. They get progressively worse as the thread goes on and no one was saying anything about the crap he was spewing.\n\nLet me quote comments throughout this thread that cross the line imo. Some worse than others.\n\nThis is what I was referring to earlier. Where aek chicago stated that if anyone(women included) slapped at his hands in reaction to him putting his hands on them(like that) he would punch them.\n\nAgain, he is attacking the players here. \"prima donnas\" and calling them spoiled rotten. Going with the rest of the tone in his posts I am assuming he is referring to women playing soccer. He is saying that because of the way they act towards each other it means that the very real gender differences and barriers don't exist? Look at his earlier posts talking about how if they want to act like men they should expect to be treated like men. No, they are women. Gender differences and barriers are real. Countless posters have mentioned it in this thread before me.\n\nThis is the referee forum. There are standards. It is not an old boys club.\n\nI should point out this post as well.\n\nReally? So the referee forum is now about objectifying women who are your fellow referees?\n\nAgain, I have been responding to the posts in this thread.\n\nGood post, sir. You could also expound on that. Not only are social norms and mores suspended but LAWS are as well. Fighting is perfectly normal in a hockey match, but when is the last time you've seen a local prosecutor bring assault charges against a hockey player? Probably never.\n\nEver heard of a soccer player getting charged with assault after committing Violent Conduct? Maybe it's happened a handful of times but most VC could easily be construed as assault or battery in most states and yet charges are rarely, if ever, filed.\n\nbringing charges against Hockey players is actually not all that uncommon. Conviction is less common, though in one case the acquittal was on the grounds that there was no way to tell which blow killed the victim.\n\nSince 1975, six of ten assault charges ended in conviction or pleas of no contest.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n1905 - Allan Loney was charged with manslaughter in the on-ice clubbing death of Alcide Laurin. Loney claimed self-defence, and was found not guilty.[5]\n\n1907 - Ottawa Senators players Harry Smith, Alf Smith and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beatingMontreal Wanderers players Hod Stuart, Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson and Cecil Blatchford with their sticks.\n\n1907 - Ottawa Victorias player Charles Masson was charged with manslaughter after Cornwall player Owen McCourt died of a head wound sustained in a brawl. Masson was found not guilty on the grounds that there was no way to know which blow had killed McCourt.[6]\n\n1922 - Sprague Cleghorn injured three Ottawa Senators players in a brawl, leading Ottawa police to offer to arrest him.\n\n1969 - In a pre-season game held in Ottawa, Ted Green of the Boston Bruins and Wayne Maki of the St.Louis Blues engaged in a violent, stick-swinging brawl. A fractured skull and brain damage caused Green to miss the entire 1969–1970 NHL season.[7] The NHL suspended Maki for 30 days and Green for 13 games. Both men were acquitted in court.\n\n1975 - Dan Maloney of the Detroit Red Wings was charged with assault causing bodily harm after he attacked Brian Glennie of the Toronto Maple Leafs from behind. In exchange for a no-contest plea, Maloney did community service work and was banned from playing in Toronto for two seasons.\n\n1975 - Police charged Bruins player Dave Forbes with aggravated assault after a fight with Henry Boucha of the Minnesota North Stars. After a nine-day trial ended with a hung jury, charges against Forbes were dropped. Boucha suffered blurred vision from the incident and never fully recovered.\n\n1976 - Philadelphia Flyers players Joe Watson, Mel Bridgman, Don Saleski and Bob \"Hound\" Kelly were charged with assault after using their hockey sticks as weapons in a violent playoff game between the Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs in which fans had been taunting the Flyers players and spitting at them. Bridgman was acquitted, but the other three Flyers were found guilty of simple assault.\n\n1976 - Calgary Cowboys forward Rick Jodzio plead guilty to a charge of assault following a cross-check to the head ofQuebec Nordiques player Marc Tardif during the World Hockey Association playoffs. The hit led to a 20-minute bench clearing brawl.[8]\n\n1977 - Dave \"Tiger\" Williams of the Toronto Maple Leafs hit Pittsburgh Penguin Dennis Owchar with his stick. He was charged with assault, but acquitted.\n\n1982 - Jimmy Mann of the Winnipeg Jets left the bench and sucker-punched Pittsburgh Penguin Paul Gardner, breaking Gardner's jaw in two places. Mann was fined $500 and given a suspended sentence in Winnipeg.\n\n1988 - Dino Ciccarelli hit Leafs defenceman Luke Richardson with his stick. Charged and convicted of assault, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000.\n\n1998 - Jesse Boulerice of the Plymouth Whalers was suspended for the rest of the playoffs after violently swinging his stick at Guelph Storm forward Andrew Long. Boulerice was charged with assault as a result of the incident.\n\n2000 - Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins hit Vancouver Canuck Donald Brashear in the head with his stick in the waning moments of the game, after losing a fight to Brashear earlier in the game. McSorley was convicted of assault with a weapon and given an 18-month conditional discharge.\n\n2004 - In the Todd Bertuzzi - Steve Moore incident, Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks sucker-punched Moore of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The pair then fell to the ice with Bertuzzi's weight crushing Moore face-first into the ice, followed by several players from both teams further piling onto the mêlée. Moore sustained three fractured vertebrae, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. Bertuzzi was charged by police, and given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to assault causing bodily harm. His suspension resulted in a loss of $500,000 in pay and the Canucks were fined $250,000. Bertuzzi was re-instated in 2005; Moore has not played since and made several unsuccessful attempts at civil litigation."
