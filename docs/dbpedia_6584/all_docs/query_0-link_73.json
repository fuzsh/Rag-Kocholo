        "text": "CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. - Ball players native to Clarksville and Austin Peay attendees have had a variety of success when it comes to professional baseball. While a lot have made it to independent and rookie ball, only a select few have made the jump to the Major Leagues.\n\nThe players below are listed in order of earliest entry into the Major Leagues to present day. Austin Peay baseball alumni hold most of the positions, with Hall of Fame utility player Jimmy Stewart as the earliest.\n\nHod Lisenbee\n\nMLB debut- April 23, 1927 for the Washington Senators\n\nLast MLB appearance- Sept. 7, 1945 for the Cincinnati Reds\n\nPosition: Pitcher\n\nClarksville native Hod Lisenbee was a career journeyman in both the majors and minors in his 28 year-long career before retiring and returning to his hometown. He debuted at the age of 28 and is most notably known for his accomplishments against “Murderers’ Row.” He faced the New York Yankees six times in his rookie year and won the first five outings, facing the famed Babe Ruth. Lisenbee’s sixth outing ended with Ruth securing his 58th home run of the year.\n\nJimmy Stewart\n\nMLB debut- Sept. 3, 1963\n\nLast MLB appearance- Sept. 23, 1973\n\nPosition: utility\n\nAustin Peay Hall of Famer, Jimmy Stewart became the first alum to play both in a Division League championship series and the World Series. Stewart played for the Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros. Following the end of his playing career, Stewart worked as a scout and minor league manager until he retired in 2006.\n\nGreg Tubbs\n\nMLB debut- Aug. 1, 1993\n\nLast MLB appearance- Oct. 3, 1993\n\nPosition: outfielder\n\nGreg Tubbs, out of Smithville, played for the Cincinnati Reds for 35 games in 1993. He was drafted in the 22nd round of the 1984 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves and was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Rico Rossy.\n\nBronson Heflin\n\nMLB debut- Aug. 1, 1996\n\nLast MLB appearance- Aug. 7, 1996\n\nPosition: pitcher\n\nBronson Heflin was born in Clarksville and played for University of Tennessee before he was selected by the Phillies in the 37th round of the 1994 MLB draft. The righty hand a short stint at the major level for Philadelphia and closed out his professional career in 2000 with the Nashville Sounds, who were the Pittsburgh Pirates’ AAA affiliate at the time.\n\nJamie 'Cat' Walker\n\nMLB debut- April 2, 1997\n\nLast MLB appearance- June 2, 2009\n\nPosition: pitcher\n\nMcMinnville native Walker ranks fifth all-time in APSU history with 17 wins and first three career shutouts. He was drafted in the 10th round of the 1992 draft. Walker was a replacement player during the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, which barred him membership to the players association and prevented him from being listed among the Detroit Tigers players on their ALCS championship merchandise. He nearly broke the league record for most appearances in a season without a decision (no wins or losses).\n\nGeorge Sherrill\n\nMLB debut- July 16, 2004\n\nLast MLB appearance- April 9, 2012\n\nPosition: pitcher\n\nSherrill was un-drafted following his career at Austin Peay and started his professional career in the independent Frontier League pitching for the Evansville Otters, Quebec Capitals in the Northeast League and the Northern League’s Sioux Falls Canaries and Winnipeg Goldeyes before signing a deal with the Seattle Mariners. Sherrill worked his way into a set-up role and eventually became one of the top closing pitchers in the American League while with the Baltimore Orioles. He was the first APSU pitcher to be named to an MLB All-Star team. Known as the “Brim Reaper” for the flat billed style he preferred.\n\nA.J. Ellis\n\nMLB debut- Sept. 15, 2008 for the LA Dodgers\n\nPresent\n\nPosition: catcher\n\nEllis was drafted by the Dodgers in the 18th round of the 2003 MLB Draft and has been with the program ever since.

He caught Clayton Kershaw's no-hitter on June 18, 2014.\n\nShawn Kelley\n\nMLB debut- April 10, 2009\n\nPresent\n\nPosition: pitcher\n\nAfter coming back from Tommy Johns in his red-shirt freshman year at APSU, Kelley rose to one of the top pitchers in the OVC. His low ERA boosted his ratings to a 13th round selection by the Seattle Mariners in the 2007 draft. The Louisville, Ky. native impressed coaches early on to earn slots on the 25-man roster with the Mariners. He made a stop in New York with the Yankees, where he spent some time as a closer, and is currently a Padre.\n\nMatt Reynolds\n\nMLB debut- Aug. 19, 2010\n\nPresent\n\nPosition: pitcher\n\nMatt Reynolds was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 20th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft and is now a reliever with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
