IBA Short Course\n\nIf you are interested in possibly competing in the IBA program in the future and want a jump start the IBA prep class may be for you. The IBA class will be on Sunday May 19th from 8:30 a.m. -2:30 p.m. in room 306/307 of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center\n\nHow to sign up: To sign up for this exciting course taught by Bob Stewart of ExxonMobil which prepares students and professors that may like to participate in the IBA competition for 2014, please email Mike at in the subject line put “IBA Class” so I can easily find your message. Respond ASAP as there is no cost to attend and space is limited to 45 participants. If you are interested in the IBA program make sure and attend this event.\n\nIn the course, we will explore concepts, methods, and tools of petroleum geoscience, which we use on a day-to-day basis to make exploration decisions in the energy industry. We will focus on how we make decisions with limited information, identify critical information in light of multiple scenarios, evaluate risk vs. uncertainty, maximize the value we get from integrated teams, etc. To investigate these topics, we will generate play element maps, play summary charts, cross-sections, and play summary maps. The course will combine lecture materials and hands-on exercises, with an emphasis on the exercises. The course will focus on an applied problem in basin exploration. Students will make play maps, evaluate play risk, bid on prospective acreage. Throughout the course we will stress the importance of integration across disciplines and scales, focusing on the interaction and expression of fundamental basin formation, fill, and evolution processes from regional to basin and play to prospect scale. These discussions will include consideration of plate motion, paleogeography, stratigraphy, structural deformation, sedimentology, rock properties, subsurface imaging, burial history, and fluid migration.\n\n2.

Post-Convention Field Trip 8\n\nAAPG Student Chapter (AAPG-SC) and Society for Sedimentary Geology (SEPM)\n\nStratigraphy and Depositional Environments of Middle to Late Devonian Natural Gas Reservoirs in the Central Pennsylvania Appalachian Basin: Marcellus, Burkett and Lockhaven Formations\n\nNote: This one sells out fast folks so don’t be surprised if it is sold out (were still some spots on 4/3/13)\n\nDates: Wednesday, 22 May, 3:00 p.m.–Friday, 24 May 7:00 p.m. (Departs from and returns to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center)\n\nLeaders: Daniel Kohl (Chevron North America, Moon Township, Pennsylvania), Rudy Slingerland and Courtney Swanson (The Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania), and Bob Clarke (Consultant, Irving, Texas)\n\nFee: Graduate Students & Faculty Advisors only $50\n\nIncludes: Ground transportation, two nights’ lodging based on double occupancy, breakfast Thursday and Friday, lunch Thursday and Friday, dinner Wednesday and Thursday, refreshments, guidebook\n\nLimit: 35 people\n\nThis field trip will examine the sedimentology and stratigraphy of world famous Appalachian Basin oil and gas reservoirs. First day of the trip will examine the lower portion of the Middle Devonian Marcellus Formation. These strata were deposited within a third order depositional sequence (~3 my duration), associated with the Mahantango Formation delta complex. We will examine the full spectrum of depositional environments associated with this sequence, from proximal deltaic sandstones, to the distal organic-rich mudstones and shales which are the target of unconventional production in the basin. Second day will examine the overlying Upper Devonian shale and sandstone reservoirs. The Burkett Member is an emerging unconventional shale gas reservoir in the basin, and exhibits many similarities to the underlying Marcellus Formation. The Lock Haven Formation is a conventional sandstone reservoir that has produced more than 55 billion cubic feet of gas in the Council Run Field, just a few miles west of the outcrop exposures.\n\nEach day of this trip will begin by examining cores provided by the Penn State’s Appalachian Basin Black Shale Research Group (ABBSG), followed by a short drive to exposures of these formations in the central Pennsylvania Nittany Anticlinorium. Accommodations will be provided in State College, PA, within walking distance to The Pennsylvania State University.\n\n11.
