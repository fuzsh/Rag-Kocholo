        "text": "We honor the memories of FMA members who have passed away and recognize their intellectual contributions, mentorship, and friendship to the finance profession.\n\nJames Gentry\n\nJames A. \"Jim\" Gentry, 93, of Champaign passed away July 25, 2024, in Urbana.\n\nJim graduated from Indiana State University with the intention of becoming an educator. After retiring from the Air Force, he earned a master's of business administration at Indiana University, which led to a position as stockbroker with Dean Witter in the San Francisco area for five years. But the desire to be an educator lead him back to his Indiana roots, where he earned a Ph.D. in finance from the Indiana University School of Business.\n\nHe joined the faculty of the University of Illinois Finance Department in September 1966. In his 50-year career, Jim served as associate dean and the Investors in Business Education Distinguished Professor of Finance and on numerous academic committees and campus-wide boards and committees. He received three Fulbright scholarships at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, Toyko International University and Tuscia University in Viterbo, Italy.\n\nJim was Vice President of the 1986 FMA Annual Meeting Program.\n\nTarun Mukherjee\n\nUniversity of New Orleans finance professor Tarun Mukherjee, who spent more than four decades as a faculty member at the University of New Orleans where he established a scholarship, created a $50,000 student-managed fund, and help create an on-campus finance trading lab, died June 11. He was 78.\n\nMukherjee, whose primary expertise was in corporate finance, donated $100,000 to establish the Kali C. and Sushila B. Mukherjee Student-Managed Fund and the Kali and Sushila Mukherjee Trading Lab because he said he wanted to give UNO finance majors real-world experience in portfolio management.\n\nMukherjee was hired at UNO as an assistant professor in economics and finance in 1981. He was promoted to associate professor and granted tenure in 1985. He was promoted to full professor in 1987.\n\nMichael C Jensen\n\nMichael Cole Jensen (Mike) died on April 2nd, 2024 at the age of 84. Mike was a brilliant and renowned scholar of financial economics, an impactful teacher and mentor, a successful entrepreneur, a generous and loyal friend, and a great father.\n\nThroughout his life, Mike believed a critical factor in advancing scholarly thought was the free flow of information. In the mid-1970s he perceived the preeminent financial and economic journals of the time were reluctant to embrace new concepts that were being posited by his younger generation of scholars. Ever the disruptor, Mike co-founded and edited the Journal of Financial Economics to create competition to the entrenched journals that had gone stale in their thinking. It was a great success, becoming a preeminent journal itself.\n\nIn the mid-1990's Mike once again played disruptor, this time to the inefficiency of sharing early research and eventually to the legacy publishers of academic journals. Early on, he identified the newborn-internet as the way to share early-stage research papers, rather than using the mail. SSRN.com (Social Science Research Network) was born and it became the largest open access, on-line, social sciences working paper repository in the world. It has made sharing research vastly more efficient and has democratized access to academic information.\n\nMike was the inaugural speaker in FMA's Pioneers in Finance Series and an FMA Fellow.\n\nEugene \"Gene\" Brigham\n\nDr. Eugene F. Brigham, the author of one of the best-selling finance textbooks passed on March 17, 2024 at the age of 94.\n\nAfter his Navy tour serving as a supply officer on a destroyer in the Mediterranean, he went on to graduate school – choosing business school over law school because the registration line was shorter. That fortunate decision led to a successful career as a finance professor, textbook author, and consultant and expert witness in the public utility industry. After receiving his MBA and PhD from UC Berkeley, Gene had another lucky break during his time as a young associate professor at UCLA when his boss asked if he would be interested in a summer project updating a finance textbook. With his ability to clarify complex topics and bring in real-world examples that students could relate to, Gene eventually created a family of top-selling finance textbooks, including \"Fundamentals of Financial Management,\" \"Intermediate Financial Management,\" and \"Financial Management Theory and Practice.\" His books, some of which are now in their 17th editions, are used at more than 1,000 colleges worldwide and have been translated into 11 languages.\n\nGene began his career at the University of Florida as a finance professor in 1971. He served in his role at Warrington for more than 30 years, during which time he also co-founded the Public Utility Research Center (PURC) to enhance the understanding of issues facing energy, telecommunications, water utilities and their regulatory agencies. The Eugene F. Brigham Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate Department at UF’s Warrington College of Business is named in his honor for his many contributions to the business school. More recently, he created the Brigham Finance Excellence Fund to support development, networking, and leadership opportunities for undergraduate finance students.\n\nGene was an FMA Founder, Vice President - Program of FMA's first Annual Meeting in 1971, FMA President and is an FMA Fellow.\n\nAnita Glover\n\nWe are deeply saddened to share news of the unexpected passing of Anita Glover.\n\nOriginally from Baltimore, she moved to Tampa and became FMA's second full-time employee in 1985. Anita played an integral role in making FMA successful. The consummate team player, she stepped into any position she was asked to fill. During her career with FMA, she excelled at a myriad of roles too numerous to list. At the time of her retirement in 2007, she was the Director of Placement Services, helping candidates and employers navigate interviewing and job searches with compassion, sensitivity and kindness.\n\nAfter retirement, she founded Happy Scraps with her daughter, creating custom children's decor. Her happy place was behind a sewing machine creating designs that made people smile.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Michelle Glover Kolch, who was formerly FMA's Director of Student Programs and her much-loved grandchildren, Jazzy and Bear.\n\nAnita was a cherished colleague and will never be forgotten by those that were fortunate enough to have known her.\n\nPete DaDalt\n\nDr. Pete Dadalt, assistant professor of finance, passed away unexpectedly on Saturday, Jan. 13.\n\nSince joining Susquehanna University in 2016, Pete had become a familiar and respected figure on campus. Known for his willingness to engage in discussions ranging from finance and teaching to current events, he was as approachable to his colleagues as he was to his students. Pete was passionate about finance and teaching, a fact evident whether he was in the classroom, during office hours, or chatting in the hallways of Apfelbaum Hall.\n\nPete played a key role in the recent advancements of our finance program at Susquehanna University. He was instrumental in establishing the CFA Affiliation at the university and mentored students preparing for the CFA Level 1 exam. Additionally, he led the university’s River Hawk Fund, where students manage an actual investment portfolio exceeding $200,000. Pete served on several committees during his time at Susquehanna University and was faculty recording secretary for the 2022–2023 academic year.\n\nJohn Haslem\n\nJohn A. (Jack) Haslem, professor emeritus of finance, the founding academic affairs dean and founding chair of the finance department at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, passed away on Oct. 8, 2023.\n\nJack joined the university’s faculty in 1969 and established the first security analysis course in a collegiate business school dedicated to mutual funds, for which he would later receive the Panhellenic Association's \"Outstanding Teacher Award.\"\n\nHe was a renowned researcher, respected by colleagues in the field for his mutual funds research focusing on financial issues, regulation, expense ratio, normative transparency of disclosure and other policy issues.\n\nDuring his career, he produced over 150 publications, including more than 65 books and articles appearing in the Journal of Investing, Journal of Index Investing, Institutional Investor’s “A Guide to Small-Cap Investing” and “Exchange-Traded Funds: New Approaches and Global Outreach,” Journal of Indexes, Financial Services Review, Journal of Wealth Management and others. He also served as a consultant to NASA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and numerous banks and law firms.\n\nDonald Tuttle\n\nDonald Latham Tuttle, 88, passed away on August 21, 2023.\n\nDon earned a charter from the Institute of the Financial Analysts in 1971, which began a lifetime of service, first as a volunteer and then as his second career in Charlottesville, Virginia, 1992-2007, as a Senior Vice President. He was a major contributor to the chartering process bringing order, rigor, and innovation to the curriculum, examinations, and the grading process. He was responsible for deciding to use a psychometric consultant to verify the validity of the CFA examination which are granted with worldwide distinction in the field of financial careers. A CFA charter requires three years of study with an examination at the end of each year.\n\nDr. Tuttle is a former President, Vice President, and director of the Financial Management Association and received the FMA Fellow Recognition Award for his service. He was Associate Editor of The Journal of Finance and Financial Management.\n\nRichard Sweeney\n\nRichard J. (Dick) Sweeney, emeritus professor of economics and international finance at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, died July 30, 2023.\n\nAn alumnus of UCLA with a Ph.D. from Princeton, he taught at UCLA, Texas A&M, Claremont McKenna College, and Claremont Graduate University. While he was at CMC from 1977 until 1989, he was one of the editors of Economic Inquiry. He and his family have lived in Claremont for a total of 24 years. They moved from Claremont and lived in Alexandria, Virginia for 23 years, then returned to the City of Trees.\n\nBefore his retirement from Georgetown in 2015, he enjoyed traveling and spent summers and sabbaticals teaching at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and the Copenhagen Business School in Denmark. He and his Swedish colleague, Clas Wihlborg, traveled together in eastern Europe and witnessed the changes in Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nDick served as the European Conference Program Co-chair for the 2000 European Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nHarry Markowitz\n\nHarry Markowitz passed away on Thursday, June 22, at the age of 95.\n\nDr. Markowitz is considered to be the father of modern portfolio theory which is taught in many finance courses today.\n\nDr. Markowitz published numerous articles in the Journal of Finance, including his dissertation paper from 1952, “Portfolio Selection,” which remains one of the most highly cited works to appear in the Journal. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 for this path breaking and foundational work.\n\nDr. Markowitz was a professor at the University of California, San Diego and received his Ph.B., M.A., and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.\n\nMark Gruskin\n\nMark R Gruskin, Ph.D: Age 69, associate professor of finance and accounting at Pennsylvania State University Lehigh Valley, passed away May 15, 2023 at his residence in Bethlehem, PA.\n\nHe was the son of the late Jack and Shirley Gruskin and is survived by several cousins as well as numerous friends, colleagues, and students in the Penn State community.\n\nA native of Churchill, PA, Dr. Gruskin received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Penn State and spent most of his career working for Ford Motor Co., beginning as a financial analyst and retiring 27 years later as manager of the Fordstar Dealer Communications Network.\n\nUpon his retirement from Ford, he returned to academia, earning a doctorate in finance from Wayne State University in Detroit. He then joined the faculty at Penn State Lehigh Valley and was later appointed associate professor. He also served a stint there as interim director of academic affairs.\n\nEd Kane\n\nEdward J. Kane, an economist specializing in banking and financial regulation, passed away on March 2, 2023 in Tucson, AZ.\n\nThe highly-cited author of three books and hundreds of academic articles was one of the few economists to foresee the S&L debacle of the 1980s. Dr. Kane was a man of diverse interests. Inspired by comic books and horror movies, he introduced the now-ubiquitous term Zombie Bank to the lexicon of financial writing.\n\nProfessor Kane earned a BS from Georgetown and a Ph.D. from MIT. He taught at Princeton, Iowa State and Boston College before accepting the Everett D. Reese Chair of Banking and Monetary Economics at the Ohio State University, which he held from 1972 to 1992.

This accounts for the long list of credentials earned throughout his education and career as a professor of finance as well as his varied interests (some fleeting and others longer lasting) in activities like paddle-boarding, cooking, gardening, playing videogames and even judging barbeque.\n\nKenneth was known for his outgoing and fun-loving personality and his sense of adventure and spontaneity.\n\nHe loved to travel the world, and made new friends everywhere he visited -- and he visited a lot of places. Kenneth’s generous spirit and recognizable laugh will be missed.\n\nRonald Lease\n\nRon Lease passed away on October 9, 2022.\n\nRon earned his MBA and PhD In Finance from Purdue University.

He spent 35 years serving the community at Binghamton University, including a 21-year tenure as Dean of the School of Management. During that time, he had an immeasurable impact on students, staff, alumni, faculty and friends of the University. He was extremely proud of all that was accomplished under his tenure at the School of Management. The school received numerous accolades including recognition as one of the top business schools in the country. But his passion was always serving the students of the University, and his greatest pride was playing a supporting role in their accomplishments in the field of finance and beyond.\n\nDhillon began his career as a project engineer and assistant plant manager at Shriram Chemicals in Kota, India, before shifting his focus to finance. He earned his MBA and PhD at Louisiana State University, and came to Binghamton as a visiting assistant professor of finance in 1987, becoming a tenure-track assistant professor two years later.

Jan’s international background proved very useful here, and Jan’s personality was also a decisive factor in the great success of the new master’s degree programme. Jan’s personal approach to the students and his eminent teaching skills made him a highly valued lecturer and key figure in the establishment of the study programme.
