        "text": "Protective neck guards are rarely worn in pro and college hockey, rejected by players who find them uncomfortable or restrictive. They aren't required in youth hockey either. Will that change?\n\nBy Rachel Blount\n\nNovember 3, 2023 at 12:10PM\n\nThe Wild held a moment of silence for former Hibbing star Adam Johnson at their first home game since his death. Johnson also played two years with the UMD Bulldogs and 13 games with the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins. (Renée Jones Schneider, Star Tribune/Star Tribune)\n\nWhen hockey players lace up their skates, they don't often ponder the risk posed by the razor-sharp blades attached to their feet. Dr. Michael Stuart has thought about it for years, as both a hockey parent and chief medical officer for USA Hockey.\n\nStuart has never forgotten the fear he felt when his son, Mike, took a skate to the neck while playing for Colorado College in 1998. Mike needed 22 stitches to close the wound. A week later, he returned to play against the Gophers at Mariucci Arena, narrowly escaping the kind of tragedy that occurred last Saturday when Hibbing native Adam Johnson died in a similar incident.\n\n\"It was very, very frightening,\" said Stuart, a Rochester resident and orthopedic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic. \"Thank goodness our son was spared. These injuries are rare, but it's something we're striving diligently to prevent.\"\n\nThe primary tool in that effort is the neck laceration protector, which is getting renewed attention in the wake of Johnson's death. The former Minnesota Duluth forward, 29, died after he was struck in the throat by a falling opponent's skate blade last week, while playing for the Nottingham Panthers of England's Elite Hockey League.\n\nMany hockey organizations do not require neck guards. They are rarely worn in the NHL, college hockey or top-level minor leagues, rejected by players who find them uncomfortable or restrictive.\n\nJohnson's death has prompted calls to make neck protectors mandatory, though it's not certain that using one would have saved him. In Stuart's role with USA Hockey, he's been involved with testing and development of neck guards for several years. While designs and materials have improved, he said the effectiveness of protectors varies widely, and no current product can completely prevent fatalities or serious injuries.\n\nJohnson is the second U.S. hockey player in two years to suffer a fatal skate cut to the neck. Teddy Balkind, 16, died in January 2022 when he was injured during a prep school game in Greenwich, Conn.\n\nBalkind's death shook the sport to its core, but it did not lead any major U.S. hockey organizations to make neck protectors mandatory. With Johnson's fatal injury spotlighting the danger again, some are giving them another look, including Gophers men's hockey coach Bob Motzko.\n\nWild forward Pat Maroon thinks players are ready to consider it. Last season, when he played for Tampa Bay, he was on the other side of a scary skate cut when his blade accidentally sliced the wrist of Edmonton's Evander Kane.\n\n\"If they put [neck guards] in, you have to wear it, right?\" Maroon said. \"If there's a vote and players have to vote, I'm sure people would vote and be on board.\"\n\nStuart, USA Hockey's chief medical officer, is now a hockey grandfather who recently advised his daughter on what kind of neck protector to buy for his grandson. He also will participate in an International Ice Hockey Federation meeting Saturday to reassess safety measures in the wake of Johnson's fatal injury.\n\nGiven his son's close call, Johnson's death has touched him in a deeply personal way, reinforcing his dedication to preventing one of hockey's most frightening injuries.\n\n\"We're going to keep working through the challenges to effectively make our sport safer,\" Stuart said. \"This was a horrible tragedy. Maybe it will be an impetus for change.\"\n\nStar Tribune staff writers Christa Lawler, Sarah McLellan and David La Vaque contributed to this report.\n\nRachel Blount\n\nReporter/Columnist\n\nRachel Blount is a sports reporter for the Star Tribune who covers a variety of topics, including the Olympics, Wild, college sports and horse racing.
