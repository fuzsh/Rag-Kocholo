        "text": "Marjorie Okes Headley Wood Urban, Gone Golfin' After nearly 93 years of a life well played, Marge Urban reached the 19th hole June 5, 2019. Marge was born in St Paul, Minnesota, where her competitive spirit was honed at an early age as the youngest of four sisters first vying for their father's attention and then that of the boys at St Paul Academy. (Not coincidentally, Mom and her sister both ended up marrying Headley cousins from SPA).\n\nAt 18, she channeled her competitive nature in the pool becoming the 100-yard freestyle National Champion. If not for WWII, she would have represented the USA in the London 1944 Olympics. As a young war bride, Mom \"immigrated\" to the Northwest and proceeded to raise a family across a series of Weyerhaeuser mill towns throughout Washington and Oregon while supporting her husband's burgeoning career. Life changed abruptly when she was widowed at an early age with three children to take care of.\n\nMom was a big believer in education and was a role model for lifelong learning. As a widow on a limited budget, she managed to fund our college educations while also returning to school herself, years after attending Vassar and the University of Minnesota. At the same graduation ceremony where her eldest daughter received her BA, Mom received a master's degree from the University of Washington. She took an incredible journey from her work as a kindergarten teacher at Annie Wright Seminary to ultimately serve as the Dean of Women at Everett Community College.\n\nMom was an avid golfer and played throughout the Northwest, Hawaii and Arizona. Club championships at both the Tacoma Country & Golf Club and Kona Country Club and nailing seven holes-in-one were only a few of the highlights during her long golf career. True to her competitive spirit, she offered $100 to any of us who beat her in golf and $50 to any winner in tennis. Mom remains the family golf champion; although Alexis did cash in many years ago with a tennis win.\n\nMom's volunteer work and hobbies spanned a wide spectrum: swim coach, Tacoma Art Museum president, Everett Junior League president, NW boating adventures, book clubs, dog shows, and garden club president. But she ultimately landed on the study of art which continued into her last years. Her world travels influenced her beginning art, but studies of still life florals became her favorite subject in later life. We all have various Urban originals hanging on our walls!\n\nMom was a keen and successful money manager. She delighted in gathering up her winnings (pennies, nickels and dimes) at the Merrill Garden card tables almost as much as she delighted in her daily 1 PM teleconference with her stockbroker which continued until her last day. She instilled the value of savings in all her children and gets credit for introducing us to the concept of the 401K she matched every dollar we earned doing summer jobs that remained saved for a year.\n\nOur mother was something of a philosopher as well. We all received a variety of letters over the years sharing her views on our life choices; although, by her own admission, she didn't necessarily always practice what she preached. She was famous for her quotes such as \"just don't.\", \"don't alienate yourself from society\" and \"keep your options open\", followed by the corollary and sage \"don't have too many options\". \"Family is everything\" was her most recurrent phrase in her last years.\n\nMom was known for her distinctive laugh and her naughty joke telling. That inhaling laugh followed by the exhaling combination of a cackle and a bellow will live on, echoing in our memories as though she were still entertaining downstairs well after our bedtime when we would hear it reverberating off the living room walls and through the floorboards. We will always be reminded of her, as at least half of her descendants carry that laugh gene in one form or another, as well as a determined will and fierce competitiveness. We will continue to bellow and guffaw at each other over the absurdities and ironies of life while also trying to best one another in various sports, board and card games. Mom outlived three husbands - Richard K. Headley, Ivan D. Wood, and Frederic K. Urban - and innumerable boyfriends. She is predeceased by her sisters Josephine ’35, Edith ’38, and Mary ’39. She is survived by her three children and their spouses, Alexis (and Dennis) Hlavacek, Steven (and Susan) Headley, and Barbara (and Nicholas) Malden, as well as seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren. We also want to give a special thank you to Melanie Sonneman and Denise Vail for the loving care and companionship they gave to Mom during her years at Merrill Garden. .and now with some time, Mom will be urging us all to \"go ahead and play through!\"\n\nMary-Hill French, a geologist who prepared bomb target maps for the U.S. Army Air Force in World War II, became the first woman professional hired by the iron-mining industry in northern Minnesota, and collaborated for more than half a century in the research and writings of her husband, a NASA geologist and planetary scientist, died on July 26, 2019 in Bethesda, Maryland. She was 102 years old. Her husband, Bevan M. French, said that the cause of death was complications from a pulmonary infection.\n\nOriginally intending to become either a lawyer or a journalist (preferably an international reporter) when she arrived at college in 1934, Ms. French instead majored in geology after a freshman course with an exciting and inspiring professor. Needing tuition money, she happily accepted the job of geology lab instructor, and the die was cast. During the eight decades after graduation, she continually and energetically combined a wide range of different activities into a long and active life: graduate study, engineering work for a mining company, marriage, family, travel, and service to a wide range of scientific, educational, and social organizations. Since 1967, she was also a constant colleague, collaborator, and editor in the research, professional travels, publications, and educational activities of her second husband, Bevan M. French, now a retired NASA geologist, planetary scientist, and program administrator.\n\nMary-Hill French was born Mary-Hill Kueffner, on November 14, 1916 in St. Paul, MN, the daughter of William and Helen Kueffner. She attended local schools, including Summit School in St. Paul, then attended Carleton College in Northfield, MN, receiving a B.A. in 1938 Magna Cum Laude with a major in Geology. She subsequently received an M.A. in Geology from Carleton, then began work on a Ph.D. degree at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, she was recruited by the U.S. Army Air Force Information Service and served a year at the Army Map Service in Washington, D.C., an institution which she and her young colleagues referred to as the “Map Trap”. The duties of this group of young scientists were to review available maps to obtain information about military sites in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and to construct target maps that the U.S. Army Air Corps could use in bombing missions. She combined these grim activities with the youthful exploration of wartime Washington (to the extent possible during severe gas rationing) and with the enthusiasm shared by a group of similar young people who were making a contribution to America’s war effort.\n\nIn 1943, Mary-Hill Kueffner resigned from the Air Force to marry Tappan Childs, a civil engineer from St. Paul, MN. She spent the rest of the war years moving with her husband from one military construction site to another, passing through such locations as Leadville, CO; Colorado Springs, CO; and Rough and Ready Island, CA, meeting a wide variety of Americans and learning such survival skills as boiling water at high altitude (use a pressure cooker) and getting a stuck car out of a mudhole (wait for the evening freeze, then drive out). After the War, the family (now including three children) settled in Hibbing, MN, a northern Minnesota town on the Mesabi Iron Range mining district, where Ms. Childs continued to raise her family and also found time to serve as President of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters and the American Association of University Women (AAUW).\n\nWith the sudden death of her husband in 1957, from an accidental fall at home, Ms. Childs found a geological position with Pickands Mather, an iron-mining company on the Mesabi Range. She was the first woman to be employed in a professional capacity by an iron-mining company and probably one of the first women to be employed professionally in the overall mining industry. She worked actively, with many male colleagues at Pickands Mather and other iron-mining companies, on developing the so-called “taconite process”, a series of technical procedures that made it possible to economically extract the low-grade iron ores that still remained after the removal of the high-grade “direct shipping” ores that had originally fueled the development of the Mesabi Range and other iron ranges in the region. This successful development of the complicated process, involving the conversion of fine-grained ores into pellets that could be used in existing blast furnaces, was largely responsible for preserving iron mining as a continuing economic activity on the Mesabi Range and in many similar mining districts in Wisconsin and Michigan. During her work, Ms. Childs became a member, and one of a few women, in the American Association of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers (AIME), presented papers on her work at national meetings, and published her results in the Association’s technical books and other publications.\n\nAlthough working in a virtually all-male environment, she experienced little difficulty or friction on the job. She later recalled that “at first, my colleagues, from engineers to workmen, were skeptical about having a woman working with them, but before long that changed, and they became very protective of me. The workmen delighted in telling me dirty jokes, which I never understood, but I kept trying to laugh at what might be the right places, and these attempts amused them even more. Confidence gained, I realized that being unique could be good, and I started wearing a red dress to meetings.”\n\nAt a geological meeting in 1965, Ms. Childs met Bevan M. French, a NASA geologist who was giving a paper on his Ph.D. research on the rocks of the Mesabi Range. They were married in 1967 and settled in Chevy Chase, MD, where Dr. French continued a long career with NASA, including participation in the Apollo Program of moon landings, research on terrestrial meteorite impact craters, and the management of NASA’s scientific research on lunar samples and meteorites. In addition to remaining heavily involved in Dr. French’s scientific activities and popular publications (including The Moon Book, published by Penguin Books in 1976), Ms. French participated in Welcome to Washington, a group which provided joint educational and social activities for local residents and foreign visitors, and in the Geological Society of Washington, a local professional group, in which she served for two years as a member of the Council and as Assistant Treasurer for a year. The couple also travelled widely for scientific meetings, geological field studies, and tourism, visiting 32 different countries during their marriage. In addition to several visits to Austria, where Dr. French was a Visiting Professor at the University of Vienna, the couple spent a sabbatical year (1981-1982) in South Africa studying ancient meteorite impact craters and getting a close and detailed experience of the country during the apartheid era. In her 70s and 80s, Ms. French continued to participate in geological field excursions, including trips through the Australian and Namibian deserts.\n\nAsked in an interview about what shaped her life, Ms. French answered, “Curiosity and the Depression, which meant a constant need for money, cheerfulness, and a sense of responsibility. So many people helped me that I wanted in return to help them and any others who might need money as I had. And there was the enjoyment of all the good things; each thing kept me looking forward to the next.”\n\nSurvivors include: Bevan M. French, her husband of 51 years, two sons, one daughter, eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nElizabeth \"Betsy\" Nye Suter, long-time resident of Concord, Massachusetts and also of North Chatham, Massachusetts in the summers and Green Valley, Arizona in the winters, died Sunday, May 26th, 2019, at Care Dimensions Hospice House in Lincoln MA, of multiple causes. She was 93.\n\nBetsy was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota on September 6th, 1925, to the late Carl Merryman Nye and Edith Seabury Nye of Saint Paul, later of North Chatham (from 1947 until their deaths). She is survived by her two younger sisters, both in their nineties, Priscilla Nye \"Polly\" Dickson ’45 of North Chatham (formerly of Weston, MA), and Edith Nye \"Edie\" MacMullen ’47 of Amherst, MA (formerly of Clinton, CT and Weston, MA). She was predeceased by her husband of fifty-two years (until his death), Philip Hales \"Phil\" Suter, in 2003.\n\nBetsy graduated from the Summit School (for girls) in Saint Paul, which she attended for thirteen years, from kindergarten through the 12th grade. She then attended Vassar College for three years before graduating from Barnard College in 1951 with a major in art history. Between Vassar and Barnard, she lived and worked in Cambridge, Massachusetts where she met her husband then at the Harvard Law School, and she traveled to Europe, sailing in both directions aboard so-called \"student ships,\" luxury liners which had been converted to troop ships during the Second World War, then to ships for young people eager to tour Europe after the War.\n\nBetsy was married on September 1st, 1951 at the Church of the Holy Spirit in South Orleans, Massachusetts. She and her husband spent the first several years of their marriage in Brattleboro and Dummerston, Vermont, where he began his law career. In 1955 they moved to Concord, Massachusetts, which was to become their home for the rest of their lives, after his career took him to Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nFour children ensued throughout the 1950's, all of whom survive their parents: Philip Nye \"Phil\" Suter of Peterborough New Hampshire, Elizabeth Suter \"Libby\" Bohanon of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Bradley R. \"Brad\" Suter of Melvin Village, New Hampshire, and Emily Suter Ransford of Carbondale, Colorado. Betsy is also survived by six grandchildren, Charles Nye \"Charley\" Suter of Belmont, New Hampshire, Philip Bradley \"Brad\" Suter of Wakefield, Massachusetts, Angus John Bohanon of Boulder, Colorado, Kelsey Hales Bohanon of Golden, British Columbia, Canada, Jesse Kassler Ransford and Carly Suter Ransford, both of Carbondale, Colorado, numerous nieces and nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews, and her Maine Coon cat, Henry.\n\nThe Suter family were members of Trinity Episcopal Church in Concord, where Betsy volunteered as a Sunday School Teacher for about ten years, mostly during the years, mostly in the 1960s, that her children were students there. She and husband Phil joined the TAGs (Trinity Adult Group), and Betsy joined the Altar Guild, of which she was a member for over fifty years, until her death. Betsy volunteered, for many years, to help sort and sell the books donated to the church for its annual \"Fayre.\" Betsy was especially proud, in retrospect, that she let herself be talked in to donating the current church sign outside the Sanctuary in memory of husband Phil, which sign has become in recent years another of the symbols of the parish.\n\nIn Green Valley, Arizona, Betsy was a member and volunteer, in the office and for their annual Tour of Homes fund-raiser, of St. Francis in the Valley Episcopal Church.\n\nBetsy also volunteered at the Alcott Elementary School in Concord from 1967 to 1969, when her children were students there, as a member of the Alcott-Ripley PTA.\n\nThe Suters were members of the Concord Country Club and the Chatham Yacht Club, both of which Betsy remained a member until her death, and Betsy was also a long-time member of the Garden Club of Concord, also until her death.\n\nBetsy's first volunteer job was as the first-ever volunteer at Emerson Hospital in Concord, as a member of the Junior League of Boston (Concord area), which had undertaken to provide volunteers among its members, though Emerson had not previously used any volunteers at all. Betsy was also involved in the Junior League's project on the Lyman House (The Vale) of Waltham.\n\nBetsy was an active member, committee chairman and member of the board of the League of Women Voters in Concord, involved in many of their projects. She also served on the board of the Vassar Club of Boston from 1964 to 1970.\n\nShe was also persuaded by a neighbor to join a new mental health organization founded by Abigail Adams Eliot of Concord (originally of Boston), later the Walden Guidance Association. From 1963 until 1979, she served as a volunteer, then soon on the board, as secretary, and finally as president. As president, she rebuffed an overture from Emerson Hospital to merge with it. In 1979, she served on the board and as president of the Concord Area Mental Health Center.\n\nFinally, Betsy turned her attention to interests closer to her heart, and volunteered at the Concord Antiquarian Society when the Society (now the Concord Museum) was just starting to use volunteers. Soon, the volunteers formed the Ladies' Committee, of which Betsy was a member, to better organize themselves. She volunteered: in the Museum Shop from when that was in a closet; arranging flowers from when that was done out of another closet; as a part-time docent; and for numerous fund-raising events, for many years.\n\nIn Chatham, Betsy was for many years a docent in the Stallknecht Mural Barn at the Atwood Museum, conducting numerous tours, though rarely mentioning during them that it was her mother who played an instrumental role, commemorated by a plaque and portrait of her mother at the now less often used entrance to the Mural Barn, in securing the murals and barn for the Museum.\n\nAs extensive as these various volunteer jobs and board positions were, however, Betsy was most proud of her job of many years for which she was paid, from 1968, as a part-time research assistant to the late Margaret Henderson Floyd, architectural historian, engaged primarily on an architectural survey of Weston MA when Mrs. Floyd was Chairman of the Weston Historical Commission, and on research for a book on John Hubbard Sturgis, prominent 19th century Boston architect, which resulted in an unpublished manuscript by Mrs. Floyd. Betsy was an occasional lecturer on architectural history, her greatest passion which began to eclipse her interest in art history even during her college years.\n\nBetsy was proud to be descended from the Nyes of the Benjamin Nye Homestead in East Sandwich, Massachusetts, John and Priscilla Alden of the Mayflower and Plymouth Colony fame, and Samuel Seabury, the first Episcopal bishop of the new United States, who has recently regained some renown by appearing, briefly, in the modern musical Hamilton. Betsy's interest in her heritage eventually led her to research it by traipsing through graveyards and Town Halls, husband Phil in tow, in search of ancestors, preparatory to joining the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Massachusetts, soon serving on its board. Betsy was also a member of the Chilton Club of Boston.\n\nBetsy enjoyed sailing with various family members in Chatham, and cruising with a group of Marshall Catboat owners from Chatham with husband Phil aboard their 18' Marshall Catboat, which they named \"Saunterer\" after a quotation from Henry David Thoreau about the value of sauntering, an apt description of their cruising style, and which is still owned by the family.\n\nBetsy also enjoyed skiing and especially tennis, which she played weekly, year-round, well into her eighties. She traveled extensively throughout her life, especially to Europe and the Caribbean, but also to Asia, Africa, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Alaska and throughout North America.\n\nA lover of animals, miniatures, games, children's toys, books, traditional furniture and furnishings, a good time, humor, good grammar, good causes and chocolate, among many other things, Betsy was well-liked and attracted many friends throughout her life. Her own assessment of her long life she summed up, in a typically self-deprecating manner, with a quote which she attributed to Garrison Keillor, a fellow St. Paul Minnesotan: \"It's been an ordinary life. And it's good enough, it's good enough.\"\n\nJohn T. Tate, a mathematician who explained many fundamental ideas in the theory of numbers, many of which now bear his name, and who won the 2010 Abel Prize, a top math award modeled after the Nobels, died on Oct. 16 at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 94.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Harvard University, where he taught for many years.\n\nNumber theory is, in large part, the study of finding solutions to equations that cast insight into the fundamental properties of integers. But instead of solving equations one by one, theorists like Dr. Tate look for underlying patterns in similar equations and develop tools to tackle them.\n\n“Tate is really the person who laid the big bricks in that theory,” said Kenneth A. Ribet, a mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former a graduate student of Dr. Tate’s.\n\nFor example, Fermat’s Last Theorem, a seemingly simple statement made by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637, is a problem of number theory. Fermat asserted that equations of the form aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ do not have solutions when n is an integer greater than 2 and a, b and c are positive integers.\n\nDr. Tate did not play a direct role in coming up with a proof. That was done in the 1995 by Andrew Wiles, then at Princeton University.\n\n“John would deny he had any role in it,” said John H. Coates, an emeritus mathematics professor at the University of Cambridge in England who was a colleague of Dr. Tate’s at Harvard in the early 1970s and who later served as Dr. Wiles’s thesis adviser at Cambridge. “He was very modest, but nevertheless some of his ideas are lurking behind that.”\n\nReference to Dr. Tate’s results appear throughout Dr. Wiles’s proof, beginning on the second page.\n\nDr. Tate laid the groundwork for a wide range of abstract but fundamental concepts that now bear his name, among them the Tate module, the Tate curve, the Tate cycle, the Hodge-Tate decompositions, the Tate cohomology, the Serre-Tate parameter, the Lubin-Tate group, the Tate trace, the Shafarevich-Tate group and the Néron-Tate height.\n\n“The list goes on and on,” the Abel Prize committee said in its citation honoring Dr. Tate in 2010. “Many of the major lines of research in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry are only possible because of the incisive contribution and illuminating insight of John Tate. He has truly left a conspicuous imprint on modern mathematics.”\n\nIn an interview published in Notices of the American Mathematical Society after he won the Abel, Dr. Tate, as modest as ever, still talked of himself as unexceptional. He noted that he had initially studied physics in graduate school, because he had read a book about some of the great mathematicians in history and “I knew I wasn’t in their league.”\n\n“I thought,” he continued, “that unless I was, I wouldn’t really be able to do much in mathematics. I didn’t realize that a less talented person could still contribute effectively.”\n\nJohn Torrence Tate was born in Minneapolis on March 13, 1925. His father, also named John Torrence Tate, was a professor of physics at the University of Minnesota; his mother, Lois (Fossler) Tate, was a high school English teacher. Tate graduated from St. Paul Academy in 1942. While in college at Harvard, he volunteered for a naval officer training program in which he learned meteorology and did mine-sweeping research.\n\nHe graduated from Harvard in 1946 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. He was discharged from the Navy the same year without ever having stepped on a ship.\n\nHe then started graduate school at Princeton. “Since my father was a physicist, that field seemed more human and accessible to me,” Dr. Tate recalled in the American Mathematical Society interview, “and I thought that was a safer way to go, where I might contribute more.”\n\nAfter one term he realized that his true interest was mathematics and switched departments, completing his doctoral degree in 1950. In his thesis, Dr. Tate recast a 1920 finding by the German mathematician Erich Hecke, and though it did not prove a new result, it opened up new avenues of inquiry for other mathematicians.\n\n“Tate gave it an entirely new spin,” said Benedict Gross, a mathematician at the University of California, San Diego, and another of Dr. Tate’s graduate students. “It was really a fundamental reformulation.”\n\nDr. Tate published relatively few papers, but the ones he did publish were clear and concise and held fundamental findings. “When he finished thinking about a subject, it was understood,” Dr. Gross said. “There were no loose ends lying around.”\n\nAfter completing his doctorate, Dr. Tate worked as a research assistant and an instructor at Princeton and then as a visiting professor at Columbia. He became a professor at Harvard in 1954 and remained there for 36 years. He moved to the University of Texas in 1990 and retired in 2009. He returned to Harvard as an emeritus professor.\n\nDr. Tate’s honors included the American Mathematical Society’s Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 1995. In 2002, he shared the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nDr. Tate married Carol Perpente in 1988. She survives him, as do three daughters, Jennifer Tate, Valerie Clausen and Amanda Tine; six grandchildren; and one great-grandson. His first marriage, to Karin Artin, ended in divorce.\n\nDr. Tate relished the beauty of mathematics but realized it was not something that could be easily shared with those not in his field.\n\n“Unfortunately it’s only beautiful to the initiated, to the people who do it,” he said in the American Mathematical Society interview. “It can’t really be understood or appreciated much on a popular level the way music can. You don’t have to be a composer to enjoy music, but in mathematics you do.\n\n“That’s a really big drawback of the profession. A non-mathematician has to make a big effort to appreciate our work; it’s almost impossible.”\n\nWilliam Frederick Menold, Jr., better known as “Buzz,” passed peacefully at age 75 after a six-year battle with Leukemia on Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020 at his home in Burke, Virginia. He was a loving husband and father who dedicated 47 years service to his country.\n\nHe grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, attended St. Paul Academy and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1966. He majored in Journalism, where he sharpened his natural abilities of perception, interpretation, analysis and concise communication. His keen intellect and endless curiosity made him a prolific reader of history, the arts, music, film and even pop culture. Throughout his life, his family and coworkers relied on his counsel to solve life challenges or refine policy positions.\n\nHe met Mary Jo, his wife of 52 years, while he was in the University of Minnesota’s Air Force ROTC program and she was in the Angel Flight. They married Sept. 2, 1967 and embarked on a seven-year career in the Air Force. He started as Intelligence Officer in Offutt AFB, NB, where his sons Christopher and Daniel were born. He volunteered for a one-year deployment to Nakhom Phanom AB, Thailand, where he provided unit level Intelligence support to OV-10 Forward Air Controllers during the Vietnam War. His next assignment was to the Pacific Air Force Headquarters, Hickam AFB, Hawaii, where his daughter Jessica was born and many lifelong family friendships were developed. He broadened his career by becoming a Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Crew Commander at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. The tour was cut short in early 1975 when he was hired by the State Department and he began his career as a Foreign Service Officer.\n\nHis initial assignment in Washington D.C. was with the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency delegation working conventional arms control in Europe. In 1977 our family moved to the Bonn, Germany embassy compound on the banks of the Rhine river. When he was not working Berlin policy with our Western Allies, he took our family on trips, exposing us to different cultures, languages, historic cities, castles and beautiful country sides.\n\nFrom 1979-1983, he returned to Washington D.C. where he started his career-long focus as a Political-Military Officer involved with arms control policy and negotiations. At the Office of the United Nations (UN) Political Affairs, he served on delegations to the UN General Assembly. He moved to the Office of NATO affairs where he formulated policy on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces in Europe.\n\nHe was assigned as the Political Military Officer at The Hague, Netherlands from 1983-1986. He successfully helped secure the agreement of the Dutch government to base U.S. cruise missiles as part of NATO’s security strategy. It was a particularly sensitive issue in the context of cold war tensions and a rising anti-nuclear sentiment across Europe. This overseas assignment also had a lasting positive impact on his children, who were in their influential teen and pre-teen years. His family all remember this time fondly.\n\nHe returned to Washington from 1986-1991, holding three positions. As the Deputy Head of the Multilateral Affairs Desk, Office of Soviet Affairs, he prepared postion papers, planned and executed numerous US-Soviet ministerial meetings and served two rounds in bilateral working groups for the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START). He was a senior watch officer, then became the Officer in Charge, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) affairs, where he guided US-FRG dialogue leading to agreements on German reunification.\n\nHis last overseas assignment as the Acting Chief of the Embassy Moscow Arms Control Implementation Unit in 1992-1994 was particularly eventful. He supported nuclear weapon inspection visits and worked with Russian Government Agencies to develop programs for the safe dismantlement of Russian nuclear weapons. He got to inspect Russian missiles bigger than the ICBM he once crewed in the Air Force, and visited vast underground tunnels at the Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site. It was a time of instability after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. On the morning of Oct. 4, 1993 he watched tanks roll a few blocks past their apartment, take positions before the White House (Parliament) and begin firing during the Russian Constitutional Crisis.\n\nHe returned to Washington D.C. in the Office of Regional Nonproliferation to represent the State Department in interagency nuclear smuggling sub-working group, designed the US approach to the 1996 Moscow nuclear summit, and designed and ran the interagency nuclear smuggling incident response group. In November 1997 he retired as a Foreign Service Officer and was hired as a State Department Civil Service Employee.\n\nIn his civil service time, he helped secure signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and coordinated bureau policy on negotiations for a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. During his years at the State Department in Washington, he was a delegate to numerous UN General Assembly and other international meetings concerned with arms control, disarmament, and nuclear nonproliferation. His organizational skill and writing ability led him to be chosen frequently as Executive Secretary of these delegations. He also served as point man for the US Government’s consideration of nuclear weapon-free zones, another approach to the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation. In all these activities he earned the respect of his colleagues for his intelligence, hard work, and unflappability. In 2015 he retired to focus on his health.\n\nFor the last six years, he demonstrated courage, hope, dedication and perseverance as he endured challenging medical treatments. His fighting spirit gained him time to build more precious memories and to share joyful experiences with his family. We celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary, a baptism and numerous family holidays. One short week before his passing, he shared a wonderfully warm and grateful dinner surrounded by his loved ones.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Dr. William Frederick Menold, Sr. and Jean Shirley (Johnson) Menold. He is survived by his wife Mary Jo (Martin) Menold and his children Christopher (wife Caroline and daughter Madeline), Daniel (wife Deanna) and Jessica (husband Jon, son William and daughter Hannah). He was a wonderful, loving husband and father, and he will be celebrated in our hearts forever.\n\nBetty Wold Johnson, matriarch of the Johnson Family and a renowned philanthropist, died peacefully on May 5. She was 99. Mrs. Johnson, or Betty as she liked to be called, was one of the most celebrated philanthropists of her generation, supporting many Princeton and New York arts and science institutions, including the McCarter Theatre, the Nature Conservancy of New Jersey, the Liberty Science Center, the Arts Council of Princeton, the Princeton Public Library, the New York City Opera, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lincoln Center. In 2008, she donated $11 million to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the single largest individual gift in the Newark arts center's history. She was drawn to the arts because, as she put it, they \"feed the spirit.\" Betty also supported many health organizations, funding the rebuilding of Princeton Hospital and, through Project Renewal, supported aid to the homeless and programs providing mobile health services to those in need.\n\nShe was conscious of the need to promote the health of her community following a legacy which had started with the Johnson family years before. \"There was a generosity about her spirit that you don't see often, particularly in philanthropy,\" said her son, Woody Johnson, currently the United States Ambassador to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \"But she was very careful and very savvy in that she would say, 'I'll match whatever you give.' She signed every check. I learned so much from my mother. She was correct 99.9 percent of the time, starting from my earliest memories.\" She viewed philanthropy as her job, running an organization's Board meetings like any seasoned CEO. She was intellectually curious. When offered novel ideas, she looked to find ways to put those ideas into practice. Unlike so many philanthropists, Mrs. Johnson preferred to give anonymously. She cared more about being able to help an organization raise more money than being able to promote herself. She recognized that others would be interested in funding high profile projects but few are likely to support cleaning the carpets and mending the drapes. Her gifts were significant but were largely unknown except to the recipients.\n\nUnderstanding her innate humility, but insisting on providing her with recognition, the nursing school at UMDNJ proudly displayed the plaque they had placed in the basement. It read, \"Betty's Boiler Room\". Ken Farber, president of the Lupus Research Alliance, met Mrs. Johnson in the mid 1980s, when he was executive of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Mrs. Johnson was a generous donor. She later recruited him to head the Lupus Research Alliance, after a granddaughter developed the condition. \"The Johnson family got us going with multi-million dollar gifts,\" Mr. Farber recalled. \"Then quietly, Betty made an additional personal gift of over 50 million dollars.\"\n\nDuring World War II, she enlisted in the Navy's WAVE (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She was stationed in Corpus Christi, TX and helped train young fighter pilots in flight simulators at Rhode Island's Naval Air Station. During the war she met and married Robert Wood Johnson III, the grandson of Robert Wood Johnson, founder of the Johnson and Johnson Company. They had five children before his death in 1970 at age 50.\n\nIn 1978, she married Douglas Bushnell. In addition to her charm and graciousness, she was a noted beauty. \"She always looked great,\" said Woody. \"She always got dressed at 8am and came downstairs fully dressed, even when she was 99. The only day she didn't do that was the Monday before she died.\" She had an inner fortitude that saw her through many of life's challenges. Even at her advanced age, she would insist upon walking across a large parking lot rather than be dropped off at the door. Woody attributes it to her midwestern roots. \"She had that hearty Minnesota attitude where you don't complain and you don't explain - you just carry on and get the job done,\" he said. \"She'd say, 'If you're cold, put your jacket on. If you're hot, take it off.' And that was about it.\" Another son, Christopher Johnson, the CEO of the New York Jets, agrees. \"When you live 99 years experiencing so many twists and turns of American history, you live through some interesting times, and unfortunately some tragic times,\" he said. \"The Depression and the death of her parents, three of her five children and two husbands. She would talk to my friends who had lost a child and help them through that. Somehow she knew how to help people through their grief.\"\n\nAlong with philanthropy and her family, she was a passionate lover of football. The game had always been part of her life; she spent her formative years listening to and attending Golden Gophers games with her father, Dr. Karl Christian Wold. \"She told me that every Saturday afternoon she sat on the couch with her father and listened, and later watched, University of Minnesota football games,\" said Neil Burmeister, who worked as a senior financial advisor to the family for over 40 years, and had weekly phone conversations with Mrs. Johnson, just to chat. When the option to buy the New York Jets arose, she was intrigued. \"I said, 'It will be fun for you,'\" Mr. Burmeister recalled. \"She said, 'No. It will hold the family together. We can all have a single purpose and we can go to the games together and the grandchildren will love it. I'll get to see them. It'll be glue for the family.'\" But the family didn't just include her biological relatives, it grew to include the team itself. Ms. Johnson used to refer to Jets players as her \"grandchildren.\" She was beloved by the coaches and the players, which was unique for someone in her position. \"When I found out that Mrs. Johnson had passed, I got really quiet and sad and had to take a moment and sit there for a little while,\" said former American football running back Curtis Martin, a New York Jet Hall of Famer. \"The ongoing joke was that she was my girlfriend. I've always thought of her as such a wonderful human being. Every time I went to a Jets game after I retired, I wanted to go up to the suite just to see her.\" Quarterback Josh McCown felt similarly, despite only having played for the Jets for two years. \"I appreciated how down to earth she was, and how easy it was to talk to her and how warm she made me feel,\" he said. \"I've experienced ownership groups who didn't talk to players. So, for her to interact and talk with us was a big deal. Given who she was and the status she had, her humility and graciousness was a big deal.\"\n\nDespite having friends of all ages and from all walks of life, she was proudly independent, living alone on her farm in Hopewell, New Jersey until the day she died. She drove a car until age 93 and stayed active by going to the gym and doing chores around the farm. \"I called up within the last two years and was told that she was out on the tractor mowing the fields,\" Christopher recalled with a laugh. \"A few months ago I called and was told she was at the gym - the local gym in town! \"She was still meeting with people until the Coronavirus lockdown,\" he added. \"With medical researchers, artists, musicians, environmentalists, trying to figure out ways to make the world a better place.\"\n\nAlong with her two sons, Mrs. Johnson is survived by 13 grandchildren. On her 99th birthday on January 31, she had one wish. \"I better live a long time because there's so much to do,\" she said. \"That wasn't the first time she said it,\" said Christopher. \"She's been saying this for a while. She knew there was no time to waste. And she didn't waste it.\"\n\nShirley Williams, Baroness Williams of Crosby, who has died aged 90 on April 12, 2021, was a liberal politician who was right at the heart of the profound ideological shifts in the political parties that began in the 1970s and arguably have still not been resolved today.\n\nAs one of the original ‘Gang of Four’ – the others were William Rodgers, David Owen and Roy Jenkins – she co-founded a new party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which for a brief moment looked like it might change the mould in the 1980s. It didn’t, but Williams remained a hugely influential and popular figure for many decades to come, unfussy and easy-going but robust and radical.\n\nShe was also consistent through turbulent times, which probably explains the relative position of the Labour party to her own beliefs. In the 1980s, she left Labour under Michael Foot because she said it was too left-wing, but in the 2000s, she criticised Labour under Tony Blair for being too right-wing and favourable to the free market.\n\nShe would have said it was the party that changed, not her, and certainly, she was guided by principles of social democracy that were founded in her radical childhood and remained intact with her for the rest of her life.\n\nThe radical principles came direct from her parents. Born Shirley Vivien Teresa Brittain Williams, her father, Sir George Catlin, was a political scientist and an unsuccessful Labour candidate, who would wheel Shirley to Labour meetings in a pram. Her mother was Vera Brittain, the prominent feminist and the celebrated author of Testament of Youth, the famous lyrical protest against the futility of the First World War.\n\nIt was a privileged childhood, with two live-in servants, but it was not necessarily easy. Vera was totally committed to her work and Shirley knew not to disturb her – “she was completely uninterruptible before 5pm unless there was a major fire,” Williams once said.\n\nWhen the war broke out, the young Shirley was then evacuated to Minnesota and was separated from her parents from the age of nine to 13. On her return, she was sent to a boarding school in London, which she hated.\n\nHer radicalism was already emerging though. She joined the Labour party at 16 – the earliest age you could do so – and became the Labour agent of Chelsea. She also worked a number of jobs, including land girl, and chambermaid, and while working as a waitress in Northumberland when she was 17, organised a strike and won higher wages for the staff.\n\nShe then won a scholarship to Oxford, where her interest in politics continued, and she became the first woman chairman of the University Labour Club. After university, having married fellow student Bernard Williams in 1955 – they had a daughter Becky – she worked for a brief time in journalism, on the Daily Mirror, before throwing herself into politics.\n\nShe stood twice for Labour in by-elections, in 1954 and 55, and then again in 1959 before eventually entering Parliament as MP for Hitchin in 1964. She was one of only 29 female MPs at the time and remembers going into the Ladies’ Room at the Commons to discover comfy sofas and an ironing board.\n\nShe was swiftly promoted to the lower ranks of government, although opinion was divided about her prospects. Some predicted that she could be the first female Prime Minister, but others thought at the time that her dishevelled and slightly disorganised appearance might work against her. Lady Astor, the first woman MP, is said to have told her: “You will never get anywhere in politics with hair like that.”\n\nShe began to make her mark, though. In 1966, as junior minister at the Ministry of Labour, she had to take over from Ray Gunter, the Secretary of State, when he fell ill, and dealt with the aftermath of the seamen’s strike. She is also remembered for her period as Education Secretary when she was responsible for the continuing implementation of comprehensive schools. She also served on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee between 1970 and 1981\n\nHowever, disillusionment with the party was setting in. Troubled by the leftward lurch of the movement she had belonged to pretty much her whole life, she quit to help form what was dreamed of as the all-conquering party of the centre ground. She felt she had no choice, but it meant she came to be reviled by the party’s left who denounced her as a traitor.\n\nFor a while, the prospects for the SDP looked very promising indeed. In 1981 Williams fought and won a by-election at Crosby to become the SDP’s first elected MP and the party was riding high in the polls. But after the Falklands War, Margaret Thatcher’s popularity recovered and Williams lost her seat in 1983.\n\nThe SDP project then collapsed amid recriminations and was subsumed into the Liberal Party which, through a series of name changes, finally became the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWilliams’ first marriage having collapsed, in the late 1980s she married Professor Richard Neustadt, a distinguished US academic and former adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Carter, and took up the post of Professor of Elective Politics in the John F Kennedy school of Government at Harvard University.\n\nShe became a life peeress in 1993 and sat in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat and continued to remain deeply immersed in the political scene. She said of herself that she had been “stuck with the same values for the last 50 years” but it was this consistency, delivered in a manner free of fuss or pomposity, that helped make her so popular.\n\nIn the autumn of 2004, she retired as the Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords and in her farewell speech to her party conference held out hope that the traditional divides of politics might yet change. “The mould may not yet be broken,” she said, “but the crack is dramatically widening.”\n\nBaroness Williams is survived by her daughter Rebecca.\n\nBelow is an article published about Stu Goldbarg:\n\nThe first few times Phyllis Beatty met Stuart Goldbarg he didn’t make that big of an impression.\n\nOne meeting she recalls happened in the bar at W.A. Frost and Co. in St. Paul. That evening, Beatty and her best friend were having what she describes as a “snacky dinner” when Goldbarg walked in, accompanied by a group of friends from a local Toastmasters club.\n\nBeatty’s best friend introduced her to Goldbarg, and later, she recalled her friend saying, “It’s really annoying. Every time I introduce you to him, you look like you’ve never met him before.” Beatty said she replied, with a laugh, “I guess he’s not that memorable.”\n\nLater that evening, Beatty struck up a conversation with Goldbarg. She made sure her friend noticed. “I didn’t want her accusing me of ignoring him again,” she said.\n\nFrom that point on, Beatty said that Goldbarg made up for his less-than-memorable first impression. Their conversation in the bar that night eventually blossomed into a romance, and the two married, living happily together for 37 years until he died Dec. 9, 2020 of COVID-19. Goldbarg was 73 years old.\n\nFor Beatty, the tragedy of her husband’s death was magnified by the fact that the virus’ highly transmissible nature meant that she couldn’t be by his side during his last days.\n\nFrom the moment he was transported by ambulance to Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Goldbarg and Beatty were separated. Restrictions set by the Minnesota Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention combined with severe PPE shortages meant that patients being treated for COVID could have no visitors in the hospital.\n\nAt first Goldbarg and Beatty spoke on the phone, but when doctors eventually put him on a respirator and he could no longer speak, the couple’s only communication was through one of two iPads available for use in the hospital’s busy ICU.\n\nFor Beatty, not being able to sit at Goldbarg’s bedside felt frustrating enough. Knowing that there were only two iPads available for all ICU patients felt tragic. While she wanted desperately to see her husband and hold his hand, she knew that there were many other families in the same situation.\n\n“I couldn’t go visit Stuart,” Beatty said. “My only communication was through the iPad. But there wasn’t always one available.” She said she never blamed hospital workers for the shortage: Nurses and other providers ran themselves ragged to make sure that every family had access to the technology. It’s just that two iPads can only go so far.\n\n“There was one day when I wanted to say goodnight to Stuart,” Beatty recalled. “It was 9 or 10 p.m. The iPad wasn’t available at the time. The nurse on duty said, ‘I will call you back in 10 minutes.’ He ran around the unit looking for the iPad and 10 minutes later he called me back on it. I was able to say goodnight.”\n\nThere were days when it looked like Goldbarg, who had lived with diabetes for several years, was going to pull through. But then his kidneys failed and his condition began to look dire. Through it all, Beatty knew she wanted to do something to show her appreciation for the providers who had worked so hard to care for him.\n\nShe thought about many ways to give thanks, but she kept coming around to one idea. She had been maintaining a CaringBridge site to keep friends and family updated on Goldbarg’s condition, and she decided to ask them to contribute to a fund so that they could help the hospital purchase more iPads to help patients in the ICU communicate with their loved ones.\n\n“I thought this might be a way of providing support for the nursing staff and the doctors,” Beatty said. Having more iPads available on the unit could perhaps lift a little of the immense burden that the pandemic had forced on providers.\n\nShe remembered the nurse who ran around the hospital that night to find an iPad so she could say goodnight to her husband. “Nurses are busy,” she said. “They shouldn’t have to put their attention to finding an iPad. They should always have one available when they need it.”\n\n‘Soulmates’\n\nOne of the things that Beatty admired most about her husband was the way he chose to live his life.\n\n“He took care to live intentionally and to not regret anything,” she said. “He really lived a full life,”\n\nGoldbarg’s idea of a full life didn’t include many of the traditional measures of success. “He didn’t put much stock in jobs,” Beatty said. “He was not driven by earning money. He was a writer of crime novels. He dabbled in antiquing. He was a deli manager. He didn’t really have a profession.” (In his own LinkedIn profile, Goldbarg described his career in a poetic manner, saying he had worked in “criminal law as an investigator and writer of ingenious briefs and appeals,” and added that he was, “intellectually adventurous with a wry sense of humor.”)\n\nDuring his funeral, which was livestreamed online, Beatty said that Goldbarg’s rabbi found a good word to describe him. “She used the term ‘renaissance,’” Beatty recalled. “That’s a word people throw out, but he really was a renaissance guy. He was creative, thoughtful, provocative and tender.”\n\nGoldbarg felt strongly that all people have a right to a safe and affordable home, and he was not afraid to act on this conviction. Beatty witnessed that belief in action many times.\n\n“One day, in the first five years of our marriage, Stuart met this guy who was homeless,” she said. “He asked me if it was OK if he stayed with us. I said, ‘If you think it is an important thing to do, then fine.’ He lived with us for three or four months, then he left.” Over the course of their long marriage, Goldbarg invited other people to stay with them, including a neighbor who’d broken up with his wife and had been booted out of the house.\n\n“That was part of Stuart’s way of being in the world,” Beatty said. “He was sensitive to other people’s troubles.”\n\nBeatty said that over the years she and Goldbarg enjoyed going on adventures, even when those adventures didn’t take them very far. “We loved to get in the car and just go somewhere,” she said. “It didn’t matter where we were going. We often didn’t have a destination. Sometimes we’d drive to Stillwater, head out on highway 61, cross over and head down 35 on the Wisconsin side of the river. We’d just flip a coin, go somewhere and hang out.”\n\nBeatty is clearly not a person prone to platitudes, but she paused and thought carefully before continuing. “People like to use the expression ‘soulmate,’” she said. “I don’t usually use that expression, but in talking with you now I’m thinking, I don’t know. Maybe Stuart and I were soulmates.”\n\nOne way to say thank you\n\nDuring Goldbarg’s hospital stay, his isolated death and the lonely days that followed, Beatty felt driven to say thank you to all the hospital workers who cared for him while she could not.\n\nOne of those people was Paula Skarda, M.D., Goldbarg’s primary care physician of 25 years and a hospitalist at Regions. Skarda was on duty at the hospital one day when she saw that Goldbarg was in the ICU. She took over his care, and called Beatty with regular updates.\n\nSkarda said she witnessed how the iPads helped the couple communicate when they were forced to be apart: “Every day while Stuart was in the hospital, Phyllis would call in on the iPad and just read to him, which was quite touching. She’d say goodnight and then do it again the next day.”\n\nSkarda said that Beatty told her she wanted to do something to thank providers for their hard work. “She was one of those people who was constantly asking how they could help us,” she recalled. “You feel horrible for these families. You are able to be there all the time and yet they are not. Stuart was gravely ill and Phyllis would say to me, ‘What can I do for the staff?’”\n\nBeatty explained that her focus on thanking hospital staff came from her sincere gratitude that they were willing to step in and care for her husband when she couldn’t. “Who else could love him?” Beatty asked. “I couldn’t be there.” In her absence, she said, nurses and doctors “brought really tender, loving care to Stuart.”\n\nSkarda said she knew she wanted to be there to support her longtime patient and his wife. In difficult moments, she did her best to bridge the gap forced by visitation rules. Beatty told her she appreciated all she was doing for her husband.\n\n“Phyllis would say to me, ‘It is OK because you’re holding his hand today,’” Skarda said. “It is heartbreaking because you don’t want to be the one holding his hand. You want it to be his wife.”\n\nWhen it became clear that Goldbarg was going to die, Beatty asked his rabbi to perform vidui, a prayer of confession offered by a rabbi on behalf of the person as death approaches. The rabbi couldn’t be there in person, but the hospital allowed Beatty in for the ritual. She and Skarda sat together at his bedside.\n\nIt the prayer was done over the iPad. Skarda said. “It didn’t feel cheap. It actually felt intimate and genuine. It was Phyllis, myself and Stuart. The rabbi was on the iPad.”\n\nOn Goldbarg’s CaringBridge site, Beatty let his many friends and family members know about her plans and how they could contribute to the iPad fund. “I put it out there that this need existed,” she said. “There was a very large CaringBridge community. People said, ‘I’d contribute to that,’ and all of the sudden the checks started coming in.”\n\nOnce she’d collected the donations, Beatty presented them to staff at the Regions Hospital Foundation. Julie Schimelpfenig, director of major and planned giving for the foundation, said that the funds raised went to buy four iPads for the hospital’s ICU. Beatty wasn’t the only grateful family member who raised money for technology, she added: Before the pandemic hit, Regions had no iPads. Today there are 43, and every clinical unit in the hospital has at least one iPad that can be used to connect patients with family members.\n\n“I think a patient and their families receive a deep level of satisfaction when they can give back,” Schimelpfenig said.\n\nBeatty said she is pleased that a group of people who loved Goldbarg were able to do something that will help others stay connected to their loved ones.\n\nHer husband, she said, “was an ordinary guy who lived an ordinary life in an ordinary house with an ordinary wife. He was not exceptional, not a gold-medal winner or a Pulitzer Prize-winner or even a Ph.D.”\n\nBut being ordinary doesn’t mean a person can’t have an impact on the world.\n\n“Over time, ordinary people do extraordinary things,” Beatty said. When she gave her gift to the hospital, she said she wanted to make that clear: “Ordinary people need to know that they can make a difference, that there are extraordinary ways to contribute.”\n\nEnglish professor, writer, family man, known for his scholarly interest in ideas (which often came with strong opinions), his adventurous spirit, and his humor, kindness, and generosity, died on December 1st, 2021, in St. Paul, surrounded by his family.\n\nPiers was born December 13, 1930, first child of Georgiana (Ingersoll), a descendant of pioneering St. Paul and Red Wing families (Ingersolls, MacLarens, Densmores), and Herbert Lewis, the crusading editor of the Pioneer Press and Dispatch from 1949 to 1964. The elder Lewis played a key role in transforming St. Paul from a mob-ridden sanctuary for crooks, conmen and corrupt public officials into a model of good government. Piers credited his parents with his curiosity about the world, his social conscience, and his love of language. Much of Piers Lewis's life was spent defying conventional standards and expectations, and questioning received wisdom. He loved reasoned debate about words, ideas, and politics. Though at times he could be less than diplomatic, he possessed a rare ability to admit fault, to be persuaded by new information or a well-presented argument, and to laugh at himself. He approached the world with a skeptical but open mind. For those close to him, there never was a more delighted laugh, a warmer, more unreservedly generous, compassionate, and loyal heart. A bricoleur, he was fond of improvising fixes and accomplishing anything he could with come-alongs, wire, duct tape. He loved Cuban cigars, fly fishing, baseball, Fellini, WB Yeats, The Magic Flute, Don Quixote, New Orleans jazz, animals, good scotch, chess, photography, cooking dinners for everyday and large family gatherings, and spending time among his clan at the cabin his grandparents built on the St. Croix River. In the 1950s, he rode a motorcycle with sidecar across Europe with his sister and brother; he took part in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s March on Washington in 1963; exchanged love poems with his wife every Valentine's Day; wrote Shakespearean Questions, a book of essays for the common reader interested in Shakespeare; taught himself to dive from a high cliff into the sea; and took down a deer as a first time bow-hunter in his 70s. As an adolescent and young man, he worked for the Great Northern railroad as a gandy dancer in North Dakota; in an assembly line that stamped out refrigerator doors; and mucking out barns at the State Fair.\n\nAt the age of 15, Piers traveled alone from St. Paul to the Northwest Territories and worked on one of the last two sternwheelers on the Mackenzie River as it transported freight to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic coast. Piers graduated from St. Paul Academy in 1949, where he was a top student and played football, wrestled, and was a champion marksman and captain of the rifle team. He went on to Amherst College, where he studied philosophy, mathematics, and literature. He received a Ph.D in English Literature from Harvard in 1954. He won a Fulbright to study at Cambridge University, served in the U.S. Army in Germany, and taught English literature, first at Wellesley College, then at Bemidji State University, and finally at Metropolitan State University. In 1983-84 Piers taught at Hebei University in Baoding, PRC. Piers met the love of his life, Katherine Greene, at a spaghetti dinner he hosted with his roommates while at Harvard. She had recently returned from the Middle East and he overheard her talking about it; he was struck by the sound of her voice, her wit and adventurousness. Piers and Kathy raised four children. At a time when men who participated in caregiving were the rare exception, Piers was a hands-on father, sharing equally in changing, bathing, feeding and soothing their children. In grade school, college, graduate school, and in all of the institutions where Piers taught, he made lasting friendships. The people who counted Piers a friend and source of thoughtful conversations included the contractors, tree cutters, house painters, road graders and handymen he hired, as well as neighbors, colleagues, former students, and his adult childrens' friends. After he retired in 1995, wanting to read the Iliad and the Odyssey in their original language, he enrolled in Ancient Greek at the University of Minnesota. He also returned to studying what he called his \"first love,\" mathematics. When he was 73, he decided to get his first tattoos, including the names and birthdates of his grandchildren on his forearm. As some grandparents pull photographs from wallets, Piers pulled up his sleeve. He was not only an adoring husband, father, father-in-law, and grandfather, he was also a second father and mentor to many nieces and nephews. If anyone asked for his help, he was ready to provide what he could: rides to or from the airport, money to come home, letters of support, a place to land, a shoulder to lean on. He provided a sense of safety and reassurance that the world is an OK place, as long as you have love and family. Piers died just shy of his 91st birthday, after a decline of several years from Alzheimer's disease. When so much had been lost, he retained his humor and deep attachment to his family, as well as an ear for poetry and music.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Herbert L. and Georgiana \"Georgie\" (Ingersoll) Lewis, and four dear first cousins, Janey Washburn '41, Bruce Ingersoll '59, Laura Ingersoll Johnson, and Alan Summersby Emmet. Piers is survived by his wife of 61 years Katherine G.; children Benjamin Lewis '79 (Krishnakali), Georgeanna Lewis '83 (Sean Toren), Katherine '86, and Rebecca; sister Georgiana \"Genna\" Anderson '51, and brother H. Finlay Lewis '56 (Willee); grandchildren Rohan Lewis and Bruno Toren; first cousins Ed Summersby (Judy) and Brenda Ingersoll; and many nieces and nephews, grand nieces and nephews, and cousins; in-laws Tom and Margaret Greene and Fred and Ellie Horlbeck and their children and grandchildren; and former student and honorary family member, Ping Wang (Steve King)."
