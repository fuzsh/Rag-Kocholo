        "text": "The Ottawa Senators, officially the Ottawa Hockey Club (Ottawa HC), was an amateur, later becoming a professional, men's ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 1883[4] to 1954 and a member of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1917 to 1934. The club had several nicknames, such as the Generals in the 1890s, Silver Seven from 1903 to 1907 and the Senators dating from 1912.[5]\n\nGenerally acknowledged by hockey historians as one of the greatest teams of the early days of the sport, the club won numerous championships, starting with the 1891 to 1893 Ontario championships. Ottawa HC played in the first season during which the Stanley Cup was challenged in 1893, and first won the Cup in 1903, holding the championship until 1906 (the Silver Seven years). The club repeated its success in the 1920s, winning the Stanley Cup in 1920, 1921, 1923 and 1927 (the Super Six years). In total, the club won the Stanley Cup eleven times, including two challenges during years it did not win the Cup for the season. In 1950, Canadian sports editors selected the Ottawa HC/Senators to be Canada's greatest team in the first half of the 20th century.[6]\n\nThe club was a member of several leagues during its lifetime, as disputes were usually resolved by the closing of one league and opening of another. The club played matches in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, from 1886 to 1898, the Ontario Hockey Association from 1890 to 1894 and the Canadian Amateur Hockey League from 1899 until 1904, when it withdrew over a dispute and played independently. The club then played in the Federal Amateur Hockey League for one year before helping to start the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) in 1906. They were members until 1910, when that league dissolved. In 1910, the Senators were briefly members of the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), before joining the National Hockey Association (NHA). The NHA itself dissolved in 1917, and Ottawa became one of the founding four teams of the National Hockey League (NHL). The club competed in the NHL from the 1917–18 season until the 1933–34 season. The NHL franchise relocated to St. Louis, Missouri due to financial difficulties and became the St. Louis Eagles. The organization continued the Senators as a senior amateur, and later semi-professional, team in Quebec senior men's leagues until 1954.\n\nTeam history[]\n\nEarly amateur era (1883–1902)[]\n\nAfter witnessing the 1883 Montreal Winter Carnival Ice Hockey Tournament, Halder Kirby, Jack Kerr and Frank Jenkins founded the Ottawa Hockey Club.[7] The first organized ice hockey club in Ottawa, the Ottawa Hockey Club had no other clubs to play that season but held practices at the 'Royal Rink' starting on March 5, 1883.[1] Until 1902, the club was also known by the nickname \"Generals\", attributed to the club's insignia.[8] The club was affiliated with the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club and used its colours of red, white and black uniforms.[9] The club is also referred to as \"Capitals\" in literature, although there was a rival Ottawa Capitals club organized by the Capital Amateur Athletics Association active at the time.[8]\n\nThe club participated competitively in the following years at the 1884 and 1885 Montreal Winter Carnival Ice Hockey Tournaments, which was considered the Canadian championship at the time.[10] Future Ottawa mayor Nelson Porter is recorded as the scorer of the club's first-ever goal, at the 1884 Carnival.[1] Frank Jenkins was the first captain of the team; he later became the president of the Hockey Club in 1891 and the president of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada in 1892.[7]\n\nFormation of the AHAC\n\nThe Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHA or AHAC) was founded on December 8, 1886[12] at a meeting of representatives of several hockey clubs, Ottawa included. Mr. Thomas D. Green of Ottawa was named first President of the league.[12] Play was played in \"challenge series\" until 1893. Ottawa lost the one challenge it played in that first 1887 season to the Montreal Victorias.\n\nThe Club was inactive between 1887 and 1889 due to the loss of the Royal Rink, which converted to a roller skating rink, until the opening of the Rideau Skating Rink in 1889. One of the principal organizers was Ottawa Journal publisher P. D. Ross, who also played on the team. The captain was Frank Jenkins, and the other players were Halder Kirby, Jack Kerr, Nelson Porter, Ross, George Young, Weldy Young, Thomas D. Green, William O'Dell, Tom Gallagher, Albert Low and Henry Ami.[13]\n\nOHA Championships[]\n\nIn 1890, Ottawa HC was a founding member of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), and the team won the championship for its first three years. The first championship was played on March 7, 1891 at the Rideau rink and was won 5–0 by Ottawa over Toronto St. George's.[14] After the 1891–92 season, Lord Stanley announced his new Dominion Challenge Trophy for the Canadian champions at a dinner to honour the OHA champion Ottawa Hockey Club at the Russell Hotel in Ottawa.[15] Former player and president of the club, P. D. Ross, was selected by Stanley to be a trustee of the Cup.[16]\n\nThe 1891 championship was the only OHA final played in Ottawa, as Ottawa played the 1892 final in Toronto, defeating Osgoode Hall 4–2, and in 1893 the Toronto Granites defaulted by not appearing for the championship match scheduled for Ottawa. The club resigned from the OHA in February 1894 after the OHA refused the club's demand to have the 1894 final in Ottawa and ordered the Ottawa club to play the final in Toronto.[17] As of 2008, Ottawa and area teams remain unaffiliated with the OHA; the local association is the Ottawa District Hockey Association, a descendant of the Ottawa City Hockey League which was organized by Ottawa HC in 1890.\n\nRe-entry into the AHAC[]\n\nIn 1890–91, Ottawa HC returned to AHAC challenge play, and in 1891–92 won the Canadian championship (AHAC) and held it for most of the season, from January 10 until March 7, 1892. The club took the championship from the Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC), which was previously undefeated, and won five straight before losing 1–0 to Montreal in the last challenge. Montreal's win in the final challenge was their only win of the season and the only one in four against Ottawa.\n\nAt the suggestion of Lord Stanley (in the letter announcing the Stanley Cup), the AHAC changed to a round-robin type regular season format of play in 1892–93.[18] The key match-up in that season was a loss in the opening game of the season against the Montreal Victorias on January 7, 1893, as Ottawa split its season series with eventual winner Montreal HC, both teams otherwise winning all of their games. This loss provided the one game margin in the standings that led to Lord Stanley awarding the initial Cup to Montreal.[19]\n\nIn 1893–1894, the Ottawa HC finished in a four-way tie for first in the AHAC standings. A playoff was arranged in Montreal for the championship between Ottawa, Montreal HC and Montreal Victorias (the other first place club, Quebec, having dropped out of the playoff). This was the first Stanley Cup playoffs. Ottawa, as the 'away' team was given a bye to the final game. On March 23, 1894, at the Victoria Rink, Ottawa and Montreal HC played for the championship. Ottawa scored the first goal, but Montreal would score the next three to win the game 3–1. Ottawa captain Weldy Young fainted from exhaustion at the end of the game.[20]\n\nFor the period of 1894 to 1900, the club did not win the league championship, finishing as high as second several times, and fifth (last) once. For the 1896–97 season, the Ottawa club unveiled the first of their trademark 'barber-pole' style jerseys of horizontal bars of black, red and white. This basic style would be used by the club until 1954.\n\nIn 1898, the AHAC dissolved after the rival intermediate-team Ottawa Capitals of the CCHA applied and were approved by the league executive to join the AHAC. Ottawa, along with Montreal clubs and Quebec left the AHAC and formed the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), shutting out the Capitals.[21]\n\nIn 1901, the club won the CAHL league regular season title, its first league championship since winning the OHA in 1893. The club at first wished to challenge the Stanley Cup champion Winnipeg Victorias, but chose not to after deliberating for a week after the season. According to hockey historian Charles L. Coleman, it was due to the \"lateness of the season\".[22]\n\nNotable players of this period included A. Morel and Fred Chittick in goal, who led the league several times in goaltending, and future Hall of Famers Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith, Harry Westwick and brothers Bruce Stuart and Hod Stuart. The first reference to the nickname of Senators was in a game report of the Ottawa Journal on January 7, 1901.[23] However, from 1903 to 1906, the team was better known as the Silver Seven.\n\nSilver Seven era (1903–1906)[]\n\nThe first 'dynasty' of the Ottawa HC was from 1903 until 1906, when the team was known as the 'Silver Seven'.[24] The era started with the arrival of Frank McGee for the 1903 season and ended with his retirement after the 1906 season. Having lost an eye in local amateur hockey, he was persuaded, despite the threat of permanent blindness, to join the Senators. The youngest player on the team and standing 5'6\" tall, he went on to score 135 goals in 45 games. In a 1905 challenge against the Dawson City, he scored 14 goals in a 23–2 loss. He retired in 1906 at the age of 23.[25]\n\nIn the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and Montreal Victorias both finished in first place with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored 7 goals in one game and 6 in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score 5 goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on slushy ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by 3000 fans, was on ice coated with an inch of water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring 3 goals and the other 5 shared among the three Gilmours, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup.[26] This started a period in which the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906. For that first win, the team's players were paid \"under the table\" with silver nuggets, since the players were technically amateurs.[27] After this, the team gained the nickname of the Silver Seven (in those days, hockey teams iced seven men — a goaltender, three forwards, two defencemen and a rover).\n\nThe Silver Seven moved between three leagues during this time, and for a time was independent of any league. In February during the 1904 CAHL season, Ottawa resigned from the league in a dispute over the replaying of a game. The team had arrived late and the game had been called at midnight, with a tied score. The league demanded that the game be replayed. The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings. The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league, playing only in Cup challenges. Quebec won the championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup, but the Stanley Cup trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it. Quebec refused to play a challenge. The next season, Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), winning the league championship. The club was only in the FAHL for one season with new rival the Montreal Wanderers. For the 1906 season Ottawa, along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams, formed the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA).[28]\n\nStyle of play[]\n\nThe Silver Seven were well-known for the number of injuries that they inflicted on other teams. In a Stanley Cup challenge game in 1904, the Ottawas injured seven of the nine Winnipeg players, and the Winnipeg Free Press called it the \"bloodiest game in Ottawa.\"[29] The next team to challenge the Ottawas, the Toronto Marlboroughs, were similar treated. According to the Toronto Globe:\n\nThe style of hockey seems to be the only one known and people consider it quite proper and legitimate for a team to endeavor to incapacitate their opponents rather than to excel them in skill and speed ... slashing, tripping, the severest kind of cross-checking and a systematic method of hammering Marlboroughs on hand and wrists are the most effective points in Ottawa's style.[29]\n\nAccording to one player, the \"Marlboroughs got off very easily. When Winnipeg Rowing Club played here, most of their players were carried off on stretchers.\"[29] This style of hockey would continue for years to come.\n\nDawson City challenge[]\n\nFor more details on this topic, see 1904–05 FAHL season#Ottawa vs. Dawson City.\n\nThe Silver Seven participated in perhaps the most famous[30][31][32] Stanley Cup challenge of all, that of Dawson City of Yukon Territory in 1905. Dawson City had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted in the summer of 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel later, as he had to work in a federal election that December and meet the club in Ottawa.[33]\n\nTo get to Ottawa, several thousand miles away, the club had to get to Whitehorse by road, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904 several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330 mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.[34]\n\nDespite the difficult journey, the Ottawas refused to change the date of the first game, only two days away. Ottawa arranged hospitable accommodations for the Dawson City team. The Yukoners received a huge welcome at the train station, had a welcoming dinner, and used the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club's rooms for the duration of their stay. Young did not arrive in time to play for Dawson.[35]\n\nThe first game was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent. Norman Watt of Dawson tripped Ottawa's Art Moore, who retaliated with a stick to the mouth of Watt. Watt promptly knocked Moore out, hitting him on the head with his stick. The game ended 9–2 for Ottawa. The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners, who complained that several goals were offside.[36]\n\nAfter the game, Watt stated that Frank McGee was not as good as he was said to be, as he had only scored once in the first game.[37] McGee scored four goals in the first half of the second match and 10 in the second half, leading Ottawa to a 23–2 score. Despite this high score, the newspapers claimed that Albert Forrest, the Dawson City goalie had played a \"really fine game\", otherwise the score \"might have been doubled\". Ottawa celebrated by hosting Dawson at a banquet. After this, the players took the Cup and attempted to drop-kick it over the Rideau Canal. The stunt was unsuccessful, as the Cup landed on the frozen ice and had to be retrieved the next day.[36]\n\nStanley Cup Challenge win streak[]\n\nThe Ottawas were the dominant team for three years:\n\nThe end of the streak came in March 1906. Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for the ECAHA league lead in 1906, forcing a playoff series for the league championship and the Cup. Montreal won the first game in Montreal by a score of 9–1. In the return match, Ottawa replaced their goaltender Bouse Hutton and used goaltender Percy LeSueur, formerly of Smiths Falls. In the return match in Ottawa, Ottawa overcame the eight-goal deficit, getting a 9–1 lead to tie the series by the midway point of the second half. Harry Smith then scored to put Ottawa ahead, only to have the goal ruled offside.[38] It was then that Lester Patrick of the Wanderers took it upon himself, scoring two goals to win the series 12–10. This was Frank McGee's last game and he scored two goals.[39]\n\nThe players\n\nBesides McGee, future Hall of Fame players Billy Gilmour, Percy LeSueur, Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith and Harry Westwick played for the Ottawas. Alf Smith was also the coach. Other players of the 'Seven' included Arthur Allen, Dave Finnie, Arthur Fraser, Horace Gaul, Dave Gilmour, Suddy Gilmour, Bouse Hutton, Jim McGee, Art Moore, Percy Sims, Hamby Shore, Charles Spittal, Frank White and Frank Wood.\n\nThe club was able to continue the streak despite the death of one of its members. Jim McGee, Frank McGee's brother, died after the 1904 season in a horseback riding accident.[40] He was also the Ottawa Football Club's captain at the time.[41] The funeral cortege was estimated at a half-mile in length.[42]\n\nEarly professional era (1907–1917)[]\n\nTransition to professional (1907–1910)[]\n\nUntil the 1906–07 season, the players were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the principles of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed the players to play for the team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized.[43]\n\nThe period saw the rivalry between the Senators and the Wanderers continue, and at times it was brutally contested. On January 12, 1907 a full-scale \"donnybrook\" took place between the two teams at a game in Montreal. Charles Spittal of Ottawa was described as \"attempting to split Blachford's skull\", Alf Smith hit Hod Stuart \"across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse\" and Harry Smith cracked his stick across Ernie Johnson's face, breaking Johnson's nose.[44] The Wanderers won the game 4–2. Discipline was first attempted by the league at a meeting on January 18, in which the Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season, but this was voted down and the president of the league resigned.[44] The police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith on their next visit to Montreal, leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf Smith and an acquittal for Harry Smith.[44] The tactics did not work on the Wanderers; they won the return match in Ottawa in March and went undefeated for the season, leaving Ottawa in second place.[45]\n\nThe 1907–08 season was a season of turnover for Ottawa. Harry Smith and Hamby Shore left to join Winnipeg. Ottawa hired several free agents, including Marty Walsh, Tommy Phillips and Fred 'The Listowel Whirlwind' Taylor.[46] Taylor was hired away from the International Professional Hockey League (IHL) for the 1908 season for a $1000 salary and a guaranteed federal civil service job. He was an immediate sensation and earned a new nickname of 'Cyclone' for his fast skating and end-to-end rushes.[47] Walsh tied for the scoring lead with 28 goals in 9 games (including 7 in one match), while Phillips was close behind at 26 goals in 10 games. Ottawa moved into their new arena, dubbed The Arena, with seating for 4,500 and standing room for 2,500.[48] The capacity was topped with a crowd of 7,100 attending a game against the Wanderers on January 11, which Ottawa won 12–2. Ottawa started the season with two losses out of three games and ended in second place behind the Wanderers again.[49]\n\nIn 1908–09, the Eastern league became completely professional, leading to the retirements of several stars, including Harvey Pulford and Russell Bowie. The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union, leaving only Ottawa, Quebec, Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Shamrocks in the ECHA. It was another season of player turn-over for Ottawa. Besides Pulford, Ottawa lost Alf Smith, who formed a competing Ottawa Senators professional team in the Federal League, and Tommy Phillips, who joined Edmonton. The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers, Fred Lake from Winnipeg and Dubby Kerr from Toronto. This lineup had a successful season, winning 10 out of 12 games. Marty Walsh led all scorers with 38 goals in 12 games, while Stuart had 22 and Kerr had 20. The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March 3 in Ottawa, 8–3, as Ottawa won the league and Stanley Cup.[50]\n\nNotable players of this time period include future Hall of Famers Percy LeSueur in goal, Dubby Kerr, Tommy Phillips, Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith, Bruce Stuart, Fred Taylor and Marty Walsh.\n\nNational Hockey Association (1910–1917)[]\n\nThe 1909–10 hockey season saw major changes in the hockey world, as the remnants of the ECHA organization split and created two organizations, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and the National Hockey Association (NHA).[51] The CHA was formed to 'freeze out' the the Wanderers, whose ownership change led the team to move to a smaller arena. At the same time, millionaire businessman J. Ambrose O'Brien, who wanted his Renfrew Creamery Kings to challenge for the Stanley Cup, saw his Renfrew application to join the CHA rejected. Together with the Wanderers, O'Brien instead decided to form the NHA, and founded the Montreal Canadiens. The NHA became the fore-runner of today's National Hockey League.\n\nOttawa was one of the founders of the CHA and had helped to reject Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans had no interest in the league, Ottawa abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.[52]\n\nIt is during the NHA period that the nickname 'Ottawa Senators' came into common usage. Although there had been a competing Senators club in 1909, and there had been mention of the Senators nickname as early as 1901, the nickname was not adopted by the club.[5] The official name of the Ottawa Hockey Club remained in place until ownership changes in the 1930s.\n\nThe 1909–10 season was one of transition for Ottawa, as Fred Taylor defected to Renfrew. On his first return in February 1910, he made a promise to score a goal backwards against Ottawa. This led to incredible interest, with over 7,000 in attendance. A bet of $100 was placed at the King Edward Hotel against him scoring at all.[53] Ottawa won 8–5 (scoring 3 goals in overtime) and kept Taylor off the scoresheet. Later in the season at the return match in Renfrew, Taylor made good on his boast with a goal scored backwards. This was the final game of the season, and Ottawa had no chance at the league title and did not appear to have put in an effort in the 17–2 loss.[54]\n\nIn 1910–11, Ottawa gained revenge by defeating Renfrew 19–5. The team went 13–3 to win the NHA and inherit the Stanley Cup, with Marty Walsh and Dubby Kerr leading the goal scoring with 37 and 32 goals in 16 games. After the season Ottawa played two challenges, against Galt, winning 7–4, and against Port Arthur, winning 13–4. In the Port Arthur game Marty Walsh came close to matching Frank McGee's total, scoring ten goals.[55]\n\nThe 1911–12 through 1913–14 seasons saw a decline for both Ottawa and the Wanderers. After the withdrawal of O'Brien's Renfrew team in 1911, the two clubs fought over the rights to Fred Taylor, who wanted to return to Ottawa, where his fiance lived and he still had a government job. The NHA had given the Wanderers the rights to Taylor in a dispersal of the Renfrew players. Trade talks were unfruitful. Ottawa, insistent in their claim for Taylor, played him in one game for Ottawa against the Wanderers. The Senators won the game; however, Taylor was ineffectual.[56] The move backfired on the Senators, as the league ruled that the game could not stand and would have to be replayed. The Senators lost the replay and it was the difference in the league championship, as the defending champion Senators placed second by one game behind Quebec.[57] Quebec's Bulldogs won the only two Stanley Cup championships in the club's history that season and the next, and Toronto won in 1914. Taylor did not play in the NHA again, as he joined Vancouver in the off-season.[58]\n\nIn 1914–15, both Ottawa and the Wanderers bounced back to the top of league, tying each other for the NHA season title. This was also the season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4–1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup final playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast (PCHA) league. Former Senator Fred Taylor, now of the Millionaires, haunted his old team, scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three straight in Vancouver. Future Senator Frank Nighbor played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals.[59]\n\nIn 1915–16, the Senators placed second to eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens. Harry Broadbent left the team to fight in World War II, while Frank Nighbor joined the Senators in his place and became the team's leading scorer. Benedict led the league as the top goaltender for the first time.[60] Rat Westwick and Billy Gilmour of 'Silver Seven' days attempted comebacks but both returned to play only a few games before retiring for good.[61]\n\nIn 1916–17, the last season of the NHA, Ottawa won the second-half of the split schedule, notable because an Army team, the 228th Battalion, and Eddie Livingstone's Toronto Blueshirts both played in the first half and then withdrew. Benedict was the NHA's top goaltender once again, and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with 41 goals in 19 games.[62] Prior to the season, it was learned that Frank McGee had died while fighting in the war.[63]\n\nThe Ottawa Senators ended their play in the NHA by losing a two-game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens, who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup final. This season saw the final decline of Ottawa's old rivals, the Wanderers, who finished at the bottom of the standings. The next year, the Wanderers played only four games in the NHL, winning one and folding the franchise after their home arena burned down.[64]\n\nWhile World War I affected all the NHA teams, Ottawa, after signing Frank Nighbor from the PCHA, never finished worse than second during the war years.[65]\n\nStanley Cup champions in 1906 and 1910: Historians' debate[]\n\nDue to the 'challenge' format of Stanley Cup play before 1915, there is often confusion about how many Stanley Cups the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were Stanley Cup champions at the end of nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions at the end of the season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1906, Ottawa defeated OHA champions Queen's University and FAHL champions Smiths Falls in Stanley Cup challenges. However, Ottawa tied the Montreal Wanderers for the ECAHA regular season championship. To decide the ECAHA championship and the Stanley Cup, the Senators played a two-game total goals series against the Wanderers in March 1906 and lost. The 1906 hockey season ended with the Wanderers as the Stanley Cup champions. The Hockey Hall of Fame recognizes both Ottawa and the Wanderers as champions for that year,[66] as does the NHL.[67]\n\nIn January 1910, Ottawa defeated Galt, champions of the OPHL, during the CHA regular season, as well as Edmonton of the AAHA during the NHA regular season (the Senators switched leagues in-between). At the end of the season Ottawa gave up the Cup to the Montreal Wanderers, regular-season champions of the new NHA league. Unlike the 1906 case, the Hockey Hall of Fame does not recognize the Senators as champions for January 1910,[66] although the NHL does.[67]\n\nIn October 1992, at the first game of the current Ottawa Senators NHL club, banners were raised to commemorate Stanley Cups in nine seasons, excluding 1906 and 1910. In media guides published by the club, they listed the original Senators as nine-time winners.[68] This changed in March 2003, when the team raised banners for the 1906 and 1910 years to join the other nine banners hanging at the Corel Centre. The club and the NHL now list the original Senators as eleven-time winners.[67]\n\nNHL Years (1917–1934)[]\n\nAfter struggling through the war years, the Ottawa Hockey Association put the Club up for sale for $5,000 in the fall of 1917. Montreal Canadiens' owner George Kennedy was leading an effort to get rid of Toronto Blueshirts' owner Eddie Livingstone, and he needed the Senators in his corner. He loaned Ottawa Citizen sports editor Tommy Gorman (who also doubled as a press representative for the Canadiens) $2,500 to help buy into the Senators. Gorman, along with Martin Rosenthal and Ted Dey (owner of The Arena), bought the club. Gorman also attended the meeting at Montreal's Windsor Hotel in which the NHL was formed. Within a year, Gorman and partner Ted Dey had made enough money to pay back Kennedy. Gorman also attended the following year's meeting of the NHA owners in which the final vote to suspend the league was made.[69]\n\nIn 1917–18, the Senators lost their previous top rival, the Wanderers, after five games. The team struggled throughout the season. The Senators did not qualify for the playoffs, and the team finished in third place after the first half of the season, and second in the second half. Cy Denneny led the team, coming second overall in scoring in the league with 36 goals in 20 games.[70]\n\nIn 1918–19, the Senators won the second half of the split schedule. Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average, and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with 18 and 17 goals in 18 games, respectively. The schedule was abbreviated by the the Toronto Arenas club suspending operations, so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best-of-seven series. Due to a bereavement, Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three. Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto, but the Canadiens turned down the request.[71] Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa, which Ottawa won 6–3. The series ended in five games, as the Canadiens won the final match 4–2 to win the series.[72] The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Seattle was left undecided, as an influenza outbreak suspended the final.[73]\n\nPrior to the 1918–19 season, ownership of the Senators changed. While Ted Dey negotiated with Percy Quinn for a lease for The Arena, Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease, causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving the team from The Arena back to Aberdeen Pavilion. However, it turned out that Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL for the next five years and locking out any rival league from their arenas.[74]\n\nThe 'Super Six' (1920–1927)[]\n\nThe \"Super Six\"[75] Senators of the 1920s are considered by the NHL to be its first dynasty.[76] The club won four Stanley Cups and placed first in the regular season seven times.[76] The team's success was based on the timely scoring of several forwards, including Frank Nighbor and Cy Denneny, and a defence-first policy, which led to the NHL changing the rules in 1924 to force defencemen to leave the defensive zone once the puck had left the zone.[77] The talent pool in Ottawa and the Ottawa valley was deep; the Senators traded away two future Hall of Famers (Clint Benedict and Harry Broadbent) in 1924 to make way for two prospects (Alex Connell and Hooley Smith), who also become Hall of Famers.[78] Benedict and Broadbent led the Montreal Maroons to a playoff defeat of the Senators on the way to a Stanley Cup win in 1926.[79]\n\nIn the 1919–20 season, the NHL reactivated the Quebec Bulldogs NHA franchise; with this addition, the NHL played with four teams again. There were no playoffs, as Ottawa won both halves of the schedule, the undisputed NHL championship and the O'Brien Cup. Clint Benedict again led the goalkeeper averages, and Frank Nighbor came third in the scoring race with 25 goals in 23 games.[80]\n\nThe Senators then played the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup. Because Seattle's uniforms were nearly the same as Ottawa's, the Senators played in simple white sweaters for this series. The first three games were held in Ottawa and ended with scores of 3–2 and 3–0 for Ottawa and 3–1 for Seattle. At this point, the series was moved to the Arena Gardens in Toronto, which had an artificial ice rink. Seattle won 5–2 to tie the series. In the fifth and deciding game, Ottawa won 6–1 on Jack Darragh's three goal performance and won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL.[81] See the article 1920 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nIn the 1920–21 season, the Quebec Bulldogs moved to Hamilton. The Senators won the first half of the season to qualify for the playoffs. Benedict again led the goalkeeper averages, and Cy Denneny came second in scoring with 34 goals in 24 games. The Senators shut out Toronto 7–0 in a two-game total goals playoff and went west to play off against Vancouver for the Stanley Cup. Vancouver still had Cyclone Taylor, though it was near the end of his career and he scored no goals. Ottawa won a best-of-five series with scores of 1–2, 4–3, 3–2, 2–3 and 2–1, with Jack Darragh scoring the winning goal.[82] See the article 1921 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThe 1921–22 season saw the debut of Frank Boucher and Frank \"King\" Clancy for Ottawa and the retirement of Jack Darragh.[83] The Senators won the season but lost to eventual Stanley Cup winner Toronto St. Patricks 5–4 in a two-game total goals series. The series had the Boucher brothers play for Ottawa, while Cy Denneny played for Ottawa and his brother Corbett played for Toronto.[84]\n\nIn 1922–23, the Senators were led by the league's top goalie Clint Benedict, the goal scoring of Cy Denneny and the return from retirement of Jack Darragh.[85] The Senators won the regular season and took the playoff against the Canadiens 3–2 in a two-game total-goals playoff.[86]\n\nThe Cup Final playoff format had changed. There were semi-finals against the PCHA champion, followed by the final against the WCHL champion. In the Cup semi-finals, Ottawa again faced Vancouver (now known as the Maroons) in Vancouver. New attendance records were set during this series, with 9,000 for the first game and 10,000 for the second. Ottawa won the series with scores of 1–0, 1–4, 3–2, and 4–1, with Benedict getting the shutout and Harry Broadbent scoring five goals. The Senators next had to play Edmonton in a best-of-three series and won it in two games with scores of 2–1 and 1–0, with Broadbent scoring the winning goal.[87] The second game of the finals is famous for being the game in which King Clancy (then only a substitute for the team) played all positions, including goal.[88] See the article 1923 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThat year, club owners Dey and Gorman entered into a partnership with Frank Ahearn. Ahearn's family was well-off, owning the Ottawa Electric Company and the Ottawa Street Railway Company. Ted Dey then sold his share of the club and retired.[89] The first work of the partnership was a new arena, the Ottawa Auditorium, which was a 7,500 seat (10,000 capacity with standing room) arena with artificial ice. The new Ottawa Auditorium's first regular season game came on December 26, 1923. A crowd of 8,300 fans attended a game against the Canadiens, in which rookie Howie Morenz scored his first NHL goal.[90]\n\nThe 1923–24 season saw the Senators win the season but lose the playoff to the Canadiens, 0–1 and 2–4, with Georges Vezina getting the shutout and Morenz scoring 3 goals. Frank Nighbor was the first winner of the Hart Trophy as 'most valuable player' in the regular season.[91] After the disappointing loss in the playoff series, goaltender Clint Benedict became embroiled in a controversy with the club over late nights and drinking. He was traded away, along with Harry Broadbent, to the new Montreal Maroons before the next season, for cash.[92]\n\nThe 1924–25 season was the first year of expansion to the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith. Cy Denneny placed fourth in scoring with 28 goals in 28 games.[93] Frank Nighbor became the first winner of the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play, donated by Marie Evelyn Moreton (Lady Byng), wife of Viscount Byng of Vimy, who was Governor General of Canada from 1921 to 1926. Nighbor received the trophy personally from Lady Byng during a presentation at Rideau Hall. Nighbor won the trophy in 1925–26 and 1926–27 as well.[94]\n\nIn January 1925, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn for $35,000 and a share of the local Connaught Park horse racing track. Gorman left the Senators organization and later joined the expansion New York Americans. He also arranged the purchase of the suspended Hamilton Tigers players later that year to stock the New York club.[95]\n\nThe NHL expanded further into the United States in the 1925–26 season with the new New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates. Ottawa won the league title, led by Alex Connell in goal, who recorded 15 shutouts in 36 games, and Cy Denneny, who scored 24 goals. The team received a bye to the playoff finals.[96] However, the Montreal Maroons won the two-game total goals series with scores of 1–1 and 1–0; former Senator Clint Benedict got the shutout. The Maroons went on to win the Stanley Cup against Victoria.[97]\n\nThe 1926–27 season saw the Senators win the Cup again. At that time, the NHL was composed of two divisions, and the Senators won the Canadian division and the Prince of Wales Trophy. They advanced to the semi-finals and defeated the Canadiens, 4–0, and 1–1, en route to facing the Boston Bruins for the Cup. In the first series for the Stanley Cup with only NHL opponents, Ottawa defeated Boston with scores of 0–0, 3–1, 1–1 and 3–1, with the final game taking place in Ottawa. Alex Connell led the way in goal, allowing only three goals in the four games. Cy Denneny led the way in scoring with four goals, including the Cup winner. After the series, the Senators players received a parade in Ottawa, a civic banquet and an 18–carat gold ring with fourteen small diamonds in the shape of an 'O'.[98] See the article 1927 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nDecline (1927–34)[]\n\nOttawa had been by far the smallest market in the NHL even before American teams began playing in 1924. The later 1931 census listed only 110,000 people in the city of Ottawa—roughly one-fifth the size of Toronto, which was the league's second-smallest market. The team sought financial relief from the league as early as 1927. Despite winning the Stanley Cup, the Senators were already in financial trouble, having lost $50,000 for the season.[99] They sold their star right wing Hooley Smith to the Montreal Maroons for $22,500 and the return of former star Punch Broadbent.[100]\n\nThe league's expansion to the United States did not benefit the Senators. Attendance was low for games against the expansion teams, which provided a poor gate at home. There were also higher travel costs for away games, although the American arenas were larger. This fact was the basis for attempts to increase revenues, as the team played \"home\" games in other cities. In 1927––28, the team played two \"home\" games in Detroit, collecting the bulk of the gate receipts (thus allowing them to actually turn a profit for that season). They repeated the Detroit plan the following season, and in 1929–30, the team transferred two scheduled home games to Atlantic City (one each against the New York Rangers and New York Americans), two to Detroit, and one to Boston.[100]\n\nIn 1929–30, the Senators made the playoffs for a final time, finishing third in the Canadian Division. The Senators faced off against the New York Rangers in a two-game total-goals series. In the last NHL playoff game in Ottawa until 1996, the Senators tied the Rangers 1–1 on March 28, 1930 but lost game two in New York 5–1 to lose the series 6 goals to 2.[101]\n\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, the team sold its stars to other clubs. On January 31, 1930, Frank Nighbor was sold to Toronto. Another of the deals was the famous King Clancy transfer that saw the star defenceman sent to the rival Toronto Maple Leafs for an unprecedented $35,000 on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place for the first time since 1898.[102]\n\nIn 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but Chicago Blackhawks owner Frederic McLaughlin did not want another team in his territory.[103] Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings. The Senators and the equally strapped Philadelphia Quakers asked the NHL for permission to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season in order to rebuild their fortunes. The league granted both requests on September 26, 1931. Ottawa received $25,000 for the use of its players, and the NHL co-signed a Bank of Montreal loan of $28,000 to the club.[103] The Senators seriously considered moving to Toronto upon their return, as Conn Smythe desired a second tenant for the new Maple Leaf Gardens. However, they balked when Smythe wanted a $100,000 guarantee, with a 40%/60% split of revenues.[103]\n\nReturning after a one-year hiatus, the Senators finished with the worst record in the league in the two seasons that followed. They usually only saw large crowds for games against the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Montreal Maroons.[99] Frank Finnigan, one of the stars of the Senators' last Cup-winning season, recalled that they frequently played home games before crowds of 3,500 to 4,000.[99] In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team and move it to Baltimore, but the option was never exercised.[104]\n\nIn December 1933, rumours surfaced that the Senators would merge with the New York Americans; however, this was denied by Ottawa club president Frank Ahearn, who had sought financial help from the league.[105] The team played the full 1933–34 season, transferring one home game to Detroit. Near the end of the season, reports surfaced that the club had entered into a deal with St. Louis \"interests\" to move the club.[106] The team lost its last home game by a score of 3–2 to the Americans on March 15, 1934 before a crowd of 6,500. The Senators had lent Alex Connell to the Americans when the Americans' goalie Worters was hurt, and he turned in a \"sensational performance\" for the visitors.[107] The home crowd was in a \"throwing mood\" and \"carrots, parsnips, lemons, oranges and several other unidentified objects were thrown onto the ice continuously for no reason whatsoever.\"[108] The final game of the season was a 2–2 tie with the Maroons at the Montreal Forum on March 18, 1934.[109]\n\n1934: End of the first NHL era in Ottawa[]\n\nDespite finishing in last place for the second year in a row, the Senators actually improved their attendance over the previous season. Even with the increased gate, they barely survived the season. After the season ended, it was announced by Auditorium president F. D. Burpee that the franchise would not return to Ottawa for the 1934–35 season due to losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. The losses were too great to be made up by the sale of players' contracts, and the club needed to be moved to \"some very large city which has a large rink, if we are to protect the Auditorium shareholders and pay off our debts.\"[110] The NHL franchise was moved to St. Louis, Missouri and operated as the St. Louis Eagles. The Eagles played only one season, finishing last again, and the NHL bought out the franchise.[111] The city of Ottawa did not have an NHL franchise again until the new Ottawa Senators revived the franchise for the 1992–93 season.\n\nAfter the NHL franchise relocated, the Senators team was continued as a senior amateur team in the Montreal Group of the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association (QAHA), beginning in the 1934–35 season. One player, Eddie Finnigan, played for both the Senators and the Eagles in the 1934–35 season. The team renewed the rivalry with Montreal-area senior amateur teams such as the Montreal Victorias it had played in the years prior to 1909. Later, the team welcomed Tommy Gorman back as owner and helped to found the Quebec Senior Hockey League. Winning the Allan Cup in 1949, the senior Senators club continued until December 1954.[112]\n\nTeam Information[]\n\nLogos and jerseys[]\n\nThe Ottawa Hockey Club was initiated as an amateur organization, affiliated with the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association (OAAA). The team adopted the colors of the organization: red, white and black. The first logo of the team was a simplified version of the 'triskelion' logo of the OAAA, which can be described as a \"running wheel\". The first jerseys were solid white with the club logo in red. The players wore knee-length white pants with black stockings, as shown in the 1891 team photo.\n\nIn 1896, the club first adopted the \"barber-pole\" design, with which the team became synonymous. The design was simple: strong horizontal stripes of red, black and white. Players wore white pants and red, white and black striped stockings. The \"barber-pole\" uniform was later adopted by the Ottawa 67s junior hockey team.\n\nNo logo was present on the jersey at first, and until 1930 logos were not used for more than a year at a time. During World War I, the club adopted a logo of flags to show allegiance to the war effort, as shown in the 1915 photo. After each Stanley Cup win, the club affixed a badge or logo stating \"World Champions\". In the 1929–30 season, the club started to use the familiar \"O\" logo, which was used into the 1940s.[113]\n\nOwnership[]\n\nFrom the start, the club was owned by its members and known as the \"Ottawa Hockey Association\". In 1907, according to hockey historian Charles L. Coleman, some of the ownership was transferred to five of the players: Smith, Pulford, Moore, Westwick and LeSueur.[114] The club was separated from the Association and sold to Tommy Gorman, Ted Dey and Martin Rosenthal in 1917 for $5,000 in time to join the National Hockey League.[115]\n\nIn 1918, Rosenthal was forced out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of The Arena, with both Rosenthal on behalf of the Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an option to purchase the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a proposed new professional league over exclusive rights to the Arena for professional hockey. In a plan to derail the proposed new league, Dey maintained publicly that he had reserved the Arena for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on the Arena. Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at the Arena, attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918 and Rosenthal resigned from the club.[116] Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed.[117] Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.[118]\n\nIn 1923, Dey retired after selling his ownership interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn.[119] Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the Connaught race track in 1925,[120] and Gorman joined the New York Americans as manager. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a share issue. William Foran, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the Club. As the Auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.[121]\n\nIn 1931, a dispute arose between Foran, in his role as Stanley Cup trustee, and the NHL. The American Hockey League had asked for a Stanley Cup challenge against the champions of the NHL. Foran had agreed to the challenge and ordered the NHL to comply, but the NHL refused to play the challenge. Foran was fired from his position as Senators' president and was replaced by Redmond Quain.[122]\n\nIn 1934, the club's NHL franchise was transferred to St. Louis, but the Association continued its ownership of the franchise and player contracts as well as the senior club. On October 15, 1935, the NHL bought back the franchise and players' contracts for $40,000 and suspended its operations again.[123] Under the agreement, the NHL paid for the players and took back possession of the franchise. If the franchise was resold, the proceeds would go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.[124]\n\nThe Association remained in control of the senior club until 1937, when it was sold to James MacCaffery, the owner of the Ottawa Rough Riders football team. In 1944, Tommy Gorman purchased the club, which he operated until December 1954. He shut down the team over the \"rise of hockey on television.\"[125][126]\n\nFans[]\n\nWhen the Ottawa Hockey Club began play, there was no division between the ice surface and the stands like today. The fans became quite wet in the times when the temperature was warm. In the 1903 Stanley Cup Final against the Montreal Victorias, the Governor-General (who had a private box seat at the ice's edge) is recorded as getting wet from the play.[127] On another occasion, in the 1906 Stanley Cup Final against the Wanderers, the Governor-General's top hat was knocked off by the stick of Ernie Johnson.[128] The top hat was taken by a fan and given to Johnson.[129]\n\nOne custom of the Ottawa fans towards opposition teams was to throw lemons. Cyclone Taylor, on his first visit back to Ottawa after signing with Renfrew, was pelted with lemons as well as a bottle.[130]\n\nTeam record[]\n\nList of Stanley Cup final appearances[]\n\nDate Opponent Result March 22, 1894 Montreal Hockey Club Montreal defeats Ottawa 3–1.
