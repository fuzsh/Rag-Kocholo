        "text": "\"Queen of Bohemia\" redirects here. For the Welsh artist and writer, see Nina Hamnett.\n\nThis is a list of the royal consorts of the rulers of Bohemia.\n\nThe first Duchess of Bohemia (česká kněžna) was St. Ludmila, while the first Queen of Bohemia (česká královna) was Świętosława of Poland. Some of them were (like their husbands) not crowned.\n\nThere was only one queen regnant in Czech history - Maria Theresa. Nevertheless, some female royal consorts were highly influential in the country's history, having ruled as regents for their minor children and heirs, as well as having a great influence over their spouses."
