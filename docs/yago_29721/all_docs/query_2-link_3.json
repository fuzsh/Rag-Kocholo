        "text": "Husband: Vratislav II + (1035-1092) Wife: Swietoslawa of POLAND (1044-1126) Children: Sobeslav I (1075-1140)\n\nHusband: Vratislav II +\n\nWife: Swietoslawa of POLAND\n\nChild 1: Sobeslav I\n\nName: Sobeslav I Sex: Male Spouse: Adelaide (1105-1140) Birth 1075 Occupation Duke of Bohemia Title frm 1125 to 1140 (age 49-65) Duke of Bohemia Death 14 Feb 1140 (age 64-65)\n\nNote on Husband: Vratislav II +\n\nVratislaus (or Wratislaus) II (died 14 January 1092), the son of Bretislaus I and Judith of Schweinfurt, daughter of Henry of Schweinfurt, was the first King of Bohemia from 15 June 1085. The royal title was a grant, however, from the Holy Roman Emperor and was not hereditary. Before being raised to kingship, he had ruled Bohemia as duke since 1061. He was one of the greatest of medieval Bohemian rulers.\n\nOn his father's death in 1055, Vratislaus became duke of Olomouc. He fell out with his brother Spytihnev II and was exiled to Hungary. Vratislaus regained his Moravian ducal throne with Hungarian assistance and eventually reconciled with his brother and succeed him as duke of Bohemia.\n\nVratislaus was an ally of the Emperor Henry IV. He supported Henry in both the Investiture Controversy and the rebellions in Saxony which dominated his long reign. Pope Gregory VII, having already gained the support of Boleslaus II of Poland, was keen on roping in the duke of Bohemia to surround the emperor with adversaries fighting for the church. The pope confirmed Vratislaus in the privilege of wearing the mitre and tunic which his predecessors had had. The pope also expressed gratitude for the regular payment of tribute to the Holy See.\n\nVratislaus was often at odds with his brother Jaromir, the bishop of Prague, and he wore his religious vestments around the bishop to irritate him. Jaromir, for his part, ignored the creation of a new Moravian diocese by Vratislaus in 1063. Jaromir even went so far as to take by arms the relics removed from Prague to Moravia. Despite the pope's support for Vratislaus' new see, the Bohemian duke was unswayed in his loyalty to the emperor.\n\nThe Saxons revolted under their Duke Magnus and Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria, in 1070 and Boleslaus of Poland attacked Bohemia in 1071. In August 1073, Henry responded with an invasion of Poland, but a new Saxon revolt drew him back in 1075. Vratislaus joined him and they defeated the rebels on June 9 at the First Battle of Langensalza. The Bohemian troops showed conspicuous bravery. Henry then took Jaromir to Germany to be his chancellor by the name of Gebhard and Vratislaus was greatly relieved.\n\nVratislaus also took part in the wars against the anti-kings who opposed Henry's rule and were elected by a part of the nobility to replace him. At the Battle of Flarchheim, only through the aid of Vratislaus' contingent was the imperial army capable of overcoming the rebels of the papally-approved claimant Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Duke of Swabia. Vratislaus even succeeded in seizing Rudolf's golden sword. The golden sword was then carried in front of Vratislaus on state occasions.\n\nRelations with the papacyVratislaus raised an army to serve in Henry's Italian campaign of 1081. In 1083, Vratislaus and his Bohemians were with Henry when they entered the Eternal City itself.\n\nDespite his serving an excommunicated emperor, Vratislaus maintained good relations with the papacy. Nonetheless, Gregory refused to grant Vratislaus permission to use the Slavonic liturgy. Never, however, did Vratislaus link his fate with that of Henry's antipope, Clement III.\n\nExpansionism\n\nDenar of Vratislaus II.Vratislaus coveted the largely Slavic marches of Meissen and Lusatia, but, in spite of Henry's promises and Bohemian successes against the rebellious margraves, he never received them. He held Lower Lusatia between 1075 and 1086, but in 1088, with the insurrection of Egbert II of Meissen, Henry granted the region to Henry of Ostmark. Vratislaus was thereafter cool to Henry's military adventures. He never adjusted his loyalty, but he abstained from giving the emperor martial aid.\n\nInternal affairsIt was a Premyslid tradition that Moravia would be entrusted to the younger brothers of the ruling prince. In Vratislaus' case, his two younger brothers Conrad and Otto inherited Brno and Olomouc and the youngest, Jaromir, entered the church. However, enmity grew between the brothers. It was then that Vratislaus founded the diocese of OlmÃ¼tz (diocese of Olomouc), under the Archbishopric of Mainz, to counter Otto's authority within his province. Both pope and emperor took a hand in refereeing the conflict, which was partially fixed with Henry's appointment of Jaromir as chancellor in 1077. In April 1085, a reichstag convened in Mainz suppressed the Moravian see and, but Vratislaus later refounded the see. Jaromir protested in Rome to Pope Urban II, but died in 1090.\n\nSadly for Vratislaus, his last years were occupied by dynastic quarrelling. When his brother Otto died in 1086, he gave Olomouc to his son Boleslaus, which was seen to be an act against the interests of Conrad. Vratislaus raised an army against Conrad and sent it out under his other son Bretislaus. Instead, this son turned on him. Vratislaus, in keeping with Bohemian custom, designated an heir: Conrad. Thus reconciled with his surviving brother, the two demolished Bretislaus, who fled to Hungary.\n\nVratislaus died of a hunting wound on January 14, 1092, after a reign of thirty years. He was buried in St. Peter and Paul's Church, VyÅ¡ehrad.[1]\n\nFamilyVratislaus was married three times. His first wife Maria died during premature childbirth. He married the second time in 1057 to Adelaide, daughter of Andrew I of Hungary, who died in 1061. They had four children:\n\nVratislaus (-1061)\n\nJudith (1056/58-1086), married to Ladislaus I Herman, son of Casimir I of Poland\n\nLudmila (-after 1100)\n\nBretislaus II of Bohemia (c. 1060âDecember 22, 1100), Duke of Bohemia\n\nIn 1062, Vratislaus married a third time to Swatawa of Poland, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland. They had five children:\n\nBoleslaus (-1091)\n\nBorivoj II of Bohemia (c. 1064-February 2, 1124), Duke of Bohemia\n\nVladislaus I of Bohemia (-April 12, 1125), Duke of Bohemia\n\nSobeslav I of Bohemia (-February 14, 1140), Duke of Bohemia\n\nJudith (c. 1066-9 December 1108), married to Wiprecht de Groitzsch\n\nNote on Wife: Swietoslawa of POLAND\n\n(Czech: Svatava PolskÃ¡ (c. 1046-1048 â 1 September 1126)) was the third wife of Duke and later King Vratislaus II of Bohemia and since 1085 the first Queen of Bohemia.\n\nSwietoslawa was the daughter of Casimir I of Poland and his wife Maria Dobroniega of Kiev. Thanks to her great-grandmother Dobrawa she was related to the House of Premysl, family of her future husband. Her brothers were rulers of Poland Boleslaus II the Bold and Vladislaus I Herman.\n\n[edit] Marriage to Vratislaus\n\nVratislaus married Swietoslawa in 1062, one year after the death of the previous duchess, Vratislaus's second wife Adelaide Arpad.[1] His first wife Maria had died after the birth of their stillborn child. According to German historians, Swietoslawa was 15 years old at the time of their marriage, while according to Oswald Balzer, she was aged 19 to 22.\n\nBy this marriage, neutrality of Bohemia was ensured in the Polish-German conflict. In addition, Vratislaus demonstrated friendly relationships with Duke and later King of Poland Boleslaus II the Bold, but some time after he had a dispute with Boleslaus about Czech-Polish borders.\n\n[edit] The first Queen\n\nThe new duchess gave birth to four children; Vratislaus had four other ones already. The youngest son, Sobeslav, was born probably in 1075. Her sons Vladislaus and Sobeslav became dukes in the unquiet years after the death of their father, while her daughter Judith was married to ally and friend of her father, Wiprecht.\n\nThere is little information about this duchess, although she was crowned together with him in 1085 by archbishop Egilbert. They were King and Queen for the next seven years.\n\n[edit] Widow\n\nIn 1092 Swietoslawa was left a widow and saw a struggle for the throne of Bohemia among Premyslids. In 1111, she helped by negotiation between Vladislaus I and Boleslaw III Wrymouth. After Vratislaus' death, she softened clashes between their youngest sons Vladislaus and Sobeslav.\n\nIn 1125, the dying Vladislaus I confirmed his relative Otto II the Black as his successor, which was also the wish of Vladislaus' wife, Richeza of Berg. Only the intervention of his mother changed his opinion. Not to like, Vladislaus reconciled with his brother Sobeslav.[1]\n\nSwietoslawa, who was a widow for thirty years, lived to see the victory of her son in Battle of Chlumec and died in September 1126.\n\n[edit] Children\n\nBoleslaus (â1091)\n\nBorivoj II of Bohemia (c. 1064â2 February 1124), Duke of Bohemia\n\nVladislaus I of Bohemia (â12 April 1125), Duke of Bohemia\n\nSobeslav I of Bohemia (â14 February 1140), Duke of Bohemia\n\nJudith (c. 1066â9 December 1108), married to Wiprecht de Groitzsch"
