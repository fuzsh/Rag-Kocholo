        "text": "The Jewish community in Prague, created in the High Middle Ages, is the oldest in Bohemia. Its history is marked by profound anti-Semitism, the intensity of which reflects the social and economic problems of each historical period. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, however, Prague would become an important Jewish center.\n\nThe capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, is one of the oldest urban centers in Central-Eastern Europe. The presence of Jews in the region dates back to Antiquity. According to Czech historian VV Tomek, the first to venture into Bohemia were merchants who followed the Roman legions. It is not certain, however, when the first Jewish settlements were established.\n\nThere is a Czech legend that mentions Prague and the Jews. Tradition tells that Lubossa1, ancestor of the Premyslid dynasty and the Czech people, he predicted the future and, one day, finding himself on a cliff above the Vltava River, he had a vision that “a great city” would be established there. The vision warned her that her descendants would come into contact with people from a distant country and different religion. If these people were received in peace, the city would be blessed with prosperity.\n\nBořivoj Přemyslovec, a descendant of Lubossa, who took power in 870, is the founder of the Premyslid dynasty, which ruled the Duchy of Bohemia until 1301. Bořivoj and his wife Ludmila were the first rulers to accept baptism, then Christianizing their domains . It is also believed that it was he (or his son) who founded Prague Castle, at the end of the 9th century, on the Hradchany hill, on the left bank of the Vltava River. Currently, the Castle is used as the seat of the Presidency of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe first document that mentions the existence of Prague is dated 965-6 and was written by a Spanish Jew, Abraham ben Jacob of Tortosa, known as Ibrāhīm ibn Ya'qūb. A merchant and diplomat, ibn Ya'qūb was sent by al-Hakam II, caliph of Córdoba, to the court of Otto I, the Great, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. After finishing the diplomatic mission, ibn Ya'qūb traveled to other places in Europe. In his travel report he describes, among others, Prague. He says that there was an important trading center around and at the foot of Prague Castle, where Jewish and non-Jewish merchants sold products from the East and West.\n\nAt the time, Jews were free to live wherever they wanted, enjoying the same rights and privileges as German and Frankish traders. A 16th century Czech chronicler, Václav Hájek of Libočany2, reports that a synagogue was built in Prague, at the end of the 10th century, on the banks of the Vltava River, among the Christian population. The chronicler says that in the year 995 Christians had asked the Jews for military help against pagan rebels. The Jews fought with such bravery that they received authorization to build a synagogue in the neighborhood of Malá Strana3 (Prague's Lower Town or Old Town). The relative Jewish tranquility, however, was short-lived. The Christian clergy constantly incited the rulers and the masses against the Jews. Throughout the 1050s, the Jewish population of Bohemia was the target of “typical” Christian anti-Jewish accusations: poisoning of rivers and wells and the air of Christian homes, kidnapping and killing of Christian children and use of their blood in “incantations against the population”. ”. In 1059, according to Hájek, priests accused Jews of burning down several churches. Enraged, Prince Spytihněv condemns 45 Jews to the stake and expels the rest of the Jewish population from the Duchy of Bohemia, confiscating their property.\n\nWith the expulsion of the Jews, an economic crisis set in in the Duchy, which meant that five years later, in 1064, the Jews were allowed to return, obtaining, at the end of 1067, permission from Prince Vratislaus II to move from Prague's Old Town for Stare Mesto, the Upper City. Three kilometers away from Prague Castle, the prince built the High Castle, Vyšehrad, around which a new Jewish neighborhood was formed.\n\nOver the next 30 years, the Jewish community recovered and prospered, but the tranquility ended in 1096, when members of the 1st Crusade passed through Prague.\n\nThe previous year, the Crusade had been proclaimed by Pope Urban II, with the aim of freeing the Holy Land from Muslim rule. But, before reaching the Middle East, the crusaders turned against “the European infidels”, that is, the Jews. In April 1096, more than 10 Christians left Rouen and Normandy towards the North, looting and murdering all the Jews in their path. When they arrived in a city, they joined the Christian populace, always ready to kill Jews and plunder their wealth. The Czech chronicler Cosmas of Prague (c.1039–1125) reported that upon arriving in Prague, the Crusaders murdered many Jews and plundered their property. Many others were forced to accept baptism. They burned down the Jewish neighborhoods, but not their properties in the Old City, fearing that the fire would reach their churches.\n\nA portion of the Jewish population moved to the right bank of the Vltava River in 1142, after Prague Castle was surrounded and burned by King Conrad III. The flames reached the Jewish quarter, located below the castle, with its synagogue, the oldest in the city.\n\nThe status of the local Jewish population deteriorated in the 12th and 13th centuries with the strengthening of the Church. The hatred of Christians manifested itself when one of the medieval anti-Semitic accusations was leveled against the Jews and violence struck the entire community. In 1181, for example, 85 Jews were burned alive and a synagogue was destroyed.\n\nIn the second half of the 12th century, much of Prague's Jewish population lived in the Jewish Town4. At the time, Jews lived in this area by choice and the six gates surrounding it had been built to protect them from pogroms.\n\nThe “Jewish Status”\n\nIn 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council promulgated anti-Jewish canons aiming to “prevent the contamination of Christians”. The Council “invited” the monarchs of Europe to adopt legislation that would force Jews to live in separate neighborhoods, wear the “Jewish badge” on their clothing and prohibit them from exercising “Christian professions”, holding public office, working in agriculture and be part of professional corporations.\n\nThe kings, however, were aware that Jewish talents and wealth were necessary for the economy and the well-being of the kingdom, and therefore it was necessary to give the Jewish population legal protection. During the Middle Ages, Jews received letters of privileges and residence rights from the rulers and, in return, they were granted loans and paid high taxes.\n\nIn 1236, Frederick II, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, declared all Jews to be Kammerknechtschaft (in Latin, Served camera and records, servants of the Royal Chamber). This meant that the revenue generated by them was a perk of the emperor, belonging to the imperial treasury and the ruler was obliged to protect them.\n\nBohemia had become a hereditary kingdom in 1212, and with Otakar II (1233-1278), the Premyslid dynasty reached the height of its power. In Czech lands, kings had legislative power in matters relating to Jews and Otakar II was one of the monarchs who most contributed to their well-being.\n\nBetween 1254 and 1262 (the exact date is not known) the monarch granted a letter of privileges, Statute Judaeorum, even more favorable to the Jews than the Statute promulgated by Emperor Frederick II. According to the document, they were under royal jurisdiction and protection, and the tax revenue they generated belonged to the royal coffers. The Statute included, among others, freedom of movement and housing, the prohibition of forced baptism and illegal actions against Jews or their property, as well as any Christian intervention in the celebration of Shabbat and Jewish festivals. It also incorporated the papal bulls of Innocent IV, which rejected the blood libel, that is, the myth about the supposed murders of Christians by Jews for ritual purposes. In 1247, Pope Innocent IV issued the bull Sicut Judaeis, which prohibited Christians, under penalty of excommunication, from accusing Jews of using human blood in their rituals.\n\ncommunity development\n\nSince the 11th century, the Jewish City of Prague had become an important center of Torah study and there lived important rabbis, including Yitzhak ben Ya'akov ha-Lavan of Prague, and his pupil Avraham ben Azri'el, and the respected Yitzhak ben Moshe.\n\nKing Otakar II had given permission to the Jewish community to establish a cemetery and a new synagogue. Built in the Gothic style, the name of the synagogue, opened in 1270, was New or Great Synagogue, but when others were built, it came to be called Altneuschul (Old-New Synagogue). For more than 750 years it was the center of Jewish life in Prague and today it is the oldest synagogue in the world still in daily use.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378), both Prague and the Jewish community flourished. The first Bohemian king to ascend the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, Charles IV, made the city his capital, rebuilt Prague and Vyšehrad Castles and established the New Town (Nove Mesto), authorizing Jews to settle there.\n\nThe situation of the Jewish population, however, worsened with the accession to the throne of Wenceslas IV (1378–1419), son of Charles IV. Bohemia entered a period of political and social instability, with dramatic consequences for the Jews. Religious anti-Semitism fueled by the Church had found fertile ground in Bohemia. The myths of the blood libel, the desecration of the host and the supposed insidious plots of the Jews against the Christian religion were strongly rooted in the population's imagination.\n\nOn April 18, 1389, the day before Easter Sunday, the Christian populace attacked the city's Jewish community. The dramatic events were described by Rabbi Avigdor ben Yitzhak Kara, who died in 1439: “The Prague clergy spread the accusation that the Jews had desecrated the host and encouraged the people to attack, loot and burn the Jewish City. As a result, more than three thousand Jews were killed, some by fire and others by violent means. Some women and children were forcibly taken away and baptized to appease the angry mob.” This pogrom was the most devastating carnage against the Jews of Prague in all the centuries preceding the Shoah.\n\nRabbi Kara wrote a famous tribute (cinemas, in Hebrew) about the tragic events, entitled “All the hardships that have befallen us”, included in the prayer book of Rosh Hashana e Yom Kippur used by the Jews of Prague and which is still prayed today in Altneuschul, on the day of Yom Kippur.\n\nThe 15th Century and the Hussite Period\n\nAnti-Judaism became even stronger throughout the 15th century and Jewish life became more precarious, only improving in the years when the Hussites – followers of Jan Hus – were in control of Bohemia, during the so-called Hussite Wars (1420 -1436).\n\nCzech theologian who pioneered the Protestant movement, Jan Hus was burned alive by the Inquisition after being accused of heresy. His death in 1415 provoked protests and a rebellion by Protestants in Bohemia. The conflict between them and Catholic forces from all over Europe would break out five years later and last 16 years.\n\nJews gave extensive financial support to the Hussites, who, in turn, considered Jews “natural” allies, as both faced Catholic hatred. However, despite the philosemitic attitude on the part of the Hussites, the Jews were not safe from the violence. The Jewish quarter of Prague was the scene of pogroms in 1421-1422 and 1483.\n\nOne of the consequences of the Hussite Wars was the weakening of royal power and the strengthening of the nobility and cities. Jews now have to pay taxes not only to the royal coffers, but also to nobles and municipal councils. In Prague, while taxes continued to fill the city's coffers, the Jews were left in relative peace.\n\nDuring this period, the Pinchas Synagogue was built. Financed by the Horowitz family as a private place of prayer, it eventually became one of Prague's main synagogues.\n\nIn the 16th century the city is one of the largest centers of Hebrew printing in Europe. Among the works published during this period, we highlight a book of hymns in Hebrew, from 1514, illustrated with rich illuminations; the Pentateuch, in 1518, and later, another edition of it in 1530, and the famous Haggadah of Prague, from 1526. The innovative typology and style of his illustrations were copied throughout Europe.\n\nIn 1501, Vladislav II, king of Bohemia, made an “irrefutable” proposal to the Jews: he would guarantee their right to live in Prague, and in other places in Bohemia, if they paid another exorbitant annual fee to the royal coffers. Royal protection was put to the test the following year, in 1502. For Christians in the Old City, the taxes paid by Jews were not enough to allow them to live there. Therefore, they asked for his expulsion from the city and from all of Bohemia. The king refused and, in 1510, after two more requests for expulsion (in 1507 and 1509), he granted the Edict of Olomouc which reaffirmed the Jews' right to remain in Bohemia.\n\nBut, in 1526, once again the situation changed for the Jews when Ferdinand I ascended the throne of Bohemia. 1.200 of them lived in Prague in 1541, when the monarch decided to expel them. Three years later, after several postponements, practically all of Prague's Jews had been forced to leave the city. Two years later, the Jews were allowed to return, only to be expelled again in 1557.\n\nGolden Age of Prague Jews\n\nAn era of prosperity began when Maximilian II became emperor in 1564. Aiming for peace in the Holy Roman Empire, the emperor maintained a policy of religious neutrality in the struggle between Catholics and Protestants. Regarding the Jewish population of Bohemia, in 1567 he canceled Ferdinand I's expulsion order, reconfirming the rights of the Jews of Prague, and abolished most of the trade bans against them. It was Maximilian II who established the basis of tolerance that would pave the way for an era of prosperity – the Golden Age of Prague Jewry, from 1570 to 1620.\n\nThe Golden Age flourished during the reign of Rudolf II (1576-1612), Roman-Germanic emperor. After assuming the throne of Bohemia, the monarch moved to Prague Castle, which remained his main residence. In 1584, he moved the seat of the Empire from Vienna to Prague and, as a result, the city experienced a great tree economic, cultural and population.\n\nIn 1593, Rudolf II launched a war against the Ottoman Empire, the Long Turkish War. Eccentric, given to periods of depression and insanity, the monarch was unable to maintain the cohesion of his domains. This gave space for other members of the Habsburgs to intervene in the affairs of the empire. In reality, he managed to reign only over Bohemia.\n\nRodolfo II expanded Jewish rights and privileges, determining that disputes between Jews and Christians were judged by the royal court. He issued decrees to protect the Jews against hostility from Christians and craft guilds. In 1599 he exempted them from paying municipal taxes and gave them permission to become artisans. Enjoying economic freedom, they branched out their activities and many became small traders and artisans. The city began to attract Jews from all over Europe, with more than three thousand living in Jewish City at the end of the 16th century.\n\nPersonalities of the Golden Age\n\nTwo personalities stand out during the Golden Age: Mordechai Maisel, community leader and philanthropist, and Rabbi Yehuda Loew ben Bezalel, the Maharal of Prague, the greatest spiritual leader in the history of the Jews of Prague.\n\nFinancier and merchant, Maisel (1528-1601) is considered the first of the so-called “Court Jews”. Rodolfo II made him his royal advisor, in return for the financial assistance provided during the war against the Turks. The monarch guaranteed him extraordinary privileges; among others, in 1593, the right to negotiate freely, receiving protection against legal actions by Christians.\n\nMaisel used his wealth to improve the lives of his co-religionists: he supported social welfare institutions, he gave interest-free loans to artisans and the less privileged, he financially supported scholars, rabbis and students of the yeshivot, and made the Jewish City a place where his fellow Jews could live decently. It was he who paved the muddy alleys of the Jewish quarter, and his name is linked to the vast majority of buildings built during his lifetime. He undertook the construction of the Renaissance-style Great Synagogue, opened in 1568, and the Jewish Town Hall building. Maisel also financed the expansion of the cemetery, built a hospital for the needy, a mikveh, the Klausen Synagogue and the synagogue that bears his name, the Maisel Synagogue.\n\nIn 1598, Emperor Rudolf II decreed that Maisel could freely dispose of his assets after his death. But after his death in 1601, his entire fortune was confiscated.\n\nThere is no doubt that the most prominent spiritual leader in Prague's Jewish history was Rabbi Yehuda Loew (1525-1609), known as the Maharal of Prague. A fearless leader, he was an excellent Kabbalist, an important master of Halacha and Aggadah. The Maharalé, well known for having created the G – a clay creature that protected the Jewish community of Prague against attacks led by anti-Semites.\n\nThirty Years' War\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Prague's Jewish community already numbered six thousand people, becoming, in the following decade, the second largest in Europe after Rome.\n\nAnother great benefactor and community leader emerged in Prague in the 17th century: Yaacov Bashevi (1570-1634). Among others, Bashevi obtained permission from the governor of Bohemia for, in 1623, the Jews of Prague to purchase 39 houses from Christians, a transaction that allowed the limited Jewish City to be expanded.\n\nHe occupied a prominent place alongside the emperors Rodolfo II and his brother, Matthias, and Ferdinand II. He was the first Jew in the Habsburg domains to receive a title of nobility, taking the name Yaacov Bashevi von Treuenberg. He played an important role in the court of Ferdinand II, to whom he provided great financial assistance during the 30 Years' War (1618–1648). This conflict began in Bohemia, with the revolt of Protestants against the attempts of Emperor Ferdinand II to impose Catholicism in his domains.\n\nThe devastation caused by the War did not have dramatic consequences for Prague's Jewish community, as Ferdinand II, desperate for economic support, sought to guarantee its safety. While his troops sacked Prague in 1620, after the Battle of White Mountain, for example, the emperor forbade them from damaging the Jewish City. In 1623 and 1627, Ferdinand II allowed Jews to trade freely and exempted them from customs duties and tolls. In return, however, the Jewish community was forced to agree to a considerable increase in taxes and to provide the emperor with a large loan.\n\nDespite heavy taxes that drained community resources, Prague's Jewish community continued to grow, reaching 7.815 people in 1638.\n\nThe Jewish population and the Family Statute\n\nIn the 1680s, two natural disasters almost wiped the Jewish City off the map. The first was the plague of 1680, which claimed the lives of more than three thousand of our co-religionists. Nine years later, in June 1689, a fire devastated the Jewish City, destroying 318 houses, 11 synagogues and taking the lives of 150 people.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, anti-Judaism was growing stronger. Jews were forced by Christian clergy to attend proselytizing sermons and all their books were censored. Furthermore, they suffered constant attacks from the Jesuits. These used to hold public trials and torture sessions to “convince” the masses to become devout Catholics. The Jews, naturally, got the worst of these true “theatrical sessions”.\n\nAt the beginning of the century. 18, Jews represented half of the population of Prague's Old Town. At the time, the city was home to the largest Jewish community in the world.\n\nThe 18th century, the “Century of Enlightenment”, saw the emergence of the Enlightenment, an intellectual and philosophical movement that emphasized reason and the natural rights of humans. But in Habsburg rule, Jews were still subject to medieval restrictions and discrimination. Only a few “useful Jews” enjoyed special privileges.\n\nFor some time now, certain “ideas” for controlling the Jewish population had been taking shape in Prague, with consideration being given to transferring them outside the limits of the Old City and Bohemia.\n\nUntil in 1726-1727, Emperor Charles VI issued the infamous “Statute of Families”, as he considered the growth of the Jewish population “intolerable”. These laws decreed that only 8.541 Jewish families would be “tolerated” in Bohemia and that only the eldest son of a family would have the right to marry. If the others wanted to get married, they would have to do so illegally, within the kingdom or under the protection of the nobility, or even leave the country. This legislation remained in force for around 120 years, until 1848.\n\nThe lives of Jews became even more precarious when, in 1740, Maria Theresa ascended the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. A fervent Catholic, she considered Protestants and Jews “dangerous elements”. Extremely anti-Semitic, something she never denied, the empress revealed her feelings on several occasions. In 1777, she wrote: “I know no greater plague than this race...their falsehood, usury and avarice...as far as possible the Jews are to be avoided and kept at a distance.”\n\nMaria Theresa imposed even heavier taxes on her Jewish subjects and, in December 1744, decided to expel them from Bohemia. Opposition from municipal authorities did not prevent Prague's Jews from having to leave the city in January 1745. Intense international political pressure led the empress to grudgingly allow them to remain for a time in villages within a short distance of two day trip from Prague.\n\nThe expulsion was devastating to the city's economy and, in August 1748, after intervention by municipal authorities, the Jews were allowed to return. Maria Theresa, however, imposed a heavy annual “tolerance tax” on them to prevent future expulsions.\n\nUpon returning, the Jews found their neighborhood in ruins. Reconstruction was interrupted when, in 1754, a fire broke out and destroyed 190 houses and six synagogues. The cost of reconstruction and the “tolerance tax”, which the empress incessantly increased, undermined the community economically. Still, Jewish culture continued to flourish. Among the rabbis of the 18th century, Simon Spira-Wedeles, Elias Spira, David Oppenheim and Yehezkel Landau stood out.\n\nThe “Edict of Tolerance”\n\nLife for the Jews only improved when Joseph II (1780-1790), son of Maria Theresa, became Roman Emperor. For Maria Theresa, the only way to resolve “the Jewish question” was to expel the Jews from the Empire, which Joseph II, however, did not agree with. He considered the laws that regulated Jewish life a medieval anachronism, harmful to the Empire's economy. Jews began to be seen from a different perspective than the Christian one, which took into account their “usefulness” for the State.\n\nThe emperor believed that the State should adopt an interventionist and protectionist economic policy aimed at the development of industry and foreign trade, and was aware that Jews were experienced in commerce and finance, with broad international connections. Furthermore, there were among them those who had accumulated net wealth. For the State, the “Jewish problem” then leaves the religious sphere and passes into the economic and political sphere.\n\nJosé II managed to fully exercise power after his mother's death, in 1780. The following year, he issued the Toleranzpatent – the “Edict of Tolerance”, which granted freedom of worship to all Christians, although Protestants did not obtain all rights.\n\nThe debate over the “Jewish question” took to the streets of Vienna and Prague. The Bohemian government argued that instead of giving Jews rights, the emperor should deport all but the wealthiest. But despite arguments to the contrary, in October 1781 Joseph II issued the Edict of Tolerance for the Jews of Bohemia. It is important to emphasize that it was not a declaration of equal rights. The Edict maintained restrictions on the number of Jews who could settle in Prague and the terrible Family Status Laws.\n\n“Tolerated” Jews – they were still subject to strict quotas and special taxes – could live wherever they wanted, despite not being able to purchase property or build a synagogue. They could also attend universities. Prague becomes an important center of Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment, and Jewish academics achieve great success in Medicine, Law and the Humanities.\n\nOn the other hand, several laws were put into effect to end the particularities of Judaism and its community structure. The authority of the Beit Din, Jewish courts, except in religious and marital matters. The use of Yiddish and Hebrew was prohibited and reform of the educational system became mandatory, with secular primary schools supervised by the State being created. In 1786, only Jews who graduated from these schools were allowed to marry. A 1787 law obliges Jews to adopt German surnames.\n\nOnce the legal barriers were broken down, the doors were opened for Jews to enter the larger society, which will cause unprecedented assimilation.\n\nEquality and Assimilation\n\nIn 1789, the French Revolution shook Europe. The news of the emancipation of French Jews travels across this continent like a ray of hope. In 1799, a coup d'état brought Napoleon to power and the Napoleonic armies began their conquest of a large part of the European continent, taking with them the ideals of freedom and equality. The ghettos of Europe are torn down and the Jews are emancipated.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire, attacked by Napoleon, was dissolved in 1806 and Francis II was forced to abdicate the throne, becoming emperor of Austria.\n\nHowever, England, the Turkish-Ottoman Empire, Russia and the Kingdom of Naples form a powerful alliance and manage to defeat Napoleon. After this defeat, the Congress of Vienna was formed, a conference between major European powers to redraw the political map of the European continent. The Congress ended its activities in 1815 and among the resolutions was the creation of the German Confederation, under Austrian hegemony.\n\nIn 1848, Jews received equal rights under the first Austrian Constitution and the Family Statute was abolished. At the time, Prague's Jewish community, with a population of more than 10 people, was one of the largest in Europe. From 1852, Jews were allowed to own property and, in 1859, to own land. The process of Jewish emancipation in Austria-Hungary was completed when the 1867 constitution was promulgated.\n\nThe Jewish community of 19th-century Prague was marked by two trends: on the one hand, Jews made enormous advances in the economic and cultural life of Czech society, and, on the other, there was the almost total erosion of Jewish religious life in Bohemia. As a result of 19th-century emancipation, Jews were integrated into the secular state, and their communal structure, which had defined Jewish life for more than 500 years, was dismantled. Many Jewish communities in Central Europe had a high rate of assimilation, but in Prague, the separation of Jews from their tradition occurred earlier, being even more severe, causing stagnation in their population numbers. In 1890 there were 27 thousand Jews in Prague, in 1921 the number reached a mere 32 thousand.\n\nWhat were the reasons for this unparalleled departure from our traditions? First was the Edict of Toleration and the sweeping transformation of the Jewish community and education. Second, was the full emancipation of the Jews in 1867. In their eagerness to assimilate, the Jews of Prague fully embraced the German language and culture.\n\nProsperous and confident in the future, they sought to demonstrate their new situation, of existential freedom and financial success. And in 1868, they inaugurated a new synagogue, the majestic Spanish Synagogue, in keeping with the emancipation they were experiencing.\n\nThe story of Lubossa (Libuše) was retold in the 12th century.

Although the term “Lower City” is more commonly used in Portuguese, the name originated from the fact that the place is on the left (west) bank of the Vltava River, on the slopes of the mountain where Prague Castle is located, as opposed to the larger areas of the city. which are on the right bank (east) of the river.\n\nThe place is today known as the Josefov District, often called the Jewish Quarter or Jewish Ghetto of Prague.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nČapková, Kateřina and Kieval, Hillel, J.
