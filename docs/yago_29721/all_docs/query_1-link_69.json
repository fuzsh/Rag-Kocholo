        "text": "The Duchy of Bohemia was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm.\n\nThe Great Moravian realm was was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe, possibly including territories which are today part of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nBohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to Arnulf of Corinthia, King of East Francia in 895. Arnulf of Corinthia was also the disputed King of Italy from 894 and the disputed Emperor from February 22, 896, until his death at Regensburg, Bavaria.\n\nBohemia was at first ruled by the Přemyslid Dynasty. The dynasty’s origin dates back to the 9th century, when the Přemyslids ruled a tiny territory around Prague, populated by a tribe of the Western Slavs. Gradually they expanded, conquering much of the region of Bohemia, located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by the expansion of the Frankish Empire. The first historically-documented Přemyslid duke was Bořivoj I (867). DNA testing on the remains of his son, Spytihněv I, reveal the family’s Y-haplogroup to be R1b, second most common haplogroup in Czech republic.\n\nWhile the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dyntasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I the Great. Late Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in 935, became the land’s patron saint.\n\nWhile the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid Dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of Emperor Heinrich II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.\n\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philipp of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV.\n\nIn 1204 Ottokar’s royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Friedrich II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\n\nUnder these terms, the King of Bohemia was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king’s successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nThe King of Bohemia was a Prince-Elector of the Empire. The Kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian Dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. From 1526 until the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the Kingdom of Bohemia was part of the greater Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nNumerous kinrgs of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a Crown Land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire’s leading cities.\n\nThe Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed).\n\nGerman was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia peacefully deposed their communist government during the Velvet Revolution, which began on November 17, 1989 and ended 11 days later on November 28th when all of the top Communist leaders and Communist party itself resigned. On December 31, 1992 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nWenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia was the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. His grandfather, Bořivoj I of Bohemia, was converted to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius. His mother, Drahomíra, was the daughter of a pagan tribal chief of the Havelli, but was baptized at the time of her marriage. His paternal grandmother, Ludmila of Bohemia, saw to it that he was educated in the Old Slavonic language and, at an early age, Wenceslaus was sent to the college at Budeč.\n\nIn 921, when Wenceslaus was about thirteen, his father died and his grandmother became regent. Jealous of the influence that Ludmila wielded over Wenceslaus, Drahomíra arranged to have her killed.\n\nLudmila was at Tetín Castle near Beroun when assassins murdered her on September 15, 921. She is said to have been strangled by them with her veil. She was at first buried in the church of St. Michael at Tetín, but her remains were later removed, probably by Wenceslaus, to the church of St. George in Prague, which had been built by his father.\n\nDrahomíra then assumed the role of regent and immediately initiated measures against Christians. When Wenceslaus was 18, those Christian nobles who remained rebelled against Drahomira. The uprising was successful, and Drahomira was sent into exile to Budeč.\n\nWith the support of the nobles, Wenceslaus took control of the government. He “…reined in the dependent dukes who had become restive under the regency and used Christianity to strengthen his state.”\n\nAfter the fall of Great Moravia, the rulers of the Bohemian Duchy had to deal both with continuous raids by the Magyars and the forces of the Saxon and East Frankish King, Heinrich I the Fowler, who had started several eastern campaigns into the adjacent lands of the Polabian Slavs, homeland of Wenceslaus’s mother.\n\nTo withstand Saxon overlordship, Wenceslaus’s father Vratislaus had forged an alliance with the Bavarian duke Arnulf, a fierce opponent of King Heinrich at that time. The alliance became worthless, however, when Arnulf and Heinrich reconciled at Regensburg in 921.\n\nEarly in 929, the joint forces of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and King Heinrich I the Fowler of East Francia reached Prague in a sudden attack that forced Wenceslaus to resume the payment of a tribute first imposed by the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in 895.\n\nHeinrich had been forced to pay a huge tribute to the Magyars in 926 and needed the Bohemian tribute, which Wenceslaus probably refused to pay after the reconciliation between Arnulf and Heinrich. Another possible reason for the attack was the formation of the anti-Saxon alliance between Bohemia, the Polabian Slavs, and the Magyars.\n\nWenceslaus introduced German priests into his realm and favoured the Latin rite instead of the old Slavic, which had gone into disuse in many places for want of priests. He also founded a rotunda consecrated to St. Vitus at Prague Castle in Prague that was the basis of present-day St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nAssassination\n\nIn September 935, a group of nobles allied with Wenceslaus’s younger brother Boleslaus plotted to kill him. After Boleslaus invited Wenceslaus to a celebration of the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian in Stará Boleslav, three of Boleslaus’s companions (Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa) fell on the duke and stabbed him to death. As the duke fell, Boleslaus ran him through with a lance.\n\nAccording to Cosmas of Prague, in his Chronica Boëmorum of the early 12th century, one of Boleslaus’ sons was born on the day of Wenceslaus’s death. Because of the ominous circumstance of his birth, the infant was named Strachkvas, which means “a dreadful feast”.\n\nThere is also a tradition that Wenceslaus’s loyal servant Podevin avenged his death by killing one of the chief conspirators, an act for which he was executed by Duke Boleslaus I the Cruel of Bohemia, brother and successor of Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia.\n\nThe Assassination of Wenceslaus has been characterized as an important turning point in early Bohemian history, as the rule of Boleslaus I saw him renounce the Franks, centralize power in Bohemia and expand the territory of the polity.\n\nWenceslaus was considered a martyr and saint immediately after his death, when a cult of Wenceslaus grew up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages concept of the rex justus (righteous king), a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety as well as his princely vigor.\n\nAlthough Wenceslaus was only a duke during his lifetime, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I the Great posthumously “conferred on [Wenceslaus] the regal dignity and title”, which is why he is referred to as Good “king” Wenceslaus in legend and song.\n\n“Good King Wenceslas” is a Christmas carol that tells a story of a Bohemian king who goes on a journey, braving harsh winter weather, to give alms to a poor peasant on the Feast of Stephen (December 26, the Second Day of Christmas). During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king’s footprints, step for step, through the deep snow. The legend is based on the life of the historical Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia (907–935).\n\nIn 1853, English hymnwriter John Mason Neale wrote the “Wenceslas” lyric, in collaboration with his music editor Thomas Helmore, and the carol first appeared in Carols for Christmas-Tide, published by Novello & Co the same year. Neale’s lyric was set to the melody of the 13th-century spring carol “Tempus adest floridum” (“Eastertime Is Come”) first published in the 1582 Finnish song collection Piae Cantiones.\n\nAmerican English spelling of the duke’s name, “Wenceslaus”, is occasionally encountered in later textual variants of the carol, although it was not used by Neale in his version. Wenceslaus is not to be confused with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Wenceslaus I Premyslid), who lived more than three centuries later.\n\nWenceslaus I (c. 907 – September 28, 935 or 929), Wenceslas I or Václav the Good was the Duke of Bohemia from 921 until his death, probably in 935. According to the legend, he was assassinated by his younger brother, Boleslaus the Cruel.\n\nHis martyrdom and the popularity of several biographies gave rise to a reputation for heroic virtue that resulted in his sainthood. He was posthumously declared to be a king and patron saint of the Czech state. He is the subject of the well-known “Good King Wenceslas”, a carol for Saint Stephen’s Day.\n\nBiography\n\nWenceslaus was the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. His grandfather, Bořivoj I of Bohemia, was converted to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius.
