        "text": "Doubravka Premyslovna, född 940 i Prag, Tjeckien, död 977 i Poznan, Polen.\n\nDobrawa (Czech: Doubravka) was a Bohemian princess member of the Premyslid dynasty and by marriage Duchess of the Polans. According to earlier sources she urged her husband to accept the baptism in 966. However, modern historians believed that the change of religion by Mieszko I was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement performed soon before his marriage with Dobrawa, whose role in the conversion of her husband is now considered wasn't so important as it's represented by the medieval chronicles.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobrawa_of_Bohemia\n\nDobrawa of Bohemia\n\nDobrawa (Dabrówka) (Czech: Doubravka, Polish: Dobrawa) (ca. 940/45  977) was a Bohemian princess member of the Premyslid dynasty and by marriage Duchess of the Polans.\n\nShe was the daughter of Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of Bohemia, by his wife Biagota.\n\nIssue\n\nThe marriage of Mieszko I and Dobrawa produced two children:\n\n1.Boleslaw I the Brave (Chrobry) (b. 967 - d. 17 June 1025).\n\n2.a daughter, perhaps named Swietoslawa, perhaps identical to the legendary Sigrid the Haughty (b. 968/72 - d. ca. 1016), perhaps married firstly with Eric the Victorious, King of Sweden and later wife of Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark by whom she is said to have been mother of Canute the Great, King of Denmark, Norway and England.\n\nThere is an hypothesis who stated the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married with a Pomeranian Slavic Prince; she could be the daughter of either Dobrawa or one of his previous pagan wives.[12] Also, exist the theory (apparently recorded by Thietmar and supported by Oswald Balzer in 1895) that Vladivoj, who ruled as Duke of Bohemia during 10021003, was another son of Dobrawa and Mieszko I;[1] although modern historians rejected this hypothesis, the Czech historiography supported mixed Piast-Premyslid parentage of Vladivoj.[13]\n\nMarriage (1): Mieszko I Prince Of Poland about 965\n\nMarriage (2): Günther von Merseburg about 952\n\nhttp://ru.rodovid.org/wk/??????:35673\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrawka_von_B%C3%B6hmen\n\nhttp://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubravka_P%C5%99emyslovna\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobrawa_of_Bohemia\n\nGift med\n\nMieszko I, född cirka 930 i Poznan, Polen, död 992-05-25 i Poznan, Polen.
