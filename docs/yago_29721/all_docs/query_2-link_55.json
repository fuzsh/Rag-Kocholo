        "text": "Did you ever wonder why, when your make out a check to someone or some business, you have to write in the sum in both numbers and words? If you’re bothered by all those unwanted ads cropping up on your social media, did you ever wish there was no such thing as an algorithm? And, be honest, did you ever wish that you didn’t have to take those required algebra courses back in high school?\n\nAll those feelings have occurred to me, but at least now I know who to blame. It’s those clerics and merchants and high-falutin’ academics who prowled the earth more than 1,500 years ago, from Baghdad to Cordoba to Florence and back again.\n\nThe Abacus and the Cross, a biography of learned scientist and teacher Gerbert of Aurillac, who ultimately became Pope Sylvester II, shows that the so-called “Dark Ages” weren’t so dark after all. In fact, there was a great deal of learning and trafficking in scientific knowledge going on. Gerbert was a renowned schoolmaster, scientist, and cleric of that era. He intrigued his way to the papacy and got appointed to it by Otto III, the Holy Roman Emperor, in the year 999.\n\nGerbert’s biography goes into the backstories behind those matters in the first paragraph. It tells of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which became a veritable research institute around the year 800. It saved for posterity works by such giants as Euclid, Ptolemy, Archimedes, and Aristotle. Much of the scientific know-how from Baghdad eventually made its way to Europe via al-Andalus, the Muslim stronghold in Spain.\n\nOne of the all-star mathematicians from the House of Wisdom was Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, who died in 850. He wrote On Indian Calculation, the world’s first book on Arabic numbers – the numbers that ran from 1 to 9 – and the place-value system of working with those numbers. That system originally came from India.\n\nHe also wrote The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completing and Balancing. In Arabic, that’s Kitabl al-muktasar fi hisab al-jabar wa’l-muqubalah. That was the first book of modern algebra – or the “al jabar” of the book’s title. But that’s not the last we hear of al-Khwarizmi.\n\nFast-forward to the career of Gerbert of Aurillac and beyond. Gerbert was an absolute whiz with the abacus, which was the personal computer of its day. For a couple of centuries, monastery schools used the abacus to teach arithmetic. Eventually they evolved from shuffling beads on a counting board to calculating with pen on parchment or with stylus on a wax tablet. They used as a guide a Latin translation of On Indian Calculation by al-Khwarizmi. The Latinized form of his name is “Algorismus.”\n\nSo it is that we get both algebra and algorithms from the math whiz of Baghdad.\n\nBut as with all evolutions in thought and methods, change was resisted. In 1299, the money changers of Florence, Italy, got into the act. They didn’t trust the Arabic numerals, so they banned the use of “letters of the abacus.” They decreed that no one “dare or allow that he or another write or let write in his account books or ledgers or in any part of it in which he writes debits and credits, anything that is written by means of or in letters of the abacus, but let him write it openly and full by way of letters.”\n\nMore than 1,100 years later, we in America still adhere to that proscription – or to some of it, anyway. As I learned when I was a banker-in-training, the Law of Negotiable Instruments states that such an instrument. i.e. a check, must have the amount written out in both numbers and words. If the sums differ, then the verbal one is the official amount.\n\nNow you know the rest of the story.\n\nAs I write this, it’s the last day of February. Presidents are on everyone’s mind.\n\nLast week, the country celebrated Presidents’ Day. It used to be Washington’s Birthday, celebrated on February 22. He was born on that date in 1732, but did you know that he actually was born on February 11, 1731? At the time of his birth, the Julian calendar was still in use, and would be for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar was adopted in 1752, adding a year and 11 days, in order to more accurately calculate leap years.\n\nThen there’s Lincoln’s Birthday on February 12. Abe deserves his own holiday, in my opinion, but he didn’t get one. I suppose that a Presidents’ Day, in which we honor both of these giants of American history, is a reasonable approach.\n\nThis year too, we’re going to be electing a president, come November. So we’re all thinking of that, and mostly with some trepidation. I don’t think I’m being too overtly political here when I say that most likely you agree with me and with most of America that none of the prospective candidates for the November ballot is in any way comparable to our Founding Fathers.\n\nThe Founders, after all, were brave, articulate, forthright men of sterling character. They put their lives on the line. And they were totally honest. All the time. Beginning with that felled cherry tree in George Washington’s back yard, they never told a lie. Always played it straight.\n\nEr, not exactly. Not all the time. But sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do, even if it means lying or exaggerating or dissembling. And history will reward you for it, if you play for the good guys. Consider these little-known backstories about two of our most revered founders, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.\n\nTake Jefferson and his writing of the Declaration of Independence. Without a doubt, that document is masterful and sublime – at least at the beginning, with the “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness….” And so on.\n\nBut that first section ends with “The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.”\n\nThose “facts,” are anything but facts. Rather, they are 28 ad-hominem accusations against King George III, a king to whom on December 6, 1775, the Second Continental Congress had declared its allegiance while distancing itself from the real oppressors, the British Parliament: “Allegiance to Parliament? We never owed – we never owned it. Allegiance to our King? We have ever avowed it – our conduct has been ever consistent with it.”\n\nSo what happened, over the following six months? Did George III turn into a hateful monster? Did he desire to put into place a reign of tyranny and terror? Of course not. But Thomas Jefferson, probably the most facile wordsmith of all the leaders in the colonies, had to paint the King as just such a villain. He had to make it personal. The nuanced truth behind the issues be damned. And it worked.\n\nAndrew Roberts’s fine book, “The Last King of America,” takes up the rhetorical excesses of the Declaration of Independence in great detail. He maintains that, because it was the King to whom Congress had recently declared allegiance, “unless it took the form of a personal attack, it would not answer the Loyalists’ argument that it was possible to become independent of Britain but remain in a political condominium of some sort with the Crown.”\n\nIn other words, they had to go negative – sound familiar? – and do it in a personal manner which also had to be untruthful in the extreme. The 28 charges “were kept deliberately unspecific regarding places and dates, for the obvious reason that most were untrue, since George had never sought to establish any kind of tyranny over America.”\n\nSpace doesn’t allow us to go into the detail that Roberts lays out. But here are just a few examples:\n\n“He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.” Well, yeah. The French and Indian War had concluded in 1763, and according to Roberts “a standing army on the western border had been the only way of protecting the colonies; the colonies had actually voted their thanks for what the British army had done.”\n\n“He has transported us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offences.” That never happened. A law allowing for this had been in place since the time on Henry VIII, and it was to deal with traitors and treasonable crimes. But George III never used it.\n\n“He has transported large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.” But Jefferson failed to mention that, fighting on America’s side, were Baron von Steuben, the Marquis de Lafayette, General Casimir Pulaski’s Legion, Bartholomew von Heer’s Provost Corps, and General Armand’s Independent Chasseurs.\n\n“He has excited domestic insurrections against us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.” Jefferson must have forgotten that Congress tried to outbid the British for the supports of the Indigenous Nations, and that Stockbridge Native Americans were members of the Massachusetts Militia, and that Massachusetts had a provincial alliance with the Mohawks.\n\n“He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.” This points to the destruction of Norfolk, Virginia. Only problem was that Norfolk was primarily a Loyalist town and the burning was done by the Patriots, not by the Redcoats.\n\nBy now, I think you get the point. Thomas Jefferson never let the facts get in the way of a good story. And that final item lets us segue neatly into an adventure in plausible deniability by the father of our country, George Washington. He was almost certainly involved in and ultimately responsible for “The Great Fire of 1776” in New York. More than 500 buildings, including Trinity and Lutheran churches, were destroyed.\n\nBritish soldiers had marched triumphantly into New York on September 15, 1776. Washington’s army had to flee, but six nights later, fire broke out in the city’s southern wharves. There were no bells left in the city of sound the alarm; Washington’s men had taken them all for cannon fodder. Strong winds had spread the blaze and turned much of the city, which was also teeming with Loyalists, into a waste land.\n\nWashington had wanted to burn the city down before he fled, but Congress forbade it and told him to make a peaceful retreat. He complied grudgingly.\n\nBut two weeks later, writing to Lund Washington, a distant relative and manager of his Mount Vernon estate, GW stated, “Providence – or some good honest Fellow, has done more for us than we were disposed to do ourselves.”\n\nThe rhetoric on the Patriots’ side claimed it was indeed some divine providence, or perhaps even British soldiers out plundering the city, that started the blaze. The Brits believed otherwise, pointing out that arsonists had to have done it because the blaze broke out in several places at once. They also pointed to Washington’s absconding with the fire bells as something that couldn’t have been a coincidence.\n\nA subsequent investigation by the Brits couldn’t prove anything. But in June 1777, they caught Abraham Patten, a spy who was plotting to set afire the town of Brunswick, NJ. Before he was hanged as a spy, Patten admitted that he had helped start the New York fire. He didn’t name any accomplices, however. Shortly thereafter, Washington wrote to John Hancock and requested that they secure some funds for Patten’s widow.\n\nNo, we can’t expect our presidents to be totally honest all the time. We should know that by now. And they should have known it back in 1776. Some things never change.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the Christmas hymn:\n\n“Good King Wenceslas looked out\n\nOn the Feast of Stephen”\n\nMaybe you’ve even heard the joke about how he like his pizza cooked:\n\n“Deep and crisp and even.”\n\nBut who was this guy, the patron saint of the Czech Republic, whose statue stands in Wenceslas Square in Prague? Legend holds that if the Czech homeland is ever threatened, the statue will come to life, summon the army that sleeps beneath Mount Blanik, ready to defend the homeland. Wenceslas will wield his sword, which is hidden under the stones of the Charles Bridge and is to be found by a child when peril from enemies looms for Prague.\n\nHere’s the rest of the story. There was actually a Wenceslas – real name Václav the Good, as Wenceslas is the Latinized version. He wasn’t a king; rather, he was Duke of Bohemia. He apparently was a very nice guy. He was from a very dysfunctional family, and he died because of his opposition to slavery.\n\nYes, slavery. It wasn’t invented in the American South. They used to have it all over Europe. And Prague was the main market for slaves who were being moved overland from central Europe to the west and south.\n\nWenceslas was against slavery; he would buy slaves himself and set them free. But he ticked off three rich guys who had made big money in the slave trade. Their names were Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa; all three of them stabbed him before his own brother, Boleslas, ran him through with a lance.\n\nBoleslas, the bad guy, took over the realm and knew where his bread was buttered. He, nominally Christian like Wenceslas, let the slavers make their money. He reigned for more than 35 years.\n\nIt didn’t matter that Boleslas already ruled over half the country at the time of the killing. It wasn’t enough for him, and it was the money that mattered.\n\nAccording to “Christendom” by historian Peter Heather, Christianity was spreading throughout Europe in those years, driven largely by the political decrees and conquests in the long reigns of Charlemagne and his son, Louis the Pious.\n\nVáclav and Boleslas’s father, Vratislaus I, was the Duke of Bohemia and a Christian. Their mother Drahomíra, though baptized before the marriage, was aligned with Bohemia’s pagans. As a child, Václav was raised largely by his Christian paternal grandmother, Ludmila — who was later canonized as a saint in her own right.\n\nWhen Václav was about 13, his father died in battle and Ludmila became regent. But the regency did not last long. His mother Drahomíra had Ludmila killed, and she then tried to suppress Bohemia’s Christians.\n\nWhen Václav became Duke of Bohemia himself at age 18 and came of age, he banished his mother and foiled her suppression plans by working to spread Christianity. He commissioned the building of several churches including part of what is now St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. He also developed a reputation as a wise and compassionate ruler, known for his deeds of mercy.\n\nBut to try and avoid disputes, the country was split in two, and half was given to the younger brother, Boleslas. But Boleslas wanted the whole enchilada. He also remained the favored son of Drahomira. In September 935 he plotted with the slave-owning a group of noblemen to kill his brother. He did so by exploiting Wenceslas’s religious faith. He invited Václav to a church dedication on Sept. 27, 929. The next day, while Václav was on his way to prayer, Boleslas and his henchman attacked and killed him.\n\nOnly the good die young. Wenceslas was 22. On the base of his statue, the inscription reads “Saint Wenceslas, duke of the Czech land, prince of ours, do not let perish us nor our descendants.’”\n\nI’m told by those who’ve visited that part of Europe that Prague is a particularly beautiful city and that the Charles Bridge is spectacular. That’s one place I’d love to visit. But I won’t be diving into the Vltava River and searching though the rocks for Wenceslas’s sword. As the legend tells us, that’s a job reserved for a child.\n\nDid you ever have one of those job interviews in which the robot doing the hiring looked down the list of boilerplate questions and asked, “Where do you see yourself in five years?”\n\nDidn’t you hate that? I did. I always mumbled something that didn’t meet expectations. But I must tell you of the one answer that I wished I’d had the wits to deliver. It was by Jim, a former work colleague who was looking for a humdrum emerging-from-retirement position, answering the phone at an insurance company’s customer inquiry desk.\n\n“I see myself in a rocking chair on my front porch in five years.”\n\nHe got the job. Maybe because he was both prescient and honest.\n\nJim’s cheeky reply came to mind today when I read a magazine piece (National Review, February 2024 edition) about another magazine, long since out of business. That magazine was Saturday Review/World, and the year was 1974. The editor, antinuclear activist Norman Cousins (1915-1990) conceived and published an entire issue titled “2024 A.D.” Beneath that banner headline came the subtitle “A probe into the future by…” followed by nineteen names of the most eminent minds of the day.\n\nSo how did they do?\n\nSome of them whiffed. Astronaut Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) predicted that by 2024 there would be colonies of humans on the moon, with “massive subterranean lunar cities, ‘underground apartments and workrooms…connected by tunnels and powered by giant solar generators and flywheels spinning at incredibly high speed.’” He also said that we’d have had manned space flights to Mars and probably a few selected asteroids.\n\nNone of that happened, of course. In case you’d forgotten (I did) the last U.S. moon landing was back in 1972, two years before Armstrong made this prediction.\n\nFaring little better than Armstrong was Clare Boothe Luce (1903-1987),the playwright, congresswoman, and ambassador. Despite a few advances such as availability of birth control pills and better access to higher education, Luce lamented that there has been little progress in “overthrowing male supremacy…and achieving equality of the sexes….[and that the American woman of 2024 would be] playing many more roles that were once considered masculine. I see her making a little more money than she is making now. But I still see her trying to make her way up – in a man’s world – and not having much more success than she is having now.”\n\nNice try, Clare. Looks like you really didn’t have a lot of faith in women and their abilities.\n\nSo who got it right? Surprisingly (for me anyway) three of the best answers came from people who’d seen and lived in the darkest and cruelest recesses that humanity devised during the 20th Century: Communism and Nazism. Perhaps seeing those evil systems from the inside gives one a special clarity of mind. See if you agree.\n\nRussian physicist and human rights champion Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974, foresaw the unique role that “communications and information” would play, beginning with the creation of a “global telephone and videophone system. Then came his prophecy about what we could only call “the Internet:”\n\n“Far into the future, more than fifty years from now, I foresee a universal information system, (UIS) which will give everyone access at any given moment to the contents of any book that has ever been published or any magazine or any fact. The UIS will have individual miniature-computer terminals, central-control points for the flood of information, and communication channels incorporating thousands of artificial communications from satellites, cables, and laser lines.\n\n“Even the partial realization of the UIS will profoundly affect every person, his leisure activities, and his intellectual and artistic development. Unlike television, the major source of information for many of our contemporaries, the UIS will give each person the maximum freedom of choice and will require individual activities.”\n\nWow. Sakharov was off a little bit on his timing, but that’s all.\n\nMilovan Djilas (1911-1995) was from Yugoslavia. He was a higher-up in the regime of dictator Josip Broz (Tito), but he became disillusioned with communism and spent six years in prison for his honesty. He saw what would happen in his part of the world when he wrote:\n\n“The most significant change in the next fifty years will be the disintegration of the Soviet empire…The crucial factors will be the domestic ferment and the pressure from China…[and possibly] uprisings in Eastern Europe…With the collapse of the Soviet empire, the Eastern European countries now under Soviet hegemony will become independent and will join the European community. Germany will be reunited, without a civil war.”\n\nGot that right.\n\nAnd how about Wernher von Braun (1912-1977), the rocketry whiz who designed the V-1 and V-2 rockets that rained down on Britain from Adolf Hitler’s Germany, and who came to America after World War II and was the guiding genius behind the Saturn Rocket program?\n\nWith a vision much like that of Sakharov, the former Nazi foresaw the power and ubiquity of orbiting satellites, which would spawn a “revolution…a global telephone network interconnecting nearly 100 nations…handling millions of television channels simultaneously and billions of telephone conversations [and providing] direct ties between computers in support of such operations as banking or ticket reservations.”\n\nThere was even more, and finely detailed it was, to von Braun’s preview:\n\n“Controlled by an orbital switchboard, laser beam connections could be established (and withdrawn after use) that provide direct links between any two points on Earth. The abundance of available channels would soon lead to worldwide video-telephone service. And as communications improve, commuting for work would go out of style. It would become more convenient to let electrons, rather than people, do the traveling.\n\n“The average American household of 2024 will be equipped with an appliance that combines the features of a television set with those of a desk computer and a Xerox machine. In addition to serving as a TV set and a print-out device for news, the push-button-controlled console will permit its owners to receive facsimile-radioed letters, review the shelves of a nearby grocery store, order food and dry goods, pay bills, balance books, and provide color-video-telephone service to any point on Earth.”\n\nNot totally accurate, but you get ample partial credit and a high final grade, Herr von Braun.\n\nSome others who contributed predictions to that 1974 Saturday Review/World were Indira Gandhi, Robert McNamara, Coretta Scott King, David Rockefeller, and Pierre Trudeau.\n\nThe NR piece does not mention any of their predictions. But it does surmise – and I think correctly – that it would be “difficult to imagine anyone convening a panel of ‘influencers’ like this today.” And that’s unfortunate. Society as a whole doesn’t have too many people to whom it can look, with trust and confidence, for advice and guidance.\n\nMaybe there are a few out there who can see the future as clearly as did Messrs. Sakharov, Djilas, and von Braun. But I wouldn’t know where to look for them.\n\n“Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?”\n\nThat’s Sir Toby Belch, speaking to Feste the Clown in “Twelfth Night.” During the Middle Ages, Christmas was a time of continuous feasting and merriment, which climaxed on Twelfth Night. The height of celebration became the night before, or eve, of Epiphany. The twelve day count actually begins with the night of December 25, the “first night.” The Twelfth Night is the night before Epiphany, and the twelfth day is Epiphany itself.\n\nFood and drink are there in abundance. A punch called “wassail,” consumed during Christmastime, is especially plentiful on Twelfth Night. Around the world, special pastries, such as the tortell and king cake, are baked on Twelfth Night. They are eaten the following day for the Feast of the Epiphany celebrations. That’s why Sir Toby speaks of the cakes and ale.\n\nSo here we are on January 5, the Eve of the Christian Feast of the Epiphany. The Twelfth Night revelry commemorates the visit of the Magi, the “Wise Men” from the East who followed the Star of Bethlehem and found the baby Jesus. But who were those guys anyway? Is there any grain of historical truth to this biblical legend?\n\nThere may be. Here’s the rest of the story.\n\nAccording to an op-ed in today’s Wall Street Journal, the “magoi” were surveyors of the night sky. Caspar, Balthazar, and Melchior could be called astronomers, astrologers, or magicians. However you label them, they were probably real people. The Latin word “magi” is the pluralization of the Greek singular “magos,” which signifies to the Latin-speaking world a Persian priest or “wise man.” The “magos” to the Greeks also connoted someone who was a sorcerer.\n\nThe WSJ piece goes on to state that the three were seeking not only scientific knowledge of the stars and planets, but they were also looking for divine portents. They were probably priests of the Zoroastrian faith, whose studies of astrology were their attempts to understand the relationship of the powers in the universe to humans.\n\nIf this is what they were up to, they would have had good reason to set out on their journey. Right around the time of Jesus’s birth, in 7 B.C., there was a “planetary conjunction,” in which Jupiter and Venus came very close to each other. They stayed close together in the sky for the better part of a year. Then, even more dramatically four years later, they sat just one-tenth of degree apart in the sky. On the morning of August 12 in 3 B.C., Jupiter and Venus sat just 1/10th a degree apart in the dawn sky. That’s one-fifth the diameter of the Full Moon. They appeared to be a single body about one-fifth the diameter of the full moon.\n\nWe actually had a similar conjunction in December of 2020. I remember going to Millennium Park, a high point in West Roxbury, to view it. There were hundreds of people, crunching through the now and carrying telescopes and binoculars, there who had the same idea. We did indeed see the “Christmas Star” in what was referred to as the Great Conjunction of December 2020.\n\nSo, to me anyway, it’s entirely plausible that these three wise men, scientists first and driven by their thirst for knowledge, did actually see something wonderful in the sky and hopped on their camels to find out what it was.\n\nThe Christian religion says that what they found was not an updated map of the sky, but another form of the ultimate good that they were seeking. They were the first people from a foreign land to see the God who had taken on a human nature in order to save humanity.\n\nThe Greek prefix “epi” can mean “upon” or “through;” think of how you use an epi-pen. And the Greek word “phaino” means “to appear;” you know what a “phenomenon” is. Christians call January 6 the Feast of the Epiphany, because God “showed himself” through his human form for the first time.\n\nNow you know the rest of the story, and whether or not you are a believer and whether or not your true love gives you twelve drummers drumming, may the peace and good will that we sang of in our Yuletide carols be with you and your loved ones this whole year through.\n\nI’ve been thinking about candles.\n\nIt’s rather hard not to, in this festive time of the year. As I write this, it’s three days before the Third Sunday of Advent on the Christian religious calendar. There’s an electric candle in my every front window. It’s also the eighth and final day of Hanukkah on the calendar of my Jewish brothers and sisters. All eight of their menorah candles are now lighted. (Actually, that’s not technically a menorah, as I just learned; more about that shortly.)\n\nLast Sunday at Mass, I saw the Advent Wreath up by the altar. Two purple candles were burning. They’ll light the third one, a pink candle, this coming Sunday. It’s called “Gaudete” Sunday – meaning “rejoice.” We’re supposed to be joyful because the Redeemer is almost here. That’s why candle three is pink.\n\nI’ll be there on Sunday morning, at 7:30 a.m. in St. Anne’s Church, Readville. I’ll see that pink candle’s flame. I’ll see as well the other two candles lighted for the mass, which is to be celebrated in memory of my Mary Ellen. She went home to God four years ago, on December 17, 2019, and this will be her anniversary mass.\n\nI know I’m supposed to be joyful, on this Gaudete Sunday. And I will, sort of. I know where she is, and I’m grateful that the Lord called her home and freed her from the prison that her body had become with Alzheimer’s Disease. My memories of our 42 years of marriage are happy ones. She is still with us as well, in the lives of our children, of her many siblings, and in the many hundreds of lives of the children she taught through her brilliant career in the classroom. Yes, all causes for rejoicing, even as the inevitable waves of sadness wash over me. Maybe this is what they mean by “mixed blessings.”\n\nThe readings I’ll hear at the mass show just that mixing; perhaps more poignantly, to me, they also point toward Mary Ellen and what she did for others during her time here on earth. Like the candles, she brought her own special light to the world. More of that anon, too.\n\nThe first reading from Isaiah says “…he has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted.” Thanks for that, Isaiah. You’ve come to the right place.\n\nThe responsorial psalm is not, as is customary, from David. This time it’s from Mary, the only psalm we have from her: “My soul rejoices in my God.” And “…the Almighty has done great things for me.” Yes, I can’t disagree with that. Every morning I awake with a prayer of thanks for the Lord’s giving me a new day; and on this Sunday especially, I’ll say that prayer of thanks that he sent Mary Ellen to me. Great things, indeed.\n\nThe second reading, from Paul to the Thessalonians, begins “Brothers and sisters. Rejoice always.” Well, okay, but see the paragraph directly above for my best reason why.\n\nThe gospel is from Luke, and it’s the passage about John the Baptist as the voice crying in the wilderness to make straight the way of the Lord. It also says “He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.”\n\nAh, there it is again. The light. From candles, yes, but from us and our loved ones as well.\n\nCoincidentally, I recently visited the guest book for Mary Ellen’s obituary on Legacy.com. Perusing all the wonderful things that people – many of them her former students and parents of students – took the time to write about her made me very happy. One, however, from a contemporary and former teaching colleague, was spot-on for this meditation on lights and candles. She wrote:\n\n“Although I have not seen Mary Ellen in many years, it is apparent that the same Jesus who beckoned her to join the Sisters of St. Joseph for a short time, has been alive within her as she lived out her vocation to her husband, her children, her family, her first graders, and her professional colleagues.\n\n“Having carried the Light of Jesus to all those in her life, and having shared in His Cross during her time of physical suffering, is she not now enjoying eternal life with Him Who beckoned her home last week? Surely, this is the greatest lesson of the thousands of lessons Mary Ellen taught during her lifetime.”\n\nTears of gratitude for that one. Yes, Mary Ellen did carry the light of Jesus to all those in her life. We weren’t Jewish, but she was the personification of a shamash.\n\nWhat’s a shamash? This brings me, at long last, to what I said in the first paragraph about menorahs. As I just learned, in researching for this post, the Menorah is actually a seven-branched candelabrum, used in the Temple and Tabernacle. That’s technically not what we see at Hanukkah. We see instead the Hanukkiah, a nine-branched candelabrum used for the Hanukkah Festival of lights.\n\nThe Hanukkiah has one candle for each of the eight days of the festival. It also holds the shamash candle, which is used to light all the others and to show the way.\n\nAs the website Chabad.org puts it:\n\n“The shamash serves as a lesson to educators and leaders everywhere. The shamash is not a mitzvah candle. Yet, it is important because it is the instrument that enables all the other candles to form a mitzvah.\n\n“Each of us has the potential to be a shamash. We all have a responsibility to become teachers and impact the lives of others. Just as the shamash is usually placed above the other candles, a person who serves others, a teacher, becomes great because he or she is using a set of superior skills to make others great too.”\n\nYes, Mary Ellen was a shamash.\n\nAnd so, on Gaudete Sunday, at her fourth anniversary mass, I’ll have ample reason to rejoice and to be thankful that she and I shared much of our earthly lives together.\n\nWomen who read the love poems of Unfurled, Catherine Marenghi’s latest book, will close the book, sigh, and smile knowingly. They’ve been there.\n\nMen who read the love poems of Unfurled will close the book, sigh, and smile wistfully. They wish they could go there.\n\nBoth women and men will close the book, sigh, and reach for the nightstand. Instinctively. They’ve got an overwhelming urge for a cigarette.\n\nWho wouldn’t crave a smoke after surfacing from a plunge into Ms Marenghi’s erotic oeuvre? Here’s just a taste:\n\nIn Having You:\n\nI could tell you that I miss\n\nThose predawn hours, my skin\n\nNesting into yours, feeling\n\nThat familiar nudge\n\nMy body opening its eyes\n\nIn sweet recognition.\n\nIn Upon Being Kissed by a Man for the First Time in Seven Years:\n\nI want to inhale him into my mouth,\n\nlet him liquefy on my tongue\n\nlike confectioners’ sugar—\n\nIn Certainty:\n\nBut then you meet a man\n\nand now a shared cup of coffee steams\n\nlike a tango on a Mexican dance floor.\n\nOne look from him is enough\n\nto clamp you like strong thighs.\n\nAnd words and tears flow equally,\n\nwithout fear or shame.\n\nOh, yeah. Gimme another cigarette.\n\nBut wait. This wonderful collection of 37 poems is not a book of erotica. There’s joyful sex aplenty, but The Joy of Sex it isn’t. So if I gave you the wrong impression, I apologize.\n\nThis is a book about love. That’s why its subtitle is Love Poems and not Provocative Poetry. It’s not just about the carnal love of woman for man, and vice versa. Rather, it’s a rapt immersion in love’s nearly bottomless, untamable emotions, both blissful and painful.\n\nAs William Wordsworth wrote in The Prelude, “words can give, / A substance and a life to what I feel.” Ms Marenghi takes her readers by the hand and, with her felicitous diction and her gift for well-turned metaphor, tells us what she felt and what we undoubtedly felt as well, in the delight and passion of our own experiences of love in all its forms.\n\nThe first time I read through Unfurled, I thought of The Bible. I wrote a little blurb that I think came close to the mark. I’ll stick with it here:\n\n“Bible scholars say that The Song of Songs presents an inspired portrayal of human love and a resounding affirmation of the goodness of human sexuality. With her love poetry, Catherine Marenghi re-affirms all that goodness for us and proves herself a worthy successor to King Solomon.”\n\nThe above is true, but I’ll also say that she goes Solomon one better. Because there’s much more than the erotic, the sexual, in these pages. The old king never wrote about a cherished little brother and the heartbreaking lesson in life he imparted at the age of eight before his tragic death a year later, as Ms Marenghi tell us in The Only Question:\n\nHe seemed to know\n\nhow little time there was\n\nHis ninth birthday, already\n\nchoked with pneumonia, he was\n\nswallowing his own death\n\nNor did Solomon ever anthropomorphize his original temple and tell us how it felt before he built that grand new one. But Ms Marenghi’s award-winning poem The Affair does that; her old house, realizing she’s being abandoned for a new house in a warmer clime,\n\n“began to will herself\n\nto rot at her sills,\n\nclench her roof shingles\n\ntill they swallowed the rain\n\nand stained her plaster ceilings.\n\nYou will pay for this, she said,\n\nNo one will want me now.”\n\nAnd here’s one that gave a chuckle to a few ladies I know. Solomon never had any need to use a dating app, but apparently Ms Marenghi did. In Bio for Match.com, after describing several gritty and unattractive details about where she lives, she continues\n\nShall we tell the boys that?\n\nIt would be more biographical than\n\nHer favorite song, favorite book,\n\nFavorite film, whether she’s Catholic,\n\nJewish, “spiritual but not religious.”\n\nTo every question, she replies,\n\nNone of the above.\n\nThere was even a hint of Edna St. Vincent Millay’s sharp elbows and give-no-quarter attitude in Forgiveness; breaking up a disappointing relationship, she declares\n\nThis will be a kindness shown\n\nto me, and not to you.\n\nI unwrap this tightness that\n\nhad bound me to you.\n\nNotwithstanding all the above excerpts and selections, I don’t want this post to be merely a book review. I’d like to say a bit about Catherine Marenghi, storyteller and poetry reader, as well. Back in April, which was National Poetry Month, she gave a reading and talk in her native town of Milford, Massachusetts. It was in a library, just across the street from the junior high school where a young substitute teacher named Mrs. Robbins launched Ms Marenghi into her career as a poet. And she did it with a single word: “Wow!”\n\nThe author opened the reading with a yet-unpublished poem dedicated to that teacher. For me, it was the most touchingly poignant moment of the entire evening. “Wow! You can write!” was the teacher’s comment on a poetry assignment. The children in the class, but most especially Catherine Marenghi, loved Mrs. Robbins. They thrilled to how she respected them, encouraged them, and made them feel about themselves and their work. But tragically, that beloved teacher ended her own life by suicide a few years later. No one knows why. But I couldn’t help thinking…if only she had felt the love that all of her students had for her. If only she could have heard the poem that I heard, the one dedicated to her by her most accomplished and most loving student of all.\n\nLove and emotion, indeed.\n\nWe heard yet more varieties of love – or, more precisely, of loving feelings in other contexts – in readings from her earlier book, Breaking Bread. There was her motherly love for her only son; first, as he entered kindergarten, and then many years later, as he prepared to move across the country to begin graduate school in a distant state. Then there was the almost elegiac feeling of love during a visit to her own elderly mother, nursing-home bound and already cloaked in the mists of dementia.\n\nBoth in her reading that night, and in the post-script to the book, Ms Marenghi mentioned her not-so-hidden agenda: to combat the insidious and ubiquitous prejudice of ageism. “As a woman of my late sixties as of this writing, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover that the capacity for love – including physical, erotic love — does not diminish with age.”\n\nWe who are of that age group undoubtedly concur and appreciate that, especially after reading and pondering What Remains of the Light, the second-to-last poem in the book.\n\nWe all need poets and poetry. As Robin Williams, in his role as John Keating in Dead Poets Society, puts it, “We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.”\n\nWe also need poets to be our guides, sharing their intensely private and personal experiences in order to connect us with what we may have felt but did not really understand and could not yet articulate. I can’t think of a more reliable guide through the realm of human love than Catherine Marenghi.\n\nAnd as for Unfurled, I recommend it unreservedly. Savor it. Re-read it. Keep it on your nightstand. Right next to that pack of cigarettes.\n\nI’m not big on science fiction, so I never saw that Keanu Reeves movie about a dystopian future; Wikipedia calls “The Matrix” “the cyberpunk of science fiction.” Not my thing. I do vaguely remember matrices from Algebra II. Wasn’t very good at them or that subject, but at least I passed.\n\nSo, what is a matrix, anyway? Did you know that it is a womb, that wellspring of all life on earth, that precious gift carried by the female of all species?\n\nI didn’t know either, but now I do. I saw it in my King James Bible, my 2022 Christmas gift to myself. More about that remarkable piece of literature presently.\n\nIn Exodus 12, God unleashes the Angel of Death upon the Egyptians, that final plague which will at last persuade Pharaoh to let his people go. The angel passes over and does not enter the houses of the Israelites when he sees the blood on their doorposts lintels.\n\nNear the end of Chapter 12, God lays out the rules of the Passover commemoration. At the beginning of Chapter 13, He tells Moses, “Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast, it is mine.”\n\nNow here, Exodus 13: 12, 15, when Moses is repeating the Lord’s instructions to the people, is the passage that struck me:\n\n“That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males shall be the Lord’s…And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all of the first born of the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males; but the firstborn of my children I shall redeem.”\n\nI’ve checked several other translations of the Bible, and none that I’ve seen say “matrix” in the above passage. Not even the New King James version. Why, I wondered, did this happen here, and apparently only here?\n\nLet’s start with an online search. I found several definitions of matrix; most were mathematical or scientific. But here’s one clue. According to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, the second, and formal, definition is “the formal social, political, etc. situation from which a society or person grows and develops,” e.g. “the European cultural matrix.”\n\nWell, if it’s something from which one grows and develops, that seems pretty close to a mother’s womb, does it not? Even the word itself seems quite close to the Latin word for mother: mater.\n\nSo how did it get into the King James Bible? For a clue, I suggest God’s Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible, by Adam Nicolson. The King James Bible is regarded, rightly I believe, as Nicolson says in the preface “the greatest work in prose ever written in English.”\n\nAnd who wrote it? This is the amazing part. It’s the work of a committee. There’s the old joke about a camel’s being a horse designed by a committee. And there’s another saying attributed to G.K. Chesterton: “I’ve searched all the parks in all the cities and never found a statue to a committee.”\n\nBut the King James Bible is the exception that proves the rule. Six companies of translators, of whom we know about fifty names, did the job for King James I of England. They were mostly high-ranking churchmen and academics, all very well connected to the political establishment. And they had to be. Their job wasn’t a religious or theological one. It was profoundly political.\n\nJames I had come down the Great North Road from Scotland, where he had been known as James VI. He had been king there since the age of one, when his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, was deposed. She was eventually executed in 1587 for plotting to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I. James succeeded the long-lived Elizabeth in 1603.\n\nTo say that he started off rather precariously is an understatement. Liz I had stayed long past her time, and there was a lot of bad stuff going on: a plague, the Gunpowder Plot, Catholic power-grab attempts both real and imagined. James, as king, was head of the Church of England. There were a lot of competing bibles already in circulation, and they were unending sources of trouble.\n\nJust a few examples – William Tyndale, a Lutheran, had to flee to the continent when it looked like his translation was going to offend the authorities. He ended up being murdered – garroted — in Flanders, betrayed by an English spy who was probably working for Thomas More, according to Nicolson. Then there was the Calvinist Geneva Bible, an artfully done book that unfortunately contained many explanatory notes that attacked the idea of unfettered royal power. That was the bible brought to America by the Pilgrims; it wasn’t welcome in England, obviously.\n\nJames needed a bible that would reinforce his power as head of the Church of England and king of the realm. That’s why he assembled his translators and set them to work. It was politics. Religious doctrine and beliefs took a back seat.\n\nBut the finished product wasn’t a propaganda piece, either. It didn’t attempt to beat back the fashionable and controversial Puritan doctrines or to compete with the Catholics’ Douay-Rheims Bible. The translators weren’t shameless political suck-ups. They consulted all available versions of the bible in the course of their work, but they also went back to the sources, poring over ancient Greek and Hebrew texts. They wanted to produce something universal, rather than contemporary.\n\nThey succeeded brilliantly, with a bible worthy of the age of Shakespeare, one whose “subject is majesty, not tyranny, and its political purpose was unifying and enfolding, to elide the kingliness of God with the godliness of kings, to make royal power and divine glory one indivisible garment which could be wrapped around the nation as a whole,” as Nicolson sums it up.\n\nThe First Westminster Company of translators took charge of the first twelve books of the King James Bible. It was they who selected “matrix” as the precise word for that rendition of Mosaic Law. Their director, Lancelot Andrewes, had been Royal Chaplain to both Elizabeth and James. He “could look the church’s adversaries in the eye, and he was clever enough to slalom around the complexities of theological dispute; not only a great scholar but also a government man, aware of political realities, able to articulate the correct version of the truth. He was a trusty…and used for his extensive network of connections.”\n\nLancelot Andrewes spent five hours every morning in prayer, much of it as he cried copious tears, weeping for the miserableness of his soul. Maybe he had a guilty conscience. You could say that Andrewes got a helping hand, albeit indirectly, from whores and hookers. Oops, sorry, I mean “sex workers.” How so?\n\nHe was also a former Bishop of Winchester. That was one of the most lucrative bishop gigs in the entire Church of England, thanks in large part to the efforts of “Winchester Geese.” Real geese dotted much of the Winchester landscape back in those times, but the area also had a robust and profitable prostitution industry. The busy and popular ladies of the evening were nicknamed after the geese.\n\nThe bishop of Winchester had vast land tracts and many properties that housed the dens of iniquity. Much of the bishop’s income came directly from those “Winchester Geese.” Profits from the brothel business also paid for the founding and upkeep of several of Oxford’s most prestigious institutions – New College, Magdalen, and Corpus Christi among them.\n\nYou might remember the 1966 pop song “Winchester Cathedral” by the New Vaudeville Band. If you do, you recall that the singer lamented “Winchester Cathedral, You’re bringing me down. You stood and you watched as my baby left town.”\n\nShe probably left town because he didn’t pay his bill.\n\nAnd now you know the rest of the story – of several stories, actually. I hope I’ve added even a little bit to your worldly wisdom, because\n\n“He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fooles shall be destroyed.”\n\n–Proverbs 13:20\n\nToday’s post was prompted by a lengthy article titled “A Theology of the Present Moment,” by novelist Marilynne Robinson. It appeared in the December 22, 2022 issue of the New York Review of Books. Her piece is an intellectually challenging discussion of the interplay between science and religion; I had to read it at least twice in order to begin to understand what she was getting at. It’s been worth the effort.\n\nBut here’s the part that jumped out at me. She sets the stage for it by recounting, from Genesis, the story of Joseph. He is sold into slavery by his brothers, but later on he comes to great power in Egypt and forgives them. They had evil intent. God turned it around and made it good. Robinson sums it up by saying “One cruel prank opened into a major event in the history of the world.”\n\nShe goes on to make some grim observations that everybody might do well to keep in mind today:\n\n“Most people in the world would say their lives are insignificant, historically speaking, but it might be prudent to consider whether the relative blamelessness that is assumed to come with insignificance can be relied upon. We are not competent to decide how much we matter in the long term.\n\n“One of my favorite Puritans – the seventeenth-century divine John Flavel – said that we will be judged twice, once when we die and once when everything we have said or done has had its final effect. Whisper a cruel rumor – who knows what force it will acquire if it lives.”\n\nA little later, she quotes the apostle James: “So the tongue is a little member and boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire.”\n\nAnd from there, she recounts “Over centuries slanders have burned heretics and witches, launched pogroms and inquisitions, inspired lynchings and purges. Now we have grown used to hearing Americans calling Americans demons, Satanists, and pedophiles – utterly damning language, abetted by the Internet but not qualitatively different from the language that fueled the great fires of hatred and fear that mar and disgrace Western history.”\n\n“We can see with our own eyes how exciting this conflagration is to many people in this country, even while it threatens to consume democracy, root and branch. Our children and their children will grow up in a country much changed by this, not for the better. The most effective polemicist of the day is legislating for our descendants. And anyone who gives force to his or her word will be liable to that second judgment. These crimes are collective, and a nod or silence is complicity.”\n\nWhew! There’s a good deal of truthful insight here, and as I noted above it’s good to keep these observations in mind. But talk about a worst-case scenario. Is this the whole story?\n\nThankfully, it’s not the whole story.\n\nWe can’t summarily dismiss Marilynne’s dark vision. She’s right in saying that, while we might think our own lives are insignificant, we just don’t know what effects even our seemingly small deeds and casually-spoken words can have in the immediate moment and very far into the future. She also seems to be right that we’ll all be liable to that “second judgment.” But that second judgment won’t inevitably damn us all to hell. In fact, the perpetually-revising second judgments will continually boost many of us to ever-higher places in the heavenly spheres.\n\nI state this with confidence, for two reasons: my work as a Holocaust educator, and my wife Mary Ellen’s work as an elementary school teacher.\n\nLet’s take the more complex one first, the Holocaust. My research for Mary Wygodski’s biography, Evil Must Not Have the Last Word, led me to develop an adult-education course that I’ve delivered at least a dozen times over the past four years or so. In that course, I devote considerable time to stories of The Righteous Gentiles, those people who risked all they had to shield and save Jewish victims of the Nazis.\n\nThe Holocaust, the organized murder of six million Jews, was one of those great fires of hatred and fear that Marilynne Robinson speaks of. But not everyone in the countries where it happened was a participant; not everyone was silently complicit. As of January, 2022, Israel’s Yad Vashem Remembrance Center had identified and documented 28,217 individuals who saved the life of at least one Jewish person. In most cases, it was more than one Jew whose life was saved by each of those righteous folks.\n\nJust think about it. Here we are, three generations later. The descendants of those who were saved now number in the hundreds of thousands. The “second judgment meter” is still running for the rescuers. It will never stop, really. And I can only imagine that it’s running in a positive direction.\n\nThere’s one more point to be made about these rescuers and righteous: they were all so ordinary, so unimpressive by any earthly measure. As Marilynne might describe them, they were “insignificant.”\n\nHere’s just one example. Poland, the country that lost three million of its 3.3 million Jews, can also claim 7,232 righteous gentiles. That’s more than any other country, by far. Yad Vashem was able to document the professions of around 2,000 of them. The largest category? Peasants and foresters, numbering 1,266. None of the fourteen other categories even had 100 members.\n\nIt was the poor, property-less people in Poland who saved at least ten thousand lives, and probably more. Maybe they, too, thought their own lives were insignificant. How wrong they would be to think that.\n\nThe other thing that came to mind, the life and 30+-year teaching career of Mary Ellen, brought back a glow of pride in what my son Matthew wrote about her when she died three years ago. I posted the full text on this blog site, and you can read it here.\n\nMatt’s mention of a Buddhist religious belief was very close to Marilynne Robinson’s point about the two judgments. He wrote, “…this concept stipulates that everyone actually dies twice. The first time is when you shuffle off this earthly body. And the second time occurs when the last person who remembers you, passes away. And the reason is that everyone in your life, everyone you meet, carries with them the thoughts, the memories, and the influences that you had on their life.”\n\nMatt wasn’t talking solely about us, the members of the immediate family and Mary Ellen’s close friends. He also wrote of some 770 former grade-school children. They’re all adults now, or close to adulthood. It will be at least 60 years before the last of them passes away. Probably longer.\n\nSo, my beloved wife will be alive in the Buddhist tradition for decades to come. And I’m further comforted in knowing that the second judgment she will face will not come for many years after that, if ever. I know how she shaped so many lives for the better, how she launched innumerable careers in the best way imaginable. That second judgment will be a joyous coronation for her.\n\nWhere am I going with all this? I’m finished, so it’s better to ask where I’ve been. I guess I’m happy with the way this piece turned out. I found a silver lining in the dark storm clouds that Marilynne Robinson’s perceptive assessment pointed out. And she wasn’t entirely negative in that assessment. She does point out that “the beauty of this view of things [the idea of two judgments] is that it acknowledges the reach and potency of our lives, for good or for ill.” She’s right in the points she makes. So, I think, am I, in seeking that silver lining.\n\nAll those little things that we say and do every day will be echoing down through the years. Let’s do our best to assure that those echoes are sweet and pleasant ones, and that the second judgment we face will be a favorable one"
