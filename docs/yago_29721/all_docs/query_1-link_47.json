        "text": "Ferdinand III (July 13, 1608 – April 2, 1657) was Archduke of Austria from 1621, King of Hungary and King of Croatia from 1625 and of Bohemia from 1627 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1637 to his death.\n\nFerdinand was born in Graz as the third son of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II of the House of Habsburg and his first wife, Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria, the fourth child and second (but eldest surviving) daughter of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand was baptised as Ferdinand Ernt. He grew up in Carinthia with loving care from his parents and developed great affection for his siblings and his father with whom he always found a consensus in future disagreements.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand became the reigning Archduke of Austria in 1621. On December 8, 1625, he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia, on November 27, 1627 he was crowned King of Bohemia.\n\nFerdinand enhanced his authority and set an important legal and military precedent by issuing a Revised Land Ordinance, which deprived the Bohemian estates of their right to raise soldiers and reserved that power for the monarch. His father Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II was unable to secure him the election as King of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg of 1630.\n\nKing Ferdinand married the Spanish Infanta, his cousin Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, after years of negotiations with Spanish relatives in 1631. Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was the daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I.\n\nPrior to her Imperial marriage Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was considered a possible wife for Charles, Prince of Wales. The event, later known in history as the “Spanish match”, provoked a domestic and political crisis in the kingdoms of England and Scotland.\n\nAlthough it was in the middle of the war, the elaborate wedding was celebrated over fourteen months. The marriage produced six children, including his successors, King Ferdinand IV of Hungary and Croatia and Emperor Leopold I.\n\nHis loving and intelligent wife and her brother, the Spanish Cardinal Infante Fernando, had a great influence on Ferdinand and formed the most important link between the Habsburg courts in Madrid, Brussels and Vienna in the difficult period of the war for the Habsburgs after the death of Wallenstein.\n\nKing Ferdinand III of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, Archduke of Austria was elected as King of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg on December 22, 1636. Upon the death of his father on February 15, 1637, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia is the collective name for two peace treaties signed on October 24, 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster. They ended the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and brought peace to the Holy Roman Empire, closing a calamitous period of European history. Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III, the kingdoms of France and Sweden, and their respective allies among the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, participated in the treaties.\n\nEurope had been battered by both the Thirty Years’ War and the Eighty Years’ War, exacting a heavy toll in money and lives. The Eighty Years’ War was a prolonged struggle for the independence of the Protestant-majority Dutch Republic (the modern Netherlands), supported by Protestant-majority England, against Catholic-dominated Spain and Portugal. The Thirty Years’ War was the most deadly of the European wars of religion, centred on the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe decentralization of the Holy Roman Empire was one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the war. The Holy Roman Empire had been in existence since the year 962 when King Otto I the Great of East Francia was crowned Emperor. By the 17th century the Holy Roman Empire covered most of Central Europe. It had a multi-ethnic and decentralized structure. The Emperor was nominally the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, but the Imperial estates were becoming increasingly more autonomous.\n\nBefore the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Western Europe had been Roman Catholic for about 1,000 years. During the Reformation, a number of Princes converted to Protestantism. Although there had been religious conflicts in the 16th century, the Thirty Years’ War was an extended, brutal conflict, one of the most gruesome wars in European history.\n\nThe war began in 1618 when the Catholic Emperor, Ferdinand II, a member of the House of Habsburg, tried to enforce religious uniformity on the Empire. Swedish and French intervention soon turned it into a European conflict concerning the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire, religion, and the power to rule in Europe.\n\nThe Peace of Prague (1635) ended most religious aspects of the war, and the French–Habsburg rivalry took over prominence. With between 4.5 million and 8 million dead in the Thirty Years’ War alone, and decades of constant warfare, the need for peace became increasingly clear.\n\nThe negotiation process was lengthy and complex. Talks took place in two cities, because each side wanted to meet on territory under its own control. A total of 109 delegations arrived to represent the belligerent states, but not all delegations were present at the same time.\n\nTwo treaties were signed to end the war in the Empire: the Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück. These treaties ended the Thirty Years’ War in the Holy Roman Empire, with the Habsburgs (rulers of Austria and Spain) and their Catholic allies on one side, battling the Protestant powers (Sweden and certain Holy Roman principalities) allied with France (though Catholic, France was strongly anti-Habsburg under King Louis XIV of France and Navarre).\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia granted freedom and land to several other territories within the Holy Roman Empire. As each colony and territory were granted their freedom, the power of the Church and the Holy Roman Empire fled with them.\n\nThe treaties also recognized the de facto independence of the Imperial States. The Imperial States were allowed to choose the religion for their territory as mentioned above, and were allowed to enter into alliances with each other and with foreigners for their security or preservation as long as the alliances were not directed against the Emperor, the Empire, the public peace, or the terms of the Westphalian Peace Treaties.\n\nThe power asserted by Emperor Ferdinand III was stripped from him and returned to the rulers of the Imperial States. Catholics and Lutherans were redefined as equal before the law, and Calvinism was given legal recognition as an official religion. The independence of the Dutch Republic, which practiced religious toleration, also provided a safe haven for European Jews.\n\nThe Holy See was very displeased at the settlement, with Pope Innocent X calling it “null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time” in the bull Zelo Domus Dei.\n\nWith the Peace of Westphalia it truly rendered the Holy Roman Empire an Empire in name only. With a considerable amount of autonomy returned to the Imperial States the emperor had little power or authority over the states. Despite being an elective monarchy, the House of Habsburg had firm control over the succession to the Imperial Throne.\n\nThe Habsburg Monarchy, also known as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands, were States that existed both inside and outside the Empire. The State’s inside the Empire ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy were the kingdom of Bohemia and the Archduchy of Austria.\n\nOutside the Empire the House of Habsburg where Kings of Hungary and Croatia. Therefore despite the fact that the Emperor had little authority over the Imperial States, the further fact that they ruled in areas both inside and outside the Empire still made the Habsburg Dynasty a power to be reckoned with.\n\nWith the Peace of Westphalia the slow decline of the empire was accelerated. Within 40 years the Empire would see the rise of the House of Hohenzollern as Kings in Prussia (later Kings of Prussia under Friedrich II the Great) and Prince-Electors of Brandenburg. The expanded State of Prussia which came to dominate Norther Germany became rivals against the Habsburg Monarchy for supremacy within German lands.\n\nIt is interesting to note that by the 18th century we will read more about Prussia and Austria as individual states and we will hear less about the Holy Roman Empire as a whole.\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm.\n\nThe Great Moravian realm was was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe, possibly including territories which are today part of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nBohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to Arnulf of Corinthia, King of East Francia in 895. Arnulf of Corinthia was also the disputed King of Italy from 894 and the disputed Emperor from February 22, 896, until his death at Regensburg, Bavaria.\n\nBohemia was at first ruled by the Přemyslid Dynasty. The dynasty’s origin dates back to the 9th century, when the Přemyslids ruled a tiny territory around Prague, populated by a tribe of the Western Slavs. Gradually they expanded, conquering much of the region of Bohemia, located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by the expansion of the Frankish Empire. The first historically-documented Přemyslid duke was Bořivoj I (867). DNA testing on the remains of his son, Spytihněv I, reveal the family’s Y-haplogroup to be R1b, second most common haplogroup in Czech republic.\n\nWhile the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dyntasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I the Great. Late Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in 935, became the land’s patron saint.\n\nWhile the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid Dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of Emperor Heinrich II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.\n\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philipp of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV.\n\nIn 1204 Ottokar’s royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Friedrich II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\n\nUnder these terms, the King of Bohemia was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king’s successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nThe King of Bohemia was a Prince-Elector of the Empire. The Kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian Dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. From 1526 until the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the Kingdom of Bohemia was part of the greater Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nNumerous kinrgs of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a Crown Land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire’s leading cities.\n\nThe Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed).\n\nGerman was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia peacefully deposed their communist government during the Velvet Revolution, which began on November 17, 1989 and ended 11 days later on November 28th when all of the top Communist leaders and Communist party itself resigned. On December 31, 1992 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nFerdinand II (July 9, 1578 – February 15, 1637) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia from 1619 until his death in 1637.\n\nChildhood\n\nBorn in the castle in Graz on July 9, 1578, Archduke Ferdinand was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nPrincess Maria Anna was a daughter of Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria and Archduchess Anna of Austria, sister of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I (1503–1564) from his marriage with the Jagiellonian princess Anna of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547).\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Bavaria was given an elementary education in Latin and religion but a high education in music, likely by Orlando di Lasso.\n\nOn August 26, 1571 in Vienna, the 20-year-old Maria Anna married her 31-year-old maternal uncle Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria. The marriage was arranged to give Austria political support from Bavaria and Bavaria an agent in Vienna.\n\nTheir marriage brought about a reconciliation between the two leading Catholic families of the Holy Roman Empire. They were devout Catholics, but Charles II had to grant concessions to his Lutheran subjects in 1572 and 1578 to secure the predominantly Protestant nobles and burghers’ financial support for the establishment of a new defense system against the Ottoman Turks.\n\nIn 1590, when Archduke Ferdinand was 11 years old, they sent him to study at the Jesuits’ college in Ingolstadt because they wanted to isolate him from the Lutheran nobles. A few months later, his father died, and he inherited Inner Austria–Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and smaller provinces. His cousin, the childless Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was the head of the Habsburg family, appointed regents to administer these lands.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand was installed as the actual ruler of the Inner Austrian provinces in 1596 and 1597. Emperor Rudolph II also charged him with the command of the defense of Croatia, Slavonia, and southeastern Hungary against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand regarded the regulation of religious issues as a royal prerogative and introduced strict Counter-Reformation measures from 1598. First, he ordered the expulsion of all Protestant pastors and teachers; next, he established special commissions to restore the Catholic parishes.\n\nOn April 23, 1600, Archduke Ferdinand of Inner Austria married his first cousin Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria married at Graz Cathedral. Born in Munich, she was the fourth child and second (but eldest surviving) daughter of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine.\n\nThis marriage reaffirmed the alliance between the House of Habsburg and House of Wittelsbach. Without interfering in politics, Maria Anna lived in her husband’s shadow. She gave him seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood.\n\nMaria Anna died in Graz aged 41, three years before the coronation of her husband as King of Bohemia, King of Hungary and King of Croatia andhis elevation to Holy Roman Emperor, so she was never a Holy Roman Empress. She was buried in the Mausoleum near the Cathedral, Graz.\n\nThe Ottomans captured Nagykanizsa in Hungary in 1600, which enabled them to invade Styria. A year later, Ferdinand tried to recapture the fortress, but the action ended in November 1601 with a defeat, due to unprofessional command of his troops.\n\nDuring the first stage of the family feud known as the Brothers’ Quarrel, Ferdinand initially supported Rudolph II’s brother, Matthias, who wanted to convince the melancholic Emperor to abdicate, but Matthias’ concessions to the Protestants in Hungary, Austria, and Bohemia outraged Ferdinand. He planned an alliance to strengthen the position of the Catholic Church in the Holy Roman Empire, but the Catholic princes established the Catholic League without his participation in 1610.\n\nKing Felipe III of Spain, who was the childless Matthias’ nephew, acknowledged Ferdinand’s right to succeed Matthias in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in exchange for territorial concessions in 1617. Spain also supported Ferdinand against the Republic of Venice during the Uskok War in 1617–18.\n\nThe Diets of Bohemia and Hungary confirmed Ferdinand’s position as Matthias’ successor only after he had promised to respect the Estates’ privileges in both realms. The different interpretation of the Letter of Majesty, which summarized the Bohemian Protestants’ liberties, gave rise to an uprising, known as the Second Defenestration of Prague on May 23, 1618. The Bohemian rebels established a provisional government, invaded Upper Austria, and sought assistance from the Habsburgs’ opponents.\n\nEmperor Matthias II died on March 20, 1619. Archduke Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor on August 28, 1619 (Frankfurt), two days before the Protestant Bohemian Estates deposed him Ferdinand as King of Bohemia. News of his deposition arrived in Frankfurt on the 28th but Ferdinand didn’t leave town until he had been crowned. Bohemia offered their crown (King of Bohemia) to the Calvinist Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate on August 26, 1619.\n\nPrince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate accepted the offer and was crowned on November 4, 1619, as King Friedrich I of Bohemia. The estates chose Prince-Elector Friedrich because he was the leader of the Protestant Union, a military alliance founded by his father, and hoped for the support of his father-in-law, King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nHowever, King James opposed his son-in-law’s takeover of Bohemia from the Habsburgs and Friedrich’s allies in the Protestant Union failed to support him militarily by signing the Treaty of Ulm. His brief reign as king of Bohemia ended with his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620 – a year and four days after his coronation.\n\nThe Thirty Years’ War began in 1618 as a result of inadequacies of Emperor Ferdinand II’s predecessors Rudolph II and Matthias. But Ferdinand’s acts against Protestantism caused the war to engulf the whole empire. As a zealous Catholic, Ferdinand wanted to restore the Catholic Church as the only religion in the Empire and to wipe out any form of religious dissent. The war left the Holy Roman Empire devastated and its population did not recover until 1710.\n\nThe 51-year-old Emperor Ferdinand II met his second wife, the 23-year-old Eleonora Gonzaga, in Innsbruck on February 1, 1622. She was crowned as Queen of Hungary and Croatia in Sopron where the first Italian opera was performed in the Habsburgs’ realms during the festivities that followed the coronation.\n\nEmperor Ferdinand II decided to unite the Habsburgs’ hereditary lands—Inner Austria, Upper and Lower Austria and Tyrol—into a new kingdom. He informed his brothers, Archduke Leopold and Archduke Charles, about his plan in a letter on April 29, 1623, but they rejected it. Archduke Leopold wanted to establish his own principality. He renounced the bishoprics of Passau and Strasbourg in favor of Ferdinand’s younger son, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, and retained Further Austria and Tyrol (that he had administered since 1619).\n\nEmperor Ferdinand II died in 1637, leaving to his son Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, an empire still engulfed in a war and whose fortunes seemed to be increasingly chaotic. Ferdinand II was buried in his Mausoleum in Graz. His heart was interred in the Herzgruft (heart crypt) of the Augustinian Church, Vienna.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I meant to publish this yesterday. I am back from my short hiatus, I was having problems with my tablet.\n\nMaximilian II (July 31, 1527 – October 12 ,1576) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1564 until his death in 1576. A member of the Austrian House of Habsburg, he was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague on May 14, 1562 and elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) on November 24, 1562. On September 8, 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia in the Hungarian capital Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian; now Bratislava, Slovakia). On July 25, 1564 he succeeded his father Emperor Ferdinand I as ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBiography\n\nMaximilian was born in Vienna, Austria, the eldest son of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand I, younger brother of Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Princess Anne of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547). She was the oldest child and only daughter of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1456–1516) and his third wife Anne of Foix-Candale.\n\nKing Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia was her younger brother. Her paternal grandparents were King Casimir IV of Poland (of the Jagiellon dynasty) and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, one of the heiresses of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Elisabeth was the daughter of Albert II of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nArchduke Maximilian was named after his great-grandfather, Emperor Maximilian I. At the time of his birth, his father Ferdinand succeeded his brother-in-law King Louis II of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia in the Kingdom of Bohemia and Croatia and the Kingdom of Hungary, laying the grounds for the global Habsburg monarchy.\n\nHeir apparent\n\nOn September 13, 1548 Emperor Charles V married Archduke Maximilian to Charles’s daughter (Maximilian’s cousin) Infanta Maria of Spain in the Castile residence of Valladolid. By the marriage his uncle intended to strengthen the ties with the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, but also to consolidate his nephew’s Catholic faith. Archduke Maximilian temporarily acted as the Emperor’s representative in Spain, however not as stadtholder of the Habsburg Netherlands as he had hoped for.\n\nTo his indignation, King Ferdinand of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia appointed Archduke Maximilian’s younger brother, Archduke Ferdinand II of Further Austria, administrator in the Kingdom of Bohemia, nevertheless Maximilian’s right of succession as the future king was recognised in 1549. He returned to Germany in December 1550 in order to take part in the discussion over the Imperial succession.\n\nArchduke Maximilian’s relations with his uncle worsened, as Emperor Charles V, again embattled by rebellious Protestant princes led by Elector Maurice of Saxony, wished his son King Felipe II of Spain to succeed him as emperor. However, Charles’ brother King Ferdinand, who had already been designated as the next occupant of the imperial throne, and his son Archduke Maximilian objected to this proposal.\n\nArchduke Maximilian sought the support of the German princes such as Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria and even contacted Protestant leaders like Maurice of Saxony and Duke Christoph of Württemberg. At length a compromise was reached: King Felipe II was to succeed Ferdinand, but during the former’s reign Maximilian, as King of the Romans, was to govern Germany. This arrangement was not carried out, and is only important because the insistence of the emperor seriously disturbed the harmonious relations that had hitherto existed between the two branches of the Habsburg family; an illness that befell Maximilian in 1552 was attributed to poison given to him in the interests of his cousin and brother-in-law, King Felipe II of Spain.\n\nThe relationship between the two cousins was uneasy. While Felipe had been raised a Spaniard and barely travelled out of the kingdom during his life, Maximilian identified himself as the quintessential German prince and often displayed a strong dislike of Spaniards, whom he considered as intolerant and arrogant. While his cousin was reserved and shy, Maximilian was outgoing and charismatic.\n\nHis adherence to humanism and religious tolerance put him at odds with Felipe who was more committed to the defence of the Catholic faith. Also, he was considered a promising commander, while Felipe disliked war and only once personally commanded an army. Nonetheless, the two remained committed to the unity of their dynasty.\n\nThe religious views of Archduke Maximilian had always been somewhat uncertain, and he had probably learned something of Lutheranism in his youth; but his amicable relations with several Protestant princes, which began about the time of the discussion over the succession, were probably due more to political than to religious considerations. However, in Vienna he became very intimate with Sebastian Pfauser [de], a court preacher influenced by Heinrich Bullinger with strong leanings towards Lutheranism, and his religious attitude caused some uneasiness to his father.\n\nFears were freely expressed that he would definitely leave the Catholic Church, and when his father Ferdinand became emperor in 1558 he was prepared to assure Pope Paul IV that his son should not succeed him if he took this step. Eventually Maximilian remained nominally an adherent of the older faith, although his views were tinged with Lutheranism until the end of his life. After several refusals he consented in 1560 to the banishment of Pfauser, and began again to attend the Masses of the Catholic Church.\n\nReign\n\nIn November 1562 Maximilian was chosen King of the Romans, or German king, by the electoral college at Frankfurt, where he was crowned a few days later, after assuring the Catholic electors of his fidelity to their faith, and promising the Protestant electors that he would publicly accept the confession of Augsburg when he became emperor. He also took the usual oath to protect the Church, and his election was afterwards confirmed by the papacy. He was the first King of the Romans not to be crowned in Aachen. In September 1563 he was crowned King of Hungary by the Archbishop of Esztergom, Nicolaus Olahus, and on his father’s death, in July 1564, he succeeded to the empire and to the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia.\n\nMaximilian’s rule was shaped by the confessionalization process after the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Though a Habsburg and a Catholic, he approached the Lutheran Imperial estates with a view to overcome the denominational schism, which ultimately failed. He also was faced with the ongoing Ottoman–Habsburg wars and rising conflicts with his Habsburg Spain cousins.\n\nAccording to Fichtner, Maximilian failed to achieve his three major aims: rationalizing the government structure, unifying Christianity, and evicting the Turks from Hungary. Peter Marshall opines that it is wrong to dismiss Maximilian as a failure. According to Marshall, through his religious tolerance as well as encouragement of arts and sciences, he succeeded in maintaining a precarious peace.\n\nEmperor Maximilian II died on October 12, 1576 in Regensburg while preparing to invade Poland. On his deathbed he refused to receive the last sacraments of the Church. He is buried in St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.\n\nBy his wife Maria he had a family of ten sons and six daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Rudolf, who had been chosen king of the Romans in October 1575. Another of his sons, Matthias, also became emperor; three others, Ernest, Albrecht and Maximilian, took some part in the government of the Habsburg territories or of the Netherlands. His eldest daughter, Anna, married King Felipe II of Spain. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married King Charles IX of France.\n\nArchduchess Maria of Austria (June 21, 1528 – February 28, 1603) was the Empress Consort and Queen Consort of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. She served as regent of Spain in the absence of her father Emperor Charles V from 1548 until 1551 and was one of the most powerful empresses of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAs a member of the House of Habsburg Maria was both an Infanta of Spain and an Archduchess of Austria. For this blog post I will call her Archduchess Maria.\n\nEarly life\n\nArchduchess Maria of Austria was born June 21, 1528 in Madrid, Spain to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain as King Carlos I and his first cousin Infanta Isabella of Portugal who was the second child and first daughter of King Manuel I of Portugal and his second wife, Infanta Maria of Aragon, the third surviving daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Fernando II of Aragon (the Catholic monarchs).\n\nShe grew up mostly between Toledo and Valladolid with her siblings, Infante Felipe and Infanta Joanna. They built a strong family bond despite their father’s regular absences. Maria and her brother, Felipe, shared similar strong personal views and policies which they retained during the rest of their lives.\n\nAs Regent of Spain\n\nOn September 15, 1548, aged twenty, she married her first cousin Archduke Maximilian of Austria, the eldest son of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand, (younger brother of Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) and the Jagiellonian princess Anne of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547). He was named after his great-grandfather, Emperor Maximilian I. At the time of his birth, his father Ferdinand succeeded his brother-in-law King Louis II of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia laying the grounds for the global Habsburg monarchy.\n\nKing Louis II of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia was married to Archduchess Mary of Austria the daughter the daughter of Queen Joanna and King Felipe I of Castile, Duke of Burgundy and Archduke of Austria. Archduke Ferdinand and Emperor Charles V were her siblings.\n\nThe couple had sixteen children during the course of a twenty-eight-year marriage.\n\nWhile her father was occupied with German affairs, Maria and Maximilian acted as regents of Spain from 1548 to 1551 during the absence of Prince Felipe. Maria stayed at the Spanish cour until August 1551, and in 1552, the couple moved to live at the court of Maximilian’s father in Vienna.\n\nIn 1558, Maria returned to Madrid and acted as regent of Spain during the absence of her brother, now King Felipe II, from 1558 to 1561.\n\nwith a series of abdications in 1556 that divided his hereditary and imperial domains between the Spanish Habsburgs, headed by his son Philip II of Spain, and the Austrian Habsburgs, headed by his brother Ferdinand. Ferdinand had been Archduke of Austria in Charles’s name since 1521 and the designated successor as emperor since 1531.\n\nThe Duchy of Milan and the Habsburg Netherlands were also left in personal union to the King of Spain, although initially also belonging to the Holy Roman Empire. The two Habsburg dynasties remained allied until the extinction of the Spanish line in 1700. In 1557, Charles retired to the Monastery of Yuste in Extremadura and died there a year later.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand succeeded Charles as Holy Roman Emperor. This course of events had been guaranteed already back on January 5, 1531 when Ferdinand had been elected the King of the Romans and so the legitimate successor of the reigning Emperor.\n\nPope Paul IV refused to recognize Ferdinand as Emperor until 1559, when peace was reached between France and the Habsburgs. During his Emperorship, the Council of Trent came to an end. Emperor Ferdinand organized an Imperial election in 1562 in order to secure the succession of his son Archduke Maximilian.\n\nAs Holy Roman Empress\n\nAfter her return to the Holy Roman Empire her husband eventually succeeded his father Emperor Ferdinand I, at his death, as Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia which he ruled from 1564 to his death in 1576.\n\nMaria was a devout Catholic and frequently disagreed with her religiously ambiguous husband about his religious tolerance.\n\nDuring her life in Austria, Maria was reportedly ill at ease in a country which was not entirely Catholic, and she surrounded herself with a circle of strictly Catholic courtiers, many of whom she had brought with her from Spain. Her court was organized by her Spanish chief lady-in-waiting Maria de Requenes in a Spanish manner, and among her favorite companions was her Spanish lady-in-waiting Margarita de Cardona.\n\nAs Holy Roman Empress Dowager\n\nIn 1576, Emperor Maximilian II died. Maria remained at the Imperial Court for six years after his death. She had great influence over her sons, the future emperors Rudolph II and Matthias.\n\nMaria returned to Spain in 1582, taking her youngest surviving child Archduchess Margaret with her, promised to marry Felipe II of Spain, who had lost his fourth wife, her oldest daughter, Archduchess Anna in 1580.\n\nMargaret finally refused to marry King Felipe II and took the veil as a Poor Clare. Commenting that she was very happy to live in “a country without heretics”, Maria then influenced quite a number of events in the Spanish Court until she eventually settled in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid, where she lived until her death in February 28, 1603.\n\nShe was the patron of the noted Spanish composer Tomás Luis de Victoria, and the great Requiem Mass he wrote in 1603 for her funeral is considered among the best and most refined of his works. Maria exerted some influence together with Queen Margaret, the wife of her grandson/nephew, King Felipe III of Spain.\n\nLeopold I (June 9, 1640 – May 5, 1705) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia. The second son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and of Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I. Her elder brother was the Archduke Ferdinand, who succeeded as Emperor in 1619. Two of her sisters, Anna and Constance, through their subsequent marriages to King Sigismund III Vasa, became Queens of Poland.\n\nInfanta Maria Anna of Spain was the Spanish Princess that King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland first desired to marry.\n\nBorn on June 9, 1640 in Vienna, Leopold received the traditional program of education in the liberal arts, history, literature, natural science and astronomy. He was particularly interested in music, as his father emperor Ferdinand III had been. From an early age Leopold showed an inclination toward learning. He became fluent in Latin, Italian, German, French, and Spanish. In addition to German, Italian would be the most favored language at his court.\n\nLikewise he had received comprehensive ecclesiastical training as he had originally been selected for a career in the higher clergy. This plan, though, was dropped when Leopold became heir apparent upon the 1654 death of his older brother, Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans and the reigning King of Bohemia (1646), King of Hungary and Croatia (1647).\n\nNonetheless, Leopold’s spiritual education had had a manifest impact on him. Leopold remained under the spell of his clerical education and Jesuit influence throughout his life. For a monarch he was uncommonly knowledgeable about theology, metaphysics, jurisprudence and the sciences.\n\nLeopold was said to have typical Habsburg physical attributes, such as the prominent Habsburg lower jaw. Short, thin, and of sick constitution, Leopold was cold and reserved in public and socially inept. However, he is also said to have been open with close associates\n\nHis father, Emperor Ferdinand III, died on April 2, 1657 and rests in the Capuchin Crypt in Vienna. His interior organs were separately buried in the Ducal Crypt.\n\nOn July 18, 1658, more than a year after his father’s death, Leopold was elected Holy Roman Emperor at Frankfurt in opposition to the French Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to place the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected Emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France.\n\nThis marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year reign characterized by a lasting rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter’s dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, even to this day, but Leopold was no less a warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and furtherance of wars.\n\nEmperor Leopold I ruled the Holy Roman Empire until his death in 1705, becoming the second longest-ruling Habsburg emperor (46 years and 9 months). He was both a composer and considerable patron of music.\n\nLeopold’s reign is known for conflicts with the Ottoman Empire in the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and rivalry with Louis XIV, a contemporary and first cousin (on the maternal side; fourth cousin on the paternal side), in the west. After more than a decade of warfare, Leopold emerged victorious in the east thanks to the military talents of Prince Eugene of Savoy. By the Treaty of Karlowitz, Leopold recovered almost all of the Kingdom of Hungary, which had fallen under Turkish power in the years after the 1526 Battle of Mohács.\n\nLeopold fought three wars against France: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years’ War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold sought to give his younger son Charles the entire Spanish inheritance, disregarding the will of the late Carlos II of Spain. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on until 1714, nine years after Leopold’s death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned with the Treaty of Rastatt, Austria could not be said to have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.\n\nIn 1666, he married Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain (1651–1673) the first child of King Felipe IV of Spain born from his second marriage with his niece Infanta Mariana of Austria. Because of this avunculate marriage, Margaret’s mother was nearly thirty years younger than her father.\n\nMargaret’s paternal grandparents were King Felipe III of Spain and his wife Archduchess Margaret of Austria. Her maternal grandparents were Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the daughter of her paternal grandparents.\n\nDespite the close consanguinity of her parents, Margaret did not develop the serious health issues and disabilities that her younger brother had shown since his birth.\n\nHis second wife was Claudia Felicitas of Austria, the first child and eldest daughter of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria and Count of Tyrol, by his wife and first-cousin Anna de’ Medici. On her father’s side, her grandparents were Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria and his wife Claudia de’ Medici (after which she received her first name); on her mother’s side, her grandparents were Cosimo II de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria, the youngest daughter of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria, and his wife Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nHis third wife was Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. She was the oldest of 17 children born from Philip William, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Duke of Jülich-Berg and his second wife, Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. On her father’s side her grandparents were Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and his first wife, Magdalene of Bavaria. On her mother’s side, her grandparents were George II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Sophia Eleonore of Saxony.\n\nArchduke Joseph of Austria was the eldest son of Emperor Leopold I from his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg. Joseph was crowned King of Hungary at the age of nine in 1687 and was elected King of the Romans at the age of eleven in 1690. He succeeded to the thrones of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia and the Holy Roman Empire when his father Emperor Leopold I died on May 5, 1705.\n\nEmperor Joseph continued the War of the Spanish Succession, begun by his father against Louis XIV of France, in an attempt to make his younger brother Archduke Charles (later Emperor Charles VI) King of Spain.\n\nAlbrecht V-II the Magnanimous, Duke of Austria and elected King of the Romans as Albrecht II (August 10, 1397 – October 27, 1439) was king of the Holy Roman Empire and a member of the House of Habsburg. By inheritance he became Albrecht V, Duke of Austria. Through his wife (jure uxoris) he also became King of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, and inherited a claim to the Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nAlbert was born in Vienna as the son of Albert IV, Duke of Austria, and Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht I, Duke of Bavaria and his first wife Margaret of Brieg.\n\nHe succeeded to the Duchy of Austria at the age of seven on his father’s death in 1404. His uncle Duke Wilhelm of Inner Austria, then head of the rivaling Leopoldinian line, served as regent for his nephew, followed by his brothers Leopold IV and Ernst the Iron in 1406.\n\nThe quarrels between the brothers and their continued attempts to gain control over the Albertinian territories led to civil war-like conditions. Nevertheless, Albrecht having received a good education, undertook the government of Austria proper on the occasion of Leopold’s death in 1411 and succeeded, with the aid of his advisers, in ridding the duchy of the evils which had arisen during his minority.\n\nExpulsion of the Jews\n\nThough the Jews in the Austrian duchy had been subject to local persecutions during the 13th and 14th century, their position remained relatively safe. Jewish communities prospered in several towns like Krems or the area around the Judenplatz at Vienna. During the confusion after the death of Duke Albrecht IV in 1404 their situation worsened sharply, culminating in the blaze of the Vienna synagogue on November 5, 1406, followed by riots and lootings.\n\nWhen Albrecht V came of age in 1411 and interfered in the Hussite Wars, he repeatedly established new taxes imposed on the Jewish community to finance his campaigns. On the other hand, after the Hussites had devastated the duchy, the Austrian Jews were accused of collaboration and arms trade in favour of the enemies. The accusations of a host desecration at Enns in 1420 gave Albert pretext for the destruction of the Jewish community.\n\nAccording to the 1463 Chronica Austriae by chronicler Thomas Ebendorfer, the duke on May 23, 1420, at the behest of the Church, ordered the imprisonment and forcible conversion of the Jews. Those that had not converted or escaped were sent off in boats down the Danube, while wealthy Jews remained under arrest, several of them tortured and stripped of their property.\n\nThe forced baptism of Jewish children was stopped on intervention by Pope Martin V. On March 12, 1421 Albert sentenced the remaining Jews to death. Ninety-two men and 120 women were burned at the stake south of the Vienna city walls on March 12, 1421. The Jews were placed under an “eternal ban” and their synagogue was demolished. The persecutions in several Austrian towns are explicitly described in a 16th-century script called Vienna Gesera.\n\nIn 1422 Albert married Elisabeth of Luxemburg, the daughter and heiress of the King Sigismund of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia), and his second wife, the Slovenian noblewoman Barbara of Celje. Besides Hungary, Albrecht’s marriage brought him claims to several Slavic kingdoms and principalities as well.\n\nAlbrecht assisted his father-in-law Sigismund in his campaigns against the Hussites, involving the Austrian duchy in the Hussite Wars. In return Sigismund designated him as his successor and granted him the title of a Margrave of Moravia in 1423. The Austrian lands were devastated several times and Albert also participated in the 1431 Battle of Domažlice where the Imperial troops suffered an embarrassing defeat.\n\nWhen Sigismund died in 1437, Albrecht was crowned King of Hungary on January 1, 1438, and just as his predecessor did, he moved his court to the Hungarian Kingdom from where he later oversaw his other domains. Although crowned king of Bohemia six months after ascending to the Hungarian throne, he was unable to obtain possession of the country. He was engaged in warfare with the Bohemians and their Polish allies, when on March 18, 1438, he was elected “King of the Romans” at Frankfurt, an honour which he does not appear to have sought. He was never crowned as Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nAfter being engaged in defending Hungary against the attacks of the Turks, he died on October 27, 1439 at Neszmély and was buried at Székesfehérvár. Albrecht was an energetic and warlike prince, whose short reign as a triple king gave great promise of usefulness for the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire occurred de facto on August 6, 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor, Franz II of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, abdicated his title and released all imperial states and officials from their oaths and obligations to the empire.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the Holy Roman Empire had been recognized by Western Europeans as the legitimate continuation of the ancient Roman Empire due to its emperors having been proclaimed as Roman emperors by the papacy. Through this Roman legacy, the Holy Roman Emperors claimed to be universal monarchs whose jurisdiction extended beyond their empire’s formal borders to all of Christian Europe and beyond.\n\nThe decline of the Holy Roman Empire was a long and drawn-out process lasting centuries. The formation of the first modern sovereign territorial states in the 16th and 17th centuries, which brought with it the idea that jurisdiction corresponded to actual territory governed, threatened the universal nature of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire by the time of the 18th century was widely regarded by contemporaries, both inside and outside the empire, as a highly “irregular” monarchy and “sick”, having an “unusual” form of government. The empire lacked both a central standing army and a central treasury and its monarchs, formally elective rather than hereditary, could not exercise effective central control.\n\nEven then, most contemporaries believed that the empire could be revived and modernized. The Holy Roman Empire finally began its true terminal decline after the Peace of Westphalia and the rise of Brandenburg-Prussia which saw a rivalry between Austria and Prussia that lasted more than a century.\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that begining with the rivalry between Austria and Prussia one doesn’t read much in the history books about the Holy Roman Empire itself and the focus is on Austria and Prussia as individual states.\n\nThe Empire’s decline was sped up during and after its involvement in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Again one is more likely to read about Austria’s involvement in the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars further demonstrating how fragmented the Empire was at this time.\n\nAlthough the empire defended itself quite well initially, war with France and Napoleon proved catastrophic. In 1804, Napoleon proclaimed himself as the Emperor of the French, which Franz II responded to by proclaiming himself the Emperor of Austria, in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor, an attempt at maintaining parity between France and Austria while also illustrating that the Holy Roman title outranked them both.\n\nAustria’s defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805 and the secession of a large number of Franz II’s German vassals in July 1806 to form the Confederation of the Rhine, a French satellite state, effectively meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe abdication in August 1806, combined with a dissolution of the entire imperial hierarchy and its institutions, was seen as necessary to prevent the possibility of Napoleon proclaiming himself as Holy Roman Emperor, something which would have reduced Franz II to being Napoleon’s vassal.\n\nReactions to the empire’s dissolution ranged from indifference to despair. The populace of Vienna, capital of the Habsburg monarchy, were horrified at the loss of the empire. Many of Franz II’s former subjects questioned the legality of his actions; though his abdication was agreed to be perfectly legal, the dissolution of the empire and the release of all its vassals were seen as beyond the emperor’s authority.\n\nAs such, many of the empire’s princes and subjects refused to accept that the empire was gone, with some commoners going so far as to believe that news of its dissolution was a plot by their local authorities. In Germany, the dissolution was widely compared to the ancient and semi-legendary Fall of Troy and some associated the end of what they perceived to be the Roman Empire with the end times and the apocalypse.\n\nJoseph I (Joseph Jacob Ignaz Johann Anton Eustachius; July 26, 1678 – April 17, 1711) was Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy from 1705 until his death in 1711.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Emperor Leopold I from his third wife, Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg, she was the oldest of 17 children born from Philipp Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and Duke of Jülich-Berg of the House of Wittelsbach and his second wife, Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nOn Eleonor Magdalene of Neuburg’s father’s side her grandparents were Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg and his first wife, Magdalene of Bavaria. On her mother’s side, her grandparents were Georg II, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Sophia Eleonore of Saxony.\n\nBorn in Vienna, Joseph was educated strictly by Charles Theodore, Prince of Salm and became a good linguist. Although he was the first son and child born of his parents’ marriage, he was his father’s third son and seventh child.\n\nPreviously, Leopold had been married to Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain, the first child of King Felipe IV of Spain born from his second marriage with his niece Archduchess Mariana of Austria, second child of Infanta Maria Anna of Spain and her husband Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand. Infanta Margaret Theresa gave him four children, one of whom survived infancy.\n\nLeopold then married his Habsburg cousin Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Austria. She was the eldest daughter of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria and Count of Tyrol, by his wife and first-cousin Anna de’ Medici.\n\nOn her father’s side, her grandparents were Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria and his wife Claudia de’ Medici (after which she received her first name); on her mother’s side, her grandparents were Cosimo II de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria.\n\nArchduchess Claudia Felicitas gave him two short-lived daughters. Thus, Joseph had six half-siblings.\n\nAt the age of nine, on December 9, 1687, he was crowned King of Hungary; and at the age of eleven, on January 23, 1690, King of the Romans. Although he never formally ceased to be a Roman Catholic, Joseph (unlike his parents and most of his other relatives) was not particularly devout by nature. He had two great enthusiasms: music and hunting.\n\nEarly on, Joseph’s mother, the Holy Roman Empress Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg, decided that Wilhelmine Amalie would be her daughter-in-law. Prince Salm was instrumental in speaking for her candidacy.\n\nPrincess Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg (April 21, 1673 – April 10, 1742) was the youngest daughter of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Calenberg, and Princess Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate.\n\nThe adviser of Eleonore, Marco d’Aviano, had convinced her that Wilhelmine Amalie, being pious and older than Joseph, could act as a tempering influence and discontinue his sex life outside of marriage, and to Emperor Leopold, he claimed that he had a vision that the pair would be happy. She was subjected to medical examination, which establish that she was fertile.\n\nMarriage\n\nAs a result, on February 24, 1699, she married Archduke Joseph, the heir of Emperor Leopold I. At their wedding, the opera Hercule and Hebe by Reinhard Keiser (1674–1739) was performed.\n\nAs Archduke Joseph and Archduchess Wilhelmine Amalie had three children and their only son died of hydrocephalus before his first birthday.\n\nJoseph had a passion for love affairs (none of which resulted in illegitimate children) and he caught a sexually transmittable disease, probably syphilis, which he passed on to his wife while they were trying to produce a new heir. This incident rendered her sterile.\n\nEmperor Leopold I was still alive during these events, made Joseph and his brother Archduke Charles sign the Mutual Pact of Succession, ensuring that Joseph’s daughters would have absolute precedence over Charles’s daughters, neither of whom were born at the time, and that Joseph’s eldest daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, would inherit both the Austrian and Spanish realms. From 1711 to 1717, she was heir presumptive to the Habsburg Empire.\n\nJoseph succeeded to the thrones of Bohemia, Croatia the Holy Roman Empire when his father Emperor Leopold I died on May 5, 1705.\n\nJoseph had surrounded himself with reform-hungry advisors and the young court of Vienna was ambitious in the elaboration of innovative plans. He was described as a “forward-looking ruler”.\n\nThe large number of privy councillors was reduced and attempts were made to make the bureaucracy more efficient. Measures were taken to modernize the central bodies and a certain success was achieved in stabilizing the chronic Habsburg finances.\n\nJoseph also endeavoured to strengthen his position in the Holy Roman Empire – as a means of strengthening Austria’s standing as a great power. When he sought to lay claim to imperial rights in Italy and gain territories for the Habsburgs, he even risked a military conflict with the Pope over the duchy of Mantua. Joseph I was threatened with excommunication by Pope Clement XI on June 16, 1708.\n\nEmperor Joseph continued the War of the Spanish Succession, begun by his father against Louis XIV of France, in a fruitless attempt to make his younger brother Archduke Charles (later Emperor Charles VI) King of Spain.\n\nIn the process, however, owing to the victories won by his military commander, Prince Eugene of Savoy, he did succeed in establishing Austrian hegemony over Italy. Joseph also had to contend with a protracted revolt in Hungary, fomented by Louis XIV. Neither conflict was resolved until the Treaty of Utrecht, after his death.\n\nDuring the smallpox epidemic of 1711, which killed Louis, le Grand Dauphin and three siblings of the future Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, Joseph became infected. He died on April 17 in the Hofburg Palace. He had previously promised his wife to stop having affairs, should he survive.\n\nThe Emperor was buried in the Imperial Crypt, resting place of the majority of the Habsburgs. His funeral took place on April 20, in tomb no. 35 in Karl’s Vault. His tomb was designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, decorated with pictures of various battles from the War of Spanish Succession. Josefstadt (the eighth district of Vienna) is named for Joseph.\n\nEmperor Joseph was succeeded as Emperor by his brother Archduke Charles. As Emperor Charles VI he was the last male Habsburg heir in the direct line.\n\nSince Habsburg possessions were subject to the Salic law, barring women from inheriting in their own right, his own lack of a male heir meant the hereditary Habsburg lands would be divided on his death.\n\nThe Pragmatic Sanction of April 19, 1713 abolished male-only succession in all Habsburg realms and declared their lands indivisible, and allowed female succession, although only Hungary approved it in 1723.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was technically elective and still subject to the Salic Law and not subject to the Pragmatic Sanction.\n\nEmperor Joseph’s eldest daughter Archduchess Maria Josepha was the Queen of Poland and Electress of Saxony by marriage to Elector Augustus III of Saxony and King of Poland.\n\nHer sister Archduchess Maria Amalia became the wife of Charles Albert of Bavaria was born in Brussels and the son of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, daughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland.\n\nElector Charles Albert of Bavaria was a member of the House of Wittelsbach. After the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740, he claimed the Archduchy of Austria by his marriage to Archduchess Maria Amalia.\n\nCharles Albert was briefly, from 1741 to 1743, as Charles III King of Bohemia and Croatia. In 1742, he was elected Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire as Charles VII and ruled until his death three years later.\n\nHis election as Holy Roman Emperor thus marked the end of three centuries of uninterrupted Habsburg imperial rule although he was related to the Habsburgs by both blood and, as we have seen, by marriage to Archduchess Maria Amalia, the youngest daughter of Emperor Joseph I."
