        "text": "Swietoslava: Slavic Viking Princess\n\nI was recently delving into historical interactions between the Vikings and Slavs, and came across an interesting yet largely overlooked character, named Swietoslava. Before I begin telling her story, I would like to apologise in advance for any spelling errors (I’m not Slavic myself, and there are various different spellings within my sources!) and any mistakes made with regards to the tale itself; there is a fair amount of conflicting information, so I’ll do my best!\n\nBorn around 970 AD in Poznan (Poland), Swietoslava Piast Mieszkówna was the daughter of Mieszko I, Duke of Poland, and his wife Doubravka of Bohemia (an ancient kingdom which was once located in what is now known as Czech Republic).\n\nLittle is known about Swietoslava’s early years, but during adulthood she was actually quite famous, for both her relationships and her fiery temperament!\n\nSlavic and Scandinavian relations had been very friendly for at least a few decades prior to the Princess’ birth, with some historians believing that her father’s lineage may have featured some Norse blood (although of course this is practically impossible to prove). Some German historians also came up with a theory: that Mieszko’s name – meaning ‘bear’ in Polish – may be linked to the Scandinavian name Björn, which has the same meaning. I’m not entirely sure how legitimate that theory is, though!\n\nSome definitive proof of Norse-Slav interaction exists, within a document called The Dagome Index – the first known document relating to the country of Poland. ‘Dagome’ is a Scandinavian name, used within the document to address Mieszko I.\n\nBut anyway, back to the main story…\n\nIn 980, Swietoslava married King Erik VI of Sweden, and bore his son Olav Skotkunung (who later followed in his father’s footsteps by also becoming a King of Sweden). Sadly, Swietoslava was widowed shortly afterwards.\n\nIn around 994, she remarried – this time to the infamous Viking, King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. She also appears to have changed her name temporarily to ‘Gunhilda’ for the purpose of this marriage, although it’s not clear why. During her time with Sweyn, she gave birth to five children, including Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark.\n\nUnfortunately, for reasons unknown (her restless, explosive temperament perhaps?) Swietoslava became unhappy in her marriage to Sweyn. She returned to Poland, which was now under the rule of her brother Boleslav the Brave – the first official Polish monarch. What Swietoslava got up to during her time back in her homeland is unknown, but after her estranged husband’s death, her sons Canute and Harold travelled there to retrieve her.\n\nCanute later went on to become King of England, Denmark and Norway, as well as governor of Schleswig and Pomerania; Harold also became a ruler of Denmark.\n\nSwietoslava was said to have inherited her ‘difficult character’ from her paternal aunt, Adelajda (mother of St Stephen the Great – the first King of Hungary). Adelajda was known as a beauty who drank excessively, and loved to ride horses astride like a man. She was even rumoured to have murdered a man during one of her apparently frequent rages! So, one can imagine the sort of character her niece Swietoslava possessed!\n\nSwietoslava must have been somewhat renowned, as she actually features in the Icelandic Sagas!\n\nBefore I recount the story described in ‘Heimskringla’ (one of the Sagas, written by Snorri Sturluson) it is important to point out the following:\n\n1. The Sagas were written centuries after the events described took place, so there are bound to be some inaccuracies.\n\n2. Swietoslava was only identified as the real ‘Sigrid the Haughty’ due to correlations between hers and ‘Sigrid”s story (for example, they both were married to King Erik VI and Sweyn Forkbeard, both had a child named Olav, and both stories feature the name ‘Gunhild’, etc.)\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nHeimskringla describes Sigrid as the beautiful but vengeful daughter of Skogul-Tosti, a powerful Swedish nobleman. As widow of Eric the Victorious, she held many great estates, and was living with her son Olav the Swede, when her foster-brother Harald Grenske, a king in Vestfold, sought her hand. She had him and another royal wooer, Vissavald of Gardarik, burned to death in a great hall following a feast to discourage other suitors. This episode earned her her byname.\n\nHer hand was next sought by Olaf Tryggvasson, the king of Norway, but he would have required that she convert to Christianity. She told him to his face, “I will not part from the faith which my forefathers have kept before me”. In a rage, Olaf struck her with a glove, and Sigrid calmly told him, “This may some day be thy death”. Sigrid then proceeded to create a coalition of his enemies to bring about his downfall. She allied Sweden with Denmark, marrying the widower Sweyn Forkbeard who had already been feuding with Olaf. Sweyn had sent his sister Tyri to marry the Wendish king Burislav, who had been the father of Sweyn’s first wife, Gunhild. Tyri fled and married Olaf, goading him into conflict with her brother, while Sigrid inflamed Sweyn against her former suitor. This shared animosity would lead to the Battle of Swold, in which Olaf fell. Snorri also claims that Estrid Svendsdatter was a paternal sister of Cnut the Great, and as a daughter of Sigrid was maternal sister to Olav the Swede, but in another place says that Estrid was a daughter of Gunhild of Wenden.\n\nThe Danish historian Saxo Grammaticuswould repeat this information, writing that Eric the Victorious’ widow Syritha had married Sweyn Forkbeard after having spurned Olaf Trygvasson.\n\nOne further point that has been cited in favor of Sigrid’s historical existence is that the holdings of the Danish kings in medieval Sweden were known as “Syghridslef” – ‘the legacy of Sigrid’.\n\n* Note: ‘Wendish’ = denoting someone who hailed from lands occupied by the Wends, people who historically populated Western Slavic lands. Boruslav was given the pan-Scandinavian title ‘King of the Wends’, meaning that he had sovereignty, lordship or claims over Wendish lands. Wends would have inhabitated areas of Poland, where Swietoslava was born. Boruslav sounds like he could have been Boleslav (her brother)! According to legend, there WAS a Polish princess called Gunhild of Wenden who was also wife of Sweyn Forkbeard. Apparently, Mieszko was a pagan until his wife Doubravka made him convert to Christianity so that they could marry (obviously this could tie in with the conversion part of the Saga)… Coincidence? I personally think not!\n\nDespite many obvious inaccuracies, there are plenty of details in Heimskringla which could easily be describing Swietoslava. I definitely believe that she was an inspiration for the character of ‘Sigrid the Haughty’! Although of course many people could have been mixed into this legend.\n\nIt seems that Swietoslava died in 1126 – making her extremely old compared to the average life expectancy of 40 at the time! She was married to her third husband, Vratislaus II of Bohemia (and thus the first Queen of Bohemia) until she was widowed in 1092.\n\nAlthough we know so little about the mysterious Slavic Viking Princess, her bloodline lives on in notable living descendants, including the British Royal Family! She sounds exactly like the kind of woman ‘Shieldmaiden’ legends stemmed from!\n\nAn artist’s impression of Swietoslava from the 1800s.\n\nBlood Isn’t Everything\n\nAfter being obsessed with tales of the Vikings since childhood, and fascinated by their religion (and it’s modern variants), it was rather shocking and disappointing for me to learn my true origins.\n\nI received the much anticipated results of my DNA test (done via MyHeritage) at the end of last year, which were:\n\n81% English\n\n16% Scandinavian\n\n1.8% Baltic\n\nI am aware that DNA companies can only interpret results based on DNA profiles already stored within their database, meaning that in a decade or so these results have the potential to change drastically and can vary from company to company, but still… This was very surprising! And honestly, I’m still not really sure how I feel about it.\n\nMost of my friends and family couldn’t care less about their ancestry or DNA. They tell me to stop living in the past, and concentrate on the present/future. But somehow, I cannot bring myself to do that… I hold a deep connection with my roots and ancestors, a deep yearning which I can’t ignore.\n\nI look wistfully towards the far North, and when I stand beside the sea, the damp and cold penetrating my very bones, my heart soars. When I walk through dense forests, I run my fingers over the gnarled bark of ancient trees, and I feel the pulse of the earth.\n\nI live my life in England, and whilst it is true that I love many things about this island, and a great many of my ancestors lived out their entire lives here, I still yearn for foreign shores.\n\nThrough my family tree research, I’ve learned a little about the lives of my foreign ancestors, and I was absolutely captivated by their stories. Although there’s hardly anything written on paper, from the few details I have gleaned, its given me a fairly good understanding of who they were and what they did.\n\nMy Norse ancestors are quite far back in my family tree (which perhaps accounts for such diluted DNA), and although I’m proud of and interested in all of those who went before me, these are the ones I am most drawn to.\n\nMy feelings are so powerful, and I can’t just switch them off. It is strange that I am so attached to these ancient people, by a metaphorical umbilical cord which spans generations and crosses stormy oceans.\n\nThis primal urge to get back to our roots… Did they feel it too, I wonder? Did any of my more recent Christian, thoroughly English ancestors feel the same as I do now? Ironic, really, as my Norse ancestors probably looked towards these very shores, turning their backs on their homeland in search of better opportunities!\n\nI’m sorry for rambling, and I’m sorry that this isn’t the first time I’ve talked about this subject. But I guess a part of me is wounded by the knowledge of what I really am. I intend to do another DNA test in a few years’ time, just out of curiosity, to see if there’s any change in the results. But if there isn’t, I’ll have to accept it.\n\nMy main point here is: BLOOD ISN’T EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter if you’re 1% Norse, or 100% Norse – if that part of the world attracts you, if the Norse gods call to you, and if you feel that deep stirring in your soul, then you are Heathen at heart! And no one can take that away from you!\n\nWhy This Blog Is Not Like The Others\n\nDuring my personal journey into Heathenry, I’ve encountered many so-called ‘Folkish’ Heathens.\n\nTrue Folkism is about being proud of your roots, protecting and promoting your culture and heritage, etc. It is not, however, an excuse to be openly racist!\n\nI’ve seen many people posting on social media praising the perpetrator of the recent New Zealand mosque shooting; this is particularly worrying as the culprit supposedly wrote in his 70-odd page manifesto ‘if I don’t make it, see you in Valhalla’. He also reportedly had pagan tattoos. I have no idea if this is true or not, but the fact that members of our community are condoning this TERRORIST is disgusting!\n\nYes, as I’ve written before, Islam (along with Christianity) have massacred millions in the name of their gods. And yes, Islam is (in my opinion) the biggest threat currently facing the Western world. However, just because the ideology is vile, doesn’t necessarily mean that all of those who follow it are! I’ve met plenty of good Muslims, and plenty of good Christians too. Not all of them despise Western culture, and not all of them want to see us dead.\n\nI will never agree with the Abrahamic agenda, but I will also never condone anyone slaughtering a bunch of unarmed people in a place of worship… That despicable human being, and others like him, will never grace the halls of Valhalla. More likely, Nidhogg will chew him up, and grind his bones to dust! There is no honour in cowardice, and cowardice is exactly what it was – nothing more and nothing less. It wasn’t self defence, those individual victims were not guilty, and at that moment they posed no threat to him. Sadly, they lost their lives thanks to a rampaging terrorist.\n\nThere are an unbelievable amount of Heathen blogs, pages and groups out there, and many of them are hideously racist. I personally don’t care what colour someone is, where they come from, or what religion they practice… If they are a decent human being, I will give them the benefit of the doubt. And even if they do turn out to be an arsehole, I’m not going to go on a murder spree!\n\nI’d like to think that humanity has evolved past killing over religion… It’s 2019, after all! Alas, I’m very wrong. This primitive bullshit should be condemned by all, particularly the pagan community, who already have enough crap going on thanks to white supremacists and wannabe Nazis who spew their bile whilst claiming to be one of us.\n\nTwo wrongs do not make a right… Revenge should be aimed at the perpetrators, not innocents! How would you feel if someone wanted to kill you, just because you were Heathen, even though you personally didn’t do anything wrong?\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, but I just wanted to give my views on this. I’m proud of my race, culture and heritage, but I do not feel that it makes me superior to anyone else. And I would never dishonour my gods or ancestors by pulling the same type of horrific stunt that occurred in New Zealand.\n\nIf you disagree with me, you may as well unfollow me right now… I want nothing to do with people like that.\n\nWho Were The Rus?\n\nHave you ever wondered who the people known as the Rus were? Read on for some fascinating facts…\n\nThe Rus were ancestrally and ethnically Scandinavian people, who traded and raided along the river routes between the Baltic and Black Seas from around the 8th to 11th centuries.\n\nIt is believed that these people originated from an area of Sweden known as Roslagen (at one time referred to as Roden), from which the name Rus was derived.\n\nThe Rus began as raiders and traders, their routes stretching as far as Constantinople (and quite possibly beyond!), but eventually they settled in and helped to found the territory known as Kievan-Rus – a massive area comprising of many Slavic countries. At its greatest extent (in the mid-11th century), it stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north, to the Black Sea in the south, and from the headwaters of the Vistula in the west, to the Taman Peninsula in the east. This territory united the majority of the Slavic tribes at the time.\n\nAccording to history, Prince Oleg was the monarch who decided to create Kievan-Rus. He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper Valley (to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east), and moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev.\n\nThree Varangian Norse brothers – Rurik, Sineus and Truvor – established themselves in Novgorod, Beloozero and Izborsk respectively. Two of the brothers died, leaving Rurik as the sole ruler of the territory and progenitor of the Rurik Dynasty. Shortly afterwards, two of Rurik’s men apparently asked him for permission to go to Constantinople. On their way south, they discovered ‘a small city on a hill’, which turned out to be Kiev. On Rurik’s orders, it was captured (along with surrounding territories). Shortly before Rurik’s death in 879 AD, he bequeathed the kingdom of the Rus to his kinsman, Prince Oleg, as regent for his young son Igor. Oleg captured Kiev from Rurik’s men (who were still stationed there), proclaimed himself prince, and declared Kiev ‘the mother of Rus cities’. Rurik’s descendants ruled regions of Russia until 1598.\n\nThe name ‘Rus’ may also have been derived from Rurik’s name, and it is also included in the names of modern day Slavic countries Belarus and Russia, which would once have been part of Kievan-Rus.\n\nThe Varangians were an elite army formed of Rus people – once Vikings, who now lived/traded in Slavic countries.\n\nDuring the Viking Age, ‘Rus’ would most likely have denoted exclusively Scandinavian people; however, as time went by, of course the Scandinavians would have mixed with the native Slavs. Many people living in modern day Slavic countries can boast a surprisingly high percentage of Norse DNA!\n\nBefore Kievan-Rus, the Slavs had no written language. The Byzantine Empire sent monks who created an alphabet suitable for the Slavic languages. This eventually developed into the Cyrillic script used today. Many people in Kievan-Rus learned how to read and write––unusual in Europe at the time. Some love letters and school notes written on birch bark have survived over the centuries.\n\nThe unusual political structure of Kievan-Rus led to more conflict as princes competed for control. Also, crusades to the South began destroying profitable trading routes. The sacking of Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 dealt an especially hard blow. When Mongols began attacking the borders, Kievan-Rus armies engaged in battle after battle. Still, Kievan Rus princes squabbled. Soon, Mongol invaders conquered the princes one by one. The city of Kiev fell in 1240, ending Kievan-Rus, the first Russian state. For the next 200 years, Russian territory would be control by the Mongol Khanate.\n\nMy Top 10 Nordic/Pagan Folk Artists\n\nI am a big fan of Nordic/pagan folk music, so here’s a list of my Top 10 favourite artists:\n\n1.

It is an often bleak, unforgiving land, with it’s ice sheets, fjords, harsh climate, rocky terrain and remoteness. The northeastern part of Greenland is now an uninhabited National Park, and the island’s entire population (comprising mainly of Inuits and Danes) is a meagre 55,877 approx. – astonishingly low, considering it’s overall land mass.\n\nIt has been inhabited intermittently for the last 4500 years by the native Arctic peoples, whose ancestors migrated there from what is now known as Canada (it’s closest neighbour, along with Iceland in the east). In the 10th century, Greenland was discovered and subsequently colonized by Norsemen, led by the infamous Viking, Erik the Red. Despite the inevitable hardships of this far-flung outpost, the Scandinavian settlers thrived for nearly five centuries. They even gave the island it’s name, in order to make it sound more appealing to would-be colonists!\n\nThe communities of Greenland flourished until the 15th century, when tragedy seemingly stuck… But before we find out what happened, it is necessary to take a leap forwards in time, to the year 1721.\n\nDuring this year, a Norwegian missionary called Hans Egede sailed to Greenland from his homeland, in search of it’s Norse community who hadn’t been heard from in 200 years. His goal: to convert them to Protestantism.\n\nWhen he arrived, after a few days of exploring the coastal landscape and navigating the iceberg-dotted fjords a little further inland, he couldn’t find any Norsemen whatsoever. Upon meeting some Inuit hunters, he asked them where the European inhabitants of Greenland were. In response, they showed him the crumbling ruins of an ancient church – the only remnant of 500 years of occupation.\n\nEgede later wrote the following:\n\n“What has been the fate of so many human beings, so long cut off from all intercourse with the civilized world? Were they destroyed by an invasion of the natives [or] perished by the inclemency of the climate, and the sterility of the soil?”\n\nActually, Hans Egede’s theories weren’t that far off the mark. However, I shall present each of the respective theories, all of which are very highly plausible explanations (at the very least, they should be considered as contributing factors).\n\n1. A war with the natives.\n\nThe Vikings and Inuits, despite living virtually side by side, were not friendly with each other. The Norsemen referred to the Inuits as ‘skraelings’ (an Old Norse term which is roughly translated as ‘wretches’). Aside from this derogatory name-calling, the Inuit tribes probably resented the Vikings’ invasion of their homeland (understandably). The Inuits probably would have had a significant advantage, too – they would have known the terrain like the backs of their hands, and most likely boasted higher numbers.\n\n2. Climate change.\n\nModern-day scientists have been able to determine (by drilling holes into and taking samples from the various layers of Greeland’s glaciers for laboratory analysation) that the climate in the area was changing gradually during the time of the Viking settlements being inhabited. Sea ice also decreased during this period, making sailing between Greenland and Scandinavia less hazardous. At the time of the Norsemen’s arrival, Greenland would have benefitted from fairly clement weather, and it’s warm seasons would have lasted considerably longer. This meant that the livestock could graze happily, and more crops could be grown and harvested before the winter months descended. As centuries passed, the climate became colder, the soil of the island affected by erosion (dramatically reducing the overall crop yield, and reducing the quality of grazing).\n\n3. A cataclysmic event.\n\nIn 1257 AD, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok (half a world away) erupted. Ranked by geologists as the most powerful eruption of the last 7000 years, Lombok had far-reaching consequences… Ice cores drilled from Greenland’s vast ice sheet (which covers a colossal 80% of the country) show that sulfur ejected from the volcano into the stratosphere reflected solar energy back into space, cooling the Earth’s climate.\n\n4. Starvation.\n\nDue to the Vikings’ settlements being situated in specific areas, carefully chosen for their proximity to the fjords, coast and most fertile soil, the land most likely suffered soil erosion thanks to (unavoidable) overgrazing. Eventually, the crops would fail and livestock would begin to die, before the human inhabitants of Greenland finally succumbed to slow, agonizing deaths.\n\n5. Isolation.\n\nGreenland has very few trees; perhaps this prevented the Vikings from building and repairing ships, and leaving to start afresh somewhere else.\n\n6. Disease.\n\nDuring the Vikings’ time in Greenland, they only founded two main settlements – the first known historically as ‘Gardar’, among the fjords of the southwest coast; the second 240 miles north, and known as the Western Settlement. Living in such tiny close-knit communities may have increased the likelihood of disease. An epidemic could spread rapidly in such places, and easily wipe out many (perhaps even all) of Greenland’s approximately 2500 Scandinavians.\n\n7. Ignorance.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Vikings ridiculed the native Inuits incessantly, considering them to be very much beneath themselves in terms of intelligence and status. Sadly, in hindsight, they could have learned a thing or two from the Inuits… During the winter months, the natives survived on a diet of mostly marine animals, which kept them warm and their bellies full until the weather improved; the Vikings, however, relied mostly on their crops and livestock. Also, despite being competent fishermen and occasionally going on walrus hunting expeditions along the north coast, their techniques and knowledge of the best hunting spots were nowhere near as efficient as those of the Inuits.\n\nIn terms of physical evidence (aside from the drilling of the ice sheet, of course) we have the following:\n\nArchaeologists discovered that the Vikings relied heavily upon imported goods, such as grains and iron. Being unable to travel as frequently due to climate change and lack of timber – coupled with the Black Death epidemic decimating half of the population of Norway (Greenland’s lifeline to the rest of the known world) – may have prevented the importation of goods from continuing. It is also prudent to mention at this point that there is no evidence that the Black Death ever reached Greenland (although some other type of disease certainly could have led to their demise).\n\nThere exist written records, detailing how sea voyages throughout the centuries could virtually wipe out local male populations in isolated island communities. In 1881, 80% of males from the Shetland Isles (off the coast of Scotland) perished in a single night during a bad storm, their tiny fishing vessels unable to protect them from the cruel mistress that is the sea. Towards the latter end of the Vikings’ occupation of Greenland, storms would have been more frequent and devastating than before, so perhaps this led to their population dying out.\n\nIcelandic records show that one Norse couple did manage to make it out of Greenland alive: Sigrid Bjornsdottír and Thorstein Olafsson were married at Hvalsey church (Greenland), and in 1424 they needed to prove the location of their nuptials. Letters and witness statements apparently satisfied the Icelandic authorities, although sadly the remaining records do not specify whether they were among a few lucky survivors of whatever catastrophe befell Greenland, or part of a larger organised migration.\n\nExcavations at the sites of some ancient Norse homesteads in Greenland hinted towards an organised departure; hardly any items of value were found, pointing towards the possibility that the residents decided to leave, taking most of their prized possessions with them. However, no records pertaining to this theoretical mass migration exist. It is equally plausible that they sold everything of value in order to avoid or delay starvation, or that later visitors looted the sites.\n\nMore excavations in Greenland during the late 1980s/early 1990s yielded an alarming discovery, which may be our biggest clue yet… Analyzing fossilised insects led scientists to believe that the Greenland Vikings did indeed perish, most likely from a combination of the theories above. The timeline would have occurred somewhat like this:\n\n1. Climate change.\n\n2. Starvation. (Remains of dog bones found inside the site of a Norse home showing knife marks, indicating that they were killed and eaten. The Vikings would only have resorted to eating their hounds if they were truly desperate).\n\n3. Death. (After all the livestock and supplies were consumed, humans would have eventually starved to death. Insects usually found exclusively in food larders or around decaying corpses were found in the bedroom of a Norse dwelling in high numbers – indicating that it’s residents died there, and lay undiscovered for quite some time).\n\nArchaeologists are still excavating Norse sites in Greenland, so new evidence may yet come to light. In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed reading about this mystery which has intrigued Europeans – as well as experts and enthusiasts – for centuries!\n\nThe ruins of a Viking Age Church.\n\nGreenland’s desolate landscape.\n\nThe northern part of Greenland, which is uninhabitable.\n\nWhy Have The Gods Forsaken Me?\n\n… This is something I hear all too often from my fellow Heathens. They become angry and disillusioned with the deities, and simply cannot understand why their prayers aren’t being answered.\n\nThe simple truth is thus: the gods don’t particularly pay attention to the lives of mortals.\n\nUnless you’ve done something significant or particularly astonishing, they’re probably not watching you at all. Remember – our gods are not Abrahamic. They do not observe us constantly, nor do they consistently control the events of/outcomes of our lives.\n\nAccording to the lore, the Three Norns weave the tapestries of our fates; however, ultimately, it is the choices we make as human beings which dictate how good or bad our lives will be, and lead to our inevitable ends.\n\nThe gods may occasionally intervene, however, they are not obliged to do so. Seeking their favour is to be encouraged, but begging on our hands and knees is tantamount to weakness, which will only lessen their opinion of you.\n\nWe are the true masters of our destinies.\n\nWe choose how we live our lives.\n\nThe gods owe us nothing.\n\nA lot of the time, people are generally too caught up in the stresses of daily life to really see or hear the gods’ subtle signs. Perhaps they are listening – but how will you know, unless you quietly observe?\n\nThe gods can bring us great comfort in times of hardship, and can no doubt rejoice with us in times of happiness or success; but to expect them to magically erase all of our worries would be (I feel) a massive insult.\n\nDo your best to live a good, honourable life. Seek favour from the gods of your pantheon, and strive for greatness. If you’re lucky, they will answer your calls.\n\nShit happens, and it is that shit which helps to make us stronger. Your struggles do not define you, however they definitely shape the person you later become.\n\nI’ll say it once more, for maximum effect: the gods owe us nothing!\n\nThe Vikings in Oxfordshire\n\nI thought I’d write about some of the many interactions between the Vikings and Saxons in my home county of Oxfordshire, so here it is… Hope you will enjoy it!\n\nMass Grave Discovered in Oxford\n\nIn January 2008, a group of archaeologists were invited to excavate the site of St John’s College (one of Oxford University’s 38 colleges) before construction began to create new student accommodation.\n\nThe site proved to be a rich source of findings, including:\n\nA 4000 year old Neolithic earthwork enclosure (Henge), probably used as a temple by a sun-worshipping pagan cult. This was one of the largest prehistoric henges ever discovered in Britain, at around 400ft in diameter.\n\nBroken pottery and food debris (basically, a medieval garbage dump).\n\nThen, suddenly, archaeologists unearthed an even more exciting discovery… Human bones! Sean Wallis (Thames Valley Archaeological Services) said: “at first, we thought it was just the remains of one individual. Then, to our surprise, we realised that corpses had been dumped one on top of another. Wherever we dug, there were more of them. Not only did we have a 4000 year old prehistoric temple, but now a mass grave as well!”\n\nAfter a month of digging and 2 years of lab tests, the researchers concluded that between 34 and 38 individuals were buried in the grave – and that all of them had succumbed to a bloody, violent fate.\n\nTwenty of the skeletons bore punctures in their vertebrae and pelvic bones, and 27 skulls were broken or cracked, indicating traumatic head injuries. From markings on the ribs, experts were able to ascertain that at least a dozen of the victims had been stabbed in the back, and attempts were made on 5 others. Some victims had suffered serious burns to their heads, backs, pelvic regions and arms.\n\nRadiocarbon analysis of the bones revealed that the remains all dated from 960 – 1020 AD. At first, experts assumed that they were victims of a mass execution (not uncommon during that period); the Oxford grave, however, did not fit the profile of a typical execution cemetery.\n\nThere were far too many corpses dating from the same era, whereas execution cemeteries tend to contain the bodies of people put to death over the course of many centuries. Also, execution victims tended to be various different ages and body types – by contrast, the individuals buried at Oxford were all fit, fighting-age males who were unusually large, with extremely robust physiques.\n\nWhen scientists measured atomic variations within the skeleton bone collagen, the tests indicated that these men had eaten more fish and shellfish than the average Anglo-Saxon. This evidence finally led to the conclusion: that this was a mass grave full of Viking warriors!\n\nAccording to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the King at the time (Aethelred ‘the Unready’ or ‘Ill-advised’) was ‘informed’ that the Viking mercenaries he had paid to help protect his kingdom intended to “beguile him out of his life”. Whether or not this threat was real or fabricated remains a mystery, but regardless, Aethelred used this as his excuse when he sanctioned one of the most heinous acts in English history: the St Brice’s Day Massacre (13th November 1002).\n\nAethelred himself wrote the following, 2 years later: “a decree was sent out by me, with the counsel of my leading men and magnates, to the effect that all the Danes who had sprung up on this island, sprouting like cockles [weeds] amongst the wheat, were to be destroyed by a most just extermination.”\n\nThe archaeologists who exhumed the skeletons in the grounds of St John’s College believe that they were indeed victims of Aethelred’s plot to rid England of all Danes. The King himself even described how the residents of Oxford killed a group of Danes in a local church: “striving to escape death, [the Danes] entered [a] sanctuary of Christ, having broken by force the doors and bolts, and resolved to make a refuge and defence for themselves therein against the people of the town and the suburbs; but when all the people in pursuit strove, forced by necessity, to drive them out, and could not, they set fire to the [building’s] timbers and burnt [it] down.”\n\nWallis, in charge of the excavation, surmises that the townspeople loaded the corpses onto a cart and drove out through the North Gate of the city, then threw the Vikings into the prehistoric henge – the largest ditch near Oxford’s northern exit.\n\nUnfortunately for Aethelred, his triumph on the St Brice’s Day Massacre was short-lived. The surviving Danes regrouped, and attacked the British Isles with renewed force. As a further consequence, many of the battles fought during these turbulent times set in motion a chain of events which would change the course of England’s future. It may also have earned Aethelred the nickname of ‘Ill-advised/Unready’!\n\nSupposedly, Gunnhild (sister of the infamous Viking Sweyn Forkbeard) was among the victims of the Massacre, although her body was never found. Neither her gender nor her Royal blood saved her, as apparently “[she was] beheaded with the other Danes, though she declared plainly that the shedding of her blood would cost all England dear.” – William Malmesbury.\n\nGunnhild’s words proved prophetic. In 1017 AD, Sweyn’s son, Cnut, was crowned King of England, and officially recognised as a monarch at a Witan (political meeting) at Oxford the following year. In 1022, another Witan was held in the city, this time to translate the laws of England into Latin, and apply them equally within England and the Danelaw. It would take 25 years for the Anglo-Saxons to reclaim the crown, and only a generation for them to lose it once more – this time to William the Conqueror (allegedly a direct descendant of the great Viking warrior, Rollo).\n\nIn 1036, the Council of Oxford declared Harold Harefoot (son of Cnut the Great) regent of England, on behalf of his brother, Harthacnute; so England was once again under Scandinavian rule!\n\nPrior to all of this, it is important to note that Oxford was razed to the ground by Vikings in 979 AD – which was probably a fundamental reason for Aethelred sanctioning the Massacre! And in tensions were clearly high on both sides, as in early 1015 Sigeferth and Morcar (chiefs of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw) attended an assembly in Oxford, where they were murdered by Eadric Streona (Ealdorman of Mercia).\n\nElsewhere in Oxfordshire…\n\nA rare Viking hoard (containing arm rings, coins and silver ingots) was discovered by a metal detectorist near Watlington. It was buried around the end of the 870’s, and amongst the hoard were 186 coins – some fragmentary – from the reigns of King Alfred the Great (of Wessex) and King Ceolwulf (of Mercia). Many of the coins were jointly issued by the two rulers, to celebrate them becoming allies. However, shortly after the coins were minted, Alfred and Ceolwulf appear to have turned against one another; Very little was written about the Mercian monarch, except for Alfred describing him as “foolish” and “a puppet” of the Vikings. The short length of the alliance makes the rare coins even more valuable. They are now housed at the British Museum.\n\nThe Battle of Ashdown (once Berkshire, now Oxfordshire) took place on 8th January 871. Alfred the Great was only 22 years old when he led the army of his brother, the then King Ethelred of Wessex, in a victorious battle against the invading Danes.\n\nIn the town of Taston (near Witney), there is an impressive 7ft tall standing stone. According to local folklore, it was caused by a thunderbolt cast down from the skies by the Norse god, Thor. This is how it came to be called the ‘Thor Stone’. It is first recorded in a survey of the Chadlington Hundred, in the late 13th century. It is believed that the village – Taston – got it’s name from the stone, as it is recorded as ‘Thorstan’ in the year 1278. It is possible that it was once part of a large megalithic pagan stone circle, and it appears that the rest of the stones were arranged into a neat pile at the crossroads at the centre of the village. The fact that the stone was named after a Norse god may indicate that there was a fair amount of Viking activity and influence in the locality.\n\nBicester (my hometown!) was situated in a Saxon border region, and a Mercian fort was probably established on the site of Graven Hill (on the outskirts of the town) to guard the frontier. The town’s name also reflects this – ‘Bicester’ means ‘Beorna’s fort of the warriors’. Beorna is another name for St Birinus, who helped introduce Christianity to the area in the 7th century. Graven Hill was the site of a conflict between the Saxons and Danes in 873, and Bicester itself was reputedly destroyed by a Viking raid in 912.\n\nThere is much more evidence of Viking events and artifacts in Oxfordshire, which I plan to cover some other time! A couple of years ago, I was lucky enough to see some of the skeletons unearthed at St John’s College at an exhibition ran by the Oxfordshire Museum in Woodstock. The entire exhibition was fascinating, I’ll try to upload some of the photos I took and describe my experience in more detail sometime soon!\n\nSt John’s College, Oxford.\n\nGraven Hill, near Bicester.\n\nThe Thor Stone, Taston.\n\nDrawing of Bicester, dating back to the Viking Age.\n\nSome of the coins found in the Watlington hoard.\n\nAn archaeologist uncovers the skeletons at St John’s College.\n\nSources:\n\nSmithsonian\n\nThe Guardian\n\nMegalithix\n\nBicester Local History Society\n\nWikipedia\n\nThe Oxfordshire Museum\n\nThe British Museum\n\nViking Cities of Europe\n\nMany cities in Europe were founded by the Vikings, and are still thriving 1000 years later! The evidence may be subtle in modern times, but there is no doubt at all that they certainly left their mark.\n\nHere is a list of cities originally founded by or forever changed by the Vikings:\n\n1. York, England\n\nOnce the Roman legionary fortress of Eboracum, and then the Anglo-Saxon trading port of Eoforwic (the then capital of the English kingdom of Northumbria).\n\nCaptured in the year 866, supposedly by the famous Viking Ivar the Boneless and ‘The Great Heathen Army’.\n\nKnown as ‘Jorvik’ during its time under Danish rule – it was later changed to ‘York’, which is the English translation.\n\nConveniently situated, being the capital of Northumbria, on the banks of the River Ouse, and not far from the coast.\n\n2. Kiev, Ukraine\n\nGets its name from ‘Kieven Rus” – meaning ‘land of the Rus”, which was once the name of large swathes of lands in Eastern Europe combined within the same huge kingdom.\n\nThe Rus’ people were said to have originated from Sweden, although over time they mated with the native population, making them a mixture of Slavs and Scandinavians.\n\nA Viking called Rurik was the first ruler of the city of Kiev, as well as the lands within the kingdom of Kieven Rus’. Strangely though, Rurik didn’t conquer it by force… The natives actually invited him to rule over them! Rurik and his brothers became the first of the Varangians, whom I shall write more about later.\n\nAfter Rurik’s death, he bequeathed his kingdom to his kinsman Prince Oleg (who was acting as regent for Rurik’s young son, Igor). Around 882, Oleg led a military force south along the Dnieper River, capturing several other cities before reaching what is now known as Kiev. He declared it ‘the mother of all cities’.\n\nKiev was perfectly located as a trading station, which probably explains why the Rus’ – descendants of Vikings – valued it so highly.\n\nThe Old Nor\n\n3. Novgorod, Russia\n\nLies in a strategic position alongside the Volkhov River.\n\nWas already a major trading station along the Baltics-to-Byzantium trade route, but was first recorded by the Rus’ people in 859.\n\nVarangian records often mentioned an important place called Holmgard,; this was a stronghold reportedly founded long before Novgorod, but it lies just 1.2 miles south of the current city centre. Holmgard (now known as Rurikovo Gordodische) was the capital chosen by the aforementioned Rurik in 860.\n\nThe name ‘Novgorod’ could mean ‘new city’ in the old Slavic language, however it is equally plausible that it comes from the Old Norse term ‘Nygardr’, or ‘Naugard’ in High German. The first mention of Nordic or Germanic etymology to the name ‘Novgorod’ (and other cities within the territory then known as Kieven Rus’) occurs in the 10th century document ‘De Administrando Imperio’ by Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII.\n\nMentioned in the Norse sagas as the capital of ‘Gardariki’ (Old Norse term for the territories within Kieven Rus’).\n\n4. Dublin, Ireland\n\n• Vikings ruled Dublin for almost three centuries, until they were defeated by the Irish High King Brian Boru in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\n• Two Viking settlements have been unearthed in the city – one at Wood Quay, and another at Christchurch Cathedral (originally a Celtic Christian church).\n\n• The Viking Age in Ireland began in the year 795, when Scandinavian warriors began attacking coastal Gaelic settlements in the region.\n\n• The Vikings seized Dublin for themselves in 841, after years of raids and battles with the natives.\n\n• Many skeletons and other archaeological finds have been unearthed in and around Dublin, and there is even a pub – The Brazen Head – which still exists, where Viking merchants gathered!\n\nThere are many other towns and cities influenced by and founded by the Vikings, but those above were among those most shaped by the Norse warriors. Do you live in a town or city with links to the Vikings? If so, feel free to educate us a little in the comments!\n\nA Heathen Altar\n\nWhen it comes to honouring the Norse gods, there’s really no such thing as right or wrong – we don’t need churches, and we aren’t even obliged to pray! However, some followers of Asatru prefer to set up their own altar or shrine in order to aid them in connecting with the deities.\n\nSo, here’s some ideas which may be useful if you do decide to set up your own altar:\n\n1. Images or statues.\n\nIs there a particular god/goddess you feel more connected to, or one you are especially trying to catch the attention of? If so, you can purchase or make figurines for your altar, or print/draw a picture. I personally would get creative and carve or draw my own imagery – even if you aren’t very talented, your efforts will not go unnoticed!\n\n2. A place for your altar.\n\nThis can be literally anywhere – preferably somewhere quiet, serene and which holds special meaning to you. It can be indoors or outside, but bear in mind that bad weather and vandalism could spoil your altar if it is not sheltered or on private land. Most Heathens simply erect a shelf somewhere within their home.\n\n3. Candles.\n\nMany people choose to light candles around their altar. They can also count as an offering (do some research on candle magick to learn more!).\n\n4. A chalice or cup.\n\nMead or beer are popular offerings.\n\n5. The Havamal.\n\nAlthough it should not be considered as a holy book, it is full of wise words to live by, which in turn will help to solidify your faith.\n\n6. A personal touch.\n\nFound something at a charity shop, car boot sale or pagan store which you feel would help to enhance your altar? Feel free to put it there! Family heirlooms or objects of sentimental value are also great additions.\n\nPlease remember: the above tips are only suggestions! Having an altar or shrine is NOT essential! I personally do not have an altar, and instead use an ancient tree which I’ve always felt drawn to. You too can practise your faith within nature, or build a shrine, it is entirely up to you and completely open to individual preferences!"
