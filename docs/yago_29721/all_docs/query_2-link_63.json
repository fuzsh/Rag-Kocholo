        "text": "When John of Spiš, the Archbishop of Naples, was deposed in 1411 it was not just the end of an interesting career of a medieval Hungarian cleric. It also brought an end to the century-and-a-half-long story of a Hungarian middle class noble family. The family's status had not been based on extensive property ownership: instead it relied on holding various ranks and posts across the entire medieval Hungarian kingdom. This article looks at the way in which these posts had been obtained and ponders the level of nepotism in this process. At first, the term nepotism, often used in this article, should be explained. Sensu stricto, nepotism has been defined as a favouritism based on kinship. We can conceive this definition from two points of view. This word is often used to describe a situation in which the benefit or the promotion stems directly from a relative (uncle, father, etc.). 1 However, there is also a second meaning of the word nepotism. In a broader meaning of this term, it is used as a synonym for favouritism. It could be described as a situation in which a high-ranking person (e. g. pope, king or bishop), as a source of benefits, promotes a person as a result of the influence and merits of the recipient's relatives. This type of situation (in Hungarian kingdom more common) can also be called indirect nepotism. While reconstructing the complete genealogy of the noblemen of *Štefkovce, 2 26 members (half men and half women) in four different generations\n\nThe aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the different branches of the historical studies can be used in the research of historical family names. One of the most important but strongly disputed questions of Hungarian historical personal name studies is from which century we can talk about family names in Hungary. This uncertainty has various reasons; for instance, it is very difficult to prove that it was hereditary (which is one of the basic criteria for naming an element a family name). In carrying out this work, genealogy and the history of estates can be helpful. The paper presents the three types of distinguishing elements which are regarded as the origin from which family names had developed (patr onym, placename and byname) with so me examples from 14th-century documents. I also intend to demonstrate how we can certify their hereditary char acter with the means of historical researches. Furthermore, I am to present some cases wher e a special Hungarian di stinguishing element de genere [‘from the kindred of’] appears in the name structure. Finally, my paper touches upon the question how one can explain with the help of historical research of the Hu ngarian society in the Angevi n Age that this element did not have a role in the development of family names.\n\nBased on the analysis of sources it can be stated that Polish presence near the king was constant and significant. The most significant officials temporarily supported the king, but did not accompany the ruler on his military campaigns. The king held Polish–Hungarian joint councils from as early as 1440. It is most probable that a significant part of the Poles took the Hungarian efforts of Władysław seriously, and many noble families saw great potential in a Hungarian service. In this paper we endeavored to call attention to the fact that a vast amount of Polish‑related genealogical data (seals, itinerary supplements) can be found from this era in the Hungarian and Austrian archives. We hope that this collection will provide assistance to many in their research.\n\nBeatrix Frangepán (* c. 1480, +(27 March) 1510) from the Counts of Veglia (Krk), Modrus and Zengg was a descendant from one of the leading families of the Hungarian–CroatianHungarian–Croatian late Medieval Kingdom. She became wife of Crown Prince János Corvinus-Hunyadi and later of Margrave Georg Hohenzollern-Brandenburg. From her first marriage, she had three children. One of these, Kristóf, who died young, was buried together with his father in Lepoglava (Croatia). Recently, successful archaeogenetic analyses have been performed on the remains of János and Kristóf Corvinus-Hunyadi; and in the course of these studies, the family background of Kristóf’s mother, Beatrix Frangepán, became an important factor. The present study provides a nine-generation family tree of Beatrix Frangepan as a complementary data pool for an eventual expansion of the archaeogenetic studies. Preliminary results of archaeological study of the supposed grave of Beatrix Frangepán are also reported."
