        "text": "I grew up watching soap operas. While *General Hospital *was \"my show,\" I adopted the entire ABC line-up, including *All My Children, One Life to Live *and for brief spells Loving and Port Charles. Later, I worked at a soap opera magazine and was the show editor for One Life. I'd visit the set, write all the news stories and interview the cast. I have to say it was pretty cool to get to explore the behind-the-scenes working of Llanview--go into dressing rooms, visit hair and makeup, and chat up the stars. So I'm feeling nostalgic today as One Life goes off the air after a 43-year run.\n\nWhen the finale was filmed in November, a deal was in place for the show to continue online, so many of the storylines wrapped up with \"to be continued\" moments. In the meanwhile, the deal fell through and today is the *end *end for many of the characters with a few exceptions--Roger Howarth (Todd), Kassie DePaiva (Blair), Kristen Alderson (Starr) and Michael Easton (John) are moving to General Hospital, where former *OLTL *executive producer Frank Valentini is now working.\n\nSo, in honor of a four decade plus run, I highlight some of final moments for the characters we grew to love over the years. Here they are...\n\nShow matriarch Viki Lord Riley Burke Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter Davidson Banks was proposed to by Clint Buchanan. Her final word was, \"Oh\" followed by tears so she never actually accepted, but they looked pretty happy...and with a name as long as hers, she's clearly not scared of marriage.\n\nBo and Nora Buchanan, who became grandparents during the final show, shared a kiss. He told her, \"Hey, I love you, red.\" Through tears she replied, \"I love you Bo Buchanan.\" Aww--two of my all-time faves.\n\nWhile they are moving to Port Charles, Blair and Todd ended their run in Llanview...in bed. But their sexy time was interrupted by John who came to arrest Todd for the murder of Victor Lord Jr. Clearly Blair was not so happy.\n\nThen the final shot was a gagged (and drooly) Victor, who was so not dead, with Allison Perkins, who said: \"Things are rarely what they appear\" as the screen faded to black.\n\nDid you watch the finale? How do you feel about the way it wrapped up? Do you watch any other soaps?\n\nNow don't miss our new slide show featuring all the famous actors and actresses who got their start on *One Life to Live. Think: Ryan Phillippe, Marcia Cross, Nathan Fillion and many more... *"
