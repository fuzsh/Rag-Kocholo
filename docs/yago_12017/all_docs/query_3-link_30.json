        "text": "As we mark another milestone in the journey of Maastricht University, I am inspired to reflect on the essence of our institution's commitment to excellence and innovation. On our Dies Natalis, we not only celebrate our rich history but also look forward to a future filled with boundless possibilities. This year, our focus resonates with the powerful quote: \"Talent Unlimited: The Labour We Need, The Potential We Can't Waste.\" In the realm of employer branding, these words echo the very core of our mission. At Maastricht University, we understand that true progress is fueled by the unlimited potential within each individual. Our commitment to cultivating talent goes hand in hand with recognizing the essential role that labor plays in driving innovation and success. As we strive to be at the forefront of education and research, we embrace the diversity of talents that make up our community. It's not just about filling positions; it's about unlocking the unique capabilities that each person brings to the table. Together, we create a dynamic and inclusive environment where innovation thrives. #MaastrichtUniversity #DiesNatalis #EmployerBranding #TalentUnlimited #Innovation #PotentialUnleashed\n\nDelighted to share that we successfully completed the first batch of one of its kind Practical based 2 days Masterclass for Physiotherapists in collaboration with PhysioPOV . It was a learning experience for me as well as the students. We had 23 participants and interestingly 60% participants were from BPT 3rd year, 18% each from BPT Interns and MPT 1st year students. Research to Reality is the first of its kind masterclass curated for students which gives guidance on the practical aspects of research. We covered the following topics- Day 1 ðŸ“ŒWhat is Research ðŸ“ŒWhy is research important ðŸ“ŒResearch for Physiotherapists ðŸ“ŒResearch beyond BPT and MPT thesis ðŸ“ŒTypes of Research studies ðŸ“ŒThe Research Pathway- From choosing a topic to conducting the research ðŸ“Œ How to choose a topic for your research Day 2 ðŸ“ŒComponents of a Research Paper ðŸ“ŒHow to search for research papers ðŸ“ŒHow to read a Research Paper ðŸ“ŒHacks for accessing full text articles ðŸ“ŒDoubt Clearing session. We will be doing another class soon. Stay tuned ðŸ’¯\n\nLast Thursday I had the privilege of attending the 69th convocation ceremony at University of New Brunswick as one of Chinyere O.'s guests (Congratulations Chi!). One of my biggest takeaways from that event was the speech given by Dr. Alan Cherrington who received an honorary Doctor of Science award at the ceremony. I would like to share the 4 words he asked the graduates to keep in mind as they embarked on their next adventure, as I found them to be deeply inspiring (thank you, Dr. Alan Cherrington!). 1. Confidence: Take a leap of faith, believe in yourself, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone. 2. Adaptability: No matter what happens, be prepared to adapt. Find another way to reach your goal or perhaps change your goal. Life wonâ€™t go the way you want all the time. 3. Passion: If you love it, itâ€™s the right job, even if the pay isnâ€™t great or the hours arenâ€™t awesome. If you love what you do, youâ€™ll work hard at it; if you work hard at it, youâ€™ll be successful. 4. Focus: itâ€™s better to go deep than to go broad. If you focus on one thing you can become a key opinion leader; people will beat a path to come to you. And one bonus point he added from a Tim McGraw song: Always be humble and kind. ðŸ˜Š\n\nRegistration is open for the 8th SEG Virtual Student Conference (Europe).

Yesterday I attended #WomenInPhysics career symposium as a mentor. It was a day of amazing stories, covering the whole spectrum of human emotions. I will reiterate a few thoughts and advices that I think are worth sharing: - Behind every story that looks successful, there is failure, insecurity and uncertainty. - Each successful career happens thanks to encouraging and supportive environment, either in the lab, or at home (or both). Though in some cases, with particularly contrarian-minded people, it happens despite of the lack of such support. - What often makes a HUGE difference for a career, is that people proactively seek support and guidance. Not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to learn everything from scratch, but finding advice and mentors. - Good mentorship is more like sponsorship. Take your mentee to a meeting to see how you discuss/negotiate, extend them your network. At the same time, don't solve things for them but guide them to find their own answers and help them to understand what really works for them. - KNOW THYSELF. A sustainable success is much easier when you know your personality, your working style, which are your real strengths, which are your weaknesses. - Find the right working environment that goes with your style, don't try to remake yourself to fit someone else's. - And have fun, of course! #careeradvice #phd\n\nRegistration is open for the 8th SEG Virtual Student Conference (Europe).
