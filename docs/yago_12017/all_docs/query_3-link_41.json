        "text": "August 29, 2022\n\nDefinitely my favorite of this series, probably because it was less detailed in describing magic and the hero was the most mellow\n\nJune 29, 2019\n\n\"Charmed\" is the story of Anastasia and Boone.\n\nSo I adore single dad- strong heroine romances, and this was one of the best in that category.\n\nOur h is the third Donovan witch, who is extremely cautious yet fragile after an incident in her teenage years left her scarred, making her afraid to love. She spends her days with her pets, mother nature, and taking care of her family, craving the happiness and intimacy that all couples in the family have.\n\nThings take a turn when Boone Sawyer, famous child illustrator, widower and single dad to Jessie moves in the next door.. and steals her heart!\n\nThere is a lot to love in this book- the purity of Jessie and Ana's relationship, the emerging love of Boone and Ana's, the family dynamics between the Donovans, Ana's inner strength and ability to give selflessly, the beauty of Ireland, the climactic almost heartbreak, the wonderful epilogue..*le sigh*\n\nI ADORED this book. It had everything I loved and so much more. Made me cry, laugh and get lost in its magical world.\n\nSafe\n\n5/5\n\nSeptember 12, 2014\n\nPositives\n\nCharmed is an emotional romantic novel, which takes you on a magical journey of love and sacrifice. Anastasia is a good witch who has the power to heal, but the cost she has to pay everytime she heals is very high. She takes the pain of others and experience it herself in order to relieve them. She is highly sensitive to emotions and cannot stand negative ones due to her fragile heart and her susceptible magic! After facing the pain of rejection from her love, she starts taking comfort in a life of solitude, with only her family as a source of love. She was happy in her life.\n\nBoone Sawyer buys the house next to Ana and settles there with his daughter, Jessi and her pup. He sees Ana and starts experiencing something that hasn’t happened to him in his life before, true love! He starts falling for Ana and vice-versa. Jessi and Ana also love each other. So the only thing that’s stopping Ana to accept a proposal from Boone is her Legacy, that is magic!\n\nThough Boone is a writer of children’s books, fairy-tales and stuff, Ana knows that accepting the fact that she is a witch won’t be easy for him, or for that matter for anyone! Read the book to know how he’ll accept this truth or whether he does or not!\n\nThis book has a lot of romance, magic, love, healing, faith and belief. What is not there to like! And I’m very eager to read the fourth part.\n\n[Yea, I know, I wrote the synopsis under 'positives'! That itself is the best part of the book (no-pun intended!)]\n\nNegatives\n\nThe last 25 pages were a bit of a slog.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn easy read. Will do you good as a breather from all the sci-fi, horror and thrillers. Recommended to all the Nora’s fans and anyone who can put up with a genuine romanticism.\n\nYou can read the original review at The Reading Bud\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\n\"Charmed\" is #3 in a sweet early romance series about three cousins who are witches with a family lineage that extends for generations. This is Ana's book. Ana's gift is as an empathy who can feel and take the pain of others. She is also an herbalist. Her new next door neighbor is Booth and his wonderful 6-year old daughter, Jessie. Booth writes fairy tales, but has his feet firmly planted is reality. His first wife died and he has devoted his life to Jessie for the last 4 years. When he meets Ana is amazed and attracted is an instant. Ana suffered rejection because of being a witch and has not told Booth, even when their relationship deepens and Ana is in love with him. When he finds out . . . well, it's not pretty. 3 1/2-Stars\n\nJanuary 10, 2018\n\nThis was a cute series with a paranormal twist.\n\nApril 3, 2019\n\nAnother sweet one ... with a psychic h who is H's beautiful gentle neighbor ... this H manages to put his foot in his mouth a few times ... I wanted to take away 1/2 star but decided to reinstate it as this book had a cute plot moppet ... who was super close to h ...\n\nMarch 1, 2013\n\nThis is such a sweet story. Anastasia is the third of the Donovan cousins, and she is a healer and an empath. She is also a herbologist, and has a little online shop in things made with herbs. Lotions and oils, fragrances and teas. She was hurt very much by the man she thought to be in love with some years ago, and since then has kept her distance.\n\nShe loves working in the garden, growing her herbs and flowers, and harvesting them. To use her magical powers to make them work better, to help people heal.\n\nAnd now, she has new neighbours. An adorable little girl named Jessie, who is six years old, and has a very naughty puppy called Daisy. The girl is a real chatterbox, and Ana cannot help but be enchanted by her. The girls father is not so happy with his beautiful neighbour, and the fact that she is chatting with his missing daughter. Other women have tried to find the way to his heart, or his wallet, by working on his daughter. He won’t be deceived again, but the sudden attraction for this woman baffles him. His wife has been dead now for 4 years, and his mother and in laws are nagging him to move on, to marry again, to give his poor motherless child a new mother. Which is the main reason he moved so far away from them. He can work anywhere he wants, as he writes and illustrates his own children’s books. And so Boone insults Ana, and he has to work hard to make it up to her. Of course there is Jessie who keeps hopping over to Ana, and Daisy the dog who makes her fall while carrying a stack of pots for her new plants. Boone rushes over, panics when he sees the blood on Ana’s leg, and insists he takes care of it for her. Of course Ana, as a healer, can perfectly take care of those scratches herself, but when Boone starts treating her like his daughter, and tells her a fairytale to get her mind of the pain, she is captivated.\n\nBoone wants nothing more than to carry Ana to her bedroom upstairs and make wild love to her, but they both are not ready for that. Sure, there have been women since his wife died, but nothing which implied feelings. And he knows Ana is not for just one afternoon. Especially not when she tells him she is still a virgin. They will have to take it slow, especially because Jessie is involved as well. She loves Ana already, and that goes both ways. But Boone is determined to seduce Ana, as he cannot stop thinking about her, and watching her from his deck while she is gardening.\n\nAna doesn’t want to start a relationship with Boone, before she can tell him what she is. A witch, an empath. Until faith intervenes, and she has to safe Jessie’s life. Boone can’t believe what he sees, and he cannot accept Ana in that moment either. And his harsh rejection of her, his fear, really hurts her as nothing else can. Can Boone ever make that up to her?\n\n8 stars.\n\n© 2013 Reviews by Aurian\n\nFull review on my blog, www.boeklogboek.blogspot.com\n\nNovember 12, 2023\n\nThis was just as mildly entertaining as I find most NR books to be. I listened to it on audio and it worked well as something that would keep my interest but not need a lot of attention to follow as I had a lot to do that week.\n\nAnastasia is from a family with a wee bit of elven blood giving them different kinds of magic. Ana's magic is healing and empathic. She likes her quiet life and has no interest in dating since some guy broke her heart after she told him the truth about herself. They never spell it out but it sounded like he was such a douche about dumping her, you wonder what she saw in the guy in the first place.\n\nAnyways, Boone moves in next door. He's a widower with a 5 year old plot moppet who practically covers my reader in sugar. Honestly, the daughter is so sugary sweet it was nauseating.\n\nThe dad is of course, tall dark and sexy... AND he writes fairy tales for a living.\n\nHe's a little pointy with Ana at first because he's distrustful of women. Not because his first wife was awful but all the women since trying to finagle their way into being wife number 2. I guess he's just that sexy ; )\n\nThen the story is about meeting her family, which would probably have been more entertaining if I had read the other 3 books in the series. And it's also about her not having told him about her magic until it was put to a dire test that almost costs her her life. Honestly I thought it was kinda stupid how he pushed her away for not telling him sooner. I mean I wouldn't tell someone until I knew them very well. (Especially with social media, although this predates that, having been written in 1992).\n\nBasically a nice guy with an overly cute daughter meets a nice girl. Both a twice shy after being burnt before. They have a pointless separation in the 3rd act for a month. Sprinkle magic and quirky relatives throughout. He does a decent wee grovel at the end.\n\nsafety is tiresome but technically safe. He has not been celibate since his wife, but just casual dates/hookups. He loved his wife but it isn't as profound as his love/attraction to Ana. The thing that cheesed me off, was that Ana is a 26 year old virgin! GD BS. SO SO tired of this BS. I mean, he can't be celibate because he's a man and men have needs... but she doesn't. GAH!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 10, 2021\n\nLukupiiriin kirjaa valitessa ajattelin, että tämä on juuri sitä, mikä tässä elämänvaiheessa menee parhaiten: arkifantasiaa, nykyaikaisia noitia ja hömppäromantiikkaa. Ja tämä olikin oikein hyvä aivorähmäkirja, kun mihinkään vakavampaan ei jaksanut keskittyä. Joiltain osin tämä jopa yllätti positiivisesti!\n\nAnastasia Donovan naapuriin muuttaa yksinhuoltajaisä ekaluokkalaisen tyttärensä kanssa. Tytär on niin hurmaava, että jo ensimmäisellä tapaamiskerralla Anastasia päätyy suukottelemaan tätä ja kutsumaan tätä päiväsäteekseen. Yksinhuoltajaisä Boone havaitsee 26-vuotiaan Anastasian kauneuden ja \"kelttiläisen luuston\" (mikä se ikinä onkin). Boonea alkaa panettaa ja sitten häntä panettaakin seuraavat noin 150 sivua. Panetus vain lisääntyy, kun Boonelle selviää, että hänen piirittämänsä nainen on NEITSYT. Boonen ja Anastasian suhdetta motivoi Boonen panetus ja valtava Anastasiaan kohdistuva omistamisen ja hallitsemisen tarve. Anastasia ilmoittaa monta kertaa olevansa itsenäinen ja omapäinen nainen ja oikein tyytyväinen myös sinkkuna (tosin tyytyväisyyteen on luonnollisesti syynä katkera pettymys aiemmassa rakkaudessa) - ja sitä hän kiitettävästi kaiken kaikkiaan onkin - mutta se ei poista Boonen hillitöntä halua omistaa Anastasia kokonaan. Anastasiaakin selvästi panettaa, mutta hänen panetuksensa ei oikeastaan vie suhdetta eteenpäin. Sen sijaan Anastasia sanallistaa tunteensa Booneen \"vedoksi\" ja lupaa olla tämän vierellä koko loppuelämänsä.\n\nBoone onnistui olemaan yllättävän ristiriitaisella tavalla kiinnostava hahmo. Herkkä satusetä, joka pitää hellästi huolta tyttärestään, jolle seksissä sanottu ei tarkoittaa ei, joka ottaa huomioon naisensa tyydyttämisen. Ja joka samaan aikaan stalkkaa naapurin pihaa niin intensiivisesti, ettei naapuri uskalla tulla ulos, kun pelkää törmäävänsä tähän, uhkaa ajatuksissaan \"laittaa ruotuun\" naisen, johon hänellä ei ole vielä minkäänlaista suhdetta ja on ajautua nyrkkitappeluun useammankin naisen sukulaisen kanssa. En tykännyt en sitten yhtään tästä hahmosta, minkä vuoksi petyinkin valtavasti loppuratkaisuun.\n\nBoonen ja Anastasian romanssia enemmän minua olisi kiinnostanut lukea lisää Donovanin klaanin vaiheista, enkä olisi pistänyt yhtään pahakseni, jos Anastasian sukulaisia olisi päästetty ääneen enemmän.\n\nLapset olivat tässä häkellyttävän valtava teema, johon en ollut varautunut mitenkään. Boonen tyttären Jessien lisäksi vauvoja alkaa yhtäkkiä tipahdella lukijan syliin yllättäen ja pyytämättä. Uusperhekuvion rakentuminen oli ihan kiinnostava lisä romanssiin, vaikka lapsi uhkasi viedä suuren osan dialogitilasta.\n\nNykyaikainen noituus herätti minussa myös monenlaisia tunteita. Vaikka yleisesti tykkään kamalasti kaikesta wicca-teemaisesta, tässä taikuuden materialismi sai olon todella epämiellyttäväksi. Vasta, kun taikuus alkoi oikeasti _tehdä_ jotain, pystyin rentoutumaan sen kanssa. Jos Anastasia olisi alusta asti muuttanut ihmisiä sammakoiksi sen sijaan, että yritti rentouttaa ja rauhoittaa itseään kantelemalla mukanaan erilaisia kiviä ja sanomalla, että niihin tulee vain uskoa, en olisi nähnyt kirjaa yksiselitteisenä mainoksena tietyille uskontosuunnille ja kristallikivikaupalle.\n\nOctober 18, 2019\n\nNora has been named the Queen of Romance for a reason. This book is further evidence. As the last in her Donovan Legacy trilogy it gathers all the characters to support our youngest witch. Our heroine has been living a quiet life. She has an herb garden and makes her brews to sell at her cousin's Wicca store. There are soaps, candles, etc. Each with a little bit of extra healing magic as any good Wise Woman of old would have done.\n\nSo when a cute little sprite shows up in her garden with a puppy in tow the two instantly bond. When handsome Dad shows up to bring his little girl and her puppy home it looks like a perfect boy next door romance. Especially when you add in that he is a widower who writes fairy tales. But, this is the twentieth century and he doesn't actually believe in witches or magic.\n\nExcellent story with the strong characters for which the Great Nora is known.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\nMy beautiful late nan owned every single one of Nora’s books.\n\nSo when she moved in with us for her last few years we spent the time reading our way through every single one together.\n\nGranted they are not the type of books I like to read, but they were still really good and sweet.\n\nNovember 3, 2018\n\nLovely\n\nAnother spellbinding story. Innocence, love and family. Always on my list of authors and books that I will never get tired of reading over and over\n\nAugust 2, 2021\n\nI read this combined book as part of a 3 story set and could not get through the 3 stories.\n\nI was very much put off by the intimate sections which portrayed rough handling by the male love interest which was more skin to physical abuse.\n\nWhilst the books 'Captivated' and 'Charmed' had entertaining female characters, the way their \"men\" interacted with them was chauvinistic and misogynistic.\n\nI enjoyed the magic element in relation to the main female characters except for the last book 'Enchanted' where the main male character who was the magic focus, I considered a pervert and disturbed and I could not finish the story.\n\nI have read many Nora Roberts books however this book is going into the rubbish bin.\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nThis is one more book from the Donovan Legacy series by Nora Roberts. This one is about Anastasia, a witch who is also a healer and Boone, an author of fairy tales. He’s a widower with a little kid called Jessie. A lovely book about Ana and Boone falling in love, despite their troubled past. Will Boone be able to accept that Ana is a witch? It’s definitely worth a read. I fell in love with little Jessie and her dad.\n\nJuly 24, 2013\n\nera para dar 3 mas pelo final merece um 4\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\nAmong Nora's many talents is her kid writing and Jessie is a GREAT book kid.\n\nOctober 21, 2021\n\nCharmed is the third of four novels in the Donovan Legacy series. Boone Sawyer and his 6 year old daughter Jessie move to Monterey next-door to Anastasia Donovan. Jessie is bubbly and gregarious, and Ana is quickly taken with her. However, Boone is initially standoffish towards Ana due to his overprotective nature - he has been a single dad since Jessie’s mom died when she was a toddler. Despite initial resistance, the attraction grows between Boone and Ana. Both are falling in love, but Ana hasn’t shared with Boone an important secret: she is a witch with the power to heal. This book is full of great domestic moments and (despite a paranormal element) feels like a story of two very real people falling in love. Definitely recommend this one! To hear a full discussion of Charmed listen to Season 3, Ep. #15 \"Nora Roberts' The Donovan Legacy: Charmed and Enchanted\" of Romancing the Shelf, a Nora Roberts podcast: https://romancingtheshelf.libsyn.com/\n\nJanuary 22, 2020\n\nMinun oli yksinkertaisesti ahmittava tämä kirja loppuun, sillä juoni kehittyi niin kutkuttavaksi. Kolmasosa oli oikeastaan kaikista vahvin tässä Noitakronikat -sarjassa, vaikka Roberts on pidättäytynyt tiukasti 300-sivun rajapyykissä ja etenee varsin suoraviivaisesti suhteiden muodostumisessa.\n\nTämä kirja toimii myös eräänlaisena aivot narikkaan -hömppänä työpäivien jälkeen. Välillä tarttuu mielellään tällaiseen höttöön tyhjentääkseen päänsä vakavamielisistä pohdinnoista. Tällaisen kirjan jälkeen jaksaa tarttua taas astetta haastavampiin teoksiin.\n\nSeptember 3, 2018\n\nCharmed: The Donovan Legacy, Book 3\n\nThe third Donovan cousin meets her lover. The love story of Ana and Boone. Boone and his daughter, Jessie, move next to Ana Donovan, a witch. When Boone met her it's love at first sense but Ana does not trust her feeling, she was hurt by someone when she told him she was a witch. Can she lets herself love someone? Great story.\n\nMarch 3, 2019\n\nLoved this easy and quick romance read. This may be my favorite of the series.\n\nAugust 23, 2019\n\nFun brain candy. Simpler than usual but still a quick fun read.\n\nJanuary 18, 2022\n\nNora Roberts easily kept my attention and interest with her writing. The 3rd book of Donovan's Legacy is much more romantic and passionate than the other series. Before I began Donovan Legacy series, especially 3rd book got my attention and passion interest with the annotation.\n\nFrom this love story I got what I expected: vulnerable sharings, passion love, a cute child, lovely conversations.\n\nBoone and Anastasia are really nice couple. I like them a lot. However, sometimes, in some scenes they irritated me.\n\nI think I'm not gonna read the 4th book of Donovans. Bc, in the 4th book we far from the main family tree 🌲\n\nMarch 25, 2021\n\nIn love with this book, and I can’t put this series down. So good!\n\nDecember 29, 2016\n\nI re-read quite a few Nora Roberts books in 2016. As you probably know, Nora Roberts has written a crazy amount of books, and I've read a lot of them (although not all). Some of her books aren't my favorite, but some I absolutely love. Charmed by Nora Roberts has always been a favorite, and after re-reading it, it still is.\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\nI loved the heroine, Ana. She's independent and strong, and happy with her life. Oh, and Ana is a witch, her whole family is, and she has a special talent. She's an empath, and she has some strong healing abilities. She tends to keep to herself, but she's very friendly, as well.\n\nBoone is pretty fabulous, too. I have such a soft spot for awesome single fathers, and Boone is that. He's a wonderful, loving and supportive father to his daughter Jessi. Boone is also a children's book writer, and as a children's librarian, that made me love him all the more. He would tell this fantastical tells to Jessi, and I loved it!\n\nJessi, Boone's daughter, is so freaking adorable. She's friendly and curious, and makes friends with everyone. Which is how Boone and Ana meet.\n\nThe chemistry between Boone and Ana was amazing! I felt their connection, but it was based on more than sexual chemistry. I could just tell how perfect they were for each other. When Boone discovers Ana's special powers, he doesn't handle it well, but luckily he realizes his mistake, because these two just need to be together!\n\nNora Roberts does father (or grandfather) figures so well, and that is evident in Charmed. I loved when Ana's father showed up and gave a (justifiably) hard time. It was funny and sweet and perfect.\n\nCristina Panfilio was a great narrator. I would listen to other books she narrates.\n\nWhat I Struggled With:\n\nSome of the actual spell business was a little hard for me to swallow. Lots of \"so mote it be\" and stuff like that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCharmed by Nora Roberts remains one of my favorite books by this author. I love the characters, the story line, and the connection between the hero and heroine.\n\nThis review was originally posted on Quinn's Book Nook\n\nAugust 18, 2012\n\nAna was a very complying character for me. I knew she'll have a hidden quirk but I always knew she’s pliable. She's just too amiable to be anything else. I also wondered what her gift was. Morgana and Sebastian's gifts were easy to spot but Ana's was a mystery to me. I knew she couldn't just be brewing potions and such and when it turned out that she was an empath it kind of explained some things from the two other books. Ana was reserved but very giving to a fault which I found kind of ironic and also adds a certain charm to her character. I liked that sometimes she shows a flare of temper, reading an even-tempered woman seeing red is always fun.\n\nBoone was very cute in a manly way. I find his character a little childish and immature but very appealing. I’ve always wondered what kind of man would catch Ana. I always thought that he would be someone soft hearted and kind with a hidden mischief on the side and true enough Boone was all that. I liked that he’s a writer too and that he writes fairy tales. I admit I got irritated at him at one point when he finally knew who Ana really was but then Boone had the right to let it sink and letting it sink took some time. He did make up for it when he stood up against a room full of witches and spirited Ana away.\n\nI liked the idea that Jessie brought them together. The addition of a child in the picture was a very good mix in Ana and Boone’s story. It shows off more of their caring sides which in some circumstance would have been a bore but not when their energies were divided between themselves and their mutual love for Jessie. I also liked that I’ve seen more of the Donovan clan. I mean the double triplet grandparents were very fun to read. Ana and Boone are lucky to have found each other. Both of them needed the other even if it wasn’t obvious. Ana needed Boone to show her that there was someone who accepts her for what she is. And Boone needed Ana to complete his life.\n\nMarch 4, 2017\n\nFollowing a similar pattern to the first two, Anastasia Donovan is a witch, this time with healing/empathic powers and Boone Sawyer doesn't believe in witches, which is at the crux of their angst. They spend the first half of the book falling in love - Anastasia is a virgin, Boone is a widower with a young daughter who ironically writes fairy stories (and still doesn't believe in magic). Then he gets a demonstration of Anastasia's power and suddenly there is angst. And, as in the previous books, the extended family comes for a visit as well. This one is okay - I liked the characters in this one (although Sebastian was the best character of the three). I'm thankful that Nora doesn't really spend any time in Jessie's head (she's the little girl) since I don't like how she does kids. So this keeps it rated high. There's no suspense or subplot, but the angst and romance here hold it strong.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 14, 2013\n\nTypical paranormal, magic romance novel. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they have a fight, they get back together, they live happily ever after. This one comes with a twist though, it's part of the Donovan legacy series, which means witches shown in a positive light, although I'm not thrilled about how they make witch mean Wicca when they are 2 completely different things, but I digress. Anyway, it's a cute, easy to read story with a few rather requisite steamy sex scenes, LOL. Light reading for sure! I never read the first 2 in the series, so I'm going to have to go back & find those, but fine as a stand alone too.\n\nAugust 25, 2020\n\nSo this story was one of those \"will the H pass the test when he finds out the h is a witch\" and since there's no other drama, of course he won't. So then it's really all about the groveling. And this was not good groveling. Boone isn't swoonworthy enough to get away with subpar groveling. Ana was too deep in the \"burn me once, shame on all men everywhere and I'll be single til I die\" cliche.\n\nSometimes these late 80s and early 90s books from Nora Roberts are charming and it's easy to forgive the chauvinism or chain smoking because I remember I'm reading a 30 year old book. But 80s, 90s, today, these people are boring and it just wasn't good.\n\nAugust 6, 2012\n\nThis is my favorite of the Donovan stories, so far. Anastasia seemed better fleshed out and her relationship with Boone made way more sense than the others did, I thought. It got a little manipulative near the end and I again didn't like the extended family dropping in for their obligatory threaten-the-boyfriend but in all, it was an enjoyable and quick read.\n\nA note about Steamy: The steam level in this one was average for Nora Roberts."
