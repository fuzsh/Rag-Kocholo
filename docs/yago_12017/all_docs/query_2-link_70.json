        "text": "Court Description: Authoring Judge: Judge Camille R. McMullen\n\nTrial Court Judge: Judge James A. Turner\n\nThe Petitioner, Angela Buchanan, appeals from the Rutherford County Circuit Courtâ€™s denial of her petition for post-conviction relief, wherein she challenged her convictions for criminally negligent homicide and aggravated child neglect. On appeal, the Petitioner argues: (1) she received ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2) her convictions were based on inadmissible Rule 404(b) evidence; (3) she received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; and (4) the trial court, in violation of Tennessee law and article I, section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution, failed to inform her that she could make a statement of allocution at sentencing. 1 We affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court."
