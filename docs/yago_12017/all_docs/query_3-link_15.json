She also had a role in the feature film Maid in Manhattan, starring Jennifer Lopez and recently completed filming a role in Todd Solondz's next film Palindromes.\n\nFans may remember Hillary from her primetime television series, Something Wilder, starring opposite Gene Wilder and a co-starring role on the series No Soap Radio. Her most familiar past role to fans has to be playing Margo Hughes for six-and-a-half years on As the World Turns.\n\nIn 2003, One Life to Live co-star Catherine Hickland and Hillary debuted their live comedy show A Couple of Soap Chicks at The Brokerage in Bellmore, NY.\n\nHillary is an avid tennis and golf player who loves word and card games. She's married to Phillip 'Nip' Smith. The couple have two children, Courtney and Phips."
