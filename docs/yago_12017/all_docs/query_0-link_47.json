        "text": "Del Delgado\n\nTéa's older brother, FBI Agent. He considers it his duty to protect Téa. Her closest familial tie.\n\nAbuela\n\nAbuela is Téa's grandmother.\n\nTodd Manning\n\nTéa's husband, most 'infamous' client, and soulmate. She married him for the money, but it turned to \"true love\" and they remarried, \"for love\" the second time around.\n\nStarr Manning\n\nTéa's adorable stepdaughter, who affectionately calls her stepmommy..... \"Tee\".\n\nRoseanne Delgado\n\nTéa's niece, initially came to town holding a grudge against Téa for her mother's death, but they have since mended their differences.\n\nMoose Manning\n\nTodd's pet parrot. Moose and Téa didn't get along too well... but ummm, are \"family\" just the same (lol)!\n\n*FRIENDS*\n\nCarlotta Vega\n\nTéa's longtime family friend and \"mother figure\". She brought Téa to Llanview to help defend son, Antonio\n\nRachel Gannon\n\nTéa's best friend and former roommate. Rachel and Téa commiserate over guys woes, counsel each other and are always there for each other.\n\nAndrew Carpenter\n\nOne of Téa's closest friends. They bonded over being left by their lovers Cassie and Kevin. Andrew is always ready to offer Téa advice. Téa and Andrew have slept together once.\n\n*FOES*\n\nCassie Carpenter Buchanan\n\nAndrew Carpenter's and Kevin Buchanan's ex-wife. No love lost between these two. Téa had a sexual affair with Kevin Buchanan, the man who Cassie eventually left Andrew to marry.\n\nBlair Daimler Cramer\n\nThe ex-wife of Todd Manning and Starr's mother, resents the time that Téa spent with Starr. Téa once provoked Blair to such an extent that Blair pushed her out a two-story window.\n\nKelly Cramer\n\nKelly approached Téa for 'hypothetical' legal advice. Their relationship hit a snag when Téa married cousin Blair's ex-hubby, Todd. These two have had a couple of fights; luckily for Téa, no windows were involved!\n\nDorian Lord Hayes\n\nMatriarch of the Cramer clan. Téa and Dorian had some heated confrontations during the custody battle for Starr (as Blair lay in a coma) and more recently (in her role as ADA), Téa prosecuted Dorian for Jessica's hit-and-run accident.\n\nNora Hanen Gannon Buchanan\n\nLlanview's legal ace. Téa served as her co-counsel on Antonio's case. Neither woman has been able to stand the sight of the other since Téa asked to be Nora's Junior partner, though Nora did serve as Téa's divorce attorney.\n\n*CLIENTS*\n\nAntonio Vega\n\nCarlotta's oldest son, Téa's first client in Llanview. Although there was a longstanding bond between their families, their relationship was very antagonistic.\n\nEli Trager\n\nEli ripped off the DA's bike, but Téa was able to get the charges dropped against the kid.\n\nAlex Olanov Hesser\n\nTodd Manning hired Téa to defend Alex during her trial for the murder of Carlo Hesser and the kidnapping of Andy Harrison.\n\nBo Buchanan\n\nWhen Bo was accused of murdering Georgie Phillips, Téa served on his defense team, despite Todd's objections and the fact that Todd was working to prove Bo's guilt.\n\n*Téa Delgado Manning* *Family, Friends, Foes & Clients*\n\nThis site (and linked sites) is not affiliated with ABC Daytime and is not endorsed by them.
