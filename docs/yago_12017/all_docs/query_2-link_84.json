        "text": "The show was centered around the wealthy Lord family, the middle class Siegels (an interesting mix of a Jewish/Catholic family), and the working-class families of the Rileys, the Woleks and the Grays. OLTL was the first soap opera to have a racially integrated cast. The show went so far as to deal with the taboo of an African American woman, Carla Benari (a.k.a. Clara Gray). Carla's mother, Sadie Gray, who was the neighbor and friend to the Woleks and worked in the Housekeeping Department at the hospital (she later became Head of Housekeeping there), discovered that her daughter, Clara, was pretending to be a white woman; she eventually persuaded her to reveal her true racial identity. OLTL was also first to deal with interracial relationships as Carla was engaged to a white doctor.\n\nOne of the last vestiges of the early denizens of Llanview can be found in Victoria Lord. Victoria, known as Viki, is the daughter of the newspaper tycoon, Victor Lord, the patriarch of dysfunctionality. (Technically, Viki's two son's Kevin and Joey are Rilelys, their father being Joseph Reily, Viki's first husband.) Victor had several illegitimate children among them, Tony Lord (now deceased), Tina Clayton, Todd Manning and Victor Lord Jr. Viki is also the mother of (fraternal) twin girls, Jessica and Natalie, who were fathered by Clint Buchanan.\n\nThe Buchanans blazed into Llanview in 1979 and the town was never the same. Asa Buchanan was the patriarch who had two sons, Clint and Bo. There was nothing that Ol' Asa liked more than a fresh filly, which usually caused him nothing but trouble. Ben Davidson was Asa's son by Renee, the ex-Madam of a Texas Whore House."
