The John Marvin, Jr. Trial

John Marvin, Jr., 47, stood trial for the August 28, 2010 deaths of Hoonah police officers Matt Tokuoka and Tony Wallace. After allegedly shooting both officers, other officers who responded to the scene said that Marvin engaged in a standoff with them for nearly a day before he surrendered.

Public defender Eric Hedland represented Marvin while District Attorney Dave Brower prosecuted the case. Sitka Superior Court Judge David George presided over the ten-day trial that was being held at the Dimond Courthouse in Juneau.

He allegedly remained in his house – only coming out briefly – before surrendering to officers over a day after the shooting. Jurors reached a verdict at about noon Saturday which was announced about 42 minutes later.

The prosecution was expected to rest its case on Tuesday with the defense presenting its case on Wednesday. But that timetable has slipped a bit.
