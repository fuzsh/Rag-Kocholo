Born on August 3rd, 1950, to Marvin A. and Helene Luke in Oxford, Nebraska. Marvin was baptized and received his first communion at St. Michaels Catholic Church in Oxford, Ne.

He graduated from Oxford High School in 1968 where he enjoyed playing sports. He met the love of his life, Barbara Luke (Leising), in the summer of 1969, and they married in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1970. Shortly after their marriage, Marvin and Barbara moved back to Oxford, where Marvin worked on the family farm following his father's passing.

He was a passionate horseman, enjoying the raising of horses and cattle, as well as many years spent with his kids in 4-H.
