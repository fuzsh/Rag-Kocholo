        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s planned appearance at the Iowa State Fair has been called off.\n\nThe Des Moines Register reports that Kennedy had planned to make an appearance at the Iowa State Fair at the Des Moines Register's Political Soapbox. That will no longer be happening due to what the campaign is calling \"security concerns.\" Kennedy had originally been scheduled to speak on Saturday, August 10th at 2:15 p.m. on a stage next to the Grand Concourse.\n\nKennedy was granted Secret Service protection following the failed assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania in July according to the Register. Kennedy's father and uncle were both killed by assassins. Kennedy's campaign did not respond to requests for additional information.\n\nKennedy spoke at the Political Soapbox in 2023 when he was running as a Democrat. The Register reports that he was one of 10 candidates scheduled to speak at this year's event which has become an Iowa political tradition. Officials with the Register say that they were told of no specific threat, but stated that the campaign had concerns about the open-air stage on a crowded fairgrounds.\n\nPer Secret Service policy, they do not comment on whether it has received threats about its protectees according to the Register. A source familiar with RFK Jr. and his security team told USA Today that they were \"not tracking any type of conversations like that, certainly not to the level that we had with Trump.\""
