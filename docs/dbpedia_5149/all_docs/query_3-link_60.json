        "text": "John Marvin Murdaugh is the younger brother of Alex Murdaugh and the youngest child of former S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Randolph Murdaugh III. Born in 1970, he was raised in Hampton County, South Carolina and attended the University of South Carolina graduating with a B.A. in Criminal Justice.\n\nUnlike his brothers, John Marvin did not pursue law as a career and opened two equipment rental companies in the lowcountry. He married his wife, Elizabeth Arnett in 2008 and they have three children. John and his family reside in Okatie, South Carolina.\n\nJohn Marvin is the brother-in-law and uncle of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh, and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh who were murdered on June 7, 2021 near the dog kennels on the family’s hunting property, known locally as Moselle. His brother Alex Murdaugh was indicted in these murders in July of 2022 and has pleaded not guilty to those charges. He is awaiting trial in Colleton County in January 2023.\n\nAccording to motions filed by Alex Murdaugh’s defense team, on the night of the murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, John Marvin was one of the people with whom Alex spoke to via phone on his way to his parent’s home in Almeda, South Carolina.\n\nTen days after the murders of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh on June 7, 2021, John Marvin and his older brother, Randy appeared on Good Morning America in a public show of support for their brother. In their appearance they asked for the public’s help in finding the perpetrators of the crime. Randy Murdaugh said his brother Alex was “just distraught.” He said he didn’t know of any family enemies.\n\n“I don’t really know of any enemies,” Randy Murdaugh said. “You hear all of this talk on social media with regard to Paul, but I don’t know of anybody that would truly be an enemy and would truly want to harm them.”\n\nJohn Marvin Murdaugh told reporters that Paul had been receiving threats from strangers after the 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach. On February 24, 2019, Paul Murdaugh was allegedly intoxicated when he crashed a 17-foot center console fishing boat into a piling near the Archer’s Creek bridge just north of the Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) at Parris Island. At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh stood accused of three felony BUIs in the fatal boat crash.\n\nJohn Marvin Murdaugh said he didn’t think the threats were credible and said the family didn’t try to identify the people behind them."
