        "text": "John Marvin Boyles, 72, passed away peacefully on Sunday morning, January 30, 2022, in Albuquerque. He will be remembered as a beloved husband, father, granddad, friend, talented engineer, and gifted singer.\n\nHe was born on December 29, 1949 in Dallas, TX to Marvin Avril and Johnny Geraldine Boyles (Huckabee), who preceded him in death.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 37 years, Susan; children Sally Barker of Albuquerque, NM, Sean Boyles (Heather) of Orem, UT, and Katy Woodward (Tim), of Albuquerque; granddaughters Violet Boyles and Finley Woodward; sister Carol Jane VanArsdahl of Tallahassee, FL; sisters-in-law Nancy Gerard of Rio Rancho, NM, and Carol Chandler of Bartlesville, OK, and many nieces, nephews, and friends.\n\nAfter marrying Susan in 1984, the family moved from Texas to Albuquerque in 1990, then to Farmington in 1998. He and Susan recently returned to Albuquerque in February 2021 to be closer to their kids and grandkids.\n\nJohn graduated from Sunset High School in Dallas in 1967, and attended General Motors Institute in Flint, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering while also working in GM plants. He was a natural engineer, always curious to figure out how things worked. Over the span of his 40+ year career as an engineer, he contributed his talents to companies such as Aerospatiale Helicopter Corp and Six Flags over Texas in Dallas, Riley Industrial Services and Henry Production Company both of Farmington, retiring in 2020. He lent his building talents to many additional projects, including Habitat for Humanity and making all the sets for his daughter Katy's dance recitals with Mann Dance of Farmington.\n\nHe was a life-long musician, growing up playing accordion and serving as Drum Major of his high school band where he played trombone, then later playing guitar and singing in many, many choruses. He performed with Albuquerque Civic Light Opera, the New Mexico Symphonic Chorus, Masterworks in Farmington, and every Sunday with his church choir.\n\nJohn was a dedicated man of faith, which he shared through his music and unconditional support of others. He was actively involved in church, serving as an elder and on the building committees of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Albuquerque. He was also active at First Presbyterian and served as an Elder at Bethany Christian in Farmington.\n\nThe family would like to extend sincere appreciation to the friends and family members who have supported them during this time, and to the dedicated doctors and nurses who oversaw John's care.\n\nA memorial will be held on Saturday, February 12, at 10 a.m. at Covenant Presbyterian Church, 9315 Candelaria Rd. NE in Albuquerque, NM. The service will be livestreamed for those who are unable to attend via the church's YouTube channel. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in John's memory to the following organizations:\n\n- Tres Rios Habitat for Humanity of Farmington\n\n- Animal Humane New Mexico\n\n- Roadrunner Food Bank"
