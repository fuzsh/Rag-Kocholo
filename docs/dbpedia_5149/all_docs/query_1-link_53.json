        "text": "FORT WORTH, Aug. 27 (UPI)—Marvin Leonard, who built an $835 bankroll into a profitable department store, grubstaked Ben Hogan's first try at pro golf and founded two of the country's top golf courses, died yesterday. He was 75 years old.\n\nOpened First Store in ‘18\n\nMr. Leonard and his brother, G. T., were a couple of Texas farm boys when they opened their first store in Fort Worth in 1918. The counters were boards on barrels and the dis play cases, wash tubs. But Mr. Leonard and another brother, Obadiah, who soon succeeded G. T., had a knack for making merchandise move fast—and, over the years, built a multi million dollar business.\n\nThey often bought in mass, kept unit prices and profits low and made customers feel at home.\n\nMr. Leonard once remarked: “If you see a man who wants to spit, walk in front of him and spit, so he'll see that it's the thing to do.”\n\nMr. Leonard founded the Colonial Country and Shady Oaks Country Clubs in Fort’ Worth, later selling both to their memberships after he got them operating. He was instru mental in luring the United States Open to Colonial in 1941, and in starting the Colonial Na tional Invitation Tournament in 1946.\n\nBen Hogan, a close friend of the man everyone ‘ knew as “Mr. Marvin,” often joked that when Mr. Leonard built Colo nial, a low hook was one of the key strokes in Mr. Leonard's golf game.\n\n“That's why every green was placed to the left of the tee,” he added.\n\nSurviving Mr. Leonard are his widow, the former Mary Elinor Vaughan, and four daughters, Mrs. Harry H. Porter Jr., Mrs. John M. Griffith Jr., Mrs. Madelon L. Mariotti and Miranda.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 11 A.M. today at the First United Methodist Church in Fort Worth."
