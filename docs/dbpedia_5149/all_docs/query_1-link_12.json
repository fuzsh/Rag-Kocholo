        "text": "The English home of the Marvins, for a century and a half prior to the emigration to America, was in the county of Essex. A hundred years before that there were several Marvin families living in and near Ipswich, Suffolk. The authentic family record traces to Roger Marvin, of St. Stephens parish, Ipswich, who was born as early as 1430. The American ancestor of the Albany family was Reinold Marvin, spelled in the Connecticut records, Reginold, Reignold, Reynold, Reinold and Renald. Between Roger Marvin (1430) and Reinold (2) (1593) there were four generations, or Reinold was of the sixth generation in England, thus: i. Roger. ii. John (1). iii. John (2). iv. Reinold (1). v. Edward. vi. Reinold (2). The ancestors were \"Yeomen,\" owning the lands they occupied, and many derived income from tenants who held under them. Edward, father of Reinold, was born in Ramsey, about the year 1550. He was a man of considerable wealth, owning lands in other parishes, which he bequeathed to his sons. His wife was Margaret ————, who survived him. He died in Great Bentley, and was buried in St. Mary's churchyard, of that parish. His will names children: Edward, Thomas, Richard, Robert, John, Reinold, Elizabeth and Matthew. Of these the first to come to America was Matthew, who took passage for New England in the ship \"Increase,\" Robert Lea, master, with his family, April 15, 1635. He was one of the twelve very earliest emigrants whose names are known among the settlers in Hartford, Connecticut, who formed the company thereafter known as the \"Adventurers.\" In 1650 he located in Norwalk, Connecticut. It was said of him two hundred years later, \"The name of Matthew Marvin is inscribed on almost every page of Norwalk's early history. He was a Puritan by blood … Devout, discreet, calm, sound in judgment, he gained and held the confidence of his fellow citizens and discharged for them many offices of civil life.\" His first wife was Elizabeth, whom he married in England; his second was Mrs. Alice Bouton, widow of John, of Hartford.\n\n(I) Reinold Marvin, the emigrant ancestor, son of Edward and Margaret Marvin, was baptized in St. Mary's Church, Great Bentley, Essex, England, June 7, 1593, died in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1662. He resided in his native parish until just before his departure for New England, where his brother Matthew had preceded him. The date of his sailing or the name of the ship is not known. The last mention of him in Great Bentley was in 1637; he appears in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1638, which approximately establishes the date. His name appears on a list of Hartford landowners in 1639-40. He removed to Farmington, Connecticut, where he built a house. He next removed to Saybrook, Connecticut, where he was made a freeman, May 20, 1658. He is frequently named in the colonial records of Connecticut. He held no public office, but is styled \"Mr. Reynold Marvin.\" Lyme, just across the Connecticut river from Saybrook, was made a distinct town in May, 1667. Its meadows and cornfields had been cultivated by armed men from Saybrook, among whom no doubt were Reinold and his son. He built a house in Lyme, retaining his home lot and considerable property in Saybrook. At his death his largest holdings were in Lyme. The value of his estate, 820 pounds, was a large sum for that period of colonial history. He married, probably in 1617 or 18, Marie ————. She died in Lyme, not long before her husband, as is evident from his will. Her death was attributed to \"Witch Craft.\" At a quarter court held at Hartford, September 5, 1661, Nicholas Jennings and his wife Margaret, of Saybrook, were indicted for \"having entertained familiarity with Sathan… and by his help done works of above, ye course of nature, to ye loss of ye lives of several persons and in priculer ye wife of Reinold Marvin, with sorceries.\" The jury did not agree; \"the majority of them found them guilty and the rest, strong ground for suspicion.\" Children, all born in England, with baptismal dates:\n\nWilliam. November 4, 1618.\n\nElizabeth, April 19, 1621.\n\nMary, October 27, 1622.\n\nJohn, buried March 16, 1626.\n\nElizabeth, baptized April 29, 1627.\n\nSara Marie, July 22, 1629.\n\nReinold; see forward.\n\nAbigail, May 4, 1634.\n\nMary, October 23, 1636, married, about 1663, Ensign Samuel Collins; died March 5, 1713-14.\n\n(II) The St. Mary's registers thus have record of the baptism of Reinold Marvin — \"Reinold, the sonne of Edward Mervin and Mary his Wyffe, was christened the 20th of Dec in Anno 1631.\" He died in Lyme, Connecticut, August 4, 1676. He became a freeman of Saybrook, May 20, 1658, the same day with his father. He owned much land in Saybrook and Lyme. By his inheritance under his father's will he became about the richest man in the town. Savage [James Savage, A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England] says he was a deacon of the church. This probably refers to his son Reinold, as the Lyme church was not regularly formed until 1693, although the Rev. Moses Noyes preached there regularly in 1666. He represented Lyme in the general court in 1670, and from 1672 until his death. His military title lieutenant, was earned; he was appointed \"Sergeant to ye band at Sea Brook\" by the general court at Hartford, October 3, 1661, and on the death of Lieutenant Waller succeeded to that rank. Though ranking as lieutenant, he was commanding officer to the train band, as Lyme had not families enough to form a full band of sixty-four soldiers with captain and officers. The Lyme and Saybrook train bands had some military experience under Lieutenant Marvin. War had been declared against the Dutch in November, 1672, and a special session convened at Hartford ordered that all train bands \"should be complete in their arms.\" In July, 1676, Andros attempted to seize the fort at Saybrook, and it was hurriedly manned by the train bands. Lieutenant Reinold is often mentioned in the Connecticut colonial records. He married, about 1662, Sarah, third daughter of George, Jr., and Sarah Clark. She was baptized February 18, 1643-44, in Milford, Connecticut. She survived her husband and married Captain Joseph Sill, the noted Indian fighter. She died in Lyme February 1, 1715-16, and is buried in the Duck river burying-ground with her two husbands. It is in this burial place that it is supposed Reinold, the emigrant, and his wife are buried. The children of Lieutenant Reinold and Sarah (Clark) Marvin, all born in Lyme, Connecticut, were:\n\nJohn, 1664-65.\n\nReinold (3); see forward.\n\nSamuel, 1671.\n\nSarah, 1673.\n\n(III) Captain Reinold (3), son of Lieutenant Reinold (2) and Sarah (Clark) Marvin, was born in 1669, in Lyme, Connecticut, died there October 18, 1737. He was chosen one of the first two deacons in the First Congregational Church, Lyme, when it was formed, March 27, 1693, but he is more frequently referred to in the later town records by his military title. He was sergeant of the Lyme train band as early as 1702 and probably held that position until 1712, when he was appointed ensign. On May 8, 1718, the legislature established and confirmed Mr. Reinold Marvin to be captain of the first train band or company in Lyme. He was chosen townsman in 1697, 1702-03-05-o6; first townsman in 1707-22-25-28-31-32. He was constable in 1694; collector of rates, 1713-14; grand juryman, 1714-35; sealer of weights and measures, 1715; lister, 1729; moderator, 1721-23-24, and was on numerous important committees. April 28, 1718, when there was a vacancy in the office of minister, the town appointed \"Reinold and Samuel Marvin on committee to agree with Samuel Ruswell to settle in this town in the work of the ministry.\" He represented Lyme in the general court most of the time from 1711 to 1728, inclusive, a period of continual service that shows the estimation in which he was held by his townsmen. In the colonial records of the state, from 1706 onward, there are frequent references to him. The tombstones of Captain Reinold Marvin and his two wives are still standing in excellent preservation in the Duck river burying-ground. He married (first), about 1696, Phebe, daughter of Lieutenant Thomas and Mary (DeWolf) Lee, born August 14, 1677, in Lyme, died there October 27, 1707; married (second), June 30, 1709, Martha, daughter of Sergeant Thomas and Miriam (Tracy) Waterman, born December, 1680, in Norwich, Connecticut, died November 18, 1753, in Lyme.

He owned land in Colchester. He was chosen deacon of the Lyme church, January, 1741, having been admitted a member in June, 1731. Like his father he held military as well as ecclesiastical office, having been confirmed as lieutenant of the \"South company or train band\" of Lyme, in October, 1730. He is also spoken of as Captain Marvin. He was admitted freeman September 14, 1731; chosen sealer of weights and measures in 1729; town treasurer, December, 1734, and \"to have 20 pounds for making the town and country rate\"; grand juryman, 1736; surveyor of highways, 1738; lister, 1739, in which year the town granted him liberty to build a wharf on the east side of \"Lieutenant River\"; in 1750 he had liberty to build a pound on his land adjoining the highway, and was appointed keeper. The church records show that he sometimes laid himself open to the strict discipline of the time, but he held his office \"in good and regular standing\" to the close of his life. He married (first), December 23, 1725, his cousin, Sarah, daughter of John Marvin, and widow of John Lay; married (second), July 7, 1746, Mrs. Mary Kellogg, daughter of John Niles, and widow of Jonathan Kellogg, of Colchester, Connecticut, born June 20, 1716, died March 9, 1812.

Griswold & Company and the Albany Iron Works, and General Marvin was elected a director, secretary and treasurer. On September 1, 1885, this concern was succeeded by the Troy Steel and Iron Company, which went into the hands of a receiver in 1893. General Marvin continued as director, secretary and treasurer of the company until its business was closed up, November 1, 1895.
