It is not known which of the brothers was the oldest, nor in what year Reinold Marvin came to New England. Matthew, and his family, with his sister Elizabeth, came over from England in 1635, as will be sees by the following statement: During the summer months of 1842, James Savage, Esq., of Boston, Mass., who was on a visit to England, was chiefly occupied with searching for materials to illustrate the early annals of New England. He was richly compensated for his toil. The result of his investiations was published in the 8th Vol. Mass. Hist. Coll., 3d series, p. 243, and onward, under the title of \"Gleanings for New England History.' From this article I extract the following items:\n\n\"Perhaps the acquisition most valuable, in the opinion of our local antiquaries, is my, copious extracts from a MS. volume in folio, at the Augmentation Office, (so called,) where the Rev. Joseph Hunter, one of the Record Commissioners, presides, in Rolls Court, Westminster Hall. It contains the names of persons, permitted to embark, at the port of London, after Christmas 1634, to the same period in the following year, kept generally in regular succession. This was found a few months since, and may not have been seen by more than two or three persons for two hundred years.\"\n\nUnder date of \"15th April,\" 1635, is the following entry:\n\n\"Theis parties hereafter expressed, are to be transported to New England, imbarqued in the Increase, Robert Lea, master, having taken the oath of allegiance and supremacy, as also being conformable, &c. whereof they brought testimony per certif. from the Justices and ministers where there abodes have lately been.\"\n\nThe following names are included in the list above referred to:\n\n\"husbandman Matthew Marvyn, ae 35 yrs.\n\nuxor Elizabeth Marvyn, 31\n\nElizabeth Marvin, 31\n\nMatthew Marvyn, 8\n\nMarie Marvyn, 6\n\nSara Marvyn, 3\n\nHanna Marvy 1/2\"\n\nThe common ancestor probably resided in Essex, Co. Eng. His children were,\n\n1. Reinold,(This name is spelled in different waysReginold, Reinold, Renold, Reynold. I have used Reinold, in this work, as it is generally so spelt on the Colony Record of Conn.) who came to New England about 1635.\n\n2. Matthew, b. about 1600, m. Elizabeth ---, came to N. E. in 1635.\n\n3. Elizabeth, b. about 1604, came to N.E. in 1635, m. John Olmsted, of Hartford, and afterwards of Saybrook. She d. without issue, at Norwich.\n\nThese brothers were among the original settlers of Hartford, Conn., and both were proprietors of land in that ancient town. Reinold removed to Saybrook before 1639; and d. in that town in 1662 or 1663. Matthew resided on the corner of Village and Front streets, Hartford, for some years. He was among the pioneers in the settlement of Norwalk, which town he represented in the General Court in 1654. Matthew, his son or grandson, represented that town in 1694 and 1697; Samuel in 1718; and John in 1734 and 1738. Reinold Marvin was among the original proprietors of Hartford, Conn. He removed to Saybrook before 1639. He d. in Saybrook in 1662 or 1663. He had two children, Reinold and Mary, and probably other daughters. Sarah Marvin, who m. Capt. Joseph Sill, of Lyme, Feb. 12, 1657, may have been his daughter. A copy of his will is extant, the first clause of which bestows his house and lands on his son Reinold, and the second clause provides that to each of his grand children(The grand children referred to in the will may have been the children of Mary, or of some other daughter. They were not the children of Reinold, as his oldest child was not born until 1665.) \"there be provided and given a Bible, as soon as they are capable useing of them.\" After which he disposes of his personal property. It is not ascertained at what time, or to whom his son Reinold was married. His daughter Mary m. William Waller, of Saybrook, who was a large landed proprietor, as numerous deeds are on record, of conveyances of land by his widow, after his decease. No record of her children found. Reinold Marvin, (son of the preceding,) was b. about 1634. He is known on the town records as Lieutenant Reinold Marvin. He represented Lyme in the General Court from 1670 to 1676. He was one of a Committee appointed to divide the town of Saybrook, in the year 1665. That part of the town lying east of Connecticut river, was named Lyme, from Lyme Regis, in the south-west of England, the native place of the Griswold family, who were large land proprietors in this part of Saybrook. Lieut. Marvin was also a large landholder, and a prominent man in the town. He had three sons,John, born 1664-5; Reinold b. 1669; and Samuel b. 1671. He d. in 1676, aged 42 years. His remains were interred in the old burial ground in Lyme villagegrave about the centre of the burial ground. The following is the inscription on his grave stone: \"1676. Lieut. Reinold Marvin.\" John Marvin, first son of Lieut. Reinold, b. in Lyme, 1664-5, m. Sarah Graham, dau. of Henry Graham, (or Grimes,) of Hartford, May 7, 1691; d. Dec. 11, 1711, aged 47. His wife d. the relict of Richard Sears, in Lyme, Dec. 14, 1760, aged 91. Their children were, Sarah, Mary, John, Elizabeth, Joseph, Benjamin, Mehitabel and Jernima.Uriah Marvin, John Mahan, and Alexander Marvin, merchants in Albany, N.Y., are descendants of John Marvin; as is also Rev. Uriah Marvin. Edward C. Delavan, Esq. of Ballston, N.Y., and Prof. John Pitkin Norton, of Yale College, m. female descendants in this family. Reinold Marvin, second son of Lieut. Reinold, was b. in 1669. He was famous as \"Lyme's Captain.\" He was a deacon in the Congregational church. He represented Lyme in the General Court from 1701 to 1728. He was first m. in 1695, to Phebe ----; she d. Oct. 21, 1707; m. the second time in 1708, to Martha Waterman, daughter of Thomas Waterman, of Norwich; she d. Nov. 1753, aged 73. He d. Oct. 18, 1737, aged 68, and was interred in the burial ground in Lyme village. The following is inscribed on his tomb-stone: \"This Deacon, aged sixty-eight, Is freed on earth from serving; May for a crown no longer wait, Lyme's Captain, Reinold Marvin.\"\n\nThe above inscription, as also that on the grave stone of his first wife, was executed by an illiterate artist, and with bad spelling, and the effects of time, is now (1848) rather obscure. The children of \"Lyme's Captain,\" are as follows: Phebe, Reinold, Lydia, Esther, (by 2d wife,) Martha, Elisha, (d. in childhood,) James, Sarah, Elisha, and Miriam. Reinold Marvin, first son of Captain Reinold, was known and spoken of as Deacon Marvin. A great many anecdotes are related concerning \"Deacon Marvin\"which have generally been attributed to \"Captain Reinold.\" It is undoubtedly the fact, from a full investigation of the matter, that they all belong to his son Reinold; both being Deacons, and both having the same Christian name, the mistake could easily be made. This son Reinold was unquestionably the poet who composed the epitaphs on his father's and mother's tomb-stones, and the odd genius of whom a multitude of anecdotes and queer sayings and rhymes, are still related;the most of them are positively known to apply only to the son of Captain Reinold. An aged descendant of this deacon, as also other aged persons now living in the vicinity, insist that this is the fact. Mr. Barber, in his \"Historical Collections of Connecticut,\" has published some of these anecdotes, and attributes them, undoubtedly from hearsay, to \"Lyme's Captain.\" It is to be hoped that in future editions of his work, he may correct the mistake. The following are some of the descendants of Captain Reinold Marvin: Gen. Elihu Marvin, who resided in Norwich, and d. there in 1798. Richard P. Marvin, now a Judge of the Supreme Court in the State of N.Y., and formerly a Member of Congress. William Marvin, now a District Judge of the U.S. Court for the District of Florida. Dudley Marvin, now a Member of Congress, and formerly for several years a member of the same body. Rev. Elihu P. Marvin, and Rev. Abijah P. Marvin. William Marvin, Esq., of Lyme, for some time Judge of Probate.\n\nSamuel Marvin third son of Lieut. Reinold Marvin, was b. in Lyme, 1671; m. Susannah Graham, of Hartford, May 5, 1699, d. March 15, 1743, aged 72 years. He represented Lyme in the General Court in 1711 and 1722. Children, Samuel, Zechariah, Thomas, Matthew, Abigail, Elizabeth, Nathan, Nehemiah, Mary and a son, twins, who died in infancy.\n\nHenry M. Waite a Judge of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, is a descendant of Samuel Marvin.\n\nMatthew Marvin (first) came to New England in 1635, as is stated on page 285. His children were, Matthew, born in England about 1627; Mary b. in England about 1629, m. Richard Bushnell, of Saybrook, in 1648; Sarah b. in England about 1632; Hannah b. in England about 1634, m. Thomas Seymour in 1653; Abigail b. at Hartford, m. J. Bouton; Samuel bap. Feb. 6, 1647-8; Rachel bap. Dec. 30, 1649. He removed with his family, to Norwalk, where he died at an advanced age, in 1680.\n\nMatthew Marvin (second,) son of the foregoing, came to New England with his father in 1635, and was then eight years of age. He was one of the original proprietors of Norwalk, to which place he went with his father. He had six children; the order or date of birth has not been ascertained, viz. Matthew, who m. Rhoda St. John, and died without leaving issue; Sarah, who m. Thomas Betts, of Norwalk, in Jan. 1680; Samuel; Hannah, who m. Epenetus Platt; Elizabeth, who m. Joseph Platt, Nov. 6, 1700; John b. Sept. 2, 1678. (It is very difficult to reconcile the records of the families of the first and second Matthew.)\n\nElizabeth Marvin the sister of Matthew, sen'r., aged 31 years when she came with him to this country, in 1635, m. John Olmsted, and d. in advanced age, at Norwich; the same John Holmsted, (as spelt on the Norwich records,) who first settled at Hartford, as early as 1639.\n\nMary Marvin daughter of Matthew, sen'r., m. Richard Bushnell, of Saybrook, in 1648. Their children were, Joseph, Richard, Mary, and Maria, all b. in Saybrook. She was m. the second time, in 1680, to Dea. Thomas Adgate, of Saybrook, and was his 2d wife. Their children were, Abigail, Sarah, Rebecca, and Thomasall b. in Norwich. Dea. Adgate was one of the original proprietors of Norwich, and d. at that place in 1707, at an advanced age.\n\nSarah Marvin daughter of Matthew, sen'r., m. William Goodrich, of Wethersfield, in Oct. 1648. Had sons, John, William, Ephraim, and David; and daughters, who m. Robert Wells, Thomas Fitch, Joseph Butler, and ----- Hollister-some of the best families.\n\nHannah Marvin daughter of Matthew, sen'r., m. Thomas Seymour, of Norwalk, in Jan. 1653, and had children, Hannah b. Dec. 12, 1654, who m. Francis Bushnell, Oct. 12, 1675; Abigail b. Jan. 1655; Mary and Sarah, twins, b. Sept. 1658; Thomas b. 1660; Marie b. Nov. 1666; Matthew b. May, 1669; Elizabeth b. Dec. 1673, and Rebecca b. Jan. 1675.\n\nAbigail Marvin daughter of Matthew, sen'r., m. John Bouton, of Norwalk, Jan. 1656, and had children, John, Matthew, Rachel, Abigail, and Mary. John, his son, had two sons, Jakin and Joseph-perhaps others.\n\nRachel Marvin daughter of Matthew, sen'r., m. Samuel Smith, of Norwalk, and had children, Rachel, who m. Thomas Benedict, and Lydia, who m. James Lockwood.\n\nThe descendants of the first and second Matthew Marvin, are very numerous; but owing to a defect in the early records, it is not easy to trace the descendants of any except those of John, who is supposed to be the Youngest son of the second Matthew. Samuel, son of the second Matthew, was probably the father of Matthew, (fourth of the name,) who was b. Oct. 1702, and who was the ancestor of Hon.
