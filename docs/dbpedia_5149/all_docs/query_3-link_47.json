        "text": "August 11, 1939 – July 30, 2024\n\nSamuel Lee McIntyre, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, passed away at his home surrounded by family on July 30, 2024, after a short but tough battle with cancer. He was 84 years old.\n\nBorn on August 11, 1939, in Craig, Colorado, to Richard H. McIntyre and Leona May McIntyre (Steele), Sam grew up in Maybell on the family ranch, where he learned the values of hard work and honesty that he carried throughout his life.\n\nOn November 17, 1958, Sam married Georgia Buffham. Together, they raised their five children on the ranch where Sam grew up, imparting the same values that defined his character.\n\nSam’s greatest joys in life were his grandchildren and riding the range, activities he continued until a few weeks before his passing. He felt closest to Jehovah while checking his cattle and riding, but he also found joy in attending the Kingdom Hall.\n\nSam is survived by his devoted wife Georgia; his children Sandy (Randy) Buckner, Chad (Silvi) McIntyre, Zander (Johnna) McIntyre, Danna (Mike) Camblin, and Chip (April) McIntyre; 14 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents and his brothers, Dick, John, Marvin, and Thomas.\n\nA proud supporter of youth in agriculture, Sam and Georgia raised their children through 4-H and FFA. He was one of the founding members of the Moffat County Jr. Livestock Sale Foundation, serving for over 40 years and making a lasting impact on the community.\n\nA memorial service to honor Sam’s life will be held on August 19, 2024, at 1:00 pm at the Moffat County Fairgrounds Pavilion, followed by a potluck dinner. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to the Moffat County Jr. Livestock Sale Foundation PO Box 1461 Craig, CO 81626.\n\nSam will be deeply missed by all who knew him, but his legacy of hard work, honesty, and love for family will continue to inspire those he leaves behind."
