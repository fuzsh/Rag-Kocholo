        "text": "John Marvin Harrison passed peacefully and with a smile on his face, at his home in Freeport, Florida, on January 11, 2020, at the age of 70. Born in Chipley Florida on July 31, 1949, he was preceded in death by father, John Martin Harrison, his mother Oletha Obert Harrison, and brothers, Joey Harrison, Jimmy Harrison, and Kenny Harrison. He is survived by his loving wife of 37 years, Betty Harrison; daughter and son-in-law, Tamara and Kevin Espey; their children, Ethan and Kian Espey; his son Patrick Harrison, and his four children, Olivia, Julian, Finleigh and Paislee. John was a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he earned several medals, including the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campain Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and 2 Purple Hearts, while serving as a grenadier under the 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Corps, Suicide Charley Company. He was a construction superintendent in Seaside and Rosemary Beach, FL, for over 20 years, and obtained his State of Florida Contractors license in 2006. John was a very kind, compassionate man, who went out of his way to help others in need, he would give you the shirt off his back, if you needed it. He loved animals, riding his motorcycle, vehicle restoration, the outdoors and spending time with the ones he loved.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of John Marvin Harrison, please visit our floral store."
