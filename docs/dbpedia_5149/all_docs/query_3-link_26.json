        "text": "After a FOIA request for videos and materials about the June 7, 2021, homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, we zeroed in on John Marvin Murdaugh, one of Alex’s brothers, and his account of what route he took to get to Moselle on the night of the murder.\n\nThe following map shows four different routes. Three of them are routes suggested by Google when you ask it for directions between John Marvin’s home in Okatie and Moselle. The fourth route is the route John Marvin claims he took that night. The fourth route, while it would not add significant time to the route, would have taken him right past Almeda. You can hear more about why this is significant in True Sunlight Season 3 Episode 32-FOIA Around and Find Out…New Videos Shed Light On Murdaugh Murders.\n\nTo see the different routes one by one, click the icon at the top left of the map to expand the control panel. From that panel, you can toggle layers on and off to see the different ways to get from Okatie to Moselle.\n\nNOTE: We adjusted the starting point of this map to protect John Marvin’s privacy. John Marvin has not been charged with anything and there have been no formal accusations made about his actions on the night of the murders.\n\nSLED interviewed Buster Murdaugh, Randy Murdaugh, and John Marvin Murdaugh on June 10, 2021 just three days after Maggie and Paul were murdered. However, Rogan Gibson Rogan was interviewed on June 8, 2021. You can watch the interviews below.\n\nAlong with the SLED interview videos, we also received the following documents:"
