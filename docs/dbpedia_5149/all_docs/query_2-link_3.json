He was not injured. Police said Moran had arrived at the home earlier to help Marvin care for their father.\n\nMoran died from her injuries Wednesday after being flown to Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pa.\n\nPolice said Marvin called 911 and waited for authorities. He was taken into custody without incident.\n\nMarvin is charged with second-degree murder and assault. He was taken to Steuben County Jail and is being held without bail. The incident remains under investigation."
