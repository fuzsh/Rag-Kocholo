        "text": "The Roanoke Island Colonists and Support Staff\n\nWho were the personnel associated with the Roanoke Island colonies? A few such as Cavendish, Drake, Grenville, Harriot, and Lane were significant enough to have been remembered for other reasons. Most have defied scholarly attempts at identification for centuries. Although current research holds significant promise for their ultimate identification, some of the investor, settlers, explorers and mariners remain mere names on a list.\n\nMost of the known names are listed here in alphabetical order with the date of their participation in one or more of the ventures, preparations, or relief efforts. The roster includes Arthure Barlowe'screcord of participants in the 1584 reconnaissance voyage; Ralph Lane's list of colonists who remained on Rooanoke Island for eleven months in 1585-1586; John White's list of settlers in the 1587 colony; the principal members of Sir Francis Drake's West Indian Voyage of 1585-1586 (which stopped over at Wococon, collected the settlers and returned to England); and a few of the participants in the 1585 Grenville expedition, the 1587 expedition and the 1588 and 1590 relief missions. In addition, all of the investors and assistants cited in the 1589 indenture and the 1587 Grant of Arms to the Cittie of Ralegh are included.\n\nThere are a few instances of identical names on the same and different lists. Duplications within a list have been noted. Some lists may have original name spellings, others have been anglicized. Recurrences among lists have been entered separately unless identification of the individual has been documented."
