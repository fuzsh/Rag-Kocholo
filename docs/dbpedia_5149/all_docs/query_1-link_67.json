Snowfield ~100 ft moderate angle, hard packed, below switchback at Pass on Kings side - requires trekking poles, potentially microspikes; Sequoia side - free of snow. From \"cpass\" to Junction Meadow - overgrown trails of white-thorn, sagebrush, manzanita - obscures trail below \"notch\".

Return route surpasses Muir Rock and crosses back to Road's End via bridge.\n\nWilderness Trails\n\nSEKI BIG LOOP (Copper Cr-Simpson Mdw/Dougherty Mdw-JMT-Colby-Avalanche)\n\n02/26/2024 - Trail very dry from Granite Pass to Simpson Meadow. Maybe water at Dougherty Meadow (known to dry out seasonally). From Simpson to JMT, very hot. Palisade Creek crossing - difficult in early season; maybe knee deep mid-season. Charlotte Lake Ranger: plenty of water!\n\nAvalanche Pass\n\n07/16/2024 - Approx. 80 downed trees, ranging from wrist size to 4 ft. diameter. Two large diameter trees span a switchback - impedes foot traffic. Trail disappears/hard to follow due to avalanche debris, downed trees, overgrowth, infrequent use.

This closure will remain in effect until campsites can be inspected and hazard trees removed.\n\nSouth Fork Kings River Bridge washed out along the Rae Lakes Loop\n\nThe South Fork Kings River Bridge above Paradise Valley washed out during the winter of 2016-2017. Construction of a replacement bridge has not begun.\n\nThese river crossings can be extremely hazardous. Observe conditions carefully and then evaluate the risk of crossing. Be prepared to turn back. If you hike the Rae Lakes Loop beginning from Bubbs Creek, plan for the possibility that you may have to backtrack to safely reach Cedar Grove.\n\nNote on Upper Paradise Campground - There are multiple trails in the campground area that tend to confuse hikers: one that leads north and three at the suspension bridge, including one that goes due east from there that is not the correct trail. Hikers doing the Rae Lakes Loop want to follow the trail that goes south (downstream) from the suspension bridge. This trail will soon shift to heading in an east/west direction.\n\nBubbs Creek (Rae Lakes Loop)\n\n6/25/2024 - Snow free, some downed trees on trail.\n\nGlen Pass (Rae Lakes Loop)\n\n07/16/2024 - South side snow free.

For experienced backpackers only. Instead of Harrison Pass, rangers recommend Millie's Foot Pass or Little Joe, both of which are snow free.\n\nShepherd Pass\n\n7/31/2024 - East Side/Forest Service side of Shephard Pass is snow free.
