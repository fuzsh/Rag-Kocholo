Perhaps our representatives can explain to us what the business of this meeting may be.\n\nI know it has been given out that we are called together to consider the new form of government, and that it is referred back to the people to say whether they will adopt it or reject it, but when I come to examine the act of assembly, you have no voice in the case. All our business, gentlemen, is to make choice of delegates to say whether you shall be made to submit to it or not, not whether you approve of it or not. That is not our business nor is it submitted to you.\n\nThe last Article of our federal Union says “The Articles of this Confederation shall be Inviolably Observed by every state and the Union shall be Perpetual, nor shall any Alteration at any time hereafter be made in Any of them, unless such Alteration be agreed to In [a] Congress of the United States, and be Afterwards Confirmed by the Legislature of Every State.” These Articles the people of these states have adopted and have sworn to support and maintain them, and by these Articles it was agreed that if any alteration was found necessary, Congress were first to agree to the alteration, and then afterwards that alteration was to have the sanction of the legislatures of every state. But now nine states shall bind all the rest to submission. But, gentlemen, this Convention has fobbed off our assemblies, just in the same manner as we are. It seems the Convention would not trust our assemblies to approve r reject their doings. They made us believe the assemblies had a right to judge of the matter, but, when all comes to all, our Assembly had no right to judge anything about it, but were permitted to order the towns to meet but not to judge or determine anything about the Constitution, but only to choose delegates for another convention in order to judge for you, not caring to trust either you or your representatives in our assemblies to judge in this matter. [The Convention] have left room for men of intrigue to get in such delegates elected for another convention as will answer their purposes, and the job will be done. This is the reason why, contrary to the Articles of Confederation, our assemblies might not be trusted to accept or reject this new Constitution, formed by our Convention, which without hesitation I openly declare and pronounce to be as dark, intricate, artful, crafty, and unintelligible [a] composition that I ever read or see composed by man; and, all the time, given to the people to consider of it to open their eyes or to be led into a right understanding of it by others. [But it] is not a fortnight from the rising of our Assembly to the time of choosing our delegates either to accept or reject it. This is another artful maneuver of our own domestic politicians thus to hurry on matters before the people have time to understand it so as to be able to make a judicious choice of delegates to act conformable to their own minds.\n\nThe State of Pennsylvania, where this scheme was first planned, immediately after the declaration of peace, have outdone us by far, and they even boast of it, and say “from the time the resolution of Congress was passed till its adoption by the State of Pennsylvania was only twenty hours. Such is the zeal of Pennsylvania to show her attachment to a vigorous, free, and wise frame of national government.” But, I must likewise tell you gentlemen, there were so many of that House that see through the whole scheme, and their unreasonable driving and pressing the matter before the people could have time to examine the new Constitution, that so many of the members withdrew from the House to prevent their hasty proceeding that there was not a quorum left so as to proceed upon business whereupon they procured some ruffians to go out and pick up so many of the members as to make a quorum, dragged them into the Assembly forcibly, and there forcibly held them until the rest passed upon the new Constitution by appointing the choice of delegates. This, gentlemen, might teach us, I should think, not to think very honorably either of this new Constitution or the rectitude of the Assembly of Pennsylvania. Our Assembly, it is true, did not proceed so violently, but those artful politicians so managed the matter that they have not left you a fortnight to weigh and consider of the most important affair that ever came before you. Doth it appear at all likely or probable, was there not some undue measure to be pursued, that such violent measure would be pursued by legislative bodies? You may perhaps, gentlemen, wonder what such men are driving at that. I will tell you gentlemen in plain English, and would the time admit, I can prove it. But this you all know. Congress have made a grant to the officers and army of a sum of money the annual interest of which sum is 99,000. The soldiers have been told the public securities given them were good for nothing, and they have sold them for 2 to 3 4 and 5/ on the*, and the present holders of those public securities thus purchased from the soldiers well know they can never prevail with our assemblies to pay them public securities tot the present possessors up to the nominal value. And the officers of the Army also well know that vote of Congress for their commutation was obtained by art and intrigue, by a pretended mutiny of the army just at the conclusion of the war, and then obtained by art and intrigue, be a pretended mutiny of the army just at the conclusion of the war, and then obtained in Congress but by a single vote, viz. of Colonel [Eliphalet] Dyer, which he immediately wrote up to our Assembly was extorted from him through fear. And they well know unless they alter our present for of government and convert it into a military government, they must and will finally lose their prize. Again, there are others who are promised to mount up higher in the saddle by promotion. All these combining have raised a mighty outcry of the weakness of the federal government, and they have continued it so long and so loud that many honest people are made to believe it. But, gentlemen, have not we the same power we ever have had; cannot every man recover his honest just dues. If any opposition is made to government, has not our sheriffs power to call to their assistance the militia to support him in the execution of his office, and is it not so in every state in the Union. Gentlemen, this outcry of the weakness of the federal government is only a specious pretense to cover the artful schemes of designing men who would recover their commutation securities and the notes purchased of the soldiers. And I know will make my objections to this new form of government planned out by this Convention.\n\nMy first objection is to the expense of it which at the same time doth not lessen our own, which must in fact crush the common people into the dust and reduce them to a state of vassalage and slavery. By the increase of the multiplicity of new offices and officers with such salaries as Congress gives them our ambassadors a salary of 11111 9/10 dollars per annum, exclusive of the expenses of their embassy, a large salary to their secretaries, 13000 dollars allowed to the President of Congress for to furnish his table, large salaries to the Secretary of War, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1900 dollars each to 13 commissioners such as Mr. [William] Imlay at Hartford whose whole business may be executed in a month, etc., etc. And if this new form of government is adopted, a vast retinue of revenue officers must be appointed who must have ample salaries for the Southern States, who have 3, 4, 5, and six hundred slaves of their own, have high notions of things, and can bet more on a horse race than the value of one of our little farms. And 7 of the Southern States have 41 [38] votes in Congress, while 6 of the Northern States have but 27, and the disproportion will increase so that they can forever outvote us and have just what officers they please and load us with just what taxes they please.\n\nAnd here gentlemen, I must acquaint you with what I presume you do not know that both our delegates in Congress voted against the Convention. I had it from Dr. [William Samuel] Johnson’s own mouth. He did not tell it to me in confidence, and therefore [I] speak of it openly, and he told me at the same time it would lay a foundation for a division in the Confederation.\n\nMy second objection is to the duplicity of the Articles themselves which are so artfully expressed and delegates greater power to Congress than by a common reader will readily be perceived, and seems to be artfully covered of design not to be understood. And I now will proceed to point out the passages severally.\n\nArticle 1. I shall consider section 1 and 8 together. My objections to them are our Congress is to consist but of 68 [65] members which will be of the higher class of people who know but little of the poverty, straits, and difficulties of the middling and lower class of men. I have ever thought we in this state had too many representatives, but I am now confirmed in my opinion that we have not. Every town and country, their true state and ability, ought to be known, especially in matters of taxation; and it is of great service likewise to guard against the intrigues of artful, crafty, and designing men, and even then they are not always discovered in their schemes, otherwise I am persuaded our Honorable Assembly would have given the people a little more time to have understood and considered of this new plan of government before we had been called together to choose our delegates.\n\nSection 2, 3 paragraph. My second objection. There is but three ways to proportion the taxes of the states justly and equitably. The first is according to the 8th Article of our federal Union, but that method cannot be done to satisfaction of the states. The second is by the number of souls in each state the riches and strength of a state is determined by the number of the inhabitants it is capable of supporting. And the third way is by the number of square miles within its territorial jurisdiction. This is not so just and equitable as the other two. Consequently, I shall say nothing but with regard to the second, the first not being practicable. Here I will not only remark upon the injustice of this paragraph, but the art used to conceal the true meaning from common readers. Three-fifths of all other persons. Why could they not have spoke out in plain terms Negroes? Were they afraid of affronting the Negroes, or were they ashamed to exempt 3/5 of them from taxation [–] by outvoting. And here the language is uncertain and doubtful also I cannot say by the rules of grammar whether they are to included or excluded from taxation. But why must our apprentices in the Northern States be all taxed and included in the capitation and 3/5ths of the Negroes in the Southern States be exempted, where it doth not cost their masters so much to keep 10 of them, as it doth here in one of our Northern States to keep one genteel [–] horse.\n\nI object also to the last paragraph of this section, to the small number of Representatives a mighty empire to have but 68 [65] Representatives to tax by duties, impost, excise, and direct taxation, and but 27 of them in the six Northern States, and to make laws for them likewise. I would ask you, gentlemen, whether you know of any 5 men in this state who should tell you they have a right to tax you as much as they please, to appropriate it as they please, and of the exorbitancy of their demands you have no constitutional liberty to judge. Not only to tax you by duties, impost, and excise but to levy direct taxes upon you, and these same five men also to make all laws respecting government of the state. And if you would think it impolitic to do it for this state separately, can you think it safe to trust it in the hands of five men when linked and fettered with 41 [38] Southern members who have no idea but that our day laborers may be treated just as they treat their African slaves.\n\nThe last clause of this paragraph limits the number of Representatives [to] 1 to 30 thousand. At present we are allowed 5, and there be 150 thousand inhabitants in this state to entitle us to five Representatives. So that when the number of our inhabitants are taken, after all our emigration to New York and Vermont, I suspect we shall not have more than 4 Representatives, if so many and can you think such a representation in Congress will be sufficient thus connected with and fettered with the Southern States, where they have such high notions; not only to tax us by duties, excises, and impost, but to make laws for us, when you see by their numbers they can force us to submit to 3 fifths of their slaves exempted. It seems to me, gentlemen, this alone might convince you of the impolicy of adopting this Constitution. While I am upon the subject of Negroes and the artful language they use to cover their meaning, I would object to the 9th section which is in these words: [Article 1,] section 9, [paragraph 1]. Why all this sly cunning and artful mode of expression unless to cover from your observation and notice that Negroes, was intended by the word persons, again used on this occasion, lest if should frighten people who may have some tender feelings and a just sense of the rights of human nature. What man, that has the feelings of a man, can once think it right to send our ships across the Atlantic to tear parents from their children, children from their parents, husbands from their wives, and wives from their husbands, stifle one-half of them in their crowded ships, and the remainder sell as we do our cattle to drag out the remainder of their lives in slavery, to be whipped and Iashed like horses, without being struck with horror and shudder at the deed? It might have been sufficient, one would have thought, not to have said anything about it in those articles of this blessed Constitution planed our for us by the Convention and hurried on to be established with as much precipitation as though the salvation of our soul depended upon our adopting it immediately. But it fills my mind with the highest resentment to read that they lay a restraint upon Congress that they shall not repractice of trading in bodies and souls of men for the space of 21 years yet to come. They need not have extended it to one-half of that time, if we adopt this system of government, of us will be slaves to all intents and purposes whatsoever without any trouble or expense of sending to Africa for slaves, for it is as perfect a system of slavery as I ever saw planned out by any nation, kingdom, or state whatever. For what have we been contending and shedding our blood and wasting our substance, but to support the natural rights of men. I am told our reverend clergy in general are much engaged to support in future preach and pray to the Africans that may be imported by virtue of this new Constitution. For my own part, any who vote for it, if I know them, will not offend my ears, neither with their prayers or preaching to the latest period of my life.\n\nMy next objection is to section 4-3 [Article I, section 4]. The plea has been, they wanted Congress to regulate trade, but it seems here again they make use of great art to disguise and conceal their meaning. They pretend to give us the right of election both of Senators and Representatives, and give our [state] representatives the right of elections of our Senators, but in section 4, which I have just now read to you, they tell us Congress may at any time alter both the time and manner, i.e., they may say none shall vote for Senators unless his annual income shall be worth 100 a year, and that when they may hold their seats during life.\n\nAgain under Article II, section 1 paragraph 3 they have another touch on election for they have been extremely careful to mix everything well that the reader might not have a full view of any one topic under one head, but they have so mixed and blended everything that it requires the greatest attention imaginable to comprehend all their meaning in its full extent and latitude.\n\nArticle II, section 1. Thus it is pretended as though we chose the President and Vice President or rather the King and his successor. But how do we choose them? Do our representatives in General Assembly choose them? No, by no means. That would not do. Article II, section 1. But our legislature must choose 7 Electors, i.e., as many Electors as we have Representatives and Senators, which for the present we are permitted to have 5 Representatives and 2 Senators so that after sifting the House we may perhaps get 7 men that may be trusted with the choice of a President or rather King, for the next 4 years, but if the election made by our representatives doth not happen to suit our Honorable Council, and they think he will not make pen to suit our Honorable Council, and they think he will not make a good Elector to choose a President for us or rather a King, they may negative the choice of our representatives, and if they cannot get those that will serve the turn, we must send a less number. To be short, all our pretended elections are so fettered and muzzled that I would as soon turn a copper for the choice as to pretend to elect, so that when we have once chose any officer, whether President or Senator, he is almost as much assured of being reelected, as though it was made hereditary. Indeed, I have rather have a hereditary King or President than an Elective King, as it will eternally embroil the states by schemers for the outs and ins, and lay the foundation of clamors, broils, and contentions that will end in blood.\n\nMy 4 objections is to [Article I,] section 6 [unto?] 7 paragraph and 2 Article [Article II, section 1, paragraph 7]. Congress never have informed the states what their civil list has been and I presume they never will and I have been told by a member of Congress, that is to say by one who has been a member of Congress, that I might never expect they will ever let us know. Indeed, Congress have as good as told us so in express terms. They have told us they have an absolute discretion to determine the quantum of revenue, of appropriating it when raised, and of the exorbitancy of their demands we have no constitutional liberty to judge. The fact is, gentlemen, they never have told us in full at any time what the annual expenses of the federal government is they never have told us what sums of money they have given away to individuals either as pensions or as presents, to show our grandeur and importance in our national character. Nor have they once told us what our quota of the public debt is, that we might fund it and make provision to pay the interest annually till the debt can be paid. They have told us that, by all we have paid, we never have lessened our foreign debt nor paid the interest of it, and they have further told us that what we do pay doth not pay the annual expenses of the federal government.\n\nThey tell us, it is true ([Article I], section 9, last paragraph but one), no money shall be drawn from the public treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law, and that expenditures shall be published from time to time. So they told us they would transmit to each state every half year all [the?] money they borrowed or emitted. Did they ever do it? I answer, no, they never did it once, not is it probable they ever will, and if you murmur or complain when you have taken the militia our of the hands of the governors, placed them under the President of Congress, and converted them into a standing army, and they can call them forth at any time either to subdue Wabash Indians or quell insurgents as they please, you may murmur, complain, or call for the public accounts as you will, you may as well content yourselves without complaining. Power once given up out of your hands never was given back again nor never was recovered back without shedding of blood. But, gentlemen, if you think you can pay such taxes to support this new federal government when it will not lessen the expenses of our own [state] government a single copper, I am content. I promise you as a Christian, when it is once established I will not resist the powers that be, nor will I recommend it to you therefore, by a friend and as Christian, to be very careful what powers you give up and very obedient when you have done it. This shall be the line of my own conduct.\n\nMy next or 5 objection is to the regulation of the militia and taking them from under the command of the several governors and converting into a standing army which is contained in these paragraphs:5 5 5 [Article I, section 8, paragraphs 15 and 16, and Article II, section 2, paragraph 1]. Upon this head I would only observe to you mankind, vile as they be, see the necessity of civil government and will submit to all reasonable laws and all reasonable demands of taxes to support that government, and whenever there are any stubborn refractory mortals that will not submit to civil government there are always men enough, when properly called upon, to support the civil magistrate in the execution of laws. But if the laws are oppressive and arbitrary, the public demands above the ability of the people to pay, they will eternally kick. You may depend upon it in a country governed by a standing army who carry with them the instruments of death if they are governed at all. But to take the militia of the state out of the command and from under the direction of our governors, place them under the President of Congress, which reduces our governors to the quality of drill sergeants only to discipline our militia, and fit them for the President of Congress to subdue either Wabash Indians or quell insurgents in the County of Hampshire true, it may save the states of the expense and trouble of declaring war against the Wabash Indians [and] in [the] future in these Northern States, when our militia, trained and well disciplined, will be ready to execute their commands. A mild government, gentlemen, wants no military force to support it, and an arbitrary and oppressive government doth not deserve it.\n\nMy 6th objection is to the 9 paragraph in the 8 section under the 1 Article and unto 1 section in the 3 Article, for I must skip about to look them up were they have scattered them in order to render them more mysterious and unintelligible, which should have been connected together if they intended they should be understood. 6 6 [Article I, section 8, paragraph 9 and Article III, section 1]. Here they tell us of a Supreme Court to be erected somewhere, but they don’t tell us where and that they shall have a compensation for their services, but they don’t tell us how much and that they shall hold their seats during good behavior, by that I understand as long as they live or, at most, until some fitter tool to serve their purposes shall appear to oust them and that their salaries shall not be diminished and that Congress shall have power to erect inferior tribunals under the Supreme Court of their appointment. Now, gentlemen, the designs of thse paragraphs is that these courts appointed by this newfangled Congress shall eat up our courts, of which our representatives have now the right of appointing the judges annually and if it would eat up all the lawyers likewise, if they would expunge that paragraph of the Negroes, I should be tempted to vote for all the remainder. If we cannot by this Constitution eat up the lawyers, they will soon eat us up.\n\nI will now, gentlemen, finish my objections by my 7th and last objection, although I could spin them our with great propriety to 20 or 30 more, which is to the 2 paragraph of the 3 section under the 4 Article. 7[Article IV, section 3, paragraph 2]. I have reserved this for the last, as it is the butt cut for art and intrigue. Now, gentlemen, is there one in 40 of you that would judge this paragraph was a complete deed and absolute grant of all our western territory. They have taken care that we do enable them, if we adopt this new Constitution, that we resign into the hands of Congress the impost, excise, duties, and a power to tax us for as much more as they want, and to make all necessary laws to regulate them matters, to appoint their supreme and inferior courts, to eat up ours, and we take our militia out of the hands of our governors, reducing our governors into the quality of drill sergeants, [and] convert our militia into a standing army.\n\nBenjamin Gale to William Samuel Johnson\n\nKillingworth, 13 November (excerpt)\n\nWe yesterday met to choose delegates. There was about 150 voters present, and we chose 2 delegates to meet in Convention. One was chose by 14 votes and the other had 13. All the others would not vote at all and are really against it, but you gentlemen of the [Constitutional] Convention have fobbed off our Assembly and the people nicely.\n\nLebanon\n\n{12 November} At a meeting of the inhabitants of the town of Lebanon warned by the selectmen, to be holden at the usual place, on Monday the 12th of instant November at 1 o’clock, P.M. to choose delegates to meet in Convention at Hartford on the 1st Thursday of January next, to take into consideration the late report of the Continental Convention, agreeable to a recommendation of the General Assembly of this state at their session in October last, and do any other business proper to be done at said meeting. Warning dated 1st November 1787.\n\nBeing met on said Monday, the 12th of November 1787, accordingly, they made choice of Wm. Williams, Esquire, moderator.\n\nThe act of the General Assembly, recommending the choosing such delegates, and appointing the day to ch[o]se them, or the same number as they have right to choose for representatives, etc. was read, and then, on motion.\n\nThe Constitution, agreed on, reported, and recommended by the late Convention of delegates from all the United States (Rhode Island excepted) held in Philadelphia, the last summer, for the purpose [of[ revising, amending, etc. the Confederation, and which is to be subject of the consideration, for adoption or not, of the proposed Convention at Hartford, etc., together with the letter of the Philadelphia Convention, accompanying the same, to Congress, and the act of Congress recommending the same to be laid before the legislatures of the states, were distinctly and audibly read in this meeting.\n\nAnd after observations on the propriety of proceeding at this time, it was on the question voted that they will now proceed to the choice of two delegates to attend the Convention at Hartford.\n\nAnd thereupon the ballots being given in, it appeared Colonel Wm. Williams, Esquire was chosen first delegate for the purpose; and the ballots being called and taken for the other, and being sorted and counted, no choice was made. And then being called and given in again, and sorted and counted, it appeared Captain Epm Carpenter was chosen.\n\nSeveral motions were then made, relative to the town’s showing their sentiments, as to their approbation and adoption of the proposed Constitution or not, and as to instructing their delegates, adjourning the meeting, etc. Objections were made, etc.\n\nAnd a question agreed to, was put in whether the town are now ready and prepared to show their minds on the merits and approbation or disapprobation of the new proposed Constitution. And on a division of the house, a majority were in the affirmative, but a large number appearing in the negative, the motion for proceeding to act on it at this time was waived and given up.\n\nAnd on further motion, the question was put whether this meeting should be adjourned to Wednesday the 21st day of November instant at 1 o’clock, P.M. at this place with a view then and there to show their minds, as to approving or not the said Constitution and to instruct their delegates, if they think proper. And was voted in the affirmative and the moderator dissolved said meeting to be adjourned accordingly.\n\n{Recorded?} per Wm Williams, Town Clerk\n\n{21 November} At an adjourned town meeting, holden as per adjournment last before entered, holden at the meeting house in 1st Society Wednesday, 21 November 1787 (a very rainy day).\n\nBeing met, etc. on motion the new proposed Constitution was (again) distinctly read; and it was moved that some printed pieces, against and in favor of said Constitution, should be read, but the motions were waived and withdrawn.\n\nIt was then moved to try the question whether they give instructions to their delegates chosen at the last meeting relating to said Constitution. The motion in giving any instructions was objected to and urged pro and con. And the question being put was resolved in the affirmative (14 con, the rest for it).\n\nThen moved that the minds of the town be tried whether they approve said Constitution, and agreed that it should be tried by years and nays. And being tried in that way, they resolved and voted that they do not approve said Constitution.\n\nYeas were 13. Nays were 49.\n\nThey then on motion voted to choose a committee to prepare and draw instructions for their delegates relative to the same, to be laid before the town at the time to which this meeting shall be adjourned.\n\nAnd thereupon they made choice of Messrs. Elka [Elkana] Tisdale, Esquire, Captain Danl. Tilden, Dr. Those. Williams, Mr. Oliv. Huntington, Captiain [Nath.?] Williams, Colonel [Jon.?] Mason, Captain Danl. Dunham, Mr. Silus Clark, and Major Elijah Hyde a committee for that purpose.\n\nAnd then on motion voted that this meeting shall be adjourned to the day of holding the annual town meeting in December next, to hear and consider said instructions. And the moderator declared it to be adjourned accordingly.\n\n{10 December} At an adjourned town meeting on the day of the annual town meeting from the 12th November 1787 and adjourned to 21st.

Thursday of January next, etc.\n\nWm. Williams, moderator.\n\nIt was moved that considering the last meeting was holden on a stormy day, and but few attended, that the question for approving or disapproving the new proposed Federal Constitution might be reconsidered and tried again. Which motion was agreed to, all professing to give so important a question the most candid consideration. And to thereupon they voted to reconsider the vote passed at the last meeting disapproving said Constitution.\n\nAnd the question was again considered and was argued pro and con; and the question being called for, and to be tried as before by yeas and nays, and being taken, there appeared to be forty-one in favor of and eighty-one against approving the said Constitution, and was declared in the negative, accordingly, by the moderator.\n\nThen the instructions, prepared by the committee appointed at the last meeting, were called for, laid in and twice distinctly read and considered.\n\nThe question was put whether the town do approve and pass the said draft as their instruction to their delegates appointed to attend the state Convention at Hartford, 1st Thursday of January next, and\n\nAnd the meeting voted and was declared to be dismissed.\n\nLisbon\n\n{12 November} At a town meeting legally warned and holden in Newent Society to choose a delegate by ballot to meet in Convention at Hartford the first Thursday of January next pursuant to a late act of assembly.

It is our arden wish that an efficient government may be established over these states so constructed that the people may retain all liberties, privileges, and immunities usual and necessary for citizens of a free country and yet sufficient provision made for carrying into execution all the powers vested in government. WE are willing to give up such a share of our rights as to enable government to support, defend, and preserve the rest. It is difficult to draw the line. All we agree that the people should retain so much power that if venality and corruption should prevail in our public councils and government should be perverted and not answer the end of its institution, viz., the well being of society and the good of the whole, in that care the people may resume their rights and put an end to the wantonness of power. In whatever government the people neglect to retain so much power in their hands as to be a check to their rulers, depravity and the love of power is so prevalent in the humane mind, even of the best of men, that tyranny and cruelty will inevitably take place, and the people will be undeceived too late. We agree that the people of these states have no energetic common compact or national existence strictly speaking, and in that respect they are as a number of individuals nearly in a state of natural liberty, and we believe it would be for the benefit of the people that a system of government should take place that we may enjoy national advantages and assume some national importance; but individuals should move with caution in giving up their individual and natural rights to society. Tis much easier to give more power into the hands of the government when more is necessary than to recover back where to much is already given. The want of attention to these maxims has enslaved almost all the nations of the world. When we view the compact or Constitution proposed to these states, we have the following objections to its acceptance without alteration, viz.:\n\n1st. The unfrequent elections, the smallness of the representation, and the long continuance of power in the senatorial body after having been elected by a sort of secondary delegates and ultimately the power of election lodged in very few hands.\n\n2nd. We object to the power of direct taxation without limitation or restraint being lodged in Congress, unless, upon trial, it should be found that the other resources about to be given to the legislative should be found inadequate to the exigencies of government. We do apprehend that the disposition of the avails of all the unappropriated territories of the United States, and having ample power for the regulation of trade, levying imposts, excises, and all kinds of duties on luxuries, etc. will be sufficient means in the hands of government for discharge [ing] the debts and supporting the dignity of the Union. If on trial we should find ourselves mistaken in this particular, it will be time enough in future to grant such further aid as shall be found necessary. We have not forgot the wormwood and the gall of an eighty-years severe and bloody war and all to defend our liberties and retain some pittance of property in [our?] hands that we might call our own, and now after every other means of revenue is [lodged?] in the hands of the federal government that those who are nigh and also those very distant from the seat of government should indiscriminately have their polls and freehold taxed also without having proper intelligence of the necessity of the tax, we fear would alienate the minds of the people from their system of government. It would render the sever assemblies of the different states and also their executives of little or no consequence, and leave as utterly without means of discharging the enormous load of debt incurred in the late war as individual states, and also destitute of resources for supplying government in our separate political existence.\n\n3rd. We object to the mode of appointing the judges of the Supreme and other judicial courts so far as respects the duration of their appointment. Their continuance in office pursuant to their appointment ought, in our opinion, to be periodical and new appointments ought to take place as often as the new elections of the representative body of the legislative. Any longer term of holding the judicial powers are inconsistent in a free country.\n\n4th. We find by the provisions [of the] fifth Article in the proposed Constitution that by a proposal of the legislative of the federal government, passed by two-thirds of that body, three-quarters of the separate state legislature are enable [d] to make any alterations in the Constitution. To all intents and purposes this power thus vested enables the several legislators to change the form of government at pleasure without ever consulting the people. We ever supposed legislative bodies chosen for the purpose of making laws and not for the purpose of altering the original compact of the people. Neither can they transfer the power of making laws to any other persons whatever.\n\n5th. We observe that the right of trial by jury in civil causes is not secured in the federal courts. This is repugnant to the custom handed down from our ancestors and always set easy on the people and esteemed as a privilege.\n\nThese, gentlemen, are our sentiments, and these are our objections. If you find, when your join the Convention at Hartford on the matters which turn up in view, that there is a prospect of ratification of the Constitution proposes with some of the most material alterations here mentioned, we willingly would give our assen on them conditions. If there be no prospect of any alterations, but it must be accepted or rejected as it now stands, we trust from your candor you will peruse these our sentiments with deliberations, and we doubt not you will give your assent or dissent as you shall really think will terminate for the best good of the people of these states.\n\nThe question was put whether this meeting will do anything at this time respecting a division of this town. Voted in the negative.\n\nVoted that this meeting be adjourned without day.\n\nEntered by, Daniel Morgan, Jr., Town Clerk\n\nRidgefield\n\n{12 November} At a town meeting held in Ridgefield on the 12th day of November A.D. 1787 agreeable to and in pursuance of a resolve and recommendation of the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut, for the purpose of choosing delegates to meet at Hartford on the first Thursday of January next, for the purposes of adopting or rejecting the Constitution proposed by the Convention and recommended by the Congress of the United States.\n\nMr. Timothy Keeler was chosen moderator of said meeting.\n\nColonel Phillip B.

And after deliberating on the subject, it was voted by said meeting that it was the sense and opinion of the same that to adopt said proposed Constitution would institute and erect and aristocracy which they fear would end in despotism and tyranny and extinguish or nearly absorb our ancient charter privileges ever sacred and dear to us, and that instead of lessening our taxes and burdens, it would greatly increase and augment them and finally prove destructive of our most invaluable liberties and privileges.

I observed the outlines of the declamation you read. I chained down the attention of numerous audience for upwards of three-quarters of an hour. Silas Hubble [Hubbell], at the beginning of the debate, made a motion “that as I had been much with you, I should be requested to deliver my sentiments of the Constitution.” The proposition was laughed at and rejected. I was then determined I would speak. Major [Joseph] Walked held me by the arm, said I should ruin everything. I stayed till the moderator called for the votes. I then broke from him, jumped over the seats, mounted the pulpit stairs, and succeeded beyond by expectations, equal to my wishes. I closed with “launching and empire on the sea of glory” amidst a general clap of applause. Everyone shook me by the hand, told me I was an honor to Stratford, to myself, I merited my name. I went to hand in my vote. The moderator, Major [Agur] Judson, rose from his seat, shook me by the hand, said “he publicly thanked me for the information and pleasure I had given I was an honor to Stratford.” The selectmen unitedly requested I would [preserve?] the chain of my arguments that they might print [them]; it was a pity they should be lost after making such an impression. Can I not, sir, as I have once deluded them by declamation and rounded periods, again further deceive them and make an impression upon others. I have already told them I could only give them the sense of the speech. Can I not now, by writing the outlines of declamation and by close logical reasons intermingled, submit it to men of sense and confirm my reputation? I have the strongest prepossession in my favor and have only to exert my abilities to give a shading to the picture to bear the test of examination.\n\nTuesday morning [13 November].\n\nSir, please to write me as soon as convenient as the selectmen have already called on me for a copy of my speech. I am very sensible of its weakness as delivered; but cannot I give it the heightening of reasoning? You, sir, and Esquire [Elisha] Mills are chosen. I should certainly have been elected had not everyone been persuaded from my information that you would attend. Esquire [Daniel] Bennet and myself were exactly balanced, and had I had intriguing on my side, should have carried it against Esquire Mills. Forgive, sir, this effusion of vanity. I am sensible it will not bear examination. The speech neither deserved it, and I ought not therefore to be elated with the applause of the mob, but permit me to give indulgence to my feelings for a moment, and I flatter myself that it will tend only to increase my application, that if possible I may not be undeserving of the excellent education you have given me.\n\nSuffield\n\n{12 November} At a town meeting legally warned and convened at Suffield on the 2d Monday in November 1787, for the purpose of appointing delegates to attend the Convention at Hartford on the first Thursday in January next, to ratify or not the new Constitution recommended by the late Convention of the United States.\n\nMajor Elihu Kent appointed moderator.\n\nThe meeting adjourned to next Monday at 9 clock forenoon.\n\n{19 November} 3d Monday in November 1787.

Yesterday members for a state Convention were appointed. It was a day “big with the fate of Cato and of Rome.” There will be powerful oppositions to it in Connecticut. But the struggles against it in Virginia and Pennsylvania are violent. The Southern papers are red hot; nothing is said on either side but “Firebrands, Arrows, and Death.” I am alarmed at the consequence of its being either received or rejected; the majority will not be sufficiently large on either side for a subject of such vast consequence. The members of state Convention in Litchfield are avowedly in favor of it. The yeas and nays in several adjacent towns were taken, and a great majority against it, and member appointed accordingly. In short we are much divided; anarchy, I am afraid, is approaching. But why should we be anxiously troubled? “Whatever is is right.” What would it avail us if we knew what our situation would be; it could neither alleviate nor mitigate our sufferings. The most influential characters in New York are against the Constitution.\n\nJonathan Trumbull, Jr. to Jeremiah Wadsworth Lebanon, 17 November (excerpt).\n\nI thank you for the information in you last.
