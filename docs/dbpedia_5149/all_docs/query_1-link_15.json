        "text": "A house RESOLUTION\n\nTO EXPRESS THE PROFOUND SORROW OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UPON THE PASSING OF Marvin Campbell Stewart OF ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, AND TO EXTEND THEIR DEEPEST SYMPATHY TO HIS LARGE AND LOVING FAMILY AND HIS MANY FRIENDS.\n\nWhereas, the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives were saddened to learn of the death of Marvin Campbell Stewart at the age of eighty-seven on February 2, 2023, and after a twenty-eight-year battle with cancer, he has been healed in the presence of his Heavenly Father; and\n\nWhereas, born in Clinton on April 30, 1935, he was the eldest son of Marvin Cunningham and Vallie Campbell Stewart of Clinton, and he was reared in their loving home with his brothers; and\n\nWhereas, his first job was selling newspapers as a paper boy, and he often sold them on the train to passengers who made their way through Clinton in the 1940s, which began his love for trains that led him to work as a telegraph operator with the Seaboard Railroad after high school. During high school, he worked as a meat cutter at James Wilson's grocery store in Clinton, and later he spent many years as a market manager with Colonial Stores in Spartanburg and in Asheville; and\n\nWhereas, in the proud tradition of the sons of the Carolinas, Mr. Stewart served his country with distinction as a citizen/soldier with the South Carolina National Guard and North Carolina National Guard and was called to high-alert duty during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a member and range officer of the Asheville Rifle and Pistol Club and the West Asheville Civitans; and\n\nWhereas, Mr. Stewart spent most of his career as a sales representative for Greenwood Packing Company selling Carolina Pride meat products to Ingles' stores and to restaurants throughout North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia, for which he received many top sales awards; and\n\nWhereas, with a love for precision woodworking and tool making, he decided to pursue a degree from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Institute as a machinist and tool-and-die maker, after which he worked for seven years at Skyland Tool and Mold until his cancer diagnosis at age fifty-nine; and\n\nWhereas, a faithful member of West Asheville Presbyterian Church for over sixty years, Mr. Stewart served the congregation as a deacon, a ruling Elder, Clerk of the Session, and adult Sunday school teacher. He also was a member of the West Asheville Men's Prayer Breakfast; and\n\nWhereas, together with his beloved wife of sixty-five years, Margie Hudson Stewart, he reared two fine children, Valerie Stewart Jones of Laurens and John Marvin Stewart of Alexander, North Carolina. His children blessed him with the affection of six loving grandchildren who called him GranDink: Stewart Jones, Emilie Jones, Elliott Jones, Mary Elise Jones, Katie Green, and Andrew Stewart; and\n\nWhereas, he loved fishing and spending time with his grandchildren; camping at Shining Rock wilderness area with his son and nephews; cooking huge barbecues in his custom-designed homemade barbecue grill; making homemade fishing lures; and traveling to National Parks, railroad museums, and Revolutionary War historical sites. He was grateful to see the continuation of his loving and godly family legacy in his great-grandchildren: Lillie Ann and Emma Grace Jones, and Emma Leona Jason and Daxton Campbell Jones; and\n\nWhereas, the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives are grateful for the life and legacy of Marvin Stewart and for the godly example he set for all who knew him. Now, therefore,\n\nBe it resolved by the House of Representatives:\n\nThat the members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, by this resolution, express their profound sorrow upon the passing of Marvin Campbell Stewart of Asheville, North Carolina, and extend their deepest sympathy to his large and loving family and his many friends.\n\nBe it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be presented to the family of Marvin Campbell Stewart.\n\n----XX----"
