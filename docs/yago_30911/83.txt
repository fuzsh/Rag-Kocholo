The wedding dress was made from 19th Century-inspired Calais lace with floral motifs in French embroidery and lined with ivory rope-woven silk taffeta from the Buche silk weaving mill in the Loire Valley.

Queen Margrethe provided the tiara, which had been a gift from her parents, King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid, which held the veil in place.

The tulle veil was edged with lace and Ms Cavallier wore diamond earrings from Geneva

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, Princess Märtha Louise, and her former husband, Ari Behn from Norway and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden were among the many guests at the wedding.
