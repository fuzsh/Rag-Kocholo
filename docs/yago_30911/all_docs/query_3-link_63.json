        "text": "Denmark's Prince Joachim, the sixth in line to the Danish throne, will be moving to America with his wife, Princess Marie (47), and their children, son Henrik (13) and daughter Athena (11).\n\nThe prince, whose children were stripped of their royal titles last year, will be working as his country's defence industry attaché at the Danish embassy in Washington, DC.\n\nHis older children, sons Nikolai (23) and Felix (20), from his previous marriage to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, will not be joining them.\n\nIn his new role his job is to “help strengthen the defence industry cooperation with the USA and Canada”.\n\nThe 53-year-old spent the past four years in France, also as his country's defence attaché, with his family, and training with the country’s military. His military experience dates back to 1987 when he joined the Danish Armed Forces.\n\n“I’m proud that I still get the opportunity to represent Denmark internationally in the area of security and defence,” he says. “Transatlantic cooperation is a high-priority area, and I’m honoured that they have found me qualified for the task.”\n\nHis appointment comes six months after Queen Margrethe II (82) stripped all his children of their royal titles as princes and princesses.\n\nThe long-serving monarch says she did this because she wanted to enable her grandchildren to live a normal life, away from the politics that come with being a member of the royal family.\n\nThis decision caused a rift between the prince and the royal house.\n\n“We're all very sad. It's never fun to see your children being harmed,” he said in an interview. “They’ve been put in a situation that they don’t understand.”\n\nThe monarch later apologised for the misunderstanding, but did not change her decision.\n\nREAD MORE| Denmark's Queen Margrethe II sticks to her guns and strips her grandchildren of their titles\n\n\"No one should be in doubt that my children, daughters-in-law and grandchildren are my great joy and pride,” she said in a statement.\n\n“I now hope that we as a family can find the peace to find our way through this situation.”"
