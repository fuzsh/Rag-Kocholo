        "text": "Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, RE, (born Alexandra Christina Manley; 30 June 1964) is the former wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger brother of Frederik X of Denmark.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlexandra Christina Manley was born on 30 June 1964 in Hong Kong. She is the eldest of three daughters of Richard Manley and Christa Nowotny Manley. Her father was an insurance company executive, and her mother was the manager of a communications company. She is of English, Chinese, Czech, and Austrian ancestry.\n\nShe was baptized at the Cathedral of Saint John, Hong Kong.\n\nEducation\n\nAlexandra attended Quarry Bay Junior School from 1969 to 1971, Glenealy School from 1971 to 1974, and Island School from 1974 to 1982, all in Hong Kong.\n\nShe studied international business at the Vienna University of Economics and Business in Austria, and went to Japan and England for additional studies.\n\nAlexandra speaks English, German, and Danish.\n\nCareer\n\nFrom 1990 to 1995, Alexandra was employed by GT Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. She worked in sales and marketing until 1993 when she became a deputy chief executive of that department.\n\nIn 2007, she joined the Danish board of directors of Ferring Pharmaceuticals.[1] She serves a non-executive board member and also heads the ethics committee.\n\nIn 2017, Alexandra was named Poling Chair of Business and Government at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business for that upcoming academic year.[2] According to the IU press release regarding the announcement, she was to \"...stimulate discussion in the areas of leadership, the critical interactions between private business and government in matters of public policy, enterprise competitiveness and economic growth.\" She made periodic trips to the school, participating in panel discussions and interacting with students and faculty.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFirst Marriage\n\nCourtship & Engagement\n\nMain article: Engagement of Prince Joachim of Denmark and Alexandra Manley\n\nAlexandra met Prince Joachim of Denmark at a party in Hong Kong, where he was working for a Danish shipping company.\n\nAfter a whirlwind courtship that was thought to have begun in late 1994, Joachim proposed to Alexandra while the couple vacationed together in the Philippines. Their engagement, which took both Alexandra's family and Danish royal watchers by surprise, was officially announced in May 1995.\n\nWedding\n\nMain article: Wedding of Prince Joachim of Denmark and Alexandra Manley\n\nAlexandra and Joachim were married on 18 November 1995 in the chapel of Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød, Denmark. The wedding festivities were held at Fredensborg Palace. Alexandra's gown was designed by Jørgen Bender and she wore the Alexandrine Diamond Drop Tiara, a wedding gift from Margrethe II.\n\nIn connection with the marriage, Alexandra gave up her career in marketing, and it is believed that she renounced her British citizenship prior to becoming a Danish citizen.\n\nChildren\n\nAlexandra and Joachim have two children.\n\nCount Nikolai of Monpezat, born 8 August 1999\n\nCount Felix of Monpezat, born 22 July 2002\n\nDivorce\n\nBy mid-2004, rumors were circulating throughout Denmark and neighboring countries that the couple's marriage was in trouble. On 16 September 2004, Alexandra and Joachim announced their separation and eventual intention to divorce, the first in the royal family since 1846. On 8 April 2005, their divorce was finalized, with the two sharing joint custody of their sons. Alexandra remained a \"Princess of Denmark\", but assumed the lesser style of Her Highness. She was also granted the additional title \"Countess of Frederiksborg\" by Margrethe II on 16 April 2005.\n\nThe Danish Parliament put Alexandra on the civil list for life, independent of any future remarriage. Her payments of her new yearly allowance of 2.1m kroner ($330,000) started retroactively from 1 October 2004. On 23 June 2017, Alexandra announced that she would waive her annual allowance from the Danish civil list in July 2020, coinciding with the 18th birthday of Count Felix. She continues to receive a significantly smaller sum, similar to a civil service pension.[3]\n\nSecond Marriage\n\nCourtship & Engagement\n\nAs early as mid-2005, there were reports and pictures of Alexandra with Martin Jørgensen, the son of Jacob Jørgensen, a well-known film producer whose company produces numerous documentaries in which the Danish royal family has participated.\n\nWedding\n\nMain article: Wedding of Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, and Martin Jørgensen\n\nThe couple married on 3 March 2007 in a private ceremony at Øster Egede Church near Fakse, Denmark. Alexandra was walked down the aisle by her two sons. No other members of the royal family attended the ceremony. As a result of her remarriage, Alexandra lost the royal style of Her Highness and title of \"Princess of Denmark.\" She also ceased to be a member of the Danish royal family.\n\nDivorce\n\nIn September 2015, it was announced that Alexandra and Martin were divorcing.[4] She cited differences in values as the reason for the divorce, which was finalized in 2015.\n\nPublic Life\n\nAlexandra quickly became popular with the Danish people. Known for her fashion sense and charity work, she was dubbed the \"Diana of the North.\" Her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish language quickly and within a few months, she spoke it nearly without an accent, further endearing her to the Danes. In an interview, she spoke about her experience learning the language, saying,\n\n\"It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something. It would have been utterly wrong. This is my home, and so there was no other option.\"\n\nBoth during and after her marriage, Alexandra was involved in numerous philanthropic pursuits, including the Youth Red Cross, the Danish Society for the Blind, UNICEF, and single mothers' advocacy group, Mother Help. She also served as a UNICEF ambassador when she travelled to Thailand to visit HIV/AIDS patients.\n\nAlexandra still occasionally attends events with her former husband and the rest of the Danish royal family.\n\nActivities\n\nTitles, Styles, Honors, & Arms\n\nTitles & Styles\n\n30 June 1964 - 18 November 1995: Miss Alexandra Christina Manley\n\n18 November 1995 - 8 April 2005: Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Denmark\n\n8 April 2005 - 16 April 2005: Her Highness Princess Alexandra of Denmark\n\n16 April 2005 - 3 March 2007: Her Highness Princess Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg\n\n3 March 2007 - present: Her Excellency Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg\n\nHonors\n\nCoat of Arms"
