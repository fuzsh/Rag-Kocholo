        "text": "They are getting divorced!!!\n\nMargrethe and Henrik are sorry, but they are sure that it'll be figured out with the kids and so. Joachim lives at Schakenborg and Alexandra at Amalienborg with the 2 boys!\n\nShe will be Her Highness Alexandra, not princess.....\n\nThey've said that they've agreed about it and will share the kids. They both want to continue with their duties, with organisations and so, and hopes that they'll be supported in their decisions!\n\nThey can't say what the main reasons are, but they still hope that the people and press will accept it!\n\nI saw this news at of all places, Imagine Scandinavia which has lots of photos of the couple's relationship and wedding and their kids. I was actually quite shocked to read this.\n\nIt seems to me to be a major bit of news ... or is that just me? It seemed that divorce was so rare in most other royal families other than the British and Monaco royal families.\n\nBut I guess marital relations must've been at such a crisis point that Margrethe would allow her son and daughter-in-law to divorce. Not to stir up trouble, but I wonder if the couple have wanted to divorce for some time but the Queen asked them to wait until after Frederik and Mary had been married for a few months and settled into their new life for a bit.\n\nI guess sometimes there is truth to be found in those tabloid stories ... unfortunately.\n\nHere's a translation of the statement. I'm sorry if someone's already made links or posted a translation and I hope it makes sense.\n\nThe Royal Family announces:\n\nTheir Royal Highnesses Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra, AMALIENBORG, September 16th 2004.\n\nHer Majersty the Queen and his Royal Highness the Prince have instructed the Lord Chamberlain to announce that their Royal Highnesses Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra have decided to separate with the intention to seek divorce.\n\nIt is with deep regret that the Queen and the Prince have accepted this decision. At the same time the Queen and the Prince will give their full support to Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra in the difficult time that lie ahead. The Queen and the Prince wish to take part in finding a worthy solution for their son and daughter-in-law and that the children Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix will be ensured safe conditions.\n\nThere's an agreement between Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra about the decision and the conditions regarding the separation.\n\nPrince Joachim will be living at Schackenborg. For now Princess Alexandra will be staying in the couple's apartment at Amalienborg with Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix. During the time they will be separated Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra will keep her current title and after the divorce she will be addressed Her Highness Alexandra.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Alexandra state:\n\n\"After many and hard considerations we have with mutual understanding decided to separate with the intention to seek divorce. There's an agreement between us about the conditions for the separation and together we will maintain custody of our children.\n\nWe each wish as far as possible to maintain our assignments including to take on official duties and continue the work with the organizations we are connected to. We have always experienced a great kindness and friendliness everywhere and we hope people will understand this difficult decision we've made\".\n\nOle Ullerup, Lord Chamberlain.\n\nPrincess Alexandra and Prince Joachim to Divorce\n\nvery saddening news\n\nhttp://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2004/09/16/alexandradenmark/\n\nThe Royal Court has scheduled a press conference for 11.30 this morning, and is expected to announce the separation of Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra The Royal Court has scheduled a press conference at The Yellow Palace at Amalienborg at 11.30. DR's Radioavisen has reported that the court plans to announce the separation of Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra.\n\nThe Copenhagen Post is following this story as it develops.\n\nThe Royal Court has scheduled a press conference for 11.30 this morning, and is expected to announce the separation of Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra The Royal Court has scheduled a press conference at The Yellow Palace at Amalienborg at 11.30. DR's Radioavisen has reported that the court plans to announce the separation of Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra.\n\nThe Copenhagen Post is following this story as it develops.\n\nanother news\n\nhttp://www.jp.dk/\n\nSad news indeed...\n\nIt is now official:\n\nThe Danish royal house confirmed on Thursday that Prince Joachim and his Hong Kong-born wife Princess Alexandra are to divorce after nine years of marriage.\n\nDanish public radio announced the news earlier this week following rumours that the pair had been living separate lives. While the palace initially declined to confirm the reports, the news was made official at a press conference in the Yellow Palace at Amalienborg on Thursday.\n\nThe couple, who married in November 1995, have two children – five-year-old Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix, who's two.\n\nAccording to a statement read by royal family chamberlain Ove Ullerup, Queen Margrethe and her husband Prince Henrik \"deeply regretted\" the couple's decision.\n\n---\n\nToo bad I can't really understand fully the whole statement on the official pages of the danish royal house... What a surprise!! I mean they looked happy...\n\nThere have certainly been mutterings in the press, but to me it came as a shock when my friend got a phone call as we were walking home from school.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Alexandra seems to always have had diverging interests, but they have also seemed to work well together.\n\nI hope everything will work out okay for Felix and Nikolai.\n\nAccording to bt.dk this will be the first divorce in the Danish royal family in 165 years.\n\nwymanda said:\n\nWhy do they get a house in Denmark? Their daughter married a Prince not them! I see this as a real imposition on the Danish people!\n\nWhile Princess Mary's father took a short term lecturing job in Copenhagen just after the wedding he did not expect to live permanently in Denmark at the expense of either the country or the Royal family.\n\nI think they're living in a house on Joachim's property of Schackenborg. Which is his private property, and no imposition on the Danish people. I'm quite sure that Alexandra's parents manage to support themselves, and are not a burden on the Danish people, nor the royal family.\n\nwymanda said:\n\nWhy do they get a house in Denmark?

I see this as a real imposition on the Danish people!\n\nWhile Princess Mary's father took a short term lecturing job in Copenhagen just after the wedding he did not expect to live permanently in Denmark at the expense of either the country or the Royal family.\n\nThey have lived there for some time now. Its not because of the divorce or anything. I think they moved to Denmark because Richard Manley was ill and wanted to be closer to his daughter.\n\nAnd i dont see a problem with them living on Shackenborg, its a private estate isn´t it?\n\nhaha, you beat me by seconds norweiganne\n\nhttp://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,10786067%255E1702,00.html\n\nDanish prince to divorce\n\n16sep04\n\nPrince Joachim, Queen Margrethe's second son, will seek a divorce from his Hong Kong-born wife, Princess Alexandra, Danish public radio said today.\n\n<SPAN class=bodytext>The palace declined to comment on the report, saying a news conference was scheduled later today.\n\nJoachim is the younger brother to the heir to Denmark's throne, Crown Prince Frederik, who in May married Tasmanian-born Crown Princess Mary.\n\nJoachim and Alexandra's divorce would be the first in modern times in Europe's oldest ruling monarchy, which traces its line back to the Viking king Gorm the Old, who died in 958.\n\nFor several months, Danish media have carried reports and rumours that the couple had been leading separate lives.\n\non error resume next ShockMode = ( IsObject(CreateObject(\"ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.5\")))if ( ShockMode"
