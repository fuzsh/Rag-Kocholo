        "text": "Synopsis\n\nPrince Louis and Princess Tessy of Luxembourg recently announced their divorce — after a decade of marriage.\n\nUneasy is the heart that wears the crown. As the recent announcement of Prince Louis and Princess Tessy of Luxembourg’s divorce — after a decade of marriage — comes, here’s a look at other royalty who split up.\n\nPrince Joachim of Denmark and Princess Alexandra\n\nCheating\n\nPrince Joachim is the youngest son of Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik. In November 1995, Joachim married Alexandra Christina, the countess of Frederiksborg, who was a Hong Kong-born former sales and marketing executive. They got divorced in 2005 after infidelity made them live separate lives for many years. Both went on to marry again after the divorce and live in Denmark.\n\nPrincess Caroline of Monaco and Ernst August, Prince of Hanover\n\nPrince’s wandering eye\n\nPrincess Caroline of Monaco and German Prince Ernst August of Hanover pose for photographers at an official diner at the Pardo Palace in Madrid in 2004. (File photo: Getty)\n\nThe eldest child of the Prince of Monaco, Rainier III and American actress Grace Kelly, Caroline was married for the third time to Ernst August in 1999. Her earlier marriages to first husband Philippe Junot lasted for two years and second husband, Stefano Casiraghi, died at 30 in a boating accident in 1990. The couple, though not divorced yet, live separately after the prince’s philandering ways came to light.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh\n\nFell out of love\n\nThe Bollywood actor, who hails from the royal family of Pataudi, was married to fellow actor Amrita Singh for 13 years. While Singh blamed Khan’s infidelity for the divorce, he said that they had “fallen out of love”.They couple got married in 1999 and divorced in 2004. Though Khan is now the 10th Nawab of Pataudi, this has no legal or official standing. The people of Pataudi crowned Khan to continue the family tradition. Khan went on to marry Kareena Kapoor in 2012.\n\nPrince Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand and Princess Srirasmi\n\nCorruption scandal\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn has had three marriages and his third one ended in divorce in 2014. In February 2001, when he was the crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn married Srirasmi Suwadee, a commoner. The marriage was not disclosed to the public until early 2005. She gave birth to a son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in April 2005 and was then elevated to the rank of princess. In November 2014, however, Vajiralongkorn sent a letter to the interior ministry asking for Princess Srirasmi’s family to be stripped of the royal name awarded to her, following allegations of corruption against seven of her relatives. They officially got divorced a month later.\n\nPrincess Martha Louise of Norway and Ari Behn\n\nEgo clashes\n\nThe couple have three daughters together. (Image: Getty)\n\nThe daughter of King Harald of Norway, Princess Martha Louise, wed author Ari Behn in a lavish ceremony in Trondheim, Norway in May 2002. The couple share three daughters together. The couple announced their separation and divorce plans in August 2016. This is the first divorce in the Norwegian royal family’s modern history. Pressures of modern living and clashing egos were reported as the reason behind the break-up of their 14 years of marriage.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
