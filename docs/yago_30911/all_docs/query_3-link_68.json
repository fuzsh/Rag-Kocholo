        "text": "Going from commoner to royal isn’t easy, but Princess Marie of Denmark makes it look effortless. How, you ask? Here are four things that make Marie a star in the world of royalty:\n\nMarie comes from an outgoing family\n\nDuring an interview, Marie’s brother Gregory revealed that they grew up in a talkative family who like to meet new people. Definitely a plus for a princess who needs to meet and greet different people every day!\n\nMarie gets along famously with her royal in-laws.\n\nFrom the outset, the pretty brunette charmed her in-laws Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik. The prince especially took a shine to her because like Marie, Henrik is also a French native. Queen Margrethe and Marie both enjoy museums and the ballet, recently attending a performance in Tivoli Gardens.\n\nMarie’s friendly and outgoing nature is a crucial attribute for a public person. The princess’s sunny disposition has also made her own family a warm, loving unit. Marie adores her stepsons Nikolai and Felix, and they love her. The boys get along well with their half-siblings, too. Nikolai and Felix are big brothers to little Henrik, 5, and Athena, 2, from Joachim and Marie’s marriage. They are frequently seen doting on the little ones during family outings.\n\nMarie is multilingual.\n\nBorn in Paris, Marie grew up speaking both French and English. Upon her engagement to Prince Joachim, she added Danish to her language repertoire, which by then included Italian and Spanish. She can now give smooth speeches in Danish and chats easily with her adopted countrymen. Marie fits in well with the royal family: both Joachim and his elder brother, Crown Prince Frederik, speak fluent French. Queen Margrethe herself is multilingual in French, Swedish, English and German.\n\nMarie looks good anywhere!\n\nThe princess has proved time and again that she can easily transition from girl-next-door to elegant royal. Whether it’s a family holiday in sporty shorts or a gala banquet with a tiara, Marie seems born to the role of a royal.\n\nHer story:\n\nMarie (née Cavallier) was born February 6, 1976 in Paris. She lived with her parents and two elder half-brothers, Gregory and Benjamin Grandet.\n\nDespite initial happy beginnings, Marie faced her parents’ divorce when she was still very young. It was a situation familiar to many children, but it devastated young Marie. Little did she know that her experiences would give her an understanding that would help her in her own role as a stepparent one day.\n\nMarie’s parents both remarried: her mother, Françoise, married Christian Grassiot in 1987. Marie got along well with her new stepfather, but never warmed to her father’s new wife. Alain Cavallier’s new marriage produced two more sons, but that would also end in divorce.\n\nAs a child, the princess attended primary school in Paris. She then moved to the exclusive Beau-Soleil International Boarding School in Villars, Switzerland. There she made lasting friendships and had her first taste of independence. After completing her studies there, she went on to study economics in Geneva.\n\nFluent in English, Marie made the decision to continue further studies in the United States. The princess studied international business and economics at Babson College in Boston, Massachusetts. After she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Marymount Manhattan College in New York, Marie returned to Switzerland.\n\nDuring the autumn of 2004 Marie attended a hunting party held by friends of her stepfather. There she met the dashing Prince Joachim, younger son of Queen Margrethe. Marie and Joachim became friends and she took an immediate liking to his two small boys, Nikolai and Felix.\n\nThe relationship did not turn serious until after Joachim’s divorce in 2005. He and Princess Alexandra, now Countess of Frederiksborg, agreed to part on good terms and remain friends for the sake of their sons.\n\nNot long afterwards, Joachim and Marie landed in the media. Danish tourists secretly photographed the pair during their holiday in Avignon in 2005. Despite the intrusion, they carried on as normal as possible. After a two-year courtship, the Palace announced their engagement in October 2007.\n\nIn preparation for her new role as a Danish princess, Marie began Danish language lessons. For her history lessons, Marie toured museums, castles and churches. She got to know the people in the village of Møgeltønder, where she and Joachim would live in Schackenborg Castle. The pair married May 24, 2008.\n\nIn subsequent interviews, Marie stated that she tread carefully with the children when she and Joachim began dating. As a child of divorce, Marie did not want to intrude on their relationship with their father nor step on their mother’s toes. Marie needn’t have worried – the boys warmed to her instantly. She and Alexandra also get along very well, and they are often seen together with their husbands for many events.\n\nThe verdict\n\nPrincess Marie of Denmark is definitely a royal role model. Her poise and elegance, combined with her friendly nature, makes the princess life look effortless. The happy family life that she and Joachim have created is a testament to true love and deep friendship. The Danish royal family is very fortunate indeed."
