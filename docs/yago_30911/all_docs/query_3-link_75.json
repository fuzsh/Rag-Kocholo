        "text": "Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, recently spoke with Danish newspaper BT about her quick divorce from second husband Martin Jørgensen revealing he was not her true love.\n\n“I was quick and confident in my decision. I have not wavered. When it was taken, I was ready to move on,” said the Countess.\n\n“There is no relationship.”\n\nThe Countess was first reported to be dating Martin Jørgensen in mid-2005, and the pair was married on 3 March 2007 in Denmark. They had no children.\n\nThe Countess was married to Prince Joachim of Denmark for a decade, from 1995-2005. The couple, who have two children together – Princes Nicolai and Felix – announced their separation on 16 September 2004, and became the first royal couple to divorce since 1846.\n\nPrince Joachim remarried in 2008, to Marie Cavallier, now Princess Marie of Denmark, with whom he has two children.\n\nThe Countess surprised everyone when she announced her intention to divorce Jørgensen in September 2015. The reason cited was a difference of values, and the pair no longer speaks to each other.\n\n“It turns out that it wasn’t the happiness of my life. The love of my life. I’d rather be alone now,” the Countess said.\n\n“I think a divorce is a private matter,” says Jørgensen, who admits that he has not seen his former stepsons since the divorce.\n\n“It is no secret that I have not.”\n\nThe Countess admits that the divorce has been hard on her sons, but that she has worked to do what’s best for them.\n\n“A divorce is hard on children because they don’t play the leading parts. And unfortunately they are involved.”\n\n“My boys have one father. They have always had one father.”\n\n“I can say that I fully respect that Alexandra has its own interpretation of our marriage and divorce. But it is not my interpretation,” said Jørgensen."
