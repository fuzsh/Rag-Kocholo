        "text": "Denmark's Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Queen Margrethe, and his Hong Kong-born wife, Princess Alexandra, have announced they are to divorce.\n\nIt would be the first divorce in the Danish royal family in 165 years and comes just four months after Prince Frederik, Joachim's elder brother and the heir to the throne, married Tasmanian Mary Donaldson in a glittering Copenhagen Cathedral ceremony.\n\n\"After many difficult considerations, we have jointly decided to separate with the intention of seeking a divorce,\" Joachim and Alexandra said in a palace statement.\n\n\"We are in agreement over the terms of the separation, and we intend to share in the upbringing of our children.\"\n\nJoachim, 35, and Alexandra Manley, 40, married in 1995. They have two sons, Princes Nikolai and Felix, aged five and two.\n\nVia a prepared statement, Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen expressed his Government's \"great regret\" at the news.\n\n\"It is a difficult and deeply personal decision that the prince and princess have had to make together,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a big decision that we must all respect and understand.\"\n\nThe couple had met at a private dinner in 1994 in Hong Kong, where Prince Joachim was working for the Danish shipping company Maersk. Alexandra made her first visit to Denmark six months later.\n\nDanish media have of late speculated that the popular and photogenic couple were headed for a divorce after growing apart, amid reports of the prince's increasing fondness for parties and fast cars.\n\nAccording to leading Copenhagen tabloid Ekstra Bladet, the couple have been leading separate lives for some time.\n\nThe tabloid reported the prince had \"become something of a party prince with a passion for loud music, strong drink and attractive female company\".\n\nPopular magazines and serious newspapers alike have in recent months carried extensive reports of his allegedly rowdy behaviour and social gaffes.\n\nJoachim will continue to live in the couple's official residence, the countryside Schackenborg Manor in southern Jutland, while the princess and the two boys will \"for the time being\" live in the couple's apartment at the Amalienborg palace in Copenhagen.\n\nThough she is a Hong Kong native, Alexandra is not expected to leave Denmark.\n\nUnder Danish law, the two princes cannot leave the Scandinavian country due to succession rules. The newly married Crown Prince Frederik has no children of his own yet.\n\nThe palace said the former Hong Kong stockbroker would retain her title, Her Royal Highness, during the separation, but would after the divorce be addressed as Her Highness Princess Alexandra.\n\nShe is the daughter of Shanghai-born managing director Richard Nigel Manley and Austrian-born Christa Manley. They moved to Denmark several years ago to be closer to their daughter and grandchildren and will stay in Denmark."
