        "text": "For the wedding of Princess Madeleine of Sweden to Chris O'Neill on June 8, 2013, at the Royal Chapel of Stockholm Palace, Princess Marie of Denmark attended alongside her husband, Prince Joachim. Her brother and sister-in-law, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary were there, as well.\n\nPrincess Marie of Denmark wore a light pink Ole Yde gown. It was tighter around the waist and flared out more in the skirt. The gown featured light embellishments and a sheer top; the sleeves on the top were slightly formed like capped sleeves. She was wearing the Order of the Seraphim sash and her Diamond Floral Tiara (the only tiara she has access to in the Danish collection). She also carried a silver and cream By Malene Birger clutch. Additionally, she wore her silver Christine Hvelplund drop earrings.\n\nChris O'Neill elected to not become an official member of the Swedish Royal Family. He chose to remain a private citizen and work in the private sector. He retained his dual American/British citizenship and did not gain Swedish citizenship. He was granted Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star by the King two days before his wedding.\n\nOther royals who attended the wedding were the Crown Prince and Princess and Princess Martha Louise of Norway, Princess Charlene of Monaco, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg, and Princess Takamado of Japan. Of course, Madeleine's godmother, Princess Benedikte was in attendance. The royal attendance at Madeleine's wedding was significantly smaller than at her sister, Crown Princess Victoria's wedding in 2010."
