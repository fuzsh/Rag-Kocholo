        "text": "JACQUES WITT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPrince Joachim, the younger son of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, celebrated his 50th birthday on Friday, and the family gathered for a sparkling dinner in his honor.\n\nSteen Brogaard/Kongehuset\n\nThe court released two new portraits of Joachim to mark the occasion, including this lovely shot of his family. From left to right: Prince Nikolai, Princess Marie, Princess Athena, Prince Joachim, Prince Felix, and Prince Henrik.\n\nOn Friday evening, the family gathered at Amalienborg Palace to attend a gala in Joachim’s honor. He and Marie arrived with his four children, Prince Nikolai, Prince Felix, Prince Henrik, and Princess Athena. Marie chose a piece of heirloom jewelry, Queen Alexandrine’s Diamond and Sapphire Pendant, for the occasion. (Learn more about it here!)\n\nQueen Margrethe chose modern pearl drop earrings for the dinner, as well as a pearl pendant worn on a cord of woven silk.\n\nJoachim’s brother, Crown Prince Frederik, arrived for the dinner with his family as well. Crown Princess Mary wore a pair of sparkling earrings, but it was the princesses who stole the jewelry show. Princess Josephine wore a Marianne Dulong pendant necklace previously sported by her sister, and Princess Isabella wore a family heirloom: Queen Alexandrine’s Diamond and Pearl Brooch. The jewel was reportedly Isabella’s christening gift from Queen Margrethe. Over at the Royal Jewels of the World Message Board, Stig posted some excellent photos of both Isabella and Alexandrine wearing the piece.\n\nJoachim’s first wife, Countess Alexandra of Frederiksborg, wore pearl earrings and a statement necklace for the gala.\n\nA few members of the extended family also attended the celebrations. Joachim’s cousin, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, arrived with his wife, Tatiana. She wore statement earrings and a stack of bracelets.\n\nAnd the newly-married Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg attended with her husband, Count Michael Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille. She wore an impressive brooch at the shoulder of her gown."
