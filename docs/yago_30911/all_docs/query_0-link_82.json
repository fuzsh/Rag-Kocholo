Have an account? .\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark recently announced plans to remove her grandchildren's royal titles.\n\nThe Queen's son, Prince Joachim, and her grandson, Nikolai, seem to be against the decision.\n\nThe monarch later issued an apology and said she wanted to future-proof the monarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn September 29, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark announced that she plans to remove four of her grandchildren's Danish royal titles in 2023.\n\nAs Insider previously reported, the Danish monarch announced via the royal family's website that the children of her youngest son, Prince Joachim of Denmark, will no longer have royal titles in 2023.\n\nThe decision affects Prince Nikolai, 23; Prince Felix, 10; Prince Henrik, 13; and Princess Athena, 10. They will still be able to use the titles of counts and countess of Monpezat, according to the statement on the royal website.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Queen made the decision so her grandchildren would \"be able to shape their own lives\" without being formally affiliated with the royal household.\n\nMeanwhile, the children of Margrethe's eldest son and heir to the throne, Prince Frederik, still have the right to use their royal titles.\n\nRepresentatives for the royal family of Denmark did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Joachim spoke out against the Queen's decision, saying his four children were upset.\n\nPrince Joachim released a statement to the Danish media on the day of the Queen's announcement, sharing that his children were upset with their grandmother's decision.\n\n\"We are all very sad. It's never fun to see your children being mistreated like that,\" he told the Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet. \"They find themselves in a situation they do not understand.\"\n\nHe also told the outlet he was only given five days' notice regarding his mother's decision, though he had been made aware of Queen Margrethe's intentions to revoke his children's titles at some point in May 2022.\n\nRepresentatives for Prince Joachim did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Joachim's eldest son, Prince Nikolai, said he was shocked by the decision.\n\nIn an interview with Ekstra Bladet on September 29, Nikolai said that he was \"in shock\" regarding the decision and \"very confused as to why it has to happen like this,\" according to an English translation shared by the New York Post.\n\nRepresentatives for Prince Nikolai did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Joachim and his wife, Princess Marie, seemed emotional in an interview where they discussed the Queen's announcement.\n\nAccording to an English translation by Hello Magazine, the royal couple appeared tearful when answering questions about the Queen's announcement with the publication B.T. on October 1.\n\nDuring the interview, a French woman approached the couple to tell them that their children will always be princes and princesses in their eyes, which left \"the couple speechless, and they both [began] to cry because they [were] so touched,\" Hello Magazine reported.\n\nIn the interview, Prince Joachim addressed reports that the Queen removed his children's titles to slim down the monarchy.\n\n\"The reality must still be whether you modernize or slim down, it must be done in a proper way. It's about children. Orderliness and children. It is a very heavy matter,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueen Margrethe issued a public apology, saying she made the decision to future-proof the monarchy.\n\nWriting on the Danish royal family's website on October 3, Margrethe addressed the \"strong reactions\" to her decision.\n\nShe wrote that royal titles involve commitment and duties that will lie with fewer members of the royal family in the future, which she views as essential to \"future-proofing\" the monarchy.\n\n\"I have made my decision as Queen, mother, and grandmother. But, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry,\" Margrethe wrote, adding that her children, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren are \"my great joy and pride.\"\n\n\"I now hope that we as a family can find the peace to find our way through this situation,\" she wrote.\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
