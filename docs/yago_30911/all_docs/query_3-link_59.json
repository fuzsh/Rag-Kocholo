        "text": "Last year, Queen Margerthe announced she would remove prince and princess titles from four of her grandchildren. The news came as a surprise to their father, Prince Joachim, who expressed his disappointment to the press, saying, \"My kids don’t know which leg to stand on. What they should believe. Why should their identity be removed? Why must they be punished in that way?\" Prince Joachim, who is sixth in line to the throne, is now relocating his family to the U.S. in 2023.\n\nJoachim and his family will move to Washington, D.C. in summer 2023. They are currently living in Paris, where Joachim has worked as defense attaché for the last two years. The move will take his family even further away from Queen Margrethe and the rest of the Danish royal family.\n\nThe Danish royal palace confirmed the move in March 2023, writing on Instagram, \"On 1 September 2023, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim will take up a new position under the Ministry of Defense as defense industry attaché at the Danish Embassy in Washington D.C., where the Prince, as Denmark's representative, will in the coming years help to strengthen the defense industry cooperation with the USA and Canada.\"\n\nJoachim's four children lost their titles in the new year, and they now go by Count and Countess of Monpezat moving forward. Nikolai and Felix he shares with his first wife, Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, and Henrik and Athena are with his second wife, Princess Marie.\n\nQueen Margethe shared after the title controversy, \"I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected.\"\n\nShe added, \"No one should be in doubt that my children, daughters-in-law and grandchildren are my great joy and pride. I now hope that we as a family can find the peace to find our way through this situation.\""
