        "text": "JENS NOERGAARD LARSEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNine years ago today, Prince Joachim of Denmark married Marie Cavallier in Mogeltonder. Today, we’ve got two flashback posts on tap full of jewels from this royal wedding. Enjoy this look at jewels worn by the main line of the Danish royal family, plus the Norwegian and Swedish royals, and stop back for even more royal jewels later today!\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMarie Cavallier, who became Princess Marie of Denmark after her wedding, wore Princess Dagmar’s Floral Tiara on her wedding day. The tiara is on long-term loan to Marie from her mother-in-law, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Although she has acquired another tiara to wear during her marriage, this remains her primary diadem today. A press release from the Danish court on the wedding day noted that Marie also wore “a pair of diamond earrings from Genève.”\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMarie’s lace wedding gown was designed by the firm Arasa Morelli. Her tulle and lace veil had a floral design that echoed the diamond flowers in her wedding tiara.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nJoachim’s mother, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, wore a tiara that she often dons at weddings: the Baden Palmette Tiara. The palmette motifs of the tiara form heart shapes, making it particularly appropriate for the occasion. She paired the tiara with diamond earrings, a diamond necklace, and a diamond brooch.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nShe also wore the insignia of the Order of the Elephant, the Order of the Dannebrog, and her father’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCrown Princess Mary of Denmark wore the parts of the grand ruby parure for the occasion. This wedding happened not long before she had the tiara remodeled to better fit the shape of her head. She’s also wearing part of the earrings from the suite.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThe large brooch was pinned to Mary’s bodice, and she wore the ruby bangle on her right wrist. A diamond ring is visible on her right hand, and her wedding and engagement rings are on her left.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMary also wore the Order of the Elephant and her mother-in-law’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nThe Swedish royal family was represented at the wedding by Crown Princess Victoria. She wore the family’s four-button tiara, as well as the drops from the Connaught Diamond Tiara on a necklace. Her earrings came from Queen Josefina’s grand diamond stomacher.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her left wrist, she wore two diamond bracelets…\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\n…and she wore an evening watch on her right wrist. A diamond ring is also visible here on her right hand.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nVictoria pinned her father’s family order to the sash of the Order of the Elephant.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway wore her own wedding tiara, the Diamond Daisy Bandeau, for this royal wedding. She paired it with the diamond earrings that belonged to her husband’s grandmother, Crown Princess Martha.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMette-Marit secured the sash of the Order of St. Olav with a diamond and pearl brooch. (In 2008, she didn’t have the Order of the Elephant yet; she does now.)\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nA bracelet set with diamonds and green stones can be seen here on her right wrist.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nMette-Marit, who was escorted by Crown Prince Haakon, also wore her father-in-law’s family order.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nPrincess Martha Louise also attended from Norway. She wore King Olav’s Gift Tiara with a suite of jewels — earrings, necklace, and ring — set with diamonds and milky blue stones (possibly moonstones?).\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nOn her left hand, she also wore a ring set with a blue stone (possibly a star sapphire). She secured the sash of the Order of the Elephant with a small brooch; her father’s family order was also pinned to the bodice of her gown. Martha Louise was expecting her third child, Emma, at the time of this wedding. Sadly, she and her husband, Ari Behn, are now in the process of divorcing.\n\nCLAUS FISKER/AFP/Getty Images\n\n…and in a non-royal bonus, here’s a glimpse of some other wedding guests, Sir Roger Moore and his wife, Kiki Tholstrup. As I was finishing up edits to this post, I learned that Sir Roger had just passed away at the age of 89. Moore popped up occasionally at royal events, thanks to friendships with Prince Joachim of Denmark, Prince Albert II of Monaco, and the late Princess Lilian of Sweden."
