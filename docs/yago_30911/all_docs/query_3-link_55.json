In 1995, she married Prince Joachim of Denmark, younger son of Queen Margrethe. Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra had two sons, Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix, but divorced in 2005. She remarried in 2007 to Martin Jørgensen, but they divorced in 2015. After her divorce, she was granted a personal title of Countess of Frederiksborg with the style of Excellency by Queen Margrethe. The Countess still attends some family events, such as Crown Prince Frederik’s 50th Birthday Gala Dinner.
