        "text": "SYDNEY (AP) — For the first time, Australians find themselves on the brink of witnessing one of their own, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, rise to the rank of queen when her husband, Crown Prince Frederik, is proclaimed king of that European nation Sunday.\n\nHe will become King Frederik X of Denmark two weeks after his 83-year-old mother, Queen Margrethe II, announced she would be the first Danish royal to abdicate in some 900 years.\n\nThe 51-year-old Crown Princess Mary’s unlikely journey from Tasmania to European royalty as the world’s first Australian-born queen has captivated Danes and Australians alike for over two decades.\n\nThe then Mary Donaldson was 28 years old and working as a real estate agent when her chance meeting with the Danish prince occurred at a Sydney pub during the 2000 Olympics. He was at the Games to support Denmark’s sailing team.\n\nThe announcement of their engagement in 2003 marked the beginning of what is considered in Australia a fairytale romance, and her succession to the title of queen consort has many Australians brimming with excitement and anticipation.\n\nThough this is a country that purports to be classless and egalitarian, Australians are reflecting national pride as a fellow Australian transcends geographical, social and cultural boundaries to assume a position of global prominence, even if it has been attained through marrying well.\n\nPrincess Mary’s ascension potentially also promotes discussion about Australia’s evolving identity at a time when many Australians, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, would prefer that the country cut ties with the British monarchy and become a republic with its own head of state.\n\nMore tangibly, Princess Mary has played a significant role in connecting Australia with Denmark. For over 20 years, Australians have watched her seamlessly integrate Danish traditions and language into her life while maintaining a strong connection to her Australian roots and visiting her homeland often.\n\nHer commitment to philanthropy, advocating for health, women’s rights and children’s well-being, has further endeared her to Australians.\n\nIn Copenhagen, Thomas Larsen, a royal expert compared Mary with the late British Princess Diana.\n\n“I think she has a big heart when it comes to people who are isolated, who are lonely. She wants to reach out to people who need help,” Larsen told The Associated Press.\n\nAnd in the early hours of Monday morning Australian time, the modern-day fairytale will reach a new high point when Crown Princess Mary becomes the first Australian to become a queen.\n\n____ Associated Press journalist Anders Garde Kongshaug in Copenhagen, Denmark, contributed to this report."
