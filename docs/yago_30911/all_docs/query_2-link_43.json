        "text": "“The Throne Hall at Christiansborg Castle forms a frame for the first official portraits of Their Majesties The King and Queen.\n\nThe portrait series was taken by photographer Dennis Stenild a few moments after the King’s proclamation, which took place from the balcony of Tronsalen on the 14th. January 2024\n\nThe Royal Couple is pictured together with The Crown Prince, His Royal Highness The Crown Prince, and Their Royal Highnesses Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.”\n\nQueen Margrethe II\n\nMargrethe is the oldest daughter of the late King Frederick IX and was born on April 16, 1940.\n\nFollowing the death of Queen Elizabeth II, she became the only reigning female monarch and has been the longest-reigning monarch in Denmark’s history.\n\nThe Queen’s younger years were very memorable as they led her to be labelled as the ‘Ashtray Queen’ after her affinity for cigarettes.\n\nMargrethe was married to her husband Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark for over 50 years.\n\nMargrethe announced her sudden abdication in her New Year’s Eve address, “On 14th January, 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as Queen of Denmark.”\n\nKing Frederik X and Queen Mary\n\nKing Frederik X is the oldest son of Margrethe and Henrik, and he succeeded the throne following the Queen’s abdication. The ceremony was held on January 14, 2024.\n\nBorn on May 26, 1968, he became the Crown Prince of Denmark at the age of 4.\n\nHe worked for the U.N. and at the Danish Embassy in Paris and even underwent extensive military training in the Danish Navy, Army and Air Force.\n\nHe has a keen interest in environmentalism and even co-authored the 2009 book Polartokt Kongelig about the politics of climate change.\n\nWhile in town for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, he met Mary Donaldson in a pub and merely introduced himself as ‘Fred’.\n\nMary Elizabeth Donaldson was born on February 5, 1972, and despite having Scottish parents she was born and raised in Tasmania.\n\nThe pair married on May 14, 2004, at the Copenhagen Cathedral.\n\nDespite not being born into the royal family, Mary was the first non-royal, since Queen Ingrid, given the power to act as regent when Margrethe and Frederik were unavailable.\n\nCrown Prince Christian\n\nThe oldest child of Frederik and Mary, Prince Christian was born on October 15 2005.\n\nMale monarchs of Denmark have only had the names, Fredrik or Christian since 1513.\n\nThis year the royal turned 18 and received many more royal duties and responsibilities. He then became the Crown Prince of Denmark on January 14 2024, when his father ascended the throne and became King.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie\n\nPrince Joachim is the youngest son of Queen Margrethe and Henrik, born on June 7, 1969.\n\nLike his brother, he has had a lengthy military career, from a junior officer in 1987 to a special advisor to the Chief of Defense in the Royal Danish Army.\n\nJoachim has been married twice. He and his first wife, Alexandra, Countess of Fredriksborg, married in November 1995. The couple had two children, Nikolai and Felix, before divorcing in April 2005.\n\nJoachim married Marie Cavallier, later Princess Marie of Denmark, in 2008. They share two children: Henrik and Athena.\n\nAll four of his children were stripped of their royal titles at the request of Queen Margrethe.\n\nJoachim told Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet: “It’s never fun to see your children being mistreated like that. They find themselves in a situation they do not understand. I was given five days’ notice.”\n\nCount Nikolai\n\nBorn Aug. 28, 1999, Count Nikolai of Monpezat is the oldest son of Joachim and his ex-wife, Alexandra, formerly known as Prince Nikolai of Denmark.\n\nHe and his three siblings were stripped of their royal titles in September 2022.\n\nIn 2018, he became a model and has since walked the runways for design houses such as Burberry and Dior.\n\nCount Nikolai moved to Australia to study at UTS in 2023."
