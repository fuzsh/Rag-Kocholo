The couple will split their time between their slot in south Denmark and Copenhagen.\n\nChildren:\n\nHH Prince Henrik Carl Joachim Alain, born on 4 May 2009 and HH Princess Athena Marguerite Françoise Marie, born on 24 January 2012\n\nRelationship with a Prince:\n\nMarie Cavallier met Prince Joachim in 2002 whilst on a hunting trip in Denmark, and did not re-connect until 2005 in Paris. In the summer of that year, the couple were photographed whilst on holiday in Avignon, France. Sometime later the Danish tabloid, Billed Bladet, chased down the mysterious French woman.\n\nRumors circulated that it was Joachim who broke it off, but no one really knows for sure. However, it didn't last long. The couple, once again, re-kindled their relationship. The couple was seen again in mid 2006. Soon Marie was spending time in Copenhagen. A major turning point in the relationship happened during New Year's Eve's weekend 2006/2007. The couple along with his children, close friends, and Prince Joachim’s ex-wife, Countess Alexandra of Frederiksborg and her partner, now husband, Martin rang in the new year together.\n\nIn February, there was a delightful ski trip in Switzerland with Joachim along with his two sons, Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix. Of course, Marie’s dog, Apple, was there stuffed into her backpack. As the months progressed Marie was seen frequently in Denmark. She spent Easter at Marselisborg with the royal family whereupon she met Queen Margrethe for the first time.\n\nEngagement:\n\nAfter months of anticipation and rumors swirling on the Internet as well as the Danish weekly tabloids about the the couple, the palace finally announced the engagement on October 3, 2007. Per Ove Ullerup, the Lord Chamberlain, via Kongehuest.dk:\n\nHer Majesty the Queen of Denmark and His Royal Highness the Prince Consort have the pleasure to announce the engagement of their son, His Royal Highness Prince Joachim to Miss Marie Cavallier.\n\nToday, Wednesday October 3rd 2007, the Council of State has been assembled at Christiansborg Castle presided over by Her Majesty the Queen. Upon submission from the Prime Minister and in accordance with the Act of Succession of 1953, Her Majesty gave her consent to the marriage of His Royal Highness Prince Joachim and Miss Marie Cavallier.\n\nApparently, Joachim proposed to Marie over the summer while the two were vacationing in Turkey. The unconventional engagement ring consists of three stones: Ruby, Diamond, Sapphire. Billed Bladet's Anna Johannesen, describes the ring as being, \"...a heavy gold ring...\" She goes on to note that \"Prince Joachim ordered the ring 4-5 months ago from goldsmith Mette Rosgaard.\" Marie did not wear the ring until the official press conference. It was a major secret. Nonetheless, months prior to the press conference one could easily tell that something was about to happen. The royal wedding took place May 24, 2008. Miss Cavallier gave up her French citizenship and converted to Lutheranism. After her marriage to Prince Joachim, she is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Marie.\n\nSources:\n\nBT\n\nBilled Bladet\n\nVideo clips of the press conference announcing their engagement.\n\nLong unedited version\n\nDr.dk documentary about Marie"
