        "text": "Prince Joachim and his wife, Princess Marie of Denmark appeared emotional and fought back their tears as they spoke about their relationship with other members of the royal family of Denmark. It comes after Queen Margrethe II of Denmark decided to axe the titles \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" for the couple's children last week.\n\nAccording to the change, which was announced in a statement from the palace on Thursday, the children of the monarch's second son, Prince Joachim, will receive new styling as of next year.\n\nThe sovereign's grandchildren in this line will instead inherit the title of His or Her Excellency, Count or Countess of Monpezat.\n\nIn a recent interview with Danish publication B.T., the couple appeared sad as they spoke of their relationship with the Queen and the monarch's eldest son as \"complicated\".\n\nPrince Joachim, Princess Marie and Countess Alexandra reacted strongly, saying they were \"in shock\" and that the children felt \"outcast\" by the royal family, according to B.T..\n\nPrince Joachim also told B.T. that his children felt \"punished\" and that he had only been given five days to tell them about the controversial decision.\n\nHowever, according to the Denish publication, the royal house's head of communications, claimed that Prince Joachim had known about the decision since May.\n\nIn an awkward conversation with journalists, the couple can be heard reluctant to expose their family difficulties.\n\nAsked why they think the decision was taken, Princess Marie said: \"That's a good question. I don't think it's modern to have some injured children.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Queen Margrethe of Denmark's seasonal home of Fredensborg\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is a very heavy matter.\"\n\nDuring the interview, a French woman approaches and tells the couple that their children will always be princes and princesses to her.\n\nThe situation leaves the couple speechless and they both shed tears, with the Prince turning around to take a breath.\n\nHowever, the couple stressed that they are not thinking of leaving the Danish royal house.\n\nDON'T MISS: Queen Margrethe of Denmark's grandchildren to lose royal titles\n\nQueen Margrethe royal title stripping likened to 'Megxit crisis'\n\nQueen Margrethe is Denmark's surprisingly down-to-earth monarch\n\nInstead, they told B.T. they will continue their work in their own way - even if the family is divided like never before.\n\nPrincess Marie noted: \"We have never had any doubts about it. I hope no one doubts that.\"\n\nLast week's statement from the palace detailed: \"With her decision, Her Majesty The Queen wishes to create the framework for the four grandchildren to be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited by the special considerations and duties that a formal affiliation with the Royal House of Denmark as an institution involves.\"\n\nIt was stated that the decision comes as a \"natural extension\" of a previous announcement that only Prince Christian will receive an annuity from the state of Denmark as an adult."
