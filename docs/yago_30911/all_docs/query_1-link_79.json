        "text": "24 years ago, no one could have predicted a royal love story for the ages was about to unfold. Today, Mary Donaldson is the Queen of Denmark, married to King Frederik.\n\n“I love marriage, my wife, our children and the whole happy base that arises for the people who manage to stay together and persevere,” Frederik said days after the ascension ceremony in a new book The King’s Word.\n\nBut the road to Mary’s royal love story began like any other romance. She first crossed paths with Fred at Sydney CBD pub the Slip Inn during the 2000 Olympics. But the then 28-year-old had no idea she’d just met a Danish royal.\n\n“The first time we met we shook hands,” she recalled. “I didn’t know he was Prince Frederik. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, ‘Do you know who these people are?'”\n\nThe first year of their romance was a long-distance relationship, with Frederik making secret trips to Australia. In 2001, Mary moved to Denmark and their story rocketed into international folklore.\n\nTwo years later, on October 8, 2003, it was announced that the couple were officially engaged.\n\n“I don’t recall wishing that one day I would be a princess,” Mary said shortly after the engagement. “I wanted to be a veterinarian.”\n\nThe couple married on May 14, 2004, at Copenhagen Cathedral in the nation’s capital, where Mary wore a beautiful gown created by Danish designer Uffe Frank.\n\n“From today, Mary is mine and I am hers,” Fred said at the altar. “I love her and I will protect her with all my love.”\n\nFrederik and Mary, who were crowned King and Queen in January 2024, have now been married for 19 years and are the proud parents to four children: Prince Christian (born on October 15, 2005), Princess Isabella (born on April 21, 2007), and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine (born January 8, 2011).\n\nKeep reading to see Mary and Frederik’s romance in pictures!"
