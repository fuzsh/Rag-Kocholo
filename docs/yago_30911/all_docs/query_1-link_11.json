She moved to Geneva, Switzerland, after her parents divorced.\n\nShe has four half-brothers, Benjamin and Gregory Grandet, both born in Switzerland, and Charles and Edouard Cavallier, both born in Paris.\n\nEducation[]\n\nAfter her parents divorced, Marie was sent to the Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil boarding school in Switzerland. She attended Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, for a brief time, to study international business and economics and then went on to study economics in Genève. Marie earned a Bachelor of Arts at Marymount Manhattan College. During her years in college, Marie worked for Estée Lauder, as assistant to the public relations manager in 1994, and as an assistant to the managing director of ING Numismatic Group SA in Genève.\n\nAfter graduating, she started working for DoubleClick Inc, an international advertising agency, in New York as international marketing coordinator. Back in France, she worked for advertising agency Media Marketing. She then worked for Reuters financial news agency Radianz in Switzerland, took a position with her stepfather's company, REInvest in Geneva and worked as executive secretary in ING Numismatic Group SA until the engagement.\n\nPrincess Marie's mother tongue is French. In addition she speaks English, Spanish and Italian. In connection to her wedding with Prince Joachim she started taking lessons in Danish.\n\nCourtship[]\n\nMarie first came to public attention when she was photographed on a private holiday in Avignon, France, with Prince Joachim in August 2005.

Later that year, Marie joined the royal family for Easter at Marselisborg Palace, where she met The Queen for the first time. There was speculation about her relationship with Joachim and regular media stories in Denmark. Marie increasingly made weekend visits from Geneva to Denmark in 2007. Marie's \"trademark\" companion is her Bichon Frisé named Apple, which seems to go with her to work and has travelled with her on numerous occasions to Denmark.\n\nEngagement[]\n\nOn 3 October 2007, it was officially announced that Marie Cavallier was engaged to Prince Joachim.
