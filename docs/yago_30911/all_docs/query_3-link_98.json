        "text": "Danish prince and HK-born princess file for divorce\n\n(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2005-03-25 08:34\n\nPrince Joachim of Denmark, the youngest son of Queen Margrethe II, and his wife Princess Alexandra have officially filed for divorce after a six-month trial separation, the royal court said.\n\nFile photo of Danish Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Queen Margrethe, and Hong Kong-born Princess Alexandra dance their wedding waltz at the Royal Palace of Fredensborg 19 November 1995. [AFP]\n\nThe couple announced their \"difficult\" decision to separate last September 16, and officially parted a week later.\n\n\"The sympathy and support that we witnessed from so many parties during the separation has helped both of us to come through this difficult period and has largely contributed to ensuring a good and secure daily existence for our children,\" the ex-couple said in a common statement.\n\nJoachim, 35, and 40-year-old Alexandra Christina Manley, originally from Hong Kong, were married on November 18, 1995.\n\nThey have two sons together, Nicolai, 5, and Felix, 2, who are currently living with their mother in an apartment in the Royal Palace of Amalienborg in Copenhagen, and who will soon move with her to a house three kilometers (two miles) away.\n\nAfter the divorce, Alexandra will lose her title of \"Royal Highness\", and will only be called \"Highness\", according to the Royal Court.\n\nShe will continue to receive an annual state pension of 1.5 million kroner (262,000 dollars, 202,000 euros) as long as she does not remarry."
