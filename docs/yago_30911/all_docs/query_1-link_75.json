        "text": "ATHENS, Sept. 18 — King Constantine of the Hellenes, the world's youngest reigning monarch, married 18-year‐old Princess. Anne‐Marie of Denmark this morning before a spectacular assemblage of royalty.\n\nAfter a day of dazzling ceremony, the 24‐year‐old King and his bride flew off across the Aegean Sea on their wedding trip.\n\nIt was the first marriage of a reigning king of Greece in 100 years, and Athens made a memorable’ uproar. By 6 A.M. streets were crowded with swirls of people, estimated at nearly a million, waiting to see the procession to and from |the cathedral.\n\nEvery balcony in the city seemed to overflow with perspiring spectators, tossing strips of paper in red and blue, dominant colors in the flags of Denmark and Greece.\n\nThe 400 wedding guests, whose names read like a rollcall of European royalty, started arriving after 9 A.M. in the small honey‐colored cathedral that the Greeks call Metropolis, a modern basilica completed in 1855 from materials of 70 other churches and castles demolished for the purpose.\n\nThe King and Queen Mother Frederika arrived at 10 A.M. in an open coach drawn by chestnut and white horses. Drummers from the Danish Royal Navy filled the air.with a majestic beat.\n\nThe King wore the gleaming white uniform of a field marshal, its high‐crowned kepi accentuating his beaming boyish face. His tunic gleamed as the hot mornings sunlight struck gold braid, ribbons, stars and badges of the four royal orders of Greece. The epaulettes bore the Greek letter “P” in memory of his father, King Paul, who died last March.\n\n“How I wish my dear father were with us today,” the King said at one point.\n\nThe Queen Mother's expression was somber. She wore a gray coat embroidered with gray pearls that contrasted with two huge ruby brooches.\n\nHer dress, designed by the Greek couturier Jean Desses, was of gray silk heavily embroidered with silver. Her large hat was made of pale pink and blue feathers.\n\nThey were greeted outside the cathedral by the 84-yearold Archbishop of Athens, the Primate of Greece, Chrysostomos. His long white beard and gold embroidered vestments made him a striking figure.\n\nAnne‐Marie and her father, King Frederik IX of Denmark, reached the church in an open carriage at 10:15. The King wore the uniform of an admiral of the Danish Navy. His daughter's dress, designed in Copenhagen by Holger Blom, was of white duchesse satin with an 18-foot train, hardly a comfortable material for a scorching September day.\n\nHer long lace veil was held by a diamond tiara that two other brides — her mother, Queen Ingrid, and her grandmother, Princess Margaret Victoria — wore at their weddings. A diamond cross hung at the bride's throat, and she carried a large bouquet of lilies of the valley.\n\nAs the bride entered the church on the arm of her father, 80 choir boys chanted the 21st Psalm. King Constantine, who had glanced down the aisle twice, bent low to kiss the bride's hand and gave her a long look as he reached her side. The 32-minute marriage ceremony began.\n\nThe couple stood before a small table covered by a blue velvet cloth richly embroidered in gold. On it were two gold crowns. studded with rubies and diamonds, that were used by King George I, a common ancestor of the couple, when he married Grand Duchess Olga, niece of the Czar of Russia, in 1867.\n\nQueen Mother Frederika, chief witness to the ceremony, stood behind the couple. Members of the royal families of Greece and Denmark, — both of the House of SchleswigHolstein Sonderburg Glucksburg—stood at the sides of the nave. They included the bride's sisters—Crown Princess Margrethe and Princess Benedikte.\n\nQueen Ingrid, who wore a brilliant green dress and hat, watched the wedding of her youngest daughter with a worried but tender expression. It was apparent that Anne‐Marie was nervous and that the heat affected her as much as it did many of the royal guests, who fanned themselves briskly during the ceremony.\n\nExcept when Constantine smiled or whispered to her, she seemed transfixed.\n\nThe Archbishop made the Sign of the Cross on the foreheads of the couple. He next placed rings on the fourth fingers of their right hands. The Queen Mother exchanged the rings three times.\n\nAnne‐Marie's ring was made by melting down coins dating from the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nThen the choir chanted the 128th Psalm, and the newlyweds clasped right hands. The principal part of the ceremony consisted of a litany and two long prayers.\n\nAfter blessing the crowns, the Archbishop held them above the. heads of the couple. The Queen Mother, standing slightly on tip‐toe, then held them herself and slowly crossed crowns over the heads of the bridal couple three times."
