        "text": "Prince Joachim, Queen Margrethe's second son, will seek a divorce from his Hong Kong-born wife, Princess Alexandra, a spokesman for Denmark's royal family said.\n\nA statement read by Ove Ullerup, the Royal household's top official, said Queen Margrethe and her husband Prince Henrik \"deeply regretted\" the couple's decision, but added they would give their full support to their son and daughter-in-law.\n\nJoachim is the younger brother to the heir to Denmark's throne, Crown Prince Frederik, who in May married Tasmanian-born Crown Princess Mary.\n\nUllerup said Joachim and Alexandra would continue their official duties during the divorce and the princess would keep her royal title during the one-year separation period. If the divorce is completed, then it would be the queen's decision whether to let Alexandra keep her royal title.\n\n\"The princess has no plans to leave the country,\" Ullerup said.\n\nThe announcement marks the first time since 1846 that the royal family, Europe's oldest ruling monarchy, has had a member divorce. The monarchy was founded by the Viking Gorm the Old, who died in 958.\n\nSteffen Heiberg, a historian specialising in royal history, said the last divorce in the Danish royal house was in 1846 when King Frederik VII divorced Princess Caroline Charlotte Mariane of Mecklemburg-Strelitz, Germany.\n\nHe said the divorce was a \"private matter\" and would be handled like any other divorce in the Scandinavian country of 5.4 million.\n\n\"Both of them have a duty to take care of their children and will continue to share parenting responsibilities,\" Niels Eilschou Holm, the palace's legal expert told reporters at a news conference at the Yellow Palace in the capital, Copenhagen.\n\nThe couple were not at the conference.\n\nFor several months, Danish media have carried reports and rumours that the couple had been leading separate lives.\n\nJoachim, 35, and Alexandra Manley, 40, were married on November 18, 1995, at Frederiksborg Castle in Hilleroed, Denmark. The couple have two sons, Prince Nikolai, five, and Prince Felix, two.\n\nAfter the wedding, the enormously popular princess captured Danes' hearts and admiration by giving a speech in fluent Danish.\n\nAlexandra spends considerable time in the public eye, serving as the patron of 21 groups, including the Danish Association for the Blind, a marine life museum, a girls' choir and a shelter for homeless and abused women with children. She is also the president of UNICEF Denmark.\n\nWhile Alexandra carried out official duties, Joachim was dubbed \"the party prince\" because he spent more time att soccer games, racing vintage cars and attending rock concerts."
