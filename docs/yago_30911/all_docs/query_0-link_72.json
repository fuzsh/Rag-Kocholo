        "text": "Prince Joachim, the younger son of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and his family will be moving to the Washington, D.C. area in early fall 2023. According to the Danish newspaper, B.T, the Prince will be starting a new job in the defense industry.\n\nThe prince is currently working as a defense attaché at the Danish Embassy in Paris. A few weeks ago, he spoke to Billed-Bladet about his job in Paris. \"It's a fantastic job, but it ends this summer, that's all.\" In the interview, he also alluded to a new position n the defense industry.\n\n\"It's not something you leave behind, it must be kept going. and the forging must be done while the iron is hot,\" he said.\n\nThe new job will take him to the Washington, D.C. area, perhaps Northern Virginia. The Pentagon is located in Arlington, just across the river from D.C. There are also numerous defense firms in Northern Virginia. There is also affordable housing (for Prince Joachim and his family) in Fairfax County, especially in McLean and Great Falls.\n\nPrince Joachim's military studies began in 2019 at Prince Joachim at \"France's highest-ranked military education at the Center des Hautes Études Militaires (CHEM) and the Institut des Hautes Études de la Défense Nationale (IHEDN) in Paris,\" according to B.T. He is also a colonel in the Danish Reserves.\n\nAfter a tumultuous few months, following Queen Margrethe's decision to remove the royal titles from Prince Joachim's four children, the prince told BT that \"communication with the royal family has been restored,\n\n\"There is a lot to work on,\" he said. \"Communication what was missing. Now we have met and we are on the right track.\"\n\nThe prince's four children, Nikolai, Felix, Henrik, and Athena will lose their royal titles on January 1, 2023. They will be styled as Count Nikolai, Count Felix, Count Henrik, and Countess Athena de Montpezat,\n\nHis two elder sons are from Joachim's first marriage to Hong Kong-born Alexandra Manley. His second wife, Marie (nee Cavallier) is French.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie have lived in Paris since 2019. Since October 2021, the princess has been the Special Culture Representative at the Danish Embassy in Paris.\n\nIn their interview with BT, the couple emphasized that they were not going to leave the Royal Family. \"We have never had any doubts about it. I hope no one doubts that,\" Princess Marie said.\n\nPrince Joachim acknowledged: \"That's exactly what we do after all. In each of our positions, we are representatives of Denmark and Danish interests. And the Royal House. And Royal House interests.\"\n\nThis is not a permanent move to the United States. Prince Joachim expects to stay in the new job for a limited amount of time before taking on another position in his chosen field.\n\nBT noted: \"although France and Denmark have close cooperation, the United States is, as you know, Denmark's most important ally when it comes to defense.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that the prince and princess will enroll their two young children in the Fairfax County school system if they settle in Northern Virginia (even though the public school system is excellent). The DMV has several renowned international schools, including the Rochambeau French International School and the British International School.\n\nIt is possible that the prince's new job will be in Washington. D.C. which means settling into a new home in one of the capital's finer neighborhoods, especially in northwest D.C.\n\nThe DMV is a great area to live and work. Excellent restaurants. theatre, museums, sports -- if Prince Joachim and his family want to take in a baseball game I know the perfect person to sit next to him.\n\nPrince Joachim has family living in the United States. His second cousin, Princess Madeleine of Sweden, lives in the Miami area with her husband. Princess Martha of Norway, who is Joachim's fourth cousin, lives in southern California with her fiancé, Durek Verrett.\n\nhttps://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2022/09/changes-in-titles-for-queen-margrethe.html\n\nhttps://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2022/09/prince-joachims-response.html"
