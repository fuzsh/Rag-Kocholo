        "text": "A year and a half ago, in September 2022, Queen Margrethe announced she would remove prince and princess titles from four of her grandchildren‚Äîthe children of her second son, Prince Joachim‚Äîas of January 1, 2023. Soon after the decision was made public, Prince Joachim and his family expressed their displeasure, and the Danish royal family began very publicly feuding. However, in the 18 months since, Queen Margrethe abdicated, Joachim's older brother became King Frederik X, and, Prince Joachim and his wife, Princess Marie, moved to Washington, D.C. (Prince Joachim started a new job as a defense attach√© at the Danish Embassy.)\n\nIn a new interview with the Washington Post, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie opened up about their move, and Princess Marie revealed her feelings on the title controversy. \"We weren't happy about the way it happened,\" Marie said. \"But it's a family thing. It's complicated.\" She added, \"It's also their name. It's their identity since they were born. So it‚Äôs more than just what people see as a title.\" (Joachim and Marie have two children, Count Henrik, 14, and Countess Athena, 12, and Joachim has two children from his previous marriage, Count Nikolai, 24, and Count Felix, 21.) Prince Joachim was more blunt when asked about the titles: \"We've moved on,\" he told the Post.\n\nWhy Is King Charles' Diagnosis Public While Kate Middleton's Is Private?\n\n\"It was sensible to be more open about it, as otherwise, people might have thought the worst,\" a palace insider said.\n\nAnonymous Courtier Says Recent Royal Drama Is Not a Crisis \"Yet\"\n\nTruly just...üò¨\n\nWhere Is Kate Middleton: Breaking Down Twitter's Conspiracy Theories\n\nIt's...getting complicated!\n\nAn Official Timeline of Prince William and Prince Harry‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoyal Rift‚Äù\n\nCome for the drama, stay for the fanfic.\n\nMeghan Markle Is Gearing Up for a New Podcast: Here‚Äôs What We Know\n\nBonus: Archetypes will also be distributed on all platforms. üéôÔ∏è\n\nA Definitive Timeline of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs Entire Relationship\n\nThis royal love story is a good one.\n\nSoon after the decision was announced, Queen Margrethe apologized, but didn't regret her decision. \"Holding a royal title involves a number of commitments and duties that, in the future, will lie with fewer members of the royal family. This adjustment, which I view as a necessary future-proofing of the monarchy, I want to take in my own time,\" she said, adding, \"I have made my decision as Queen, mother and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
