        "text": "Mary didn't know Frederik was a prince when they met at a pub in Sydney\n\nThe couple first met at the Slip Inn, a pub in Sydney, Australia, according to the Mail Online's Jessica Green and Daily Mail Australia's Alice Murphy. Frederik was visiting the country to watch Denmark's sailing team in the Olympics, the report added.\n\n\"The first time we met or shook hands, I did not know he was the Crown Prince of Denmark,\" Mary told \"60 Minutes Australia.\"\n\n\"It was perhaps half an hour or so later that someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'\" she said.\n\nShortly after meeting, the couple began dating long-distance, which Mary said was beneficial in establishing a deep connection.\n\n\"Everything was through words, so it established a really strong relationship to begin with,\" she added.\n\nAs a founding member of the Commonwealth, an international organization that's made up of many of Britain's former colonies, Australia recognizes Britain's monarch as its head of state.\n\nGrowing up in Australia, Mary had an awareness of British royalty, but she wasn't an avid royal watcher since there wasn't \"a great deal of presence unless there was an official visit,\" she said in an interview with the Financial Times' Anders Christian Madsen in 2022.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHowever, her position has changed in the years following her wedding to Frederik at Copenhagen Cathedral on May 14, 2004.\n\nSpeaking to Madsen, Mary said she has an admiration for Britain's late Queen Elizabeth II and her mother-in-law, Denmark's Queen Margrethe II, \"for their lifelong commitment and dedication to serving their country and their people.\"\n\nToday, Mary and Frederick work to support Margrethe at official events with their royal patronages. In 2007, the princess created The Mary Foundation, which aims to prevent social isolation by tackling three areas: \"Bullying and well-being, domestic violence, and loneliness,\" according to Mary's biography on the Danish royal website.\n\nMeanwhile, the crown prince supports more than 35 organizations that have a focus on \"business, culture, sports, sustainability and social purpose,\" according to his biography on the Danish royal website.\n\nThe couple's first child, Prince Christian, was born in 2005. Their second child, Princess Isabella, was born in 2007, and they welcomed twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine in 2011."
