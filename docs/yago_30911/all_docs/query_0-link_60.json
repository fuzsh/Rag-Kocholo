        "text": "Princess Marie and her husband Prince Joachim may not have been in Denmark for the 175th anniversary of the Danish constitution, but they still marked the occasion in patriotic style. For a special event honoring the historic day, the royals visited the Danish embassy in Washington, D.C. where Joachim serves as a defense attaché. The prince wore official military dress, and Marie chose a bold red dress which paid homage to the red and white of the Danish flag.\n\nThe dress was remarkble not only for its stylish flair, but also for its accessible price point—the look, which features flattering ruching along one side and an asymmetrical neckline highlighted with a gold clasp, is . In fact, it's currently available for $70, making it an economical way to get a bit of royal style into your closet. Not to miss a great high-low moment, Marie paired the affordable style with a timeless set of in gold, as well as a gold bracelet and neutral-toned heels.\n\nJoachim and Marie moved to D.C. after a tense period in the Danish royal family in recent years. Though Joachim is the brother of King Frederik and the younger son of the former Queen Margrethe, his and Marie's children (along with Joachim's two children from a previous marriage) had their titles removed in 2023 while Margrethe was still on the throne. The move was announced so that the children could \"shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited by the special considerations and duties that a formal affiliation with the Royal House of Denmark as an institution involves.\""
