        "text": "Shrink Wrapped. Still in the original factory shrink wrap, with condition visible through shrink noted. For example, \"SW (NM)\" means shrink wrapped in near-mint condition.\n\nNear Mint. Like new with only the slightest wear, many times indistinguishable from a Mint item. Close to perfect, very collectible.\n\nBoard & war games in this condition will show very little to no wear and are considered to be punched unless the condition note says unpunched.\n\nExcellent. Lightly used, but almost like new. May show very small spine creases or slight corner wear. Absolutely no tears and no marks, a collectible condition.\n\nVery Good. Used. May have medium-sized creases, corner dings, minor tears or scuff marks, small stains, etc. Complete and very useable."
