        "text": "90 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nSecond, Pagan Publishing was able to look in different directions from the\n\nnorm of the Call of Cthulhu line, and was also willing to try bold new experiments.\n\nThis was seen early on with their alternative settings, and it really culminated in\n\nDelta Green, which managed to reimagine the Cthulhu Mythos in a very modern,\n\nyet still very recognizable form and one which offered a truly viable alternative era\n\nfor Cthulhu games.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, Pagan Publishing had the huge advantage\n\nof never actually being a professional publishing house, despite their attempt in\n\n1994. This isn’t reflective of the quality of their publications, which were generally\n\ntop-notch. Instead it reflects the fact that Pagan Publishing didn’t have to worry\n\nabout paying the bills. They didn’t have staff, nor warehouses, nor offices. If they\n\nwanted they could take a whole year working on a single book, and they often did;\n\nif a full-time publishing house had tried the same, they’d quickly be out of business.\n\nYears later Tynes would say that he wished he’d set Pagan Publishing up as a non-\n\nprofit, and that really encapsulates the feelings that the Pagan authors had about\n\nmaking top-quality books — not a living. Any largely volunteer organization,\n\ngiven the appropriate skills and talents — which Pagan had in spades — can easily\n\nproduce better products than any second- or third-tier RPG company as a simple\n\nmatter of economics, and that’s the superior position that Pagan Publishing was\n\nworking from.\n\nUnfortunately, spending years sweating over products for a company that ulti-\n\nmately doesn’t show profit can also quickly lead to burnout, and that too seems to\n\nbe what happened at Pagan Publishing.\n\nBy 2002, all of the original Pagan authors would have largely moved on from\n\nthe company they founded.\n\nThe Time of Transition: 1998–2004\n\nThe Pagan staff started moving on to other things in 1998.\n\nBlair Reynolds, the original inspirational artist behind Pagan Publishing, had\n\nleft the gaming industry in 1994 due to general discontent. Most of his focus\n\nafterward went to his erotic Cthulhu comic, Black Sands. The first issue was pub-\n\nlished in 1996 and never followed up on. He made a brief return to the industry\n\nin 1997, illustrating Biohazard’s Blue Planet (1997), The Realm of Shadows (1997),\n\nand painting the cover to Delta Green: Countdown (1999) — which appears to be\n\nhis final published RPG work for the next decade. He also contributed a story to\n\nDelta Green: Alien Intelligence (1998).\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Pagan Publishing: 1990-Present 91\n\nJohn H. Crowe III, one of the most\n\nprolific authors at Pagan, published his last\n\nbook, Mortal Coils, in 1998. For the next\n\ndecade, he remained involved only as a\n\nmember of the editorial staff.\n\nBrian Appleton likewise remained on pri-\n\nmarily as a member of the editorial staff. He\n\nwas the editor for Pagan’s last reprint book,\n\nThe Resurrected III: Out of the Vault (2002),\n\nwhich collected 10 adventures from the first\n\n10 issues of The Unspeakable Oath.\n\nJohn Tynes went to work for Daedalus\n\nfollowing his year with Wizards of the Coast.\n\nUnfortunately, they were gone by 1997. In\n\n1998, Tynes put out his first major publication for a publisher other than Pagan:\n\nUnknown Armies, which he co-authored with Greg Stolze, and which was pub-\n\nlished by Atlas Games, who had acquired some of Daedalus’ properties. The Atlas\n\nhistory talks more about Unknown Armies.\n\nAnother original RPG system, Puppetland, would follow in 1999, this time\n\nfor Hogshead Publishing; the rights to it were later purchased by Sweetpea\n\nEntertainment, the owner of Imperium Games and the maker of the Dungeons &\n\nDragons movie. The Hogshead history contains some additional notes on the game.\n\nMeanwhile, Dennis Detwiller was working on a new RPG called Godlike, a\n\nsuperhero game set in the 1930s and 1940s. Tynes had originally suggested its\n\ndevelopment to Detwiller so that Pagan could finally (again!) put out their own\n\nRPG. However, Pagan wouldn’t produce this third attempt at an RPG either.\n\nInstead it would ultimately be published in 2001 by newcomer Hobgoblynn Press\n\n— primarily because of Pagan’s very slow production schedule. Detwiller has since\n\nformed Arc Dream Publishing, which we’ll return to momentarily.\n\nOn January 1, 2001, John Tynes announced to his partners that he was getting\n\nout of the roleplaying biz. He said that he expected to be done with the field by\n\n2002. Adam Scott Glancy, who had joined Pagan to write Delta Green, was named\n\nthe new president of Pagan, but he inherited a company that had lost most of its\n\ncreative force.\n\nAt the last moment, John Tynes was offered a final hoorah. He was contracted\n\nby Wizards of the Coast to write the background material for the d20 version of\n\nCall of Cthulhu, which had been licensed to Wizards by Chaosium. Tynes accepted\n\n9 2 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nthe contract and produced the material with help from the Pagan crew. While\n\nwriting the book, he continued to try and work against the Call of Cthulhu status\n\nquo. In particular, he rebelled against the codification of the Cthulhu Mythos so\n\nprevalent in the Chaosium RPG material, and instead tried to imbue the game\n\nwith a new sense of wonder and horror.\n\nThe book was completed in 2002, meeting Tynes’ deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, Pagan Publishing was putting out the last books that would define\n\nits original run, including their final magazine, The Unspeakable Oath #16/17\n\n(2001), the aforementioned final Resurrected, and Armitage House’s final books: a\n\ncollection called Delta Green: Dark Theatres (2001) and Dennis Detwiller’s novel,\n\nDelta Green: Denied to the Enemy (2004).\n\nBy the time of that final publication, Pagan was already becoming a brand for\n\nthe individual creators, rather than its own publishing house. Volunteer-run or not,\n\nin 2004 Pagan Publishing was effectively gone.\n\nWhich Can Eternal Lie: 2004-Present\n\nFor a while, it looked like Pagan Publishing was gone forever after its final 2004\n\nrelease. However, some of its principals — most notably Adam Scott Glancy,\n\nDennis Detwiller, and John H. Crowe III — have stayed in the business and\n\nthrough their more recent enterprises they’ve managed to provide Pagan with\n\npublishing partners who have been able to continue writing and/or publishing\n\nmaterial for Pagan.\n\nThe first of Pagan’s partners was EOS Press, the 2003 resurrection of\n\nHobgoblynn Press. Not only were they based in Seattle — like the Pagan crew\n\n— but they were also connected to them through Dennis Detwiller, whose game\n\nGodlike (2001) was the basis of the company. EOS published a new edition\n\nof Pagan’s Creatures & Cultists (2004)\n\nthemselves, but when EOS printed a d20\n\nedition of Delta Green (2007) — years after\n\nWizards’ d20 Call of Cthulhu had dropped\n\nout of print — it was with Glancy and using\n\nthe Pagan trademark.\n\nBy 2008, Crowe and Appleton were\n\nwilling to get back into the Call of Cthulhu\n\ngame. They published Final Flight (2008),\n\nThe Mysteries of Mesoamerica (2009), and\n\nBumps in the Night (2012) through Pagan.\n\nThough the first was a disappointment in its\n\nrudimentary layout, the three books showed\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Pagan Publishing: 1990-Present 93\n\nthat five years later, Pagan was willing and\n\nable to put out original books.\n\nHowever, the true future of Pagan seems\n\nto be with a new publishing partner, Arc\n\nDream Publishing — Dennis Detwiller’s\n\nRPG company. Arc Dream kicked things\n\noff with a collection of Detwiller’s old\n\nDelta Green chapbooks, Delta Green: Eyes\n\nOnly (2007), which they created and Pagan\n\npublished. They’ve more recently developed\n\nDelta Green: Targets of Opportunity (2010) —\n\nthe first entirely original Delta Green RPG\n\nmaterial in over a decade — and taken over\n\nthe publication of Pagan’s premiere magazine,\n\nstarting with The Unspeakable Oath #18 (December 2010). Their own history\n\ntalks more about their various roleplaying efforts.\n\nTwo decades after its creation, Pagan has died and (sort of ) been reborn.\n\nThrough the enthusiasm of its principals, it looks that their high-quality Cthulhu\n\nproducts will continue into their third decade.\n\nWhat to Read Next 9\n\n• For the future of Blue Planet, read Fantasy Flight Games and RedBrick\n\n[’00s].\n\n• For John Tynes’ one-time employer, read Wizards of the Coast, and for\n\nhis other-time employer, read the Daedalus Games mini-history in Atlas\n\nGames.\n\n• For other major publishers of Tynes’ works, read Atlas Games and\n\nHogshead Publishing.\n\nIn Other Eras 780\n\n• For Pagan’s main licensor, read Chaosium [’70s].\n\n• For the future of Dennis Detwiller and The Unspeakable Oath, read Arc\n\nDream Publishing [’00s].\n\n• For more recent new takes on the Cthulhu Mythos, read Cubicle 7\n\nEntertainment [’00s] and Pelgrane Press [’00s].\n\nOr read onward to another company that got its start with a magazine, AEG.\n\nAEG:\n\n1990-Present\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group — or AEG — started off as a\n\nmagazine publisher and ended up influencing the direction of\n\nthe entire industry — ironically including themselves.\n\nShadis Beginnings: 1990–1991\n\nThe Story of Alderac Entertainment Group\n\n— or The Alderac Group, as it was called in\n\nits earliest incarnation — begins with a mag-\n\nazine, as is the case with many young pub-\n\nlishers. Shadis began publication in January\n\n1990. In his first editorial, editor Jolly R.\n\nBlackburn noted the fact that there were\n\nonly two RPG magazines on the market —\n\npresumably talking about Dragon and White\n\nWolf, and probably bemoaning the loss of\n\nWhite Dwarf, which was just then moving\n\nfully over to miniatures support. Shadis\n\nmade three.\n\n1990: Shadis #1\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 95\n\n“Shadis was conceived from our opinion that the Role-playing hobby is in serious\n\nneed of more magazines, fanzines, newsletters, etc. devoted to the cause.”\n\n— Jolly R. Blackburn, “Backroom Murmuring,” Shadis #1 (January 1990)\n\nThe original Shadis magazine was a black & white digest, more a fanzine than\n\na professional magazine. Besides gaming articles — largely written by Blackburn\n\n— each issue also featured several pieces of fiction collectively called the “Alderac\n\nAnthology,” all detailing Blackburn’s world of Alderac. The name of the magazine\n\nalso referred to this game world, with Shadis being one of Alderac’s moons.\n\nFor its first year, through Shadis #6 (December 1990), the magazine continued\n\nin this vein, though with one notable addition: in Shadis #2 (March/April 1990),\n\nBlackburn began to publish a comic that he was writing called “Knights of the\n\nDinner Table.” It depicted the humorous interactions of a gaming group, and\n\nthough other similar comics such as John Kovalic’s Dork Tower have since appeared,\n\nat the time Knights was ground-breaking … and a hit. When Blackburn published\n\nthat first Knights, he thought that he was just filling a blank page, but when he\n\ntried to replace it with more professional strips beginning with Shadis #6, there\n\nwas an outcry.\n\nBecause of that outcry, the Knights soon returned, but in the meantime the\n\nAlderac Group faced its first major setback: Operation Desert Storm ( January-\n\nFebruary 1991), the first US invasion of Iraq. Blackburn was then a sergeant in\n\nthe army, and the new conflict took him to the Middle East. The result would be\n\na long hiatus, with nothing more appearing from Alderac for a full year and a half.\n\nIt could easily have been the end.\n\nShadis After the War: 1992–1995\n\nSurprisingly, Blackburn and Alderac reappeared in 1992, and they decided not\n\njust to continue from where they’d stopped, but also to move onward and upward.\n\nTo begin with, the Alderac Group expanded, taking on two more partners, John\n\nZinser and David Seay; they would be pivotal to the future of the company. In\n\naddition, when Shadis #7 (Summer 1992) was published, it not only had become\n\nfull-sized, but it also sported a three-color cover.\n\nThings continued to improve from there. For Shadis #9 (September 1993) the\n\nmagazine’s cover went full-color. The Alderac Anthology was dropped at the same\n\ntime, and Shadis truly became a professional magazine. 10,000 copies were given\n\nout at Gen Con ’93, the exact same technique that White Wolf Magazine had used\n\nsix years previous when they broke into the ranks of professional publication. Issue\n\n#9 was also when Shadis adopted the slogan “The Independent Games Magazine”;\n\n96 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nover the next issues they made serious\n\npromises of future independence, much like\n\nWhite Wolf had in its early days.\n\nBy Shadis #11 ( January/February 1994)\n\nThe Alderac Group had officially become\n\n“Alderac Entertainment Group” and had\n\ntaken another step up in professionalism\n\nwith a new logo and a new art director,\n\nKristy Keefe. Mark Arsenault, best known\n\nfor his work at Gold Rush Games, also\n\nstarted writing for Shadis with that issue.\n\nAlongside these Alderac expansions,\n\nShadis was riding the CCG wave that\n\nwas cresting over the whole industry. This began with Shadis #10 (November/\n\nDecember 1993), which featured the first ever CCG collector’s list. Alderac got\n\neven more attention with Shadis #15 (September/October 1994), which was\n\nsupposed to contain original promotional Magic cards from Wizards of the Coast.\n\nUnfortunately, Wizards backed out of the program almost as soon as they\n\nannounced it. This rapid-fire reneging clearly demonstrated the volatility of the\n\nindustry during the initial CCG boom. 120,000 orders came in for the magazine in\n\nthe first three days after Shadis’ announcement of the promos — and were promptly\n\ncut back afterward. Alderac ended up buying Magic: Legends (1994) cards on their\n\nown and inserted them into the magazine. They continued this trend with #16\n\n(November/December 1994), which included Magic: The Dark (1994) cards.\n\nAround the same time, Shadis began doing one of the weirder things ever done\n\nby an RPG magazine. Though Shadis was at the time bimonthly, following issue\n\n#17 ( January/February 1995) Alderac began filling the odd months with Shadis\n\nPresents. This “new” magazine continued the Shadis numbering, but each of the\n\nPresents issues was a half, beginning with #17.5. Shadis Presents was mostly like\n\nShadis, except each issue focused on a specific topic: #17.5 (February 1995) was\n\n“The World of Collectible Card Games”; #18.5 (April 1995) was “It Came from\n\nHollywood”; #19.5 ( June 1995) was “All Things Dark and Dangerous”; and #20.5\n\n(August 1995), the last, was “On Tour.” To a certain extent, the idea was doomed\n\nfrom its infancy, because Alderac was giving away all the Shadis Presents issues to\n\nsubscribers for free. However, by August 1995 there were bigger changes looming\n\nfor Shadis and Alderac alike.\n\nAs far back as 1994, it had been obvious that Blackburn and his partners were\n\nheading in different directions. Zinser and Seay were more interested in hitting\n\nit big in the burgeoning CCG industry, while Blackburn preferred the small,\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 97\n\nfun business he began in 1990. Blackburn\n\nexplained it best by quoting a friend, who\n\nsaid, “Jolly, you wanted a grass-roots\n\ncompany and your partners are aiming for\n\nthe stars.”\n\nThis split was best seen in the 1994\n\nproduction of Alderac. Zinser was working\n\non an original CCG — which we’ll return\n\nto shortly — while Blackburn was instead\n\nworking to publish Knights of the Dinner\n\nTable as a comic book, the first three issues of\n\nwhich appeared from Alderac over the next\n\nyear (1994–1995).\n\n“So to say it was a bit of a shock when I told my partners I wanted them to buy me\n\nout is something of an understatement. In fact, I had a hard time convincing them\n\nthat I was serious.”\n\n— Jolly R. Blackburn, “Cries from the Attic,”\n\nKnights of the Dinner Table #100 (February 2005)\n\nAs a result of these different interests, Jolly Blackburn left Alderac, the company\n\nhe had founded, in 1995. His final issue was Shadis #21 (October/November\n\n1995), after which the magazine came under the editorship of D.J. Trindle. Trindle\n\nopted not to run a Shadis Presents #21.5, instead revamping the magazine with\n\nissue #22 (December 1995) and then taking it monthly.\n\nThough he’d left Alderac, Blackburn kept the rights to the Knights of the Dinner\n\nTable. He went on to publish Knights of the\n\nDinner Table #4 (1996) on his own, then\n\nformed a new partnership with Kenzer &\n\nCompany, as is more fully described in that\n\ncompany’s history.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the Alderac\n\nEntertainment Group — now known as\n\nAEG — was indeed aiming for the stars.\n\nRemarkably, they’d reach them and would\n\nend up having a pivotal influence on the\n\nentire industry as a result.\n\n9 8 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nFive Rings,A CCG Interlude: 1994–2000\n\nAEG’s new CCG project would eventually be called Legend of the Five Rings\n\n(L5R). It was born of a conversation between John Zinser and David Seay that\n\nlamented the loss of FGU’s old RPG, Bushido (1980). That got them thinking\n\nabout producing a Bushido CCG, and AEG began to negotiate for the property.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the properties of former publisher FGU remain in\n\nlimbo, and AEG may have run into this issue. There was definitely some problem\n\nbecause AEG newcomer John Wick — brought on board thanks to his high-qual-\n\nity contributions to Shadis — described the acquisition as “in flux” when he joined\n\nthe company. Wick also had considerable experience with Japanese history and\n\nculture; this provided the impetus for AEG to create their own Asian-influenced\n\nfantasy world, which would be the foundation of Legend of the Five Rings.\n\nThe whole company became involved in the project — including Ryan Dancey,\n\nthe owner of an ISP called ISOMEDIA, which was helping to fund the game. The\n\nL5R CCG was released in 1995. It was generally well-received, both because it\n\nhad an original game system that wasn’t derivative of Magic and because it had a\n\ncolorful and coherent storyline that was advanced from set to set.\n\nHowever, for the RPG industry, what happened next was much more important.\n\nIn 1996, the principals behind the L5R CCG realized that they didn’t have the\n\nmoney to print a L5R expansion. They then decided that they could better serve\n\nthe game by creating a new, better-funded company. The result was Five Rings\n\nPublishing Group. Robert Abramowitz headed a pool of investors funding the\n\ngroup, and became the president of the new company. Alderac and ISOMEDIA\n\neach gave over their rights in Legend of the Five Rings for appropriate ownership.\n\nRyan Dancey became VP of Product Development and John Zinser became VP of\n\nSales. Alderac still continued to do much of the design and development work for\n\nLegend of the Five Rings. They were also granted a license to produce a Legend of the\n\nFive Rings RPG game — which we’ll return to shortly.\n\nOver the next year, Five Rings Publishing was very active in the industry. They\n\nsigned an agreement with Last Unicorn Games to develop and publish Last\n\nUnicorn’s Dune CCG and a license with Pinnacle Entertainment to create a\n\nDeadlands CCG called Doomtown. They also obtained the rights to publish a Star\n\nTrek collectible dice game.\n\nThen, in early 1997, Five Rings Publishing stumbled upon the opportunity of\n\na lifetime. As is more fully documented in the histories of TSR and Wizards of\n\nthe Coast, TSR was by this time on the verge of bankruptcy and looking for a\n\nbuyer. After Dancey looked over TSR’s financials, Abramowitz was able to nego-\n\ntiate a deal for the purchase of TSR, which they then brought to Peter Adkison at\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 99\n\nWizards of the Coast. As part of the deal Adkison not only purchased TSR, but\n\nalso Five Rings Publishing itself.\n\n“Bob calls Peter and says, ‘I want you to loan me a million dollars.’ Peter says, ‘There’s\n\nnothing in the world you could tell me that would get me to loan you a million\n\ndollars.’ So Bob faxes Peter the cover letter of the letter of intent to buy TSR. And\n\nPeter calls him back in 10 minutes and says, ‘Would you accept a company check?’”\n\n— Ryan Dancey, 40 Years of Gen Con (2007)\n\nAt Wizards, Five Rings Publishing continued as a separate entity until the end\n\nof 1998. Last Unicorn’s Dune CCG (1997), the Doomtown CCG (1998), a Five\n\nRings spin-off called the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG (1998), and a new\n\nversion of White Wolf ’s Rage CCG (1998) all saw print over the next few years.\n\nThe Legend of the Five Rings CCG also saw continued publication, with design\n\nwork still coming from AEG.\n\nDuring this time period, Five Rings also experimented with one of the most\n\ninnovative changes to CCG distribution since Wizards had kicked it off several\n\nyears earlier. Five Ring’s Scorpion Clan Coup expansion (November 1997-January\n\n1998) pioneered a sales mechanism called “Rolling Thunder.” Instead of publish-\n\ning big CCG supplements a few times a year (as was common at the time), Five\n\nRings instead planned to release smaller supplements for nine months solid, then\n\ntake three months off. At the same time, they flattened the rarity of the Five Rings\n\nreleases — under the theory that card rarity would be replaced by the scarcity of\n\nsupplements that were come and be gone in a month.\n\nFive Rings was so confident that they quickly expanded Rolling Thunder to\n\nDoomtown, Legend of the Burning Sands, Rage, and Dune. It flopped. The problem\n\nwas that CCG players really wanted rarity. By expanding the idea immediately to\n\nfive games, Five Rings also ensured that they had no time to debug the concept.\n\nAt the end of 1998, the Five Rings group was dissolved as a separate entity. Ryan\n\nDancey became the business head of the Roleplaying Department at Wizards,\n\neffectively making him the major decision-maker in brand-related RPG issues. In\n\nthat position he not only contributed to the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons\n\n— which was announced that summer at the 1999 Gen Con Game Fair — but also\n\nconceived of an open gaming d20 license that would impact the entire industry for\n\nyears to come.\n\nRyan Dancey’s rise from ISOMEDIA through Five Rings Publishing to Wizards\n\nof the Coast is astounding, as is the impact he’s had on the industry, and it can all\n\nbe traced back to the decision to create a Bushido-like card game in 1994 and before\n\nthat to Jolly Blackburn’s decision to put out a little fanzine called Shadis.\n\n100 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nFive Rings & Seven Seas,The RPGs: 1997–2000\n\nMeanwhile, AEG was continuing to publish\n\nShadis magazine. Following the death of\n\nWhite Wolf Magazine in 1995, it was really\n\nthe only independent magazine around.\n\nBeyond Shadis, much of the company’s\n\nattention had been focused on Five Rings\n\nPublishing Group and the Legend of the Five\n\nRings CCG. That changed in 1997, thanks\n\nto the license AEG had received to publish\n\na Five Rings RPG.\n\nTo take advantage of this license, John\n\nWick led an RPG design team that created\n\na system that was fairly typical of game\n\ndesign in the late ’90s — with White Wolf ’s\n\nStoryteller System and West End’s d6 system\n\nthe most obvious inspirations. The main mechanic was the “roll and keep” die\n\nsystem, with the all-important “keep” contributed by Marcelo Figureroa. For\n\ntask resolution, players roll additive dice pools based upon the sum value of an\n\nappropriate skill and trait; however they can only keep a number of dice equal to\n\nthe value of the trait. These remaining dice are added together and compared to a\n\ntarget number.\n\nThe Legend of the Five Rings RPG (1997) was generally well-received — as\n\nmuch because of the L5R setting of Rokugan as the game system. It was the first\n\nsuccessful Asian-influenced RPG since\n\nancient products from the ’80s like the\n\naforementioned Bushido and TSR’s Oriental\n\nAdventures (1985). An astounding 30 sup-\n\nplements followed over the next few years,\n\ncapped by a second edition of the rules\n\n(2000).\n\nMeanwhile AEG had published a second\n\nRPG, 7th Sea (1999), co-designed by John\n\nWick, Jennifer Wick, and Kevin Wilson. It\n\nfollowed the successful recipe of Legend\n\nof the Five Rings to a tee. Its background\n\ncentered on a popular, visceral genre (here\n\nswashbuckling rather than martial arts)\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 101\n\nadapted to a fictional world (here Théah rather than Rokugan). Like Legend of the\n\nFive Rings, 7th Sea used the roll and keep game system, and even moreso than its\n\npredecessor, it received a lot of critical acclaim. It was supplemented by the inevi-\n\ntable (and long-lived) CCG (1998–2005). 7th Sea was Wick’s last major work for\n\nAEG. He’d go on to found three indie companies and self-publish numerous RPGs,\n\nas is detailed in the history of John Wick Presents.\n\nAEG was simultaneously increasing their focus on RPGs in their other business\n\ndealings. This was demonstrated when the AEG principals invested in Pinnacle\n\nEntertainment Group, the publishers of Deadlands and the licensors of Five Rings’\n\nDoomtown CCG. At the same time, AEG took over most of the business dealings\n\nof Pinnacle, leaving them as a design house.\n\nThe deal is more closely detailed in Pinnacle’s history. In the end it didn’t work\n\nout because of the distance between the two companies — with Pinnacle working\n\nout of Virginia and AEG working out of California — and because AEG was\n\nputting more focus on their own RPGs.\n\nShortly before Pinnacle and AEG dissolved their relationship, Matt Forbeck —\n\none of the Pinnacle partners — left his company and came over to AEG. He simul-\n\ntaneously sold a dystopic superhero RPG called Brave New World to AEG. Over the\n\nnext year, Forbeck worked at AEG on salary to produce over a half-dozen books for\n\nhis RPG, starting with Defiants (1999). It was a strong third roleplaying line for AEG.\n\nAs they were ramping up their RPG production, AEG closed down their mag-\n\nazine, Shadis. As is often the case, AEG decided that a magazine was too expensive\n\nand time-consuming to put out when compared to higher-return supplements.\n\nShadis came to an end with issue #54 (December 1998).\n\nSailing into the year 2000, AEG was following a path that would have been\n\nentirely successful for an RPG company of\n\nthe ’80s. They’d created a successful house\n\nsystem and used it to publish two colorful,\n\noriginal RPG worlds. Each had won the\n\nOrigins Award for “Best Roleplaying Game”\n\nfor its year of release, showing the games’\n\ngeneral appeal with fans. However, the\n\nwhole industry was changing, and these old\n\nformulas no longer guaranteed success.\n\nThe d20 Years: 2000–2004\n\nAs we are reminded of in every company\n\nhistory that crosses over into 2000, at the\n\n2000 Gen Con Game Fair, Wizards of the\n\n1 02 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nCoast released the third edition of Dungeons\n\n& Dragons alongside the d20 license. It\n\nchanged the industry. AEG jumped onto the\n\nd20 bandwagon that December with the pro-\n\nduction of their “Adventure Keep” adventures.\n\nThese pamphlet-sized adventures were\n\njust 16 pages long and released for the low\n\nprice point of $2.49, the cost of a comic\n\nbook or a cup of coffee. There was nothing\n\nparticularly stand-out about them, but\n\nthey got AEG into the d20 system through\n\nvolume. Eight different adventures were\n\npublished that December — from Castle\n\nZadrian (2000) to The Crypt of St. Bethesda\n\n(2000) — and more sets of adventures con-\n\ntinued to pour out over the next few years. By the time AEG brought their flood of\n\nd20 adventures to an end in 2002, they had published about 50 of them.\n\nGenerally, AEG did a good job of managing the changing state of the d20\n\nmarket. When the adventure market was thoroughly glutted in 2002, they got out.\n\nSimultaneously, they began publishing more general sourcebooks, running from\n\nDungeons (2001) through almost two dozen books to Secrets (2004).\n\nAEG also began producing their own d20-based RPGs. The first was the\n\nFarscape RPG (2002), a d20-based game focused on the sci-fi TV show (1999–\n\n2003). However, AEG’s most innovative d20 work came through Spycraft (2002),\n\na modern-day d20 espionage game. It was the first modern d20 game to hit the\n\nmarket — predating Wizards’ own d20 Modern Roleplaying Game (2002) by a\n\nfew months — and would ultimately be one of the most successful. Spycraft was\n\nfollowed by Stargate SG:1 RPG (2003) — also based on a TV show (1997–2007)\n\n— which was entirely compatible with first-edition Spycraft.\n\nFarscape never got any support, perhaps due to the impending cancelation of\n\nthe show. Spycraft, conversely, received over a dozen supplements in the next two\n\nyears, including Shadowforce Archer (2002), which created an espionage and con-\n\nspiracy setting for the game. Finally, Stargate SG:1 started receiving season guides\n\nand other supplements, but just when AEG was getting into the swing of things,\n\nMGM decided to pull their license —the result being that the RPG never got to\n\ncover more than the first two seasons of the show.\n\nPerhaps it was for the best, because the d20 market was growing increasingly\n\nweak, and AEG was on its way out of it. 2004 saw the final publications for AEG’s\n\nfirst edition of Spycraft. Likewise, AEG’s last few d20 sourcebooks appeared. If the\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 103\n\nStargate SG:1 license hadn’t been pulled\n\nby MGM, AEG would probably have had\n\na hard time keeping it alive in the post-d20\n\nmarket anyway.\n\nBefore it got out of the d20 business\n\nentirely, AEG released two final publica-\n\ntions of note, almost a coda to their four\n\nyears of d20 work. The first was The World’s\n\nLargest Dungeon (2004), advertised as being\n\nthe largest d20 sourcebook ever produced. It\n\ncontained 960,000 words of text and every\n\nmonster in the d20 SRD, spread out over\n\n840 pages. AEG estimated that it would\n\nprovide two years’ worth of adventuring and\n\nwas not just the largest d20 book, but also the largest RPG book ever (to that date).\n\nWorld’s Largest City (2006), a 704-page book, followed a few years later.\n\nKeeping Roll and Keep: 2001–2005\n\nAEG’s dip into the d20 pond did not stop the production of their own games —\n\nbut those games were heavily influenced by the d20 industry. That started with\n\nLegend of the Five Rings, which was on particularly shaky ground because AEG’s\n\nL5R RPG license from Five Rings ended in 2000 Though the new owner of\n\nL5R — Wizards of the Coast — decided that AEG could continue to publish\n\nsecond-edition material for L5R’s original gaming system, Wizards was simultane-\n\nously working on a d20 campaign setting book for the world of Rokugan.\n\nHowever, Wizards at the time often didn’t know if it was coming or going —\n\nprobably a result of the clash between the creative culture of Wizards and the\n\ncorporate culture of Hasbro. At the same time Wizards planned to increase their\n\ninvestment in Rokugan through CCG and RPG products, Wizards was also\n\ndivesting itself of less successful lines … lines like Legend of the Five Rings.\n\nAEG was able to win back rights to all of the Legend of the Five Rings properties\n\nin early 2001. Over the course of that year, they published a number of second-\n\nedition books including Winter Court and “Way” supplements — expanding two\n\nsplatbook lines that had started with the previous edition — but it sort of felt like\n\nthey were treading water. Then, in October 2001, Wizards finally produced the\n\nsetting book they had in process for over a year: James Wyatt’s Oriental Adventures\n\n(2001), which offered new d20 rules for Asian-influenced realms, some of them\n\nspecific to the world of Rokugan.\n\n104 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nAfter that, all of the L5R rights were back\n\nin AEG’s hands. Showing remarkable coor-\n\ndination, AEG immediately began supple-\n\nmenting Wizards’ Oriental Adventures. Their\n\nfirst release, Rokugan Oriental Adventures\n\nCampaign Setting (2001) — which expanded\n\nupon Wizards’ sourcebook and in some places\n\nsuperseded it — came out just two months\n\nafter Oriental Adventures, in December 2001.\n\nTwo more d20 books followed over the next\n\ncouple of months: Creatures of Rokugan\n\n(2002) and Magic of Rokugan (2002). After\n\nthat, the rest of AEG’s second-edition L5R\n\nbooks were published with dual stats for d20\n\nand L5R’s original system and with Wizards’ Oriental Adventures branding.\n\nThis dual-statted line continued into 2005.\n\nAEG did the same thing to their 7th Sea game, replacing the original game line\n\nwith a new Swashbuckling Adventures (2002) line; like the Oriental Adventures\n\nbooks, these books were dual-statted for “roll and keep” and for d20. As we’ll see, it\n\nsort of continued into 2005 too.\n\nSadly, Brave New World didn’t survive the d20 years. Its last publication was\n\nCovenant (2001). After that AEG let the line lapse — though Forbeck himself\n\nrecently used Kickstarter to fund the production of a trilogy of Brave New World\n\nnovels (2012) as part of his “12 for ’12” initiative where he wrote 12 novels in\n\n12 months. AEG, meanwhile, has occasionally talked about Hollywood deals for\n\nBrave New World, suggesting that their interest in the line isn’t dead either.\n\nRoleplaying Retrenchment: 2005–2008\n\n2001 and 2002 probably saw the height of AEG’s RPG publication. After that, as\n\nthe d20 market has slowly faded away, so did AEG’s roleplaying output. But it didn’t\n\ndisappear entirely. Starting in 2005, AEG retrenched their most important lines by\n\nmoving further away from d20 and instead highlighting their own unique properties.\n\nLegend of the Five Rings came back in a third edition (2005) that returned the\n\ngame to its roll and keep roots. It took another year to get things really rolling, but a\n\ntrickle of games slowly increased. 2008 was the best year for the new edition of the\n\ngame, seeing a revised edition of the rules (2008), a companion game called Legend\n\nof the Burning Sands (2008), plus three supplements, with two more out at the print-\n\ners: Masters of Magic (2009) and Fealty and Freedom (2009) would appear in January\n\nof the next year.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 105\n\nSpycraft also got a second edition (2005). It changed the game from a d20\n\nsupplement, dependent upon the tyrannies of Wizards of the Coast releases, to a\n\nfull-fledged OGL game. It was the same path that other d20 games were taking in\n\nthe wake of the d20 crash. The new edition also expanded the espionage focus of\n\nthe original game to cover more types of modern gameplay. Unfortunately, shortly\n\nafterward AEG decided that they couldn’t support any of their old lines except\n\nLegend of the Five Rings in the tough post-d20 market, and so ended Spycraft\n\nsupport. This gave the creators of Spycraft the opportunity to buy their game; they\n\ndid, forming Crafty Games to manage its future.\n\nSwashbuckling Adventures sadly didn’t get the dignity of a new edition. Its last\n\nfew dual-statted publications were released as PDFs in 2005, and then the line was\n\nclosed down. AEG still owns the rights to it.\n\nDespite periodic Legend of the Five Rings RPG supplements, AEG’s main busi-\n\nness once more became CCGs. This focused on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG\n\nand Warlord: Saga of the Storm (2001), a CCG that drew some game mechanics\n\nfrom the d20 system. Although not as heavily story-oriented as its other CCGs,\n\nAEG also supported Warlord with a series of RPG supplements called Warlords of the\n\nAccordlands (2006). Production on the Warlord CCG continued up through 2008.\n\nToward the Future: 2009-Present\n\nBy 2009 AEG was down to just one RPG, Legend of the Five Rings. Based on\n\nthe output of the previous 12 months, you might have assumed that it would be\n\nwell-supported, but it was not to be; Fealty and Freedom would be the last L5R\n\nbook for at least a year and a half.\n\nBut AEG wasn’t abandoning the line; instead they had decided that another\n\nnew edition was necessary. In his design\n\ndocument for that new edition, Shawn\n\nCarman highlighted four goals for L5R’s\n\nlatest iteration: “divorcing the story from the\n\nmechanics”; “simplification and streamlining\n\nof mechanics”; “intuitive organization”; and\n\n“unified voice.”\n\nSince the release of the fourth edition\n\n(2010), Carman has stayed closely involved\n\nwith L5R’s fans through a monthly column\n\non RPGnet. He’s also shepherded about\n\none L5R book to publication each quarter,\n\nwith highlights including the Second City\n\n(2012) boxed set and the Imperial Histories\n\nMini-History 1 06 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\n(2012), which considerably expands the game by offering up different eras for play.\n\nA similar production schedule has long served Atlas Games well, allowing them\n\nto constantly support their well-received Ars Magica game despite having turned\n\ntheir production mainly toward card games. Therefore, the future of L5R currently\n\nlooks bright.\n\n“The RPG market has changed dramatically over the past few years. A combination\n\nof factors, the most significant of which is likely online gaming, has dramatically\n\nreduced sales across the board for the industry. In order to survive in this envi-\n\nronment, a fourth edition of L5R is going to have to expand its customer base\n\nbeyond the loyal following we have developed over the years. New customers\n\nare essential to the game’s ongoing success, and in order to gain them, we must\n\nfollow several clear mandates.”\n\n— Shawn Carman, “Legend of the Five Rings Fourth Edition Design Document,”\n\nalderac.com (2009)\n\nCrafty Games: 2005-Present\n\nThough AEG decided in 2005 that Spycraft wasn’t profitable, the designers of the\n\nsecond edition weren’t so sure. As a result, Alex Flagg and Patrick Kapera pur-\n\nchased the rights to the game from AEG and formed Crafty Games to control them.\n\nFor the first year and a half they supported the game with a PDF line, but in 2007\n\nthat changed.\n\nThat year Crafty Games signed an agreement with Mongoose Publishing, who\n\nwas just then putting together their “Flaming Cobra” imprint, which would print\n\nbooks by independent publishers via Mongoose’s own presses (or so the theory\n\nwent at the time; Mongoose’s own history discusses the problems with the process).\n\nThe result was a new revised second printing of Spycraft 2.0 (2008).\n\nDespite a deal with Mongoose, Crafty Games never published a lot through\n\nthem. Instead, they continued to publish numerous PDFs. However, Mongoose got\n\ntheir biggest products and made sure they got out to larger audiences than PDFs\n\ncould reach. This was important, because it meant that when Crafty retrofitted the\n\nmechanics of what they were now calling their “Mastercraft” system into a fantasy\n\ngame, it got great distribution. As a result Fantasy Craft (2009) was one of the great\n\npost-d20 hits of the year (the other being Paizo’s Pathfinder, which was admittedly\n\na bigger hit). The Mastercraft logo, however, has been a bit less successful — while\n\nCrafty intends to use it to mark games that share some core ideas, fans seem more\n\nintent on those games being fully compatible.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 AEG: 1990-Present 107\n\nMeanwhile, AEG also seems to be planning for a post-CCG market. In 2009,\n\nthey kicked off a major new line of board games, intended to sell to the increas-\n\ningly large market pioneered by eurogames over the past decade. They published\n\nalmost a dozen board and card games that year, but there was only one of particular\n\nnote: Thunderstone (2009).\n\nThunderstone was a descendent of Rio Grande Games’ Dominion (2008), which\n\nhad opened up a new genre of entertainment: the “deckbuilding game.” The idea\n\nof deckbuilding games was originally drawn from Magic: The Gathering (1993)\n\nand other CCGs, where players build competitive decks from a larger set of cards.\n\nDominion moved that deckbuilding into the actual gameplay. Over the course of a\n\ngame, Dominion players buy cards, shuffle them into their decks, and play them to\n\nimprove their buying capabilities.\n\nWhereas Dominion offered generic medieval play, Thunderstone instead\n\npresented a fantasy setting, making it one of the most interesting deckbuild-\n\ning games for roleplayers. Thunderstone players use standard deckbuilding\n\nmechanics to gather together groups of adventurers (and weapons) that can\n\nAfter the release of Fantasy Craft, Crafty Games devoted most of its attention\n\nfor the next year to the release of PDFs for their new game. They then ended their\n\nagreement with Mongoose in March 2010, feeling newly ready to go it on their own.\n\nFantasy Craft print books followed.\n\nAmidst continued Fantasy Craft support in recent years, Crafty Games also pub-\n\nlished a brand-new RPG, Mistborn Adventure Game (2011, 2012) — a licensed release\n\nbased on Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn novels.\n\nMistborn was a big departure for Crafty because it features a new game system\n\nrather than a d20 derivative. The system is intended to be rules-light and narra-\n\ntive-based — creating the basis of what Crafty Games calls their “indie line.” It features\n\na dice pool that’s uniquely resource-based — meaning that you decide how much\n\nof the pool to use, saving some dice for things like defense. The heart of the game\n\nis (like Sanderson’s books) a strong and unique magic system. Mistborn has been\n\nwell-received and seems to have gotten more retail notice than most of Crafty’s other\n\nreleases to date, likely due to its strong license.\n\nCrafty’s releases appear to have slowed down since the print releases of Mistborn in\n\nsummer 2012. However, they have lots of plans for the future, including a third edition\n\nof Spycraft and a street-crime noir Mastercraft game called Ten Thousand Bullets.\n\nWith slow production of high-quality releases, Crafty seems likely to continue as\n\na small press publisher that’s a strong survivor of the d20 era that spawned it — and\n\none that’s likely to continue on into the foreseeable future.\n\n108 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nthen delve down into dungeons to slay hordes of monsters … and eventually\n\ncapture the Thunderstone!\n\nIn the years since the release of Thunderstone (2009), AEG has published\n\nseveral supplements for it. They’ve also gotten deeper into the deckbuilding genre\n\nwith the production of a second game, Nightfall (2011), which varies more from\n\nDominion’s mechanics by adopting even more ideas from Magic, like creatures that\n\nattack other players.\n\nSince 2012, deckbuilding has taken up the majority of AEG’s production,\n\nthough their recent publication of the Smash Up (2012) and Lost Legacy (2014?)\n\ncard games suggests that they’re still willing to publish other big-box card releases\n\nthat are expandable.\n\nBetween L5R, Thunderstone, Nightfall, Smash Up, and Lost Legacy, AEG seems\n\nwell-positioned to continue into the future. However, RPGs are a relatively minor\n\ncomponent of the company’s production, especially when compared with the\n\ncompany’s past.\n\nWhat to Read Next 9\n\n• For the other major RPG magazine of the ’90s, read White Wolf.\n\n• For what Jolly Blackburn got up to next, read Kenzer & Company.\n\n• For AEG’s one-time partner, read Pinnacle Entertainment Group.\n\n• For the Dune CCG, read Last Unicorn Games.\n\n• For the purchase of TSR by Wizards of the Coast, read Wizards of the Coast.\n\n• For Legend of the Five Rings during the Five Ring years and Ryan Dancey’s\n\nfuture influence on the RPG industry, read Wizards of the Coast.\n\n• For a Rolling Thunder-like release that worked better, read about LCGs in\n\nFantasy Flight Games.\n\n• For another publisher able to continuously support a niche RPG focusing on\n\ncard games, read Atlas Games.\n\nIn Other Eras 780\n\n• For major independent RPG magazines of the past, read Steve Jackson\n\nGames [’80s] and Chaosium [’70s].\n\n• For the old Bushido RPG that influenced L5R, read FGU [’70s].\n\n• For what John Wick got up to next, read John Wick Presents [’00s].\n\n• For the Flaming Cobra program, read Mongoose Publishing [’00s]\n\n• For the origins of the eurogame movement, read Mayfair Games [’80s].\n\nOr read onward to the world’s only diceless roleplaying company, Phage Press.\n\nPhage Press:\n\n1991–2005\n\nAlthough it only published two roleplaying products, Phage Press\n\nnot only introduced a whole new sort of gaming, but also influenced\n\nthe creation of at least two other roleplaying companies.\n\nErick Wujcik in Detroit: 1980–1986 1991: Amber Diceless Role-Playing\n\nErick Wujcik first emerged as a mover and a\n\nshaker in RPG circles during his college days\n\nat Wayne State University. There, he was\n\na prominent member of the Wayne State\n\nWeregamers, a gaming club that ended up\n\nwith a whole house to game in on campus.\n\nHowever, as college days waned, Wujcik\n\nbegan to think to the future and where he’d be\n\ngaming then. He dreamed of duplicating the\n\ncoolness of the Weregamers’ Monteith House,\n\nbut outside the university environment.\n\nThe result was the Detroit Gaming Center,\n\na 6,000 square-foot off-campus gaming\n\ncenter that Wujcik was able to rent on the\n\ncheap from a non-profit business. Wujcik\n\n110 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nwas the director of the center for the next few years and even took the opportunity\n\nto publish a gaming book of his own — Sector 57 (1980), a generic science-fiction\n\nadventure — under the Detroit Gaming Center banner.\n\nWith experience in both management and publishing, Wujcik could have easily\n\nstarted his own roleplaying company in the early ’80s — especially given the role-\n\nplaying innovation that had spread across the Great Lakes region in the previous\n\ndecade. Instead, it was one of Wujcik’s best friends — and the assistant director of\n\nthe Detroit Gaming Center — who did so: a man by the name of Kevin Siembieda.\n\nHis story lies in the history of Palladium Books.\n\n“If you want to be a game designer, you need to design games. Not just for pub-\n\nlication, fame and/or glory, but just for the pleasure of it. Design games for your\n\nbuddies, for your local convention, and just for the heck of it. The more you write,\n\nthe more you design, the more you experiment, the more skilled you’ll become.”\n\n— Erick Wujcik, Interview, Places to Go, People to Be #25 (August 2004)\n\nFor years afterward, Wujcik made small contributions to Palladium products,\n\nincluding adventures and artwork alike. He’d take the next step in 1985 when\n\nSiembieda had a problem with a freelancer who was supposed to be writing a\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RPG. With just a month left on his own deadline,\n\nand no RPG in hand, Siembieda asked Wujcik if he’d like to author the new game.\n\nWujcik agreed and five weeks later produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &\n\nOther Strangeness (1985), Palladium’s first “mega-hit” roleplaying game.\n\nAuthoring the TMNT RPG gave Wujcik a real taste for writing, encouraging\n\nhim to move beyond the small contributions that he’d made to that date. In the\n\nyears afterward, he wrote a few more RPGs for Palladium, including Revised Recon\n\n(1986), After the Bomb (1986), and Ninjas and Superspies (1988). He also wrote\n\nnumerous supplements … and not just for Palladium. He also freelanced for West\n\nEnd Games — the publishers of a new RPG called Paranoia (1984). Working with\n\nthem, Wujcik wrote one of Paranoia’s earliest adventures, Clones in Space (1986),\n\nand also contributed to the Acute Paranoia (1986) supplement.\n\nThis would lead directly to the RPG that Erick Wujcik and Phage Press are now\n\nsynonymous with.\n\nThe Creation of Amber: 1986–1991\n\nWhile working with West End, Erick Wujcik discovered that they held a license\n\nfor Roger Zelazny’s Amber novels (1970–1978, 1985–1991). These high-fantasy\n\nnovels of politics, warfare, and magic were among Wujcik’s favorites, so he was very\n\nexcited to hear that an Amber roleplaying game was in the works.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Phage Press: 1991–2005 111\n\nAt least, he was excited until West End told him that they just wanted to publish\n\nan Amber board game.\n\nSo Wujcik — with a few game designs now under his belt — offered to design\n\nan Amber roleplaying game for West End. They said that he was welcome to try,\n\nbut they wouldn’t make any guarantees about actually publishing it. Nonetheless,\n\nit was enough to get Wujcik working on what would become his masterpiece,\n\n“Amber Diceless Role-playing.”\n\nBy the late ’80s, games like Chaosium’s King Arthur Pendragon (1985) —\n\nwhich took the correlation between game system and setting to a new height —\n\nhad already appeared. Wujcik opted to go this same route by tightly integrating\n\nthe feel of the Amber setting into his game. This integration kicked off with an\n\n“attribute auction,” which expanded Amber’s point-based character creation in an\n\ninteresting way: some of these points were spent in auctions where players bid\n\nagainst each other to get the rankings they wanted in Amber’s four core attri-\n\nbutes. The end result was a world where people could explicitly state who was\n\nthe “best” swordsman and who was the “best” magician, just as was the case in\n\nthe original Amber novels. Wujcik hoped that the competitive character creation\n\nwould also introduce intra-player rivalries, but that would take some actual play\n\nto prove.\n\nWujcik tested out his attribute auction at the Michigan Gaming Center — the\n\nnext incarnation of the Detroit Gaming Center. He let 19 players bid against each\n\nother to see who would be the best in the game’s scant categories. By the end of the\n\nsession some players were cutting deals with each other, while others were harbor-\n\ning long-term grudges against those who had forced them to bid too many points.\n\nIt was exactly what Wujcik wanted.\n\nAfter that, Wujcik split players up into two groups and began playtesting the\n\nactual game. He’d been intending to use dice, but soon realized that he’d only\n\nrolled them twice during the first session. So he tried out Amber as a diceless game.\n\nIt was a daring idea, but also fitting given the details of Zelazny’s novels. Amberites\n\nwere so powerful that they could usually do whatever they wanted against mortals.\n\nIf they contested with each other, the results were usually entirely deterministic —\n\nas some people were just better at some things than others. After running Amber\n\nfor a few months without dice, Wujcik decided that they really weren’t needed.\n\nWest End, however, didn’t agree. When Wujcik brought them his diceless game,\n\nthey thought he was insane. So Wujcik acquired the RPG rights to Amber and\n\ntook the game over to R. Talsorian. But there were creative differences there as well,\n\nand Wujcik withdrew the game from their consideration. By this point Wujcik’s\n\nold friend Kevin Siembieda was encouraging him to just create a company and\n\npublish Amber on his own.\n\n1 12 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nWujcik founded Phage Press, bringing on his cousin Lisa Seymour and Ron\n\nSeymour to deal with the business side of things. It was solely a part-time gig for\n\nall of them.\n\nWujcik published Amber Diceless Role-playing (1991) in November 1991. The\n\nbook itself looked a lot like a Palladium production, with two plain columns of\n\ntext broken up by very occasional illustration. The contents, however, were entirely\n\ngroundbreaking. The attribute auction and the diceless mechanics were the biggest\n\ninnovations. Nothing like them had been seen before (and very little since). A total\n\nlack of skills was another surprise — because Amberites could learn to do what-\n\never they needed to. Amber was also one of the first games to encourage players to\n\nreally contribute to the story of the game by creating character diaries, drawings, or\n\nother artistic elements in exchange for in-game awards. Beyond that the game was\n\nsurprisingly rules-light — perhaps even shockingly so for the time period, when\n\nthe industry was just starting to move toward games like Ars Magica (1987) and\n\nVampire: The Masquerade (1991) that were intended to tell stories, not just arbi-\n\ntrate conflict between a gamemaster and players.\n\nPerhaps because of its innovation, Amber was also quite controversial. Many\n\nplayers rebelled against it, saying that they’d only let their dice be pried “from their\n\ncold, dead hands.” Others weren’t up to the freewheeling style of gamemastering\n\nthat the game required — or else didn’t trust their own GMs with that freedom.\n\nFortunately, there were also many players that loved Amber Diceless. Somewhere\n\nbetween 10,000 and 20,000 copies of the game were sold in its first year, making\n\nit a major RPG release in the 1991 marketplace. However, the fanaticism for this\n\nnew gaming system was most evident at the conventions that sprang up around\n\nthe game.\n\nThese “Ambercons” began in 1989 while the game was still being playtested.\n\nTwenty years later, there are multiple Ambercons held every year. Active cons\n\ninclude the original Ambercon (held in Detroit), Amber Central (in Michigan),\n\nAmberCon Northwest (in Oregon), and Ambercon UK. Those Ambercons create\n\nhuge nexuses of creative energy. For example, Evil Hat Productions — one of\n\nthe more notable indie companies of the ’00s — originally came together to run\n\nAmberCon Northwest events.\n\nSadly, as we’ll see, Phage Press itself wasn’t as successful as the gaming move-\n\nment that it created.\n\nThe Rest of Phage: 1992–2005\n\nAt first things looked good for Phage Press. Amberzine #1 (March 1992) appeared\n\nshortly after Amber Diceless was released. However, the digest-sized magazine\n\nwasn’t exactly a gaming supplement. Instead it focused on inspirational material,\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Phage Press: 1991–2005 113\n\nlike character diaries and discussions of\n\nelements of the Amber universe. It managed\n\nbetween one to three issues a year from\n\n1992–1997 and even had the privilege of\n\npublishing an original Roger Zelazny Amber\n\nshort story, “The Salesman’s Tale,” which\n\nappeared in Amberzine #6 (February 1994).\n\nPhage Press didn’t do as well in producing\n\nactual game material. Shadow Knight (1993)\n\n— a supplement focusing on the “Merlin”\n\ncycle of Amber books — did appear at the\n\nvery end of 1993, but it was almost two years\n\nlate. Wujcik hadn’t liked the manuscripts\n\nthat several different freelancers had pro-\n\nduced, and so ended up rewriting the book\n\nhimself. It’s a strikingly similar story to that told by freelancers at Palladium —\n\nwhere Kevin Siembieda has often rewritten material he received from freelancers\n\n— and something that would cause Phage Press problems going forward.\n\n“Several writers had attempted the project, but I ultimately ended up doing it\n\nmyself. When I started working on it, I felt like I had to redesign it to get it right.”\n\n— Erick Wujcik, Interview, Pyramid #6 (March/April 1995)\n\nAt least one other book was completed for the Amber line: Mark Jason Durall’s\n\nRebma, detailing the undersea twin to the city of Amber. However, Wujcik decided\n\nthat it wasn’t what he was looking for when he got the final draft and so never\n\npublished it. Almost a dozen other Amber Diceless books were in process at various\n\ntimes, including books called The Beyonders, Chaos Rules, The Engines of Bright,\n\nNot the City of Brotherly Love, and Amber Master’s Guide to Trump. None of those\n\nwere ever published either.\n\nIn the meantime, Phage Press was playing with the idea of publishing a second\n\ndiceless game. In 1992, James Wallis — who had previously written books for\n\nPalladium — brought Phage a game called Bugtown, which was based on the\n\ncomics of Matt Howarth. Unfortunately, creative differences kept Wallis and\n\nWujcik from seeing eye-to-eye on the game. Wallis pulled out of Phage in 1994\n\nand went on to create his own company, Hogshead Publishing, but then in 1996\n\nWujcik convinced Howarth to relicense the Bugtown rights to him. As a result,\n\nWallis could no longer publish his game. Wujcik never published a Bugtown game\n\neither, though Howarth did write and draw a Bugtown/Amber comic crossover\n\n114 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\ncalled “Amber Raves of Pain,” which appeared in Amberzine #6 (February 1994)\n\nthrough #9 ( January 1997).\n\nIn the mid-’90s a number of factors conspired to essentially bring Phage Press\n\nto an end. First, Shadow Knight received some poor reviews that impacted Wujcik\n\ncreatively. The criticism was probably equally divided between readers that didn’t\n\nlike the Merlin books — which had always been controversial among Amber fans\n\n— and those who didn’t like Shadow Knight itself. Second, Wujcik found himself\n\ncaring for a relative dying of cancer. Finally, Roger Zelazny himself died of compli-\n\ncations from cancer in 1995.\n\nA combination of those elements left Wujcik creatively blocked on Amber for\n\nthe rest of his life, though he kept Amberzine going until 1997 — when he made\n\na major career move. That year Wujcik took a job with Sierra Studios, where he\n\nworked on the Return to Krondor computer game (1998). His move into computer\n\ngames largely marked the end of his roleplaying career. He would later move on to\n\nother game companies such UbiSoft China and Totally Games. He even taught\n\ngame design for a year at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\nIn these later days, Wujcik also returned to his friend’s company, Palladium.\n\nBefore kicking off his computer career he wrote Palladium’s Mystic China (1995),\n\nwhich rather uniquely was based on a cover painting that Siembieda had received\n\nthat wasn’t appropriate for the book it was intended for. Starting in 2000, Wujcik\n\nwas also a consultant for Palladium; he ended up writing two further books for\n\nthem: Rifts World Book 24: China 1 (2004) and Rifts World Book 25: China 2\n\n(2004).\n\nWujcik published Amberzine #11 (2003) several years later, but then decided\n\nthat he was done being a publisher. At the end of 2004, he licensed the rights to\n\nAmber Diceless Role-playing to Guardians of Order — a company that had actually\n\nbeen named after an Amber Diceless character. Phage then published a final qua-\n\ndruple-sized Amberzine #12–15 (2005) to fulfill its obligation to subscribers and\n\nto publish all the final material that Wujcik been sitting on.\n\nThen Phage Press came to an end.\n\nThe Future of Amber: 2006-Present\n\nWhen Wujcik passed off the Amber line to Guardians, it was in part because\n\nhe came to the realization that he was a designer and writer, not a publisher. By\n\ngetting rid of the publishing work, Wujcik hoped to get back to his creativity.\n\nHis plans included a second edition of Amber Diceless Roleplaying and his own\n\nRebma sourcebook.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Phage Press: 1991–2005 115\n\nSadly, Guardians of Order never reprinted anything for Amber, because they\n\nwent out of business in 2006. After that the Amber Diceless rights passed on to a\n\nnew company called Diceless by Design, who has since kept the game available as\n\na PDF, but nothing more.\n\nThat changed in 2010, when Diceless by Design licensed Rite Publishing\n\nto create a game using the Amber Diceless game system. “Lords of Gossamer\n\nand Shadow” was designed by Jason Durall, author of the unpublished Rebma.\n\nUnfortunately what was intended to be a 60-page book came in at 160 pages,\n\nstraining Rite’s resources. By this time, however, Kickstarter appeared, and Rite\n\nwas able to easily fund the project with an April 2013 Kickstarter, blowing past the\n\nproject’s initial goal of $1,000 almost immediately.\n\nErick Wujcik passed away on June 7, 2008. Like Zelazny, he was only in his late\n\n50s and succumbed to complications from cancer.\n\nToday, his influence on the gaming industry remains: in the fans of Amber\n\nDiceless; in other designers who have created their own diceless designs; in compa-\n\nnies like Evil Hat and the late Guardians of Order who were influenced by Amber\n\nDiceless in their pre-publication days; and now in a new game based on the Amber\n\nsystem, Lords of Gossamer and Shadow (2013).\n\nIt’s not a bad legacy.\n\nWhat to Read Next 9\n\n• For other early storytelling publishers, read White Wolf and Atlas Games.\n\n• For Bugtown, FRUP, and Nobilis, three other diceless systems, read\n\nHogshead Publishing.\n\nIn Other Eras 780\n\n• For the other company that Wujcik was regularly associated with, read\n\nPalladium Books [’80s].\n\n• For the people that passed on Amber Diceless Role-playing, read West End\n\nGames [’80s] and R. Talsorian [’80s].\n\n• For other publishers founded due to interest in Amber, read Evil Hat\n\nProductions [’00s] and to a lesser extent Guardians of Order [’90s].\n\n• For another take on fantasy politics, read about Houses of the Blooded in\n\nJohn Wick Presents [’00s].\n\nOr read onward to a Canadian publisher of anime RPGs, Dream Pod 9.\n\nDream Pod 9:\n\n1985-Present\n\nDream Pod 9 was an acclaimed RPG publisher through the late\n\n’90s, but today they are primarily a miniatures company.\n\nBefore the Pod: 1985–1995 Dream Pod 9 is a company that had a long\n\nand varied history before it ever got into\n\n1992: Night’s Edge roleplaying. It began with a Montreal-based\n\ncompany called Ianus Publications, which\n\nwas founded by Claude J. Pelletier to first\n\npublish historical papers and later a sci-\n\nence-fiction fanzine called Samizdat (1986).\n\nThe company name of Ianus referred to this\n\nduality, for the Greek god of portals had\n\ntwo faces, one looking back to the past and\n\none looking forward to the future. When\n\nPelletier was introduced to the Robotech\n\nTV show in 1987, he decided to publish\n\na Robotech fanzine as well, Protoculture\n\nAddicts (1987).\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Dream Pod 9: 1985-Present 117\n\nAfter a bit of a legal spar with Harmony Gold, Protoculture Addicts became\n\nthe official, licensed magazine of Robotech, and that put Ianus on its path to\n\ngrowth. By issue #2 (1988), the professionalism and graphic design of the mag-\n\nazine notably improved. Then in issue #10 (1990) Ianus dropped their Robotech\n\nlicense and announced that Protoculture Addicts would now be covering the entire\n\nanime scene. As part of this expansion Pelletier brought in a new partner, graphic\n\ndesigner Pierre Ouellette.\n\n1991 was the year that got Ianus Publications moving toward gaming. Prior\n\nto that, Protoculture Addicts paid some attention to Palladium’s Robotech RPG in\n\nits early issues, but gaming had always been subsidiary to the anime itself. Now,\n\nhowever, the revamped Protoculture Addicts was causing Ianus to move away from\n\nthe Robotech anime, and the company was simultaneously launching a new maga-\n\nzine Mecha Press (1991), which focused on mechs; both of these changes offered\n\nmore opportunity to talk about the intersection between gaming and anime.\n\nR. Talsorian’s Teenagers from Outer Space, FASA’s Battletech, and Seventh Street\n\nGames’ Mecha! all became topics of conversation. This also encouraged Ianus to\n\nthink about gaming products of their own.\n\nIn the early ’90s, R. Talsorian remained a leader in the genre of anime roleplay-\n\ning, even though their anime presence wasn’t as strong as it had been in the ’80s.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Ianus got into the gaming space through a license from R.\n\nTalsorian. What is surprising is that they initially decided to license R. Talsorian’s\n\nCyberpunk RPG (1988) rather than one of its anime systems.\n\nThe result was Night’s Edge (1992), Ianus’ first full-fledged roleplaying pub-\n\nlication. Written by Justin Schmid, it uniquely defined an alternate reality for\n\nCyberpunk, mixing vampires and werewolves into Cyberpunk’s technological core\n\nto create a techno-horror game.\n\nAlthough Ianus later released a few supplements set in Cyberpunk’s main time-\n\nline, the Night’s Edge universe is what caught the attention of players. As a result\n\nIanus devoted most of their new RPG production to Night’s Edge supplements\n\nstarting in 1993, resulting in over a dozen “alternate reality universe” books\n\nthrough 1995 — including Grimm’s Cybertales (1993), Dark Metropolis (1994),\n\nSub-Attica (1994), and others. They were very well-received, and were considered\n\nby many to be better than R. Talsorian’s Cyberpunk work at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Ianus also licensed R. Talsorian’s other games — the anime ones.\n\nThis started with the publication of Hans Guevin’s space opera comedy RPG, Star\n\nRiders (1993), which was based on the comic by Etienne Gagnon and R. Talsorian\n\nartist Alex Racine. It used R. Talsorian’s Teenagers from Outer Space (1987) game\n\nsystem.\n\n1 18 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nIanus’ next publication, Jovian Chronicles\n\n(1994), was an original setting for R.\n\nTalsorian’s Mekton game (1984, 1987). It had\n\noriginally been created by the “ogre in chief ”\n\nat Mecha Press, Marc A. Vézina, for publica-\n\ntion as a serial in that magazine. Instead, it\n\nwas released as its own game book. Vézina,\n\nmeanwhile, would end up spending the next\n\n10 years as chief developer and editor for\n\nDream Pod gaming. The Jovian Chronicles\n\nsetting was quickly supplemented with\n\nEuropa Incident (1994).\n\nIt’s worth noting that Jovian Chronicles had\n\nbig exo-suits — a style of giant robot inspired\n\nby Mobile Suit Gundam (1979). They’d be important to the future of the company.\n\nBeyond its own roleplaying publications, Ianus was now also taking on work as\n\na design house. The company created three sourcebooks for Palladium’s Macross II\n\nRPG (1994), further solidifying their connections to anime gaming.\n\nThese trends came to a head with the release of Jimmy Mah’s Project A-Ko: The\n\nRoleplaying Game (1995). Though the game showed its ties to the past of Ianus\n\nPublications with the label “Protoculture Addicts Presents,” it also showed a path\n\nto the future with a new logo, which read “Dream Pod 9.”\n\nDream Pod 9 & Heavy Gear: 1995–1998\n\nThe story of Dream Pod 9 proper actually begins two years before the publication\n\nof Project A-Ko, at Gen Con ’93. That’s when the Ianus team decided to create a\n\nbrand-new gaming system called “Silhouette,” so that they could begin publishing\n\ntheir own RPGs rather than just following in other companies’ footsteps. Project\n\nA-Ko was the first Silhouette game; the “Dream Pod 9” logo helped to show Ianus’\n\nnew beginning with the new game system.\n\nThe Silhouette game system that premiered in Project A-Ko was a purposefully\n\nsimple design meant to be quick and easy to play. It centered on comparative dice\n\npools — as was common in the ’90s — but used them in a unique way: when\n\nthe pool of six-sided dice was rolled, only the highest result was compared to a\n\ntarget number to determine success, but each additional “6” result added one to\n\nthat target number. There was also a clever differentiation between stats and skills:\n\nwhere a skill determined how many dice were rolled in pool, stats acted as modifi-\n\ners to those rolls.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Dream Pod 9: 1985-Present 119\n\nAs Ianus pushed forward with its new Silhouette titles, it became obvious that\n\nthere was a division between anime and roleplaying interest at the company, and so\n\nin December 1995 it split entirely in two. A newborn company called Protoculture\n\nretained Protoculture Addicts and two of the former Ianus staff, Claude J Pelletier\n\nand Martin Ouellette; the magazine remained in print through issue #98 ( July/\n\nAugust 2008) and is still active on the web today.\n\nMeanwhile, the now fully independent Dream Pod 9 kept the majority of Ianus’\n\ndozen employees, overseen by Pierre Ouellette. They kept the roleplaying titles too,\n\nof course, including the brand-new Project A-Ko.\n\nThe newly independent Dream Pod 9\n\ndidn’t ever supplement Project A-Ko. Instead\n\nthey created a second Silhouette game, Heavy\n\nGear (1995). This game of armored suit\n\ncombat clearly followed in the footsteps of R.\n\nTalsorian’s Mekton (1984), FASA’s Battletech\n\n(1984), and Palladium’s Robotech (1986). Of\n\nthose three, it was probably the most like\n\nMekton, because it similarly imagined an\n\nanime-influenced yet original gameworld.\n\nThe action in Heavy Gear centered on\n\nthe world of Terra Nova, Sol’s first colony,\n\nand a world sitting on the precipice of civil\n\nwar. In another nod to the RPG trends of\n\nthe ’90s, Heavy Gear was built around a metaplot. In a unique twist Dream Pod 9\n\nclaimed that their metaplot would have a single beginning, middle, and end. They\n\nhighlighted this by incorporating a “timewatch” into their products that showed\n\nhow Heavy Gear’s storyline was progressing, promising that “Once the clock\n\nreaches zero, that’s it. … Support will still be provided, but the timeline will move\n\nno further.” It was a reaction against the ever-changing and growing metaplots at\n\nWhite Wolf and elsewhere, but also a system that was ultimately abandoned when\n\nit became obvious that players didn’t want a limited set of sourcebooks.\n\n“We’re already seeing power assisted frames for soldiers in the field. Looking at the\n\nother DARPA projects, it’s not too far fetched to see something like Heavy Gears\n\nout in a few decades.”\n\n— Jason Dickerson, Interview, robotviking.com (July 2010)\n\n120 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nBesides its roleplaying system and its colorful background, Heavy Gear also\n\nincluded a tactical system for robot combat, an absolute requirement for a game\n\nin this category. Conversion between the human and robot scales of combat was\n\nsimple, involving just a 10x multiplier.\n\nHeavy Gear was well-received. As Palladium’s Robotech line slowly wound down,\n\nHeavy Gear surpassed it, becoming the second most popular RPG in the genre,\n\ntrailing only Battletech. Under line editor Marc A. Vézina, numerous supplements\n\nwere produced, including equipment books, sourcebooks, and eventually a second\n\nedition (1997) of the rules — which would become the best and best-supported\n\nversion of the game. Heavy Gear also picked up some early licensees: resin model\n\nproducer Fusion Models and miniatures maker RAFM.\n\nThough Heavy Gear never explicitly tried to ride on Battletech’s coattails, some\n\nof its success was ultimately the result of FASA’s older game. Much of this came\n\nabout by accident, such as in 1995 when FASA terminated their computer game\n\nlicense with Activision, the publisher of MechWarrior 2 (1995). Looking for a new\n\ngame that could fit into the same niche, Activision stumbled upon Heavy Gear.\n\nThe result was a pair of computer games. Heavy Gear: The New Breed (1997) was\n\npartially based on MechWarrior 2 code; Heavy Gear: Black Talon (1999) — built\n\non a new gaming engine — soon followed. These games led to even greater success\n\nfor Dream Pod 9 because they got the company noticed by Sony, who ended up\n\nproducing Heavy Gear: The Animated Series (2001–2002). Unfortunately, Dream\n\nPod 9’s small size and inexperience with licensing kept them from realizing huge\n\nrewards from the licenses. Much of the money ended up in the pockets of agents\n\nand lawyers.\n\nDespite the rapidly snowballing (and lucky) success of Heavy Gear, Dream Pod\n\n9 was still looking to expand their gaming portfolio. As a result, a few new RPGs\n\nwere appearing right in the middle of Heavy Gear’s period of greatest success.\n\nOther RPGs: 1998–2001\n\nDream Pod 9’s next game was Jovian Chronicles (1998), a Silhouette-based version\n\nof the game setting that Vézina had previously created for use with Mekton. The\n\nnew edition was notably revamped. To start with, there were changes to the\n\ntheme of the game, which was now marketed as: an anime mecha game; a space\n\nopera starfighter game; and a near-future game built on hard science. There were\n\nalso considerable revamps to the designs of the mecha. Many of them were made\n\n“blockier” to better accommodate a potential Activision game that never came to\n\nbe.\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Dream Pod 9: 1985-Present 121\n\nAfter that, however, Dream Pod 9 decided\n\nthat they didn’t want to get pigeon-holed as\n\nthe “giant robot guys.” So their next release\n\nwas something entirely new: Tribe 8 (1998), a\n\nswords-and-sorcery post-apocalyptic fantasy\n\nthat was primarily the work of Phil Boulle,\n\nJosh Mosqueira, and Stephane Brochu.\n\nIn the near future, creatures from beyond\n\nthe River of Dream invaded the world; the\n\nplayers — exiles from their tribes — find\n\nthemselves caught in between the warring fac-\n\ntions as they try and form a fabled eighth tribe.\n\nThe game was very well-received for its\n\ncombination of evocative setting, interest-\n\ning metastory, and non-linear play. The simplicity of the Silhouette system also\n\ncontinued to be lauded.\n\nFollowing Tribe 8’s 1998 release, Dream Pod 9 shifted much of their new RPG\n\nproduction to the new line, making the new game Dream Pod’s top RPG from\n\n1999–2001. Some of the sourcebooks were quite well-received, such as the Vimary\n\nSourcebook (1998), which provided a description of post-apocalyptic Montreal and\n\nis recognized as one of the industry’s top setting books.\n\nTribe 8 was able to eclipse the Heavy Gear RPG in part because Dream Pod 9\n\nwas putting more focus on strategic gameplay. The tactical mech combat system\n\nfrom the Heavy Gear second edition’s rulebook was re-released as the standalone\n\nHeavy Gear Tactical Combat Boxed Set (1998), and later supplemented by a series\n\nof non-RPG “Tac Packs.” Meanwhile, Dream Pod 9 was also producing rules for\n\nsmaller-scale tactical combat in the Duelist’s Handbook (1996, 2000).\n\nFurthering the more combative side of the game, Dream Pod 9 ended their\n\nlicense with RAFM and began producing Heavy Gear miniatures in-house in\n\n1999. As we’ll see, this would mark the start of a shift in Dream Pod 9’s priorities,\n\nespecially as the roleplaying market became more chaotic in the early ’00s.\n\nJust as Tribe 8 support was starting to fade, Dream Pod 9 came out with their\n\nfourth RPG, Gear Krieg (2001). It was an alternate-history RPG set during World\n\nWar II. The biggest change in this alternate history was that technology was more\n\nadvanced; the game featured walking tanks and other technological anachronisms.\n\nLike Heavy Gear, the game could be played either as a roleplaying game or a tacti-\n\ncal one, which returned Dream Pod 9 to more familiar ground — ultimately the\n\nground that the 21st century company maintains as its core.\n\n122 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nGear Krieg wasn’t Dream Pod 9’s only push back into wargaming in 2001. That\n\nsame year they published the Tactical Miniature Rules (2001), which allowed for\n\ntactical mech combat without the hex maps required by Heavy Gear and the pre-\n\nvious Tactical rules. This allowed for more freeform gameplay. Though the new\n\nTactical Miniatures Rules would ultimately mark Dream Pod 9’s future direction,\n\nthere would first be a few years of distraction, thanks in part to the newest fad\n\novertaking the industry.\n\nThe d20 Bubble: 2001–2004\n\nJust as Dream Pod 9 was putting out Tactical Miniature Rules, their RPG production\n\nsputtered to a halt. That’s because Dream Pod 9 was in the same boat as many other\n\nRPG publishers that released new games in the latter half of the ’90s. Though they’d\n\nfound some audience with their original releases, they were now unable to sustain\n\nthat audience against the onslaught of d20 products. Dream Pod 9 was also initially\n\nunwilling to make use of the d20 license, which made things harder for them. It\n\nseemed too good to be true, and they were waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nAfter a lean RPG year in 2002, in 2003 Dream Pod 9 decided to give d20 a shot\n\nafter all. Unfortunately, this choice was ill-timed, as the d20 bust was just begin-\n\nning. The Silhouette CORE Rulebook (2003) offered a new standalone version of\n\nSilhouette that turned it into a generic system like GURPS or Hero. It also con-\n\ntained rules for converting d20 to Silhouette.\n\nThe “SilCORE” book — as it was called — was immediately followed by the\n\nMecha Companion (2003), which offered d20 stats for all the mecha from Heavy\n\nGear, Jovian Chronicles, and Gear Krieg using Guardians of Order’s d20 Mecha\n\n(2003) mech description rules. The Mecha Companion also introduced several new\n\nmecha settings. Together the SilCORE book\n\nand the Companion were clearly intended to\n\nget the attention of d20 players and bring\n\nthem over to Dream Pod 9’s own lines. It\n\nwas a similar tactic attempted by Atlas,\n\nChaosium, and others.\n\nThe SilCORE game system would ulti-\n\nmately prove unpopular to Dream Pod fans,\n\nwhile the d20 market was on a downslope\n\nthat meant the d20 support wasn’t bringing\n\nin new readers. Dream Pod 9 didn’t know\n\nthat at the time, though, and they began to\n\nrerelease all their old games in dual-statted\n\nd20 and SilCORE form. The next year saw\n\nPart One: The Storytelling Small Press (1990–1992) 9 Dream Pod 9: 1985-Present 123\n\nthe publication of Jovian Chronicles second edition (2003), Gear Krieg second\n\nedition (2003), Heavy Gear third edition (2003), Tribe 8 second edition (2004),\n\nand the brand-new CORE Command (2003), a Rifts-like space fantasy. Heavy Gear\n\nand CORE Command each received a few dual-statted supplements (2003–2004),\n\nbut after that Dream Pod ended over a decade of RPG production.\n\nSeveral final RPG products were announced — including a new steampunk\n\ngame called City of Clocks — but were never produced.\n\nBack to Miniatures: 2004-Present\n\nThe years of the d20 boom and bust had been hard on Dream Pod’s staff. Many had\n\nmoved to the computer game industry beginning in the late ’90s. Perhaps most\n\nnotably, Marc Vézina left in 2003, shortly after the release of the d20 SilCORE\n\nbooks. By 2004, Robert Dubois — now the president of the company — was the\n\nonly early staffer that remained.\n\nAmidst the d20 bust, Dubois decided to take the company in a new direction\n\nby creating Dream Pod Entertainment, which was intended to extend the compa-\n\nny’s creativity to movies and televisions. Their most notable work to date has been\n\non Frank Miller’s 300 (2007).\n\n“In 2003 the team behind Dream Pod 9 started a new project to work on action\n\nscenes for movies. Dream Pod Entertainment was created along with the Shadow\n\nSquad Stunt Team.”\n\n— Robert Dubois, Interview, robotviking.com (July 2010)\n\nDream Pod 9 has since used movie industry money to help fund hobbyist\n\ninterests. By the mid-’00s, the d20 market was almost entirely dead, so Dream Pod\n\nwent back to the tactical path that they’d been trailblazing as far back as 1998 with\n\nthe Heavy Gear Tactical Combat Boxed Set. Dream Pod 9’s return to the hobby-\n\nist industry was marked with the publication of the Silhouette Core Heavy Gear\n\nMiniatures Rules (2005), which revamped their 1998 tactical system. It was in turn\n\nreplaced by Heavy Gear Blitz! (2006) a year later. Approximately two hundred\n\n1/144 scale Blitz miniatures have since flooded forth from Dream Pod 9. Together\n\nline editors John Buckmaster and Jason Dickerson and chief modeler Philippe\n\nLeClerc have aided in these endeavors.\n\nAlthough Dream Pod 9 hasn’t been as successful as Games Workshop or Privateer\n\nPress — the big two companies that moved from roleplaying to miniatures —\n\nthey’ve done well enough to continue producing and supporting miniatures games.\n\nMost recently they went back to the dueling setting found in their old Duelist’s\n\nHandbooks and created a new tactical combat game: Heavy Gear Arena (2010).\n\n124 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nHere, rather than controlling entire armies, players oversee small sports teams of\n\nfighting ‘bots that they can improve as they compete.\n\nRPG support has been almost, but not entirely, dead since the days of d20, at\n\nleast in part due to the company’s loss of Vézina — who was the main creative force\n\nbehind Heavy Gear. Dream Pod 9 claims that they will support RPGs again when\n\nmarket conditions improve — and even included some RPG support in their Gear\n\nUp! (2010-Present) magazine, as well as some online support. However, that’s been\n\nthe full extent of Dream Pod 9’s RPG focus post-d20.\n\nThere have nonetheless been hints that a new edition of Heavy Gear might\n\neventually appear. Steve Jackson licensed the rights to produce a fourth edition\n\nin 2008, but returned them within a couple of years. More recently, Dream Pod\n\n9 announced that they’d be releasing the game themselves in Fall 2011. They said\n\nit would build on second edition, not SilCORE, and it would be compatible with\n\nHeavy Gear Blitz! To date Dream Pod 9’s new Heavy Gear hasn’t appeared either\n\n— but it seems obvious that there is continued interest in returning the game to the\n\nworld of roleplaying.\n\nSome day.\n\nWhat to Read Next 9\n\n• For another licensee whose publications were often considered better than\n\ntheir licensor, read Pagan Publishing.\n\n• For another anime publisher of the ’90s, read Guardians of Order.\n\n• For the d20 Trademark License, read Wizards of the Coast, and for d20\n\nMecha, again read Guardians of Order.\n\nIn Other Eras 780\n\n• For more on Harmony Gold and Robotech, read Palladium Books [’80s].\n\n• For more legal posturing by Harmony Gold, read FASA [’80s]\n\n• For Cyberpunk, Mekton, and Teenagers from Outer Space, read R.

The CCG trend that followed Magic\n\nbattered the entire hobbyist industry as distributors, retailers, and manufactur-\n\ners all tried to get in on the boom, neglecting roleplaying along the way, and\n\nthen got caught up in the bust.\n\nThe severe instability of the time eventually killed TSR too. However,\n\nwhereas past giants like Avalon Hill and SPI were largely ignored after they\n\nwere bought out, TSR would continue to be supported as the king of roleplay-\n\ning after their purchase by Wizards of the Coast in 1997.\n\nThe history of Wizards of the Coast truly tells the second half of the story\n\nstarted by TSR in the ’70s — how Dungeons & Dragons was rereleased in its\n\nmost polished form ever, how it became an industry-wide phenomenon, and\n\nhow it crashed and burned, in part due to unreasonable expectations from its\n\nnew corporate masters.\n\nCompany Years First RPG Page\n\nWizards of the Coast 1990-Present The Primal Order (1992) 127\n\n139\n\nNightfall Games 1991-Present SLA Industries (1993)\n\nWizards\n\nof the Coast:\n\n1990-Present\n\nWizards of the Coast had an amazing trajectory in its first decade of existence. It\n\ncreated a new hobbyist genre, bought out the past genre leader, and was eventually\n\nsold off to corporate interests. In many ways, it’s similar to the story of TSR itself — the\n\ncompany that Wizards of the Coast replaced.\n\nThe Road to the Coast: 1978–1990\n\nEvery game publisher’s story has numer- 1992: The Primal Order\n\nous beginnings, and that is certainly the\n\ncase with Wizards of the Coast. Perhaps it\n\nbegan in 1978, when Peter Adkison started\n\nplaying Dungeons & Dragons. Or it might\n\nhave started somewhere between 1979 and\n\n1982 when Terry Campbell suggested to his\n\nfriends — Adkison among them — that they\n\nstart a gaming company; they even came up\n\nwith a name, “Wizards of the Coast,” based\n\non a guild that one of their PCs was a part\n\n1 28 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nof. Or maybe it began sometime between 1981 and 1983 when Adkison used the\n\nWizards of the Coast brand to self-publish a wargame for fantasy RPGs called\n\nCastles & Conquest.\n\n“Our byline was ‘What’s D&D without C&C?’ It was really really amateur, made\n\nArduin and Judges Guild stuff look like Time Magazine, but I managed to sell\n\nenough of them to make my way at conventions and such.”\n\n— Peter Adkison, Forum Post, rec.games.frp.misc (January 1993)\n\nAs this chronology shows, Adkison and friends long thought about making\n\ntheir hobby into a career, as many gamers do. But it was just that: thinking. For\n\nthe most part, Adkison really concentrated upon his own campaign set in his own\n\nworld of Chaldea. Those adventures continued through his years at Walla Walla\n\nCollege and into his professional career — after he began working as a systems\n\nanalyst at Boeing.\n\nUnlike most gamers, however, Adkison returned to his dreams to make them\n\na reality. In April 1990, he was talking with Ken McGlothen — the only one of\n\nthose friends who discussed Wizards of the Coast 10 years before that had not\n\ndrifted away — and he suggested that they “DO it.” On May 23, 1990, a group of\n\ngamers came together and began brainstorming ideas for new products.\n\nWhat came before was prologue; now the story of Wizards of the Coast defi-\n\nnitely began.\n\nThe Primal Order of Wizards: 1991–1993\n\nThe newly-founded Wizards of the Coast began work on their first project, “The\n\nPrimal Order,” using an “office” in Adkison’s basement. It was a book of religions\n\nand deities that was intended to be the first of a series of “capstone” books. Each\n\nwould provide general rules for a broad class of gameplay, alongside conversions for\n\nmany different systems.\n\nThe young Wizards of the Coast thought that they were done with The\n\nPrimal Order near the end of 1990. They gave it and another early project,\n\n“The Compendium of Mages and Magic,” to editor Beverly Marshall Saling.\n\nUnfortunately, she had to let them know that they “weren’t even close” to pub-\n\nlication. She also told them they could do better. It would be over a year and a\n\nhalf more — and at least two major redrafts — before The Primal Order was\n\nactually done.\n\nMeanwhile, the first hints of another problem began to surface. The history of\n\nMayfair Games describes some of the troubles that a company can run into when\n\nproducing an unofficial supplement for another company’s game. The problems\n\nPart Two:The Other Half of the Story (1992) 9 Wizards of the Coast: 1990-Present 129\n\nof producing a multisystem gamebook are, if anything, more daunting. By most\n\npeoples’ reading of IP laws, game companies can protect the actual text of their\n\ngames via copyright and their system names via trademark. However, they can’t\n\nprotect the game systems themselves unless they file patents for them as inventions\n\n… and very, very few game companies do. By that reading, a book like The Primal\n\nOrder can be produced without permission from the original publishers, as long as\n\ncare is taken in the use of the trademarks.\n\nAdkison clearly knew the dangers of producing a multisystem book because he\n\nconsulted with an intellectual property attorney early on. Nonetheless, when he\n\nposted on the Internet in 1991 — looking for system experts to help out in his\n\nfirst redraft of The Primal Order — Steffan O’Sullivan (who would later author\n\nFUDGE) warned him that he’d better get publishers’ permissions.\n\nIt was a prescient statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Adkison had more concerns than just Wizards’ intended product\n\nline — which by this time included The Primal Order, three “Compendium” books,\n\nand a “Tao of GMing” book. He was also trying to figure out how the industry\n\nworked. In 1990, he went to a local gaming convention called DragonFlight. There\n\nhe met FASA’s Tom Dowd, who told him to go to the GAMA Trade Show. When\n\nMarch 1991 rolled around — and with it the next GTS convention — Wizard’s\n\nRich Kalaas was the one who attended. There he met Lisa Stevens of Lion Rampant\n\nand White Wolf.\n\nStevens offered lots of advice to Kalaas during the con — and later through\n\nemail and phone calls. She was the one who suggested that the company put all\n\nof its focus on The Primal Order. Furthermore, she suggested that Wizards make\n\nit the heart of a line of products — which she said would be easier for retailers\n\nto support than a random collection of FRP supplements. Adkison and Wizards\n\ndecided to follow her advice.\n\nStevens continued supporting Wizards at Gen Con ’91 and afterward asked if\n\nWizards would like to hire her. It took some time to work out the finances — as\n\nthe rest of the Wizards crew was still working at their normal jobs at the time\n\n— but shortly thereafter Lisa Stevens became full-time employee number one of\n\nWizards of the Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, The Primal Order (1992) finally came to fruition. Dave Howell and\n\nBeverly Marshall Saling finished it while working from Adkison’s spare bedroom,\n\neach taking half-day (!) shifts during the final two-and-a-half weeks. Following the\n\ncompletion of the book’s fourth (!) and final draft, it was released on April 1, 1992,\n\nas a dense, technical book.\n\nThe Primal Order was one of the best examples of a multisystem book since\n\nChaosium’s nine-system Thieves’ World (1981) — a supplement that publishers\n\n130 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nhad given their OK for. It sold 2,500 copies within six months — not great for a\n\ncore rulebook in the early ’90s, but not bad for a newcomer’s first product. Three\n\nsupplements — Pawns (1992), Knights (1993), and Chessboards (1993) — quickly\n\nfollowed that premiere release. From there, Wizards began to expand upon their\n\nmultisystem ideas. They announced a second capstone book, “The Military Order”\n\n— which would be based on Adkison’s old Castles & Conquest game — and also\n\nbegan work on Envoy, a generic stat system.\n\n“Frankly, my attitude at first was mercenary. They wanted to pay me, I wanted to eat,\n\nand we got along fine.”\n\n— Jonathan Tweet, “Interview with Jonathan Tweet,”\n\nRedcap v2 #3 (Autumn 1994)\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa Stevens’ influence was being felt at Wizards in other ways. Just\n\nas she had recommended producing a series of books centered on The Primal Order,\n\nshe now suggested the purchase of an existing roleplaying line — she believed that\n\nthe acquisition of a known line with an existing fanbase would further retail inter-\n\nest in the young new company. Thanks to Stevens’ industry connections, Wizards\n\nwas able to license the rights to Talislanta (1987, 1989) — an RPG published by\n\nthe recently deceased Bard Games. Stevens also suggested that star indie designer\n\nJonathan Tweet, a former co-worker of hers, be hired to revise the Talislanta rules\n\nand write its first new adventure.\n\nWizards agreed, and Tweet joined them as a freelancer. His original goal was\n\nto make Talislanta friendlier to beginning players, but as he got further into the\n\ngame’s rulebook, he and editor Saling realized it would require more work to\n\nbring it up to the highly-polished standards\n\nof The Primal Order. Despite a slipping\n\nschedule, Jonathan Tweet’s revision of the\n\nTalislanta Guidebook (1992) made it to press\n\naround May after just one series of revisions.\n\nIt was soon followed by Tweet’s adventure\n\nThe Scent of the Beast (1992); Wizard’s first\n\nfiction book, Tales of Talislanta (1992);\n\nand other Talislanta releases. Wizards also\n\npublished a new edition of Bard Games’\n\npremiere (non-Talislanta) release, The\n\nCompleat Alchemist (1993).\n\nPart Two:The Other Half of the Story (1992) 9 Wizards of the Coast: 1990-Present 131\n\n“Were it not for Talislanta, Magic: The Gathering would probably never have hap-\n\npened, because Wizards of the Coast might not have survived long enough to\n\nproduce it.”\n\n— Rick Marshall, “Wizards: Peter on the Cusp, Part Five,”\n\noathsandfates.blogspot.com (July 2011)\n\nAll told, Wizards had around nine RPG publications out by the end of the year\n\n— with Talislanta forming a solid core just as Stevens had hoped. Since Wizards\n\nalso inherited Bard Games’ old stock, they actually had quite a solid catalog for\n\nsuch a young publisher — though as we’ll see, by the end of the year they had a\n\nreally big problem too.\n\nWizards of the Coast vs. Palladium Books: 1992–1993\n\nOn June 17, 1992, Kevin Siembieda and his company, Palladium Books, jointly\n\nsued Wizards of the Coast for copyright and trademark infringement due to\n\nthe inclusion of Palladium system integration notes in The Primal Order. It was\n\na hard lesson, of relevance to any publisher. Whether your lawyers say you’re in\n\nthe right or not on a legal issue, the other side will often have lawyers offering the\n\nexact opposite opinion, and the result will usually be a lawsuit that will be won by\n\nwhoever has the most money (and so, in an industry our size, no one truly wins).\n\n“The further and further we got into 1992 the more time and resources this started\n\nto consume, and a cloud started settling over our office that sapped our energy\n\nand caused us to start doubting the future of the company.”\n\n— Peter Adkison, Posting, rec.games.frp.misc posting (January 1993)\n\nThe Palladium lawsuit almost put Wizards of the Coast out of business. It cost\n\nthem not just money, but an even more precious resource — time. Even if Wizards\n\nwanted to settle, they felt unable to do so because Kevin Siembieda consistently\n\ndemanded an “acknowledgement of guilt,” which Wizards was unwilling to sign.\n\n(If they had, they might have been liable to every other publisher whose game had\n\nbeen featured in The Primal Order.) On December 14, 1992, the judge refused to\n\nthrow out the case through a summary judgment. Two weeks later, Adkison told\n\nhis staff that he was writing what he expected to be their last payroll checks for a\n\nwhile. It could easily have been the end of a young company.\n\nBut they returned from the nadir. Some of the staff started picking up freelance\n\nwork to pay their bills while continuing to work for Wizards — much of it at\n\nWhite Wolf, thanks to Stevens’ connections there. This resulted in 60- or 80-hour\n\n1 32 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nwork weeks for some, but they believed in what they were doing, and it held them\n\nover just long enough. By January 1993, GAMA was talking about stepping in.\n\nMike Pondsmith of R. Talsorian — the GAMA president — was ultimately able to\n\narbitrate between the parties and bring them to an out-of-court settlement.\n\n“The lawsuit between Kevin Siembieda, Palladium Books, Inc. and Wizards of\n\nthe Coast, Inc. has been settled. All three of them want to put the suit behind\n\nthem, and hope that their fans will do the same. In the spirit of industry harmony,\n\nWizards requests that there be no boycotts or other action against Palladium.\n\nThanks to all who have shown concern and support to both sides.”\n\n— Wizards of the Coast, Official Statement on Lawsuit (April 1993)]\n\nWizards put out a conciliatory statement, admitting no guilt, but asking for\n\nharmony. The statement even asked for fans to call off boycotts of Palladium.\n\nLater reports suggest that this was part of the settlement agreement — which also\n\ninvolved Wizards paying Palladium an unspecified amount of cash, and promising\n\nnot to mention Palladium in their games ever again.\n\nWizards was greatly relieved by the ending of the lawsuit because it let them\n\nconcentrate on … something else.\n\nThe Coming CCG Storm: 1991–1995\n\nThat something else had begun easily enough. As early as 1991, Wizards of the\n\nCoast had been talking to Mike Davis and through him Richard Garfield about\n\na board game that Garfield was shopping around. It was an innovative game of\n\nprogrammed movement called RoboRally, but it looked too expensive for a young\n\ncompany like Wizards to produce. So Adkison asked Garfield to develop some-\n\nthing cheaper to manufacture — something that might be more portable, even easy\n\nto carry around to conventions. Garfield said that he did have an interesting idea\n\nabout combining baseball cards with a card game. Over the next week, he turned\n\nthat rough idea into a complete game — building on older prototypes dating back\n\nto at least 1982, when Garfield had created a Cosmic-Encounter-inspired card game\n\ncalled “Five Magics.” He pitched it to Adkison on August 23, 1991.\n\nThis was, of course, the genesis of the first collectible card game (CCG), then\n\ncalled “Manaclash.” It was the first of its type — a unique game design that offered\n\nplayers the ability to purchase small, randomized packs of cards that could be used\n\nto build play decks. Garfield and Adkison worked on Manaclash throughout the\n\nPalladium lawsuit, protecting the IP within a shell company called Garfield Games\n\n— in case Palladium did win its case. By the time the lawsuit closed, the game was a\n\nfew months away from release.\n\nPart Two:The Other Half of the Story (1992) 9 Wizards of the Coast: 1990-Present 133\n\nThe game that would become Magic: The Gathering (1993) was very nearly not\n\nreleased. Adkison’s original request for a “cheaper” game ended up being an ironic\n\none, because a huge investment was required to produce a collectible card game.\n\nWizards was already in the hole due to the Palladium lawsuit, and they needed\n\nmoney badly. So they sent requests for investment throughout the industry and\n\nacross the Internet.\n\nShares were sold in Garfield Games, then (after the\n\nlawsuit) merged into Wizards of the Coast at an 8:5\n\npremium. Wizards sold so much stock that it would\n\ncause them problems a few years later, when they neared\n\n500 individual shareholders — which would have forced\n\nthem to begin reporting publicly. (A stock buyback at\n\nthe time reduced the shareholder number and resolved\n\nthe problem.) However, the requests for investment got\n\nWizards the printing money they needed.\n\n“In August of this year Wizards of the Coast will be releas-\n\ning a new game called Magic: The Gathering. … I think this is the most innovative\n\ngame since Dungeons & Dragons. Why? Because it isn’t just a new game, it’s a\n\nnew gaming form.”\n\n— Peter Adkison, “The Apothecary,” Cryptych v1 #1 (1993)\n\nMagic was demoed in July 1993 at Origins ’93, then Adkison made a trip down\n\nthe West Coast in August, going from store-to-store and seeding them with prere-\n\nlease copies of the game. From there he continued his journey cross-country until\n\nhe arrived at Gen Con ’93. The full 2.6 million card alpha print run of Magic was\n\nstill being held up in customs, but it was released just in time to go on sale for\n\nthe second day of Gen Con — Friday, August 20. As they say, the rest is history.\n\n7.3 million beta cards soon followed, and then in December the 35 million-card\n\nUnlimited edition appeared. The supplements starting rolling out too: Arabian\n\nNights (1993) in December, Antiquities (1994) the next March, Legends (1994) in\n\nJune, The Dark (1994) in August, and Fallen Empires (1994) in November.\n\nOne cannot overstate how much CCGs changed the hobbyist industry back in\n\n1993 and 1994. Gamers were lining up at stores on release day, purchasing the new\n\nsets by the $100 box. There was so much money in the fad that new game stores\n\npopped up just to get in on the booming industry. Print runs kept increasing, but\n\npre-orders were locked in months ahead of each release, and Wizards couldn’t afford\n\nto print much above them. Therefore, retailers and distributors were constantly\n\nlimited in their purchases, though their desires typically had grown by release date.\n\n134 Designers & Dragons:The ’90s 9 Shannon Appelcline\n\nThe hype even pushed Wizards into a new industry: fiction.
