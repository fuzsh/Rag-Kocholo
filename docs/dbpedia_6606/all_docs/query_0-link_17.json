        "text": "On Mort, the rain never stops. This is the black jewel in the rotten crown of the World of Progress, where serial murder, empty style, corporate treachery and prime-time violence are top career options. The heart of SLA Industries, Mr. Slayer's office building dominates SLA corporate HQ, set in the gleaming splendor of the district known as Central. Only SLA's corporate employees and Operatives can be found here. Elsewhere, criminal gangs, maniacs and nervous civilians scuttle through the filthy, labyrinthine streets of Downtown and the revolting spaces beneath. Outside the city walls lurk the hellish Cannibal Sectors, terrifying areas of devastation packed with deadly inhabitants. For you, the Operative, it's just like the adverts. You're a hero, saving the world and living the golden life of hedonism and fame. But that means following Mr. Slayer's Big Picture and oh, what a picture it is. Life is so 'pleasant' for most people that SLA has employed you as part of its special troubleshooting forces. There are millions of you for Mort City alone, elite agents trusted to make sure that everything runs smoothly, and the company isn't...embarrassed. The capital of SLA Industries is resplendent in its decaying glory, a planet where a struggle to survive is the only way of living. Life is cheap here, but knowledge will cost you more than you can imagine. Guns kill, but so does the truth."
