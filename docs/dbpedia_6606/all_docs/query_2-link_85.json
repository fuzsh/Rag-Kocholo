Single d20s always result in 10, multiple d20s (like full attacks) go 10-11-9, 10-9-11, and repeat. Threats kick in when the percentages from hits (not misses) build up to 60% within or over rounds (eg. 12 basic /20x2 hits would offer one threat and confirmation). Strictly mathematically speaking, multiple 20x2 threats don’t produce exact 5% threat chances, apparently, but for a game guide I reckon a flat 5% per pip will do. If there’s a decisive close call I’ll flag it. Rough but simple.\n\nEnd Quote\n\nTerrain rules for combats.\n\nShoggoth: Underwater, normal light levels, 90 feet apart, everyone has normal concealment beyond 20 feet, no surprise round.\n\nBalor: 10 feet by 10 feet candle lit room, 100 feet high, 10 feet apart, Balor has foreknowledge of character's abilities and gets surprise round.\n\nPit Fiend: 60 feet by 60 feet dark room, 60 feet high, 50 feet apart, Pit Fiend has foreknowledge of character's abilities, no surprise round.\n\nTarn Linnorm: Moon lit Tarn, 50 feet apart, Linnorm gets surprise round.\n\nAncient Gold Dragon: Open Plain, 300 feet apart, Winner of perception check gets surprise round, Dragon starts in the air.\n\nSolar Angel: Garden, 40 feet apart, Character gets surprise round, Solar does not have all its buffs up but if threatened it can plane shift away, buff itself and come back.\n\nTarrasque, Open Plain, Characters choice of distance (maximum 100 feet), Character gets surprise round.\n\nLet the battle begin!\n\nReynard_the_fox\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nDotting. Expecting RAGELANCEPOUNCE any minute now...\n\nDarigaaz the Igniter\n\nif we do this I suggest a broader range of simulated rolls than the 9, 10, 11 the original beastmas used. maybe 5, 10, 15\n\nEnder730\n\nHow did an archer obliterate all those beasts without running into a single use of Fickle Winds?\n\nredward\n\nEnder730 wrote:\n\nHow did an archer obliterate all those beasts without running into a single use of Fickle Winds?\n\nIt's buried in the fight against the Pit Fiend:\n\nQuote:\n\n(Point of law for zen archers to remember and mention in a non-confrontational manner if and when necessary: a wind wall has to be vertical. Not horizonal, not diagonal. The fiend could make it a cylinder or square, but not a cube or a cone. This means it can’t close off the top or bottom with arrow-negating wind. In the cave the bottom might be closed by rock, but there is likely a 10’ wide aperture at the top: were One up there, he’d be looking down a 90’ wind tunnel at the devil. For a 3rd level spell this is still a formidable obstacle to archers...but it’s not the 100% arrow-negator it’s sometimes presented as being.)\n\nEven with Fickle Winds, it's still a cylinder. So..fish in a barrel, I guess.\n\nEnder730\n\nredward wrote:\n\nEnder730 wrote:\n\nHow did an archer obliterate all those beasts without running into a single use of Fickle Winds?\n\nIt's buried in the fight against the Pit Fiend:\n\nQuote:\n\n(Point of law for zen archers to remember and mention in a non-confrontational manner if and when necessary: a wind wall has to be vertical.

IMHO it hasnt even been done yet.\n\nYou know. I get it. Its a great build. Its a fun thought experiment. If there were a 26 mile marathon of evards black tentacles between this character and the top 6 worst enemies the system has to offer, clearly this character will win that race with his hands tied behind his back... Fantastic. Golf clap.\n\nBut does it stand up to scrutiny? Does this guy seriously think he can shrug off a pit fiend's wish? I don't have to tell you how it can be done. I can sure has heck say that shrugging off a wish from a pit fiend isnt going to be as smooth as this guy indicates.\n\nNot in any game I run anyway. If the maximum power of the wish spell is 'whatever wont accomplish a dang thing at all' then he shouldnt even need to worry about being so awesome. If his gm rules that a wish spell from the smartest most powerful evil being hell has to offer cant slow him down then I dont know that anything should even consider standing in his way. In my opinion thats not a legitimate ruling on how wish works. I'd be hard pressed to find a gm who looked at the pit fiend fight and just threw in the towel. \"Yep. He's bad@ass. I guess we can all go home now.\"\n\nThe strawman in this scenario is specifically the wish. This guy gives you 5 examples of wishes that wouldnt work and assumes by extension that no wish would work... it's like saying 'these 7 fat men can't outrun my dog, therefore my dog is faster than every person on the planet! Might help you sleep better at night but doesn't make it true.\n\nI dont place value in being able to build megadamage unkillamonsters. This is not what gaming means to me. But this guy pretends he has no achilles heel and his handling of a wish implies that even wish spells are impotent to curb his wrath. Well if there isnt a wish in the universe that can even slow you down then whats the point. Its not my job to show how its done and I hold no stock in being able to do it.\n\nIts my job to decide if his assumptions on how he did it are valid and I dont think they are. Tell me Gygax wouldnt call BS on this guys 'wish immunity'... Tell me this scenario would play out uncontested in a PFS approved scenario. I just dont see it.\n\nI'm not going to bother doing it, but i'll tell you what. If you come up with a way to do it you'd be the first because in my mind this guy didn't get the job done.\n\nI know all you minmaxin optimizers like to have your little showdowns of who's the most optimized optimizers in optimizerland, but if this gauntlet is the measure of your success (and it's an awesome gauntlet to be sure) then I just want to go down as saying its a gauntlet that I dont think the zen archer made it halfway through.\n\nJhidurievdrioshka\n\n6 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nIf the challenge didnt have a pit fiend in it I probably wouldnt even be talking here. But the second someone starts saying \"I have a build thats so badashe that no wish in the world can harm me\"... I cant help it. I gotta say something.\n\nNicos\n\n3 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nI am with Jhidurievdrioshka here, And I have serious doubt about the others encounters too.\n\nNikolaus Athas\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nThe link in the OP is broken. I'd like to see it or the 5 fail wishes that were made before I'd come up with a possible wish.\n\nUltimately though I would have thought that a wish of 'I am immune to any arrow used by THAT monk' would suffice.\n\nYes this is a 'more powerful version' of what a wish normally entails but Im sure that the ultimate representative of a race of immortal extremely organised and intelligent beings could come up with some kind of loop hole like that ... its what they DO.\n\nWhy cant he use the wish to create a spherical wind wall? Im sure that the wish could alter it so. Wind Wall is a 3rd level spell - Altering the shape of it to turn it into a sphere call it a +3 meta magic feat - ta da 6th level spell effect.\n\nOr use the ability of a wish to duplicate any spell - do Control Winds = windstorm (75mph+) and then apply ectoplasmic meta magic to it so that missile fire is impossible in any form or plane. Thats not too big a use of wish and 100% legal.\n\nOr bring into effect a contingency that makes him and the Monk swap places once the arrows fly, so that the Monk ends up shooting himself?\n\nOr a really sneaky one - Wishing to swap the battle conditions for the Shoggoth's one.\n\nBut if there was a GM involved this fight could and would not happen because any player that claims to be able to do this should be told ok build your character from Level 1 - we will run this test when you hit level 20 assuming to dont die before hand due to sub par choices you have to make along the way as you attempt to build this as optimal as possible.\n\nIts an easy exercise to say I can make a build that kill this one mob under the most optimal conditions and with all the loot I want, but try playing to get to that point. Wont happen.\n\nIm not even sure why the conditions for these fights are laid out as stated. Why not 1000' lit sphere of free space for all of them? Or all underwater? or all in pitch dark in a 10x10 room with the mob chained to the Monk? Or in a dense forest with no line of sight more than 10'?\n\nWhat exactly are we trying to prove here?\n\nKrodjin\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nJhidurievdrioshka wrote:\n\nIf the challenge didnt have a pit fiend in it I probably wouldnt even be talking here.

I gotta say something.\n\nyou take yourself and your pit fiends way to seriously. Take the guide for what it is - an example of how you can build a Zen Archer. If your big issue is with the Pit Fiend I can only assume you didn't read the guide are just hating for the sake of hating.\n\nJhidurievdrioshka\n\nHere's a working link.

I'm looking at the level 20 build, and first off, his 14/14/14/7/17/7 (20 point buy) is invalid. Assuming that as a human, he put his +2 into Wisdom, he only spent 14. If he put his +2 into any one of his physical traits, he'd end up with 17 out of 20 spent.\n\nRedacted Paragraph:Secondly, he can't take both the Qinggong Monk and Zen Archer archetypes together, as they both replace Diamond Body, Still Mind and Tongue of the Sun and Moon.\n\nThirdly, his feats are all screwed up. As a level 20 qinggong/zen archer (if it were even valid) human monk, he should have 23 feats, not 21 as listed, and... Stunning Fist is not a special attack and is therefore not a valid selection for Ability Focus.\n\nRedacted Paragraph:In his gear, he'd have to have Bracers of Armour +8, not a Vest of Armour +8 (unless it was custom allowed by his GM), he's got a Headband of Inspired Wisdom +6 and a Headband of Vast Intelligence +2 (he cannot wear both, so this must be a custom item), a Ring of Protection +5 (and counterspells; not sure where he got this secondary ability added in) Ring of Evasion (and counterspells; same as before, unless it's custom), and unless the Vest of Armour +8 is allowed by his GM, the Greater Bracers of Archery wouldn't be valid.\n\nHis skills and attributes are off, too. His Wisdom only reaches to 32 (not +38), his Fly would only be at +9 (not +17), Heal is +16 (not +17), Perception is +40 (not +41), Sense Motive is +16 (not +17) - he's got all these unaccounted for luck bonuses... And with his +5 hit points every level (choosing skill points so that those line up properly), he's averaging 5.65 hit points per level on a d8 roll. This armour class only reaches to 52 (not 53) with ki, 48 without. That, and his ki pool only goes up to 32, not 33. Plus, no darkvision.\n\nRedacted Paragraph:He only picked 5 of his 11 ki powers so far as I can tell; Ki Arrow, High Jump (bringing his jump to +59, not +71), Perfect Self, Quivering Palm and Diamond Soul. He's 6 short.\n\nUnless this is a poor conversion from 3.5 material, this doesn't work, and if it is, it should be noted.\n\nHere's the character in full (courtesy of Hero Lab), with Haste, Deadly Aim, Fast Movement, Flurry of Blows, High Jump, Ki Defense, Mantis Style and Point Blank Shot all activated.\n\nPorpentine's Qinggong Zen Archer Monk, Level 20:\n\nPorpentine's Monk\n\nHuman Monk (Zen Archer, Qinggong Monk) 20\n\nLN Medium Outsider (augmented humanoid, human)\n\nInit +13; Senses Perception +40\n\n--------------------\n\nDefense\n\n--------------------\n\nAC 52, touch 44, flat-footed 40 (+8 armor, +7 Dex, +5 deflection, +5 dodge)\n\nhp 233 (20d8+120)\n\nFort +24, Ref +28, Will +29\n\nDR 10/chaotic; SR 30\n\n--------------------\n\nOffense\n\n--------------------\n\nSpeed 110 ft.\n\nMelee Cold Iron Brass knuckles +23/+23/+18/+13 (1d3+7/x2) and\n\n. .

Not to mention that his first hit against the Shoggoth with his Improved Vital Strike (no crit) will only do 47 damage maximum, reduced to 37 after the Shoggoth's damage reduction. His next flurry could do a maximum of 248 damage on eight hits with no criticals, not seven (only 217, reduced to 147 with the Shoggoth's DR on seven hits). He could get up to a total of 744 damage on all 8 hits if they're all critical successes, though, reduced to 664 after damage reduction.\n\nThe rest of the battles become suspect...\n\nNikolaus Athas\n\n\"Or use the ability of a wish to duplicate any spell - do Control Winds = windstorm (75mph+) and then apply ectoplasmic meta magic to it so that missile fire is impossible in any form or plane. Thats not too big a use of wish and 100% legal.\"\n\nJust to clarify This spell is the zen monk killer because under the description of the spell and the environmental effects :\n\n1) the spell can be set to be a downdraft (so air from above is forced down and out. No standing above shooting down any attempt to do so will force the monk back out the side (if he fails) and will certainly send his arrows outwards regardless.\n\n2) at wind level 3 or above (windstorm = 51mph+) ranged fire is *impossible*. The Pit fiend being CL18 can easily achieve this setting. It also can easily occupy the entire room. If through some freak of miss read ability the zen Archer can make his arrows act like Siege weapons then the Pit Fiend would set the wind to Tornado (175+) which makes even Siege weapon fire impossible.\n\n(Note please: not a negative to hit, not a cover save, but flat out black and white *impossible*)\n\nApplying Ectoplasmic allows it to stop ghost touch arrows or other tricks of etherealness or incorporeal.\n\nThe Pit fiend can constrict the radius of safe air to only his reach so if the Zen archer wishes to be able to shoot him he needs to get into melee range of the Pit Fiend.\n\nSo assuming this happens then what can the Zen Archer do?\n\nJhidurievdrioshka\n\n2 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nSad truth is that a pit fiend has an int of 26.\n\nI'm not saying every pit fiend is smarter than elminster.\n\nBut based on their stats they are smarter than me, smarter than you, smarter than 99.99% of the people on the globe. The scenario specifically said the pitfiend was fully aware of the capabilities of the zen archer before the fight even started, and he's basically the bobby fisher of making powerful people realize they're in a bad way. You can be sad panda all you want. You give the hellspawn king bobby fisher of pain and suffering a wish spell and enough time to get it off... You can expect the next 12 seconds of your life to be worse than you can possibly imagine.

Obviously not all encounters will look like that (the rules were stated going in, everything was simplified), but otherwise, it was played pretty pretty straight, along with being a really nice guide on zen archers.\n\nIf anything, my biggest complaint would only be that the Solar and Tarrasque fights weren't nearly as straightforward as the preceding ones, probably because the monk did indeed need the edge, such as was stated against the Solar.\n\nAs far as wishing goes, if anything, I would say wishing for something not specifically listed to be available through them would have been breaking the rules by which that simulation worked. That would be treading into GM territory, and none of this has a GM to adjudicate it, so sticking to the listed effects is exactly what should have been done, at least in my opinion.\n\nAs for antimagic field, a lot of the monk abilities (I don't know which ones exactly) are extraordinary, not supernatural or spell-like, meaning the monk would have still had lots of abilities available. Admittedly a lot of his items would stop working... until he was 10 feet away from the pit fiend, which is the range of the spell.\n\nAt any rate though, I don't have any uber-build to run through this beastmas(s?). It does look fun though, and I may try it if inspiration strikes.\n\n@ Nikolaus: I personally think it makes more sense to run against exactly what's in the statblock and nothing else.

They actually both have the same Fort (which Control winds has as a save to negate the effects round by round) which means either neither are hampered inside it, or they both are. It would certainly mess up archery though, but in the meantime, what does the pit fiend have for killing him with anyway?\n\nBluh, so much for not contributing to thread derailment.\n\nEdit 2: Meh, nevermind the spoiler I suppose.\n\nAzten\n\nWish: Lava fills the area.

It's all theorycraft and would tend to fall apart in play for a couple of reasons.\n\n1.) Dice rolls. - They always get in the way of epic encounters.\n\n2.) The unpredictability of opponents. - It's all well and good to say that X does this on round 1, that on round 2, etc.., but in a real fight the combatants would change up their tactics based on the situations and has been pointed out multiple times, the Pit Fiend's wish was wasted and seriously stupid. There are so many better options (anti-magic field, lava, summoning more pit fiends, the list is literally endless).\n\nThis build is just a gilded sword. It looks awesome, but you don't know how functional it is till you use it. Sit down with one person playing the monk and another playing the mobs AND then beat them all in the same overpowering way it indicates and then I'll admit it's the uberbuild.\n\nDM Carpe\n\nTo those of you who have expressed your objections we get it, please stop posting them. Though a lot of the wish options are just going to DM fiat, you can't fill a room with lava the Wall of Lava spell is 8th level and nowhere near that powerful if a Pitfiend can just wish rocks fall everyone does then nobody can beat it, what fun :p.

OP put up an achievement to be matched. If the achievement is suspect that is of course a legitimate complaint.\n\nAnd to the complaints of others I would add the dice \"rolling.\" Average rolls on every die is not how the d20 works and seriously distorted those fights even for the monk. It would be even more problematic for other classes where forcing rerolls is a significant power (the witch springs immediately to mind). The best way to figure this sort of thing out is to work with math and probabilities. Taking the easy shortcut of always rolling average is of course much easier, but it more or less makes the whole thing pointless.\n\nIt is also a fair complaint that the spellcasting monsters (especially those with access to wish, miracle or AMF) were seriously underplayed. Solar uses a Miracle to Plane Shift back to the plane followed by a Wish specifically to teleport to the battle location? A great way to artificially deplete it of its most powerful spells, since Wish alone can do this:\n\nQuote:\n\n• Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.\n\nand Miracle alone can do this\n\nQuote:\n\nMoving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.\n\nFurthermore the monk has to happen to encounter it while it is vulnerable and not using any of even its at-will buffs. For example, Invisibility ruins the monk's plan of hiding in the Ethereal and searching for the solar, and a solar is likely invisible all the time save when it wants to be seen, since it has that at will. The monk also apparently has the ability to perfectly navigate the contours of the ground surface without vision while traveling through the ground, such that he accurately keeps his head no more than a foot underground without ever accidentally poking it through. Maybe all his ranks in Survival will let him accurately find his way about... oh wait. He doesn't have any skill ranks that would help him do this in any way.\n\nGold dragon fight was also pretty subpar in terms of making use of spells and abilities (dicking around as a massive target at a massive distance for a monster that can change its shape and teleport but has no long ranged combat abilities? Since the monk is trying to engage from maximum visual range, screwing with that buys the dragon time to buff). And again no buffs active, not even making use of its Extend Spell feat with Mage Armor which lasts >24h with one casting. So, disregard for the dragon's selected feats as well.\n\nI haven't really read through the other ones, and probably not going to given what I found in those. It is a powerful build, sure, but the monsters are not played nearly to their fullest.\n\nJhidurievdrioshka\n\n5 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nIs it a fun read? Absolutely.

Was it this If not please find it.\n\n@Bodhi:\n\nI had a longer look at your hero lab version and you miss out a few things.\n\nOne's +6 belt is also a belt of dwarfkind (legal in the core rulebook) hence his darkvision.\n\nOne's Bow is (+7 Str) so he gets an extra plus 7 to damage. Plus Weapon specialisation, which further boosts the damage up to +26.\n\nOne's wisdom on your version is 2 lower than it acutally is and yes that does add up 17+ 2 racial + 4 tome + 6 headband + 5 level up bonuses. This explains why his skills, AC etx don't add up as you missed a +1 mod.\n\nHis damage does not take to account his power to make bow damage same as unarmed (boosting 1d8 to a devestating 2d10).\n\nYou have missed several bonuses from his AC, including his Ioune stone with insight bonus +1 and his barkskin with +5 natural.\n\nFinally\n\nStunning fist is a special attack\n\nPlease read the stat block fully before complaining that its illegal. The only problems I see with it are he is missing 18th level Monk bonus feat and his damage should be +26 and not +28. That is it.\n\nI reall hope to see a beastmass beating Paladin Bodhi.\n\nroguerouge\n\n13 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nThank you to everyone for proclaiming this is all Bad-Wrong-Fun before it has even started.

It will be awesome\n\nCrosswind\n\n3 people marked this as a favorite.\n\nSooo, my previous post was meta-whining, which is actually worse than regular whining. Here's my attempt at this.\n\nKey ideas here seem to be:\n\nUntouchable AC.\n\nInfallible Saves.\n\nGigantic, unmitigatable damage.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuild: Half elf Synthesist (16), Oath of Vengeance Paladin (4)\n\nLaaaaame Stats (20 point buy): 7/7/7/8/18/18+2\n\nHalf elf class bonus goes to summoner for +5 evolution points.\n\nFeats:\n\nImproved Initiative\n\nExtra Evolution x5\n\nImproved Natural Attack (Bite)\n\nPower Attack\n\nDimensional Agility\n\nDimensional Assault\n\nEidolon is as follows:\n\nQuadruped\n\nImproved Natural Armor x4 (4)\n\nImproved Dex x3 (6)\n\nHuge Size (10)\n\nHead x5 (10)\n\nPounce (1)\n\nTotal Evo Points Required: 31\n\nTotal Evo Points We Have: 21 (16 lvls), +5 (half-elf bonus) +5 (feats)= 31\n\nAbility Bonuses into Dex (+3)\n\n+6 str/dex from being lvl 16\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, for untouchable AC, let's start off by committing to 16 levels of Synthesist. This gives us +12 Natural Armor from our eidolon, +8 from Improved Natural Armor Evolution x4. We'll go quadruped of some form, pick up +5 deflection and +5 natural armor, while wearing Braceres of Armor +8. And +4 shield bonus, from being a synthesist.\n\nOur dex will end up being 14(biped), plus 8 from ability score increase, -4 from being huge, +9 from leveling, +6 from an item, +5 from wishes or tomes So, total of: 38.\n\nSo our AC is: 10 + 14(dex)+4(shield)+25(Natural Armor)+8(Armor) + 5 (Deflection) + 1 (Dodge from boots of haste or haste) = 57.\n\nTouch is 29 (Problem.)\n\nFlat-footed is 43 (Not a problem.)\n\nLet's check our saves.\n\nDex is 38, Con is 13+8(huge)+6(item) = 27, Wisdom is 18+6(item) = 24.\n\n5/5/10 + 5(Cloak of Resistance) + 4 (synthesist) + 14/8/7 (stats) = 27/23/26.\n\nOur saves are insufficient, so, we take 4 levels of paladin. This makes our base saves 9/6/14, and also adds our charisma (20 + 5 (stat increases) + 5 (tomes) + 6 (item) = 36 (+13) to our saves\n\nSo now our saves are a much more respectable 44/38/43. And we have improved evasion and evasion, from being a synthesist.\n\nNow, from our super charisma, we have 15 uses of Channel Energy, which means we can smite 7+2 times. So we can assume that we’re smiting every BBEG, every combat. This helps us. While smiting, our AC goes 8 higher (Deflection bonus of +13).\n\nSo we’re at:\n\n65 AC (yay!), 37 touch (Nice!), 52 Flat-footed (yay!).\n\nOur saves are: 44/38/43, with improved evasion.\n\nNow, how much damage do we do? We have a BAB of +16 (4 from paladin, 12 from summoner), so we can power attack for +5. Let’s give ourselves a +5 amulet of mighty fists, too.\n\nOur strength is 14 (eidolon) + 6 (improvements) + 4 (tome) + 6 (item) + 16 (huge) = 46. With our 6 bite attacks, we do: 6*(3d6+27 + 4 (smite)+5 (magic weapon)+15 (power attack)), for an average of 369 points of damage.\n\nOur attack bonus is 16+18 (strength)+13(smite charisma) + 5 (weapon), so, +52 on all of our attacks. I don’t think we ever miss. And we ignore all DR thanks to smite.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo summarize:\n\nOur initiative is at 17, we have 65/37/52 AC, 44/38/43 saves, and we have 6 attacks at +52, so we only miss anything on a natural 1. We have reach and teleport-pounce, so we’re full attacking every round. When we get to attack, we do 275 damage which ignores all DR.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI am not a great optimizer, so there may be some holes in this build. I would love it if other people could fill these holes using our remaining feat, and the 16 levels of summoner spells that I possess. =)\n\n-Cross (I realize that I am probably way overbudget for a 20th level character, but I don’t have a good feel for how much stuff costs.)\n\n(Edit: For fun and flexibility, could pick up dimensional agility and dimensional assault, so that our charge/full attack could be from...400+40*16 = 1040 feet away?)\n\n(Double Edit: Reading through the fights. The shoggoth is @#$%ed. This character isn't particularly vulnerable to greater dispels, because his numbers (AC and saves) are so much freaking higher than they need to be. I have never played at high level, so I'm sure Wish would do something, but I'm not sure it's going to be that effective. ...Unlike One, this character can just flat out tank + spank the Solar, and I think every other fight goes equivalently, with Dimension-door charge taking the place of One's Perfect Shot. Nobody can really survive more than 2, and I can cast 8 dimension doors per day with my 3rd level spells. Use 6 more in 4th level spells and I can dimension-door charge every round of every one of these combats - because none of these critters can survive 2 full attacks. Any complaints?)\n\n1 to 50 of 538 << first < prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | next > last >>\n\nCommunity / Forums / Pathfinder / Pathfinder First Edition / Advice / Beastmass: A challenge to Master Min-Maxers All Messageboards\n\nWant to post a reply?
