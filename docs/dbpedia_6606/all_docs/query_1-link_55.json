        "text": "Set in a dark futuristic urban environment, SLA gives you unlimited possibilities to explore in a world where one company controls everything, the masses worship television shows that feature serial killers versus company sponsored agents, and you are thrust in the middle of it all.\n\nYou can choose to ally yourself with SLA or with one of the many underground competitors. But that's not all. If combat is not your thing, SLA Industries gives you many other avenues to explore this dark world where SLA tells you only what you need to know and hides its secrets jealously. How much can you find out? How much are you willing to pay?\n\nLong live SLA. You, however, may not live long at all.\n\nDaruma Productions have brought Nightfall Games’s classic 90s RPG “SLA Industries” back into print.\n\nAs the original book was produced in 1993, with desktop publishing still finding its feet and digital archival options both rare and expensive, all the original scans and files were, inevitably, lost. Daruma’s design team, two of the original founders of Nightfall Games, worked arduously scanning one of the remaining unopened original first print copies of SLA Industries from the archives and other, later, editions to get the best possible copies of long lost artwork. The cover art, a Glenn Fabry painting from a John Beeston ink drawing, was taken from the later hardcover edition, as were the included fiction pieces, while the text was scanned and OCRed from the earlier editions.\n\nThe scanned art was retouched to get it as close to original as possible, while the text was sized to fit the US Letter size of the reprint, differing from the original European A4 size, while trying to keep the book feeling as close to the first-printing as possible."
