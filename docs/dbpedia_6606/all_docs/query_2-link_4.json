        "text": "Big ass guns.\n\nSarcasm.\n\nSatire.\n\nMore big ass guns.\n\nChain axes.\n\nCombat drugs.\n\nDoing it all on camera for fun and profit.\n\nSLA starts off as a power fantasy, because you have all this cool stuff! You're like a cross between a rockstar and an FBI agent, you've got the best toys, the best drugs, and you can flash your badge around and get people to respect your damn authority. It feels empowering as a player at first.\n\nAnd then it very quickly becomes various styles of horror game, as you learn that the things you're up against have even better stuff than you and what you have probably doesn't work on them anyway, the public secretly like them even more than they like you, and you are far from the biggest and baddest in the room; you're barely a step above the plebs, and while one day you might get to join the ranks above you that's contingent on you not upsetting them by pushing too hard or learning too much. SLA Industries has very narrow expectations of you and you'd better stay inside them. Also your friends and you are all gradually turning into monsters, generally metaphorically but sometimes literally; probably best not to think of them as your friends any more, actually, just your colleagues, just in case they're ever your next job. And if you're unlucky enough, you get through that phase and then you might, just might, find out that things are even worse than you learned.\n\nIt's grim, satirical, excessive, oppressive, and ultimately just downright awful. But dammit, there's nowhere quite like Mort for just that level of absolute shittiness.\n\n....and the satisfaction of knowing that everything you do is a thorn in the side of a young autistic boy trapped on a planet with angry monkeys\n\nTo be fair, that's something that PC's don't know or really have any way of learning. It's another annoying bit of SLA info that is there in the book, but it's meaningless because there's no way to interact with it.\n\nIf Brent and Tyde's cold war ever became public beyond the few thousand (At best) people who actually know some portion of the Truth, I could see a third major faction springing up fairly quickly to protect the populace from the two of them.\n\nThat's been retconned out I believe.\n\nThe basics of Brent and White Earth are still there, even if some details may have changed.\n\nThe aspects of the exiled man (not autistic boy), Tyde and Bitterness can be considered equivalent to the story of the Gods in other settings. It is not a part of the lives of the Operatives nor the general populace BUT the interactions and prior interactions of these 'gods' (inc Crantham et al.) shape and shaped the World of Progress, it's nature and it's future. The universe wasn't made right and so is cracking at the seams. New horrors (dream entities, hominids, Shi'an) all exist but because of that.\n\nThere's a mythic quality to all the Proper Noun characters in SLA, but not much is ever filled in about them, and so all the things like this don't come across well. What I feel the core book could really, really, use is an explicit \"hey this is what's going on behind the scenes:\" chapter, written out-of-character for players and GM's, and even if actually dealing with it is something reserved for high-level operatives or in a Platinum BPN sourcebook at least then GM's can use and work with the information.\n\nI'm one of those who - once I found out about 'The Truth' - felt disappointed and would be quite happy if it was never mentioned again. Mostly because it had no real impact on the game the players were taking part in and they couldn't impact on the 'real' events in any meaningful way.\n\nFor all the horror of 'We exist solely as the figments of a mad man's imagination', I can't see how knowing this empowers the characters or endangers SLA to the extent that they have to silence those who find out.\n\nBecause the SLA universe basically works on dream logic. If enough people learned that they weren't actually real, they would cease to exist (Or they'd learn how to use the truth of the universe as a source of power, stick a pumpkin on their head, and take up murder as a hobby), and without enough people to believe in it then the SLA universe itself would cease to exist, along with everyone in it (Including Mr Slayer et al). Mr Slayer's overwhelming goal is a fair one - \"keep the universe together in the face of forces trying to tear it apart\" (Forces which coincidentally he's usually also responsible for due to him being a callous and vindictive bastard but lacks the self-awareness to acknowledge that) - but he can't afford to give any leeway because the stakes are too high.\n\nSome further questions:\n\n- What the hell is the point of changing the spelling of \"Tide\"? If this is not something which is actually all that immediately important to Operatives, why make the tweak?\n\n- Why would you make the literal first bit of text encountered when you crack open the new core book some fluff fiction based around Dr. Crantham, and why would you mention Brent Walker in the timeline, without providing any coherent explanation to newcomers of who those people are? If they are genuinely not that important, why dedicate valuable core book space to them which could have been directed at something with much more immediate relevance?\n\n- If they are important, why not just level with referees as to what's going on with them rather than playing coy? It's not the 1990s any more, metaplots revealed piecemeal through a string of supplements aren't fashionable any more and most people would rather just have the material so they can either use it or junk it as they see fit rather than having this constant string of coy hints.\n\nI can see the Tyde thing has clearly triggered you. I'm sorry for that. A creative decision by the creator...the Tyde has changed for sure ;)\n\nagain for the last two a creative decision and one that will be reflected in future products (and products released since new Nightfall has existed. Sorry it's not for you but it is an ignorable aspect.\n\nsince joining the team a phrase springs to mind, 'not my world of progress', that's cool to me. It's a sandbox RPG setting take what you want and add what you want to it. Want no truth, want Wraith Raiders and Predator Shaktar, want to exclude Neophrons or a particular aspect...fill your boots\n\nSenti: she is ret-conned out. She was a creation of a member of the original team no longer part of the team. And not something Dave and Jared wish to include now that favour is no longer needed.\n\nThat's a shame. As a Stormer fan, I liked Senti; having our own Proper Noun character to represent us was cool, and more interesting than just anonymous scientists being responsible for the Stormer project.\n\nWraithen vs Wraith Raider: I guess your view of cool is different to mine. Wraith Raider to me is a more appeasing to a more juvenile disposition. As with many of my answers, Dave has had 30-40 years to think about this and 40 something Dave has a different view to teenager Dave. I agree with this. By the way as with Brainwaster the term Wraith Raider is still part of the game, it's more of a nickname/common name for the species\n\nPart of the appeal of SLA always has been that juvenilism, though; everything is cool in the way that a deeply angry teenage boy would think was cool, which also entirely made sense given the nature of The Truth and that the universe was previously literally created by an angry teenage boy.\n\nI've seen your 'review', a commendable essay for sure. I'm not going to go into the bones of in, nor pick into the various errors of misinterpretation of 'facts' supposition is based on.\n\nI will say this would have been an awesome thing had it not been so clearly written with a negative agenda.\n\nWarthur is clearly a long-term fan; if there was any agenda when he originally decided to review it, I can't see it having been anything other than positive.\n\nI can see the Tyde thing has clearly triggered you. I'm sorry for that. A creative decision by the creator...the Tyde has changed for sure ;)\n\nGiven the way that the phrase \"triggered\" is used in internet discourse these days (As an insult intended to make the target seem unreasonable and excessively emotional), do you think that mocking a customer who is providing a reasonable critique or asserting that they had a negative agenda when reviewing your game is reasonable?"
