        "text": "Announcement from Nightfall Games:\n\nAs Nightfall Games finalise the new publication – SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1, we have taken a good look at the contents of the various source materials published to date. As many of you know, a number of these books were produced with little or no input from the creators of SLA Industries and as such do not represent the image, ideals, nor stories of The World of Progress. Additionally, a number of the books have been directly superseded (in whole or part) by the writing in the new book. With this in mind, only the following source books and supplements should be now be considered canon (the official vision of The World of Progress):\n\n• SLA Industries Main Rulebook (including all reprints) (ISBN 1 899749 23 3)\n\n• Karma (ISBN 1 880992 56 6)\n\n• Hunter Sheets Issue 1 (ISBN 978 0 9555423 1 2)\n\n• Hunter Sheets Issue 2 (ISBN 978 0 9556497 1 2)\n\n• \"Klick's End\" Data Packet\n\n• \"Momic 0.1\" Data Packet\n\n• \"The Dream\" Data Packet\n\n• \"Threat Analysis: Hominid\" Data Packet\n\n• \"Hunters Sheets: Red Alert\" Data Packet\n\n• SLA Industries GM Screen\n\nThe publications listed below are no longer considered to be an official part of the SLA Industries canon.\n\n• Mort Sourcebook (ISBN 0 9522176 6 X)\n\n• The Key of Delhyread (ISBN 978-1-899749-24-9)\n\n• The Contract Directory (ISBN 978-1-899749-29-4)\n\n• Cannibal Sector 1 (ISBN 978 0 9555423 0 5)\n\n• \"Ursa Carrien\" Data Packet\n\nAs such we will be removing these books from sale on DriveThruRPG on the 31st January 2019. Note that anyone who has purchased these items before January 31st will still be able to access them in their personal library.\n\nAs a loyal operative and KARMA creation, I would like to point out that my creators sell a specifically-formulated Retcon serum for just this occasion; I put in my mandatory purchase order earlier today.\n\n(I see the logic in what they're doing, but frankly, SLA is such an obscure property now that they wouldn't have missed out on anything by dropping the prices on the PDF's and explicitly marking them non-canon products. I would be very, very surprised if they still sold in even negligible numbers.\n\nI haven't got the new CS1 book, I didn't back it because frankly I think Nightfall are bad at business things and oh look I was right, but the excerpts I've seen look good. I'll pick it up when it's out.)"
