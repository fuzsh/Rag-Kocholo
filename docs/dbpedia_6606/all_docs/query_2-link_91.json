        "text": "Citation preview\n\n23rd August, 1988 - Biggar, Scotland. Crantham staggered into his study, straight towards his drinks cabinet. He swung the glass-panelled doors open and with a trembling hand reached for the bottle of whisky. He was coughing still, dust and cement particles spinning in his lungs. The whole building had come down, all in one go; it was the only reason he’d been able to slip past the soldiers and drive home. But he couldn’t stay long – just enough time to collect his essentials and the money and passport, secreted behind that photo on the wall and then he’d be gone, off to Paraguay, to San Antonio. The army would call at his first office, searching for him, for answers. They didn’t know about this one, the proper one. The one that contained all the most pertinent discoveries accrued during more than five years of Foundation research. The rest had been destroyed, along with all the test subjects. He clumsily tipped the bottle heavily on the rim of the glass, spilling whisky on the back of his hand. He hissed and fumbled to screw the lid back on. His eye caught the name on the label and after a moment’s recognition he let out a shrill laugh that sounded foreign and frightening to his ears. “Henri.” The quiet, soft voice made Crantham spin in its direction, instantly letting go of the glass. He did not hear it shatter. The figure was sat in his armchair, face hidden in shadow. He wore a suit that was the fashion seventy years previous, but looked as though it was finished just yesterday. “What have you done, Henri?” The figure spoke. His tone was sad and hollow. Crantham felt his way into an adjacent chair, unable to take his eyes off The Elder. “You come to me now, finally, after all these years.” Crantham whispered. He was already on the verge of tears. “You made that necessary, Henri. You have broken the rules which we must all follow. Now, I must do the same.” Crantham looked down. “Why didn’t you come sooner? Why didn’t you stop me? You … could have saved them.” “So could have you. Henri, it is not our place to intervene with what we have created. That is our law.” Crantham looked up again, furious. “I just want to know why?” “Why?” “I want to know! I want to know why you called on me and then you denied me! I was just a child, but I never forgot. I never wanted to forget! I … just wanted to be one of you.” The tears were beyond his control. The Elder watched the man weep before him. Years of confusion, frustration and denial, forever held in check, spilled out from him. Henri had never looked so old, or as young as he did at this moment. “Doctor Crantham, Crantham, no Builder would be one by choice. It is a bleak, thankless chore, a burden. It is the task of a silent caretaker, for all time. It is all joy and creation in the first chapter, but after? When death comes and the door’s unlocked? It is the duty of a select, unlucky few. I spared you that. You were meant to forget, as all the others do.“ “But still you won’t tell me why? Why did you choose Gideon; that miserable, wretched old man? Or Tibor; that murderer! Why wasn’t I chosen?” The Elder considered this for a time. “You weren’t chosen because I feared you would become a far worse monster than Tibor. More joyous than Gideon. You did not become the monster, though; you did create it, however. You created the Red King. And that is why I come to you now.” “I’m sorry.” “It is too late for that now, Henri. Too late for myself, also. You may fly south and I may flee back to my forest, but The Red King will return, in time. We are dead men.” “What can we do?” “Our part in this cycle is over. It falls to those within to find the answer.” The Elder leant forward and peered at Crantham with white, featureless eyes. “It starts, or ends, now.”\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES 2\n\nN\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nI\n\nT\n\nI\n\nO\n\nN\n\nWriting Dave Allsop, Jared Earle, Mark Rapson, Chris ‘Shep’ Shepperson Art Dave Allsop, David Alvarez, Jacob Atienza, Mike Francina, Jon Hodgson, Clint Langley, Alyssa Menold, Mirco Paganessi, Scott Purdy, Aaron J Reilly, Matteo Spirito, James Worrall Layout Jared Earle Rules Chris ‘Shep’ Shepperson, Mark Rapson S5S Rules System Chris ‘Shep’ Shepperson Logistics Mark Rapson Proofreaders Aric Wieder with Jamie Cross, Kim Rapson & the Kickstarter Backers Nightfall Games are Dave Allsop, Jared Earle, Mark Rapson\n\nThe Nightfall Games team would like to especially thank the following: Victoria Braithwaite, Jamie Cross, David Emmett, Jon Hodgson, John Houston, Richard Howkins, Stephen Manklow, Gordon Parton, Kim Rapson, Tony Sephton, Steve Turner, Andrew Waller\n\nAnd our playtesters:\n\nCarl Arnold, Joshua Briggs, Kevin Case, Brendan Falconer, Darren Grainger, Mike Griffin, Matt Jones, Gordon Parton, Marc Potter, Lee Quillan, Toby Thomas, Marc Wilson, Corrine Winwood, Ste Winwood, James Woods\n\nWe would also like to thank all the Kickstarter backers for their support and additional proofreading.\n\nCreated in Adobe InDesign on an Apple iMac i-9990 using Waverly and Adobe Caslon type.

Within this vast, sprawling corporate universe, anything can be bought and sold, from military armaments to fast food, pharmaceuticals to biogenetics, televised media to high fashion, but it must fall under the overarching SLA brand. Anything produced, or even suggested without SLA’s corporate branding is considered treason; corporate crime, which may be punishable by death. SLA Industries hires Operatives - trained specialists who investigate these subversive acts, destroy rival companies and enforce the will of Mr. Slayer.\n\nMr. Slayer Mr Slayer is the head of SLA Industries. For 900 years he has been pivotal in the success and dominance of every star system in the World of Progress. He inspires fear and loyalty in equal measure. He serves as an ideal for some of the most corrupt, self-serving and career driven people in his domain, but Slayer remains an enigma. Despite being the most well-known figure within the World of Progress, only a handful of individuals know who or what he is, the reason behind his name and his facial disfigurement. Those who have even the slightest inkling of his true origins have good reason to fear him all the more.\n\nThe Great Enemy In the World of Progress there have always been whispers of The Great Enemy, but few could easily define precisely what it was. There were rumours of a planet out on the fringes of the SLA universe which imprisoned an ancient terror and if it were ever set free, the entire World of Progress would be destroyed. SLA Industries has countless enemies, but its true nemesis is a being simply referred to as ‘Bitterness’ - the supposed ruler of White Earth. In the present day, a White Earth influenced cult terrorises Mort City, crafting blood magic once thought impossible in SLA owned space. The Shi’An Blood Cult is representative of The Great Enemy on planet Mort. SLA has been forced to create an entire Department, ‘Stigmartyr’, to defend the company and its citizens against the threat of the Bitterness, White Earth and the cult they inspire.\n\nMort The planet Mort is the seat of SLA Industries’ power and home of its Head Office. Centuries of industrial pollution and environmental neglect has ravaged the planet, leaving it beset with endless toxic rains and poisonous, grey landscapes. Spread across the surface of Mort are a series of city states, each dedicated to the service of SLA, but the most notorious is Mort City itself. At its highest artificial peak sits the gargantuan Head Office building. Beneath, an entire class system trickles down, from the most wealthy in opulent Uptown, all the way down to the subterranean slums of Downtown, where the unemployed masses are trapped in their squalid apartments with nothing but an endless stream of SLA brand televised media to keep them company.\n\nT h e W h i s t l i n g B r i d g e P r oto c o l SLA Industries, and the World of Progress it inhabits, is being attacked on all sides from enemies it had promised extinct or claimed had never existed at all. Yet, in 903sd, these ancient enemies returned and sought revenge. Within Mort City itself the Shi’An Cult, directly influenced and led by White Earth, is gaining traction among the Downtown populace. SLA has always secretly feared that a day may come when its secrets may be uncovered and certain uncomfortable truths would be brought to light and so, during the Formation of SLA Industries, a protocol was put in place to reestablish order and safeguard against certain destruction. Its codename was Whistling Bridge and it has been met with an equal share of praise and dread. The Whistling Bridge Protocol’s edicts have only been read by the top Departmental Heads at SLA Industries and they know the directives set forth will reshape the World of Progress. Two sides are emerging, for and against the Protocol and the changes it will invoke. Now, as the Shi’An cult expands its sphere of influence, Conflict Races, who were thought long dead, invade the SLA universe and with the recent acknowledgement of Dream Entities materialising in the World of Progress, the Whistling Bridge draws ever closer to execution.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nT\n\nH\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES\n\nE\n\nO\n\nP\n\nSLA Industries has had unprecedented success over the centuries. One does not amass such wealth and accomplishment without forging a few enemies along the way. SLA Industries has so many, in fact, that it has been forced to categorise its opponents into four distinct groups.\n\nC o\n\nr\n\np\n\no\n\nr a t\n\ne\n\nThe recurrent threat to SLA has always come from those with ambition, drive and recklessness. Those who want to imitate SLA Industries, whilst also tearing it down. These are the corporate enemies and terrorist organisations. They create competing products and attempt to destabilise SLA’s power structure. These companies invariably rise and fall; destroyed by the company’s loyal and efficient SLA Operatives, but two main forces endured throughout the centuries: DarkNight and Thresher. Smaller entrepreneurs are referred to as Soft Companies and continually try to undercut SLA with rival sodas, pharmaceuticals, fast food and cheap weaponry. They reap potentially lucrative rewards, but probably at considerable cost. “Look, it’s pretty simple really: SLA will come down hard on you for creating your poxy little indie brand, okay? Don’t matter what it is: they’ll kill you whether it’s competitor power armour or tinned beans. Right? Never ever try to take the cash from SLA’s pocket. It’s like signing your own Extermination Warrant. Gotta say, these rival Scrummy Cakes are pretty nice though. Pity this here is the last one in existence.” ‘Big Ted’, Human Operative, SCL 7, squad ‘Destroy All Carrien’\n\nC o\n\nn\n\nf\n\nl\n\ni c\n\nt\n\nSLA has long claimed that the ancient Conflict Races were extinct; defeated and forgotten nine hundred years ago. Now these lost species are creeping back into the World of Progress from the lawless region known as Conflict Space, determined to enact vengeance on the company that betrayed them and stole their worlds. They are a little known threat on Mort, but on the War Worlds these various Conflict Races are destroying SLA’s armies. It is not surprising as these aliens were bred for nothing but war and death. Some Conflict Aliens have reached Mort however and landed in SLA’s industrial No-Go Zone, where they plot, watch and wait. “I’ve had a few run ins with the Conflict Aliens and they’ve got that same dead eyed look that the Dream Entities have. They have hatred in their gaze, but it’s like, I dunno … not their hatred? They rage, they fight and murder, but something else is pulling the strings.” Ross Ackerley Reed, Human Operative, SCL 8a, squad ‘Perfect Gallows’\n\n4\n\nP\n\nO S\n\nI\n\nT\n\nI\n\nO\n\nN\n\nThese range from those who seek revenge for past wrongs and those who hate by their very natures, to those who wish to destroy SLA’s corporate system and rival companies who simply desire to supplant it.\n\nC\n\nu\n\nl t\n\nThe streets of Downtown breed madness and despair. The marginalised citizens will turn to any messiah figure that offers hope; real or imagined. As such, religious cults of all denominations are rife in the slums. For centuries SLA was content to let these people stagnate in their own delusion; they were barely a threat. This has all changed with the emergence of the Shi’An Cult, with its strong ties to White Earth and genuine spiritual powers. No other force has been capable of attracting so many of the downtrodden and disturbed. The numbers of converted Downtown citizens steadily rises. The cult seeks worship, bedlam and blood. “SLA has had its time. That time is over. We must end them all, spill their blood and usher in a new age of violence and liberation. We are Shi’An.” Elliot Raik, High Priest of South Sewers\n\nC o\n\nl\n\nl\n\na t\n\ne\n\nr a\n\nl\n\nThese are the enemies spawned from the universe SLA has created; by-products of their corporate greed, neglect and corruption. Without the wholesale exploitation of SLA Industries, creatures like the Carrien, Cannibals and, more recently, the Dream Entities, simply would not exist. SLA Industries created much of the threats now known as Collateral, initially to serve the company. They proved uncontainable and broke free into lower recesses of Downtown and the ruins of the Cannibal Sectors. Disturbed inventions like the Manchines and Scavs now pose a serious threat to life on Mort. “Oh yeah, I’m aware of the new terms that Threat Analysis is using to group our enemies. But seriously, Collateral? Collateral!? I mean this is totally disinge-,… disenjanu-, … totally not honest, right? I mean how do you just class the whole of Cannibal Sector 1 as just collateral? I tell you; last week when Shiver Private Bridges was getting his guts chewed out of his body by a Cannibal Termagant he wasn’t crying ‘ooh, help, someone come and get this Collateral off of me.” Shiver Pvt. 1st Class Cara Killoran , Bridgehead Echo Beach\n\n5\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES “Look, all I ever wanted to be was a SLA Operative. That daydream is not exceptional in any way; everyone wants to be a SLA Op. You know why? Because SLA Ops are the only people who don’t get shat on in the World of Progress. Except they do. All the time. And that’s what working for SLA is like. Accepting certain truths. Facing inconvenient realities. You don’t know this going in, but you certainly know it on your way out. But hey, maybe I’m being a little unfair. It’s not about accepting the truth, because once you know the truth you’ll wish you didn’t. What working for SLA is really about is accepting the lie. What is the lie? The lie is that there’s just one lie. There are too many to count. The company is built on lies. The lie that SLA controls everything. The lie that working for SLA will solve your problems. The lie that you are serving the public. The lie that there are no hidden truths. If you decide to work for SLA accept this: you are going to do what you’re told. You are going to kill good and bad people. You are going to discover things about the company and yourself, that will mess you up. You are going to feed the lie.” Garren Mayfield, Human Operative, SCL 4b, squad Milk and Two Milgrams\n\nThe World of Progress is a science-fiction image of the 1980s, where the fax machine spews out information alongside greenscreen computers and vat-grown biogenetic monsters. Exotic aliens compete with humans for work in an overgrown city that plunges deep underground. Mort, the planet on which the game is set, is the capital of the World of Progress, a dark miserable place where it never stops raining. The players are projected into a world that feels tense, dangerous and claustrophobic. When you play SLA Industries, you never know what’s around the next corner and never know which facts are truths and which are lies.\n\nPLAYING SLA INDUSTRIES Players in SLA Industries take on the role of Operatives, the highly-trained and well-equipped freelancers that serve as the company’s agents, investigators and enforcers. Operatives perform tasks for both a pay packet and the promise of an increase in their security clearance level (SCL), as both provide them access to an increased standard of living, better equipment, progression up the corporate ladder and sponsorship opportunities. Most of all though, they strive for the one thing that everyone in the media-driven World of Progress wants: Notoriety. A SLA Operative always has a job to do. It is not always a glamorous one; a typical assignment (known as a BPN) may consist of anything from exterminating giant rats or carnivorous pigs in a sewer, to securing and retrieving an ancient artefact of the Ebonite species. Characters progress along within the campaign, gaining credits, security clearance and infamy. They can spend their hard-earned credits on better equipment, stronger armour, more deadly weapons, powerful combat drugs or something a little bit different, like a down-payment on a Life After Death account, ensuring that even death can’t stop them. Each of the nine different species offers its own play style, each armed with unique species abilities, from the studious Neophron to the drug-addled Frother, from the brutish Stormer to the quick-witted Wraithen, from the versatile Human to the honour-bound Shaktar. Pick the species that suits you best and bring them to life.\n\nINTRODUCTION Welcome to this, the SLA Industries roleplaying game 2nd Edition core rulebook. Within this tome you will find everything you need to play the SLA Industries roleplay game.\n\nWHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME? At its most basic premise, a roleplaying game, or RPG, is a tabletop game within which players assume the roles of different characters in a fictional setting. These characters are represented by a range of statistics and rulesets unique to each. The story’s progression and action is resolved through discussion and the use of dice. One person is the GM, or Games Master and it is their job to lead the storytelling. In many respects, the GM is the director of a movie and the players are the improv actors.\n\nWhat you will need to play\n\nABOUT SLA INDUSTRIES\n\nApart from this book you will need a set of 6 ten-sided dice (often called d10s for short) per player. One of these dice needs to be a different colour to the rest. A few pens and pencils should also be available to the players. Other items that may be very useful include a GM Screen, which protects the GM’s notes and dice rolling from the players. Many players also like to use miniatures and pre-drawn maps, especially in combat situations, or specially designed RPG websites and chat rooms. Given that games can take a few hours, if you are hosting you may want to consider getting in some drinks or snacks (or getting the players to bring them) too.\n\nSLA Industries (pronounced “Slay Industries”) was first published in Scotland in 1993. The game is a horror noir sciencefiction set in a dystopian reality in which the majority of the known universe is either owned or indirectly controlled by the eponymous corporation SLA Industries. The game incorporates many adult themes with tropes from the cyberpunk, gothic horror and conspiracy genres. SLA Industries is considered one of the first and best examples of the Splatterpunk genre in RPGs. SLA Industries, the company is a huge corporate entity that rules over not only Mort City, but the entire planet and the expanding universe. Mr Slayer, the owner of SLA Industries, aptly refers to this as ‘The World of Progress’.\n\n6\n\nThis edition of SLA Industries\n\nGlossary of Gaming Terms\n\nSLA Industries 2nd Edition features an entirely new d10based rules system, built from the ground up and designed to offer a streamlined and cinematic gaming experience. Ratings Points are a new mechanic for 2nd Ed, earned from facetime in front of the camera, or through bravery, extreme success and spectacular failure. These points enable players to perform cinematic feats that defy the norm and impress audiences. When things don’t quite work out, there is the new Luck mechanism that allows players to alter or re-roll dice results. Both Ratings Points and Luck are a finite resource, however and should not be used frivolously. We are very lucky to still have the original creative team at the core of this RPG. Brief stories, character quotes and other in-game content from them bring The World of Progress to life. SLA Industries 2nd Edition is crammed full of colour art, presenting one of the best visualised worlds in the RPG arena and the most visually stunning representation of The World of Progress to date.\n\nThe following abbreviations are used throughout the book. PC:\n\nPlayer Character. A character controlled by a player. Non-Player Character. A character controlled by the Games Master to be interacted with by the PCs. This could be anything from a street ganger, highranking corporate or even a shopkeeper. Games Master. The arbitrator and storyteller whose job it is to control the world around the player characters.\n\nNPC:\n\nGM:\n\nWhat do you need to know? Below is a very brief description of the key characters, organisations and terms seen in the World of Progress. Know this, know SLA. Mr Slayer Intruder\n\nThe boss of SLA Industries. Mr Slayer’s right hand man and primary enforcer. Bitterness The ruler of White Earth; the great enemy of SLA Industries. Cloak Division SLA’s protectors of truth, created to control information leaks. Naga 7 Archivists and researchers of dangerous truths; serves as advisors for SLA propaganda. Shivers The SLA sanctioned police force. SLA Operatives Troubleshooters for SLA’s problems. You, the players. Props Local mercenaries for hire. Shi’An Cult Largest growing religion in the World of Progress; a direct threat to SLA Industries. Conflict Aliens The ancient long-forgotten enemies of SLA Industries, now returning to the World of Progress to seek revenge. Oppressor Powers The larger companies that actively seek the downfall of SLA Industries, like DarkNight and Thresher. Soft Companies Small-time startups or subversive entrepreneurs trying to break into the market. BPN Blueprint News files, the main way SLA Operatives pick up jobs. SCL Security Clearance Level, the lower the better. Credits/Uni Credits are a currency used internally by SLA Industries while Unis (universal currency) are the public currency. There are ten Unis to a credit, but only Unis appear as coins and notes.\n\nPreparing to play the Game The first step to playing a game of SLA Industries is creating player characters. This is fully explained in the Character Creation chapter. Many players really enjoy doing this and will often create more than one. Alternatively you can get hold of the Quick Start which can be downloaded as a PDF or bought from any number of outlets (ask your FLGS or favourite internet shop, or check out our website: www.nightfall.games). While the characters are being created the GM needs to plan out their campaign. Again the Quick Start is a great place to start, but one of the real joys for GMs and players alike, is the creation process of forming your own campaign. Within this book are all sorts of ideas and stories from which the GM can weave a multifaceted world of adventure for the players to investigate. Important: When playing a roleplaying game, especially one with adult themes, it is critical that all the players are comfortable, or at least comfortable with being made to feel uncomfortable, with the situations their characters will find themselves in. Please check with your fellow players before you expose them to anything likely to upset them. This is especially important when playing with players that you do not know or know well. SLA Industries is an adult game, it is recommended that players are at least 15 years old.\n\nPlaying the Game Once you have created your characters and the GM has planned out the story, all players should make sure their fellows are happy with any planned strong or unpleasant themes. Everyone gets set for the game by gathering around the table, with their dice, pens, character sheets, snacks, etc.. The GM normally sets the scene and each of the players introduce their characters to each other. Often people like to put on accents or act out their characters in great depth, but you don’t need to. As the story progresses the GM will direct the story and enable the players to do what they want: investigate, fight and converse etc..\n\n7\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES\n\nHISTORY “They were the precursors to the Suppressor Powers, the governing forces within the Known Universe. They desired war, blood and violence yet in many respects they weren’t so different to us. They simply wanted more, unceasingly wanting of everything and whilst we offered the 3Ps Contract, the Conflict Races chose a more blunt and uncompromising approach: they simply offered death.” Intruder’s War Diaries, 760sd\n\n“ We destroyed the Conflict Races. We created the World of Progress. We overcome all adversity. We write our histor y. We make fantasy a reality. We are SLA Industries.”\n\nIntruder’s War Diaries, 585sd.\n\nThe company known as SLA Industries exists within the World of Progress but permeates every part of it. SLA Industries has conquered the majority of it and is preparing to absorb the rest. To put such an indelible mark on such a vast region of space has taken centuries; there is no escape from its influence nor its presence. The food one eats and cars one drives are produced and sold by SLA Industries, whether you like it or not. Every person living in the World of Progress has strong feelings about the company that rules over them. There is hate, anger and love, but what binds all is fear. There has been little over the nine centuries to challenge SLA’s authority and its dominance is all most people have ever known. In order to live and survive in the World of Progress one must accept that SLA Industries is an evil company, which in turn has created an evil universe and the company is now the only power capable of keeping it all under control. The reality is hidden under a veneer of glitz and glamour but what truly lies at the core of the World of Progress is a tyrannical regime that is gradually coming apart at the seams. What follows in an exploration of the nine centuries of SLA Industries’ growth and dominance. It is a long catalogue of perceived victories built on corruption, betrayal and countless lost lives. It also charts the company’s numerous failures and oversights, so often attributed to SLA’s capitalist core ideologies and its complete and utter lack of empathy. Nine centuries of war and lies, nine centuries of poverty and wealth, nine centuries of expansion and oppression. Upon unswerving ruthlessness, SLA Industries has built its foundations and set forth from there.\n\nFive primary species rose to prominence. The Grosh - Also known as the Root Dogs, these were bioengineers who were content to ravage any life system and bend its genetic code to the will of the Grosh. The Root Dogs built vast, animalistic armies known as The Herd. The Grosh were feared above all others. The Momics - The Momics were the slave masters of the Ebonite species. They drained the Ebonites of their Flux and feasted on their flesh. Largely an indolent and apathetic species who chose to spend most of their existence in a state of meditation, or torpor. They would nonetheless burst into furious activity if challenged or more importantly, when their primary food source was appropriated. The Thallasians - They were the original creators of the specialist combat armour found on their home world of Thallas. In temperament the Thallasian were similar to the Krell, revelling in violence and warfare, but strains of their species were focused on crafting superior weapons and armour. The Herracleum - A deeply religious plant-like species who sought to conquer worlds and cultivate the surface of enemy planets, replacing whole ecosystems with their own verdant culture and natural mysticism. The Krell - The Krell were an especially brutal, militaristic species, entirely led by the Krella; the female of the species. The male counterparts had been degraded over centuries into rabid and increasingly psychotic monsters. The genetic degradation was a by-product of the Grosh’s aim to alter the Krell’s genetic code to allow incredible rates of regeneration.\n\nTHE CONFLICT ERA - PRE SD\n\nEndless war\n\nThe Known Universe was caught in a relentless cycle of war. SLA Industries’ historical documents are scant on the details of how and why these interplanetary disputes continued to rage century after century and why no diplomatic agreement could ever be reached. The various Conflict Races were forever trying to gain supremacy over each other and most spent considerable time and finance improving and upgrading their weaponry and\n\nConflict Races Long before SLA Industries created the World of Progress. the macrocosm it inhabits was called The Known Universe. It spread across countless solar systems, with each being loosely governed by a supreme force. Threat Analysis has detailed accounts of almost all these ancient powers. In nearly every case, the Conflict Races were indisputably merciless, without a shred of consideration for any external species beyond its own.\n\n8\n\nH ISTORY technology. The Krell at one time entered a brief alliance with the Grosh to increase the ferocity of their infantry and grant them the capacity for regeneration, but this bond quickly fell apart when the species’ leaders, the Krella, discovered the genetic work, along with the gift of fast regeneration and neurotoxin in the saliva, had turned their soldiers into near uncontrollable, slavering monsters. One can only assume that the Grosh scientists fully intended this and inevitably lead to further decades of brutal strife and destruction between them. Such betrayals were common amongst the great warring species of that time period. “In order to understand why the Conflict Era endured for so long you have to take into account the species involved at the highest end. You have to consider the personalities, the cultures that bred the likes of the Krell, the Thallasians and then try to put them in the same metaphoric space; war was inevitable, but more importantly it was actively sought. The Conflict Races were shaped purely for warfare, they had no desire to explore or fulfil anything they perceived as a lesser ambition. They were what history required of them and only when SLA Industries arrived in the Known Universe were the Conflict Races obligated to serve another purpose.” Professor Jonathan E W Lisberg, Naga 7 Historian (2nd Head)\n\nIntruder An important figure during the Conflict Era was Slayer’s right hand man - Intruder. He operated chiefly as an assassin; sent out to destroy SLA’s political rivals, the nickname ‘Clockwork Killer’ suggesting he was simply a weapon utilised by the company, but his duties were surprisingly far reaching. He helped to liberate the Ebonites from their Momic overlords and during the years he fought the Conflict Aliens, he contributed his experiences to the Stormer project. First and foremost though, he was the shadow who slipped silently into military outposts and royal palaces to eliminate the opposition. He was chosen for the role because of his skills in butchery and knowledge of anatomy and that he was master of a collection of powers unknown to anyone else in the Known Universe during the Conflict Era, something similar yet separate to the Ebb. Reports back to the enemies of SLA listed him as ‘Kilneck’ and that he was seemingly indestructible. “No, I am unsurprised you have been unable to find a member of the Kilneck in SLA owned space, well, aside from Intruder himself. Within the deep spirals of Conflict Space, however? A different matter entirely, but do not press me any further on the matter.” Mattifet Ketaptor, The Neophron Empress As far as anyone knew he was a species of one, as many of the Conflict Powers searched in vain to track down other Kilneck. In the 900 years of SLA’s rule there has never been a reported instance of another Kilneck individual in the entire World of Progress, leading to potential theories of his nature. Either Intruder is concealing his true origins. Are there no other Kilneck; have there ever been or has he destroyed all others of his kind?\n\n9\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES Conflict Aliens. SLA produced technology, which had been bought wholesale by their enemies, like missile guidance systems and other state of the art ordnance, shut down at the commencement of the Big Picture. The mass destruction that followed would not be that of SLA Industries, it would represent the end of the Conflict Powers and the era of which they reigned. The last great battle of the Conflict Era was waged on Mort City’s Central Outskirts, in which the ancient Momic masters, known as The Haunted, used a primitive form of reality folding to launch their final attack at the heart of SLA. Two hundred Momic faced down four thousand Malice Stormers and in the resulting bloodbath, SLA proved victorious. The battle culminated in the surviving Haunted burning their remaining flux, creating a vast orb of blinding light. This strange flux anomaly has endured on the surface of Mort, indestructible, mysterious and restless ever since, it came to be known as the White. After initial investigation, it was largely left alone, until an Ebon pupil of SLA Industries, Durer, entered it. What later emerged was a monstrosity, a strange mix of Ebon and Momic. This represented the birth of the Necanthropes - an entirely new strain of Ebonite, which would come to rule over them in a similar manner to the Momics who had come before. Only two major Conflict Races actively sided with SLA Industries prior to the Big Picture; the Wraithen and the Shaktars and as the company was reshaped they found gainful employment and protection. The Ebonites, the people previously subservient to the Momics were also liberated and brought into the fold. Other species fell somewhere in the middle of the supposed victory conditions. The Neophrons, for example, took no part in any of the conflicts and purposefully avoided any negotiations with SLA Industries. They recognised the change that was coming and quietly returned to their home system in Conflict Space. It would take many centuries for the Neophron and other equally less aggressive species to return to the World of Progress, but when they did they returned as allies, rather than challengers, to the company’s reign. What remained of the Conflict Aliens fled into deep space, SLA Industries was victorious and its employees rejoiced. They hoped it would be the dawning of a new era and they were right. Mostly. Everything was set to progress, but not necessarily to everyone’s advantage.\n\nThe Big Picture Five years prior to the Standard Date (sd.), SLA Industries emerged in the Known Universe, acting primarily as a highquality arms dealer for any side with the money to spend. SLA Industries made everything from firearms to power armour to military grade vehicles; even custom armaments tailored towards specific requirements. What made SLA stand out especially was its capacities in the field of biogenetics. The most popular products available from SLA Industries was the biogen soldiers, known commonly as the Stormers. The first variant available in the Conflict Era market was the Malice. A 9 foot tall, muscular monstrosity that had a winning combination of strength, speed and savagery. Countless Conflict Races bought into the Stormer Program, so that they could bolster their ranks with Malice Stormers, but also, in the case of the Grosh and Thalassians, to study and dissect the creation, hoping to recreate the Malice for their own purposes, but their efforts proved fruitless. Not all of the species bought into SLA’s products and remained their enemies from the very start, particularly the Krell and Momics, with whom SLA fought bitterly. The Krell even served as a rudimentary inspiration for the Stormers. Ultimately, SLA betrayed the Conflict Races and they fell victim to Mr Slayer’s secret strategy known simply as ‘The Big Picture’. Over the years, SLA set about spinning a series of rumours that outlined the company’s future plans and also its inherent weaknesses. The aim was to prompt a direct attack on SLA and therefore the company’s base of operations, the planet - Jeth. These rumours ranged from hidden new weapon stashes, power minerals found exclusively on Jeth, an experimental drug that would apparently change the landscape of the Known Universe and even a colony of fabled Kilneck living out in the dense jungle regions. It was almost entirely lies, specific triggers that would spur the Conflict Powers into action and drive them to focus direct attacks on SLA throughout the Known Universe. “The company didn’t just enter the Known Universe to sell you guys a bunch of weapons and monsters. That Slayer guy is here looking for something and I suspect it’s there on Jeth. I have contacts who believe it’s a mineral deposit; something used in the creation of Stormers but I’ve also heard mention of some kind of ‘portal’. It’s all hearsay and speculation to most Conflict Powers but I know more than most. Look, see this here? This drug phial - I believe it was created by SLA Industries, but it isn’t on sale yet. It may never be on sale. I’m telling you, Legatus, because we’re old friends. And SLA hasn’t given me a pay rise in 7 months. The company comes off as tough, but they’re weak, they’re nothing. You and your kind could have it all. If you have the guts to reach out and take it.” SLA Salesman John Smith, addressing a potential client, Conflict Era\n\nTHE FORMATION ERA - 0-100SD The Storm\n\nThe dust had settled. Slayer had ended the Conflict Era and won. The history books would say that the Conflict Races were all but extinct, but in truth many survivors had fled into true emptiness and past a blank world upon which Slayer had imprisoned his darkest secret. There was a person who had a great stake in all things, but was to be denied, even in death and beyond. This ‘silent partner’ was a young man and within the freshly defined confines of the SLA Universe he could not be destroyed. He had already died once. He could, however, be forgotten.\n\nThey would of course be conducting their military assaults with Stormers and therein lay the Big Picture. The Stormers instantaneously turned on their new masters before they could ever reach Jeth, slaughtering countless\n\n10\n\nH ISTORY\n\n11\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES Back before SLA Industries was even conceived, a pact was made to confine this controversial individual, to rob him of potential and ensure that he could not impact on the affairs of the company, nor the plans for what would become the World of Progress. Upon arrival he was deposited on a desolate remote planet in the Known Universe. This planet had no name and the vast majority of its landmass was desert and besides its enigmatic prisoner, the only other inhabitants were the things he feared the most.\n\ncompany; it was just the ordinary folk who knew that this saviour was going to erase their identity and freedoms, in their entirety. If the Conflict Races could be taken down so easily, the citizens of the fading Known Universe would pose little threat to SLA. Within a generation of the end of The Formation, historical events of resistance where buried and forgotten. As SLA entered its greatest years of economic wealth, there was no question, the company was now all consuming. SLA owned and ruled every facet of life and that was the new normal. At the beginning of the Formation, the planet Jeth was the epicentre of the new World of Progress. Over the previous 25 years, SLA had already set up bases across the planet, but after the enemy species had fled into what would be known as Conflict Space (the title of the vast untamed regions beyond SLA controlled space), SLA would focus much of its efforts on building the Capital City-state on the planet and they weren’t prepared to let the indigenous Jethians stand in their way. SLA Industries maintained a chilly relationship with the Jethians. The company swiftly set about ravaging the planet of its resources as it built its first primary city - Mort. SLA had little to no regard for any treaties signed that would protect the Jethian’s natural habitats and when the council of Jeth tried to prevent the construction of nuclear reactors so close to their sacred colonies, the delegates sent to protest the issue simply disappeared. All that could be done was to quietly close their borders to the industrial giant and strive to protect whatever still remained of their culture and tradition. Progress was as inevitable as the rapid climate change and string of natural disasters. The planet Jeth soon became synonymous with its main city, the headquarters of SLA Industries. The planet Jeth became the planet Mort, like so many other things in the World of Progress, the name Jeth was lost to the aeons of time, to be forgotten by all but a few scholars and librarians.\n\n“Tyde, I have spent many years conditioning Brent Walker’s brain to respond to certain stimuli and to comply with demands. Some of my patients require simple encouragement and mild praise in order to produce, Brent however tends towards obstinacy, he requires fear and discipline, to work. Brent suffers from a condition called Pithecophobia, which is an innate fear of primates. A chimpanzee was purchased and installed at The Foundation. This is the disciplinary tool we will use in Brent’s reeducation. An hour trapped in a room with that creature is guaranteed to make him compliant with the Foundation expectations of him. By now Brent would rather kill a family member than spend five additional minutes in a confined space with our pet. The time is coming, Tyde, when he will transfer; that is unavoidable and the only means of containing him is to place him among the denizens that fill him with the greatest dread. You cannot kill Brent Walker, but you can suppress him. You will do this by driving him irrevocably insane.” Catalogue/Naga 7 documentation *redacted* On the first anniversary of the World of Progress, Slayer felt the storm raging across that distant world. Whilst corporates and Departmental Heads laughed, patted each other’s backs and sipped staggeringly expensive champagne, Slayer could feel the fury building in the furthest reaches of his domain. He could smell the burning sands and matted fur and then, he could feel the presence, searching. Like a blind man probing for a lost object. It was the first time Slayer felt the searing pain in his chest. It faded, but never left him completely.\n\nMandrake\n\nAnother of SLA Industries most promising Ebonite pupils - Mandrake, boarded the Ebb Foldship Yung and charted its course for Conflict Space in 2sd. It was classed as an exploratory mission, but in truth it was a further inspection of the departed Conflict Aliens. Mandrake was to report back in 5 years and relay his findings to Head Office, but once the Yung passed beyond the boundaries of SLA owned space, at the Gates of Herodotus, the Foldship was believed lost or destroyed. It would however return in nine hundred years, only then it would be carrying Mandrake’s descendants and their Momic slavers.\n\nConstruction of Mort City 1-56sd\n\nThroughout the course of the Conflict Era, SLA Industries had been little more than a weapons and technology manufacturer, but after the Big Picture a whole new picture began to form. This was a business plan that would cover all aspects of life and commerce. SLA was going to take over governments, star systems and buy out and rebrand every conceivable item in the Known Universe over a century-long mission. This was the groundwork of what SLA Industries would be right up until the present day and historical records define the period as The Formation. What was once the Known Universe would be rebranded the World of Progress. This period in SLA’s history is some of the bloodiest; worse even than the close of the Conflict Era. The Known Universe was not quite prepared for such a hostile and grand takeover. SLA was met with some resistance, except this was not the brutal Conflict Races standing up against the\n\n“We strike out into the unknown, looking for answers to questions we haven’t even asked and we are anticipating answers we don’t even want. We do this to find out what lies beyond; know that we do it for Progress.” Mandrake, Foldship Yung departure, 2sd\n\nThe Whistling Bridge Protocol SLA Industries was fully aware of all the dreadful things it had done in order to rise victorious and perhaps also knew of the evils to come. The company had already begun limiting\n\n12\n\nH ISTORY\n\ninformation going forward and erasing what had come to pass. Despite these efforts, it could not wipe the Conflict Races from its history, nor the power that was growing on White Earth, from reality. Their presence would always remain, in some shape or form. White Earth was left to fester and all survivors of the previous conflicts had fled into the lawless Conflict Space.They were all gone, for now at least, but ignoring the possibility of retaliation, even centuries in the future, was imprudent. SLA Industries’ field of influence now encompassed the Known Universe. Their old adversaries had fled to deep space. Two plans were set in motion. Aethermen, under the employ of Naga 7 Division were sent into Conflict Space to watch, evaluate and report back findings, then secondly, a set of orders, based on the likelihood of future reprisals, were drawn up. This agreement would come to be known as the Whistling Bridge Protocol. In 5sd, it was simply a first draft of proposals, but every 50 years up until the present day the Protocol has been revised and reassessed, based on the changes and advancements of the World of Progress.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, the Gartto Tundra transformed into a polluted wasteland, its original Jethian title would be forgotten and it would simply be known as the No-Go Zone. The pillaging was planet-wide and within six years, SLA Industries had bled the planet dry; all botanical life on the planet had been utilised until nothing remained. Jeth’s natural fauna suffered a similar fate with only a meagre list of the most aggressive and adaptive species left alive. Mort would come to consider them as nothing more than mere vermin.\n\nMort’s First Police Force\n\nIt was exciting times for the company and countless workers flocked to Mort from across the new World of Progress to find work in the fast expanding empire. With all the hopes and dreams of corporate life came the inevitable consequences. Crime was rife in the streets of Mort City and the company was struggling to deal with the lawlessness, so, with the help of one of SLA’s more resourceful Operatives - Jonathan Bellwood, the first legitimate police patrols arrived in Mort City. These were the men and women in green - the Shivers. From 58sd, up to the present day, the Shiver Units are easily the most common sight in Mort City, spawning generations of recruits to patrol the dangerous streets. They are divided by loyalty to the company and corruption bred from the overbearing capitalistic society of Mort.\n\nMort Earns Its Name\n\nSLA didn’t waste any time in stripping Jeth of its natural resources. It drew oil, mined for minerals and cut down vast forests and jungle for lumber. It set up countless factories and production plants in the Gartto Tundra. This region was arguably the first Jethian region to fall to the avarice of SLA. The company stained the skies with toxic fumes and black smoke, forever damaging the upper atmosphere.\n\n“I am Mort’s most violent Shiver.” Jackson Clyde, Shiver Unit\n\n13\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES northwards, mutating, distorting and eventually transforming into a broken and animalistic species. Their past forgotten, the newly shaped species was driven by little more than hunger and the instinct to survive. The people of Mort City would come to know them as the Carrien. The first horrific sightings of these beings filtered back through to Head Office in early 88sd. They thought it was merely a small band of mutants that could quickly be wiped from the face of Mort. Instead, the Carrien scourge would endure and still be plaguing the sewers of Downtown and the debris of the Cannibal Sector for another eight centuries.\n\nThe Jethians Transformed If Mort was going to be the main base of SLA Industries’ operations it was going to require power and lots of it. The company set about bringing nuclear power stations to the globe. What had once been lush jungle regions were quickly wiped away by industrialism. It was at this time that the company reencountered the Jethians. They were far from happy that the company had invaded their world, stripped away their forests and jungles and begun bulldozing their sacred temples. The Jethians, not an especially warlike species, could only offer a weak form of resistance against the encroachment of SLA. They chose prayer over resistance. The entire Jethian population refused to fight and worse, refused to integrate within the growing company, instead, they flocked to the protection of their equatorial city and temples to beg their therianthropic gods for salvation. Their pleas were never answered; their deities had seen wisdom and fled into Conflict Space. The Fission Belt, a gargantuan ring of nuclear reactors encompassing Mort’s equatorial line erupted to life in 80sd. The Belt’s positioning was strategic, far enough away from Mort City to mitigate radiation spill, but close enough to power Mort City and the new emerging city states across the entire globe. In 87sd, just one year after the last nuclear reactors were completed, a catastrophic meltdown occurred. A lethal gulf stream of radioactive winds encircled the planet. SLA secretly hoped that this ‘unfortunate accident’ would finally kill off the Jethians, but their fate turned out to be much, much worse. Now ravaged by lethal doses of radiation and yet still left alive, the Jethians fled their crumbling ancestral homes and crawled\n\nEXPANSION ERA - 101-200SD\n\nThe next century is recorded as the Expansion Era, although this term is focused primarily on the growth of Mort City, its neighbouring City-States and the industrialisation of the NoGo Zone. Across the World of Progress, the outlook was less rosy and it was in this the second century that the whole concept of ‘Corporate Warfare’ was born. During the Expansion Era, SLA Industries encountered the first true rivals to its power base. SLA may have been the victor, but its position in the World of Progress would clearly be challenged from this era onwards.\n\nRising Population\n\nThe Central Outskirts continued to grow. At first, civilians longing to get out from the gloom of Suburbia flocked to the area, causing a drastic swell of inhabitants. As the years ticked by, more and more off-worlders arrived, setting up home and sharing their resources with SLA Industries. Of course, SLA welcomed the vast majority of these species, new employees for the company, new skill sets and new allies, but as space got tighter, policing the Outskirts became a challenge. The Shivers tasked with thejob in the Central Outskirts now numbered into tens of thousands. They drastically outnumbered Operatives and despite being poorly armed, were tasked with maintaining order in every corner of this sprawling landscape. Despite being great in number, the sheer size of the population meant that to keep it in check, far less security could remain on the perimeter fence to keep an eye on the encroaching Carrien threat.\n\nThe Evolution Of Vermin\n\nIn 103sd, a depleted Shiver force manning the perimeter fence along the Red Stretch reported sightings of a new threat. While the fence had only ever done a mediocre job of keeping out the Carrien, this new foe had simply crushed the fence entirely and brutally murdered entire squads of Shivers keeping watch. Leading huge packs of Carrien through the perimeter was what soon came to be known as a Greater Carrien, a hulking giant standing in excess of 9 ft tall, sporting antlers and a muscular frame that was as stoic as a Stormer. The Greater Carrien struck fear into all those that saw it, an enemy the likes of which most Shivers had never seen. This would be the first of many sightings of Greater Carrien, each leading packs of ravenous scavengers into the Central Outskirts, before eventually disappearing down into the sewers where they began to make homes, carving out great underground halls from the subterranean passageways. The arrival of the Greater Carrien marked an evolutionary step in\n\n14\n\nH ISTORY the Carrien species and the first dreadful sign that they were here to stay.\n\nFree Enterprise The birth of Rival Companies during the Expansion Era, the challengers to SLA, only increased during the Boom Time. As SLA grew more affluent, the greater the desire to carve out an independent corner of the marketplace grew in others. Whilst many competitors were focused on manufacturing competitor goods, the most common of which being weapons, their product range would in turn become their main form of defence when SLA came to challenge them in both retail and battle. Other rivals were hiring out their accumulated combat experience as mercenaries, or simply assumed the roles of raiders, attacking anyone they deemed an easy target.\n\nThe Age of Terrorism\n\nA mercenary force identifying themselves as DarkNight were encountered by a Nitro Legion battalion in 123sd on a remote planet called Horatio. This mercenary force was well equipped and seemingly well financed. In the years that followed, the threat of DarkNight followed the company back to Mort, with a rising number of terrorist attacks taking place on public spaces and key SLA buildings. As the years ticked by, the frequency of these attacks increased, as did DarkNight’s numbers. With the regularity and severity of the attacks growing, SLA Industries had to accept that a very legitimate enemy had arrived on Mort, one determined to hurt the company and incite anarchy among the population of Mort City. DarkNight were the polar opposite of the Carrien, their agents used weapons and armour that challenged the equipment used by SLA Operatives and they thought like the company; true tacticians, not feral savages. SLA could not simply throw Shivers at this threat; it required brains and patience. Very quickly, DN-branded weapons started appearing on the black market, putting military-grade firearms into the hands of civilians. This bold move, challenging SLA on their own biggest enterprise, rapidly earned DarkNight the newly fashioned term of a ‘rival company’ in the arms race, though anyone who had encountered their brutality on the streets of Downtown knew the truth - this was organised crime at its highest level.\n\nThresher\n\n““This isn’t a company. It’s a bunch of cutthroats tear-assing around the World of Progress in big armour looking for vulnerable planets and Ion Ships to plunder. Yes, they fall under the category of Corporate Crime, but I reckon they’re more like a criminal organisation, a syndicate. Thresher armour and weaponry has never been sold by these guys directly. The only thing they’re likely to offer is hail of 11 cal rounds to your face.” Dolores Sutton-Reeves, SLA Corporate, SCL 8 In 232sd, SLA Industries 127th Tech Support group arrived on the water rich Resource World of Thallahs. They discovered a massive hidden complex within a nearby mountain range. Inside they found a vast array of lost alien technology. The Conflict Era had been concluded and largely forgotten for several centuries. The 127th were unfamiliar with Thallasian technology and the considerable skills they had once had in creating powerful antipersonnel armours and superior weaponry. They knew they had landed on a goldmine as they moved through endless rows of mint condition armour, each armed with fully stocked and loaded heavy rifles. Procedure dictated that they report their findings to Head Office, but this was the age of the entrepreneur. A new and major rival company had just appeared in the World of Progress, it was the beginning of Thresher Consortium. What followed were years, bleeding into centuries of infighting within Thresher. Any noble efforts made in its past were dulled by endless raids and bloodshed. Nonetheless, Thresher - the band of exceedingly well equipped raiders, endured. Fighting the morally questionable good fight, yet always fearful one day their precious stocks of technology would run dry and they would never be able to reverse-engineer more.\n\nThe Lure of The Ebb\n\nThough the Ebonite species had been considered an ally to SLA Industries since the Conflict Era and their liberation from the Momics, their numbers on Mort had remained relatively few compared to other species. Intruder had kept company with those Ebonites of standing and urged them to call out to their kin still living on far off worlds. Word of The White had already reached Haxxan - the distant system of Ebonite homeworlds and little persuasion was needed. Ebonites boarded Foldships and made the long haul, bringing with them knowledge and artefacts beyond Naga 7’s wildest dreams. Mort would become the new home to the Ebonites as thousands and thousands of new arrivals were welcomed into the arms of the company, hitting the streets as Operatives and drastically increasing the space travel capabilities of SLA Industries. This influx accelerated the company’s understanding of a great many things, bringing about new levels of innovation and technology. The Ebonite species was here to stay and over the years that followed they would become a major force in the company’s hierarchy, under the leadership and control of the Necanthrope, Preceptor Teeth.\n\nThe Boom Families\n\nIt was during the Boom Time that the World of Progress truly galvanised its Upper Class. Many already wealthy families had invested in SLA Industries during The Formation and their return on investment increased dramatically by the year 200sd, helping to delineate the title to a whole generation - The Boom Time; the extended period of economic growth. Families like Hinton, DeFeo, Flense-Bryant and Emmershaw were ‘old money’; rich enough to buy whole planets and live comfortably beyond any laws, aside from the very top rulings from Head Office. To be one of these special investors was to be\n\nTHE BOOM TIME - 200-299SD\n\nThe Boom Time is SLA Industries’ most cherished era; it was when everything was going right - a period of unrivalled prosperity, for a privileged few. It has a style of architecture, dress sense and music characteristic to this time period that is elegant, luxurious and classical.\n\n15\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES filter through to Head Office; disquieting stories of a planet on the verges of the World of Progress. The planet had found an orbit and had a name now: White Earth. It had become one world in a small solar system orbiting the red star - Herodotus. There were disturbing tales of creatures known as ‘First Born’ - the primates introduced to serve as the gaolers for the singular prisoner, but there were now stories emerging of confirmed people on White Earth and a message spread across the backwater worlds - First they were nightmares and then they were clay. The worst story finally reached Slayer’s ears, a tale he had been dreading since the beginning of time; talk of an entity on White Earth simply referred to Bitterness. There were conflicting accounts regarding what exactly Bitterness was. Slayer simply nodded as he was told the stories, but did not respond. He knew exactly what Bitterness was, he had been sensing Brent Walker suffering the brutality of the First Born, year after year, until finally he had became the aggressor. With each victory, Walker reshaped White Earth and its humans. His humanity slipped away. All that now remained was a singular focus - revenge. SLA Industries had found its true enemy and the rains came. Naga 7 Society were asked to conduct further research of White Earth but like the Neophron before them, they feared the entity that ruled on that world, a being they could not restrain or control. By the end of the Boom Time, Naga 7 quietly disappeared from the World of Progress.\n\nBleak Forecast\n\na Boom Family. There were 68 such families during the Boom Time, but it swiftly reduced to 50 as certain households fell into ruin as the Great Downturn occured at the turn of the century. The Boom Time was also the birth of the Corporate Sector, as the World of Progress knows it today. It was dawning of Mort’s great law firms and investment banking, with subsidiaries such as Hinton Moss and Rowan, Garthon Investments and Sillindrad (the Ebonite family responsible for the creation of Dark Lament), dominating Central and Uptown. The Boom families had the best of everything, going as far as to create the best schools and universities in the World of Progress, putting their own progeny through esteemed foundations like Buxbridge, Greenwood and Napwell.\n\nIn 295sd, SLA had finally destroyed the upper atmosphere of Mort and the rains began to fall. They would never cease. The endless downpour marked the end of the Boom Times and the advent of a much darker period. “It’s been over six hundred years since the end of the Boom Time and I think SLA Industries has never quite gotten over that era. It’s been brutal and bloody ever since. It was the last time we felt like we had a stake in the company’s future and its expansion. Nowadays we’re just supposed to do what we’re told and be happy with whatever we’ve got. Still, you can see traces of that glorious era even today. When you’re in Head Office you can see it in the architecture and iconography: that’s pure Boom Time. It’s a time and place that SLA’s desperately trying to get back to, yet never will. It’s gone forever.” Angela Maybridge, Historian, Threat Analysis\n\nFormal Education\n\nIn 279sd SLA Industries opened the Meny Training Facility in Mald. Meny was and still is, more a city of education rather a singular building complex. It covers all aspects of Operative and high-level Employee Status Education. In 279sd, Meny was a five-building interconnecting network, covering primarily the earliest forms of SLA professions. Over the centuries it has expanded considerably, to cover newer training packages and faculties dedicated to schooling Cloak Division and Stigmartyr agents. These standalone faculties, are in reality independent universities, with their own funding and some of the best protected buildings in the World of Progress.\n\nThe Boom Time had been wonderful for the super affluent, but in the hundred years of prosperity it had created an everincreasing class divide. By the end of the 200s there had been a visible decline in the standard of living of the people living on lower incomes especially in the population centres on Mort, but also throughout the entire World of Progress. Most were learning to accept hard times and whatever strife lay ahead, but others were cracking under the accumulated stress and desperation of the times they were living in. A craving for violent revolt swept through the population.\n\nWhite Earth\n\nThe blank world used to entrap Brent Walker had never been given a name before. It and its prisoner had been placed as far away as to be forgotten forever, but in 295sd reports began to\n\n16\n\nH ISTORY you could say that they helped to shape what we watch, what we see on our SLA manufactured television sets today. SLA clearly owes a debt to Brutalic, but the company secretly prays it doesn’t see a resurgence.” Angela Maybridge, Historian, Threat Analysis\n\nTHE GREAT DOWNTURN - 300-399SD Whatever wealth and prosperity was achieved during The Boom Time took a sharp downturn in the early years of the fourth century. Only the truly rich would remain largely unaffected by the crash of 300. It was believed that it was the collapse of Salvation Tower which caused the financial crash but it was actually a massive rise and subsequent dip in military stocks and spending. The economic crash was felt across Mort and throughout the World of Progress, particularly on Industrial planets.\n\nBrutalic was a force that struck SLA at the worst possible time and prevented its typically swift recovery for many years. The fourth century saw a further rise in rival companies and was forced to pump huge amounts of its capital into military applications and the troops. SLA was also shifting much of its weapon manufacturing to cheaper planets. This hit the factory workers in Mort’s Central Outskirts very hard, marking the start of mass unemployment on Mort - a trend that unfortunately continues to the present date. Industrial worlds all across SLA’s reign saw loss of workforce, food shortages and were left vulnerable. The Brutalic movement impacted these woes, as countless agents of its savage ideology attacked SLA, on the city streets and even on the war worlds, sending whole armies of suicidal madmen to tear down the company’s rule. Brutalic’s funding was coming from one of the original Boom families - the House of Bechard on New Paris. It had the financial means in which to bankroll this new company and equip its agents.\n\n“In the Boom Time you get all these wealthy bastards gulping down fancy pop and lighting their fat cigars from burning homeless people and all that posh nonsense. Then you get everyone underneath wanting a piece of that action, so up come all the rival companies. What do you get? More fighting, more War Worlds. SLA’s up top at the end of the last century, but now they’ve got to hold that position, dogs biting at their heels. More spending on ammunition, military technology and all the other shit that makes people dead. SLA wins, again. Then it loses, big time. All the stocks and shares drop dramatically. They say we’re entering a new dark age in the World of Progress, but it’s got to be pretty damn dark to match the Great Downturn.” Phylis ‘Redtooth’ Morley, Human Operative, SCL 7d, squad ‘Boss Man’s Wrath\n\n“Now, what we have here is a fire-arm from the third century, created by the rival company - Brutalic. You may all know New Paris for its pretty dresses and luxury cheeses, but back then this is the sort of product you’d expect to see emerging from that world. I see a few wry smiles in the class and yes indeed, this weapon does in fact have three barrels. It’s also hard to miss the underslung chainsaw; as if it weren’t scary enough. How many of you would be comfortable taking this weapon into Lower Downtown? Show of hands, please. Hmm, yes, I’m not surprised! This is a gun that’s most likely to blow up in your hands in record time, but you have to consider the minds of the creators and the agents eager to use this weapon. They knew full well all the risks of overheating and they used them anyway. They welcomed the risk, welcomed the carnage. Once this weapon began spitting rounds someone was going to be killed or maimed and it’s a coin toss whether that be the target or the gun owner. And so begins your education on the extreme ideology of Brutalic.” Rael Virrin, Wraithen Operative/ Tutor, Meny Training Facility\n\nBrutalic A new Oppressor Power had grown in the World of Progress - a company and ideology known as Brutalic. The company’s beliefs were born out of the violence and bloodshed endured over the 300 years of rule under SLA Industries. They differed from DarkNight because they were not driven to right wrongs, merely embrace the dominant culture - brutality. Brutalic drew in employees who craved ceaseless savagery. It was more than the creation of horrific weaponry, murder movies and combat drugs; it was treated as a religious practise. The belief was to throw oneself into harm and to generate harm. Brutalic would attack any outside force, be it SLA, or DarkNight or anyone that appeared to challenge their near cult-like approach to business and warfare. “Brutalic is mostly forgotten in our historic documentations and their period of activity is commonly overshadowed by the exploits of DarkNight and Thresher. But Brutalic was a powerful adversary of SLA back in the 300s and only a handful of scholars are able to describe the rival company’s philosophy in any clear fashion. They made what some call snuff films, built weapons focused more on damage over accuracy and creating the most extreme spectacles of gore on the city streets. They were a precursor to the Horrors recently deployed in Cannibal Sector 1, the Contract Circuit’s Gore Zone and possibly even the Shi’An Cult, well, on Mort at least. I suppose\n\nSalvation Tower Central Outskirts on Mort had always been a vast region beset with unemployment, subversion and crime. The city planners chose to construct an enormous social services building in the Outskirts that would work tirelessly to improve the lives of those inhabiting these slums during the Great Downturn. The building was called Salvation Tower and it took 6 years to\n\n17\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES complete. It was the great hope of all civilians living in Central Outskirts, but almost as soon as work was completed on Mort’s second largest building, it fell, causing one of the greatest catastrophes in SLA’s history. The disaster took place on 12th November, 300sd and whilst ‘The Fall of Salvation Tower’ suggests the building toppled over completely, it simply sank several building stories into the ground beneath it, destroying many of the surrounding buildings and the substations which powered the region. The result was a power blackout across the entirety of Central Outskirts. This was not merely a temporary obstruction but a shut down from which the region would never recover. The event was called the Big Black. Once the Big Black lurched into being, what followed was city wide panic and rioting, as the frightened citizens of the crumbling Outskirts fled toward the safety of Mort City, but were forced back into the chaos. A young SLA Operative in training - Sandi Helen Piper, was so disgusted by the refusal and neglect of responsibilities by SLA that she immediately turned traitor and led a concerted attack against the makeshift wall defences SLA had thrown up to safeguard itself. SLA Industries realised Piper and her supporters posed a substantial threat so they switched from defensive position to offensive, unleashing an entirely new terror into the mounting conflict.\n\nDigger’s Toll A legion of robots were deployed at the defence wall to patrol the perimeter and eliminate potential threats and incursions posed by Piper and her allies. The robotic creations displayed bizarre behaviour from the very beginning of their deployment; they had a nasty habit of removing the skin and flesh of their opponents and applying it to their own metal frames. A ‘Manchine’ arrived on the defensive line in November that was unlike anything the Shivers had seen before. Initially it was known as ‘AGF-14’ - Anthropomorphic Giga-Frame 14, a Manchine that stood 20 feet tall and weighed in at around one tonne. It had been deployed by SLA Industries for the express purpose of hunting down and destroying the leader of the Central Outskirt rebels - Sandi Helen Piper. AGF-14 functioned very differently from other Manchines and most Shivers were terrified of it; the robot seemed to have a mind of its own, a mind that was vicious and feral. Its name changed swiftly. Because of its weight, the Manchine would frequently sink through the surface of city streets and stalk its way around the sewer system, only to burst back up through the cement and ambush its prey - from then on it was simply known as Digger. Digger tracked Piper down within a twenty-four-hour period but did not kill her as it was programmed. It did proceed to shadow her for a month, systematically starving her and denying her shelter or sustained rest. It also murdered anyone that may have come to her aid; she faced her inescapable death, alone. Sandi Piper disappeared from the gaze of SLA Industries, but so too did their prized Manchine. Digger effectively completed the mission (but nobody knew for sure the exact manner of her death) then went rogue and journeyed deeper into the dead city, taking up residence and ultimately ruling over what remained of the crumbling Salvation Tower.Digger has been recognised as one of SLA’s greatest enemies ever since.\n\nThe Sector Wall\n\nIt was acknowledged, within days of the The Fall, that Central Outskirts would never recover from its catastrophe and what began as a makeshift defence would mark the beginning of a fortified wall which would encircle the entirety of Mort City. It was the birth of what became the Sector Wall - an enormous structure whose boundary runs for 352km and took 47 years to complete. Most Shivers in the present day contest this number, citing that it has never fully been completed, as it is always undergoing repair and modifications to bolster its defences. Since its conception the Sector Wall has been policed by Shivers, with generation after generation of recruits devoting their whole careers and in many cases their lives, to surveying Cannibal Sector 1 and protecting Mort City from monsters lurking outside.\n\nDawn of the Cannibal\n\nBy 345sd studies of Central Outskirts concluded that the ruins were now completely devoid of human civilisation; what now was scratching out a living in the remains were utterly savage and bereft of their former propriety. The once-people had now taken to eating each other in order to survive. They were now simply to be classed as exactly what they’d become:\n\n18\n\nH ISTORY Cannibals, with the Central Outskirts becoming known as the cannibal sectors.\n\nSome SLA historians class this as the definitive period of the never ending corporate war within the universe.\n\nLower Downtown Begins\n\n“It’s true, DarkNight, Brutalic and Thresher existed long before the Consolidation Era, but I’d still class this as the true Corporate Wars. Other historians prefer the term the 2nd Corporate Wars; but this is all conjecture. The important aspect of this era is the birth of the micro companies, or as we now call them the Soft Companies. Tiny competing brands that did not challenge the might of SLA directly, but quietly attempted to undermine soda brands, adhesive tape manufacture and dental care products. They came at SLA with second rate produce, but were to defend it with first rate aggression.” Angela Maybridge, Historian, Threat Analysis\n\nSLA believed that simply creating Downtown as a quick replacement for Central Outskirts would solve its civilian population issues, but by 353sd it was clear that intense overcrowding was causing an increase in crime, disease and a limited work infrastructure that meant 78% of the people living in Downtown faced lifelong unemployment. The Great Downturn would seemingly never end. Something had to be done. Early in 354sd, SLA Industries journeyed to the depths of Downtown and began to dig. It intended to create a whole new series of habitation levels and force the populace to embrace these tightly confined subterranean tunnels and domiciles.\n\nSLA also redesigned their company structure, grouping the entire business into various departments. The employees at Head Office would gradually find themselves belonging to a new specific Department, or in the case of Operatives they would receive their missions, now referred to as BPN Files which would be issued by the newly drafted Departments.\n\n“Fuck that; no way am I going into Lower Downtown. I don’t care what the letter says or threats SLA makes. That place gives me the bloody creeps and we’re already hearing horror stories about what’s going on down there… Seriously, I think I’d rather take my chances in the cannibal sectors than go to the slums of Lower Downtown.” Arthur Lynne, (45), Civilian (Unemployed)\n\n“BPNs are just one of these phrases that is universally used, but rarely questioned. The Blueprint News files first went into circulation on 3rd October 304sd and they weren’t an actual ‘blueprint’, y’know, like a design, yeah? They were originally printed on light blue paper and with a dark blue ink, specific to the machines that created them at the time. And as for News, well, that’s a weird one. It seems that by using the term ‘news’ the designated mission felt like a suggestion, rather than a direct order. Like, “did you hear the news, maybe you should investigate?” The high ups thought the Operatives would rebel if they were told what to do, so they gave ‘em the kid gloves? They had to be coaxed into working! Just a polite word for do what you’re told - news. Crazy, isn’t it? A different time… Anyway, the words and the colours stuck, but today we’re under no illusions about the orders we’re given.” Visage, Ebon Operative, SCL6d, squad Dusty Lavender\n\nPeople were quite literally bullied into Lower Downtown and it wasn’t just the civilians who were taking up residence in the region; Carrien, Mort Rats and serial killers began stalking the concrete warrens. The Shiver Units deployed to Lower Downtown were at half the capacity of those patrolling the higher levels and after a time the Shivers actively avoided the depths and just left the civilians abandoned there to their own devices. It was the doom of desperate thousands.\n\nCONSOLIDATION PERIOD - 400-500SD\n\nIn the fifth century, SLA Industries began to reevaluate their company, their corporate structure and the varying subsidiaries manufacturing products for them. Administration felt the infrastructure had become too sprawling and unmanageable, so in 400sd the Consolidation Era began and whilst the majority of changes took place within the first decade, the consolidation process would continue until the beginning of 500sd. Many of the minor subsidiaries creating biogenetic goods were brought under the banner of Karma, effectively making this singular division in charge of all aspects of biogenetic creations, from the Stormer projects to the clothes worn and the food that was consumed in the World of Progress. Karma’s influence would span across countless worlds, but it would always bear the same logo and the same style of management whether it be on New Paris or on a random backwater Resource World. The same brutal approach was implemented across all forms of manufacture with only major companies running specific forms of production. The stockholders in firms like FEN, Power Projects and BLA became exceedingly wealthy once more, harkening back to the Boom Time of the 200sd. Some companies wished to keep their identity and tore free from SLA rule. SLA in turn deemed them ‘Soft Companies’ and classed them as subversives; enemies of the World of Progress.\n\nThe Sector Rangers 100 years after the cannibal sectors came into existence, SLA Industries recognised the rapid evolution of the Cannibals and Carrien and felt it necessary to devise and conduct research patrols of the city ruins. The end result was the Sector Rangers, who would grow to be among the best trained and most efficient Operatives SLA Industries has ever created. The Sector Rangers were founded in 407sd and the first recruits ventured into the dead city just one year later. Not everyone entering Meny was capable of becoming a Sector Ranger, nor would most want to be, especially as word spread of the Rangers’ gruelling training regime and the equally miserable six month long tours of the cannibal sectors. “I hear ya, the Sector Rangers are as tough as they come and you’d think everyone in SLA would want to be one, right? I heard that it’s something like 1 in 500 that gets selected for the Fenswick Program, but I mean, look at these guys. They’re\n\n19\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES bloody dead inside. I’ve seen more sentience out of a Low Wave Stormer than those ghouls. The Sector Wall Shivers created the term ‘Stone Eyes’ for the Rangers. These guys don’t just patrol the Cannibal Sector, they become a part of it.” Anders ‘Screwhead’ Palmer, Human Operative, SCL 9a, squad ‘The Sparkly Cats’\n\nallow SLA to essentially take over the running of your world, or refuse and accept the potential ramifications. Third Eye News airs ‘Progress Control’ - an hourly news channel covering universal politics, current affairs and interplanetary statuses. There, new worlds under offer are heavily publicised. The citizens of the World of Progress watch the news, every hour on the hour and so too does SLA’s corporate rivals. By showcasing a vulnerable planet on Progress Control it is announcing to the World of Progress that it is defenceless and ripe for the taking. DarkNight, Thresher and shoals of aggressive Soft Companies are always angling to conquer and convert a new society to their cause, force their product range upon them. SLA is fully aware of this and will utilise the looming threat of imminent invasion: if the planet’s governments do not acquiesce to SLA’s demands, they will exit and abandon them to certain attack by any number of rivals, who will likely be even more savage in their negotiations than SLA. Almost all planets and star systems in the World of Progress were snared and defeated by SLA in such a manner. Some planets tried to retaliate against SLA, but considering the company could deftly defeat so many powerful enemies during the Conflict Era, such resistance is most likely futile. Many planets simply roll over and let SLA monopolise them. Thousands of worlds gradually let go over the centuries and took to producing whatever the company told them. SLA would protect them, but not from poor decision making.\n\nFrom the moment the Sector Rangers were introduced to the Operative ranks, SLA recognised their value and the breadth of their capabilities. For the first hunderd years after the cannibal sectors were formed a great deal of even Cannibal Sector 1 had not been traversed nor catalogued. The Rangers resolved that. Quickly it became clear that the Sector Rangers could travel only so far into the first sector. A finate amount of supplies could be carried in a Battle Taxi and their training, especially on how to survive off of the sectors, had proved wanting. The Rangers couldn’t get far beyond the NorthWest Compact. SLA Industries essentially went back to the drawing board with the Sector Ranger Program and in 421sd, a state of the art simulator and training centre was opened in Viddrie. Old and new recruits were educated, and put through their paces, in an artificial environment based on the Sector knowledge gathered over the prior fourteen years.\n\nThe 3Ps Contract\n\nOffworld reports were returning to SLA with news that many of its Resource Worlds were coming under constant attack from rival companies. Before taking more extreme measures, the company sent undercover spies to these planets and conducted investigations into the growing subversion. In many cases it was corrupt officials who had entered into clandestine trading with DarkNight. It seemed that SLA Industries was starting to lose its grip on the World of Progress, so it opted to reinstate the 3Ps Contract in an effort to establish itself as the overruling body in the World of Progress. The 3Ps Contractual Agreement was entitled after the three pillars of SLA Industries ethos: Progress, Prospects and Prosperity. It’s issued to all newly discovered planets in the World of Progress and whilst progress, prospects and prosperity all sounds very encouraging, it is invariably anything but. 3Ps contracts led to totalitarian regime, horrendous Franchise Worlds and all manner of global abuses at the hands of SLA. It was and still is, a brutal, autocratic means of conquering worlds, but the 3Ps Contract also served to galvanise the modern-day World of Progress. The contract appears optimistic until the planet’s governments read through the plethora of stipulations within the contract and then witness first-hand what it means to fall beneath the control of SLA. Such worlds lose all identity and become merely an extension of SLA. Global continents no longer serve and aid each other; they become a collection of nations in name only which exist to serve the company in however it demands. They can always refuse, but the consequences of denial will be severe. SLA Industries does not invade worlds, although the 3Ps Contract effectively strong arms a new planet with clauses it cannot possibly accept. Nonetheless, the choice is theirs: either\n\n“When the Conflict Aliens fled I think everyone thought it was the dawning of a brighter future, but I think it was just more of the same. Maybe it was worse, because what we got instead was the worst fate imaginable; to live on and on after crushing defeat. I was a soldier in the Conflict Era and I thought it’d be the end of me. Now I’m seeing out my final years working 18 hour shifts stitching these zips into short pants. I’ll die face down in denim. Thank you, SLA.” Janice Scobie, (48) Factory Worker, Franchise World ‘Dig 4’\n\nTHE NEW WAVE - 500-599SD Expanding Range SLA Industries, ever intent on progress, looked to further advances in the development of armour, weaponry and new studies in fusion technology. For the next hundred years began what would later be known as ‘The New Wave’, with the World of Progress enjoying a wide scale manufacturing boom. The New Wave produced classic products which are still available in the present day: Crackshot and Dogeybone armour and time-honoured weapons like the KPS Mangler AS and the FEN 30-30 ‘True Shot’ Sniper Rifle. Elsewhere, it looked far more gloomy and towards the close of the highly productive century, darker days were to follow.\n\nAge of Nightmares\n\nAt the beginning of 582sd Cannibal Sector 1 was suddenly beset by two solid days of black rain. The majority of the denizens in the Sector took cover and waited for the strange\n\n20\n\nH ISTORY\n\ndeluge to subside, but those who were struck by the downpour were plagued by horrific visions unlike anything typically conjured by the region. By the end of the 48 hour period the black rains ceased and relative normality returned to the Sector. The Shiver stationed on the Wall believed it was simply the result of pollution in Mort’s skies, but in the months that followed a new form of horror settled in the ruins, marking the beginning of the Age of Nightmares. Shivers reports spoke of ‘living shadows’ which were flitting about the NorthWest Compact. These shades targeted all the species living in the Sector, ravaging their minds and tasting their fears. In time, the amorphous black shapes would materialise in physical forms, based on the accumulated horrors of the Cannibal Sectors. They were the first reported Dream Entities on Mort. In subsequent years these beings would evolve into ever more advanced and complex shapes and gradually slip through the Sector Walls and into the deep recesses of Mort City.\n\nThey had found strange, eccentric civilians already living in the occupancies that had been completed just moments before. Some workers even catalogued histrionic reports of sky views from certain windows; an impossibility in such subterranean depths. Mort City planners simply put this down to overworked staff suffering from exhaustion and hallucinations brought on by chemicals in the tunnel air. In time they would recalibrate the air ducts, but in the meantime civilians were quickly housed in the eerie, echoey apartment blocks of Lower Downtown.\n\nTHE CONSTRUCT - 600-699SD\n\nFifteen years after the completion of Lower Downtown, Shiver patrols had already dropped down to almost zero. The people in those recesses had begun to lose their humanity and were displaying peculiar behaviour. As if this weren’t alarming enough, the last Shiver reports sent back to SLA from the base level of the region claimed that there were indications that there were more civilian levels appearing beneath. The transit elevators now had numbers that descended to even deeper levels. Only one Shiver patrol ventured below base level and never returned. After that no Shiver team would enter the unexplored streets again. In 605sd, Tr’K V’rrTK, a well experienced and resourceful Shaktarian SLA Operative, agreed to explore the fabled levels and return with a detailed summary of findings.\n\nLower Downtown Complete\n\nBy late 590sd work had been completed on Lower Downtown. A further 12 civilian levels had been added but problems had begun to crop up even before the new citizens entered. A large number of the workforce had fallen ill and suffered from crippling anxiety during the long period of construction. Workers had encountered extreme feelings of claustrophobia and made claims of abnormal occurrences.\n\n21\n\nSLA INDUSTRIES Tr’K re-emerged on Inner Downtown base level three weeks later, dishevelled, armour battered and rambling incoherently. It took a further four weeks to obtain anything of value from his frenzied account - he claimed that it was full of impossible creatures that had constructed their own version of reality and that the place predated Lower Downtown. As far as he could tell, the levels descended indefinitely. SLA took very little stock in the Shaktar’s declarations, but resolved to dispatch some of its best Aethermen into the unknown levels.\n\nThis night went down in Mort City’s history as ‘The Six Seventeen Bloodbath’. Many compared it to the Big Black and the Fall of Salvation Tower, but in this instance, there was no incitement recorded; just the inevitable tipping point for the escalating problems in Lower Downtown. The crazies had no terms or demands of SLA. No motive. They’d just gone insane and the madness was contagious. Ops were sent in within a matter of hours and by then the mob had exceeded 200. They found the aftermath of a mass blood orgy, decapitated Shiver heads on iron poles and numerous apartment buildings burning out of control. It took a further 12 hours for the sanctioned SLA Ops to quell the disturbance, killing 150 civilians and forcing the survivors into the bottom two levels of Lower Downtown. SLA was forcibly locking the gates on the two deepest levels and then effectively washing its hands of the rest. It took just 27 years for Lower Downtown to go from ‘a vision of future prosperity’ to yet another ‘blight on the surface of Mort.’\n\n“Report to Catalogue Backlog, I cannot attest to the number of civilian levels descending into the infinite. But after 10 days of almost continual descent I had not reached the basin. I can only surmise that it goes down a good deal further. It is my opinion that this region has in essence created itself and to classify it as civilian domiciles would be highly inaccurate: it is merely a construct. It is my opinion that SLA Industries should quarantine this controversial region and cap information access. I’m not one to ignore potential threats but I’m at a loss as to what should be done. There are no people, not that I’m aware of and very few will ever venture this deep. It simply exists, but hasn’t taken a malevolent stance. Not yet anyway. Leave the Deep Construct be for now, but never, ever, forget that it exists down here.” Aetherman Montague, 6th Head\n\nThe Omaja\n\nIn 630sd the very first of the long forgotten Conflict Races returned to the World of Progress, but not as vengeful enemies; the Omaja were now refugees. They reappeared in their original Baal Star System, having fled decimation at the hands of the Root Dogs. SLA reluctantly welcomed them back, but forced them to serve within the labour force in the Baal mineral mines. Having suffered such terrible losses in Conflict Space, the Omaja took to this work without question and performed their arduous task diligently, yet as a species they were nonetheless plagued by bigotry and the constant threat of violence.\n\nChaos Reigns\n\n“I hate these little fuckers. I’ve lost three work shifts to the compliant little monkeys; all because they work double time and earn half pay. It’s a conspiracy I tell ya, them apes and the bosses; robbing honest humans of honest pay. I tried telling one of them Omajans to piss off back to Conflict Space where they belong and the shithead bit my hand! Look at it! This means more time off and it’s all their fucking fault!” Excavator ‘Chip’ Chester Miles, Whittler & Nash Mining Company, Project 7, Baal System – 631sd\n\nDowntown had always been an unruly and violent section of Mort society, but the mounting pressure of subterranean living and the influence of the Deep Construct beneath finally took its toll on Lower Downtown. It is safe to say things never quite settled in Lower Downtown; it was a region that was troubled from its inception. Countless civilians were thrust upon the recesses and were simply expected to adjust to the cramped, squalid apartments and perpetual gloom. As months turned into years, the Lower Downtowners grew more isolated, strange and eventually aggressive.\n\nHaving spent so much time in the mines, the Omaja earned the cruel nickname ‘Trenchers’ aand as a species that was always quick to temper, fights inevitably broke out. Once again the Omaja were forced out and pressured to work on the remote backwater worlds on the fringes of SLA owned space, where they have remained up until the The Changes in 900sd.\n\n“It’s bad down there. I mean, really bad. Not many Shiver Patrols drop to Level seven, the folks there will actively attack the APCs. But it’s worse than that… I guess the best way to describe them is just fucked in the brain. I was on a patrol on Level eight and I saw a guy stood out on the street butt naked except for one boot, munching on a dead, raw rat. Nobody’s batting an eyelid. That was Level eight, so I’m scared to think how bad it might have gotten on Level nine. As for Level eighteen. Fuck that!.” Shiver Patrolman Dillon, 616sd\n\nThe Shadow Decade\n\nBack in Cannibal Sector 1, the inhabitants on both sides of the Wall suffered the longest recorded period of heavy rain and storms in the region, stretching from 679sd to late 689sd. It was during this miserably protracted period that the Carrien and Cannibals endured devastating famine. Thousands died. The only species unaffected in the sectors were the Dream Entities, who simply thrived on the widespread terror and anguish. It was during the Shadow Decade that the earliest Dream Entity Masters materialised in the Sector and set about enslaving and moulding their own species.\n\nOn October 31st, 617sd things finally came to a head in Lower Downtown. Reports were coming through that a Shiver Patrol had been taken down by a ‘violent and extremely disturbed group of individuals’ numbering around 35. An hour later a Shiver Precinct was ransacked by over 60 individuals.\n\n22\n\nH ISTORY “I’ve read in our history books that these rains signify things to come. When the downpour rivals anything previously recorded and it intensifies, seemingly without end. Something will emerge again though, I have no doubt. Do not be scared now, the time to worry is when the rain eases and the horror finally shows its face.” Shiver Sgt. Godley, Sector Wall, 684sd\n\nMEDIA ERA - 700-799SD It was during the Media Era that the citizens of the World of Progress began to see the many faces of SLA with greater clarity. Through the lens of a television cathode ray tube they would witness the company’s greatest success, as heroic SLA Operatives struck down the agents of DarkNight, but they would also see for the first time the ruins of Cannibal Sectors in all their lurid glory. The viewers at home ate it up and loved every good and bad minute of it. Within hours, the Media Era had the unemployed masses in its thrall and its grasp never waivered.\n\nThe Children of Scarogg\n\nA frightening new species appeared in Cannibal Sector 1 that didn’t just threaten SLA Industries but every other opposing species eking out an existence in the ruins. They were known as the Scavs; great hulking monstrosities overladen in scrap armour and tattered trench coats, each with its face concealed behind a gas mask. Throughout the varying regions of the Cannibal Sector, the Scavs wheezed and killed and plundered. They proved to be not only deadly combatants, but also expert engineers and mechanics. Almost everything carried and wielded by the Scavs was by their own design. The terrible secret behind the mysterious Scavs is that they are yet another failed experiment by SLA Industries. In 706sd, Doctor Arild Scarogg was stationed in the No-Go Zone and charged with completing ‘The Vodyanoy Project’, in which he would create a force of super soldiers for SLA Industries. SLA suspected that Scarogg’s creations might rival the Stormers and at a fraction of the cost, but the development was highly controversial, as it was based on Shaktar DNA as its framework. By 708sd SLA Head Office had lost all contact with the Doctor and found no trace of the Vodyanoy in his secret compound. The horrid ‘Children of Scarogg’ would return several years later in the form of the Scavs, only this time rather than be in thrall of the company as had been the want, they would attack SLA directly.\n\nconcerned with studying their loyalty and what resources could be readdressed in these nations. SLA did not always have to venture off planet to use and abuse a potential revenue stream. In most cases, the research teams returned with promising findings, but typically the level of radiation still being emitted by the Fission Belt prevented much utilisation for a few more centuries. Further north there were, however, safer and lucrative opportunities, particularly in the country of Skend. The industries born out of Skend had made inroads into high end automotive development and manufacture, as well as several other decidedly specialised product lines, such as tweed, cigars and mineral water.\n\nEx-War Criminals\n\nAs highly sought after Skendish cars began appearing in Uptown, something far less pleasurable was also arriving in the Cannibal Sectors at the exact same time. Military veterans were returning from the War Worlds, they had fought insurmountable odds, secured innumerable victories for SLA Industries and finally earned their homecoming. There was no fanfare, nor reward for their honourable service to the company. SLA did make a tragic error in allowing these soldiers to retain their military grade weaponry and armour as a meagre way of saying thanks. Unable to adjust to Mort City and the fast paced consumer lifestyle so encouraged by SLA, these decorated military personnel descended into the depths of Downtown and the Cannibal Sector ruins to start the war anew. Their troubled minds seeing enemies in the denizens of their new homes. They were no longer the celebrated heroes of the World of Progress, they were now traitors and subversives\n\nMort Expands\n\nSLA had opted to keep much of its exploration a secret. They did not want to encourage a wave of intrepid explorers journeying out into the uncharted provinces of Mort unless they were in charge. There had always been other continents and other city-states, but their function and service to SLA was far narrower. They were much less populated or significant than the thriving capital city of Mort. Research teams were covertly sent out to analyse and document the largely forgotten continents of planet Mort. These research teams claimed to the foreign authorities they were merely performing radiation and health level c"
