Stoker & McAuley LLC has set out last year to re-energise the Stoker Dracula IP and show the world the true, authentic depiction of what Bram, the creator of Dracula, had intended for his universe of horror through various modern interactive media.\n\nThe StokerVerse RPG will be launched on Kickstarter in 2022. Over the coming months, the writing and art teams at both Nightfall Games and Stoker & McAuley will be working closely together to bring this brilliant IP to the roleplaying table in the form of a 240 page tome. The game will feature Nightfall Games' S5S system (also seen in SLA Industries and The Terminator RPG) tailored specifically for the game and its nature. The book will be another example of Nightfall Games' core values of Quality Writing, Quality Art and Quality Production Values.\n\nBut before the Kickstarter, the free to download (from DrivethruRPG) Quickstart, Dracula's Revenge will be released. This will be the direct sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula novel.\n\nMore at the link.\n\nI've never heard it referred to as the 'StokerVerse' before this. It makes me think of the aborted Universal monster universe they tried to bring to the cinema.\n\n3rik\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMay 13, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n4,907\n\nReaction score\n\n9,734\n\nJul 17, 2021\n\n#2\n\nI wonder what else is in the StokerVerse, besides Dracula.

And I love this review quote from the Wiki page on Dacre Stoker \"\"tempting enough to read and bad enough to be controversial, striking a balance between sensationalism and mediocrity\".

Clearly, not reading the OP. At no point until your post was Apocathulhu mentioned, because it simply wasn't relevant. A simple scan of the OP would have indicated that it was about Nightfall Games producing an RPG base don Bram Stoker's writings. But, you wade in with a pompous \"Nightfall if you recall was detailed in Apocathulhu\".

Dacre Stoker's works certainly seem to have more than a tinge of steampunk, which - given his involvement in the licence - might well bleed into the entire 'Stokerverse' thing.\n\nTristramEvans\n\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n\nJoined\n\nApr 24, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n37,875\n\nReaction score\n\n114,239\n\nJul 20, 2021\n\n#28\n\nIncidentally, when I was a teenager I began writing a sequel to Dracula - I think I got about 6 chapters in.

I think there might be multiple genres invovled, but didn't have the interest or patience to dig through the site further.\n\nRogerdee\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nNov 24, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n640\n\nReaction score\n\n838\n\nJul 21, 2021\n\n#30\n\nMisreading? Clearly, not reading the OP. At no point until your post was Apocathulhu mentioned, because it simply wasn't relevant. A simple scan of the OP would have indicated that it was about Nightfall Games producing an RPG base don Bram Stoker's writings. But, you wade in with a pompous \"Nightfall if you recall was detailed in Apocathulhu\". Read the damn OP.\n\nI mis-read the OP, and on the grounds it 30 degrees on Sunday that is understandable.\n\nThere is simply no need for your post, none whatsoever.\n\nLast edited: Jul 21, 2021\n\n3rik\n\nLegendary Pubber\n\nJoined\n\nMay 13, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n4,907\n\nReaction score\n\n9,734\n\nJul 21, 2021\n\n#31\n\nIncidentally, when I was a teenager I began writing a sequel to Dracula - I think I got about 6 chapters in.

His brides could not however, as far as I remember.

It sounds like something potentially worth checking out.\n\nCan anyone here tell me anything about this S5S system?\n\nLair of the White Worm, but it's um... all I'm going to say is that doing Dracula as a diary really helped cover up some of the flaws in Stoker's writing style."
