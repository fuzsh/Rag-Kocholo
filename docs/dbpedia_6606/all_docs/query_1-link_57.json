But that's not all. If combat is not your thing, SLA Industries gives you many other avenues to explore this dark world where SLA tells you only what you need to know and hides its secrets jealously. How much can you find out? How much are you willing to pay?\n\nLong live SLA. You, however, may not live long at all."
