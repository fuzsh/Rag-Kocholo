        "text": "We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.\n\nThe exception is on any preordered items, or sealed TCG product which are not refundable or returnable. Due to the way we purchase preorders immediately from our distribution, we cannot accept returns, exchanges, or process refunds on presale items, sale items, or gift cards without applying a 25% fee to recoup cost associated via payment providers and our platform.\n\nPre-order cancellations will be subject to a 25% fee and handled on a case by case basis.\n\nShipping Policy\n\nAll orders are subject to begin shipping between 7-10 business days of their official release date. This applies especially to preorders, but not excluding other purchases. Although we work very hard to ship out all orders as quickly as possible, we are a small shipping operation and we ship out orders in the order they were purchased. When we ship out preorders, that means a large quantity of orders we must ship out, which takes more than one day. We provide some of the best pricing available on the market to accommodate for potential undesired shipping time. Thank you for understanding your order will ship out in 7-10 business days.\n\nTo be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.\n\nTo start a return, you can contact us at store@gamegridslc.com. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.\n\nYou can always contact us for any return question at store@gamegridslc.com.\n\nDamages and issues\n\nPlease inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and assist in the damage claim process if desired. All orders are insured for up to 200$. If you desire or require additional insurance reach out to us via email and we can invoice you for the preferred amount. We are not liable for damages incurred via the carrier.\n\nExceptions / non-returnable items\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot accept returns, exchanges, or process refunds on presale items, sale items, or gift cards.\n\nExchanges\n\nThe fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item."
