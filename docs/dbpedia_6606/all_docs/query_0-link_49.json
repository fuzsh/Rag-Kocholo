        "text": "NOTE: This is the Retail Exclusive version of the book, featuring a different cover. There were 500 copies of this version made and there WILL NOT be any reprints..\n\nSLA Industries (pronounced \"Slay Industries\") is a 226 page pen-and-paper role-playing game that was first published in Scotland in 1993. The game is a horror noir science-fiction setting set in a dystopian reality in which the majority of the known universe is either owned or indirectly controlled by the eponymous corporation SLA Industries. The game incorporates themes from the cyberpunk, gothic horror and conspiracy genres, and has always been praised on the quality of writing and art. The World of Progress, the universe in which SLA Industries operates, is a science-fiction image of the 1980s, where the fax machine spews out information alongside green-screen computers and vat-grown biogenetic monsters, who compete with humans and exotic alien races for work in an overgrown city that plunges deep underground.\n\nSLA Industries 2nd Edition features an entirely new d10-based rules system\n\nFull colour tome, with all new full colour art mainly by Dave Allsop (MtG, Pathfinder, D&D, Heathstone, GW etc.)\n\nPlayers in SLA Industries take on the role of an Operative, the highly-trained and well-equipped freelancers that serve as the company's agents, investigators and enforcers. Operatives perform tasks for both a pay packet and the promise of an increase in their security clearance, as both provide them access to an increased standard of living, better equipment, progression up the corporate ladder and sponsorship opportunities. Most of all though, they strive for the one thing that everyone in the media-driven World of Progress wants: Notoriety.\n\nIntroduction: Beginning with a terminology for the World of Progress, the Introduction also covers those aligned against SLA Industries before covering what roleplaying games are, a brief history of SLA Industries (the TTRPG, not the corporation), before summarizing how to play the game and what is needed for it.\n\nHistory: Twenty-one pages of highly detailed history, from before before SLA Industries created the World of Progress up through 915 years of history. The history is broken out by century, followed by important events that occurred during each one.\n\nThe World of Progress: This chapter details the setting, beginning with the Planet Mort before drilling down more and more, before ending up at Mort City. Each neighborhood in the city is covered, along with points of interest and getting around on in the city. After that, the chapter covers the World of Progess itself, which is a catchall term for all SLA controlled space: seven different types of worlds are described, as well as what lies beyond SLA Industries' borders and space travel. A handful of specific worlds round out the chapter.\n\nOperative Hours: All about playing a SLA Operative. From how they're recruited, where they tend to live, to Blueprint New Files \"BPNs,\" which are jobs for Operatives to take to earn a living as a successful freelancer. SLA Industries itself is detailed within this chapter, breaking out and describing various departments and their individual responsibilities. This chapter, combing with the preceding two, provide all the necessary background information needed for a player to immerse themselves in the World of Progress.\n\nCharacter Creation: Walks Players through character creation, beginning with selecting one of the nine playable species before assigning points on stats. Skills and traits follow, with movement and finally equipment brining up the rear.\n\nRules and Mechanics: Introduces Nightfall Games' S5S rules system and quicklu gets down to business with the different types of rolls needed in the game. Combat follows and as that section ends with rules on damage, it only makes sense that health and healng follows. Improving one's Operative comes next, followed by several other sections to fully round out the game mechanics.\n\nThe Ebb: This chapter provides information on a form of energy that underpins the world of SLA Industries. Understood only by the Ebonites and a few ancient species, the chapter begins with what the Ebb is and how it is used, before providing the rules of using it in game. The various \"disciplines\" that users of the Ebb specialize in finish the chapter.\n\nHardware: Melee Weapons. Ranged Weapons. Things that go Boom! Hardware consists of over 30 pages detailing the weapons, armor, vehicles, and equipment in general.\n\nThreat Analysis: Formed in 905sd, the Threat Analysis department identifies and disseminates information on any and all threats. The chapter begins with known threats, before veering off to discuss those that are more dangerous and/or subtle. The histories of many of the World of Progress enemies are provided here, as well as stat blocks and special equipment and how each group/villain operates.\n\nThe Web of Lies: Detailing the various methods used by SLA Industries to communicate with their Operatives, from BPNs to Hunter Sheets, this chapter covers how to run a game in the World of Progress. Creating NPCs, awarding (and spending) experience points, and what to do when not on a gig is also covered."
