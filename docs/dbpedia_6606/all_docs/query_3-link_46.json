        "text": "Nightfall had one final game themed around it, which was Night Shift, a playable teaser for BtD: 2. As of today, the game has since closed after BtD: 2 was released. The game itself was a remake of the first Nightfall game, being mainly story-based and action themed. John was still the main character, and it had the player to venture around the destroyed Nightfall town while hiding from Subject-0011, then make it through the sewers, then finally go through a facility to complete the game.\n\nThere were many collectibles that could be found throughout the game, and after collecting a set number of collectibles the player would then be rewarded with different phases of the Subject-0011 Slasher skin, but this depends on how many the player has collected. There was also a true ending in the game, and if completed, the player would be rewarded with the Nightfall Slasher class for BtD: 2.\n\nWhen BtD: 2 launched, players who got collectibles and players who completed the true ending got their rewards. However, the Nightfall map and others were removed.\n\nBtD: 2 Testing Servers[]\n\nWhen the BtD: 2 testing servers were first opened, Nightfall or Subject-0011 was a playable skin for the survivors team, along as a slasher which was split into multiple phases 1-4. These were obtainable through the Night Shift game.\n\nThe map of the Nightfall game was also present in the testing servers, which was remade, however, it still kept the main layout of the base game but more destroyed. After BtD: 2 was released, the map was removed.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nNightfall's Wares[]\n\nIn Nightfall's Wares, he is posed as a shopkeeper, who says something after the player enters, leaves and purchases something, however, the sound's definition is unknown.\n\nSounds[]\n\nhttps://survivethenight.fandom.com/wiki/File:Nightfallswares.oggEntering Nightfall's Wares\n\nhttps://survivethenight.fandom.com/wiki/File:Nightfallswares2.oggLeaving Nightfall's Wares\n\nhttps://survivethenight.fandom.com/wiki/File:Evenstore3.oggPurchasing any item in Nightfall's Wares\n\nHe can also be spotted in the lobby, where the background of the Nightfall's Wares is located. You can get there by going to the 2nd floor and into the attic, however, he only appears there if Nightfall's Wares is present in the store. You can't talk to him directly there. Bunch of crates can be seen scattered around the attic, alongside the ??? Lamp, which is hung to a crate.\n\nTrailers[]\n\nIn the v2.0.0 trailer, he's featured in it.\n\nIn-game Rounds[]\n\nApart from being a slasher and a shopkeeper, you can also spot him during the game. To spot him, you have to open an Event Case that can be found in maps. If opened so, you can see a radio clip of him, where he just stares at you for some seconds.\n\nSounds[]\n\nhttps://survivethenight.fandom.com/wiki/File:Eventcase.oggOpening the Event Case\n\nStory Mode[]\n\nAs of now, he isn't mentioned by any of the protagonists in Story Mode, however, he can be seen during Introduction.\n\nLogos, Images[]\n\nTrivia[]"
