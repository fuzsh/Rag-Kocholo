        "text": "I loved playing this game growing up and have been trying to play it on shockwave players for the last 8 years or so. I am ecstatic about the prospect of there being a sequel to the game that got me hooked on turn-based strategy. However, I can't, in good conscience, buy this without evidence that there's a sequel in the works. There have been many bug comments, but no edits made for the last three years, so I'm wary. If you could give me some kind of kind of reassurance that there's definitely more to come, I'll purchase it the minute I get the notification.\n\nI made a patch that lets you grind credits from nodes. You can download it here.\n\nThe way that the game currently works is that, once you've collected a [c] credit square, the game remembers this and won't let you collect credits from it ever again. My patch makes it so that you can collect credit squares over and over - as many times as you want. This way you can grind for credits by playing the same node over and over again, which IMO is a necessary and important mechanic to have in this game. (IIRC the original game had this mechanic.)\n\nr_tsang's solution is clever, and it helped me a lot in reverse-engineering the game's code, but it's a little inconvenient: You have to manually run the code and then refresh the page every time you want to farm a node. My solution should work seamlessly: As if the game had been designed this way from the start.\n\nI've 100%-ed the game with this patch and never ran into any issues, but please let me know if you run into anything, and I'll see if I can fix it.\n\nI'm on Windows/Chrome. No notable brugs or \"level clearance\" softlocks. I've also noticed no typos (or \"typo's\" as the accuser below ironically spelled it), and I consider myself apt at spotting them.\n\nHOWEVER, as someone mentioned, you can't grind credits by repeating levels. Unless you cheat by looking up tutorial videos the whole time you play this game to know exactly what to buy at any given moment, it's virtually impossible to progress.\n\nI'm currently stuck/virtually soft-locked with a party that I can't progress with. I can't experiment with new party combinations because I don't have the credits to buy new party members.\n\nI'm going to try r_tsang's scripts to recollect credits from repeat battles.\n\nEDIT: r_tsang's script to enable grinding the extra credits in repeat levels seems to work great\n\nAfter purchasing the game, my first save file got softlocked at level 3 clearance, as I wasn't able to obtain level 4 clearance despite the mission being completed. My second save file got softlocked at level 2 clearance, as after unlocking level 3 clearance, I was unable to unlock any level 3 clearance quests despite finishing all of the level 2 clearance quests. In addition, many battles get softlocked (and must be aborted) in the middle when I click during enemy turns. I'm a Mac using Chrome if that helps the dev debug.\n\nWhile the reproduction really is faithful graphically and playing it brings back memories, the fact that I can't seem to get to level 4 clearance due to bugs on both of my playthroughs means I can't in good conscience recommend buying this game.\n\nI've just completed the full game, and I gotta say... it brings back memories. I remember the original: at the spot where it says 'connection log' in the remake during the databattle screen, in the original instead it displays the player's chosen spybot.\n\nAnyway, I do have a question and suggestion: In the original, I recall that I was able to replay cleared nodes to gather even more 'credits' to purchase databattle software, but in the remake each node's credits can only be acquired once. I understand this is to give it some difficulty, but why not employ both methods and allow the players to choose between 'original' difficulty, which allows players to replay nodes to acquire more credits and software, and 'Hard' difficulty, which each node's victory and item credits can only be acquired once only, which forces the player to choose wisely which software to purchase depending on their strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, I also noticed some typos in the game's character chat text. I think that needs some reviewing too.\n\nHi! Bought and am enjoying the game greatly, but there's a bug: Bonus credits picked up during a level aren't added to your balance afterwards.\n\nEdit: Actually it's pretty bad. I was kind of reliant on repeating levels to farm credits so I could try out all the programs and now I don't know what to do with myself\n\nYou've taken a different approach from me. While it's good to reinvent things sometimes, I like that this version has the same music, UI and feel as the original game, and that I can play it on a modern browser. Out of interest, have you had, or do you expect, any legal trouble from Lego?"
