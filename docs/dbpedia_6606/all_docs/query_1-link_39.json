The game is set in a dystopian far-flung future in which the majority of the known universe is either owned or indirectly controlled by the eponymous corporation \"SLA Industries\" and incorporates themes from the cyberpunk, horror, and conspiracy genres.\n\nThe game combined concepts inspired by a range of aesthetics and ideas. Elements include: song lyrics from David Bowie and the Industrial music scene, cyberpunk fiction (including Blade Runner and Max Headroom), anime / manga (including Akira, Appleseed, Bubblegum Crisis, and Trigun), and the growing cultural obsession with the media (including 24-hour news services and the Gladiator TV Show).\n\nWhere we deliver.\n\nWe deliver Worldwide using a range of couriers and services.
