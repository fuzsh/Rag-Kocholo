        "text": "Second half of post 5\n\nposted by Traveller Original SA post\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe best zones in Downtown are the closest to the Perimeters. The three largest gangs (Krosstown Traffic, the Kiestas and the Johannas) hang around here, and they're a good source of information for operatives that grease their palms. Pushing them too much is not advisable, as they have many members and the Johannas in particular are ruthless enough to behead arrogant Slops.\n\nCults and street religions are popular in the lower levels. Many times, their objects of worship are Downtown serial killers and mutant abominations. Sometimes, their prayers are answered, and things stir in the lower levels. Many of the cults are SLA-hating communities, too.\n\nHalloween Jack, one of the signature characters, and an important figure in the metaplot - but he's not touched beyond a namedrop in the corebook. And the cover image, of course.\n\nDowntown is labyrinthine and it's really easy to get lost, as there are no maps and the place has been built over time and again. Only DarkNight mercenaries really know where they're going. DarkNight loves to use Downtown to strike at SLA from the shadows, particularly by using Soft Companies (half gang, half indie corp) to sell to Downtown civilians weapons, drugs and other stuff through the black market that SLA would never give them.\n\nEven the skin trade (slavery) is available if you have enough money in Downtown: Beckon Street, Mort's own red light district, is stacked with pimps, prostitutes, stripper bars and nightclubs. Young Downtown girls and boys disappear here all the time. But since this is not Cthulhutech, the game leaves it here, with a mention that the three major gangs want to put an end to the skin trade, whatever the Shiver Units may say. Slavery will not be tolerated.\n\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR\n\nAnother 'interesting' location is Rust Alley. See, there was a short-lived fad of cybernetics in Mort, with people replacing full limbs for 'chrome' equivalents. But these enhancements drained the patient's humanity, and their power cells only lasted for a decade. Now, they lurk in Rust Alley, a hideaway for powerless cyber-tramps, hiding their non-functioning limbs and eyes with rags. Why? Because FUCK YOU MIKE PONDSMITH THAT'S WHY.\n\nBeyond Downtown there are the Cannibal Sectors. They're inhabited by mutants and worse, feeding on human flesh to survive. The most notorious of the Cannibal Sectors is Cannibal Sector One, where the remains of Salvation Tower are located.\n\nCommon creatures here are Carriens, vaguely intelligent creatures of unknown origin, ferocious and animalistic; Manchines, flesh-wearing cybernetic war machines that would've been used by SLA as a backup to Stormers in War Worlds, abandoned in the Cannibal Sectors when it was clear that their programming was irrecoverably malfunctioning; and pigs.\n\nGIANT MUTANT FUCKOFF PIGS.\n\nFiction! And unrelated to the continuing piece of fiction because of REASONS. A Shiver sergeant debriefs a hoverbike pilot that had been flying into the Cannibal Sectors for whatever reason. The pilot had been approached by Sour Blood, a Contract Killer, who ordered her to run some recon for him - even bribed her to secure the deal, but she had the idea that he wouldn't take too kindly to a 'no'. He wanted her to take her somewhere in Cannibal Sector Two, and see if she could spot a Manchine: Digger, the most famous and deadly Manchine. She takes to the coordinates, which happen to be an eerily quiet place. Also right next to Salvation Tower because the fiction gives no fucks. The tower stank to high hell, and she suddenly spotted body parts in the floors of the tower - entire floors dedicated to a single bit, like Ebon eyes. The pilot vomited, then noticed that Digger had noticed her. As she got the fuck out of there, the Contract Killer gave her the money and jumped off the bike. The whole conversation is cut short by Cloak Division agents that terminate both Shivers.\n\nThen there's a classification of serial killers that is boring so I'll skip it. Only worthwhile bit is the mention of Cognates, serial killer gangs. I don't know how those work, but whatever. DarkNight is mentioned as one of the main causes of the rise in insane killer madmen, due to their distribution of the DNA-altering combat drug known as Shatter. SLA is to blame as well, with their media glorifying the killers and their hunt by SLA operatives - shit, they even get killers their own franchise deals. They don't pay them a dime, of course, but they can sell kids masks of the latest famous killer, complete with plastic cleavers.\n\nLiving costs! An average employee makes about 200 UNI a week, which is enough for a cheap mortgage, a spouse, 2.4 children and a commuter motorcycle. Better than the dole, though - just 40 UNI and housing payments if applicable. With the media pumping lifestyles they can't afford and making them feel they deserve them, it's no wonder many civvies turn to crime and the black market. Fire services are the province of special Fire Shiver units: fires can destroy valuable infrastructure, and as such Fire Shivers are specially empowered to stop fires at any cost, civilian casualties included. Medical services aren't as aggressive, but only SLA operatives and employees get the better assistance. At least the civilian service is free.\n\nTravel is usually handled by subway, bus or a motorcycle. There are also blue taxis for the wealthier, but normally only SLA operatives will be driving their own cars - there is a massive road tax only they are exempt from. Subways are dangerous since the Fall of 300 SD. Buses are slower, but at least you'll make it to your destination in one piece. Motorcycles are the most common form of private transport, as well as the Keshang, a personal powersuit (with attending hotrod culture). Long distance travel is covered by high-speed mag trains that break the sound barrier regularly, while off-world travel is handled by SLA Industries' Foldships. Air travel is almost non-existent, reserved for corporate purposes.\n\nI can't let Bullet Tax go unmentioned. See, bullets are expensive beyond normal levels of taxation. SLA operatives complain about the prices regularly, since SLA Industries makes a consumable operatives use in the defense of the very same SLA Industries arbitrarily expensive. Their reasons are two-fold: first, they don't approve of wholesale slaughter of their consumers, but most importantly... the audience prefers bloody melee combat to firefights. It's all about the ratings.\n\nAnd to finish with the damn tiger story! The strange suit asks Kate and Siris to agree to the 'standard terms', and casually reveals that Kate is in love with Barker. Once they do, he gives the squad a strange vial before disappearing in thin air. The vial is full of...\n\nquote:\n\n\"Bitter tears,\" said the man simply. \"Distilled from uncomprehending agony. It will do what you need.\"\n\nSiris volunteers to feed the... toxin? to the tiger, and charges it. He gets a nasty gash for his troubles, but it works: the tiger stops, collapses and then just... breaks down, implants popping off his body. The gang is excited by the great footage, but Barker realizes quickly that this must never be known, and orders Kate to wipe out all recordings while he and Siris ruin the tiger's corpse. They're not going to try to find out what happened to the school kids or staff, because some things are best left unknown."
