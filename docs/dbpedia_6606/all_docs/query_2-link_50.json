        "text": "D&D 3E and GenCon\n\nAs everyone knows, the big news of the year is the release of the brand new third edition of Dungeons and Dragons! It was released at last month's GenCon to general hysterics. You can check out everything you need to know about D&D at WotC's site or Erich Noah's incredibly detailed rules examination. GenCon also saw some other major new releases, such as John Wick's Orkworld, Gareth-Michael Skarka's Underworld and the new Blue Planet, as well as crowd of over twenty thousand gamers in one tiny space. We couldn't possibly do justice to the biggest event in the RPG calendar here, so take a look at the write-ups and photo essays over on The Gaming Outpost. And for heaps of reviews on all the new releases, check out RPGNet.\n\nAnd in case you missed the fall-out from the second biggest event on the gaming calendar, we've got the full list of the Origins awards, the Oscars of gaming, listed below. Check it out.\n\nSpecial Offer for PTGPTB Readers from New Brisbane Store\n\nIn more local news, our home town of Brisbane now has a brand new roleplaying store. Called Mindrush Hobbies, it can be found at 3 Cracknell Road, Annerley and you can ring them on +61 7 3392 8166. They have a good range of roleplaying and wargaming stuff, plus CCGs, board games, and other hobby paraphenalia. Best of all, they also have a good range of second hand material for reasonable prices, unlike so many stores which don't reduce prices on such material. So if you're looking for something a bit cheaper - or if you want to unload some old material - be sure to get on over there.\n\nMindrush is also strongly committed to providing a real service and a focal point to the various clubs and cons in Brisbane. As part of this, they've arranged a deal for all PTGPTB readers: just mention our name and get 10% off your first purchase!\n\nIf you'd like to know more about what they carry, check them out on the web at www.mindrush.com.au\n\nGo No Con is Coming!\n\nIn other local news, Brisbane will again enjoy the wonders of Go no Con this October. Although a bit smaller than the premier Brisbane convention, the BIG Weekend, Go no Con offers a great selection of RPGs and CCGs all for a very tiny, all-inclusive price of $10. That even includes the packs for all the sealed deck CCG events - what a deal!\n\nThe convention will include \"Legacy of the Naga\" - the Global Storyline Event for Legend of the Five Rings CCG, a chance to play a game of the brand new 3rd Edition D&D, and a massive Warhammer 40K tournament. It will be held on October 14th and 15th at Mt Gravatt TAFE Campus, and all the proceeds will go to the Red Cross. For more info and registration details, check out their website.\n\nDragonmeet Convention Back After Ten Years\n\nDragonmeet, the British adventure games convention last organised by Games Workshop in the 1980\"s, will return to central London this November thanks to Gameforce, a group of UK games companies and industry professionals.\n\nDragonmeet 2000 will be held at Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, in London, on Saturday 25th November this year.

All attendees will be given a bag containing free items donated by exhibitors and vendors at the convention.\n\nEvents at Dragonmeet will include the world-launch of at least two major new role-playing games, an auction of unique, rare and collectible gaming items, talks and workshops, and a chance to meet some of the UK's top games designers and publishers.\n\nConfirmed attendees include BITS (Traveller), Britannia Games (Chivalry & Sorcery), the Camarilla (Vampire: Mind's Eye Theatre), Hogshead Publishing (Warhammer FRP, Baron Munchausen, Pantheon, Nobilis), Leisure Games, Malefex (Principia Malefex), Nightfall Games (SLA Industries), Pelgrane Press (Dying Earth), Profantasy Software (Campaign Cartographer), and the magazines Valkyrie and Warpstone. Artists in attendance, doing sketches and selling original art, include Ralph Horsley (Ars Magica, Warhammer FRP) and Rik Martin (SLA Industries).\n\nThe original Dragonmeet conventions were noted for their friendliness and enthusiasm, and the way they did not exclude and kind of gaming or gamer. Gameforce wants the revived convention to follow in the spirit of the original events. \"There'll be something for everyone who enjoys games at Dragonmeet\", said Gameforce's director James Wallis, \"except Pokemon\".\n\nDragonmeet 2000: Saturday 25th November 2000, 10am-9pm, Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, London WC2 (closest tube Holborn).
