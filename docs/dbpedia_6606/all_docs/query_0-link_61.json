        "text": "This Progress Report for SLA Industries is a 26-page PDF brought to you by the ever-expanding Nightfall Games' team. This document adds to the World of Progress with Cannibal Sector 2, detailed by Jonny Hodgson, and a new Conflict Race by Dave Hodgson. Also included are rules for the increasingly popular Cannibal Run, a race across Cannibal Sector 1 and more information on the BPN coins, and a ton of new art! Download it today and get reading!\n\nCannibal Sector 2: Overshadowed by its neighbour, the larger, more well-known Cannibal Sector 1, CS is just as dangerous, just as dealing, and presents a while new set of challenges to SLA Ops lucky enough to be sent there on company time. This overview of Cannibal Sector 2 presents the general geography of the sector, a brief history and a summary of the places to go, things to see and do, an idea of its inhabitants and details of the major players within the sector.\n\nConflict Aliens - Cyclones: Dave Allsop takes a look at biological warfare, but dialled up to SLA. The Cyclones are a 'living' nightmare and a GM's dream come true.\n\nMaking a Killing: Life as a SLA Industries Operative can be hard. The costs of getting hurt, losing armour to enemy aggression, buying bullets, and upgrading equipment can often exceed the payments offered by BPNs and Hunter Sheets. To make ends meet, some Operatives subsidise their lifestyles with non-traditional revenue streams: BPN Coins!\n\nProfessional Traits: These traits are achieved by working at a singular profession, allowing one so specialized in such a task to modify the Skill Roll in some fashion.\n\nCannibal Run: Racing across Cannibal Sector 1 has become quite the thing, so rules were needed for that and Jared Earle's got ya covered!\n\nSLA Industries\n\nCheck out all the titles available for SLA Industries by clicking the images below.\n\nProgress Reports\n\nHunter Sheets"
