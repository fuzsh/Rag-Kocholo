Nightfall Games have released a pdf of the rules for SLA Industries: Cannibal Sector 1, the skirmish miniatures game based in the setting of the original scifi-horror RPG.

The game was originally Kickstarted in 2016 by Daruma Productions. The project has since been taken over by Nightfall Games, the owners of the original IP and SLA Industries role-playing game. They have since been working to streamline the rules and have released them to download two months before it is sent to print.

More miniatures have also started to appear as Nightfall move forwards with bringing the skirmish game to the table.

It's a really good move to put the rules out before the print run, letting the game's backers feedback on how the rules have come along, as well as check for any errors that might have crept in.

SLA Industries is a setting with a lot of potential, and the skirmish game carries over the slightly retro scifi style that characterises the world.

Check the Kickstarter to download the rules.
