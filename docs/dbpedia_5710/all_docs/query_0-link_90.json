        "text": "For most of my high school years, I was hyper-focused on a whole new group of characters: the high school \"I was in a decently successful band and I'm cooler than you\" band kids.\n\nWhen trying to break into this group and make a name for myself as an artist, I put extensive research into this scene that I so desperately wanted to be a part of. But what I found out through personal experience and the word from other young women in the community was disheartening and even sickening.\n\nTummy Ache\n\n\"Trying to find my voice, Surrounded by all boys... 'Cause it's hard to be a punk while wearing a skirt.\"\n\nThe lyrics above are by Alex Luicano, front person of band Diet Cig. In a statement given by Luicano describing the song where the above lyrics are found, she said:\n\n\"‘Tummy Ache’ is all about unpacking the feeling of approaching punk with radical softness, and the struggle when it’s not always read as powerful or cool or whatever enough. It's the shout into my pillow when what I’m saying isn’t being heard, and a big old I FEEL YA to all the femme folks creating space for themselves in a world that wants to keep us quiet.\"\n\nLuciano isn't the only person to experience this phenomenon. Femme people and women in this music scene have constantly and consistently been belittled and put down by men in the scene. Whether it's because the men feel intimidated or maybe they're attempting to flirt, this unspoken tradition of hatred towards female and femme musicians is one that deserved to be abandoned long ago.\n\nThe Brand New Incident\n\nJesse Lacey, reclusive and awkward lead singer of the Long Island Emo Band, Brand New, opened the popular social networking app, Facebook, only to be met with this post from his former guitarist, Brian Diaz:\n\n“So while we are on the topic of outing famous and semi-famous creeps, anyone want to speak up about Jesse Lacey from Brand New?”\n\nThe news came short after the bands fifth album release, Science Fiction. Diaz in his post claimed to have knowledge of several instances in which Lacey had, what Diaz called “indiscretions” involving minors, and implored more women to come forward.\n\nThe comments on this post were mixed with feelings of belief, shock, disbelief, and anger. But one comment stood out:\n\nJESSE LACEY IS A PIECE OF SHIT.\n\nThe comment was left by Nicole Garey, who claimed that Lacey had begged for pornographic images from her, for years, when she was a teenager, starting when she was 15 and he was 24. She further went on to describe Lacey’s repeated alleged requests for nude photos and the manipulative methods he would use against her to get them.\n\nAs a response to the numerous allegations building against Lacey, he posted a note to the Brand New Facebook page:\n\n“The actions of my past have caused pain and harm to a number of people, and I want to say that I am absolutely sorry. I do not stand in defense of myself nor do I forgive myself,” the singer wrote. “I was selfish, narcissistic, and insensitive in my past, and there are a number of people who have had to shoulder the burden of my failures. I apologize for the hurt I have caused, and hope to be able to take the correct actions to earn forgiveness and trust.”\n\nThe \"Male Manipulator Music\" Trend\n\nThe trend of listening to “male manipulator music” has gained popularity within the last few months, especially on the social media app Tik Tok. Sure, this indie sub-genre is undeniably a male- dominated space. But does it deserve the title ‘manipulator’? I think this trend can be traced back to the whitewashed trend of romanticizing emotionally unavailable indie men, and thus, in order to unpack and understand this breed of boy, we look to the intersections of their interests for answers. It’s a secret language we’ve developed in order to identify (and avoid) common red flags. Maybe it’s the indie scene’s ongoing sexual harassment issue previously mentioned. Front men of big names have consistently been accused of emotional and physical abuse, including Sorority Noise, Mom Jeans, The Front Bottoms and more.\n\nThis romanticization of these band members only further enforces the theory of “rapey music”, which has recently emerged as a social problem in feminist and mainstream contexts.\n\nRapey music references songs that critics perceive as evidence of “rape culture” because they encourage and romanticize sexual violence, misogyny, and rape myths. This article by Ummni Khan at Carleton University draws on the concept of “fetishism” to discuss accusations that certain songs are rapey and argue that such songs can be recuperated through a kink lens. In the first part, Khan reviews the ever-growing category of songs that have been condemned in feminist media analyses, commonly addressing them with the term “canceled,” and the weak evidence that connects certain songs to sexual coercion, arguing that the terms “rapey” and “rape culture” operate as negative fetish concept, or “kink-shaming”. Khan then analyzes the disproportionate and more troubling practice of targeting of Black performers, explaining that a radicalized fetishization underlies this phenomenon.\n\nThe concept of \"rape culture\" has resonated in a variety of spheres, including television, gaming, comic book culture, and college campuses. Beyond Blurred Lines : Rape Culture in Popular Media traces ways that sexual violence is collectively processed, mediated, negotiated, and contested by exploring public reactions to high-profile incidents and rape narratives in popular culture. The concept of rape culture was initially embraced in popular media-- mass media, social media, and popular culture-- and contributed to a social understanding of sexual violence that mirrored feminist concerns about the persistence of rape myths and victim-blaming.\n\nSo What?\n\nJoseph Cox, professor of music studies at the University of New Hampshire, shared an article with The Odyssey addressing this unfortunate phenomenon. In this article, Cox shares the story of the woman I previously mentioned, Nicole Garey, one of the underage victims of Jesse Lacey, the singer and frontman to emo/pop-punk group Brand New. In the article, Cox shares a quote from Garey stating, “I still break down and have panic attacks when people play Brand New in a bar,” said Nicole Garey, [Jesse Lacey] made it clear that my sexuality was the only thing I had to offer.”\n\nThe long-term effects still shine through in many of the victims of these musicians, some even spiraling into depressions and experiencing suicidal tendencies. The overall acceptance of this blatant sexism is appalling, and something that needs attention immediately.\n\nDo you think this is \"boys being boys\" or do you think this issue should be taken more seriously?"
