From short animated films to feature-length documentary productions, Humanity in Action films tackle difficult and harrowing subject matter, while calling viewers to take on increased democratic responsibility in line with the organization’s mission.\n\nOver the last three years, Humanity in Action has expanded the scope of our films. Our two most recent film projects are the animated short documentary trilogy Traces: Portraits of Resistance, Survival and Resolve and I, Too, a documentary film from the mind of Carol Anderson.\n\nSee below for more information on these productions, as well as Humanity in Action’s other film projects.\n\nTraces: Portraits of Resistance, Survival and Resolve\n\nSeventy-seven years after the fall of Nazi Germany, the Holocaust stands as a staggering crime against humanity, and the world continues to grapple with the deep void of the six million souls lost. Yet, in the face of unfathomable horror, fleeting moments of bravery and generosity remind us of our capacity for courage and compassion even under the most harrowing circumstances.\n\nThe Traces trilogy brings three such histories to life and to new audiences. Developed by an international team of documentarians, researchers and animators, the trilogy preserves these critical stories for future generations.\n\nThe Traces trilogy is a Humanity in Action production, with generous support from the Alfred Landecker Foundation and the Danish Foreign Ministry. It includes the films Voices in the Void, Two Trees in Jerusalem and My Father’s War.\n\nSee below for more information on the three films.\n\nI, Too\n\nOn January 6, 2021, armed insurrectionists besieged the United States Capitol in the name of patriotism. To some, it was an unexpected and shocking attack on democracy. To others, it was a noble attempt to rescue a nation on the brink of collapse. For Carol Anderson, the insurrection was a predictable coda to more than two centuries of American mythology. What happens, she asks, when we discover that the history we teach our children is comprised of fables not facts; when the gulf between soaring rhetoric and cynical policy is too wide to ignore; when white supremacy is allowed to thrive? In I, Too, we embark on a journey to shine a light on stories that reveal how we reached this inflection point in American history, as we strive to narrow the gap between who we say we are as a nation…and who we actually are.\n\nI, Too is a co-production of the Bertelsmann Foundation and Humanity in Action, with generous support from the Donner Foundation. The film was shot on location in Wilmington, North Carolina; Washington, DC; Ocoee, Florida; North Augusta, South Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAbout Carol Anderson:\n\nCarol Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of African American Studies at Emory University and author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, a New York Times Bestseller, Washington Post Notable Book of 2016, and a National Book Critics Circle Award winner. She is also the author of Eyes Off the Prize: The United Nations and the African American Struggle for Human Rights, 1944-1955; Bourgeois Radicals: The NAACP and the Struggle for Colonial Liberation, 1941-1960, and One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression is Destroying Our Democracy, which was long-listed for the National Book Award and a finalist for the PEN/Galbraith Award in non-fiction."
