It uses mainly photography instead of animation or computer-generated images.\n\nPublished in Chapter:\n\nThe Presence of the Uncanny Valley Between Animation and Cinema: A Communication Approach\n\nRodrigo Assaf (Digital Creativity Centre, School of Arts, Portuguese Catholic University, Portugal), Sahra Kunz (CITAR, School of Arts, Portuguese Catholic University, Portugal), and Luís Teixeira (CITAR, School of Arts, Portuguese Catholic University, Portugal)\n\nCopyright: © 2020 |Pages: 22\n\nDOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-3669-8.ch005\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite all the technological advances in the field of computer graphics, the uncanny valley effect is still an observed phenomenon affecting not only how animated digital characters are developed but also the audience's reaction during a film session. With the emergence of computer-generated images being used in films, this chapter aims at presenting a multidisciplinary approach concerning the uncanny valley topic. This phenomenon is mainly explained by several psychological theories based on human perception; however, this chapter contributes to the discussion presenting a communication perspective based on the uses and gratification theory connected to the genre theory proposed by Daniel Chandler. In addition, the authors discuss how the technological evolution in rendering is helping out artists to cross the valley, which ends up being unveiled only by motion. As a result of this technical evolution, it is proposed a new animation art style category defined as quasi-real."
