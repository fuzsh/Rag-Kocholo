There’s a storytelling quality to this single and the way the artist phrases his rap feels like a personal conversation to the listener.

My baby girl, Vienna”\n\nSHADE is an emerging lyrical rapper and spoken word artist making music for self-expression. Though she is new to creating original music with only over two months of experience (at the moment), she desires strong messages and themes in each of her tracks. “Honesty through music” is her goal and drive. “Oh Snap, she is speaking some TRUTH!,” “I need more of this don’t stop,” and “Woah, the perspective” are a few comments from followers on various social media and streaming platforms.

I thought it would be fun to create a TikTok where I went from zero rap skills and knowledge and tracked my progress. This ended up making me nearly quit from the horrific responses/names I was called and I began to drown in that negativity thinking I was unable to ever learn the skill. Then one day on a walk a line hit me “Everything I do must be so perfect. Is it worth it when every time you’re working you feel worthless?” This one thought turned into more lines. The first part of the song is cathartic while the second is more about how we should encourage and help each other. So it became about drowning/saving people from drowning. We should be lifeguards instead of submerge people with our words and actions. On week 10 of rapping/writing I finally felt like I had created something worth spreading with “Never Let Them Drown.”\n\nChaos0911 – Dependable\n\nMusic Genre: hip hop\n\nVibe: chill relaxing melo romantic\n\nLocated in: Covington, LA\n\nHip Hop artist Chaos0911 from Covington, LA recently released his first single ‘Dependable’ that melts his love of hiphop with R&B and soul influences. I would consider this melodic hiphop and it is a refreshing take on the genre when most tracks are fast paced and more syncopated. Hip hop artists in todays music landscape are trying to find a balance between being artistically creative while still appealing to the masses. Chaos0911 has found that nice balance with ‘Dependable’ bringing in some old with some news elements while speaking to a more traditional listener. ‘\n\nThe Honorable Jay is making Hip Hop music bold and ambitious\n\nHailing from St. Augustine FL and currently producing from Houston TX, The Honorable Jay is making music that’s bold and fierce with drive and ambition.\n\nMore Here\n\nDon Drago. – Paradise Ft Bezz Believe & Nawlage\n\nMusic Genre: Hip-hop, Tropical, Pop-rap\n\nVibe: Fun, Happy, Tropical\n\nLocated in: Tampa FL\n\nSounds like: Flo rida, Pitbull\n\nRelease date: April 28, 2023 : Listen here\n\nDon Drago, the rising star in the music industry, has announced the release of his new single “Paradise” featuring Bezz Believe and Nawlage 2K5.
