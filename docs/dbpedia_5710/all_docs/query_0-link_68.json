        "text": "I {The Evolution of Music Censorship}“I can’t help it, I’m just a slave to the music” -Michael Jackson-\n\nAshley Zergott-writer/proofreader\n\nColleen Whewell-writer\n\nBeth Lasko-writer\n\nArie Wolfert-writer\n\nBridget Weslow-writer\n\nGreg Zieroff-proofreader\n\nJamie Wilcox-editor\n\nPatrick Watkins-page designer\n\nMusic Censorship\n\nMusic has always been a way to express ideas. However, like television and\n\nmovies, music is also seen as a way of influencing children and teenagers.\n\nPopular music has always been a subject of censorship. Lyrics containing\n\nreferences to sex, drugs, and alcohol are seen as reasons to censor certain\n\nmusic from the public audiences. There are eight main principles that censorship\n\nis based on: differentiation, protecting the young, private vs. public\n\nconsumption, artistic merit, safeguarding National interests, public\n\ninvolvement, simplification of procedures, and targeting at mass distributors.\n\nThe question of music censorship has been going on for decades. It is not only a\n\nmatter of legality and constitutionality, but censorship is also about morality\n\nand personal preference. Those in favor of censorship feel that some music\n\nharmfully affects society and the American culture and that censorship can help\n\nto preserve the culture. Whereas those who oppose censorship believe it impairs\n\nconstitutional right of freedom of speech and takes away the ability to express\n\nideas. The constant debate of censorship has been going on for decades and does\n\nnot show any signs of changing. There will never be a “right” answer to this\n\nissue; it will always be a matter of opinion.\n\nII\n\nHistory of Censorship\n\nHow many generations of\n\nkids have heard their parents\n\nsay, \"When I was young, music\n\nwas good, not this junk you\n\nlisten to!\" The answer is\n\nthat music censorship has\n\nbeen going on for many years.\n\nIt dates back to the turn of\n\nthe 20th century with the\n\narrival of ragtime music, a\n\ntype of music that was\n\ncreated by African American\n\nchildren. One of the most\n\npopular ragtime songs\n\nentitled \"Maple Leaf Rag\"\n\ncontained lyrics that talked\n\nabout going to a town dance,\n\nhardly controversial by\n\ntoday's standards, but\n\nchallenged the authorities\n\nthen. A few decades later, a\n\nnew controversial artist,\n\nMiles Davis, fused jazz and\n\nrock music together and was\n\nstrongly criticized and\n\naccused of leading jazz\n\nastray.\n\nAnother controversial\n\nband of yesteryear, The\n\nBeatles, broke controversial\n\nground, and their music\n\ntemporarily banned in Britain\n\nbecause of lyrics about drug\n\nusage. Parents cringed at\n\nthe idea of\n\ntheir daughter going to a\n\nBeatles concert because of\n\nthe exposure to\n\ncrazed fans and immoral his interracial music, there\n\nmay never be another artist\n\nwho reaches such a\n\ncontroversial status, though\n\nsome contemporary musicians\n\nare trying. In one of\n\nEminem's latest songs, his\n\nlyrics read, \"Though I'm not\n\nthe first king of\n\ncontroversy/I am the worst\n\nthing since Elvis\n\nPresley.\" Though these\n\nartists and songs are no\n\nlonger part of pop culture,\n\nthe paths they paved will\n\nnever be forgotten. Colleen Whewell\n\nIII Slim Shady Eminem(a cat or a mouse)\n\nIn today’s society one of the most highly censored artists is Eminem. He is\n\na Caucasian rap artist whose lyrics\n\ncontain many controversial subjects from\n\nreferences to “fags,” fantasies of raping\n\nhis own mother, jokes about domestic\n\nviolence, and excessive amounts of\n\nprofanity. All of these topics which\n\nwould lead a person to believe that his\n\nlyrics should be censored, and that these\n\nlyrics promote violence among\n\nadolescents. On one of the many\n\nwebsites that contain information on\n\nEminem and his lyrics, Eminem is found\n\nstating, “A lot of my rhymes are just to\n\nget chuckles out of people. Anybody\n\nwith half a brain is going to be able to tell\n\nwhen I’m joking and when I’m serious.”\n\nTo prove this to be a point and that he\n\ndoes not write music to criticize different\n\ngroups of people Eminem came up with\n\nthe idea to sing with Elton John at the\n\n2001 Grammy Awards. This gesture was\n\nto prove that Eminem has no harsh\n\nfeelings towards homosexual people.\n\nAnother accomplishment of this artist is\n\nthat he recently received an Academy\n\nAward for best song, “Loose Yourself”\n\noff of his 8-mile soundtrack. Also\n\ndespite Eminem being a highly censored\n\nartist his album Marshall Mathers LP was\n\nup for album of the year and three other\n\nrap categories. Eminem also managed to\n\nsell 7.9 million copies of this album.\n\nMusic is a form of expression and like\n\nmany other artists of our past his name\n\nmay eventually go down as being one of\n\nthe best recording artists of our time.\n\n-Bridget Weslow\n\nIV Oops I did it Again (Britney Spears)\n\nCensorship of Britney\n\nSpears\n\nWhen the topic of\n\nmusic censorship comes up,\n\nmany think of Rock n’\n\nRoll or rap music by\n\nartists such as Eminem or\n\nElvis Presley, but many\n\noverlook that people have\n\nwith pop music as well.\n\nSince the release of\n\nBritney Spears’ first\n\nalbum her lyrics have been\n\na concern. To many,\n\nthe hit song “Baby One\n\nMore Time” encourages\n\nsex, suicide, and is\n\ndegrading\n\nto females. The lyric --My\n\nloneliness is killing me\n\nnow-- promotes that\n\nbeing lonely will kill\n\nyou, and that physical\n\nharm is a reasonable\n\nsolution. Censorship is a\n\ntopic of controversy\n\nthroughout all pop music\n\nand does not end with\n\nBritney Spears. Many feel\n\nfeel that these violent\n\nmessages are hidden by\n\nupbeat and catchy music\n\ntones. While the debate\n\nover what music should be\n\ncensored and what should\n\nnot continues, musical\n\nlyrics will continue to be\n\npromoted and it is up to\n\nthe parents to decide what\n\nthey feel is appropriate\n\nfor their children.\n\n-Beth Lasko\n\nV We’re all stars now, in the dope show (Marlyn Manson)\n\nHas Censorship of Marilyn Manson Ceased? In the past few years, there has been definite protesting of artists’ music and the message that they send to people, especially children. Today, groups and artists like\n\nEminem, Christina Aguilara, and Slipknot have all received recent protesting against\n\ntheir works. However, Marilyn Manson, once viewed as the ultimate anti-Christ in this\n\ncountry, has seemed to faze himself out of the public eye. This is interesting because\n\nabout five ago, Marilyn Manson seemed to be the only person receiving flack about his\n\nmusic. One of the biggest tragedies that the United States has ever seen was that of the shootings that occurred in Littleton, Colorado. At Columbine High School, Eric Harris\n\nand Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher, shooting the innocent before\n\ncommitting their own lives as well. When this first happened, many were alarmed and\n\nunsure what to think, but as soon as the media got a hold of the fact that these kids\n\nlistened to Marilyn Manson’s music, he was immediately typecast as the person who was\n\nresponsible for these vicious crimes. At first, Manson could not go anywhere without\n\nbeing accused of the boys’ actions. In an article by Ari Armstrong, he stated that people\n\nwere simply just exercising their right of free speech. Marilyn Manson countered with\n\nhis own article defending himself of the accusations. He stated, “When it comes down to\n\nwho’s to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and\n\nyou’ll hit someone who’s guilty. We’re the people who sit back and tolerate children VI owning guns, and we’re the ones who tune in and watch the up-to-the-minute details of\n\nwhat they do with them.” With arguments like this one, Manson seemed to get the media\n\noff of his back, which brings this article to the main focus; where has he been since? Marilyn Manson, by writing his own responses in literary form and also by staying out of the spotlight, has single handedly gotten himself away from talks of\n\ncensorship and blame for other people’s actions. The whole issue of censorship is totally\n\nin the hands of the media. They choose whom they want to label and cover, and they\n\nchoose who they have had enough of. In this case, Marilyn Manson became old news\n\nand, much to his probable delight, I do not think he minded.\n\n-Arie Wolfert\n\n“Everybody’s someone else’s ******, I know you are so am I. I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers. I don’t need to choose a side.” - Marlyn Manson\n\nbw\n\npart 2\n\nVII\n\nHittin the Streets\n\nInstead of just going straight to the websites and hitting the books we decided to find out what the\n\npeople around us on campus and in our hometown communities thought about the censorship of music.\n\nWhile the ages ranged from fourteen to sixty-eight the answers all shared many similarities on the side of\n\nmusic should not be censored and also on the side of music needs to be censored. One of the questions\n\nthat was asked of all of the survey takers was, “Do you find any songs to be offensive to gender or society\n\nas a whole?” A common theme among the answers for this question was that Eminem lyrics contain very\n\noffensive language and they are offensive to both gender and society. Eminem’s name appeared on around\n\nseventy percent of all of the survey takers, all of which commented on how offensive his lyrics are. An\n\neighteen-year-old male commented on Eminem’s lyrics by stating, “Yes, some songs are offensive to our\n\nsociety, but it is just the style of music Eminem does. It is just lyrics.” Since these songs are just lyrics\n\nsome people felt that people of today’s society are looking too far into the whole music censorship issue,\n\nand that music is simply a form of expression that is given to us through the first amendment. No matter\n\nwhat the lyrics say if it sells then artists are going to continue to produce the same kind of music whether it\n\nis offensive or not. People also commented that people in today’s society take things to seriously and\n\nmusic lyrics really are not causing people to run off and do horrible things because of what they hear in the\n\nsong lyrics. There are people who feel very different on this issue and their largest complaint was rap\n\nmusic. A twenty-year-old female commented on rap music bye saying, “Rap music should all be censored\n\nbecause it contains discriminatory comments and leads people to have prejudice beliefs.” The problem is\n\nthat it is not possible for companies to take producing rights away from artists for their music, and it is up\n\nto the parents to monitor what there children are listening to. VIII The kids\n\nShould Music be Censored- People Under 3012Number of People Who Own CDs with a Parental Advisory- People Under 3012\n\nNumber of People Whose Parents Censored Their Music- People Under 3012\n\nThe old timers… Should Music Be Censored- People Over 3012Number of People Who Own CDs With a Parental Advisory- People over 3012Number of People Whose Parents Censored Their Music- People over 3012IX\n\nSurvey Results Music is a large form of expression in today’s society and influences many people within our own lives. While interviewing a large number of people we found that results from the adults, ages 30 and up, contained some similarities to those of the teenagers, ages 30 and below. For both age groups it was just a little bit under fifty percent of the people that feel that music should be censored. Also a common occurrence for both the adult and teenage group is that Eminem and primarily other rap music should be at the top for being censored. An unexpected result that occurred in the teenage group is that even though more then fifty percent of the people felt that music should be censored only about twenty-five percent of the people actually own CDs with a parental advisory on the label. There has been a large decrease in the number of parents that monitor the music that their children listen to. It has decreased almost twenty-five percent. With as much controversy as there is over whether or not artists should be censored, parents need to do censoring within the house too. -Ashley Zergott X\n\nMusic lyrics are a very controversial issue and will continue to be as new music is\n\nproduced. It is not just rap music that people are looking to have censored there is a\n\nwide range of artists. Popular artists such as Brittany Spears who millions of people\n\nlisten to has been in and out of the censorship spotlight, saying that her lyrics\n\nencourage sex, suicide, and are degrading to females. Eminem is another current artist\n\nwho many people would like to see censored, but yet he continues to sell millions of\n\ncopies of his album and his movie was a recent hit in the theatres. Marlyn Manson\n\nhas finally been able to escape censorship issues after he was accused of being a large\n\nreason for the killing spree that happened at Columbine High School. Like Marlyn\n\nManson the popular artists of today will begin to fade into the past and a new\n\ngeneration of music will evolve that people feel needs to be censored. Maybe\n\neventually these artists of today will become known as one of the greatest artist to\n\never live, as Elvis did. What is said in music lyrics is a freedom of speech that all\n\nAmericans are entitled to and this ongoing issue of music censorship may never end.\n\nXI\n\nReferences\n\n(2001) Planet-Eminem.com.
