        "text": "Namaste, Scribblers! I’ve recently become obsessed with action movies from India. Most folks know about “RRR,” but I just saw a flick called “Fighter” in a theater. It’s Top Gun with dancing and kiss-free romance. This sent me down the Amazon Prime/Netflix rabbit hole of movies from the most productive film industry on the planet. This pulled me out of a creative malaise and got me fired up about scribbling action movies.\n\nSomething that hit me like a cozy blanket on Saturday morning was how the first hour of an action blockbuster might be devoid of… blockbuster action. And running counter to everything I ever learned about writing movies and TV – nothing bad happened to the main characters. There were no reversals. Zero.\n\nSome of my favorite Indian action flicks, like \"War\" or \"Pathaan,\" luxuriously spend the first hour without introducing immediate danger. This approach starkly contrasts with the quick-to-action narratives typical in Western films and everything I’ve ever written.\n\nThis approach offers rich lessons in building emotional depth and connection to your main characters. Let's look at some examples:\n\nIn \"War,\" before the high-octane chase sequences and intense combat, we're given a deep dive into the lives of Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) and Khalid (Tiger Shroff). The film spends considerable time exploring their mentor-mentee relationship, laying a solid emotional foundation.\n\nThis investment in character depth pays off, making the subsequent action sequences not just thrilling but emotionally charged, as we're now deeply invested in the fate of the characters.\n\n\"Pathaan\" takes its time to reintroduce Shah Rukh Khan's titular character, a disavowed RAW agent (India’s CIA?), drawing us into his world and the complexities of the guy’s past. Before any guns are drawn or punches thrown, we're already hooked, fully vested in Pathaan's journey.\n\nThis slow reveal amplifies the impact of the action and the stakes of his mission, demonstrating the power of patience in a genre that is typically helter-skelter.\n\nI’ve learned this narrative approach is deeply rooted in India's broader cultural storytelling traditions. Take \"Ek Tha Tiger,\" for example, where the romance between Tiger (Salman Khan) and Zoya (Katrina Kaif) unfolds against a backdrop of espionage and international intrigue.\n\nThe film takes its time developing their relationship, making their later challenges and conflicts all the more compelling.\n\nIndian cinema's genius lies in its ability to seamlessly blend genres. \"Tiger Zinda Hai combines action with drama, romance, and even moments of wacky levity, creating a multifaceted narrative that engages on multiple levels and totally defies Western expectations.\n\nIndian audiences have different expectations, seeking a complete entertainment package that films like \"War\" and \"Pathaan\" deliver. By building up characters and their world pre-mayhem and chaos, these movies deliver a satisfying and emotionally resonant audience experience.\n\nEmbrace the slow build to make the eventual conflict more engaging and meaningful.\n\nDon’t be afraid to integrate multiple narrative elements to enrich your story, much like “Fighter” and \"Tiger Zinda Hai\" weave romance into their action plots.\n\nGround your fantastical stories with real-world emotions and relationships. That’s one we’re already comfortable with.\n\nSo, as you scribble your next bang-bang-filled opus, consider taking a page from Indian cinema's playbook. A billion movie lovers might thank you by buying a ticket."
