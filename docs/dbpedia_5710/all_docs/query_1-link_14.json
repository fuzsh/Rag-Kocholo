        "text": "Rock Music Genre Essay\n\n1186 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn rock music its target audience is the youth. And by youth I am not referring to teenagers, but instead to the mentality of youth, the adults and teens still in the sociological stage between being a ‘kid’ and accepting the responsibilities of ‘adulthood’ [Weinstein pg6] These youth negotiate the genre and change it to their liking. For example both males and females have different subgenres of rock targeted specifically at them. Males are seen from a young age as being naughty and rowdy, not very responsible and thus given more freedom. While girls are seen as quiet and polite, with very low aggression. These traits have reflected in the genres that are targeted at the two genders. Males were targeted with Heavy Metal as it expressed the qualities the very qualities they will have to give up in order to become adults and how they will lose their freedom. While for females rock music is soft and romantic, females will typically grow up faster than males and leave youth behind in order to take up responsibilities. An example of how the music was negotiated to fit the two genders is seem in the 1960s when performers such as Carole king and James Taylor transformed themes of protest into sentimental commentaries, romance and illusions of youth. [Weinstein pg 12-13] While heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath sung about politicians and how disgusting they are for exploiting young people in the name of greed which is shown in the song Wicked World. This very characteristic of rock being created by the youth for the youth is still alive today, for example during the 2004 presidential election Green Day released American Idiot. The song was about how the media and political are brainwashing Americans to remove their individuality. The singer wanted to warn America of this and prevent them from turning into ‘idiots’ and\n\nRock Music and Confined Sexual Repression in the 1960's\n\n1122 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn the 1960s, rock music had an increasing impact in teen culture. According to teenage girl response to the confined sexual repression, rock music created many controversial consequences. Music became a commodity that served escapism from reality instead of creating options and choices and brought the teen cultures to go against the mainstream culture to bring forth identities that are more coherent and ideal. Rock and roll was the most compelling commodity to enter the teen consumer culture. Gender roles being unequal created a sexist double standard and women were the object of needs and desire of men. Teen peer groups became incomparable in terms of language and style as sexual release and freedom were available to girls and women. In the teen culture, girls were using their music as an escape from the predictable life paths, as music becomes a commodity that serves escapism from the real world. In a male dominant teen culture, girls were part with societal limitations and that gender hierarchies and a sexual double standard were absolutely bounded up with the sexual ideology of ‘rock and roll’ in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nEssay On Hip Hop As A Subculture\n\n1844 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn today’s world, music is played just about everywhere around the world. There is not many days that go by that you don’t hear some type of music. Those music’s can be broken down into their own sub categories and with that they can become into a subculture that people belong to or just claim to be a part of. To explain it more a subculture is defined as a cultural group within a culture, that often has beliefs or interest that is apart from those of the main culture itself. Subcultures are often made so that those who are actively participating within them can be set apart from those of other groups. They feel the need to establish their own ideas, traditions, languages, and criteria to form something that is their own and that makes them different from anything else. That can also cause for conclusions to be made up in the form of stereotypes that can sometimes be\n\nAnalysis Of 5 Seconds Of Summer\n\n1198 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMy object of analysis is going to be “boy bands” which I am defining as “a band of boys usually playing pop music that is marketed towards young women.” I am going to specifically look at the band 5 Seconds of Summer and I am going to look at how their music and success becomes undermined because their target audience is primarily young women. I am going to do this using feminist theory and this project will examine how ideologies regarding the connection between young women and the band itself being written off artistically are almost embedded within society, in that people say things such as “this band sucks” without ever really listening due to their classification as a boy band. This is primarily linked back to who they are marketed toward,\n\nPunk Rock Movement In The 80's\n\n665 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe conveying message of DIY (do-it-yourself) set a platform for people to think and make stance for themselves. The rejection of norms was one of their base reasoning. Through vulgar lyrics and shocking outward appearances, socially the movement may have been the one of the first cultures that thought rebellion. Bluntly raising questions against authority through lyrics influenced teenagers the idealism of freeing oneself again the government. Using such a platforms set the stage for a new age of thinking. Punk \"deliberately cultivated an image of violence, deviance, and repugnance at the very inception of the subculture” (Leblanc 39). Despite the image that Punk Rock portrayed, its messages on self-expression and independence have inspired many generations to come both musically and\n\nMusic and Deviant Behavior\n\n1614 Words | 4 Pages\n\nOften times throughout history and in today’s world, music along with lyrics of songs and musical artists are blamed for deviant behavior in adolescents and teenagers. Some argue that subcultures are created because of artists and their music which leads to groups of young adults taking part in deviant behavior, while others argue the opposite; that the behavior leads the person to listen to the music. There is also concern about the effect that music videos have on the behaviors of the listeners of music throughout all genres. Although there is not much extended research on music and the effect it has on its listeners there is plenty of speculation, theories, and minor studies.\n\nRap Music's Influence Upon Teenagers\n\n1389 Words | 3 Pages\n\nPeople are surrounded by music every day of their lives. They hear it in their homes, on the radio on their way to work; some people have even caught themselves humming the tune of their favorite song to themselves. But how many people actually listen and not just hear the music they are listening to? Teens in particular don’t realize the message behind the music they are quoting the lyrics to, or the effect it has on them. In today’s culture where rap music has become increasingly popular, many teens aren’t realizing what they are listening to. A lot of teens would argue that the music they listen to has no effect on them, but they are wrong. Rap music, especially, has had a major impact on teenagers in today’s society.\n\nWhy Do Violent Lyrics Cause Teen Violence?\n\n540 Words | 2 Pages\n\nTeens and the human populous have been draw to music, and the relief it gives off. As recent as the 1990’s, we’ve seen an increase in explicit and violent lyrics and deviant behavior in the music industry surrounding such genres as heavy metal, rock, rap, and gangster rap. During this past decade, lyrics are becoming more violent and sexually explicit. It is approximated that teens listen to an average of 40 hours of music a week, and somewhere along the way, a child will hear something derogatory, or cruel. Along with this, teens don’t necessarily interpret what is said through lyrics in the right manner. In one study, only 30% of those somewhat questionable lyrics by popular bands were comprehended by the teen population.\n\nMusic Affects Teenage Behavior\n\n1136 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMany theories on how music can affect teens have been made, such as: Reflection rejection, drive reduction, and excitation-transfer. Reflection rejection suggest that music is only looked upon, or into in this case, as a mirror of a teen’s life. (Gardstrom 2). It suggest that music does not create emotions, feelings, or even a personality that does not initially exist. This theory challenges people to believe that music to teens are nothing but a mere diary of who they are and that negative behavior does not come from music but from the teen. Anything negative was created from within, whereas the teen ultimately chooses what they consume through their ears which is soon planted into their brain. Music does not determine behavior, instead inner characteristi..."
