        "text": "The creation process was simultaneously freeing and scary.\n\n\"It was a little of the unknown and then a sense of hope, but also after there was acceptance and then it was freeing. I was like, all right, well, I guess we’re just doing this,\" Clark recalls. \"It was an emotional, mental rollercoaster at that time, but it was great to have these guys to navigate through it and create something in the midst of it.\"\n\nJPEG RAW is also deeply personal, with lyrics reflecting on the future for Clark himself, his family, and others around the globe. While Clark has long reflected on political and social uncertainties, his new release widens the lens. Songs like \"Habits\" examine a universal humanity in his desire to avoid bad habits, while \"Maktub\" details life's common struggles and hopes.\n\nClark and his band were aided in their pursuit by longtime collaborator and co-producer Jacob Sciba and a wide array of collaborators. Clark’s prolific streak of collaborations continued, with the album also featuring funk master George Clinton, electronic R&B/alt-pop artist Naala, session trumpeter Keyon Harrold, and Clark’s sisters Shanan, Shawn, and Savannah. He also sampled songs by Thelonious Monk and Sonny Boy Williamson.\n\nClark has also remained busy as an actor (he played American blues legend Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis) and as a music ambassador (he was the Music Director for the 23rd Annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor).\n\nGRAMMY.com recently caught up with Clark, who will kick off his U.S. tour May 8, about his inspirations for JPEG RAW, collaborating with legendary musicians, and how creating music for a film helped give him a boost of confidence in the studio.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nYou incorporated traditional African music on JPEG RAW. How did it affect your songwriting process?\n\nWell, I think traveling is how it affected my songwriting process. I was over in London, and we played a show with Songhoy Blues, and I was immediately influenced. I was like, \"dang, these are my musical brothers from all the way across the world.\"\n\nI always kind of listened to West African funk and all that kind of stuff. So, I was just listening to that in the studio, and just kind of started messing around with the thing. And that just kind of evolved from there. I was later told by Jacob Sciba that he was playing that music trying to brainwash me into leaning more in that direction. I thought we were just genuinely having a good time exploring music together, and he was trying to manipulate me. [Laughs.]\n\nI quit caring about what people thought about me wanting to be a certain thing. I think that being compared to Jimi Hendrix is a blessing and a curse for me because I'm not that. I will never be that. I never wanted to imitate or copy that, no disrespect.\n\nYou’ve got to find your own thing. And my own thing is incorporating all the styles of music that I love, that I grew up on, and [was] influenced by as a pre-teen/teenager. To stay in one space and just be content doing that has never been my personality ever…I do what I like.\n\nI read that you play trumpet at home and also have a set of bagpipes, just in case the mood strikes.\n\nI used to go collect instruments and old cameras from thrift stores and vintage shops and flea markets. So, I saw some bagpipes and I just picked them up. I've got a couple of violins. I don't play well at all — if you could consider that even playing. I've got trumpet, saxophone, flutes, all kinds of stuff just in case I can use these instruments in a way that'll make me think differently about music. It'll inspire me to go in a different direction that I've maybe never explored before, or I can translate some of that into playing guitar.\n\nOne of my favorite guitarists, Albert Collins, was really inspired by horn players. So, if you can understand that and apply that to your number one instrument, maybe it could affect you.\n\nGiven recent discussions about advancements in AI and our general inundation with technology, the title of your album is very relevant. What about people seeing life through that filter concerns you? Why does the descriptor seem apt?\n\nDuring the pandemic, since I wasn't out in the world, I was on my phone and the information I was getting was through whatever social media platforms and what was going on in certain news outlets, all the news outlets. I'm just paying attention and I'm just like, man, there's devastation.\n\nI realized that I don't have to let it affect me. Just because things are accessible doesn't mean that you need to [access them]. It just made me think that I needed to do less of this and more of being appreciative of my world that's right in front of me, because right now it is really beautiful.\n\nYou’ve said the album plays out like a film, with a wide range of emotions throughout. What was it like seeing the album have that film-like quality?\n\nI had conversations with the band, and I'd expressed to them that I want to be able to see it. I want to be able to see it on film, not just hear it. Keyboardist Jon Deas is great with [creating a] sonic palate and serving a mood along with [Eric] \"King\" Zapata who plays [rhythm] guitar. What he does with the guitar, it serves up a mood to you. You automatically see a color, you see a set design or something, and I just said, \"Let's explore that. Let's make these things as dense as possible. Let's go like Hans Zimmer meets John Lee Hooker. Let's just make big songs that kind of tell some sort of a story.\"\n\nAlso, we were stuck to our own devices, so we had to use our imagination. There was time, there was no schedule. So, we were free, open space, blank canvas.\n\nThe album opens with \"Maktub,\" which is the Arabic word for fate or destiny. How has looking at different traditions given you added clarity with looking at what's happening here in the U.S.?\n\nI was sitting in the studio with Jacob Sciba and my friend Sama'an Ashrawi and we were talking about the history of the blues. And then we started talking about the real history of the blues, not just in its American form, in an evolution back to Africa. You listen to a song like \"Maktub,\" and then you listen to a song like, \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" by Jimmy Reed….\n\nThe last record was This Land, but what about the whole world? What about not just focusing on this, but what else is going on out there? And we drew from these influences. We talked about family, we talked about culture, we talked about tradition, we talked about everything. And it's like, let's make it inclusive, build the people up. Let's build ourselves up. It’s not just about your small world, it’s about everybody’s feelings. Sometimes they're dealt with injustice and devastation everywhere, but there's also this global sense of hope. So, I just wanted to have a song that had the sentiment of that.\n\nI really enjoyed the song’s hopeful message of trying to move forward.\n\nObviously, things are a little bit funky around here, and I don't have any answers. But maybe if we got our heads together and brainstorm, we could all figure something out instead of … struggling or suffering in silence. It's like, let's find some light here.\n\nBut part of the talks that I had with Sama'an and his parents over a [video] call was music. He’s from Palestine, and growing up music was a way to connect. Music was a way to find happiness in a place where that wasn't an everyday convenience, and that was really powerful. That music is what brought folks together and brought joy and built a community and a common way of thinking globally. They were listening to music from all over the world, American music, rock music, and that was an influence.\n\nThe final song on the album, \"Habits,\" sounds like it was the most challenging song to put together. What did you learn from putting that song together?\n\nWell, that song originally was a bunch of different pieces, and I thought that they were different songs, and I was singing the different parts to them, and then I decided to put them all together. I think I was afraid to put them all together because we were like, \"let's not do these long self-indulgent pieces of music. Let's keep it cool.\" But once I put these parts together and put these lyrics together, it just kind of made sense.\n\nI got emotional when I was singing it, and I was like, This is part of using this as an outlet for the things that are going on in life. We went and recorded it in Nashville with Mike Elizondo and his amazing crew, and it's like, yep, we're doing it all nine minutes of it.\n\nYou collaborated with a bunch of musicians on this album, including Naala on \"This Is Who We Are.\" What was that experience like?\n\nWorking with Naala was great. That song was following me around for a couple of years, and I knew what I wanted it to sound like, but I didn't know how I was going to sing it. I had already laid the musical bed, and I think it was one of the last songs that we recorded vocals on for the album.\n\nLyrically, it’s like a knight in shining armor or a samurai, and there's fire and there's war, and this guy's got to go find something. It was like this medieval fairytale type thing that I had in my head. Naala really helped lyrically guide me in a way that told that story, but was a little more personal and a little more vulnerable. I was about to give up on that song until she showed up in the studio.\n\n\"What About the Children\" is based on a demo that you got from Stevie Wonder. You got to duet with him, what was that collaboration like?\n\nOh, it was great. It was a life-changing experience. The guy's the greatest in everything, he was sweet, the most talented, hardworking, gracious, humble, but strong human being I've been in a room with and been able to create with.\n\nI was in shock when I left the studio at how powerful that was and how game changing and eye-opening it was. It was educational and inspiring. It was like before Stevie and after Stevie.\n\nI imagine it was also extra special getting to have your sisters on the album.\n\nAbsolutely. We got to sing with Stevie Wonder; we used to grow up listening to George Clinton. They've stuck with us throughout my whole life. So, to be able to work with him and George Clinton — they came in wanting to do the work, hardworking, badass, nice, funny — it was a dream.\n\nStevie Wonder and George Clinton are just different. They're pioneers and risk takers. For a young Black kid from Texas to see that and then later to be able to be in a room with that and get direct education and conversation…. It's an experience that not everybody gets to experience, and I'm grateful that I did, and hopefully we can do it again.\n\n*Duane Michaels*\n\nThe Last Repair Shop took four years to complete, and became deeply personal for 34-year-old Bowers, a former LAUSD student. The pianos Bowers played during his elementary and middle school education were tuned by shop supervisor Steve Bagmanyan — another of the film's subjects.\n\nBagmanyan remembers falling in love with the piano as an ethnic Armenian boy growing up in then-Soviet Republic, Azerbaijan. He fled to the U.S. with his mother in the late 1980s during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in which his father was killed.\n\nBowers says that including Bagmanyan in the film became an expression of gratitude for “someone who did directly impact me.”\n\n“I was able to say thank you,” recalls L.A.-born Bowers. “It was very special.”\n\nThe end result of the restorative work provided by Bagmanyan and the other shop technicians has a more far-reaching effect, according to Proudfoot. \"Learning how to play a musical instrument has a profound impact on who you are that makes not just good musicians, but good citizens,\" he says.\n\nBowers also spent about 45 minutes interviewing student musicians, each of whom details what their instrument means to them.\n\nIsmerai Calcaneo talks about how music \"changed\" her life when she started playing saxophone in school at the age of 9. The instrument helped her \"be more disciplined.\"\n\n\"I have to be on time, I have to practice, I have to look good — it helps me focus more,\" she says in the film. \"When I am feeling tense, when I’m feeling sad or angry, the saxophone calms me down.\"\n\nFor Amanda Nova, playing the piano before an audience is a source of empowerment and a way to reduce stress. \"I’m scared that I might not find a purpose in life,\" she says. \"But once I’m on stage, all that tension goes away.\"\n\nBowers hopes that the stories in The Last Repair Shop shine a light on \"how much music education can do beyond create incredible musicians.\" He tells GRAMMY.com that being in a school jazz band had a significant impact on his life.\n\n\"Listening in the jazz context is such a deep form of communication, and it definitely translates into how I listen in my life outside music,\" says Bowers, who directed the 2020 Oscar-nominated documentary short, A Concerto is a Conversation, with Proudfoot.\n\n\"When it comes to young people, we’re very clear on the idea of what sports can do when it comes to discipline, but not everybody wants to be an athlete,\" he says. \"If we’re able to understand the value of sports in helping them with other aspects of their lives, I really feel that the same argument can be made for music.\"\n\nProudfoot echoes Bowers’ sentiment.\n\nMusic \"teaches you how to listen, how to play in harmony and collaborate,\" he says, adding that, hopefully, the experience \"provides you with a reasonable example of having discipline and learning how to conquer a complex thing, which is a useful skill in life.\"\n\nBoth Bowers and Proudfoot hope the film inspires people to invest in music education.\n\nTheir film certainly seemed to strike a chord. On Feb. 20, the LAUSD Education Foundation launched a $15-million capital campaign called The Last Repair Shop Fund to support the restoration operation.\n\nAs the final moments of The Last Repair Shop, an orchestra featuring LAUSD alumni and current students perform a piece composed over a weekend by Bowers, who also penned the score for the movie-musical, The Color Purple, which was shortlisted for best score at this year’s Academy Awards). The scene sweetly threads the impact of music education on youth and adults.\n\nThe dedicated technicians toiling away in a nondescript shop also have high hopes for the musicians whose instruments they care for.\n\n“In a way, you can feel like you’re fixing an instrument for a future GRAMMY winner,” says Michaels. “If you want to kind of dream a little bit.\"\n\nVirginia's Annie Ray To Be Honored With 2024 Music Educator Award\n\nWhile East Coast rap was heavily influenced by musical stylings of immigrants from the Caribbean with notes of funk and soul, rap in the Dirty South took inspiration from blues and gospel — genres birthed from hymns and psalms sung in the fields and plantations. The Dirty South brought their ancestors with them. Their rap style and delivery had an inherent country twang, an accent reminiscent of a period lost to time yet modern; its incorporation of rock 'n' roll, jazz, and funk embodied a contemporary Southern spirit.\n\nIf the introduction of West Coast rap struck fear in the East Coast, the South was a laughing stock, until the South started to sell in the early to mid 2000s. Some critics attribute the ascension of Southern hip-hop to the fatigue of the East vs. West Coast rivalry. Others say hip-hop was in need of a new start after the early passings of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. Whether both claims are true or false, the Dirty South was the future.\n\nNotable Southern Hip-Hop Artists & Labels\n\nAtlanta: The epicenter of the Dirty South. In the early 1980s, Atlanta' hip-hop started to get its foothold with airplay on local radio stations, artists being signed to Miami-based record labels, and early success on the music charts and the GRAMMYs. Rapper Mo-Jo, club DJ King Edward J, and Peter \"MC Shy D\" Jones were among the first in the city’s hip-hop community. At the time Jones was signed to Luke Records, a Miami based record label started by Luke Campbell of the 2 Live Crew. The hyper localized scene benefited from the contributions of club DJs Kizzy Rock and DJ Smurf, who shifted Atlanta’s sound from a Miami bass derivative into a distinctive sound.\n\nFrom the mid 1980s, a number of local record labels emerged: Ichiban Records and Wrap Records. However when Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds moved to Atlanta in 1989, the local hip-hop scene changed. In the 1990s, their LaFace Records signed Goodie Mob, Outkast, producers Organized Noize, TLC, Usher, Xscape and others. Meanwhile, Jermaine Dupri founded So So Def record label. Under the direction of Lil Jon, the label’s A&R, the label signed Xscape, Da Brat, Jagged Edge, and more acts aligned with the R&B/hip-hop sound. As the signees of LaFace and So So Def Records triumphed, Def Jam Records hired Scarface of the Geto Boys to lead their Southern division, Def Jam South, which signed Ludacris.\n\nAs a solo artist Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz released \"We Still Crunk Up!,\"\"Put Yo Hood Up,\"\"Kings of Crunk,\" and \"Crunk Juice,\" a series of albums credited with bringing crunk into the mainstream. The popularity of crunk and dance music was heralded by Crime Mob, D4L, Dem Franchise Boyz, Soulja Boy and more who gave Atlanta hip-hop prominence not only in music but Internet culture.\n\nNew Orleans: In the aftermath of bounce music’s expansion in the early 1990s, Parkway Pumpkin’ Records was the holding place of New Orleans’ talent. Mystikal, known then as Mystikal Mike, was one of the label’s early signees. Along with Magnolia Slim, an architect of the New Orleans hip-hop sound. At the time, Parkway Pumpkin were free to record with other labels like Big Boy Records. When Master P moved back home from the Bay Area, his No Limit Records existed alongside local independent record labels like Cash Money, Take Fo’, Tombstone and Untouchable.\n\nIn a strategic business move, No Limit Records took Mystikal, Soulja Slim (formerly known as Magnolia Slim), and producer KLC from Parkway Pumpkin. As well as the signing of his family members C-Murder, Silkk the Shocker, Master P signed Mia X, the first lady of No Limit Records to the label. KLC, known as Craig S. Lawson, formed Beats by the Pound, the production behind No Limit Records. One of his first productions, Down South Hustlers, a compilation tape that featured New Orleans' first rap group New York Incorporated, signified No Limit Records attempt to exemplify Dirty South culture. Although No Limit Records secured a major label investment in 1996, Cash Money Records emerged in 1998 as a challenger with their new signees of Juvenile, Big Tymers, Hot Boys, and Lil Wayne with production by Mannie Fresh.\n\nMemphis: At Club No Name, the first club in Memphis to play hip-hop, DJ Spanish Fly originated as one of the first creators to bring Memphis rap into shape. Although the patrons’ preference skewed towards electro, DJ Fly would incorporate his own preferences into mixes at Club No Name, Club Expo, and the Crystal Palace Skating Rink. His mixes maintained an ominous groove that included notes of electro but made room for moody rap. Though DJ Spanish Fly was among the first to evolve Memphis rap, DJ Squeeky defined the city’s sound with the insertion of a SP-1200 and Roland keyboard.\n\nHis influence can be heard in early mixtapes from DJ Paul and Juicy J. DJ Paul and Lord Infamous, his half brother formed the Serial Killaz. When the duo met with Juicy J, the three formed The Backyard Posse. Over time, the group added Koopsta Knicca, Crunchy Black, and Gangsta Boo. The six person group was renamed Three 6 Mafia and released their first album, Mystic Stylez under Prophet Records. Mystic Stylez also featured the female rapper La Chat and Project Pat, the brother of Juicy J. Shortly after their deal, the group parted ways with Prophet and formed their own label Hypnotize Minds. La Chat also released \"Murder She Spoke,\" her debut album on the record label.\n\nUnder the direction of DJ Paul and Juicy J, the rappers under the Hypnotize Minds label achieved commercial and critical success, as well as an Academy Award for It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" for Hustle & Flow, a drama set in Memphis that follows DJay (played by Terrence Howard), a pimp and drug dealer with aspirations of becoming a rapper.\n\nMiami: Before hip-hop migrated down from New York, Miami already had a DJ style. In Miami, the DJs would be \"regulating\": or \"mic checkin','' where the DJ brought down the record for a short period of time and insert their own lyrics to remix the song in a similar fashion to reggae and dancehall DJs. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, DJs would travel with their generators, turntables, speakers, and equipment to perform in public and private spaces across the city.\n\nAs local DJs put their spin on hip-hop, the city’s rappers energetic sound which came to be known as Miami bass, a diasporic influenced heavy bass sound that contained elements of electro and synthesizers were heard in the music of the Gucci Crew, Clay D, MC A.D.E., and the 2 Live Crew. The 2 Live Crewwas the first to bring the Miami bass sound to the mainstream. The group released their albums under then Skyywalker Records (now Luke Records), member Luther Campbell’s record label. Their success came at a cost. The sexually explicit nature of their lyrics resulted in a federal court obscenity trial, which established the precedent for censorship in music.\n\nIn the mid to late 1990s, Slip-n-Slide Records, a label founded by Ted Lucas, signed Trick Daddy, a Liberty City resident who thematically used the language of gangsta rap to speak about the struggles and challenges of living in a disenfranchised area. However, it was Trina who joined Trick Daddy on \"Nann N—a,\" who put the city, its women, and women across the Dirty South with her as refuted Trick Daddy on his own track. \"Da Baddest Bitch,\" her debut album released on Slip N Slide label put her in conversation with Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown as a contender for the Queen of hip-hop title.\n\nSubgenres Of Southern Hip-Hop\n\nFor the past two decades, the Dirty South has been responsible for hip-hop’s expansion and evolution. The region has conducted a variety of sonic experiments and melodic sounds to produce an expansive lexicon that represents the conflict, tension, and joy about being Black in the South.\n\nSouthern hip-hop does not shy away from the underground, but rather embraces it. The music in itself is a contradiction: A track used for shaking ass at the strip clubs, while patrons eat chicken wings, can originate from a gospel beat. Because to be Black in the South, where your ancestors were once enslaved, is disorienting.\n\nBounce music: New Orleans has a vast musical history and structure: The chanting of the Mardi Gras Indians, the brass of the second line bands, and the expressiveness of parade culture cultivated a music of lively and celebration. When hip-hop arrived, it incorporated notes of the existing styles into a call-and-response formula over a series of rhythmic beats which invoked attendees into dance. Originating in the city's housing projects, this new style of bounce music took a new life in the city’s nightlife. Folks felt called to participate in the chanting, the hyper-localized lyrics, and high energy drum patterns familiar to second line culture. Although Big Freedia, is known as the Queen of Bounce Music, and rightfully so. The musician got their start working with Katey Red, \"the first trans woman bounce artist.\"\n\nBuck music: Within Memphis’ skating rinks and club cultures a dance music that ricocheted through the body, was born. Local DJs reinterpreted samples of soul and funk music, keyboard melodies of the Black church, with distinctive time signatures and cadences, on top of electronic-focused bass to give rise to a lexicon of dance styles including jookin’ and stomping. The heavy bass music stylings of Memphis also gave birth to trap and crunk, two styles most associated with Atlanta.\n\nCrunk music: What would crunk music be without its patron saint Lil Jon? Although the rapper-producer cannot lay claim to the origins of the musical style, in the early 2000s, Lil Jon & the Eastside Boyz brought crunk to popular culture. Known for its party-centered lyrics and uptempo rhythms, crunk music became synonymous with Atlanta’s club and strip culture. The shouting, the energetic call and response, the chanting; crunk became the loud, bold, vocal expression of the city’s youth and music culture. To be crunk was to be excited.\n\nSnap music: Snap music, an Atlanta-based form of hip-hop, was ushered in by the rise of handheld technology and social media sites like YouTube in the early 2000s. In lieu of a snare or clap, a snap was inserted as a replacement, often complemented by a whistle. The songs, which shared components of crunk, were exemplified by an accompanying dance and uploaded to social media sites (in much the same way Gen Z does on TikTok).\n\nMiami bass: Miami, the city of two Souths. One foot in the Southern United States, the other in the geographical South. The demographic, geographic, and cultural mix of Cuban and Haitian, as well as Southern Blackness, produced an eccentric style of hip-hop. Elongated bass built on layered rhythmic production, and short, repetitive phrases ushered in a shout and response style became hallmarks of Miami bass. Played around 125 beats per minute, the style flourished in Miami’s car scene as well as party and adult entertainment culture.\n\nTrap music: If crunk and snap music were symbols of the jovial Atlanta, then trap emerged as a symbol of the city and Black America’s underground. In a nation where Black communities experienced the onslaught of War on Drugs policies and excessive policing, the only way towards economic freedom was to hustle, and the hymn of the hustle and struggle was trap. Embedded with the dark lyrical content, multilayered kick drums, hi hats and synthesized drums was the moodiness of the duffle bag boy trying to survive. Over time, a holy trinity of the Roland TR-808, snare rolls, and first hand experience gave birth to a style where dope boys could be referred to as kings.\n\nDefinitive Southern Hip-Hop Songs\n\nThree 6 Mafia - \"Tear Da Club Up '97\" (1997): The conveying of electric bodies in movement can result in one of two ways. The first, a baby. The second, an ass whooping. The club is also a multifaceted place where you can meet the love of your life or the person (or people) who have been \"talkin' that s—,\" as Three 6 Mafia say. This is the environment where \"Tear Da Club Up\" resides.\n\nThe song serves as a call to action. On a good night, the song is a declaration of celebration. On a bad night, an ominous premonition of what’s to come. \"Tear Da Club Up\" was banned in 17 states, but established the precedent for crunk anthems like \"Knuck If You Buck,\" and the movement of club-esque songs that served a dual purpose for fighting.\n\n\"Tear Da Club Up\" remains a reminder of what a night out looks like with Three 6 Mafia."
