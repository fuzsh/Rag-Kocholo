        "text": "Rhythm Nation: how music gives Haiti hope amid the chaos Poverty, violence, political chaos and devastating natural disasters have defined Haiti for a long time, obscuring anything else about Haiti, its culture and its people. Among the mayhem, Haitians are still living their lives, creating music and visual art as an outlet and a symbol of hope. For decades Haiti‚Äôs population and its diaspora in North America (such as C√©cile McLorin Salvant, pictured above) have been extraordinarily creative in all kinds of mediums: from the 80s with Jean-Michel Basquiat, whose father was Haitian, to artists today like Myrlande Constant and Frantz Zephirin who are producing impressive and exciting canvases. And it‚Äôs not just individual artists: the deep history of rich cultural exports can be heard in 1940s jazz from New Orleans and modern avant garde music. Speaking of the influence of traditional Haitian rhythms have had on his art, Haitian-Canadian saxophonist Jowee Omicil says: ‚ÄúAll the ceremonial rhythms I use have a deep meaning. In Haiti, slaves came from Guinea, Togo, Congo and Benin ‚Ä¶ they came with their rhythms. They had to unite and fight for their heritage. The sounds of freedom are what people were afraid of. They are sacred for us.‚Äù \"If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it,..\" ‚Äî Twelfth Night Act 1 Scene 1 | Shakespeare #Creativity #music #artcommunity #rythm #culturematters #heritage #mindovermatter\n\nMusic is the art most intimately connected to time. Indeed, it serves as a time machine for the transmission of culture, collective memory, concepts, mental states and feelings. But music has other purposes as well. It has a long history of being used as a strong tool for soft power. Music can also be used as a means of propaganda or to enhance the influence of propaganda. Since political speeches are heavy and sometimes tedious, music, with its entertaining elements, serves as a supplement to make the messages easier to convey. How does Russia weaponise music in its war in Ukraine? How does the Russian government attempt to reshape the sentiment in the society? What are the major themes of the songs released after February 2022? Find out more in the article by Tatevik Hovhannisyan in our latest issue 'The Western Balkans. A Bridge from Europe to Europe?' https://lnkd.in/dEbH58RP\n\nIn some uplifting news to restore a little faith in humanity: Legendary Radiohead lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood has released this statement on collaboration with Israeli artist Dudu Tassa. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing festivals in Europe this summer with Dudu Tassa and the Kuwaitis. Some people are asking me why. I‚Äôve been collaborating with Dudu and releasing music with him since 2008 ‚Äì and working privately long before that. I think an artistic project that combines Arab and Jewish musicians is worthwhile. And one that reminds everyone that the Jewish cultural roots in countries like Iraq and Yemen go back for thousands of years, is also important. For all that, whenever you call an artistic endeavour ‚Äòimportant‚Äô it ascribes an earnestness to the whole thing. Really, it‚Äôs just musicians from all over the Middle East having mutual respect for each other, working together across borders, and sharing our love for the long catalogue of Arabic songs ‚Äì whether they were written by Muslim, Jewish or Christian composers. (Perhaps the most famous Iraqi composer was Dudu‚Äôs grandfather, who was one of the legendary Al Kuwaity brothers, and who‚Äôs songs are still staples of Arab-wide radio stations though sadly their heritage as Jews is never mentioned any longer). Others choose to believe this kind of project is unjustifiable, and are urging the silencing of this or any artistic effort made by Israeli Jews. But I can‚Äôt join that call: the silencing of Israeli film makers / musicians / dancers when their work tours abroad ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs at the urging of their fellow western film makers/musicians/artists feels unprogressive to me. Not least because it‚Äôs these people that are invariably the most progressive members of any society. I‚Äôm grateful to be working the remarkable musicians I‚Äôve met during this project, all of whom strike me as much braver ‚Äì and taking far more of a principled risk than those who are trying to shut us down, or who are now attempting to ascribe a sinister ulterior motivation to the band‚Äôs existence. There isn‚Äôt one: we are musicians honouring a shared culture, and I‚Äôve been involved in this for nearly 20 years now. Anyway, no art is as ‚Äòimportant‚Äô as stopping all the death and suffering around us. How can it be? But doing nothing seems a worse option. And silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn‚Äôt seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict. So: that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm making music with this band. You‚Äôre welcome to disagree with, or ignore, what we do but I hope you now understand what the true motivation is, and can react to the music without suspicion or hate.‚Äù I will be listening to OK Computer for the twenty millionth time today.

Recent #criminalcases involving artists from the \"Trinibad\" music genre underscore the connection between the music industry and crime in #TrinidadandTobago. Over the past 18 months, several Trinibad singers have faced prosecution for their alleged involvement in #criminalactivities. Trinibad, a variant of Jamaican dancehall originating in Trinidad and Tobago, often features lyrics and imagery related to #gangs and #firearms. In the most recent case on February 2, singer Kashif Sankar, also known as \"Kman 6ixx,\" was charged by police with possession of #ammunition and declaring gang membership, offenses under the country's Anti-Gang Act 4, 2021. Consequently, authorities in #StKitts and #Nevis prohibited Sankar from performing in their country, citing concerns that his music could pose security threats due to its explicit endorsement of #violence and glorification of gang life. Earlier instances include the April 2023 arrest of singer Prince Swanny for suspected gang affiliations, resulting in the cancellation of his concert in #Dominica, and the November 2022 arrest of Shakeem Griffith, known as \"Zoom Boss\", on murder and weapons-related charges. Experts argue that musical genres like Trinibad contribute to Trinidad and Tobago's violence by glamorizing #revenge and #murder, potentially desensitizing listeners to aggression. The country saw a record high of 601 homicides in 2022, with Trinibad cited as a factor. While the murder rate decreased in 2023 to 576, Trinibad's influence remained significant. Although some believe music can positively impact communities by deterring gang involvement, challenges such as the influx of #illegalweapons, gang fragmentation, and limited non-violent conflict resolution mechanisms persist in addressing Trinidad and Tobago's violence issue.\n\nWeekend Doses : Some specific facts about the song \"Can't Help Falling in Love\": Songwriting Team: The song was written by Hugo Peretti, Luigi Creatore, and George David Weiss, a prolific songwriting trio.
