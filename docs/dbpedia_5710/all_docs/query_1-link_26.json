        "text": "Pop-punk is as big as its ever been. The nostalgia train is running at full speed. Festivals around the globe such as When We Were Young and Riot Fest are just a couple examples that there is a demand for these bands. If you grew up going to Warped Tour or Tower Records then there’s no doubt that many of these bands ignite certain memories and feelings. I’ve assembled 50* albums that I feel are essential for Pop-punk and Emo rock fans. In order to minimize the ambiguity of all the sub genres and debates of what qualifies, I only counted albums that are marked on Wikipedia with either a pop-punk or Emo genre label. So don’t lose your mind if a Descendents or Ramones record doesn’t pop up that you live for.\n\n50. The Starting Line — Say It Like You Mean It (2002)\n\nExcellent debut record by the Pennsylvania band. Up and Go embodies all that is Pop-punk and lights off a firecracker when you press play. It’s hard to ignore The Best of Me, which is an essential song for many reasons. You’re guaranteed a good time with sweet anthems like A Goodnight’s Sleep.\n\n49. Lifetime — Jersey’s Best Dancers (1997)\n\nWithout Lifetime there would be no Taking Back Sunday or Fall Out Boy. New Jersey is a quintessential region for this angst movement. 25 Cent Giraffes is a kick to the teeth. The entire record is a high speed chase down the 405 with a run time of just 23 minutes and 17 seconds. Give Young, Loud, and Scotty a listen, and you’ll understand the appeal.\n\n48. State Champs — The Finer Things (2013)\n\nYou’re an idiot if you think Pop-punk died in 2010. State Champs prove there’s still a lot to celebrate. It’s hard to believe this is a debut record because the band sounds as polished as a 10-year vet. Elevated is the first song to introduce a great band to the universe, and maybe the strongest track on the LP. Each song is pretty special, and the energy is fluid throughout as showcased in songs such as Nothing’s Wrong.\n\n47. Dashboard Confessional — Dusk and Summer (2006)\n\nDusk and Summer cemented this band from good to great. The band’s fourth record exemplifies the true range that front man and writer Chris Carrabba possesses. Vindicated belongs in a Hall of Fame of rock songs, while Stolen contains a mood that will rip you to shreds emotionally. A song like Currents embodies the range of Emo and passion.\n\n46. Something Corporate — Leaving Through the Window (2002)\n\nI Want To Save You is everything pop-punk. The party really begins with Punk Rock Princess with guitar melodies and a chorus that will get you jumping up and down. Just when you think you know the direction of the album, I Woke Up In A Car shifts so hard to the left that you can’t help but blast the stereo to max volume. Thank you Santa Monica.\n\n45. American Hi-Fi — American Hi-Fi (2001)\n\nA debut album that once got people buzzing. Flavor Of The Weak once was an anthem sung at every karaoke bar. Truly a generational song with the catchiest of choruses. American Hi-Fi do an excellent job of delivering the hooks that will have you singing along to every song such as with I’m A Fool.\n\n44. Neck Deep — Life’s Not out to Get You (2015)\n\nIf you haven’t listened to Neck Deep, then there’s a piece of life that you’ve been missing. The Welsh group discover their niche on their sophomore release. Can’t Kick Up the Roots delivers on all fronts. If you want to feel something, then give December a listen, and then listen to it again. A number of these songs were assisted by the legend himself, Jeremy McKinnon.\n\n43. Alkaline Trio — From Here to Infirmary (2001)\n\nWhile the trio’s 3rd album was initially divisive amongst fans, with time this album has become a staple within a pretty stacked catalogue from the Chicago band. Private Eye, Mr. Chainsaw, and Stupid Kid are all stand out songs, but Armageddon owns a nostalgic sound that you just won’t find from many bands these days as the band shows they aren’t afraid to take risks.\n\n42. The Promise Ring — Nothing Feels Good (1997)\n\nThe Promise Ring’s second album helped pave the way for Emo legends like Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids. Is This Thing On? takes you for a nice drive that leaves you begging for more. Why Did Ever We Meet owns a bass line that might as well be found in the bible for all things that define the Warped Tour sound. Red & Blue Jeans lays down a foundation for many artists to build upon.\n\n41. The Get Up Kids — Something to Write Home About (1999)\n\nA new millennium is nearly upon us, and The Get Up Kids close out the 1990s with a bang. Holiday comes screaming out of the gate, while Action & Action dictates a tone that comforts the listener into knowing this album is set up to be iconic. If you’re wondering what Emo truly sounds like then listen to the close out track I’ll Catch You and report back to me.\n\n40. Cartel — Chroma (2005)\n\nWithin the first five seconds of Say Anything (Else), I know I’m in love with this debut album. The transition into Honestly is seamless and a true Pop-punk anthem. Power chords and Will Pugh belting his lungs out like heard on Luckie St. will get you through any tense situation. What a finish by A to cap off a record filled with so much life.\n\n39. Boys Like Girls — Boys Like Girls (2005)\n\nThey’re somewhat of an underrated band that often gets overlooked, but make no mistake that Boys Like Girls cranks an anthem immediately with The Great Escape. The band demonstrates their versatility with heartfelt ballots like Thunder. Up Against The Wall is the perfect tune for adrenaline junkies that need a quick fix.\n\n38. Say Anything — …Is a Real Boy (2004)\n\nSay Anything just does things differently and god damn it works. Woe takes you through a journey to help with self-discovery. Alive with the Glory of Love is all over the place in the most beautiful way possible. Admit It!!! isn’t just a song, but a demonstration of genius. Max Bemis is a brilliant writer, and he knows how to compile a memorable LP.\n\n37. Avril Lavigne — Let Go (2002)\n\nNot often a grungy teenager with a whole lot of emotions rises to instant stardom, but every now and then you get a few and that is exactly what Avril Lavigne does. Complicated is an iconic single that peels off so many layers of emotions that every single one of us have experienced. Sk8ter Boi deserves to be on any playlist delivered to aliens on defining Pop-punk.\n\n36. Sugarcult — Start Static (2001)\n\nIf you want to talk about a great debut album that often gets overlooked, then look no further. Stuck In America is not only catchy, but something many can relate to. Bouncing Off The Walls circuits a boost of energy that will light a fire within you. The sweet sounds of Saying Goodbye only add to a record that delivers many ear candy rhythms from the Santa Barbara group.\n\n35. Saves The Day — Stay What You Are (2001)\n\nAnother iconic band synonymous with the New Jersey Emo scene. Many cite this as a massive influential album. Certain Tragedy sets the room on fire. At Your Funeral is one of the strongest album openers I’ve heard to date. Chris Conley’s vocals fuel something special here. Good luck arguing that this isn’t a phenomenal album driven by insane guitar hooks.\n\n34. The Academy Is… — Almost Here (2005)\n\nWhen the Chicago band demands your attention with Attention, you give it to them. Slow Down is everything I need and more, especially as someone who has driven through the Hollywood Hills a thousand times. If you want to get a crowd moving, just put on Checkmarks. Man, what a banger. It’s great to see many give this band their flowers.\n\n33. Motion City Soundtrack — My Dinosaur Life (2010)\n\nMaybe a hot take, but this is the best album by the Minneapolis rooted band. Worker Bee really gets this thing going on the right foot. The guitar is just so good on A Lifeless Ordinary (Need a Little Help). I don’t know how else to describe Her Words Destroyed My Planet other than it is a perfect song. I could honestly write about all the songs, but Disappear is on a mission that accomplishes what great song writing sure is. Energy levels maxed out.\n\n32. AFI — Sing the Sorrow (2003)\n\nAFI delivers a craft that simply has to earn your respect. The Leaving Song Pt. II is not only catchy, but releases some of the angriest and catchiest guitar rhythms out there. Girl’s Not Grey will be found on just about every list of best rock songs of the 2000s. As many in the past have said, AFI teaches you what masterful guitar work sounds like, as demonstrated on Dancing Through Sunday.\n\n31. Yellowcard — Ocean Avenue (2003)\n\nYellowcard was just a band, and then they released their fourth record and suddenly became a household name. Probably the only album on this list that is carried by amazing violin sounds thanks to Sean Mackin. Way Away gets this thing going. Ocean Avenue is a legendary song that you can’t escape. I have so much respect for how Back Home ends this record, and of course don’t forget about Only One if you want the feels.\n\n30. A Day to Remember — Homesick (2009)\n\nI don’t know what sparked such a powerful album, but New Found Glory’s Chad Gilbert sure helped unlock something. The Downfall of Us All is one of ADTR’s most defining tracks. The energy that I’m Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of? is peak nutsack. If It Means a Lot to You is such a daring song because it’s so different from the rest of the album, but wow what a way to close out an excellent collection of songs.\n\n29. The Maine — Lovely Little Lonely (2017)\n\nWe grew up with The Maine, and it wasn’t until their sixth full length recording that they put it all together for a complete album. Bad Behavior is so poppy but embedded with so much Emo sass. Black Butterflies and Deja Vu might be The Maine’s most impressive song because they elevate their game to new heights. The Arizona based band comes through with a ton of catchy songs like The Sound of Reverie.\n\n28. Good Charlotte — The Young and the Hopeless (2002)\n\nI never understood the Good Charlotte disrespect. The band put their heart and soul into this album that gave us so many hits like The Anthem. Meanwhile Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous & Girls & Boys are some of the most friendly sing-along songs from the 2000s. Hold On gives us such a different look at the band as they truly give us a true Emo song with importance behind it.\n\n27. Sum 41 — Does This Look Infected? (2002)\n\nAll Killer No Filler may have put Sum 41 on the map, but the band’s sophomore attempt is the Canadian’s Pop-punk band’s most complete album. The Hell Song sends chills down your spine with its electricity. Still Waiting is not just a mosh pit starter but unity for the crowd. Billy Spleen shows that Sum 41 has become professionals with their art.\n\n26. Alkaline Trio — Crimson (2005)\n\nJerry Finn helped produce something unique for Alkaline Trio’s fifth studio album. There isn’t anything else like Time To Waste. Matt Skiba takes his vocals to the next level. Mercy Me is infectious with its upbeat energy, while Burn is so dark with flashes of optimism. Then of course there’s excellent tracks like Sadie that prove this is the band’s best album to date.\n\n25. Jawbreaker — Dear You (1995)\n\nJawbreaker was hit with so much backlash when they jumped to a major record label. Dear You was a massive flop until years later that people realized they were wrong. The power behind Save Your Generation sets the tone for an incredible record. The riffs of the guitar and bass of Fireman explain why this band was super influential. Million is an Emo anthem, as is basically all of Dear You.\n\n24. Jimmy Eat World — Clarity (1999)\n\nThird time was not the charm for Jimmy Eat World. Another album that flopped, when in reality Clarity turned out to be one of the most influential Emo filled records there have been. Lucky Denver Mint captures the synergy of the band. Blister will turn any bad day upside down. Goodbye Sky Harbor is 16 minutes and miraculously works. You have to respect the band for taking risks and willing to separate themselves from the pack.\n\n23. All Time Low — Nothing Personal (2009)\n\nAll Time Low have a lot of solid albums, but Nothing Personal helped raise the band to the upper echelon. Weightless is all things Pop-punk with a chorus that will suck you in. Lost in Stereo is the ultimate party song. The entire album flows together so well, and then you hit Therapy and have no choice but to tip your cap to the group.\n\n22. The Wonder Years — The Greatest Generation (2013)\n\nDid this album make you want to start a band? Yeah, me too. There, There demonstrates that there is still territory to explore of the genre. Passing Through a Screen Door makes you feel so small and on the top of the world simultaneously. The Wonder Years put it all together for their fourth album with new vocal ranges and genius lyrics like with A Raindance in Traffic. I think what makes the Wonder Years so great is that they are true to themselves.\n\n21. Fall Out Boy — Take This to Your Grave (2003)\n\nI have no idea how this is a debut album. Fall Out Boy was barely on anyone’s radar and they absolutely killed it with this record. This LP is all things Pop-punk and Emo. Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy truly taps into the talent and potential of this band. Saturday has enough fuel to carry a gas station. The band does an excellent job of spinning their Illinois roots into relatable jams. Homesick at Space Camp carries out the energy that Fall Out Boy owns.\n\n20. The All-American Rejects — The All-American Rejects (2002)\n\nMy Paper Heart is a fun and catchy song to start off the band’s debut album. Swing, Swing is the single that will suck you in because its organ adds such a unique element followed by a contagious chorus. There’s a few songs that you could argue are Pop-punk classics. I love the way The Last Song finishes off an excellent debut album by a band that is only getting started.\n\n19. Taking Back Sunday — Tell All Your Friends (2002)\n\nNew York should be proud of Taking Back Sunday. When you have Cute Without the ‘E’ (Cut from the Team) as the most identified track from this album, it’s hard to exclude the record from any list. You’re So Last Summer characterizes catchy power chords and churns it into an Emo anthem. There’s No ‘I’ in Team owns some of the most insane lyrics that feeds into one of rock’s best rivalries.\n\n18. Jimmy Eat World — Futures (2004)\n\nI’m not really sure how this album often gets snubbed from conversations, but this album has everything. Pain owns a catchy chorus and awesome guitar solo. Work is led by lyrics that reflect every day life and make it easy for any band to relate to the band. 23 might just be the best song that Jimmy Eat World has ever written. This album only continues the momentum of one of the early Millennium’s best bands.\n\n17. Paramore — Riot! (2007)\n\nIt didn't matter how young the band members of Paramore were because their sophomore album melts your face off and sets up what grow into a dynasty. That’s What You Get is some of the best guitar work in this entire sub genre. Misery Business is the era defining song for so many individuals. Crushcrushcrush is another 1000 degree song, but Paramore shows off their range with more light hearted songs like When It Rains.\n\n16. Brand New — Deja Entendu (2003)\n\nThis is the record that captures all the talent of Brand New. Songs like Sic Transit Gloria… Glory Fades take you from a nice neighborhood stroll to a 100 MPH high speed chase all within one song. The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows is the band’s best song ever written. Guernica is just another example of Brand New taking their skills to new heights. One of the most dynamic records you’ll ever hear.\n\n15. The All-American Rejects — Move Along (2005)\n\nThe band locked themselves in as one of the titans of Pop-punk with hits like Dirty Little Secret and Move Along. It Ends Tonight explores new boundaries that Tyson Ritter shows off with his vocals. Dance Inside is another sweet sounding song that polishes off an album that defines middle school and high school for many millennials. There was a point where this band was at the top by headlining Warped Tours.\n\n14. Fall Out Boy — From Under the Cork Tree (2005)\n\nThis album turned Fall Out Boy into stars within months. Sugar, We’re Going Down shines bright on a record filled with so many jams. Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year generates the formula for a successful teenage angst soundtrack. A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More “Touch Me” is fun and helps carry on a sophomore album filled with so much meaning and fire. Fall Out Boy went from club shows to filling arenas.\n\n13. Buzzcocks — Singles Going Steady (1979)\n\nBuzzcocks were ahead of their time. The English band changed the dynamic of punk music by dropping dimes like What Do I Get? The tempo set throughout this album shouldn’t surprise anyone with its level of influence. I Don’t Mind owns excellent chord progressions, which is a steady theme throughout the record. Harmony in My Head will suck you right in.\n\n12. The Offspring — Smash (1994)\n\nThe Offspring were one of the bands that helped people get over Grunge and back into Punk. Gotta Get Away sends the listener on a smooth sailing boat ride of Punk rock goodness. Self Esteem is pretty self-explanatory as to why it’s an era defining song of the 1990s. Come Out and Play drops hooks and riffs that can’t be escaped as they draw you in immediately. The Offspring helped define the 1990s.\n\n11. Blink-182 — Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001)\n\nThe Rock Show and First Date are Warped Tour staples. Stay Together for the Kids is one of the most daring Blink-182 songs. Reckless Abandon allows Tom DeLonge to do what he does best. The trio continued to show that they were able to still have fun, while becoming one of the biggest bands in the world. Each song on the album contains unique elements, while really doing nothing flashy at all.\n\n10. Taking Back Sunday — Where You Want to Be (2004)\n\nVery rarely does a band lose key members and get better, but that’s exactly what happened with Taking Back Sunday. With their second album, they helped commercialize Emo music. A Decade Under the Influence has it all from the lyrics to the guitar riffs to the fueled passion. This Photograph Is Proof (I Know You Know) goes down a completely different path that holds it own. Each track has you begging for more with a grand finale of …Slowdance on the Inside.\n\n9. Paramore — Brand New Eyes (2009)\n\nHayley Williams and Josh Farro put forth the best Paramore album to date. Playing God is a juggernaut of a song, while Ignorance comes out swinging with attitude. The Only Exception is a vibe that gels all people together. All I Wanted is the close out song that ends this album on the most climatic note. Paramore solidified themselves as one of the world’s best bands showing off a wide range and versality.\n\n8. My Chemical Romance — The Black Parade (2006)\n\nThe Black Parade made Emo cool. My Chemical Romance created a concept album that turned the band into a global sensation. You don’t get much more Emo than Dead! Welcome to the Black Parade is the song that made black makeup and gothic clothes the in style. There are a number of stand out songs that could be in anyone’s topic ten Emo hits. Famous Last Words is a blood bath grand exit to an iconic masterpiece. A song like Mama is so spooky but works.\n\n7. Jimmy Eat World — Bleed American (2001)\n\nImagine being dropped by a label only to get a second chance elsewhere. That’s what happened to Jimmy Eat World and the end result was Bleed American. Everyone knows The Middle, which was probably the most popular rock song of the year. Sweetness encompasses all things Pop-punk. A Praise Chorus is an ode to many great songs that were its predecessor. Even songs like The Authority Song strum its way through an avid karaoke goer’s dreams.\n\n6. My Chemical Romance — Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (2004)\n\nMy Chemical Romance embraced the social media movement and became the focal point of the New Jersey rock scene. It was over after people heard I‘m Not Okay (I Promise). From that point forward, the band dropped massive single after single featuring Helena and The Ghost of You. There are some deep cuts like It’s Not a Fashion Statement, It’s a Fucking Deathwish that demonstrate that this band was not messing around. No one should be surprised they continue to headline festivals after reuniting.\n\n5. Blink-182 — Untitled (2003)\n\nThis might be the most complete record that Blink-182 ever released. There are hard hitting songs like Feeling This, but there are also more melodic ground breaking songs like I Miss You. Some of Travis Barker’s best drumming can be found on Always, while Mark Hoppus delivers insane bass beats through tracks such as Obvious. By now the band was at its peak and make no mistake that this album was a large influence for many.\n\n4B. Weezer — Pinkerton (1996)\n\nWeezer entered a realm that nobody was prepared for. Hit with immediate backlash, Weezer went backwards until years later it was realized that Pinkerton was more than just odd, it was brilliant. Songs like The Good Life are for the everyday common person but embroiled with so much depth. Pink Triangle takes you to a place that unites comfort and awkwardness. The album dives into so many emotions that people shouldn’t avoid. Just listen to “Why Bother?”\n\n4A. Weezer — Weezer (Blue Album) (1994)\n\nWeezer released one of the most impressive debut albums that the world has ever gotten to listen to. My Name Is Jonas hits you hard out of the gate. Buddy Holly is a completely different vibe than the Grunge era that was previously dominating the 1990s. Say It Ain’t So is as Emo as they come. Only in Dreams will wreck you in the end. Weezer became a band that blew up quickly and deserve consideration in the Hall of Fame.\n\n3. Green Day — American Idiot (2004)\n\n10 years after the release of Dookie, Green Day did some self-discovery and released one of the best concept records ever. It’s no surprise that the themes throughout the album resulted in success for the Bay Area band. Green Day managed to release a number of staples features in every live show like Holiday and turned the album into a on-stage musical. The toughest question for many is probably narrowing it down to your favorite song of this album. Wake Me Up When September Ends still gets brought up every year. Boulevard of Broken Dreams was the rock music video of the year for good reasons.\n\n2. Blink-182 — Enema of the State (1999)\n\nEnema of the State paved the way for so many great bands to follow. The band showed that they can be completely unserious, yet release some of the best rock music of its era. What’s My Age Again? dominated airwaves, while All the Small Things is the ultimate party anthem. Songs like Aliens Exist proved that Blink-182 can be true to themselves and an outlet for millions of fans. When talking about Pop-punk and Emo, this will always be one of the first albums brought into the discussion.\n\n1. Green Day — Dookie (1994)\n\nGreen Day was too big to be independent. After Green Day dropped Dookie, the music industry was completely changed. Grunge was dead, and record labels were looking for their next darling. Basket Case dominated the radio airwaves. Green Day didn’t feel like celebrities, but rather good friends who channeled a voice of a collection of disgruntled people. Longview and Welcome to Paradise are simplistic in their composition, yet some of the best rock songs to ever be released. Green Day’s success opened the door for many other rock bands to receive an opportunity."
