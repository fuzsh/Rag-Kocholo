        "text": "One of the most widely used storytelling conventions in action films is the hero's journey, a structure that follows the protagonist's transformation from an ordinary person to a heroic figure. The hero's journey consists of several stages, such as the call to adventure, the mentor, the ordeal, the reward, and the return. These stages help the hero overcome challenges, learn new skills, face their fears, and achieve their goals. The hero's journey also creates a clear arc for the character, as they grow, change, and learn from their experiences.\n\nThis trope has also been reconstructed to prop up the converse \"Anti-Hero\"-- a protagonist who might have been considered a villain had the narrative not been engineered for the audience's sympathy to sit within \"grey\" morality.\n\nAnother common storytelling convention in action films is the three-act structure, a framework that divides the plot into three parts: the setup, the confrontation, and the resolution. The setup introduces the main characters, the setting, and the conflict. The confrontation escalates the conflict, raises the stakes, and tests the hero. The resolution resolves the conflict, shows the consequences, and delivers the climax. The three-act structure helps the filmmakers create a coherent and compelling story, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n\nLet us remember that the Three-Act Structure is a Western (American) convention that is descended from Greco-Roman philosophies on storytelling. Other global cinema traditions, including Action flicks, often take on other structures more culturally tied to the region. If you look at martial arts films from East Asia (such as the Jet Li film \"HERO\") you can see stark differences between their structures and what we have come to expect from American Action-genre fare.\n\nA MacGuffin is a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock to describe an object or a goal that motivates the characters and drives the plot, but is not important in itself. For example, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the MacGuffin is the Ark of the Covenant, which both the hero and the villain want to find and use. The MacGuffin serves as a catalyst for the action, as it creates conflict, suspense, and intrigue. However, the MacGuffin is not the main focus of the story, as it is ultimately irrelevant to the hero's journey and the theme.\n\nA sidekick is a secondary character who accompanies and supports the hero in their adventure. The sidekick often provides comic relief, emotional support, or practical assistance to the hero. For example, in Lethal Weapon, the sidekick is Roger Murtaugh, a veteran cop who partners with Martin Riggs, a reckless and suicidal cop. The sidekick helps the hero cope with their flaws, overcome their obstacles, and achieve their objectives. The sidekick also creates contrast, chemistry, and conflict with the hero, making their relationship more dynamic and interesting.\n\nA villain is a character who opposes and challenges the hero, creating the main source of conflict and tension in the story. The villain often represents the opposite values, beliefs, or goals of the hero, creating a moral and ideological clash. For example, in Die Hard, the villain is Hans Gruber, a ruthless and cunning terrorist who takes over a skyscraper and holds hostages, while the hero is John McClane, a brave and resourceful cop who tries to stop him. The villain tests the hero's strength, courage, and intelligence, forcing them to overcome their weaknesses and prove their worth.\n\nA set piece is a term used to describe a large-scale, elaborate, or spectacular action sequence that showcases the film's technical and creative skills. A set piece often involves high stakes, high risks, and high rewards, as the hero faces a major obstacle or a turning point in the story. For example, in The Matrix, the set piece is the lobby shootout, where Neo and Trinity fight their way through a horde of agents and security guards, using guns, martial arts, and bullet time effects. A set piece creates excitement, spectacle, and emotion, as it immerses the audience in the action and the story.\n\nAction films that center around an ensemble, such as the \"FAST & THE FURIOUS\" franchise, take more liberties with some of these motifs. For example, in the \"FAST\" series-- the secondary characters tend to grow with the overarching narrative. So it's hard to reduce any of them to \"The Sidekick.\" As well, many of these characters will take turns sharing the spotlight with their own central arcs. This often requires a subversion of the traditional HERO'S JOURNEY structure to service multiple fan favorites."
