        "text": "I am 14 years-old, coming back from a long day at school. It’s the spring of 2012. My walk home is rather short, but I tend to choose the longest path to clear out my head.\n\nToday has been a particularly difficult day: ‘you’re fat and ugly’, ‘you’re a mermaid! Half human, half whale’ — Kids will be kids, right? But one’s never prepared to hear such things, especially at such a young age. I plug my earphones and take the gentle breeze in\n\nHayley Williams, Paramore‘s lead singer, sings:\n\nWell now I’m told that this is life\n\nAnd pain is just a simple compromise\n\nSo we can get what we want out of it\n\nWould someone care to classify,\n\nOur broken hearts and twisted minds\n\nSo I can find someone to rely on\n\nAnd run\n\nTo them, to them\n\nFull speed ahead\n\nOh you are not, useless\n\nMisguided Ghosts – Paramore\n\nFor a moment, I believe them. I feel I am not as worthless as everyone at school made me think I was. I believe I can dig me out of this black hole I currently find myself in. In a way, I know I am not as alone as I think I am. Music was my refuge during a difficult period of my life. I have always battled with my mental health, but as a teenager, the walls of my bedroom shrank, and hopelessness knocked on my door.\n\nWhen I was 13, I started developing depression and anxiety. Finding who I was as a teenager was harder than I expected and my headspace got greyer and greyer as time went by. By that time, I discovered emo/pop-punk music. From Paramore to My Chemical Romance, to You Me At Six and Panic! At the Disco, amongst many others.\n\nThese bands reached me in a way no-one had ever done before. They made me feel understood and accompanied. Their lyrics conveyed the words I was unable to express and going through hardships became slightly easier.\n\n[pullquote align=”right”]“Without the messages those songs brought, I don’t know if I would be where I am today. I owe a lot of my strength to the genre.”[/pullquote]\n\nAlthough all the bands I have mentioned impacted me in some way, Paramore was the one that resonated with me the most. A female-fronted band in which all members were unapologetically themselves, singing and playing songs about the struggles of adolescence from a feminine perspective? I was hooked.\n\nOnline, I found a group of people that enjoyed Paramore as much as I did and, at a distance, we spoke to each other about our feelings, our hopes and our dreams. We created a rather solid community, and I looked up to get home fast enough to share what happened throughout my days.\n\nI’ve pretty much lost contact with the majority of the people I used to interact with online, however, the sense of community that was born out of a collective appreciation for a band was a solid anchor at a time of extreme self-doubt.\n\nOne’s emo ‘phase’ is usually the laughing stock of parties and numerous social gatherings. And yes, remembering some aspects of it still makes me cringe with embarrassment, but I wouldn’t change the way the genre shaped me during my formative years for anything in the world.\n\nThere isn’t a right timestamp regarding the origins of emo. However, the most common answer is that it originated in Washington DC in the ’80s. According to a piece by NME, the genre stemmed from the 1980’s hardcore-punk scene, and it’s frequently traced back to the band Rites of Spring.\n\nRites of Spring are often called the ‘fathers of emo’, due to their personal and meta lyricism. The genre went through a plentiful amount of changes, and it is considered to have had three waves.\n\nNonetheless, it wasn’t until the 2000s that emo exploded and became more than a genre. By that time, Pop-Punk and emo became “inexorably intertwined”, and bands such as Jimmy Eat World and Brand New mingled their personal lyricism with punk melodies that had a more mainstream structure. In the mid-2000s, with the aid of Myspace, Emo transformed into something much bigger than a music genre — it became a counter-culture.\n\nParamore, Panic! At the Disco and My Chemical Romance became the propellers of the ‘movement’. As far as the ’emo look’ was concerned: black eyeliner, skin-tight jeans, black and red hair dye became the most relevant signifiers of the genre.\n\nI vividly remember begging my mother to let me dye my hair bright red because of Hayley Williams’s hairdo, and I certainly wasn’t the only one.\n\nAfter these events, thousands of teens marched in London and protested against these claims. Immediately, a moral panic amongst parents arose. What were these kids listening to after all? Soon after, the band released a statement regarding their latest album at the time — The Black Parade — and the newspaper’s claims: “My Chemical are and always have been vocally anti-violence and anti-suicide. As a band, we have always made it one of our missions through our actions to provide comfort, support, and solace to our fans.”\n\n“The message and theme of our album The Black Parade is hope and courage. Our lyrics are about finding the strength to keep living through pain and hard times. The last song on our album states: ‘I am not afraid to keep on living’ – a sentiment that embodies the band’s position on hardships we all face as human beings,” the band wrote.\n\nAlthough the genre was controversial and often demonised, most people who listened and still listen to the genre mention how the experience of listening to these bands’ songs was ‘healing’ and ‘cathartic’, especially in regards to mental health.\n\nThe communities and close friendships that were formed in online fanbases and gigs are also often brought up.\n\nBut does music hold a therapeutical value? And, can indeed music save one’s life?\n\nMost of these bands have now evolved stylistically or even disintegrated. For example, My Chemical Romance announced their separation in 2013, after 12 long years on the road. Paramore have recently released After Laughter, an album that underpins the band member’s personal struggles with mental health and the subsequent changes to the band’s original formation, while lead singer Hayley Williams has recently been vocal about her struggles with PTSD and depression. Finally, Panic! At the Disco’s initial line-up has completely changed, and only Brendon Urie, the band’s lead singer, remains in the group.\n\nLikewise, these bands’ fans have also evolved as time went by. The ‘Kids from Yesterday’, now in their 20s, may have ditched the tight skinny jeans and the excess of eyeliner, but they will keep the teachings and memories emo brought upon them.\n\nIt’s 2019, and now I am almost 21. The sun makes a shy comeback as I make my way to university. I have now moved to a new country, and it’s my degree’s final year. The black noise in my head is now much quieter. I no longer feel the need always to be plugged in, in a world of my own. However, whenever I need to find an inner strength I still resort to my old emo playlists. I plug my earphones and take the gentle breeze in.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is struggling with mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, please contact/refer to one of these resources: Mind UK and Samaritans at 116 123 and The Listening Place at 020 3906 7676."
