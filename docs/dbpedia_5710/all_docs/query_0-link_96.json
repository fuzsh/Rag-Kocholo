        "text": "For those who care:\n\nBoth were founded in the same time period, the mid eighties(while grunge came slightly first)\n\nWhile they come from opposite sides of the coast, they both are from a Washington(Grunge Seattle, emo Washington D.C.)\n\nNone of the original bands of either genre are together anymore\n\nBoth have something to do with life situations(grunge dealing with them, emo whining about them)\n\nThey both have their own fashion associated with the genre, and aside from Goth, no other rock genre has a specific style(glam and death metal don't really have a fashion aside from the musicians wearing that stuff.)\n\nBut, grunge has had more success over the years than emo has, even 'til this day, when emo is on the rise. Soundgarden, claimed by most to be the first grunge band, had a score of top ten Hot 100 singles right before they split in 97', and for that matter, 3 of them were #1 for several weeks, including Black Hole Sun, which was #1 for 2 months. Pearl Jam is still around, the same can't be said about early emo bands. Long story short, grunge pwns emo.\n\nThey are in no way similar. Grunge was the rejection of the materialistic lifestyle a previous generation offered, Emo is the result of the generation after who cherished their goods only to find nothing good came of them.\n\nGrunge was the sound of youth with no direction being constantly haunted by life's questions and bombarded with the empty promises of the corporate world. Emo is the sound of sheltered youth, too self absorbed and histionic to realize what the real problems of the world are.\n\nGrunge = hard rock. Emo = guitarists afraid of plectrums harder then 0.50\n\nHave you people forgotten what original emotive music was?\n\nIt was the act of literally falling on the floor screaming/crying during shows and in songs. Many genres could have evolved from the emotive genre. Such as, screamo, grunge, industrial, and metal. Most metal bands scream about dying and yet they're not considered emo. And yet bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco do NONE of that stuff, and are considered 'emo'.\n\nThere's a difference between music genres and lifestyle. Get it through your thick skulls.\n\nMost of FOB's songs have to do with girls, and most of p!atd's have to do with sex, believe it or not.\n\nReal emo bands would include, Hawthorne Heights (In the song 'Ohio is for lovers', one of the lyrics are, slit my wrists, and black my eyes)\n\nAnother example would be The Used. In one of their videos, the lead singer gets his wrists cut.\n\nAlthough this doesn't relate to what their music sounds like, most people would call them 'emo'."
