        "text": "Course Description: Throughout this semester, we will examine the development of the film industry from its inception until the 1950s. Our focus will primarily be on American cinema, but we will discuss important foreign works that had great influence on the industry as a whole. Scholars approach film history from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives such as economics, aesthetics, cultural theory, audience studies, production studies, technology, and many others. Our readings, assignments and discussions will touch on these various ways to explore film as we learn about the trajectory of the film industry and its vast influence on other media as well as our culture. We will consider how films serve as historical artifacts that inform and enlighten us about the socioeconomic and cultural along with important national and world events. In this class, you will be required to critically examine complex issues in writing and will further develop your research an analytical skills as media scholars. Assignments will test your knowledge and challenge you to put the course concepts into practice as you develop your own theories about films and how the film industry works."
