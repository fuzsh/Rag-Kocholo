        "text": "We rarely jump into reviews of topics outside of movies and television. Yet sometimes it is fun to break the mold, and Where Are Your Boys Tonight? by Chris Payne certainly hit me right in my heart. Throughout most of my high school experience, I loved and dove deep into the pop-punk scene. Fall Out Boy has been my favorite band since I was fifteen, and memories of screaming My Chemical Romance with my friends as we drove through the night are still lodged in my brain.\n\nOf course, a book about the rise and fall of emo was always going to be in my wheelhouse. I was a teenager who thought he was super rebellious, listening to Black Flag, A Day to Remember, and the bands listed above. I went to Warped Tour, but also caught Rise Against in small venues. I’m something of an easy mark for Where Are Your Boys Tonight?, but despite the nostalgia it inspires, there are many ways this could be a victory lap for a genre back in popularity.\n\nInstead, Payne’s greatest achievement is getting nearly everyone on the record. However, his ability to provide context far beyond artists’ self-mythologizing helps his book feel much grander. Where Are Your Boys Tonight? does not just breakdown the biggest bands, but lays the track for an understanding of the influences and rock bands that never played on MTV. The stops and starts of the iconic bands are covered, but so are the in-depth conversations about Silent Majority. Like the music he’s covering, Payne digs into the emotional and mental states of his subjects. Letting them clear the air helps shine a light on the scene.\n\nWhile the subtitle “The Oral History of Emo’s Mainstream Explosion 1999-2008” applies, Payne wisely expands his scope. Where Are Your Boys Tonight? loops in the early figures but lets the icons help lay the roadmap.\n\nMikey Way delivers the opening discourse about the New Jersey scene, where Saves The Day became early kings. A rotating series of voices tells us about Brand New versus Taking Back Sunday and the battle for Long Island. New Found Glory emerges from Florida, but Dashboard Confessional becomes the iconic artist of the Florida scene. Meanwhile, Chicago rock started harder, grungier, and more political before Fall Out Boy broke through the crowd. As Payne jumps between music scenes, it opens the door for more complicated discussions.\n\nThis results in some very important changes in discourse. There’s an open acknowledgment by many of the interviewees that the music got a little too misogynistic for its own good. At the same time, they were painted in a negative light by many, often with a homophobic undertone from those who seemed to criticize the most. For all the talk of dying and sadness, the scene served as a way for many to confront their own demons. With an outlet, they could understand their own health, but the media painted the genre in the darkest light possible.\n\nThe strongest aspect of any Oral History is getting primary sourcing. In Where Are Your Boys Tonight? Payne delivers the firsthand accounts in the dozens. Some voices are missing, including Gerard Way. Still, the vast majority of Where Are Your Boys Tonight relies on the heavy hitters wearing their hearts on their sleeves. Pete Wentz, Hayley Williams, Travie McCoy, Gabe Saporta, Max Beamus, Mikey Way, Chris Carrabba, Fred Mascherino, and Bert McCracken all get significant time to muse about the era. Adding to the commentary are pop culture writers, including Leslie Simon, Hanif Abdurraqib, and Andy Greenwald. It’s a murderer’s row of talent, and their memories viscerally bring the basement shows and parties back to life.\n\nDiscussions of jealousy and anger populate Where Are Your Boys Tonight? as well. The Used, specifically McCracken, owns their frustrations of not reaching the heights of My Chemical Romance. Travie McCoy admits to being a heroin addict. Other prominent figures are lauded for staying clean, while Beamus believes his smoking caused his manic episodes to get worse. Payne often frames the era as an era of artists getting “too much, too soon,” but the power of the music made them impossible to ignore. The songs were too good. Perhaps most of all, the figures of the movement wanted their moment, and they took it without asking. This was their time.\n\nIn the years after the Emo boom, the genre shifted its genre. Soon, rappers like Juice Wrld and Lil Peep took on the mantle. The new bands thrived outside the mainstream scene and have allowed Emo to return to its roots in basements and hardcore vibes. There’s a hopefulness about the place the genre holds today, both as nostalgia and influence. Where moments of Where Are Your Boys Tonight occasionally feel incomplete, Payne highlights its ephemeral nature as part of the fun.\n\nThe emo scene thrived in an era of distrust in George W. Bush, multiple wars, and a financial collapse. It ended with Barack Obama and belief in the future. Whether everything was hunky dory never actually mattered. For the moment, there was anger and frustration, but more importantly, there was music to heal the wound. For all the negative connations and outright homophobia thrown against emo, it also lit the path to safety for others. Where Are Your Boys Tonight? is a love letter to an era, but most importantly, it’s an accounting of how it all went down.\n\nCheck out Where Are Your Boys Tonight: The Oral History of Emo’s Mainstream Explosion 1999-2008 at your local library.
