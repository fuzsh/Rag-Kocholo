        "text": "Trophy Jump’s debut full-length, “Feels,” is a fine piece of sonic artistry weaving an anthemic indie punk ambiance and seamlessly blending elements borrowed from many different but complementary subgenres like punk rock, skate punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, emo, indie rock, and alternative. Hailing from Zagreb, Croatia, Trophy Jump has crafted an album that not only pays homage to its diverse influences but also carves out a distinctive sound that is both catchy and ear-appealing.\n\nOne of the defining features of “Feels” is the continuous dueling between lead and rhythm guitars, creating a dynamic and captivating sonic landscape. The guitars serve as a centerpiece, delivering mesmerizing leads, themes, melodies, harmonies, and other sonic maneuvers that keep the listener engaged throughout. On the other side, the rhythm section bursts with powerful chord progressions and riffs, adding a robust foundation to the album’s overall sonic aesthetic.\n\nOf course, it would be foolish not to mention the remainder of the band. The low-end support based upon equally complex, vividly hearable, warm-sounding basslines offers more than necessary heaviness, depth, and clarity, while the outstanding drumming dictates groove and pace by delivering energetic, flawlessly arranged, well-accentuated beats, breaks, fills, and other percussive acrobatics. Trophy Jump also thought about vocals, so you’ll notice how the lead vocalist delivers marvelous harmonies with such ease, while the remainder of the band helps him out with cleverly implemented back vocals and singalongs. Everything sounds top-notch from scratch to finish, proving Trophy Jump isn’t a band you should easily overlook.\n\nTracks like “Business Trip,” “Neon Light,” “Leather Couch,” “I Don’t Wanna Live In A Fitness Ad,” “Hugs On Drugs,” and “Beer Pressure” emerge as highlights, showcasing Trophy Jump’s ability to craft songs that resonate with energy and memorable hooks. Each track exemplifies their musical versatility, drawing from a myriad of influences while maintaining a cohesive and signature sound. However, the album’s charm lies not just in individual tracks but in the seamless flow of the entire material. From start to finish, “Feels” is a sonic journey that sparkles with brilliant ideas and impressive moments. The band’s DIY spirit, evident in their approach to booking shows, recording, and mixing music, adds an authentic and personal touch to the album. This hands-on ethos has allowed Trophy Jump to play at well-known venues and events, sharing stages with notable acts like Pup, The Murderburgers, Counterpunch, Oi Polloi, and more."
