It’s nature’s way of saying the Broncos are back… or it may just mean that it’s going to be another scorcher of a day. Regardless, August is finally here, and it is bringing with an onslaught of concerts, festivals and sports that will even get the most introverted homebody outside to play.\n\nWelcome to August’s Rad Things (to) Do. Enjoy the party.\n\nNOTE: Due to the ongoing impacts from the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, access to downtown via light rail is being provided via Union Station. Visit the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project webpage for the latest updates.\n\nFestivals, parades and special events\n\nAug. 1-25: “Wicked” at the Buell Theatre\n\nOne of the most well-known Broadway productions of all time comes to Denver’s Buell Theatre this month. Wicked takes place in the Wizard of Oz universe years before Dorothy’s arrival, where a friendship between two polar opposite ladies turns sour thanks to society’s impressions of the two.\n\nThis legendary musical will only be in town until Aug. 25, so get your tickets today at https://www.denvercenter.org/tickets-events/wicked/.\n\nThe Denver Center for the Performing Arts can be accessed via the Free MallRide and routes 9, 15, 15L at 15th and Curtis streets.\n\nAug. 22-24: Q BBQ Fest Denver at Civic Center Park\n\nImagine a world where the only things to eat are brisket, pulled pork, smoked sausage, ribs, turkey legs and all the fixings that come with it. If that sounds like a world worth living in, then head to Civic Center Park for one of the largest barbecue festivals this side of the Mississippi. The annual Q BBQ Fest brings some of the best pitmasters from Colorado, Texas, Missouri and even Mississippi to Denver to showcase some of the best BBQ in the land. Over 30,000 pounds of meat will be smoked, grilled and devoured over three days. For the competitor eaters out there, enter the Rib Rumble, where contestants have five minutes to eat as many ribs as possible.\n\nLearn more about the festival and get tickets at https://www.qbbqdenver.com.\n\nCivic Center Park can be accessed via any Civic Center Station-bound bus.\n\nAug. 24: Mile High Power Fest at the Oriental Theater\n\nWhat is power metal? Well, just imagine that Ludwig van Beethoven was given a Power Rangers Blu-Ray box set to binge watch while eating that pretzel Michael Scott ordered in that one episode of The Office, and was handed a guitar right after and told to write a metal song. That’s basically power metal, and lovers of the genre will be able to celebrate it at the Mile High Power Fest at the Oriental Theater. Headlined by Seven Spires and Aether Realm, this music festival dials the adrenaline up to 11.\n\nCatch the Route 44 to West 44th Avenue and Tennyson Street to embrace the chaos.\n\nAug. 24: Denver BrunchFest at the Tivoli Quad, Auraria Campus\n\nGather the brunch squad and head over to the Tivoli Quad for the 2024 Denver BrunchFest! Enjoy samples from Denver’s finest brunch spots, live music, games and more.\n\nGet tickets today at https://www.brunch-so-hard.com/denver-brunchfest/.\n\nThe Tivoli Quad is just a short walk away from Auraria Parkway and 9th Street, served by routes 1, 15L and 20.\n\nSports\n\nTo quote the great UFC ring announcer Bruce Buffer, “IT’S TIIIIIMMMMEEEEEE!” for what, exactly? It’s time for the Broncos to take the field and hopefully not disappoint the Broncos’ faithful for yet another consecutive season (Editor’s note: I am not holding my breath).\n\nThe Broncos kick off their 2024 preseason with a battle for the starting quarterback position. The Broncos’ 2024 first round draft pick, Bo Nix, looks to get the starting job as a rookie, but NFL veteran Zach Wilson, acquired from the Jets in the offseason, and journeyman Jarrett Stidham are not making it easy. The preseason will be the ultimate test to see which of the three gets the starting job to lead the Broncos out of a purgatory of mediocrity.\n\nThe football action isn’t just limited to Denver, as the University of Colorado Buffaloes look to rebound from an underwhelming 2023 season as they take on NCAA Football Championship Subdivision powerhouses North Dakota State University later this month. Coach Deion “Prime” Sanders is hoping his Buffaloes squad, led by his son Shedeur Sandars at quarterback and star wide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter, can get back to their winning ways. The Buffs are in uncharted waters this year, as the university is back in the Big XII after over a decade in the Pac-12 Conference. A lot has changed in 13 years, and the Big XII is bigger than ever. Their campaign for redemption begins Aug. 29 at Folsom Field\n\nNot only are the Broncos and the Buffs taking the field for the first time this year, but the Rockies are still in action at Coors Field. While the chances of making the postseason continue to diminish, the Blake Street Bombers look to get out of their slump and get some wins on the board to finish the season on a high note. Hey, at least the weather is nice and there really isn’t anything better than a day at the ballpark!\n\nEmpower Field at Mile High Stadium (accessible via the D, E, H and W lines at Empower Field at Mile High Station)\n\nDenver Broncos (NFL preseason):\n\nAug. 18: vs. Green Bay Packers\n\nAug. 25: vs. Arizona Cardinals\n\nCoors Field (accessible via any Union Station-bound bus or train)\n\nColorado Rockies (MLB):\n\nAug. 6-8: vs. New York Mets\n\nAug. 9-11: vs. Atlanta Braves\n\nAug. 16-18: vs. San Diego Padres\n\nAug. 26-29: vs. Miami Marlins\n\nAug. 30-31: vs. Baltimore Orioles\n\nFolsom Field (accessible via routes 204, 225D/225T, DASH, SKIP, AB1 and GS at Broadway and Pleasant Street, and Broadway and University Avenue)\n\nUniversity of Colorado Buffaloes (college football):\n\nAug. 29: vs. North Dakota State University\n\nConcerts\n\nBuckle up, buckaroos, as August’s concert slate might just be the best the area will see the rest of this year, especially for lovers of rock and metal. Get ready to throw the horns up to sets by bands such as Megadeth, Twenty One Pilots, Five Finger Death Punch, I Prevail, Hailstorm and Sunny Day Real Estate, all headlined by none other than the Foo Fighters. Hip-hop and R&B heads are in for a huge treat this month as well, with shows by Ice Spice, Jhené Aiko, Chief Keef, Schoolboy Q and Ski Mask The Slump God all throwing down, headlined by Future and Metro Boomin’.\n\nThis month is going to be wild for music lovers.\n\nWant to see a preview of some of the artists and bands performing this month?
