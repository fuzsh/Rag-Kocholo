Check out the best emo songs (in no particular order). Emo is a genre of music that exploded in popularity in the 2000s. With bands such as Fall Out Boy, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco, Yellowcard, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, The Used and many others, the emo genre was a unique time in the music industry.
