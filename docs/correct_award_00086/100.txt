Sinclair Lewis (1885–1951), the first writer from the US to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, released his first serious novels from 1914, including 1917’s The Job. Main Street (1920) and Babbitt (1922) earned him stellar success. His satirizing of American capitalism and politics, and his modern female characters, make him a writer to be valued.
