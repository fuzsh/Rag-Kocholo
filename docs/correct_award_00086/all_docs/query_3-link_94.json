        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nSinclair Lewis published It Can't Happen Here in 1935. Author of the award-winning Main Street and Babbitt, Sinclair Lewis forever changed the landscape of American literature with his ironclad commitment to writing only what he calls \"the truth.\" This lofty collection of ideas encompasses the principles of equality and cooperation espoused by Robert M. Hutchins's University of Chicago Commission on Freedom of the Press published earlier in 1947. Thought control was one of the most powerful tools of opposing political candidates. Pioneered by Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin in the Thirties, its popularity increased and was utilized by almost all the presidential candidates between 1944 and 1948. Related to these themes, in 1935, Sinclair Lewis underscored the importance of freedom of the press when he had prospective American dictator Berzelius Windrip say: \"I know the Press only too well. Almost all editors hide away in spider dens, men without thought of family or public interest… the idea is present in the rural Jean-Claude Hollerithedr, but around it have crept the shades of \"Newspaper Row\", meaning circulations that count and make dollars… the militarists, the Bolsheviki, all got their start from the exploitation of the collective instinct. The Press of the United States.104 These comments raise the question that although these tactics may be successful in controlling public opinion, at what point can a free press break the hold of a demagogue, tyrant, or dictator? These problems have been highlighted in this paper as authentic (The vestigial concept of the benign tyrant) and clear. It Can't Happen is a social and political satire of the darkest period in American society, when fascism loomed on the horizon. It has since been called prophecy. With presidential candidates such as David M. Yoderberg Gary Hart, his wellpublicized dalliances, Bill Clinton, Monica Loving, and Herman Cain and allegations of sketchy business dealings with one of his staff, it's safe to say It Can't has become one of the more delightful, if not biting, literary forms of political prophecy ever written on America's domestic scene. Aware of the political spotperils in conducting an investigation of the presidential elections of 1944, 1948, and 1952, it was quite fortuitous, coming across the engaging novel It Can't Happen Here written by Sinclair Lewis. According to Sinclair: \"David Yoderberg becomes a successful politician by an admixture of deceit, hypocrisy, truculence, vituperative abuse of others. After obtaining the nomination he promises American voters $1,000.00 tax rebates whilst Clinton in his budget proposal wants a tax rebate fund.…\" With the election of Barack Obama, this enigmatic president has made grand promises that regardless of the pledge of changing the current course, pretty soon, it's back to business per usual. Unlike Yoderberg, Obama has not used inciteful base tactics. Rather, he has gained the upper hand by providing \"hope and change.\".\n\n1.1. Background of Sinclair Lewis\n\nIn one sense, Sinclair Lewis is the least fortunate of our great writers, since even that part of his work which is obviously of high quality at times fails to receive the praise it deserves. With notable exceptions, such as Max Ferrars in his 1940 book on satiric comparisons, Professor Warwick Downing in his 1937 book on Lewis's language, and Robert Emmet Nolan in his 1943 study of the hero-patriot, few critics and students of literature have approached Lewis with the philological exactness which he has made for himself and which, when we bear in mind the general disregard of language and style by most professional critics today, is remarkable. Recognition of Lewis's linguistic ability is partly defeated, however, by the very nature of his art. As has often been remarked, though his limpid style is often a valuable, sometimes a complete, asset, it is far from flamboyant. Since an effulgence of words and images usually impresses a reader more permanently than does convincing characterization and plot interaction, it is natural that Sinclair Lewis, who is more esteemed for the latter than for the former, should come to seem lesser than lives, most grotesques, and magazines have proclaimed.\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nThe social and political scene in which \"It Can't Happen Here\" is situated is the American one between the years 1933 and 1936. It corresponds also to the beginning stage of state capitalism dominated by the New Deal. Undoubtedly, this period has a trend-setting character for all the other capitalist industrial countries and their developing social formations. The period was characterized by the victory of the democratic personification of the bourgeoisie over the fascist one of the home bourgeoisie and the military personnel; that internal achievement was attained via the mobilization and participation of the masses that were installed under the auspices of the democratic personification of the same bourgeoisie. The democratic personification as a method of reevaluation and co-opting the working classes and as an ideological apparatus was especially effective in the USA. And it had also the most comprehensive and enduring effect. No other country, nor the allies, nor the cult of victors, were capable of activating the social mechanisms of their population in regard to active consent for the practice-nurtured capacity to switch from private initiative to defense industry up to major social transformations and domestic and international system overhauls.\n\n2.1. Rise of Fascism in Europe\n\nDuring the period between the two World Wars, fascism, as a political belief, was gaining great strength in Europe. Fascism considered democracy and its principles as an unnecessary evil, opposed the ideas of freedom and individualism, emphasized leadership and government, and desired that all powers be unified under the control of the government. Totalitarianism, or complete control of every aspect of society, was presented as an alternative form of government. Italy became the first Fascist State under Benito Mussolini. In Germany, Adolf Hitler overthrew the democratic Weimar Republic and took complete control of the state, establishing National Socialism and ranking as the worst dictator of modern times. The movement was spreading to other countries, too. In Spain, Francisco Franco became the dictator of his country. Many novels and works of nonfiction documented the rise of fascism in Europe. The attention of and the concerns of American writers were entirely on Fascism in Europe, so that the fictional portrayals of fascism in America were almost totally ignored. We saw above that Sinclair Lewis was a social activist who worked for the welfare of mankind. He was fed up with the economic and social inequities. He was also concerned with the threat posed by the rise of Fascism in Europe, fearing that such a thing might happen in America also. Although still involved in a number of mercenary literary projects and out of the creativity that had distinguished his earlier works, Lewis shifted to realpolitik and he took crisis fiction seriously. \"It Can't Happen Here\" was written when the Second World War was on, and it specifically attacks the fascist movement and dictatorship in America. It is significant that keeping away from the familiar Maine characters, Lewis now shifted to unknown Vermont landscape. The geographical dissociation from what Lewis thought was the very best side of American life underscored his assessment of the fascist shadow as a metastasizing cancer, planted in the heartland of America.\n\n3. Plot Summary\n\nIn the novel, Doremus Marins is the editor of Vermont's liberal newspaper. He uses his paper both to spread liberal ideas and to express his dissatisfaction with the contemporary policies of the government. Doremus's daughter, Sis, is also unhappy with the actions of the government, and she tries to gain satisfaction from doing small things that help the liberal cause. Secretary Windrip is the democratically elected President of the United States. After Windrip institutes many measures harmful to the public welfare, Doremus both writes his paper about his dissatisfaction with what the President is doing and gives financial aid to small groups that want to retake the country. Windrip reacts to Doremus's opposition by arresting and jailing Doremus. After spending a few days in jail, Doremus is released when he gives his word that he will not write against the government anymore, verbally or in print. Doremus then contacts Shad Ledue, a Vermont businessman who has connections with the power-hungry members of his community, and asks Shad to aid two young local people who are taking steps to remove President Windrip from power. Shad helps the young people, but as a result of his previous association with Doremus, he is murdered by Windrip's police. During a period spent with Doremus in hiding, the two young Vermont people tell Doremus that the forces opposed to Windrip are more organized than he had thought and are almost ready to go to war. Doremus joins them in their fight and makes a very good contribution to their cause.\n\n4. Character Analysis\n\nAmbitious but inexperienced, Doremus Jessup is the 60-year-old publisher of the only Vermont newspaper still in operation. Despite his financially and emotionally pressing reservations, the publisher assumes the position when practically everyone else declines. He remains an anarchist. From the start, other than being a townsman with predictable prejudices, Doremus is not stereotypic. The numbing oppression of behind-the-lines fascism on all sides does not actually radicalize the newspaper editor. It astonishes that he does not compromise the paper in the face of certain danger. Specifically, once he recognized the grave peril involved in the appearance of a single unscheduled editorial, he was astute enough to avoid further editorials of like nature. Nonetheless, the fiery resistance of brave young people to the existing fascist-anarchistic state finally does prompt him to great daring. Concerned and distressed that \"the clown\" has achieved the Republican nomination for the presidency, the small-town editor writes a series of careful editorials over a period of several months of \"American Caesar.\" The editor-publisher does not, once the punisher arrives, encourage his family to flee to Canada for peace and safety; he secures an expected exile for himself. The judged-by-God editor went on printing the truth at the expense of most of his goods, some of his friends, seriously embarrassing large numbers of relatives, and an editorial assistant. About him, Doremus is like the farmers of his era who, in behalf of government-owned mills and silos, willingly sold Doremus the corn which he ground into cornmeal destined to be Republican personal-warfare condemned to feed the workers. The rigid position of the Eagle indicates even more small-town groupthink than was involved in Dr. Fowler's support of Buzz Windrip. And exactly as he expected, while the editor was not indicted, the job was taken away from him.\n\n4.1. Main Characters\n\nSet in the 1930s during the Depression era, this novel about American politics takes a look at the one thing that many had thought would never happen: fascism came to the United States and has taken over. It falls upon one small town newspaper editor to save the day. Doremus Jessup, who is probably the main character, is portrayed in a haphazard fashion. There are many gaps which make the reader wonder about what Jessup was doing between chapters, but in the end, the reader can clearly see how Sinclair Lewis is making him into the quintessential small town American hero. Doremus is a small town newspaperman trying to live as easy as possible during these troubled times. Lorinda Pike, his lady friend, is mentioned only a few times in the book. She seems to be just another stone that fell during the landslide, though she does try to march and protest as long as she can. Sissy, Doremus' servant, is given little space in the written word of the book, but she is a huge part of the story. With her clear thoughts and her insight, she is the main confidante to Doremus. Fort Beulah is a town that quickly becomes a Nazi stronghold. It has all the people necessary to make this story very interesting. This town has nothing but a group of vile animals who are only interested in their own gain. Finally, we have Windrip and Lee Sarason. They are key to this story. They are used to portray two of the most vile personalities of the era. When we finally realize this, there is nothing we can do other than shake our head in amazed wonder.\n\n5.

Totalitarianism\n\nTotalitarianism holds no charm for America either. Our country is pluralistic to the point where few Americans would want any one person to have the absolute power which totalitarians aim for. However, as concern increases about the spread of totalitarianism among foreign nations, and as our country's economic and political condition grows steadily more chaotic, we are likely to see more and more outcroppings of extreme ideas; as the chaos deepens the solutions put forward are more likely to be simple-minded and to have an appeal for people who have lost hope. It Can't Happen Here does not attempt to persuade us that America might become totalitarian. It simply postulates that a large number of people, frightened by crisis, armed with terroristic tactics, and urged on by leaders who are anti-religious demagogues, could so easily dominate the human organisms in the population which intends to use the words \"I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED\" as the basic defense of an individualistic society such as ours. Besides, the reader soon realizes that totalitarians are violent people, and, as was the case with Mussolini, the force employed against the democracies is not of the type carried in agents' pocket pistols. These foreign supersalesmen are simply hawkers of merchandise built up by \"IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE BRETHREN.\" The totalitarian book is being circulated with much glee, practically written by persuasively presenting panic to the electors who are anything but disinterested. Once panic is able to lay the listener open to any dread he can rhapsodize. To persuade him so to open up to all outward hope in the ultimate salvation from fear and aloneness, a totalitarian must always offer him inward fear and persecution, the punishment and the amok fear are not limited to the continuum fear of a leader or self-alienate government, or to the equal attempt to prove by punishment. Fear and punishment have more power to show themselves in thought than acts of rebellion. The famous Professor Ornene's warning to the banker, Julian Bruce for the fact that \"HE OFFERS NO PERSONAL TREASURES; WHATEVER YOU PUT IN SO MUCH WILL BE LOST WITH IT,\" is the direct outcome of failure to consider a dictator maniacal, a charismatic Leader who is convinced he can always will himself by his very existence to remain in power. Power in a nation has an underlying source in the state totalitarian people control. It is the mirror by which all action of a tyrant exists. Imperial expansion is a function of the structural integral guiding principle. The tyranny which tortures and executes individual people, pricks or punishes them for criticizing the government. Sinclair Lewis has a very personal portrait of the one-hundred-and-seventh significant unto Caesar; whether Caesar be absolutism with the kingdom of a Caesar who cannot be hurt; when Bland does merely operate the government Caesar, he is a functionary. The common people of Can't choose between these rulers, along with some Goebbels propaganda, prepared for the pseudo-threats of Lexington's traitors. When danger raised its head, these people were ready for Ferdinand Luthuli, Jonathan Small, Dr. Fred Lindell, Bishop Prang, or Constantine Lewis. Taught to admire the beautiful things Bland does will raise, and will respond fearfully to the ego of the personality. This will record to a kingdom without analysis and without a DIES CREATED., to respond the harmony of the streets. The magic of dictatorship has come into being. No examination has been made to determine that power is held by no one man, and that no one man can lose it of his own. The defeat of the response dictator (Bland, Zipp and/or Lee Sarason) can be explained thanks to the belief on the part of any extensive organized forces who plan to say, that power from any ruler, of the dictator could be forcibly overthrown. This belief is not a part of the fictional structure of the book Can't help reform the moralities of its personality and the traditional personal interests of the career of Caesar, but, in actuality, it is an admixture. By Sinclair Lewis's words, Can't be chosen, in the event that the established powers are bureaucracies, cannot be threatened. At the last students' meeting, it is disclosed that Princeton University is under the discording influence of the one-hundred-and-seventy-seven reactionary leadership of the one-hundred-and-seventy-seven. Consequently, the historical students are prepared to enact beneficent reforms of the University. They are ready to play their part with regard to the whole establishment. These young aristocrats bring their hereditary ideas on government to their campus. Son of Julius Caesar, Julian reaches to power through the crassness met by the current inhabitants of the White House.\n\n6. Reception and Impact\n\nThis section discusses the immediate and longer-term reception and impact of It Can't Happen Here. The novel's publication in 1935 was met with approval in some quarters, bemusement in others, and hostility in still others. Some reviewers failed to appreciate the story's seriousness, reviewing it almost as a conventional novel, without realizing it was intended as a warning. Influential figures on both the left and the right initially approved the novel. After it was published, however, with Nazism's true nature becoming increasingly evident, It Can't Happen Here came to be seen as an intervention into contemporary debates. Critics discussed it along with other works exploring the similar themes of the rise of fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany. Lewis's novel was a deliberate intervention into the ongoing debate about American political culture, and especially the significance of the new Roosevelt administration. This section concludes by looking at responses to the 1936 stage dramatization of the novel, the 1939 radio broadcast, adaptations of the novel, and longer and more recent-term reception and impact. As soon as it was released, It Can't Happen Here made a deeply conflicting impression. To some, the novel seemed to be starting a valuable public debate. For others, the novel was dismissed as, for the most part, virtually meaningless. Effective satire, argued a Fargo-Moorehead columnist, has to have more truth in it than \"Mr. Lewis\" will find in his extravaganza. At the same time, Vanity Fair's Dorothy Thompson, Mrs. Lewis's fellow journalist and friend, praised \"It Can't Happen Here\" and stimulated much public interest. A bestseller book, The Roosevelt I Knew, endorsed the novel as a critique of the new administration. This led some reviewers to suspect the book as an example of a journalistic clique providing mutual backscratching. Interviewed for journalist H. L. Mencken's American Mercury, Lewis was asked if The Roosevelt I Knew was going to succeed in dragging the country back from dictatorship. Their mutual support made the novel a political event and facilitated Lewis's ability to make statements as a political spokesman long after the excitement of the new book had faded. Even Americans very remote from the avant-garde can find peculiar satisfaction in the fact that just at present Sinclair Lewis, with his new novel, has succeeded in making us forget the arduous legislative sessions of 1935 and their confused results."
