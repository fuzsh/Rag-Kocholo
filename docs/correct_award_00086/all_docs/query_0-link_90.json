        "text": "Plot Summary:\n\nArrowsmith tells the tale of Martin Arrowsmith fulfills a lifelong dream of becoming a physician with a passion for research. Combating the forces of ignorance and greed, he relentlessly pursues scientific truth, even in the face of his own personal tragedy.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nMartin Arrowsmith is an ambitious young medical student who rises through medical school, and works in just about every medical field available to him, mostly unhappily, until he is forced out by public opinion or personal dissatisfaction, and finally pursues research and must struggle with the conflict of pure medical research in the face of a devastating epidemic. Sinclair Lewis remains true to his sharp, satirical views of American populations, but instead of limiting it to small towns, like he did in Main Street, he fires his attacks almost indiscriminately, at small towns, larger towns, medical schools, country doctors, city doctors, public officials, and even scientific researchers. But the sarcasm seems tuned down throughout the novel (with a few almost outlandish characters being the exception), and the history of the medical profession in the early 20th century holds it all together in a cohesive whole.\n\nPerhaps it is because I work in the medical field right now, and interact with a number of modern doctors, but this was a fascinating look at what medicine and doctors looked like in the 1910s and 1920s, and what microbiologic and bacteriologic research looked like through the 20s as doctors still struggled to find cures for many of the diseases that still ravaged populations in those days. In this regard, Sinclair Lewis was assisted in his descriptions of the scientific research, and at times even the scientists themselves, by Dr. Paul H. DeKruif, to whom the book is dedicated, and who received 25% of the royalties. DeKruif was a microbiologist and writer, who the next year would publish the bestseller Microbe Hunters, a non-fiction look at some of the most important figures in microbiology and their contributions.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSinclair Lewis was not a man to shy away from controversy. His 1920 novel Main Street, was controversial, and the subsequent rejection of it by the Pulitzer Prize advisory board began a controversy between the Pulitzer Prize board and Sinclair Lewis that came to a head in 1926.\n\nAfter the past year’s controversy over the selection of Edna Ferber’s So Big, none of the novel jurors returned the next year. However, Robert M. Lovett, who had previously served on the 1921 jury recommending Main Street for the Pulitzer came back to serve on the 1926 jury, along with two new jurors, Richard Burton and Edwin Lefèvre. The jury unanimously recommended Sinclair Lewis’ Arrowsmith for the award, citing as other notable books from the year The Smiths by Janet Fairbanks and Porgy by Du Bose Heyward.\n\nSinclair Lewis was informed by his publisher before the prize announcement that he would be awarded the prize, which he stated, in a letter back, he meant to refuse on account of what he called the “Main Street burglary” in 1921. Thus, when he was officially notified of his being awarded the prize, he had already had time to craft and perfect a response to the Pulitzer Prize Committee.\n\nHis letter, which was made public after the prize announcement, is full of harsh and bitter accusations against the Pulitzer Prize for Novel. He calls the Prize “particularly objectionable” because it causes writers to “write this, or timorously to avoid writing that, in order to tickle the prejudices of a haphazard committee.” He complains especially about the prize criteria being for the “wholesome” novels dealing with the “highest standard of American manners and manhood,” stating that this causes the prize to be awarded “not according to their actual literary merit but in obedience to whatever code of Good Form may chance to be popular at the moment.”\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMain Street was a widely popular and controversial book when it was published in 1920, selling over 250,000 copies in the first year and making Sinclair Lewis wealthy almost overnight. It was cited (along with his later Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Arrowsmith), to be one of the main contributing factors to his winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930, making him the first American author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nPlot summary:\n\nMain Street is the 1920 novel by Sinclair Lewis that tells the story of Carol Milford, a liberal, free-spirited young woman from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Carol meets and marries Will Kennicott, a doctor who convinces her to move back to his small hometown of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. While there, Carol finds the smug conservatism of the town objectionable and sets out to try and make the town a little more progressive, with little effectiveness. A satirical gem, Main Street is Sinclair Lewis’ classic portrait of small town Midwestern American life.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nMain Street is biting, sarcastic, and satirical in all the right ways. It is hilarious and at times oddly prescient. Unfortunately, it also feels very dated. Focused on small town Midwestern life in the 1910s, Lewis deconstructs the myth of “God’s Own Country” and doesn’t pull any punches. But it’s a way of life that’s a hundred years gone, and I found it difficult to read at times, especially when Lewis falls into lengthy descriptions of a Midwestern life that are hard to relate to anymore. But when he begins talking about the people, that’s when Lewis really shines through, and the reader is treated with some fantastic lines. “Mr. Blausser was known as a hustler. He liked to be called Honest Jim,” and “It has not yet been recorded that any human being has gained a very large or permanent contentment from meditation upon the fact that he is better off than others,” are two that particularly stand out, but the book is full of similar small gems.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe novel jury in 1921 was the first jury since the Pulitzer Prize began to not contain any of the original 3 jurors. Stuart P. Sherman, the new jury member from the year before, who had been the one to suggest Java Head before he understood the wording change from “whole” to “wholesome” had similar issues with the 1921 nominees, as well. Joined by two new jury members, they were faced with Sinclair Lewis’ controversial Main Street. Lewis’ novel attacked middle America, and painted a less than ideal picture of small town people in the heart of the country, and became one of the best selling and most talked about books that year. One of the new jurors, Hamlin Garland, called Main Street “vicious and vengeful,” but was convinced by the other two jury members to back their recommendation of Main Street to the Pulitzer Prize Board, while also mentioning favorably Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence in the jury report.\n\nThe Board had some trouble, and a fair bit of discussion over the recommendation of Main Street, and several of the Board members felt similarly to Hamlin Garland. Enough members, in fact, that the Board eventually decided to overturn the jury recommendation and by a split vote, awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Novel in 1921 to Edith Wharton. This was the first time, but by no means would it be the last, that the Prize Board would overturn or ignore the recommendation of the jury.\n\nThe jurors, wanting their side of the decision to be made clear, revealed their original recommendation in The New Republic, a newspaper at which one of the jury members worked, causing some amount of public debate and protest. Edith Wharton would go on to criticize the Pulitzer Prize, after the Novel Jury details became public, and, because of her public criticism, Sinclair Lewis would dedicate his next novel, Babbitt, to her. But the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Novel, and the controversy made public by the jury members, would set in motion events that would come to a head in 1926, when Sinclair Lewis would once again become a part of the Pulitzer controversies and lead to the first of many changes in the official wording and judging of the Pulitzer Prize for Novel.\n\nCurrently reading: Main Street by Sinclair Lewis"
