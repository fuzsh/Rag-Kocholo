        "text": "38 SAINT VINCENT STREET\n\nTORONTO2 TELEPHONE\n\nNORTH 6127 Dear Mr. Lewis1:\n\nMy father3 has sent me an Omaha4 paper5 quoting some very fine and generous things you said about me6 in your lecture there. That you have read me and like me would in itself be good news enough,â€”but this downright friendly push from your strong hand, is something that touches and pleases me more than I can say. I would not be at all surprised if your vigorous talk did more to make Nebraska7 people read me than my own books have done. So I've to thank you for helping me to get the attention of my own folks out there. But I've to thank you much more for letting me know that you like my books yourself. I would rather have the respect of a few (about three) strong, straight-hitting young writers like yourself than anything else that can come out of the writing business. That's the truth, and I am therefore very gratefully yours,"
