He wrote “Main Street,” which was on almost every high school reading list and is 100 years old this year. And for many, that’s about as far as Lewis learning goes.\n\nBut there’s so much more to the state’s native son. And a new exhibit at the Minnesota History Center aims to enlighten.\n\nMNHS senior curator and curator of this exhibit Patrick Coleman shared five things you might not know (and are just a small taste of what you could learn at the exhibit) about Lewis:\n\nSNUBBED PULITZER PRIZE\n\nSinclair Lewis was recommended for the Pulitzer Prize by the Pulitzer jury three times for his novels “Main Street,” “Babbitt” and “Arrowsmith.” He was awarded the Pulitzer in 1925 for “Arrowsmith,” but turned it down. Part of the criteria back then was the Pulitzer had to go to a novel that featured the “wholesome atmosphere of American life,” Coleman says. Lewis didn’t approve of the distinction. (The criteria was changed in 1928.)\n\nACCEPTED NOBEL PRIZE\n\nLewis was the first American author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature when he received the medal (which is included in the History Center exhibit) in 1930. “The joke around here is you have to win a Nobel Prize to get an exhibit at MNHS,” Coleman says. Unlike the Pulitzer, which is for one novel, the Nobel is for a body of work, he says. But Lewis’ acceptance speech, “The American Fear of Literature,” was controversial and critical and is noted particularly, Coleman says, for the line: “Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.”\n\nSAUK CENTRE TO ST. PAUL\n\nMost Minnesotans know that Lewis was born in Sauk Centre, which was the model for Gopher Prairie in “Main Street.” But Lewis lived all over Minnesota, Coleman says, on Summit Avenue in St. Paul, in Minneapolis, Lake Minnetonka, Mankato and Duluth. He vacationed throughout the state and loved the North Shore, the Gunflint Trail, Rainy Lake and the hills of southeastern Minnesota. When Lewis died in 1951, his ashes were returned to Sauk Centre, so he was born and buried there, Coleman says. (The urn that held his ashes is in the exhibit.)\n\nMADE INTO MOVIES\n\n“Hollywood loved Sinclair Lewis,” Coleman says. Nine of his novels and six of his short stories became film adaptations. Three of his novels were made into movies twice. The movie “Elmer Gantry,” based on his book of the same name, won three Academy Awards. Trailers for a couple of his books that became movies are included in the exhibit.\n\nWIFE INTERVIEWED HITLER\n\nLewis’ second wife, Dorothy Thompson, was a famous female newspaper journalist and radio broadcaster in the 1930s and ’40s, Coleman says. She interviewed Hitler and tried to warn America of the Nazi threat. She was the first American reporter expelled from Germany for anti-Nazi rhetoric. Lewis got a lot of information from Thompson for his book “It Can’t Happen Here,” a novel about the election of a fascist to the American presidency.\n\n‘SINCLAIR LEWIS: 100 YEARS OF MAIN STREET’\n\nWhat: More than 300 items from the MNHS collections, the Sinclair Lewis Foundation and other lenders.\n\nWhen: On exhibit now\n\nWhere: Minnesota History Center, 345 W. Kellogg Blvd., St. Paul\n\nHours: 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sundays\n\nTickets: $12-$8, members free; timed entry, available at mnhs.org or by calling the box office at 651-259-3015.\n\nOriginally Published: April 15, 2021 at 5:22 a.m."
