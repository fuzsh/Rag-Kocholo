        "text": "Harry Sinclair Lewis (February 7, 1885 â January 10, 1951) was an American writer and playwright. In 1930, he became the first writer from the United States (and the first from the Americas) to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was awarded âfor his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.â He is best known for his novels Main Street (1920), Babbitt (1922), Arrowsmith (1925), Elmer Gantry (1927).\n\nIn 1930 Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer from the United States to receive the award, after he had been nominated by Henrik SchÃ¼ck, member of the Swedish Academy. In the academy's presentation speech, special attention was paid to Babbitt. In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that âin America most of us â not readers alone, but even writers â are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,â and that America is âthe most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.â He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: âOur American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.â\n\nCONTENTS:\n\nOur Mr. Wrenn (1914)\n\nThe Trail of the Hawk (1915)\n\nThe Job (1917)\n\nThe Innocents (1917)\n\nFree Air (1919)\n\nMain Street (1920)\n\nBabbitt (1922)\n\nArrowsmith (1925)\n\nMantrap (1926)\n\nElmer Gantry (1927)"
