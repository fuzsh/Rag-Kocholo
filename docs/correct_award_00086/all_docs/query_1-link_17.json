        "text": ">\n\n>\n\nThe Sinclair Lewis Society was created to encourage the study of, critical attention to, and general interest in the work, career, and legacy of Sinclair Lewis, the first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. We seek to facilitate a broader discussion of his writing as a social critic and satirist among scholars, critics, teachers, students, and readers everywhere.\n\nIn a series of novels over three decadesâMain Street, Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, Dodsworth, It Can't Happen Here, Kingsblood Royal among themâLewis created and courted controversy and, more important, defined a nation for itself. And his definitions have lived on, long after his own death, in his representations of American life and American characters. As Mark Schorer concludes his mammoth biography of Lewis, \"without his writing one cannot imagine modern American literature. That is because, without his writing, we can hardly imagine ourselves.\""
