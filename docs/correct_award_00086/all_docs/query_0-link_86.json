        "text": "Lewis, Sinclair\n\nBabbitt\n\nNew York: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1922. First Edition. Hard Cover. Very Good / No Jacket. Item #2331028\n\nFirst edition, first state. 'Purdy' and 'my fellow human' on p. 49 lines 4,5. No jacket. Boards lightly smudged, minor general wear.\n\n401 pp. Lewis was the first American author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Five pages of publisher ads follow text. This classic satirical novel portrays Babbitt as a materialistic, hypocritical, and self-important middle-aged realtor. His brief romantic encounter and an attempt at liberalism are curbed by fear of criticism, forcing him to conform to the wills of his fellow citizens and club members. A novel by the author who won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature, which inspired the film starring Willard Louis and Carmel Myers. Lewis is most well-known for Main Street, though recently his cautionary tale It Can't Happen Here has seen increased popularity based on similarity to current political events."
