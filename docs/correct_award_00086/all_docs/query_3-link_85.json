Lewis was a great American novelist and writer. Lewis wrote novels, poems, and even short stories. His works redefined and brought to light many issues in America that were thought to be normal and just but were not at the time. These issues include social norms, equality, and everyday life. That was what he primarily wrote about He was the first American author to win the Nobel Prize in 1930. Sinclair Lewis had a very positive influence on society because of his Nobel Prize in literature and his portrayal of the rich and the poor. His childhood and his adolescence also molded him to become what he was.\n\nTo understand how Sinclair Lewis has become a positive influence on society, we/first have to look at his childhood and early adulthood. It is simple to say that Sinclair Lewis had a rough childhood. His father was a very strict man and he did not care much for his son Sinclair. His mother also died when Sinclair was merely six years old. When he was in Oberlin College he developed a religious background but soon became an atheist after college. After college Lewis worked as a reporter and made short stories at the local newspaper. The first five novels Lewis wrote were unsuccessful and he lost money on all of them. Nevertheless Lewis pushed on and tried his luck at his next work. This novel was called Main Street and it was one of his most famous. Main Street was a huge hit with the public. Books were flying off the shelves and millions of c...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n... much human conflict and evil in the world. He concludes from one of his most famous novels that we have already conquered the earth and that we can gain nothing more from it except for violence. Because of this reason Lewis says that we should learn stop the wars and politics and just work together to make this world a better place.\n\nI hate your city. It has standardized all the beauty out of life. It is one big railroad station with all the people taking tickets for the best cemeteries.(Sinclair Lewis Babbitt)\n\nSinclair Lewis had a very positive impact on society through his many novels, short stories, and articles. His books gave a satiric look at our society and America as a whole through his many novels such as Babbit, Main Street, and Arrowsmith. He pointed out what is morally wrong with society and how we need to initiate action to make a serious difference."
