        "text": "(1885–1951). The novels that Sinclair Lewis wrote in the 1920s assure him a lasting place in American literature. Nothing he wrote before or after matches his work in Main Street, published in 1920, Babbitt (1922), Arrowsmith (1925), Elmer Gantry (1927), and Dodsworth (1929). In 1930 he won the Nobel prize in literature for the body of his writings. Lewis was the first American to receive the award.\n\nHarry Sinclair Lewis was born on Feb. 7, 1885, in Sauk Centre, Minn. As a boy he read everything obtainable. He graduated from Yale University in 1907 and was for a time a reporter and also worked as an editor for several publishers. His first novel, Our Mr. Wrenn (1914), was treated favorably by the critics but had few readers. At the same time he was writing with increasing success for such popular magazines as The Saturday Evening Post and Cosmopolitan. However, he never lost sight of his ambition to become a serious novelist. The publication of Main Street made his literary reputation. The power of the book derives from Lewis’ careful rendering of local speech, customs, and social amenities and his double-edged satire. Main Street became not just a novel but the textbook on provincial America.\n\nBabbitt, a study of the complacent American whose individuality has been taken away by Rotary clubs, business ideals, and general conformity is thought by many critics to be Lewis’ best novel. This was followed by Arrowsmith, a satire on the medical profession. Next was Elmer Gantry, an attack on ignorant and predatory Protestant church leaders. In Dodsworth Lewis contrasted United States and European values.\n\nLewis wrote steadily, averaging a book every two years for over 30 years and writing short stories as well. In his final years he lived much of his time abroad. After 1930 his reputation declined considerably; critics said his work was shallow and overly sentimental. Lewis died near Rome, Italy, on Jan. 10, 1951. A comprehensive biography of the author, Sinclair Lewis: an American Life (1961), was written by Mark Schorer."
