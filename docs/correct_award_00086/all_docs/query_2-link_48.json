The prizes in those years instead went to Edith Wharton for The Age of Innocence and Willa Cather for One of Ours, respectively.\n\nChosen for a Pulitzer Prize for Arrowsmith, he declined the award. A few years later he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first American to win this highly coveted honor.\n\nWe were very pleased when three of the leaders of the Sinclair Lewis Interpretive Center and Museum in Sauk Centre, Minnesota agreed to share with us, and you, their stories about this significant American writer whose themes and insights ring as true and biting today as they did almost a century earlier.\n\nIf the hallmark of a great writer is his or her ability to see, analyze and depict the hidden reality beneath the world around them, then Sinclair Lewis is certainly one of our nationâs great writers.\n\nHe was born in a small Scandinavian immigrant town in the northern prairies of Minnesota. His father was the local doctor, and although his mother died of tuberculosis when he was only six, his step-mother proved to be a major influence in his life of letters. An avid reader, Lewis knew that writing was to be his life early on. In high school he began writing for the local newspaper, and one of the people in this interview was the editor of that same publication nearly a century later.\n\nWhile a student at Yale he met and became friends with Jack London. As described in this interview, as well as our earlier interview on London, Lewis was asked by the very successful adventure novelist to submit plot ideas for pay. One of those Lewis sent became the basis to a Jack London novel published years after his death. During this time he also became acquainted with Upton Sinclair and was a janitor at his short-lived utopian community, Helican Hall.\n\nOne of Lewis's earliest novels, Main Street, became one of Americaâs first major best sellers, and quickly made Lewis a wealthy and respected writer. He followed this insightful look at small town life with a series of equally poignant studies. Among these were Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, and the fascinating and satirical idea of fascism coming to America, It Canât Happen Here. Many of his works were adapted for films, including a Disney animated movie."
