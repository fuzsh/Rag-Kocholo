        "text": "Explore the captivating life and literary journey of Sinclair Lewis, from Sauk Centre to the first American Nobel Prize winner in Literature.\n\nSauk Centre, Minnesota – Just outside of St. Cloud, in the charming central Minnesota town of Sauk Centre, a literary luminary was born – Sinclair Lewis. This Nobel Prize-winning author, known for his novels, plays, and short stories, was the first American to claim the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature. But there’s so much more to the story of this remarkable writer.\n\nEarly Days in Sauk Centre, MN\n\nBorn on February 7, 1885, as the youngest of three boys, Sinclair’s early life was shaped by his father, Edwin J. Lewis, the town’s doctor, and his stepmother, Isabel Warner, who became a significant influence. Sinclair’s journey as a writer began with a deep love for reading, which he nurtured while growing up in Sauk Centre.\n\nLeaving his hometown in 1902 to attend Oberlin Academy, Sinclair embarked on his path to becoming a writer. He further honed his skills at Yale, graduating in 1908. That summer he worked as an editor and writer at the local newspaper in Waterloo, Iowa. His first book, a young adult adventure novel, was published in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham. During the following years, he penned several more serious novels and gained recognition for his short stories published in magazines like the Saturday Evening Post.\n\nMain Street’s Gopher Prairie\n\nIn 1920, Sinclair Lewis achieved literary stardom with “Main Street,” a novel set in the fictional town of Gopher Prairie, loosely based on his Sauk Centre upbringing. The book, featuring a strong female protagonist inspired by his stepmother, made him both wealthy and internationally renowned. It’s estimated that two million Americans devoured the book in just a few months.\n\nCarol Milford, an orphaned daughter of a judge from Mankato, Minnesota, dreams of transforming towns after college. She becomes a librarian in Saint Paul but finds it unfulfilling. Marrying small-town doctor Will Kennicott, she moves to Gopher Prairie, modeled after Sauk Centre, her husband’s hometown, and attempts to modernize it, facing resistance and ridicule. She harbors a strong disdain for Gopher Prairie due to its physical unattractiveness and smug conservatism, which clash with her dreams of revitalizing and modernizing towns. Despite challenges and a brief departure, Carol remains undeterred in her pursuit of change.\n\nSinclair Lewis: Banned in Minnesota\n\nCertain residents of small towns in the Midwest took offense at this portrayal, leading to the book being banned from the public library in Alexandria, Minnesota.\n\nEither way, the 1920s were a golden decade for Lewis, marked by the publication of several successful novels like “Babbitt,” “Arrowsmith,” and “Elmer Gantry.” Hollywood even adapted some of his works into movies. Although he won a Pulitzer Prize for “Arrowsmith,” Lewis declined the honor, citing objections to the judging criteria.\n\nJoin Jack and Kitty’s Newsletter!\n\nNobel Prize in Literature\n\nA pinnacle in Lewis’s career came in 1930 when he became the first American to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. His Nobel Lecture, titled “The American Fear of Literature,” critiqued the reluctance in America to embrace literature that didn’t glorify all things American.\n\nAfter the Nobel, Lewis continued to write but faced personal challenges, including struggles with alcoholism and a tumultuous love life. He passed away in Rome on January 10, 1951, and his ashes found their final resting place in Sauk Centre.\n\nWhile Lewis’s reputation waned after his death, recent scholarship has reignited interest in his work. His 1935 dystopian novel, “It Can’t Happen Here,” gained newfound popularity during the 2016 presidential election, resonating with readers as a cautionary tale about fascism in America.\n\nA Visit to Sauk Centre, Minnesota\n\nSinclair Lewis’s legacy endures, reminding us of the power of literature to challenge and inspire, making him a true American literary treasure.\n\nToday if you find yourself in Sauk Centre, Minnesota – take a selfie in downtown next to the sign the proudly proclaims itself as the Original Main Street. Just look for it on the corner of Sinclair Lewis Avenue and Main Street.\n\nOh, and swing by the Palmer House hotel – Lewis worked there as a night clerk. Take another selfie. This time, with the Lewis portrait and imagine the budding author writing the night away…capturing life on Minnesota’s Main Street.\n\nSHARE This Article With Family And Friends…"
