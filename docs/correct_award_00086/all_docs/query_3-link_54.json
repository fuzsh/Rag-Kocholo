        "text": "September 10, 2014\n\nOn page 25 I thought – this guy is brilliant.\n\nOn page 50 I thought – this guy is exhaustively brilliant.\n\nOn page 100 I thought – I’m exhausted.\n\nOn page 150 I thought – I’ll never get out of this novel alive.\n\nOn page 200 I thought – so who knew there could be so much DETAIL about every last possible aspect of one teensy Minnesotan town lodged inside the Tardis-like head of Sinclair Lewis?\n\nOn page 213 my eye fell upon this :\n\nIt’s the worst defeat of all. I’m beaten. By Main Street. I must go on. But I can’t!\n\nSurprisingly Godotesque, and I imagine many readers of this large opus nodding their heads and smiling grimly.\n\nOn page 350 I thought – you know, I think the plot is picking up a little bit. If I’m reading this right, two things have actually happened in the last 70 pages.\n\nTHE DIRENESS OF SMALL TOWNS\n\nWell, that’s what this novel is ALL about.\n\n“Tell you, Carrie : there’s just three classes of people : folks that haven’t got any ideas at all; the cranks that kick about everything; and Regular Guys, the fellows with sticktuitiveness that boost and get the world’s work done.”\n\nIt (what's so bad about a small town) is a sluggishness of speech and manners, a rigid ruling of the spirit by the desire to appear respectable. It is contentment…the contentment of the quiet dead, who are scornful of the living of the restless walking. It is the prohibition of happiness. It is negation canonised as the one positive virtue. It is slavery self-taught and self-defended. It is dullness made God.\n\nThere’s a point on page 249 where Sinclair is ONCE again recounting how much his heroine hates Gopher Prairie, and kind of breaks down into a general jeremiad without even trying to put his thoughts into her mind. He just starts foaming and ranting.\n\nThe universal similarity – that is the physical expression of the philosophy of dull safety. Nine-tenths of American small towns are so alike that it is the completest boredom to wander from one to the other. Always there is the same lumber yard, the same railroad station, the same Ford garage, the same creamery, the same…. (etc etc for a long paragraph).\n\nTHE VICIOUS GOSSIP OF SMALL TOWNS\n\n“Have you heard the scandal about this Miss Mullins and Cy Bogart?”\n\n“I’m sure it is a lie.”\n\n“Oh, it probably is.” Maud’s manner indicated that the falsity of the story was an insignificant flaw in its general delightfulness.\n\nDIALECT : NOT A GOOD IDEA\n\n“Vell, so you come to town,”\n\n“Ya. Ay get a yob.\"\n\n”Vell…you got a fella now?”\n\n“Ya, Yim Yacobsen.”\n\n“Vell. I’m glat to see you. How much you vant a veek?”\n\n“Sex dollar.”\n\n“There ain’t nobody pay dat. Vait! Dr Kennicott. I t’ink he marry a girl from de Cities. Maybe she pay dat. Vell, You go take a valk.”\n\nAuthors, don’t do this. You are giving the impression that anyone who speaks with an accent is tuppence short of a shilling.\n\nAMY ADAMS FOR CAROL, I’D SAY\n\nThis is a novel about a perky and by all accounts fairly drop dead young woman named Carol who marries a guy who is a country doctor and is so eyejabbingly tedious that I was surprised she was still alive at the end of one year of marriage when there was in the small town of Gopher Prairie a full supply of sharp agricultural implements, guns with live ammo, and even a couple of four storey buildings which would surely bust your neck should you spring from their tops.\n\nShe sashays into the her hubby's home town with grand but vague ideas of \"improving\" it. Well, you know that expression \"don't let the bastards grind you down? Turns out the bastards live in Gopher Springs. Whole town is full of them.\n\nThis is a novel where the idea is like James Joyce said with Ulysses, that if Dublin burned to the ground they could rebuild it by consulting his book. In this case it’s all small towns in the north of the USA and all the interiors of every building - every square inch of Minnesota is gone over with utter thoroughness.\n\nI LIKE A GOOD LIST\n\nSinclair Lewis is very big on lists.\n\nFur coats, fur caps, fur mittens, overshoes buckling almost to the laces, grey knitted scarves ten feet long, thick woollen socks, canvas jackets lineed with yellow wool like the plumage of ducklings, moccasins, red flannel wristlets for the blazing chapped wrists of boys…\n\nThe Commercial Club banquet and the Minniemashie House, an occasion for menus printed in gold (but injudiciously proof-read) for free cigars, soft damp slabs of Lake Superior whitefish served as fillet of sole, drenched cigar-ashes gradually filling the saucers of coffe cups, and oratorical references to Pep, Punch, Go, Vigour, Enterprise, Red Blood, He-Men, Fair Women, God’s Country, James J Hill, the Blue Sky, the Green Fields, the Bountiful Harvest, Increasing Population, Fair Return on Investments, Alien Agitators who Threaten the Security of our Institutions, the Hearthstone the Foundation of the State, Senator Knute Nelson, One Hundered Per Cent Americanism, and Pointing with Pride.\n\nWhen you follow a character into a room in Main Streetyou are lucky to escape without a complete inventory of furnishings and fixtures\n\nThe trouble is that often grinding down poor Carol becomes indistinguishable from grinding down the poor reader. Sinclair Lewis falls into the trap that John Lennon did in his primal scream phase, say, on Cold Turkey and Mother. In his case it was yelling and moaning about what psychic pain he was in. In this case it’s boring us half to death in protest about the psychological suffocation anyone with half a brain will suffer in these innumerable burgs. Cries of “All right already!” and “You’ve already said that twenty-five times Mr Lewis” may be heard escaping involuntarily from the reader’s pursing lips.\n\nTWO MORE MOANERS\n\n1. Surely a direct descendant of Main Street is Garrison Keillor’s Lake Wobegon, also located in Minnesota. Yes, GK paints his town with a wry avuncular affection, but in his first novel GK has his stand-in denounce Lake Wobegon remarkably bitterly in terms Sinclair Lewis would have thought he’s written (except that GK is funnier). These come in a passage called 95 Theses 95. Here’s three examples:\n\nYou have subjected me to endless boring talk about the weather, regularity, back problems, and whether something happened in 1938 or 1939, insisting that I sit quietly and listen to every word.\n\n\"How's it going with you?\" you said. \"Oh, about the same,\" you replied. \"Cold enough for you?\" It was always cold, always about the same.\n\nYou have taught me to value a good night's sleep over all else including adventures of love and friendship, and even when the night is charged with magic, to be sure to get to bed. If God had not meant everyone to be in bed by ten-thirty, He would never have provided the ten o'clock newscast.\n\nYou have provided me with poor male role models, including the Sons of Knute, the Boosters Club and others whose petulance, inertia, and ineptitude are legendary. I was taught to respect them: men who clung to tiny grudges for decades and were devoted to vanity, horsefeathers, small potatoes--not travel but the rites of trunk-loading and map-reading and gas mileage; not faith but the Building Committee; not love but supper.\n\n2. Bizarrely, I could not but think of Thomas Bernhardt, whose legendary hatred of his own country Austria is poured forth in novel after novel. Main Street is in the same ball park. Except there’s no love in Austria.\n\nIMMERSIVE NOVELS\n\nAre not read for the plot but for the forensic detail of lives lived. Because of that they run the risk of boring us rigid; they’re the slow heavy beasts, the dray horses of literature – The Old Wives’ Tale and A House for Mr Biswas; and now, Main Street. The whole thing is in the immense accretion of detail. They have to win you over. Main Street won me over. In the end I loved it. Whew. Ain’t going to read another Sinclair Lewis novel any time soon, but... yeah.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nThe action of this more than 400-page pavement takes place before and shortly after the First World War, in a small town in Minnesota called Gopher Prairie, where one might think that Sinclair Lewis has put a lot of his native background.\n\nFor his people and Dr. William Kennicott, when he describes it to Carol Milford, whom he met in St. Paul, Illinois, and whom he dreams of marrying, Gopher Prairie is the most beautiful city in the world. Deep America. A whole, deep city, cheerfully colored, carefully maintained, and populated by a small, lively, cultivated, and warm earth.\n\nWhen Carol, now Mrs. Kennicott, arrives in Gopher Prairie after their honeymoon in Colorado, she strives to see the city as her husband has presented it to her—and as he sees it.\n\nBut Carol is anti-conformist-born and romantic, too, and imagines that good intentions, new ideas, a little youth, and immense goodwill will overcome the a priori. The idioms and laziness of this small town where sidewalks go up the \"high street\" are still in wood, as in the time of the pioneers. Despite its horror, ready to love, Gopher Prairie prepared to sympathize sincerely with its inhabitants. It will soon realize that all this is more difficult than expected; good intentions are not enough when they clash with conformism and well-thought.\n\nSinclair Lewis draws the portrait of a rigorous and stuck American society in a tongue-in-cheek way that allows the reader to take a critical distance - sometimes too much. He was born there, lived there, and then, somewhere, he is attached. But no proverb says, \"Who likes to chastise well?\"\n\nHere are the pillars of the significant relationship between money and social success already held by the Americans of the time: worship for a single Bible and only church, fear, and contempt for the old continent. The pioneers came from the terrible empire of the \"what do we say\" (not specific, that one, it is true, small US cities) and a macho and patriarchal world vision to which Carol will finally, though reluctantly, submit.\n\nIt should be noted that, from the beginning, Lewis posits as a principle that Carol's sex is an additional burden in the fight she intends to lead.\n\nFebruary 24, 2019\n\nSinclair Lewis explores his love and hate of small midwestern American towns as women's fiction.\n\nMarch 17, 2017\n\n\"A bomb to blow up smugness\" is what one woman hopefully calls her child in Sinclair Lewis's broadside attack on mainstream America, and that's surely what this book is.\n\nI didn't know a book can be quiet and bombastic at the same time, but Lewis has written it. It covers just over a decade in Carol Milford's life, as her dreams are repeatedly drowned. She comes to Main Street, America, with grand plans to mean something in a dimly socialist way. Main Street is having none of it.\n\nLewis has a message. It's about socialism, and it joins Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath as one of the few socialist novels that aren't terrible. And it's about accepting difference, class struggle, and more than anything, feminism. He's trying to create a feminist hero here. He gets a little heavy-handed about it at times, but just a little. It's not enough to make this less than a five-star book; it's just enough to keep it off my top Novels Written For Grown-Ups list. Ishiguro's Remains of the Day is tighter.\n\nThe message here has something in common with Middlemarch. Here's Eliot's thing, right?\n\n\"The effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\"\n\nAnd here's Carol Milford:\"I may not have fought the good fight, but I have kept the faith.\"\n\nShe had fancied that her life might make a story. She knew that there was nothing heroic or obviously dramatic in it, no magic of rare hours, nor valiant challenge, but it seemed to her that she was of some significance because she was commonplaceness, the ordinary life of the age, made articulate and protesting.\n\nThese are characters who find fulfillment in making it through a real life with a semblance of self-respect. That's grown-up stuff. I mean, not that I'd know, but that's what I hear from old people.\n\nWhich, I mean, the danger of an unexceptional life is that it makes boring reading, and one criticism of Main Street has been that it's plotless. I get that, but I think it's a narrow definition of plot. I thought of Madame Bovary while reading this, because they're both intimate looks at dissatisfied women by men who don't totally get it; that book has the dramatic events people are missing here. But I think it's a worthy achievement to pull off a novel without the help of big pageturning drama, and I think Lewis has done it.\n\nTo his credit, Lewis doesn't make anyone an obvious archetype. Carol is his hero, but she's flighty, changing, a pain in the ass. A lesser writer might have written her husband as an oppressor, but Kendicott is a terrific guy: his ambitions are different than hers, but he does his very best. Even the terrible ladies of Main Street have depth and shading.\n\nMain Street is often funny. It's brilliantly written: just in terms of making sentences, Sinclair Lewis is gorgeous. It's much less obvious than it could have been, but still a bit thudding here and there. It's feminist without totally getting women.\n\nIt was a smash hit when it was published, somewhat surprisingly given its full-frontal attack on half the country, but then that's sortof the point of Main Street: we all live on it, but many of us consider ourselves, smugly, above it.\n\nps Years later, I tried to convince my wife that a great middle name for our kid would be \"Bomb To Blow Up Smugness.\" She disagreed.\n\nOctober 13, 2015\n\nThis was Lewis first novel, published in 1920, and it was a huge success, both critically and commercially. It made him a rich man and launched a career that would include the Nobel Prize for literature in 1930. Lewis felt that Main Street should have won the Pulitzer Prize in 1921 but was edged out by Edith Wharton's, The Age of Innocence. It so incensed Lewis that when he did win it in 1925 for Arrowsmith, he refused to accept the award.\n\nMain Street was the first major novel that featured small town America, and the public loved it. While his contemporaries, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wharton were writing about New York and Paris and the upper crust aristocracy, Lewis focused on the heartland. Willa Cather probably came as close to Lewis as anyone in capturing the essence of the period and the people in the expanding Midwest.\n\nSeptember 24, 2019\n\nMain Street, Sinclair Lewis\n\nMain Street is a satirical novel written by Sinclair Lewis, and published in 1920. Satirizing small town life, Main Street is perhaps Sinclair Lewis's most famous book, and led in part to his eventual 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature. It relates the life and struggles of Carol Milford Kennicott in the small town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota, as she comes into conflict with the small-town mentality of its residents.\n\nMain Street ‬‏‫‭: the story of Carol Kennicott, Sinclair Lewis, ‏‫‬‭New York‏‫‬‭: Panter Books‏‫‬‭, 1961‏‫‭ = 1340, 445 Pages.\n\nتاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال 1972 میلادی\n\nعنوان: خیابان اصلی؛ نویسنده: س‍ی‍ن‍ک‍ل‍ر ل‍وی‍س‌؛\n\nهری سینکلر لوئیس (زاده روز هفتم ماه فوریه سال 1885 میلادی - درگذشته به روز دهم ماه ژانویه سال 1951 میلادی) رمان نویس، داستان‌نویس و نمایش نامه نویس آمریکایی بودند. ایشان نخستین آمریکایی بودند که موفق شدند نوبل ادبیات را به دست آورند. «خیابان اصلی» عنوان یک رمان طنز است که توسط «سینکلر لوئیس» نوشته شده، و در سال 1920 منتشر شده است. «خیابان اصلی» ممکن است مشهورترین کتاب «سینکلر لوئیس» باشد که شاید انتشار آن به جایزه ی نهایی نوبل ادبیات در سال 1930 میلادی منجر شد. داستان زندگی و مبارزات «کارول میلفورد کنیکوت» در شهر کوچک «گوفر پریری»، مینسوتا را بازگو میکند، هنگامی که او با ذهنیت شهر و ساکنانش درگیر میشود. ا. شربیانی\n\nMarch 9, 2021\n\nI enjoyed Age of Innocence better than Main Street so I guess I have to agree with the final Pulitzer decision on this one. Sinclair Lewis was so pissed off to lose this one that he refused the prize three years later for Arrowsmith. Main Street is interesting, but for me, a frustrating read as I had a hard time really connecting with its protagonist. I found her idealism a bit vapid and that she gave up rather easily. Her husband was a boob and I think that in Arrowsmith, it is a far more interesting portrayal of a middle-class couple. I enjoyed the various families and their small-town almost Proustian/Combray pretentiousness, but the narrative kind of dragged on. Fortunately, I really enjoyed Babbit and am not enjoying Arrowsmith otherwise, had I based my opinion of Sinclair Lewis just on this book, I may not have continued reading him.\n\nMay 31, 2018\n\nI definitely liked this book and recommend it to others. There is so much to think about; it can be discussed from many different angles. So what are its topics? First of all, life in small towns versus life in cities. This is what the book is said to be about. Love is another theme. It is not a soppy love story though! Maturing, becoming an adult, figuring out how to live in a real world, not a world of only idealistic dreams. It is about growing up, not the teen years, but the years after that. Figuring out who you are and how you are going to live your life and how you are going to meld dreams with reality. It is about relationships. It is about women's rights and all individuals’ need for fulfillment. And it’s about appreciating culture and art and the value of beauty. Yeah, it’s about friendship too. I guess I could keep adding more to the list!\n\nFor me, what I liked best about the book is that opposing views are fairly portrayed. You see the pluses and the minuses of both sides.\n\nIt comes down to this. What do you do when husband and wife don't want to live in the same place? Is one wrong and the other right? How do you compromise so both can live a satisfying life? You have one life; you have to be satisfied with that one life. More than just being satisfied, you have to like it!\n\nThis is a great book for group reads. Views will certainly diverge. Lots to discuss. Debate, I am sure, will be lively.\n\nSo why only three stars? It should have been tightened. Parts drag. A third could/should have been eliminated, not particularly in the beginning nor at the end but throughout. I came to understand both the husband's and the wife's and their friends' views perfectly. Fewer examples could surely have been given.\n\nThe narration of the audiobook by Brian Emerson was fine.... but you do know what that really means. It means that while I didn't love it I have no serious complaints. The narrator almost sings the words. You could say I didn't like the melody. I wish he had just plain read the words. Still I understood everything and the speed was perfect. The narration is not a reason to avoid the audiobook. I just didn't love it.\n\nI must say I was hesitant to read this. I love life out in the country, but I do know how petty small towns' folk can behave. I also love life in a big city. I value art and culture and design and beauty. Beauty has value. I was unsure if both sides could, in an unbiased and fair manner, be accurately drawn.\n\nThis book was published in 1920, and the author received the Nobel Prize in 1930. He was in fact the first US recipient. Sinclair Lewis was way ahead of his time. The book doesn’t feel dated. I think this is because human needs then and now are the same even if societal standards and circumstances have changed.\n\nSeptember 16, 2018\n\nClassics Cleanup Challenge #11\n\nAudio #159\n\nI didn’t like all of the arguing. For some reason it really upset me.\n\nAugust 18, 2016\n\nI was dimly aware of Sinclair Lewis but completely unfamiliar with his work when I read John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley: In Search of America a couple of years ago. Steinbeck, who admired Lewis, wanted to find his way from St Paul to Sauk Centre, Lewis' Minnesota hometown and the town on which the fictional location of this novel, Gopher Prairie, is based. He recounts his conversation with a waitress in a diner who gave him directions to the town: \"They got a sign up. I guess quite a few folks come to see it. It does the town some good.\" The diner's cook volunteered that he didn't think \"what's-his-name\" was there anymore. Steinbeck recollected how negatively Sauk Centre had reacted to Lewis and to \"Main Street\" when it was published in 1920 and commented \"Now he's good for the town. Brings in some tourists. He's a good writer now.\" The way Sauk Centre embraced Sinclair Lewis is similar to the way in which the Salinas Valley embraced Steinbeck, after its initial hugely negative reaction to the publication of The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nA reader's response to this novel and in particular to its main character will depend to a large extent on their experience of and feelings towards life in a small town. Did you grow up in a small town or now live in one and absolutely love it? Then you'll probably dislike Carol Kennicott, a young librarian who in 1912 marries a dull but competent doctor, goes to live in Gopher Prairie and wants to change it and the people who live there. Can you imagine nothing worse than living in a place where everyone knows and judges everyone else? Then you'll understand Carol and feel for her, even if she also frustrates and annoys you. Having spent most of my life in a large city, I'm in the latter camp. Although I didn't find Carol particularly likeable - at least not all the time - I responded sympathetically to her. Had I been in her situation, I would probably have reacted as she did.\n\nLewis captured all that he saw as negative in small town life and called it Main Street: narrow-mindedness, provincialism, bigotry, hypocrisy, self-satisfaction and resistance to change. However, his portrayal of those who encapsulate those characteristics is not exclusively negative. Nor is his portrayal of Carol Kennicott overwhelmingly positive. The plot may be rambling, the style uneven and the satire and social commentary broad and unsubtle, but Lewis' rendering of his central characters is not without nuance. In my view, that's where much of the strength of the work resides. This is one of those works which I'm glad I've read, even if it hasn't left me particularly anxious to read more of its writer's work. A 3.5 star literary experience with a few 5 star moments.\n\nMay 15, 2011\n\nSmall-town America. Ah, the scent of pine. The musty ramshackle old hardware store.\n\nBut what is this? Something amiss in one of these romanticized burgs? Something dark and sinister?\n\n\"I never imagined something like this would happen in our town,\" says the half-toothless talking head on the six o'clock news about the murder, even though you've seen this very thing happen in small towns 10,000 times in your life on the six o'clock news.\n\nSmall-town America is supposed to be different somehow; supposed to be better.\n\nFuck small-town America!\n\nThe real murder is not the cheerleader of Podunkville High who was raped and slain. The real murder is something more sinister and pervasive--not even a loss of innocence, because the innocence remains; dazed and confused, but always there; always cluelessly upbeat, always blaming the wrong causes for its woes. The real murder on Main Street America is a suicide; the suicide of small-town America; the murder of small-town America by its own hands.\n\nLet the values voters of small-town America's Main Street keep on shooting themselves in the foot and dragging the rest of us down with them by electing right-wing corporate-puppet elites who don't give a tinker's damn about them or anybody else. Let the crackerbarrel bigots of Main Street stew in the backwash of their own hate. Let Walmart keep grinding into dust their shitty little stores. Let the untrammeled free-enterprise that you Main Streeters voted for put you out of work. Let you pull yourselves up by your bootstraps; the ones caked with McDonald's hamburger grease from the burgers you're now flipping for $5 an hour. Let the top 1 percent's mantra reign supreme: \"What's good for us is good for the nation, and the world! (Oh, and thank you Main Street America, you suckers!)\"\n\nLet them continue to confuse ignorance for truth, faith for knowledge, creationism for science, heterosexuality as love's exclusive domain, poverty for charity, hope for ruthlessness. Let them believe that theirs is a self-righteousness and arrogance earned, not by reflection or learning but merely by believing and never budging and by insisting that you are wrong and the God is on their side only. Let the red states cover us with their nasty redness.\n\nWhen Sinclair Lewis wrote Main Street nearly a century ago now, Main Street was thriving, the commercial pulse of the nation. A veritable galaxy of hubbub dots across the map.\n\nLewis did not predict the demise of Main Street in this formidable novel, but in capturing its soul, a soul bereft of healthy curiosity, of a sense of its own promise, of a desire to see itself in the bigger picture, he tells us how it sowed the seeds of its own destruction, and by extension the decline of America.\n\nCarol Kennicott, the city girl with the dreams and ideals of youth, the desire to share and to energize, the beautiful naivete of a progressive who wants to leave the world a better place than she found it, is Main Street's protagonist, a lovely soul after my own heart; a woman who wants to put the soul into a soulless place that wants none of it.\n\nIn fact, I love love love Carol Kennicott.\n\nI could read an entire novel in which Carol Kennicott does nothing but prepare a tea service, or pick furniture, or shop for canned goods.\n\nWell, actually, a lot of Main Street seems to be about just that: Carol Kennicott fixating on ever-tinier rituals within a domestic universe that shrinks to ever-smaller dollhouse-sized proportions. Full of world-beating notions out of college and fragrant with a modicum of sophistication, Carol marries a decent, reliable, uninspiring Midwestern doctor from the sticks of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. Sold a bill of goods about the goodness of the town, the two go off to live there and Carol's dread of being domiciled within it is painfully rewarded with corroborating verification. The place is backward, banal, quietly venal, stiflingly tasteless, mercilessly moral and hypocritical, and deeply suspicious of city girls and city ideas. Gopher Prairie exists in the real 1920s; the 1920s of Zane Grey novels, not the 1920s of James Joyce or The New Yorker.\n\nThe novel is about Carol's struggle to fit into this place, to negotiate between her desires to be individual and to conform, to be true to herself or to be popular, to reflect credit on her husband while aiming mightily to drag the town kicking and screaming into the 20th century. Instead, it drags her down into the dusty dregs of conformity. Beaten down by homogeneity, as a raison d'etre eludes her, as higher youthful ideals decompose via bacterial reality, Carol becomes a tragic figure; a symbol of spayed pre-liberated womanhood, a Stepford Wife of the sticks. In a reality devoid of greater meaning or purpose, her world-beating ideas are reduced to finding doilies with patterns that best match those on the sofa armrest.\n\nLewis' book is a masterwork, too little read by today's readers. Main Street takes place in a world that may seem as appealing to engage as an arcane, tropical article in a yellowing magazine. But its world is essentially unchanged from today. The masses were asses then and they are still asses now; just as pliable, just as gullible, just as lazy, just as venal and just as lulled into low expectations.\n\nIt's hardly a piquant or ingenious observation that Sinclair Lewis is unsubtly contemptuous of this rural menagerie, but he shoots fish in a barrel with an impressively embroidered firearm. He bores deeply into this town, this world, and this woman's place in it.\n\nThe thing took me forever to read--many months--but the effort was worthwhile. It's a classic.\n\nNow, go out and canvass for Sarah Palin. Whoopeee!\n\nMarch 30, 2021\n\nThis book was intensely personal to me – so much so that I found myself closing the book so I could just stare at the wall and think at points. The plot concerns the struggles of a woman, Carol, against the strange omniscience and rigidity of a small Midwestern town. She is a city-girl who marries a country doctor and optimistically sets out for a new life on the prairie, circa World War I. Upon settling in, she realizes that her ideas for “improving” the town through the introduction of high culture, town planning, and the generally sophisticated example of her own conduct are completely without any hope of succeeding. She is shocked to find that the citizens of Gopher Prairie are not only resistant to her improving influence, they are actually quite happy to wallow in their rusticity. And so begins her decline.\n\nHer ideas and ambitions seem silly and condescending in a 21st century view, but there is so much of Carol that reminds me of myself as a teenager it almost makes me uncomfortable. I spent a large part of my adolescence planning my escape from my own Gopher Prairie; Europe and the East Coast were my Promised Lands like they were Carol’s, and I felt that somehow I had been born in the Midwest by some cruel accident of fate.\n\nBut Carol and I diverge at one important point; I have the isolated fields and towns of the Midwest in my blood, and Carol did not. And because of this, I spent equal parts of the book sympathizing with her and feeling indignant that she could never find the good in anything around her. I naturally find my own feelings on the desperation of living in such a place excusable, but it doesn’t seem fair to hear them from an outsider.\n\nI condemned Carol all the way through the second half of the novel, including her moping, rather pathetic attempt at a love affair, and dull try at a life of emancipation in DC. Surely at some point she would grow up and realize that a person can have ideals, practice them, and still not make herself and everyone around her miserable. And she does come around at the end, but not in a very satisfying way; I felt that her return at the end of the book was more an act of settling than of finding peace with the place.\n\nIt was only after I had finished and had time to properly digest the story that I began to feel rather sorry for being so harsh. I’ve come to appreciate my hometown through the benefit of time and distance, and look forward to moving back someday. But poor Carol had none of my coping mechanisms; no Goodreads, BBC World News, Football365, Masterpiece Classics on PBS, interlibrary loan, free nights & weekends cell phone plans, a profession, email, Barnes&Noble.com, quick travel, or - most importantly - an income and checking account. In Carol’s time and place I might have gone crazy as well. The Midwest now has the appeal of geographic isolation without the horror of isolation from thought and influence from the outside world.\n\nI’m giving this book five stars because it made me think.\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nPainfully true in all its dreary details! The Gopher Prairies of the world are suffocating even in their fictional form. Carol has not the slightest chance. She should have stayed away when she had her chance. The devil came in the shape of security and routine.\n\nNovember 8, 2020\n\nI finally finished, took over 6 months. I understand the bliss of mundane, sometimes I have been known to seek it, but this one gave me a headache. Don't get me wrong, it has it's brilliance.\n\n\"I think perhaps we want a more conscientious life. We're tired of drudging and sleeping and dying. We're tired of always deferring hope to the next generation. We're tired of hearing the politicians and priests and cautious reformers (and the husbands!) coax us, 'Be calm! Be patient! Wait! We have plans for a Utopia already made; just give us a bit more time and we'll produce it; trust us; we're wiser than you.' For ten thousand years they've said that. We want our Utopia now - and we're going to try our hands at it. All we want is - everything for all of us! For every housewife and every longshoreman and every Hindu nationalist and every teacher. We want everything. We sha'n't get it. So we sha'n't ever be content -”\n\nMarch 8, 2022\n\nI figured it was about time, after sixty years on planet earth, that I read a book by Sinclair Lewis. Probably one of the reasons I never did, was because after all the literature classes I took none of his work was ever discussed.\n\nIn 1930, Mr. Lewis won the Nobel Prize for literature, and \"Main Street,\" was mentioned as one of his great accomplishment.\n\nMr. Lewis is the type of writer I am usually attracted to. His writing is very descriptive like many of my favorite writers like Conrad, Proust, and Fitzgerald, yet the first 100 pages of \"Main Street,\" were like looking at a one minute sequence of a car passing down the same street 100 times. I was seriously thinking of putting it down when it seriously exploded off the pages and the main character, Carol Kennicott, starts to really come to life...almost having an affair with a young tailor whose ambition is to be some type of artist.\n\nShe originally moved to the town of 'Gopher Prairie,' when she married her husband Will Kennicott, a wonderful and dedicated doctor and a lifelong resident of the town. He's smart but in none of the ways that Carol is interested in. He's interested in medicine, making money, and taking care of cars. Carol loves to read the poetry of Keats and Shelley, and many of the famous authors of her era which is the early 1900's and before.\n\nWhat Will sees as wonderful, she sees as dull. She wants to change the character and substance of the town, but all the residence are like Will and see little wrong with their lovely town that Carol finds dull and backwards.\n\nMr Lewis' ability to create a small town in Minnesota is almost picture perfect, and after the first one hundred pages when the characters become energized, with conscious feelings about sex, lost of youth, and complacence, and the real evil that can be caused by gossip and false beliefs come to a boiling head I was hoping the book would go on for another one hundred pages.\n\nNovember 2, 2018\n\nI read this many, many years ago and remember that I didn't like it at all. Boring.\n\nOctober 10, 2021\n\nSo Carol is a kind of both romantic (as in someone who loves beautiful things) and idealist - the two things that disconnect you from the world. Her attempts to change her small town are thus often Quioxitic - seeing the futility of her efofrts to change her town exhausts her and she gives up. Very quickly. Again and again. But that is the case with most (but not all) such dreamers.\n\nI just wish it was a bit shorter work.\n\nNovember 23, 2013\n\nMain Street is more of a social commentary than a novel. While not great art, it is thought provoking and offers a revealing historical perspective. It made me realize sadly just how persistent is the stagnation of the human spirit that afflicts so much of America.\n\nLewis straightforwardly tells his satiric story of life in Gopher Prairie Minnesota in which a city girl who marries a country doctor is constantly thwarted in her efforts to rise above the townspeople’s dreary existence. These passages sum it up pretty well. “It is an unimaginatively standardized background, a sluggishness of speech and manners, a rigid ruling of the spirit by the desire to appear respectable. It is contentment…contentment of the quiet dead, who are scornful of the living for their relentless walking. It is negation canonized as the one positive virtue. It is the prohibition of happiness. It is slavery self-taught and self-defended. It is dullness made God. A savorless people, gulping tasteless food, and sitting afterword coatless and thoughtless…and viewing themselves as the greatest race in the world.” He goes on, “…the citizens are proud of that achievement of ignorance which is easy to come by. To be ‘intellectual’ or ‘artistic’ or, in their own words, to be ‘highbrow’ is to be priggish and of dubious virtue…The cloud of supreme ignorance submerges them in unhappiness and futility.”\n\nWhat is striking and disturbing is how easily we recognize the pettiness in Main Street 100 years later. The thinking of Gopher Prairie’s inhabitants of a century ago still exists in countless towns today where 19th century concepts of God and country predominate and disdain for “highbrow” ideas still resonates. The Tea Party provides ample evidence that the rural-urban divide is stronger than ever.\n\nAt the end Carrie, the scrappy heroine who finally succumbs to the banal life, talks of her new daughter living until the year 2000 in a new enlightened world when people may be flying to Mars. She got it half right. Technology would advance dramatically, but people not nearly so much. Lewis would have undoubtedly been very disappointed if he could see how little we have changed.\n\nFebruary 3, 2023\n\nSinclair Lewis's first acknowledged classic, Main Street remains a timeless indictment of the prejudices and complacency of small-town America. His protagonist, Carol Kennicott, is an educated, progressive-minded city girl who marries a dull doctor, then relocates to the tiny burg of Gopher Falls. Carol is quickly disillusioned of her husband's tiresome friends and narrow-minded neighbors, all outward charm and inward condemnation, finding that they stomp upon even the mildest suggestions of individuality as amoral or subversive. She forms fleeting friendships with Miles Bjornstam, a strapping farmer disdained by the townspeople for his radical politics, and Erik Valborg, a bookish young man who is ruthlessly gay-baited for his appearance and taste for books - neither lasts, leaving Carol more unfulfilled than before. Lewis's book is not easy reading: there's some sardonic humor strewn throughout, but most of his narrative showcases the slow, painful smothering of Carol's personality, as she debates the merits of libraries, the suitability of Bernard Shaw for dramatic performance and the role of women in society with \"friends\" who wield gossip and sneering imprecation as weapons. Some readers will grow frustrated with Carol's reluctance to rebel; for all her outsider status, most of her transgressions are minor, but that's the point. The conformist impulses of Main Street, along with the institutions of marriage and motherhood (Carol's marriage is unhappy although she cherishes her children), destroy the desire to rebel. Easier to go along than get along, even if doing so costs your soul. Main Street ends with an explosive denouement which finally allows Carol a chance to display her independence...only to find that escaping Gopher Falls isn't as easy as she should imagine. A devastating, deeply-felt indictment of conservatism in its most insidious manifestation - not loudmouthed demagogues or reactionary politicians, but the simple, unmovable stodginess of everyday life.\n\nNovember 29, 2018\n\nI actually only came upon this wonderful read/listen that is Sinclair's classic novel titled \"Main Street\" because it happened to be a monthly choice for my library book club.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this particular piece of work by Lewis, and after reading, completely see why he was the first author to ever receive the \"Literary Nobel Prize.\"\n\nHowever, most of my fellow book club members were not as enthralled with this particular work, and I guess he may not suit everyones' tastes. \"Different strokes for different folks.\" as they say.\n\nMy impressions of Main Street was that it is exceptionally Smart, enjoyable and entertaining start to finish, as well as chock full of satirical, dry humor. That being said, Lewis's humor has a clear purpose, carrying strong, wonderfully descriptive messages on human nature.\n\nIt is clear that Mr. Sinclair had immense appreciation and fondness for the people and places he brings to us in his stories, and yet he pulls no punches in outing them for being the flawed, insecure people they are. He does a terrific job pointing out that humans are not all good or bad, most having moral/ethical sides as well as egotistical/self-centered and condescending propensities. Sinclair did not miss a beat in creating believable, realistic and relatable statements about human nature.\n\nThis book is as relatable today as it must have been when Lewis finished penning it back in 1920. #Classic\n\nAugust 27, 2018\n\nSet in the second decade of the 20th century, this is a reflection on small town life and an exploration of the restrictions women face. A young, college educated woman who has lived and worked in St. Paul, marries a small town doctor and moves to a provincial town of 3,000 people. Her first impression is that the town is ugly, the people dull and the atmosphere clostrophobic. But with her experience of city life, a college education and a libral upbringing, she sets out to reform and modernize this community. The town regards her efforts as patronizing, her attitude as superior and her vision as threatening their way of life. Lewis captures these people adeptly, from the gossipy card circle to the sanctimonious elderly neighbor, from the spinster school teacher to the critical eye of the handiman who lives on the edge of the town. I am especially surprised at how sensitively Lewis captures the ambitions and frustrations, the desire to fit in and the desire to transform, the marital tension and the power of social standing felt by the female protagonist. Even though this is primarily Carol’s story, the town seen from her perspective, Lewis manages to show the reader the humanity of these small-minded, parochial towns folk also. I was surprised by its relevance and its outstanding character development. Initially, I thought it was going to get bogged down in flowery descriptions, but the lovely picture of turn-of-the-century Midwestern landscapes soon gave way to humorous, tender, ambitious, misunderstood, complex lives.\n\nMarch 4, 2008\n\nI had just moved to a small town in Minnesota - with the same aspirations as this classic charater of many years before me, yet my thoughts and run ins were very much the same 50 years later. It was a reminder that one fits or one doesn't fit but to spend your life trying to change the engrained to your likely only means you will spend your life in turmoil, in hopes others after you, long after you will find the place more to your liking. Shortly afterwards - I moved.\n\nDecember 10, 2014\n\nactually kinda won me over at the end, once the main character actually, y'know, DID SOMETHING. but the first 200 or so pages of \"small-town satire,\" which is just a buncha dad-bern idjits talkin' like this is some of the most annoying shit i've ever read in my life.\n\nbeyond comprehension that this guy won a nobel prize. though i guess english wasn't the jury's first language.\n\nOctober 6, 2016\n\nThis book went on too long for me -- I ended up losing interest in and patience with Carol. I felt like I should sympathize with her but didn't in fact do so.\n\nLloyd James was very good with the narration which did help me persevere through.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nThis book describes life in the small town of Gopher Plains, Minnesota, during the period 1912 – early 1920. Minneapolis resident and protagonist Carol marries an older man, Doctor W.P. Kennicott, and moves from the city to his small town, where he practices medicine. She is much more progressive than the townspeople. She is interested in art, literature, politics, and world issues. The small town is more focused on family, church, and the community. She is subjected to gossip, which she finds out from a local busybody that people are disparaging her. She is criticized for wanting to change the town and not attending church regularly. She tries to inject some of her own views and personality into her interactions with the townspeople, such as throwing themed parties and attempting to get the poetry group to actually read poetry rather than focus on the lives of the poets. She tries to inject a few changes, but she is fighting an uphill battle with no reinforcements.\n\nIt is a character-driven book about a woman who does not fit into the conservative small-town society. She has held a job and abhors asking her husband for money to buy household supplies. It was an era when women did not have the right to vote at the national level, and were called “Mrs. So-and-So,” as if they had no identity away from their husbands. The plot is slim, and the characters are well-developed. The storyline follows Carol’s many attempts to change her environment to achieve the life she desires. The arguments between Carol and the doctor are particularly realistic. It was published in 1920 and I always find it interesting to read about life in the past written by authors who lived it.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 16, 2011\n\nI can't properly rate this book, because I did not enjoy it (or finish it yet), but I appreciate the satire and how its \"commentary\" on small minded people still holds true today.\n\nTo me, Lewis didn't try to build deep, interesting characters, he built representations about everything that reeks in society. This is a book that says, \"You think you can change the way people think? Well, follow me to Main Street, and we will see about that.\" He treated the protagonists and antagonists with the same sarcastic take, even though we know his world view was similar to Carol's.\n\nI see why this book has a place in literature as a classic, but my reading time is so precious, I want to enjoy the book. This bogged me down too much. A definite read for \"American Literature 101\" in your first year of college, but not for a working mom who wants to curl up with a good book after the kids are in bed. I guess I got sucked in to what Lewis warned us about. I am 40, I get it. I went to my rallys at UMASS. I wore my heart on my sleeve and screamed at the injustice of it all. Now I am too damn tired to give a sh*%. Life does that to you.\n\nFebruary 6, 2008\n\nKept feeling like a disappoving old lady reading this book: \"This young man writes very well, but I don't like his tone.\" Smug. Unutterably smug, and he doesn't seem to like or care about any of his characters, which makes the whole exercise rather cold. I suppose, ninety years later, the \"small towns are narrow-minded and hypocritical\" theme has been done to death, and Lewis deserves credit for pioneering the genre, but on the whole I didn't like it.\n\nSeptember 24, 2011\n\nI wanted to like this book but the overt condescension of the author was difficult to get through. I also struggled to relate to the whining malcontent of a protagonist or to the unlikeable, small-minded gossips Lewis peoples the town with. This book may have its place in the history of literature but frankly it's a joyless, tedious read."
