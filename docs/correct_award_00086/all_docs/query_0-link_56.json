        "text": "Lewis, Sinclair\n\nElmer Gantry\n\nNew York: Harcourt, Brace and Company / The Quinn and Boden Co., Inc., 1927. First Edition. Hard Cover. Very Good / No Jacket. Item #2291380\n\nFirst edition, second state (G in Gantry corrected from looking like a C, as in first state). Lacks scarce jacket. Boards lightly soiled, page edges faintly foxed.\n\n432 pp. 8vo. Sinclair Lewis went on to become the first American author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1930), following the success of his 1925 novel Arrowsmith, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (Lewis declined the award). Elmer Gantry is \"a satiric indictment of fundamentalist religion that caused an uproar upon its publication in 1927. The title character of Elmer Gantry starts out as a greedy, shallow, philandering Baptist minister, turns to evangelism, and eventually becomes the leader of a large Methodist congregation. Throughout the novel Gantry encounters fellow religious hypocrites, including Mrs. Evans Riddle, Judson Roberts, and Sharon Falconer, with whom he becomes romantically involved. Although he is often exposed as a fraud, Gantry is never fully discredited.\" -- Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature"
