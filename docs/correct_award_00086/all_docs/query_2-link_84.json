        "text": "What does chess have to do with economics? The answer is game theory. In these games like chess, players must think ahead and devise a strategy based on expected countermoves from other players. These interactions characterise many economic situations. Game theory is a theoretical framework that tries to produce the most optimal decision-making of competing actors in a strategic setting. When describing the economic theory, Reinhard Selten told the New York Times that the theory was like chess: “You may not always be right, but such thinking probably makes you play better and keeps you from making as many dumb moves.” The foundations for using game theory in economics were introduced in a monumental study by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern entitled 'Theory of Games and Economic Behavior' (1944). Fifty years later, Selten, John Harsanyi and John Nash were awarded the prize in economic sciences for their contributions to the field.

As long as you're learning, you're not old.\" Take a look at some snapshots of the pioneering physicist Rosalyn Yalow throughout her life. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1977 for developing radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.

If you’re a pessimist, a failed experiment will tell you that the whole idea is bad and you’ll quit. When you fail you have to continue.\" - chemistry laureate Richard Henderson's advice to young scientists.\n\n“I’m fascinated by my work … I didn’t go into my career just to collect prizes or accolades or even money. I don’t have much money. I went into it for the adventure of it, the mystery of it,” said laureate Edmund Phelps. He was awarded the prize in economic sciences for his analysis of intertemporal trade-offs in macroeconomic policy, especially about inflation, wages, and unemployment. In the late 1960s, Phelps began his prize-awarded work, which challenged the assumption that high levels of unemployment corresponded with low levels of inflation and vice versa. He shares wisdom about the quest for “a good life” in his Nobel Prize interview, including this philosophical nugget: “It’s hard to draw lessons from the past about what to avoid in the present.” Watch it here: https://lnkd.in/ebEJA3QG\n\nRosalyn Yalow described herself as a determined and single-minded child. Growing up, her parents wanted her to become a schoolmistress. Instead, Yalow became a nuclear physicist who revolutionised the medical world. Yalow became a physicist when being a woman was seen as an impediment to success, but she persevered. When she could not pay for her graduate degree, Yalow worked as a biochemist's secretary at Columbia University in exchange for classes. In 1941, Yalow accepted an assistantship at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in the College of Engineering; she was the only woman in a faculty of 400. She earned her PhD in nuclear physics and learned how to build and use equipment to measure radioactive substances. With her research partner Solomon Berson, Yalow made a transformative contribution to medical research: radioimmunoassay, a method for measuring concentrations of substances in the blood. Yalow was awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\" With the help of radioimmunoassay, she proved that type 2 diabetes is caused by the body's inefficient use, rather than lack, of insulin.

Surely, the Nobel Peace Prize will make me more resilient, determined, hopeful and enthusiastic.” – peace laureate Narges Mohammadi. The Iranian human rights advocate has been sentenced to 36 years and 3 months in prison and 154 lashes. She has not seen her children Ali and Kiana since 2015. Yet despite her captivity in the notorious Evin prison, she continues to stand at the forefront of major protests against the Iranian regime and fight for women’s rights. For condemning a \"full-scale war against women\" by the Iranian regime, there is a possibility that Mohammadi could be punished further. Watch the moving Nobel Prize lecture delivered by her children: https://lnkd.in/eHQzQ63M\n\nFrom living on the streets to being a successful scientist and Nobel Prize laureate. “...at age 4½, I set off on my own. I headed south, sometimes living in the streets, sometimes joining gangs of other homeless children, sometimes living in orphanages, and most of the time being hungry. My recollections of those four years are vivid but not continuous, rather like a series of snapshots. Some of them are brutal beyond description, others more palatable.” Mario Capecchi, born in 1937, spent years on the streets in Italy and nearly died of malnutrition in a hospital. In 2007, he was awarded the medicine prize \"for their discoveries of principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells\".

According to the diary of one of his assistants, the parrot was a gift from a medical institute for the physical laureate’s birthday. He was concerned the bird was depressed and tried to cheer it up by telling bad jokes. We wonder what else they talked about! Learn more about Einstein: https://lnkd.in/eEm__--A"
