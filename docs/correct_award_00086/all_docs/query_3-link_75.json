His biography reads like a cautionary tale. Born in 1885 in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, an outback village with a population of about twenty-five hundred, Lewis remained a staunch and uncouth midwesterner his entire life. As he wrote in a piece about his hometown in 1931, I find myself thinking of its streets and the familiar friendly faces when I am on the great avenues of New York, or Paris, or Stockholm: when I am in the little stone hilly villages of Italy, or sun-basking villas of Spain, or the yellow ancient temples of Athens.¹ As an adolescent he was interested in religion and studied German in part because he wanted to speak with local German-born priests in their native language.² He also exhibited a voracious love of reading, and among his earliest literary heroes were Henry David Thoreau, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Charles Dickens. Lewis left the Midwest in 1903 to enroll at Yale, where his fellow students considered him a country rube; he was so unpopular he was virtually ostracized. In the lexicon of the day he was fresh. My university days at Yale, he later reminisced, \"were undistinguished save for contributions to Yale Literary Magazine, and even those pieces reek[ed] with a banal romanticism.\"³ After summer trips on tramp steamers to England and Panama and a month feeding the furnace of Helicon Hall, Upton Sinclair's utopian community in New Jersey, he graduated a year behind his class and, to his physician-father's chagrin, immediately turned to literature for a livelihood.\n\nLewis began his career as a hack writer. He hired his first agent in 1907, contributed several potboilers to an ephemeral New Thought magazine in 1909 and 1910, knocked out a pulp novel for boys in the summer of 1911, sold story ideas to Jack London, wrote advertising copy for a string of New York publishers, ghosted parts of several books, and sketched scenarios for Hollywood films. His first serious novels, he remembered, fell dead before the ink was dry.⁴ Following his initial success as a contributor of O. Henry—type formulaic tales to the slicks, especially the Saturday Evening Post, like Huck Finn he lit out for the territory to research Free Air (1919), his sixth novel and his first to be published by the ambitious young firm of Harcourt, Brace and Howe.\n\nOver the next ten years—a decade mirabilis—Lewis wrote five of the most influential social novels in the history of American letters: Main Street (1920), Babbitt (1922), Arrowsmith (1924), Elmer Gantry (1927), and Dodsworth (1929). In them he created a gallery of memorable characters, particularly Doc Kennicott, George F. Babbitt, Sharon Falconer, Gustaf Sondelius, and Fran Dodsworth, and he coined terms and phrases (e.g., main streeter, babbittry) still in vogue. As E. M. Forster noted, Lewis managed to lodge a piece of a continent in our imagination.⁵ In 1998 Main Street was selected by the editors of the Modern Library the 68th best English-language novel of the twentieth century, ahead of such works as Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose, Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim, and Jack London's The Call of the Wild. The following year the readers of the Modern Library selected Arrowsmith the 78th best novel of the century, ahead of Thomas Pynchon's V., Faulkner's Light in August, Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, and Willa Cather's My Ántonia.⁶\n\nFor his five important novels of the 1920s Lewis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930, much to the consternation of such figures as Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Rebecca West, Thomas Mann, William Faulkner, Ellen Glasgow, and Ernest Hemingway. (In Green Hills of Africa, a Hemingway, character declares that Sinclair Lewis is nothing.⁷) Most of the dissenters believed Dreiser or even Ezra Pound deserved the honor before the author of Main Street and Babbitt. On the other hand, Lewis received kudos from many other fellow authors, including Wells, Forster, Arnold Bennett, Wharton, Eugene O'Neill, and Sinclair. Even if we concede that Dreiser deserved the Nobel more than Lewis in 1930, at least Lewis deserved it more than did Pearl Buck in 1938. Lewis won the prize in the early months of the Great Depression and during the failed presidency of Herbert Hoover apparently because it suited the temper of the times, especially the anti-Americanism of many Europeans. Or as Mark Schorer has noted, Lewis's fiction and Nobel acceptance speech found favor abroad because both gave back to a jealous Europe the dismal picture of American life in which it wanted to believe.⁸\n\nUnfortunately, the remainder of Lewis's life was a decrescendo interrupted by an occasional drum roll. As Schorer explains, His work, always flirting with social parody, after 1930 tended more and more toward self-parody.⁹ Like his friend and fellow Minnesotan Harold Stassen (1907–2001), elected the boy-governor of his state at the age of thirty-two and a perennial, pathetic, twelve-time candidate for president until his death, Lewis peaked early and careened downhill the rest of his life. The first novel he wrote after his receipt of the Nobel Prize, Ann Vickers (1932), was published simultaneously in thirteen languages and in sixteen countries—and is as easily overlooked or forgotten today as Faulkner's A Fable (1954) or Steinbeck's America and Americans (1966). In 1938 Granville Hicks titled his review of The Prodigal Parents Sinclair Lewis' Stinkbomb.¹⁰ Lewis eventually grew so bored with writing fiction that in the late 1930s and ’40s he became an actor, a playwright, a theatrical producer, and a Broadway director. In all, he published twenty-three novels as well as a barrelful of short stories, plays, essays, and a smattering of poems. If he was not the most gifted writer of his generation, he was certainly one of the most prolific.\n\nYet for all his gifts as an author of topical fiction, the world changed more quickly than Lewis could adapt to it. Lewis had caught Main Street just at the turning point, at a now vanished point, as Perry Miller observed at the time (chapter 115, this volume). The provincial Gopher Prairie of his imagination had utterly disappeared by his death in 1951, the victim of paved streets, four-lane highways, luxury automobiles, and radio and television. Even his last significant novel, Kingsblood Royal (1947), which seemed brave and controversial when it appeared on the eve of the modern civil rights movement, was a throwback to the passing novels of the 1890s, such as W. D. Howells's An Imperative Duty (1892), Frances E. W. Harper's Iola Leroy (1892), and Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894).\n\n* * *\n\nTo be sure, Lewis pioneered no new style and founded no new literary school. He disdained taxonomies, and his fiction resists neat and pretty categorization. He is more easily described by what he was not than by what he was. Alfred Kazin called him a New Realist,¹¹ though Lewis particularly derided academics' attempts to pigeonhole him. Certainly he was not an old realist like W. D. Howells, whom he had met in Florida in 1916 and with whose theory of fiction he had little truck. Whereas Howells had genuflected in the presence of Emerson and Hawthorne during his first visit to New England sixty years before, the iconoclastic Lewis would have none of this brand of hero worship. He went out of his way to ridicule Howells in his Nobel Prize speech in 1930: he was one of the gentlest, sweetest, and most honest of men, but he had the code of a pious old maid whose greatest delight was to have tea at the vicarage.¹² Lewis contrasted Howells, who embraced the smiling aspects of life, with what Wells called the jolly coarsenesses of life,¹³ and he later joked to his friend, Ramon Guthrie, that he was a photographic realist like James Joyce, only a hell of a lot less so (chapter 87, this volume).\n\nLewis has also been called a social satirist. Certainly he was the author of problem novels about business, race and anti-Semitism, women's rights, marriage and divorce, socialism, medicine, religion, art, the village virus, the threat of native fascism, American expatriatism, the plight of the salariat or office workers, and the generation gap. But he was not a satirist in the Swiftian mold. I'm not a satirist, he insisted to Betty Stevens in 1947. You take a man like Swift—he was a satirist because he exaggerated (chapter 109). Nor were his characters ever unqualified scoundrels. Lewis professed to love many of them, even the rascals, because they entertained him. I like the Babbitts, the Dr. Pickerbaughs, the Will Kennicotts, and even the Elmer Gantrys rather better than anyone else on earth, he declared in 1928. They are good fellows. They laugh—really laugh.¹⁴\n\nUnfortunately, Lewis failed either to plan or to complete two novels he should have written. For whatever reason, he had little to say publicly about the First World War. Schorer remarks that in his personal life the war did not touch Sinclair Lewis,¹⁵ and Richard Lingeman adds that when America did go to war, Lewis retreated into political silence.¹⁶ He apparently harbored reservations about the justice of the war, like many other socialists at the time. The leader of the Socialist Party of America, Eugene V. Debs, was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1918 under the Espionage Act of 1917 for his opposition to the war, and Lewis may have feared the same fate. He was less reserved in his support of the war effort against the Nazis during the Second World War, scripting a radio play to promote the purchase of war bonds. He also suffered the loss of his son, Wells, killed by a sniper in France in October 1944. Yet he never wrote a novel devoted specifically to war.\n\nMost famously, Lewis never published an oft-projected and long-rumored labor novel based on the life of Debs, variously titled Neighbor or The Man Who Sought God, though he made at least seven attempts to write it. He hoped it would be his masterpiece, and he collected material for years and drafted hundreds of pages, all of them eventually destroyed. He seems to have been blocked, partly because he never fully identified with the working class and could not imagine all the challenges of a blue-collar life, partly because he was unsure how to address the ideological turmoil on the political left during the Great Depression. His failure to finish the labor novel was one of the great disappointments of his career.\n\nHe resented assertions that he was merely a stenographer of life or a journalist or a sociological novelist. Such animadversions, he believed, denigrated his achievements as an imaginative writer. Still, in his own voice Lewis once admitted that in his fiction he scratched the sociological itch which afflicts so many writers like myself,¹⁷ and he elsewhere joked with Maude Parker Child that eventually I who peculiarly detest the sociological novel will go and ‘do’ the plumbers, the dentists, the communists, the authors . . . the chiropodists and the vermin exterminators, and with my last gasp be planning a chatty series of novels embodying the history of South Dakota.¹⁸ The scholar Stephen S. Conroy averred in 1970 that Lewis was blessed with what C. Wright Mills called the sociological imagination,¹⁹ and as recently as 2002 Lingeman argued that Lewis was a literary sociologist even while conceding that Lewis detested the sociological novel: he approached the job like an anthropologist studying the mores, customs, and mating rituals of a primitive village.²⁰ Certainly, Lewis carefully researched his best novels. He outlined the plots, wrote capsule biographies of his characters, and drew elaborate floor plans of the houses where they lived and detailed maps of the towns where the stories were set. He conducted fieldwork, read insatiably on his subjects, and hired consultants to assist him. Alfred Harcourt once likened Lewis working on a novel to a PhD student writing a dissertation (chapter 69). Lewis understood long before the mass of sociologists, for example, that racial categories are socially constructed and fluid: The races of mankind in every country run through a gradation of color from intense black to the almost pure white which is to be found only in alarming cases of anemia. No one has ever determined just where the line in this shading is to be drawn.²¹ On the other hand, whenever he wrote on a topic that required little or no intensive preparation or when he neglected the basic carpentry of the novel, as in Mantrap (1926) and The Man Who Knew Coolidge (1928), or when his passion for detail and accuracy flagged, as in Work of Art (1934) and The Prodigal Parents (1938), he failed to write a very good book.\n\nLewis has also been fairly regarded as a transitional figure in the history of American modernism. Yet Schorer has gone even further, claiming that Lewis became the spokesman for a literary generation.²² Trouble is, he belonged to the same generation as many a greater novelist than he, among them Faulkner, Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Cather. By all accounts, Lewis was allergic to the modernist revolt in the arts. He attended the Armory Show in New York in 1913, but it made no impression on him. He was deaf to the experimental music of Béla Bartók (1881–1945) and Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951).²³ He was repulsed by the avant-garde fiction of James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. That is, Lewis responded to the conditions of modernity without developing a modernist style. At most, he thought, realism and modernism can co-exist,²⁴ and to his credit he was not entirely ignored by the high modernists. T. S. Eliot remarked in a letter dated New Year's Eve 1921 that his wife Vivian has read me some bits of Babbitt. It has some good things in it.²⁵\n\nLewis is best understood, in our opinion, as a social comedian and provocateur in the Dickens tradition. Like Dickens, he was a social documentarian. In 1931, moreover, Constance Rourke called Lewis a fabulist, or a teller of fables. Lewis turns his abundant fables into critiques and challenges, she averred, but the transcendent effect is the traditional effect: the American portrait, a comic portrait once more, has been drawn in amplitude.²⁶ Certainly the notion that Lewis wrote social comedy helps to explain his best work. His mission in life, Lewis once told Frazier Hunt, was to be the despised critic, the eternal faultfinder (chapter 34). Lewis's admiration for Dickens's novels was also unbounded. Both Allen Austin and Ida Compton, in their interviews with Lewis at his Vermont home in the late 1940s, remark on his ownership of the Nonesuch Press edition of Dickens's complete works. Allen noted that \"Martin Chuzzlewit was open on the table in front of the divan (chapter 112), and Compton quoted Lewis to the effect that if his own books are read fifty years from now . . . it's because I did for America what Dickens did for England\" (chapter 110). That is, Lewis displaced Dickens's London in a series of midwestern towns and cities populated by such Dickensian types as Chum Frink, Buzz Windrip, and Fred Cornplow.\n\nTo illustrate the point: Carol Kennicott in Main Street was a version of Grace Hegger Lewis, the snooty philistine to whom he was married when he wrote the novel. He even inscribed her copy of the novel, To Gracie, who is all the good part of Carol.²⁷ She remembered many years later how in 1919 she advised him on the book by patiently answering his questions.\n\n* * *\n\nHe was grateful always for my professional experience with manuscripts, my knowledge of printer's signs and jargon, my instinctive good literary taste.\n\nThe novel often intruded on my sleep. Fortunately I could always wake easily and cheerfully, if Hal came home late and wanted to talk, or if at six A.M., unable to sleep, he came to sit on the edge of my bed and ask: Gracie, what kind of pictures would there be on the wall when Carol does over the living room?\n\nI would push my hair away from my face, rub my eyes, try to take in what he was saying.\n\n\"Uh—uh—why don't you hang up a piece of Japanese brocade—a sash—an obi I think it's called?\" (Chapter 29)\n\nIn an interview with Lewis in the late 1940s but not published until 1958, three years after Grace Hegger Lewis published her autobiography, Lewis was asked whether he meant [Carol] to be silly. Lewis replied, Certainly. For example, I deliberately had her decorate a room in bad taste (chapter 112). That is, he had used his wife as a model dilettante, and she failed to recognize his censure or his humor.\n\nIn addition, Lewis was a liberal humanist who aspired to the role of public intellectual. For six months, from autumn 1937 until spring 1938, for example, he wrote a weekly column for Newsweek, and he was an occasional contributor to the Nation, American Mercury, and Esquire. He was an intellectual but not an intellectual snob. On the contrary, he derided the cultural quackery of such highbrows as Bernard DeVoto,²⁸ Harold Stearns, Greenwich Villagers, and Left Bank expatriates. He stridently opposed what George Orwell termed group-think, and to the extent his novels share a common theme they protest American middle-class complacency and commercialism and cultural standardization. As he wrote in his own fanciful self-portrait, he may have had no virtues whatever save a real, fiery, almost reckless hatred of hypocrisy.²⁹\n\n* * *\n\nHe was also, unfortunately, a man of unpredictable opinions and a clutter of contradictions. Despite his Ivy League pedigree and an early ambition to earn a PhD in English, he scorned academic pretension and skewered the professoriate, especially teachers of literature. Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead, he declared in Stockholm.³⁰ Ironically, though his novel Main Street epitomized the revolt from the village in American literature in the 1920s, after his turn to acting in the 1930s Lewis sometimes played the part of the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder's nostalgic and sentimental Our Town, a play that revolted against the revolt from the village. An erstwhile Fabian socialist in his early twenties, he became a social crank and a self-righteous scold, a self-described counter revolutionary, in his sixties. Dorothy Thompson wrote that he was basically apolitical, but insofar as his social ideas were articulate and consistent, he was an old-fashioned populist radical.³¹ He once asserted, incredibly enough, that the two greatest people he had ever known were the socialist Debs and the Republican president Hoover (chapter 89). A religious skeptic, he nevertheless read Thomas à Kempis's The Imitation of Christ for pleasure. Although he could be charitable and charming, he also could be obnoxious and condescending, as petulant as a child. His readiness to take offense was legendary. To quote Henry Seidel Canby, he was as little restrained by good taste as an angry cat (chapter 5). He was a failure as a father to his sons, Wells and Michael, and all of his romantic relationships ended badly. His first wife, Grace, was a social climber who affected a British accent and bragged she had been conceived in Vienna. Theirs was, according to Lingeman, a marriage of two narcissists.³² His second marriage, to the journalist Dorothy Thompson, one of the most brilliant political commentators in America during the 1930s and ’40s, suffered from a professional rivalry in which she bested him. Her public star was rising as his was falling. His affair late in life with Marcella Powers, an acolyte less than half his age, ended when she decided she wanted to become a conventional wife and mother.\n\nThe list of people Lewis alienated during his life reads like a Who's Who of Anglo-American writers and publishers. With his prickly temperament, he may well have lost more friends than he made were it not a mathematical impossibility. His reputation never recovered from his infamous row with Dreiser at the Metropolitan Club in New York on March 19, 1931. After Lewis publicly accused Dreiser of plagiarizing two thousand words from the serialization of his wife's book The New Russia (October 1928) in his book Dreiser Looks at Russia (November 1928), Dreiser slapped him. The incident made front-page news across the country and redounded to the benefit of neither man. By the end of his life he had become a social pariah. Only a handful of associates, such as H. L. Mencken and Fanny Butcher, remained loyal to him.\n\nCentral to his inability to maintain friendships was his alcoholism. Like almost all of the other American writers to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature—Hemingway, O'Neill, Faulkner, and John Steinbeck—he was a very heavy drinker most of his adult life. I suppose hundreds of people in three decades have seen Sinclair Lewis drunk; no doubt he made a vast public spectacle of himself, Miller mused (chapter 115). Long before his lonely death in Italy in 1951, Lewis had exhausted his appeal, stained his reputation, and spent his talent.\n\nNor was he ever considered physically attractive. Tall and lanky, with a startlingly ugly and acne-scarred face, Lewis resembled Fred Astaire with pustules. In Across the River and Into the Trees (1950), Hemingway caricatured him as a mediocre writer who had outlived his talents, a fellow with a strange face like an over-enlarged, disappointed weasel or ferret. It looked as pock-marked and blemished as the mountains of the moon seen through a cheap telescope and . . . it looked like Goebbels' face, if Herr Goebbels had ever been in a plane that burned, and not been able to bail out before the fire reached him.³³ Similarly, in You Can't Go Home Again (1940) Thomas Wolfe described the face of Lloyd McHarg, modeled on Lewis, as so puckered up it seemed \"all dried out and blistered by the fiery flames that burned in it.³⁴\n\nLewis was, above all, a professional writer in the best sense of the term. While he was not a craftsman, he was disciplined. When he was working, he kept a strict routine, and he often told young writers that the secret to literary success was the application of the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair.³⁵ When he was on his game, Lewis could easily write three to five thousand words a day. He occasionally described his study as a factory, and George Horace Lorimer, the editor and publisher of the Saturday Evening Post, referred without irony to Lewis's plant in 1917.³⁶ He willingly tailored his stories to editors' specifications, but in the end he rarely compromised with the demands of the literary market. He courted readers, but not popularity at the price of his integrity. But there were some exceptions: He was not above whoring, as he put it, as in many of his short stories and in such novels as The Man Who Knew Coolidge and Mantrap. He was occasionally willing to capitalize on his reputation, to publish a swell piece of cheese to grab off some easy gravy.³⁷\n\n* * *\n\nEven during his life Lewis became a persona of letters non grata. No self-respecting critic dared to discuss his fiction. Even today he seems a tempting target for the slings and arrows of the Neiman Marxists on the left. Ironically, Schorer's Sinclair Lewis: An American Life (1961), over nine years in the making and over eight hundred pages in length, gave the coup de grâce to his critical reputation. As Lingeman explains, Schorer's book gave academics and general readers a license not to read Sinclair Lewis, if they needed one.³⁸ It also appeared in the heyday of the New Criticism and at the height of the Cold War and the anti-communist culture war in academe,³⁹ so it skews the record of Lewis's opposition to Marxism and his growing conservatism in later years. For whatever reason, Schorer's biography also betrays several biographical blind spots. He omits all mention of a woman who pursued Lewis, a former mistress of A. S. Frere, though he certainly interviewed her,⁴⁰ for example, and while Schorer mentions Dorothy Thompson's friend, Christa Winsloe, a German novelist and playwright, several times in passing,⁴¹ he was apparently as oblivious as Lewis to the fact that Winsloe was his wife's lover. Schorer's disdain for his subject is palpable, especially in the final chapters. He even concludes that Lewis was one of the worst writers in modern American Literature.⁴² and his life, for all his millions of readers, is an allegory of uneasy, hapless waste, a life which, long before his death, had become the object of the world's pity and contempt.⁴³ Reviewing Sinclair Lewis: An American Life for the New York Times Book Review, Irving Howe scolded the biographer: a reader looking back upon the shambles of Sinclair Lewis' years and reflecting that such tragic waste is far from unique to him, may feel for this brilliant and stricken man a more open sympathy than Mr. Schorer allows himself to express.⁴⁴\n\nThere have been hints in recent years of a nascent critical rehabilitation. Richard Lingeman's Sinclair Lewis: Rebel from Main Street (2002) offers a necessary corrective to Schorer's biography. Once a toxic topic, Lewis's fiction also has been slowly regaining scholarly respectability. To judge by the column inches devoted to Lewis in the annual MLA Bibliography, there has been an uptick in the interest in Lewis during the past twenty years. Today there is even a scholarly Sinclair Lewis Society, founded in 1992 and affiliated with the American Literature Association, which issues a semiannual newsletter.\n\nThis volume offers yet another alternative, anecdotal account of Lewis's life. It is a type of collaborative biography published incrementally over a period of eighty years, with many of the entries recorded by friends, former friends, enemies, and acquaintances after his death. It gathers dozens of scattered sources about Lewis's life and career, illustrating the complexity of his personality in a way no single biographer could, and it offers unsanitized glimpses of him, warts and all. We have selected entries, including two interviews with Lewis new to scholarship (chapters 16 and 35), that have contributed to the narrative of his life we have constructed—not always a seamless one, but one that can be read coherently from start to finish. We have distributed some of the most important sources among many sections of the narrative in order to enhance its continuity. Our internal cuts from the entries, omitted passages that do not contribute to the narrative, are indicated with bracketed ellipses. We have also silently standardized the spelling of Sauk Centre and corrected misspellings, punctuation errors, and other obvious mistakes.\n\n* * *\n\nWe are indebted to Steven Keller and Russell Cole of the Zimmerman Library staff at the University of New Mexico for their assistance in the preparation of this volume.\n\n1\n\nSauk Centre\n\n1885–1903\n\nGrowing up in Minnesota, the bookish Harry Sinclair Lewis was a loner. Odd-turned with pustulant acne, a favored butt of practical jokes, he was an unlikely candidate for fame and fortune. The youngest child of the village doctor Edwin J. Lewis (1849–1926) and Emma Kermott Lewis (1849–1891) and the younger brother of Claude Lewis (1878–1957), who also became a physician, he seems to have left few early footprints. As he later wrote, his boyhood was utterly commonplace.¹ No one in Lewis's immediate family and none of his adolescent friends recorded memories of him as a child, though Hazel Palmer Lynam, the sister of one of his friends, and his niece, Isabel Lewis Agrell, collected some impressions later.\n\n1 / Hazel Palmer Lynam\n\nHazel Palmer Lynam (1890–1963), an acquaintance of Lewis in his adolescence, attended Oberlin College and later taught school in Duluth.\n\nSource: Hazel Palmer Lynam, The Earliest Lewis, Saturday Review of Literature, April 14, 1934, 628.\n\nDr. Lewis was our family physician while we lived in Sauk Centre, and one summer arranged for Harry to work as night clerk in my father's hotel, the Palmer House. I imagine this must have been his first hotel experience and must have been about the time he finished high school or early in his college career.\n\nOur small hotel circle and their friends found a great deal of amusement in the fool things Harry did, as it was generally recognized by this time that he would never amount to very much. They liked to recount how he called a traveling man at five-thirty in the morning to tell him that he had forgotten to call him for the five o'clock train.\n\nI remember once he fell through the glass top of a cigar case for no good reason at all. He was standing by it and, I suppose, strayed so far away mentally that he neglected to maintain his center of gravity in a practical position.\n\nMy younger brother discovered him as a storyteller. He used to sit up on the desk behind the glass partition, where the bookkeeping was done, and listen to the stories Harry would tell. Sometimes I joined them. He would ask us what we would have, and no matter what subject we chose, he would start immediately and go on and on. My brother, by right of prior discovery, insisted on doing most of the selecting, so the stories were usually a little bloodthirsty for my taste. The only fragment of these tales that remains in my memory at all is one about a man tied in a cave and driven mad by the constant slow drip of water on the back of his hand.\n\nI can remember once Harry spent a long time urging me to study and be valedictorian of my high school class. He was distressed because I was not taking a proper interest in my work. I was quite stimulated about the idea for three or four days, so he must have been rather convincing.\n\nHe was willing to put himself out, more than most adults, to amuse us; and we liked him very much in spite of the mild contempt with which he was viewed by our elders.\n\n2 / Isabel Lewis Agrell\n\nIn her memoir, Isabel Lewis Agrell (1916–2000), Sinclair Lewis's niece, preserved personal accounts, family documents, and even a recipe for Sinclair Lewis Cookies, which called for a shot of bourbon.\n\nSource: Isabel Lewis Agrell, Sinclair Lewis Remembered (Crosslake, MN: privately printed, 1996), 35–36.\n\nSinclair used to say that the only person he really wanted to impress was his brother Claude, but he was never able to do so. Untrue. Claude was very proud of his younger brother. I'm sure that Sinclair exasperated Claude many times throughout their lives, but there was always a strong bond between them. I know that they both had great respect and affection for one another.\n\nBecause there was over a six-year difference in their ages, Claude undoubtedly had little interest in including a little brother in his boyhood games and pranks. By the time Claude left home for a year of teaching after high school graduation, Sinclair was still in grade school.\n\nClaude maintained a good and happy relationship with his entire family throughout his life. I think Claude thoroughly enjoyed his friendship with Sinclair, in spite of the fact that he was much more conventional and even-tempered than his illustrious brother.\n\nIn a financial record of Claude's when he was at the University of Minnesota, one item mentioned was Suit for Harry—$19.00. When I questioned my mother one time about the youthful Sinclair, her reply was that he was a nice young man.\n\nClaude was in touch with Sinclair throughout their lives by letter, by phone, or in person. Within my memory, during the twenties and thirties, whenever Sinclair visited Claude and Mary's home, he was treated as a very important guest. The best white linen tablecloth covered the dining room table. Large white linen napkins were a must.\n\nThe best glassware, silver, and china were used. We always had white linen tablecloths and napkins, fresh every Sunday, as did Grandfather Lewis, but when Sinclair came, everything was a little extra special. Our dear German maid, Katy Meyer Lang, dressed in black or white uniforms with a white organdy apron on special occasions. She said that the only thing Sinclair ever complained of was the orange juice, which he thought should not be strained as she had been doing.\n\nAt one dinner party, which my mother gave for Sinclair when I was in high school during the ’30s, our neighbors, Bishop and Mrs. Kemerer, were invited. Sinclair arrived very intoxicated. Mrs. Kemerer was a good sport and humored Sinclair although I am sure my parents were embarrassed.\n\nClaude and Mary visited New York during the late ’20s. Sinclair took them to a speakeasy and on a tour of the Île de France, the ocean liner.² These were the only events I remember, although I am sure there must have been more, knowing Sinclair's delight in showing provincial relatives the sights of the city.\n\n2\n\nNew Haven and New Jersey\n\n1903–8\n\nAfter a college preparatory course at the academy of Oberlin College in Ohio, Lewis enrolled in Yale University in the fall of 1903. Some of his instructors and classmates there—Chauncey Brewster Tinker, William Lyon Phelps, Henry Seidel Canby, and Leonard Bacon—later reminisced fondly about him. Although a frequent contributor to student publications, he essentially remained an outsider during his years in New Haven. He was so disaffected he took off the academic year 1906–7 to live and work in Upton Sinclair's cooperative community in New Jersey and to travel before returning to Yale. He completed his undergraduate degree in the spring of 1908 while working part-time for the New Haven Journal-Courier.\n\n3 / Chauncey Brewster Tinker\n\nChauncey Brewster Tinker (1876–1953) was professor of English literature at Yale University (1899–1945), where he was affectionately known as Yale's Dr. Johnson. He was among the first to recognize Lewis's talent. Tinker, whose mind Lewis found keen, appreciative, eager, humorous, inspired him to excel in his studies during his first year.\n\nSource: Chauncey Brewster Tinker, Sinclair Lewis, a Few Reminiscences, Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Letters n.s. 2 (1952): 65–67.\n\nMy own acquaintance with Lewis had been formed as early as September 1903. It began, oddly enough, as I was walking across the old campus on my way to the very first class which I ever taught at Yale College. I was accosted by a tall, redheaded boy, who asked, Are you my Prof? My name is Harry Lewis. Oh yes, I replied in some surprise. I have your name on my list. How do you do? He went on, How about this fellow Yeats that's going to lecture tonight? Well, I answered, he is an Irish poet, and his name is pronounced ‘Yates.’ You had better go and hear him. It was clear that the boy was interested in poetry. So was I. Here was a bond between us."
