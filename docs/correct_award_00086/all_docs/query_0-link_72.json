        "text": "This collection includes three of his best works:\n\nArrowsmith: Annotated Edition\n\nFirst published in 1925 to great critical acclaim, Arrowsmith is the third major novel by Sinclair Lewis, author of Main Street and Babbitt, and arguably his most ambitious work. Awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1926 – which the author famously declined – it contributed to Lewis’s growing reputation as a master storyteller, social commentator and the unsurpassed satirist of his time.\n\nBabbitt: Annotated Edition\n\nA trenchant satire on the consumer society and an indictment of the fatuous ideals of Middle America in the Roaring Twenties, Babbitt – the crowning achievement of Sinclair Lewis, winner of the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature – questions the attractions of materialistic fulfilment, at the same time laying bare the hollowness of social respectability and blind conformism.\n\nMain Street: Annotated Edition\n\nAn enormous commercial and critical success on its first publication in 1920, Main Street – regarded by many as Sinclair Lewis’s best novel – delivers a scathing satire on the American dream, and is invaluable as a document of pre-Prohibition Middle America."
