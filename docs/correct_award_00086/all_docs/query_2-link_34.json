Nobel Prize 1930 — Lewis, Sinclair — Harry Sinclair Lewis (February 7, 1885 - January 10, 1951) was an American writer and playwright.

In the academy's presentation speech, special attention was paid to Babbitt. In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, and other contemporaries, but also lamented that \"in America most of us - not readers alone, but even writers - are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,\" and that America is \"the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.\" He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: \"Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.\"\nCONTENTS:\nOur Mr. Wrenn (1914)\nThe Trail of the Hawk (1915)\nThe Job (1917)\nThe Innocents (1917)\nFree Air (1919)\nMain Street (1920)\nBabbitt (1922)\nArrowsmith (1925)\nMantrap (1926)\nElmer Gantry (1927)",
