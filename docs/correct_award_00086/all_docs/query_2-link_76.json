        "text": "Did you know that we recently had a scholar visiting SCSU from China to study Sinclair Lewis? Read more about her time with us here and continue reading to find out more about Sinclair Lewis!\n\nWell, who is he? If you’re from central Minnesota, I’m fairly confident you’ve at least heard of the man. If you’re not from here, you might not know why he is so important to central Minnesotans, especially Sauk Centre residents!\n\nSinclair Lewis (full name – Harry Sinclair Lewis) was born February 7, 1885 in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, the most Scandinavian part of America (at that time). His father was a country doctor. Sinclair writes about his childhood, “Until I went East to Yale University I attended the ordinary public school, along with many Madsens, Olesons, Nelsons, Hedins, Larsons. Doubtless it was because of this that I made the hero of my second book, The Trail of the Hawk, a Norwegian, and Gustaf Sondelius, of Arrowsmith, a Swede – and to me, Dr. Sondelius is the favorite among all my characters” (The Nobel Prize).\n\nAfter public school, Lewis attended Yale University. Lewis claims the only real writing he did during his time at Yale was writing for the Yale Literary Magazine. Interestingly, most of the stories he wrote for this magazine were boring romantic stories. Lewis himself finds his earlier writings interesting when looking at his later writing. He ponders, “Whether imaginary castles at nineteen lead always to the sidewalks of Main Street at thirty-five, and whether the process might be reversed, and whether either of them is desirable, I leave to psychologists” (The Nobel Prize).\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1907, Lewis worked as a reporter and editor. Later, he wrote for popular magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post and Cosmopolitan but always wanted to be a serious novelist. In 1914, he published his first novel, Our Mr. Wrenn which received favorable criticism but few readers. In 1920, Lewis’ literary reputation was established with the publication of Main Street. It is told from the perspective of Carol Kennicott, an Eastern girl married to a Midwestern doctor who settles in the fictional town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. Gopher Prairie is inspired and modeled after Lewis’ hometown of Sauk Centre.\n\nMuch of the success of this novel came from Lewis’ accurate use of local speech, customs and social amenities. According to Britannica.com, “The satire is double-edged—directed against both the townspeople and the superficial intellectualism that despises them. In the years following its publication, Main Street became not just a novel but the textbook on American provincialism” (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica).\n\nAfter Main Street, Lewis led a busy life. He married Dorothy Thompson in 1928 in England, travelled a lot, but claims his travels were quite boring, and in 1930, became the first American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in Rome, Italy on January 10, 1951, just a month shy of his 66th birthday.
