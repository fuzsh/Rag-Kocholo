        "text": "When Sinclair Lewis was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1930, he was the first American author to win the prestigious award. A prolific and popular short story writer, Lewis also wrote more than a dozen novels before winning the international prize.\n\nThe Nobel Committee considered four of his novels for their literary significance and what they revealed about Americans — \"Main Street\" (1920), \"Babbitt\" (1922), \"Elmer Gantry\" (1927), and \"Dodsworth\" (1929) — citing Lewis’ “vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humour, and new types of characters.”\n\nLewis often dissected and satirized small-town life to expose the myths and hypocrisy of American idealism. He challenged mainstream ideas that had evolved from romanticized aspirations of a growing nation into distorted interpretations that became reality, from the excesses of materialism and capitalism to the misdirected zeal of religion and politics.\n\nWhile the nation celebrated and admired those who rose to the top, Lewis refused to ignore those on the bottom. He held up a mirror for the world to see that despite the promise of, and belief in, an idealized society, in the end, we were all merely human with all the weaknesses and worries, the foibles and failings, that people tend to overlook or purposely ignore.\n\nAlthough the selected novels were written about an America that existed in the early twentieth century, they are just as germane today for what they revealed. We haven’t changed that much in our desire to believe and pursue some idealized version of ourselves despite the inconvenient evidence to the contrary.\n\nHowever, it was \"It Can’t Happen Here\" (1935), written after Lewis won the Nobel Prize, that is most relevant to our current national temperament. Fearful of the rise of fascism in Europe, Lewis created a storyline that foreshadowed the perils of unfettered populism and how rational, law-abiding citizens can myopically refuse to recognize an obvious threat to the principles of democracy.\n\nThe story follows the actions of a small-town newspaper editor as the country struggles to recover from a crushing economy, a widening chasm between the haves and the have-nots and the rise of fascism in Europe.\n\nAn unscrupulous, politically ambitious con-man recognizes his opportunity, perceiving the vulnerability and desperation of the poor, uneducated and disadvantaged who feel they have no chance at the American Dream. The self-ordained leader and his supporters use demagoguery and propaganda to exploit the most gullible to create a national political movement. His inflammatory and distorted views, and attacks on the failures of the government, persuade thousands of angry disenfranchised people to join.\n\nThe majority of the population, still believing in the integrity of democratic principles and institutions, naively fail to recognize the fallibility of their elected leaders who dismiss the threat to their power and the peril to the government.\n\nThe antagonist, in his reckless pursuit of personal interests, runs for president and wins. Emboldened by the refusal of authorities to hold him and his followers accountable for their transgressions, he gains momentum with an aggressive crusade, converting ignorance and complacency into a bludgeon to dismantle democracy. Ruling by edicts and force, he is eventually outsmarted and outmaneuvered by his closest advisors in a bloody coup and is exiled. The ensuing power struggle leads to riots and rebellion, an even weaker government and a diversionary invasion of Mexico. The story ends with a growing number of underground resistors consolidating power to try to take back the country.\n\nMany works of fiction have explored similar themes — provocative, cautionary tales that warn us that we can never become complacent about freedom and our obligation to defend it against those who choose to exploit it. Lewis challenged the hypocrisy of our precepts and put that complacency front and center with his mocking title, \"It Can’t Happen Here.\"\n\nIt can, and has, for four shameful years. You can’t say we were not warned.\n\nAdam Villone is a resident of Cummaquid."
