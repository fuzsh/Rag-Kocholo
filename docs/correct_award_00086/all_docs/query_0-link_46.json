        "text": "Sinclair Lewis (1885 - 1951) was an American novelist, short-story writer and playwright famous for becoming the first American awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930. He was recognized \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.\" During his Nobel acceptance speech, Lewis praised the influential work of many of his contemporaries including Ernest Hemingway, Theodore Dreiser, and Willa Cather. Lorimer was attracted by Lewis’ ability to mix satire and sentiment with a knowledge of sound business practices. George Lorimer, editor of The Saturday Evening Post, was drawn to Lewis' ability to mix satire and sentiment with a knowledge of sound business practices, publishing one of his first short stories in 1915. Lorimer wrote: “Every business day is full of comedy, tragedy, farce, romance — all the ingredients of successful fiction.”\n\nAfter his graduation from Yale in 1908, Sinclair bounced from job to job, like so many other writers. In addition to working for newspapers and publishing houses, Lewis produced a number of popular (if not acclaimed) short stories. He also earned money by writing some plotlines for Jack London."
