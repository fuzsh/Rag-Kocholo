        "text": "Although Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 alternative-history novel It Can’t Happen Here has been interpreted as an intellectually shallow, failed attempt to imagine a fascist takeover of the United States, it is in fact a successful evocation of the strengths and weaknesses of liberalism. The novel’s formal structure, themes, and characterization reproduce the classical liberal values of individual freedom and autonomous reason as the basis of a representative democracy that is capable of controlling tyranny via the social contract. Like liberalism, the book’s realism can expose fascism’s cynical masking of corporate dominance beneath a rhetoric of revolutionary populism, but it fails to connect that domination to the capitalism that gave rise to both liberalism and fascism. Instead, Doremus Jessup discerns a “biology of dictatorships” -- an innate predisposition to dominate -- to explain fascism’s rise. This notion blinds him to liberalism’s complicity with the problem of the rise of fascism.\n\nNorman Mailer, one of the most influential authors of the second half of the twentieth century, faithfully followed his principle that a writer should alsobe a critic of contemporary reality. Therefore, most of his works portray the reality of the United States of America and the complexities of the contemporary American scene. Mailer described the spirit of his time - from the terror of war and numerous dynamic social and political processes to the 1969 moon landing. Conflicts were often in the centre of his writing, as was the relationship between an individual and the society; he speaks of politicalpower and the dangerous power of capital, while pointing to the threat of totalitarianism in America. Mailer spent his entire career writing about violence, power, perverted sexuality, the phenomenon of Hitler, terrorism, religion and corruption. He continually pointed out that individuals were in constant danger of losing freedom and dignity.\n\nThis paper examines how place and biography had a major impact on C. S. Lewis' writings. The works examined are the Chronicles of Narnia, The Great Divorce, Til We Have Faces, That Hideous Strength, Surprised by Joy, God in the Dock and The Four Loves. This analysis reveals that Lewis used his personal tragedy, his religious conversion and life experiences to create great works of fiction that still resonate in the 21st century.\n\nFalkner's originality lies in his pioneering use of the stream-of-consciousness technique as well as the range and depth of his characterization representative of people in almost all social strata present in the postbellum American South. “His artistic commitment to realism undermined the prejudices that he otherwise accepted: In simply depicting the folkways of white supremacy without flinching, the argument goes, he held them up to scrutiny and revealed their inherent ludicrousness” (Kindley, 2020).The narratological characteristics of his creative work can be confidently attributed to his formative life as a self-disciplined literate growing independently at home, where the room for his perception of reality getting affected by a third party used to be minimal."
