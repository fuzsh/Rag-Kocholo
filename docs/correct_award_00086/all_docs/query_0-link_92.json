        "text": "Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, was born in Sauk Centre, Minnesota, in 1885. He wrote novels, plays, and short stories. Although he was proud of his Midwestern roots, he traveled widely and was interested in many different aspects of American society, from business and medicine to religion and small town life. At the age of 13 he ran away from home to become a drummer boy in the Spanish-American War, but his father caught up with him at the railroad station, and brought the boy home. Lewis started to write and keep a diary in his youth; he produced romantic poetry, and stories about knights and fair ladies. Before 1921 he had already published six novels. His concern with issues involving women, race, and the powerless in society make his work still vital and pertinent today. His works are known for their insightful and critical views of American society and capitalist values, as well as their strong characterizations of modern working women.Sinclair Lewis was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Main Street and Babbitt, and won the award for Arrowsmith (although he turned it down). He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He died in Rome in 1951.\n\nTheresa M.\n\nSources: http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/slewis.htm http://www.biographybase.com/biography/Lewis_Sinclair.html"
