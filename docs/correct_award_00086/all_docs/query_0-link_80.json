Please review the entire agreement for further explanation and details.\n\n20 % Buyers Fee added to each Lot. For example, if the high bid is $100 and there is a twenty percent (20%) buyer’s premium, the premium will be $20.00, for a total bid of $120.00.\n\n100% Guarantee. We may be able to issue refunds on items, under certain conditions that have been legally (established by or recognized by a court of law) found to be fraudulent, or unauthentic. We always make an effort to offer Customer Service to our clients. Items are sold with the Letter of Authenticity as described and items will not be refunded due to differing opinions of other companies, people, industry people, Authenticators opinions and or different authentication process.\n\nNon-Payment of Auction– If you do not pay for your auctions, please note that we take this seriously, and you will be sued for breach of contract. In addition, you agree that we are able to share your information publicly as a Non-Payer /Banned User. Communication is always best we look to work and resolve any issues with all our bidders.\n\nReserves. We have a NO RESERVES policy. Meaning that we inspire all of our sellers to put their minimum bid as their reserve. Although some items still may have reserves, we push for all reserves, if any, to be removed prior to sale. We do not disclose the reserve on an item but will disclose if an item has a reserve upon request.\n\nAuction Close. Notice of EXTENDED BIDDING TIME CHANGE. We are changing the extra time added to the clock from 5 minutes to 25 Minutes.\n\nWe do not close PER LOT but rather per the ENTIRE auction. We want to ensure that all bidders have ample time to place bids and do not get SNIPED at the end of the auction time period.\n\nSo as long as there is bidding on anything, the entire auction remains open. The clock will reset for 60 minutes and continue counting down. There will be a banner which will give auction updates and warnings as to the auction close, or auction slowing down.\n\nInventory-Out of Stock Issues. We attempt to ensure that all products are available for sale and in the auction. However, system inventory issues may occur and items may not have been properly removed out of stock at the time of sale and Lot will NOT be available for sale. The Company will not be liable for any stock issues that may occur in a sale or in auction that deem the item UNAVAILABLE.\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nThe property in today’s sale will be offered for sale by BidAmi.com LLC (“BidAmi”) on behalf of the owners of the property, referred to as the “seller,” and will be governed by the terms and conditions set forth herein (the “Agreement”). BIDAMI is the agent of the seller.\n\n1. Bidder’s Registration\n\nAll persons who wish to bid in the auction or want to purchase from the Store must register and obtain a unique bidder number. To register, Buyer must provide all of the registration information requested, and sign the Agreement by “checking the I AGREE” box. By checking this box, you acknowledge that you are binding yourself to this contractual agreement. Bidders must be 18 years of age or older and have a valid driver’s license. BIDAMI reserves the right to refuse to register or admit any person at its sole discretion. Buyer may register his or her auction account by phone, e-mail, or Internet. Internet registration is closed during the last two (2) days of an open auction. Buyer may, however, call BIDAMI and attempt to register during this time.\n\nA credit card or credit reference is taken along with any other pertinent information for verification. Invoices and correspondence relating to purchases will be sent in according to the information on the bidder’s registration. You registration will be accepted but will information will be verified and your account may be disabled until necessary information is provided to verify the account.\n\n2. Payment\n\nPayment in full (including the buyer’s premium when applicable) must be paid by Buyer in the form of cash, checks, money order, and all major credit cards (if you have a question about whether a credit card is accepted please call BIDAMI before the sale), prior to the removal/delivery of any property purchased. Money orders are preferred. Check can take up to fourteen (14) days to clear. BIDAMI reserves the right to refuse credit card payments on any Lot. Buyer shall pay the purchase price, the buyer’s premium, shipping and handling charges (if any), plus any and all applicable taxes, unless such taxes are exempted by law (proof of exemption must be provided). Payment is expected within seven (7) days after notification. Unclaimed Lots will be offered by BIDAMI to the next highest bidder or re-listed. Failure to fulfill Buyer’s payment obligations will affect future bidding privileges.\n\n3. Buyer’s Premium\n\nA buyer’s premium will be charged in this sale or Buy Now Price. The buyer’s premium is an advertised percentage of the high bid or flat fee added to the high bid or Buy Now Price on an auction item to determine the total contract price to be paid by Buyer. For each Lot won a twenty percent (20%) buyer’s premium will be added to the amount of the high bid. For example, if the high bid is $100 and there is a twenty percent (20%) buyer’s premium, the premium will be $20.00, for a total bid of $120.00. Also shipping, handling, and tax (for residents of the State of Nevada) will be added to the total purchase price. Shipping amount is based on the real-time USPS rate lookup based on total weight of the Lots won. BIDAMI’s handling fee is a flat rate of $10.00 per sale, invoice not per Lot. The buyer’s premium does not create any agency relationship between Buyer and BIDAMI. BIDAMI is the agent of the seller only.\n\n4. Time of the Auction\n\nAn auction starts and will close on the dates specified on BIDAMI’s home page. However, BIDAMI follows the 10-minute rule. This rule means that the auction can continue for verified bidders that have bid on any particular lot prior to the 8:00 p.m. close. The auction does not close PER ITEM, but rather only closes when there has been no activity for the ENTIRE auction for 10 minutes. So it is possible for an item to sit for over 10 minutes without a bid as long as there is other activity in the auction, that item will remain open. The auction has ended when BIDAMI’s web site indicate BidAmi.com auction is closed. The time will expire warning that the auction will be ending. Announcements of the 10 Minute Rule and the auction slowing down and getting ready to close.\n\n5. Stop Payment/Insufficient Funds\n\nUpon making payment for a lot(s), no stop payment of funds will be honored.
