        "text": "View Author\n\n5\n\nMy heart skipped a beat when I saw this photo. I had the original leather bound cover (remember?) purchased proudly with the earnings from my newspaper route down at our local Peaches Records and Tapes. I wanted nothing more than to grow my hair long and wear that beautiful fringe jacket that David Crosby often wore, but my parents had different ideas about how their children should look. They were Nixon supporters. I haven’t listened to 'Déjà Vu' from beginning to end in a long time. But I played it so often it’s embedded in my memory. I was more curious if it still resonated with my heart. The answer is yes. Both for the glorious music but also for the spirit. Dylan prophesied a hard rain coming in 1963, and by 1970 he was already seeking shelter from the storm. CSNY filled the void, took up the mantle, like Elisha following Elijah. But this is another subject for another time. Back to the matter at hand. There were a couple of new things that surfaced for me during this particular listen, the first being that Neil Young is not really so much an equal partner with CSN on 'Déjà Vu' as he is a special guest on a few tracks. I couldn’t detect any Neil at all on the first two tracks, finally some guitar playing on the third. And then, of course, his own composition, ‘Helpless,’ and ending side one with his searing guitar solo on ‘Woodstock.’ But when side two opened with the title track, seemingly Neil had again taken five, and didn’t come back until the second to last song, another of his own compositions, ‘Country Girl.’ And he’s heard clearly on guitar rockin it up on the finale, ‘Everybody I Love You.’ Perhaps this is revealing of Neil’s divided commitment between his own solo stuff (which would ultimately triumph) and this super group. Truthfully (and I say this as a fan who thinks Neil sits at the right hand of only the Beatles), I don’t think CSN really needed Y. He certainly didn’t them, and ‘After The Gold Rush,’ ‘Harvest,’ ‘On The Beach,’ and the rest of his couple of dozen LPs following are proof. Even the cover photo features CSN in a perfect triangle, and faces up and illuminated; whereas Neil is on the furthest fringe, head bowed and darkened. Too Sergeant Pepper? And secondly, in addition to these songs being written mostly about the weal and woe of human relationships, might they also be referencing, if even subconsciously, the state of the baby boomer generation at that time, still very much in the midst of anti-war and civil rights demonstrations but losing the optimism that so permeated the summer of love three years before? Could not ‘Carry On,’ for example- an encouragement to keep struggling for love and not succumbing to despair following a breakup- also be heard as a call to the younger generation for the same resilience against the unjust, ruling status quo? ‘Teach Your Children’ becomes an appeal to both generations (young and old), both political parties, to learn to love one another. David Crosby pleading on ‘Almost Cut My Hair’ to not give in to fear as we figure out where to go from here as a country? Neil Young’s ‘place in north Ontario’ mirroring the distress of their American neighbors to the south? And ‘Woodstock’ speaks for itself, including the line ‘bomber death planes riding shotgun in the sky, turning into butterflies above the nation.’ I’ve always heard bomber jet planes, and had to stop the recording and listen again. In Joni Mitchell’s original lyrics, she just sing ‘bombers.’ I wonder which of the quartet added the word death? Side two opens with Crosby’s ponderings about ‘what’s going on under the ground? The anti-war underground movement? ‘Our House,’ a delightful song about hearth and home, has a hint of melancholy because that innocence Graham Nash is so wanting to hold onto is, on a national level, rapidly slipping away. ‘4 + 20’ finds Stephen Stills in such despair over his loss (of a lover), or perhaps the loss of actual lives both abroad in southeast Asia and also in the embittered civil rights battlefields of America’s deep south, that he ends the song wishing that his ‘life would simply cease.’ Neil’s ‘Country Girl,’ an invitation to leave the city and the other guy, and come to the country and be with me… might the other guy be Uncle Sam? And in the grand finale, ‘Everybody I Love You,’ when the whole gang fervently sings ‘You expect for me to love you when you hate yourself, my friend,’ to whom are they addressing, one American or the whole country? Again, I’ve been listening to this LP, off and on, for over 50 years, and am very familiar with the material. Or I thought I was. Funny how you can sometimes hear a song like ‘Teach Your Children Well,’ for years, and still, sometimes, hear something new. There’s no doubt it’s a good song. it’s just not one of my favorites, at least partly due to its popularity. I’ve simply heard it played too much. And so, by the time Nash begins the final verse I’ve already emotionally moved on to the next track with Crosby almost cutting his hair for cryin’ out loud! But on this particular listen for this review, I was reading the lyrics as if for the first time- Nash’s appeal at the end of the song to all Americans, young and old, hawks and doves, to trust in the power of love to affect reconciliation; or as the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said so famously, ‘Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend’: ‘And you of the tender years can’t (possibly) know the fears that your elders grew by. And, so, please help (and not hurt) them with your youth. They seek the truth (like you/we do) before they can die.’ (Italics are mine) Musically, what can I add? You’ve got Crosby singing both his heart and angelic voice out on ‘Almost Cut My Hair,’ Nash’s high register, and slightly British accent throughout, not to mention his underrated song writing talent, both Stills and Young’s unique lead guitar playing (two great tastes that go great together.) But please don’t let the famous quartet overshadow the workingman drumming of Dallas Taylor, and most especially, the incredible touch of Greg Reeves, playing bass parts that rival Paul McCartney’s own melodic, creative roaming. And of course, Jerry Garcia famously drops right in and sits right down at pedal steel on ‘Teach.’ Sure, CSNY are all old and fat (except for the fountain of youth Graham Nash), and sometimes cantankerous and crotchety and such, now. But if you just could have heard them then, if but for a brief moment… Ah, that’s a déjà vu I would welcome today ‘… with all of you.’\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nCorny, Stale, Naff, and Yawn\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nwhat a weird juxtaposition this album is. the music in the background is alright, some bits are quite enjoyable, but the singing grates. for starters i can't really be arsed with neil youngs voice and then when they do that super 70s harmonised singing stuff it doubles the pain.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nPerfect inflection point between 60’s folk/rock and what was to come in the early 70’s for rock. Everybody was for a moment in that band totally together and making a near perfect album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic songs, beautiful melodies, exquisite guitar playing - an album that seems to capture the mood of the moment as the folky, peaceful, acoustic sixties (Deja Vu, Our House) turns into the gritty, tribal, rocky seventies (Almost Cut My Hair, Woodstock). This is America.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nThis one I struggled with. It is a technically well done album but most of the tracks just dont land for me. Songs that hit a more folk rock tone like Woodstock are generally enjoyable but tracks like Helpless just don't work for me.

This is the very definition of a supergroup. A band of talented musicians whose names extend beyond the bands they were once a part of, where each member has major contributions in the album, and none of which is lacking. Stills and Young carried Buffalo Springfield... their songs were always the strongest. Crosby was always my favorite Byrd after McGuinn. And although I don't know much about Nash alone, I loved the hits of the Hollies so much I was once disappointed they never had a consistent album. Here we have a collection of masterpieces, hit after the next. They're all very strong songwriters, vocalists, and instrumentalists. I love how this album rotates through all 4 of them. On both sides you have a song written and primarily sung by each member, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Nash writes the melodic pop hits you sing around the campfire. Young probably has the best written songs, they sound like solo material but with the ever pleasing harmonic back vocals. Yet, they're not out of place. Stills has the most colorful songs... strong forward vocalist, his composition skills in roots genres are best showcased in his later album Manassas. All three of his songs are amazing, and props to Mitchell for writing \"Woodstock,\" I wouldn't have been able to tell without looking it up. Crosby has the most dramatic songs, the instrumentals are incredibly rich and ever-changing, like proggy folk. All of these songs could be star tracks on their own. The only track I don't think is perfect is the closing \"Everybody I Love You\"... it's merely superb. Pop folk doesn't get much better that this. The harmonious vocals is something I always strive to find in other music, and only then could I only compare them to the standards of these guys.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nFor a super group it didn't sound like the best of any of their offerings\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nCSNY are a super group I get behind. I saw these guys in April 2000, and they put on a 3.5 hour show! Impressive for a bunch of guys in their mid to upper 50s. I can’t find the specific set list, but the average set for that tour was 30 songs (includes 2 encores). That’s a lot of entertainment for $40. This album is loaded with great songs! It’s starts off with one of my CSNY favorites, Carry On. I love the opening, pressing guitar part and the break of styles halfway through. Our house is a beautiful song born out of one of life’s ordinary moments when Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell bought a vase one day. There’s even a song about a hippie almost cutting his hair. Unfortunately track 9 is a stinker and track 10 is just OK. For all I care this album stops after track 8. And fuck are they an incredible 8 tracks! It’s interesting to me that almost every song on this album was written by one member alone and not in collaboration. The final product is cohesive and seamlessly blends their instrumentals and voices together. It’s hard to believe they didn’t write together. In order of preference, I like the songs by Stills the most (Carry On and 4+ 20), then Nash (Our House and Teach Your Children), Crosby (Déjà Vu and Almost Cut My Hair), and Young (Helpless and Country Girl). Joni Mitchell’s Woodstock is quite good too. Young and Stills both wrote the closer, Everybody I Love You.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nJust listened to the 50th anniversary of this record. Good lord is it good. Every song is a gem. The volitility of the personnel in this band is completely quelled when they are able to make the music they all love to make together. These songs are beautiful, heartfelt, and purely collaborative. One can listen and reflect and weep both out of sadness and happiness at the same time. A masterpiece.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nThat's a hell of an opening track. Fav track is definetly Almost Cut My Hair. Deja Vu and Country Girl are strong contenders too.

Wonderful vocal harmonies en great songs!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's voices when they harmonize is the sound of the horns you hear at St. Peter's Pearly Gates. Yes, better than Van Halen. Yes, better than the Eagles. YES, better than The Beatles (sorry, I don't make the rules). There is not a single bad song on this album, and while it's distinctly a folk-rock record, there is so much sound that comes from it that nothing sounds the same. I can see why some think Our House is a little out of place, but to me it adds a lot more diversity to the sound this album represents. Modern folk and Americana artists owe a lot to this band, but specifically this album. This is a masterclass in guitar songwriting and playing. Absolutely one of my favorite records of all time. Favorite Songs: Carry On, Helpless Least Favorite: 4 + 20\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIf ever there were a case for letting your freak flag fly, this album might be it. CSNY are in peak form here, with their signature tight harmonies, lyrics of protest & empowerment, virtuosic guitar playing, and all around 60s love. Each member has a chance to shine, but it's when they all come together as a cohesive whole that this album transcends. \"Carry On\", the opener, is a prime example - the harmonies rarely more impressive, the organ & Young's guitar riffing off of each other, the message one of eternal love & peace. Jerry Garcia's pedal steel adds some nice twang to the soulful \"Teach Your Children\", and Young's \"Helpless\" aches with raw emotion. \"Our House\" might be the weakest entry here, for my money, but it does boast a unique vocal from Nash, perhaps the most underrated of the \"supergroup\". But for me, it's \"Woodstock\" that puts this album over the edge - an amalgam of music and vocal that encapsulates the 60s. This rockin' reinvention of a rather turgid Joni Mitchell tune puts us on an astral plane with CSNY, where we're all stardust. Perfection. I might normally rank this a high 4 stars, but I'm pushing it up to a 5, just to piss off the whiners.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nReally really good. Love the harmonies, the melodies, and the instrumentation. My favorite songs are: Almost Cut My Hair, and Deja Vu. I still don't love Neil Young's voice, but I like it with the rest of the band.

Fantastic harmonies, fine musicianship, great tunes - what's not to like? Still holds up after 50+ years, although you can argue that Country Girl is filler and that Our House is as weak as a kitten. Imagine what they could have done if they hadn't been perpetually wasted and/or soaked in booze.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nDeja Vu tuned in perfectly with this rainy Sunday evening, which surprised me, as I came here to bury CSNY. Their harmonies have made my ears itch, most irritatingly on Through My Sails, which manages to mar the otherwise perfect Zuma right at the death. The harmonies are here too, almost immediately with Carry On, but the music around it, moody, dense and put together with what feels like obsessive meticulousness, lit me up. Started laughing when Almost Cut My Hair started, accepted I liked it by its end. Was scrubbing the dining room floor when Our House came on and was transported to a happy memories from hearing it close to forty years ago in the family car - perhaps trite to many, but immensely moving in my current circumstances. Must be a great album if a couple of decent NY songs are alright inclusions rather than standouts? Am writing this after a first listen. Will score it after a second or third tomorrow, making this a sort of anti-cliffhanger (only the writer remains in suspense at any point). Monday update: my score reflects cowardice.

For the millions of people who are of a similar viewpoint, it's probably the same (or else you've heard the songs so much by now you ever want to hear them again!). Not much point in commenting on the style - excellent songwriting and musicianship, each member definitely contributing their own unique flair (and apparently almost all at different times - there was much conflict among the members while recording, so the stories go...). If nothing else, it's a great and important document of the biggest and/or most important music of the time. It does falter just a little for me at the end (it frustrates me when albums do that - save me a golden nugget for the album closer plz (...eagerly awaiting Who's Next...)) but the first 7-8 tracks are all too great to knock this down a star. 9/10 5 stars\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWell, I was today years old when I discovered that 'Our House' was CSN&T.

So far.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat throwback of the era where they experimented with great guitar riffs.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nTo sie nazywa albumik na rozpoczecie 2k22, klasyczny material folkowego rocka, bedacy prawdopodobnie magnum opus bandy, a jednoczesnie pierwsza plyta ktora nagrywali kwartetem z Neilem Youngiem w skladzie, 36 minut materialu, ktory jest dosc rowno podzielony miedzy czlonkow zespolu, ale jednak z widocznie mniejszym udzialem Younga, jesli chodzi o instrumentale, w ogole ciekawie nagrywali material, bo kazdy sobie ogarnial sesje na swoje traki i tylko prosil innych czego potrzebowali zeby im nagrali, wiec bardzo inwidualne podejscie do tworzenia, ale sprawdza sie ta formula, bo traki wyraznie roznia sie od siebie i nawet nie po samych wokalach, ale wykorzystanych instrumentalach da sie poznac do kogo nalezy dany kawalek, skoro kazdy pisal i tworzy pod siebie, to nie ma tutaj zbytniej spojnosci lirycznej w postaci motywu przewodniego, opener bedzie prawdopodbnie inspirowany tym, ze cale trio CSN bylo zdumpowane w tamtym okresie, wiec carrujom naprzod wiadrami copium, ale beda tez lekcje boomerskie dla nowofagow i o tym jak to kazde pokolenie ma swoj czas, czy o nie scinaniu kudlow jako symbolu hameryki walczacej, kazdy z czlonkow ma cos co chce przekazac i na 10 trakach udalo sie sporo tego przemycic, albo raczej na 9, bo woodstock jest coverem joni mitchell, fenomenem tej plyty jest to, ze jest tak rowna a jednoczesnie tak roznorodna, co slychac rowniez w samej technice nagrywania poszczegolnych kawalkow, sa tutaj utwory oparte na jednym instrumencie jak 4+ 20 Stillsa, gdzie caly kawalek jest tworzony przez jednego akustyka, a sa kawalki jak country girll czy carry on gdzie wykorzystywana jest sciana dzwieku, nakladajace sie na siebie instrumenty budujace wrazenie orkiestrowego brzmienia a w innych miejscach wrecz szumu tla zeby jeszcze bardziej spotengowac efekty harmonii z ktorych zespol byl znany juz nawet na debiutanckim krazku, a z dodatkowym glosem jeszcze lepiej to brzmi, ciezko jest wybrac ulubione kawalki z takiego materialu, ale zrobie miejsce na plejce dla kazdego z czlonkow, wiec teach your children Nasha, 4 + 20 Stillsa, helpless Younga i tytulowy deja vu Crosbiego, a calosc do biblioteczki spotifajowej, bo to jedna z tych plyt ktore sluchaja sie same od poczatku do konca\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nBeautiful harmonies, great guitar sound, several outstanding tracks - helpless, our house, teach your children - don't always like the melodies, but the overall sound is always soothing. I played is on repeat all day and loved every second.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLOVE AMAZING\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAlways been a favorite\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nCrosby, Stills, and Nash really nailed something by adding Neil Young to their lineup. He not only brings some extra great harmonies, I just love it when they cut loose and really rock out. The mellow songs are relaxing and gorgeously arranged, with some of the harmonies giving genuine chills. Just a tight set of songs. As a total aside, I would get this record the day Neil Young pulled his catalog from Spotify (fuck 'em, though, Neil is right). Favorite tracks: \"Woodstock\", \"Country Girl\", \"Almost Cut My Hair\", \"Carry On\"\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat vocals, harmonies, guitar solos, drumming, and beautifully mixed.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nОтличная старая музыка\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI’m so addicted with this album.
