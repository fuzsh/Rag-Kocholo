        "text": "The supergroup.\n\nIf you played rock in the 1960’s, odds are you were part of a group. Solo artists stuck primarily to adult-oriented pop, country, or folk. By the end of the decade these groups started to show signs of fracturing, but artists weren’t quite ready for solo careers — first of all, the pressure is all on you, and secondly, this is still the 60’s, man, and united we stand. Smile on your brother! Get together! Share the land!\n\nThis attitude would soon change in the 1970s, but that’s how it was when David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash found themselves harmonizing at a casual get together in Laurel Canyon, the rustic and rural mountainside artistic community in the heart of Los Angeles. The Byrds had kicked out Crosby, Buffalo Springfield collapsed on Stills, and Nash left The Hollies due to his dissatisfaction with their musical direction. Once the three of them discovered their magical harmonic blend, little question remained that they would join forces. In a way, they were the hippie ideal — look what we can accomplish when we work together.\n\nWorking together produced a massive hit album. But Stills wanted another guitar player to duel with like he had in Buffalo Springfield, and luckily his former bandmate, one Neil Young, was available and game to try. Crosby and Nash had concerns — why mess with success? Also, Neil was known to be mercurial, to say the very least. But the magic still worked with four of them, and Neil was the least of their problems.\n\nDrugs and ego killed the band in late 1970 (for the first, though certainly not the last, time) but they continued coming back in various configurations of two, three, or sometimes four over the ensuing decades, unable to resist their love for each other and for the music.\n\nThey are one person, they are two alone, they are three together, they are for each other. Here’s the least you need to know:\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash (1969) Say, can I have some of your purple berries? A perfect album for 1969. AM and FM radio hits. Traditional and progressive. Relaxed folk pop mixed in with hard rock. With harmonies to blow your mind. Talkin’ ’bout very free and easy.\n\nDéjà Vu (1970) Like the debut, but with Neil Young added on guitar. Cozy intimacy next to generational anthems. A very, very, very fine album.\n\nIt’s not on either recommended album, but you should also know the single “Ohio.” Recorded and released within weeks of the National Guard shootings on campus at Kent State, “Ohio” was an emotional response to the senseless deaths, an angry cry against the establishment:"
