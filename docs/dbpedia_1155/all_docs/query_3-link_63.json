        "text": "A bunch o' years ago, I decided to try to see if this were true, if you could put together a compilation album featuring every single permutation of CSNY. It seems to be possible, if all the information I used in compiling this is correct.\n\nI never actually tried to make the compilation album, since I don't have most of this material and don't much care for CSNY anyway. But this is what it would look like:\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash and Young - Ohio (2:58) from a single, 1970.\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash - Suite: Judy Blue Eyes (7:25) from Crosby, Stills and Nash, 1969.\n\nCrosby, Stills and Young - Alabama (4:02) from Harvest, 1972.\n\nCrosby, Nash and Young - Music is Love (3:16) from If I Could Only Remember My Name, 1971.\n\nStills, Nash and Young - Words (Between the Lines of Age) (6:40) from Harvest, 1972.\n\nCrosby and Stills - Long Time Gone (4:36) from CSN Demos, recorded 1968.\n\nCrosby and Nash - To the Last Whale: Critical Mass / Wind on the Water (5:33) from Wind on the Water, 1975.\n\nCrosby and Young - Revolution Blues (4:03) from On the Beach, 1974.\n\nStills and Nash - Southern Cross (4:41) from Daylight Again, 1982.\n\nStills and Young - Long May You Run (3:53) from Long May You Run, 1976.\n\nNash and Young - War Song (3:35) from a single, 1972.\n\nCrosby - Orleans (1:56) from If I Could Only Remember My Name, 1971.\n\nStills - Love the One You're With (3:04) from Stephen Stills, 1970.\n\nNash - Chicago (2:55) from Songs for Beginners, 1971.\n\nYoung - Heart of Gold (3:07) from Harvest, 1972.\n\nThe biggest cheat here is \"Revolution Blues\", which Crosby doesn't sing on but only plays guitar on. Still...\n\nJust as an aside, I would add Crosby and Nash's \"Immigration Man.\" Great song! Listen here:\n\nThanks for posting this\n\nGreat collection of tracks Jerry. Thanks for compiling it.\n\nBut, I'd seriously think out majorly rearranging the track sequence.\n\nRevolution Blues IS probably my favorite track on here, its IN!!!\n\nI'd say the fact that he mentions/complains in EVERY interview and often on his twitter that he's in desperate need of a big CSNY payday to save his personal finances means he cares - A LOT!!!\n\nSure he was referring more to a big money-making tour, rather than just a studio album, but since tours are out of the question for the time being, I think he'd be quite happy to be involved with a CSNY album (and quite unhappy to be excluded from one).\n\nCredited as such in real time? No.\n\nIncluding previously unreleased outtakes credited as such included/debuting on boxsets - I think so - and if not then VERY nearly.\n\nActually without researching it and going just off the top of my head, SN&Y might be the only one that hasn't been done (officially- as in an official release credited as such).\n\nI bolded \"credited as such\" to point out the difference between that and solo album tracks, where one or more of the others act as guests/session musicians/singers.\n\nThough not originally credited as such, \"Music Is Love\" from Crosby's IOICRMN album, when included on Neil's Archive Vol 1 boxset was credited to Crosby, Nash & Young as performers - which was always how the songwriting was credited on the track.\n\nThere always seems to have been two \"factions\" in the band - C+N and S+Y. According to Stills, fairly early on Crosby and Nash bonded very tightly during a long boat trip which Stills had declined to join them on, and he became pretty much a third wheel socially with them ever since.\n\nDespite their collisions, Young is always very complimentary (sometimes even sounding somewhat protective) of Stills. He has said that C+N just don't \"get\" Stills at all, and how brilliant he is and how valuable he is, and that he (Young) does since he was there from the beginning (Buffalo Springfield) and knows him so much better than the other two do.\n\nPlus I have a feeling that Nash did duo albums with Crosby (at least in part) as a favor, since Crosby was so non-prolific as a writer in the 1970s that he might have only managed to write enough songs for one solo album in the 1970s (post 1971's IICORMN) if he hadn't gotten three albums shared with Nash (on which Nash always had slightly more songs than Crosby) - while Nash in addition to the 3 C+N 1970's albums also released (in addition to his debut 1971 Songs For Beginners 2 more solo albums in the 1970s - in 1974 and in Feb 1980 (but recorded in the 70s so - close enough). Crosby's second solo album OTOH didn't come out until 1989.\n\nAs to why Atlantic didn't want a S+N album without Crosby in 1982 - it was likely because the trio's cultural relevance (together and apart) was at an all time low, and also their biggest hits had always been when they recorded together in 1969 and 1977."
