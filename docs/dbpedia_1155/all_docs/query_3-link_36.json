        "text": "When that first Crosby, Stills, and Nash album dropped in May of 1969, I was hooked. Their melodies were infectious, and their songs were filled with angelic three-part harmonies. You couldn't help but sing along. Lou and I were fortunate enough to talk with David semi-regularly, and to this day, they remain as some of our favorite interviews.\n\nIn 2016, David Crosby talked about his feud with Graham Nash and being asked to be the sperm donor for Melissa Etheridge.\n\nDuring this interview, we asked Croz about ripping Ted Nugent on Twitter.\n\nAccording to an article in the San Diego Union-Tribune dated March 24, 2016, David Crosby and Graham Nash had a falling out in 2016. David claimed that Nash's 2013 memoir, Wild Tales: A Rock & Roll Life contributed to their spat. David said, \"I was very unhappy about it. It’s a very shallow, very self-serving book – and full of BS. Chock-full.”\n\nDavid Crosby released his first solo album in February 1971 titled, 'If I Could Only Remember My Name.' In September 2017, Crosby dropped his sixth solo album, 'Sky Trails,' featuring his son, James Raymond, who produced and played keyboards. We asked David to talk about his 'Sky Trails' tour.\n\nIn May 2015, we invited Croz on the show to chat about his years with CSNY and his upcoming solo tour with a new band.\n\nIn May 2019, David joined the \"Ethan and Lou Show\" and buried Ted Nugent in a deep Twitter hole that no one could escape from.\n\nEven though David didn't mask his hate for Kanye, he did admit he liked and enjoyed Chance the Rapper.\n\nIt's no secret that rocker Melissa Etheridge and Crosby were dear friends, so much so that Etheridge asked David to be the sperm donor for two of her children. We invited Melissa to join the Ethan and Lou show to talk about her friend, David Crosby.\n\nTop 100 Classic Rock Artists"
