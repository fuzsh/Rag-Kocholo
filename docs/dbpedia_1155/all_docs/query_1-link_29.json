        "text": "I'm posting all three of my alternate universe mid-1970s CSNY studio albums at once, because I think it helps to see them as a whole entity. In addition to trying to avoid include some from solo albums of the era (unless they were done in CSNY versions), I've also avoided duplicating songs from album to album in this alternate universe.\n\nThis second album is arguably more contrived that the other two, \"Human Highway\" and \"Long May You Run.\" Basically, from around 1973 to 1976, CSNY struggled to make a single group album, but personality issues kept getting in the way. In the beginning, the album was to be called \"Human Highway,\" but by 1976 it was going to be called \"Long May You Run.\" (That title went to a Stills-Young album that was released that year instead. There never really was a planned album with the title \"Hawaiian Sunrise.\" But I've got enough material for three albums, and it seems like as good of a title as any.\n\nAlthough I tried to avoid using tracks from solo albums of the time, I made one important exception here. \"Through My Sails\" came out on Neil Young's \"Zuma\" album in 1976 after it became clear the CSNY album wasn't going to happen, with all of CSNY performing on it. Strangely, despite it being a really great song in my opinion, Young has never performed the song in concert, and the \"Zuma\" version is the only version that exists. It's not clear when CSNY recorded this song, but it could have been from 1974 or 1975. Young recorded a solo demo of it in 1974.\n\nA couple of the songs here are actually solo performances, but that's okay because CSN or CSNY albums usually have one or two of those on them anyway, such as \"4 + 20\" on the \"Deja Vu\" album. Note that one such song, \"Treetop Flyer,\" came out on Stills' archival release \"Just Roll Tape- April 26, 1968.\" But if you read the fine print of that album's liner notes, it's the one song from the album that was recorded in the mid-1970s instead of 1968.\n\n01 Pushed It Over the End (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n02 My Angel (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n03 Fieldworker (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n04 Carry Me (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n05 Traces (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n06 It's All Right (Crosby & Nash)\n\n07 My Love Is a Gentle Thing (Stephen Stills)\n\n08 Hawaiian Sunrise (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n09 Homeward through the Haze (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\n10 Another Sleep Song (Crosby & Nash)\n\n11 Treetop Flyer (Stephen Stills)\n\n12 Through My Sails (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n\nhttps://www.upload.ee/files/16383850/CROSBSTLLSNSHYNG1975HwiinSnrse_atse.zip.html\n\nFor the album cover, I got lucky and found a beautiful photo of Crosby's boat \"The Mayan\" sailing on the ocean at either sunset or sunrise. I figure that's a fitting cover for an album called \"Hawaiian Sunrise.\""
