        "text": "Graham Nash walked onto the stage of the restored 150-year-old Baptist church that now goes by the name of the Homer Arts Center, in central New York, and shrugged, “So… Homer, eh?”\n\nOne wouldn’t blame the two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for being a bit underwhelmed; I’m guessing the 400-seat capacity room is the smallest crowd he’s played to in ages.\n\nBut, despite a career in the spotlight that has seen worldwide success with The Hollies, Crosby, Stills, Nash & (sometimes) Young, and now a solo career with a seemingly-endless recent tour of dates throughout the globe, Nash is wired differently than your usual pampered rock star. When you are lucky enough to see him up close (like from my seat in the second row), it is abundantly clear from the outset that Graham does not “mail it in.” His passion for his music and his respect for his audience (of any size) is immediately palpable. He has sung many of these songs hundreds of times in his career, in venues easily ten times the size of this one, and yet we got his “A” game.\n\nAccompanying Nash were two immensely-talented sidemen. Shane Fontayne (from England), who has worked in the past with Lone Justice, Sting, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen, is a virtuoso guitarist, and a more than capable harmony singer (a must for Nash’s songs). Fontayne has been Graham’s touring and writing partner since 2014. Rounding out the trio was longtime CSN band keyboard player Todd Caldwell (from Lubbock, TX), who shines on the Hammond B3 organ, and sings perfect high harmonies when needed. He performed shoeless, better to operate the B3’s foot pedals and to show off his pair of red Flash (the comic book superhero) socks with lightning bolts on them!\n\nAt one point in the show, Nash said when performing his songs, he really tries to get in touch with how he was feeling when he wrote them, adding the punchline, “And man, was I depressed!” But intense feelings are what usually moves a songwriter to create a song, and if those feelings are sadness or heartbreak, so be it.\n\nSeeing Nash with such a small and devoted group of fans was like being in an exclusive club. As I was entering the hall, I heard two men behind me comparing notes on other Graham performances, with one mentioning having seen the Hollies in 1968 at SUNY Cortland; wow! And there was a familiarity with Nash and his life story, that almost went without saying. Graham would often introduce songs, name-checking people in his life, with the assumption that we all knew who he was talking about; “Here’s a song I wrote the morning Joan broke up with me,” he said, introducing Simple Man (with the clear implication that we knew he was talking about Joni Mitchell). And we all did!\n\nNow in his sixth decade as a performer, Nash has hundreds of songs to draw on, and he covers a lot of ground, from his earliest US hit with the Hollies, Bus Stop, to a new protest song about racial unrest in the sixties, called Mississippi Burning. In between, we got his major hits from his CSNY years, and even the surprise versions of three Stephen Stills’ songs, Find The Cost Of Freedom, 4 + 20, and Love The One Your With, and an even more surprising cover of The Beatles’ A Day In The Life, with the entire arrangement intact…. amazing!\n\nGraham Nash has a long history – in and out of CSNY – as a political and environmental activist, penning songs and speaking out about everything from Vietnam, Kent State, nuclear waste, prison reform, racial unrest, the environment and more recently, supporting the Occupy movement in NYC. Given that, he was surprisingly circumspect about the current state of politics in America. Introducing his 60’s anthem, Chicago, he said, “I was born in England, but I’ve been a US citizen for over 40 years now, and all I can say is, this country deserves better,” to sustained applause.\n\nAfter appropriately closing with Just A Song Before I Go, Nash came back with a three-song encore.\n\nThe first was Buddy Holly’s Everyday, done with just Fontayne on acoustic guitar and the three of them gathered around one mic, a la early Crosby, Stills & Nash, singing the entire song in three-part harmony, lovely and unforgettable.Then came Our House, with Nash urging the crowd to sing along, and smiling broadly when we did, full-throatedly and on key!\n\nThat left – maybe – his most famous song, Teach Your Children. After recognizing the activism of students from Parkland high school in Florida, and recent outspoken climate change firebrand, Greta Thunberg, he dedicated it to all the teachers in the world, and invited us all, again, to sing along. Such a beautiful, intimate moment, one could see he was genuinely touched that this small, intimate crowd was making such a beautiful noise, singing along with his words and music. Is there any better compliment for a songwriter?\n\nWhat I haven’t mentioned yet, but what is the single most impressive part of the entire night, is Graham Nash’s voice. He’s always had that piercing high voice that stood out in any of his groups. His harmony singing in The Hollies (Bus Stop, Look Through Any Window, Carrie Anne, etc), is what caught the ear of David Crosby and Stephen Stills, and got him invited to Mama Cass Elliot’s Laurel Canyon bungalow in 1968, which led to the formation of Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nIt is also that voice, along with his longtime (but now, sadly estranged) partner David Crosby, that had a starring harmony role on records by Jackson, Browne, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Carole King, Art Garfunkel, Elton John, David Gilmour, John Mayer and many, many others.\n\nAnd you think you know his voice from the records but, to see him live, in a stripped-down setting (from the second row, no less) is utterly breathtaking and, at times, goosebump-inducing. At 77, he shouldn’t sound nearly this good and, yet, he seems to get stronger as the night goes on. After singing every song for nearly two hours (something he never had to do in The Hollies, CSNY or even Crosby & Nash), he is still is at full power on the encores. Wow!\n\nOne other thing about his voice is his unique delivery; his diction is impeccable! It’s almost as if he cares so much about the lyrics he’s written and what they express, that he’s speaking them to you, while at the same time articulating every melody with the grace of the best singers. There really is no singer I’ve ever seen quite like Graham Nash.\n\nGolden Days is a song from his most recent album, THIS PATH TONIGHT (2015), which he performed at this show. The poignant lyrics simultaneously look back, while also looking forward, with hope for a brighter future, and ends with these lines:\n\nSongs with soul, and words with so much hope\n\nFor a brighter day\n\nOh, I know that people hurt, but they try to find a better way\n\nTo these golden days\n\nOn a bone-chilling and rainy October night in Homer, NY, I felt incredibly lucky to be a part of Graham Nash’s own golden days.\n\nSet One\n\nFind The Cost Of Freedom (Stephen Stills)\n\nWasted On the Way\n\nBus Stop (Graham Gouldman)\n\nI Used To Be A King\n\n4 + 20 (Stephen Stills)\n\nRight Between The Eyes\n\nImmigration Man\n\nSleep Song\n\nCarried Away\n\nMilitary Madness\n\nA Day In The Life (John Lennon/Paul McCartney)\n\nSet Two\n\nMarrakesh Express\n\nSimple Man\n\nTaken At All (David Crosby/Graham Nash)\n\nWounded Bird\n\nGolden Days (Graham Nash/Shane Fontane)\n\nLove The One Your With (Stephen Stills)\n\nWind On The Water\n\nCathedral\n\nJust A Song Before I Go\n\nEncore\n\nEveryday (Buddy Holly/Norman Petty)\n\nOur House\n\nTeach Your Children\n\n(All songs by Graham Nash, except where noted)\n\n“David Crosby has no hits,” I explained to a woman on the subway last January, after seeing him and his band at the City Winery in NYC. She thought the show was good, but lamented that he didn’t do “the hits.” For me, that’s the beauty of David Crosby. Oh sure, he’s scored a few FM classics like Guinevere, and the title song from the CSNY album, Deja Vu, but no real AM radio play to speak of. Even his Phil Collins co-penned and produced comeback single, Hero, in 1993, failed to crack the Top 40, stalling at #44.\n\nHis compositions have always been too far outside of the mainstream to be hit singles. His style is esoteric, with alternate tunings, dense chords and unpredictable rhythms, not exactly the stuff of Top 40 radio. He has sung on his share of hits, soaring above Roger McGuinn on Mr. Tambourine and numerous other Byrds’ songs, and again on the gold records he created with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young. But he didn’t write those songs.\n\nIn spite of that, or maybe because of that (some cynical friends might argue), I’ve always found Crosby’s songs to sit head and shoulders above those of his partners. Something in his musical voice speaks to me in a way that very few artists have. With each new CSN or Crosby/Nash album, I would immediately scan the credits to see how many David songs there were; not that I needed the credits to identify his always-unique compositions, his songs have always, for me, stood out.\n\nFor over forty years now, I’ve followed Crosby’s tumultuous career, filled with great music and successful world tours, then drug abuse, weight gain and his ultimate incarceration where he kicked his drug habit in a Texas lock-up. How the mighty had fallen. But like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, Crosby stayed clean, got a new liver, became a father again, and wrote, not one, but, two memoirs (Long Time Gone & Since Then), along with a book on musicians – like himself – who have tried to make a difference in the world through their music and their beliefs (Stand And Be Counted). He has also been more prolific than he has in decades contributing to new albums by CSN, CSNY & Crosby/Nash, along with several new solo releases, including his 2014 solo CD, Croz.\n\nI first saw Crosby live with the legendary 1974 CSNY tour at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, NY. I remember being thrilled that I was finally seeing them all live, especially, Crosby. But imagine my disappointment when they only did four of his songs (in a 28-song set), and one of them was (for me) the forgettable, Almost Cut My Hair. Not nearly enough Crosby for my tastes.\n\nEleven years later in 1985, CSN played for the first time at the NY State Fair and I, of course, was there. This time, I later learned, Crosby was in the throes of junkiedom, and barely contributed. In a 21 song set, he was featured on just three songs, Guinevere, Delta and on the encore, Long Time Gone. He looked bad, but still – somehow – sounded great. His autobiography revealed that at that time, he spent more time offstage than on, smoking a crack pipe. In retrospect, the show was hardly even worth attending.\n\nOver the next two decades, as Crosby very publicly sought to rebuild his reputation, I skipped many opportunities to see CSN, as I had no wish to sit through any more performances by Stephen Stills, who I felt had outlived his musical usefulness for me.\n\nAs luck would have it, David and Graham Nash released a brand new double CD (Crosby Nash) in 2007, and toured with a band to support it. I was able to see one of the shows in Schenectady in October 2007 and it was like a dream come true. In truly democratic fashion, half of the 22 songs were David’s, and the presentation was subtle, with plenty of room to hear and appreciate the unparalleled harmony singing of Crosby & Nash. I walked out of the show thinking it couldn’t get any better than that. I was wrong.\n\nLast year, Crosby released his first new studio album in 19 years called, simply, Croz. The album featured some of his best songs in decades and received unanimously-positive reviews. When I heard he was doing a solo band tour, I knew I had to make every effort to attend. My purest dose of Crosby yet, I assumed. I was there for the opening night of the tour and I was not disappointed!\n\nBacked by a very sympathetic band (featuring his extremely talented son James Raymond), and by that I mean, musicians who support the songs rather than overwhelm them, David did the entire new album live for the first set. How many other artists in their 70s have the nerve AND confidence to do that? Amazing! As the set ended, he promised to come out for the second set and play songs that the crowd would know. Which was true for crowd members like myself, but not so much for the lady I met on the subway after the show. He did open with the Byrds’ classic, Eight Miles High, but after that, pretty much no hits; just lots of uniquely-beautiful songs that only David Crosby could write. I remember thinking that it certainly couldn’t get any better than that, but again, I was wrong.\n\nLast week I drove to Albany to see Crosby on his first ever solo acoustic tour. Just David, his guitar, and that voice, still somehow miraculously intact after all those years of illness and abuse. He sounds like a man half his age. I know of no other singer of his vintage who still sounds exactly the same as they did decades ago (OK, maybe Al Jardine, but he’s a supporting player). Every song was in a different tuning (he kept his guitar tech quite busy), and his playing was superb. His alway-outspoken onstage demeanor was more entertaining than ever, with digressions aplenty about Neil, Joni, the Byrds and, of course, politics (big surprise, he LOVES Bernie Sanders).\n\nCrosby, at 73, is still a live wire. But also a gentle soul with a unique musical voice that easily induces goosebumps. Seeing and hearing him alone with just his guitar and that mesmerizing voice, I got my most intense dose of David Crosby yet.\n\nPure Croz. Only took me 40+ years to get there."
