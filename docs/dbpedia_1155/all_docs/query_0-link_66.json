Thatâs proven true ever since.\n\n15\n\nDown by the River\n\nA tale of murder and betrayal served up in song, Young has offered numerous explanations for its meaning since its initial appearance on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere - his first foray with Crazy Horse.\n\nWhatever the reason, it typifies Youngâs penchant for blending verve and volume in the most mesmerizing manner.\n\n14\n\nCinnamon Girl\n\nWistful and relentless in equal measure, âCinnamon Girlâ encapsulates a dream lover for whom he âwaits between showsâ hoping that sheâll appear.\n\nSung in steady harmony and boasting a single note guitar solo, itâs an excellent example of one of Youngâs best early rockers and a song that been shared in concert throughout his career.\n\n13\n\nCowgirl in the Sand\n\nAnother Young classic culled from that first venture with Crazy Horse, it also describes an idealized lover whose promiscuity renders her seemingly well out of reach.\n\nAn ongoing staple throughout Youngâs live and recorded trajectory, it found new life through CSNY, the Byrds (via their self-titled reunion LP) and Young himself in various live incarnations.\n\n12\n\nTell Me Why\n\nInexplicable in its meaning even by Youngâs standards, the soothing melody made lines like âIs it hard to make arrangements with yourself / When youâre old enough to repay / But young enough to sellâ seem somewhat plausible regardless.\n\nAn astute example of classic Young in full folkie flourish, it remains a superb sing-along.\n\n11\n\nHelpless\n\nRecorded by CSNY, âHelplessâ conveys a sense of melancholy and dismay, yet still allows room for nuanced nostalgia.\n\nWhen Young sings of that âtown in North Ontarioâ, a place that offers âdream comfort memory to spareâ, he gives the impression that even in despair, thereâs still comfort found through preserving the past.\n\n10\n\nComputer Age\n\nYoung shocked both fans and critics when he suddenly immersed himself in the sound of synths.\n\nYet underlying it all was a sense of irony and alienation, a somewhat cynical view of a so-called New Age.\n\nThe lyric that reads âYou need me like ugly needs a mirrorâ sums up that stance succinctly.\n\n9\n\nCortez the Killer\n\nA scorching rocker that resonates to this day, 'Cortez the Killer' was inspired by the Spanish conquistador Cortez.\n\nIt offers a searing indictment of the cruelty with which he conquered the Aztecs in the 16th century, before segueing into a romantic reference about a woman who left him behind.\n\nItâs an inexplicable connection but brazenly Young.\n\n8\n\nLike a Hurricane\n\nAnother turbulent tour-de-force, this constant staple helped earn Young his reputation as âthe Godfather of Grungeâ.\n\nIndeed, with its fierce guitar solo and literal allusions, it remains an expansive, expressive and enduring anthem.\n\nSupposedly inspired by Del Shannonâs âRunaway,â it soars on drive and defiance alone.\n\n7\n\nThe Needle and the Damage Done\n\nA sad and somber soliloquy written in response to the overdose of his Crazy Horse collaborator Danny Whitten, it became a dire warning about the scourge of heroin addiction.\n\nHearing it now, it still sounds now as harrowing as ever.\n\n6\n\nOhio\n\nA stirring indictment of the murders of the Kent State college students by the National Guard in 1970, âOhioâ became a rallying cry for the anti-war movement, encapsulating the anguish and outrage of that horrendous event.\n\nCSNY recorded and released it within days of the shootings and the emotion is evident in their provocative performance.\n\n5\n\nHarvest Moon\n\nSimply stated, âHarvest Moonâ meshes imagery and intent in this abject expression of romance, stirred with both clarity and conviction.\n\nA tribute to his first wife, Pegi Young, and well served with backing vocals from Linda Ronstadt, itâs ethereal, inspiring and may in fact be one of the best ballads Youngâs ever written.\n\n4\n\nHeart of Gold\n\nYoungâs first and, to date, biggest solo hit, âHeart of Goldâ offers a tender tapestry of mood and melody, and while the lyrics seem somewhat mawkish at times, with it, Young became an easy listening icon.\n\nTaken from the album Harvest, Young soon became a bonafide superstar courtesy of a familiar folk finesse.\n\n3\n\nLong May You Run\n\nAn ode to his beloved 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse abandoned due to mechanical failure, âLong May You Runâ highlighted the ill-fated effort to reconvene with Stephen Stills.\n\nThe references to the Beach Boys and âCaroline Noâ are particularly poignant, tied into imagery that implies feelings for a lost lover.\n\n2\n\nThis Note's for You\n\nThe title track of his 16th album, it found Young recruiting a horn section for a stinging denunciation of commercialism and selling songs for jingles (âAinât singinâ for Pepsi / Ainât singinâ for Cokeâ).\n\nA daring new direction, it was soon abandoned in favor of more rollicking refrains. Still, it remains indicative of Youngâs ongoing defiance and determination.\n\n1\n\n---\n\nListen and subscribe to Holler's The Best Neil Young Songs playlist below:\n\nAmazon Music\n\nWritten by Lee Zimmerman"
