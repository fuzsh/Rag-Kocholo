        "text": "“Deja Vu’ is largely considered to be the band’s best album, but CSNY have been on record stating that it took a very long time to get the album finished and released. “Getting that second album out of us was like pulling teeth, there was song after song that didn’t make it,” Stephen Stills once said. “The track ‘Déjà Vu’ must have taken 100 takes in the studio. But ‘Carry On’ happened in a grand total of eight hours from conception to finished master. So you never know.”\n\nwhen listening to ‘Deja Vu’, though there aren’t many overt references to the ’70s hippie culture, the spirit of the era is felt throughout the record. The album covers a variety of topics, including love, heartbreak (Crosby’s girlfriend had died in a car accident around this time), and the ongoing culture war.\n\nListen to the title track ‘Deja Vu’ below"
