        "text": "The second studio album by Crosby, Stills and Nash, now with added Young. The album was recorded around the same time as their iconic Woodstock performance, a moment that was highlighted in the Jon Mitchell-penned track, ‘Woodstock.’ The recording was a tumultuous time for the band members; in the midst of it, Graham Nash and girlfriend, Joni Mitchell broke up, as did Stephen Stills and Judy Collins (of ‘Suite: Judy Blue Eyes’ fame). David Crosby’s girlfriend, Christine Hinton, was killed in a car accident, which led him down a dark path of severe drug use. Stephen Stills claims that the album was like pulling teeth. They had spent hours writing, recording and re-recording songs.\n\nThe result, however, is a masterpiece. Nash’s ‘Our House’ is one of the most enduring songs of the 20th Century, a song he had written about his home with Joni Mitchell. ‘Teach Your Children,’ another Nash song was a leftover from his days in The Hollies. Bearing a country feel, the song has been a mainstay on classic radio and TV advertising ever since. Crosby contributed the title track as well as ‘Almost Cut My Hair’ (spoiler, he didn’t), a psychedelic rock song with Neil Young’s iconic and distinctive guitar playing throughout. The song was a point of contention for the band as Stills was unhappy with Crosby’s vocal, flat out saying that it was a bad vocal. To be honest, it’s raw and filled with emotion. A grieving man bearing his soul on record. Young contributed ‘Helpless,’ one of his greatest songs and ‘Country Girl.’ For such an inharmonious trio, CSN have the best harmonies in music. Together, their vocals are a pure joy to listen to.\n\n#rs500albums"
