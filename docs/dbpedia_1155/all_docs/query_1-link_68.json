        "text": "I like the 1977 album too.\n\nMy favorite tracks on the first two CSN albums are 'Almost Cut my Hair' and 'Deja Vu,' so for me Crosby's If I Could Only Remember My Name is a must.\n\nIt's also the Pope's second favorite album.\n\nI guess neither of those technically count as 'Crosby Stills Nash and Young' albums.\n\nI also think the first solo album from Nash and the first two plus Manassas from Stills are good, but the best of that stuff is probably covered by the box set.\n\nStill, it couldn't hurt to pick those up either. I'd call them essential, and everyone knows about Neil Young.\n\nSilly question as CSN&Y only ever made 3 official studio albums and 2 live ones. So obviously just get them all. Now if they had 20 albums it would be a sensible question. But if you actually meant CSN albums (group & solo) then there can be a discussion which already appears in many other threads so no need for a new one. So if you did mean CSN group & solo. just get the first two solo albums by each member and you can't go wrong. Digging deeper, anything before the 80's will have just enough good songs to warrant owning IMHO after 1980 it goes downhill fast.\n\nIf yer a fan, I'd reckon they're all essential. Even the supposed \"bad\" albums -group or otherwise- have at least a song or two to recommend them.\n\nWhen in doubt, get the 1991 CSNY box set. It's not perfect, but it's a good start.\n\nbut the solo albums from 2000-present are great\n\nYeah you are quite right and I should have noted that though I really don't like Nash's latest at all.. some really non-melodic and badly written lyrics on most of the tracks with overall boring production too. Nash will never top his first two solo albums. In the last 20 years Crosby hasn't really put a foot wrong and Stills albums with the Rides and now the duet album with Judy Collins are truly superb. You could make a wonderfully essential CSN album out of all their latest solo albums. Shame the same couldn't be said of Mr. Young (bar the sublime \"Hitchhiker\")\n\nRe: the CSNY 1974 set, I lost interest when I heard that Nash had auto-tuned the vocals. For years we'd been hearing from all concerned (including Graham Nash) how this tour was a musical and financial disaster best forgotten. Then 40 years later they want to sell a live record, and suddenly Graham is saying it is supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nNot a huge fan of Crosby, Stills and Nash after their first album. The other albums have some good songs, but I prefer when Neil is in the band.\n\nCSN 1977 - Cathedral, Carried Away, Cold Rain, Dark Star and Anything At All are the great songs on this album. The box set has the rest of the okay songs..I would be buying this album just for the studio version of Dark Star.\n\nI've only heard this album once so the other songs might grow on me."
