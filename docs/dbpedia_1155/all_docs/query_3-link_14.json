        "text": "The musical partnership of David Crosby (born August 14, 1941), Stephen Stills (born January 3, 1945), and Graham Nash (born February 2, 1942), with and without Neil Young (born November 12, 1945), was not only one of the most successful touring and recording acts of the late ’60s, ’70s, and early ’80s — with the colorful, contrasting nature of the members’ characters and their connection to the political and cultural upheavals of the time — it was arguably the only American-based band to approach the overall societal impact of the Beatles. The group was a second marriage for all the participants when it came together in 1968: Crosby had been a member of the Byrds, Nash was in the Hollies, and Stills had been part of Buffalo Springfield. The resulting trio, however, sounded like none of its predecessors and was characterized by a unique vocal blend and a musical approach that ranged from acoustic folk to melodic pop to hard rock. CSN’s debut album, released in 1969, was perfectly in tune with the times, and the group was an instant hit. By the time of their first tour (which included the Woodstock festival), they had added Young, also a veteran of Buffalo Springfield, who maintained a solo career.\n\nThe first CSNY album, Déjà Vu, was a chart-topping hit in 1970, but the group split acrimoniously after a summer tour. 4 Way Street, a live double album issued after the breakup, was another number one hit. (When it was finally released on CD in 1992, it was lengthened with more live material.) In 1974, CSNY re-formed for a summer stadium tour without releasing a new record. Nevertheless, the compilation So Far became their third straight number one. Crosby, Stills & Nash re-formed without Young in 1977 for the album CSN, another giant hit. They followed with Daylight Again in 1982, but by then Crosby was in the throes of drug addiction and increasing legal problems. He was in jail in 1985-1986, but cleaned up and returned to action, with the result that CSNY reunited for only their second studio album, American Dream, in 1988. CSN followed with Live It Up in 1990, and though that album was a commercial disappointment, the trio remained a popular live act; it embarked on a 25th anniversary tour in the summer of 1994 and released a new album, After the Storm. The trio again reunited with Young for 1999’s Looking Forward, followed in 2000 by their CSNY2K tour.\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 album Déjà Vu will be reissued as a five-disc deluxe set May 14, 2021 on Rhino.\n\nThe album features legendary songs ‘Carry On’, ‘Teach Your Children’, ‘Helpless’ and ‘Our House’ that still resonate today. Rhino’s deluxe set is a 4CD+LP package that offers a “pristine version” of the original album on 180g vinyl and CD along with three further CDs packed with hours of rare and unreleased studio recordings that provide incredible insight into the making of the record.\n\nThis set includes 38 bonus tracks, delivering nearly two-and-a-half hours of music that includes demos, outtakes, and alternate takes – most of which (29 to be specific) are previously unreleased.This includes ‘Know You Got To Run’, the first song the quartet recorded during its first session on 15 July at the house Stills was renting from Peter Tork in Studio City. Other unreleased highlights include the demo for Crosby’s ‘Almost Cut My Hair’; Stills’ outtake for ‘Bluebird Revisited’; and Young’s alternate version of ‘Helpless’ featuring harmonica. Also included is a version of ‘Our House’ that features Nash singing with the song’s inspiration, Joni Mitchell.\n\nLike many of Rhino’s deluxe sets, this comes as a 12″ x 12″ hardcover book (with textured surface with gold foil stamp) with rare photos and sleeve notes by Cameron Crowe (through stories told by the people who were there, including David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young).\n\nREF: https://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/csny-deja-vu-50th-anniversary-deluxe/\n\nDéjà Vu 50th anniversary deluxe\n\nCD 1: Original Album\n\n1. “Carry On”\n\n2. “Teach Your Children”\n\n3. “Almost Cut My Hair”\n\n4. “Helpless”\n\n5. “Woodstock”\n\n6. “Déjà Vu”\n\n7. “Our House”\n\n8. “4 + 20”\n\n9. “Country Girl”\n\na. “Whiskey Boot Hill”\n\nb. “Down, Down, Down”\n\nc. “Country Girl” (I Think You’re Pretty)\n\n10. “Everybody I Love You”\n\nCD 2: Demos\n\n1. “Our House” – Graham Nash *\n\n2. “4 + 20” – Stephen Stills *\n\n3. “Song With No Words (Tree With No Leaves)” – David Crosby & Graham Nash\n\n4. “Birds” – Neil Young & Graham Nash *\n\n5. “So Begins The Task/Hold On Tight” – Stephen Stills *\n\n6. “Right Between The Eyes” – Graham Nash\n\n7. “Almost Cut My Hair” – David Crosby *\n\n8. “Teach Your Children” – Graham Nash & David Crosby\n\n9. “How Have You Been” – Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\n10. “Triad” – David Crosby\n\n11. “Horses Through A Rainstorm” – Graham Nash\n\n12. “Know You Got To Run” – Stephen Stills *\n\n13. “Question Why” – Graham Nash *\n\n14. “Laughing” – David Crosby *\n\n15. “She Can’t Handle It” – Stephen Stills *\n\n16. “Sleep Song” – Graham Nash\n\n17. “Déjà Vu” – David Crosby & Graham Nash *\n\n18. “Our House” – Graham Nash & Joni Mitchell *\n\nCD 3: Outtakes\n\n1. “Everyday We Live” *\n\n2. “The Lee Shore” – 1969 Vocal *\n\n3. “I’ll Be There” *\n\n4. “Bluebird Revisited” *\n\n5. “Horses Through A Rainstorm”\n\n6. “30 Dollar Fine” *\n\n7. “Ivory Tower” *\n\n8. “Same Old Song” *\n\n9. “Hold On Tight/Change Partners” *\n\n10. “Laughing” *\n\n11. “Right On Rock ’n’ Roll” *\n\nCD 4: Alternates\n\n1. “Carry On” – Early Alternate Mix *\n\n2. “Teach Your Children” – Early Version *\n\n3. “Almost Cut My Hair” – Early Version *\n\n4. “Helpless” – Harmonica Version\n\n5. “Woodstock” – Alternate Vocals *\n\n6. “Déjà Vu” – Early Alternate Mix *\n\n7. “Our House” – Early Version *\n\n8. “4 + 20” – Alternate Take 2 *\n\n9. “Know You Got To Run” *\n\nVinyl LP: Original Album\n\nSide One\n\n1.“Carry On”\n\n2. “Teach Your Children”\n\n3. “Almost Cut My Hair”\n\n4. “Helpless”\n\n5. “Woodstock”\n\nSide Two\n\n1. “Déjà Vu”\n\n2. “Our House”\n\n3. “4 + 20”\n\n4. “Country Girl”\n\na. “Whiskey Boot Hill”\n\nb. “Down, Down, Down”\n\nc. “Country Girl” (I Think You’re Pretty)\n\n5. “Everybody I Love You”\n\n* previously unissued"
