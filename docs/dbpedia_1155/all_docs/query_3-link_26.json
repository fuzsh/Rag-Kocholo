        "text": "The day that Déjà Vu reached the top of the US album charts, on 13 May 1970, the band split up. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young had just launched their spring tour – already postponed for a month after Stephen Stills had steered his Mercedes into the rear of a parked car. The Denver show was a disaster, sabotaged by CSNY’s decision to axe their bassist during the final rehearsals. Neil Young fled the stage in disgust before the night was over and, the following day, after an equally shambolic rehearsal ended in fisticuffs, everything fell apart. Not for the first or, indeed, last time, a band lauded for their skin-tight vocal harmonies had revealed their natural tendency to fall out of tune with each other.\n\nYet the album kept selling and, within a month, CSNY were back on the road, with a fresh rhythm section and a new hit single, Ohio, which became a timeless anthem of dissent against presidential madness. As the opening cut of their chart-topping record predicted, the band had learnt how to Carry On. Bono declared years later, “Carry On has got to be the loudest, widest, fullest, most uplifting moment ever with just acoustic guitar and voices.” Sting revealed that, “I learned harmony listening to Déjà Vu until I wore out the grooves.” One American reviewer gushed that it was “the most beautiful record ever produced”. But in keeping with their multiple decades of internal dissension, the first studio album\n\nby Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young was the result of several months of personal and professional anguish.\n\nCSNY was never intended to be a quartet – or, indeed, as the sleeve of Déjà Vu listed them, a six-piece band with bassist and drummer (Greg Reeves and Dallas Taylor) credited in supporting roles. Before CSNY, there was CSN – and that wasn’t supposed to be a trio. The individuals who made up Crosby, Stills & Nash eschewed an extravagant collective title to emphasise the fact that they weren’t a group; merely an assembly of defiantly individual talents who happened to have made a record together. Crosby, Stills & Nash (the 1969 album) was intended as a one-off experiment in transcending the petty squabbles of group politics and contractual obligations. What none of its participants had imagined was\n\nthat their names would now be linked together for eternity.\n\nAnyone who has spent time with CSN, as I have on many occasions, soon realises that these are no shrinking violets or innate diplomats. Even Graham Nash, by far the most peaceable member of the band, is a force of nature. As his friend and occasional songwriting partner Terry Reid explained, “Graham is a tough cookie. When he believes in something, there ain’t no shifting him.” With The Hollies, Manchester’s answer to The Beatles, Nash rapidly emerged as group spokesman, despite the fact that he wasn’t the frontman. Allan Clarke, Nash’s friend since they were in short trousers, and the group’s lead singer, recalled that it was around 1967 that “things became a bit difficult, because Graham decided he was in charge of us. It was a strange period. He began to be quite different from us in his writing.”\n\nMore importantly, Nash was following a different philosophy from his pub-loving Mancunian mates. In California, he had discovered Mama Cass Elliot and acid in rapid succession. Cass introduced him to another psychedelic explorer and natural-born rebel: David Crosby.\n\nThe 1967 line-up of The Byrds was in a constant state of upheaval, fuelled by Crosby’s ego. “He was very difficult,” frontman Roger McGuinn remembered.\n\n“He didn’t like doing anything at that point.” Bassist Chris Hillman concurred: “I used to get so angry with David. But we were young, and made all the mistakes that everybody else made.” As the year progressed, McGuinn and Hillman decided that Crosby must be axed. The exiled ex-Byrd bathed his wounds in Florida, purchasing a schooner and stumbling upon a young songwriter named Joni Mitchell. The two began a short-lived and inevitably tempestuous relationship, from which came her debut, Song To A Seagull, and Mitchell’s lifelong connection with the CSNY family.\n\nCrosby and Nash had sealed their friendship for the next 50 years with a Thames-side acid trip in early 1967. The other half of CSNY was equally close. Stephen Stills, a fiery Southerner with the ability to master any instrument, and the composing chops to match, was Buffalo Springfield’s self-appointed leader. But his supremacy was under constant challenge from his Canadian friend, Neil Young,\n\na remarkable songwriter with a penchant for passive-aggressive sabotage. If there was a key TV spot or festival on the horizon, Young could be relied upon to withdraw at the least opportune moment, leaving the floundering Stills to carry the band’s rickety skeleton on his own back. But Stills also regarded Young as his closest friend and most inspiring creative foil, ensuring that he was constantly drawn back to the flame that would leave lifelong scars.\n\nWhen the Springfield finally disintegrated in spring 1968, Stills killed time with songwriting and session work. A brief collaboration with Al Kooper resulted – to everyone’s surprise – in a Top 10 album, Super Session, and Stills’ name suddenly carried commercial power. As that record climbed the charts, Stills, Nash and Crosby performed their fabled impromptu display of three-part harmony in Joni Mitchell’s Laurel Canyon home. “This stuff coming out of the three of us was quite something,” Nash told me. “I’m a harmony freak, and I’d never heard anything like it. We sang that one verse and then started laughing hysterically. We couldn’t believe what we’d found.” They demonstrated the blend to friends and peers, and applied it to a growing reservoir of songs, from which they selected the contents of the Crosby, Stills & Nash LP they recorded in the early weeks of 1969.\n\nBy then, Nash had made the fateful decision to abandon The Hollies, his homeland, and his wife, in favour of this loose association of songwriters, California and a burgeoning romance with Crosby’s ex, Joni Mitchell. But some home attractions could not be duplicated: as he recalled, “I would go down to the Continental Shop on Wilshire Boulevard and get my fix – HP Sauce and baked beans!”\n\nNot everyone on the contemporary music scene was delirious about CSN’s decision to apply their trademark harmonies to almost every song. Art Garfunkel appreciated their talent, but questioned its application, as he told me later. “Three-part harmony really turns a melody into a wall. It’s like an artist who wants to dip his brush into his ink, and then uses a fork instead of his brush-point. What kind of painting can you do with a fork?” But his was a rare voice of dissent. The cult of CSN entranced the Los Angeles music business, prompting a bidding war for their wares. By May 1969, their self-titled debut was in the shops. FM rock stations honed in on Crosby’s righteous political rant, Long Time Gone, but it was a Nash tune that caught the ear of pop programmers, and duly became a single. His old friend Allan Clarke recognised the irony: “Graham told us that he didn’t want to do pop anymore. So, he went off to join CSN, and their first hit was Marrakesh Express – which was very definitely a pop song.” That undermined sales of the CSN album in the nascent British rock market, as it suggested that this new trio was no hipper than The Hollies had been. But in the US, the single showed up on Top 40 playlists and even in the easy listening chart; while the album outsold everything else on college campuses that summer, and reached across the divide into the list of Best-Selling Soul Albums.\n\nFor all CSN’s insistence that they were a moment in time rather than a permanent band, their record company, managers and audience demanded a tour. Crosby and Nash wanted to carry their acoustic vibe from the Canyon into concert venues, but Stills was insistent that he also needed to play electric music. It was easy to conceptualise a set-list: all-acoustic (“wooden music”, as Crosby dubbed it) for openers, in varying combinations of personnel, followed by raucous rock’n’roll. They already had a drummer, in the shape of Dallas Taylor, but Stills could not be expected to replicate his multi-instrumental studio prowess. He made tame overtures towards Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood, but the pair were about to launch their own supergroup, Blind Faith. Eventually, Atlantic boss Ahmet Ertegun suggested that Stills should reconsider his partnership with Neil Young. Still bearing the scars of Young’s unreliability, Stills initially rejected the idea, but eventually gave way. An even more prominent roadblock came into view: neither Crosby nor Nash wanted to jeopardise the delicate three-way relationship of CSN. Only when Young appeared in person to charm them with his songs and his wry humour did the two dissenters back down. “It seems as if we’re going to be Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young,” Stills announced with an air of trepidation.\n\nBy the time CSN became CSNY, Neil Young had released two albums of his own: an eponymous debut, and his first collaboration with Crazy Horse, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The Horse bassist, Billy Talbot, recalled that “Stephen and Dallas Taylor used to follow us round the clubs, and they’d sit in. We knew they wanted Neil. Neil told us about it when we were in LA, and we just said, ‘Go for it.’”\n\nAs club audiences had already discovered, the combination of Neil Young & Crazy Horse was staggering, compelling, electrifying. But that didn’t translate into record sales. Young’s two LPs made minimal commercial impact in the US – and even less in Britain, where they were released simultaneously after he joined CSNY. Hard though it would soon become to believe, Young was merely a cult attraction in the summer of 1969, and he was aware from the start that hitching a ride with the West Coast’s hottest new rock act could only benefit his own career. Observers still debate exactly how calculating Young was about his potential change of fortune, but even before the quartet appeared onstage, the Canadian was confessing that he expected his association with CSN to provide overdue commercial impetus to his solo work. Not that Stills questioned Young’s motives: he was revelling in a brief idyll of artistic unity, while announcing proudly that, “Neil is just about my best friend in the world”.\n\nThere was a minor hiccup at the beginning, when ex-Springfield bassist Bruce Palmer was added to the CSNY line-up, before being jettisoned rudely when his personal habits affected his time-keeping, musical and otherwise. In his place, the band recruited a teenager from the Motown stable, Greg Reeves.\n\nThe six-man band rehearsed at Stills’ house in Laurel Canyon, where the sound of electric guitars sliced through the air and crippled any attempt to sing in tune. Straining to be heard above the amplifiers, Crosby and Nash lost their voices – the Englishman suffering so badly that surgeons threatened to put him under the knife. Only on the day of their first show, in Chicago, did Nash dare to risk his tonsils; only onstage did CSNY discover that they had a sound, and an audience ready to treat them like musical saviours.\n\nTheir next stop was Woodstock, and immortality. Rolling Stone pronounced them the hit of the festival and, after they recorded Joni Mitchell’s song about Yasgur’s farm, they would be tied to the “Woodstock Nation” forever. So far, Young had occupied the shadows onstage, but when they embarked on a week-long run at LA’s Greek Theatre, CSNY’s repertoire expanded to include a song from his second album: Down By The River. It quickly developed into a fierce exchange of guitar licks between Stills and Young, climaxing in an almost erotic union of noise. As Stills told me, “In Buffalo Springfield… after each of us has gone nuts, one of us would pick up a little phrase we learned from Jimmy Reed, or Chuck Berry, or Keith Richards – the masters, in other words – and the other guy plays exactly the same thing.” Critics harked back to the pair’s tempestuous relationship, and assumed that they were watching a battle for supremacy. But Stills denied it all: “It was never a war, or even that sense of competition, that everybody made it out to be. I’d appreciate it if people could finally believe that!”\n\nIt was Down By The River, cut down from its customary 15 or 20 minutes to a more viable four, that introduced CSNY to American TV viewers, via the first episode of a new series entitled The Music Scene. Their cameo was explosive and majestic, and spotlighted the band’s new recruit – a gesture of generosity that boosted Young’s power within the band.\n\nNone of that was immediately obvious when CSNY emerged as unbilled headliners at the Big Sur Folk Festival (as captured in the movie, Celebration At Big Sur) or on another ill-fated TV venture, which found them duetting with Tom Jones. During a hilarious Long Time Gone, Jones and Stills jousted\n\nlike rutting stags as they showed off their R&B credentials, Crosby and Nash barely able to suppress giggles alongside them.\n\nAll of this was intended as advance publicity for the first CSNY album – which didn’t yet exist. Even before Young’s arrival, Atlantic had been trumpeting the imminent release of a second CSN LP, plus an entire set of solo records from the trio, all scheduled to reach the shops before Christmas 1969. The extended band had begun recording during Palmer’s brief involvement, but their focus was clearly on building a live set rather than constructing an album: hence, the reworking of CSN’s Helplessly Hoping, and a vain attempt to better Young’s solo rendition of Cinnamon Girl.\n\nPalmer was still occupying the bassist role when CSNY cut a Terry Reid song variously known as Man With No Expression and Horses Through A Rainstorm. Nash had already attempted the tune with The Hollies in 1968, and now assured Reid that it would be included on CSNY’s record. “Can you imagine the shock of hearing them doing that?” Reid asked. “In four-part harmony?\n\nI was going, ‘Perhaps there is a God!’ But then I discovered that Stephen never wanted to do it, and it got shelved.”\n\nIn Stills’ mind, CSNY was as much his band as CSN had been. He continued to reshape his colleagues’ songs, turning Nash’s turgid demo of Teach Your Children into a jaunty country tune, and adding some Caribbean breeze to Crosby’s The Lee Shore. He was also unafraid to use CSNY as a vehicle for his own devices, searching for gold in the fragments of tunes like Whole People and I’ll Be There. But CSNY rarely attempted anything that reflected the ferocious energy they would discover onstage. Even Young, who would conjure fire out of his old Springfield foil in front of an audience, seemed to mistrust the band’s ability to match Crazy Horse in the studio. The initial songs he offered them – Sea Of Madness, Everybody’s Alone – were poppier than anything he’d conceived since the first Buffalo Springfield album.\n\nCrosby had already abandoned Los Angeles for the more bohemian atmosphere of Northern California, where he set up camp near the Grateful Dead. In mid-September 1969, he tried out Wally Heider’s new studio in San Francisco, laying down demos of songs he would still be recording almost a decade later. But before he could bring them to the band his girlfriend, Christine Hinton, was killed in an accident while taking Crosby’s cats to the vet. “I had no way to deal with it,” he recalled. “I had no emotional equipment. So, I stuffed it away, and I took painkillers – heroin and cocaine – and pretended that it didn’t happen.” CSNY’s immediate live shows were cancelled, and Nash accompanied Crosby to England, keeping close eye on his friend in case he attempted suicide.\n\nOn their return, CSNY’s studio obligations became inescapable. Crosby attempted to concentrate on the music, but was prone to dissolving into tears mid-take. Young took the temperature of the room, and decided to maintain a low profile.\n\n“I was surprised that Neil wasn’t around as much as we were,” Nash admitted, but CSN became used to the fact that Young would only attend when his presence was absolutely necessary. That left Stills’ creative leadership unchallenged, especially when his burgeoning cocaine habit – shared with drummer Dallas Taylor – ensured that he would indulge in marathon recording sessions. “I’d get up at five in the afternoon, have breakfast, go to the studios and stay there until noon the next day and then go home and collapse,” Stills confessed. “That went on for three weeks.” If anything, he was under-estimating his chemical-induced stamina, as sessions would sometimes stretch round the clock for 48 hours or more. “There was so much cocaine around,” Taylor remembered, “and Stephen and I would just eat up anything that was there. It was crazy.” Nash attempted to keep pace, but common sense drove him to bed, while Stills worked on. “None of us has ever really been willing to let any of the others be a leader,” Crosby once insisted to me. “We all have large egos, and we all feel strongly about the music.” But sheer persistence outweighed the ideals of democracy, which were under even more strain when recording turned to mixing. While Young carefully extracted the tapes of his two contributions to the finished album, so that he could create his own soundscapes, the rest was left to a war of nerves between Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nAfter days passed with each of the three men trying to boost his own voice in the mix, and at least two of the trio crying with frustration, somehow a CSNY album emerged out of the chaos.\n\nStills would later claim that Déjà Vu had taken 800 hours to record, which was wildly exaggerated. But the sessions had certainly exuded none of the exhilaration that CSN had enjoyed earlier in the year. Cocaine only created artificial highs, and it couldn’t disguise Crosby’s grief, Nash’s fear that his romance with Mitchell was decaying, Stills’ continued longing for Judy Collins and Young’s early misgivings about his marriage. In place of the irrepressible joy of the CSN album, CSNY’s project was a triumph of craftsmanship and compromise. That it still sounded so fresh was testament to four songwriters at their peak, and the CSN harmony blend which had not yet been ravaged by the symptoms of excess.\n\nWhen the sessions ended, the band’s management were predicting that they would fill a double-album. Atlantic bragged that the LP – then self-titled, like CSN’s debut – would be on sale by November. Neither boast came true. A 2LP set might have been possible with more input from Young, but he was already at work on his next solo project, which took precedence in his mind. Crosby was awash with material, but much of it was too experimental for the tastes of Stills or Young. Meanwhile, Stills refused to sign off on a final mix, convinced that he alone could conjure up another layer of magic from the tapes.\n\nWhat nobody knew was whether Crosby was strong enough to face an audience. He ducked out of a late October Dead/Airplane bill in San Francisco, leaving Stills and Nash to perform as a duo. (Typically, Young wasn’t even in town.) Stills struck up such a rapport with the Dead that he returned to jam with them, and promised to produce their next record. It was only in mid-November, in Santa Barbara, that Crosby returned to the stage, at the start of a pre-Christmas run of shows that were both triumphant and testing. Ecstasy came in Honolulu, where they were joined onstage by John Sebastian; Denver, where Down By The River stretched for 25 minutes; and Houston, where Nash premiered Our House.\n\nSeveral songs from the sessions were now on open display, months before the release of their album. Woodstock established itself as a show-stopper; Teach Your Children garnered immediate audience approval; likewise, Helpless; but after one agonised performance in Dallas, Crosby abandoned Almost Cut My Hair, as the song reminded him only of Christine Hinton.\n\nOther stops on the tour were more challenging: Altamont, for example, where CSNY cut short their set, fled for their helicopter, and then ensured that no trace of them remained in Gimme Shelter, the movie of the Stones’ free-concert fiasco. Less traumatic, but equally trying, was a show in a San Diego stadium near an airport, where ambient noise and physical distance from the crowd left the band vowing never to play outdoors again.\n\nBy then, Joni Mitchell had quit the road herself, pleading exhaustion and creative bankruptcy. But she accompanied CSNY to Europe after Christmas, where they attended a New Year’s party at Ringo Starr’s house, and then played their first show outside North America, at London’s Royal Albert Hall. Their audience was delighted, but reviewers complained that they were pretentious, over-indulgent and dull. “There was all this bad tension,” Stills said of the show, “and we just couldn’t make it go away.” It didn’t help that most of his British rock heroes were in the house. “I felt terrible,” he confessed, “like an insect being dissected under a microscope.”\n\nAfter two more European shows, the band flew home – except Stills. Aware every time he took the stage that Crosby and Nash were now closer to Young than him, embarrassed by the London gig, and afraid that he might never regain his unchallenged supremacy within the band, he stayed behind in England. In his absence, Crosby and Nash approved the final mix of Déjà Vu, and then set out on an epic voyage on Crosby’s yacht – during which Mitchell appeared briefly on board, and her relationship with Nash disintegrated. Meanwhile, Young cut a new solo record, After The Gold Rush, and began to imagine how he might escape from his marriage.\n\nIn London, Stills resumed his friendship with Starr, and was invited to join a series"
