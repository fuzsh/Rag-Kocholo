        "text": "1959: Chubby Checker debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 with “The Class,” in which he does imitations of Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, the Coasters, Cozy Cole, and the Chipmunks. Born Ernest Evans, he adopted the stage name Chubby Checker after his boss at the Produce Market and Cameo Parkway Records songwriter Kal Mann arranged for Evans to do a private recording for American Bandstand host Dick Clark. At the session, Evans performed an impression of Fats Domino and explained to Clark’s wife that his friends called him “Chubby,” to which she suggested “Chubby Checker” as a play on Fats Domino.\n\n1960: “I’m Sorry” by 15-year-old Brenda Lee was released. Though it was the flip side of “That’s All You Gotta Do,” “I’m Sorry” became the bigger chart success, reaching #1 on the US pop charts and #4 on the Billboard R&B chart. The song also became a standard of the country genre. When the single issued in the UK, “I’m Sorry” was made the A-side.\n\n1961: “Cupid” by Sam Cooke was released. It reached #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #20 on the R&B chart, but the single performed best in the UK, where it peaked at #7.
