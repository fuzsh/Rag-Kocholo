        "text": "Crosby Stills Nash & Young had a huge hit with their album Deja Vu in 1970. They split to do solo albums, and didn’t get back together (except to tour) until a CSN reunion in 1977. But what if they had continued making group albums after Deja Vu? By combining their talents and best songs, the band’s albums would have been even more popular than their solo efforts, and their songs more widely known. CSN&Y’s place as one of the greatest rock bands would be completely solidified.\n\nAs fans know, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young didn’t always release songs in the order they were written and recorded. Neil Young recently released some great recordings he made 45 years ago! So, at a pace of one album per year (and using some chronological flexibility), here are CSN&Y fantasy albums. Those of you familiar with the songs will be aware of the effort to place them in an order for musical flow and often with lyrical associations. A few of the recordings are included (the audio is right on this site).\n\n1971…After The Gold Rush\n\nNeil Young’s title fit perfectly after the group’s initial rush of popularity, so it’s the title of CSN&Y’s follow-up album. Here are the songs.\n\nSide One:\n\nLove The One You’re With (Stills)\n\nTell Me Why (Young)\n\nLaughing (Crosby)\n\nOhio (CSNY)\n\nFind The Cost Of Freedom (CSNY)\n\nChicago (Nash)\n\nSide Two:\n\nSugar Babe (Stills)\n\nOnly Love Can Break Your Heart (Young)\n\nSimple Man (Nash)\n\nSouthern Man (Young)\n\nDo For The Others (Stills)\n\nAfter The Gold Rush (Young)\n\nThis album would have been a worthy next album for CSN&Y. The album starts with “Love The One You’re With”, which has all three of CSN on it. Since the band was now providing new albums to their record company, there would have been no need for the So Far hits collection. “Ohio” and “Find The Cost Of Freedom” would have been on this album. Most of the other songs are from the first solo albums by the group members. In the early 70s both Stills and Young were very prolific songwriters, so they have a strong showing throughout these six albums. Here’s Stephen Stills’ “Do For The Others”:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/02-Do-for-the-Others.m4a\n\n1972…Change Partners\n\nSide One:\n\nChange Partners (Stills)\n\nDon’t Let It Bring You Down (Young)\n\nTraction In The Rain (Crosby)\n\nNothing To Do But Today (Stills)\n\nOut On The Weekend (Young)\n\nSleep Song (Nash)\n\nSide two:\n\nDon’t Look At My Shadow (Stills)\n\nAlabama (Young)\n\nI Used To Be A King (Nash)\n\nThe Lee Shore (CSNY)\n\nKnow You Got To Run (Stills)\n\nBirds (It’s Over) [Young & Nash]\n\nThis album mostly has songs from the first and second solo albums the artists recorded after Deja Vu. It would have kept the momentum going for this super group. The song “Change Partners” has all of CSN on it. Graham Nash says it’s CSN&Y’s theme song, since they were always changing alliances within the group. There’s a cool stripped-down version of “Birds” that’s included with the Deja Vu box set. The song has Graham Nash harmonizing with Neil Young. It would be a good closer for this album, with the song’s last words being…”It’s over”. Here it is:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/04-Birds-Its-Over-Neil_Graham-Remix.mp3\n\n1973…Heart Of Gold\n\nSide One:\n\nIt Doesn’t Matter (Stills)\n\nHeart Of Gold (Young)\n\nImmigration Man (Crosby & Nash)\n\nThe Wall Song (Crosby & Nash)\n\nThe Needle & The Damage Done (Young)\n\nBlues Man (Stills)\n\nSide Two:\n\nSo Begins The Task (Stills)\n\nHarvest (Young)\n\nRight Now (Stills)\n\nGames (Crosby & Nash)\n\nSouthbound Train (Crosby & Nash)\n\nJourney Through The Past (Young)\n\nHeart Of Gold is named for the #1 hit, and it would have been an amazingly popular album with this killer collection of songs. They’re some of the very best cuts from three solo albums that all made the top five on Billboard’s album chart. “Journey Through The Past” is the studio version from the Harvest sessions. It was on Neil Young Archives I. This album almost certainly would have had multiple weeks at #1. Here”s that version of “Journey Through The Past”:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/120-Journey-Through-the-Past-Harvest-Version.m4a\n\n1974…The Bridge (Cover photo by Jeannette Bausch)\n\nSide One:\n\nJohnny’s Garden (Stills)\n\nOld Man (Young)\n\nPage 43 (Crosby & Nash)\n\nDo You Remember The Americans (Stills)\n\nPrison Song (Nash, CSNY version)\n\nThe Bridge (Young)\n\nSide Two:\n\nSong Of Love (Stills)\n\nLove Is A Rose (Young)\n\nWhere Will I Be (Crosby & Nash)\n\nColorado (Stills)\n\nAnother Sleep Song (Nash)\n\nA Man Needs A Maid (Young)\n\nThe Bridge completes the use of songs from the Manassas and Harvest albums. Some of the tracks that make this strong are “Johnny’s Garden”, “Old Man”, “Prison Song”, and “Love Is A Rose”, but they’re all good. “The Bridge” is the studio version (minus the studio chatter) from Neil Young Archives II. Here it is:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/01-The-Bridge-11_15_72.mp3\n\n1975…Down The Road\n\nSide One:\n\nWalk On (Young)\n\nDown The Road (Stills)\n\nHomeward Through The Haze (CSNY)\n\nSee The Sky About To Rain (Young)\n\nShuffle Just As Bad (Stills)\n\nAnd So It Goes (Crosby Nash & Young)\n\nSide Two:\n\nLove/Art Blues (CSNY)\n\nAs I Come Of Age (CSN)\n\nTonight’s The Night (Young)\n\nWitching Hour (Stills)\n\nThrough My Sails (CSNY)\n\nCritical Mass/Wind On The Water (Crosby & Nash)\n\n“Love/Art Blues” sounds almost studio-quality on their CSNY 1974 live album, and could have been used for this album. Here’s the song:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Love_Art-Blues-w_CSN-Studio-Mix-4_15_76.m4a\n\n“Witching Hour” is a song Stills did in the early 70s with Manassas. It was released decades later on the Pieces album. Down The Road is a really good collection, with five songs that were intended for the Human Highway album.\n\n(This photo was going to be the Human Highway cover.)\n\n1976…Human Highway\n\nSide One:\n\nSee The Changes…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (CSN Box Set)\n\nHuman Highway…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (Archives II)\n\nTaken At All…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (CSN Box Set)\n\nLong May You Run…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (Decade)\n\nStateline Blues…Stephen Stills (Illegal Stills)\n\nOut Of The Darkness…Crosby & Nash (Whistling Down The Wire)\n\nSide Two:\n\nTreetop Flyer…Stephen Stills (1976 CSNY sessions)\n\nTime After Time…Crosby & Nash (Whistling Down The Wire)\n\nMidnight On The Bay…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (Archives II)\n\nBlack Coral…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (Stills Box Set)\n\nLittle Blind Fish…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (1976 CSNY sessions)\n\nHawaiian Sunrise…Crosby Stills Nash & Young (CSNY 1974)\n\nHuman Highway was the “lost” album that was supposed to be the follow-up to Deja Vu. This version only uses songs still available to them in 1976. Other songs originally meant for Human Highway were used on earlier albums. Still’s “Treetop Flyer” and Crosby’s “Little Blind Fish” were recorded during the 1976 sessions for this album, and probably would have been finalized. Here’s what “Treetop Flyer” sounded like in 1976 (live):\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/05-Treetop-Flyer-1976-live.m4a\n\nCSN got back together for real in 1977. Their CSN album was solid, and only included one song, that was originally recorded for Human Highway, “See The Changes”, but it’s a different version.\n\nFor the complete Human Highway article (now with audio), here’s the link:\n\nhttps://ontherecords.net/2018/06/csny-human-highway-the-lost-album/\n\nThis “What if” article is for pretty hardcore Crosby Stills Nash & Young fans. Hope you enjoyed it, and maybe you’ll try these playlists, or make your own CSN&Y fantasy albums. Mixing the artists and songs this way creates a refreshing musical variety that’s impossible on solo albums."
