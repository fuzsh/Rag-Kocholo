It's not just where and how the set piece takes place, but also injecting stakes into each of them so we understand what we're rooting for and why. Here are some points to consider: 🔶 Ask yourself: What are the characters trying to achieve? What are the consequences of failure? Establishing high stakes keeps the audience invested. 🔶 Try to build anticipation through clever pacing, dialogue, and visuals. 🔶 Whether it's a mind-blowing stunt or a dazzling display of CGI, a set piece should be visually engaging. 🔶 Ensure the set piece reveals something new about your characters or propels them forward in the story.

Allow me to pull back the curtain on the making of “Warda,” my 2021 short film. Brace yourselves: this entire thing was executed with a total of zero dollars. Yes, you read that correctly—not a single cent. It was made during the covid lockdown, my budget was nonexistent, and I didn't have any funding. Now, if you’re curious about what a film conjured from thin air looks like, prepare for an interesting journey. While it has its quirks and imperfections, it remains an intriguing endeavor. Imagine yourself stranded on a desert island, armed with nothing but a rusty spoon and a dash of imagination. That’s the spirit! 🌴🎥 Here’s the crux of the matter: don’t lose sleep over the visuals. Seriously, they’ll fall into place. Instead, channel your inner storyteller. A robust, captivating narrative can carry you through choppy waters. And if, by chance, the final product appears slightly offbeat—fear not. It’s the heart of the story that truly matters AND it won't be your last piece of work anyway. So, my fellow cinematic adventurers, delve into the details of my film. You might just stumble upon your own buried chest of creativity. Enjoy! #filmmaking #storytelling #artdirection #animation #3Dmodeling #3dsmax #rigging #storyboard #story\n\nMetro - Teaser Short Film 🎬 Hello everyone! Here you can see the teaser of the short film Metro in which I participated. We made it as a TFM in the animation master of the UPV. The team is composed by Ferran \"Corati\" Calle, Andrea Gañan, Luis E. Zerpa Rojas, César Díaz and me (Carles Martí). It is worth mentioning the help we have received from Pablo Sorribes, Sergi Alberca, Iraide Antruejo, Sergi Vives, Malva Malmgren, Ignacio Meneu, Sergio Rodríguez and a large number of graffiti artists whose names you can see in the credits of the short film. The logline is as follows: After missing the last subway of the night, a girl is forced to board a strange and sinister graffitied carriage, where she is trapped with a horrible monster. It was a very enriching experience to work on this project, as it allowed us to learn the whole process of making a 3D animated short film. We dedicated the first year of our master's degree to pre-production and the following two years to production. In the pre-production stage we were in charge of script development, thumbnails, storyboarding, reference research and concept development. In the production stage, although we all collaborated on the various aspects of the short film, each of us focused on a specific role, just as one usually works in a studio. My main responsibility included modeling, lighting and rendering. Working on this project made us realize the importance of teamwork. It is an honor to note that METRO received a special mention at Animac in the 2024 edition. The full short film will be released in a few months, as it is currently being presented at various animation festivals.
