        "text": "Yesterday's #Spring #Budget brought some relief in that the Household Support Fund has been extended for a further 6 months, and we hope to apply for some support. A third of people accessing our service are children under 16 years old. The number of meals we are providing month in and month out has exceeded 30,000. Our Advice Service is supporting nearly 200 people each week. We need long-term solutions so the number of people we see each week drops. Ideally, we really would love it if The Welcome Centre, food bank and more were no longer needed. But until then, we will need your support. Could you choose us as your #charity of the year? Host a #fundraiser? Could you spare the cost of a coffee ‚òï each month, we can turn that into food on people's plates.üçΩÔ∏è If you can't spare a couple of quid each month, could you share this post with a couple of people instead? üì≤üì£ https://lnkd.in/eCG9J362 #HSF #donate #foodbank #Huddersfield #community #support #csr #fundingcuts #poverty #coty You can read more about the spring budget here on THE BIG ISSUE COMPANY LIMITED https://lnkd.in/e7TQfgqs\n\n#WOTW James Miller and many FRU volunteers are offered pupillage and Jamie's client rightly sings his praises for securing a ¬£16k judgment! This is exactly what we're here for, but don't take for granted that we'll always be here. It costs ¬£500k every year just to stand still and we get no public funding. To support us please go to https://lnkd.in/eGz6Kd_x #FreeLegalAdvice #Charity #EmploymentLaw\n\nDon't let the CRA inherit more than its fair share of your estate. By working together and structuring your estate plan wisely, we can minimize the amount of taxes you owe and maximize the amount of assets you can transfer to your beneficiaries. Plan ahead and protect your legacy for the people and causes that matter most to you. #estateplanning #taxplanning #charity #legacyplanning"
