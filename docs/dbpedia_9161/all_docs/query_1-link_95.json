        "text": "When Mike Leigh has anything to do with a party, it tends to be dangerous: everything, in his films, starts to unravel. But at this get-together of women who regularly act in them, all is well. They are opening the champagne, getting ready to smile for the camera, and someone – I think it is Alison Steadman – shouts: \"To Mike!\". Everyone – Imelda Staunton, Ruth Sheen, Lesley Manville, Marion Bailey, Karina Fernandez – lifts their glasses. There is much laughter and noisy conversation. I know how many of his regulars regret not being here because I have been talking to some of them – Brenda Blethyn, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Sally Hawkins – in Northampton, Los Angeles and New York. I know, too – because she is remembered so often – how everyone wishes Katrin Cartlidge, who died eight years ago at 41, were alive and able to join in.\n\nThe Mike Leigh marathon has been going on for weeks: I have been considering his women. Several box sets later (he has made more than 30 films), an extraordinary side-effect has taken hold. It comes and goes but I keep feeling I am in a Mike Leigh film. The backs of houses in a city street, non sequiturs in family conversation, overheard moments galore. That is a Mike Leigh moment… so is that. It is not the first sign of madness. It is the best compliment I can pay a man who has transformed the way we see – and hear – everyday life. But it is easier to feel one might be a Mike Leigh woman than to generalise about any of them. What Leigh has, in common with Pinter, is a genius for dramatising ordinary people. Unlike Pinter, he is never sinister nor stylised. Pinter enjoys enigma, Leigh is about transparency. You can see right through his characters, you know more about them than they do about themselves. And his films have a good heart. Alongside misery, there is always human kindness. And – tiny but telling detail – his women are forever putting the kettle on (as in life) when the troubles of the day are over or, more often, just as they are getting under way.\n\nAnother Year, Leigh's latest, is about to go on general release. It is a beautiful, meditative piece about love, growing older and loneliness, divided into four seasons. The cinematic light changes as the year wanes and the story darkens. It is audacious in its grasp of married happiness: the image of Sheen's contented therapist, Gerri (mug in hand), and Jim Broadbent (Tom) in their allotment will stay with me for a long time. But so will Manville's lonely portrait of a woman unable to live that ordinary dream. The film is sustaining or harrowing, depending upon which woman one thinks about.\n\nLiving the role\n\nLeigh is said to keep mum about his working methods. But the actors are more forthcoming: improvisations, they explain, take months. Each character's history begins in one-to-one discussions (like therapy) with the director. There is, according to Manville, a \"huge amount of interrogation\". The words \"epic\" and \"organic\" keep coming up – and several of the women describe the process as like creating a novel. Each actor initially knows nothing about what other characters are up to, or rather, as Blethyn explains: \"Everything is on a need-to-know basis … Leigh says he has nothing at the back of his head but may be conducting an experiment … putting two chemicals together.\" Improvisations might involve hours doing nothing more than watching the box – or, sometimes, study: Jean-Baptiste researched optometry, Fernandez did occupational therapy and flamenco. \"Working with Leigh is an act of faith,\" Jean-Baptiste says, \"I have never worked on anything since with such depth.\"\n\nImprovisation is a way of living the role – hours of experience that may never make it into the film. And all the actors express a special sense of \"ownership\" about their Mike Leigh characters. \"The possession is total,\" Staunton says; Sheen: \"You go into such depth. You create them. They are yours.\" Blethyn imagines her character from Secrets and Lies must still be out there somewhere: \"You want to ring her and say: 'Hello, Cynthia, how you doing?'\" Hawkins sums it up: \"You invest a lot emotionally. It is very demanding. It takes over your life. You know your character so well – what her dreams were, what she got for Christmas in 1987, every stage of her life. She becomes like part of you from a former life.\" Steadman describes Leigh as \"the third eye, the monitor, setting the character up\". Bailey used to refer jokingly to his interventions as \"acts of God\".\n\nI decide God will need to be put on the spot – but later. The women must have their say first. For convenience, Leigh's women can be divided into two groups: happy and unhappy. His films, especially the latest, raise questions about what makes women happy.\n\nRuth Sheen\n\nRuth Sheen is the happiness supremo. As Gerri, she is serene, almost queenly. She was wonderful, too, in High Hopes (1988) as Shirley, a younger working-class woman who, like Gerri, has green fingers, a heart of gold and dotes on her other half. It is a tonic to see wedded camaraderie at the centre of a film – but hard to pull off, because it is inherently undramatic. It is equally uncommon to focus on women in their 50s – age of invisibility – and bring them so richly into focus. \"What he is showing in Another Year,\" says Sheen, \"is a family that is the heart. Around them are the lonely and the sad and those detached from their emotions – where alcohol is in place of relationships.\" To develop Gerri \"took months and months\". Sheen can supply all the details of her early life – hopeful child, positive young woman, first in her family to get to university (Manchester). She is \"a thinker, a listener\".\n\nLesley Manville\n\nLesley Manville has played in seven Leigh films. \"Until I met Mike in my 20s, I played myself all the time. Now, thanks to him, I never get typecast. No one says: 'Lesley only does depressed … or working-class … or posh.'\" As her roles show, Leigh is interested not so much in showing Everywoman as any woman – no one too humble. And, it is true, Manville can do anything – but she excels at unhappiness.\n\nShe starred in All or Nothing (2002) as the distraught, anaemic-looking mother of a fat son with heart failure. She and Leigh see that film as \"the one that got away\". Her performance as Penny was superb but it cannot trump her Mary in Another Year. Mary is in the autumn of her life. She sees in Gerri a contentment she wishes she had. Manville – a single parent herself – knows \"a lot of women who are single and childless by choice\". Mary is not one of them: \"She wants love and care and attention. Her friend is the bottle, unfortunately.\" Manville volunteers: \"I've witnessed women in their 50s in a manic state of pain and loneliness.\" She felt Sheen's character could have been more tolerant: \"I used to go to Mike and say: 'Mary feels Gerri should be a bit kinder.' He wouldn't comment.\"\n\nSally Hawkins\n\nIn Happy-Go-Lucky (2008), Sally Hawkins plays Poppy (self-evidently in the happy camp), a primary school teacher who was born cheerful.Whatever happens (deranged driving instructors included) she bounces back. \"She has a talent for happiness,\" says Hawkins, \"she doesn't take things personally. She is not on the defensive. She doesn't judge.\" And here is the key to Leigh: everything is character driven – and he doesn't judge. Women are happy because of who they are more than because of what happens to them.\n\nImelda Staunton\n\nThe one exception to this is Imelda Staunton's Vera Drake, a tender-hearted abortionist with a happy family life. When her circumstances change and the cops arrest her, the change in her seems absolute, her face a picture of despair. Staunton describes working on the role as \"exhilarating\". It was only later that \"the fall-out happened. Vera Drake made a dent in my head that, at the time, I was not aware of at all. Three or four years later, I was thinking about it all the time. I'd lost that family, lost that woman. Vera made a huge impact on me.\"\n\nStaunton has a cameo role in Another Year. And the extraordinary thing is that as middle-class, unhappily married Janet, she seems more of a casualty even than Vera Drake. Leigh is known for his films about working-class life but does not make the case for happiness having much to do with money. Staunton's performance is amazing: her misery, as Janet, formidable. She excites tremendous, never-to-be-satisfied, curiosity in the audience.\n\nWe agree that Leigh has no agenda. Staunton says: \"He has no axe to grind about women … but they have as strong a role to play as men.\" If there is a generalisation, it is that maternity is the great event – disaster, disrupter or blessing – in a woman's life. It is not a subject he ever neglects. There is a painful divide – as sometimes in life – between the haves and the have-nots. There are women who cannot conceive (like Monica in Secrets and Lies or Barbara in Meantime). There are unplanned pregnancies (in Vera Drake; Secrets and Lies; All or Nothing). And there is never finding the right man or leaving it too late (Mary in Another Year). In High Hopes, it is Shirley's precarious achievement patiently to persuade her partner they should try for a baby. But there is no point to prove. This is film mirroring life.\n\nAlison Steadman\n\nBeverly, in Abigail's Party, is a mutinous exception. She dismisses pregnancy as an illness, involving going to hospital. Beverly continues bossily to hold sway over Leigh's female firmament. Alison Steadman says: \"She is unhappy, fighting to appear happy.\" Steadman's suburban diva, in her layered peach dress, towering over her guests, using first names five times in every sentence and turning robotic whenever talking to her husband, stunned her audiences. But wasn't it partly because she was such a grotesque?\n\nSteadman mildly replies that such extremes exist in real life: \"Sitting on the bus, you'll see Mike Leigh characters getting on left, right and centre. There are extremes – people go from normal to completely over the top.\" She adds: \"Most comedy is like a magnifying glass. You enlarge reality slightly.\"\n\nSteadman was married to Leigh when she made Abigail's Party (she also played gorgeously gormless Candice Marie, complete with prim speech impediment and bobble hat, in 1976's Nuts in May'). Was the work/home balance ever tricky? \"No, it wasn't peculiar or difficult. Mike has a rule never to discuss work. You put your frock away in the rehearsal room, come home and have a normal life.\"\n\nThe director's take\n\nWhen I ring Mike Leigh he wants, most of all, to celebrate Katrin Cartlidge (Career Girls and Naked). Naked was a one-off – the darkest, sexiest, most disturbing of Leigh's films. Cartlidge gave a sense in this – and Career Girls – of being a woman who wished she could live as a free spirit (not easy in practice). She was a brilliant mixture of independence, eccentricity and vulnerability. And she had such an odd beauty – like a clever emu. \"It is terribly sad you can't talk to her. If she'd lived, there is no question I would have done more with her,\" Leigh says. \"She was very special. What one remembers is the compassionate emotional depth, wit and perception. She never said a bad word about anything. As an actor she was courageous – and gorgeous.\"\n\nHe chuckles at the idea of a piece about his women: \"I'm someone who has deservedly been a signal failure at relationships … but I do have a good working relationship with actresses.\" Aside from talent, what qualities do they need? \"Patience. A sense of humour. They have to be intelligent character actors, turned on by playing people in the street. Not prima donnas. There is a great deal of hanging around while other people get it together. But the work is harmonious – a loving thing. It is also a laugh.\"\n\nAnd Leigh turns out not to be unwilling to talk about improvisations after all. He explains the third-person approach (actors never refer to their characters as \"I\") as a security device: \"Actors are not thrown on their own insecurities, because they are concerned with the character. And yet the people who are great at this work know that, despite this conceit, it is themselves they are tapping into and an essential truthfulness that comes from within them.\" There is a \"creative collusion\" that can involve something close to \"telepathy\". It is \"esoteric\" Leigh suggests. Many of the actors describe it as \"magical'. He explains that improvisation is a means to an end – huge quantities of work have to be discarded (Leigh is a virtuoso editor). The aim is to find an \"essence… the only thing that matters\" and to arrive at \"white heat\" on screen.\n\nMuch has been made of Leigh's tendency to use his \"old-timers\" again and again. But he wants to set the record straight: \"I'm always up for working with new people, like the excellent Karina Fernandez.\" His promise to returning actors is: \"We won't go to the same place.\" He sees Another Year as a \"personal, reflective film – I am 67 but can see emotional connections with my first film Bleak Moments (1971).\"\n\nIt is true – both films describe loneliness. And what would he say of himself? Is he happier now than when he made Bleak Moments nearly 40 years ago?\n\n\"Yes and no.\"\n\nManville is more upfront. \"In the latter part of his career, he's made films about reality, his earlier films involved more satire. He is happier where he is now. He is at the peak of his profession as a film-maker.\""
