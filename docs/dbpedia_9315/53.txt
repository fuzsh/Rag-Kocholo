Alan Singley and the Pants Machine

www.alansingley.bandcamp.com

In a musical climate hooked on irony, cynicism, and superficiality, Alan Singley and Pants Machine are a refreshing change. Alan Singley and Pants Machine have been putting on their Sunday best and giving Portland musical valentines for quite a while. Not afraid to make your day a good one, Alan Singley and Pants Machine compose songs packed with genuine sunshine. The lyrics are heart-on-the-sleeve revelations of life’s simple pleasures, like lying in the sun, riding a bicycle, and looking up at the stars. Alan Singley and The Pants Machine are playing their first show in over six years. Once darlings of the mid-aughts indie scene, Alan Singley’s weedjazz-pop set will remind us what pre-condo, nostalgia-filled hot summers felt like as a broke 20-something. But don’t call it a come back! Or a reunion show! The Pants Machine is booking shows on the regular from here on out. “Alan Singley is a uniter, not a divider. More than maybe any musician in Portland, Singley's giddy, enthusiastic compositions and upbeat vibe seep into his songs—so much so, in fact, that even the sadder numbers still feel bright and happy” - Willamette Week, August 2009

Colin Jenkins departs from his group, Rio Grands, to embark on a project under his own name. This will be his first show under Colin Jenkins. Jenkins sets the loungey croon aside for more downtempo, retro R&B mixed with some 90's new-jack swing nostalgia. Radiation City's Cameron Spies coproduced his forthcoming album entitled, "Good Grief," which they've been recording for the last year. "Good Grief," is in its finals stages of production, currently being mixed by local engineer hero, John Askew. His first, "Hard Candy," will be released on the 2017 PDX POP NOW compilation.
