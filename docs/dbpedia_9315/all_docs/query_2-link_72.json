        "text": "Greg Yance (GY) & Neoma Farr (NF)\n\nGreg Yance (GY): They let us know that we were going to help with sandbagging. Really didn’t know what sandbagging was. I was just happy that we was getting off the compound.\n\nAnd when I came to the river for the first time, I put my hands in it and put it on my face.\n\nNeoma Farr (NF): I seen how hard you worked, like it was your home that you was trying to save.\n\nSo I thought at lunch time, I could go over and help feed everybody. You guys were so young, and I had children your age. And I thought about if these were my children, how would I want them treated? So I treated you like you were mine.\n\nGY: And we felt that. That was why when this town flooded, that crushed us.\n\nNF: Yeah. I know that when the levee broke you guys were all upset because you didn’t think you did your job.\n\nGY: Yeah. I couldn’t look at nobody.\n\nNF: But you worked your tails off! We had so much respect for you guys. It wasn’t like, ‘Well, if they would’ve worked harder or faster… We were all in there together.\n\nSo how does it feel for you to be back here after 25 years?\n\nGY: Man, I’ve been wanting to do this for a long time. The flood, it just changed my life. When we was doing all this stuff, it made us feel like we had a purpose. What I felt when I was sandbagging and helping people, that kind of compassion. I just never been in a situation that — complete strangers helping each other.\n\nNF: I get that.\n\nGY: I mean, it’s like one of those things I put on a pedestal in my life, so I didn’t know if I wanted to come here and mess with that. You know, you’ve got your four leaf clover and you knock off a leaf and you’re like, ‘Man, I shouldn’t have ever touched it.’\n\nGY: But I’m glad I came.\n\nNF: Back then, we didn’t get to meet you as a person. I never got to know anybody’s name.\n\nI’m just so excited that I get to meet you as a man. As, ’Your name is Greg.’ And I’m just happy to meet you."
