        "text": "pop fest voting\n\nThe PDX POP List is creating a democratically elected festival of local music, mostly in the pop and rock oeuvres. It will be an all-ages three-day event in July, replete with comp CD; to voice your say in who gets to play, visit the online voting booth at www.pdxpopnow.com . Voting closes May 1.\n\nTHURSDAY 4/22\n\nDO-SI-DO FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n(Nocturnal, 1800 E Burnside) If the fear of a war-crazed monkey running our country for another four years isn't enough to get your lazy ass registering to vote, then maybe a good ol' fashioned ho-down will do the trick. Nocturnal and Tuck and the Shovelheads present to you a night of squaredancing, at which you can bow to the left, bow to the right, and sign yourself up to help change the world. JUSTIN WESCOAT SANDERS\n\nRADIO REELERS, THE MINDS, KRAV MAGA\n\n(I. C. Mummy, 332 NE San Rafael) S.F.'s Radio Reelers play punk rock like they're foaming at the mouth with cheap beer, tripping in Chuck Taylors, and unsuccessfully trying to score with clean-looking chicks. Confusing a heavy helping of pop \"oo-oo-oohs\" with the old standard scuzz, they're fun. What's funner is playing two mp3s of their same song at the same time, but slightly off time. They sound amazing, the exact sonic reproduction of being incredibly, blurrily drunk (you know, when everything is \"in a round\"). I bet that's how they are live. MARJORIE SKINNER\n\nRADIO BERLIN, THE PRIDS, THE BATS\n\n(Dante's, 1 SW 3rd) Radio Berlin and The Prids on the same bill is like a new wave orgasm. The unique song structures, dark vibe, and Cure-esque vocals of Radio Berlin make for a show that's nothing if not compelling and different than everything else that's going on tonight. Portland's Prids haven't been playing much, and they've been missed, considering their ethereal keyboard rock, wailing guitars, and vocal harmonizing translates fantastically live. KATIE SHIMER\n\nSO FINE, THE FAUX POZZ, ABRUPT EDGE\n\n(Conan's, 3862 SE Hawthorne) Tribute bands are hit and miss, but since the Faux Pozz is tributing Ozzy, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt from the start. My only advice to Faux Pozz is: play the hits--although I'm sure you're smart enough to figure that out for yourself. Unfortunately, Empyre, the Queensryche cover band, was not smart enough to PLAY THE HITS! when they last rocked Conan's, and the world suffered. KS\n\nFRIDAY 4/23\n\nQUIVAH CD RELEASE, LIGHTHEADED, SUCKAPUNCH, HUNGRY MOB, DJ WICKED, DJ VOID\n\n(Ohm, 31 NW 1st) Seventy-five percent better than El-P's jazz album, Portland hiphop faves Quivah release Break the Hold, the title track of which refers to oppression and liberation--both personal and political--in a world where globalization keeps everyone in chains. The seven-piece is musically unfaltering: both tighter and more adventurous, getting free-jazzier, folding in more vibes, tighter polyrhythms, really down tempos, and guest appearances by massive local talents like Olivia Warfield, Fogatron, Jen Dashney, Mic Crenshaw, Illaj, Rome, and Pablo. While their overt use of puns can prove bumpy, lyrically they are righteous. It is likely they are Portland's most relevant/timely musical act, in the same way, say, Dizzee Rascal embodied South London; through raw emotional lyricism, themes of self-empowerment and localized education, Quivah capture something larger than themselves: the zeitgeist of a time and place, as it unfolds. Particularly resonant is the dense, solemn \"Kendra,\" an emotional track about Kendra James and the reality of racism in Portland, which drops historical knowledge and hits the truth right where it hurts: \"You should feel ashamed if you are not enraged for her/ if you feel no pain for her/ no justice for Kendra's murder.\" Do not miss their CD release; beyond simple talent, Quivah has the potential to open a dialogue. JULIANNE SHEPHERD\n\nEXHUMED, LORD GORE, DESOLATION, CEREMONIAL CASTINGS\n\n(Conan's, 3862 SE Hawthorne) The thing with scary death metal bands is you know they're all vegetarians who live together in communal houses with chore wheels and play Magic: The Gathering in their shorts. There's something very Renaissance Fayre and plastic sword-y about the boyish passion for bands like Exhumed and Lord Gore (and I guess Desolation and Ceremonial Castings). I like Dungeons & Dragons as much as the next girl, and the hammier the better when it comes to the guitar-wielding grownup version. In which case, you've found the right show. MS\n\n8 FOOT TENDER, THE SPIDERS\n\n(Twilight Café, 1420 SE Powell) Portland's 8 Foot Tender have been around 10 years now, and in celebration they'll be playing two monster sets at their anniversary show, plus giving away CDs and a bunch of other weird shit, like a pair of pants. After such a long time together, 8 Foot's perfected a jovial punk rock sound that will have you dancing rather than slamming whiskey. 8 Foot, plus the '70s throwback rock/metal of the Spiders, and that's a key-razy show. KS\n\nRELENT FOR NO ONE, SEPTICEMIA, DEAD FACE DOWN, ROSE MOYER\n\n(Paris, 6 SW 3RD) Relent For No One = totally radical skater music, complete with a singer who has two gears for singing: One that sounds like a big cat with a BB shot in its asshole, and a down low growl that makes you want to cough just hearing it. Thrash punk and epic metal are a match made in concrete-steps heaven, and they find it with \"hero's lament\" sounding, gothy interludes (the part of metal music videos where the singer looks all serious and everything is black except you can see some rain). MS\n\nSATURDAY 4/24\n\nJAMMOTRON, NIK FURY, MACK RICE, VENOM 33.3, SEOUL BROTHER #1, MURK VISUALS\n\n(Holocene, 1001 SE Morrison, 9 pm) Sick Bay Crew cures your ailments with hiphop, dancehall, funk and ragga. Sorry for the pun. JS\n\nTEA FOR JULIE, JUNIOR PRIVATE DETECTIVE, THE UPSIDEDOWN, THE MOTIVE\n\n(Crystal, 1132 W Burnside) Tea for Julie definitely has that Radiohead circa The Bends vibe without being classifiable as a dreaded \"Radiohead Ripoff Band.\" Which means, if you like sweet, wandery pop with the occasional hard-edged meltdown you just might love Tea for Julie, and wouldn't that be wonderful. KS\n\nPINBACK, ENON\n\n(Aladdin, 3017 SE Milwaukie) Pinback, those watery San Diego indierockers, are generally wonderful on disc, and stultifyingly boring live. Luckily, Enon will funk it up with a mixture of sex, electrification, and genre-swapping. JS\n\nBEATLES TRIBUTE SHOW: DITCHLIQUOR, DRY COUNTY CROOKS, HIGH & THE MIGHTY, MORE\n\n(Twilight Café, 1420 SE Powell) A bunch of very crusty bands play from the canon of the original Kings of Pop. Should be fast, hard, and very, very catchy. JWS\n\nSUNDAY 4/25\n\nBLOOM FASHION SHOW: STEVE KRONZER & ROB WESTON, DJ MAKEOUT\n\n(Red Light, 3950 SE Hawthorne) The always-fun Red Light fashion shows are taking a turn for the serious this time, using hot punk Portland models, funky local designs, and por supuesto, vintage clothes to raise money for the Karen Gaffney Foundation, which raises Down Syndrome awareness (Gaffney, who has DS and swam the English Channel, will also model). DJ Makeout will provide eclectic yet high fashion turntablism at the beginning, and at the end Kronzer & Weston will acoustic it up. In between will be two of the best things in the world: hot people and clothes. MS\n\nMF DOOM, KURIOUS GEORGE, SHADOW GUARDIANS, CRTV DSTRCTN\n\n(Paris, 6 SW 3rd; MF Doom instore at 360 Vinyl, 4 pm) I've got $3 on brilliant masked emcee MF Doom not showing up tonight--his last two PDX shows were cancelled--but hey, third time's a charm, non? JS\n\nSWARM OF THE LOTUS, DITCHLIQUOR\n\n(Sabala's Mt. Tabor, 4811 SE Hawthorne) HOLY FUCK. Pardon me, I hate to swear, but Swarm of the Lotus induce mad expletives. I've been looking for a new metal band to love since Swarming Hoardes dropped into obscurity (not that they ever really rose from obscurity) and this is it. The drummer is kicking the living hell out of the bass drum, the guitar is practically igniting in flames, and the adrena-vocals surpass basic hardcore with an insensity that is mind-blowing. Swarm of the Lotus call themselve \"A-Bomb Rock,\" which is practically an understatement. Do not miss this show. KS\n\nMONDAY 4/26\n\nTV ON THE RADIO, HINT HINT, APOLLO HEIGHTS\n\n(Berbati's, 231 SW Ankeny) On their debut EP, Young Liars, Brooklyn's TV on the Radio sounded cast inside an icicle chamber of emotions: Angelically voiced frontman Tunde Adebimpe melted the tips of lonely emotions with his silvery coo as the electronic heartbeats of machines clicked behind him. Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes is TVOTR's first full-length, and it turns up the inner Bunsen a little, warming the music into a slightly more rock-textured, post-punk vision for the band, one that is a gorgeous showcase for the intertwining harmonies of Adebimpe and guitarist Kyp Malone. JENNIFER MAERZ\n\nCYPRESS HILL\n\n(Crystal, 1334 W. Burnside) The life expectancy of a rap group on a major averages two albums, if that. Cypress Hill reached magic number seven with the recent release of Till Death Do U$ Part. After a listen or two, B-Real, Sen Dog, and DJ Muggs have their careers hanging by the threads of the almighty dollar bill. Is there anyone who can remember the last time he or she actually bought a Cypress Hill album? Over a decade has passed since Cypress Hill left their impact on hiphop and mainstream culture with their self-titled debut in 1991 and Black Sunday in 1993. Those albums had everyone from hiphop heads to potheads singing along to anthems about \"Pigs,\" \"Hits from the Bong,\" and \"How I Could Just Kill a Man\"--and of course the frat boy favorite \"Insane in the Brain.\" MARC MATSUI\n\nTHE FIGGS, CANDY BUTCHERS\n\n(Ash Street, 225 SW Ash) On past Candy Butchers albums--1999's Falling into Place, 2002's Play with Your Head--singer Mike Viola admits that he may have been trying to be clever or obscure with his lyrics, but Hang on Mike is a much more accessible record, bursting with pop and melody. \"I think I just found there was a point in my life where I was hitting a wall, everything in my 20s was so down and ironic, not just with my art but with the way I saw life,\" he says philosophically. \"But you get older.\" Though Play with Your Head is influenced by post-Jam Paul Weller, Viola says that's not the only source for his material. \"I listened to a Big Star cassette I found in my glove compartment and I tried to go for that sound,\" he says proudly. \"I was [also] a huge Split Enz fan, so when they split up, and Neil Finn went on to form Crowded House, it was kind of a shock because that first album is so great.\" KW\n\nPRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES\n\n(Meow Meow, 320 SE 2nd) PGMG, one of the Northwest's pride-n-joyz, is making up shows tonight, sans a Nathan (the guitarist/vocalist left in March due to his new fatherhood) and plus a guest-host spot on MTV2's Subterranean. JS\n\nTHE RAPTURE, BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB, STARLITE DESPERATION\n\n(Roseland, 8 NW 6th) A couple of days ago I got a long-ass e-mail explaining that hallelujah thank the lord, raise your hands to the sky, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club has been released from their evil record label, Virgin Records. They're forging on with their current tour even without the label support, instead relying on the faithful audience that loved them for sounding like the Jesus and Mary Chain and still loves them now that they don't sound so much like that band anymore. KATHLEEN WILSON\n\nTUESDAY 4/27\n\nAIR, THE MOSQUITOES\n\n(Crystal, 1332 W Burnside) With hip movie soundtracks floating around and pretty exorbitant ticket prices on this latest tour, Air is safely, snugly nestled in the mainstream. But this duo is French, so they are genetically predisposed to be at least a little weird, and their lush, sexy dance numbers continue to exude just enough basement nerd twiddling to have something for everyone--except, of course, those who don't have $30 to blow on a concert ticket. JWS\n\nTHE ELECTRIC SIX, THE HISS, COCO COBRA & THE KILLERS\n\n(Dante's, 1 SW 3rd) Listening to Panic Movement by The Hiss, I was sure I'd gotten my hands on the next in line from the long lineage of Scandinavian rock royalty--they're brothers in arms with groups like Turbonegro, the Hellacopters, Gluecifer, and even early Division of Laura Lee. But this four-piece is actually from Atlanta, where they muddy the mix with an undercurrent of red-blooded Southern rock and some slow stoner haze. The result is kick-up-the-dust-and-ride rock 'n' roll, one that you can take out for the night and not know where it's gonna leave you, except that there's gonna be the good kinda trouble. JM\n\nWEDNESDAY 4/28\n\nALAN SINGLEY, SPOOL\n\n(Kelly's Olympian, 426 SW Washington) Tonight's selection of nationally recognized acts playing Portland highlights our town's malignant imbalance: artistic over-saturation vs. money-having showgoers. \"Too much shit to do\" is hardly something to complain about, but it is interesting to think that, any given night in town, there are at least 10-15 (no exaggeration) worthwhile local and national events going on--and that's just music. Contrast this with our boggy economy, the still-barren job market, and the fact that we only have, what, 2 million people in the whole metro area, and it's no wonder that lots of great shows are only drawing half- and quarter-crowds. It's also interesting to see what it does to our local musical economy--for instance, the PDX Pop List's Fest (see above) is an awesome group effort to showcase a chunk of local talent, but its inception was not totally altruistic--bands gunning for broader exposure (=audiences) factored in. And who can blame them, with so many musicians fighting for the same small-ish showgoing market (for lack of a better word)? Meanwhile, charming, quirky folks like Alan Singley--Swedish fish aficionado, self-employed pedi-cab driver, disciple of Burt Bacharach--up against the mighty weight of Long Winters/Savath & Savalas/Method Man et al, play on. His all-ages appeal includes kindergarteners, as his autumnal piano and folky psych harmonies create Charlie Brownical whorl, though there's nothing cartoonish about it. Rather, a willful innocence penetrates his sweet melodies, in the same way it does Phil Elvrum's. A line of evidence: \"I'm so glad you got a phone so I can call you tomorrow,\" Alan sings, and finishes the refrain with a dejected, \"but I know that I won't.\" What sweet talent, that; pencil him in. JS\n\nLONG WINTERS\n\n(Lewis and Clark, 0615 SW Palatine Hill Rd.) Long Winters is what you thought first love would be like. Back in elementary school you had big ideas. You'd do absurd crap like ride hot air balloons and eat nothing but bubblegum ice cream for weeks straight. But then you saw the downfalls, learned how relationships die, ran into the complexities of sex and the head games of dating. Before that, though, your streets were made of cake frosting and life was beautiful. Can I get a \"what a drag it is getting old\"? ADAM GNADE\n\nMETROPHYSICS: ELECTRO PHYSICS, STARRING JAMMOTRON, DJ WEEGEE, PGE, DJ GINSU\n\n(Holocene, 1001 SE Morrison) \"Electro Physics\" as in \"plugging in the beats\": tonight's DJs and live act (PGE, aka Portland General Electro) tantalize the hot motion with all manner of electro. Whether old, new, or -hop, it's the music whose dancefloor charge is mainly sexual. Conveniently, this month's installation in The Ho.'s smoking room features technology-themed art, for your frantically futuristic, sloppy make-out/smoking ambiance. JS\n\nBROKEN SOCIAL SCENE, JASON COLLETT\n\n(Dante's, 1 SW 3rd) If Broken Social Scene ever need a name change, they should choose \"Exclamation Point.\" This Canadian collective may not have the deafening roar of Strokes-level hype behind them, but they've got something a million times better--a steadily growing hum of true believers made up of real music fans won over by the band's exuberant, refreshing take on indie pop and bound and determined to convert their friends. If you want to rediscover what it's like to have a crush on an album, pick up BSS' You Forgot It in People--or even better, catch their buoyant, intoxicating live show. You'd have to have a hard, cold heart (or deaf ears) to not be won over. If no one's started a \"Broken Social Scene Army\" yet, it's only a matter of time. BARBARA MITCHELL\n\nTHE THRILLS, SPYMOB\n\n(Berbati's, 231 SW Ankeny) Counting among their fans pop culture bishops like Dave Eggers, Morrissey, and Noel \"the-Beatles-are-bullshit\" Gallagher, Ireland's the Thrills really don't need any more positive publicity. But goddamn, these boys are catchy. Their summery 2003 debut, So Much for the City, stands as an infectious, Grandaddy-tinged tribute to the Beach Boys, replete with enough piano-shimmer, guitar jangle, and sugary harmonics to make Brian Wilson proud.
