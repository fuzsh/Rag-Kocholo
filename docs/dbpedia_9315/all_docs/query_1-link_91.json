        "text": "Humanistic psychology continues to perpetuate essentialist ideology in its relation to certain subjects irrespective of poststructuralist, feminist, and queer critiques. There are 3 paragon sites where this is the case: technology, gender, and sexuality. The enframing (Ge-stell) of these themes by humanism into normative hegemony has caused them to remain trapped in a position of defunct otherness or instrumentality. This is, in part, because of humanism’s cooption of Martin Heidegger’s notion of truth as aletheia whereby being engaged in an active poiesis with the world, truth discloses itself forthrightly. An alternative to this essentialism is to take up an ontology of the trickster as told, for example, in the coyote myths of the Native Americans and advanced in academia by Donna Haraway. Truth, under the care of the trickster, is much more wily and plays the game of duping. Even though humanistic psychology has traditionally operated under the sway of an essentialist conception of truth, the enframing process always necessitates a remainder which resists any kind of essentialization and is necessarily antithetical to its constitutive category. Capitalizing on this remainder as a way out of essentialism, Haraway’s metaphorical realism is developed into a special kind of social footing through the help of positioning theory into the identity position of hypercommandeering (HCI), which is composed of a fourfold assemblage that is hyperbolic, ironic, iconoclastic, and processed. These disparate strands are gathered together in HCI so as to enable the proffering of sense while thwarting hegemony through discursive and trickster strategies of deployment. The aesthetic of the fashion house of Alexander McQueen is articulated as a model site of HCI-in-the-world; in particular, the Spring / Summer 2001 show VOSS. Implications for humanistic psychology will be offered including re-inhabiting the technological apart from instrumentality, reconceiving world-openness in a radically non-anthropocentric way, and envisioning and subverting gender and sexuality as panoptic policing agents.\n\nPsychology, as we know it today, is a fairly new concept here in Kenya. Historically, traditional medicine men and healers in the communities practiced caring interventions. They worked in areas pertaining to spiritual and psychosocial matters as well as physical ailments. Given this cultural and traditional setup, the introduction of applied psychology into the community was received initially with skepticism and denial. It was felt that the psychologists would not succeed because what they were proposing to do was already being done within the families and community and that families did not need outsiders to help them solve their problems."
