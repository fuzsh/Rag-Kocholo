When selecting a site, look for an area where the soil is well-drained and do not plant too deeply. Use mulch around the planted trees and keep them watered during dry periods.\n\nThis month plant leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, spinach, turnip, mustard and collards. Onions, radishes and Irish potatoes also can be planted this month.\n\nAs cabbage, collards and broccoli begin to grow this month, check the plants for cabbage loopers and cabbageworms. Control these pests by applying Bacillus thuringiensis, known by such product names as Dipel or Thuricide, according to label directions.\n\nAphids, also known as plant lice, attack nearly all vegetable crops. These tiny, pear-shaped pests gather in large numbers on plant leaves and suck the plant juices. Inspect vegetable crops for these pests and, if present, control with insecticides reccommended for aphids.\n\nTo prepare new planting beds, or to improve existing ones, add organic matter such as compost, peat moss or partially decayed pine bark.\n\nTransplanting of trees and overgrown shrubs should be completed early this month.\n\nBennie F. New of Thomson, Ga., is shown with his 12-foot okra plants. He had two 25-foot rows in his home garden.\n\nTHE MARKET BULLETIN\n\nWednesday January 28, 1998\n\nThis is a five foot, six inch tall banana hot pepper stalk grown by Jack H.

To fend against the elements, the Georgia Egg Commission .has developed two sides of winter and incorporated them into recipes for its current promotional campaign, \"Eggs: the Chili/Chilly Side of Winter.\"\n\nFor the \"chili\" side, the Commission developed a full meal of spicy, chili cornbread and cheese. Then, to cool down those taste buds, a recipe for a \"chilly\" lemon pie was perfected.\n\nThe recipes are printed on a dollar-bill size sheet and have been made available punched (for hanging) or unpunched to Georgia egg producers, cooperative Extension agents, teachers and industry friends at no charge. The materials also have been offered to egg promotion groups in other states.\n\nThe Georgia Egg Commission produces new materials each quarter. For a free copy of the recipes, call the Commission at (404) 363-7661 or for more information, write: the Georgia Egg Commission, 16 Forest Parkway, Forest Park, Ga. 30297.\n\nGreenhouse Giveaway\n\nDuring February the DeKalb County School System's Fernbank Science Center greenhouse will feature the \"Coffee Plant.\" While supplies last, each visitor may take a plant home.\n\nExcept for Feb. 15 during the Presidents' day holiday weekend, the greenhouse will be open to the public on Sundays from 1 to 5 p.m. There is no admission fee to the greenhouse and a horticulturist will be available. to answer questions on indoor and outdoor garden ing.\n\nFor more information, call (404) 3784311.\n\nPick-Your-Own Edition Scheduled for Feb. 25\n\nThe Market Bulletin will publish its special Pick-Your-Own Strawberry Listing on Feb. 25.\n\nIf you would like your farm listed in this section, please send your notice to our office by Feb. 11.\n\nYour notice should include your name, county, address, approximate availability, telephone number and area code, and any comments on your operation.

If the rest of your lawn is not affect-\n\ned and you used salt to remove the snow from your driveway, sidewalks and other paths, osmosis is causing the problem. Osmosis is a process whereby water stored in plant roots moves out in order to equalize salt concentrations in the soil. So, the damage to your grass probably was a result of salt and melted snow run-off.\n\n*** My kitchen is being overrun by ants. Can you recommend a natural control method? Ants often make an appearance during this time of year when the weather cools down and the heat of your kitchen becomes an irresistible lure. To control them naturally, try ginger, red pepper 9r vinegar. Either sprinkle one of these spices in the ant's path or wash the area with a half-andhalf mixture of vinegar and water.\n\nIf you have problems or questions\n\nabout products or services regulated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, write: Consumer Services, Room 226, Agriculture Building, 19 M.L.

It has its roots in the beginning of time and will impact all humanity until the end of time.\n\nAny person involved in production agriculture must understand business to stay in operation. He or she must pay retail prices for all the products and serv- ices needed to produce and sell a crop on the wholesale market and then be expected to make sufficient profit to pay normal bills one encounters in daily life. Therefore, today's agriculturist must be a good business person, capable of marketing his product in the most economically efficient manner, be computer literate, be a good communicator, be an excellent manager, and be a steward of the earth. Luck has little to do with being a good agriculturist; it takes skill and \"know how.\" An agriculturist today needs all of the education he can get; short courses, workshops, field days, and college or technical school can help a good agriculturist become better. Standing still in agriculture is actually falling behind in this ever-changing industry.\n\nOur guest columnist this week is Dr. Larry Allen, chair, Division of Agriculture and Forest Resources, Abraham Baldwin College, P.O. Box 8, 2802 Moore Highway, Tifton, GA 317942601.\n\nMy father was a farmer with a third grade education. He planted his crops and \"cut his hogs\" by the \"signs.\" One litter of hogs that we raised grew to about 200 pounds each until the signs were right for castration and guess who had the privilege of that job? In college, I learned that the proper sign to castrate was when the knife was sharp. An education doesn't guarantee success, but it makes success more likely. The next generation of agriculturists must be better trained and ready and able to work in a more technological world in agriculture that we presently can see only through a haze of uncertainty and change.\n\nI enjoy teaching at ABAC, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, and help-\n\n(Continued on Page 12)\n\nWednesday January 28, 1998\n\nFuel and Measures Division Monitors\n\nQuality of Kerosene and Antifreeze\n\nWinter is upon us in Georgia, and that means thoughts tum to kerosene for heaters and anti-freeze for automobiles.\n\nAs consumers go about their winter chores, they are reminded that the Georgia Department of Agriculture's Fuel .and Measures Division regulates kerosene used in space heaters and lamps, and anti-freeze for motor vehicles, to ensure that these products are safe and\n\nContest Set for\n\nAgriculture Day '98\n\nMarch 20 is Agriculture Day in Georgia. To highlight the vital contributions farmers and agribusinesses make to our state and nation, the Georgia Department of Agriculture and the Georgia Agriculture in the Classroom Council Inc. are sponsoring an essay and photo/art contest for Georgia students. The theme, \"My Hometown and its Contributions to Georgia's Agricultural Industry,\" has been adopted to honor the farmers and agribusinesses in your community.\n\nThe contest has two primary categories -written and visual art. The written category is open to students in grades 4-8 and 9-12, while the visual art category is open to all age groups and includes both photos and artwork.\n\nFirst, second and third place winners in all three categories will be awarded $100, $50 and $25 cash prizes, respectively. Honorable Mentions also will be named. All winners, honorable mentions and their guests will be invited to Atlanta for a special awards presentation by Commissioner Irvin.\n\nAGRICULTURE DAY 1998 Official Contest Rules Theme: \"My Hometown and its Contributions to Georgia's Agricultural Industry\" Categories - Written and Visual General Guidelines\n\n* Name, age, grade, school, home\n\ncounty, home telephone number (including area code), and teacher's name must be typed or written legibly in ink and attached to the top of written entries; photos and artwork also must include the same information (if submitted by a student) attached on a separate sheet of paper.\n\n* All entries become the property of\n\nthe sponsoring entities and cannot be returned to the owner.\n\n* The contest is restricted to Georgia\n\nresidents. Winners will be announced in\n\n(Continued on Page 12)\n\neffective. The Department each year tests sam-\n\nples of kerosene for color, sulfur content, flashpoint and end point. The color of kerosene should be close to the color of tap water, but can have a slight pink or light blue tint. If the sulfur content is too high, sulfur dioxides, which are harmful to breathe, can be emitted into the air.\n\nFlashpoint and end point determine the heat levels needed for the kerosene to fuel a heater or lamp without catching fire.\n\nKerosene is sold at many gasoline stations across the state, and the law requires . the product name, grade and price to be clearly labeled on the pump. Home heater manufacturers usually recommend that consumers use lK kerosene in unvented heaters because it has a low sulfur content compared to the 2K grade of kerosene.\n\nThe winter months also see consumers buying antifreeze in large quantities. The Department licenses antifreeze brands, which have been tested and certified by independent laboratories. These labs test samples of antifreeze each year from manufacturers who want to sell their product in Georgia. Tests of the physical properties of antifreeze, such as density, corrosion resistance, water content,. pH, freeze point and boiling point, are performed by these laboratories to make certain that the product is free from contamination and will protect an engine from cold temperatures.\n\nTo ensure proper protection, a: mixture\n\nof 50 percent concentrate antifreeze with 50 percent water.is recommended, but the percentage of antifreeze used depends upon the degree of protection desired. Although a higher concentration of antifreeze can be used, no more than 70 percent of the radiator fluid should be antifreeze. A pre-mix antifreeze also is available on the market for consumers to use \"as is.\"\n\nIn addition, consumers are advised to read all precautionary statements and package directions on the product label.\n\nFor additional information on antifreeze or kerosene, call toll-free 1800-282-5852.\n\nNext Handicraft Edition\n\nScheduled for Feb. 18\n\nThe next handicraft edition for the Market Bulletin is scheduled for Feb. 18.
