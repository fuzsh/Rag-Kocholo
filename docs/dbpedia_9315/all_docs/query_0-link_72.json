        "text": "This chapter argues that contrary to conventional wisdom and the views of many scholars and critics, rock and roll’s most important rhythmic elements are derived from a complex blend of African, American, and European musical traditions. There is therefore no objective support for racialized characterizations of the “beat” that often serve, however unintentionally, to perpetuate stereotypes in discussions of both the genre and American popular music more\n\nCountry is without a doubt the whitest American genre of music, and the banjo is the most quintessential instrument used in it. Both the musical style and the instrument, however, have their roots in African-American culture. It is widely believed that the blackface minstrel tradition in the nineteenth century not only appropriated and ridiculed African Americans but also eventually alienated them from their own music. This chapter will demonstrate that African-American country music continued to thrive, if not flourish, in the twentieth century. It will also examine how contemporary Black musicians have begun to rescue and redeem their musical heritage from the racist baggage of the past, thereby beginning to break the blackface tradition and legacy. These artists have started to combat the stereotypes surrounding country music and attempt to use this genre as a medium to not only entertain but also educate and enlighten. Particular reference will be made to the oldtime/country string band the Carolina Chocolate Drops and the various offshoots and solo projects of its members."
