Then, we’ll start right in on the story of Yvain, a knight of King Arthur's court who'll show that by being a huge jerk to nearly everyone you'll get everything you can ever want, throw it all away, and get it all again! Then, for the mythological creature of the week, the hidden folk of Iceland, cheerful little elves who might give you great gifts or rain rocks down on you. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n1B-Knights of the Round Table: You’re So Yvain\n\nThis week, we're continuing the story of Yvain, a knight of King Arthur's court who we left in a very bad spot. He'll find an ally within the castle walls, get a magic ring, and try to find a way to hold out, since it's only a matter of days until Arthur will be there with his knights. The picture linked above is the Mythological Creature of the Week: the sad, sad story of the changeling - a troll baby who's only crime was not being as stylish as a human baby. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n1C-Knights of the Round Table: The Lion Knight Rises\n\nIn this episode, you'll see that you should definitely interfere if you see two apex predators fighting to the death in the wilderness. We'll finish the story of Yvain, a knight of King Arthur's court, as he (mostly) sees the error in his ways and (mostly) seeks atonement for his extreme selfishness. After you hear the creature of the week, you won't want to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night for fear of running into this greasy little red guy from Japanese mythology. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n2A-Aladdin: The Magician’s Nephew\n\nThe story of a poor man who finds a being of unlimited power, and not only uses it to put food on the table, but goes a little farther to take over the kingdom and become the richest man alive. It's the original story of Aladdin, but it's very different from the story you know. The jinni (actual spelling of genie, by the way), don't really grant wishes. Listen to this episode to hear the bizarre original story that led to inspired retellings. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n2B-Aladdin: A Whole New World of Problems\n\nIn the conclusion of the original Aladdin story, there's the meteoric rise of Aladdin, who is definitely not using magic to do any of this. Really. Will people just stop asking him that, already? I mean, so what if he made the most magnificent palace in the world overnight, and that it randomly disappeared. Nothing at all suspicious about that. In the creature of the week, there's shapeshifting dolphin people. Here's the picture mentioned in the show...I could see it: And here's a link to what Mary Sue means. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n3A-Vikings: The Norse and the Furious, Bredi’s Drift\n\nSwords, dragons, werewolves, Vikings, betrayal, and revenge are all hallmarks of the thrilling, yet little known, Saga of the Volsungs, the story of an ill-fated medieval Nordic family. One of J.R.R. Tolkien's first Nordic reads, it's a tale of honor, love, loss, and vengeance, as well as the numerous benefits of just letting it go. Also, I talk about the barbegazi, a helpful little frozen beard with huge feet. Here are the promised pictures! (go to the website for the pictures) See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n3B-Vikings: All that Hate’s Gonna Burn You Up\n\nThe Saga of the Volsungs continues, with a princess held captive by the man who killed her father, and her brother roaming the forest waging a covert guerrilla war...or just robbing people for the fun of it? There are berserker werewolves, magic swords, and a battle of really stupid insults between kings. Also, you'll see if a legendary Norse mustache is an effective filter for poisons. The creature of the week is the fossegrim, a nice guy who loves mutton and teaching people how to play the fiddle. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n3C-Vikings: Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken\n\nYou can clearly see J.R.R. Tolkien's inspiration in this episode, what with that cursed ring finally making an appearance, a legendary sword reforged, and a selfish psychopath of a dragon sitting atop a pile of gold. Loki casually says something when he walks out the door which tears a family apart, and Odin is not fooling anyone when he (seemingly constantly) pretends to be an old man wandering the wilderness. There are also more huge Viking battles as well as more people transforming into animals for no reason at all. The creature of the week is a relative of the leprechaun whose sole goal in life is to get drunk in your basement and harass dogs. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n3D-Vikings: Blood of the Dragon\n\nPart four and the penultimate episode in the Saga of the Volsungs, the story of a legendary Norse family finds Sigurd riding with his Vikings in an attempt to reclaim his father's kingdom. Then, there's a fight with the dragon, Fafnir, who is in the possession of the cursed ring. Sigurd, our (so far) valiant hero, folds to the temptations of a magical ring way faster than Frodo, Bilbo, or even Boromir. In the creature of the week, you'll see why you need to treat your footwear will respect and kindness...oh and keep it from getting bored, or else it will come to life and annoy you. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n3E-Vikings: The Debt is Paid\n\nThe final chapter of the Saga of the Volsungs follows Sigurd as he finds that navigating relationships with the in-laws is way, way more hazardous than fighting a dragon. He finds the famliy he never had, but generations of betrayal and murder finally catch up with what has been perhaps the most honorable of the Volsungs...you know, minus that one tiny murder he committed. Also, if someone with nothing to gain from it tells you a ring is cursed, you should absolutely believe them. In the creature of the week, you'll see why funeral homes should be surrounded by catnip and toy mice in order to keep this giant, spectral Celtic cat from stealing souls.

The original character is almost completely awesome and very different from many retellings. Unfortunately, the inspiring central message of the story is a modern interpretation of something that was actually very insulting. Also, villain is less of a looming, hulking Hun, and more a bandit with a name of a spandex print. This is the story of Mulan as it was originally told. The creature of the week is why you'll want to make sure you're very drunk before going into the woods alone at night.

It's the bizarre, sad, and kind of hilarious story of Koschei the Deathless, a man who seems like a much more serious and dangerous version of the Ice King from Adventure Time. Really, if you're horrible sorcerer who's a little lonely, maybe stop kidnapping princesses and just get a cat. Or a hobby. I hear podcasting is fun? Really, though, this is exactly the type of story I love doing on this podcast. I doubt you've heard it, but it is scary, ridiculous, and a little sad, and I hope you enjoy it. The creature of the week is the Boo Hag, a morning breath vampire, and she's a great reason for you to chew an onion before going to bed. Link to iTunes for reviews/subscriptions: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/myths-and-legends/id990897842 Link to the site: https://www.mythpodcast.com See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n5B-Slavic Folklore: The First Horcrux\n\nAs it turns out, Koschei the Deathless is very, very hard to kill, a fact one could probably guess from his name. This episode explores his tragic origins, as well as the ludicrously complex way he's hidden his soul (a Russian nesting doll situation that's unpleasant for everyone involved). He'll prove his name incorrect as he finally meets his demise in what amounts to the most heart-wrenching egging of all time. In the creature this week, despite forests being kind of the only place where forest fires can take place, this sticky giant thinks nothing of tapping the ashes from his giant cigars into the dry leaves. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n6A-King Arthur Prologue: The Once and Really Only that One Time King\n\nThe King Arthur legends don't actually start with Arthur, but with several years of war, intrigue, and betrayal among the Britons, and a slippery earl by the name of Vortigern not-so-subtly engineering the deaths of two kings to become king himself. We'll start at the very beginning, with Arthur's grandfather being murdered and his father fleeing across the channel to protect himself from assassins working for a usurper king. We'll also meet Merlin as a child, as he's being hunted by the king's men in the Welsh highlands. On the creature of the week, if you're thinking about a career change into the medical field, forget all that annoying education and just become a Fairy Doctor. This somehow completely real profession from the middle ages doesn't involve any of that pesky schooling that a boring old MD requires, but allows you to heal people from this week's creature, an extremely dangerous and extremely adorable fairy from Gaelic folklore. Talk to me on Twitter Transcript (and pictures) for this episode Find this on iTunes See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n6B-Merlin: What’s Red, White, and Fighting All Over\n\nThis is where we meet Merlin, a son of a demon who uses his evil powers for good. But he's not yet the bearded sorcerer we all kind of know and love. No, he first enters our story as a serious seven year-old with power over magic, the ability to prophesy, and knowledge of the past, present, and future. The only problem? He's about to be executed by Vortigern's magicians. Luckily, his life will be saved by not one, but two dragons. Its the origin story of the world's most famous legendary wizard. Then, on the creature of the week, you'll hear me embarrass myself trying to pronounce the name of this big, stupid dog.

We'll see the final(ish..for now at least) battle between the Saxons and the Britons, and then the rule of King Arthur's uncle and father. Uther then decides to risk this extremely tenuous peace to woo a woman who isn't into him at all. And by woo, I mean declare war against her and her husband and use your fancy magician friend's fancy magic to trick her into...well, you'll see. Then, the sword in the stone! Also, the definitely true origins of Stonehenge! The creature of the week carries an impractically large bowl of blood with him at all times - just sloshing around everywhere he goes - that he will dump on you if he catches you on the road at night.

It's the story of a teenage mermaid who falls in love with a human and makes a deal to get legs, but that's where the similarities end. The original includes bald mermaids, daggers, and a great way to blackmail your kids into being good. If you've ever wanted to know way, way too much detail about a mermaid society, but hate it when your characters have names or plausible motivations, this story is for you. But really, it's very weird, and it makes you wonder why it has not only survived to the modern day, but is incredibly popular and has inspired multiple retellings. In the creature of the week, an ape man you can't hide anything from, but who has an extremely short attention span.

It would have been fine if people didn't keep dragging him back to civilization...or if he had thought at all about what he would do during the winter. You'll see that \"insane\" in this story is kind of a loose term for \"I just want a little 'me' time in the forest.\" On the creature of the week, you'll meet that thing that yells all night in your kitchen and shatters all your good plates, and I'll guess at what she's doing with all that evil linen thread she's spinning. See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\n9-Dogs and Wolves: Generations (Fenrir, The Black Dog, Dog King of Denmark, Gelert)\n\nInstead of one long story, this week I'm telling four stories about canines from folklore from all around the world. We'll go back to the Norse gods and goddesses where Loki will make more poor choices. Then I'll talk about the legend of the black dog of the UK and Ireland. There's the weird and hilarious story of a little dog that was made king of Denmark, and how the people took it surprisingly seriously. Finally, I'll round out the show with the saddest story about a dog you've ever heard. Also, I know Fenrir is a wolf and not a dog, but his inclusion will fit with the narrative arc of the show, I promise. On the creature of the week, it's a tiny, angry old man who lives in an anthill and really, really wants you to stay off his lawn.

This week, in the origin story of one of the greatest mythological heroes of the western world, we get to see the human side of the demigod before the story goes completely off-the-rails and it's just one big monster fight topping the next. But don't worry, there are also monster fights this episode. We'll see that Zeus is essentially the Don Draper of the Greek pantheon, only without all that pesky introspection or likability, and that if your husband cheats on you, you should bring down horrible punishments on everyone but him. On the creature of the week, it's a grotesque little piggy that just needs a hug.

The creature of the week are invisible weasel brothers that might give you a small cut or two...or might cut off your legs...all without you feeling it.

I don't want to ruin them, so I can't say too much, but they are amazing. One is about a boy who draws pictures of cats, much to the detriment of his job and a ridiculous amount of ancient books. The other story is about a kind fisherman who saves a turtle and has his whole world turned upside down. On the creature of the week, it's a naked guy who, if he helps you, just thank him and be on your way. Seriously, who cares if he could have cut the grass more?

Not an insult or a metaphor, no, these were women who were thought literally to be pigs from the neck up. Crowds gathered to harass potential pig-faced women and chase their carriages, and they apparently made appearances at fairs. This is an incredibly bizarre series of events that is all but forgotten in the modern day, but bears were shaved, legacies were tarnished, and there were men from an ocean away proposing marriage to a pig-faced woman. On the creature of the week, it's a bird who can escape from any predator, but after you hear the route it needs to take, you'll wonder if it shouldn't just let itself get caught. Patreon! Patreon!

It contains Viking battles, murder, betrayal, and heartbreak, uncommonly-ugly peasants, and, of course, a dragon fight. For the creature of the week, if anyone in the woods calls to you from a bush asking you to stop what you're doing to play a tickle game, you should probably say no. You should definitely say no if it's this long-fingered creature who will literally tickle you to death. Say hello on the Facebook Patreon! Paye-tree-on!

They have seen ghostly doubles haunting their steps, foretelling their doom. These things are called doppelgängers, and while they mean something different now - basically someone that looks like you - their folklore origins are something far more ominous and sinister. This episode is about the shadowy creatures of ill omen that follow us all, and the famous historical figures that have seen theirs before they met their end. The creature of the week is an extended, creepy story of a creature from Japanese folklore, and a solitary priest that became lost in the mountains. Patreon!

Ragnar's poor planning when it comes to cementing his legacy blows up in his face, and we catch up with Aslaug, the daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild, and the atrociously ugly couple that murdered her grandfather.

This leads us into a Russian nesting quest situation, where he ends up on a quest-within-a-quest-within-a-quest. We'll also follow his doofus brothers, who decide that taking an extended camping trip getting drunk in their silk party tents is much better than questing. On the creature of the week, it's a large horse-headed monster who will push you down or trample you...all while giggling like a child.

It involves tensions between two kingdoms, a deadly poetry slam, and dumb bandits. The creature of the week is a small chicken that will give you lots of gold...if you can keep it from sitting on you in the middle of the night and giving you nightmares.

Daedalus, the inventor, is directly responsible for the labyrinth and the Minotaur. He's a man whose will to survive and desire for significance drives him to make magnificent things, which only bring death, destruction, and tragedy for him and everyone around him.

The story of St. Nick includes grisly murders and mentions of prostitution.

Then, on the creature of the week, you'll see how buying sunglasses for the guard might help you rob a temple. Become a member?

We're back in the time of kings, princesses, and intrigue. You'll see how you can steal a kingdom with fancy accounting, curse a nation because of a careless comment, and start a war to prove to your spouse how rich you are. The creature of the week is the monaciello from Naples, Italy. When he's not helping you, he's stealing your clothes...off your body... Become a member?

Only one man, barely out of childhood himself, can stand against the invaders and protect his people until they are able to rise. That man is Cu Chulainn. This week, we learn the origin story of this Irish superhero (he's kind of literally a superhero, too. He can hulk out.), including how he got his name, which basically means dog. The creature of the week is one that will, unsurprisingly, drag you into the river and kill you. What is surprising, though, is the party that happens in your village when you kick it out.

It involves a young man hulking out numerous times, several creative ways to kill your opponent in single combat, and a fight to the death between best friends. Also, you'll see why you shouldn't bring your squirrel to an active war zone. The creature of the week is a scary, hairy little zombie who, like Jack Frost, will nibble at your toes. Unlike Jack Frost, though, he will bite them clean off. Become a member?

In a podcast episode that is like the movie \"Mean Girls\" with a trip to the Greek underworld, you'll see why it is against the law to harbor someone who's prettier than a goddess.

Thor's hammer is gone. It was stolen...or he just left it somewhere and forgot about it. To get it back, though, he's going to have to do something more difficult than fighting legions of giants. He's going to need to get married. And there's the origin of poetry, which contains way more men formed from spit than you'd expect for the origin of poetry. On the creature of the week, seriously, just stay out of the woods. It never ends well. Except when it does, and you find love and learn to put on a puppet show. Become a member!

The story of the Lambton Worm is a quest for redemption where many people die because of a young man who just wants to yell cuss words at children and throw his trash in a well.

One is about a humble, happy stone cutter who becomes a power-mad, bitter stone cutter. The other is about, surprise surprise, supernatural occurrences at a Buddhist temple in a remote mountain region. The creature of the week is...or are...the blue men of the Minch.

Less than one year into his reign, he is hiding behind the walls of a castle waiting for the best moment to escape, all while Merlin stands atop the wall shooting fire at the armies assembled out front.

We'll learn all about that beast and the line of kings cursed to hunt it. Then, Merlin shows up with a chilling plan to solve the problem of the child that is destined to grow up to destroy Arthur. We'll also meet Balin, a disgraced knight who just got out of jail and meets with an unexpected quest for redemption...that might just curse all of England. On the creature of the week, you'll learn why you want to stock up on pineapples, especially if you are pregnant and don't want this mosquito-like vampire coming after you.

He'll find himself on a perilous (and, at times, ridiculous) quest, where he'll inadvertently put the events in motion that will start the quest for the Holy Grail. Oh, and Arthur gets the Round Table and gets married. The creature this week is the little naked person buried just below the ground who will scream horrendously if you try to pick him out. Also, he might just kill you. Our sponsor: SeatGeek! (Link to the app on iOS) (Link to the website) Don't forget the promo code MYTHS for a $20 rebate!

We'll also talk about the Titanomachy, the very literal clash of the Titans at the very beginning of Greek mythology, where Zeus comes to power and we all learn that any policy that involves crazy paranoia is basically the only one a Greek god considers.

The first is the story of Rapunzel, and the second is about a small tailor who uses one success to face giants, a rampaging boar, and a unicorn when seeking the hand of the princess. The only problem? His greatest achievement may be based on a lie, and he's either the world's smoothest con man or completely delusional. Or both. The creature this week is a stack of old weasels.

There's a dangerous Viking teddy bear, and if an angry, famed warrior offers to show you his arrows up close, do not take him up on that offer.

We also catch up with our old friend Loki from Norse mythology, who just wants to give Thor's wife an impromptu, un-asked-for haircut.

The original contains way too much description about fairy politics and power structures, 18th century Pandora, and an idea for a \"Downton Abbey\" reboot...with monkeys.

In reality, Pocahontas likely never view Smith as more than a friend, since she was 11 when they first met. But they won't meet quite yet. We need to talk about the world they both inhabit, and the nations that will collide in the early 17th century.

This isn't the Disney version. It is gritty, dark, violent, and, if Mattaponi oral history is to be trusted, fairly disturbing. Still, it tells the story of a clash of worlds, and one woman who stood in the middle to bring a brief peace. The creature this week lives in lime trees and, in return for probably not paying rent, will hurt you if you're mean to the tree.

There are sea monsters, centaurs, people being thrown off of things, Hydra poison, and Hercules making ridiculous choices. Basically, it's everything you could want from a Hercules episode. Oh, and he dies, because apparently he can do that. The creature this time is the Mamagwasewug, and he just wants to borrow a smoke off you...or he'll burn your house down.

It is both an awesome adventure tale with dragons, magic, assassins, demons, bandits, and betrayal, and a complex human drama, where one young man must find and understand his place in the world. It's both action-packed, and heartbreaking. The titular character, Gildong, was born a second-class citizen, and he was determined to make a way for himself in a world that kept pushing him down, even if that meant living outside the law. This is his story. The creature this time is the saalah, and they are what happens when a mommy genie and a daddy human (or the other way around) love each other very much. Loot crate is fantastic.

It then moves beyond Korea to mythical lands, where Gildong battles demons and becomes a doctor. Or pretends to be a doctor. I mean, it's a frontier setting in the 1600s, let's not split hairs. It's basically the same thing. The creature this time, is cactus cat. It's a cat who wants to get drunk and party like it's 1910.

There's a blood ocean, a giant primeval cow, and some light grandpa murder. Thor and Loki take two kids on a field trip to Jotunheim, where, like any family vacation, Thor gets in a drinking contest and wrestles an old lady. Then, Odin travels to the far reaches of the void for wisdom and learns that he must pay a terrible price only to learn that the end, when the universe will once again be bathed in ice and fire, is coming. The creature of the week is the sandman and you shouldn't let your kids listen to it, especially if it's right before bedtime. Basically, growing up in the middle ages was terrible and I don't know how anyone made it out without some severe psychological trauma. Sponsors: Loot Crate!

We'll be talking about the story of Lancelot - where this incredibly important character came from and why he's know as Lancelot of the Lake (spoiler alert, he grew up in a lake). Merlin gets weird, and we catch up with a certain lion-befriending knight that helped to kick off this whole podcast. The creature is the bouncy bear who is basically a bullet-proof superhero...if all superheroes did was eat horses and sleep. Sponsors!

He'll finally see the end of his quest... Either by plummeting to the choppy waters below...or by the lions on the other side of the sword...or the castle full of people who want to kill him on the other side of the lions.

It has evil step-mothers, murderous step-sisters, and helpful cows who will vomit up your work and call you stupid. Trying to grow a beard and keep your five-year-old from having dreadlocks? Then you do not want this week's creature hanging around your house.

Nightingale can fly, kill with a scream, and lives in the shadows of his forest. The journey will take our hero from home, through multiple stays with Baba Yaga(s), and finally into a confrontation with the legendary bandit on a quest to become the man he never thought he could be. The creature this week is sweaty, hairy, and naked...and the only way you can beat it is by wrestling it.

We meet vile beasts that lurk in the forests, the murky deep, and the wide, desolate places of the world. We meet the baby, the Thor, and the saints that slay them. We meet bears that can be bribed with cake. Folklore is weird. The creature is a little blue person. I know it's a struggle to not play in barley fields after school. It's a temptation we all deal with every day. Just don't do it. It will end with you being eaten by a little blue monster. Also, don't sumo wrestle children in the street.

The first is from Japanese folklore, and it's about making the most of what you have...even when what you have is a dirty piece of straw and a fly friend. The second story is about a man who made a deal with the devil...and all the stupid (maybe brilliant?) decisions he made after that deal. The third story is that of Rumpelstiltskin, a weird little imp that might have been a hero if he didn't insist on purchasing humans. The creature of the week the poludnica, and she is looking out for you and your rights at work...violently. Sponsors: Check out that fresh, delicious goodness sent straight to your door.

There is a dragon, a giant bronze robot, and court intrigue, leading to some familiar names coming back to help Jason travel to a faraway land and obtain the golden fleece. Those names include Hercules, Theseus, Laertes (father of Odysseus), Autolycus, Peleus (the father of Achilles), Augeus (with the legendarily dirty stables), and more. It's the biggest meetup of everyone we've met so far...well, everyone that isn't in Hades (Sisyphus) tied to a rock (Prometheus) or wandering blind through a plain (Bellerophon). The creature looks so much like a normal person it's uncanny. I mean, he looks like a normal person once you get past his humorously big ears, nose, and hands. And his gray skin...that sometimes glows. Ok, he looks nothing like a normal person.

We find them making all haste for Colchis...except for all the times they stop to feast...and drink too much...and meet beautiful women...and get in unnecessary boxing matches. We also meet the princess Medea; catch up with Cupid (Eros), a hot-shot toddler who plays by his own rules; and Theseus will remember something very, very important. The creature this week is a roaring, spectral bull...who isn't all that dangerous, just incredibly annoying. Sponsors: Check out MVMT watches.

This is a big episode. If you've made it this far in the series, though, it probably doesn't matter what I write here, because you are either into the Argonaut story or not. Really, though, it is a cool episode and there are about three twist murders, a wedding, and a king with a great name. The creature is the sea-trow, shockingly dumb and frightfully ugly, you might be offended by his pranks...if they made any sense... Want to say hi on Twitter?

Things have been pretty easy for Jason. Medea solved all of his problems before he even knew he had them on the Argo, and her fairly violent murder-by-proxy of Pelias secured Iolcus for Jason's father. It would probably be a very bad idea to cheat on Medea, right? Hard times are about to catch up with Jason.

Instead of diving into the stories of the past, I’m telling stories of the present. Urban legends are a more modern version of folklore where, instead of telling stories of hydras and butter cats, we tell stories of things that might just exist. In these, people are the true monsters, and the most mundane of situations can be strange, dangerous, and terrifying.

They have murder, kidnapping, and, of course, hot dance moves. Bluebeard is, unsurprisingly, a man with a beard that is blue. What is surprising is what you'll find in his basement. The creature is from West Africa and will either sit you down for a months-long compulsory lecture on folklore...or drain your blood with its feet and eat you. I'm not sure which is worse.

Also, why you should respect your elders, especially if they want to give you a lot of free bread and vodka. The creature is the Lake Worth Monster, from Texas in the US. It is either a monstrous man-goat-fish...or a teenager who likes ice cream. NEW SHOW!!

The fictional vampire is a product of Bram Stoker. The name, though, stretches back centuries to a prince who ruled the kingdom called Wallachia, which borders the land with which he's most famously associated: Transylvania. We'll be talking all about the pseudo-legendary exploits of the real bloody tyrant, the bizarre rules surrounding fictional vampires, and the inspirations for the most famous vampire novel of all time.

Most of his hijinks are light-hearted, and end with him getting his comeuppance, but it comes in the form of being a bridesmaid at Thor's wedding or (as in this episode) an extremely uncomfortable game of tug-of-war. What happens when a trick gets taken too far? What is the final act that turns friends into enemies and creates a rift that will consume the worlds?

It is quite possibly the oldest epic we have, and though it only exists in fragments, it tells a surprisingly human story. There are questions of life and death, such as what it all means and why are we here? It delves into the issues of what it means to be a human rather than just a beast, what it means to be a good ruler, and what it means to leave a legacy. These are questions relevant even today, over 4,000 years after this story was told. Of course, it is also folklore, so there is a troubling amount of hairy nudity. All-in-all, this three-parter will be epic. For the creature of the week, we'll meet a creepy forest dweller with an unexpected hobby.

If those things don't make you want to listen to this episode I can't think of anything else that would. The creature this week is splinter cat, the enemy of arboretums everywhere.

This story is bizarre and wonderful and a testament to the endurance of love and the continuing admonishment to avoid entering spooky castles in dark folklore forests.

The second story is from Cree fokllore, about Monster Skunk farting everyone to death because this is a serious podcast that takes itself very seriously. The creature is evil.

Then, I'll tell the story of the curse of the house of Atreus, starting with Tantalus and his questionable food choices. It's a long, dark episode, so get ready.

Given to him by God, it allowed him control demons...but it also had some other powers unknown to Solomon, powers that make it essential for fighting dragons, escaping witches, and taking nice Sunday afternoon flights through the country. The creature is a shaggy, mostly-kind monster who is really great at walking on hillsides and really terrible at helping you hang pictures.

Also, you shouldn't follow Loki into the wilderness, no matter how good the party he is telling you about sounds, and we'll learn how far is too far when it comes to idle, drunken boasts in the halls of the gods. The creature is a sweet little flaming chicken who will steal for you and not feel bad about it at all. Oh, you have some moral issues with stealing? Well, the flaming chicken doesn't have moral issues with burning your house to the ground, so you might want to keep your compunctions to yourself.

The character of the cat has somehow gone on to be voiced by Antonio Banderas, take part in a one really successful franchise, spin off into its own movie AND Netflix series. The 2011 movie alone went on to gross, and I'm not making this up, over half a billion dollars worldwide. The original is something you haven't heard before, and has ogre fights, a cat con artist, and dating advice from the Myths and Legends Podcast.* The creature this week has the boring job of constantly trying to destroy the universe, but hey, it gets two weeks paid vacation a year.

Except, in the earliest version, it doesn't go like that at all. I won't spoil it, but the original frog prince is extremely bizarre, and I had the most fun writing it of any episode so far. The second story is of a frog princess, from Russian folklore, and not only is it a great story in its own right, with a stupid king and a ridiculous dating service, but we'll catch back up with our favorite witch living in a house on chicken legs and a certain deathless sorcerer early in his career. The creature of the week shoots hail out of its ears and kills anyone it sees...unless you're carrying a sack of llama fat.

I've met people with varying degrees of familiarity with the story. Some are familiar only with the central premise of the story, while others' knowledge only extends to a certain disgusting little complex popularized by a similarly-disgusting Viennese psychologist. Regardless, the story of Oedipus is a fascinating commentary on fate, our willing blindness to uncomfortable truths, and why you should, under no circumstances, talk to prophets. Seriously, they will mess up your life. The creature this week is the Tanuki from Japan, with two big surprises for you. ------- Sponsors: Loot Crate this month looks amazing.

Make them as ridiculous as possible. The stories of Paul Bunyan arose from the camps of lumberjacks in the US in the 1880s, but he spread to be a nationwide symbol of American strength and a pioneer spirit. Except that a lot of what we know about Paul Bunyan might actually not be folklore, but stories made up to sell stuff. Also, if someone tells you to put something up your nose that feels like bees and lightning, just say no. Sponsors: Loot Crate this month looks amazing.

I know I did, and it's a great story. There are beheadings, green guys, confusing interactions with ladies. It might be one of the most violent non-Die Hard Christmas stories. Anyway, everyone knows that. You probably don't know the story I'll tell today. It's of how Gawain grew into the paragon of virtue he's known as in the legends. It involves, of course, dog parties, inept knights, and the most grotesque piece of neckwear we will ever talk about on this podcast. The creature is a bunch of tiny guys who want to hang out in your room and dance, as long as you're cool with it. Just kidding - they don't care if you're cool with it.

The Green Knight had his head chopped off last episode...but still carried it out of the most uncomfortable Christmas dinner ever. Really, it's not easy being Gawain, who has to go present his neck in payment. Except it really is easy being Gawain. Most of this episode will consist of him sleeping until noon in a fancy castle. But he still has that date with destiny on New Year's Day...and by \"destiny\" I mean a hairy green gentleman who is really good at pole vaulting. If you disrespect the hobbies of the creatures this week, they will make your life mildly uncomfortable for like an evening. You've been warned.

Confidant. Traitor. Sister. All of those words describe Morgan Le Fay, King Arthur's half-sister. She is by far the most complex character I've come across in the Arthurian legends, but she's constantly portrayed in the medieval and early modern texts as a one-note traitorous baddy who is evil because she's an evil sorceress and evil sorceresses are evil. If you're familiar with the legends, you're going to see a Morgan you've never seen before. If you're not, ge"
