Hart PBR Challenge in Decatur Saturday. Boudreaux Campbell, 11, of Plantersville, held on to finish third in the event. Bull speed ahead Riders found quite a challenge at J.W. Hart PBR By BRANDON EVANS Aaron Pass, 21, of Hillsboro held on through two rough rounds to clench first place overall in the seventh annual J.W. Hart PBR at the <strong>Wise</strong> <strong>County</strong> Sheriff’s Posse Arena in Decatur. The bulls proved tougher than most of the riders Saturday night. After cycling through 47 riders, only eight managed to score. Cloven hooves danced dangerously across the sand as the bulls spun like whirling dervishes. The 1,500 pound behemoths bucked off the rugged riders again and again. “They brought in some tough bulls,” said Andrew Rottner, one of the event coordinators. Riding Mr. Personality, Pass scored 82 in the first round, putting him in seventh. Douglas Duncan, 23, of Alvin won the first round with a score of 88. Pass sealed the win with a score of 91 in the championship round taking home purse of $4,568.20 for 16 seconds of work. Pass is currently ranked 53rd in the world. Mike Lee, 26, of Decatur, was the only local in Saturday’s PBR. Lee, one of the top 10 riders in the world, failed to score. A chocolate-colored bull named Lil Red Cat tossed him into the red dirt right out of the chute. “I just got a bad start,” Lee said. “Somehow my foot ended up on the back of his neck, and that’s never a good way to start.” WISE COUNTY Fire consumes vacant mobile home By BRANDON EVANS A fire destroyed a mobile home in the 100 block of righton Oaks Drive Monday afternoon in southern ise <strong>County</strong>.
