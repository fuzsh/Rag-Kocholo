        "text": "Singley History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe present generation of the Singley family is only the most recent to bear a name that dates back to the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. Their name comes from having lived in the village of Singleton found in the counties of Lancashire and Sussex. The surname Singley is a habitation surname which was originally derived from pre-exiting names for towns, villages, parishes, or farmsteads. The literal meaning of the surname Singley is farm in the burnt clearing from the Old English word sengel. 1\n\nEarly Origins of the Singley family\n\nThe surname Singley was first found in Lancashire at Singleton-in-the-Fylde (Singleton), a chapelry, in the parish of Kirkham, union of the Fylde, hundred of Amounderness or in Sussex at Singleton, a parish, in the union of West Hampnett, hundred of Westbourn and Singleton.\n\nThe Lancashire chapelry seems to point to the family's origin as in \"Singleton (Lancashire) is mentioned in the Domesday Survey, and was once the property of a family of the local name\" 2 and \"a parish in Sussex, and a chapelry in Lancashire. The latter was long possessed by a very ancient family. \" 3\n\nThe chapelry was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Singletun 4 and in 1185 as Sengelton. 1 The township of Thornley cum Wheatley in Lancashire was once held by the family. \"Thomas, Earl of Derby, in the 14th of Henry VII., purchased the manor of Thornley-cum-Wheatley from Charles Singleton.\" 2\n\nWarton in Lancashire was also an early home of the family. \"In the 7th of Henry VIII. the manor of Warton was held by Richard Singleton, of Broughton Tower.\" 2\n\nEarly History of the Singley family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Singley research. Another 76 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1543, 1544, 1618, 1637, 1640, 1677 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Singley History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nSingley Spelling Variations\n\nUntil the dictionary, an invention of only the last few hundred years, the English language lacked any comprehensive system of spelling rules. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Singley include Singleton, Singleturn, Shingleton and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Singley family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include: Robert or John Singleton (d. 1544), an English Roman Catholic divine who belonged to a Lancashire family and was educated at Oxford, but does not appear to have graduated. \"He became a priest, and for some utterances which were accounted treasonable was brought...\n\nAnother 51 words (4 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Singley Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nSingley Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Singley is the 7,720th most popular surname with an estimated 2,487 people with that name. 5\n\nMigration of the Singley family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Singley family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 84 words (6 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nSingley migration to the United States +\n\nThousands of English families boarded ships sailing to the New World in the hope of escaping the unrest found in England at this time. Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries. The Singley were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records:\n\nSingley Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nMachael Singley, who landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1806 6\n\nMargaret Singley, who arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1806 6\n\nRosins Singley, who landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1806 6\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Singley (post 1700) +\n\nGreg Singley (b. 1950), An American Painter and a leading floral impressionist painter\n\nAlan Singley, American lead vocalist of the Alan Singley and Pants Machine, an Indie rock band\n\nJames Singley, American politician, Member of California State Assembly 11th District, 1855-56 7\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nMills, A.D., Dictionary of English Place-Names.
