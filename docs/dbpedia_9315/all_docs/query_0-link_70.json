        "text": "Citation preview\n\nHow to Read Architecture\n\nHow to Read Architecture is based on the fundamental premise that reading and interpreting architecture is something we already do, and that close observation matters. This book enhances this skill so that given an unfamiliar building, you will have the tools to understand it and to be inspired by it. Author Paulette Singley encourages you to misread, closely read, conventionally read, and unconventionally read architecture to stimulate your creative process. This book explores three essential ways to help you understand architecture: reading a building from the outside-in, from the inside-out, and from the position of out-and-out, or formal, architecture. This book erodes boundaries between the frequently compartmentalized fields of interior design, landscape design, and building design with chapters exploring concepts of terroir, scenography, criticality, atmosphere, tectonics, inhabitation, type, form, and enclosure. Using examples and case studies that span a wide range of historical and global precedents, Singley addresses the complex interaction among the ways a building engages its context, addresses its performative exigencies, and operates as an autonomous aesthetic object. Including over 300 images, this book is an essential read for both undergraduate and postgraduate students of architecture with a global focus on the interpretation of buildings in their context. Paulette Singley is a widely read architectural historian and theorist whose work expands the disciplinary limits of architecture across diverse subject matter such as food, film, and fashion. She is a Professor of Architecture at Woodbury University in Los Angeles, California. She received a Ph.D. from Princeton University, an M.A. from Cornell University, and a B.Arch. from the University of Southern California. She co-edited Eating Architecture, the first book to explore the intersections of architecture and the culinary arts. She also co-edited Architecture: In Fashion and has published chapters in several anthologies as well as essays in architecture journals such as Log and Assemblage.\n\nHow to Read Architecture An Introduction to Interpreting the Built Environment\n\nPAULETTE SINGLEY\n\nFirst published 2019 by Routledge 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017 and by Routledge 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN Routledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business © 2019 Taylor & Francis The right of Paulette Singley to be identified as author of this work has been asserted by her in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

He could only escape, in fact, by flying out of its vortex. Instead, it may be argued that Ariadne achieved the first work of architecture, since it was she who gave Theseus the ball of thread by means of which he found his way out of the labyrinth after having killed the Minotaur.1 —Beatriz Colomina Imagine you are standing in front of a building you previously have not seen. Without the aid of a guide book or other supplemental information, but equipped with your native ability to reason and a basic knowledge of the culture with which you are engaging, how would you begin to interpret, that is to say “read,” this work of architecture? Perhaps you would examine the way the building engages its site, study the configuration of interior spaces as they evidence themselves on exterior surfaces, or compare it to similar precedents you remember having seen. If the building you are reading is an ancient ruin or prehistoric monument, then you might adopt the perspective of an archaeologist and seek to identify primary site alignments or mentally reconstruct the edifice from remaining wall fragments. The seemingly dumb stone blocks from which a building was constructed may carry information that communicates architectural knowledge—the proximity of the quarry to the building site, chisel marks remaining from the extraction process, and more. To study an extant structure instead of a ruin, one might survey the ways in which the building responds to the nature of the site or consider its familial parallels to adjacent buildings. These techniques of observation, combined with an understanding of larger cultural forces such as socio-religious practices, contribute to an explication de texte of architecture. The title of Paul MacKendrick’s seminal work The Mute Stones Speak: The Story of Archaeology in Italy suggests that the key to unlocking architecture’s communicative value, no matter what language the builders spoke, remains embedded in the work itself, waiting for an interpreter to reveal its intrinsic mysteries.2 While it certainly helps, as the Rosetta Stone demonstrates, to\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nbe able to read inscriptions as an epigrapher does, the process of deciphering an archaeological site also relies on close observation that leads to extracting useful information from mute material. After years of excavating in the Valley of the Kings with little result, during his final season of digging in 1922, Howard Carter discovered a half-buried rock step. Excavation revealed a stairway leading down to a sealed door that opened onto a passage leading to King Tutankhamun’s tomb. A small piece of evidence and sharp eyes revealed one of the world’s greatest archaeological discoveries. Simple site surveying may indicate complex subterranean architectures waiting to be liberated by the archaeologist’s trowel. The density of plant growth on a contemporary farmer’s field may index subcutaneous patterns of inhabitation: either though lush vegetation growing over hidden canals or sparse growth over building foundations. Adding the technological advantage of aerial photography to the practice of visual observation, the reconnaissance John Bradford and Peter Williams Hunt completed while flying above the Tavoliere delle Puglie at the close of the Second World War exposed the presence of over 2000 subterranean settlements lying just under the surface of fields scarred by a light braille of vegetation growing out from otherwise hidden trenches. Their work brought to light the inhabitations of Neolithic farmers who dwelled on this plain over 7000 years ago. MacKendrick observed that the typical wattle and daub huts found here featured a sunken floor, central hearth, and smoke hole. This simple hut formed “the remote and primitive predecessor of the atrium-and-impluvium house of historic Roman times, whose central apartment has a hole in the roof with a pool below to catch rainwater.”3 MacKendrick drew an historical link from these prehistoric dwellings to the typical Roman house found in archaeological sites such as Pompeii and in so doing even implicated contemporary Mediterranean houses displaying courtyard fountains as part of this genetic lineage. Georges Perec reminds us that: “The earth is a form of writing, a geography of which we had forgotten that we ourselves are authors.”4 While hiking in foothills overlooking the Nazca Desert in southern Peru in 1927, Toribio Mejia Xesspe discovered a precise geography of secret writing, becoming the first archaeologist to observe a series of geoglyphs dating from approximately 500 BCE to 500 CE. Formed by shallow marks carved into the ground, the Nazca lines depict hundreds of abstract geometries and cyclopean drawings of natural figures such as hummingbirds, monkeys, jaguars, sharks, flowers, and trees. This site remains one of archaeology’s great enigmas, with theories about its meaning ranging from an astronomical observatory to a system of canals. The lines themselves, however, demonstrate the power of a humble incision in the ground to endure for thousands of years and to describe numinous spatial fields. The simple but important practice of close visual observation that Bradford and Hunt, Carter, and Xesspe illustrate remains our most effective tool for interpreting architecture. While more recent archaeological practices may deploy drones and photogrammetry to modernize the techniques of aerial site surveying—yielding significant knowledge about the\n\n2\n\nFigure 0.1 Photo by John Bradford with his caption reading: “APULIA.

Bell, 1957)\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 0.2 Diagram of a typical Pompeiian house, drawn by Gavin Friehauf\n\n4\n\npast without ever having to scratch a surface—the rule of close observation nonetheless holds. Stepping across the threshold of that imaginary edifice, you might consider studying the distribution of artifacts, clarity of circulation, sequential hierarchy of rooms, public-private interface, or exterior-interior adjacencies in order to interpret the spatial story lingering therein. Having momentarily adopted the archaeologist’s point of view for reading an historical ruin, other professional personas also provide useful interpretive tools for disencrypting architecture— the detective who seeks clues hiding in plain sight, the anthropologist who traces patterns of inhabitation across material culture, the psychologist who interprets the symbolic value of mythological objects, the engineer who is\n\nIntroduction\n\nfascinated by structural forces and failures, or the writer interested in attics, basements, and buried narratives. Each provides methodologies for the canny interpreter to shuttle between poetic and prosaic ways of reading architecture. A window, for example, may be subjected to diverse analytic perspectives; an artist might focus on natural light, a mechanical engineer on air movement, a general contractor on costs, a carpenter on framing, and an architect on proportions. These combined perspectives offer a toolkit for reading a building that may be triangulated between its response to context, performance, and abstract composition—three of the four parts in this book. The ability to read architecture—to interpret a building’s conceptual resonance—is something we do intuitively as part of our everyday lives as we negotiate the labyrinth of our built environments with the thread of legibility that personal experience provides. Throughout our day-to-day lives, we negotiate highly explicit yet often unspoken behavioral codes and navigational clues within architecture that rely on tacit reading skills. Taking the remote example of 12th–13th century Italian city-states, where supporters of the Pope or the Holy Roman Emperor fought fierce battles against each other, the fortresses defending these warring territories announced their respective political alignment as Guelph or Ghibelline through the architecture of rectangular or swallowtail-shaped battlements. More recent spatial territorialization may be determined by the defensive walls surrounding a gated community, graffiti tagging a neighborhood, or the threshold of a cultural institution across which it may be daunting to pass. Not only have we learned to read the role of architecture and how to comport ourselves accordingly therein, but also we generally know when we don’t belong. We generally know the difference, moreover, between what constitutes an ordinary building and a\n\nFigure 0.3 Aerial view of “The Hummingbird,” geoglyph from Nazca Desert in southern Peru (between 500 BCE and 500 CE), photograph by Diego Delso, courtesy of delso.photo.\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nbuilding whose set of representational systems designates it as carrying extraordinary formal significance—of a building that an architect is likely to have designed. That we have intuited such readings but have not necessarily articulated them is where this book enters the conversation concerning architecture’s ability to engage epistemological systems broader than simple use. Our understanding of the built environment may be enriched beyond these aforementioned soft readings into a self-conscious study that begins to provide a systematic approach to developing spatial literacy by reading architecture through its external, internal, and intrinsic pressures. Returning to the imaginary threshold you just crossed, this term resonates with the traditional practice of separating the threshing area adjacent to the exterior of a house from the interior living space. A divider between the inside and outside, the threshold often featured some kind of sill or lintel at the building’s entrance that also designated it as a liminal space of being neither inside nor out, but both. Liminal zones describe sites and rites of passage from one developmental stage to another and, as with thresholds and states of mind, a transitional space of neither here nor there, but both. The Latin root of lintel resides in limitaris, a term describing the borders and boundaries ancient Romans defined with limes, defensive lines and boundary limits etched into territories that may still be seen from the air. Liminal similarly describes the limits of a threshold condition. While architecture operates as defining boundaries between inside and outside and performs in response to these pressures, it also operates autonomously by sublimating (with its root of sublime stemming from sub “up to” + limen “lintel, threshold, sill”) context and use into the dynamics of form and space. In this respect, the analysis of form examines a building’s composition as a self-referential organization of mass, space, line, and color. Formal analysis, then, emerges as a way to read architecture as an autonomous spatial practice that adheres to the same aesthetic and compositional principles as do works of art isolated from the world behind the walls of a museum. This book provides a repertoire of approaches to interpreting architecture organized across a topological axis leading from external contexts to internal performances, an axis that isolates these very exigencies as independent from the processes of formal analysis in order to underscore formalism’s role. The limits between what constitutes architecture, the production of an enclosure that carries surplus meaning, and simple building, an enclosure whose purpose remains purely utilitarian, conventionally relies on the added and often ineffable aesthetic value an architect may bring to the design process. For Umberto Eco, an early theorist of architecture’s potential to communicate as a language, “architecture is the art of the articulation of form and spaces.”5 One difference between building and architecture resides in the necessity for architecture to deliver a message regarding its own compositional logic. Eco distinguished between building, “the construction of manufactured objects that circumscribe spaces set aside to foster practical functions (a\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nhen-house, a hangar, an ‘unsightly’ block of flats),” and architecture, spaces that permit practical functions but “are valued above all for their aesthetic autoreflectiveness.”6 As Sir John Summerson similarly insisted: “A bicycle shed is a building; Lincoln Cathedral is a piece of architecture. Nearly everything that encloses space on a scale sufficient for a human being to move in is a building; the term architecture applies only to buildings designed with a view to aesthetic appeal.”7 Roland Barthes synthesized these various distinctions when observing that “architecture is always dream and function, expression of a utopia and instrument of a convenience.”8 Despite the distinction between architecture and building, numerous built works merit inclusion in art and architectural history survey books that possess neither architectural pedigree nor a uniquely self-reflective design process, produced as they were through enduring cultural patterns of construction and inhabitation. James Ackerman describes the parallel process in Renaissance Italy as a “self-unconscious revival “ of classical architecture that was accompanied by the “unconscious survival” of building traditions “in which forms of art are handed down from generation to generation like myths, without evidence of their original sources.”9 In order to locate unconscious traditions on an equal footing with more canonical architecture, this book blurs any strong distinction between architecture and building at the level of the subjects selected to be discussed. Moreover, this distinction also underscores a subtle dynamic between high design and popular culture, where architecture conceived in the incubator of elite clientele or academic theory stands in stark contrast to buildings produced by commercial developers or amateur hands. This is not to undervalue the important work architects have completed in positively transforming our built environment, but to recognize that the architecture we inhabit on a daily basis is what we read, and reads us, most frequently. The process of interpretation necessarily relies on being able to read our built environment from numerous perspectives and at multiple scales. Given that buildings result from numerous influences and participants, reading architecture resides in an interpretive milieu that extends beyond a designer’s specific intentions. While social media expands awareness about architecture’s role in shaping our world, as well as fostering a cult of personality, it further demonstrates that the general public already possesses considerable tools for reading buildings. Perhaps the best example of this is documented in the animated sitcom The Simpsons. Episodes have depicted Frank Gehry as deriving his architectural inspiration from a crumpled piece of paper, showed Bart Simpson on the High Line in Manhattan, and inserted Rem Koolhaas into a world of Lego architecture—all instances of popular culture assimilating and parodizing capital “A” architecture for mass consumption. Operating from a more conceptual point of departure in his 1966 photo essay “Homes for America,” Dan Graham studied large-scale tract housing developments in New Jersey to arrive at the following dry observation: “When the box has a sharply oblique roof, it is called a ‘Cape Cod.’ When it is longer\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nthan wide, it is a ‘Ranch.’ A two-story house is usually called ‘Colonial.’ If it consists of contiguous boxes with one slightly higher in elevation, it is a ‘Splitlevel.’”10 Cape Cod, Ranch, Colonial, and Split-Level. As with real estate advertisements, these terms identify an architectural language shared in the “poetry of banality” Graham sees in these homes.11 He dwells, as Kirsten Swenson explains, “on the era’s depersonalized home, which no longer reflected individual tastes and needs but was built ‘to be thrown away.”‘12 As Graham argues, the predetermined, synthetic order of these housing developments lacks “organic unity connecting the land site and the home.”13 For Graham, these suburban enclaves transition into indeterminate transitional zones of bowling alleys, shopping plazas, big box stores, and a labyrinth of parking lots. Although Graham’s alienated New Jersey appears as a featureless land of in-betweeness, he also demonstrates the potential for navigating the anonymity and confusion of the commercial strip through the limes of highways. Perhaps most importantly, Graham reads his home state through ancient Roman terminology, common parlance, and simple observation. If, as Walter Benjamin wrote, “To live means to leave traces,” then to read a building requires paying attention to the way in which use-patterns imprint themselves upon spaces and surfaces.14 Quotidian inhabitation leaves legible traces on the surfaces of architecture—the wear and tear that everyday life inflicts on a building such as scuffmarks, mends, scratches, and stains. This patina of use that life imposes on buildings describes the ways in which architecture inflects to the demands of habitual use. When a chair rail or dado, stemming from Latin datum, projects from a wall, it protects the surface from the daily scraping of furniture at the height of a sitting body. The molding, in fact, indexes the memory of scratched surfaces and anticipates the bumping of chairs against the wall as people sit themselves to table. The dado molding simultaneously aids in the material transition between the lower level of a wall’s protective wainscoting and the upper level of more fragile wallpaper. The ever-purposeful Shakers placed a higher rail on the wall that they fitted with knobs for hanging furniture off of the floor when not being used. As the story of a simple chair rail attests, a building’s details and ornaments offer the potential to reveal big ideas condensed within small moments of design intensity—the proverbial world in a grain of sand. We inhabit many different architectures on a daily basis—from home, to work, to school, to places of worship—that augment the rote activities of life. We therefore have become expert at reading the traces of wear and the patterns of use which indicate an architecture’s ability both to absorb memories and to delineate a spatial plane across which we navigate. Reading architecture, deciphering a building’s conceptual apparatus, is an act we complete intuitively as part of everyday life, negotiated across connotative and denotative codes that structure the built environment. As we routinely inhabit buildings and the spaces in-between them, we negotiate an arbitrated system of signification that allows us to navigate the built environment. Our lived experiences have already taught us how to intuitively read architecture,\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhile cultural institutions such as heritage sites and museums round out the difference between instinct and insight. In general, finding a building’s bathroom is clearly indicated by architectural codes such as scale (smaller spaces), siting (hidden behind the scenes), symmetry (pairing of men’s and women’s rooms), and signage (graphics to assist with way finding). Likewise, proportion, materiality, and massing can suggest different uses, exemplified by schools scaled to the size of children, churches with bell towers, or prisons with small windows. When radical experimentation overthrows these established conventions, normative forces such as gravity, materiality, and public circulation remain ways in which to begin navigating these uncharted territories until they too become absorbed into our architectural unconscious. Fredric Jameson develops the concept of cognitive maps, the mental compasses and cartographies of a built environment we produce internally to navigate our worlds. Basing himself on Kevin Lynch’s important book The Image of the City (1960), Jameson argues that cities have become alienated spaces where people are able neither to navigate cognitively nor to locate the invisible power structures. Jameson echoes Graham when observing that places like Jersey City, where it is challenging to find the traditional navigational markers such as monuments, nodes, and natural boundaries, intensify this alienation.15 Even the most abject of cities and suburbs maintain a semblance of cartographic legibility enough for inhabitants to negotiate socio-political systems of power inscribed in the monuments and public spaces that compose these worlds. Were it not for the experience of everyday life providing the basic tools with which to navigate public space and interpret built form, it would be impossible to perform an act as simple as going to work or purchasing groceries. To progress from intuitively navigating architecture and urban space as a system of invisible ideological maps that define one’s subjectivity to intentionally unraveling architecture’s theoretical underpinnings by learning how to read with greater precision makes room for taking ownership of the spaces we inhabit and for drawing our own maps. Interpreting a space’s light, detail, color, texture, sound, and views involves experiential observation that only an actual site visit may elicit. In the absence of this opportunity, we rely on published descriptions, drawings, photography, and film to embroider the lack of physical experience with memories of similar spaces. These various strategies for reading architecture both align with and disregard the architect’s own design intentions which often are shaped unconsciously by larger forces flowing through a stream of technological innovation or blowing in the wind of a stylistic zeitgeist. The architect’s agency and authorship of her design persists in reciprocity with the unintended influence of cultural contaminants and a global force majeure. Likewise, architecture emerges from a highly collaborative process wherein multiple individuals contribute to the completion of a collective work that ultimately results in a built form much larger than the work of a single person. Buildings therefore reside in an interpretive milieu in which the architect’s singular, heroic voice may be\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\ndisplaced by sequential interpretations, translations, and observations that emerge independently from and even transform the valence of any original design intentions. If not solely derived from the architect’s intentions, which may or may not explicate a building’s conceptual trajectory, then examining a building in response to its external contexts and internal performances liberates interpretation from rote intentionality. Moreover, evaluating a building’s abstract compositional relationships independent of both external and internal forces describes the epistemological system for interpreting the built environment that outlines Reading Architecture’s organizational strategy. Divided into four parts of (1) Reading Between the Lines, (2) Outside-In Architecture, (3) Inside-Out Architecture, and (4) Out-and-Out Architecture, the complex interaction among the ways in which a building engages its context, addresses its performative exigencies, and operates as an autonomous aesthetic object offers a comprehensive approach to interpreting the built domain, one that unites the increasingly distinct practices of landscape, interior, and building design into a holistic appreciation of what constitutes architecture. This book focuses on built works whose siting, response to nature, cultural context, environmental systems, tectonic exigencies, and overall form constitute narrative devices leading to the expository process of architectural story telling. According to the architect Aldo van Eyck: “What you should try to accomplish is built meaning. So get close to the meaning and build.”16 Adopting a broad approach to considering a wide range of historical and geographical subjects, this book considers the study of architecture through the ways in which it produces cultural meaning, through a combination of historical, theoretical, and material investigations that contribute to making our built environment legible. How to Read Architecture, as this title signals, adopts the position that architecture’s primary role is as a cultural communicator, one which evidences systems of legibility that may be interpreted through myriad modes of expression we negotiate on a daily basis in states of distraction or in moments of concentrated attention. It also provides tools for turning buildings outside in and inside out as a way of bracketing the space in-between as a formal zone autonomous from exigency. This book privileges the idea that architecture draws from a complex and oscillating field of inquiry that engages a plurality of voices in a multicultural context. Above all, it asserts that architecture’s legibility engages a formal system of representation that encompasses and absorbs its functional performance. It aims to offer its readers a conceptual apparatus for interpreting the built environment that, in turn, augments their confidence in assessing a building’s merit, even in opposition to conventional architectural criticism. The building you entered at the beginning of this chapter and the twists and turns you have crossed to arrive at the end introduces a labyrinth of thresholds for which the following chapters operate as Ariadne’s ball of thread, as a navigational tool for reading architecture.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nNotes 1 2 3 4 5\n\n6 7 8 9\n\n10 11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15 16\n\nArchitectureproduction, eds.

And the images they offer to our senses must excite in us sentiments analogous to the functions to which the buildings are devoted.1 —Étienne-Louis Boullée Architect and architectural theorist Marco Frascari unequivocally asserted that “buildings are texts which are generated by assembling three-dimensional mosaics of fragments, excerpts, citations, passages, and quotations.”2 While the conceptual parallel between buildings and writing dates back at least to the late eighteenth century, when Étienne-Louis Boullée articulated his analogy between architecture and poetry, the linguistic turn rekindled toward the end of the 1960s inaugurated a system for interpreting architecture according to the rules of language and semiotics. “Linguistics, semiotics, rhetoric, and various models of ‘textuality’” as W. J. T. Mitchell observed in 1994 “had become the lingua franca for critical reflections on the arts, the media, and cultural forms.”3 Lebbeus Woods perfectly summarized the search for meaning at this time when explaining that the grammar and syntax of written language were believed to organize a coherent and meaningful system that clearly related to architecture. As Woods put it, by the 1970s and 1980s, linguistic and literary theorists concluded “that written texts do not have a fixed meaning established by what its author intended to say, but rather multiple meanings that\n\n13\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nreaders have to interpret for themselves by using various cultural codes and references.”4 In other words, while architecture could be read as a cultural text, the actual meaning of that text was fluid. Meaning therefore paradoxically was evacuated from both architecture and the architect’s intentions, with the end result for Woods being that “form does not follow any a priori function but has autonomous existence that must, in the end, be ‘read’ on its own terms.”5 As Woods concluded, “the meaning of architecture is to be found only in architecture itself.”6 The comparison between books and buildings that promised to vitalize architecture as a potentially legible enterprise rebounded into an alibi for evacuating meaning from form and thereby further rarefying its interpretive capacity for an elite audience indoctrinated in its abstruse jargon. The linguistic cure had become literary poison. In this section the linguistic turn operates as both an historical moment suspended in amber and a contemporary approach to the reading of architecture that begins on the surfaces of buildings featuring supplementary textual content. Chapter 1 approaches engraving as a process of carving into a building’s surface that carries gravitas, as in a grave or serious meaning, where architecture operates as communicator of cultural meaning through its originary status in burial. From signage as contemporary inscription to signs as linguistic tools to scripting as autonomous design, Chapter 2 considers architecture as a process of inscription. It considers the ways in which daily life and roadside attractions inscribe themselves on architecture, often in contradistinction to a designer’s will. Both chapters explore the enduring quarrel between buildings and books.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2 3\n\n4 5 6\n\n14\n\nEtienne-Louis Boullée Boullée’s Treatise on Architecture & Complete Presentation of the “Architecture Essas sur l’art” which forms part of the Boullée papers (Ms. 9153) in the Bibliothèque Nationale Paris (London: Tiranti, 1953), p. 26.

Ibid.\n\nChapter 1\n\nEngraving\n\nThe circle, the square, are the letters of the alphabet used by the architects for the structures of their best works.1 —Claude Nicolas Ledoux Long before books were printed and the Internet established worldwide connectivity, architecture was the most accessible and durable form of public media. Architecture emerged as a conduit of cultural expression whose greater function had been to frame rituals, consecrate sites, suspend thresholds between sacred and profane zones, and articulate these spatial performances in conjunction with meaning written on and by its material surfaces. If past civilizations combined inscriptions, symbolic images, and sculptural groups on building surfaces as allegorical programs to expand legibility to less literate audiences, then the complementary presence of words and symbols on today’s architecture remains the most direct means of ascertaining a building’s purpose. In short, focusing on the words, signs, symbols, and emblems appended to a building offers a good place to start to read architecture. While neon lights and digital screens may substitute for words carved in stone, studying the signs and symbols of these more recent contributions to writing on buildings merits the same close attention epigraphists apply to deciphering ancient inscriptions. Inscriptions and their contemporary counterpart of signage may directly or indirectly identify a building or monument’s purpose, construction period, patron, architect, historical context, or poetic aspirations. When it comes to reading architecture, then the first place to start is by seeking out any words, epigraphs, icons, numbers, or symbols that may be appended to it. Emblematic of the space that writing occupies in ancient architecture, the great hypostyle hall of Amun-Re at Karnak in Egypt features inscriptions, cartouches, and bas-relief sculpture on every surface. Built during the time of Sety I (reigned 1294–1279 BCE) and his son Ramesses II (reigned 1279–1213 BCE), the hall’s dense intercolumniation represents a primordial papyrus thicket, while its relief carvings illustrate historical and religious stories. This petrified forest contains 12 giant columns in the central space, or nave, standing at about 70 feet tall and 10 feet wide, and 122 columns at the lower side\n\n15\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nFigure 1.1 Diagram of a typical Egyptian temple, drawn by Gavin Friehauf\n\n16\n\naisles standing at about 33 feet tall. The hall’s surfaces depict the daily rituals priests conducted in the temple sanctuary. The sanctuary was the house of the deity, the final and lowest room in the temple’s processional route that led from an entrance pylon to a peristyle court to a hypostyle hall to the final naos or central shrine. Papyrus column capitals, with open blossoms in the nave and closed buds on the flanking aisles, represent the mythological marsh of creation and the fertile Nile flood plain from out of which they grew. The entire hall operates at multiple levels and scales of legibility: as a shelter for religious practices, an edifice that depicts the rituals it instantiates, a primordial grove, and the deity’s domicile. Painted in bright colors, bas-relief sculpture depicts temple rituals and augments the hieroglyphic inscriptions of sacred rites so that even an illiterate public would have been able to glean the message of scenes such as the pharaoh being crowned with a diadem, sacrifices to Amun-Re, or the procession of annual festivals. These engraved surfaces also depict the foundation rites of the temple itself, including such tasks as surveying, designating a sacred boundary, and molding a brick. In temples such as those at Karnak, extensive textual references and ornamental programs transform the building into a guidebook of itself, where deep ritual mysteries are carved on stone pages. Hieroglyphs mythologize the origins of writing, a gift that liberated people from the burden of having to preserve stories through memorization. This gift, however, was paradoxical. Writing in Phaedrus, Plato described the discovery\n\nFigure 1.2 Transverse section of the Great Hypostyle Hall from the Precinct of Amun-Re in the Karnak Temple Complex at Thebes. From Description de l’Égypte: ou, Recueil des observations et des recherches qui ont été faites en Égypte pendant l’expédition de l’armée française publié par les ordres de Sa Majesté l’empereur Napoléon le Grand (Paris: Imprimerie impériale, 1809–1828)\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 1.3 Ramesses II molding a mud brick before Amun-Re using a wooden mold, a ritual similar to laying the cornerstone of a building ceremonies, from the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak.

According to Egyptian legend, the god Theuth (Thoth) developed the art of letters among his other inventions of arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. The Egyptian King Thamus replied to this offering with circumspection, arguing that “this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.”2 A prescription to save memory, inscription transforms the surfaces of architecture—an art form whose endurance uniquely ties to the ars memoriae or memory arts—into permanent historical records, and indeed into books. But, in this poison–cure dynamic the pharmacological tensions between inscription, prescription, architecture, writing, forgetting, and remembering also identify a fundamental rivalry between words and buildings. Does writing render buildings into mere surfaces awaiting inscriptions or does architecture’s monumentality dwarf the words inscribed on its walls? For John Ruskin, a 19th-century architectural critic: “It is as the centralization and protectress of this sacred influence, that Architecture is to be regarded by us with the most serious thought. We may live without her, and worship without her, but we cannot remember without her.”3 Trajan’s Column, a commemorative columna cochlis in Rome dating from 113 CE, offers a case in point to demonstrate this rivalry. It is a marker that depicts sequential sculptural groups of the emperor’s two victories over the Dacians on a narrative frieze spiraling from the base to the capital of its cylindrical shaft. While the direct content of this spiral book is that of Trajan’s defeat of barbarians at the borders and the expansion of empire, the collateral text is a highly illustrated story of the Roman war machine, from the building of bridges or fortifications to styles of armor and weaponry. At its upper-most edge, the continuous narrative stops to reveal 24 flutes of the Doric order, as if\n\n18\n\nEngraving\n\npeeping out from under a story-board, positioning the entire work as an ancient scroll or book covering an existing stone column. Further delineating the column as an ancient Roman book standing within Trajan’s monumental complex, its siting between Greek and Latin libraries would have allowed curious readers to begin at ground level and then continue reading at the level of second-floor balconies projecting from these buildings. Indicating the column’s narrative function as superseding that of enclosure, its interior volume occupies the narrow shaft of space for a spiral staircase that wends its way from the bottom entrance to the top of a viewing platform like a corkscrew. The column also serves as an urban marker establishing an elevated position from which it is possible to survey the city, telling a story of power as monumental as the narrative of battle campaigns. Standing at 125 feet tall, the column indexes the prodigious engineering feat of having removed a saddle-shaped piece of land that attached the Capitoline and the Quirinal hills, a geophysical transformation that permanently transformed Rome’s topography, in order to make room for Trajan’s forum and market. The pedestal, which contains a chamber to house the golden funerary urns of Trajan and his wife Plotina, features inscriptions that explain the column as having been built “to demonstrate how lofty a hill and (what area of) ground was carried away for these mighty works.”4 By providing important textual evidence about the way in which it marks a dramatic change to Rome’s topography, the inscription becomes the primary alibi for constructing the column as a marker that documents Trajan’s engineering prowess. Commemorative columns and triumphal arches, imagined in their original state of extreme polychrome and sparkling bronze letters, served as giant billboards with narrative sculptural groups enacting historical events to a semi-literate public. Where Trajan’s Column describes a condition of minimal spatial enclosure, the triumphal arch or fornix slightly expands the potential for inhabitation by creating a shelter from the elements under its arches and hiding a secret room in its attic story. Dating from 203 CE, the arch of Septimius Severus commemorates the emperor’s victories over the Parthians and the Osroeni. It served as a threshold along the Via Sacra (Sacred Way), a celebratory pathway leading through the Roman Forum that delineated a general’s triumphal procession through the city. This arch and others like it established a formal strategy for Renaissance architects to apply a classically inspired façade to a Christian basilica section. It also developed a model for the separation of vehicular and pedestrian pathways by providing a large central opening for chariots or wagons and two smaller flanking arches scaled to people. After Severus died, his son Caracalla organized the assassination of his brother Geta, thereafter\n\nFigure 1.4 Giovanni Battista Piranesi, section through Trajan’s Column, from Trofeo o sia magnifica colonna coclide di marmo composta di grossi macigni ove si veggono scopite le due guerre daciche fatte da Traiano (1775–1776)\n\n19\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 1.5 Giovanni Battista Piranesi, View of the Arch of Septimius Severus from Vedute di Roma (1740)\n\nissuing an order of damnatio memoriae commanding that all mention of Geta be removed from public view. It is possible to identify this act of erasing Geta from memory on the arch because archaeologists connected the dots of the holes drilled into the marble to attach the bronze letters Caracalla had had removed, which originally read P. Septimio L. fil Getae nobilissi(mo), the most noble son of Lucius Septimius, Publius Septimius Geta. The Arch of Septimius Severus describes the military history of the empire as well as a story that turns on Rome’s foundational mythology of Romulus killing his brother Remus to become the sole ruler of the newly formed city. As the story of this arch demonstrates, inscriptions, sculptural groups, bas reliefs, wall paintings, petroglyphs, graffiti, signage, and more operate as an architectural metalanguage that floats above a building’s structural and spatial imperatives, allowing the reader to move laterally from denotative words to connotative ideas such as power, fratricide, and ritual that the arch frames. Carved surfaces maintain the power to evoke architecture’s conceptual underpinnings as they problematize the status of its primary role to provide shelter with larger representational concepts such as burial and remembrance. When contemplating architecture’s essential role in marking the place of death, architect Adolf Loos wrote in 1910: “If we were to come across a mound in the woods, six foot long by three foot wide, with the soil piled up in a pyramid, a somber mood would come over us and a voice inside us would say, ‘There is someone buried here.’ That is architecture.”5 Writing in his Essays Upon Epitaphs (1810), William Wordsworth further problematizes the relationship between monument and text, arguing that: “It needs scarcely be said, that an Epitaph presupposes a Monument, upon which it is to be engraven.”6 As the epitaph conjures the monument, so too writing anticipates architecture.\n\n20\n\nEngraving\n\nBut this argument could be reversed. A headstone without an inscription lacks an identity but not necessarily its meaning as a marker of burial, while an inscription without a surface destination may float in ether. Although How to Read Architecture focuses on the built domain, no publication on this subject would be complete without at least some mention of Giuseppe Terragni’s Danteum, designed in 1938 for a site on Benito Mussolini’s newly constructed Via dell’Impero in the heart of Rome. The Danteum was to be a memorial and study center for Dante Alighieri, author of the Divine Comedy (1320) and of the modern Italian language. Terragni translated the three sections of Dante’s hell, heaven, and purgatory into a series of sequential rooms that explicitly reference the spatial quality of these spaces as Dante described them. Terragni also used inscriptions and mathematical proportioning systems to reference both the words and the organization of Dante’s masterpiece. He marshaled words, space, form, and building material to arrive at a design that translated Dante’s poem into a work of architecture. As Terragni wrote of this project: “The spiritual reference and direct dependence upon the first canto of the Poem must be expressed in unmistakable signs by an atmosphere that influences the visitor and appears physically to weigh upon his mortal person, so that he is moved to experience the ‘trip’ as Dante did.”7 To return to the world of built work, if providing shelter is one of architecture’s essential roles, then marking and memorializing space is another. Inscriptions remain as relevant to the construction of contemporary buildings as they were to ancient ones, articulating tensions between architecture’s role as an abstract form-giver and as a conveyor of symbolic content. Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial exceeds the role of serving as a mere destination for carving the names of deceased veterans to emerge as sacred architecture in and of its own right. Here architecture and engraving remain inseparable from the stone upon which they cleave. As a silent space that speaks volumes, little more than a submerged wall, visitors descend into the ground of interment, contemplate their own image reflected in the polished black granite, and tactilely probe a carved letter that summons an absent body through their fingers. The V-shaped incision the memorial cuts into the earth, with one angle pointing toward the Lincoln Memorial and the other toward the Washington Monument, cuts a wound in the landscape rather than building a conventional work of architecture. As one walks down into the subterranean valley, the linguistic homology between grave and engraving fuses into the space of an incision—both on the ground and in the stone. The carvings, sculptural groups, and ornamental programs that supplement edifices with larger informational systems, commonly referred to as iconography, draw upon the applied and decorative arts to produce architectural meaning. In his Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi (Iconography; or, A Description of Universal Images Derived from Antiquity and Other Sources, 1593), Cesare Ripa codified a number of emblems, personifications of concepts such as wisdom, whom he depicts as holding an open book and carrying and illuminating torch.\n\n21\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 1.6 Perspective views from Maya Lin’s original design submission for the Vietnam War Memorial (1981) from the Library of Congress, American Treasures exhibit\n\nThe numerous paintings and sculptural installations covering the surfaces of Baroque architecture with emblems and iconographical programs, such as those Ripa outlined, tell stories through a symbolic language of socially contracted allegories. Indeed, the use of iconographic programs to communicate sacred stories or dynastic authority has been a dominant mode through which architecture has been read for centuries around the world.\n\n22\n\nEngraving Figure 1.7 Cesare Ripa, “Wisdom” or “Sapienza,” from Cesare Ripa, “Sapienza,” Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi (1611 edition)\n\nAlthough illicit, graffiti is an important form of architectural media. Stemming from the ancient Greek graphein—meaning to scratch, draw, or write—graffiti is as old as architecture itself. Speaking through his alter-ego of Claude Frollo, the reverend archdeacon of Notre Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris). Victor Hugo fictionalized a piece of graffiti scratched into the wall of one of the towers. “Black with age, and quite deeply graven in the stone,” as Hugo described it, Frollo discovered the word ἈΝΆΓΚΗ, meaning fatality.8 Narrating this event in his 19th-century novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hugo demoted architecture from its role as public media when causing Frollo to utter what perhaps has become the most poignant words ever spoken about architecture: “ceci tuera cela” or “this will kill that.”9 The book will kill the edifice. In part, Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre Dame, to draw attention to the church’s condition of neglect and to argue for the value of Gothic architecture that had fallen out of style at that time. And yes, this written phrase transferred the dominant vehicle for the dissemination of cultural knowledge from buildings to books. Johannes Gutenberg’s introduction of moveable type printing to Europe in the 15th century saw to it that biblical accounts no longer required translation into the stone carvings and stained glass windows of gothic cathedrals such as Notre Dame. Those rare and inaccessible illuminated manuscripts that had been passed down one tome at a time to be painstakingly copied by hand onto precious papers and stored in remote libraries eventually became mass-produced volumes placed directly in the hands of\n\n23\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nthe laity. Until the invention of the printing press, architecture was the most accessible communicative medium through which a culture expressed itself, not only by translating biblical lessons into the legible pictographs of stained glass windows and carved stone, but also as a record of the society that produced these structures. For a medieval village dwelling in the shadow of its great cathedral, the structure represented generations of builders, radical new building technologies, effigies of people who modeled for portraits, and, perhaps most importantly, the public spaces within and without the church where the town would gather in communion to celebrate sacraments such as matrimony, baptism, and burial. Gothic cathedrals such as Notre Dame, built from 1163 to 1345, exemplify a building’s ability to communicate through several forms of architectural writing. Ranging from more abstract concepts of god demonstrated through the components of light, symmetry, and proportion, to the daily rituals of monastic life, to precise semblances of writing such as didactic art programs, sarcophagi, inscriptions, or consecration dates, the cathedral absorbed, reflected, and transformed the world through its constructed words. During the gothic period, according to Hugo, architecture conveyed a deep cultural significance that it would never again possess. So great was the loss of this role that architecture’s ontological foundation as a conveyer of meaning would cease to exist and die. The story less often told regarding Hugo’s proclamation of architecture’s death is that Gutenberg breathed new life into architecture through the book’s ability to disseminate, theorize, and ultimately develop an entire profession that heretofore possessed little formal training or epistemological rigor. In this respect, the book “built” the building by codifying a disciplinary lexicon for spatial literacy and a systematic theoretical approach to design. Throughout the Middle Ages and prior to Gutenberg, architectural knowledge primarily passed from generation to generation through the transcription of important texts, apprenticeships with master craftsmen, trial and error, and the vast amounts of knowledge buildings themselves held in reserve. Gutenberg’s press led to the definition of architecture as a specific term and profession. On the contrary, as Lewis Mumford countered, “the real misdemeanor of the printing-press was not that it took literary values away from architecture, but that it caused architecture to derive its value from literature.”10 The centuries separating the building of Notre Dame from Leon Battista Alberti’s publication of De re aedificatoria (On the Art of Building, 1443–1452) witnessed the emergence of architectural theory and pedagogy, the printing of books, and the discovery of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio’s 1st-century treatise De architectura (The Ten Books on Architecture). The printing press that Hugo blamed for the destruction of architectural meaning helped to disseminate Alberti’s Renaissance publication, the essential text for having elevated architecture to the systematic theorization of a fine art. Embedded in the very title of De re aedificatoria is an understanding that architecture’s cultural role is to transcend shelter with meaning. Taken from its Latin root of ædificare, which\n\n24\n\nEngraving\n\ntranslates as “to build or construct” and to “improve spiritually or instruct,” this double meaning conveys the idea that the edifice may edify us. Architecture’s primary role as a conveyor of meaning, in this sense, assigns buildings with the responsibility of representation, of teaching society how to read the alphabet, words, and stories it may express. The printing press disseminated the words and images of architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, Sebastiano Serlio, Claude Perrault, Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremère de Quincy, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Étienne-Louis Boullée, Gottfried Semper, and Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-leDuc, and more recently of Le Corbusier, Robert Venturi, and Rem Koolhaas— authors whose writings translate building traditions into published theoretical treatises. In particular reference to the affinity between books and buildings, the printing press allowed for the publication of Ledoux’s Architecture considérée sous le rapport de l’art, des moeurs et de la legislation (Architecture Considered in Relation to Art, Morals, and Legislation, 1804). In this treatise Ledoux published designs for the buildings he intended to populate Chaux, an ideal city he conceived as the second half of the semi-circular plan he designed for the Royal Saltworks constructed at Arc-et-Senans, France. He proposed a series of suburban pavilions for Chaux that explore architecture’s symbolic alphabet of primary shapes. For the house and workshop of the barrel makers, he shaped the façades with interpenetrating concentric circles pierced by cylinders. The key to unlocking this architectural rebus resided in the reader’s ability to connect the dots between the metal hoops binding a barrel’s staves and the house’s circular geometry. Architecture parlante, translated literally as “speaking architecture,” is a French academic term that emerged in response to Ledoux’s work. Architecture parlante identifies the potential for architecture to communicate its purpose through external symbolism.\n\nFigure 1.8 Claude Nicolas Ledoux, House and Workshop of the Coopers, from L’architecture considérée sous le rapport de l’art, des mœurs et de la législation, vol. 1 (1804)\n\n25\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 1.9 Claude Nicolas Ledoux, House of the Agricultural Guard, from L’architecture considérée sous le rapport de l’art, des mœurs et de la legislation, vol. 1 (1804)\n\nRecourse to designing architecture as an expression of its conceptual purpose gave architects license to do away with the imitation of ancient classical canons. Ledoux’s House of the Agricultural Guard, shaped as a perfect sphere, illustrates the magnitude of this shift in perception that divided those architects who followed the ancients and those who elected to become modern. A metaphorical seed or pure platonic solid, this pavilion appears to have landed from another planet, so extremely radical is its form in comparison to anything preceding it. Modern architecture was born with the explosion of classical architecture this very seed disseminated when planted in the 18th-century garden of political revolution. Even if the shape of this sphere contradicted any reasonable use, the ruptured authority of the classical orders that architecture parlante inaugurated contributed to a quarrel among the ancients and the moderns that resulted in protracted research into architecture’s uniquely performative and/or representational, rather than imitative, role. In terms of built work that exemplifies architecture parlante, Ledoux’s plan for the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans demonstrates salt’s vital role in food preservation that elevated its status to a precious commodity. As the French government sought to regulate the salt economy through the imposition of taxes and the construction of salt works, it required systems of control and surveillance that the placement of the Director’s house in the center of Ledoux’s semi-circle and the gated threshold guarding the entrance make clear. Ledoux rendered the entrance as a giant salt grotto and located stone portals at the base of the building from out of which salt brine has been petrified into a permanent state of leakage. In this example, architecture’s expressive potential relies as much on the building’s overall form as it does the kind of salient details the Royal Salt Works at Chaux exhibits.\n\n26\n\nEngraving Figure 1.10 Detail of salt brine exuding from out of the entrance to the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans (Chaux, 1774–1779) by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux\n\nFigure 1.11 Automotive details on William Van Alen’s Chrysler Building (New York City, 1928–1930), photograph by Norbert Nagel\n\n27\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 1.12 Capitol Records Headquarters by Louis Naidorf of Welton Becket Associates, courtesy of the Marc WanamakerBison Archives of Hollywood Historic Photos. com\n\nFigure 1.13 Eliot Noyes’s Aerospace Research Center for IBM (now Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles, 1964).

Not only was William van Alen’s Chrysler Building in New York (1929) the world’s tallest building in the world at the time it was completed, but also the “gargoyles” on the corners of the 61st floor were over-scaled replicas of the 1929 Chrysler Deluxe Roadster hood ornament. Welton Beckett’s Capitol Records Headquarters in Hollywood, California (1956) is a 13-story cylindrical tower whose asymmetrical spire evokes the image of a turntable needle playing on a stack of records. Now the main building on Otis College of Art and Design’s campus, Eliot Noyes’s Aerospace Research Center for IBM (1963) in Los Angeles, California reflects the company’s products with façades that look like computer punch cards. The four L-shaped buildings forming Dominique Perrault’s National Library of France (Paris, 1995), bracket the corners of an open plaza as a vertical tower that easily read as open books. PTW Architects’ Water Cube, the aquatic center for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, features an exterior envelop based on a three-dimensional geometry that represents foam bubbles. While they indicate a building’s purpose but not necessarily its function, these projects do begin to suggest the way in which form follows figure. While these projects make clear that the production of contemporary architecture finds antecedents in eighteenth-century architectural theory, the challenge remains for architects to elevate them from the more prosaic roadside architecture of the 1920s and 1930s, where hot dogs were sold from buildings shaped like buns and ducklings were sold from buildings shaped like ducks, a paradigm that the following chapter explores.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2\n\n3 4\n\n5 6\n\n30\n\nLedoux writes “Le cercle, le carré, voilà les lettres alphabetiques que les auteurs emploient dans la texture des meilleurs ouvrage.” C.

By 1981, when Ada Louise Huxtable visited Pessac, a number of tenants had modified the original structures according to their own designs with additions and remodelings substantial enough to have supposedly spoiled the original architecture.2 And yet, these presumed violations of Corbusier’s original work evidence the pliability of his designs to adapt to the particular needs of individual people. In developing her argument in favor of the project’s ability to accommodate change, Huxtable referenced Philippe Boudon’s study Lived-in Architecture, Le Corbusier’s Pessac Revisited (1972) showing “photographs of garage doors where there once were open entrances, small, shuttered windows replacing large expanses of glass, tile roofs and endearing touches of kitsch.”3 Upon entering one of the row houses, Huxtable encountered “flowered wallpaper, overstuffed furniture, and the accessories of a comfortable bourgeois life style.” Instead of “the architect’s will imposed,” as Huxtable narrated, “the then-radical open plan could be reorganized and subdivided in many ways; a terrace could be roofed over for an extra room; windows of one’s choice could be fitted into the large openings without knocking out a wall.”4 Architectural sensibilities seem to have changed enough since Huxtable found the need to defend the inhabitants’ transformation of their property at the expense of the architect’s control, to the extent that Alejandro Aravena built into his design of the Incremental Houses Complex in Iquique, Chile (2004) the ability for the tenants to transform and expand their homes. In an earlier essay about the necessity of architects to consider the everyday needs of their inhabitants entitled “Learning from Pop” (1971), Denise\n\n32\n\nInscription\n\nScott Brown asked: “If high-style architects are not producing what people want or need, who is, and what can we learn from them?”5 Through their built work and theoretical treatises, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown taught generations of architects to read ordinary houses and roadside attractions as offering valuable insight to the design of the built environment. In so doing they updated the ancient art of inscribing words upon stone with modes of communication delivered by the electric light of commercial signage. They offered a significant contribution to the transformation of architecture from modernism’s functionalist doctrine to a stylistic trend that came to be termed post-modernism, a return to expressing architecture’s representational or communicative potential, often implemented through eclectic stylistic references to various historical time periods. In Signs of Life: Symbols in the American City, a 1976 exhibition at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution, Venturi and Scott Brown depicted the three topological sites of home, commercial strip, and street with full-scale installations of these environments accompanied by large panels depicting photographs highlighted with explanatory thought balloons. They analyzed important iconography of American architecture at that time and studied the ordinary homes and the extraordinary features of the commercial strip. The exhibition highlighted middle-class aspirations for colonial shutters, Cape Cod shingles, and Currier and Ives motifs as well as objects from popular culture, furniture from everyday life, and the exterior symbolism of the suburban landscape. Citing Dan Graham’s 1966 photo essay Homes for America as an important influence on their research into the architecture of everyday life, they identified the pervasive tropes or metaphorical themes that allow the lay public to read architecture. Among Venturi and Scott Brown’s many influences, other artists including Andy Warhol and Richard Hamilton introduced the genre of Pop Art to the discussion. Hamilton created a collage for the Independent Group’s 1956 exhibition catalogue This is Tomorrow entitled “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?”, which depicts a scantily dressed couple inside a domestic interior filled with the paraphernalia of consumer goods and a giant Tootsie Pop stick candy that purportedly gave rise to the nomenclature of “POP” architecture.\n\nFigure 2.1 Alejandro Aravena, Incremental Houses Complex in Iquique, Chile (2004), courtesy of Alejandro Arevena: Ludovic Dusuzeau\n\n33\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nFigure 2.2 Signs of Life: Symbols in the American City, Renwick Gallery (1976), courtesy of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc.\n\n34\n\nFrom triumphal to golden arches, in 1968 Venturi and Scott Brown took their research on the road and traveled with a group of architecture students from Yale University to study the Las Vegas Strip, a trip that ultimately resulted in the provocative publication Learning from Las Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form (1972). They iconoclastically compared Rome’s ancient monuments with the Las Vegas strip, Nevada’s version of the Forum Romanum. They argued that the advertising billboard of capitalist production parallels the triumphal arch of imperial rule and the “Las Vegas is to the Strip what Rome is to the Piazza.”6 Along with their comparative analysis of\n\nInscription Figure 2.3 Richard Hamilton, “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?” from This is Tomorrow (1956)\n\nLas Vegas architecture, Venturi and Scott Brown produced a genealogy of buildings whose broad façades operate as informational signage, including Amiens Cathedral, the pylon of an Egyptian temple, a highway billboard, an electric sign in front of the Stardust Hotel, and an ancient Roman triumphal arch. Possibly the most useful provocation in this publication is Venturi and Scott Brown’s distinction between a building that is a “duck” and one that is a “decorated shed.” The duck and decorated shed emerge as an influential set of paradigms for identifying the different ways in which a building may communicate to the general public while simultaneously challenging modern architecture with ironic examples of its own tenets. In a straightforward interpretation of this dichotomy, the duck transmits meaning as an inhabitable sculpture that reflects its contents—as with the building in Suffolk County, New York that sells ducks and is shaped like a duck—while the shed relies on signage to communicate the purpose of what would otherwise remain a generic and utilitarian structure. A more nuanced interpretation of the decorated shed, as Deborah Fausch offers, is to understand it as a case in which a building’s expression of function may be detached from its form, a comment on modern architecture’s organic approach to laminating interior and exterior functions upon each other.\n\n35\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 2.4 The “duck” and the “decorated shed” from Learning from Las Vegas: These Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form (1972), courtesy of Venturi Scott Brown and Associates, Inc.\n\nAs Fausch continues, for Venturi and Scott Brown, “the decorated shed was an expression of structure and function: the structure was separated from the function of communication.” The duck, as she continues, operates as a combination of “sculptural symbol and architectural shelter,” in contrast to the false front of old west, Cowboy-type main streets that the shed implies.7 Equally, the duck is as much of a decoy of architecture parlante within a context of wit and humor as it is an assessment of architecture’s sculptural expression. Both in their design practice and published theories, Venturi and Scott Brown remained committed to engaging architecture through media to the extent that they risked reducing buildings to signs. Take their BASCO showroom in northeast Philadelphia from 1976 as a radical example of this trajectory. When asked to increase the visibility of a 16-foot high by 1,100-foot long showroom for a catalog department store, the architects responded with five 34-foot-tall aluminum sheathed capital letters spelling out BASCO that they placed in front of the building. Their polemic of placing building and signage on an equal footing undermines architecture’s formal capacity in favor of its\n\n36\n\nInscription Figure 2.5 Showroom and Warehouse, BASCO Inc., Philadelphia, 1977–1978, Photograph by Tom Bernard, courtesy of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc.\n\ncommunicative role, what has come to be referred to as representation, and in so doing positioned Venturi and Scott Brown as outliers among the discipline’s more entrenched formalists. The word sign in the title of Venturi and Scott Brown’s Smithsonian exhibition identifies a privileged mode of reading buildings that emerged in the late 1960s through semiotics, the systematic study of signs. For semioticians, a sign is a communicative term constructed by two indivisible components: a signified (the thought concept) and a signifier (the entity that stands in for a thought concept). In his 1916 Cours de linguistique générale Ferdinand de Saussure articulated the definitive diagram for outlining his system, in which a sound-image or signifier (un significant) such as a tree (arbor) and the concept-image or signified (un signifie) such as the image of a tree combine to produce a sign. Since semiotics concerns “all aspects of culture as communicative processes,” as Umberto Eco posited in his 1972 essay “A Componential Analysis of the Architectural Sign /Column/,” it should be possible to analyze architecture from the perspective of a sign’s language. For Eco, the communicative aspect of architecture predominates over and precedes its functional role. A stair, in this respect, communicates the ability to ascend or descend in advance of our using it to transition from one level to another. Indeed, as John Hejduk notes: “The stairs of a house are mysterious because they go up and down at the same time.”8 In assessing the double imperative of communication and function, Eco distinguishes between primary functions, what “the functionalist tradition\n\n37\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 2.6 Diagram of Ferdinand de Saussure’s concept of a sign from his Cours de linguistique générale, drawn by Gavin Friehauf\n\nrecognizes as functions in the true sense of the word (going upstairs, standing at the window, taking the air, enjoying the sunlight, living together, etc.),” and secondary functions, what “art-historians and iconologists have preferred to classify as the ‘symbolical values’ of Architecture.”9 Comparing Peter Cook and Colin Fournier’s Kunsthaus (2003) in Graz, Austria to a “slug,” referring to Norman Foster’s Swiss Re Tower in London (2004) as a “gherkin,” calling Herzog and de Meuron’s Beijing National Stadium a “bird’s nest,” or nicknaming\n\nFigure 2.7 Peter Cook and Colin Fournier, Kunsthaus in Graz, Austria (2003)\n\n38\n\nInscription Figure 2.8 Foster + Partners, Swiss Re Tower, London England (2004), courtesy of Nigel Young / Foster + Partners\n\nthe Office for Metropolitan Architecture’s (OMA) Central Chinese Television Headquarters (2008) in Beijing “pants” similarly exemplify the ways in which figural form invites analogical readings that transform architecture into a built symbol, one that also risks reducing important work to one-liners. As a primary building component, the column carries myriad potential for multiple readings that go far beyond even what Eco considered. The three classical Greek orders, known as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, describe a series of column profiles that extend upwards from a temple’s base to its entablature. Columns, then, may serve as the architectural equivalent of linguistic signs. Their denotative value, a column’s literal meaning, is to support a beam. Their connotative value, symbolic references that columns evoke, begins with forming a screen of cylindrical vertical elements that subtly veil\n\n39\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 2.9 Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), Central Chinese Television Headquarters, Beijing, China (2008), Rem Koolhaas and Ole Scheeren, courtesy of OMA\n\nviews from the public exterior into the private cella, the sacred interior where an effigy of the god or goddess would dwell. Their connotative value extends to an interpretive sequence concerning their analogy with the human body and even the gender of these bodies. Columns approximate the human body semantically, functionally, and proportionally. The term for the top of a column is capital, meaning head. Statues of women supporting beams on their heads, as seen at the “Temple of the Maidens,” or Erechtheion, on the Acropolis in Athens, are called Caryatids, while their male counterparts are called Persians. As Vitruvius recounted in the first century CE, the Doric order evidences the thick and muscular proportions of a masculine nature; the Ionic order displays volutes on its capital that represent the curls of a matronly woman’s\n\n40\n\nInscription\n\npediment\n\ngable\n\nraking cornice\n\nacroterion cornice metope triglyph\n\nmoldings\n\nentablature frieze architrave abacus\n\ncapital\n\narchitrave abacus echinus necking\n\ncolumn\n\nvolute\n\ndentil boss volute rosette acanthus leaf\n\nflute\n\nshaft\n\nfillet\n\ndrum\n\nbase stylobate stererobate\n\nDoric Order\n\nIonic Order\n\nCorinthian Order Figure 2.10 Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders drawn by Gavin Friehauf\n\nFigure 2.11 Caryatids on the Erechtheion of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece\n\n41\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nhair; and the Corinthian order maintains “the graceful elegant appearance of a virgin.”10 By way of a distinction, Trajan’s Column seems to lack denotative value, with no other structural capacity than to support itself. In comparison, in Adolf Loos’s 1922 competition entry to design a skyscraper for the Chicago Tribune newspaper—where he proposed an inhabitable Doric column over 30 stories tall—the column’s denotative value is that of a typical skyscraper delineated by a base, shaft, and, cornice. As with Trajan’s Column, its connotative value references monumentality, duration, and power. Importantly, the legibility of both columns oscillates between semantic references to the human body inhabiting the classical language of architecture and to the syntactic references of the column as an ornamental structure, insofar as these colossal vertical elements support nothing but themselves. Of particular interest to reading architecture as simultaneously abstract script and figural form are the decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture where ornament, building, and text become co-spatial through the process of calligraphy. The art of transforming calligraphy into figures offers a visual embodiment of the sacred word in Islamic architecture, a way of imprinting the holy book of Qur’an onto the sacred edifice of the mosque.11 Conventional wisdom understands that the ornamental program of Islamic architecture was a response to the prohibition against using graven imagery, which in fact references the same prohibition in the Old Testament. And to a certain extent this holds true. But the rules banning iconographic art were applied inconsistently to the extent that the so-called practice displays numerous exceptions and complexities that rendered Islamic architecture as textual. Rather than overtly break with the prohibition, Islamic architects deployed the figurative ability of Arabic calligraphy to deform into identifiable shapes when covering the surfaces of their buildings with decorative yet instructive ornamentation. Great latitude between words and images inhabits Islamic calligrams, writing that conforms and deforms to accommodate the shape of an external image or concept—a poem about trees typeset in the shape of a tree. To achieve this effect, 17th-century calligraphers in Turkey, Persia, and India initiated the contrivance of words such as “Allah” or “Muhammad” into anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures like the depiction of Imam Ali as “The Lion of God” or a bismallah in the form of a hawk. Calligraphic architectural ornaments may be found throughout the Islamic world, from the upper part of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, to the mihrab of the Great Mosque in Cordoba, to the interior domes of the Blue and Suleymaniye Mosques in Istanbul, to the Masjed-e Ja¯mé (“Friday mosque”) in Isfahan, Iran. The figuring of inscriptions, or the inscribing of form, is central to more recent discussions regarding architecture’s legibility that privileges syntax over semantics. In other words, the set of rules determining the arrangement of words in sentences, versus the actual meaning of that sentence, becomes prioritized. The Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid acknowledged the combined influence of figuration and Arabic calligraphy on her work. She contended that both Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky must have looked to Chinese\n\n42\n\nInscription Figure 2.12 Adolf Loos, Chicago Tribune Tower competition entry (1922)\n\n43\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines Figure 2.13 Ornate Arabic Calligraphy on the Oljeitu Mihrab at the Jameh Masjid (“Friday mosque”) in Esfahan, Iran, courtesy of Alamy\n\nFigure 2.14 Pictorial Calligraphy of a Lion, India, 17th century, opaque watercolor, ink, and gold on paper, 12 x 19 cm © The Aga Khan Museum\n\nand Islamic scripts for inspiration. As she described her time as a student at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, Rem Koolhaas “noticed that only the Arab and Persian students like myself were able to make certain curved gestures. He thought it had to do with calligraphy.”12 Zaha Hadid Architects’s design for the Bergisel Ski Jump in Austria (1999) evokes the fluidity of a single brush stroke, while their design of the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan (2012) suggests a poem locked within a calligram, making the potential for a cursive architecture explicit. As Saffet Kaya Bekiroglu, the project architect, explains, the office considered the\n\n44\n\nInscription\n\nregion’s cultural heritage when developing the design of this highly curvilinear building. In particular, the office explored the “cursive flow of the Islamic world’s calligraphy, which was etched into mosques scattered around Baku in centuries past.”13 As Bekiroglu continues, “Fluidity has always been part of the Islamic world’s architecture,” in structures such as the 400-year-old Blue Mosque in Istanbul, where “Calligraphy and geometric patterns flow through the interior surfaces of domes and walls, and onto the carpets within, establishing this continuity.”14 Zaha Hadid Architects captioned an illustration of the process they deployed for the design of the Kartal-Pendik Masterplan in Istanbul (2006) as “Scripting Calligraphy Block Patterns” to describe various computer scripts they developed to configure random variations within the opening of the perimeter blocks of this project according to parcel size, proportion, and orientation. This process generated forms that imply some new architectural alphabet in their shapes.15 If the office’s work may appear to be letters without meaning, syntax without semantics, or form without specific legibility, it nonetheless evokes architectural writing, while the process to arrive at this place is referred to as scripting. What may initially appear to be a long comparative reach, in fact, delivers a uniquely motivated bridge between architecture and writing that contains essential tools for reading architecture conjured in an era of electronic media and design intelligence. This bridge centers on the term script and the emergence of concepts such as “shape grammar” that serve as more than digital metaphor. A script is a computational language allowing human operators to write programs that automate sequences of commands that otherwise would have to be executed one at a time. According to Malcolm McCullough, the first architectural product manager for Autodesk, in the early stages of software,\n\nFigure 2.15 Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan (2012), photograph by David Hall\n\n45\n\nPart 1 Reading Between the Lines\n\nscripting, and coding “computers operated on relatively simple geometrical data, following sets of alphabetic or algorithmic instructions” so that when image manipulation did occur, it derived from rule-based scripts.16 This rulebased design process allowed for the straightforward sequencing of architecture into a set of mathematical commands that resulted in a digital program for intelligent design to emerge with minimal human agency. In an inspiring marriage between Renaissance architectural theory and embryonic research into the potential for computers to perform autonomous design processes, Rudolf Wittkower’s publication Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (1962) initiated a debate in the 1960s on the numeric value of proportional systems that, as Kari Jormakka recounts, “inspired Bill Mitchell, George Stiny and a host of other CAD experts to proclaim the era of automatically generated architecture, based on similar geometrical principles as Palladio’s villas.”17 In 1972 George Stiny and James Gips published “Shape Grammars and the Generative Specification of Painting and Sculpture,” where they presented their method for form generation “using shape grammars which take shape as primitive and have shape specific rules.”18 As with grammatical structures in language that can generate an infinite range of sentences, shape grammars allowed for the identifying and quantifying of a set of rules that can generate an infinite range of architectures, fueling an entire field of parametric design research in which forms are generated by a complex set of rules or algorithms, a discussion that will re-emerge in Chapter 9. William J. Mitchell entitled a chapter of his book, The Logic of Architecture: Design Computation and Cognition Languages of Architecture Form (1990), “Languages of Architectural Form.” In this essay he walks the reader through a step-by-step process of transforming the internal logics of Andrea Palladio’s architecture into a digital language and, ultimately, a program for automatically designing neo-Palladian villas. He initiated this discussion by explicating a precise analogy between language and architecture. Insofar as nouns in English are governed by specific rules of grammar, they only communicate in specific combinations or strings with other words and only those strings that follow the proper rules of grammar form actual sentences.19 Mitchell turned Wittkower’s analysis of Leon Battista Alberti’s system for combining columns, piers, entablatures, and arches into an architectural syntax that performs according to an internal set of grammatical rules. Following models he researched in classical Roman architecture, Alberti avoided placing arches on freestanding columns, preferring instead to have a straight entablature to span between these vertical elements and also preferring for arches to spring from rectangular pillars that appeared as residual segments of leftover wall. Specific rules such as this describe a linear sequence of combinatory elements that allowed programmers to embed grammar in algebra. When programming more complex grammatical sequences, the strategy was to assign parameters to specify geometric transformations of their spatial relationships from a chosen lexicon.\n\n46\n\nInscription\n\nPalladio’s villas constructed in the Veneto region of Italy and his idealization of them in his publication I quattro libri dell’architettura (The Four Books of Architecture, 1570) provided sufficient internal design logics to test these operations through a complex set of rules that could generate villa floor plans in the style of Palladio. An architect who conveniently distinguished himself by developing numerous iterations of a single planimetric geometry, Palladio’s designs could be broken down into a set of iterative building blocks. Much like a parametric “shape grammar,” a term Stiny and Gips coined in 1972, Palladio’s buildings acted as original forms embedded with a set of rules that function as a generative engine for other forms. Taking the Villa Foscari (Villa Malcontenta) as a case study, the generative stages of grid definition, exterior-wall definition, room layout, interior-wall realignment, principal entrances-porticos and exterior wall inflections, exterior ornamentation-columns, windows and doors, and termination offered a catalogue of original architectural plans for Mitchell to program the computer to design in the manner of Palladio. In this trajectory from the dissection of existing buildings and their rule sets to the generation of a series of parametric shape grammars, the status of the author remains in an indeterminate zone between the programmer, the program, and the architect who eventually will use this software. To this extent a designer’s agency, his or her unique fingerprint, may become a wrinkle in a system whose terminus is the purity of entirely autonomous processes. If the architectural text at this point is to script a program, then the author may disappear into the algorithm that invariably takes over the work. Conversely, once it became possible to generate architecture from a set of rules derived from an existing building, it would be possible to do so from alternative sources and to begin to adjust the software into aberrant behaviors. If one end of this spectrum idealizes the abstract purity of rule-based, self-generating geometries, then the other romanticizes the computational potential to create hybrid monsters from the radical perversion of normative software systems. In either case, scripts have moved from words to algorithms while authorship dwells in the software. Icons have become buttons on screens as we keyboard our way into built form through electronic writing.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2\n\n3 4 5\n\nDenis Scott Brown, “Learning from Pop” originally published in Casabella (1971) in Architecture Theory Since 1968, ed.
