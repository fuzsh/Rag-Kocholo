        "text": "I’ve got a lot of catching up to do — all this time wasting valuable column inches ruminating about wine and punk rock and jazz and metal … enough already. Let’s get down to doing what good newspapers are supposed to do: push product. The stacks have stacked up on my desk again, and I’ll have no time this week to go off on wistful asides about how irritated I was that Shooter Jennings took an hour to get on stage last week, or how I was even more irritated that the Zero Boys show went from a three-band bill to a five-band bill. It was the week of going out but not actually seeing the bands I went out to see, and I could fill up a lot of space ranting, but there’s work to do.\n\nSo this is going to be the first week (of many) where I attempt to dwindle those stacks down to a manageable level.\n\nLocals only\n\nTo start things off, I thought it would be appropriate to point out some of the intriguing local releases that have stumbled into my office. I’ve always studiously avoided paying any attention to Jim O’Rourke and the Filthy Little Lies. The combined effect of him sharing a name with the other Jim O’Rourke and his omnipresence at local open-mike nights gave me the mistaken impression that he was a hack with a cool name. As the members of some long-running local bands join in the chorus, let’s agree that occasionally, the conclusions I’ve reached about certain scene stalwarts could use, um, “finessing.” The Days of Wine and Posers has been finessing the crap out of me for a while now, as the David Schweizer-produced disc is a burly batch of smart-minded roots-rock that avoids genre cliché in favor of witty lyricism, off-kilter arranging and warm production. (I swear to God, Schweizer is one of this city’s greatest musical assets.) It’s a record full of catchy surprises, with an undercurrent of sly subversion that demands repeated listenings — it reminds me of the Posies when they got really bitter. Don’t make the same mistake I did and sleep on this guy.\n\nSpeaking of mistakes\n\nBlue Meridian just released a DVD of their 2005 U.K. tour, cleverly titled 2005 United Kingdom Tour Documentary. Although Blue Meridian technically isn’t an Orlando band anymore, having made their way to the City of Angels in pursuit of fame and fortune, the effect of their incredibly long run as poll-winning self-marketing machines lingers over the City Beautiful. Say what you will, but Blue Meridian pulled off what few Orlando bands have — a 17-show run through the U.K. that met with better-than-average response. But that doesn’t make up for the numbingly self-aggrandizing tone of the DVD, nor the sheer inanity of what they decided to include — driving on the “wrong” side! The van breaks down! We eat funny food! Donovan Lyman wears a shirt that says “Donovan”! I think what’s most hilarious (and sad) about this DVD is that it proves that one of the greatest obstacles facing so many bands these days is a deeply held belief that they are the first band to ever do anything.\n\nWest coastin’\n\nIn some other West Coast-via-Orlando news, the L.A.-based Slow January label (run by former Orlandoan Chris Sapone [Shyster, Club Nowhere]) is about to release the new disc by Portland’s Alan Singley (formerly the man behind Orlando’s Missouri Loves Company, as well as a member of Pilots v. Aeroplanes) in June. Lovingkindness is a semi-psychotic romp through brainy singer-songwriter territory that sounds more Pacific Northwest than it does Central Florida. This sucks, because we could use a few more entrants in our “semi-psychotic” and “brainy” categories — especially a few who can write songs as incredible as “Short Sleeve Stumblah.”\n\nAlso finding national release via an L.A.-based label, Supervillains put out their new disc, Grow Yer Own, on Law Records, run by Pepper drummer Yesod Williams. For those familiar with Supervillains, the disc’s first 13 tracks hold few surprises, despite the fact that this is the best that their spliff-punk has ever sounded, coming dangerously close to a real capture of their live infectiousness. Yet, come track 14 — the 28-minute “Mary Jane and Jägermeister” — a surprise is definitely in store. Not in the subject matter or skanky groove of the song itself, but in the ridiculously juvenile (and completely hilarious) 20-minute stoner babble at the track’s end.\n\nOh yeah, Greater Grey released their new disc too. It’s called The Summer Ends, and that’s all I can say about it because one of the dudes works here.\n\nFirst appeared in the May 4, 2006 issue of Orlando Weekly.\n\nWHITE FLAGS OVER GEORGIA\n\nTwenty years after its dissolution, German experimental rock ensemble Faust made its American debut at the Table of the Elements Manganese festival, joining British improvising institution AMM, members of Sonic Youth, and others. Jason Ferguson sees all.\n\nTo say that the first-ever performance by Faust in the United States, during the Table of the Elements’ Manganese festival, was anticlimactic would be a bit of an understatement.\n\nAfter two consecutive nights of brilliant performances by some of the most daring and intelligent musicians of the last 30 years – including early Faust collaborator minimalist Tony Conrad, Japanese guitarist Keiji Haino, electric harpist Zeena Parkins and guitarist/composer Jim O’Rourke, as well as AMM, Gate and the Thurston Moore Group – the moment that all had been waiting for was rendered asunder by a wide variety of soundboard snafus. A crowd of 350 weary, shivering souls milling about were left milling about Atlanta’s TULA art gallery and an electrical outpost station in a state of profound confusion.\n\n“Well, this is the first gig we’ve done – the first show of the tour,” said Faust’s Jean-Herve Peron the next day. “We had trouble finding scrap metal, people don’t know each other yet, we don’t know the town, the PA had to be moved. But I would like to come back to Atlanta and do what we wanted to do. Unfortunately, the people who are first on the tour always get the best or they get the worst.”\n\nJeff Hunt, founder of Table of the Elements, the label that facilitated the tour, put it a little more succinctly. “I don’t know what the hell happened. They soundchecked for eight hours.”\n\nMarred by perpetual sound glitches and an uneven mix, original members Peron and Werner “Zappi” Dermaier struggled to make the best of the performance, and, at one point during “Picnic On A Frozen River,” things seemed to have fallen into place. But then the generators went dead, inspiring Peron to strip naked and begin painting a huge plywood wall that he would later hack to bits with an axe.\n\nThroughout the performance, a concrete wall was being constructed that would later be toppled, and Dermaier and Peron seemed to be venting their frustration by smashing televisions and banging on sheet metal, but it was something they surely intended to do anyway. Police came and shut the show down, threatening the TULA Foundation with hefty fines for blocking the substation, as well as the street in front of the museum. (Hunt admitted stealing road pylons to block off the street. “It’s a requirement to break the law in order to put on Faust shows,” he said.)\n\n“We were quite heavy last night,” said Peron. “And that’s okay, but that’s not the only thing we want to do. We also wanted to do some spacey, soft, semiacoustic things – things that only work if the sound is good.\n\n“You set, at the beginning of Faust, we explored electronics before it was popular. Then we introduced these elements – jackhammers, televisions – and then we split. Now, we are back and I realize that the electronic side has been taken so far that it would be foolish for us to try and be a step ahead. That’s not the direction where we can bring new elements. The industrial part though, I think we can bring it further. In the beginning we made sketches, now I think we can get a bit further into it.”\n\nPrompted by recent interest in their 20-year-old records, Peron and Denrmaier decided in 1990 to try and play a show. Their performance at the Prinzen Bar in Hamburg was a haphazard affair (“It happened within two or three days. The first time we practiced together was at soundcheck for the show.”), but was sufficiently inspiring to get the ball rolling for Faust to perform two years later in London, Oslo and Brussels. And, at the urging of Hunt, the group found itself on a full-fledged American tour. Not bad for a band that hasn’t released an album\n\nin 20 years.\n\n“We blew it.” said Peron of the group’s essential demise in 1974. “But it was good to blow it. It’s hard to be Faust. We were under tremendous pressure, first from Polydor, then from Virgin [each label released two of Faust’s four ‘official albums’] to tour, to sell records. Of course, at the beginning, there was no pressure – Polydor sent us to the church at Wumme to record for a year with no hassles, Virgin let us release Tapes as our first album for them – but eventually, they wanted us to sell records and to tour. That was not the situation Faust wanted to be in, so we split.”\n\n1994 finds Faust in a world that has grown accustomed to Einsturzende Neubauten and has seen electronic music develop from Kraftwerk into an altogether different beast. It’s a world in which Faust may finally have found their niche.\n\n“We never really had aims like that,” Peron said. “We never were conscious of what was happening then, and I don’t think we’re really conscious of what’s happening now.”\n\nFortunately, the Manganese show was the only disappointment in Faust’s seven-city itinerary. The group played stellar shows during the rest of their stay in America, including a show in Hartford, where all the lights were red and Peron let a red samurai fighting fish “perform”; a night in San Francisco where he carried a sheep; and a trip to Death Valley where the band, joined by Keiji, lugged their equipment on opposite sides of the ravine and engaged in a call-and-response piece while the audience lay situated below\n\n“When you make a big machine and set it rolling there are always a few squeaks at first,” commented Peron by phone later after the tour’s end. “But after we got started, it was a beautiful crescendo, everything went better and better. The tour was ever so good for us because we met so many people with so much energy I feel like doing it all over again from the beginning.”\n\nAlso performing at TULA was the legendary British group AMM, who, by all accounts, turned in the most phenomenal set of the weekend. AMM’s balance of glacial structure, communicative interaction and improvisation left the Saturday night crowd unexpectedly floored.\n\n“We realize this show does have a certain degree of status, considering the people that are playing,” said AMM guitarist Keith Rowe. “And it’s really nice to be associated with groups as diverse as the ones that are playing this weekend.”\n\n“I think in a way, we’ve really son of jumped a generation,” commented Eddie Provost, AMM’s percussionist on the surprisingly young age of the crowd. “There’s still a few people – boring old men like us – doing this stuff, but the people that immediately followed us seemed to have lost their way. But now – and I really hate to talk about ‘generations’ this way – there’s this new, vigorous generation, people like Jim [O’Rourke] – that are truly doing something new and daring. It’s really nice to be a part of that in our own way, with shows like this…sort of bridging the gap.\n\n“There’s this extraordinary interest among young people for more adventurous music. Even under all this pressure to conform, they still manage to say no, and seek out something new. This sort of music can be very difficult to find, so it’s obvious that most of the people here tonight are making great efforts to find something new.”\n\nAlthough AMM never disappeared like Faust, the improvisers’ appearance at the Manganese festival was no less anticipated, since AMM shows on American shores are quite few and far between. As Rowe put it, AMM has never stopped performing, and the nearly 30 years of vital interaction between him and Prevost (a span that usually turns improvisers to repetition) has only strengthened thetr desire to seek out newer forms of communication.\n\n“We hope there’s still that very important communication between the two of us,” he said. “Eddie and I are, most importantly, really close friends But, at the very same time, we butt heads quite a bit on the direction of the music – it’s really very important for the two of us to remain individuals. If we weren’t, this whole endeavor would be rather pointless.”\n\n“It’s still a challenge and it’s still something that’s actually interesting to do, because I don’t think we have said all we set out to say,” adds Prevost. “It’s not like we’re being dragged out of retirement for some sort of ‘show.’ It’s nice that we’re still making progress.”\n\nFirst appeared in the Aug. 1994 issue of Alternative Press."
