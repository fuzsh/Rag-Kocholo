The Eckbach spring is idyllically located on a small residential/field road in the Kleinfrankreich district in the Hertlingshausen district of Carlsberg. The name stone of the spring ("Eckbach-Ursprung") is one of the over 300 knight stones of the Palatinate Forest Association.

From the street (to the left of the prohibition sign "Private property - no entry") there are a few steps down to the spring. This short footpath is a bit overgrown.

On the other side of the street there is a very nice rest bench with 2 information boards, slightly higher up. This bench looks directly onto the (empty) back of the knight stone as well as beautiful (pasture) meadows.
