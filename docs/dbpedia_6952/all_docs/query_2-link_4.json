It rises in the Alps, and in the Swiss canton of Graubumlnden both sources \"Vorderrhein\" and \"Hinterrhein\" join. Called \"Alpenrhein\" it moves northward, out of the Alps and into Lake Konstanz. Soon after it leaves the lake at its western end, assuming the name of \"Hoch-Rhein\" and near Schaffhausen it forms the \"Rheinfall\", a major fall.\n\nNear the Swiss city of Basel the river turns north into the upper Rhine lowland. For the next 150 km the Rhine marks the border between France and Germany. Further north, from the city of Bingen on it forces its way through the mountains of the \"Rheinisches Schiefergebirge\" into the following Northern German lowlands. After running 865 km through Germany the Rhine splits into a number of branches in the Netherlands and near the Dutch city of Hoek van Holland its southern main-branch flows into the North Sea.\n\nCharacteristics of the river\n\nThe Rhine-Fall is a waterfall in Switzerland, south of the city of Schaffhausen. It is 150 metres wide and 20-25 metres deep . The water falls over white limestone into its original riverbed. There are the tributary rivers Wutach (from the east), Thur and Aare (from the west). When the snow melts in springtime, the river can swell up to 650 cubic-m/sec, which is why there is often high water in spring and summer. Although the Rhine-Fall became smaller because of several power stations, it is the biggest and greatest waterfall in Central Europe.\n\nThe Rhine is navigable from Basel to its mouth, a distance of some 500 miles (some 800 km). The transport of goods makes the Rhine economically important. Only the fact that a yearly amount of 25 millions of goods are transshipped in the harbour of Duisburg, Europes biggest inland harbour, shows the huge extent of this goodstraffic which is managed by thousands of ships. The principal rivers of Western Europe, including the Seine, Elbe, Ems, Main, Donau, Rhine, and Saine are linked to the Rhine by canals.\n\nThe Rhine has been open to international navigation since 1868 by terms of the Mannheim convention. Modern technologies now permit 24-hours navigation and transport of heavier loads on the river such as coal, iron ore, grain, potash, petroleum, iron and steel, timber and other commodities. In the ports of Basel, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Mainz, Koblenz, Köln and Duisburg the goods are unloaded and transshipped. Because of the huge volume of freight and number of passangers carried on it, the Rhine is one of the most important inland waterways in the world. On its way to the ocean also a lot of electrical current is generated which emphasizes the economical significance of the Rhine.\n\nThe Rhine as an inland water is of importance for the industry since various goods are transported on this river by inland ships. The inland ship represents a fast and reliable means of transport.\n\nHow a Rhine lock works\n\nLocks help ships to overcome different water levels. This is how a lock works: if a ship wants to sail from lower to upper level it must move into the lock chamber; the gates at both ends are closed and water is pumped into the chamber; as soon as the water is level with the upper level , the (upper) lock gate is opened and the ship leaves the lock.\n\nWildlife on the Rhine\n\nThe \"Graureiher\" live at ponds, swamps and rivers. They fish for fish and frogs in shallow water. The \"Graureiher\" are tall and slim. In the past there were only two kinds of the larvas of ephemeras in the Central-Rhine- area, in contrast to at least 15 kinds in the Upper-Rhine-area. Today larvas of ephemeras have completely died out in the Central-Rhine-area. The barbel, only found seldomly today, must be regarded as a leader-fish. Moreover a number of other species existed there. There are important biotopes for swamp- and waterbirds in the area below the city of Koblenz. The eagle-owl brooded here until 1920. Still today the warmth-loving \"Zippammer\"(a bird) which normally prefers the Mediterraneans lives on the cliffs of the Central-Rhine-area. It resembles the \"Goldammer\" but has got a grey throat, a brown belly and black head- stripes.\n\nNature Reserves along the Rhine\n\nNature reserves are areas that are completely or partially protected either because of their scientific, historic or cultural interest or because of their scenic beauty or individuality. Nature reserves are established by order of the regional government and registered in the nature reserve book at the federal office for environmental protection.\n\nThe \"Kühkopf\" Nature Reserve\n\nThe Kühkopf reserve lies in the northern Upper Rhine area about 15 km west of Darmstadt. With its 2400 hectars it is the largest riverbank forest area in central Europe.The 16 km long loop of the Stockstadt- Ehrfeld old Rhine around the Kühkopf island was once the original course of the main river. Because the whole area lies within the vicinity of the main Rhine dam it can be flooded completely and so basically natural conditions are to be found everywhere. The flora of the \"Kühkopf\" consists mainly of poplars, elms, willows and oaks. Rare birds can be seen in their natural habitat. The \"Mittelspecht\" (a woodpecker species), nightingale and \"Schwarzmilan\" are typical birds of the \"Kühkopf\" where almost 240 breeds have been listed. Of course one also sees native animals such as the beaver, deers stags, bats, chipmunks and birchmice. No animals in the reserve are allowed to be hunted, poached or chased.\n\nWhat are riverbank forests?\n\nRiverbank forests are dependent on the periodical changes between floods and aridity. The various plant communities establish themselves according to the length of the periods. Except for a few small areas these typical Upper Rhine riverbank forests have now all disappeared. The Kühkopf wild life reserve is an example of these rare areas and is now used as a nature reserve.\n\nWaste water is purified in a Sewage Works before running into the Rhine\n\nSince stretches of water are not to be polluted by waste products, waste water needs to be purified before being channeled into a river. Therefore a sewage works is necessary which we want to explain now:\n\nFirst of all rough matter such as paper or fibres are sieved out with a fine grid, the \"teeth\" of which are ca. 6 1/2 inches apart from each other.\n\nNow sand and other heavy material is filtered out in a \"sand-catch\".\n\nThen the waste water enters a \"pre-settling tank\". Here coarse mud substances as well as floating substances such as oil are separated. This is done by first letting matter settle and then removing it with the help of a \"mud-remover\".\n\nThe waste water, thus having been mechanically pre- cleaned is now led into an \"activation-tank\" where the micro-biologic decomposition of the water's organic pollution takes place. This is executed in a \"roundabout-system\".\n\nThe oxygen needed for this process is added through a \"ventilation-rotor\". The oxygen is important since otherwise the biological decomposition cannot happen.\n\nNow the water goes into a tank where certain chemicals are added in order to purify it additionally.\n\nHereafter the waste water floats into a \"post-settling tank\" where the activated mud from the activation-tank is filtered out.\n\nAfter that the waste water has been biologically, chemically and mechanically purified and through the \"clear water-drain off-canal\" .\n\nIt finally runs into the Rhine.\n\nHistory\n\nThe City of Speyer: Towering above this old imperial city on the Rhine is the splendid romanesque cathedral, 1000 years old and quite unique. The crypt holds the graves of eight German emperors and kings. The cathedral dominates the town but there are many other historical monuments, like the Heathen Tower, from the end of the 13th century or the Jewish Bath, dating from 1100 A.D.\n\nMainz: Mainz developed from a Celtic settlement left to the mouth of the river Main into the Rhine. For a long time Mainz was a major centre of the wine trade along the Rhine and an important harbour city. Today this city has 184.000 inhabitants and is the capital of the state of \"Rhineland-Palatinate\" (Rheinland-Pfalz). Due to its favoured location it is an important trade centre. In Mainz companies have been established that manufacture machinery, process wood and produce leather goods. It was registered as an archbishop's town as early as in 747A.D. It became a centre of Christian Germany rather early. The priests' seminar was founded at that time, and it is located in Mainz now. In the Middle Ages Mainz was the most luxurious city on the Upper Rhine. The inventor of book-printing, Johannes Gutenberg, was born here in 1400AD. There is a museum in his honour in Mainz. Moreover there are the Mainz University (hosting roughly 25.000 students), the Academy of Science and Literature, the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemistry and the School of Music and Art. The city's symbol is the impressive cathedral built in Roman style.\n\nDie Loreley: The Loreley Rock stands 133m (or 399feet) above the water level on the right bank of the rive Rhine. It stands near the village of St Goarshausen. The legend tells that in the evening as darkness descends, a beautiful young maiden by the name of Loreley, sits on the rock combing her long golden hair and singing a haunting melody. Sailors on the river Rhine who look upon her are captivated by her beauty, and forgetting where they are, head towards the treacherous rock, and lose themselves(drown) in the depths of the river. This has been the tragic fate of many ships and sailors.\n\nAnother story about Loreley: Some people say that Loreley really lived. She was loved by lots of men because she was very beautiful. But she only loved one knight. But one day he had to go to war. The other men wanted to marry Loreley, but she was not interested in them. She only thought of her knight. Many men killed themselves because they loved her. Soon the people started to believe that she was a witch. Loreley was very unhappy. The Archbishop of Cologne felt sorry for Loreley and decided to send her to a convent. On the way to the convent she wanted to stand on the Loreley-rock to look at her knight's castle for the last time. While she was standing there, she saw the knight in a small boat on the Rhine. She shouted his name. When the knight heard her, he forgot about the rocks, crashed onto them and drowned. Loreley jumped into the Rhine because she wanted to be near the knight. Nobody ever saw her again.\n\nMaria Schwarze-Kaufmann\n\nLeininger-Gymnasium, Grumlnstadt, Germany\n\nÚltima actualització: 25 d'agost de 2000"
