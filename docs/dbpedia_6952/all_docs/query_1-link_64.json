        "text": "German Medieval Castles and Fortresses\n\n(Burgen, Festung und Schlosser)\n\n(Author's artwork)\n\nMy version of Albrecht Durer's Medieval German Knight with a castle (also known as a Schloss, Berg or Festung). Â\n\nOil on canvas, 16 X 20.\n\nMy father served with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) at 3 (F) Wing, ZweibrÃ¼cken, Germany, (1959-1963),\n\nand often took our family castle hunting throughout our time in Europe. Â This generated a huge interest for me in\n\nexploring and examining these historic time capsules. Â After I joined the Army, I too had the extraordinary privilege\n\nof serving with Head Quarters Canadian Forces Europe (HQ CFE) based at CFB Lahr, from 1981 to 1983, and with\n\n4 CMBG also based at CFB Lahr, from 1989 to 1992. Â I have explored, photographed, painted pictures and\n\ndocumented castles from one end of Europe to the other, and you will find other pages describing some of them\n\non this website. Â This page is specifically dedicated to medieval castles in Germany, and some of their history as a\n\nsupplement to the other pages on castles near ZweibrÃ¼cken, Baden-Soellingen, and Lahr on this web site. Â I hope\n\nyou find them interesting.\n\nCanadian Forces Europe (CFE) consisted of two formations in what was known as West Germany before the Berlin\n\nWall fell in November 1990. Â These formations included Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Lahr with 4 Canadian\n\nMechanized Brigade Group (4 CMBG) (1957-1993), and No. 1 Canadian Air Division (1 CAD), RCAF, at CFB\n\nBase Baden-Soellingen and CFB Base Lahr, which later became No. 1 Canadian Air Group (1 CAG). Â Both\n\nformations were closed in 1993 with the end of the Cold War. Â Many Canadian families took the opportunity to\n\nexplore and tour the countryside surrounding these communities, and some of these castles may be very familiar to you.\n\nThe 12th century castle near Lahr named Hohengeroldseck, and a secondary castle overlooking it, Schloss\n\nLutzelhardt near Seelbach were two that most would have visited. Â There are many more and the aim of this page\n\nis to tell you a bit some of them that stand further afield.\n\nBurgruine Hohengeroldseck, Seelbach. Â The castle, of which the approximately 10 m high outer walls (lower castle)\n\nand the main building (upper castle) have been preserved, was built around 1260 as the family seat of the Lords of\n\nGeroldseck. Â After an eventful history, it was destroyed by French soldiers in 1688.\n\n(Lahr Historical Society Photo)\n\nLahr: Burg Hohengeroldseck, as it appeared before its destruction in the 1689. Â The castle was built ca 1270 on the\n\nSeelbacher SchÃ¶nberg mountain between Schutter and Kinzigtal in the Ortenau, not far from Offenburg and Lahr.\n\nHohengeroldseck was a state of the Holy Roman Empire, and it served as the family seat of the Lords of Geroldseck,\n\ninitially under Walther I von Geroldseck. Â\n\nLahr: Profile of Hohengeroldseck before its destruction.\n\nThe Geroldseck family had initially built a small castle, first mentioned in 1139, on the edge of the Gengenbach\n\nmonastery area (called Rauhkasten, and later Alt-Geroldseck). Â The family prospered in the 13th century and chose\n\na more suitable location to build a more impressive fortification, c1250/60. Â c1260, they supported the Bishop of\n\nStrasbourg, who shortly afterwards was overthrown by the Strasbourg citizens in a battle in 1262 and died shortly\n\nafterwards. Â Ownership of the castle began to divide in 1277, through inheritances, and again in 1301 and in 1370.\n\nClaims on the castle were made by the Counts of Moers-Saar Werden, resulting in the Geroldsecker War of 1433\n\nin which they were unsuccessful. Â In 1434 and 1470 the ownership of the castle was further partitioned. Â c1473/1474,\n\nthe city of Strasbourg besieged the castle without success. Â In the power struggle between the Habsburgs and the\n\nElectoral Palatinate, the castle was again besieged, captured and occupied until 1504, by Count Palatine Philipp.\n\nThe castle was administered by the Margraves of Baden until c1534, when the Geroldsecker family was again\n\npermitted to inhabit the castle. Â When Dautenstein Castle was converted into a Renaissance castle in 1599, the\n\nGeroldsecker family moved there. Â When the Geroldsecker family died out in 1634, the castle came into the\n\npossession of the Counts of Cronberg (Taunus). Â In the Palatinate War of Succession, the castle was set on fire\n\nwhen the French left in 1689. Â A planned expansion to the fortress did not take place in the following period,\n\nwith the exception of a few earthworks. Â In 1692, the ruins were awarded to the Barons von der Leyen.\n\nThe earliest contruction work done on Geroldseck Castle took place in the 13th century. Â The castle was built\n\nwith two strong residential buildings in the form of a large double palace. Â Much of the building is Gothic in form,\n\nincluding windows and door walls, dating some of the work to the 14th century. Â Few of the original 13th century\n\nworks have survived, and those are mainly in the lower parts of the building. Â In 1390 the complex was destroyed\n\nby lightning. Â No reliable information is available about the extent of the restoration after the castle was partly\n\ndestroyed again in 1486. Hohengeroldseck was destroyed for the final time by the French in 1689 and has been in\n\nruins ever since. Â From 1883 repair work has been carried out on the castle ruins. Â At the beginning of the 1950s,\n\na new spiral staircase was installed in the tower of the rear hall. Since 1958, the castle has been maintained by an\n\nassociation based in Seelbach.\n\nAccess to the castle is gained through a Renaissance era or early Baroque gate to a bastion, then through the late\n\nmedieval (heavily restored) main gate and then by an older gate into the lower courtyard. Â The lower castle\n\nextends as a wide court around the oval core castle, which is raised on a porphyry rock. Â A defendable well\n\nhouse with its outer walls seems to date from the 14th century. Â The well shaft is estimated to be 65 m deep, but\n\nis partially filled at present. Â The remains of a building with a stair tower belong to the 16th century, as do the\n\nremains of a building in the southeast corner of the lower castle. Â An older cistern there was vaulted. Â An exposed,\n\nlower-lying forge with a sandstone trough dates from the time before the partial destruction in 1486. Â There are\n\nadditional traces of the wall in the ground above the gate chamber.\n\nOne of the two palas buildings in the main castle is in good condition, the other is only preserved in sparse, heavily\n\nrestored remains. Â Inside, on the high mantle wall between the two palace buildings, there was a low kitchen,\n\nflanked by two round stair towers that opened up the palace buildings. Â In addition to the stair tower, which has\n\nbeen preserved up to the eaves of the stone roof, the well-preserved palace building also shows many structural\n\ndetails such as rectangular windows, pointed arched windows, chimneys, a possible toilet niche and the remains\n\nof a stair gable. Â The main building of the palace is believed to have taken place in the 14th century. Â The remains\n\nof the initial 13th century castle are few, although elements can be seen in the lower masonry.\n\n(Hugo Schneider Map)\n\nHohengeroldseck Schlossberg, Seelbach, Germany, ground plan.\n\n(Bully's from Hohengeroldseck Photo)\n\nAerial view of Hohengeroldseck.\n\nFor those Canadian families who lived near 4 (F) Wing Baden-Soellingen, No. 1 Canadian Air Division (1 CAD),\n\nRCAF, later No. 1 Canadian Air Group (1 CAG), there are many castles close to the what was CFB Baden-Soellingen before it closed in 1993. Â Burg Hohenbaden would be one of them most would be familiar with.\n\n(Muck Photo)\n\nBaden-Baden: Burg Hohenbaden (Alten SchloÃ Baden-Baden), was the seat of the Margraves of Baden in the\n\nMiddle Ages. Â They named themselves after the castle, which gave the state of Baden its name. Â The castle was built\n\nas the first dominion center of the Margraves of Limburg after the relocation of their rule to the Upper Rhine on the\n\nwestern slope of the rocky mountain Battert above what was then called Baden. Â The construction of the upper castle,\n\nthe so-called Hermannsbaus, by Margrave Hermann II (1074â1130) is assumed to have started around 1100. Â From\n\n1112 the Margraves of Baden named themselves after the castle. Under Margrave Bernhard I of Baden (1372â1431)\n\nthe Gothic lower castle was built, which was expanded by Margrave Jakob I (1431â1453) to become the representative\n\ncenter of the margraviate.\n\nThe most important component is the Bernhard Building (around 1400), whose column on the ground floor with a\n\ncoat of arms carried by angels once supported the mighty vault. Â In its heyday, the castle had 100 rooms. Â In the\n\nsame century, Margrave Christoph I expanded the New Castle, which was begun in 1370, in the city of Baden and\n\nmoved the residence there in 1479. The old castle then served as a widow's residence, but in 1599 it was destroyed\n\nby fire. Â The ruins were not structurally secured until after 1830. Â It was later looked after by the State Palaces and\n\nGardens of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n\nThe old castle has belonged to Wolfgang Scheidtweiler since 2017. From its tower you have a good panoramic\n\nview of Baden-Baden and a distant view of the Rhine plain and the Vosges. The castle courtyard of the ruin is\n\nalso worth seeing. The castle and tower can be visited free of charge. There is a restaurant in the castle. The castle\n\nis a popular starting point for hikes on the Battert with its scenic, protected climbing rocks and a protected forest.\n\nA large wind harp stands in the ruins of the great hall of the old castle.\n\nThe harp, which was set up in 1999, has a total height of 4.10 meters and 120 strings, it was developed and built\n\nby the local musician and harp maker RÃ¼diger Oppermann, who called it the largest wind harp in Europe. The nylon\n\nstrings are stimulated by the draft to produce the basic notes C and G. From 1851 to 1920 there was a small wind\n\nharp in the knight's hall of the old castle. Â (Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg I.

Â Of more than 500 castles in the Rhineland Palatinate region this is one\n\nof only three to have survived the many wars and destruction in the region mostly intact since the 11th century.\n\nThe Eltz family occupied the castle in the 12th century, and then continued to make renovations and additions for\n\ncenturies afterwards. For this reason it wasnât fully completed until between 1490 and 1540. Â The 80-room castle\n\nis still occupied today, and looks much as it would have hundreds of years ago. Â The castle is one of the few in the\n\narea that survived the Thirty Yearsâ War. Â The French did not destroy the castle thanks to its location, and some\n\nskilled diplomacy on the part of the landowners.\n\nIt is a good walk to get to, up and down a number of hills and forest tracks through a beautiful area and a\n\nbreathtaking view of the castle. Â Burg Eltz is one of the hundreds of castles examined by the author while\n\nresearching material for the book \"Siegecraft\". Â Burg Eltz is, in this author's opinion, the most interesting of them all. Â\n\n(Francisco Conde SÃ¡nchez Photo)\n\nEltz Castle (Burg Eltz) is a medieval castle nestled in the hills above the Moselle River between Koblenz and Trier.\n\nIt is still owned by a branch of the same family (the Eltz family) that lived there in the 12th century, 33 generations\n\nago. Â BÃ¼rresheim Castle, Eltz Castle and Lissingen Castle are the only castles on the left bank of the Rhine in Rhineland-\n\nPalatinate which have never been destroyed.\n\nThe castle is surrounded on three sides by the Elzbach River, a tributary on the north side of the Moselle. Â It stands\n\non a 70-metre (230 ft) rock spur, on an important Roman trade route between rich farmlands and their markets.\n\nThe Eltz Forest has been declared a nature reserve by Flora-Fauna-Habitat and Natura 2000.\n\nThe castle is a so-called Ganerbenburg, a castle belonging to community of joint heirs. Â This is a castle divided\n\ninto several parts, which belong to different families or different branches of a family; this usually occurs when\n\nmultiple owners of one or more territories jointly build a castle to house themselves. Â Only wealthy medieval\n\nEuropean lords could afford to build castles or equivalent structures on their lands; many of them only owned\n\none village, or even only part of a village. Â This was an insufficient base to afford castles. Â Such lords usually\n\nlived in \"knight's houses\", which were fairly simple houses, scarcely bigger than those of their tenants. Â In some\n\nparts of the Holy Romain Empire of the German Nation, inheritance law required that the estate be divided among\n\nall successors. Â These successors, each of whose individual inheritance was too small to build a castle of his own,\n\ncould build a castle together, where each owned one separate part for housing and all of them together shared the\n\ndefensive fortification. Â In the case of Eltz, the family comprised three branches and the existing castle was enhanced\n\nwith three separate complexes of buildings.\n\nThe main part of the castle consists of the family portions. Â At up to eight stories, these eight towers reach heights\n\nof between 30 and 40 metres (98 and 131 ft). Â They are fortified with strong exterior walls; to the yard they present\n\na partial framework. Â About 100 members of the owners' families lived in the over 100 rooms of the castle. Â A\n\nvillage once existed below the castle, on its southside, which housed servants, craftsman, and their families supporting the castle.\n\nPlatteltz, a Romanesque keep, is the oldest part of the castle, having begun in the 9th century as a simple manor\n\nwith an earthen palisade. Â By 1157 the fortress was an important part of the empire under Frederick Barbaross,\n\nstanding astride the trade route from the Moselle Valley and the Eifel region. Â In the years 1331â1336, there\n\noccurred the only serious military conflicts that the castle experienced. Â During the Eltz Feud, the lords of Eltzer,\n\ntogether with other free imperial knights, opposed the territorial policy of the Archbishop and Elector Balduin von\n\nTrier. Â The Eltz Castle was put under siege and possible capture and was bombarded with catapults by the\n\nArchbishop of the Diocese of Trier. Â A small siege castle, Trutzeltz Castle, was built on a rocky outcrop on the\n\nhillside above the castle, which can still be seen today as a few ruined walls outside of the northern side of the\n\ncastle. Â The siege lasted for two years, but ended only when the free imperial knights had given up their imperial\n\nfreedom. Balduin reinstated Johann again to the burgrave, but only as his subjects and no longer as a free knight.\n\nIn 1472 the RÃ¼benach house, built in the Late Gothic style, was completed. Â Remarkable are the RÃ¼benach Lower\n\nHall, a living room, and the RÃ¼benach bedchamber with its opulently decorated walls.\n\nStarted in 1470 by Philipp zu Eltz, the 10-story Greater Rodendorf House takes its name from the family's land\n\nholding in Lorraine. Â The oldest part is the flag hall with its late Gothic vaulted ceiling, which was probably\n\noriginally a chapel. Construction was completed around 1520. Â The (so-called) Little Rodendorf house was finished\n\nin 1540, also in Late Gothic style. It contains the vaulted \"banner-room\". Â The Kempenich house replaced the o\n\nriginal hall in 1615. Â Every room of this part of the castle could be heated; in contrast, other castles might only\n\nhave one or two heated rooms.\n\nIn the Palatinate War of Succession from 1688 to 1689, most of the early Rhenish castles were destroyed. Â Since\n\nHans Anton was a senior officer in the French army to Eltz Ãttingen, he was able to protect the castle Eltz from destruction. Â Count Hugo Philipp zu Eltz was thought to have fled during the French rule on the Rhine from 1794\n\nto 1815. Â The French confiscated his possessions on the Rhine and nearby Trier which included Eltz castle, as well\n\nas the associated goods which were held at the French headquarters in Koblenz. Â In 1797, when Count Hugo Philipp\n\nlater turned out to have remained hidden in Mainz, he came back to the reclaim of his lands, goods and wealth.\n\nIn 1815 he became the sole owner of the castle through the purchase of the RÃ¼benacher house and the landed\n\nproperty of the barons of Eltz-RÃ¼benach.\n\nIn the 19th century, Count Karl zu Eltz was committed to the restoration of his castle. Â In the period between 1845\n\nand 1888, 184,000 marks (about 15 million euros in 2015) was invested into the extensive construction work, very\n\ncarefully preserving the existing architecture. Â Extensive security and restoration work took place between the\n\nyears 2009 to 2012. Â Among other things, the vault of flags hall was secured after it was at risk of partially\n\ncollapsing walls and the porch of the Kempenich section. Â In addition to these static repairs, almost all the slate\n\nroofs were replaced. Â Structural problems were remedied in the ceiling and wood damage was repaired. Â In the\n\ninterior, heating and sanitary facilities, windows and fire alarm system were renewed, and also historic plaster\n\nwas restored. Â The half-timbered facades and a spiral staircase were renovated at the costs of around â¬4.4 million.\n\nThe measures were supported by a â¬2 million grant from an economic stimulus package provided by the German\n\nfederal government. Â The state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the German Foundation for Monument Protection and\n\nthe owners provided further funds.\n\nThe RÃ¼benach and Rodendorf families' homes in the castle are open to the public, while the Kempenich branch\n\nof the family uses the other third of the castle. Â The public is admitted seasonally, from April to October. Â Visitors\n\ncan view the treasury, with gold, silver and porcelain artifacts and the armory of weapons and suits of armour.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1992, an engraving of Eltz Castle was used on the German 500 Deutsche Mark note.\n\n(de Fabianis, Valeria, ed.

Â Built on a spur of Klusenberg hill, the castle lies near the Lenne in the MÃ¤rkischer Kreis. Â The castle was built early in the 12th century by the Counts of Berg. Â They eventually abandoned Altena and moved their residence to Hamm.\n\nThe castle may have been built by the brothers Adolf and Everhard von Berg around the year 1108 after Henry V granted them land in the Sauerland for their loyal services. Â They built their castle on Wulfseck Mountain, naming it Wulfeshagen, later Altena. Â This is one of the several legends of the establishment of the county of Altena and the building of the castle.\n\nAfter the acquisition of the parish land of Mark near the city of Hamm in 1198, the counts of Altena took Mark Castle as their primary residence and called themselves the Counts of the Mark. Â They only occasionally inhabited Altena Castle, and from 1392 onward it was only used as a residence for the county bailiff (Amtmann). Â Count Engelbert III of the Mark gave the small settlement at the base of the mountain the rights of liberty (such as self-governance). Â In 1455 the castle burned down and was only re-erected partially.\n\nIn the Brandenburg-Prussian era, the castle became a garrison until it was sold to the town of Altena in 1771. Â In the following years an almshouse and a workhouse was established there. Â This existed until 1840. Â From 1766 to 1811 there existed a criminal court and prison in the castle. Â By 1834 the castle had greatly deteriorated and needed to be rebuilt. Â Due to lack of funds, however, this was not carried out. Â The Johanniter Order set up a hospital in the buildings.\n\nDue to the 300 year-anniversary of the membership of the County of Mark to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1909 plans for a reconstruction of the castle began. Â In 1914 this was completed, apart from the outer bailey and lower gatehouse. Â There was a controversial debate about the modes of reconstruction, where the preference of historic designs over the medieval and early modern architecture was criticised. Â In 1918 the last works were completed.\n\nIn 1914, Richard Schirrmann established the world's first youth hostel within the castle, which is still in use today (Jugendherberge Burg Altena). Â The original rooms are a museum today. Â The youth hostel continues to run at a location on the lower castle court yard, opened in 1934. Â Today the castle is symbol of the town of Altena and a tourist attraction. Â The entry ticket is also valid for the nearby Deutsche Drahtmuseum (German Wire Museum). Â During the first weekend of August a yearly Medieval Festival takes place in the castle and town. Â Part of the castle is used as a restaurant.

Â It stands 300 m above sea level on a hill about 20 meters above the confluence of the Wohnrother Back and the Schumbach to the MÃ¶rsdorger in the district of Buch in the Rhine-HunsrÃ¼ck district in Rhineland-Palatinate. Â Archbishop Baldwin of Trier acquired the site in 1325 after a truce arranged with Ritter Richard and Ritter Wirich, leading to the right to build a castle on it. Â The castle was built in spite of a number of interruptions, in 1331. Â Its purpose was primarily to counted Kastellaun Castle in the county of Sponheim. Â Its construction appears to have taken inspiration from Western models, particularly the French donjon style.\n\nThe castle was built on a narrow rock spur, and served as the official seat of the Trier administrative district of the same name. Â When the seat was moved to Zell in the 16th century, the castle became largely insignificant. Â Owners and administrators often changed, because Balduinseck always remained part of the Trier electoral state. Â In 1675 the office building was leased. Â In 1711 the castle fell into neglect and in 1780 it was declared dilapidated. Â It does not appear to have suffered damage from any of the numerous wars.\n\nThe castle ruin is about 55 meters long and up to 20 meters wide in an east-west direction. Â The outer walls of the 18-meter-high, four-story residential tower are well preserved and give the ruin its distinctive appearance. Â The residential tower has a footprint of 22.7 Ã 14.4 meters, the walls are up to 2.5 meters thick. Â A spiral staircase on the left side of the main entrance and nine chimneys are preserved, extending over three floors. Â The fourth floor has no chimneys and was therefore probably used as a storage room and for military purposes. Â In front of the large main chimney on the ground floor, which is let into the east wall, the remains of a fountain are still present. Â In addition to the chimneys, the openings for wall cupboards as well as the white interior plaster and a white stripe of the former exterior plaster between the third and fourth floors have been preserved.\n\nAfter a fire in 1425, the interior of the residential tower was redesigned. Â Most of the open fireplaces have been converted into closed, smoke-free tiled stoves in favor of more effective heating. Â The upper floors remained unheated and were only used as storage rooms.\n\nThe specialty of the castle is the location of the residential building that was completed first. Â Contrary to the usual structure of a castle, the residential tower, which was equipped with a defensive core on the east side, stands behind the neck ditch, directly on the attack side. Â Such an arrangement can be found in other castles built by Baldwin of Luxembourg.\n\nIn front of the residential tower are the remains of a subsequently erected round tower in the west and the circular wall that was finally built, where a round shell tower open to the castle courtyard is structurally integrated into the south side of the masonry. Â In addition, the old driveway with neck ditch and the associated bridgehead can still be seen. Â To the east there are the remains of a second trench with the foundation walls of an advanced tower.\n\nParts of the foundation were so badly damaged that they could no longer withstand the pressure of the masonry. Â Cracks proved that the entire structure was weakening. Â It was considered to be in acute danger of collapsing. Â Therefore, the ruin was subjected to comprehensive security building measures from summer 2009. Â The work was divided into five construction phases and was completed in 2014.

Â It is\n\nlocated on the River Kyll in Gerolstein in the administrative district of Vulkaneifel in Rhineland-Palatinate. Â From\n\nthe outside it appears to be a single unit, but it is a double castle; an estate division in 1559 created the so-called\n\nlower castle and upper castle, which continue to have separate owners. Â Together with BÃ¼rresheim and Eltz, it has\n\nthe distinction among castles in the Eifel of never having been destroyed. Â Lissingen Castle is a protected cultural\n\nproperty under the Hague Convention.\n\nThe castle is located on the edge of Lissingen, a district of the city of Gerolstein, close to the river Kyll. Â It was\n\noriginally surrounded by the river and on the south and west sides by a moat. Â The moat has been filled in and\n\nstreets created on the site, but traces of the original water defenses are visible on the river side of the castle.\n\nLissingen and neighboring Sarresdorph most likely originated as a Roman settlement. Â Evidence of this is based\n\non archeological finds from an excavation in one of the courtyards of the lower castle before the First World War,\n\nand also by its proximity to the former Roman settlement of Ausava, a horse-changing station on the road between\n\nTreves and Cologne that today is the section of Gerolstein called Oos.\n\nAfter the Germanic influx of the 5th century, the former Roman settlements came under the control of the Frankish\n\nkings and later became demesne of the Merovingians and Carolingians. Â In the 8th and 9th centuries, during the\n\nCarolingian era, Lissingen and Sarresdorph were both possessions of PrÃ¼m Abbey or of its estate of BÃ¼desheim. Â\n\nFollowing attacks on the abbey by Normans in the 9th century, fortified towers and later castles were built to\n\nprotect it. Â The castle at Lissingen took its present form as a defensible complex of buildings during the heyday\n\nof chivalry in the High Middle Ages. Â The first documentary mention of Lissingen Castle dates to 1212, as a\n\npossession of the Ritter (knight) von Liezingen. Â In 1514, PrÃ¼m Abbey enfeoffed Gerlach Zandt von Merl with\n\nLissingen. Â In 1559, the castle was then divided into two sections, the upper and the lower castle.\n\nIn 1661â63, Ferdinand Zandt von Merl almost completely rebuilt the lower castle. Â By incorporating three\n\nmedieval residential towers, he created an imposing manorial residence. Â There was a small annexed chapel,\n\nwhich is mentioned in 1711 and 1745 as the oratory of the von Zandt family. Â This was surrendered in the early\n\n20th century. Â After Anton Heinrich von Zandtâs death in 1697, Wilhelm Edmund von Ahr was the owner of the\n\ncastle. Â He doubled the size of the inhabited part of the castle.\n\nIn 1762, the elector of Trier (as procurator of PrÃ¼m Abbey) enfeoffed Josef Franz von Zandt zu Merl with Lissingen.\n\nA few years later, in 1780, as an Imperial Knight of the Holy Roman Empire, the latter became Freiherr of Lissingen,\n\na small autonomous territory. Â Lissingen retained this status until the abolition of the Feudal system, and the castle\n\nwas greatly extended, in particular by the addition of a much larger tithe barn and stables.\n\nAs a result of the French Revolutioin, in 1794 the region of the left bank of the Rhine, including the estate of\n\nLissingen Castle, came under French administration. Â The Eifel became a Prussian possession in 1815. Â In the\n\nyears that followed, both sections of the castle changed hands several times, until they were reunited in 1913\n\nunder a single owner, who developed the property into a large agricultural operation. Â The construction of a small\n\npower plant, which began operation in 1906, had an appreciable effect on the economic operation of the castle.\n\nThis provided electricity for the castle, approximately 50 houses in the settlement of Lissingen, and the local train\n\nstation. Â Private power generation ended in 1936, when the Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lisches ElektrizitÃ¤tswerk took over\n\nservice to Lissingen.\n\nIn 1932, a Cologne brewery owner by the name of Greven acquired the property, which had been affected by the\n\ninternational economic crisis. Â He developed the large agricultural infrastructure on the south side of the castle,\n\nincluding in 1936 a new cowshed with a milking parlor, a milk processing plant, a refrigerated storage area and\n\none of the first milk bottling plants in the Eifel. Â During the Second World War, the castle served as a billet for several Wehrmacht regiments and as command post for the German General Staff. Â Towards the end of the war,\n\nit was used as a temporary prison for highly ranked military captives.\n\nAfter the war, the Greven family resumed dairy and livestock farming operations. Â Until 1977, the lower castle\n\nwas operated as an agricultural enterprise by a leaseholder. Â However, the estate ceased to be economically viable\n\nas a farm. Â The castle buildings, especially the gatehouse of the upper castle and the entire lower castle, were\n\nincreasingly neglected and fell into disrepair. Â Investment in the buildings resumed only after both sections of the\n\ncastle came into the hands of new owners.\n\nIn 1987 the lower castle was acquired by Karl Grommes, a patent attorney from Koblentz. Â He has carried out\n\nwide-ranging restoration work and added furniture, household effects, and workshops, with the intention of\n\nrestoring the appearance of the entire ensemble to provide insights into life and work in such a castle and on its\n\ngrounds. Â As of 2011, the following parts of the castle are open to visitors: the picturesque old courtyard of the\n\nlower castle, the main house with cellar, kitchen, and living spaces, the tithe barn and other outbuildings, and the\n\nestate, with numerous relics of the past. Â There are permanent exhibits on sleighs, carriages, church weathervanes,\n\nand historical building materials. Â After five years as a traveling exhibition, the Eifel Museums special exhibition\n\nEssens-Zeiten (Mealtimes) has been permanently housed at the castle. Â In addition, the lower castle is available\n\nfor gastronomic and cultural events, such as marriages, conferences, art projects, and exhibitions. Â It has a bakery\n\nwith a historical brick oven, a restaurant, and a civil registry office.\n\nThe upper castle was acquired by Christine and Christian Engels in 2000. Â It is a private residence but can be\n\nvisited by appointment. Â As of 2011 some rooms are available as vacation rentals. Â The whole castle complex is\n\ndivided into two parts: firstly, the lower castle, which includes various buildings, courtyards, open areas, and also\n\nthe attached land or meadow; and secondly, the upper castle, which also includes buildings, a courtyard, and open\n\nareas. Â Today the palatial manor house is in Renaissance style. Â It was created in 1661â63 by combining three\n\nmedieval residential towers into a single angled structure. Â The oldest architectural remnants in the castle are to\n\nbe found in the cellar of this building and in the vaults under the large terrace in front of it, and may date to the\n\nCarolingian era. Â On the ground floor, in addition to reception and dining rooms, there is a rustic estate kitchen.\n\nAbove this floor is a mezzanine level with appreciably lower ceilings, which formerly housed the actual living\n\nspaces for the owners. Â The upper floor above that contains three high-ceilinged formal rooms with remarkable\n\nsandstone chimneypieces.\n\nThe castle mill was originally a freestanding building outside the castle defenses. Â It was integrated into the castle\n\ncomplex only in the course of later extensions that resulted from the division of the castle. The mill ground wheat\n\nfor flour; the miller paid 5 malter of grain, 6 guilders and 8 albus in rent and for water usage. Â In addition, the lords\n\nof the castle were permitted to have their grains ground free at any time with no flour kept back by the miller.\n\nBy the early 20th century, electricity was being generated at the mill using the water; this was the origin of the\n\nlater power plant. Â Around 1920, a large wood-fired stone oven, a so-called KÃ¶nigswinter oven, was installed,\n\nwhich provided the bread needed by the many people living and working at the castle. Â The oven has been restored\n\nand is again in use, providing baked goods for purchase and for consumption at the castle.\n\nOn the western side of the castle there is still a large meadow area, bordered in part by the Oosbach stream and in\n\npart by a millstream that branches off from it. Â The Oosbach originally fed the moats and later provided water to\n\ndrive the mill and the electrical generator. In addition the water was used for the animals, to farm fish, and for\n\nfirefighting. Â The millstream has largely been preserved and it has been possible to briefly reactivate it. Â The meadow\n\narea has been restored to showcase various biota and sculptures and provide locations for relaxation and nature\n\nobservation. In 2004 it was featured in the Trier garden show.\n\nThe lower castle grounds also include the historic approach to the castle (the Im Hofpesch path and the millrace\n\npath, both with old trees along them) and the upper stretch of the millstream and the sluice that diverts the water\n\nfrom the Oosbach.

Â It is one of Germany's best preserved castles. Â c1200 the bailiwick was taken over by the Lords of LÃ¼tzelbach, who then called themselves Lords (Herren von) of Breuberg. Â Only the keep and the late Romanesque portal of the main castle can be dated to the earliest construction phase of the castle. Â Residential buildings from this time have not survived, although individual walls from earlier buildings could be built in the buildings of the core castle.\n\nIn 1323, the male family line of the house of Breuberg died out with Eberhard III of Breuberg. Â From the 14th century, the castle was expanded many times, making it today a journey through the building styles of the last 850 years. Â Half of the property went to Konrad von Trimberg, a quarter each to the Counts of Wertheim and the Lords of Weinsberg. Â The fragmentation of the property becomes clear in the complicated ownership structure of the following time: In 1336 three quarters of the castle belonged to Wertheim, Trimberg and the Lords of Eppstein each held an eighth. Â In 1337 a partition agreement was signed in which it was recorded which party belonged to which parts of the castle and who had to maintain them. Â Essential parts like the well were maintained jointly.\n\nIn 1446, Count Wilhelm of Wertheim sold Count Philipp the Elder of Katzenelnbogen his share of the castle for 2400 Gulden. Â The castle played an important role in territorial policy from Wertheim's side, which is why the counts endeavored to gradually acquire it in full. Â But it was not until 1497 under Count Michael II that this succeeded with the purchase of the last stake. Â A little more than 50 years, between 1497 and 1556, the Counts of Wertheim owned the castle completely. Â Many construction measures took place during this time, especially the adaptation for the use firearms with the construction of the gun turrets and the cannon platform (SchÃ¼tt). Â New buildings were erected in the castle, such as the Wertheim armory (1528) and parts of the gateway . Breuberg thus became a small Wertheim residence, but also a fortress against the ambitions of larger sovereigns such as the Landgraves of Hesse, the Archbishops of Mainz or the Electoral Palatinate. Â The town of Neustadt was founded as a settlement below the castle as early as 1378.\n\nAfter the Count of Wertheim died out in 1556, the castle was divided again. Â It was then half owned by the Counts of Erbach (from 1747 on the Erbach-SchÃ¶nberg line ) and the Counts of Stolberg-KÃ¶nigstein. Â At the beginning of the 17th century, the stolberg-KÃ¶nigstein part of the castle fell to the Counts of LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim (later LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg ).\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Breuberg Castle changed hands several times. Â Half of the fortress belonged to sovereigns with different loyalties. Â With the advance of Gustaf to Franconia, the Protestant Counts of Erbach took over the castle completely. Â The Swedes used Count Gottfried von Erbach as commandant, who damaged the opposing party so much that the County of Erbach later had to pay high compensation. Â He died in 1635, and was buried in the castle chapel, where his sarcophagus was rediscovered in the 19th century. Â In the course of the advance of the imperial army after the Battle of NÃ¶rdlingen, ownership changed back to the LÃ¶wensteiners with Count Ferdinand Carl von LÃ¶wenstein as commander. Â In 1637, the Swedes under Jakob von Ramsay, governor of the Hanau Fortress, tried to besiege the castle but were unsuccessful. Â The Schwedenschanze north of Wolferhof is a reminder of the event. Â In 1639 the Erbachische Rat, Dr. Backyards was shot by a LÃ¶wenstein mercenary as he waited outside the gate to be admitted. Â In 1644 the Counts of Erbach were able to recapture Breuberg in a surprise attack and kept it occupied until the Peace of Westphalia.\n\nIn the larger armed conflicts of modern times, such as the Palatinate and Austrian War of Succession, the fortress was still secured by troops. Â However, the castle quickly lost its importance as the seat of power. Â It was used as an administrative and official seat, which was only moved to Neustadt in the first half of the 19th century. Â Before that, the castle served briefly from the Napoleonic period and belonged to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt from 1810 to around 1850. Â It served as the seat of the Breuberg district, the predecessor of the Neustadt district. Â After that, a toy factory was housed in the castle at the end of the 19th century. Â A manufacturer from Mainz had African animals made from wood there. Â Since he had a brother in the USA, these were shipped and sold in New York in the USA. Â This ended with the First World War. Â The castle stood empty for a short time, but remained in the possession of the Erbach (later Erbach-SchÃ¶nberg, Protestant) and LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim (later the LÃ¶wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg line, Catholic).\n\nIn 1919, the German Youth Hostel Association, which had belonged to the Hitler Youth from 1940 , acquired the castle, making it the property of the German Reich. Â During the Second World War, slave laborers were housed there, commemorated by a plaque at the entrance gate and incisions in Cyrillic script on the keep. 1946, Breuberg Castle became the property of the newly founded State of Hesse by order of the military government. Â The castle continues to serve as a youth hostel, and was renovated in 1987.\n\nThe oldest part of the castle complex is the main castle on a pentagonal floor plan with remains of the moat and the curtain wall, the cuboid keep and the columned portal at the gate of the main castle. Â The ring wall the inner castle with characteristic small cuboids should also belong to the earliest times. Â With 1900 mÂ², the core castle is unusual for the 13th century. Â The mean value for this time is around 1000 mÂ². Â The later buildings from the 15th to 17th centuries were placed on top of the older wall. Because no battlements were bricked up, it was concluded that the curtain wall had none. Â (Elmar Brohl: Fortresses in Hessen.

Â It is one of the largest castle ruins in the western Rhineland-Palatine. Â Hardenburg Castle dominates the green hills along the road which follows the Eisenach River through the thick forested mountains of the Pflazer Wald Nature Park between Bad Durkheim and Kaiserslautern. Â The fortress castle at Hardenburg (not to be confused with Hardenberg in Lower-Saxony) was first constructed by the Counts of Leiningen-Hardenburg, on land belonging to the Benedictine monastery at Limburg a few miles away when Count Friedrich I of Leiningen wasgranted governorship of the abbey by King Phillip of Swabia in 1205. Â The abbots initially protested the building of the castle, but relented to the protectorship in 1249.\n\nAs the Leiningen family grew in stature and power (Englandâs Queen Victoria was a half-sister of Prince Karl of Leiningen in later days), the original 13th Century fortress was reconstructed in the Renaissance period into the large castle it appears today. Â It was built in red stone, typical of the area like the Burg Frankenstein ruin further west. Â Hardenburg Castle is probably best known for its âball towerâ with cannon balls imbedded in its stone masonry to impress any attackers of its impregnability to artillery. Â Unfortunately, it wasnât really. Â The castle was taken by Napoleonâs army and most of its buildings were destroyed in 1795, leaving the great walls remaining. Â The Princes of Leiningen had already moved their primary residence to a more comfortable Baroque palace in Bad Durkheim.\n\nA vaulted ceiling cellar and some other rooms are most of what remains of the living quarters of the castle. Â A distinctive feature of the castle is the great broad formal terrace of the former residence over-looking the wooded canyon of the Eisenach. Â It is located 30 minutes from Kaiserslautern. Â There is a road leading to a parking area near the ruin, and a hiking trail leads up from the village below from the parking lot of the modern town hall. Â The approach to the castle is fairly unique as the walking trail leads through a tunnel under the walls and along the slope above the river road below. Â The castle is open daily with a nominal admission charge. Â (Alexander Thon, ed.

Â Between 1392 and 1503,\n\nthe fortifications were extended around the entire castle hill. Â When the work was completed, Burghausen Castle became\n\nthe strongest fortress of the region. Â Burghausen Castle in Burghausen, Upper Bavaria, Germany, is the longest castle\n\ncomplex in the world (1.051 km).\n\nThe castle hill was settled as early as the Bronze Age. Â The castle (which was founded before 1025) was transferred\n\nto the Wittelsbach family after the death of the last count of Burghausen, Gebhard II, in 1168. Â In 1180 they were\n\nappointed dukes of Bavaria and the castle was extended under Duke Otto I of Wittelsbach. Â With the first partition\n\nof Bavaria in 1255, Burghausen Castle became the second residence of the dukes of Lower Bavaria, the main\n\nresidence being Landshut. Â The work on the main castle commenced in 1255 under Duke Henry XIII (1253â1290).\n\nIn 1331 Burghausen and its castle passed to Otto IV, Duke of Lower Bavaria.\n\nUnder the dukes of Bavaria-landshut (1392-1503), the fortifications were extended around the entire castle hill.\n\nBeginning with Margarete of Austria, the deported wife of the despotic Duke Henry XVI (1393â1450), the castle\n\nbecame the residence of the Duke's consorts and widows, and also a stronghold for the ducal treasures. Â In 1447\n\nLouis VI, Duke of Bavaria, died in the castle as Henry's prisoner. Â Under Duke Georg of Bavaria (1479â1503) the\n\nwork was completed and Burghausen Castle became the strongest fortress of the region.\n\nAfter the reunification of Bavaria in 1505 with the Landshut War of Succession, the castle had military importance,\n\nand due to the threat of the Ottoman Empire, it was subsequently modernised. Â During the Thirty Years; War, Gustav\n\nHorn was kept imprisoned in the castle from 1634 to 1641. Â After the Treaty of Teschen in 1779, Burghausen\n\nCastle became a border castle. Â During the Napoleonic Wars the castle suffered some destruction. Â The 'Liebenwein\n\ntower' was occupied by the painter Maximilian Liebenwein from 1899 until his death. Â He decorated the interior in\n\nthe Art Nouveau style.\n\nThe Gothic castle comprises the main castle with the inner courtyard and five outer courtyards. Â The outermost\n\npoint of the main castle is the Palas with the ducal private rooms. Â Today it houses the castle museum, including\n\nlate Gothic paintings of the Bavarian State Picture Collection. Â On the town side of the main castle next to the\n\ndonjon are the gothic inner Chapel of St. Elizabeth (1255) and the DÃ¼rnitz (knights' hall) with its two vaulted halls.\n\nOpposite the DÃ¼rnitz are the wings of the Duchess' residence.\n\nThe first outer courtyard protected the main castle and also included the stables, the brewery and the bakery. Â The\n\nsecond courtyard houses the large Arsenal building (1420) and the gunsmith's tower. Â This yard is protected by the\n\ndominant Saint George's Gate (1494). Â The Grain Tower and the Grain Measure Tower were used for stabling and\n\nto store animal food; they belong to the third courtyard. Â The main sight of the fourth courtyard is the late Gothic\n\nouter Chapel of St. Hedwig (1479â1489). Â The court officials and craftsmen worked and lived in the fifth courtyard,\n\nwhich was once protected by a strong fortification. Â In 1800 this fortification was destroyed by the French under\n\nMichel Ney. Â The Pulverturm (\"Powder Tower\", constructed before 1533) protected the castle in the western valley\n\nnext to the WÃ¶hrsee lake, an old backwater of the river. Â A battlement connects this tower with the main castle.\n\n(Alexander Z Photo)\n\nBerghausen Castle, maincourt from the 11th century.\n\n(Bwag Photo)\n\n(Alexander D.

Â It was founded in 1170, and like the town whose creation was closely\n\nlinked to the palace, goes back to Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa). Â The palace enabled the expansion of imperial\n\nterritory along an important long-distance highway, the Via Regia.\n\nConstruction of the palace likely took place a few years before the official founding of the royal town in 1170.\n\nThere may have been an earlier castle on the site that belonged to the Counts of Selbold-Gelnhausen. Â The\n\nconstruction of the palace was probably managed by the Counts of BÃ¼dingen, who erected the castle of BÃ¼dingen\n\nas their own residence nearby.\n\nIn 1180, the imperial palace at Gelnhausen was the venue for the great imperial court or Hoftag of Gelnhausen, at\n\nwhich Henry the Lion was put on trial in his absence and his imperial fiefs redistributed. Â In the years that followed,\n\nfurther imperial courts were convened at Gelnhausen. Â The now ruined palas may have been built for use as an\n\nassembly hall. Â Evidence of a large number of different stonemasons engaged in the construction suggests a\n\nrelatively large number of labourers working on the building site at the same time and thus a rapid pace of construction.\n\nDuring the Hohenstaufen era, the palace was an Imperial Castle (Reichsburg), had a burgrave and Burgmannen.\n\nIts estate included BÃ¼dingen Forest, which the castle's occupants still retained timber rights (for construction and\n\nfirewood) until the 19th century. Â The decline of the palace began as early as the 14th century when, in 1349, Emperor\n\nCharles IV (HRR) enfeoffed it, together with the town, to the Counts of Schwarzburg and never reclaimed it. Â In\n\n1431, the Count of Hanau and Count Palatine Louis III procured the palace and town from Count Henry of\n\nSchwarzburg. Â At the end of the 16th century, the Counts of Isenburg in Birstein took over the burgrave's office,\n\nbut did not reside at the castle. Â During the Thirty Years' War, the town and palace were severely damaged and\n\nImperial and Swedish troops razed down its main building.\n\nAfter the extinction of the House of Hanau in 1736, Gelnhausen fell to the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel. Â The\n\npalace was then used as a quarry until 1811. Â The castle chapel had to be partly demolished due to its dilapidated\n\ncondition. Â Around 1810, the palace became one of the first buildings from the epoch of Romanesque architecture\n\nin Germany that attracted the interest of art-loving scholars.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the first safety measures were carried out to preserve\n\nthe remains of the palace for posterity. Â Likewise, it was not until the end of the 19th century that the previously\n\nindependent municipality of Burg was dissolved and integrated into the town of Gelnhausen. Â Today, the palace\n\nbelongs to the state of Hesse and is managed by the Administration of State Castles and Gardens for Hesse.\n\nAlong with its attached castle museum, it is open to the public.

Â It is\n\nthe administrative centre of the district of Goslar and is located on the northwestern slopes of the Harz mountain\n\nrange. Â Iron ore has been common in the Harz region since Roman times; the earliest known evidences for quarying\n\nand smelting date back to the 3rd century AD. Â The settlement on the Gose creek was first mentioned in a 979 deed\n\nissued by Emperor Otto II. Â It was located in the Saxon homelands of the Ottonian dynasty and a royal palace (KÃ¶nigspfalz)\n\nmay already have existed at the site. Â It became even more important when extensive silver deposits were discovered\n\nat the nearby Rammelsberg, today a mining museum.\n\nWhen Otto's descendant Henry II began to convene Imperial synods at the Goslar palace from 1009 onwards, Goslar\n\ngradually replaced the Royal palace of Werla as a central place of assembly in the Saxon lands. Â This development\n\nwas enforced by the Salian (Franconian) emperors. Â Conrad II, after his election as King of the Romans, celebrated\n\nChristmas 1024 in Goslar and had the foundations laid for the new Imperial Palace (Kaiserpfalz Goslar) the next year.\n\nGoslar became the favourite residence of Conrad's son Henry III who stayed at the palace about twenty times. Â Here\n\nhe received King Peter of Hungary, as well as the emissaries of Prince Yaroslav of Kiev, and here he appointed\n\nbishops and dukes. Â His son and successor Henry IV was born here on 11 November 1050. Â Henry also had Goslar\n\nCathedral built and consecrated by Archbishop Herman of Cologne in 1051. Â Shortly before his death in 1056, Emperor\n\nHenry III met with Pope Victor II in the church, emphasizing the union of secular and ecclesiastical power. Â His heart\n\nwas buried in Goslar, his body in the Salian family vault in Speyer Cathedral. Â Only the northern porch of the cathedral\n\nhas survived, as the main building was torn down in the early 19th century.\n\nUnder Henry IV, Goslar remained a centre of Imperial rule; however, conflicts intensified such as in the violent\n\nPrecedence Dispute at Pentecost 1063. Â While Henry aimed to secure the enormous wealth deriving from the\n\nRammlesberg silver mines as a royal demesne, the dissatisfaction of local nobles escalated with the Saxon Rebellion\n\nin 1073â75. Â In the subsequent Great Saxon Revolt, the Goslar citizens sided with anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden,\n\nwho held a princely assembly there in 1077, and with Hermann of Salm, who was crowned king in Goslar by\n\nArchbishop Siegfried of Mainz on 26 December 1081. Â This brought Goslar the status of an Imperial City.\n\nIn the Spring of 1105, Henry V convened the Saxon estates at Goslar, to gain support for the deposition of his father\n\nHenry IV. Â Elected king in the following year, he held six Imperial Diets at the Goslar Palace during his rule. Â The\n\ntradition was adopted by his successor Lothair II and by the Hohenstaufen rulers, Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nAfter his election in 1152, King Frederick appointed the Welf duke Henry the Lion Imperial as the Vogt (bailiff) of\n\nthe Goslar mines. Â In spite of this appointment, the dissatisfied duke besieged the town. Â A a meeting in Chiavenna\n\nin 1173, the duke demanded his enfeoffment with the estates in turn for his support on Barbarossa's Italian campaigns.\n\nWhen Henry the Lion was finally declared deposed in 1180, he had the Rammelsberg mines destroyed.\n\nGoslar's importance as an Imperial residence began to decline under the rule of Barbarossa's descendants. Â During\n\nthe German throne dispute, the Welf king Otto IV laid siege to the town in 1198, but had to yield to the forces of his\n\nHohenstaufen rival Philip of Swabia. Â Goslar was again stormed and plundered by Otto's troops in 1206. Â Frederick II\n\nheld the last Imperial Diet here; with the Great Interregnum upon his death in 1250, Goslar's Imperial era ended.\n\nWhen the Emperors withdrew from Northern Germany, civil liberties in Goslar were strengthened. Â Market rights\n\ndate back to 1025. Â A municipal council (Rat) was first mentioned in 1219. Â The citizens strived for control of the\n\nRammelsberg silver mines and in 1267 joined the Hanseatic League. Â In addition to mining in the Upper Harz region,\n\ncommerce and trade in Gose beer, later also slate and vitriol, became important. Â By 1290 the council had obtained\n\nVogt rights, confirming Goslar's status as a free imperial city. Â In 1340 its citizens were vested with Heeschild rights\n\nby Emperor Louis the Bavarian. Â The Goslar town law set an example for numerous other municipalities, like the\n\nGoslar mining law codified in 1359.\n\nEarly modern times saw both a mining boom and rising conflicts with the Welf Dukes of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg,\n\nmainly with Prince Henry V of WolfenbÃ¼ttel, who seized the Rammelsberg mines and extended Harz forests in 1527.\n\nThough a complaint was successfully lodged with the Reichskammergericht by the citizens of Goslar, a subsequent\n\ngruelling feud with the duke lasted for decades. Â Goslar was temporarily placed under Imperial ban, while the\n\nProtestant Reformation was introduced in the city by theologian Nicolaus von Amsdorf, who issued a first church\n\nconstitution in 1531. Â To assert independence, in 1536 the citizens joined the Schmalkaldic League against the\n\nCatholic policies of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. Â The Schmalkaldic forces occupied the WolfenbÃ¼ttel lands of\n\nHenry V, but after they were defeated by Imperial forces in 1547 at the Batle of MÃ¼hlberg, the Welf duke continued his reprisals.\n\nIn 1577 the Goslar citizens signed the Lutheran Formula of Concord. Â After years of continued skirmishes, they\n\nfinally had to grant Duke Henry and his son Julius extensive mining rights which ultimately edged out the city\n\ncouncil. Â Nevertheless, several attempts by the Brunswick dukes to incorporate the Imperial city were rejected.\n\nGoslar and its economy was hit hard by the Thirty Years' War, mainly by the Kipper und Wipper financial crisis\n\nin the 1620s which led to several revolts and pogroms. Â Facing renewed aggression by Duke Christian the Younger\n\nof Brunswick, the citizens sought support from the Imperial military leaders Tilly and Wallenstein. Â The city was\n\noccupied by the Swedish forces of King Gustavus Adolphus from 1632 to 1635. Â In 1642 a peace agreement was\n\nreached between Emperor Ferdinand III and the Brunswick duke Augustus the Younger. Â The hopes of the Goslar\n\ncitizens to regain the Rammelsberg mines were not fulfilled.\n\nGoslar remained loyal to the Imperial authority, solemnly celebrating each accession of a Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nWhile strongly referring to its great medieval traditions, the city continuously decreased in importance and got\n\ninto rising indebtedness. Â Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stayed at Goslar in 1777.\n\nFirst administrative reforms were enacted by councillors of the Siemens family. Â In spite of this, the status of\n\nImperial immediacy was finally lost, when Goslar was annexed by Prussian forces during the Napoleonic Wars\n\nin 1802, and confirmed by the German Mediatisation the next year. Â Under Prussian rule, further reforms were\n\npushed ahead by councillor Christian Wilhelm von Dohn. Â Goslar was temporarily part of the Kingdom of\n\nWestphalia upon the Prussian defeat at the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Â Goslar finally was assigned to the newly\n\nestablished Kingdom of Hanover by resolution of the Vienna Congress. Â The cathedral was sold and torn down\n\nbetween 1820 and 1822. Â Goslar again came under Prussian rule after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Â It became\n\na popular retirement residence (Pensionopolis) and a garrison town of the Prussian Army. Â The Hohenzollern kings\n\nand emperors had the Imperial Palace restored, including the mural paintings by Hermann Wislicenus.\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power in 1933, Reich Minister Richard Walther DarrÃ© made Goslar the seat of the\n\nagricultural ReichsnÃ¤hrstand corporation. Â In 1936, the city obtained the title of Reichsbauernstadt. Â In the course\n\nof Germany's rearmament, a Luftwaffe airbase was built north of the town and several war supplier companies\n\nwere located in the vicinity, including subcamps of the Buchenwald and Neuengamme concentration camps.\n\nNevertheless, the historic town escaped strategic bombing during the Second World War.\n\nGoslar was part of the British occupation zone from 1945, and the site of a displaced persons camp. Â During the\n\nCold War era, because the city stood near the inner German border, it was a major garrison town for the West\n\nGerman army army, border police and French Forces in Germany. Â After the fall of the Berlin wall, the barracks\n\nwere vacated and a major economic factor was lost. Â The Rammelberg mines were finally closed in 1988, after a\n\nmillennial history of mining.

At 441 m\n\n(1,447 ft) above sea level, it is the highest castle in the county of Lahn-Dill and a very visible landmark.\n\nThe hill castle was first recorded in 1160. Â In 1298 it was destroyed by the counts of Nassau and Solms, along with\n\nLichtenstein, which was not rebuilt. Â In 1315 it was enfeoffed by the House of Habsburg (Albert I had purchased the\n\ncastle from Kraft of Greifenstein) to the Counts of Nassau. Â After having several owners, it had deteriorated by 1676.\n\nIt was then converted into a Baroque schloss by William Maurice of Solms-Greifenstein. Â After the counts moved\n\nto Braunfels in 1693, the site fell into ruins.\n\nIn 1969 the castle ruins were gifted to the Greifenstein Society, who have since looked after the preservation of the\n\nsite, which is open to the public and incorporates a restaurant. Â Since 1995, its restoration has also been supported\n\nby the Federal Republic of Germany, because it has been classified as a Monument of National Significances\n\n(Denkmal von nationaler Bedeutung).\n\nThe circular walk across the castle terrain leads to a gaol with torture implements, weapons and a wine cellar, living\n\nrooms and a twin-towered bergfried accessible via a spiral staircase. Â On the pointed roof of the Brother Tower\n\n(Bruderturm) there is a gryphon (Greif, a reference to the name of the castle), which serves as a weather vane.\n\nThere is a peal of three bells in the tower, with strike tones of F#1, A1 and C2.\n\nAttractions include the Village and Castle Museum (Dorf- und Burgmuseum), one of the few double chapels in\n\nGermany. Â The Chapel of St. Catherine was built in 1462 as a fortified church in the Gothic style. Â When the castle\n\nwas converted into the Baroque style the castle courtyard was filled with earth with the result that, today, the chapel\n\nis below ground level. Â It contains frescoes and arrow slits, as well as casemates with vaulted ceilings and fighting\n\nrooms.

Â The castle was never destroyed and has been\n\ncontinuously inhabited for almost 800 years, from the Gemmingen-Guttenberg line of the Barons of Gemmingen\n\nsince the middle of the 15th century. Â The facility houses the Greifenwarte as well as a castle museum and a restaurant. Â Guttenberg Castle is located near Horneck am Necker, across from Gundelsheim with Horneck Castle\n\nand is north of Bad Wimpfen on a mountain spur between the Neckar and MÃ¼hlbachtal valleys.\n\nOn 1 May 1393, Archbishop Konrad II of Mainz donated a new chapel in MÃ¼hlbach, prope castrum nominatum\n\nGutenberg, near Guttenberg Castle. Â This was the first mention of the castle, which dates from the first half of the\n\n13th century. Â It belonged to the Lords of Weinsberg as a fief of the bishops of Worms. Â The von Weinsbergs may\n\nhave built the castle on behalf of their liege lord. Â The Bishop of Worms was concerned with securing customs\n\nrevenue on the long-distance routes in his territory.\n\nIn a document dated 2 December 1449, the Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg confirmed that he was the guardian of the sons of\n\nthe deceased Imperial Treasurer Konrad IX. Â von Weinsberg sold Guttenberg Castle, along with the associated\n\nvillages on the Neckar river, including all rights, uses and affiliations for 6000 Rhenish guilders to Hans Rich von\n\nGemmingen. Â With this purchase, Hans the Rich, became the founder of the Gemmingen-Guttenberg line, which\n\nstill owns the castle today. Â With the partition agreement of 1 February 1518, Hans' grandson Dietrich von Gemmingen inherited the new headquarters of the family. Â Under him, the castle played a role in the Reformation\n\nperiod, including a providing a place for a religious conference in the Eucharistic controversy of the reformers.\n\nThere is no evidence of a siege in the Middle Ages, and the castle was not damaged in the German Peasants' War. Â\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the Catholic troops under Lieutenant General Johann T'Serclais vaon Tilly defeated\n\nthe Protestant army under the Margrave of baden in May 1622, in the costly Battle of Wimpfen (1,500 to 2,000 dead\n\non each side). Â In the Palatinate War of Succession, King Louis XIV of France systematically devastated the Electoral\n\nPalatinate and the adjacent areas in 1689. Â Although troops always marched through the region, Guttenberg Castle\n\nwas spared in all wars due to fortunate circumstances.\n\nThe castle passed through the hands of various branches of the Lords of Gemmingen-Guttenberg. Â Philipp von\n\nGemmingen (1702â1785), who was favoured in an inheritance division, survived his only son, so that the castle\n\ncame to the branch Bonfeld-Lower Castle. Â Beginning with the sons of Ludwig Eberhard von Gemmingen-\n\nGuttenberg (1750â1841), the castle was owned by a condominium of several shareholders until 1932 .\n\nThe tourism at the castle was founded by Gustav von Gemmingen-Guttenberg (1897â1973), who took over the\n\ncastle's forestry operations in 1923 and founded the sawmill in NeckarmÃ¼hlbach. Â In 1949 he set up the castle\n\nmuseum and in 1950 the castle tavern, which was expanded in the following year, in the porch. Â The arrival of the\n\nGerman police station in 1971 is also due to Gustav von Gemmingen-Guttenberg. Â After the Greifenwarte moved\n\nin, the number of tourists visiting the castle increased considerably. Â In 1972 the castle tavern was expanded to\n\ninclude a self-service restaurant. Â Gustav von Gemmingen's son Christoph von Gemmingen-Guttenberg (1930â1999)\n\nand his wife Gabriele continued the administration and expansion of the castle.\n\nOn the street leading west of the castle through the outer bailey, there are buildings dating from the 15th to 17th\n\ncenturies. Â The long, two-story quarry stone building from the 15th century is the main structure. Â The adjoining low,\n\npartly timber-framed building directs the view to the gate with the two towers, the entrance gate to the outer bailey\n\nin the old days. Â The path still leads past the castle chapel into the valley. Â The pointed arch, by a secured gate dates\n\nfrom the 2nd half of the 15th century and was closed by two wooden rotating leaves. Â The second gate opposite,\n\nthrough which one can visit the castle today, also had its rotating wing on the side facing the outer bailey. Â The\n\nouter bailey behind its wall was therefore lockable and did not serve to protect the inner bailey. Â The wall surrounding\n\nthe outer bailey was only opened in modern times because of the driveway on both sides.\n\nOn the way to the main gate of the castle, the mighty shield wall and the 40 m high keep, are impressive. Â They\n\nare located behind the Zwingermauer with a late Gothic round arch frieze that surrounds the entire inner castle.\n\nThe older wall probably from the 13th century. Â It was built with five round towers in the 2nd half of the 15th\n\ncentury, under the Lords of Gemmingen. The shield wall is made of quarry stone masonry. Â A section in the old\n\ncurtain wall was renewed in the 14th century, and increased in strength at different time intervals.\n\nThe basement of the keep, made of roughly hewn humpback blocks, tdates from the 2nd quarter of the 13th century.\n\nA short flight of stairs leads from the battlement above the shield wall to the entrance floor. Â The room with an toilet\n\nniche and traces of a fireplace was habitable for a gate guard. Â The defence level above has window niches on all\n\nfour sides with closable openings for small guns. Â The two unused floors below the entrance floor had no other\n\nfunction at the time of construction than to raise the tower. Â This keep never served as a dungeon. Â The keep with\n\nits high entrance was not designed to be a place of retreat in the event of an attack, but was a place of observation\n\nfor the castle guard. Â The two stories above the cornice were added in the late 15th century, after the castle passed\n\nto the Lords of Gemmingen.\n\nThe stone bridge over the neck ditch leads to the main gate, dated to 1572, originally ended a few meters in front\n\nof the gate and was lengthened in old times by a drawbridge which has now disappeared . Â The weakly fortified\n\nmain gate was built in the late 16th century into the outer wall built in the 15th century. Â The second gate was\n\nadded in the 15th century in the older Zwingermauer, which is still visible at this point. Â The narrow inner courtyard\n\nis bounded in the south by the shield wall, in the east and in the west by the residential buildings.\n\nSoon after 1449, a four-story residential building was built behind the western curtain wall. Â This building, preserved\n\nin its outer walls, was modernized in the 16th century and received a baroque portal in 1741. Â The former residential\n\nbuilding, which now houses the castle museum, is still in this state today.\n\nOn the site of a smaller previous building, probably dating from the 14th century, the new eastern residential building\n\nwas built in the 16th century. The masonry of the building, which was modernized in the Baroque period, partly\n\ncomes from these old buildings. Â A new wing was added to the building in the 18th century, along with a baroque\n\nstaircase from 1776. Â The stone balustrade that surrounds the roof of the keep also dates to the late 18th century.\n\nSince then, the lords of the castle used the keep as an observation tower, with a view over the Neckar valley to\n\nHornberg Castle and Horneck Castle. Â The medieval hilltop castle with its keep from the Staufer era was modernized\n\nagain and again still today it is a center of the extensive family of the lord of the castle.\n\nWhile the private rooms of the castle owners are in the eastern residential building, the castle museum is in the\n\nwestern one. Â Here the visitor is provided with information bout knighthood and medieval jurisdiction. Â The keep\n\ncan be climbed during the opening hours of the museum and offers a wonderful view over the Neckar valley. Â\n\nGuttenberg Castle is widely known for the accommodation of its bird sanctuary, the Greifenwarte.

Â The castle ruins stand 644.2 Â m above\n\nsea level, on the western shoulder of the Rechberg witness mountain, one of the Three Kaiser Mountains on the northern\n\nedge of the Swabian Alb.\n\nThe most likely builder of the castle was Ulrich von Rechenberg, first mentioned in a document in 1179. The\n\nHohenrechberg Castle was built between 1200 and 1250. Â It was mentioned for the first time in 1355. Â Hohenrechberg\n\nCastle served as a Staufer Dienstmannenburg, and was the ancestral seat of the later Counts of Rechberg. Â It formed\n\nthe historical and administrative center of their dominion.\n\nFrom 1448 to 1450 soldiers from the imperial cities of SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd and SchwÃ¤bisch Hall plundered the area\n\naround the castle, but did not dare to attack it. Â During the Peasants' War in 1525, the Hohenrechberg was spared\n\nfrom the pillaging farmers. Â However, the castle residents could not prevent the Lorch and Adelberg monasteries and\n\nthe nearby Hohenstaufen Castle from being burned down. Â In 1546 the Schmalkaldische Bund moved up in front of the\n\ncastle, but it remained intact. Â In contrast, SchwÃ¤bisch GmÃ¼nd was taken.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt and expanded several times. Â Until 1585 the rulers ruled directly from their ancestral castle. Â\n\nThe castle was occupied by the French in 1648 during the Thirty Years' War and in 1796 during the French Revolutionary\n\nWars. Â They did not destroy it, but in 1865 the castle was ruined by a fire caused by lightning.\n\nThe ruin has been an outstanding sight on the Staufer road since 1977. Â Up until 1986, the castle was owned by the\n\nnoble family. Â At that time it was sold to a private citizen in GÃ¶ppingen. Â The irregular, polygonal castle complex has\n\na ring wall with humpback blocks, a Hohenstaufen palaces next to the rectangular projecting gate and a 30-meter-deep\n\ncastle well.

Â The Kasselburg's 37-metre-high, double tower, functioned\n\nas a gate tower and tower house. Â Its origins are not precisely clear. Â Up until the present day, it had been assumed\n\nthat the lords of Blankenheim had built it shortly after 1335. Â Structural investigations, however, have shown that\n\nthe tower underwent several phases of construction and is not just the work of one architect. Â The gate probably lost\n\nits guarding function with the expansion of the castle from 1452. Â YThe large outer bailey, with its burgmann houses\n\nand domestic buildings, date from that period.\n\nThe double tower is open to the public and has a good view of the surrounding area but, despite its size, is not a\n\nbergfried (fighting tower). Â The latter, built around 1200, is smaller and stands in the eastern part of the inner bailey.\n\nIt has a square ground plan and was turned into a tower house in the 14th century. Â A nearly 33-metre-long palas,\n\nwhich dates to the 14th century is part of the inner court. Â The castle was built in the 12th century. Â Its owners may\n\nhave been the lords of Castel, but this is not entirely certain. Â The castle was first mentioned in 1291 as the Castilburg.\n\nIn 1314, it is called Castelberch.\n\nThe owners prior to 1335 are unknown, although Gerhard V of Blankenheim became its owner following a division\n\nof inheritance in that year and thus founded the Blankenheim-Kasselburg line. Â In 1406, this line of Blankenheims,\n\nwhich had been elevated to the countship, died out with Count Gerhard VII. Â The castle then passed by marriage to\n\nWilliam I of Loen and thus to Heinsberg.\n\nOther owners followed, including the Counts of the Mark, Dukes of Arenberg Prince-Electors of Trier. Â Many\n\nspecial interest groups have claimed the Kasselburg for themselves throughout history, so that in 1674 the Imperial\n\nChamber Court of Wetzlar was called upon to put an end to the property disputes. Â When the judges awarded the\n\ncastle to the dukes of Arenberg, the buildings soon served as barracks for the Duke of Arenberg's artillery troops.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the decline of the castle. Â In the 18th century it was still temporarily the seat of an\n\nArenberg forester, but by 1744 it was described as dilapidated.\n\nAfter France seized the castle in 1794, it went to the Prussians in 1815. Â An impulse to rescue the ruin came\n\nunexpectedly from King Frederick William IV in 1838. Â After a visit he initiated repair work, and after the completion\n\nof the railway line from Cologne to Trier, the railway company donated 1,000 talers to open up the then already famous\n\ndouble tower in order to offer its passengers a view.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the state historic preservation authorities carried out further restoration. Â The\n\nCastle Administration of Rhineland-Palatinate, who took over Kasselburg in 1946, also had conservation measures\n\ncarried out. In the meantime, the site has been placed under the care of the Directorate for Castles, Palaces and Ancient\n\nMonuments of the General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate, since 1998 the successors to the\n\nformer Castle Administration.

Â The castle KÃ¶nigstein is part of the Hessian town of the same name in Hochtaunuskreis in Hess. Â It is one of the largest castle ruins in Germany, standing 407 Â m above sea level on the western edge of the old town of KÃ¶nigstein. Â The north and west slopes of the castle hill are forested, further to the west there are undeveloped landscape areas. Â The Falkenstein Castle ruins are in the northeast, about 1.5 kilometers as the crow flies, and Kronberg Castle lies to the southeast, about 4 kilometers as the crow flies.\n\nThere is a legend that King Clovis came (c4th to 5th Century) to this castle site and a virgin appeared who convinced him to become a Christian. Â After he became one, he founded a castle there, although none of this is documented. Â The oldest building remains on the castle hill from an older settlement date from the 10th or 11th century. Â The oldest parts of the inner castle, the so-called herringbone masonry, dates to the first half of the 12th century. Â The NÃ¼rings, who died out in 1172, were the possible builders. Â After the end of the Staufer period, the castle underwent an energetic expansion under the Falkensteiners. Â The lower floors of the keep date from the first decades of the 14th century. Â It has been raised several times over the years and is now 34 meters high. Â The castle served, especially from the beginning of the 14th century, to protect the important trade route between Frankfurt and Cologne.\n\nThe castle has been rebuilt and expanded many times over the centuries. Â In addition to the adaptation to the developing defence technology, the expansion into a Renaissance-era residential palace for the count of KÃ¶nigstein was promoted. Â In the 16th century, Count Eberhard IV von Eppstein and Ludwig zu Stolberg built the three mighty rondelles on the eastern flank, as well as the faÃ§ade on the eastern side of the inner castle.\n\nWhen the count family died out, the castle fell to the Electorate of Mainz in 1581, when it was used for military purposes. Â Archbishop Johann Philipp von SchÃ¶nborn initiated the last major expansion phase between 1660 and 1670, including the angular bastions on the south side.\n\nIn the First Coalition War, the French army under Custin, took Mainz on 21 October 1792 , and a few days later KÃ¶nigstein. Â After the reconquest of Frankfurt on 2 December Â by Prussian troops, part of the French forces withdrew to the KÃ¶nigstein Fortress, closely followed by the Prussians under the orders of General Friedrich Ludwig zu Hohenlohe. Â Hohenlohe occupied Oberursel, Falkenstein Castle, the city of Koenigstein and began bombarding the fortress from Falkenstein on 6 December. Â On 8 December, bombs thrown into it (the origin of which remains unclear) caused a fire in the city, which destroyed 80% of the houses. Â Since the fortress did not surrender even after being bombarded, it was enclosed. Â On 8 March 1793, the defenders finally surrendered. Â The 421 men and 14 officers captured were brought to the Ehrenbreitstein fortress.\n\nIn 1793 clubists, actual or supposed supporters of the Mainz Republic, were imprisoned in the cellars of Mainz Castle, among them Caroline BÃ¶hmer, who later became the \"Romantic Museum\" Caroline Schelling.\n\nDuring the coalition war, the castle was severely damaged in 1796, mainly due to a failed attempt at demolition. Â The destruction seen to day is likely to be largely due to the KÃ¶nigstein population, who obtained building materials for numerous houses in the present old town after 1796. Â The Duke of Nassau, to whom the castle fell after the Reichsdeputationshaupschluss, decided against rebuilding and allowed the demolition to continue for another twenty years.\n\nWhile the sovereignty of KÃ¶nigstein passed to Prussia in 1866, the castle remained the private property of Duke Adolph, who later became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Â He built his own small castle (today KÃ¶nigstein District Court) at the foot of the mountain (southeast corner). Â His daughter, Hilda von Nassau, gave the fortress ruins to the city of KÃ¶nigstein in 1922.\n\nThe castle, which is now owned by the city of KÃ¶nigstein, is open to visitors all year round. Â Both the castle tower and most of the cellars are accessible. Â One of the preserved vaulted cellars (the armoury cellars ) can also be rented for private events. Â In the old town of KÃ¶nigstein there is a castle museum with finds and a model of the castle. Â (Fortresses in Hessen.

Â It is one of the largest hilltop fortifications in Europe and sits atop the table hill of the same name. Â The 9.5 hectare rock plateau rises 240 metres above the Elbe and has over 50 buildings, some over 400 years old, that bear witness to the military and civilian life in the fortress. Â The rampart run of the fortress is 1,800 metres long with walls up to 42 metres high and steep sandstone faces. Â In the centre of the site is a 152.5 metre deep well, which is the deepest in Saxony and second deepest well in Europe. Â The fortress, which for centuries was used as a state prison, is still intact and is now one of Saxony's foremost tourist attractions, with 700,000 visitors per year.\n\nBy far the oldest written record of a castle on the KÃ¶nigstein is found in a deed by King Wenceslas I of Bohemia, dating to the year 1233, in which a witness is named as \"Burgrave Gebhard of Stein\". Â At that time the region was split between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Bishopric of Meissen. Â The medieval castle belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Its first full description as KÃ¶nigstein (\"King's Rock\") occurred in the Upper Lusatian Border Charter (Oberlausitzer Grenzurkunde) of 1241, that Wenceslas I \"in lapide regis\" (Lat.: at the rock of the king) sealed. Â In this charter the demarcation of the border between the Slavic Gauen of Milska (Upper Lusatia), Nisani (MeiÃen Depression) and Dacena (Tetschen region) was laid down. Â Because the KÃ¶nigstein lay left of the Elbe, it was independent of the three aforementioned Gauen.\n\nThe fortress was expanded by order of the Bohemian kings, into a fortified site that dominated the north of their territories, controlling the Elbe above Pirna. Â As the Elbe became more intensively used as a trade route, and an outpost of the strategically important Dohna Castle located in nearby MÃ¼glitz. After the king and later emperor, Charles IV had Eulau Castle, which dominated the southern region, destroyed in 1348 by townsfolk from Aussig, he spent from 5 to 19 August 1359 on the KÃ¶nigstein and signed the authority for shipping rights. Â The castle was pledged several times in the 50 years that followed, including to the Donins. Â Because this family were enemies of the margraves of MeiÃen, the latter finally captured the castle in 1408 during the Dohna Feud that had been raging since 1385. The transfer of ownership of the castle to the Margraviate of MeiÃen did not take place until 25 April 1459. Â It was finally completed once the Saxon-Bohemian border had been settled in the Treaty of Eger. Â Unlike the other rock castles in Saxon Switzerland the KÃ¶nigstein continued to be used by the Saxon dukes and prince-electors for military purposes. Â At one stage the KÃ¶nigstein was also a monastery. Â In 1516, Duke George the Bearded, a fierce opponent of the Reformation, founded a Celestine abbey on the KÃ¶nigstein, the Kloster des Lobes der Wunder Mariae. Â It closed again in 1524, and after the death of Duke George, Saxony became Evangelical.\n\nIt is likely that there had been a stone castle on the KÃ¶nigstein as early as the 12th century. Â The oldest surviving structure today is the castle chapel built at the turn of the 13th century. Â In the years 1563 to 1569 the 152.5 metre deep well was bored into the rock within the castle. Â Up until that point, the garrison of the KÃ¶nigstein had to obtain water from cisterns and by collecting rainwater. Â During the construction of the well some 8 cubic metres of water had to be removed from the shaft every day.\n\nBetween 1589 and 1591/97 Prince-Elector Christian I of Saxony and his successor had the castle developed into the strongest fortification in Saxony. Â The hitherto very jagged table hill was now surrounded with high walls. Â Buildings were erected, including the Gatehouse (Torhaus), the Streichwehr, the Old Barracks (Alte Kaserne), the Christiansburg Â (Friedrichsburg) and the Old Armoury (Altes Zeughaus). Â The second construction period followed from 1619 to 1681, during which inter alia the John George Bastion (Johann-Georgenbastion) was built in front of the Johann-Georgenburg.\n\nThe third construction period is seen as the time from 1694 to 1756, which included the expansion of the Old Barracks. From 1722 to 1725, at the behest of August the Strong, coopers under BÃ¶ttger built the enormous KÃ¶nigstein Wine Barrel (KÃ¶nigsteiner Weinfass), the greatest wine barrel in the world, in the cellar of the Magdalenenburg which had a capacity of 249,838 litres. Â It cost 8,230 thalers, 18 groschen and 9 pfennigs. Â The butt, which was once completely filled with country wine from the MeiÃen vineyards, had to be removed again in 1818 due to its poor condition.\n\nBecause of BÃ¶ttger, KÃ¶nigstein Fortress is also the site where European porcelain started. Even after the expansion during those periods of time there continued to be modifications and additions on the extensive plateau. Â St. John's Hall (Johannissaal) built in 1631 was converted in 1816 into the New Armoury (Neues Zeughaus).\n\nIn 1819 the Magdalenenburg castle was turned into a provisions magazine that was fortified to withstand bombardment. The old provisions store became a barracks. Â The Treasury (Schatzhaus) was built from 1854 to 1855. Â After the fortress had been incorporated in 1871 into the fortification system of the new German Empire, battery ramparts (BatteriewÃ¤lle) were constructed from 1870 to 1895 with eight firing points, that were to have provided all-round defence for the fortress in case of an attack that, in the event, never came. Â This was at this time that the last major building work was done on the fortress.\n\nBecause KÃ¶nigstein Fortress was regarded as unconquerable, the Saxon monarchs retreated to it from Wittenberg and later Dresden during times of crisis and also deposited the state treasure and many works of art from the famous Zwinger there. Â It was also used as a country retreat due to its lovely surroundings. The fortress played an important role in the History of Saxony, albeit less as a result of military action. The Saxon Dukes and Prince-Electors used the fortress primarily as a secure refuge during times of war, as a hunting lodge and maison de plaisance, but also as a dreaded state prison. Â Its actual military significance was rather marginal, although generals such as John Everard of Droste and ZÃ¼tzen (1662â1726) commanded it. Â For example, Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II could only watch helplessly from the KÃ¶nigstein during the Seven Years' War, when right at the start of the war in 1756 his army surrendered without a fight to the Prussian Army at the foot of the Lilienstein on the other side of the Elbe. Â The commandant of the fortress from 1753 was the electoral Saxon Lieutenant General, Michael Lorenz von Pirch. Â In August 1813 the clash at Krietzschwitz took place in front of its gates, an engagement that proved an important precursor to the Battle of Kulm and the Battle of Leipzig. Â In October 1866 Alexander von Rohrscheidt (1808â1881) was nominated as commandant of the fortress. Â It lost its military value with the development of long-range guns at the beginning of the 19th century. Â The last commandant of KÃ¶nigstein Fortress was Lieutenant Colonel Heinicke who commanded it until 1913. Â The fortress had to guard the Saxon state reserves and secret archives during times of war. Â In 1756 and 1813 Dresden's art treasures were also stored at the KÃ¶nigstein. Â During the Second World War the large casemates of the fortress were also used for such purposes.\n\nThe fortress was never conquered, it had too much of a chilling reputation after it had been expanded by Elector Christian I. Â Only the chimney sweep, Sebastian Abratzky, managed to climb the vertical sandstone walls in 1848. The Abratzky Chimney (Abratzky-Kamin) named after him is a grade IV (based on the Saxonsystem) climbing route that may still be climbed today. Â Because climbing over the wall is banned, climbers must abseil down the adjacent wall again after climbing it.\n\nUntil 1922 the fortress was the best-known state prison in Saxony. Â During the Franco-Prussian War and the two world wars the fortress was also used as a prisoner of war (PW) camp. Â In the First World War, the castle was used as a PW camp (Oflag) for French and Russian officers. Â In the Second World War it again served as an Oflag (Oflag IV-B), for British, French, Polish and other Allied officers.\n\nAfter the Second World War the Red Army used the fortress as a military hospital. Â From 1949 to 1955 it was used as a so-called Jugendwerkhof for the re-education of delinquent youths and those who did not fit the image of a socialist society. Â Since 29 May 1955, the fortress has been an open-air, military history museum of high touristic value. Â The museum has been managed as a satellite of the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden since 1990.

The German name Wenzelschloss (\"Saint Wenceslas' Chateau\") is derived from the statue of Saint Wenceslas, on the facade of the entrance gate. The castle was built by the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV in 1356, on the ruins of an older castle. Â The dominant feature of the castle is the hall of arms. Â In 1934, under a layer of old paint 112 coats of arms of noblemen of the Crown of Bohemia were discovered. Â It is a significant collection of Bohemian, Moravian and Silesian secular and ecclesiastical heraldry.\n\nLauf stands in an area called the Bohemian Palatinate, which was once part of the Bohemian crown lands. Â In 1373 Emperor Charles IV ceded the castle along with parts of the Bohemian Palatinate to Otto V, Duke of Bavaria in exchange for the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Â Charles' son Wenceslaus IV lost the rest of the Palatinate in 1401.\n\n(Krzysztof Photo)\n\nWenceslas Castle with wooden footbridge.\n\n(LoKiLeCh Photo)\n\nThallichtenberg: Burg Lichtenberg is a ruin of a spur castle, with a length of 425m (1,394 ft), marking it as the\n\nlargest castle ruin in Germany.
