        "meta_description": "Abstract. Climatic change alters the frequency and intensity of natural hazards. In order to assess potential future changes in flood seasonality in the Rhine River basin, we analyse changes in streamflow, snowmelt, precipitation and evapotranspiration at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0ââC global warming levels. The mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) forced with an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (five general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways) is used to simulate the present and future climate conditions of both pluvial and nival hydrological regimes. Our results indicate that future changes in flood characteristics in the Rhine River basin are controlled by increases in antecedent precipitation and diminishing snowpacks. In the pluvial-type sub-basin of the Moselle River, an increasing flood potential due to increased antecedent precipitation encounters declining snowpacks during winter. The decrease in snowmelt seems to counterbalance increasing precipitation, resulting in only small and transient changes in streamflow maxima. For the Rhine Basin at Basel, rising temperatures cause changes from solid to liquid precipitation, which enhance the overall increase in precipitation sums, particularly in the cold season. At the gauge at Basel, the strongest increases in streamflow maxima show up during winter, when strong increases in liquid precipitation encounter almost unchanged snowmelt-driven runoff. The analysis of snowmelt events for the gauge at Basel suggests that at no point in time during the snowmelt season does a warming climate result in an increase in the risk of snowmelt-driven flooding. Snowpacks are increasingly depleted with the course of the snowmelt season. We do not find indications of a transient merging of pluvial and nival floods due to climate warming. To refine attained results, next steps need to be the representation of glaciers and lakes in the model set-up, the coupling of simulations to a streamflow component model and an independent validation of the snow routine using satellite-based snow cover maps.",

        "text": "2.1âModel set-up\n\nThe mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) v.5.10 (Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2010; Kumar etÂ al.,Â 2013; Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2019a) is used to detect and assess projected changes in Rhine River floods under future climate conditions (Figs.Â 2 and 3). mHM is a spatially distributed hydrologic model based on grid cells. A key feature of mHM is the multiscale parameter regionalisation (MPR) technique, which allows subgrid variability to be accounted for and provides simulations in a seamless manner over multiple resolutions (e.g.Â Kumar etÂ al.,Â 2013; Rakovec etÂ al.,Â 2016; Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2017). During MPR, high-resolution physiographic land surface descriptors are translated into model parameters in the two phases of MPR, i.e. regionalisation and upscaling. In the framework of this study, the high-resolution physiographical data sets describing the main features of the terrain, e.g. digital elevation model, aspect, slope, soil texture, geological formation type, land cover and leaf area index (LAI), are in 500âm resolution (Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2019). The mHM model set-up distinguishes six soil layers up to a depth of 2âm based on Hengl etÂ al. (2017). For each soil horizon the soil types are defined based on clay content, sand content and bulk density. We distinguish eight hydrogeological units. The baseflow recession parameters characterising each unit are determined during model calibration. Long-term climatologic monthly LAI maps are based on Mao and Yan (2019). Using a modified IGBP MODIS Noah classification scheme, 23 LAI classes are distinguished, whereby classes representing croplands, grassland, coniferous forest, mixed forest and mosaics of cropland and natural vegetation are the most common in the basin. More information on physiographical data sets, the mapping on a common 500âmâÃâ500âm spatial resolution and underlying data sources is presented in Samaniego etÂ al. (2019). All dominant hydrological processes are modelled at 5âkm spatial resolution.\n\nMeteorological forcing data of the model consist of daily average, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation. Observational data sets are based on the E-OBS v12 gridded data sets (Haylock etÂ al.,Â 2008). Climate model data originate from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) (Hempel etÂ al.,Â 2013a, b; Warszawski etÂ al.,Â 2014). ISI-MIP is based on global climate model (GCM) runs performed during the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5;Â Taylor etÂ al.,Â 2012). Within ISI-MIP, daily data from five global climate models (GCMs), i.e. GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CMSA-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM and NorESM1-M, were bias-corrected and bilinearly interpolated to a 0.5ââÃâ0.5â grid. Bias correction of climate model data represents an indispensable step in climate change impact modelling applications. Systematic deviation, e.g. due to imperfect model representations of atmospheric processes or errors in the parameterisation chain, needs to be corrected (Ehret etÂ al.,Â 2012). A detailed description of the trend-preserving statistical bias correction method developed and applied within ISI-MIP, which includes an additive correction approach for temperature and a multiplicative correction for precipitation, is presented in Hempel etÂ al. (2013b). GCM data used cover the period 1950â2099 and include three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. In the framework of the project âEDgE â End-to-end Demonstrator for improved decision making in the water sector in Europeâ by order of the Copernicus Climate Service (http://edge.climate.copernicus.eu/, last access: 28Â AprilÂ 2021), meteorological data sets were interpolated to a 5âkm grid using external drift kriging (Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2019).\n\nmHM forced with E-OBS meteorological data is calibrated for the Rhine Basin at the gauge at Lobith against observed streamflow at the three gauges at Lobith, Basel and Cochem during 1951â1975 using the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm (DDS;Â Tolson and Shoemaker,Â 2007) and the NashâSutcliffe efficiency (NSE;Â Nash and Sutcliffe,Â 1970). In the framework of this multi-basin calibration, we simultaneously optimise NSE values for the three gauges and attain one set of global parameters, which we apply to the entire basin. We use a multi-basin approach to ensure that rainfall- and snowmelt-triggered runoff from both nival- and pluvial-dominated sub-basins, as well as streamflow in the main channel of the Rhine River, is considered during calibration. MPR enables the sampling in a lower dimensional space, in turn speeding up the convergence of the optimisation algorithm (Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2010). In total, we calibrate 47 global parameters using 1000 model iterations. A detailed overview of global parameters and their linkage with basin predictors in the regionalisation transfer functions are presented in Samaniego etÂ al. (2010) and Kumar etÂ al. (2013). In order to evaluate the model performance in all important sub-regions of the entire Rhine River, the mHM performance is evaluated at an additional six independent gauges (Fig.Â 2) and during an independent evaluation period (1976â2000) using the NSE and the KlingâGupta efficiency (KGE;Â Gupta etÂ al.,Â 2009) (TableÂ 1). Analyses evaluating streamflow simulations for the historic time frame 1951â2000 are given in the Appendix (Figs.Â A1, B1 and C1). Similar to investigations presented in the Supplement of Thober etÂ al. (2018), we assess streamflow maxima and the 90â% streamflow quantile of the hydrological year. In addition, we evaluate the timing of annual streamflow maxima and 90â% streamflow quantiles on a monthly basis. All observational discharge times series are obtained from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC).\n\nThe multiscale routing model (mRM;Â Thober etÂ al.,Â 2019) is used for routing river runoff using the adaptive time step scheme (aTS). The kinematic wave equation (Lighthill and Whitham,Â 1955), a simplification of the Saint-Venant equation (deÂ Saint-Venant,Â 1871), is solved using a finite difference scheme. The kinematic wave equation only needs little information on the river topography and assesses the advection and the attenuation of flood waves. The time step selected within aTS only depends on the spatial resolution and is independent of the temporal resolution of the meteorological forcing. In our model set-up, water is routed through the river network at a temporal resolution of 30âmin. The high-resolution river network is based on a 500Ã500âm digital elevation map and is upscaled to operate on a 5âkm routing resolution. Within the upscaling process, the flow direction in the lower resolution (routing resolution) is equal to the flow direction in the underlying high-resolution grid cell with the highest flow accumulation (Samaniego etÂ al.,Â 2010). The stream celerity is determined as a function of terrain slope (Thober etÂ al.,Â 2019).\n\nAll dominant hydrological processes are modelled at 5âkm spatial resolution. We estimate reference crop evapotranspiration following the HargreavesâSamani equation, an empirical approach using minimum climatological data (Hargreaves and Samani,Â 1985; Samani,Â 2000). The empirical coefficient of the equation is determined during calibration. The usage of this simple approach enables a consistent set-up across historical and future model space. The actual evapotranspiration is estimated based on the fraction of roots in the soil horizons and a stress factor for reducing potential values calculated based on the actual soil moisture. The stress factor is determined using the Feddes equation (Feddes etÂ al.,Â 1976). If the soil moisture is below the permanent wilting point, evapotranspiration is reduced to zero. In the case that the soil moisture is above field capacity, the evapotranspiration equals the fraction of roots. If the soil moisture is in between the permanent wilting point and field capacity, evapotranspiration is reduced by the fraction of roots times the stress factor. The mHM set-up distinguishes six soil layers up to a total depth of 2âm. Organic matter is possible until 0.3âm. In total, more than 2000 soil types with different clay content, sand content and bulk density are defined. Land surfaces with impervious cover are treated as free-water surfaces, and actual evapotranspiration is estimated with an additional evaporation coefficient. More details of the soil parameterisation in mHM can be found in Livneh etÂ al. (2015).\n\nThe canopy interception is modelled with a maximum interception approach. The maximum interception capacity is estimated based on the given LAI values. Water can leave the interception storage as throughfall, which is estimated as a function of the current and maximum canopy water content and the incoming precipitation. Evaporation from the canopy storage depends on the current and maximum canopy water content and the potential values of evapotranspiration. We simulated snow using an empirical degree-day approach, whereby degree-day factors differ depending on the dominant land use class. In order to account for snowmelt following the energy input from liquid rainfall, degree-day factors are increased depending on the amount of liquid precipitation. Degree-day factors can only increase to a certain threshold value. Due to the spatial resolution of 5âkm, our model set-up does not capture the highest elevations in the basin. To also capture the snow dynamics at mountain peaks, meteorological input data would need to be at higher spatial resolution, and more advanced snow and ice processes would need to be considered. Surface runoff from impervious areas is calculated based on a linear reservoir exceedance approach. Interflow from the unsaturated zone is determined using a non-linear reservoir with saturation excess. Groundwater is assumed to be a linear reservoir. mHM does not include glacier and lake modules yet.\n\nThe changes in mHM-based flood seasonality are further differentiated and scrutinised for three different warming levels: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0ââC. Within each future model run, the 30-year time windows in which the warming levels (compared to the historic time window 1971â2000) are reached are determined. The period 1971â2000 is assumed to be warmer by 0.46ââC compared to pre-industrial levels already (Vautard etÂ al.,Â 2014). For example, when comparing 30-year running temperature means from the IPSL-CM5A-LR model run under RCP6.0, temperatures reach 1.5ââC warming compared to pre-industrial levels in the 30-year time window 2009â2038, 2.0ââC warming during 2028â2057 and a 3.0ââC warming in the period 2066â2095. A total of 14 GCMâRCP realisations reach 1.5ââC, 13 reach 2.0ââC and 8 reach 3.0ââC global warming. A detailed description of the determination of warming levels including a table with 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0ââC time periods of the GCMâRCP realisation is given in the Supplement (TableÂ S1) of Thober etÂ al. (2018).\n\n2.2âChanges in streamflow characteristics\n\nIn order to assess the changes in flood characteristics, we determine the timing and magnitude of annual and monthly maxima of streamflow, precipitation (total and liquid), snowmelt and actual evapotranspiration for the hydrological year starting on 1Â October (TableÂ 2). In the case of precipitation, we investigate maxima of 5âd sums (Pmax5). Investigating thousands of annual streamflow maxima for different Swiss catchments with regard to flood-triggering precipitation, Froidevaux etÂ al. (2015) conclude that precipitation 2 to 3âd before an event is an important determinant of flood magnitude. To account for larger catchment sizes and hence longer travel times in our study catchments, we chose a 5âd window. For snowmelt and evapotranspiration, we extend this time window to 10âd and assess the magnitude and timing of 10âd sums (Smax10 and ETmax10). We assume that in order to have substantial impact on streamflow, meteorological conditions favouring snowmelt or evapotranspiration need to prevail longer than only a few days. According to our experience, a 10âd window width provides a good estimate to assess potential impacts on streamflow.\n\nIn the case of annual maxima, we display the timing and magnitude as box plots and histograms. The length of the box plot whiskers is 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). However, if no data point exceeds this distance, the whiskers only reach until minimum/maximum value. The notches extend to Â±1.58â IQRn , with n being the length of the data vector (McGill etÂ al.,Â 1978; R Core Team,Â 2019). The notches roughly represent 95â% confidence intervals for the difference in two medians. For visualisation purposes, we do not display whiskers and outliers of box plots displaying monthly maxima values. Histograms always depict the probability density and have a total area of 1. To estimate the importance of snowmelt during peak flow formation, we calculate the ratio between snowmelt in the preceding 10âd and snowmelt in the preceding 10âd plus precipitation in the preceding 5âd (Sfrac). Furthermore, we estimate evapotranspiration loss as the ratio between actual evapotranspiration in the preceding 10âd and snowmelt in the preceding 10âd plus precipitation in the preceding 5âd (ETloss). In addition, we determine mean average annual cycles of Sfrac, the average elevation of the snowmelt (Selev), the solid fraction of precipitation (Psolid) and the median average annual cycle of ETloss.\n\nIn the framework of the analysis, we focus on the three gauges: Basel, Cochem and Cologne (Fig.Â 3). Selected gauges and sub-basins enable a detailed insight into changes in pluvial and nival processes and changes in the main channel of the Rhine River. The gauge at Basel is located at the transition from the High to Upper Rhine. The basin upstream of the gauge at Basel encompasses large areas of high alpine character. Snowmelt during spring and early summer is an important runoff/flood-generating process (Wetter etÂ al.,Â 2011; Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016). Runoff at the gauge at Cochem (Moselle River) is characterised by a pluvial flow regime, with high runoff during winter and low runoff during summer (Fig.Â 4). Flooding typically occurs in winter and early spring due to large-scale advective precipitation (Pfister etÂ al.,Â 2004; Bronstert etÂ al.,Â 2007). The gauge at Cologne is located in the Lower Rhine region after the confluences of the main tributaries Moselle, Neckar and Main (Fig.Â 2). Streamflow at the gauge at Cologne is characterised by a complex flow regime containing both nival and pluvial characteristics.\n\nRising temperatures diminish seasonal snow cover (see alsoÂ Bavay etÂ al.,Â 2009; Rousselot etÂ al.,Â 2012; Schmucki etÂ al.,Â 2015; Beniston etÂ al.,Â 2018). As a result, the importance of snowmelt as a flood-generating process decreases (Fig.Â 6a, b, c and d). In the Rhine Basin at Basel, 10âd snowmelt maxima (Smax10) decrease for all months of spring and summer (Fig.Â 8a). At no point in time during the snowmelt season does a warming climate result in an increase in risk of snowmelt-driven flooding. Our results indicate that the detected earlier timing of the annual snowmelt maxima (Fig.Â 6e) is not due to an increase in snowmelt magnitudes earlier in the year. It rather seems that events early in the snowmelt season, even if weakened by rising temperatures, more often are the strongest of the year already, as snowpacks are increasingly depleted within the course of the snowmelt season. For the basin at Basel, we can not find indications that an earlier snowmelt due to rising temperatures shifts the risk of snowmelt-driven flooding forward in time. Despite the temporal shift forward of annual snowmelt maxima, flood hazard seems to decrease, as the temporal shift concurs with a strong decrease in snowmelt magnitudes (Fig.Â 6c). Our findings agree with results from Musselman etÂ al. (2017), who suggest that a âshallower snowpack melts earlier, and at lower rates, than deeper, later-lying snow coverâ. However, the disappearance of snowpacks and glaciers is likely to favour low-flow conditions along the Rhine River (Junghans etÂ al.,Â 2011; Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016). Another factor having the potential to initiate or reinforce the low-flow situation is increasing values of evapotranspiration, particularly during summer (Fig.Â 9g and h).\n\nOur results indicate that at Basel during winter, the lack of snowmelt from lower elevations, at least partly, is compensated for by snowmelt from areas located at higher elevations (Rottler etÂ al.,Â 2021) (Figs.Â 7c and e and 9a). This compensation effect seems to be increasingly insufficient as the snowmelt season progresses and the snowline moves upward. We suggest that in winter, the almost unchanged potential of snowmelt-induced runoff at Basel encounters increased antecedent precipitation (Fig.Â 9c), in turn resulting in a strong increase in streamflow maxima (Fig.Â 8a). The next step to improve the representation of snow accumulation and melt in the model set-up is the usage of satellite-based snow cover maps in a multi-criteria calibration and/or for an independent validation of the snow routine.\n\nOur results confirm previous studies suggesting that rising temperatures might lead to stronger precipitation events (e.g.Â Lehmann etÂ al.,Â 2015; Alfieri etÂ al.,Â 2015; King and Karoly,Â 2017; BÃ¼rger etÂ al.,Â 2019; Rottler etÂ al.,Â 2020) (Figs.Â 6gâj and 9câf) and a shift from solid to liquid rainfall (e.g.Â Allamano etÂ al.,Â 2009; Addor etÂ al.,Â 2014; Davenport etÂ al.,Â 2020) (Fig.Â 7a and b). In catchments that have mixed hydrological regimes with rainfall and snowmelt, rising temperatures seem to lead to a shift from snowmelt to rainfall as the most important flood-generating process (Vormoor etÂ al.,Â 2015, 2016). Reconstructing the largest floods in the High Rhine since 1268, Wetter etÂ al. (2011) indicate that about half of all large events occurred during summer due to heavy precipitation combined with high baseflow from snowmelt and ice melt. Our results indicate that with rising temperatures, most flood events will occur in winter (Fig.Â 5d).\n\nIn March and April, the increase in rainfall amounts in the basin at Basel compares to increases in winter; the magnitudes of streamflow maxima, however, hardly change (Fig.Â 8a). We suggest that the increasing potential of rainfall-induced flooding is counterbalanced by decreasing snowmelt (Fig.Â 9a and c). Furthermore, our results hint at a transient increase in flood magnitudes during May and June (Fig.Â 8a). It seems that during those 2 months, snowmelt is still strong enough to support an increase in streamflow peaks due to increased antecedent precipitation at moderate warming levels (1.5 and 2.0ââC). With further rising temperatures, however, the magnitudes of streamflow maxima reduce along with declining snowmelt (Fig.Â 8a). The mHM model set-up that we use to simulate the Rhine River does not include a lake module. The simulation results attained for the Rhine Basin, particularly for the gauge at Basel, can be further refined by the representation of the large lakes located in Switzerland and southern Germany (Imhoff etÂ al.,Â 2020). The large storage volume and the possibility to regulate lake levels dampen streamflow peaks.\n\nFor the gauge at Cochem and the associated sub-basin of the Moselle River, we detect similar counterbalancing effects between snowmelt and rainfall: an increasing flood potential due to increased precipitation amounts encounters declining snowpacks. Again, decreases in snowmelt magnitudes seem to counterbalance increased precipitation, resulting in comparatively small and transient increases in streamflow maxima (Figs.Â 8b and 9b and d). As the highest mountains in the sub-basin only reach up to around 1300âm a.s.l., snowmelt compensation effects, i.e. snowmelt from higher elevations, at least partly, replacing the lack of snowmelt from lower elevation, only play a marginal role. Analysing changes in frequencies of rain-on-snow (RoS) events with flood-generating potential for large parts of Europe for the historic time frame 1950â2011, Freudiger etÂ al. (2014) hint at similar processes changing flood hazard. Their analyses suggest an increase in flood hazard from RoS events in medium-elevation mountain ranges in the Rhine River basin in winter due to increased rainfall and a decrease in RoS events in spring due to decreases in snow cover. Although important Rhine tributaries, such as the Moselle River, often are characterised as pluvial-type rivers, the importance of snowmelt as a runoff component must not be underestimated. Simulating the Rhine River for the time frame 1901â2006, Stahl etÂ al. (2016) suggest that at the gauge at Cochem, 26â% of the annual streamflow originates from snowmelt. During winter, this fraction increases up to almost 40â% (see also Fig.Â 7b). However, the inter-annual variability of annual streamflow and the relative fractions of streamflow components is high, particularly in pluvial-type tributaries of the Rhine River (Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016). The simple estimate Sfrac, which is based on the amount of snowmelt and liquid precipitation, provides the first-order approximation of future changes in the importance of snowmelt during peak flow formation and as a streamflow component. However, to correctly quantify changes in streamflow components, the coupling of simulations to a streamflow component model is required (Stahl etÂ al.,Â 2016; Weiler etÂ al.,Â 2018).\n\nIn Cologne, which is located at the main stream after the confluence of all major tributaries, signals emerging from the different sub-basins overlap. Accordingly, we detect increases in runoff peaks during winter (Fig.Â 8c). Detected increases seem to level off as temperatures continue to rise beyond the 2ââC warming level. We do not find indications supporting the hypothesis describing the creation of a new flood type in the Rhine River basin due to a transient merging of nival and pluvial flood types. We detect counterbalancing effects between changes in snowmelt and precipitation within the sub-basins. Rising temperatures strongly reduce snowfall, snow accumulation and the snow volume available for melt. The reduction in snowmelt during flood genesis seems to impede the increase in streamflow peaks due to increases in antecedent precipitation. Caution has to be exercised labelling basins such as the Moselle catchment as pluvial-type or the Rhine Basin at Basel as nival-type. In both sub-basins, snowmelt and precipitation are important factors for flood generation. In the framework of this study, we mostly focus on changes in streamflow seasonality and analyse average changes in streamflow-generating mechanisms. A detailed analysis of isolated extremes simulated is still pending.\n\nAddor, N., RÃ¶ssler, O., KÃ¶plin, N., Huss, M., Weingartner, R., and Seibert, J.: Robust changes and sources of uncertainty in the projected hydrological regimes of Swiss catchments, Water Resour.
