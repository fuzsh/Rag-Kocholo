Wiens (Fort Collins, USA) EDITORIAL Chcinge of editors The past two years have been spent by revitalizing our journal, Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. The responsibility of publishing the journal on behalf of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences was taken over by the Hungarian Natural History Museum from the publishing house of the acade¬ my, Akademiai Kiado. The editorial board was considerably expanded by an in- ternational panel of editorial advisors, whose advice and work as a referee are much appreciated. A number of changes in editorial policy, content and format have taken place over the past these two years. The international character of the journal has always been our main concern. In Volume 40 and 41 one-third of the authorship comes from outside Hungary, which does not seem bad for the first phase of the way to becoming a truly international journal. The former Editor-in-Chief, Laszlo Papp , resigned from his appointment in December, 1995, because the burden of a massive international project (editorial work on the Manual of Palaearctic Diptera) and other commitments made it diffi- cult for him to maintain the level of editorial activity on the journal indispensable for the quality required. The Biology Section of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences accepted his resignation and delegated me the task of the Editor-in- Chief. The Hungarian members of the editorial board suggested that one more editor would help to spread the workload, and they nominated Dr Andras Demeter as assistant editor. The Biology Section approved this appointment as well. I reassure the subscribers and readers of Acta zoologica hungarica that the aims and the scope of the journal have not changed because of the change in edi- torship. However, I have to confess that we are struggling with a major problem. In order to maintain a quality of papers, we must rely on reviewers’ opinion. Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae publishes papers in the fields of animal taxonomy and systematics, zoogeography, animal ecology, community ecology, population genetics, population biology, biodiversity studies and nature conservation problems. In the past two years have been able to provide a fairly rapid publication forum for the accepted papers. The journal is indexed in Cur¬ rent Contents. We would welcome your comments, including your criticism, on the scien- tific quality of the papers, the format and appearance of the journal etc. Dr. Istvdn Matskasi Editor-in-Chief Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 42 (1), pp. 3-10, 1996 AN INTERESTING REPRODUCTION TYPE IN ENCHYTRAEIDS (OLIGOCHAETA) K. Dozsa-Farkas Department of Systematic Zoology and Ecology, Eotvos Lordnd University H-1088 Budapest, Puskin u. 3, Hungary The reproduction biology of a recently described enchytraeid species, Enchytraeus dudichi was investigated. This species is able to reproduce both sexually and asexually by fragmen- tation. Data about the cocoon deposition, the incubation period, the growth of juveniles, the maturation, the occurrence of fragmentation, and the number, size, and growth of fragments were determined. When populations of E. dudichi occur in low densities fragmentation results. Fragmentation enhances the chance of the species to successfully colonize new habi- tats, whereas sexual reproduction maintains genetic diversity within the population. Key words: Enchytraeidae, sexual and asexual reproduction, fragmentation Reproduction by fragmentation in enchytraeids is a rare phenomenon. The species of the genera Cognettia and Buchholzia are well known for their frag¬ mentation capabilities (CHRISTENSEN 1959, NlELSEN and CHRISTENSEN 1959). Until now only five species of the genus Enchytraeus , including E. dudichi , have been found to reproduce this way. Among these species, E. japonensis NAKAMU- RA, 1993, the adult form of which is unknown, reproduces only by fragmentation (NAKAMURA 1993), and E. fragmentosus BELL, 1959 reaches sexual maturity only under particular breeding conditions (VENA et al. 1969). The species E. bigeminus NlELSEN and CHRISTENSEN, 1963 and E. variatus BOUGUENEC and GlANI, 1987 are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Enchytraeus dudichi DOZSA-FARKAS, 1995 a recently described species, was found in garden soil originating from Iran. We observed that this species is also capable of frag¬ mentation in laboratory cultures. The objective of study was to obtain more detailed information on the re- productive biology of E. dudichi. MATERIAL AND METHODS The worms were kept in Petri-dishes on 1% agar-agar medium and fed with oatmeal and dried nettle ( Urtica dioica) leaves. The juveniles and fragments of different ages were preserved in 70% ethanol and measured afterwards. Acta znol. hnnu. 42, 1996 Hunyai ian Natural History Museum, Budapest 4 K. D6ZSA-FARKAS Figs 1, 2.

Incubation pcriod of cocoons Acta zaol. hung. 42,1996 AN INTERESTING REPRODUCTION TYPE IN ENCHYTRAEIDS 5 In the study of sexual reproduction, the number of deposited cocoons, the dimensions of the cocoons, the number of eggs per cocoon, the incubation peri- od, and the growth rate of the juveniles were determined. In the case of fragmen- tation the number of fragments per animal, the number of segments per fragment, the size of fragments, and the growth rate of fragments were studied. RESULTS Sexual reproduction Both E. dudichi juveniles and specimens grown from fragments broke up into 3-10 fragments after 16-25 days. They became sexually mature only at high densities and under favourable conditions. At this point both cocoon deposition and fragmentation occurred simultaneously. The number of deposited cocoons was 0.5+0.2 per animal per day. Conse- quently, one cocoon was produced every second day. The average length of the cocoons was 596.8±68.5 pm, their width 289.1 ±34.1 |Ltm. One or two eggs were deposited in one cocoon (Figs 1 and 2). The percentage of cocoons with one egg was 95%. The dimensions of eggs were 248. I±46.9x217.1±24.5 pm. The co¬ coons with two eggs were significantly (P < 0.001) larger: 620.0±75.8 x 303.4+24.2 pm. The percentile distribution of the length of the hatchlings’ incu¬ bation period can be seen in Fig. 3. Incubation period was mostly 7-9 days (at 22-24 °C). Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the increase in segment number and length of juveniles. The segment number within hatching animals was 14-16 (mean Days Fig. 4.

After a month their segment number reached 63.0+2.4, with a length of 9.29+1.1 mm and width of 259.3+8.9 |Lim. The worms, if they did not fragmentize, became adults after 1-1.5 months at 22-24 °C. The maximum segment number of adult specimens was 128 with a length of 22 mm, they had a mean segment number of 71.9+24.6, with a length of 13.1+2.7 mm and a width of 277.1+30.5 (Ltm. Rep rod uction by fragmen tat ion Mature animals with 50-70 segments break up into 7-18 fragments (Fig. 6). The percentage of the number of segments (3-6) of intermediary fragments can be seen in Fig. 7. The majority (56.2%) of the fragments have 3 (3.5+0.7) seg¬ ments with a length of 672.6+140.3 pm. The anterior and posterior parts of the animal are longer, 9.7+2.0 segments (length: 1501.8+517.6 pm) and 12.0+2.8 segments (length: 1822.3+671.4 pm), respectively. Comparing the data concerning E. bigeminus (CHRISTENSEN 1964, 1973) and E. dudichi , it can be established that the latter species has a greater capability of fragmentation since E. bigeminus breaks up into only 4-7 segments, the num¬ ber of its segments are greater, in intermediary fragments 6-13, and in anterior and posterior ones, 1 1-18. The species E. fragmentosus breaks up into 3-1 1 frag¬ ments with about 5 segments each (BELL 1959). Immature specimens of E. vari¬ atus divide into only 3-6 fragments (BOUGUENEC and GtANI 1989). Figures 8, 9 and 10 demonstrate the growth of the intermediary fragments. After 1 1 days the growth of the fragments, as regards both the number and length of segments, is less than those of juveniles of the same age (grown at 22-24 °C).

The growth rate of fragments kept at 29-30 °C was more than twice that of fragments kept at 22-24 °C: they reached the same size at three and seven days, respectively. By this time the head is completely regenerated, and the animals are capable of feeding. After this time only the posterior part develops. The regeneration of the head in E. bigeminus takes 6 days at 22-24 °C (CHRISTENSRN 1973), whereas in E. fragmentosus it takes 10 days (BELL 1959). ( 56 . 2 %) Actawoi hurtR. 42, 1996 8 K.

Growth of the length of thc intermediary fragments produce asexually. Seasonal climatic factors influence the appearance of mature specimens, mostly in cold periods, such as late autumn and early spring in Eu¬ rope (CHRISTENSEN 1959, Nielsen and CHRISTENSEN 1959). As mentioned above, E. bigeminus held in cultures of low density results in sexual reproduction (CHRISTENSEN 1973). Enchytraeusfragmentosus became mature only on an ade- quate substrate (glass wool) in the laboratory (VENA et al. 1969, HAMILTON and HESS 1971). Unlike E. bigeminus , which becomes sexually mature only at low densities, low densities of E. dudichi resuit in fragmentation. In most populations, after ap¬ pearance of mature specimens the cocoon deposition and fragmentation take place simultaneously. The density dependence of the sexual type of reproduction needs further investigation. * * * Acknowleclgement. - My thanks are due to Dr. F. Baska for collecting the enchytraeid ma- terial in Iran.

Biologia, Fac. Ciendas, UNAM. 04510 Mexico, D. F., Mexico Two new species are described in the oribatid genus, Balazsella Mahunka, 1983. One of thcm: Balazsella ilhabellae sp. n. was collected in Brazil, Balazsella mexicana sp. n. with a spccial collecting method from Mexico. Some notes elucidate the position of the genus. With 8 original figures. Key words: Acari, oribatid mites, new species, Brazil and Mexico INTRODUCTION In this report, two species of oribatid mites new to Science are described from the Neotropics. The collecting method was described in detail by MAHUNKA and PALA- CIOS-VARGAS (1995). The Biological Station of Chamela in Jalisco Cost is lo- cated 120 km north of the Manzanillo-Puerto Vallarta Highway. It is a very sea- sonal region, with concentrated rainfall from July to September. The dominating vegetation is a tropical deciduous forest and a tropical sub-deciduous forest (RZE- DOWSKY 1978). We describe a new species: Balazsella mexicana sp. n. Further on we give the description of another species, Balazsella ilhabellae sp. n. from a material collected by the senior author in Brazil. Finally, by giving the differen- tial diagnosis of the three species, we re-evaluate the taxonomic status of the genus Balazsella MAHUNKA, 1983. The holotypes are deposited in the Department of Zoology of the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, the paratypes are deposited in the collection of both authors and the collection of the Museum d’Histoire naturelle, Geneva, Switzerland.

Eight paratypes from the same sample. Remarks: This genus was established by MAHUNKA based on specimens from Brazil, with the original description of the type species (Balazsella piloso- setosa MAHUNKA, 1983). He included it in the family Oribatulidae THOR, 1929. When subdividing Oribatuloidea, BALOGH and BALOGH (1984) transferred Ba¬ lazsella to the family of Fenicheliidae since they recognized its relationships with Hemileius , in which the sacculi are present, while the pteromorphae are absent. It was also treated as such in their 1992 work on the “Oribatid Genera of the World”. However, it seems probable that the family Fenicheliidae is an artificial unit, and the genus Balazsella has to be removed. The question cannot yet be * Mahunka mistakenly referred to lack of cp2 in describing the genus. This feature may clearly be seen on the type species of the genus, although it is very small and inclinate,' and is almost wholly obscured by the surface of the tarsus. Actazooi hunx- 42, 1996 14 BALOGH, J. & J. G. PALACOIS-VARGAS fully answered, so for the time being this step has to be postponed. The two new spe¬ cies fit well within the original generic diagnosis, repeated below. The combination of features by which the taxa may be accommodated in the genus is given below: 1. notogaster with four pairs of sacculi (sometimes inconspicuous), 2. five pairs of genital setae (GAC formula: 5-1-2-3), 3. 14 pairs of dilated notogastral setae, 4. fissure iad in paraanal position, 5. arboricolous species, in the canopy, inhabiting the thin layers of moss on the trunk, and in the debris accumulated at the base of leaf-rosettes of epiphytic bromelias.

The volume begins with an essay-like Introduction heavily re- lying on subjective opinions discussing the general questions of Oribatology. The following section lists Berlese’s species placed in the modern System helping the specialists with morphological notes and many drawings; here also the condition of the specimens is discussed and lectotypes are designated. The third, large section is the catalogue proper, wherein all the species are listed in the systematic order together with their combi- nation and synonymic names. Here one may find all the literature data, usually missing from ordinary works, with reference to De- scription and Taxonomy, Distribution, with special emphasis on Catalogues whose references are partly unreliable. Where it was deemed necessary further information are added under the heading of Remarks. The volume closes with a very detailed list of lit¬ erature.

I. ARCHIPHTHIRACARELLA GEN. N. S. Mahunka Department ofZoology, Hungarian Natural History Museum H-1088 Budapest, Baross u. 13, Hungary Two species of the oribatid mite family Phthiracaridae are discussed, one of them ( Phthira- carus insularis Balogh 1962) is redescribed and designated as the type of a new genus: Ar- chiphthiracarella gen. n., the other is new to Science and also belongs to this genus. With 11 original figures. Key words: Acari, Oribatida, Phthiracaridae, new genus and species, Madagascar INTRODUCTION The oribatid fauna of Madagascar, East and South Africa and the islands adjacent to these regions has been studied by the author (e.g. MAHUNKA 1994) over a number of years. It is especially essential to know the highly diverse fauna of Madagascar in order to more readily comprehend those important faunal and floral relations between the Ethiopian and the Oriental regions which point to Gondwanan origin. The renowned bryologist, Prof. T. POCS, recently collected many soil sam- ples in these regions, including Madagascar. The recovered oribatid mites will be discussed in a number of succeeding papers. In this paper I present to introduce two species belonging to the family Phthiracaridae PERTY, 1841, of which one undoubtedly represents the species of Phthiracarus insularis BALOGH, 1962. The other species is a close ally, but new to Science. The subsequently discussed features, however, clearly demonstrate that both differ fundamentally from all the heretofore known Phthiracarus PERTY, 1841 species. Consequently, a new genus has to be erected. The family Phthiracaridae and even the subfamily and/or genus have so far been considered monotypic taxa (e.g. NlEDBALA 1986, 1992), in spite of the fact that the taxa (family, genus) have always been diagnosed with several excep- tions. On the other hand, characteristics such as the number of anal setae, the no- togastral lyrifissures, leg chaetotaxy (seta v’ of femur I, seta V of genu IV) were wholly excluded as evolved characters, which in other related families readily separate genera and are accepted as plesiomorphic features. Consequently, the taxon named as Phthiracarus , either referring to a subfamily or family, is not Acta zaol. hung. 42. 1996 Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest 18 S. MAHUNKA monotypic (see MAHUNKA 1990 b). Subsequent studies will most certainly bring about further divisions within the genus, as is demanded both by taxonomy and systematics. This fact is clearly demonstrated by this newly discovered taxon whose most significant feature (the position of the genital setae) differs from that of all other Phthiracarus species. In describing the species I am using my own terminology (MAHUNKA 1990«). DISCUSSION AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TAXA Phthiracaridae PERTY, 1841 Archiphthiracarella gen. n. Diagnosis: Family Phthiracaridae, subfamily Phthiracarinae. Low crista present, prodorsal surface partly sculptured. Lateral carina absent, sinus line pres- ent. All setae of prodorsum and notogaster smooth, 15 pairs arising on the noto- gaster. Eight pairs of genital setae present (gi absent?), forming one row. Setae g5~g9 located further from inner margin than g2~g4, which arise on anterior part of genital piate, near margin. Five pairs of normal ano-adanal setae, two pairs of anal ones nearer inner margin of ano-adanal piate than others. Setae v’ of femur I absent, no seta on genu IV, setae cl of tibia IV minute, coupled with the soieni- dium. Type species: Phthiracarus insularis BALOGH, 1962. Remarks: This and the related species described below are unique in the subfamily Phthiracarinae by virtue of the position of their genital setae. In all other taxa the genital setae are arranged in two longitudinal rows and one of the rows (setae g6~g9) is located far from the inner margin, much farther than setae g4-g5- Archiphthiracarella bulbifera sp. n.

Holotype deposited in the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, with identification number of the specimens in the Collection of Arachnida. Etymology: This species is named after the roundly dilated “bulbiform’’ basal part of the sensilius. Remarks: The new species is very similar to the type species of the genus (discussed below). However, it is distinguished from it by the form of the sensil¬ ius (much narrower in insularis ), the position of setae 03 and p 3 , and by the re- duced interlamellar setae (normal in insularis).

Balkenohl Kirchstrasse 5/2, 79211 Denzlingen, Germany Five new species of the tribe Clivinini (Scaritinae) from Indochina are described and illustra- ted, and two new genera are erected for these species: Sinesetosa gen. n. is monotypical with the type species S. acugena sp. n. and Rugiluclivina gen. n. is based on four new species: R. reticulata sp. n., R. puncticollis sp. n., R. wrasei sp. n., and R. rugicollis sp. n.. A key to the known Oriental genera of the tribe Clivinini and to the species of the genus Rugiluclivina is given. Key words: taxonomy, Coleoptera, Carabidae, Clivinini, Oriental region INTRODUCTION Around 130 species of the tribe Clivinini (sensu BASILEWSKY 1973) are known to occur in the Oriental region including New Guinea (ANDREWES 1929, 1930, 1931, 1936c/, b y KULT 1951, DARLINGTON 1962). Especially in this group of Scaritinae there are many closely related species, sibling species, and many of them are not easy to discriminate. Most of the genera and species groups need to be revised. This may be a reason why only very few new Oriental Clivinini species have recently been described, although this region is stili poorly investi- gated. The species described very recently exhibit extraordinary characters, so that they can be easily recognized with certainty even without new revisions of the groups (e.g. BAEHR 1989, DOSTAL 1993). Checking Oriental material I became aware of five new interesting species showing such striking characters that they cannot be placed in any of the known species groups. Comparison with the other known Oriental genera revealed that the new species obviously belong to two new genera. For the proposed “Key to Oriental genera of Clivinini”, type and/or comparative material was examined for each genus. This material, as well as the type material of the new species de¬ scribed, is deposited in the following collections: BMNH - The Natural History Museum, London, United Kingdom, CBA - collection of author, Denzlingen, Germany, CBM - collection of Dr. Martin Baehr, Mtinchen, Germany, CDW - collection of Dr. Alexander Dostal, Wien, Austria, CHP - collection of Prof. Dr. Karcl Hurka, Praha, Czech Republic, CWB - collection of David W.

CARABIDAE) 38 M. BALKENOHL RELATIONSHIPS The two genera erected exhibit numerous typical characters which makes the assumption evident that they obviously belong to the tribe Clivinini sensu BA- SILEWSKY (1973). Typical examples of those characters are: possession of the uninterrupted lateral series of umbilical punctures on the elytron, single preapical seta on the antennal scapus, the pubescence of antenna from segment 3 onwards, setae on the 2nd segment of labial palpus, two setae at each dorsal side of prono- tum, base of elytron with a seta at each side near the sutura, presence of 2 pairs of setae on the abdominal sterna, the deep maxillary excision, missing antennal grooves on the ventral surface of pronotum, the clypeus and frontal plates which are not completely fused, the aedeagus which is not flattened at apex, the unequal setigerous parameres, and the habitus. However, other Oriental Clivinini have in addition 2 setae on the 2nd segment of the labial palp (Table 1 , Rugiluclivina gen. n.: 1), 2 clypeal and 2 pairs of supraorbital setae (Table 1, Sinesetosa gen. n.: 0), and a different structure of head. Among the Oriental genera, Sinesetosa gen. n. seems to be intermediate between Ancus PUTZEYS, 1867 and Androzelma DOSTAL, 1993, but is more re- lated to Ancus. Sinesetosa and Ancus are of the same size, exhibit the same habi¬ tus and colour, the same square outline of the pronotum, and show the flattened disc of the elytra and frons of the head. The high degree of specialisation makes it difficult to assess the phylogenetic relationship. Similar strikingly developed genae as in Sinesetosa acugena sp. n. I have seen only in Clivina urophthal- moicles KULT, 1947 from Brazil. This character may be considered apomorphic. However, the reduced chaetotaxy of the frons and clypeus combined with the campanulate outline of the head exhibit a weak similarity to the Salcediini. An- other striking character, the numerous setae on intervals 3, 5, and 7 may be ple- siomorphic as in Trilophus ANDREWES, 1927. At first glance the four species of Rugiluclivina gen. n. look like small Scapterini or stout Scolyptus PUTZEYS, 1865 but they are not more closely related to either of these groups. However, the genus shares the following characters with Pseudoclivina KULT, 1947: big first tarsomere of front leg which is hirsute dorsally [beside these two genera this character is known in the Oriental genus Sparostes PUTZEYS, 1867, in the Ethiopian genus Bohemania PUTZEYS, 1865, and in species from the Neotropical Realm], size, compact habitus, colour, and position of elytral setigerous punctures. Other sharing characters are present but not so distinctly developed in Pseudoclivina. These are the cylindriform habitus, the perpendicular declivity at the base of the elytra, visibility of the 9th stria in marginal channel of elytra, and the well-developed and in some species complete submarginal furrow of the proepisternum. Therefore I believe that Pseudoclivina is the next related genus. Autapomorphic characters of Rugiluclivina are the con- Acta zool. htinff. 42, 1W6 NEW CLIVININI FROM THE ORIENTAL REGION (COL.. CARABIDAE) 39 spicuously deep-excised labrum, the single seta on the 2nd segment of the labial palp which is, to my knowledge, not known in any other genera of Clivinini, the wing-like tooth at the profemora, and the numerous closely packed carinae on the clypeus and frons. The longitudinal carinae on the dorsal surface of the head are also developed in other groups of Clivinidae worldwide (e.g. Coryza : Oriental re- gion, Ethiopian region, Arabian peninsula; Halocoryza : Ethiopian region, Arabian peninsula, Central America; Lophocoryza: Madagascar, Seychelles; Schiz.ogenius\\ North and Central America), and in other species (eg, Clivina co- ryzoides BAEHR, 1989, Australian region; C. rugiceps KLUG, 1832, C. stefania MULLER, 1942, Afroclivina mulleriana KULT, 1959, last three Ethiopian region). This character is obviously a convergent development. In all these groups the carinae are clearly differentiated and restricted to a specific number (from 3 in Coryza up to 10 in Halocoryza). In Rugiluclivina , however, the carinae are numerous (> 18), densely packed, and somewhat irregular. * * * Acknowledgements - The following persons are thanked for the loan of the type material de- scribed: Dr. N.

Of these, one genus (Ecphylopsis ASHMEAD) with its two species was transferred to the tribe Hecabolini (BELOKOBYLSKIJ 1992«: 164) and, furthermore, seven Pambolus species names proved to be junior synonyms (BELOKOBYLSKIJ 1986«). VAN ACHTERBERG & QUICKE (1990) and BELOKO¬ BYLSKIJ (1986«, 1986 b, 1988, 1990, 1992«, 1992 b) added three new genera and twenty-five new species to the subfamily Pambolinae. Taking into consideration the four new species herewith described, the subfamily Pambolinae comprises seven genera and forty-six species (see also the chapter Checklist of Pambolinae, p. 54). Abbreviations used in the text: OD = diameter of an ocellus; OOL = shortest distance bet- ween hind ocellus and eye; POL = shortest distance between hind two ocelli; cui = first section of the cubital vein; cuqul, cuqu2 = first and second transverse cubital vein; n. bas.l, n. bas.2 = first and second section of basal vein; n. rec. = recurrent vein; rl, r2 and r3 = first, second and third sec¬ tion of radial vein; B = first brachial cell; CU2 = second cubital cell; DI = first discal cell; R = radial cell.
