        "text": "Read: http://www.just-one-liners.com/ppl/cus-damato\n\nLol I think that's pretty self explanatory. Is this another troll job Sean? I think it could well be.\n\nBob Arum no doubt is a thieving scumbag but I think he's kind of funny. He smoked Sally Eckbach in the aftermath of the Macau brawl. He said \"First of all let me just say what an honour it is to be interviewed by a jewish reporter!\" lol\n\nSally Eckbach is worse than Arum in my opinion.\n\nCus' statement might ring more truth than any one of us can state here. The thing to remember is that Cus' statment might go much further back than the time of Tyson. Both he and Arum were involved in boxing before Tyson was born.\n\n.\n\nBob Arum has stood the test of time, meaning that he simply outlived and outlasted many of his contemporaries. However, I can remember others saying the same or similar about Arum and he was not very well trusted in the circles of boxing.\n\n.\n\nThe other thing to remember is that Cus was a bit of an outsider because he spoke his mind and that rubbed some people the wrong way. It doesn't mean he was wrong but liars and thieves don't like being called liars and thieves.\n\nTry talking to a member of Congress and you'll see my point. The difference is that they'll lie to your face because they're arrogant enough to believe you're stupid enough to fall for it. Wait, we're talking about Arum here. See my point?\n\n.\n\nThe point is that Cus isn't the only one to lable Arum in such a manner. Many others said similar and even more hinted it even if they didn't come out and say it. The problem with that is the longer Arum remained in boxing, the less safe it was to speak negatively about him.\n\n.\n\nIt's the American way in the new generation. Liars and thieves don't like being called liars and thieves. I suspect that Cus would say the same if he were alive today. He didn't seem to be moved by politics or care about the opinions of others, at least not as much as he cared about facts and truths.\n\n.\n\nBoxing is a very dishonest and disloyal business but Cus was probably the closest you'll get to an honest man.\n\nCus is dead for years now and we can only assume that he said those words at the time when he was still handling Mike Tyson in the late 80s. That would serve to explain why Tyson fought mainly for Don King who by comparison would appear to be the lesser evil than Arum,based on that statement.\n\nHow prophetic Cus was about Arum.\n\nArum has been the sole main source of boxing malfunction in the USA, the Western Hemisphere as a whole because of his continuing war against former wards Oscar and Floyd who have opted to break up with him and promote themselves as past greats Ali and even Holmes did in the last golden era of boxing. Such war has prevented his Top Rank fighters from fighting GBP boxers even in non-title fights to this day.\n\nArum in his bid to also dominate big fight boxing in Asia, the Eastern Hemisphere, is also beginning to be a main source of dysfunction as far as pro boxing is concerned in the region because of his obsession with staging what amounts as \"in-house\" ( or all-Top Rank fighters only) fights in the gambling capital of Macau in the vain bid to promote Western-style boxing and corner a juicy market in China, a country which has never embraced the sport due to its jealous love for its own traditional martial arts. This is in utter disregard for the historical and traditional seats of pro boxing in Asia as Manila, Tokyo and Bangkok. And what has Arum got to show for the effort? A lone Chinese world boxing champion for a country of billion people? A sprinkling of Pinoy fringe world champions when Japanese promoters on their own have produced a dozen major world titlists and a number of top contenders!\n\nCus was very right and prophetic about Arum.\n\n@ Novice---Why do you have to bring that broken record trash up here? You pactards are really intellectually challenged. How can Floyd and all those GBP fighters duck fighters from Top Rank when Arum refused to make them available as in Mares-Donaire and yes, Floyd-Pacquiao when Floyd called up Manny for a fight? Arum is really a greedy bastard.\n\n@ Rich--what do you mean about Eckbach being a Jewish reporter? Arum IS Jewish FYI!\n\nhahahah...you drag d amata just to justify that arum is the biggest reason why floyd did not fight margarito and pacquiao....hahahahhaha...\n\nbob arum is a vampire, money sucking mthrcker...but those things doesnt justify why floyd avoided those fighters because of bob arum...\n\n@teodore\n\ni understand that your god is floyd...you flomos was already exposed many times, that no matter what...you always protect your god floyd mayweather...i could not add more...because this question is to simply justify floyd by not being called a coward...you flomos have the same mindset...floyd backside, floyd backside, floyd backside...\n\nyoure wastin your time\n\neverybody knows who arum is...\n\nbut floyd took him 4 fu(kin years befor bringin it up?\n\nnobody will believe its really arum...\n\ncustard\n\nRead: http://www.just-one-liners.com/ppl/cus-damato"
