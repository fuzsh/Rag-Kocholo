        "text": "Premium hiking with audio and video information\n\nAt a total of 9 points along the trail, we have provided you with interesting information about the places and sights. You can walk the route using the route description (here the links to the information on youtube are marked as \"station\") or you can use the official and free Rheinland-Pfalz erleben app .\n\nAnd this is how it works on site: Start or install the Rhineland-Palatinate app, activate the GPS function of your smartphone, select the tour, click on \"open in app\" and select the map view. Now you can start the tour and always play the audio and video files at one of the symbols visible on the map. So you don't need to look at your smartphone all the time and can consciously experience the hike with your head up. To get you in the mood, we show you here in the video what all awaits you on the Leiningen Monastery Trail (Station 1)."
