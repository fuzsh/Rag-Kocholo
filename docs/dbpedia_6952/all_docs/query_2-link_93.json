        "text": "The concepts you are looking for are two categories of drainage basins, endhoreic basins and cryptorheic basins.\n\nEndhoreic basins are drainage basins that do not drain to the oceans, either above ground or below. The rivers in an endhoreic basin flow toward a local low spot. In some places these low spots are permanently covered by water. Examples includes the Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea, and the Great Salt Lake. I suspect you would not count these rivers as the bodies of water into which they flow are permanent.\n\nBut in other endhoreic basin the bodies of water are only occasionally wet. These dry lake beds become short-lived lakes in the rare case of exceptionally high precipitation. The Amargosa River, for example, occasionally experiences high flow rates and turns the normally bone dry Badwater Basin in Death Valley in California into a lake. This lake doesn't last very long at all.\n\nAnother example is Lake Eyre in South Australia. Lake Eyre is dry most of the time, but occasionally it does get visibly wet, and very rarely it gets quite wet and then takes a couple of years to dry. There are several rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin that occasionally feed the lake. One of them is the Fincke River, one of oldest rivers in the world. The Fincke River is typically dry. On the rare occasion when water runs through it, the flowing water usually sink into the ground before going very far. But every once in a while, sufficient rainfall falls to enable the Fincke to flow all the way to Lake Eyre.\n\nYet another example is Okavango River, as mentioned by Jean-Marie Prival. In the aftermath of the wet season, the Okavango Delta drains into the Thamalakane River, which in turn drains into the Boteti River, which in turn drains into the Ntwetwe Pan. The Ntwetwe Pan is typically a very dry and nearly lifeless salt pan. The Boteti usually dries up before it reaches the Ntwetwe Pan.\n\nThere are many other examples of endhoreic basins in the world where the lowest spot is a salt pan that is only occasionally covered with water.\n\nThe other category I mentioned are cryptorheic basins. These are typically associated with karst. Karst topography oftentimes results where the surface rock is made of easily dissolved limestone. Much of the drainage in cryptorheic basins is hidden because it occurs underground, hence the crypto prefix.\n\nThe upper Danube provides a nice example. It eventually runs dry almost half of the year because its waters sink into the Danube Sinkhole. This sinking happens all year round, but at times the above ground flow remains sufficient to keep the upper Danube flowing. The underground flow eventually merges to form the Radolfzeller Aach, which is a tributary of the Rhine. The underground flow drains to the North Sea while the above ground flow drains to the Black Sea.\n\nThere are many other losing streams (streams that lose rather than gain water) in the world. Another example is the Lost River in West Virginia. It disappears under Sandy Ridge and reemerges a couple of miles (three kilometers) away on the other side of the mountain as the headwaters of the Cacapon River. There are several other streams named Lost River in the US.\n\nEastern Australia also has many disappearing rivers. The Great Artesian Basin is a large cryptorheic basin that ultimately empties to the ocean. Some of the rivers in eastern Australia disappear, not because of evaporation, but because their waters sink to replenish the Great Artesian Basin."
