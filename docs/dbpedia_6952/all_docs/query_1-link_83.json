        "text": "Let’s pick this apart point by point:\n\n1. “So it should come as no surprise that nearly one-third of renters (and soon mortgage holders) are having trouble making their rents.”\n\nI’m going to assume that 1/3 figure is correct although as source would be nice. Anyways, comparing renters and mortgage is asinine. The people that lost their jobs are overwhelmingly renters. Don’t expect many defaults on the mortgage end.\n\n2. “In affluent Irvine, the Great Park area with a newly built section of homes went to close to zero sales from having steady sales in the past weeks.”\n\nThat’s what happens when there’s a stay at home order. Who’s thinking “Oh gee let’s go look at model homes!” When the sales office is most likely closed and no one’s thinking about buying homes in this short window of restrictions. That’s like saying “Walmart sales fell to ZERO between the hours of 12 AM and 6 AM” when the store is closed for business during that time. See I can sensationalize things too.\n\n3. “Housing volume has tanked to 6-year lows and it will go lower.”\n\nSee point #2. People are not worried about buying homes right now and sellers aren’t selling. What do you think will happen when things normalize? Not necessarily a swarm of buyers but business activity will pick back up steadily.\n\n4. “You should see the forums with AirBnB landlords”\n\nYou should see Las Vegas casinos too. It happens when you got a pandemic that affects travel.\n\nI cannot see how this translates to a major housing collapse. These arguments aren’t even relevant to the reality of the situation at hand. I’m not arguing that we’ll be back to the normal leaps in in YoY pricing but definitely we will not see a giant pullback in prices. The ONLY way that will happen is through an economic crisis that affects high earners and a dramatic increase in interest rates. The former is more likely to take hold than the latter once upcoming quarterly reports show less than stellar earnings and companies are forced to slash middle management jobs which are potential homebuyers. That’s why I say a 10-20% drop AT BEST. You’ll get more if and only IF interest rates shoot up to 5%+.\n\nAnd for the love of God or whoever you believe in please stop mentioning 2007-2009! That era was a completely different era that was centered around RE so of course it got hit hard. Anybody with any ounce of brain matter could’ve seen that coming. This is not the same and it’s foolish to assume so.\n\nInb4 tHiS tImE iTs DiFfErEnT\n\nWhen the Gravey Train STOPS, the ride is OVER- Earlier this week when we reported that JPMorgan has quietly halted all non-Paycheck Protection Program based loan issuance for the foreseeable future, we said that we didn’t buy the stated reason namely – the bank was drowning in (government-backstopped) applications and would be willing to forego millions in easy, recurring net interest income and that instead the real reason why JPMorgan would “temporarily suspend” all non-government backstopped loans such as PPP, is if the bank expects a default tsunami to hit, coupled with a full-blown depression that wipes out the value of assets pledged to collateralize the loans. We went on:\n\nFurthermore, why issue loans that will default in months if not weeks, just as bankruptcy courts fill up with millions of cases (assuming the coronavirus clears out by then, as the alternative is simply unthinkable – a default tsunami without any functioning Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 process) when JPM can simply stick to the 100% risk-free issuance of government-guaranteed small-business loans which pay a handsome 1% interest, especially if it makes JPM look patriotic by doing its duty to bail out America.\n\nOver the weekend our skepticism was confirmed when Reuters reported that JPMorgan, the countryâ€™s largest lender by assets and which will kick off earnings season tomorrow, will raise borrowing standards this week for most new home loans as the bank “moves to mitigate lending risk stemming from the novel coronavirus disruption.”\n\nStarting Tuesday, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the homeâ€™s value (something which we thought was the norm after the last financial crisis, but apparently lending conditions had eased quite a bit in the past decade).\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/economics/jpmorgan-scrambles-raise-mortgage-borrowing-standards-ahead-biggest-wave-defaults-history\n\nTo all that predict that things will go back to normal when the economy reopens:\n\n1) It won’t fully reopen for a while, as full reopen will mean new peaks in COVID-19 infections and deaths, followed by new shut downs. Just look at model by major investment banks. The Fed artificially floating stock market means nothing. They are just doing what they have to do to try and avoid bank and food runs.\n\n2) Even assuming the economy reopens fully due to vaccine or everyone just letting go of all dead old people, still you are all about to witness a phenomenon the economists call “negative multiplier effect” which will take couple months to fully unfold. The spread of the Coronavirus is causing many negative economic effects: a decline in travel â€“ leading to falling revenue for airlines and travel companies, a decline in trade and firms running out of spare parts, a fall in confidence causing a decrease in travel and a decrease in investment. These effects all cause a fall in demand and lower economic growth. However, they will be exacerbated by a negative multiplier effect which affects people not directly linked to the virus. For example, airline companies may have to lay off staff. People working for Vegas casinos lose their jobs and therefore there will a fall in consumer spending in these areas and a lot will default on mortgages. Leading to further falls in demand elsewhere in the economy – hard to even count. If there is a fall in global trade, all firms connected to trade and travel will see a fall in demand.\n\n3) Because of 1) and 2), IMF today predicted the world will ‘very likely’ experience worst recession since the 1930s.\n\nI am sitting in cash and gold, feeling pretty smart right now to have been saving for a rainy day. I work in management for a large healthcare organization but even I feel scared for my job right now. I rent and I plan on doing it, until this flushes through. And when it does, if I still have savings I will look again at RE as a place to put my saving. But right now? HELL NO!\n\nGood luck with that real estate investment!\n\nLong time lurker on the blog. Originally from the Midwest and moved out here 4 years ago for a job, wife and I are in our early to mid 30â€™s with a 1 year old. We live in downtown San Diego in an apartment so need to purchase a house for an expected growing family. Started reading last year as we wanted to get a better sentiment on what the over priced housing market was doing. As soon as COVID hit we got prequalified as we figured this was our best chance to get a house. From what I have seen there have been a few things that have occurred in the SD housing market over the past 4 weeks:\n\n1. Houses that were listed but didnâ€™t have to be sold by owner were left at their current price or pulled from the market.\n\n2. The expected influx of housing for the spring season has been significantly lower then previous years.\n\n3. The houses that need to be sold (job loss/relocation or new constructions that canâ€™t sit empty) are taking a price cut. The price cut has not been huge, maybe 5-10%, but enough to get the houses back to ~2018 prices.\n\nWeâ€™ve made an offer on a new construction for about $100k (7%) less than what it would have sold last year and it got accepted. Maybe we pulled the trigger too quick and housing will continue to drop but I honestly donâ€™t think youâ€™re going to see the >25% drops in prices that we saw at time of recession. I think for the next several weeks there will be some opportunities to get some good deals on houses (10-15% drop) in which people need to sell for whatever reason. However once we move into Summer and businesses open back up, which they will, then housing prices are going to normalize and we will continue on the over priced path that weâ€™ve been on for the last several years.\n\nDemand Destruction\n\nOne of the most important thing inflationists miss is demand destruction accompanied with or followed by credit destruction.\n\nCorporations will allow more people to work from home on a continual basis. That means reduced need for gasoline and fewer people eating out for lunch.\n\nCorporate travel will give way to more teleconferencing. That also means less travel, fewer hotels, less dining out.\n\nDue to loss in wages, demand for cars will plummet.\n\nMortgages are harder to get and more boomers will seek to downsize their homes. That means more supply and falling prices.\n\nStates will raise property taxes to meet revenue needs. That will further reduce demand for houses.\n\nSome people cutting their own hair will keep doing so.\n\nThe same lifestyles of eating out, buying expensive coffee, etc, etc. will pressure prices at restaurants, bars and coffee houses.\n\nCredit Destruction\n\nMany small businesses will go bankrupt as a result of the above demand destruction.\n\n$15 minimum wages will be icing in on the bankruptcy cake given falling demand.\n\nSome people will lose their houses in default.\n\nMalls were already in trouble but now even more people are tuned into buying things online. Those people will not go back to mall shopping. Expect more store closures and more bankruptcies as well.\n\nOnly economic illiterates believe the Fed’s balance sheet expansion outweighs those things. This is why I stress: pay attention to what matters.\n\nCredit Destruction\n\nMany small businesses will go bankrupt as a result of the above demand destruction.\n\n$15 minimum wages will be icing in on the bankruptcy cake given falling demand.\n\nSome people will lose their houses in default.\n\nMalls were already in trouble but now even more people are tuned into buying things online.

This is why I stress: pay attention to what matters.\n\nDeflation is not really about prices. It’s about the value of debt on the books of banks that cannot be paid back by zombie corporations and individuals.\n\nThat is what the Fed fears. It takes lower and lower yields to prevent a debt crash. But it is entirely counterproductive and it does not help the consumer, only the asset holders. Fed (global central bank) policy is to blame.\n\nThose expecting a massive surge of inflation missed the boat. We HAD a massive surge of inflation primarily reflected in asset prices, not consumer prices.\n\nBubbles are inherently deflationary.\n\nItâ€™s asset asset bubble deflation that is damaging, not routine price deflation.\n\nWhen asset bubbles burst, debt deflation results. People cannot pay back the loans they have taken out. Bank loans go sour and banks are reluctant to lend. Credit dries up.\n\nThe Fed can offer cheap money, but it cannot forces businesses to expand or hire. Due to demand destruction there will not be a quick rebound.\n\nKarin, as you know from your mother, it is irrelevant where you were born in Eastern Europe. I traveled in most of them, and there was no difference – socialism produces misery regardless of the language or culture; they were all equally poor and with no freedom. I just leave at that – Eastern Europe (not Russia). It is part of EU today.\n\nI am afraid that with each passing day, US will look more and more like the old Eastern Europe. It is going to be a rude awakening for many who never experienced that before. I already bought a nice property in one of the most conservative states in US, just in case; I am not sure for how long I can continue to live under our communist governor. On top of that, the worse it will get, the higher the chance for US to fracture in multiple independent countries – US will not be conquered but it has a good chance to implode like the former Roman Empire. At that time, I want to live in the most free of all with a culture to support those freedoms. I like to plan ahead when I see the writing on the wall. 3 years after I left Eastern Europe, everything collapsed there. I see a total collapse here soon. I am not afraid financially too much; I can build wealth anywhere if I am left free even if I start from scratch. The only thing I hate is dictatorship and totalitarianism and that is what we witness.\n\nThere were few steps taken in the wrong direction in US history (watershed moments): trample of state rights by Lincoln (centralization of power), the forming of the FED and IRS in 1913, 1972 decoupling from gold, 911, 2008 and now. These waves come more often and bigger and bigger like a tsunami.\n\nIn one of the posts above I mention the danger of derivatives for the bond market, which directly influences the RE market. Below is a comment Graham Summers made which explains this with a clear picture from the oil market:\n\n“Is Oil the Canary in the Coal Mine for a $640 Trillion Derivatives Disaster?\n\nLetâ€™s talk about what just happened with Oil prices.\n\nYesterday, Oil dropped to -$40 per barrel. That is not a typo. Oil was priced at NEGATIVE $40.\n\nOn Friday, it was priced at $27 per barrel.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nThis is possible because of derivatives: financial instruments that trade in opaque markets, with little oversight, and which regulators, including Congress, have permitted to become a systemic problem.\n\nIn its simplest rendering, yesterday oil traders who owned oil derivatives realized that if they continued to hold these derivatives, they (the traders) would have to actually take delivery on the physical oil they owned. Weâ€™re talking thousands and thousands of oil barrels being delivered.\n\nThe traders donâ€™t want the actual physical oil. They simply want to be able to trade oil prices. So, they dumped their derivatives at any priceâ€¦ including PAYING someone to take the derivatives off of their hands.\n\nThis is how you get NEGATIVE oil prices. And it reveals the degree to which the financial system has become totally overrun with derivatives, leverage, and financial trickery.\n\nEven worse, Oil is not the only asset class that has been overrun with derivatives. The bulk of trading in every commodity, including gold, involves derivatives. The same is true of BONDS.\n\nDerivatives are used to hide losses, manipulate prices, and even fake profits. They are a massive problem that nearly blew up the financial system in 2008â€¦ and as oilâ€™s implosion yesterday revealed, remain a major problem today as well.\n\nHow big a problem are we talking?\n\nThe last official data on the global derivatives market puts it at $640 TRILLION, or over SEVEN TIMES GLOBAL GDP.\n\nWhat happened in oil is a signal that this financial monstrosity is once again rearing its head. The question now is just how horrific the carnage will be.”\n\nNo, things are not going to be ‘normal’ after we turn switch on for the economy. We’ll just see then the wreckage done to it.\n\nFrom the LA Times:\n\nThe Southern California housing market has seized up.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has closed businesses and kept people hunkered down in their homes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, itâ€™s also resulted in a market that experts describe as essentially frozen.\n\nData released Thursday from real estate company Zillow show the number of deals entering escrow has fallen off a cliff since mid-March. But so too have the number of owners who are listing their house or condo for sale.\n\nBecause the market isnâ€™t being flooded yet with listings, lower demand is being met with lower supply, and prices are holding relatively steady.\n\nJeff Tucker, an economist at Zillow, summed it up as such: â€œLike a canoe being carried by two people who drop both ends simultaneously, the market slowdown may not tip clearly in favor of buyers or sellers.â€\n\nThat surely could change as the pandemic progresses. On Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total since mid-March to about 26 million people.\n\nAs more homeowners struggle to pay their mortgage, more homes could be forced onto the market.\n\nIn the week that ended April 19, home buyers in Los Angeles and Orange counties signed sales contracts for nearly 60% fewer homes than the same period last year. Similar declines were seen a week earlier.\n\nTraditional housing market indicators are based on closed deals, meaning that March sales data mostly reflect deals that entered escrow in February and even January â€” a time before stay-at-home orders and widespread concern over death tolls.\n\nThe data from Zillow covers so-called pending sales â€” when a buyer enters escrow â€” and provides a more current look into the virusâ€™ effect on the housing market.\n\nJudging by the sharp drop-off in listings, not only are fewer owners putting their homes up for sale, but also some have outright pulled them off the market.\n\nReal estate agents say some sellers donâ€™t want people touring their home during a global pandemic. Others simply donâ€™t need to sell and are holding back to see how the current situation evolves.\n\nThe number of homes on the market during the week that ended April 19 fell nearly 31% from a year earlier, according to Zillow.\n\nThere are signs that prices are softening. The median list price in Los Angeles and Orange counties was $856,575 in the week that ended April 19, according to Zillow. Thatâ€™s down about 7% from mid-March but still 7% higher than the same period last year.\n\nNormally, when the housing market slows, sales are the first shoe to drop because owners are hesitant to take less money. As homes go unsold, inventory swells and sellers eventually give in, forcing prices downward.\n\nBut unlike the crash of 2008 or the relatively minor slowdown in 2018 and 2019, inventory isnâ€™t rising. Itâ€™s falling.\n\nâ€œThese are really unusual times,â€ Tucker said. â€œThis external force that is driving buyers out of the market is also a pretty good reason for sellers to hold off from selling. People are literately worried about the health of having a bunch of strangers and real estate agents come through their home.â€\n\nIn some cases, as in the city of Los Angeles, in-person showings of homes is banned, to stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Home sales can still continue, but the pool of people willing to buy a house without first walking through it is limited.\n\nResearch from Zillow indicates a similar situation played out in Hong Kong in 2003 during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Home prices didnâ€™t fall much, while the number of transactions plunged as people kept their distance from one another to save lives. The market, along with the economy, then bounced back once the epidemic was over.\n\nSARS lasted several months in Hong Kong and killed 774 people worldwide. In the United States alone, almost 50,000 have lost their lives to COVID-19 so far. And social distancing edicts, or surges in the death count from relaxing measures, could roil the economy for many months to come.\n\nThe federal government has stepped in to provide relief in the form of cash payments and mortgage forbearance. But if people remain out of work for long, more would probably be forced to sell their homes or even enter foreclosure. In that case, supply would rise at a time of depressed demand, raising the prospect for full-scale price declines.\n\nInterestingly, although demand has temporarily decreased due to the virus, it appears\n\nthat supply has followed suit. Resulting, of course, by the law of Supply and Demand in price stability in most markets here.\n\nVanishing inventory props up SoCal home prices – The Real …therealdeal.com â€º 2020/04/24\n\nBefore the virus, inventory was at a 3.8 mos. supply, and will eventually return to that\n\nlow number if the lock down doesn’t persist long term. How long before demand returns depends upon job returns.\n\nRental wise tenants are protected via eviction moratoriums. But short sighted Pols won’t acknowledge that landlords, many mom and pop, also need moratoriums on property taxes, utilities, mortages… Bailouts are generally borne by all taxpayers not just by one segment. Except, of course, in the minds of socialist leftists, i.e.- Cali Dems.\n\nIf I were renting right now and unemployed, I would try to pay some rent or at least let the landlord know I’m doing what I can, and then catch it up when the jobs return. Later on when normalcy returns, who wants an eviction on their credit in a tight rental market. That can result in moving out of state or homelessness.\n\nSo, predictions of a crash greater than 2008 aren’t borne out by current data. What happens in the next few mos. or a year is up for grabs.\n\nâ€œThe Orange County Register in California. â€œA routine report released Tuesday, April 28, paints a picture of a housing market that might have been, but thanks to the coronavirus outbreak, is no more.â€\n\nâ€“ Stick a fork in it.

He does not, however, predict big losses for home values.â€\n\nâ€œIn fact, due to the ongoing housing shortage, home prices are likely to squeeze out a gain in 2020 to a new record high,â€ he added,â€¦â€\n\nWith some tenants unable to pay rent, small landlords ask for help.\n\nUnemployment is continuing to grow during this pandemic, and people are struggling to pay their bills.\n\nThe challenges have some tenants calling for a rent strike, but small landlords say theyâ€™re also fighting to survive.\n\nWashington State has an eviction freeze until June 4, but some tenants unable to pay rent worry theyâ€™ll be kicked out of their homes as soon as itâ€™s over.\n\nContent Continues Below\n\nIt has signs like â€œrent moratorium nowâ€ showing up all over Seattle.\n\nâ€œWe rely on our rents to support ourselves at this point in our lives.

Any present stats that you look at related to housing are meaningless to both sides . What is impt is 30 million unemployed a very large % with above average income and 1000s of big businesses and millions of small businesses that will not survive.\n\nThe fed is pushing trillions into the market as I have said over and over there will be a V shape recovery in the stock market likely for 3-6 mos but after that the SHTF big time as landlord , renters and mortgage holders all have to pay up and employment does not recover enough to really help, 2-3x the debt of the previous recession with 10-11%unemployment at the same now it will likely peak at 25 % hopefully no higher.\n\nThe denial is obvious but before the end of this year the drop will occur in stocks ,real estate etc. deflation and depression the reset is here to offset years of fed stupidity and wall street corruption and to maintain a status quo would take trillions /wk the dollar and our debt financing would never survive that.\n\nLive in denial but reality is finally coming like it or not even Musk is being realistic not a good sign for the markets!\n\nOkay. I live in the mid west so there are probably not many AIRBNB to drag the market down. But in my area, house prices are shooting up like crazy. Prices have risen 13-15% since the beginning of the year.\n\nInventory for anything under $250k is almost zero. Just a side note, 6 months ago I could find close to 50 houses in my city under $150k and probably 300 under $250k. Now I can find about 50 under $250k. I only started looking the past couple of days for a friend. When I am on the redfin or zillow, and do a search under $200k, I see close to 150 houses, it is just that about 125 are all pending.\n\nIn the past 2 months, I have also received more cold calls, text messages, and letters offering to buy my house. The number is larger than the past 4 years combined.\n\nOf course, these are investors trying to scoop up as many properties as they can with these low interest rates. That is my guess because we know there are about 30 million unemployed people who would not qualify for a loan right now.\n\nInventory is at an all time low. I expected such as people who were thinking about selling may not want strange people who may be contagious walking through their house.\n\nThis is crazy. If there is a game changer drug that is announced in the next few months….will we see some crazy inflation with all the money that has been printed.\n\nStick a fork in CA market, its toast- From Bloomberg on California. â€œTesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk listed two of his California homes for sale Sunday, days after announcing that he would get rid of most of his possessions. Heâ€™s seeking a combined $39.5 million for the Bel Air properties, according to the listings on Zillow. Both are for sale by owner. As for high-end Los Angeles real estate, itâ€™s not exactly a sellerâ€™s market at the moment. Sales of luxury homes already were suffering from a supply glut and weak demand before the coronavirus pandemic stopped most showings.â€\n\nThe Real Deal on California. â€œThe pandemic has slowed down Los Angelesâ€™ housing market, but there are still buyers and sellers looking to transact. 25175 Jim Bridger Road | $8.1M | Hidden Hills. The home was listed for just under $9 million as recently as a year ago, and the price dropped to $8.6 million in late April. 7847 Torreyson Drive | $8.3M | Laurel Canyon. It last sold for $11.4 million in 2015 and was listed in July of last year asking $9.5 million.â€\n\nFrom The Sun on California. â€œA mega mansion once owned by a newspaper tycoon has been put on the market for $70 million less than its asking price. But the 18-bed luxury home, with capacity for a whopping 400 guests, will still set you back a cool $125 million. The house is three blocks away from Sunset Boulevard and boasts an Olympic-size swimming pool, tennis court, cinemas and colossal terraces. It was originally put on sale for $195 million.â€\n\nThe Orange County Register in California. â€œWeâ€™ve seen this scenario before. A sudden shock to the economy. Jobs lost. Lenders in trouble. Some early reports on April activity suggest discounting may have begun already. Zillow looked at listing trends for existing homes and condos and found the median asking price in Los Angeles and Orange counties, as of April 19, was $856,575 â€” down 7% in a month. Yes, itâ€™s up 7% in a year but this same metric was growing at an 18% annual pace as of mid-March.â€\n\nâ€œAs for new homes, the Meyers Group is now polling homebuilders on a weekly basis. Its latest survey shows 60% of Southern California division presidents are offering â€˜concessionsâ€™ â€” buyer incentives that can range from helping with financing costs to paying agents to bring in customers. Short-run price fluctuations can be volatile and, at times, tricky to read. They can vary by price niches (luxury homes are weak sellers today) or neighborhoods (think, beach-close). And some price cuts arenâ€™t always seen in market stats, such as sellers picking up repair bills, upgrade expenses or closing costs that theyâ€™d otherwise skip.â€\n\nâ€œThe pandemic is putting cracks in the residential real estate game. Look at the ailing rental market. Some Southern Californians canâ€™t pay their rent. In turn, local landlords are lowering rents to keep units full. This could dull the investment appeal of local homes.â€\n\nIf you bought a house in 2020, you are about to LO$E BiGLY\n\nThis is the future of RE in S.

The 2-3 weeks lockdown became 2-3 months with extensions to November 4, if they win the WH; if not, for the next 2-3 years.\n\nToday, governor Gruesome decided to cut all state employees wages by 10%. While applaud this, it is only a small beginning. Soon he will make cuts not only 50% in salaries but 50% in workforce. Why? Because no bank is going to lend to a bankrupt state and no sane CEO will keep the business in CA to become a milking cow for gov. Gruesome.\n\nWell the governor acts this way, because contrary to what he says, he cares exactly zero about lives and businesses destroyed as long as as he can act as the tyrant he is and someone else will pay for the consequences.\n\nOn the bright side, the Californians will become so sick of electing totalitarian communists that the democrats will not get in power for a generation unless they steal and falsify all votes (based on their history I would not be surprised)."
