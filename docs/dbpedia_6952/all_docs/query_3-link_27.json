        "text": "The village mill in Großkarlbach, which is 8 km away, was previously a mill powered by the water power of the Eckbach. After its restoration, the mill was used for demonstration purposes and houses the Leiningerland Mill Museum in Großkarlbach and the mayor's office. Of the 7 former mills in Großkarlbach, it was the only one that was located within the gates of the medieval, fortified village, hence the name. The Eckbach mill hiking path leads past the mill. Five of the mills in the town are still more or less well preserved, and 4 of these are used for residential purposes. Of these mills, the Pappelmühle (poplar mill) was in operation until the 1980s.\n\nThe Mill Museum now includes a completely functional millstone from a flour mill and other historic exhibit pieces.\n\nDonations from the facilities of other mills have made the development of the museum possible. For example, the mill wheel, newly acquired for demonstration purposes, along with other parts of a mill come from Grafenhausen in the Black Forest. Other historic exhibit pieces such as a sack beating machine and workshop equipment were provided by former mills in Kleinkarlbach, Laumersheim, Osthofen, and Schelklingen-Talsteußlingen.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
