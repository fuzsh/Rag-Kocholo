Your journey begins here!\n\nOur Services | River Cruise | Europe Trips | Ocean Cruises | Blog | Specials | About | Travel Request\n\nA Comprehensive Guide to the Best European River Cruise Routes\n\nHow to Get the Best European River Cruises\n\nThe purpose of this page is provide you a comprehensive guide of the available Europe River Cruise Routes, so you can decide on which route will be the best for your next Europe river cruise vacation.\n\nEurope has the distinction of the continent with the largest number of navigable rivers compared to other regions of the world. They are often devoid of major obstacles such as waterfalls and rapids, and are usually wide and deep enough to allow a steady passage of people and material on all types of sailing vessels. Combine the easy navigation with captivating sights such as castles, vineyards, capital cities and small, quaint villages and it is clear to me why folks would want to sail these amazing rivers!\n\nEurope Rivers Photo Map from AmaWaterways\n\nWe are often ask “Which river should we sail on for my first Europe river cruise?” My short answer is take multiple trips--I would sail on all of them! However, the problem is that most of us don’t have unlimited time and money to sail them all.\n\nSo to solve this dilemma, here is our guide to the European River routes most available to you. I will describe the river, point out a couple of highlights and why you might consider sailing on this river. The routes may be very short or may cover larger distances. While there are some variations, many lines essentially cruise the same route on the most popular European rivers.\n\nSince most folks want to know what the best starting rivers are if they have never taken a European River cruise, by far the two most popular rivers are the Rhine and the Upper Danube, so let’s explore them first together. Then will examine the remaining Europe Rivers you might want to consider for your vacation.\n\nReady?—Let’s cruise together!\n\nThe Rhine River & Its Tributaries\n\nMuch of western European civilization developed around the Rhine River and its tributaries. The Rhine is the busiest commercial river in Europe, yet it is also famous for castles, and vineyards. The commercial boats, along with the local ferries and other boats all seem to work well with river cruise ships and do not detract from the iconic sites along the river, as the best stretches are often protected from commercial activity that could spoil the sights.\n\nThe 820 mile Rhine actually passes through 6 countries, but most folks consider it a German River since so much of its banks are on German soil. The middle Rhine and especially the Rhine River Gorge, has the greatest concentration of scenic banks and castles in all Europe. It never gets old!\n\nThere are three main routes:\n\nLower Rhine Northern Loop Route of Tulip Time Map from AmaWaterways\n\nThe Seine route is a 7 day round trip cruise into Normandy, starting and ending in Paris. The cruise highlights are Monet's village of Giverny; the harbor town of Honfleur; Rouen, the historic capital of Normandy and the spot where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431 (also of special note is the 700 restored half-timber buildings in the old quarter); as well as a chance to visit the medieval towns along this scenic route and visit the D-Day Normandy beaches. This is a gentle voyage along farmland and meadows, historic towns and good food such as brie and camembert cheeses, calvados (apple brandy) and Normandy cider. If you like history, such as the 100 Years War between England and France, want to learn more about the largest amphibious landing in history at the D Day beaches, and like impressionist paintings, this is the cruise for you.\n\nTypical Douro cruise route. Map from AmaWaterways\n\nThe Douro (Douro translates as Gold in English) is a Portugal round trip adventure, usually starting and ending in Porto, Portugal. This region is famous for Port Wine. The only river cruising in Portugal is along the Douro River. This river starts in the high hills of Picos de Urbion and flows west to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nPorto is the second largest city in Portugal and famous for Port wine and seafood. The Douro is an unspoiled river decorated with deep gorges, lush vineyards and sleepy fishing villages. Also many manor homes and wine growing estates are waiting for cruisers to explore, along with the small fortified village Castelo Rodrigo. Many cruises offer a chance to visit the Spanish villages of Salamanca and Vega Terron, two important medieval towns. This is a cruise for wine lovers, especially the desert wine port, also a cruise for those who want to sample and learn more about Portuguese cuisine, and for adventures who love new destinations.\n\nPorto, Portugal. This photo was taken by the Howards on their AmaWaterways Douro Cruise.\n\nThe Volga\n\nThe 2,294-mile-long Volga is the largest river in Europe. The river is often referred to as “Mother Volga”, because it is so important to the lives of the Russian people. Due to Russian laws, cruise lines can only lease their ships, so sometimes the normal comforts and high standards of Europe cruise lines are not always available on Volga River cruises. One cruise line, Scenic, has built a new vessel that really approaches the expected standards of Europe river cruises. Currently, Scenic, Uniworld and Viking sail the Volga.\n\nThe political situation of Russia and US have reduced the demand here and the future is uncertain at best.\n\nOn a typical Volga cruise, the route is from St. Petersburg to Moscow (or reverse) and these two cities dominate the cruise itineraries. In Moscow, a visit to the Kremlin, shows the power of the largest country of the world. In St. Petersburg, the most western of Russian cities, the Hermitage museum, Catherine’s Palace and Peterhof are a unique look at the lives and treasures of the tars of Russia. Expect a 2 week or so cruise—it will always be longer than a week cruise..\n\nThere is more to see than these two great cites. They include Kizhi Island, an isolated tourist destination set at almost the center of Lake Onega, home to an open-air museum made up of more than 80 wooden buildings. In the small river town of Goritsy travelers can visit the Kirillo-Belozersky monastery, which was built in 1397 and is home to a vast collection of Russian Orthodox icons. Yaroslavl, a city located at the intersection of the Volga and Kotorosl Rivers, is another important site for Russia. It is one of eight principal cities that make up the Golden Ring, a group of ancient cities and towns that were instrumental in the founding of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nA Volga cruise offers a chance to see Russia’s two largest cities, learn about rural Russia and the history of the Russian Orthodox Church .It also offers a chance to sample some Vodka and caviar. The Volga is famous for its caviar—4 species of sturgeon live in the river and make many very happy with this gourmet delight. This is a great cruise for the experienced traveler who wants a window into Russia\n\nSamson Fountain at Peterhof Place, just outside of St. Petersburg\n\nThe Elbe and the Po\n\nLesser known routes include the Elbe (Germany) and the Po (Italy).\n\nIf you are a real student of Europe River Cruising and my blogs, you may have noticed I did not include glowing reports of two river systems in earlier blogs—the Elbe and the Po. I have a difficult time recommending these cruises—many times folks who chose these routes are disappointed.\n\nThe Elbe (724 miles long) is primarily located in the eastern part of Germany and provides a good chance to see eastern Germany and parts of the Czech Republic. It is a very shallow river and cruises often become glorified bus tours, as the low water levels restrict the ability to safely sail these rivers.\n\nOnly 2 river cruise companies at present sail the Elbe. They are Viking and CroisiEurope. If you really want to sail the Elbe, you might consider the paddlewheel ships of CroisiEurope, but be prepared for a cruise where the primary on-board language is French. Highlights of this cruise route include Berlin, Hamburg, Wittenberg (where Martin Luther started the Protestant Revolution) the palace of Sanssouci in Potsdam (Fredrick the Great’s Prussian palace) and Prague. For some, the outstanding sites to visit make this a great trip, but as they say, go with the flow if you choose this cruise—most reviewers claim the Elbe is the most cancelled or modified Europe river cruise.\n\nThis paddle wheel boat is in Berlin, Germany but very similar to one used by CroisiEurope on the Elbe River.\n\nThe Po is a glorified bus tour, in my opinion, as only 100 miles or so of the cruise is sailing on the Po; the rest is bus tours to the sights. Navigation is the problem on the Po; it is a very swift-flowing river and has obstacles such as constantly shifting river banks. This cruise will spend most of its time in or near Venice. Uniworld and CroisiEurope sail this route.\n\nUniworld is the only US major cruise line to offer this tour. The boat is really more a stationary hotel, with minimal cruising. Cruise and bus tours visit Venice, the Po River Delta areas, the islands around Venice and Verona (Roman amphitheater and Romeo and Juliet fame). It also offers a good chance to sample the local cuisine, including Bologna (cold cuts) and Parma (hams and cheese).\n\nWe would recommend these only for really experienced river cruises or those with a very special interest in these limited river cruises\n\nMy Final Thoughts\n\nWhat a lot of great choices—I’m ready to go!\n\nWhile there are some variations, many lines cruise essentially cruise the same routes on the most popular European rivers. The river routes may be very short or may cover larger distances, depending upon the route you select. While I have covered primarily 7 day cruises, many of these routes can be combined for longer cruises of 14 or 21 days or more. River cruising is about the destinations, in my opinion, so the correct itinerary is critical to provide you the river cruise experience you desire for these special trips. We hope this quick summary will provide you a good overview of what is possible in Europe river cruising.\n\nEvery major cruise company also offers pre/post stays so along with the river cruise you can get some extended time in some of the best of Europe's cities. We have been to almost all major cities in Europe and we have developed our own guides for 50 top Europe cities, so not only can we provide information on pre/post stays, we can also plan your stays to customize your trip"
