        "text": "The rivers of Europe dataset is derived from the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) HydroSHEDS drainage direction layer and a stream network layer. The source of the drainage direction layer was the 15-second Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM). The raster stream network was determined by using the HydroSHEDS flow accumulation grid, with a threshold of about 1000 kmÂ² upstream area.\n\nThe stream network dataset consists of the following information: the origin node of each arc in the network (FROM_NODE), the destination of each arc in the network (TO_NODE), the Strahler stream order of each arc in the network (STRAHLER), numerical code and name of the major basin that the arc falls within (MAJ_BAS and MAJ_NAME); - area of the major basin in square km that the arc falls within (MAJ_AREA); - numerical code and name of the sub-basin that the arc falls within (SUB_BAS and SUB_NAME); - area of the sub-basin in square km that the arc falls within (SUB_AREA); - numerical code of the sub-basin towards which the sub-basin flows that the arc falls within (TO_SUBBAS) (the codes -888 and -999 have been assigned respectively to internal sub-basins and to sub-basins draining into the sea). The attributes table now includes a field named \"Regime\" with tentative classification of perennial (\"P\") and intermittent (\"I\") streams.\n\nSupplemental Information:\n\nThis dataset is developed as part of a GIS-based information system on water resources for the European continent. It has been published in the framework of the AQUASTAT - programme of the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nContact points:\n\nMetadata contact: AQUASTAT FAO-UN Land and Water Division\n\nContact: Jippe Hoogeveen FAO-UN Land and Water Division\n\nContact: Livia Peiser FAO-UN Land and Water Division\n\nData lineage:\n\nThe linework of the map was obtained by converting the stream network to a feature dataset with the Hydrology toolset in ESRI ArcGIS.The Flow Direction and Stream Order grids were derived from hydrologically corrected elevation data with a resolution of 15 arc-seconds.The elevation dataset was part of a mapping product, HydroSHEDS, developed by the Conservation Science Program of World Wildlife Fund.Original input data had been obtained during NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).\n\nOnline resources:\n\nDownload - Rivers of Europe (ESRI shapefile)\n\nGeneral information regarding the HydroSHEDS data product"
