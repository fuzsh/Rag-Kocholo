        "text": "For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing. And you are to love those who are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt. Deuteronomy 10:17-19\n\nHe will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. 1 Samuel 2:9\n\nThe God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; thou saved me from violence. I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 2 Samuel 22:3-4\n\nI will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makes me dwell in safety. Psalm 4:8\n\nBut let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You. Psalm 5:11\n\nBut you, O God, do see trouble and grief; you consider it to take it in hand. The victim commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless. Break the arm of the wicked and evil man; call him to account for his wickedness that would not be found out. The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land. You hear, O LORD, the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more. Psalms 10:14-18\n\nAs for God, His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him. Psalm 18:30\n\nYou shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the plots of man; You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. Psalm 31:20\n\nYou are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. Psalm 32:7\n\nHow precious is Your loving kindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. Psalm 36:7\n\nThe Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he will be blessed on the earth; You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies. Psalm 41:2\n\nBe merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me! For my soul trusts in You; and in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, until these calamities have passed by. Psalm 57:1\n\nA father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling. Psalm 68:5\n\nFor the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in thee. Psalm 84:11-12\n\nPsalm 91:1-16 (A compilation made from the Complete Jewish, God’s Word Translation, and New American Standard Bibles.)\n\nYou who live in the shelter of the Most High, who spend your nights in the shadow of the Almighty, who say to the LORD, “My refuge! My fortress! My God, in whom I trust!” – He will rescue you from the trap of the hunter, and from the plague of disease. He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you will find refuge; His truth is a shield and a protection.\n\nYou will not fear the terrors of night, or the arrow that flies by day, or the sickness that roams in the dark, or even the destruction that lays waste at noon. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it won’t come near you. Only keep your eyes open, and you will see how the wicked are punished. For you have made the LORD, the Most High, who is my refuge, your dwelling place. No disaster will happen to you, no calamity will come near your house; for He will order His angels to care for you and guard you wherever you go. They will carry you in their hands, so that you won’t trip on a stone. You will tread down lions and snakes, young lions and serpents you will trample underfoot.\n\n“Because he loves Me, I will rescue him; because he knows My Name, I will protect him. He will call upon Me, and I will answer him. I will be with him when he is in trouble. I will rescue him and bring him honor. I will satisfy him with long life and show him My salvation.”\n\nBehold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. Psalm 121:4-8\n\nThough I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. Psalm 138:7\n\nThe LORD watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked. Psalm 146:9\n\nHe holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones. Then you will understand what is right and just and fair—every good path. Proverbs 2:7-9\n\nMy son, let not them (His words) depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. Proverbs 3:21-23\n\nThe name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runs into it, and is safe. Proverbs 18:10\n\nDo not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you. Proverbs 23:10-11\n\nThe fear of man brings a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe. Proverbs 29:25\n\nEvery word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Proverbs 30:5\n\nlearn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. Isaiah 1:17\n\nNo weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue [that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. Isaiah 54:17\n\nLeave your orphans; I will protect their lives. Your widows too can trust in me. Jeremiah 49:11\n\nThen the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them. Ezekiel 34:27\n\n“So I will come near to you for judgment. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive aliens of justice, but do not fear me,” says the LORD Almighty. Malachi 3:5\n\nI will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. John 14:18\n\nPeace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 14:27\n\nHowbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. John 16:13\n\nThese things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. John 16:33\n\nI will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name—the name you gave me—so that they may be one as we are one. While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled. I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. John 17:11-19\n\nWho shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:35-39\n\n(Love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Corinthians 13:7\n\nHonor thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) That it may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the earth. Ephesians 6:2\n\nHe has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:13–14\n\nBut the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one. 2 Thessalonians 3:3\n\nFor God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1:7\n\nAre they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? Hebrews 1:14\n\n…For He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” So we may boldly say: “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?” Hebrews 13:5–6\n\n…if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. 2 Peter 2:5-9"
