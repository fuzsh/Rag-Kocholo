Albert Einstein's Parents -

Hermann and Pauline Koch Einstein

Were married in 1876.

Pauline - a young maiden just eighteen years,

While Hermann, a twenty-nine years old man.

It was a happy marriage!

When Albert was born to the couple

In southern German town of Ulm,

On a Friday, in 1879,

Their joy knew no bounds!

They welcomed their little bundle of joy,

With great celebration in their hearts!

Papa Hermann looked at his son, most lovingly

For the first time, after the birth of his eldest child,

Like every affectionate father would do with doting eyes.

At that time, Hermann had no inkling that his little boy

Would be, in future, declared as a genius

And become a celebrity scientist of this world.

What the Parents were more concerned, at birth,

Was that the baby was born with a large head

Angular in shape, different from normal babies.

However, their doctor dismissed it,

As no cause for worry and assured the Parents

That the head would soon become a normal size.

Two years later, in 1881, a little girl was born

To Hermann and Pauline. They named her Maja.

They introduced Albert to his baby sister

As somebody whom he can play with.

Albert, two and half years old, asked his parents:

'Yes, but where are its wheels? '

Albert and Maja were raised with much care and affection

In a congenial atmosphere of close family bonding!

Though both Parents were of Jewish origin,

They prioritised education above religion,

Inculcating a deep desire in their children,

For higher learning, education and valuable knowledge!
