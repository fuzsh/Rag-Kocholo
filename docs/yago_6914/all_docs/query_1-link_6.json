Hermann married Pauline Koch on 8 August 1876 in Cannstatt.[1] They had two children, Albert and Maria \"Maja\". Hermann died in 1902 in Milan, Italy.[2][3]\n\nHis parents Abraham Einstein and Helene Moos married in Buchau in April of 1839. They were non-practicing Jews. They had six children.[4]\n\nHermann obtained his secondary education in Stuttgart, Germany. He was a good student with a gift for mathematics, among other subjects. Due to the lack of funds available to him and his family, he was unable to obtain a higher education. He thereafter became a merchant in Stuttgart.\n\nAt the insistence of his brother Jakob, Hermann and his family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880. Hermann and Jakob founded an electrical engineering company there. Hermann continued his employment at the new company as the merchandiser. Jakob was the technician in the company.\n\nAfter losing out on a large contract because they did not have the funds to invest in AC current versus the DC current they employed at their factory, they moved to Pavia, Italy in 1894. Hermann forced his son, Albert, to stay with relatives in Munich to complete his education there.\n\nHermann later founded another electrical engineering company in Milan without his brother, with financial support from his wife's relatives. Although this company was profitable, his health began to suffer in the last years due to worries about his finances. He died of heart failure on October 10, 1902 at the age of 55 in Milan.\n\nAlthough Hermann was supportive of his son Albert's career, he was a very stern father with Albert, who was a free thinker and who questioned the establishment. It was Albert's mother and her family, who financially supported Albert's education.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Familienbuch Ulm 1800-1926, Personenstandsregister jüdischer Gemeinden in Württemberg, Baden und Hohenzollern / (18. - 20.
