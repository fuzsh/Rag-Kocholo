His father was Hermann Einstein, and his mother was Pauline Koch. His father was a featherbed salesman, and later he ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. Albert Einstein had one sister, named Maria. His family moved to Munich, where he started his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, his parents moved to Italy, where he continued his education at Arau, Switzerland. He went to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich in 1896. There, he was trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, Albert gained his diploma and acquired Swiss citizenship. At that time, he didn't get the teaching post, but he took a position as a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. He gained his doctor's degree in 1905.\n\nAlbert Einstein would write that in his early years, two wonders deeply affected him. The first was his encounter with the compass. At that time, he was five years old. He was puzzled that invisible forces could deflect the needle. And the second one was when he discovered a book of geometry at the age of 12 and called it his \"sacred little geometry book\".\n\nIn the Swiss Patent Office, when he got spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work. He was appointed Privatdozent in Berne in 1908. He became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich in 1909 and Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague in 1911. In the following year, he returned to Zurich to fill a similar post.\n\nHe was also appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute in 1914 and Professor at the University of Berlin. In 1914, he became a citizen of Germany and remained in Berlin until 1933. In 1940, he became a United States citizen and retired from his post in 1945.\n\nAlbert Einstein married Mileva Maric in 1903. The couple had a daughter and two sons. In 1919, they divorced. In the same year, Albert married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal, who died in 1936.\n\nInternational Day of Mathematics 2022: Do you know what happened on this day?\n\nAlbert Einstein: Scientific Career and Inventions\n\nAlbert Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement after World War II. He was also offered the Presidency of the State of Israel, but he declined it, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in developing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nHe was always interested in solving the problems of physics and also had a clear view and determination to solve them. He made his strategy his own and was able to visualise the main stages on the way to his goal. In fact, he saw his critical achievements as merely one more step toward the next level of advancement.\n\nWhen his scientific work started, Albert Einstein realised the inadequacies of Newtonian mechanics and his special theory of relativity emanated from an attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field.\n\nHe worked on classical problems of statistical mechanics and problems in which they were merged with quantum theory. This paved the way for an explanation of the Brownian movement of molecules. He explored the properties of light with a low radiation density, and his observations and survey laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.\n\nHe postulated the correct interpretation of the special theory of relativity in the early days of Berlin and also furnished a theory of gravitation. He published his paper on the general theory of relativity in 1916. At this point in time, he also contributed to the problems of the theory of radiation and statistical mechanics.\n\nHe embarked on the construction of unified field theories in the 1920s, and he was also working on the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory. He preserved this work in America.\n\nBy developing a quantum theory of monoatomic gas, he contributed to statistical mechanics. He also did valuable work in connection with atomic transition probabilities and relativistic cosmology.\n\nAfter taking retirement, he continued to work towards the unification of the basic concepts of physics. He took the opposite approach to geometrisation as the majority of physicists.\n\nHe received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine, and philosophy from several European and American universities.\n\nAlbert Einstein: Important Works\n\nHis important works include:\n\nSpecial Theory of Relativity (1905),\n\nRelativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950),\n\nGeneral Theory of Relativity (1916),\n\nInvestigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), and\n\nThe Evolution of Physics (1938).\n\nNon-scientific works are:\n\nAbout Zionism (1930),\n\nWhy War? (1933),\n\nMy Philosophy (1934), and\n\nOut of My Later Years (1950)\n\nImportant Days in March 2023: National and International Dates List\n\nAlbert Einstein: Awards and Honours\n\nBarnard Medal (1920)\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (1921)\n\nMatteucci Medal (1921)\n\nForMemRS (1921)\n\nCopley Medal (1925)\n\nGold Medal (1926)\n\nMax Planck Medal (1929)\n\nBenjamin Franklin Medal (1935)\n\nMember of the National Academy of Sciences (1942)\n\nTime Person of the Century (1999)\n\nAlbert Einstein: Legacy\n\nThe work of Einstein continues to win Nobel Prizes for successful physicists.\n\nA Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of Bose-Einstein condensates in 1995.\n\nBlack holes are now known to number in the thousands.\n\nAlso, new generations of space satellites have continued to verify the cosmology of Einstein.\n\nLet's scroll through some tweets to witness his legacy:\n\nOn April 17, 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm that Rudolph Nissen had previously surgically confirmed in 1948. He brought with him to the hospital a speech that he had prepared for a television show to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the State of Israel, but he did not finish it in time. Einstein refused the operation, saying: \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I've done my part; it's time to go. I'll do it elegantly.\"\n\nREAD| Charles Darwin: Theory of Evolution and Natural Selection"
