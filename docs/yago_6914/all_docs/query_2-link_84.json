Look deep into nature and you will understand everything... What a powerful quote coming from Albert Einstein. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955) was born in Germany to parents Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. He taught himself algebra, geometry and calculus. In other words, he was a mathematical genius. Ei...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: REST AND BE THANKFUL\n\nSeptember 03, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS Rest and be thankful…What a simple, but very meaningful quote. It says so much with so few words. With today being Labor Day here in the United States and Canada, it says exactly what we should be doing today: resting. It is a day to be thankful for both the work we have and gives us a day to relax; a day to rejuvenate and be grateful. ABOUT THE AUTHOR William Wordsworth’s (A...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: A GARDEN IS A GRAND TEACHER\n\nAugust 27, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust… Flowers and Gardens have taught me many things: patience, understanding, vulnerability and strength, to name a few. They are the teacher I would have never imagined during my school years, but one that has had a profound effect on me. ABOU...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: WE CAN COMPLAIN\n\nAugust 20, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS We can complain because rose bushes have thorns, or rejoice because thorn bushes have roses…To me, this quote is about reframing: taking something that is negative, thorns, and stepping back to find the more positive, roses. The first part of reframing is separating it from something that is “gravity”. Gravity is something that can’t be changed and reframing is changing somet...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: TRY TO BE A RAINBOW\n\nAugust 13, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud… I find sharing an unexpected flower can brighten up anyone's day. Share with me below, how do you like to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud? I can always use some great ideas on how to be that rainbow. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Maya Angelou (April 4, 1928 – May 28, 2014) was an American poet, civil rights activist, singer, writer and memoirist. ...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: FRIENDS ARE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN\n\nAugust 06, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS Friends are flowers in the garden of life... I am so blessed with many wonderful friends. They have created beautiful gardens for me to wander and spend my time in with them. As each flower teaches and awes me, my friends have also done the same. With that, I thank each and every one of you. How thankful am I for my friends and for flowers as they both have renewed me in times when ...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: SOME PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS\n\nJuly 30, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS Some people are always grumbling because roses have thorns; I am thankful that thorns have roses… I appreciate being reminded that it all comes down to how you see it or reframe it. You can see the rose and be distracted by and complain about the thorns, or you can see the thorns and rejoice in the rose. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Jean-Baptistie Alphonse Karr (November 24, 1808 – Septe...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: THE TRUE BEAUTY OF MUSIC\n\nJuly 23, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS The true beauty of music is that it connects people… Music has many wonderful attributes and can affect my mood in the most happy and delightful ways. It has created moments of connecting with my husband when I get hooked on a song. I’ll play it loud, and we’ll dance to it in my office or the living room. It also connects me to others, and there is one fun and surprising connec...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: THE LESSON I HAVE LEARNT\n\nJuly 16, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS The lesson I have learnt, and wish to pass on to others, is to know the enduring happiness that the love of a garden gives… The happiness that gardens do bring. They share their beauty and many lessons of life with us on a daily basis. There isn’t a day that I don’t love looking out at my garden and experiencing all of the happiness it brings to me. Working in my garden brings ...\n\nRead More\n\nFLOWER QUOTE: BE KIND, FOR EVERYONE YOU MEET\n\nJuly 09, 2018\n\nMY TWO CENTS Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle… I have heard this quote or something very close to it a handful of times, and it really strikes a cord. It’s so easy to be in my own space, and to not take the time to be aware that everyone I intersect with has their own battle they are dealing with. Life is a challenge for each of us, and I will have to work on taking mo...\n\nRead More"
