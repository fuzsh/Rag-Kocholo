        "text": "Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, a team of physicists heard and recorded the sound of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light-years away, and in doing so opened a new era of astronomy.\n\nThursday's discovery helps validate a prediction Albert Einstein made a century ago.\n\nRevered for his scientific intellect, he laid the foundations for modern physics that earned him introductions with some of the most exclusive people on Earth.\n\nHis opinions on race, politics, and war were also incredibly progressive for their time. Some even say that we will never see the likes of another Einstein again.\n\nHere's how a man, who \"had no understanding of how to relate to people,\" became history's most beloved scientist.\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879, to Pauline Koch and Hermann Einstein.\n\nUploaded by Materialscientist on Wikipedia\n\nAlbert Einstein was the oldest of two children — his younger sister, Maria Einstein, was born about two years later in November 1881.\n\nEinstein reportedly was slow in learning how to talk. That, combined with his tendency to whisper words softly to himself before saying them aloud led the family maid to nick name him \"der Depperte\" — \"the dopey one.\"\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nEinstein's parents were concerned about his intelligence because he was slow to learn to speak.\n\nScreen grab\n\nOne year after Einstein was born, his father, mother, and uncle moved to Munich — to establish an electrical-engineering company — where Einstein earned the bulk of his early education.\n\nThe secondary school he attended was eventually named after him and called the Albert Einstein Gymnasium before merging with another school in 2010.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nEinstein developed a passion for music in his early teens.\n\nUploaded by Quibik on Wikipedia\n\nEinstein began violin lessons at 5 but didn't enjoy music until 13, when he discovered Mozart's violin sonatas. After that, the young genius was hooked and would play the violin in string quartets later as a young adult and throughout his life.\n\n\"Mozart's music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself,\" Einstein later told a friend.\n\nSource: Charles Chaplain: My Autobiography\n\nHe wrote his first scientific paper as a teenager.\n\nUploaded by Materialscientist on Wikipedia\n\nOriginally, Einstein was destined to take over the family business, but when it failed in 1894, Einstein's family moved to northern Italy.\n\nIt was there that a teenage Einstein wrote what today is referred to as his first scientific paper, which investigated the nature of the ether — a hypothetical consequence of how light travels through space that Einstein later disproved. Before his death, Einstein published a total of more than 300 scientific papers.\n\nSource: The Golden Age of Theoretical Physics\n\nAt 21, Einstein earned his physics-teaching diploma.\n\nUploaded by Schutz on Wikipedia\n\nEinstein graduated with his teaching diploma from the Zürich Polytechnic in Switzerland in 1900. Though he showed exceptional skill in his theoretical-physics courses, he scored lower in his math courses.\n\n\"It was not clear to me as a student that a more profound knowledge of the basic principles of physics was tied up with the most intricate mathematical methods,\" an older, wiser Einstein later admitted, (emphasis added).\n\nSource: Encyclopedia\n\nChildhood family struggles ultimately led Einstein to be a socialist.\n\nHarris & Ewing Collection (Library of Congress)\n\nIn 1902, Einstein's father died, leaving him to care for his mother and sister, which was difficult because he was unemployed.\n\nMoreover, the family was in significant debt to Einstein's uncle. This financial strain, largely because of the failing business, is what ultimately led Einstein to favor the ideals of socialism over capitalism. In his later years, Einstein envisioned a single government to rule the globe.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia\n\nAt 23, Einstein had his first child — out of wedlock.\n\nUploaded by André Koehne on Wikipedia\n\nThe same year his father died, Einstein fathered an illegitimate child with Mileva Marić, whom he'd met while at the Zürich Polytechnic.\n\nMarić had been in the same physics-teaching program as Einstein, but never graduated. The two married in 1903, yet little is known about the fate of their first child — a daughter historians expect was either adopted or died of scarlet fever.\n\nIn 1904, the couple welcomed the first of their two sons, Hans Albert Einstein.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia\n\nDespite his brilliance, Einstein couldn't secure an academic job after graduation.\n\nUploaded by Quibik on Wikipedia\n\nEven with his physics-teaching diploma, Einstein could not find work in academia and was thwarted by his initial efforts to attain higher education — a doctoral degree — which would have helped him in job hunting.\n\nInstead, he took a position as a clerk at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property patent office in Bern, Germany, in 1903 — two years before he introduced his Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nAfter two years as a patent clerk, Einstein published four scientific papers in quick succession in the prestigious journal Annals of Physics.\n\nImage © The Albert Einstein Archives, The Jewish National & University Library, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel\n\nHere's an explanation — in his own words and taken from a letter he wrote to a friend — of some of the papers (emphasis added):\n\n\"The first deals with radiation and the energy properties of light and is very revolutionary.\" This describes his photoelectric effect, which laid the foundations for a completely new scientific field: quantum mechanics.\n\n\"The second paper is a determination of the true sizes of atoms.\" His second and third papers established Brownian motion, which helped prove the existence of atoms.\n\n\"The fourth paper is only a rough draft at this point, and ... employs a modification of the theory of space and time.\" This describes his Special Theory of Relativity, which stamped a speed limit on the universe: the speed of light.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nBut it wasn't until the end of 1905 that Einstein developed his most famous equation.\n\nOfficial US Navy photograph\n\nSubsequently, 1905 was dubbed Einstein's \"miracle year.\" Before it ended, he published a fifth paper, which included an addendum to his earlier one on the Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nThe addendum identified a novel relationship between energy and mass, which ultimately spawned the most famous equation in the world: E=mc2.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nFour years later, in 1909, Einstein was offered his first permanent academic position, which he initially turned down.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nEinstein accepted a temporary apprenticeship at the University of Bern in 1908. But after two teaching semesters, he canceled his lectures because attendance had waned to just one student.\n\nThe following year, in 1909, Einstein was offered his first permanent academic position as a full professor at the University of Zürich. But he declined the offer, at first, because the pay was lower than his salary at the patent office.\n\nIt was only after the university raised their offer that Einstein accepted. \"So, now I too am an official member of the guild of whores,\" Einstein wrote to a colleague, exclaiming the news.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nThe following year, Einstein welcomed another son — his last biological child.\n\nWikipedia\n\nIn 1910, Einstein and Marić had their second son, Eduard Einstein. By that point, despite Einstein's growing fame within the scientific community, the couple's relationship was getting rocky.\n\nIn 1912, Einstein began an affair with his cousin and childhood friend, Elsa Löwenthal, who would later become his second wife.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia\n\nIn the midst of impending global war and family conflict, Einstein did something incredible.\n\nCorvinZahn\n\nSomehow, despite his rocky relationship and the start of World War I, Einstein managed to develop one of the greatest contributions to science in the 20th century: his General Theory of Relativity, which he introduced in 1915.\n\nThis new theory, which allowed for a broader application of his Special Theory of Relativity, introduced the counterintuitive concept that space and time were not separate entities but a single element, which he called space-time.\n\nBut there was a problem.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nEinstein now had to prove that his theory worked.\n\nUploaded by Quibik on Wikipedia\n\nWhile Einstein's genius lay with his thought experiments that challenged conventional science, he struggled to think of a way to prove his General Theory of Relativity through experimentation and observation.\n\nIn 1917, Sir Frank Watson Dyson conceived of a way: Measure the apparent position of stars near the sun.\n\nBut this could only be done during a rare event called a total solar eclipse, when the sun's light is obstructed by the moon. Without an eclipse, the bright sun would otherwise drown out the light from the nearby stars, making them impossible to observe.\n\nSource: Wired\n\nIt wasn't until 1919 that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was put to the test, but not by Einstein.\n\nTime Travel Research Center\n\nIf Einstein was right, the stars near the sun at the time of the eclipse would appear in a slightly different location from normal because the sun's gravity would warp the space-time around it, bending the starlight's path, and therefore changing the apparent position of the star.\n\nSir Arthur Eddington performed the experiment during a total solar eclipse in 1919, proving Einstein right and making him an instant celebrity overnight.\n\nSource: Wired\n\nThough his family was aware of Einstein's fame, they did not understand why.\n\nBundesarchiv\n\nLater in life, Einstein's second son, Eduard, once asked why his father was so famous. Einstein replied (emphasis added):\n\nWhen a blind beetle crawls over the surface of a curved branch, it doesn't notice that the track it has covered is indeed curved. I was lucky enough to notice what the beetle didn't notice.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nThe same year Einstein became the world's most famous scientist, he and his first wife filed for divorce.\n\nUploaded by Kelson on Wikipedia\n\nBy that point, Einstein was fairly confident that he would eventually win the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nAnd to convince Marić to sign the divorce papers, which she was at first reluctant to do, Einstein offered her all of the money that came with the Nobel prize, if he were to win. Back then, the prize winnings were 37 times more than she earned in a year.\n\nShe accepted his offer.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nLess than four months after his divorce, Einstein married Elsa — the woman whom he'd been having an affair with for the last seven years.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nElsa had two daughters with a previous husband before she married Einstein. Though Einstein was content with their relationship as it was, Elsa pushed for the marriage because she felt her reputation was at risk.\n\nDespite his affairs with other women throughout their marriage, Elsa stayed with Einstein until she died in 1936 of heart and kidney problems.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nEinstein was first nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1910, but did not receive it until 11 years later.\n\nBundesarchiv\n\nSure enough, Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect,\" which transformed the way physicists understood the behavior of light and, ultimately, the nature of the universe.\n\nEinstein did not win for either of his relativity theories, as is the common misconception. All of his earnings went to Marić and their two sons.\n\nSource: NobelPrize.org\n\nEveryone wanted to know more about this genius who had now won the world's most prestigious scientific award.\n\nUploaded by Wikiwatcher1 on Wikipedia\n\nSo, in 1921 and 1922, Einstein gave lectures on his theories around the world, including Palestine, Japan, the US, France, and elsewhere. Everywhere he went, he was greeted with cheering crowds.\n\nWhile in Japan, Einstein was introduced to the emperor and empress of the time. He was no longer a struggling patent clerk but a world-famous scientist who's name had become synonymous with genius.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nShortly after winning the Nobel Prize, Einstein began his search for a unified field theory.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHe was mostly alone in the endeavor to discover a theory of everything because scientists were busy delving into quantum mechanics, a field Einstein had helped develop.\n\nBut Einstein did not like the incompleteness of quantum-mechanics theory and therefore searched for something grander that would tie the four leading physics fields — electricity, magnetism, quantum mechanics, and gravity — together.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nFor seven years, Einstein slaved over his search.\n\nGetty\n\nAnd this time, when Einstein was ready to introduce his unified theory, the entire world was watching. In 1929, he published his first crack at a theory of everything and was subsequently featured on the cover of Time magazine — the first of five appearances.\n\nBut the theory he introduced had holes that other scientists quickly found, indicating that it was not the theory for which Einstein endlessly sought to the end of his life.\n\nIt's said that on the last night of his life, Einstein jotted down a line of equations that were his last attempt at a grand theory that has continued to elude the greatest scientists of the last century.\n\nSources: Einstein: His Life and Universe, World Science Festival\n\nShortly after his unified theory publication in 1929, Einstein sought refuge from the public eye for his 50th birthday in a secluded spot in northeast Germany.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs a birthday present that year, the city of Berlin offered Einstein the rights to live in a country house by a lake near the capital.\n\nThough he never learned to swim, Einstein loved to sail and gladly accepted the gift. But he did not stay at the country house long.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nIn 1933, Einstein moved to the US when Nazi leader Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany.\n\nWikipedia\n\nIn April 1933, Germany's new government passed a law that prevented Jews from holding any official positions, including academic ones.\n\nFor the following few months, Einstein was unemployed. He eventually emigrated to the US in October 1933, where he took a position at Princeton University, but not before writing letters to countries asking that they take in unemployed German-Jewish scientists. His letters reportedly saved over 1,000 individuals.\n\nTwo years later, Einstein applied for US citizenship, eventually earning it in 1940.\n\nSource: Einstein: His Life and Universe\n\nBeing a victim of anti-Semitism, Einstein was an outspoken civil-rights advocate.\n\nUploaded by Materialscientist to Wikipedia\n\nAfter Einstein moved to New Jersey, he soon became aware of the separate schools and theaters for blacks and whites. These blatantly racist elements of American culture was what Einstein called the country's \"worst disease.\"\n\nTo counteract racism in America, Einstein openly befriended African Americans, such as actor Paul Robeson and opera star Marian Anderson, and publicly encouraged the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nBut there was another problem that Einstein was aware of by the late '30s: nuclear fission.\n\nSources: Einstein on Race and Racism, LiveScience\n\nOn August 2, 1939, a month before World War II started, Einstein wrote this two-page letter to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt that launched the US into a nuclear-arms race against the Nazis.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nEinstein warned Roosevelt that a massive nuclear chain reaction involving uranium could lead to the construction of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\" — the atomic bomb (emphasis added).\n\n\"A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory,\" Einstein wrote to Roosevelt (emphasis added). He later met with the president to discuss the prospect of a nuclear bomb in more detail.\n\nTwo years later, and after multiple letters from Einstein, the US created the \"Manhattan Project,\" America's plan to design and build the most devastating weapons ever produced up to that time.\n\nSource: PBS\n\nThough his letter sparked the Manhattan Project, Einstein considered war another form of \"disease\" and was against the use of atomic weapons.\n\nAP\n\nEinstein was denied clearance to work on the Manhattan Project by the US Army Intelligence office, which deemed him a potential security risk. And the scientists on the project were forbidden to speak with him.\n\nHe admitted later in life that he would have never signed that letter to Roosevelt if he knew the Germans would have failed in their attempts to build an atomic bomb.\n\n\"To kill in war time, it seems to me, is in no ways better than common murder,\" he once wrote (emphasis added).\n\nSources: American Museum of Natural History, Atomic Archive\n\nThroughout the 1940s and until his death in 1955, Einstein spoke out against racism and the use of nuclear weapons, but he also had his hobbies.\n\nScreen grab\n\nIn 1950, after accepting a life membership to the Montreal Pipe Smokers Club, Einstein said he believed — emphasis added — \"that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs.\"\n\nEinstein eventually gave up smoking at the request of his physician.\n\n\"He didn't give up on the pipes themselves and he would fairly often stick an empty one in his mouth and just chew on it,\" said Roger Sherman, the Smithsonian's associate curator for the modern-physics collection.\n\nSource: Smithsonian\n\nDespite his unconventional views, Einstein still had his fans — some powerful ones.\n\nWikipedia\n\nIn 1952, the first president of Israel, Chaim Weizmann, died, and Einstein was offered to take his place. By that point, Einstein was 73 and collaborating with leading physicists of the age on the behavior of black holes, wormholes, and more abstract concepts that astrophysicists continue to study to this day.\n\nEinstein politely declined the offer, saying in his refusal letter that he lacked the \"natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\"\n\nSource: World Science Festival\n\n\"I have done my share, it is time to go.\"\n\nPrinceton University\n\nOn April 17, 1955, Einstein suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm and was taken to the University Medical Center in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nHe refused treatment by saying — emphasis added — that \"It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" The next morning, at 76, Einstein died in his sleep.\n\nSource: \"Postcards from the Brain Museum,\" Biography.com, National Geographic\n\nBut the world wasn't quite satisfied.\n\nNational Museum of Health and Medicine via Men et al.\n\nAccording to Brian Burrell, author of \"Postcards from the Brain Museum,\" Einstein did not want his brain to be studied or worshiped.\n\n\"He [Einstein] had left behind specific instructions regarding his remains: cremate them, and scatter the ashes secretly in order to discourage idolaters,\" Burrell wrote.\n\nBut Thomas Harvey, a doctor on call at the hospital, took Einstein's brain without permission and carved it into 240 pieces in order to further study it.\n\nEinstein's brain is currently at the Princeton University Medical Center.\n\nSource: \"Postcards from the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds\"\n\nSee Also:"
