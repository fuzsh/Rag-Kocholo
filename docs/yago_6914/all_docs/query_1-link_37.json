        "text": "Albert Einstein's Father - Hermann Einstein\n\nBelonged to an old Jewish family,\n\nSettled for over hundred years,\n\nIn a small town of Buchau, south west of Ulm\n\nIn the state of Wuttemburg, in South Germany,\n\nAn exotic country of great scenic beauty,\n\nAfter Hermann and Pauline were married,\n\nHermann set up a modest business of\n\nElectrical and engineering service.\n\nHermann was hard working, though not rich,\n\nPauline helped him financially,\n\nTo get him started on this new venture.\n\nHermann was good natured, affable and fun loving,\n\nBut he had no skill or acumen for shrewd business,\n\nHe could neither market or improve his business.\n\nBefore long, his business failed\n\nAnd he was forced to close his shop.\n\nAlbert was just a year old then.\n\nYet, Hermann kept up his positive spirits.\n\nAlong with his brother Jacob, he moved to Munich,\n\nIn search of better prospects for his business ventures.\n\nHe was determined to look after his family with\n\nA decent earning and a comfortable life styl,\n\nAnd most importantly, good education for his children.\n\nIn Munich, Hermann rented a house and got back to work.\n\nLuckily, things improved and his business flourished.\n\nFor Albert, his father Hermann and his Uncle Jacob were\n\nBoth heroes, who gifted him with a compass and a book\n\nThat triggered a process of high thinking and investigation -\n\nA marvellous quest into the world of scientific truth.\n\nUnfortunately, Hermann did not live long enough\n\nTo see the success and glory of his beloved son's work.\n\nIn October 1902, at fifty-five years, Hermann passed away, in Milan,\n\nJust minutes after meeting and giving consent to Albert to marry Mileva.\n\nHow proud and happy, the father would have been to know that\n\nHis son, Albert Einstein, became the greatest scientist of the century!\n\nA Biographical Poem"
