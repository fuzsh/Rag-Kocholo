        "text": "Sea-bathing and music in Venice.\n\nEinstein sends greetings from a trip to Venice in the company of his father, enjoying 'sea-bathing ... and music in the most beautiful sunshine!'. Hermann Einstein's message reports their departure the next day for Verona and Isola della Scala, and their expected return to Milan on the Friday.\n\nEinstein mentions hisplanned trip to Venice with his father in a number of letters to his future wife, Mileva, in August 1900, depicting a rather more business-oriented expedition: his father had 'promised me in his last letter that he will visit Venice with me, because our power plants are not far from there'. In fact, his relations with his parents had been thrown into crisis by his announcement earlier in the summer that he intended to marry Mileva, and the trip with his father may have been intended to mend fences. Einstein had secured his diploma from Zurich Polytechnic in July: he was to submit his first scientific paper, on capillarity, to the Annalen der Physik in December.\n\nPost Lot Text\n\nTemporary Admission Regime\n\nThis lot has been imported from outside the EU for sale and placed under the Temporary Admission regime.\n\nImport VAT is payable at 5% on the hammer price.
