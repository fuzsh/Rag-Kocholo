        "text": "When a boy was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879, his head was so large and angular that his mother feared her child was de formed until she was reas sured by her doctor that it would grow normally. The baby was given the name Albert Einstein.\n\nAs recounted later by his sister, “When Grandmama, after some time, first saw him she clapped her hands over his head in astonish ment and cried: ‘Much too fat! Much too fat!’”\n\nThis account of the birth of the man who became one of the world's greatest scien tists forms part of a collec tion of thousands of private papers, letters, notebooks and scientific manuscripts that the Princeton University Press plans to publish under an agreement with the Einstein estate.\n\nWhile some of the letters have appeared in various col lections which are housed at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N. J., and a few scholars have had ac cess to the papers, the great bulk of the material has never been published.\n\nIt is evident from an exam ination of representative doc uments by this writer and interviews with those who have studied the whole col lection at length that the pa pers provide new insights into one of the great con ceptual revolutions of all time—the development of rel ativity theory.\n\nThey include a vivid ac count of Einstein's childhood, as well as material document ing some of the factors con tributing to the development of a genius. There are hun dreds of letters exchanged with world leaders in politics, science, music and philoso phy, as well as far more humble citizens. Some let ters are humorous and some poignant.\n\nThe documents spell out Einstein's role in scientific debates of the first half of this century and his contri bution to the founding of Is rael and they bear witness to his vehement dissent against World War I while a resident in Berlin, as well as his pacifist efforts in later years.\n\nAbove all, the papers tell of a child whose inability— or unwillingness—to speak until the age of 3 led him to develop an extraordinary capacity for nonverbal con ceptualization. In the view of Dr. Gerald Holton, profes sor of physics at Harvard University, who has worked with the papers for several years, such use of abstract concepts, rather than words, persisted into Ein stein's adult life.\n\nThis no doubt made it easier for Einstein to break free from the methods of thought that prevented his con temporaries from recognizing the lim itations of those concepts of space, time, light, mass and energy that are rooted in the limited capabilities of di rect human experience.\n\nOther scientists at the turn of the century, such as Hendrik A. Lorentz and Henri Poincaré, with roughly the same data in front of them, according to Dr. Holton, “simply could not make the jump, although their own work prepared the labors of Einstein and others.”\n\nWhy was Einstein able to make the jump, whereas others could not? The answer is one of importance to all who seek to break new ground in science— or to prepare others for doing so.\n\nThe controlling factors, as Dr. Holton has pointed out, include early training, family influences, personality, philo sophical outlook and placement among colleagues. Seeking such clues to Ein stein's development will, it is expected, keep generations of scholars busy, once the material has been published.\n\nUnpublished Manuscript\n\nProbably the most revealing docu ment concerning Einstein's early child hood is an unpublished manuscript by his sister, Dr. Maja Winteler‐Einstein. It was written in 1924 when, as she put it, she was the only person alive who had direct knowledge of his early years. Maja had been born two years after her brother, when the family had moved to Munich.\n\nWhy Maja's biography has never been published is uncertain, but may be re lated to Einstein's dislike of publicity. There is a tendency among scientists to look with scorn on those who pro mote themselves in the public eye, and he may therefore have discouraged his sister from publishing the account dur ing his lifetime.\n\nEinstein's father, Hermann, operated a small electrical and engineering plant while the family lived in Munich. It was a time when home use of electricity had begun its meteoric rise. However, like virtually all of Hermann's enter prises, this one was doomed to commer cial failure.\n\nEinstein's mother, Pauline Koch by birth, was an accomplished pianist and, according to his sister, was responsible for his taking up the violin.\n\nWhile young Albert grew up to be an adult of remarkable gentleness and sensitivity, as a small boy, his sister said, he displayed a quick temper, perhaps inherited from his maternal grandfather, Julius Koch. The Kochs, like the Einsteins, had long been resi dents of the Württemberg region of Germany.\n\nThe young Einstein, as described by his sister, turned yellow in the face when enraged — except for the tip of his nose, which turned white — and he lost control of himself.\n\nOnce, after he had begun home tutor ing and violin lessons at the age of 5. he became so furious at his teacher (for reasons that Maja did not explain) that he threw a chair at her. The teacher, according to the account, “re ceived such a fright that she fled in terror and never allowed herself to be seen again.”\n\nHurls Bowling Ball at Sister\n\nIn another childhood quarrel he threw a heavy bowling ball at his sister and once, she reported, he tried with a toy trowel to “knock a hole in her head.” From this, she added, “it is doubtless evident that a healthy skull is a necessity for the sister of thinker.”\n\nHowever, she added, his hot temper vanished when, at the age of 7, he started school. He did not thrive in the regimented educational system of nineteenth‐century Germany. The mul tiplication table, his sister reported, was taught by raps on the knuckles and this did not inspire young Einstein to become an arithmetic whiz.\n\nIn fact, she said, at this stage there was no sign of any special ability in mathematics. He had little facility at sums, even though he was careful and persevering. He found particularly diffi cult those problems that were “dressed up” in complex situations and often, when he reached the final calculation, he made mistakes.\n\nIt was not until his uncle, Jakob Ein stein, began challenging him with mathematical puzzles, she said, that he blossomed. Jakob Einstein, an en gineer, was adept at mathematics and, on one occasion, showed the boy the Pythagorean Theorem—that the sum of the squares on the two sides of a right triangle equals the square on the hypot enuse.\n\nEinstein then set about proving the theorem by a method of his own, quite different from the orthodox proof.\n\nAnother uncle, Cäsar Koch, a grain merchant, also played a role in stimu lating the development of the young Einstein. On his return from a trip to Russia, he presented the lad with a working model of a steam engine. Its chugging operation made such a deep impression on the boy that 30 years later, in writing a nostalgic letter to his Uncle Cäsar, he drew a remarkably pre cise diagram of the little engine.\n\nThis letter is one of the less technical items in the massive collection of the Einstein papers. Another is one of the two objects that, Einstein said in later years, played a special inspirational role in his life. This was a geometry book that sent his mind racing off in new directions as a boy.\n\nThe book, with his marginal scrib bles, is in the filing cabinets at Prince ton, but the other inspirational object —a compass given Einstein by his fa ther when he was 4 or 5—has vanished. The mysterious, all‐pervading “field” of magnetic force that controlled the compass needle fascinated the little boy.\n\nIt was a fascination that ultimately led him to challenge contemporary con cepts of magnetic fields and to develop an entirely new formulation of gravi tational fields. Dr. Holton, whose stud ies of the roots of relativity theory have been collected for publication by Harvard University Press this fall, be lieves Einstein's habit, from infancy, of thinking in concepts rather than words played a key role.\n\nHe cites a comment by Einstein to a friend when they were discussing the genesis of his ideas. “These thoughts,” he said, “did not come in any verbal formulation. I rarely think in words at all. A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterward.”\n\nElsewhere Einstein put it thus: “The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought.” He said that he formulated his ideas in “physical entities.... certain signs and more or less clear images which can be ‘voluntarily’ reproduced and combined.”\n\nThis, he continued, “seems to be the essential feature in productive thought —before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communi cated to others.”\n\nWould Repeat Words\n\n“The above‐mentioned elements are, in my case, of visual and some of muscular type,” he said. “Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously only in a secondary stage when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established and can be reproduced at will.”\n\nSuch laborious searching for words was anticipated in his early use of speech, as recounted by his sister. After each spoken sentence—“no matter how commonplace,” she said — the young Einstein would silently repeat the words with his lips, a practice that he finally gave up when he was 7.\n\nThis curious habit might have been a mark of his thoroughness and precision —characteristics also reflected in his construction of extraordinary playing card houses, some of them 14 stories high.\n\nFurthermore, his proclivity for com posing German limericks in later life showed that he was—at least after childhood—not seriously handicapped in the use of words.\n\nThe school in Munich where he did his early studies during the eighteen nineties was word‐oriented. The teach ing was largely by rote and, according to his sister, his room teacher reported that “nothing good” would ever come of the young Einstein.\n\nFurthermore, the school was run on very strict lines, in part, to prepare the youngsters for the military service that confronted them. Under German law, Einstein would have had to submit to such service — or be declared an evader—unless he emigrated before the end of his 16th year.\n\nHence, his sister said, he obtained a medical excuse from his doctor and left for Milan, where his father was em barked on another ill‐fated attempt to establish a solvent electrical plant. After spending about a year in Milan, the young Einstein sought admission to the Federal Institute of Technology, the Swiss counterpart of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—but he failed the entrance examination.\n\nTo prepare for a second attempt at entrance he went to the cantonal school in Aarau and found himself in a liberal teaching environment that allowed his capabilities to flourish. It was there, at the age of 16, that he performed a “thought experiment” symptomatic of his growing interest in the nature of light.\n\nIn 1864 James Clerk Maxwell in Eng land had proposed a series of equations to explain light waves in terms of rapidly moving, oscillating magnetic fields. In his “thought experiment” Einstein imagined himself to be riding through space, so to speak, astride a light wave and looking back at the wave next to him.\n\nWhat he should have seen, accord ing to the Maxwell formulation, was “a spatially oscillating electromagnetic field at rest,” he wrote later. Yet, he said, “there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience or according to Maxwell's equations.”\n\nStubborn and prolonged persuit of a single problem was typical of Ein stein, he noted himself, and it was 10 years later, at the age of 26, that he published his explanation of the para dox—embedded in the first of his rela tivity papers.\n\nOn his second attempt he was admit ted to the “Poly” in Zurich, but his stud ies there were clouded with dismay over his father's misfortunes. For the third time, despite advice to the contrary by the elder Einstein's “sensible but still young son” (as Maja put it) he had set up an electric plant, only to have it fail.\n\nDifficulties in Switzerland\n\n“What hits hardest, of course,” wrote the 19‐year‐old Einstein to his sister, “is the misfortune of my poor parents, who for so many years have not en joyed one minute of good fortune.\n\n“Furthermore it hurts me deeply that I, as a grownup man, must look on helplessly without being able to do the least thing. In fact I am nothing but a burden for my family. ... It would be a lot better if I were not alive at all.”\n\nAfter four years at the “Poly” he se cured a job at the Patent Office in Berne as technical specialist and moved to that city in 1902. A year later he married Mileva Marie, who bore him two sons.\n\nIt was while at the Patent Office that Einstein, in his spare time, generated a scientific revolution. His papers pub lished in a single year—1905, when he was 26—not only set forth the special theory of relativity but laid the founda tions of quantum theory as well.\n\nFame was slow in coming, however. The correspondence at Princeton tells of Einstein's efforts to obtain the equiv alent of a high school teaching post, which he thought would give him more time for his theoretical work. This was three years after the publication of his first paper on relativity. He pointed out modestly that he was “also” qualified to teach physics. He was turned down.\n\nAfter he had obtained a post as un paid lecturer — according to the aca demic custom of those times—at the University of Berne his sister came to visit him. At that time, she wrote, many poor, ill‐clothed—but often very intelli gent—Russian Jews were studying in Berne."
