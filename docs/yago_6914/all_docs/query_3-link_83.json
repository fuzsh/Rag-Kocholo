        "text": "Ben Hecht, one of Hollywood's and Broadway's greatest writers, won an Oscar for best original story for Unterwelt (1927) at the first Academy Awards in 1929 and had a hand in the writing of many classic films. He was nominated five more times for the best writing Oscar, winning (along with writing partner and friend Charles MacArthur, with whom he wrote the classic play \"The Front Page\") for Ein charmanter Schurke (1935) (the other nominations were for Schrei der Gehetzten (1934) in 1935, Stürmische Höhen (1939) (shared with MacArthur), Angels Over Broadway (1940) and Berüchtigt (1946), the latter two for best original screenplay). Hecht wrote fast and wrote well, and he was called upon by many producers as a highly paid script doctor. He was paid $10,000 by producer David O. Selznick for a fast doctoring of the Vom Winde verweht (1939) script, for which he received no credit and for which Sidney Howard won an Oscar, beating out Hecht and MacArthur's Stürmische Höhen (1939) script.\n\nBorn on February 28, 1894, Hecht made his name as a Chicago newspaperman during the heady days of cutthroat competition among newspapers and journalists. As a reporter for the Chicago Daily News, he wrote the column \"1001 Afternoons in Chicago\" and broke the \"Ragged Stranger Murder Case\" story, which led to the conviction and execution of Army war hero Carl Wanderer for the murder of his pregnant wife in 1921. The newspaper business, which he and MacArthur famously parodied in \"The Front Page\", was a good training ground for a screenwriter, as he had to write vivid prose and had to write quickly.\n\nWhile in New York in 1926 he received a telegram from friend Herman J. Mankiewicz, who had recently arrived in Hollywood. The telegram read: \"Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don't let this get around.\" Hecht moved to Hollywood, winding up at Paramount, working uncredited on the script for Lewis Milestone's adaptation of Ring Lardner's story The New Klondike (1926), starring silent superstar Thomas Meighan. However, it was his script for Josef von Sternberg's seminal gangster picture Unterwelt (1927) that got him noticed. From then until the 1960s, he was arguably the most famous, if not the highest paid, screenwriter of his time.\n\nAs a playwright, novelist and short-story writer, Hecht always denigrated writing for the movies, but it is for such films as Scarface (1932) and Denen ist nichts heilig (1937) as well The Front Page (1931), based on his play of the same name, for which he is best remembered.\n\nHe died on April 18, 1964, in New York City from thrombosis. He was 70 years old.\n\nA mining engineer's daughter, blond, blue-eyed Betty Compson began in show business playing the violin in a Salt Lake City vaudeville establishment for $15 a week. Following that, she went on tour, accompanied by her mother, with an act called 'The Vagabond Violinist'. Aged eighteen, she appeared on the Alexander Pantages Theatre Circuit, again doing her violin solo vaudeville routine, and was spotted there by comedy producer Al Christie. Christie quickly changed her stage name from Eleanor to Betty. For the next few years, she turned out a steady stream of one-reel and two-reel slapstick comedies, frequently paired with Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle.\n\nIn 1919, Betty was signed by writer-director George Loane Tucker to co-star opposite Lon Chaney as Rose in The Miracle Man (1919). The film was a huge critical and financial success and established Betty Compson as a major star at Paramount (under contract from 1921 to 1925). One of the more highly paid performers of the silent screen, her weekly earnings exceeded $5000 a week at the peak of her career. She came to own a fleet of luxury limousines and was able to move from a bungalow in the hills overlooking Hollywood to an expensive mansion on Hollywood Boulevard. From 1921, Betty also owned her own production company. She went on to make several films in England between 1923 and 1924 for the director Graham Cutts.\n\nDuring the late 1920's, Betty appeared in a variety of dramatic and comedic roles. She received good reviews acting opposite George Bancroft as a waterfront prostitute in Die Docks von New-York (1928), and was even nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of a carnival girl in Rummelplatz der Liebe (1928). She gave a touching performance in Der große Gabbo (1929), directed by her then husband James Cruze, as the assistant of a demented ventriloquist (Erich von Stroheim), with whom she is unhappily in love. That same year, she appeared in RKO's first sound film, Street Girl (1929), and was briefly under contract to that studio, cast in so-called 'women's pictures' such as The Lady Refuses (1931) and Three Who Loved (1931).\n\nThe stature of her roles began to diminish from the mid 1930s, though she continued to act in character parts until 1948.\n\nBetty's personal fortunes also declined. This came about primarily as a result of her marital contract to the alcoholic Cruze, whom she had divorced in 1929. For several years, Cruze had failed to pay his income tax and Betty (linked financially to Cruze) ended up being sued by the federal government to the tune of $150,000. This forced her to sell her Hollywood villa, her cars and her antiques.\n\nIn later years, Betty Compson developed her own cosmetics label and ran a business in California producing personalized ashtrays for the hospitality industry.\n\nDick Clark was born and raised in Mount Vernon, New York on November 30, 1929, to Julia Fuller (Barnard) and Richard Augustus Clark. He had one older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II. At the age of 16, Clark got his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. He worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer. After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business administration, Clark began working at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn's Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL's affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host.\n\nAfter acquiring nationwide distribution the newly reformatted program, now titled \"American Bandstand\", premiered on ABC on August 5, 1957. In addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and \"Rate-a-Record,\" allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, \"It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.\" Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men. But perhaps the most impactful change that Clark made to the show was ending \"American Bandstand's\" all-white policy, allowing African American artists to perform on the show.\n\nUnder Clark's influence, \"Bandstand\" became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on \"Bandstand\", which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock 'n' roll.\n\nWith the success of \"American Bandstand\", Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating \"payola\", the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of \"American Bandstand\", which was unaffected by the scandal.\n\nIn 1964, Clark moved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as \"Where the Action Is\", \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes\", and more recently, \"So You Think You Can Dance\", as well as made-for-television movies including \"Elvis\", \"The Birth of the Beatles\", \"Wild Streets\", and \"The Savage Seven\". Clark also hosted television's \"$10,000 Pyramid\", \"TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes\" (with co-host Ed McMahon), \"Scattergories\", and \"The Other Half\". Clark also had several radio programs, including \"The Dick Clark National Music Survey\", \"Countdown America\", and \"Rock, Roll & Remember\".\n\nIn 1972, he produced and hosted the very first edition of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\", a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired \"ABC 2000: Today\", a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings). In December 2004, Clark suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn't have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became \"New Year's Rockin' Eve's\" primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown.\n\nClark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, The Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame. Clark had been in St. John's hospital in Los Angeles after undergoing an outpatient procedure the night of April 17, 2012. Clark suffered a massive heart attack following the procedure. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died the next morning of April 18, 2012."
