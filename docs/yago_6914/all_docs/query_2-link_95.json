        "text": "Hermann and Pauline Einstein, parents of Albert Einstein\n\nJan. 1, 1900 – Berlin, Germany – HERMANN and PAULINE EINSTEIN ( born KOCH ) parents of the Jewish, German-born theoretical physicist ALBERT EINSTEIN. Einstein who’s widely regarded as the most important scientist of the 20th century and one of the greatest physicists of all time, produced much of his remarkable work during his stay at the Patent Office and in his spare time. He played a leading role in formulating the special and general theories of relativity; moreover, he made significant contributions to quantum theory and statistical mechanics. While best known for the Theory of Relativity (and specifically mass-energy equivalence, E=mc?), he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905 (his ‘wonderful year’ or ‘miraculous year’) and ‘for his services to Theoretical Physics.’ (Credit Image: Â© KEYSTONE Pictures USA)"
