        "text": "Ever since I was a student, I was fascinated by Albert Einstein, the great scientist who revolutionized our idea of space-time and gravity. He was a great inventor also and few months back, to educate myself, I wrote a short piece on Einstein’s Patents and Inventions. While doing my research for that piece, few lines on page 320, in “Subtle is the Lord..,” Abraham Pais’ well known scientific biography of Einstein, caught my attention. I have read the book earlier also, but then those lines did not make any impression on me. Here, I am reproducing those lines;\n\n“Letters (not in the Princeton Archives) written by Einstein in the early 1920s, showing that for several years he had a strong attachment to a younger woman, express emotions for which, perhaps, he had no energy to spare in his marraiges. This interlude ended in late 1924, when he wrote to her that he had to seek in the stars what was denied him on earth.”\n\nIn ‘Subtle is the Lord..’ Pais said, had he had to write a one-sentence biography of Einstein, he would write, ‘He (Einstein) was the freest man I have ever known’. However, the above lines clearly showed that the most freest man was not immune to feminine charm. One of his biographer Ronald Clarck wrote, ‘It is noticeable that Einstein was particularly happy in the company of women. The feeling were often mutual.” On further inquiry I learned that time and again, own his own volition, ‘the freest man’ got entangled himself to the opposite sex. At least on four occasion Einstein was seriously involved in love affairs, the latest was when he was more than forty years old. What was more shocking to me was that Einstein meted out rather shabby treatments to his lady loves. While his love affairs did not diminished my respect for him as a scientist; undoubtedly, he was the greatest scientist of the twentieth century, to me, the affairs and especially Einstein’s treatment of the affairs, certainly left a blemish on his charm. In the following, briefly, his love affairs will be discussed.\n\nFigure. From left, Marie Winteler, Maja Einstein, Paul Winteler, Anna Winteler, Jost Winteler, Pauline Winteler, Rosa Winteler. From Wikimedia commons.\n\nMarie Winteler:\n\nMarie Winteler was Einstein’s first love. In 1894 Einstein’s family moved to Milan, Italy, then to Pavia, leaving Einstein in Munich to finish his school. Einstein never liked his school. Now, without his family’s support school became unbearable to him. Without any planning for the future, he left school to join his family in Italy. He stayed with his family for about one and half years then tried to join ETH (Eidgenӧssische Technische Hochschule, The Federal Institute of Technology) in Zürich, but failed the entrance examination. Director of the institute was impressed with Einstein’s knowledge of science and mathematics. Following his suggestion, in October 1895, Einstein enrolled in Swiss Cantonal School at Aarau, to obtain the Matura; the high school diploma that would allow him to enroll directly at ETH.\n\nIn Aarau he boarded with Jost Winteler’s family. Jost Winteler was history and philology teacher at his school. It was not an unusual arrangement; at that time it was a common practice of teachers or professors to give boarding and lodging to students to augment their income. The same year Albert’s cousin Robert Koch also attended Aaarau and boarded with the Wintelers. Indeed, in Princeton University’s archive on Einstein, we find that on 29 October 1895, Einstein’s father Hermann wrote a letter to Jost Winteler, expressing his gratitude for providing homely atmosphere for his son Albert and asking for the terms of the boarding.\n\nJost Winteler had a friendly disposition. His family consisted of his wife Pauline and seven siblings. Einstein was charmed by the easy going Winteler family and soon became homely. He started to call Jost Winteler ‘Papa’ and his wife Pauline ‘Mama’. Also for the first time, he liked his school, atmosphere of which was distinctly different from gymnasiums at Germany. Einstein was charmed by the Winteler family. The Winteler family was also no less charmed by the young, handsome intelligent boy, who superbly played violin. Pauline Winteler started to indulge Einstein like his son. However, their youngest and prettiest daughter Marie was possibly was most charmed by Einstein. Marie Winteler was two years senior to Einstein and at that time was attending a course at Aarau teachers’ school. Completion of the course would have qualified her for a teacher’s job in elementary schools. Marie used to play piano and it was natural that she accompanied Einstein’s violin with her piano. By Christmas they were in love with each other.\n\nIn the mean time Einstein’s family also became very close to the Winteler family. They began to have regular correspondence. Einstein’s family was not averse to the relation between Albert and Marie. They liked the Wintelers, and would have loved to have some sort of betrothal relationship between the two families. As it turned out the relation between Marie and Albert fell through, but the close relation between two families continued. The betrothal relation between the two families did take place. Einstein sister Maja, following Einstein’s footsteps also studied at Aarau and boarded with the Wintelers. She fell in love with Marie’s brother Paul and married him. Einstein also introduced his close friend Michele Besso to the Winteler family and he fell in love with Marie’s sister Anna and married her.\n\nHow intense was Einstein-Marie’s love? On holidays and other occasions Einstein used to stay with his family at Pavia and those were the occasions for them to exchange letters. In his letters Einstein used to address Marie as “My Beloved Sweetheart.” On 21st April, 1896, he possibly received a letter from Marie. In his reply he wrote, “It is wonderful to be able to press to one’s heart such a bit of paper which two so dear little eyes have lovingly beheld and on which the dainty little hands have charmingly glided back and forth.” He informed her that his mother was quite taken by her, even though they had never met. He further wrote that his mother teased him that he was no longer attracted to the girls who in the past enchanted him. He wrote “You mean more to my soul than the whole world did before,” he went on, the “insignificant sweetheart that knows nothing and understands nothing.”\n\nMarie was also madly in love with his Albert. However, Marie she was also acutely aware of her limitations. She was a simple girl with no pretence of intellectualism. She knew her ‘Albert’ was intellectualy much superior to her. During that time Einstein was pondering over the ‘light problem,’ “what would one see if he can catch up with a beam of light?” He must have thought aloud of the problem he was pondering over and which make no sense to Marie. She was apprehensive of their future. She must have voiced her concern in her letter, because in his answer Einstein wrote, “Whether you should be afraid that…(I am not going to repeat it)?” He tried to ally her fears and writes, “If you were here at the moment, I would defy all reason and would give you a kiss for punishment and would have a good laugh at you as you deserve, sweet little angel! And as to whether I will be patient? What other choice do I have with my beloved, naughty little angel? The more so since the little angels are always weak (but indeed I am not going to say it again) & you are, after all, & should be, my little angel.”\n\nOn October 1896 Einstein left Aarau to enroll at ETH Zürich and took up residence there. Among his fellow students was Mileva Maric (or Marity). Contrast between Mileva Maric and Marie Winteler cannot be more than glaring. While Marie was a simple girl, rather unsure of herself, Mileva was superbly intelligent, poised and very sure of herself. Einstein can talk about physics with Mileva, which he could not do with Marie. He tried to extricate himself from Marie, his visits to Aarau became infrequent and so was his letters to Marie, and even when he wrote, he wrote rudely. The poor girl was at a loss, she didn’t understand what was happening, why his beloved Albert was cooling off, without any apparent reason. Einstein was around seventeen at that time. It is well known that boys at that stage are devoid of empathy and are in general cruel. Einstein set an example of this cruelty; even at that stage, he used to send his laundry to Marie to clean and send back to him. The poor girl had to walk one and half mile, some times in pouring rain, to the Post office to send the laundry back. We find a letter from Marie written on November 4. Einstein had sent her the basket of laundry without even attaching a short note. The letter is rather pathetic to read. Addressing Einstein as ‘Beloved sweetheart!’ the poor girl writes,\n\n“Your little basket arrived today and in vain did I strain my eyes looking for a little note, even though the mere sight of your dear hand writing in the address was enough to make me happy.”\n\nIn his earlier letter, Einstein must have wished to stop corresponds with her and poor girl was bewildered. She writes, “My love, I do not quite understand a passage in your letter. You write that you do not want to correspond with me any longer, but why not, sweetheart? …. I cannot grasp it at all and you must be quite annoyed with me if you can write so rudely.” She could not comprehend that Einstein was preparing to end the relation. She tries to make light of the situation and writes, “But wait you’ll get some proper scolding when I come home.”\n\nOn 30th November, on receiving Einstein’s letter she writes, “\n\nFinally finally I felt happy happy, something only your dear dear letters can bring about, and your little note made me also completely healthy again.” Uncertain about their relation she must have sought some reassurance from Einstein. It was not forthcoming. She tried to laugh away the issue, “That you do not want to give me an answer, just you wait, Albert, you’ll get quite a wicked punishment for it, I have still 12 days left in which to devise one.” She sent him a tea-pot and Einstein rudely replied that it was stupid. She replied, “you will get only what my heart can give to you, and nothing else, isn’t that so.“ His anger to her must have been reflected in his letter and she replied, “Now, be satisfied and stop making that angry face which looked at me from all the sides and corners of the writing paper.”\n\nTo a young man immersed in integral, differential calculus, Maxwell’s equations, Marie’s “How I sometimes yearn to stroke a little your dear tired brow… I would like to fly to my sweetheart and tell him how much do I love you..” must have been maddeningly frivolous and inconsequential. Einstein was determined to end the relation. He did not have courage to inform directly to Marie, rather choose to write to her mother announcing his decision. On May 1897, addressing Pauline Winteler as Mommy, he wrote,\n\n“I am writing you so soon in order to cut short an inner struggle whose outcome is, in fact, already firmly settled in my mind: I cannot come to visit you at Whitsuntide[1]. It would be more than unworthy of me to buy a few days of bliss at the cost of new pain, of which I have already caused much too much to the dear child through my fault. It fills me with a peculiar kind of satisfaction that now I myself have to taste some of the pain that I brought upon the dear girl through my thoughtlessness and ignorance of her delicate nature.“ From now on, he swears, he will mind his business and avoid romantic adventures. “Strenuous intellectual work and at God’s nature are the reconciling, yet relentlessly strict angels that shall lead me through all of life’s troubles.”\n\nWhat happened to Marie afterwards? Unconfirmed reports states that immediately afterwards, she suffered from depression. A few years later married the manager of a watch factory.\n\nEven though Einstein ended his relation with Marie, her memory haunted him throughout his life. In 1899, Einstein’s sister Maja went to Aarau to board with the Winteler family, and Einstein had to accompany her. Marie was then staying at Aarua. By that time Einstein was in love with Milvea. That he was uneasy at the prospect of facing Marie was evident from his letters to Mileva, “Don’t worry about my going to Aarau so often now that the critical daughter with whom I was so madly in love four years ago is coming back home. For the most part, I feel quite secure in my high fortress of calm. But I know that if I saw her a few more times, I would certainly go mad. Of that I am certain, and I fear it like fire.” That he treated her rather shabbily possibly gave a guilt complex and once he admitted to his close friend Besso that their affair remained a dark stain on his life.\n\nCan we give any justification for Einstein’s action? As I told before, Einstein was young then. The kindly, gentle, saintly person insulated from the rest of the world, the picture of Einstein that we generally tend to form, are formed from his later time images. They no way resemble the young Einstein, who from those who knew him, was rather an impudent and insolent boy, ready to mock you at the slightest pretext. Added to it that young are generally cruel, it is not surprising that at as soon as charm of young Marie was lost to Einstein, he abandoned her. However, there may be a deeper reason. At ETH Einstein found his true vocation, exploration and understanding the natural world. And possibly correctly understood that Marie, the simple, gay and frivolous girl will be a hindrance to his true vocation. Marie was simply not intelligent enough to understand his thought process. Mileva on the other hand was intelligent, with same interest as of his and possibly, she can help him in his exploration and understanding the natural world. And he abandoned Marie Winteler to embrace Mileva. As it turned out, Einstein was wrong and quickly became disillusioned. But that part will be dealt in later."
