        "text": "The late nineteenth century was a time when homes were heated with wood or coal, transportation was on horseback or carriage, and electricity had barely moved out of the laboratory into everyday use. It was into this world, which differed little from his ancestors’, that Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, a city in the south of Germany about seventy-five miles from Munich, on March 14, 1879. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and business man, and Pauline Koch. A year after his birth, the Einstein family moved to Munich as his father started an electrical equipment company. While the Einsteins were of Jewish ancestry, they were not observant of the faith and did not bring up their children in the Jewish traditions.\n\nOn Sunday afternoons, Hermann would take the family for outings in the country and often take some of Albert’s cousins along. One cousin who frequented these family adventures was Elsa Lowenthal, who would eventually become Albert’s second wife.\n\nOne of Albert’s earliest memories from his childhood was the time when his father gave him a magnetic compass. The young Einstein was fascinated by the movement of the needle as if it were magic, sparking a fascination in the physical world that would last a lifetime.\n\nEinstein attended a Catholic elementary school until the age of eight. Then he went to the Luitpold Gymnasium, a leading school in Munich. Young Albert Einstein’s prowess in mathematics and physics was evident from a very early age. He was only 12 when he created an original proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and at the same age he proclaimed that mathematics could help him explain nature.\n\nBy 1894, Einstein’s father was not having much success with his company. He lost a contract to supply electrical lighting to the city of Munich, as his company did not have enough money to convert their direct-current equipment to the now-standard alternating-current. The factory was sold, and the company folded. The Einsteins moved to Italy with hopes of finding better business opportunities. They spent some time in Milan before settling in Pavia. Albert was 15 at this time and had not completed the education that would prepare him to enter the university; as a result, he stayed behind in Luitpold to continue his education. His father had great expectations for his son, hoping Albert would become an electrical engineer."
