        "text": "BIOGRAPHY: early life, family and education\n\nAlbert Einstein was born on the 14th of March of 1879 on Germany, and he died on the 18th of April of 1955 on New Jersey. He was one of the most important and famous physicist of the 20th century. Besides being German, he also had the American and Swiss nationality.\n\nHe moved to Munich in 1880 with his family and later, round to 1890 to Italy after his business lost out on a major contract.\n\nHis father Hermann Einstein who was a german electrical engineer and businessman, got married with Pauline Koch on the 8th of August of 1876, which they had two children, Albert Einstein (the oldest) and Maja Einstein. Einstein’s parents were both Jewish. In 1903 he married Mileva Maric and had 3 children, Hans Albert Einstein, Eduard Einstein and Lieserl Einstein which she died at the age of 1. In 1919 he got divorced from Mileva and married Elsa Einstein. Albert died at the University Medical Centre at Princeton in the morning at the age of 76. The day before, he suffered an abdominal aortic aneurysm while working on a speech to honor Israel’s seventh anniversary. In the hospital he refused surgery and told them; “I want to go when I want, it is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.”"
