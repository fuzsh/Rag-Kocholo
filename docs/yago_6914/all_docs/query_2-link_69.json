        "text": "Family\n\nAlbert Einstein grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and engineer who, with his brother, founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that manufactured electrical equipment. Albert's mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, born two years after him.\n\nEinstein's Wives and Children\n\nAlbert Einstein married Milena Maric on Jan. 6, 1903. While attending school in Zurich, Einstein met Maric, a Serbian physics student. Einstein continued to grow closer to Maric, but his parents were strongly against the relationship due to her ethnic background. Nonetheless, Einstein continued to see her, with the two developing a correspondence via letters in which he expressed many of his scientific ideas. Einstein's father passed away in 1902, and the couple married thereafter.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEinstein was a member of the NAACP, drawing correlations between blacks in America and Jews in Germany. He believed racism was a disease."
