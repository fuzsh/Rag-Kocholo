Einstein’s great-great-great-great-grandfather, Jakob Weil, is his oldest recorded relative, born around the turn of the 18th century, and the family continues to this day. Albert Einstein’s great-great-grandfather, Löb Moses Sontheimer (1745–1831), was also the grandfather of the prominent tenor Heinrich Sontheim (1820–1912) of Stuttgart.[1]\n\nAlbert’s three children were from his relationship with his first wife, Mileva Marić, his daughter Lieserl being born a year before they married.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s second wife was Elsa Einstein, whose mother Fanny Koch was the sister of Albert’s mother, and whose father Rudolf Einstein was the son of Raphael Einstein, a brother of Albert’s paternal grandfather. Thus Albert and Elsa were first cousins through their mothers and second cousins through their fathers.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Einstein Family table\n\n2 Pauline Koch (Albert’s mother)\n\n2.1 Early life\n\n2.2 Business problems\n\n2.3 After Hermann\n\n2.4 Death\n\n3 Hermann Einstein (Albert’s father)\n\n3.1 Early life\n\n3.2 Marriage to Pauline\n\n3.3 Work\n\n3.4 Death\n\n4 Maria “Maja” Einstein (Albert’s sister)\n\n5 Lieserl Einstein (Albert’s daughter)\n\n6 Abraham Einstein (Albert’s grandfather)\n\n7 Ancestors and Relatives\n\n7.1 Einsteins and Ainsteins\n\n7.2 Daniel’s children\n\n7.3 Leopold’s children\n\n7.4 Abraham’s children\n\n7.5 David’s children\n\n8 Further reading\n\n9 References\n\n10 External links\n\n11 Notes\n\nEinstein Family table\n\nGeneration Paternal Maternal Comment chinken First (known) generation Jakob Weil from Wallerstein (?)

She was born in Cannstatt, Württemberg.[3] She was Jewish and had an older sister, Fanny, and two older brothers, Jacob and Caesar. Her parents were Julius Doerzbacher, who had accepted the family name Koch in 1842, and Jette Bernheimer. They had married in 1847. Pauline’s father was from Jebenhausen, now part of the city of Göppingen, and came from simple circumstances. Later he lived in Cannstatt and together with his brother Heinrich succeeded in making a considerable fortune in the corn trade. They even became “Royal Württemberg Purveyor to the Court”. Their mother was from Cannstatt and was a quiet and caring person.\n\nEarly life\n\nAt 18 years old, Pauline married the merchant Hermann Einstein who lived in Ulm. They got married in Cannstatt on August 8, 1876. After the marriage the young couple lived in Ulm, where Hermann became joint partner in a bed feathers company. Their son Albert was born on March 14, 1879. On the initiative of Hermann’s brother Jakob the family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880, where the two brothers together founded an electrical engineering company called [4] Einstein & Cie. The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called Maja), was born in Munich on November 18, 1881. Pauline Einstein was a very well educated and quiet woman who had an inclination towards the arts. When her duties in the household allowed it she was an assiduous and good piano player. She made Albert begin with violin lessons at the age of five.[5]\n\nBusiness problems\n\nThe factory of Hermann and Jakob was moved to Pavia, Italy in 1894. Hermann, Maria and Pauline moved to Milan in the same year and one year later moved to Pavia. Albert stayed with relatives in Munich to continue his education there. The separation from her son was certainly difficult for Pauline. Due to poor business, the brothers had to abandon their factory in 1896. Though Hermann had lost most of their money, he founded (without his brother) another electrical engineering company in Milan. This time business was better. However, Hermann’s health had gone downhill, and he died of heart failure in Milan on October 10, 1902.\n\nAfter Hermann\n\nIn 1903 Pauline went to live with her sister Fanny and her husband Rudolf Einstein, a first cousin of Hermann, in Hechingen, Württemberg. Fanny’s daughter Elsa was to become the second wife of Albert in 1919. In 1910 Pauline moved with her sister Fanny and her family to Berlin. She took on a job as housekeeper in Heilbronn, Württemberg in 1911. She lived with her brother Jacob Koch and his family in Zurich after 1914.\n\nDeath\n\nDuring World War I, Pauline fell ill with cancer. In 1918, when visiting her daughter Maria and son-in-law Paul Winteler in Luzern, Pauline was taken to the sanatorium Rosenau, due to her illness. At the end of 1919, Albert took his terminally-ill mother out of the sanatorium in Luzern and brought her to Haberlandstrasse 5, Berlin to stay with him and his second wife Elsa, where she later died.\n\nHermann Einstein (Albert’s father)\n\nHermann Einstein\n\nHermann Einstein Born August 30, 1847\n\nBuchau, Kingdom of Württemberg Died October 10, 1902 (aged 55)\n\nMilan, Kingdom of Italy Ethnicity Jewish Citizenship Germany (1847-1894)\n\nItaly (1894-1902) Occupation Scientific utility salesman, Electrician Spouse(s) Pauline Koch Children Albert Einstein and Maja Einstein Parents Abraham Einstein and Helene Moos\n\nHermann Einstein (August 30, 1847 – October 10, 1902) was the father of Albert Einstein.\n\nEarly life\n\nHermann Einstein (also known as Hermann Moos) was born in Buchau, Württemberg to Abraham Einstein and Helene Moos (July 3, 1814–Aug. 20, 1887).\n\nHe had six siblings:\n\nRaphael (Dec. 3, 1839-Jan. 15, 1842); male, Jette (Jan. 13, 1844-Jan. 7, 1905); female, Heinrich (Oct. 12, 1845-Nov. 16, 1877); male, August Ignaz (Dec. 23, 1849-Apr. 14, 1911); male, Jakob (Nov. 25, 1850–1912); male, Friederike “Rika” (Mar. 15, 1855-June 17, 1938); female.[6]\n\nAt the age of 14, Hermann attended the secondary school in the regional capital Stuttgart and was academically successful. He had a strong affection for mathematics, and would have liked to study in this or a related area, but as the financial situation of the family opposed further education, he decided to become a merchant and began an apprenticeship in Stuttgart.\n\nMarriage to Pauline\n\nMain article: Pauline Koch\n\nHermann married 18-year-old Pauline Koch in Cannstatt, Württemberg on August 8, 1876.[7] After their wedding, the young couple lived in Ulm, where Hermann became joint partner in the bed feathers shop of his cousins Moses and Hermann Levi. In Ulm, their son Albert was born on March 14, 1879. On the initiative of Hermann’s brother Jakob, the family moved to Munich in the summer of 1880. There the two brothers founded the electrical engineering company Einstein & Cie, with Hermann being the merchant and Jakob the technician. The second child of Hermann and Pauline, their daughter Maria (called Maja) was born in Munich on November 18, 1881.\n\nWork\n\nThe Einsteins’ electrical firm manufactured dynamos and electrical meters based on direct current. They were instrumental in bringing electricity to Munich, the capital of a very Catholic Bavaria. In 1885, they won the contract that provided DC lights to illuminate the Oktoberfest for the first time. To young, impressionable Albert, this must have been the source of great pride, for at this time Albert was the only Jew in his Catholic Petersschule class.\n\nTo their dismay, the Einstein brothers eventually lost a bidding war for the electrification contract of Munich to Siemens, which promoted the modern alternating current. Their fortunes took a decidedly downward turn from there.\n\nThe two brothers moved their company to Pavia, Italy in 1894. Hermann, Pauline and Maja moved to Milan in the same year and one year later moved to Pavia. Albert stayed with relatives in Munich to continue his education there. Due to poor business, Hermann and Jakob had to abandon their factory in 1896. Though Hermann had lost most of their money, he founded another electrical engineering company in Milan, this time without his brother. He was supported financially by his relatives in this venture. Though business was better this time, Hermann was preoccupied with “worries due to the vexatious money”. He moved back to Germany in 1902.\n\nDeath\n\nHermann Einstein died of heart failure in Milan,1902.

When little Albert saw his sister for the first time he thought she was a kind of toy and asked: “Yes, but where does it have its small wheels?”[9] Maja and Albert got along very well all their lives. She was Albert’s only friend during his childhood.\n\nShe attended elementary school in Munich from 1887 to 1894. She then moved with her parents to Milan, where she attended the German International School; Albert had stayed behind with relatives in Munich to complete his schooling. From 1899 to 1902, she attended a workshop for teachers in Aarau. After she passed her final exams she studied Romance languages and literature in Berlin, Bern and Paris. In 1909, she graduated from University of Bern, her dissertation was entitled “Contribution to the Tradition of the Chevalier au Cygne and the Enfances Godefroi”.\n\nIn the year following her graduation, she married Paul Winteler, but they were to be childless. The young couple moved to Luzern in 1911, where Maja’s husband had found a job. In 1922 they moved to Colonnata near Florence in Italy.[10]\n\nAfter Italian leader Benito Mussolini introduced anti-Semitic laws in Italy, Albert invited Maja to emigrate to the United States in 1939 and live in his residence in Mercer Street, Princeton, New Jersey. Her husband was denied entry into the United States on health grounds.[9] Maja spent some pleasant years with Albert, until she suffered a stroke in 1946, and became bedridden.[11] She later developed progressive arteriosclerosis, and died in Princeton on June 25, 1951 four years before her brother.[11]\n\nEinstein family\n\nLieserl Einstein (Albert’s daughter)\n\nLieserl Einstein Born January 1902\n\nNovi Sad, Vojvodina, Austria-Hungary (present day Republic of Serbia) Died 1903? Cause of death possibly scarlet fever Resting place unknown Residence Novi Sad (1902-19??) Parents Mileva Marić and Albert Einstein Relatives Marija Marić née Ružić, Miloš Marić, Pauline Einstein née Koch, Hermann Einstein, Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Einstein.\n\nLieserl Einstein (born January, 1902 – last mentioned in 1903; date of death unknown) was the first child of Mileva Marić and Albert Einstein.\n\nAccording to the correspondence between her parents, “Lieserl” was born in January, 1902, a year before her parents married, in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, present day Republic of Serbia, and was cared for by her mother for a short time while Einstein worked in Switzerland before Marić joined him there without the child.\n\n“Lieserl’s” existence was unknown to biographers until 1986, when a batch of letters between Albert and Mileva was discovered by Hans Albert Einstein‘s daughter Evelyn.\n\nMarić had hoped for a girl, while Einstein would have preferred a boy. In their letters, they called the unborn child “Lieserl”, when referring to a girl, or “Hanserl”, if a boy. Both “Lieserl” and “Hanserl” are diminutives of the common German names Liese and Hans.\n\nThe first reference to Marić’s pregnancy is found in a letter Einstein wrote to her from Winterthur, probably on May 28, 1901 (letter 36), asking twice about “the boy” and “our little son”,[12] whereas Marić’s first reference is found in her letter of November 13, 1901 (letter 43) from Stein am Rhein, in which she refers to the unborn child as “Lieserl”.[13] Einstein goes along with Marić’s wish for a daughter, and refers to the unborn child as “Lieserl” as well, but with a sense of humour as in letter 45 of December 12, 1901 “… and be happy about our Lieserl, whom I secretly (so Dollie [14] doesn’t notice) prefer to imagine a Hanserl.”[15]\n\nThe child must have been born shortly before February 4, 1902, when Einstein wrote: “… now you see that it really is a Lieserl, just as you’d wished. Is she healthy and does she cry properly? […] I love her so much and don’t even know her yet!”[16]\n\nThe last time “Lieserl” is mentioned in their extant correspondence is in Einstein’s letter of September 19, 1903 (letter 54), in which he shows concern for her suffering from scarlet fever. His asking “as what is the child registered? [Adding] we must take precautions that problems don’t arise for her later” may indicate the intention to give the child up for adoption.[17]\n\nAs neither the full name, nor the fate of the child are known so far several theories about her life and death have been put forward:\n\nMichele Zackheim, in her book on “Lieserl”, Einstein’s Daughter, states that “Lieserl” was mentally challenged at birth, and that she lived with her mother’s family and probably died of scarlet fever in September 1903.[18]\n\nAnother possibility, favoured by Robert Schulmann of the Einstein Papers Project, is that “Lieserl” was adopted by Marić’s close friend, Helene Savić, and was raised by her and lived under the name “Zorka Savić” until the 1990s. Savić did in fact raise a child by the name of Zorka, who was blind from childhood and died in the 1990s. Her grandson Milan Popović rejects the possibility that it was “Lieserl”, and also favors the theory that the child died in September 1903.[19]\n\nAbraham Einstein (Albert’s grandfather)\n\nAbraham Einstein (8 Apr 1808–21 Nov 1868), the son of Ruppert Einstein and Rebekha Overnauer, is the father of Hermann Einstein and grandfather of Hermann’s son, Albert. Abraham married Helene Moos, both German Jews, in April 1839 in Buchau. Together, they had several children:\n\nRaphael (3 Dec 1839–15 Jan 1842), male\n\nJette (13 Jan 1844–7 Jan 1905), female\n\nHeinrich (12 Oct 1845–16 Nov 1877), male\n\nHermann (30 Aug 1847–10 Oct 1902), male\n\nAugust Ignaz (23 Dec 1849–14 Apr 1911), male\n\nJakob (25 Nov 1850–1912), male\n\nFriederike “Rika” (15 Mar 1855–17 Jun 1938), female\n\nAncestors and Relatives\n\nEinsteins and Ainsteins\n\nAccording to Geni.com First known is Baruch E/Ainstein (b. 1665 in Wangen as son of Moses Ainstein, Germany, d. after 1689), got married two times with unknown women, from one marriage he had Moyses Probabla E/Ainstein (b. 1689, d. 1732). Moyses got married two times, second marriage was with Judith Hayman, Judith got 2 stepson from this marriage: David Einstein (b. 1713 in Buchau, Germany, d. 1763, but there is also chance he is son of unknown son of Judith and Moyses) and Abraham Einstein, Moyses also had daughter from first marriage. Judith had 2 biological sons: Daniel Einstein (b. 1690 in Fellheim, Germany, d. after 1720) and Leopold Einstein (b. 1700, d. after 1718).\n\nDaniel’s children\n\nDaniel had 4 wives, but despite this he had only one child, either a son or stepson called Leopold (b. 1720 in Ulm, Germany, d.
