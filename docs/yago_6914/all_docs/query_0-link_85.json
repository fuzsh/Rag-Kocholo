        "text": "Einstein was born in Ulm Germany in 1879 and when to ETH Zurich from 1897 to 1900, then to the University of Zurich in 1905. After school he married a women by the name of Mileva Marić from 1903 to 1919 then to Elsa Einstein from 1919 until 1936, Einstein had three children named Eduard Einstein, Lieserl Einstein, and Hans Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein helped the U.S. government during World War 2. Einstein was visiting the U.S. during the rise Adolf Hitler and Einstein being jewish did not return to Germany so in 1941 when the U.S. entered the war President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted Einstein help with a nuclear bomb so Einstein helped the United States government. Albert Died on the 18th of April 1955.\n\nAlbert Einstein once said, “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one had learned in school” (brainyquote.com). Albert Einstein was a scientist who strongly believed in the importance of education and knowledge and worked so that the entire world could know more about what’s around them. Albert Einstein is important in American history because of his many scientific discoveries and some of his efforts during World War 1.\n\nThe reason why his parents left Germany because Albert’s father was a businessman so his father had a business in Milan. So Albert stayed in Germany just to finish high school. But in school Einstein was only good in math and science but in the other subjects he was not good at. Then Albert quit high school in Germany and also lost his German citizenship and went to Switzerland to finish high school. After finishing high school Albert applied for a college called Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute. The first Einstein took the exam he failed. Einstein waited a year to take the exam again and this time he passed the exam. Albert later started to study math and science with some people that later became his friends. Einstein graduated out of college in 1900 but the two years that came were too difficult for Albert. He wanted to teach math and science in college but never found a job in a college. Lucky in 1902 Albert got a job in Swiss patent office. It was a place that where people could their ideas and the people that worked there to make the new\n\n“I have no special talent. Einstein should be #1 on the Time Magazine’s Top 100 Most Influential People of the Century because he helped form the basis of the development of the atomic bomb, won a number of awards, and he made many advances in science. Albert Einstein has been very influential in the world of science. He helped form a plan for the first atomic bomb which helped put an end to World War II. “...Einstein’s theories, including his equation E=mc2, helped form the basis of the development of the atomic bomb…”\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in the quiet town of Ulm, Germany, on March 14th, 1879. He was the son of two middle-class Jews, Hermann Einstein (his father) and Pauline Koch (his mother). In November of 1881, Albert’s younger sister, Maria (called “Maja”) was born. He had two experiences that greatly impacted his childhood: one at the age of five, when “Albert was ill in bed and to cheer him up, his father showed him a pocket compass . . . It was his first realization that a totally enclosed object could\n\nHave you ever heard the bowling ball and trampoline analogy, if you roll a bowling ball onto a trampoline it will roll into the middle. Then if you were to roll some billiard balls behind it they would curve in towards the bowling ball. Albert Einstein is important because of all the changes he has made to the world of science and the military, with the Theory of Relativity, the E=Mc2, and the atomic bomb. In 1915 Einstein had first proposed the Theory of Relativity, in 1905 is when the E=Mc2 equation was created, and on July 16, 1945 the atomic bomb had been invented. All of these things were factors in how Einstein changed the world.\n\nAlbert Einstein is one of the most influential scientist of the 20th century, and he helped propel advanced methods in science and education. When he first predicted the existence of gravitation there were many doubts and critics, but he worked and proved his methods to be successful and useful, to making discoveries in the world we are living in today. He had plenty of great accomplishments and discoveries, but in 1916 he completed some of his most important work that has had a major contribution, and he also created and completed many mathematical equations. Einstein has influenced many people not only because of his influence on science and mathematics, (but because growing it wasn’t easy, but still managed to recognize the importance of his future in the educational world and what it took to become the best at it.)\n\nFirstly, born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, Albert Einstein grew up in a normal Jewish family. Hermann Einstein, his father, was a salesman and engineer who with his brother created Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a Munich-based company that manufactured electrical equipment (http://einstein.biz/ 2017). His mother, Pauline Koch, ran the family household. Einstein had one sister, Maja, she was born two years after him. Einstein went to an elementary school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich However, he felt alone there and struggled with the harsh academic style. He also had\n\nAlbert Einstein is known as one of the greatest scientists of all time. He has propose many great theories like the Special Theory of Relativity, the Theory of General Relativity, and E=mc2. (Einstein is famous for these theories along with his help in developing the laser.) He also influences many other scientists in the study of quantum theory and the cosmos. Know one really will ever understand what went on in this man&amp;#8217;s mind but he was defiantly one of the greatest men of\n\nAlbert Einstein had a huge positive impact on history. He changed the confused minds of people and answered their questions. He dedicated his life to science and because of him our world has started to come together. Without him scientists would still be trying to figure out the speed of light, relativity, elements mass…. Etc. He educated the world and encouraged more people to learn about the natures of earth.\n\nOne of the smartest people ever to live, Albert Einstein, changed our society's development forever with his views, theories, and developments. Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. He was the only son of Hermann and Pauline Kech Einstein. He spent his youth in Munich, where his family owned a small electrical equipment plant. He did not talk until the age of three and by the age of nine, was still not fluent in his native language. (Discovering World History) His parents were actually concerned the he might be somewhat mentally retarded."
