        "text": "Albert Einstein was born in the city of Ulm in Wurttemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879 into a non-observant Jewish family. Six weeks later his parents moved the family to Munich, where Einstein spent most of his early years. In 1894, Einstein's family moved to Pavia, Italy (near Milan), but Einstein chose to remain behind in Munich. In 1901 Albert Einstein received his diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, as well as Swiss citizenship. In 1914, he returned to Germany as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute in Berlin, a position he held until 1933.\n\nAfter Hitler's rise to power, life for professional Jews in Germany became very uncomfortable. Albert Einstein and his wife, Elsa, moved to the United States and settled in Princeton, New Jersey.
