Albert Einstein's Father - Hermann Einstein

Belonged to an old Jewish family,

Settled for over hundred years,

In a small town of Buchau, south west of Ulm

In the state of Wuttemburg, in South Germany,

An exotic country of great scenic beauty,

After Hermann and Pauline were married,

Hermann set up a modest business of

Electrical and engineering service.

Hermann was hard working, though not rich,

Pauline helped him financially,

To get him started on this new venture.

Hermann was good natured, affable and fun loving,

But he had no skill or acumen for shrewd business,

He could neither market or improve his business.

Before long, his business failed

And he was forced to close his shop.

Albert was just a year old then.

Yet, Hermann kept up his positive spirits.

Along with his brother Jacob, he moved to Munich,

In search of better prospects for his business ventures.

He was determined to look after his family with

A decent earning and a comfortable life styl,

And most importantly, good education for his children.

In Munich, Hermann rented a house and got back to work.

Luckily, things improved and his business flourished.

For Albert, his father Hermann and his Uncle Jacob were

Both heroes, who gifted him with a compass and a book

That triggered a process of high thinking and investigation -

A marvellous quest into the world of scientific truth.

Unfortunately, Hermann did not live long enough

To see the success and glory of his beloved son's work.

In October 1902, at fifty-five years, Hermann passed away, in Milan,

Just minutes after meeting and giving consent to Albert to marry Mileva.

How proud and happy, the father would have been to know that

His son, Albert Einstein, became the greatest scientist of the century!
