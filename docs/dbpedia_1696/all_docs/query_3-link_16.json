        "meta_description": "Guardians of the Light Michele Rosewoman and Quintessence (#4) by Michele Rosewoman, released 22 September 2020\n\n1. The Thrill of Real Love\n2. Weird Nightmare\n3. West Africa Blue\n4. Where It Comes From\n5. Free To Be\n6. Fuzz Junk\n7. Ask Me now\n8. Akomado (for Babaluaye)\n9. Vamp for Ochun\n\n&quot;Brilliant writing and fluid ensemble playing abound.&quot; KEYBOARD\r\n\r\n&quot;On her latest…(Rosewoman) sounds more than ever the confident master of her committed course. An indomitable modern jazz pianist, her singular sound ideas expand readily to her dark, fiery ensembles. \r\nSo it all comes together,,big, tight and flexible, rangy, spontaneous, serious and mysterious. Rosewoman and her band are jazz believers, jazz devotees, keepers of the flame.”NPR JAZZ CD REVIEW\r\n\r\n&quot;No other pianist-composer in jazz brings the music of the African diaspora together quite like Michele Rosewoman. One of the most compelling inside-out pianists in jazz, Rosewoman combines a myriad of influences, including Herbie Hancock, Cecil Taylor, and Thelonious Monk (her solo version of Monk&#39;s &quot;Ask Me Now&quot; is one of the album&#39;s highlights). &quot;Guardians of the Light&quot; shows that in her playing and writing, Rosewoman is way past collecting influences. Simply put, she&#39;s one of the most creative and fully realized jazz artists on the scene today.&quot; CD NOW\r\n\r\n&quot;Aside from her sinewy, rippling piano work, Rosewoman&#39;s greatest strength is her ability to encompass so much of jazz&#39;s tradition without sounding like she&#39;s merely copping a style or paying tribute to a master in lieu of having anything original to say. .. Her quintet burns with the intensity of one of Woody Shaw&#39;s great hard bop units, yet it can also step lightly through the dance rhythms...and turn up the funk...For the uninitiated this is a well-balanced introduction to a musician whose spirit is infectious.&quot; DOWNBEAT\r\n\r\n&quot;Pianist Michele Rosewoman stands right at the cutting edge of 21st century music, cementing her reputation for adventurous jazz here, with music that&#39;s tough and cool, cohesive and slick and always refreshing and reinventing itself.&quot;\tTORONTO STAR",
