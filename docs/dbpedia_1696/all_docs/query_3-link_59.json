        "text": "Jumps:\n\nSTFU and take me right to the damn list already: #50 – #36 | #35 – #21 | #20 – #1\n\nWhat else do you have besides the Top 50? Show me this year’s superlatives.\n\nI don’t wanna sit through any of that, just let me view the YouTube and Spotify playlists.\n\nWelcome to the 5th annual MPH Top 50: The Year’s Music Best-Of’s, our published-one-a-year blog highlighting our (very subjective) picks for the 50 best indie and alternative tracks of the last 12 months. Has it really been five years of December’s End, half-a-decade of dissecting the year’s best? It’s quite a collection, the 260 amazing songs we’ve spotlighted. Although published only annually, we spend most of the year thinking about what will make the list. Every new song we hear – on the radio, sent to us by a friend, live from some unknown opening act – stays in the back of our minds, mentally ranking it among the year’s music, vying for a spot in our countdown (that’s no joke… this year’s list contains a song released on New Years Day and two just in December alone). In those five years, we’ve talked to many of our honorees about their spots on the list, and we’re always humbled when they remember our selections.\n\nWe’ve scoured the world for the best indie tracks from 2016, with artists representing all corners of the US, as well as New Zealand, England, Wales, Australia, Sweden, France, and South Africa. But we’ve never been shy about the amazing music coming from the Great White Indie North, and this year’s list is no exception with over a dozen spots occupied by Canadian artists. Ohhhhhhhhhhhh Canada.\n\nWe’re excited to have a brand new artist to our Top 50 topping this year’s list, joining our previous chart-toppers Rah Rah, Arkells, July Talk, and Hannah Georgas. But first, let’s start at the bottom, where we find a trio of bands from the good ol’ US, representing New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Portland.\n\nNumbers 50 – 36:\n\n# 50 | Light Up | Mutemath | 🇺🇸\n\nFor a band that’s been around for 15 years, Mutemath – sorry, MUTEMATH – maintains a very young and new sound, and this single finds a comfortable place in the indie pop catalogue of 2016, with an electronica Death Cab / M83 sound sprinkled with good late ’70s R&B. Frontman Paul Meany wrote this track about his relationship with his wife of 17 years, a “reality check for the work that goes into turning the initial spark of attraction into a lasting love”. That sounds like a recipe for band success as well.\n\nFun Fact: Mutemath’s original name was just Math, which oddly was also our worst subject in school.\n\n# 49 | True Confessions | Blondfire | 🇺🇸\n\nIf Garbage were starting out their career right now, this is what Shirley Manson and company would sound like… just with a little less California. Quietly releasing an EP of new material in March, Blondfire’s Driscoll siblings take a very familiar sound and find a new way to pull it off, recalling that great era of ’90s female synthpop from acts like Republica and Elastica. Placing their 6th song on our countdown in the last 5 years, Blondfire seem finally poised for a big breakout with their radio-friendly dreamy west coast beach sound.\n\nFun Fact: Bruce Driscoll – half of the sibling-led band – has a side project called Freedom Fry with French singer Marie Seyrat.\n\n# 48 | White Flag | Joseph | 🇺🇸\n\nThis year’s Haim, the band Joseph consists of three sisters from Portland: Natalie, Allison, and Meegan Closner. Sibling bands always find love on our countdown (see Tegan & Sara, Rah Rah, K’s Choice, Kongos, Broods, Mother Mother, the aforementioned Blondfire) probably because sibling bands produce a unique, easy sound borne of years of sibling bonding that most bands struggle to build throughout long careers. Joseph is no exception. Having a quietly big year, ‘White Flag’ premiered on NPR’s Songs We Love, hit #1 on the Adult Alternative chart, and grabbed a spot on Spotify’s Viral Top Ten. A song about “facing what scares you”, this acoustic NPR-ready romp worms its way up through its rousing singalong and go-do-something inspirational chorus, right out of the Dixie Chicks / Indigo Girls songbook.\n\nFun Fact: The sisters in-laws in Brooklyn have a cat named Dingus.\n\n# 47 | Genghis Khan | Miike Snow | 🇸🇪 🇺🇸\n\nIf you don’t know by now, Miiiiiiiike Snow is not a person, but – like many modern indie acts such as Chvrches – are a duo of DJ’s and a frontman/singer. This one consists of the Swedish producing pair of Bloodshy & Avant and New York based singer Andrew Wyatt. This track – their biggest of the year, comes off like a less-weird, less-complicated Gorillaz track, a rollicking mover about adolescent trust issues. I mean in 2016, why not have a light-hearted song about a genocidal megalomaniac?\n\nFun Fact: Bloodshy & Avant also produced Britney Spears’ “Toxic” and Katy Perry’s “Love Me”.\n\n# 46 | Sure and Certain | Jimmy Eat World | 🇺🇸\n\nD.E. Top 50 contributor Shannon DeVido – a self-described Jimmy Eat World obsessive fan – disagrees with us about this track. We think this sounds very different from previous JEW releases, whereas she believes the track surely and certainly sounds exactly like classic JEW. Whichever way you lean, there is no doubting that not only is this one of Jimmy Eat World’s catchiest songs since their heyday, and a wonderful return to form. A much-needed updating of that ’90s Modern Rock sound that seems perfectly at home on a Live, Collective Soul, Eve 6, or Silverchair disc from 1996, the Jimmies crafted one of the best pure indie pop choruses of the year.\n\nFun Fact: When the bandmates were kids, vocalist Jim Adkins’ brother drew a picture on guitarist Tom Linton’s younger brother Jimmy’s bedroom door, of Jimmy putting a globe in his mouth, and wrote “Jimmy Eat World”, bing bang boom, there’s your name.\n\n# 45 | Radio Kids | Strand of Oaks | 🇺🇸\n\nThe latest addition to the list, ‘Radio Kids’ by Philadelphia-based songwriter/producer Timothy Showalter a/k/a Strand of Oaks, was only just released on December first, a late addition to our list nominees. From the explosive opening notes, this track takes you by the collar and demands you follow. Breaking in head-first with chaotic machinegun guitar strumming (very similar to Wintersleep’s ‘Santa Fe’, which comes later), a full-on dive into punk chaos makes way for an ethereal riff line (a sound used to great effect by phellow Philly acts Kurt Vile and War On Drugs) punctuated by breathy, strained vocals, Showalter channels ‘Alex Chilton’-era Replacements to near perfection.\n\nFun Fact: In 2003, Showalter’s house burned down, so he lived in hotels and on park benches while working at an orthodox Jewish day school.\n\n# 44 | Can’t Say | Letters to Cleo | 🇺🇸\n\nFollowing last year’s outstanding return by ’90s darlings Veruca Salt, 2016 had unexpected and wonderful comebacks from two more ’90s female-fronted indie-jangle rock bands – Tanya Donelly’s Belly and Kay Hanley’s Letters To Cleo. While Belly only teased new music while out of their first tour in 21 years, LtC graced us with a full-blown EP (Back to Nebraska) and this wonderful single, their first in 17 years. Ben Wyatt would highly approve of this Letters to Cleo track that doesn’t sound different from anything else played on the rooftop of Stadium High School in 1999.\n\nFun Fact: Vocalist Kay Hanley has had quite a varied career, including providing vocals for songs in the 2001 film Josie and the Pussycats, as well as on the kids shows Generation O!, My Friends Tigger and Pooh, Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!, and Doc McStuffins, and on the title track to a Sonic the Hedgehog video game, as well as performing on a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade and singing back-up for Miley Cyrus on Hannah Montana tours.\n\n# 43 | Bad Decisions | Two Door Cinema Club | 🇮🇪\n\nIf there wasn’t evidence of the influence of ’70s R&B bands like Earth Wind and Fire (who are still making modern festival appearances) in today’s indie pop, just look up and down this list for entries from M83, Saint Motel, and Northern Ireland’s Two Door Cinema Club, and you’ll see it front-and-center. This moving and shaking dance track – complete with Bee Gees / Frankie Valli-esque falsetto vocals – builds on a smooth bass track and crafty song-smithing that updates a slick Sly Stone sound, infused with a bit of Prince, in the most wonderful way. Just don’t call it disco (even though, yes, it’s basically disco). But what is the song about? Frontman Alex Trimble says it’s about ‘weltschmertz‘, the German word for being at odds with the world around you.\n\nFun Fact: Kanye West once blogged about how much he liked Two Door Cinema Club, even posting the video for ‘I Can’t Talk’ on his website.\n\n# 42 | Gone | Jr Jr | 🇺🇸\n\nThe sound of 2016 indie rock lies in crafty new-folk from bands like The Strumbellas and X Ambassadors. The group formerly known as Dale Earnhardt Jr Jr lies not too far distant from that sound, just with a little more dance, pep, and groove to it, a bit akin to last year’s Top 50 darling Børns. Moving away from the more loose alternative sound of their past DEJJ incarnation, the newly-christened Jr Jr gifts us with this poppy boppy track, full of light and bounce. One of the most infectious tracks released this year, the synth riff whistling while it works forces involuntary grinning and handclapping. Even Dale Jr can’t keep his hands on the wheel.\n\nFun Fact: NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr is a fan of the band formerly named for him. Jr Jr emailed him a personal note to assure him weren’t making fun of him.\n\n# 41 | Fire Escape | Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness | 🇺🇸\n\nFor once, a new album did not come with it a new band name for Andrew McMahon. Throughout his incarnations as ‎Jack’s Mannequin, ‎Something Corporate, and as a solo artist, McMahon has maintained a rabid fan-base (much of it now-grown 2000’s teen girls looking for the voice that sang to and for them). But after his surprising and long-time-coming success of last year’s ‘Cecilia and the Satellite’, this year’s new CD Zombies on Broadway was highly-anticipated… and that anticipation paid off with an outstanding followup. As boppy and bouncy as Jr Jr’s ‘Gone’ but more anthemic, ‘Fire Escape’ takes that to the next level of musical maturity while maintaining a childlike wonder undercurrent, almost ready for a Sesame Street remake treatment or Pixar movie soundtrack placement. A notorious hard-worker and Aaron Sorkin-like perfectionist, there are few artists that other musicians universally root success for more than McMahon. More synth-heavy than previous releases, the influence that comes from moving his home base from California to New York comes through in this fully-formed pop triumph.\n\nFun Fact: Andrew McMahon survived two near-tragedies: Thanks to early detection, he successfully won a battle against leukemia. McMahon also survived having written several songs for the NBC series Smash.\n\n# 40 | PCH | Tokyo Police Club | 🇨🇦\n\nLet’s get this little tidbit out of the way first: To raise money for the Red Cross, TPC played this song live in front of an audience at Toronto’s Rally Gallery for 12 straight hours (that’s over 200 times in a row, folks), exchanging donations from fans for a chance to sing along with the band on stage. The first (but far from last) band from Canada on our countdown, TPC crafts a track that mixes their established loose college party indie sound (as heard in last year’s Top 50 entry ‘Hot Tonight’) with an influence of all those California bands that have indeed come of age along the Pacific Coast Highway itself, like Cayucas or Best Coast. TPC isn’t inventing anything new with ‘PCH’ or creating high art (as evidenced by their new album’s name, Melon Collie and the Infinite Radness (Part 1)), it’s just a lot of fun.\n\nFun Fact: On their first appearance on Late Show with David Letterman, the host introduced them as “Toyota Police Club”. As much as we’re sure Toyota appreciated that, fellow Canuck Paul Schaffer corrected Dave with the right name.\n\n# 39 | Stop Desire | Tegan and Sara | 🇨🇦\n\nOk ok ok ok we know there are already hundreds of thousands of words on the internet about the Quin sisters’ slow transition from indie folk darlings to full-on ’80s pop glam icons. But hear us out. Much like Dylan fans when Uncle Bobby went electric, indie fans of The Con-era T&S booed the change, shattered their vinyl LP’s, and burned their “Go steady with me” t-shirts when 2014’s Heartthrob came out. But the only issue with Heartthrob was that it wasn’t The Con or So Jealous. It was actually a wonderful piece of intelligent, well-written power-pop that still came with the bones of old indie T&S down at the core. But old-school Tegan & Sara fans would hear none of it. Now if Heartthrob was a transition disc, LY2D had no similar indie pedigree to speak of. It was pure Madonna, pure Cyndi Lauper. But it was also written by two strong, smart crafty songwriters. That hasn’t changed. It may have us taken seeing Tegan & Sara live supporting this album to really get it, but the songs are still good, still superiorily crafted. Yes, it’s pop, yes it’s full of ’80s Top 40 sounds and instrumentation (ugh enough with that Berlin synthesizer), but it’s still full of the deep and important songwriting and subject matter we’ve come to love from the twins, and it deserves your change to listen. Behind the shimmery-sheen production and bouncy ’80s synth, ‘Stop Desire’ is the gem of the album, a sweet pop swinger with catchy licks and strong vocals, and super-hooky chorus. We get it. We miss Living Room and Dark Come Soon and Where Does The Good Go too. But don’t let your FOP (fear of pop) keep you from giving the best pure pop album of the year a real try. We still love, you Quin Twins.\n\nFun Fact: Tegan and Sara appeared this summer on Larry King. Yes, that Larry King. And it was as uncomfortable as you think. Take a watch.\n\n# 38 | Good Grief | Bastille | 🇬🇧\n\nBastille’s Bad Blood album was so massive, and ‘Pompeii’ and the title track have remained such alternative radio staples, it’s hard to believe that it’s already a three year old disc. And for as giant as that CD was, it started to feel like Dan Smith and friends were in danger of fading, missing out on the coattails of that scorching debut (paging Mark Foster and his People) if they didn’t jump on Bad Blood‘s success with a quick sophomore followup. But Bastille Dan knew more than we did, proving with Wild World that taking his time to create a wondrous second effort was worth the wait. The first single ‘Good Grief’ doesn’t stray too far a foot from the sound of that debut, with just a few new wrinkles and a slightly sunnier beat than tracks featuring volcano-covered Italian cities and David Lynch shows as subject matter. The song incorporates a funked-up bassline and some light xylophone work with with some familiar words from Kelly LeBroc (which she actually sung with the band when they appeared on Ellen), a beautifully-harmonized chorus tease, and verses ripe with those uber-overpronounced British vocals. Telling the story of an old flame that’s still got her hooks in him, ‘Good Grief’ was certainly a harbinger of the hooks that Bastille still had in us, even three years after their debut.\n\nFun Fact: Bastille’s ‘Pompeii’ is the music on-hold if you ring up their label Virgin Records.\n\n# 37 | Got Your Number | Serena Ryder | 🇨🇦\n\nWhat a great, kickass track from Elle King. I’m sorry, hold please… I’m being told that this isn’t Elle King, but badass Toronto singer Serena Ryder. There are very few songwriters today out of the Liz Phair / Bonne Raitt school that can make a song move and shake down the track like Ryder can (see 2012’s MPH Top 50 for her rock anthem ‘Stompa’), and in the five years since her last outing – the underrated Harmony – it’s nice to see that her style and her penchant for rollicking hasn’t faded. ‘Got Your Number’ is freight train of indie blues that showcases Ryder’s smokey, raspy vocals on top of some top-notch acoustic blues rhythm guitar work. Maybe the new year will grace us with Ryder and Elle King on stage somewhere burning down the house together.\n\nFun Fact: In 2015, Ryder performed a live TV concert called ‘The Quietest Concert Ever on the Ocean Floor’, which had her standing on the ocean floor during low tide at the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick, Canada, home of the world’s largest and fastest tidal change. A helicopter airlifted in equipment as soon as the tide receded as audience members descended cliffs to reach the floor via 151-step staircase. As soon as Ryder played her last song, crews raced to get everything back off the floor before tide waters rushed back in.\n\n# 36 | Ophelia | Lumineers | 🇺🇸\n\nWe were never fans of The Lumineers. At times boring, at times pretentious. It’s as if in 2012, someone told a roomful of A&R guys “Hey, go find us the next Mumford & Sons” and grabbed Lumineers off the (dirty, dirty) street. But with their second album Cleopatra, a more mature, more understated Lumineers have emerged. With both the first two singles, the title track and ‘Ophelia’, that same Lumineers sound has been updated, tighter and crisper-produced but still rootsy and rustic, finally giving credence to those calling The Lumineers the new The Band (and not just because The Band also recorded a track called ‘Ophelia‘). They’re not quite there yet, but on this piano-driven, head-bopping slice of Americana, this Denver-based threesome and their studio friends are well on it’s way.\n\nFun Fact: Wesley Keith Schultz tells the story of the band’s name: “We were playing a club in Jersey City and there was a band called Lumineers slotted for the same time, same day, the next week. The person running the show that night mistakenly announced us as The Lumineers. The name stuck.”\n\nNumbers 35 – 21:\n\n# 35 | White Lights | Rural Alberta Advantage | 🇨🇦\n\nThere are few bands consisting of just an acoustic guitar, keyboards, and drums that elicit as much power, determination, and strength as Toronto’s The RAA. To see them live is to witness music in its purest form. The power of the trio comes differently from three directions, brand-spanking-new keyboardist Robin Hatch (ably replacing the sadly-departed Amy Cole), perpetual-motion-machine Paul Banwatt behind the drum kit, and guitarist / singer / songwriter Nils Edenloff, who embodies everything that bridges Canadian folk with indie rock. In 2014, The RAA grabbed our MPH Album of the Year with the subtle and soaring Mended with Gold. The new RAA album – of which this is the title track – won’t be released until well into 2017, and in fact, haven’t even released a proper single for it yet. ‘White Lights’ was soft-released in conjunction with a video compilation clip culled from their 8-date warm-up tour of the US to get some practice playing the new music live. We’re thankful they gave us the tease of this beautiful acoustic folk-rocker that bodes well for another stellar release in the coming year.\n\nFun Fact: Before forming The RAA, each of the three original members separately hosted open stage nights at a 120-year old Toronto club that closed within the year (they swear it wasn’t their fault). The club is now a Tim Horton’s.\n\n# 34 | Send My Love (To Your New Lover) | Adele | 🇬🇧\n\nYes, Adele. You read that correctly. We didn’t expect to see her here either. Adele is fine in her genre. She’s got an amazing voice, she’s a pop icon whose age you always know by her album title. But don’t forget, Adele Laurie Blue Adkins burst on to the (US) scene in 2010 with ‘Rolling In The Deep’, which for as bluesy and angry it was, wasn’t pop (despite the charts). That was alternative. And it was good. Frankly, most of what she’s recorded since, despite the incredible voice, was boring. And pop. Boring pop. Tell me ‘Hello’ isn’t boring af. But ‘Send My Love’ has indie written all over it. It could be recorded by Lorde or any of 2016’s chanteuses, like Bishop Briggs or K.Flay or Halsey. But Adele can sing better than any of those youngsters. The light electronic pulse ne acoustic octave riff through the verses pervades the entire track with a beat and feel that just envelops you into the song entirely, at home with any blues beat from Elle King or Amy Winehouse. And only sets the table for the swooping chorus, teased into invitingly and releasing masterfully with a vocal performance only Adele could pull off in one of the catchiest refrains recorded this year. It remains a mystery to us how this track did not cross over to alternative radio. The reason most likely is that it comes on a CD with the name ‘Adele’ plastered all over it.\n\nFun Fact: Adele claims she stopped reading books at the age of six. The last book she remembers reading was Roald Dahl’s Matilda.\n\n# 33 | Carry On | Cœur de pirate | 🇨🇦\n\nSpeaking of indie chanteuses, we would like to introduce you to one you probably have never heard of. Cœur de pirate is Béatrice Martin, a 27-year-old Francophone singer from Montréal. She’s been active for a decade, has five albums to her credit, two Juno nominations, and four Félix Awards. And she almost exclusively records in French. Which – as we mentioned – is why you probably haven’t heard of her. But not being from Québec, Martinique, or France, we were very fortunate that Martin, whose stage name translates to ‘Her Pirate Heart’, released this wonderful track ‘Carry On’ in both French and English. A beautiful indie electronic track with nasal, breathy vocals over an easy-flowing synth beat, had she been an English recording artist – again, in the 2016 of Bishop Briggs, K.Flay, and Halsey – there’s a good chance she would have had a massive US hit with this cut.\n\nFun Fact: In 2009, Martin received a CBC ‘Bucky’ Awards for “Best Reason to Learn French” and “Sexiest Artist”, for which we do not disagree.\n\n# 32 | Miracle | Darcys | 🇨🇦\n\nThank god for music friends. We would not have been introduced to this art rock duo from Ontario if not for recommendations of friends north of the border. The Darcys have been kicking around for half a decade, running in circles with bands like July Talk and Hannah Georgas and Mother Mother, but have finally snagged the mainstream success in Canada they’ve been verging on for a couple years. That being said, this might be the same band from their beginnings in name only. In between 2013’s Warning and the new disc Centerfold, The Darcys slimmed down from three permanent members to two, and completely changed their sound. Fortunately, the band’s existing fanbase seemed to almost unanimously welcome the shift in musical direction. And what great timing. It takes about 5 seconds into ‘Miracle’ to pick up on the George Clinton-style dance influence of the disc’s lead single, directly in line with the discoization of alternative music in 2016 from bands like M83, Saint Motel, Two Door Cinema Club, and Fitz & The Tantrums. With a fat driving dance bassline, punchy-crunchy keyboards, sharp falsetto backing vocals, and groove, The Darcys gave us a near-perfect alt-funk track.\n\nFun Fact: Darcys Wes Marskell contributes articles to The Huffington Post‘s Canada Music section.\n\n# 31 | Absolutely | Ra Ra Riot | 🇺🇸\n\nWe just love that the quirky artsy rockers from Syracuse University (our alma mater) returned to success this year with this energetic track. ‘Absolutely’ strays a bit away from some of the baroque pop style of their previous biggest single ‘Too Dramatic’, but the cello-and-string infusion is happily still a strong part of their sound. Somewhere between old Jimmy Eat World and new Andrew McMahon with a hint of Death Cab, Wes Miles and his companions craft a fairly mainstream synthpop slice of happiness, which they released on New Years Day 2016 as part of a Spotify playlist of some of their fav tracks from some of their fav artists.\n\nFun Fact: It’s no wonder they have a bit of a Death Cab sound, as their 2010 release The Orhard was mixed by now-former Death Cab member Chris Walla.\n\n# 30 | Liana | Joy Formidable |\n\nThe Joy Formidable have been compared to a range of other artists from Belle and Sebastian to Björk, but there is no doubt at all that this album track from 2016’s Hitch is purely from the Stevie Nicks volume of the Fleetwood Mac playbook, complete with Lindsay Buckingham influence in Rhydian Dafydd’s outstanding guitar break, Christine McVie-style keys, and work from drummer Matt Thomas who has never not heard the parallels to Mick Fleetwood, in style and in temperament (even if he looks and sounds more like Russell Brand). And that doesn’t even begin equating Ritzy Bryan’s wonderful Stevie-style whispy, breathy, and powerful vocals. In the way that Led Zeppelin did before them, TJF has always walked the fence between crushing power riff hard rock (‘Cradle’, ‘Little Blimp’) and extremely delicate almost operatic compositions (‘Wolf’s Law’, ‘Silent Treatment’), but few have melded both styles as well as this stellar track from the Welsh threesome.\n\nFun Fact: In 2008, TJF released a Christmas single called ‘My Beerdrunk Soul Is Sadder than a Hundred Dead Christmas Trees’. We feel you.\n\n# 29 | Welcome To Your Life | Grouplove | 🇺🇸\n\nMan, we can’t ever get enough of Grouplove. They put together two of our favorite performances at this year’s Firefly Festival in Dover Delaware (one main stage, one acoustic tent… something they’ve done on the regular before). That’s why it amazes us that they’ve only appeared on the MPH Top 50 twice before (‘Itchin’ on a Photograph’ from Never Trust a Happy Song, and ‘Ways to Go’ from Spreading Rumours). Part of that falls on a small hiatus the band took so singers Hannah Hooper and Christian Zucconi could reproduce. It’s always a question of will the sound or songwriting of a band change when the chief songwriters have a baby together, will the style become softer or take fewer risks? Thankfully, the answer for Grouplove was a resounding ‘no’, nothing’s gonna change. And that shouldn’t surprise us from this group of former artists commune roommates (srsly, they all met at an artist residency in Crete). While their sound is still a Big Mess, as the new disc is titled, this collection of sloppy, jangly, messy parts – as always – comes together as a very unique whole. ‘Welcome To Your Life’ is indeed a greeting to Willa Payne Zucconi entering the world, and we’re always happy to have Grouplove – ever positive, ever optimistic – as part of ours.\n\nFun Fact: While Hooper and Zucconi wrote the music and the verses, drummer Ryan Rabin wrote the chorus… in the shower at the exact time he knew Hooper was giving birth.\n\n# 28 | The Drugs | Mother Mother | 🇨🇦\n\nWe’ll start with a little criticism… what made us fall immediately in love with the first two singles from 2014’s Very Good Bad Thing, ‘Get Out The Way’ and ‘Monkey Tree’, were the risks they took, the odd instrumentation (something not unusual for the unusual Mother Mother), the bold sounds, the different directions. Upon first listen to ‘The Drugs’, the first single released from 2017’s upcoming disc No Culture, we heard… sameness, straightforwardness… the usual. It was disappointing for this highly-anticipated new music from the Guldemond siblings and the rest of the band (including new bassist Mike Young). But as happens on occasion, we heard the song over again, many times, and we just couldn’t get enough of it… much like the song’s titular drugs we used to love. This is actually a return to O My Heart-era MM, which delightfully mixed uncomplicated rock with chances. And that’s why we find here. ‘The Drugs’ moves like a pure rock song, and straightforward lyrics that are quite simply about, well, when chief songwriter Ryan Guldemond was not just deep in the drugs, but, as he says, “things that offer fleeting joy but lasting consequence. Drugs, alcohol, hollow sex, ice cream”. It might take you a few listens, but we’re sure that you’ll be hooked on ‘The Drugs’ (sorry, we had to make the joke, it’s like an addiction).\n\nFun Fact: O Canada Magazine once posited that Mother Mother was The Most Hated Band in Canada. Take that, Nickelback!\n\n# 27 | Rebel Heart | Shelters | 🇺🇸\n\nYes, the opening licks of this song sound exactly like The Beatles ‘I Feel Fine‘ and The Monkees ‘Last Train To Clarksville‘. But that’s where the comparison ends… or does it? So where the hell did this band and this song come from? Out of nowhere it seems. it doesn’t hurt that the record was produced by Tom Petty himself. This track is like Hot Breakfast picked up and recorded a long lost Dave Clark Five or or Troggs song. Part First-Wave British Invasion (the band themselves are from L.A.), part Ramones, part rockabilly. ‘Rebel Heart’ lives in a ready-to-break-out corner of alternative music that’s a throwback to ’60s blues rock – embodied by up-and-coming bands like MONA and The Wrecks – mixed with that unmistakable 2000’s sound of The Strokes, White Stripes, and The Hives, a hint of the new-glam of The Struts, and an Americanized style of Stone Roses-tinged Britpop. Our prediction is that you’ll hear a bunch of songs on the radio in 2017 that sound a lot like this.\n\nFun Fact: Guitarists Josh Jove and Chase Simpson appeared on Tom Petty’s 2014 album Hypnotic Eye, and both play in Tom Petty’s son Dylan’s band.\n\n# 26 | In A World Possessed By The Human Mind | Tragically Hip | 🇨🇦\n\nThere isn’t much you can write about The Tragically Hip that hasn’t been written before, mostly this year. If you don’t know, here’s the elevator pitch: The Tragically Hip (‘The Hip’ to it’s gigantic maple syrup fanbase) is.. sorry, was… the most iconic band in the history of the nation of Canada, and pretty much nowhere else. Exactly a year ago, The Hip’s frontman, singer, and chief songwriter – and himself a Canadian hero – Gord Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. The Hip proceeded to release a farewell album, and launch a hugely-successful cross-Canada farewell tour. From that outstanding final Hip record Man Machine Poem comes the album’s only single, ‘In A World Possessed By The Human Mind’. The song is written as a conversation, in typical Downie hard-to-interpret poetic meter, mostly about jumping to conclusions and how we often view the world through fear but in the end, everything is fine. Although the track was written before his cancer diagnosis, it seems to be very prescient of his current condition and Downie’s always-cheery outlook despite great summits in need of climbing to make things right. If this is indeed the last of the music we get from the mind of Downie, we certainly won’t ever stop being possessed by it.\n\nFun Fact: On July 7, 1989, just 40 people saw Nirvana open up for the Tragically Hip at a club called O’Cayz Corral in Madison Wisconsin. What a coup to have seen that gig.\n\n# 25 | There Will Be Time | Mumford & Sons (with Baaba Maal) | 🇬🇧 🇸🇳\n\nYes, we’ve seen this before: Western English-speaking artist discovers African music and searches out native artists to record with, pushing their music to the background in favor of celebrating the indigenous performer’s style. Paul Simon did it 1986 with Graceland, and now Mumford and Sons have done it 30 years later with their Johannesburg EP, which features Malawi’s Esau Mwamwaya, South Africa’s Beatenberg, and this track starring sensational Senegalese singer Baaba Maal. Unlike Graceland, in which Paul Simon fully embodied the sounds of the apartheid-era South African artists he collaborated with, the Mumfords – while clearly being influenced by Maal’s West African rhythms, retain the banjoless sounds they shifted towards on last year’s Wilder Mind. Which is not a bad thing. What it does is give ‘There Will Be Time’ an almost Dave Matthews-like feel, Matthews of course being a South African native himself. What remains is still a nü-Mumford track, intense and beautiful, not only showcasing Marcus Mumford’s soft and brawny vocals, but also guest Baaba Maal’s soaring, traditional, and inspiring ones as well. We were very fortunate to hear Maal’s join Mumford and Sons on stage live at Deleware’s Firefly Festival this summer, which was simply stunning.\n\nFun Fact: Spin Magazine‘s review of the Johannesburg was titled “Eat, Pray, Banjo”. That’s simply brilliant.\n\n# 24 | If You Want It | Sam Roberts Band | 🇨🇦\n\nWe’ve already highlighted a Francophile Québécois, so what about rock music’s most famous Anglophile Quebecer? Sam Roberts always gets thrown inside the circle of ‘alternative’ music, but truly, what SRB records is simply rock-and-roll. ‘If You Want It’, the lead single from 2016’s TerraForm, floats in on a keyboard riff and drum lick straight out of ’70s arena rock before launching into wonderfully-traditional guys-and-guitars at the mic power pop that could have come from Bachman-Turner Overdrive or Elvis Costello. This track isn’t high art of any form, but just a mix of really strong melodies and Roberts’ always-memorable lyrics. Says Roberts, the song is “about a trip to hell… and hopefully back…” After catching Roberts this fall in Philly at Boot & Saddle and hearing this track live, we’re happy to join him on that excursion.\n\nFun Fact: A large piece of the SRB album Chemical City was written in Australia, where the band rented an old Presbyterian church in the rural town of Newyrbar near Byron Bay, focusing on writing for three solid months… only taking short breaks for surfing trips.\n\n# 23 | I Need Never Get Old | Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats | 🇺🇸\n\nSo how did a rural Missouri soul-gospel-folk-blues-americana singer and his horn-heavy bar band hit the top of the alternative charts? Honestly, the reason is because they’re just. that. good. We all know that Rateliff’s breakthrough track ‘S.O.B.’ was never meant to be a hit. It came out of nowhere, and Rateliff himself wasn’t even sure he wanted to include it on the record. But while ‘S.O.B.’ might have been considered a novelty hit (what DJ doesn’t want to spin a track that screams ‘Sonofabitch!’?), ‘I Need Never Get Old’ is real, hearty, bluesy songcrafting. It’s simply a wonderful song, from its Robbie Robertson-inspired opening guitar riff to the brass section worthy of the legacy of Miami Horns, Kick Horns, or Blood, Sweat & Tears to Rateliff’s absolutely perfect roots-rock Van Morrison-style tenor vocal performance. And as should be true of any good bar band, Rateliff’s music is infinitely grander live on stage, as he proved to us killing the crowd as he opened up the Sunday main stage at Firefly, emoting between every song just how humbled and privileged he was to play his music with his best friends to such a large, attentive, and appreciative audience. It was nearly unbelieveable to him, and the crowd felt the heart-warming gratitude. If there was ever a doubt that vintage rhythm & blues still has a place in indie music, this track – and the full self-titled album – are proof that good music will always find a way.\n\nFun Fact: Before hitting it big, Rateliff worked in a plastics factory, as a carpenter, at a trucking depot, and as a gardener, and was a missionary in Colorado.\n\n# 22 | Kids Conspire | Royal Teeth | 🇺🇸\n\nNew Orleans has a sound that’s an important piece of American music. But despite being from NOLA, Royal Teeth have none of that sound of their hometown. And honestly, that’s okay. Having broken through in 2011 with the hit ‘Wild’, the six-piece band led by singers Gary Larsen and Nora Patterson, still have only one full record and two EP’s to their discograhy, including the latest EP Amateurs, home to this bubbly and exuberant track. The duo’s sweet and effervescent vocals and catchy indie dance pop sensibility from which they have garnered a loyal following shine through on ‘Kids Conspire’. Having caught them live for the fourth time, at Philly’s Milkboy, we can confirm what we’ve always said about them: Outside of possibly Matt & Kim, there are no two people happier on stage than Larsen and Patterson, perpetually ecstatic to be performing music to 8 people or 8,000.\n\nFun Fact: Before each show, the band huddles together and sings a Lady Gaga song and Paula Cole’s ‘I Don’t Want To Wait’ before jumping onto the stage.\n\n# 21 | Kid Who Stays In The Picture | Hot Hot Heat | 🇨🇦\n\nVery rarely do bands that have been together 15 years or more get to leave the stage for good under their own terms, and on good terms. And it makes a statement when you save self-titling an album for your very last. In June, British Columbia’s Hot Hot Heat – best known in the US for their 2005 hit ‘Middle of Nowhere’ and 2003’s ‘Bandages’ – released this track simultaneously with an announcement that their upcoming LP would be their last before amicably breaking up. A bit less loose, a bit less sloppy than the singles they’re previously been known for, ‘Kid Who Stays In The Picture’ contains a groove reminiscent of fellow indie garage Canuck acts like Hollerado, Tokyo Police Club, and Said The Whale, while retaining Steve Bays’ familiar echo-y and nasal vocals. Never a breakout act, we’ll miss Hot Hot Heat, who have always provided dependable, fun music. And this is a great last lead single to go out on.\n\nFun Fact: Their single ‘Bandages’ was removed from the BBC’s playlist at the onset of the war in the Middle East because of the “prevalence of the word ‘bandages’ in the song”. Well, duh.\n\nNumbers 20 – 1:\n\n# 20 | Nobody Really Cares If You Don’t Go To The Party | Courtney Barnett | 🇦🇺\n\nWhile Courtney Barnett’s breakthrough album Sometimes I Sit and Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit was released in 2015, and this track was dropped in August of that year, it didn’t find its way onto deep radio airplay until 2016, thanks in part to two career-making 2016 television appearances: On Stephen Colbert and on SNL (we caught her in the spring performing at Philly’s Electric Factory with Evan Dando’s odd new band). But what can one write about the Melbourne Australia beat poet that hasn’t already been written? Barnett has an innate ability to take the most pedestrian (no pun intended) subject matter, and turn it poetry without losing the everyday of the original story. Her beautiful-but-banal lyrics of procrastination and millennial malaise aren’t deep and hidden under layers of metaphor, but they sound like they are. Maybe the best phrase-turner in music today, Barnett takes her deadpan, rambling Bob Dylan-style lyrics, scratches off anything pretty, and then drones them over the coals of early Nirvana guitar lines, somehow coming out like stripped down Chrissy Hynde or Liz Phair. ‘Nobody Really Cares…’ – a modern-day anthem for introverts in the tradition of ‘Fool On The Hill’ or ‘I Am A Rock’ – showcases Barnett’s crunchy ’90s alternative slacker sound mixed with influences from Beck to Pavement. The track is sharp and honest, friendly and standoffish, loose and conversational, and we’re still not over it.\n\nFun Fact: Barnett lost the 2106 Grammy for Best New Artist to Meghan Trainor, she of the song about having a big butt.\n\n# 19 | Higher | Naked and Famous | 🇳🇿\n\nWe appreciate when bands take new directions, new chances, new experimentations. It takes balls to have success doing something one way, and then do it differently. You might take your career into the next stratosphere, you might piss off every fan you had. But if there is a theme in this year’s Top 50, it’s artists that haven’t changed, that speed forward down the same stretch of highway and are able to do it extremely successfully rather than retreading the same ground. Honestly, ‘Higher’ doesn’t sound very much different from ‘Young Blood’ or ‘Punching In A Dream’. In fact, they’re all very similar. But it’s what TNAF does well, that anthemic post-punk electronica rooted deep in female-fronted New Wave and Electro-Punk acts like Berlin, Human League, ‘Til Tuesday, Martika, and Nena, which was fully on display when we caught them this fall at Philly’s Union Transfer. Thankfully, Alisa Xayalith’s soaring singing over Thom Powers’ extraordinarily-’80s secondary vocals and ’80s synth (and synthy guitar) was never disrupted after the end of their eight-year romantic partnership, but did add a new level of maturity to the lyrical message.\n\nFun Fact: TNAF took their name from the Presidents of the USA song ‘Naked and Famous’, by way of English artist Tricky, and the lyric, “Everybody wants to be naked and famous”.\n\n# 18 | Heart in Two | Reuben & the Dark | 🇨🇦\n\nOne of our favorite discoveries of the year was this indie folk quartet, the bandization of former solo artist Reuben Bullock of Calgary Alberta. After releasing two albums under his solo name and a disc under the Ruben & the Dark moniker in 2014, the band dropped this non-album single to radio in January ahead of the launch of a tour supporting Vance Joy, and found some unexpected airplay. Descending with a soft blues-folk acoustic guitar soon accompanied by a soft keyboard hum, the drums are subtly introduced as the track breaks into quiet soaring chorus – a sadly beautiful ode to the pain of breakup and that piece of your heart, torn in two, that you leave with the now dearly-departed love – which metamorphosizes into a full band production for the remainder of the track. ‘Heart In Two’ itself is a heartbreaking track, pulling you along on its journey of sadness and love lost. The mix of floating and escalating string-driven melody and the agonizing and wrenching lyrics gifted us with the most emotional song on our countdown.\n\nFun Fact: Reuben’s brother Distance (not a typo) was formerly a member of Bullock’s solo backing band, playing percussion and cello, before embarking on his own solo career.\n\n# 17 | Don’t Go | Hannah Georgas | 🇨🇦\n\nWe can’t even tell you how much we love Hannah Georgas, and have since the early Beat Stuff days, and we fluttered in anticipation of her first new music since her self-titled breakthrough album. And with great joy, we were presented with For Evelyn, a record written, well, for Evelyn, her 98-year-old grandmother. The lead single ‘Don’t Go’ is a beautiful piece of angst and agony, a prayer, a petition to God, to a higher power, for mercy, not knowing what she would do if she lost the touch of woman she loves – representing the maternal figures in her life and family – who takes on everyone else’s pain. The track is at once a departure from her earlier, folkier work, and also the natural progression of a stronger electronic influence that began to come to the forefront on her previous record, much of which is most likely due to her continuing collaboration with the track’s co-writer Ryan Guldemond, whose band Mother Mother has made the same journey many times. But the progression from earlier work that the track really shows is a new sense of confidence and assertiveness from Georgas – traditionally writing in shy verse – a strength gained in no small part from those same maternal imprints. ‘Don’t Go’ is sonic and lush, yet dark and minimalist, synth and sample replacing folk and guitar, conveying that feeling of missing home, and the need to assuage the inner despair of distance, which only Georgas can make so beautiful.\n\nFun Fact: Back in her high school days, Georgas played in a band with Tim Oxford, now drummer for Arkells, called Sister Satellite, the “house band” at Air Canada Centre for the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League.\n\n# 16 | Swooner | Zolas | 🇨🇦\n\nTowards the end of last year, Vancouver’s The Zolas blew us away with their churning Pussy Riot-inspired track ‘Molotov Girls’ (cracking our Top 10). As more singles rolled out throughout 2016, the Swooner CD proved to kick off with just about the best first-four tracks on any album this year… ‘Molotov’, ‘Get Dark’, ‘Fell In Love With New York’ (see below), and this title track. The song ‘Swooner’ is a loose and rollicky slice of ’80s inspired electronic pop that offers a more bright and cheery sound than previous records, with a crunchy riff, breezy synth, and garage band vocals delivered with a bit of snark. The track is partypeople music with an edge. But what is ‘Swooner’ about? Says singer Zach Gray, “It’s about those high-functioning women we all know who somehow manage to be the quarterback of their squad and the best at their job and politically engaged and the most fun person to have real talk with over beers. I don’t know how you do it but we salute you.”\n\nFun Fact: Frontman Zachary Gray and Carly Rae Jepsen co-wrote the track ‘LA Hallucinations’ from Jepsen’s 2015’s disc Emotion.\n\n# 15 | Go! | M83 (with Mai Lan) | 🇫🇷\n\nIf you think M83’s hit 2016 track ‘Go!’ (don’t forget the !) doesn’t sound like anything from M83’s breakthrough Hurry Up We’re Dreaming like the dream pop / shoe-gaze brilliance of ‘Midnight City’ or ‘Reunion’, you would be correct. And the reason for that is that Junk, and ‘Go!’, its third single, is the French band’s first disc in a decade without vocalist and keyboardist Morgan Kibby. Kibby was replaced by Kaela Sinclair and Jordan “J. Laser” Lawlor, but this track is sung by French-Vietnamese singer Mai Lan (who also contributed vocals to three other tracks on the disc). The track itself takes about a full minute of intro buildup ending with Mai Lan doing her best David Bowie, counting down to blastoff as the track launches into a disco dance synthpop that on no planet would you peg as M83 if you didn’t know. The meat of the song starts with the bouncy, catchy reverb-heavy chorus (just about the most ear-wormy thing on the radio this year) that dissolves back down into a delicate reprise of the intro, a circuitous journey that repeats once again before the track’s biggest surprise: An out of nowhere heavy metal guitar solo courtesy of Steve Vai (yes, that Steve Vai, of Whitesnake, Spinal Tap, Ozzy Osbourne fame). Says M83 frontman Anthony Gonzalez: “We asked Steve for the craziest space solo possible, which wasn’t hard for him. He sent us three different takes, and we blended two to make the ultimate Steve Vai solo.” New wave dance, a Euro-Asian vocalist, and a hard rock guitar axechop all combine eloquently to make this track Go!\n\nFun Fact: M83’s frontman Anthony Gonzalez ‘s maternal grandfather Laurent Robuschi played pro soccer in France, and was on the French 1966 World Cup team.\n\n# 14 | Push + Pull | July Talk | 🇨🇦\n\nJuly Talk’s 2013 self-titled debut was a gritty, rough, aggressive blues-rock triumph. When you kill it with your freshman release, where do you go from there? You learn from three relentless years on the road as support, sharing the stage with a myriad of other types of artists, and pick up influences wherever you go, double-down on your black/white, dark/light, female/male, plus/minus, yin/yang dynamic, and combine that with a new appreciation with living life in the real world, not behind your screens or texts or whatever expands your digital divide. There’s always been something disconcerting and jarring behind the juxtaposition of dueling vocalists Leah Fay and Peter Dreimanis, that Tom Waits vs Feist battle round (sorry for the overused comparison but it’s just so bloody accurate), that makes July Talk stand out from the new wave of dual-lead-singer acts. With its stabby synths and airy yet grounded vocals, ‘Push + Pull’ (the plus-sign aesthetic starting on their debut coming to full bloom on their new CD and in the music itself) is the quintessence of the band’s ability to change musical mood not only song to song, but within songs themselves. The track, the lead release from the wonderful Touch album, is – dare we say – danceable, with Fey’s pop-for-intellectuals performance alongside Dreimanis’ firm-footed grunty blues (with Ian Docherty, Josh Warburton, and Danny Miles driving a fabulous driving back track) creating something brand new. Disco blues? Hard rock techno? Gravel pop? Garage dance? We’re very thankful that July Talk has kept true to its gritty roots while allowing a plethora of new push-me-pull-you influences to permeate this winning track. If they pass through your town (especially if you live in the US and can still catch them in a small venue as we did this year in New York, Philly, and Brooklyn) and you get a chance to catch them live, do so; you’ll leave a convert.\n\nFun Fact: Not only is drummer Danny Miles a trained paramedic, he’s also an expert ornithological photographer (ie: he takes really cool pictures of birds while he’s on the road) and has a rap award to his credit, as part of Toolshed, which won the 2006 London Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Group. Additionally, without knowing it when they joined the band, bassist Josh Warburton and guitarist Ian Docherty discovered they’re cousins.\n\n[Ed Note: July Talk – all five of them – Peter, Leah, Ian, Danny, and Josh, and Karen, Alex, and their entire support team – are simply the nicest, most generous musicians on the planet. Just, thank you for everything.]\n\n# 13 | Take It From Me | Kongos | 🇺🇸 🇿🇦\n\nWhat does a band of Greek brothers who come to the table with influences borne from growing up in England, South Africa, and the American Southwest sound like? The four siblings – Daniel, Dylan, Jesse, and Johnny Kongos – actually embody the Afrikaner South African sound more than anything else, despite having left that nation before high school for the greener (?) pastures of the deserts of Arizona. With a driving drum groove baked from traditional sub-Saharan rhythms and electronic-enhanced slide guitar accents that also tread on the same the Western US sound of Awolnation, this track about the unstoppable momentum of an ego out of control (either internally or in the greater world… you make the connection if you dare) was written and sung, unsurprisingly, by drummer Jesse. The lead track from the more mature Egomaniac, ‘Take It From Me’ is a bit of a sonic move forward for the band while maintaining the unique sound we were fortunate to catch twice this summer, at the Radio 104.5 Summer Jam and at the Electric Factory Philly on tour with Arkells.\n\nFun Fact: The Kongos brothers’ father John Kongos had a long career as a singer/songwriter back in their native South Africa, where he had a 1971 Top 10 hit ‘He’s Gonna Step on You Again’, which was the basis for the Happy Mondays’ song ‘Step On’. Unrelated, the Kongo people are a group of Bantu people who live along the Atlantic Coast of Africa.\n\n# 12 | Dead Century | Wildlife | 🇨🇦\n\nFor what by any definition is still a small, undiscovered-by-the-masses band, Wildlife is one of the MPH Top 50’s favs, having placed a song on the countdown three years in a row… from the same album: ‘Lightning Tent’, ‘Born To Ruin’, and ‘Dangerous Times’ all from the frustratingly-underappreciated On the Heart. Wildlife continues to bubble under the mainstream, but achieved some attention in 2016 with the first single from a yet-unnamed upcoming album, ‘Dead Century’. While the band maintains the very clear influence of Springsteen, Bowie, and The Clash with a very Canadian polished garage sound being currently carried by Dear Rouge, Born Ruffians, Diamond Rings, and Hey Rosetta!, ‘Dead Century’ – a song about “moving forward through lost time, one foot in an age that no longer exists, and coming to terms with having the other in a world you may never understand” according to the band – delivers a bit more of an airy, ethereal sound that maintains their every-track’s-an-anthem aesthetic. The record’s bright synths, melodic guitar, and lofty vocals give it a big sound like a lost track from The Killers or Kings of Leon. One of our white whales, Wildlife is near the top of our list of bands we want to see touring down here in the states likereallysoon. Hopefully, after the release of the new album, they’ll be touring the world and elsewhere.\n\nFun Fact: Wildlife found their bassist Derek Bosomworth – yes, that’s his name – in Toronto via a Craigslist ad.\n\n# 11 | Spirit | Wintersleep | 🇨🇦\n\nIn discussing some of the great music coming from Canada this year (including their own wonderful release Touch) and the bands who have come down south of the border to blanket the US in support, we mention to Peter Dreimanis, singer of July Talk, before their show at New York’s Bowery Ballroom, that we had caught appropriately-named Nova Scotia-based band Wintersleep twice over the summer, at Brooklyn’s Canada D’eh Festival at The Well and at Philly’s legendary Johnny Brenda’s. “Have you heard their new album? It’s so good.” Yes, indeed we have, and we agree wholeheartedly. In fact, we believe that Wintersleep’s 2016 release The Great Detachment is far-and-away the best record to come out this year. We have honored the disc with – spoiler alert – three songs in this year’s countdown’s top eleven slots, and truthfully, we could have probably added another two more to the full list. ‘Spirit’ – the song that contains within its pre-chorus the lyric that spurned the album title – was probably the most successful single from the album, finding itself a mild-surprise as a hit across Canada and garnering some airplay in the US. Opening with two bars of drum machine-esque anticipation that simply explode into the intro, dissolving into a catchy verse melody straight out of a 100% Cotton commercial followed by a flying shuffle-beat pre-chorus showcasing Paul Murphy’s quivering vocals and a moment of syncopation before releasing the pressure of the chorus and its perfect harmonies. But the high point of the track is the unique and bright bridge, inquiring “Are you mystified?” With lyrics exploring both a dynamic and melancholy eagerness of the zeitgeist, and its okayness, the band asks us – and we find asking ourselves – “Are you gonna be alright?” Wintersleep certainly is, as this is the masterpiece you create when you take four years to craft an album, a long but worthwhile wait.\n\nFun Fact: In July of 2009, Wintersleep (along with Joel Plaskett) performed at the Halifax Common in Nova Scotia opening for Paul McCartney, in front of 27,000 people, Sir Paul having personally picked the band for the gig.\n\n# 10 | Race To The Bottom | Dan Mangan | 🇨🇦\n\nCanadian Dan Mangan was on tour by himself (no backing band) on the East Coast of the US (supporting Vincent James McMorrow) when the US election happened. Mangan has always (well, even more recently) been an artist that never shied away from painting his music with politics. Songs like ‘Post-War Blues’, ‘Vessel’, and ‘Mouthpiece’ have elements that feel very relevant to the divided political atmosphere happening all over the world, in the US, in the UK, and in Canada. But nothing could have been so fateful during the heart of the American election for Mangan than to have out a charting single called ‘Race To The Bottom’. The song, a familiar dark, acoustic-&-trebly-Telecaster guitar track in the the minor key that he is so fond of, is about the reliance on nostalgia, that “the idea that things used to be better is fantasy,” he explains. The viewpoint Mangan has on the track that “all perspectives on the past are entirely relative. The idea that things intrinsically were just better is so stupid to me because they never were. It’s all relative,” can be very much taken to describe the revisionist history of better times that swept Donald Trump into office, even if it wasn’t written that way. And on its own, a track called ‘Race To The Bottom’ – regardless of meaning – was tailor-made to be a song exemplifying the year. With his slip-slide vocals over oddly syncopated and loose guitar typical of his style, Mangan howls out his dispiriting vision of the façade of nostalgia… or the theme of the 2016 US political scene, that’s up to you. “Resist a little bit / Then become The Man” is a message best served cold.\n\nFun Fact: As if Wintersleep doesn’t take up enough room on this countdown already, Wintersleep drummer Loel Campbell plays drums on this Dan Mangan track.\n\n# 9 | Move | Saint Motel | 🇺🇸\n\nFirst thing’s first: If you’ve never seen a 3D video on YouTube, go there now and watch the this song’s video. Secondly, it’s pretty obvious that there is no better titled song on this countdown. Man, does this track from California’s Saint Motel MOVE. Co-written by the band and Joe Jackson (yes, that Joe Jackson of ‘Is She Really Going Out With Him’ and ‘Got The Time’ fame), Saint Motel dropped on us one of the catchiest tracks of the year. The lead single from their sophomore release saintmotelevision, the track pulls you in with a handclap intro that dives into signature horn riffs that slide right to a silky smooth indie prog verse construction that snakes along, somewhere between Fitz & The Tantrums and Asteroids Galaxy Tour. But the killer app here is this the big-ballroom tropicália groove of the chorus, which flings synth and horns at you in perfect swing, pleading with an audience to join them in action, “gotta get up, MOVE!” no questions asked, full of swagger, fevered horns, a savage beat, and good times.\n\nFun Fact: Vocalist A/J Jackson and guitarist Aaron Sharp were both film students in Southern California when they met, much more interested in making films than music. That influence is still prevalent as the band – with only two albums to their credit – has produced 17 music videos, with Jackson directing most of them.\n\n# 8 | Amerika | Wintersleep | 🇨🇦\n\nThere’s a lot of rock on the radio today that can trace its influence back to the sound of The Pixies – Japandroids, OK Go, Cage the Elephant, Modest Mouse – but we never expected Nova Scotia’s Wintersleep to be a line-item on that list. But here it is right in our faces with ‘Amerika’, the outstanding lead single from the brilliant The Great Detachment record, 2016’s best album. And while much of the internet wants to compare this track to the Pixies ‘Where Is My Mind’ (and rightfully so), we can hear it much more in line with the surprisingly-good music that has come from the Kelly Deal-less version of the band from the last few years, like ‘Another Toe In The Ocean’ or ‘Blue-Eyed Hexe’. But the track stands quite well on its own as a churning anthem to everything happening in the political world in 2016 (prescient and accurate), pleading for the answer to “Are you alive, oh my Amerika? / Perennial with the Earth / And freedom, love, and law, and life?”. And that spelling of ‘Amerika’ is no small accident or eye-wink. Throughout history, Amerika with a ‘k‘ has been a symbol of a turn of the nation to a more fascist, oppressive, and culturally inferior 1984-type version of itself, a bleak vision of imperialism and corruption that many fear might be to come. But the song itself found inspiration from the Walt Whitman poem ‘America’, which stands in contrast to that vision as a tribute to the beauty of the singularly American democratic process, full of hope and promise and optimism that many find lacking lately. The song’s music video echos those sentiments, something out of Red Dawn, stark and bleak and stunning and beautiful all at the same time. It’s that dichotomy that comes through stingingly in this stellar track musically as well, as a ball of energy and dystopianism hurtling through space in that raw, staccato, churning Pixies-meets-Clash as done by Neil Young style. Singer Paul Murphy’s nasal chanting vocals (especially in the anthemic chorus), Loel Campbell’s snare-heavy winding drum line, and Tim D’Eon’s crunchy churning cycling guitar all come together almost in slow-motion, and capture a live, raw sound helped by recording the track live-off-the-floor at The Sonic Temple in Halifax, where they recorded their first three records.\n\nFun Fact: ‘Amerika’s lyric “Perennial with the Earth, with Freedom, Law and Love” comes directly from the Walt Whitman poem ‘America’.\n\n# 7 | Work Shoes | USS (Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker) | 🇨🇦\n\nWe’ll just come out and say it: We at December’s End don’t like 21 Pilots. We like nothing about them. We even dislike that ‘Heathens’ starts out like something we’d like but then turns on its TOP-ishness and ruins it. But if you like 21 Pilots, we’re pretty sure you’ll like Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker, or USS as they are more commonly known. They’re weird. There’s no doubt. They have a unique rock-grunge-dubstep-rap aesthetic that’s not fully understood without a few listens through. The band is a two piece, much like 21 Pilots, featuring vocalist / guitarist (and erhu-ist) Ash “Boo-Schultz” Buchholz and DJ Jason Parsons, better known as The Human Kebab. You read that right. Following up their stellar 2014 effort Advanced Basics, featuring the standout track ‘Yin Yang’, the debut single ‘Work Shoes’ from their latest New World Alphabet picks up right were USS left off. Chunky and scratchy, ‘Work Shoes’ is a get-the-party-started afterwork anthem for both the blue and white collar crowds that falls somewhere sonically between 311 and Awolnation. Starting out with a techno-inspired acoustic guitar sample sounding like something from an Everlast track, the song pushes forward, propeled by Bucholz’ hip-hop-esque lyrics & modern rock guitar and Kebob’s electropop drum-and-bass rhythm section, culminating in a beat drop chorus that compels one to bolt from work at the first hint of that factory-close whistle, like Fred Flintstone sliding down the back of that dinosaur into his steamroller car, by the time the song fades out.\n\nFun Fact: In November 2016, USS played six sold out shows at six different venues in six days around Toronto, a mini-tour entitled ‘Six in the 6ix’ (for Toronto’s area code 416).\n\n# 6 | Private School | Arkells | 🇨🇦\n\nWe’ve lost so many important musicians in 2016 – from Bowie, Prince, and Leonard Cohen to George Michael, Rick Parfitt, and Greg Lake – that we consider ourselves lucky that we’ll get another year with The Tragically Hip’s Gord Downie still around, despite the conclusion of his band this year due to Downie’s terminal brain cancer. There are many Canadian bands greatly influenced by their poetry, kindheartedness, and musicianship staking a claim as possible heirs to the Hip’s crown, but we feel the most rightful successor would be Hamilton Ontario’s own Arkells, although we suspect the band would simply laugh off the notion. Arkells are just about our favorite music people on the planet. You would be hard-pressed to find any band touring today as personally in touch, in rhythm, and in sync with their fan base, and who so freely do so with such gratitude. It wouldn’t surprise me to find out that frontman and chief songwriter Max Kerman believes that the audience is as much a part of the band, as critical a part of their organization, as the band itself is. Kerman, Mike Deangelis, Tony Carrone, Nick Dika, and Tim Oxford have been friends of this site for a long time, and we were so excited to find out that 2016 would bring new music to follow up 2014’s wonderful High Noon disc. Taking more risks as a more mature band, High Noon was a different album than its predecessors, so we were set up for more changes in direction with the new Morning Report album. Turns out, we underestimated. Morning Report took many, many different directions – pop, rock, hip-hop, dance, singer/songwriter, and R&B, added to their already-established gin-soaked garage sound of Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Wilco, Arcade Fire, and, yes, The Hip. The experimentations in new sounds start off with a band on lead single ‘Private School’, a track calling out privilege and entitlement (and maybe even Trumpism) embodied by those kids in the prep school jackets and ties “Born on third base / Thought they hit a triple”. An unfastened, rabble-rousing, tongue-in-cheek take on entitlement and privilege, the swagger-laden track bows with Morning Phase-era Beck blended into ‘90s R&B swing and just a little Kanye, and quickly steamrolls into a Billy Joel-style crescendo of a chorus which implores “I just want to love you / But it’s so hard.” But the most memorable section of the track is a boozy/sloppy bridge with a churning Oasis-esque, piano-heavy bottom end under frat-boy call-to-action lyrics (“I wanna go to the party / I wanna drink the Bacardi / Who’s bringing the molly? / Who’s gonna stop me?”). When the band performs this track live, it’s clear Kerman wants the audience to be on the main-stage-extended, imploring an army of middle-fingers in the air as he preaches “Ahhhhh fuck off! / Don’t say I’d do the same”. ‘Private School’ is a muddled, beautiful mess of styles, thematic of the rest of the disc, and the anti-privilege anthem we need in Trump’s New World Order. When Arkells roll through your town, be sure to catch the show, as we did NINE times in 2016. You’ll leave the show wanting to know where your residual check it as part of the band now.\n\nFun Fact: For their very fun video for Private School, they recruited some Canadian pop rock royalty for cameos in the clip, including indie singer Lights, Tokyo Police Club’s Dave Monks, and Sum 41’s Steve Jocz… who also directed this video.\n\n[Ed Note: A special MPH Top 50 thank you to Arkells – all five, but Max in particular – for being such wonderful friends to those behind this site. Not only have we shared a great deal of outstanding music and fun times with them in three different states this year, they have been incredibly helpful in all aspects, and we truly appreciate their kindness and generosity. It would have been a much more difficult year without them, musically and otherwise, we are thankful for the personal connections they’ve opened towards us. We’re going to be happy-sad when your shows in the US are so massive we barely get to see you.]\n\n# 5 | Empty | Garbage | 🇺🇸 🇬🇧\n\nThe three gentlemen in Garbage are 57, 61, and 65 years old. Forever young Shirley Manson is a spry-in-comparison 50. Having formed in 1994, at 22 years and going, Garbage are far and away the oldest band on our list this year, in any metric you decide to view it (beating out Death Cab by at least three years). It was a long seven years between the Bleed Like Me and Not Your Kind of People records, so thankfully the wait until this year’s Strange Little Birds disc was only a scant four [Ed. Note: Still too long]. While this album wasn’t as strong top to bottom as previous releases, ‘Empty’, its lead single, is as good, if not as typical, a classic Garbage track as anything since beautifulgarbage. While the band clearly sees no reason to cater to new sounds and trends of the day, you can’t fully say that they’re acting as a nostalgia band as the music does indeed continue to grow. Regardless, from the first note of ‘Empty’, you know this is Garbage, as no one else sounds like this. Steve Marker and Duke Erickson’s clean, abrupt phrased guitar work over Butch Vig’s click-track-perfect big drums maintain the comfortable and familiar sound of ‘Supervixen’ or ‘Shut Your Mouth’, while quintessential Manson vocals – with a mature assertiveness replacing the anger of her younger days – still resonates with middle-finger rancor and fire as she revisits the same thematic acrimony, usually at herself, as she did in the ’90s, decreeing “I lie awake believing / That somehow I keep failing / I rail and I ache / At the monsters and the demons / I’ve wrestled with for eons / And I want to destroy.” You can’t hear the track without the vision in your head of Manson front and center on stage ahead of her bandmates, mic at her lips, one elbow in the air, one hand on her hip, legs astride, evoking the power she emanates. Says Manson, “‘Empty’ is just exactly what it says it is. A song about emptiness.” If age, wisdom, and persistence hasn’t slowed Manson and Garbage down yet or pointed them down into that emptiness for good, we don’t foresee that happening any time soon. For 22 years now, gloom has never sounded so beautiful.\n\nFun Fact: The first time Garbage all came together (the three males having recruited Manson after seeing her previous band Angelfish perform on MTV’s 120 Minutes) was on April 8, 1994, the same day Kurt Cobain shot himself. Garbage’s Butch Vig was, of course, famously the producer of Nirvana’s Nevermind.\n\n# 4 | Fell in Love with New York | Zolas | 🇨🇦\n\nThe second track from The Zola’s outstanding up-tempo party-pop-packed record Swooner, ‘Fell In Love With New York’ (also previously and lightly released on the Wino Oracle EP) is the sort of a required coming-of-age track about the perils and peculiarities of the Big Apple, that moment you begrudgingly accept the beautiful crapstorm that is New York and become a true New Yorker, where you’ve found yourself in others, the love/hate lost/found relationship all New Yorkers have with the city they call home. We know that feeling. ‘Fell In Love…” is a loose and rollicky slice of indie ’80s-inspired swinging electronic pop with a crunchy riff and breezy synth that embodies the sound of Swooner, a more bright and cheery sound than previous efforts. Twice this year, we rolled into New York on the NJT Northeast Corridor Line for city shows (once to see July Talk, once for Wintersleep & Whitehorse) when our mp3 player graced us with this uber-appropriate track. TWICE. For reals. Thanks for the soundtracking, Zolas!\n\nFun Fact: Frontman Zachary Gray says he has a special spot at The University of British Columbia in which he likes to sit when stuck on a song. “I’ve written in that one chair ever since I went to school there so I’ve been writing in that chair for a long time.”\n\n# 3 | Good Help (Is So Hard to Find) | Death Cab For Cutie | 🇺🇸\n\nHooks hooks hooks. No one knows how to pen a perfect indie pop – dare we say emo? shoegaze? – hook like Ben Gibbard. Riffs and lines and progressions full of despair and heartbreak and introspection form throughlines throughout Death Cab For Cutie’s discography. A full fifteen months after the release of Kintsugi‘s first single ‘Black Sun’, the record dropped its third single, containing one of the most poppy, grooving, happy (???) guitar lines the band ever recorded. You can almost dance to it! With a smile! This near perfect guitar run has two parts making up the whole: Chris Walla’s airy, uncomplicated rhythm line strummed along, heavy on the B and high-E strings, churning along, carrying the track along with it; and a lead line riff that slides smoothly and effortlessly up and down Gibbard’s guitar neck, setting up the melody. (And let’s not forget our fortune of having one last Death Cab single with Walla – on guitar and keys but not producing for the first time – who announced in 2014 that this record would be his last with the band.) ‘Good Help…’ is a dreamy pop record, full of clean disco-inspired beats, full of the things we love about Death Cab, including uncommon instrumentation and Gibbard’s singular vocals and unique lyrics. There were many that oldschool DCFC fans didn’t like Death Cab’s previous release Codes and Keys, and pointed their fingers squarely at Gibbard’s new wife Zooey Deschanel. How could Death Cab be full of gloom and emo and hairflip if Gibbard was…. happy?!!? Those folks got their wish as the two split before the recording of this disc, and the influence is clear in this track, as a critique of the celebritism he encountered in LA with Deschanel. “I noticed all these neuroses and psychoses,” he says. “I wrote it from a point of biting empathy. Celebrity is a strange way of living one’s life.” What Gibbard does well on this song, and on this disc, is leave his body on stage and join his soul with the fans in the audience, explaining how he sees his world through their eyes. We felt that this summer, as Death Cab were certainly a top-5 performance we caught at Dover Delaware’s Firefly Festival.\n\nFun Fact: Kintsugi, the name of the newest Death Cab album, is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with liquid gold. In other words, the art of fixing something broken by making it even more beautiful.\n\n# 2 | Consider Yourself | Half Moon Run | 🇨🇦\n\nOur countdown this year is chockfulla stellar sophomore efforts. That’s no different for Montréal’s Half Moon Run, with their second record and third appearance on the MPH Top 50 – the unique ‘Call Me In The Afternoon’ hitting our inaugural list in 2012, and ‘Turn Your Love’ appearing in last year’s Top 5. And the progression is not minor. While ‘Consider Yourself’ is from their second and most recent album Sun Leads Me On, as is ‘Turn Your Love’, ‘Turn Your Love’ was written during the sessions for their debut effort, Dark Eyes, from which came ‘Call Me In The Afternoon’. Most of what was laid down for Dark Eyes was a unique hard-to-describe indie folk sound with almost a Broadway or streetcorner busker vibe. And what was heard on ‘Turn Your Love’ (written in the former, produced in the latter) was a transition to more polished, less-folky sound of Sun Leads. ‘Consider Yourself’ is expansive, emotional, and ethereal. An atmospheric but not space-y electric alternative dance track with gorgeous, rhythmic harmonies, grooving guitar lines, and subtle electronica. The cut tiptoes along on jaunty keyboards, slicing synth guitar, and tight harmonies that resolve in and out with no real separation between verse and chorus, punctuated by an understated keys, piano, and guitar sonic bridge break. On what was close to being our Album of the Year last year, Sun Leads Me On is littered with wonderful songs, and if you’re looking for something different, cerebral, tight, and sonic for listening in 2017, check out this outstanding record and its top tracks including this and ‘Turn Your Love’, as well as the My Morning Jacket-style ‘Narrow Margins’, Radiohead-inspired ‘The Debt’, and the Arcade Fire-esque ‘Trust’, all which we were happy to catch live (and what a great, barebones, sensory, and tactile experience this band is in person) at one of our fav shows this year, at Philly’s year-old Foundry venue.\n\nFun Fact: Attention unsigned bands made up of childhood friends who play tiny clubs for years begging for your big break: Most of Half Moon Run met through a Craigslist ad, having never met each other until they started playing together… with none of them ever having been in a real band before. And oh, then they were signed before ever playing their first real live gig.\n\n# 1 | Santa Fe | Wintersleep | 🇨🇦\n\nYes, this is Halifax quartet Wintersleep’s third song on our countdown (with a fourth in our ‘next five’), all in the top 11. Is that overkill, you may ask? The answer is a resounding ‘no’. These cuts off the stellar The Great Detachment, our 2016 Album of the Year (see below), are fully deserving of any and all praise (read above, at Numbers 11 and 8). And of all the choices off the disc, the standout track of standout tracks is the Arcade Fire / Radiohead infused ‘Santa Fe’. With the best use of vocoder since Neil Young’s Trans (sorry Daft Punk), ‘Santa Fe’ is simply a straight-up rock song – full of loud arena-rock guitars and an airy pseudo-Kings of Leon solo, powerful vocals, and furious driving drums – that hearkens back to our days of filling up nighttime driving song mix tapes. When Paul Murphy’s sneery vocals let loose from the vocoder, his nasal soulful voice comes into full effect, sweeping through you, while Murphy, Tim D’Eon, and Mike Bigelow (playing on his last Wintersleep recording) combine on a tight but unadorned instrumental interplay between guitar, bass, and keys, that produces an almost circuitous path around the melody. You can credit much of that booming, moving feel to producer Tony Doogan, who has done the same for bands like Teenage Fanclub, Belle & Sebastian, and Mogwai. ‘Santa Fe’ is an airy and atmospheric slice of mesmerizing alt rock that’s a natural progression for the band’s sixth album in a dozen years, with graceful arrangements flowing under a hypnotic and haunting melody. “This is for me a simple love song about wanting a second chance. I think of Elvis when I hear it because there’s something very ‘Suspicious Minds’ in the sentiment for the character in the song,” says Murphy. “But maybe it’s because Tony kept telling me ‘Could you sing it a bit more like Elvis?'” Coming in at Number One on our Top 50, Wintersleep’s ‘Santa Fe’ has us All Shook Up.\n\nFun Fact: Wintersleep was the only name the band ever considered, and was originally supposed to be an album title. Early in his career, vocalist Paul Murphy wrote a song called ‘Hibernation’, and his German wife asked what it meant. When told, she replied the German word was “Winterschlaf”, which literally translates to Wintersleep.\n\nHonorable Mentions (The Next Five):\n\n# 56 | My Heart’s Always Yours | Arkells | 🇨🇦\n\n# 57 | Tearing Me Up | Bob Moses | 🇨🇦\n\n# 58 | Love as a Weapon | Little Scream | 🇺🇸\n\n# 59 | Territory | Wintersleep | 🇨🇦\n\n# 60 | Dancing On Glass | Saint Lucia | 🇿🇦\n\n2016 Superlatives (Click here to skip down to the YouTube & Spotify playlists.)\n\nMPH Top 15 Albums of the Year (Winner at top, remainder in alphabetical order):\n\nWintersleep, The Great Detachment (Dine Alone Music), Released March 4 2016 (winner)\n\nArkells, Morning Report (Last Gang Records), Released August 5 2016\n\nDandy Warhols, Distortland (Dine Alone Music), Released April 8 2016\n\nGrouplove, Big Mess (Atlantic Records), Released September 9 2016\n\nHannah Georgas, For Evelyn (Dine Alone Music), Released June 24 2016\n\nHot Hot Heat, Hot Hot Heat (Kaw-Liga Records), Released June 24 2016\n\nImaginary Cities, Leftovers EP (Hidden Pony, Votiv), Released August 12 2016\n\nJohn K Samson, Winter Wheat (Anti-), Released October 21 2016\n\nJoy Formidable, Hitch (Caroline Records), Released March 25 2016\n\nJuly Talk, Touch (Sleepless Records, Island Records), Released September 9 2016\n\nLumineers, Cleopatra (Dualtone, Dine Alone), Released April 8 2016\n\nNaked & Famous, Simple Forms (Somewhat Damaged), Released October 14 2016\n\nSam Roberts Band, TerraForm (Secret Brain Inc), Released August 12 2016\n\nTokyo Police Club, Melon Collie and the Infinite Radness Part 1 (Dine Alone Music), Released April 8 2016\n\nZolas, Swooner (Light Organ Records), Released March 4 2016\n\nMPH Top 10 Concerts of the Year (Winner at top, remainder in chronological order):\n\nArkells (with Foxtrot & The Get Down), Underground Arts, Callowhill, Philadelphia PA, October 20 2016 (winner)\n\nMetric and Joywave, The Fillmore Philadelphia, Fishtown, Philadelphia PA, March 15 2016\n\nHeather Nova (with Chris Riffle), Tin Angel, Northern Liberties, Philadelphia PA, April 5 2016\n\nHalf Moon Run (with Jesse Mac Cormack), The Foundry at The Fillmore, Fishtown, Philadelphia PA, May 7 2016\n\nWintersleep and Plants & Animals, Johnny Brenda’s, Northern Liberties, Philadelphia PA, May 11 2016\n\nCourtney Barnett (with Evan Dando & The Sandwich Police), Electric Factory, Spring Garden, Philadelphia PA, May 26 2016\n\nGarbage (with Kristin Kontrol), The Fillmore Philadelphia, Fishtown, Philadelphia PA, July 30 2016\n\nBelly, Union Transfer, Spring Garden, Philadelphia PA, August 14 2016\n\nJuly Talk (with See), Rough Trade, Williamsburg, Brooklyn NY, August 18 2016\n\nDead Milkmen (with F.
