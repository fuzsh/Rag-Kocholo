        "text": "Zine - Smash It Up, November 1980\n\nThis issue of Smash It Up is all about politics. This issue came out in November 1980.\n\nIt starts out with an article on the KKK trying to start up a chapter in Toronto and the writer calls for a media blackout of the organization.\n\nThis article is followed by a piece on Rock Against Racism which looked at how the organization evolved in Toronto. They mentioned the English roots to the organization with bands like Elvis Costello and Gang of Four and the Specials and the Clash. And then there was references to local punk bands like the Sharks who write a tribute to Albert Johnson called \"Metro's Number one Problem\". And Young Lions had a sing with the lyrics \"One little nazi is one too many\".\n\nThere is an interview with the leader of the Young Communist League of Canada, Sylvie Baillargeon.\n\nThere is a piece on Leon Trotsky.\n\nAnd there is a note about a cancellation of a Clash gig and Maple Leaf Gardens that Teenage Head was supposed to play.\n\nThis issue appears here courtesy of Dhaibid James's archival collection. Dhaibid is host of the Moondog's Ballroom on CIUT 89.5 FM.\n\nThe Diodes \"Action/Reaction\" LP\n\nThis record came out in October 1980 on Orient Records which was an independent label run by Willi Morrison and Ian Guenther. The Diodes decided to leave CBS after their second record \"Released\" was shelved. John Catto describes this record as their \"commercial\" album. It has a huge sound from a production standpoint and the band had been touring extensively with bands like U2 so they were also at the top of their game from a musicianship standpoint. John Hamilton had left the band and Mike Lengyell replaced him on drums. \"Strange Time\" and \"Rock It\" were the first single released from this record which came out around the same time. John Catto and Ian Mackaye felt \"City of the Dead\" was the strongest on this release. \"Catwalker\" was the song that got them rotation on radio. This was released as the second single along with the title track. However \"Polaroid\" is the hidden gem on this release in my opinion. The artwork is a photo of a collection of rayguns that George Whiteside which was fun and stunning. You can hear the band talk about this release on a show we did on November 13th, 2011. The songs on here are:\n\n1. That Was The Way It Was\n\n2. Catwalker\n\n3. Strange time\n\n4. Polaroid\n\n5. Action Reaction\n\n6. City of the dead\n\n7. Rock it over and under\n\n8. Everything I am\n\n9. Edge of darkness\n\nBongo Beat Records has made this material available again on a CD which contains a number of other songs which are:\n\n10. Survivors (an out take from the Action Reaction recording)\n\n11. Ghost Story (recorded April 8, 1981 at Stagesound)\n\n12. Heat of the beat (recorded April 8, 1981 at Stagesound)\n\n13. Catwalker (recorded at Eastern Sound on December 1979)\n\n14. Spanish Main (recorded at Eastern Sound on December 1979)\n\n15. Play with fire (Live at Horseshoe and broadcast on CFNY on June 7, 1980)\n\nZine - Smash It Up\n\nThis is another issue of Smash It Up that came out somewhere in the fall of 1980. The editorial on the second mentions that this is the eigth issue to come out in the year so I imagine it would have been out in September or October. The cover is in Russian and in true Smash It Up fashion fills a need to play with the name of the publication. It was a provocative thing to do given that 1980 was the height of the Cold War being played out through a nuclear arms race. The zine plays up like a Russian issue that has been translated. The circulation of the zine was somewhere between 25 and 50 copies and was sold for $0.20 a copy.\n\nThis issue starts out with an interview with Gary Numan at the Holiday Inn, which was more like a shrug off. On the same page is a playlist and a list of new releases that had just come out.\n\nThe next feature is a piece on heavy metal with brief descriptions of bands like Sabbath and Priest and Saxon and KISS.\n\nThe next piece is about a band named the Civilians and they were about to release a record on Star Records (the label that put out the first Forgotten Rebels LP). The Garys thought they were too metal so they never booked them.\n\nThere was an interview with the Demics just after the album had been released. One of the big concerns by that record gets asked which is about the album sounding too overproduced.\n\nThere is a piece on the Sharks that took four attempts to get. The inteviewer spent some time trying to interview the band (four times) and there are some answers but different members in some of those times. But at the end the interview read a bit like the Tyranna interview that followed. I liked te Tyranna interview better.\n\nThere is a review section on punk films and one of those was a showing of a film named Crash 'n Burn about the club in Toronto that was shown in an art gallery. There was reviews of \"D.O.A.\", \"Punking Out\", \"The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle\" and some reggae films like \"The Harder they Come\" and \"Dread, Beat and Blood\". There is also a big piece on a film which had the Clash in it called \"Preacher Man\".\n\nThere is also some great record reviews which includes one of the Talking Heads \"Remain in Light\".\n\nThe back cover had a neat poster photo of a band named the Feds that promotes a new single and a show for November at the Edge.\n\nThanks to Dhaibid James of Moondog Ballroom for loaning us the issue to scan."
