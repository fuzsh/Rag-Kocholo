Due to legal action by K-tel Records, the group dropped the \"K\" in its name on the record label and then changed the band name to Young Canadians. The B-side label on most copies was rubber-stamped \"Young Canadians.\" All three tracks appear on the No Escape Compilation by Zulu Records, Vancouver."
