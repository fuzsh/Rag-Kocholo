The No No Room is in the basement of Dock Ellis and is near the location of the infamous Faith/Void. The space is run by Brad Manners of School Damage and fits about 60 people capacity. Perfect for punk shows. Bee, the drummer, from Kleener organized the show. Nuclear Man went on first and they shouted out Winnipeg and Regina at the beginning of their set. They were able to get a crowd reaction right away. Kleener were next and they ripped through a set challenged by landing endings. But the bass and drums drove that sound and the singer was able to move into the audience in a way that stirred things up. Human Target featured some members of Nuclear Man and others making me think of Fuck bands but this was no Fuck Band. They played a crushing set. Tashme topped it off with some a bass sound that was part Lip Cream part Cro Mags part something else. The drummer was insanely good. This whole band was solid as you will hear in these recordings.\n\nNUCLEAR MAN - Molotov (Self-Released)\n\nKLEENER - Paradise Picnic (Self-Released)\n\nHUMAN TARGET - Bottom Feeder (Self-Released)\n\nTASHME - World Burns (Self-Released)\n\nLet’s Skate 1995/1996 (Chris)\n\nGOB - Lobster Boy (Mint)\n\nSATANIC SURFERS - Better Off Today (Theologian)\n\nANOTHER JOE - Circle Jerk (Landspeed)\n\nMARILYN’S VITAMINS - Holes In The Safety Net (Raw Energy)\n\nPROPAGANDHI - Fuck Machine (Fat Wreck Chords)\n\nDemo Feature\n\nTonight’s demo features is a band out of Sudbury named Psychbike.

Floyd grew up in Palestine, Texas as a conscientious objector. I am going to try and give you a sense of the band’s Reagan-era politics in this set. Most aggressively upfront was Floyd himself, a fat, openly gay man who often wore drag while performing to Eighties Texas crowds. “Dicks Hate the Police,” has become one of the most covered songs in the punk scene. I could probably do a show on covers of this song. So in our tribute to Gary Floyd we are going to start there.\n\nTHE DICKS - The Dicks Hate the Police (Radical)\n\nTHE DICKS - Anti-Klan (Part 1)\n\nTHE DICKS - Kill From The Heart\n\nTHE DICKS - Off-duty Sailor\n\nTHE DICKS - Nobody Asked Me\n\nBUTTHOLE SURFERS\n\nEarly 2024 Can Con\n\nABSOLUT - Madhouse (Prescription)\n\nBRAIN ITCH - Destitution (Self-released)\n\nBOOTLICKER - Mercy Dog (Neon Taste / Static Shock)\n\nRATPISS - Piss (Self-released)\n\nKRASH - There’s No Escape (Blown Out Media)\n\nDemo Feature\n\nTonight’s demo feature is a band from Toronto called Kleener.

I stumbled across their band instagram right after I had already prepared my last segment. There have been a ton of new bands popping up in St. John’s, which is very exciting to see. Aside from my regionalism as a Newfie, I really do think that there’s something special about geographically isolated places and the cultural output from them. I spoke a little with Spencer from the band to get some background: They started a little over a year ago and played their first show as a 3 piece before adding another member. They recorded the demo themselves in Spencer’s basement, and released it on Open Veins, a Newfoundland label and zine. The demo features samples including several that are anti-cop; including news reports about former RNC constable Doug Snelgrove convicted in 2021 and sentenced to 4 years in prison for sexual assault while on duty, and the sexual assault cases that came to light after that.\n\nDISCIPLINARY ACTION - Nice Hustle Ton ‘o Fun.

Drew was active in the 90s, Sydney street punk and Oi scene with his bands Compound Fracture (or Com Frac) and Stanley Knife, before moving from Australia to Toronto; where he formed Riot 99. I couldn’t tell you the exact show I met Drew at in 1999, but I can tell you that after meeting him, things were never the same for our little group of Scarborough punks or the Toronto scene as a whole. One of the wildest people I’ve ever met. A borne story teller. A writer. An actor. A musician. An, a poet. Drew loved to make ordinary situations extraordinary and spin tales of his life back in Australia, abroad (in Hong Kong and India) and keep you posted on his latest piss takes. We’re going to kick the set off with a song played by Com Frac, Stanley Knife and Riot 99.

Well, there might be one singular frill. The second song on the four-song demo adds a little post-punky WIRE vibe into their standard faster realm of mid-tempo punk sound, and it is the coolest song on the tape. All the songs are instantly catchy and driving. The demo is short enough that if you’re anything like me, you’ll end up flipping it over and over when the tape clicks just to get your fix. - MRR #486 • NOVEMBER 2023\n\nZERO BARS - Vulgar Econo (Self-Released)\n\nZERO BARS - Pinhead Dust (Self-Released)\n\nZERO BARS - Heist (Self-Released)\n\nZERO BARS - Goon (Self-Released)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nRadio : EXD 1292 - Sunday July 14, 2024\n\nDownload the show here\n\nOn this edition of EXD,\n\nan interview with Tashme\n\na set inspired by Joey Keithley’s book “I Shithead - A life in Punk” (Dishrags, Modernettes, DOA)\n\nnew releases by Human Target, Nuclear Man, Gen Gap, Black Adidas, Boids, Shit Tax, Cell Deth, Squander, and Wolf Brigade.\n\nCanadian Screamo between 2006-2010 (Etobicoke Death Squad, Gunnar rapido, Black Faxes)\n\na demo feature by Pust\n\nCRESS - Progress (Flat Earth)\n\nBee\n\nCHEETAH CHROME MOTHERFUCKERS - Furious Party (Belfagor)\n\nHUMAN TARGET - Chained to Life (Self Released)\n\nNUCLEAR MAN - Nuked Ass (Self released)\n\nGEN GAP - Reject (MF)\n\nSIN 34 - After You (Spinhead / Sinister Torch)\n\nJoe Keithley I-Shithead Memoir review (Andre)\n\nTHE DISHRAGS - Love Is Shit (Supreme Echo)\n\nTHE SUBHUMANS - America Commits Suicide (SST)\n\nTHE POINTED STICKS - No Use For You (Quintessence)\n\nMODERNETTES - Confidential (Quintessence)\n\nYOUNG CANADIANS - Hawaii (Quintessence)\n\nD.O.A. - Bullet Catcher (Rock Hotel / Sudden Death)\n\nRob\n\nCUT PIECE - I Don't Share Control (Total Punk)\n\nBLACK ADIDAS - Are We There Yet (Dirt Cult)\n\nBOIDS - Leather Jacket (Stomp)\n\nTHE MERINGUES - The Lottery (Self-released)\n\nDION LUNADON - By My Side (In The Red)\n\nCanadian Screamo 2006-2010 (Nicky)\n\nHEY PREDATOR! - Ochre essence (Tomb Tree)\n\nCOALSPUR - Nothing Happens in Vegas (Self-released)\n\nETOBICOKE DEATH SQUAD - Extra, Extra!
