        "text": "Porterhouse Records is thrilled to announce the addition of Pointed Sticks to its roster. The band arrived with the west-coast's first wave of punk and power pop acts and were at the top of every critic's list. Their debut 'Perfect Youth' was an instant classic. With production from Bob Rock and artwork from Jimmy Cummings the package is considered a landmark in power-pop and punk circles. It was originally released on Vancouver's legendary Quintessence Records who ran into financial difficulty immediately after the record's November 1980 release. The band broke up shortly afterwards.\n\nFlash forward to 2006 and Pointed Sticks reforming, bringing fans a string of full length releases capped by their latest, 'Beautiful Future' which is available on 12\" vinyl in our webstore. The LP features the single \"Infected\" which will be released shortly.\n\nPorterhouse has absorbed the band's entire recorded catalog including the full-length LPs 'Three Lefts Make A Right' and the self-titled 'Pointed Sticks.' We will be releasing music both new and old from the band in the future!\n\nBe sure to stream the entire Pointed Sticks catalog here at the band's Artist Destination and catch them live as well. We've posted upcoming shows at out tour page. A warm Porterhouse welcome to Pointed Sticks!\n\nWe blazed through our limited pressings of Urge Overkill's \"Saturation\" and All's \"Pummel\" so we cranked up the presses again to bring new variants to the people!\n\nWe've got \"Saturation\" in 30th Anniversary Opaque White with orange labels and \"Pummel\" in a gorgeous red label on cherry red vinyl configurationâ¦ Sweet!\n\nJump over to the record store and order today because with only 500 copies pressed of each these will go exceedingly fast.\n\nBe sure to check out your latest edition of Big Takeover Magazine for a deep dive on\n\nModernettes and Los Popularos founding member John Armstrong, written by Allan McInnis.\n\nAllan cracks open a door to the past when the Vancouver punk scene was one of the most\n\nactive and creative in North America. Johnâs work as a key songwriter and performer was widely\n\nrespected at the time and Porterhouse is now re-issuing that body of work for all to enjoy.\n\nThe subscription-less can read the article here at our website. Be sure to stream all the\n\nModernettes and Los Popularos releases here at our website at both bandâs respective Artist\n\nDestinations."
