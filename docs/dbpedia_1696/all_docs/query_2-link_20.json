Their name was originally an acronym for Unemployment Insurance but was changed to Underground In Canada. After conquering the small number of clubs in and around London, Ontario, they moved to Toronto in 1984. Following the first two releases, Treibner and Heywood quit to form their own band Positively Stompin’. They were replaced by Kelly and Bechta. They also expanded the line-up to include Sterling and Clatney on keyboards and percussion respectively. In 1994 Treibner, Heywood and Mittelholtz formed Positively Stompin and were signed to Vertigo. This effectively ended U.I.C. They called it quits after a farewell tour in late 1995; Dave Robinson joined Oshawa band El Speedo in late 1996, after two years with El Speedo, Robinson and guitar player Ken Mikalauskis started The Chickens. They soon added two original members from UIC in 1999. The Chickens released two albums – 2004’s ‘Bring It On’ was produced by Dale Morningstar – and after six years played with Soundtrack of our Lives at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto; Murray Heywood now lives in Oshawa and is a youth pastor. He is also developing two youth Christian bands; Fred Robinson now played guitar for The Legendary Dirtbikers; In 2015 U.I.C. reunited with the Robinson Brothers, Treibner, Preszcator, and Heywood and began releasing new music again with ‘The Wiseman Sessions’ in 2016. Dan Preszcator died March 29, 2018. The band would carry on with Andy Hauber on bass and Dave Dysart replacing Treibner for their follow-up ‘FM Hill’ in 2020 on their own label Like 90.

Their first gig was for the Cedarbrae’s Open House Variety Show where Bingham, Bell, Mayne, Read and drummer Martin Ranger sat in for Robin Boers who did not attend the school. They called themselves the Strolling Bones and performed The Stones’ “Time Is On Our Side” and Chuck Berry’s “Round and Round”. After getting kicked out of school for having long-hair, the band members relocated to Yorkville Village in late 1966. They became a driving force in getting the area noticed based on their Rolling Stones-inspired ‘bad boy’ reputation. In 1966 they released their first single, “Nothin'”, on the Yorkville label and followed that with several more singles concluding with the chart topping “Gaslight” in 1967. Written by Robert Hailey, a Yorkville Records staff member, the song went No.1 in Toronto and parts of eastern Canada. It was recorded in New York utilizing Doc Severinsen’s Tonight Show Band and without the benefit of all the band members present – only vocalist Dave Bingham appears. Read was the first to lave the band, in 1967, and was replaced by Howie Smith. In 1968 Yorkville Records released the band’s debut album, ‘Somewhere Outside’, and Mick Jagger proclaimed The Ugly Ducklings as “my favourite Canadian band”. However, the accolades were too little too late as they had already disbanded. In the late ’70’s, Roger Mayne would manage and produce some material for notorious Toronto punk act The Viletones. Inspired by punk’s new vitality, The Ugly Ducklings reunited in 1979 for a new album. 1980’s ‘Off The Wall’ led to plenty of press and a new revival for the band. A short batch of live dates followed – first with drummer Robin Boers (who managed only one gig before a previous lounge commitment called him away) and then with former Diode John Hamilton who got the gig after Viletones drummer Motor X recommended him to the band. In 1982 the band reformed again, this time with four original members Bingham, Mayne, Bell, Boers and with Ron Cameron on bass for a sweep of the Ontario club scene and promotion of a single, “War Babies”, on Razor Records. All this attention prompted ARC Records to re-issue the band’s material as a self-titled album featuring several previously unreleased tracks. After being out of print for decades, two companies reissued the band’s material on three CDs, all within a month of each other in 1998. Pacemaker was first out of the gate with ‘Too Much Too Soon’, which consisted of the first album plus a handful of singles, including “Gaslight”. In December 1998, Québec-based Unidisc put out two CDs simultaneously: a straight reissue of ‘Somewhere Outside’ and a revamped version of a previous, self-titled reissue which included material from the first album along with an alternate version of “Gaslight” and three later bonus tracks; Throughout the 1990’s Dave Bingham was an auto mechanic in Fenelon Falls, Ontario but has most recently been performing in pick-up acts and a reformed version of the Ugly Ducklings who performed at Yorkville Revival shows throughout southern Ontario in 1999; Roger Mayne died in 2004. with notes from Bob Read, John Mars, Rob Frost, John Hamilton, Len Platt, Stephen MacLeod, Sylvie Boucher, and Frank Watt\n\nSingles\n\n1966 Nothin’/I Can Tell (Yorktown) Y-45001\n\n1966 She Ain’t No Use To Me/10:30 Train (Yorktown) Y-45002\n\n1966 Just In Case You Wonder/That’s Just A Thought I Had In My Mind (Yorktown) Y-45003\n\n1967 Postman’s Fancy/Not For Long (Yorktown) Y-45005\n\n1967 Gaslight/Rimb Nugget (Yorkville) YV-45013\n\n1967 Epilogue/I Know What To Say (Yorkville) YV-45017\n\n1973 Gaslight/Rimb Nugget [re-issue] (Yorkville) YV-45070\n\n1980 Pain Is All Right/Just Another R & R Band (Razor) RS-002\n\n1982 War Babies (Razor)\n\n2009 Nothin’/I Can Tell [7”] (Sundazed) S-148\n\nAlbums\n\n1966 Somewhere Outside (Yorktown) YT-500-01\n\n1968 Somewhere Outside [re-issue] (Yorkville) YT-50001\n\n1980 Off The Wall (Razor) RAZ-003\n\n1982 The Ugly Ducklings (Yorktown/ARC) YT-50003\n\n1998 Too Much Too Soon (Pacemaker) PACE-021\n\n1999 Ducktales (Freeway) FRWY-001\n\n2002 S.N.A.F.U.

With a name change following the raise to fame of the Sex Pistols and its lead singer Johnny Rotten, The Ugly went about disrupting shows as much as playing them. They were self-proclaimed ‘hoodlum rockers’ and with Mike Nightmare’s onstage and club antics they were often banned from venues. Such activity led them to hi-jack shows by other Toronto bands – often waiting until one band left the stage in anticipation of another where The Ugly would jump onstage and begin performing before being kicked off. The band managed to play at the legendary ‘Last Pogo’ show in 1978; Koch and Ferrara would take turns in and out of The Viletones before Ferrara formed his own act Screamin’ Sam. In 1996 Other People’s Music issued a complete collection of their recordings on CD entitled ‘Disorder’ including 1977 sessions produced by legendary guitarist Chris Spedding. A split 7” single featuring two Ugly songs with Chris Spedding’s previously unreleased Sex Pistols demo of “Pretty Vacant” was released in 1997. Mike Nightmare died shortly after the release of the CD. In December 2007, original members Ferrara and Torture assembled a new version of The Ugly with Steve Koch (The Demics, Viletones) and Greg Dick (Dream Dates, Texas Dirt Fuckers) to perform three songs at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. The band still plays a few shows each year.\n\nSingles\n\n1978 Stranded In The Laneway (of Love)/To Have Some Fun (Explosion) ER-101\n\n1997 Disorder/You Bug Me//[split w/SEX PISTOLS] [7”] (Man’s Ruin/O.P.M.)\n\nAlbums\n\n1996 Disorder (O.P.M.)

Vancouver’s Bill Henderson was vocalist, guitarist and driving force for the Collectors and Chilliwack; Ulrich, originally from California, was a member of Pied Pumkin, the Hometown Band and an established solo performer; Roy Forbes aka BIM was also from British Columbia and had a sizeable solo career under his belt. In 1990 Forbes and Ulrich were asked to perform a one-off show with a third musician of the duo’s choosing by organizers of Vancouver’s annual Winter Roots Festival. Forbes immediately thought of Bill Henderson and after the show the trio realized that they’d had such a good time that they should pursue it further. The name UHF name and weighing the success of that first show, an album was crafted together utilizing the formidable talents of the three veteran songwriters. The CD was well received and the trio went off to do their solo works once more. In 1995, UHF reunited once everyone’s schedules had cleared and ‘UHF II’ was released with many accolades again. The act plans to continue re-converging whenever they are able.

The band relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1993. They were threatened with legal action by the brewing company that owned the name, and so the band changed their name to Red in 1997; Watt died September 18, 2019.

They released one EP on Quintessence Records and split up in 1981. Colin Griffiths and Andy Graffiti would go on to join Buddy Selfish & His Saviours with Ian Tiles, Nick Jones (ex-Pointed Sticks) and Bob Petterson; Graham, Wall and Wallace gave up music and became hugely successful conceptual artists.

She first appeared on Vancouver stages in 1973 after stints of backpacking around the U.S. and performing with her older brother and sister with the San Francisco Free Theatre. With Rick Scott and Joe Mock, Ulrich played violin, flute, sax and sang for the oddball trio The Pied Pumkin String Ensemble who managed to record two albums between 1974 and 1976. By the end of 1976 she was recruited for Valdy’s touring band which would evolve into the Hometown Band. They recorded two albums for A&M Records — ‘Flying’ and ‘Hometown Band’ and toured extensively in the U.S. and Canada and won a JUNO Award for ‘Best New Group’ before disbanding in 1979. Shari honoured her deal with A & M and teamed up with former Hometown Band-mate Clair Lawrence for two albums – ‘Long Nights’ (which got her a Juno nomination for ‘Most Promising Female Artist’) and ‘One Step Ahead’ which finally landed here a JUNO Award in 1981 for ‘Most Promising Female Artist’. Album three, ‘Talk Around Town’, was done the same way but this time in Los Angeles for MCA Records in the United States and resulted in another JUNO Award nomination. She continued on her songwriting course before diverting into TV as co-host of “Futurescan” with David Suzuki, and more recently, for five years running, writing and hosting BCTV’s award winning “Inside Trax”. She has also composed & produced several pieces for “Sesame Street” and the theme music for several television shows on CBC, Life, and The Knowledge Network. Following her fourth solo album, ‘Every Road’, the ‘Best Of Shari Ulrich’ was also released (which was a compilation of her first three albums). Ulrich continues performing both live and on television (occasionally accompanied by keyboard player Morry Stearns) and has collaboration with Roy Forbes and Bill Henderson in the acoustic trio UHF who have released 2 CDs thus far. Ulrich lives on Bowen Island, British Columbia, with husband, singer/songwriter David Graff and their daughter Julia. She serves on the boards of CARAS, the Pacific Music Industry Association and is a vice-president of The Songwriters’ Association of Canada. Ulrich reunited with her old Pied Pumkin mates twice – once in 1988 for the release of ‘The Lost Squash Tapes’ and in 1998 to release a retrospective album, ‘Plucking DeVine’ where the band did 20 live dates in Western Canada. The response from audiences was so overwhelming that the act will tour again in May and June of 1999.

Yard was in a band called The Mods when Robotham wrote songs for him back when they were 13. The Mods demoed their own songs and managed to get them in the hands of L.A. producer Dony Perry who, in turn, played them for future music empresario Mike Curb. Curb was very impressed with the quality of the demos and told Perry to follow through with a production deal. However, they were more interested in Yard and Robotham as songwriters, rather than the band itself. The duo was signed to a production deal, and a new entity called The Unforscene was created so that members of the Mods could still be involved. Perry would produce their first single in 1967, “These Are the Words” for his U.S.-based Momentum label in North America. It failed to chart in the U.S., but in Vancouver it spent three weeks on C-FUN’s C-Funtastic Fifty chart and reached No.1 on their All Canadian Top Ten list. The duo were working strictly in Los Angeles at that point. In fact, Robotham had written the B-side to Seattle band The Bumps’ Piccadilly Records single “Wake Up, Wake Up” called “Hey Girl.” The Unforscene’s second single, produced by Perry and Larry Brown, was “Little Toy” in the summer of 1967 on Mike Curb’s U.S.-based Sidewalk Records. It wouldn’t see a release in Canada. It, too, failed to chart stateside. Perry decided to bring in co-producer Bob Summers for the third single and heed the advice of Mike Curb who believed previous hit songs would always find a new audience. With that in mind the duo would record future Three Dog Night member Danny Hutton’s 1965 regional hit “Roses And Rainbows” for release on Sidewalk Records in early 1968. Three times was not the charm as the song also failed to connect with audiences – even a second time. The association with Perry and Curb soon ended, and The Unforscene returned to Canada. Licking their wounds, Yard and Robotham went to London Records – who had distributed their first single in Canada and released the single “Ball In The Country” under the name Nancy. Alas, it didn’t make any headway in Canada – and was even released on Decca in 1971 to no fanfare – and the duo called it a day; Robotham would turn to production work including an album by British Columbia artist Michael Cuccione which features his backing vocals on a song called “I Don’t Wanna Say Goodbye.” with additional notes from Michael Panontin; In 2015 Dan Yard was playing lead guitar in the Steve Mathieson Band and also stand-up bass with the Rusty Creek Boys. Yard also did production work for The Jape Dealers. He also hosted open mic nights in Surrey, BC. A post in May 2014, that has since disappeared from social media, stated that all four member of the Unforscene had reunited were recording new material. To date, nothing has materialized. with notes from Terry Robotham, Ray McGinnis, and Michael Panontin.\n\nSingles\n\n1967 These Are The Words/You And Me (Momentum/London) M-674\n\n1967 Little Toy/Happiness Is You (Sidewalk) 926\n\n1968 Roses And Rainbows/Wait Til Morning (Sidewalk) 937\n\nas NANCY\n\n1970 Ball In The Country/Hesitatin’ (London) M-17389\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2013 “Little Toy” on ‘Book A Trip 2: More Psych Pop Sounds Of Capitol Records (Now Sounds – UK) CRNOW-46\n\nas NANCY\n\n2012 “Ball In The Country” on ‘The Cool-Aid Benefit Album [2LP] (Regenerator) REGEN-1103LP\n\nUNGAVA\n\nAndré Devito (guitar) / Jacques Marois (percussion, vocals) / Richard Fortin (bass, vocals) / Martin Perron (keys) / Maurice Bouchard (saxophone, flute)\n\nMid-70s progressive rock act from Québec.\n\nAlbums\n\n1977 Ungava (Hwy 36) FH-36004\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2008 “Coyotte” on ‘L’Ultime rock progressif du Québec’ (Gala) GAL-113\n\nUNINTENDED, The\n\nRick White (vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, percussion) / Dallas Good (vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, organ) / Travis Good (vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar) / Sean Dean (bass) / Mike Belitsky (drums) / Greg Keelor (vocals, acoustic guitar)\n\nA one-off studio project recorded over six days in March 2003 featuring members of the Sadies and Greg Keelor (Blue Rodeo).\n\nAlbums\n\n2003 The Unintended (Bluefog) VOID002-2\n\nUNION\n\nRandy Bachman (guitar) / Fred Turner (guitar, vocals) / Frank Ludwig (keyboards, vocals) / Chris Leighton (drums)\n\nAfter two albums on Scotti Brothers as Ironhorse, Randy Bachman called up his old BTO and Brave Belt buddy Fred Turner to augment the existing three piece of Bachman, Leighton and Ludwig.

Looking for a new name for the group band member Anton Kolstee suggested the United Empire Loyalists. The band recorded in 1968 and produced the tracks for the 1969 independent single “No, No, No”. Another session in 1970 failed to satisfy the band and they split up shortly after. The United Empire Loyalists reunited in 1990 for a CBC TV special.

Their first release was the independent ‘Magic Basement’ album in 1993. As the duo toured and perfected their songwriting and live playing, they began to garner major attention, and were signed to Alert Records in 1994. The label re-issued the disc and the duo toured relentlessly until stopping to record their follow-up in 1995. The sophomore CD, ‘Earth Moon Transit’, was released in 1996 and they scored modest radio play with singles like “Just Before Mary Goes”, “Upfront With You”, “Any Road Back”, and “Make My Mind”. In 1999 a new album was recorded at Downsview, Ontario’s Iguana Sound using classic ’70’s analog recording technology. The self-titled album was released in 1999 through Buffalo-based 41 Records (home to fellow Canadian act Caramel) and spawned the single “I’m Better.” It was distributed in Canada by Oasis Entertainment but were soon embroiled in a bankruptcy with its imprint SongCorp. The album and the band were left in limbo. After lying low for several years they were signed to and released ‘Fearless’ in 2001. They continued releasing albums on 41 Records through 2004; Stanwyck has pursued some solo work since then and appeared on Warner Music’s ‘Women & Songs 10’ compilation; Universal Honey still performs and uses Darrin Pfeiffer (Goldfinger) on drums. They released a new 6-song EP called ‘Extended Play 2020’ during the pandemic featuring the single “Just Like You.” In 2023, they released a brand new full-length album ‘Dandelion’ on Current Records.

In 1993, their first album was released on Eureka Records. It was recorded at Aztec Studios in Stoney Creek, Ontario and Trackmaster Studios in Buffalo, New York with the help of Goo Goo Dolls bassist Robby Takac and engineer Mike Sak. The line-up for The Unloved was James Grant, Ward Fletcher, Chris Pasek, Tommy LaFrance and Art Green. The album, entitled ‘Unloved’, was distributed in the U.S. by BMG, in Canada by Capitol-EMI and in Germany by Bellaphon Records. Within a month of release The Unloved were enjoying airplay on more than 240 stations in the U.S. and Canada. The band continued to gig tirelessly in Canada and the U.S. After a successful appearance at Berlin Independence Days festival in Germany (one of only three Canadian bands invited to attend). When The Unloved returned to Canada they immediately found that their record label, Eureka, had lost distribution. They became a four-piece after the departure of Pasek. However, they were not discouraged. The Unloved took matters into their own hands by recording and releasing ‘Unglued’ on Flog 135 Records with distribution by Oar Fin in Minneapolis. They again received many favourable reviews and radio airplay. In 1997 they recruited Swyers to take over bass chores. The band took a hiatus from recording and would re-form occasionally over the next several years while the members pursued various activities on their own. They began to gig and write again in 2005. They’ve recently emerged from the legendary Chameleon West Recording Studio in Buffalo, New York (previously Trackmaster) with two new original songs to be part of a ‘best of’ package for 2007.

They swiftly made a name for themselves in southern Ontario and other parts of Canada with their popular independent single “You’re So Square”. They released an album, produced by Ross Munro, entitled ‘You’re So Square’ featuring mostly cover tunes by the likes of The Rolling Stones, Buddy Holly and Bob Dylan. There were also four original tunes including the ‘Ballad of Gilligan’s Isle’ played to the tune of Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway To Heaven”. After the album release they toured western Canada and appeared on the ‘Terry David Mulligan Show’. At the height of their popularity they were attracting a teeny-bopper and biker audience and still playing dives around the country. Realizing that the music industry was not going to offer them much else for the foreseeable future, the band split up in September 1980; Whiteside and Ridsdale would later go on to The Sci Phonics and both returned home to London, Ontario; Fletcher was playing with the Georgette Fry Blues Band; Years later, Uranus’ spoof the ‘The Ballad of Gilligan’s Isle’ became a staple on Q107 and CHUM-FM’s ‘Sunday Night Funnies’ radio programs. with notes from Keith Pettipas.\n\nSingles\n\n1980 You’re So Square/Secret Agent Man (‘Danger Man’ Theme) (Trilogy) TR-018\n\nAlbums\n\n1980 You’re So Square (Trilogy) TR-0500\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1986 “Ka Ka Ska” on ‘Wave From The Grave’ (What Wave) #1\n\n1996 “Shake Some Action” on ‘London Crawling’ (What Wave)\n\nURANUS AND THE UNIVERSE, Gordie\n\nGordon Innes / Steve Peacock / Andrew Dixon [aka Andy Terra] / Bob Webber / Barry Wanless\n\nShort-lived new wave act from Ottawa, Ontario featuring former Pat Travers’ Music Machine members Steve Peacock and Barry Wanless.

Their only album, ‘Timing’, was produced by Glen Johansen (Martha & The Muffins, Eddie Grant, Nash the Slash) and featured guest appearances by Stacy Heydon (guitar) and Sheriff/Frozen Ghost member Arnold Lanni (synthesizers). The single “You’re Not the One” was released and cracked the RPM Singles Top20 chart. Urgent toured for nearly a year promoting the album, but were dropped amongst an administrative re-shuffling at CBS Records; Kim Hunt joined Hanover Fist who were signed to MCA Records. But the label put the band on hold and so Hunt and Hanover Fist’s Chris Brockway recruited Urgent’s Doug Baynham to form Mach IV in 1985 who placed a song on that year’s Q107 Homegrown album. Hanover Fist fell apart and Mach IV eventually became a Foreigner tribute band Dirty White Boys; Hunt would go on to join a reformed version of Moxy in the late 1990s. with notes from Kim Hunt.

Nettwerk Records decided to release the album, entitled ‘Little Songs’, in 1998. Moist released one more album before imploding in 2001. Usher’s intention to go solo was solidified when EMI Records released his debut album, ‘Morning Orbit’, that year. The album spawned three singles. The album featured contributions by Jeff Martin (Tea Party), rap artist Snow, members of I, Mother Earth and Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip. Usher released his third album, ‘Hallucinations’, in 2003 before leaving EMI to sign with MapleMusic. He soon relocated his family to New York City and recorded the predominantly acoustic album ‘If God Had Curves’ in 2005. The record featured appearances by Tegan Quin (of Tegan & Sara) and Bruce Cockburn. He also released a DVD which highlighted the creative process in recording the album entitled ‘Walk. Don’t. Run’. Usher moved back to Canada with his family and set up shop in Montréal, Québec. His next studio album was entitled ‘Strange Birds’ (2007) followed by ‘Wake Up and Say Goodbye’ (2008).

After the band’s debut in St-Eusèbe, Québec, the band was christened Eusèbe-Jazz but later shortened to the more pronounceable UZEB. The band soon moved to Montreal in 1975. While there, Cusson recruited drummer Jean St-Jacques and bassist Alain Caron in 1978. Coutu would replace St-Jacques and Brochu, in turn, replaced him in 1980. A rotating roster of keyboard players also fluctuated in and out of the band for the next few years. The band was signed to the Paroles et Musique label in 1981. Their debut album was the live recording of their first European visit – ‘Uzeb live in/á Bracknell’ – at the Bracknell Jazz Festival in England that year. 1982’s ‘Fast Emotion’ won an ‘Album of the Year Award’ in 1983. Also in 1983, UZEB appeared at the Festival de Jazz de Paris and recorded at the Olympia in Paris (which would materialize as an album in 1986). In 1984 UZEB won a ‘Group of the Year’ at ADISQ’s Félix Awards for the success of their 1984 album ‘You Be Easy’. The record also won an award for ‘Group of the Year’. They would also win ‘Group of the year’ in 1986 and 1987 respectively. By 1987 UZEB had whittled their roster down to a trio again featuring Cusson, Caron, and Brochu. The band won another Félix Award for ‘Group of the Year’ in 1989 for their album ‘Noisy Nights’. UZEB frequently toured Europe to promote each of their albums and in 1990 toured Southeast Asia for the first time. The tour recordings were released later that year as ‘World Tour ’90’ on the Avant-Garde label. In 1991 UZEB received the Oscar Peterson ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ .\n\nSingles\n\n1988 Noisy Nights/I Believe It (Select) BCCL-5400\n\nAlbums\n\n1981 Uzeb live in/á Bracknell (Paroles et Musique) PEM-532\n\n1982 Fast Emotion (Paroles et Musique) PEM-010\n\n1984 You Be Easy (Paroles et Musique) WL-021\n\n1985 Between the Lines (Paroles et Musique) WL-027\n\n1986 Live à l’Olympia (Paroles et Musique) WL-035\n\n1988 Noisy Nights (Paroles et Musique) PEM-047\n\n1989 Club (Cream – FRANCE) 210\n\n1990 World Tour 90 (Avant-Garde) AGCD-602\n\n1991 Uzeb (25 Anniversarie)\n\n1992 L’integrale [7 CD] (Avant-Garde) AGCD-77\n\n1996 Entre ciel et terre (Cream – FRANCE) 392\n\n2000 Best of Uzeb (Norac) 902501\n\nwith UZEB AND DIDIER LOCKWOOD\n\n1986 Absolutely Live (JMS/ADES) JMS-039"
