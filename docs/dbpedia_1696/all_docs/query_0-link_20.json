        "text": "D.O.A.\n\nJoey Shithead formed The Skulls (a band that opened once for The Misfits) in 1977 with Chuck Biscuits' older brother Dimwit on drums. After The Skulls broke up, Joey decided to form D.O.A. and Chuck left his band Victorian Pork to join him. Their first show took place on 02/20/1978 at Japanese Hall in Vancouver. At this time, Chuck was thirteen years old. In the early years, Chuck's other brother, Bob Montgomery, served as the band's roadie. For about six weeks in early 1980, Chuck drummed for the Pointed Sticks, another Vancouver band. He also drummed at some point for another Vancouver band called The Subhumans (not the more popular British band). In 1982 when Chuck left to join Black Flag, Dimwit switched to drums, and Subhumans bassist Brian Goble joined D.O.A., at which point The Subhumans broke up. After leaving the band, Chuck also played drums on Randy Rampage's solo album.\n\n# Time Vocals/Guitar Bass Guitar Drums 1a 02//1978 - 01//1980 Joey Shithead Randy Rampage Chuck Biscuits 2 01//1980 - 03//1980 Joey Shithead Simon Wilde Dave Gregg Andy Graffitti 1b 03//1980 - 05//1980 Joey Shithead Randy Rampage Chuck Biscuits 3 05//1980 - 01//1982 Joey Shithead Randy Rampage Dave Gregg Chuck Biscuits 4 01//1982 - 07//1982 Joey Shithead Dimwit Dave Gregg Chuck Biscuits 5 1982 Joey Shithead Brian Goble Dave Gregg Dimwit\n\nDISCO SUCKS ----------- Sudden Death Records: 3907 May 1978 Sudden Death Records: 3907 May 1978 Quintessence Records: QEP 002 April 1979 Wrong Records 1992 Alternative Tentacles Records: Virus 133 1993 1 Disco Sucks | Nazi Training Camp 2 Royal Police | Woke Up Screaming Format: 7\" EP.
