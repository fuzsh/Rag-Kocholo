        "text": "author:\n\nArray\n\nRaja Ram & Quintessence’s Complete Island Recordings\n\nJust released are the remastered\n\nIsland recordings of Quintessence (Move Into The Light, Cherry Red Records\n\nunder their Esoteric imprint ECLEC 22584). Complete with a single and\n\nfull-length live track from the Bumpers\n\ncompilation, as well as original art-work and photos, this double CD box is a\n\nmost worthwhile addition highlighting the period that was the English\n\ncounter-culture’s heyday as the 60s turned a corner into the 70s. They were\n\nheady days indeed, in more senses than might first seem.\n\nIn West London’s Ladbroke Grove the music\n\nscene also saw Hawkwind, Pink Fairies, Skin Alley and Mighty Baby (who became\n\nSufi-inspired) among several others. On the same street was Marc Bolan when\n\nstill star-dazzled by the sky version (perhaps that’s why he never responded to\n\nthe band’s greetings?). Ron ‘Raja Ram’ Rothfield, interviewed here later,\n\nplaced an advert in March ’69 in Melody\n\nMaker—or was it a local rag, because the stipulations were living locally\n\nand being a “Hip musician”! The Australian-born flautist and chime-percussionist\n\nhad just moved from New York,\n\nwhere he’d had jazz training. Soon on board were Phil ‘Shiva’ Jones (vocals,\n\nkeys) a hit-maker with Australia’s equivalent of The Yardbirds, Allan Mostert\n\nfrom Mauritius (lead/acoustic guitars, vina), American Richard ‘Shambu’ Vaughan\n\n(bass), Yorkshireman Dave ‘Maha Dev’ Codling (rhythm guitar) a neighbour of\n\nPhil’s, and Jeremy ‘Jake’ Milton on drums, a Canadian not so interested in the\n\nreligious side (trained as a jazz drummer, he later had success in a punk jazz\n\nband with a relative).\n\nThey lived in Blenheim Crescent, scene today of the\n\nfamous Notting Hill Carnival, but weren’t jumping on a bandwagon like some and\n\nresisted for example the overtures of the Krishna Consciousness group: they\n\nwere living the broad local life-style after travelling the world. Their\n\nEastern names were bestowed by Swami Ambikananda, whose ecumenicalism was based\n\non Hinduism but embraced all universal faiths. Their ashram provided\n\nchoir-singing and Gopala (Codling’s brother-in-law) who created the stunning\n\nalbum covers that were the most costly in the label’s history. First manager\n\nStanley Barr contributed some of his poems as lyrics. The band name was coined\n\nby Raja Ram—in spite of having six members—who negotiated their first label\n\ncontract, which tripled Atlantic’s to Led Zeppelin, later in a neighbouring\n\nstudio during the recording of one of Quintessence’s albums.\n\nWithin weeks of starting rehearsals beneath\n\na local fish ‘n’ chip shop, the buzz got round. Reprise stalked them for 4\n\nweeks but baulked over artistic control. Chris Blackwell, owner of Island\n\nRecords, visited with Steve Winwood’s brother, Muff. Perhaps they’d heard the\n\nvibe about shows at the Arts Lab in central London’s Drury Lane followed by a packed house at\n\nthe Roundhouse. They were offered £5,000, van, equipment, and gigs with the\n\nNEMS Agency; the clincher was full artistic control including no-limit studio\n\ntime. The first producer, at Morgan Studios, was replaced early on by John\n\nBarham, a student of Ravi Shankar who worked on George Harrison’s Wonderwall and film All Things Must Pass, during the two-week sessions. His technical\n\nskill included structuring a couple of tracks, as the band were habitually\n\nimprovisation-led based on jazz, Eastern, and rock (sometimes blistering); pre-gig\n\nthey drew match-sticks for who’d lead some songs.\n\nIn November 1969 In Blissful Company appeared, with booklet and gate-fold cover\n\nillustrating their ethos and lifestyle. The opening chiming guitars of Giants,\n\nbased on the ancient pre-Anglo-Saxon legend, is a “surging, joyful bundle of\n\ntautly-contained energy and swaggering guitar interplay between Dave and Allan”\n\nreviewed Colin Harper, including backward-recorded overdub by Barham for a new\n\nmiddle-section. The swirling lead guitar including wah-wah solo and vocals were\n\na live staple and the first four songs reflect this. Chant has oboe and\n\ntambour, while the nine-minute closer ends with meditative ‘drone’ and ethereal\n\nvoice—actually several tambours played by Surya then slowed-down (also on the\n\nsecond LP’s High On Mount Kailish). In 1971-72 Surya used to open their\n\nconcerts with Indian music, as this writer saw at Euston’s Friends (Quakers)\n\nHouse. This LP is the seed for later styles in music generally such as\n\nelectronica, ambiance and drone.\n\nThey were then influenced by The Grateful\n\nDead, who wanted Quintessence on the bill for their UK debut in May 1970, and\n\nJim Morrison collected all their albums on import—ironically as they used to\n\ncover a couple of Doors’ songs in their first gigs. A leading journalist of the\n\ntime sparked interest when he said they were better live than The Doors. Bonus\n\ntracks here are the single Notting Hill Gate—a punchier re-recording complete\n\nwith lighting-up of a spliff—and its non-album B-side, Move Into The Light,\n\nmore manifesto statements than a serious chart attempt. Picture sleeves came\n\nout in Holland and Germany.\n\nTheir eponymous second album in split-front\n\ncover came out in July 1970, reaching #22 in the charts. Side one features one\n\nof the most acid guitar solos of the era (Sea\n\nOf Immortality; as does St.Pancras);\n\nthe only surviving full song from an abandoned opera about a journey from\n\nLadbroke Grove to India and Tibet\n\n(High On Mount Kailash); and their debut live recording (Burning Bush). The\n\nsecond CD continues with the original album’s second side: the haunting instrumental\n\nPrisms (with Arcadian-like flute and echo) leading into the restrained guitar\n\nsolos of Twilight Zones and Buddhist-like Infinitum, plus another live\n\nrecording (St.Pancras). The LP flows without breaks to re-create their gigs. Added\n\nis the Bumpers bonus of Jesus Buddha\n\nMoses Guaranga, recorded in a London\n\nTown Hall in March 1970\n\nalong with Burning Bush and St.Pancras, which has appeared on previous CDs but\n\nis here in superb re-mastered quality. The audience included Townshend and Moon\n\nin the sell-out, considerably expanded when filmed by BBC’s Disco Two programme.\n\nTheir final Island album Dive Deep (March ’71, #43) opens with\n\nthe title track, which is more in the jaunty post-Quintessence mode of Kala,\n\nfor an otherwise more meditative (“moody” in journo’s parlance) six-track outing,\n\nJohn Barham being involved this time with half of it. Shiva sees it today as\n\n“the beginning of the end”, referring to band tensions but not the quality of the\n\nentirely studio-based material, seeking to capture their live energy with the magical,\n\nnear-eleven minute Dance For The One. Sitar, tamboura, vina and shenai of The\n\nSeer, and Epitaph For Tomorrow climbs again to their trade-mark electrical crescendo,\n\nclosing with Sri Ram Chant to leave Island on\n\na high. The latter prefigures some of their later RCA output and concerts when opening\n\nwith an Eastern performance with friends, some of whom appear here.\n\nAccording to some sources Island\n\nstill have a few unreleased recordings dating back to November 1969, and two\n\nsongs redone for the first RCA release. There is in existence, I found, an\n\nApple Studio acetate of these. After the first two Glastonburys (the band did a\n\npartial re-union for their 40th anniversary festival), selling out\n\nthe Albert Hall in Dec.1971, major European festivals such as Kralingen, Swiss\n\nT.V. at Montreux, BBC and Euro T.V. and over two dozen features in the major\n\nmusic press, something odd happened when perspectives split. In the absence of\n\nhits, the one crucial market left was America. Island’s Chris Blackwell\n\nhad brokered a deal with Bell Records including opening at the Carnegie Hall,\n\nQuintessence offered an advance fee of £85,000 and Island £250,000. Raja Ram,\n\nJake and Allan thought it was an imbalance, Shiva and Maha Dev voted for it. In\n\nmid-1972 the latter two got a phone call that they were sacked, as was the\n\nband’s (second) manager and agency. By then Island\n\nand their press department had clearly lost interest.\n\nDid the band think they were bigger than the\n\nlabel, three meteoric years into their tenure, or just felt it was their due?\n\nThey soldiered on for most of the decade before winding-up, after venue owners\n\nwondered when the singer and guitarist would show up! I’ve elsewhere\n\ninterviewed Shiva, Maha Dev and Jake, so here’s a rare chat with founder Raja\n\nRam to join some dots of the record so to speak {the textual dots are his!}:\n\nYou\n\nformed Quintessence in Ladbroke Grove and had a great early break signing to Island, with full control, within weeks. What do you\n\nrecall from that exciting period?\n\nHi there, thanks for the\n\ninvite. Quintessence seems so long ago…I was living in Notting Hill in 68 (and\n\nstill in the same house after 50 years), it was the sixties, London was wild. I was earning my living as a\n\npainter, making enough to scrape by and have a wonderful time with my family.\n\nSo I put an ad in Melody Maker,\n\n“Wanted…Indian, Jazz, Rock band, musicians MUST live in the Grove.” 200 people\n\nturned up, and in a few weeks of madness got together 5 other like-minded\n\nsouls.\n\nSo we practiced in a basement\n\nin Portobello Road\n\nand went on to do our first gig, in 1969 at the Arts Lab run by Jim Haynes. We\n\ndid six shows there, on Fridays and Saturdays, with a strobe, two black lights\n\nand a 100 watt amp. We all took fudge and jammed [including] mantras we had\n\nlearnt. Shiva was a great singer, we just improvised and made up songs as we\n\nwent along…and the crowd loved it as we went on to bigger things.\n\nLike\n\nJake, you had a pre-Quintessence jazz background that is reflected in some of\n\nthe band’s styles, and played Montreux.\n\nAs far as jazz goes, I was in\n\nthe shadows of the giants, but a good experience. Oh yes, Montreux, we broke an\n\namp, the roady kicked me hard in the behind for some reason I never found\n\nout…and the lake was beautiful.\n\nNow\n\nthe Island recordings have been re-issued by\n\nCherry Red, do you have any memories of that early period?\n\nIsland Records were [based]\n\njust around the corner. Chris Blackwell was a visionary and he had all the\n\nkiller acts…we were down the list…but we made three albums there. It was fun\n\nrecording round the corner, and that was one of the first digital studios in\n\ntown.\n\nYou\n\nwere one of the very first bands to experiment with electronics, perhaps\n\nreflected in your later career?\n\nYes, we loved experimenting\n\nwith new sounds and electronics…You know we opened for the Floyd three times,\n\nand the Who and Zep…part of the process and initiation…those were the days.\n\nWould\n\nyou have changed anything from those albums if you could?\n\nNo, we gave it our best at the\n\ntime…take after take.\n\nYou\n\nwere considered one of the best live groups of the era, two hours plus without\n\na support act I recall. How do you compare the band live with that recorded in\n\nthe studio?\n\nStudio and Live are so\n\ndifferent. We did hundred of gigs, must have done, and I recall a few being\n\nreally good…most of the time. The sound wasn’t good in those days, in the\n\nstudio we had more control and I love recording… playing live always makes me\n\nnervous.\n\nDo\n\nyou think a successful single, as Hawkwind had, would have helped or changed\n\nthe last years?\n\nThe hits and stuff we missed\n\nout on…Hawkwind deserved them. We really were underground, loads of shows,\n\nevery venue and festival, Glastonbury, Albert\n\nHall, Norwich\n\nCathedral…big venues and big crowds but underground, weird, and we sold\n\nrecords. It was fun for the most part.\n\nI\n\nfound a Quintessence acetate with an Apple studio label, perhaps that label and\n\nGeorge Harrison were a potential target after Island\n\nvia John Barham?\n\nJohn Barham was a help, but he\n\ncouldn’t connect us with that world of the Beatles, we had to make our own way.\n\nAfter\n\nearly European headliners, a US\n\ntour fell through. What happened?\n\nI went to New York [later] with\n\nour drummer Jake to try to get a deal and met the ‘suits’ but they weren’t\n\ninterested in these Hippy freaks in India gear…It didn’t work, and I realised\n\nwith regret we could then never break the US scene…we had done the gigs and\n\nfive albums, it was time to quit. When I told the band they were pretty pissed\n\noff, it’s all over.\n\nThe\n\nsacking of the singer and guitarist was due to musical differences?\n\nYeah of course there were\n\nmusical differences. Shiv the singer liked to wag his finger, a preacher sort\n\nof force that fed the crowd. Allan was moody, head down in all that hair but a\n\nGREAT guitarist and he joined us when he was [only] 16.\n\nSoon\n\nafter Island you changed to RCA, who rather\n\nabsurdly put you first on their short-lived subsidiary Neon.\n\nYeah, moving to RCA was a\n\ngigantic mistake, but we had really bad cliché manager rip-offs. I was left\n\nwith a massive debt to pay off, which after 17 years was finally accounted for.\n\nHave\n\nyou ever considered a Quintessence reunion?\n\nAs far as a reunion, I would\n\nrather carry a sack load of bricks and walk up Everest in winter backwards. No.\n\nThe future is so bright we need three pairs of shades.\n\nWhat\n\nhas been your career since the late 70s split?\n\nSo it came to pass, the band\n\nwas folded. And for the next 8 years I left the music scene, even became an\n\nenvelope salesman…seriously…but that’s another story…In the 80s I bought a load\n\nof electronic stuff…prophets, sequencers, drum machines, then later in 1988 I\n\nmet Graham Wood to form The Infinity Project, making 50 tracks for TIP which\n\nbecame a label in 94. And my other parallel band, also on TIP, 1200 Micrograms,\n\nRiktam, Bansi and C-hicago, totally psychedelic live rock we play all around\n\nthe world at festivals, for example the OZORA fest in Hungary for an expected\n\ncrowd of more than 30,000 people there, so exciting times for this 76 year-old…\n\nYou\n\nare now renowned worldwide in psychedelic trance music, which developed from\n\nthe counter-culture of the late 1980s.\n\nI formed Shpongle with Simon\n\nPosford around 1994-95, and yesterday mastered the finished 6th\n\nalbum, CODEX6, out this summer full of surprises, 20 or so live shows with\n\nShpongle including Mt Fuji and Red Rocks in Colorada, Earthcore in Australia check\n\nit out…massive mind-blowing…So that’s what I am doing, and running TIP Records,\n\nhaving so much fun DJing around the planet…Brazil is absolutely insane with\n\nparties bigger and most times better, the Psychedelic Trance community is full\n\nof love and joy and optimism. What a life, love to you all there, Raj.\n\nMany\n\nthanks for your time and music, Raja, glad you have a groovy life!\n\n– Brian R. Banks\n\n© Copyright http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017"
