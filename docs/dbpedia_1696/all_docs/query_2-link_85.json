        "text": "After changing distributors, Secret Agent Records has re-released SOULKID #1‘s 2006 seminal pop album “Americanized“! It has been digitally redistributed and is once again available on Itunes, Amazon and streaming platforms.\n\nSOULKID #1 Americanized on Spotify!\n\nSOULKID #1 AMERICANIZED ITUNES\n\nThe album spawned the hit song ( …and hashtag!) “More Bounce In California” which has been featured in films “Legally Blonde 2”, “Win A Date With Tad Hamilton” and numerous TV shows including “The O.C.” and MTV’s “Laguna Beach”. SOULKID #1 even ended up in the Urban Dictionary!\n\nHere is a review of the album from when it was originally released. Taken from the publication Suite 101.\n\nSOULKID #1 AMERICANIZED CD\n\nOnce in a while, an album comes along that makes you glad to be a music lover, just through its sheer mix of cool and style. Americanized, from Los Angeles-based indie funksters Soulkid #1, is one such album. A heady mix of life-affirming soul and indie\n\nsensibilities, it’s a sublime end result of an album over five years in the making, and a testament to not only the song writing skills of protagonist Marc Godfrey, but also that the music industry still rewards determination and sheer non-stop belief.\n\nComing across like all the best bits of Marc Bolan, cult Scottish band Primal Scream and David Bowie amongst others, Soulkid #1 offer a refreshing slant to the indie scene, and the twelve tracks on this debut album reflect this. Opening with the instrumental title track itself, it’s a languine journey through distorted instruments and\n\nradio phonic vocals, all in one laid-back mix that recalls a humid summer’s day.\n\nThis is immediately followed by the blistering “Until It’s Gone…”, complete with Hammond organs and a time travelling feel that harks back to the best that ‘seventies music had to offer. Imagine the Black Crowes writing for T-Rex, and you’re halfway there. Vocalist and driving force behind the band, Godfrey is all slouch and almost\n\ninvites you to lie back and let the music take you to a place at once familiar yet new.\n\nFeel-Good Factor\n\n“It’s Your Lifestyle, Baby” continues the trend, with a pulsating bass line that stays in you even after the song has finished. Complete with female backing singers that gives the band its soul-like sound, it’s a glorious piece of funk and lo-fi guitars. Yet just when you think this is going to be the trend for the rest of the album, along comes something like “(More Bounce In) California”, with its tongue-in-cheek look at the way that Californians like to live life. So popular has this song become that it’s actually seen as the unofficial anthem for the famous state.\n\nThis feel-good factor is continued in the ultra-hip “Ghetto Fabulous”, an irresistibly catchy and infectious celebration of a song, with its dance floor bass line and hook-laden chorus. This is the beauty with Soulkid #1 and Americanized – it’s almost as if Godfrey finds it impossible to write a weak track.\n\nIf there is any part of the album that doesn’t quite stand up to the quality found elsewhere, it’s perhaps on “Two Of Us Against The World”, which sounds so similar to David Bowie’s “Heroes” that for a moment you feel you may be listening to the English singer’s seminal Changes album. It’s not that “Two Of Us Against The World” is a poor song; it just seems out of place on an otherwise impressive album.\n\nSome Kind Of Wonderful Future\n\nHowever, this is just a minor blip, as the anthemic “Some Kind Of Wonderful Drug” proves, with it’s double beat drumming and almost psychedelic guitar and keyboards running a kind of distorted race together. And it’s this kind of sound that Soulkid #1 excels at, and shows that there is still room in the industry for trying something\n\nnew.\n\nWith the songs of Soulkid #1 already garnering widespread acclaim before the album was even released – a prime example being “(More Bounce In) California”, which sold over 100,000 copies alone on digital download – and the record industry that initially ignored them now falling over themselves to lay down praise for Americanized, this is\n\nan album that deserves to be in everyone’s record collection.\n\n– Danny Brown, SUITE 101\n\nSOULKID #1 Americanized on Spotify!\n\nSOULKID #1 AMERICANIZED Credits\n\nMarc Godfrey – Lead Vocals, Guitars, Bass, Casio, Keys Joey Waronker – Drums Tommy Triant – Guitars Nic Jodoin – Guitar, Bass, Moogs, MPC 2000 Stefan Sigerson – Bass Ryan Yerdon – Drums Leslie Alejandro, Cassie Betts, Daye Rose, Penelope Fortier & Gina Anderson – Back Up Vocals Andy Kaulkin – Fender Rhodes Bernie Reilly – Viola, Piano Lenny Pops – Guitar, Back Up Vocals Mike Bulger – Horns Dave Lachance – Drums, Back Up Vocals Ed Maxwell – Bass\n\nTracks 3, 7, 8, 9, & 12 – Produced by Nic Jodoin Track 2 Produced by Josh Abraham & Nic Jodoin Tracks 1, 5 & 11 Produced by Walt Vincent Track 4 Produced by Nic Jodoin, Michael Patterson & Pete Mills Track 6 Produced by Nic Jodoin & Dave Lachance Track 10 Produced by Dave Norland\n\nMixed by Michael Patterson except Track 4 Mixed by Pete Mills Tracks 6, 8, 10 & 12 Mixed by Alexis Dufresne Assistant Engineer – Brian Grimble\n\nMastered by Brian “Big Bass” Gardner\n\nFront Cover Artwork by Marco Almera\n\nGraphic Design by Rick Royale\n\nJohn & Mary of the Modernettes. Photo by Alex Waterhouse-Hayward.\n\nAfter 84 years, Vancouver’s Railway Club finally closes it’s doors for good! There have been the usual eulogies in our local media bemoaning the loss of the venue in terms of “one less place for musicians to play”. I feel this misses the point and neglects to acknowledge the true function of the Railway Club. The Railway Club during it’s heyday in the 80’s and 90’s served as the social network for the Vancouver Music scene. What was going on in the back room was just as important as what was happening on stage. It was the heart of the Vancouver Music Scene located in the heart of the city. The Railway served as a meeting place and hang out, during the pre-internet years.\n\nBefore Mark Zuckerberg invented the internet, you had to carry around your “dick pics” in your wallet! And “wallets” were what you kept your money in before Paypal! Back then you delivered your “status” in person to a table full of friends over a pint of beer. Basically, if you wanted to be part of a social network, you were forced to go out and socialize. Bands were formed at the Railway and band members were fired there. Plots were hatched, gigs were planned and video treatments were written on the back of beer coasters! Before the internet transformed our social lives into something more illusory and actually anti-social.\n\nRailway Club table at the height of the 90’s. From Left; Mike Davies (The Enigmas), Karen Porter (Film Maker), Flash Action (Producer), Jim Cummins (Artist/Musician) and photographer Nicole Stef.\n\nThere are actually plenty of venues in Vancouver for bands to perform, more than enough to service the shrinking numbers of patrons actually interested in live music. Vancouver over the last 20 years has been suffering a Cultural Crisis due to it’s changing demographics and unbalanced economics. As baby boomers and Gen X’ers grow older, they disappear from the scene and traditionally their vacant bar stools would be re-occupied by the next generation… however Millennials have been disappearing too! Vancouver is now the worlds 2nd most unaffordable city! Year after year, we’ve been experiencing an exodus of young people, due to the combination of lack of opportunity and the insanely high cost of living. The side effect of all these people leaving is the irreversible decline in our Arts.\n\nThe Vampire Bats had their video release party for “Baby Libertine” at the Railway. The video was a duet between Marc and Pure’s Jordy Birch.\n\nVancouver lost 1,571 people between the ages of 20 and 30 in 2013, more than double the 700 that left the year before. Vancouver’s unrelenting unaffordability, doesn’t just disenfranchise youth attempting to make a start, it also shows no mercy to Business owners attempting to bolster our economy. The operating costs of running a small club like the Railway kept increasing over the years, while profits continued to slide. According to current owner Steve Silman, “Unfortunately, the long-term and persistent combination of relatively high expenses, in particular rent, as compared to business receipts has left the business unable to continue.”\n\nRent for the Railway had ballooned to around 17 000 a month.\n\nRailway Club gig poster, The ceiling train and who let Mark May into the back room?\n\nVancouver is only going to get worse for Culture (or lack of it!). Rents will continue to rise, Artists will continue to flee, businesses will continue to fail and our Politicians will continue to give breaks and support to those who least deserve it. Vancouver will probably be a pretty vapid and artless place in 10 years, honestly I can’t afford to stick around to see it! They say nostalgia is just another form of depression, but soon that may be all we have. So for the time being at least, Here is a look back at some highlights over the last 40 years. A definitive guide to remembering… RAILWAY CLUB CULTURE!\n\n1.THE NERVOUS FELLAS\n\nBefore the Punks started hanging there, it was a rock a billy gaff! Formed around the time of the 80’s rock a billy revival, The Nervous Fellas have been the cities most stubborn and best true rock a billy band. They’ve seen trends come and go, and they ignored them all! Fronted by Butch Murphy, the early line up also boasted Rockin’ Ron on the stand up bass. Now the band members can be found playing in dozens of off-shoot projects. They epitomize Railway Club rock n’ roll!\n\nButch Murphy and the Nervous Fellas in action!\n\n2. THE MODERNETTES\n\nJohn Armstrong, front man of the legendary Modernettes would often be found holding court in the back room of the Railway. By the 90’s he was a music writer for the Vancouver Sun which gave the paper some much needed credibility. Before that, The Modernettes played the Railway over 30 times and released the best album of the first wave of Vancouver Punk. “Teen City” is a true classic from start to finish, the song writing was more developed than many of their contemporaries. A track like “Confidential” was clearly light years ahead of D.O.A.‘s “Disco Sucks”. Of course, these days the band has more fans in Japan than they do at home! He also wrote a memoir about his time in the band and the early years of the Vancouver Punk scene, “Guilty Of Everything”. Read it, there’s a version available in Japanese.\n\nClassic vinyl that often goes for around 150 bucks on ebay! John Armstrong’s book.\n\n3. SHINDIG!\n\nBefore everybody had a recording studio on their laptop… you would have to pay big money and record in an actual studio! SHINDIG was an annual battle of the bands that gave away recording time as a contest prize. Established 30 years ago by College Radio station CITR and their often unreadable magazine, DISCORDER, Shindig has been located at the Railway Club for over 20 years now. Nobody who won ever went on to do anything in music… kinda like those TV contests like “American Idol”.\n\nDandi Wind performs at Shindig. Film maker and Spores front man, Danny Nowak.\n\n4. BRITT HAGARTY\n\nHey, with author John Armstrong as well as various writers for local publications spending quality time drinking their troubles away, we can make a claim that the Railway Club had a bit of a literary scene going on. Britt Hagarty was a talented but troubled writer who used to bring his album collection to the club to sell in order to raise money for heroin. In the mid-90’s, I bought some pretty cool records off him. He ended up dying tragically in a “hit and run” incident in 1999. Fortunately he managed to write one of the great rock n’ roll biographies before that. “The Day The World Turned Blue” on singer Gene Vincent is a must read book for fans of early rock n’ roll. The Railway was the book’s true muse.\n\nBritt mid-eighties. The 1st edition of Gene Vincent biography.\n\n5. NO FUN XMAS\n\nOne thing that was consistent during Railway’s 89 year existence was No Fun‘s Xmas show! NO FUN are a duo that consists of David M. and Paul L. and they dubbed themselves “the Beatles of Surrey”… which would probably be confusing to people from Britain. Every year they would bring their Xmas show to the Club and hand out “Gorgo” to needy children. Feed the world!\n\nRailway Gals! Nicole and Coco mid-nineties. No Fun Xmas.\n\n6. THE SCRAMBLERS\n\nThe Scramblers were the perfect Railway Club Frankenstein’s monster. They band members consisted of veteran’s of the rock a billy and Punk scenes, coming together to create a hybrid of those two genres. The Scramblers rose to the top of the local club scene in the late 80’s, early 90’s and came close to breaking out when they signed to Penta Records. Sadly, Penta Records ended up being a tax write off for Bruce Allen and their debut album was shelved. Lead singer, Howard Rix passed away last year. He probably played the Railway more times than anybody else, hosting Blues jams and fronting much loved groups like the Stinging Hornets and G.I. Blues. Howard was truly one of the more unforgettable voices in Vancouver rock.\n\nHoward Rix. The Scramblers posthumous release.\n\n7. The Spiritual Home To The Stand Up Bass!\n\nActually, The Railway was the literal home to the stand up bass. Now where are these bands gonna go? The Roxy?\n\nBrandy Bones of the Big John Bates band!\n\n8. K.D. LANG\n\nWithout at least one success story… a music scene seems a bit pointless. Well we had one! And she started at the Railway! When young K.D. first moved here from Consort, Alberta (Population 407) her first shows were at the Railway. This became a never ending talking point. “Hey did you know K.D. Lang got her start here?” has been a sentence muttered by unimaginative conversationalists for 40 years now.\n\nK.D. before she lost the glasses. Did you know that Rich Hope got his start playing the Railway Club?\n\n9. RAY CONDO FOREVER!\n\nBy the 90’s the undisputed King of Western Swing called Vancouver his home! Ray was a true denizen of the Railway Club. He was prolific in recording and touring his music all around North America but never became more than a cult success before his tragic death in 2004. Artist 12 Midnite‘s neon tribute to Ray hung at the Railway. Besides being a real nice cat, Ray Condo‘s music was the real deal!\n\nNeon Artwork by 12 Midnite. Ray Condo.\n\nTune in to CFRO 100.5 FM Weds April 20th for RADIO BANDCOUVER’s special Railway Club Episode! 3:30 – 5:00 pm.\n\nSometime during the tranquil 1970’s, Punk Rock came crashing to earth like a cultural meteorite intent on wiping out all the dinosaurs. Punk wasn’t simply another musical movement, it aspired to influence fashion, politics, literature and art. The Sex Pistols revolutionary, “Never Mind The Bollocks” with it’s now classic Jamie Reid designed cover signaled a drastic change to the 70’s rock aesthetic and ushered in a whole new era of graphic design. In less than one year after the Sex Pistols album was released, half a world away in the sleepy cultural backwater of Vancouver, Canada, the Pointed Sticks issued their first 7 inch single, “What Do You Want Me To do?” on fledgling local label Quintessence Records. The 45 single was issued with 5 different D.I.Y. coloured sleeves and the b-side was “Somebody’s Mom”. It was the first ever “production” by a young Bob Rock and it is now a highly sought after collectors item amongst the “Killed by Death” crowd.\n\nPointed Sticks were part of a new wave of West Coast Punk bands that included, The Modernettes, D.O.A., Art Bergmann‘s Young Canadians and The Subhumans, who all released classic albums between 1978 – 1983, albums that were essentially banned from the airwaves by the corporate rock establishment! Despite being shut out of the mainstream, the late 70’s and early 80’s saw an explosion of music released into the underground scene. This was the period that gave birth to the “independent” record label. Alongside the new wave of musical groups came a new wave of graphic designers and artists. Album covers became deliberately loud and colourful to get people’s attention and for the first time in music history, small labels sought to seriously compete with the majors.\n\nOut of London’s mid-seventies “Pub Rock” scene, came Stiff Records. Stiff Records brought the world, the first official punk release (The Damned‘s debut) as well as Elvis Costello, Lene Lovich and Nick Lowe, all in an array of eye catching creative packaging courtesy of their legendary in-house graphics designer, Barney Bubbles. Thanks to small labels like Stiff, picture sleeves and picture discs flooded into the New Wave music market, which upset the majors, because they cost more to produce and reduced their profits!\n\nFittingly, The Pointed Sticks became the first Canadian band to sign to Stiff Records. Stiff released the Brinsley Schwartz produced “Out Of Luck” 7 inch in 1979, but due to the chaotic business practices of the label, the band’s debut was shelved after an aborted session with The Police’s producer, Nigel Grey. Disillusioned, the Pointed Sticks broke up in 1981 after releasing their now seminal power pop debut, “Perfect Youth“. The album cover, as well as the inner sleeve and label, was designed by legendary pop artist Jim “I Braineater” Cummins. Just as the Pointed Sticks had given Bob Rock his start, “Perfect Youth” was Jim Cummins first rock album commission, he went on to create iconic cover art for PURE‘s debut “Pureafunalia” and Skinny Puppys “Too Dark To Park”.\n\nPERFECT YOUTH LP 1980 Quintessence Records\n\n“I remember before I could get the album art finished, we had a Braineaters gig in Edmonton! So the band drove up without me. I flew in the day of the gig and flew back the next morning, finished the album cover and handed it in on Monday just in time for the deadline! The amount I got paid for the album was eaten up by the plane ticket. So I got to play the gig in Edmonton, finished the album artwork and wound up broke. Very rock n roll…” – Jim Cummins\n\n“It just seemed so perfect at the time (no pun intended) for us to have a Jim Cummins cover! Of course, he worked some considerable self promotion into the image as well! The colours are brighter on the original 4′ X 4′ oil painting, which hangs in our ex-managers house, much to my chagrin… I wish it was mine. It was a pretty iconic cover for us. Most people think that the girl on the front is Nancy Gillespie, a scenester from back then, but Jim says its a composite of all the Pointed Sticks girls from that time. And there were lots, we were truly a girls band…” – Nick Jones\n\n“The girl and man are made up. The creature she is drawing is something (…and I do mean something!) that we saw in a alley in the west end. Sandra and I, were going to her place and there it was, it looked at us! We kept driving in shock. We got home and locked all the doors and windows at her place. A couple of weeks later I started the album cover. I had about two weeks to get it done… and I can still see that creature to this day.” – Jim Cummins\n\nThe Real Thing 7″ Single 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“The Real Thing…. Our manager, Steve Macklam came up with that image. The Chinese characters ask the question “Who have you been fucking on the railroad tracks?” The answer of course being Pointed Sticks…” – Nick Jones\n\nReal Thing/Out Of Luck 7″ (Back Cover) 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“Out Of Luck photo by Ron Nelson of Private School.I can’t really remember why we chose this shot, just seemed cool at the time, Gratuitous crotch shot of Tony Bardach.” – Nick Jones\n\nLies 7″ 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“I think we swiped that picture from some comic book…. Quintessence always gave us free reign on any artwork we wanted to use! We had this old drum skin that Ian Tiles found, and loved. I think it was from a Sears catalog drum kit, probably early sixties? That’s the image that was on the bass drum skin.This dates back to the very first weeks of the band, when we were practicing in an old warehouse next to the Sun building. $125 per month for the entire floor, and it had a freight elevator!” – Nick Jones\n\nLies/I’m Numb 7″ (Back Cover) 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“Sheila Adams, a friend of John Mackies did that drawing. We wanted something kind of 1950’s cool/Joan Miro looking. I think she pulled it off.” – Nick Jones\n\nOut Of Luck 7″ 1979 Stiff Records (BUY59)\n\n“Ah, the old slab of meat image! First time we saw that was when we held the finished record in our hands. There was no emailing graphics for approval back then! Blame Stiff entirely for what was undoubtably the worst graphic in the Pointed Sticks cannon. It’s a terrible photo as well… The shoot was done in Vancouver with a guy called John Sherlock, and the only consolation is that there are far worse shots from that session.” – Nick Jones\n\nPower Pop Santa 7″ 2012 La Ti Da Records\n\n“The “Power Pop Santa” single was recorded as a free download in 2008, La-Ti-Da put it out as a giveaway for the Fall Down, Get Down festival in 2012, which was meant to be our last gig. Not sure why we ever said anything that stupid, except for the fact that we were going through a rough patch at the time. I’m very proud of both sides of that single, its not easy to write an Xmas song! The graphics are all La-Ti-Da… something about “continuity with their brand”?? BTW, that single is completely sold out, and won’ t be reprinted!” – Nick Jones\n\nMy Japanese Fan 7″ 2009 Sudden Death Records\n\n“A Richard Chapman/Ian Tiles collaboration. The whole airmail envelope concept is great, the original Japanese version of the cover is amazing, before the Sudden Death art department got a hold of it and “cleaned it up”. Jeez, it looked that way for a reason!! The song itself was the first original song that the reformed band wrote. It was Gord Nicholl’s idea, inspired by the ridiculous response we got when we first played there, and everyone from the band has at least one line in the lyrics. Nice double entendre as well. Plus the song starts with the chorus, oldest trick in the book. After we had played in Japan, we had realized pretty quickly that playing 25 year old songs was fun, but incapable of sustaining our long term interest. So we wrote that one, and now its 2015 and we’ve put out 2 LPs and 2 singles of new original music.” – Nick Jones\n\nThree Lefts Make A Right LP 2009 Northern Electric\n\n“By this point, Richard Chapman was in control of all the graphics for all things Pointed Sticks. The saying was mine, based on an old North Van story, too long to tell, but if you sketch it out, it is indeed true that 3 lefts do make a right. Obviously a play on “2 wrongs don’t make a right”…. I wanted the cover to look like the original Rueben and the Jets LP, colour and lettering wise, and for it to be a cartoon. The boxing gloves were Richards idea. Again, I love this cover.” – Nick Jones\n\nThe Stiff Sessions CD 2008 Japan\n\n” Its our friend Bernadettes dog Odin. Its actually a re-enactment of what could have been a very unfortunate scene. When we came back from the UK (1980) after making that record, and ultimately having it rejected, we were all at a party at Steve Macklams house one night. He had a cassette dub of the recordings, and Phil Smith decided that he needed to make a copy of it for himself, on the spot. So he made a dub using Macklams double deck (remember those?) and took it home with him when the party was over. The next morning when the Macklams arose, their dog Elvis had taken that specific original cassette and strewn it from one end of the house to another, chewing it to pieces while doing so. The copy Phil made was/is as far as I know, the only one left in existence of those recordings, and what we used to master the CD. So, that music came within hours of being lost forever, and thats what the cover illustrates.” – Nick Jones\n\nThe POINTED STICKS will be performing Saturday Nov. 28th 2015…\n\nPOINTED STICKS – VAMPIRE BATS – POLLY – NERVOUS TALK at THE RICKSHAW!\n\nPOINTED STICKS – VAMPIRE BATS – POLLY – NERVOUS TALK at THE RICKSHAW!"
