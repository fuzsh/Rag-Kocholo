        "text": "08-28-2023 VERSION 2.3d\n\nThis is a list of popular quadraphonic recordings on vinyl, cassette, 8-track and reel to reel. Popular recordings include music from all countries and include rock, jazz, easy listening, polka, avant-garde & country. This is not a complete list. Information about quadraphonic recordings that are not listed here or corrections to list are greatly appreciated and encouraged. Country of origin has been listed to help in the search of a recording. Catalog numbers apply only to the country of origin. However, it should not be assumed the recording was only available in that country. This \"popular\" list does not include Classical, Popular Asian Market Recordings, Movie Soundtracks & Original Cast, Anthology-Sampler-Test-Sound Effects and Radio Broadcasts as those categories have their own discography's. For titles that were issued a catalog number or a test pressing was made but were not released to the public, refer to the NEVER ISSUED discography. For titles that were thought to be quad but have been determined NOT to be quad, refer to the Released Recordings that are NOT Quad discography. For titles that are rumored to exist, refer to the RUMORS discography.\n\nFor additions to this list, Please include:\n\n1. Artist 2. Title of album 3. Record label 4. Catalog number 5. Quadraphonic format (QS, SQ, CD4, UMX) 6. Format - LP (vinyl), Q8 (Quad 8-track), QR (Quad Reel to Reel) since catalog numbers change w/format 7.
