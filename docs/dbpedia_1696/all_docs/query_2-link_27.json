        "text": "author:\n\nArray\n\nQuintessence: Spirits From Another Time 1969-1971 (2016) review\n\nDOUBLE VISION AND WHO DREAMED\n\nUP THE T.V. TITLE OGWT\n\nQuintessence:\n\nSpirits From Another Time 1969-1971 (Hux Records, May 2016)\n\nThis album is Hux Records’ 150th release and also their most ambitious project by far.\n\nA Jewish flautist from Australia, jazz trained\n\nin New York, arrived in west London’s Ladbroke Grove and placed an ad for\n\nmusicians in Melody Maker in March\n\n1969. The result, a multi-cultural band added to Ron Raja Ram Rothfield:\n\nvocalist Phil ‘Shiva’ Jones (Australian of British ancestry) from a hit band\n\nJimmy Page saw down under, Jeremy ‘Jake’ Milton (drums) born in England (to Canadian\n\nparents) who grew up in West Africa, Richard ‘Shambhu’ Vaughan (bass) from\n\nAmerica, 16 year-old Allan Mostert (lead guitar) from Mauritius, and art\n\nteacher Dave ‘Maha Dev’ Codling (rhythm guitar) from Leeds. Sixteen weeks later,\n\nChris Blackwell of Island Records visited their rehearsal in a basement of a Notting\n\nHill fish ‘n’ chip shop. At 2am he doubled Warners’ offer, with full artistic\n\ncontrol including album sleeves and unlimited studio time, to sign them.\n\nIn\n\nAugust the cosmic surfers were recording their debut album issued in November\n\nand touring Europe the next month. Their Euro film debut saw Montreux’s\n\nprogramme enthuse: ‘One of the best bands in Europe. Individually they sparkle,\n\ncollectively they shine…When the year has ended Quintessence will be one of the\n\nbiggest bands in the world’. Heady stuff even for those days, and the music\n\nfitted perfectly.\n\nQuintessence (‘the fifth substance of the four elements latent in all\n\nthings’) didn’t need the BBC because their live reputation catapulted them\n\nchart-ways before Progressive or New Age had even been coined. As Chris Welch\n\nput it at the time, to a stunned public, the mighty Quins were better live than\n\nthe Doors. Band and listeners felt the albums were restrained compared to the\n\nconcerts, but this new release of studio tapes captures their energy that\n\nresulted in a renowned symbiotic jamming style live. Verse, chorus, middle\n\neight, verse for three minutes—no way, this is propulsion, as adventurous as\n\nany. As we hear, ‘We can’t use that start again, just let us blow!’ Jake\n\nrecalls that, although in the best of the time, the studios weren’t geared for\n\nlive recording: so rhythm tracks first then solos and vocals after, ‘never\n\nquite the essence of the band’ he regrets. Pre-gig, matchsticks decided who\n\nwould write the set-list. Alan and Jake usually decided the opening mode or\n\nscale and preferred an unnumbered set-list, ‘unlike one or two others’. Jake says\n\nthe freer style wasn’t a problem, as he and Ram came from jazz backgrounds that\n\nshaped their approach along with listening to Indian music like Pannalal Ghosh,\n\nColtrane or a bit later the Grateful Dead (Dark Star was a big influence for\n\nJake and Alan) played in the tour wagon.\n\nMostert’s\n\nrange from spiralling acid (but always controlled) to bird-of-paradise-like solos,\n\nMaha Dev’s pumping rhythm guitar sometimes as twin lead, the heavy bass\n\n(remastering shows its power) allied to fluid drumming augmented with hand-percussion\n\nand flute, highlights a leading band at their zenith. (Jim Morrison bought all\n\ntheir albums on import.) Jazz and blues tropes, driving rock, psych, meditation,\n\npioneer electronica, drone, almost choir-like harmonies, audience participation\n\nthat was meaningful not moronic pap—and all that could be in one song! The idea\n\nwas to replicate a sound of mesmerising intoxication as identification (not\n\nprojection) with the audience who participated sometimes with their own\n\ninstruments. A celebration unifying mind and body that was spiritual and at\n\ntimes celestial, as one reviewer noted. (Association with George Harrison’s\n\nRadha Krishna Temple was a myth; like their Swami the band were ecumenical,\n\nsharing variant paths; he also advised against drugs). This is bliss music as\n\nit should be: vibrant soul-energy, essence, a thanksgiving free and\n\nunadulterated.\n\nDisc\n\none opens with their famous single, Notting Hill Gate—was it only export\n\npicture-sleeve copies that started with the spliff lighting intro?—but in its\n\nfirst-time full, unfaded-out state with a more tripped-out vocal and sitar by a\n\nguest before the guitarist took it up himself. Island’s studio was in the heart\n\nof where the band lived, London’s bohemian centre. A rehearsal nearby at All\n\nSaints Church (site of Hawkwind’s first gig) featured in a counter-culture\n\ndocumentary. No better statement of time, place and band: for this is a trip\n\nnot only in music but also time dimensions.\n\nBrahman, which would be on their third album Dive Deep (March 1971 reaching number 43), is here a fourth take of\n\nan often-worked song with a middle jazzy riff written by Shiva and different\n\nguitar solo. One of the joys of this release is Allan Mostert’s extended solos\n\nthat were a live delight but rarely on recordings (we now see due to vinyl’s space\n\nlimitations). His acid- swirler building to a head-topping crescendo on Sea Of\n\nImmortality (oddly absent from Island’s compilation Oceans Of Bliss in the 90s) is one of the greatest of the period\n\nand here unabridged: this release features two more classic versions of the\n\n‘celestial wine filling you with divinity’. Musical breadth also permeates two seven-minute\n\nplus takes of Only Love (Can Save Us), first heard with added live material on\n\nthe second eponymous album which in June 1970 reached their highest charting of\n\n22 during 4 weeks. This is another testament to their meteoric rise in spite of\n\nnever appearing on John Peel’s show and only one In Concert recording, in November 1970.\n\nMany\n\nof their best songs here include an even more epic (longer than on the third\n\nLP) Epitaph For Tomorrow. Twin guitars are more to the fore, as is the bass, with\n\nmore fiery solo over a driving rhythm including a rare glimpse of Shiva’s\n\nHammond playing. His favourite track from the debut album (In Blissful Company 1969), Body, has here been wonderfully salvaged\n\nfrom the March 1970 St. Pancras concert that featured on a previous Hux\n\nrelease. Thumping bass, soaring flute and a cloud-bursting solo with wah-wah\n\nends because the tape ended, as the compere explains. Timeless time-travelling.\n\nA\n\ncouple of unfinished snippets include a baroque harpsichord piece (for an\n\naborted opera, as was High On Mount Kailash) and Hari Om chant introed by Mostert’s improvisation. This chant briefly appeared faded on the fourth album Self (RCA in May 1972 with one side live\n\nat Exeter University, reached 50 but oddly in the chart for just one week) but\n\nhere has multiple backward percussion melded with funk guitar. Also unreleased\n\non disc two is Tree Of Life by a four-piece and a rare vocal from Dave Codling,\n\nreminding a little of Kala (Shiva’s and Dave’s post-Quins band) or Pearl And\n\nBird by Mostert on the debut platter. Self\n\nreappears with Codling’s You Never Stay The Same (retitled Vishnu Narain on\n\nthat later fourth album and same take as a single b-side), this time with\n\nvocals by the guitarist and backing (ashram?) singers. Colin Harper speculates\n\nthat Self on RCA has smuggled-out\n\nIsland tapes; the label has no multi-tracks of the LP in their archive but does\n\nhave a complete set for the follow-up Indweller\n\n(RCA 1973). Cosmic Surfer b/w Wonders\n\nOf The Universe actually exists as an Apple Corps Ltd green/white labelled\n\nacetate, so perhaps George Harrison was approached by the band’s management?\n\nThe\n\nsecond version of Only Love is a great find—an outtake possibly eclipsing the\n\nclassic album track!—with chugging second guitar, hypnotic vocal, Raja Ram’s\n\nflute and bells and another high-inducing lead solo brilliantly underpinned by\n\nthe drummer. The 1970 album track was tape-spliced together by producer John\n\nBarham, who worked with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Radha Krishna Temple and\n\nmost of the Apple roster including Lennon’s Imagine,\n\nKala, and films by Jodorowsky and Preminger. Marwa, later on his solo album Jugalbandi (Elektra 1973), is based on a\n\nsix-note Indian raga, but here uses harps, piano, cello, flute and tablas with\n\na dreamy vocal recalling Vedanta story songs.\n\nA new\n\nmix of Wonders Of The Universe later used the next year on Self appears, and Maha Mantra (90 seconds on the second LP) is here\n\nin its full six-minute version with the band’s Swami-Ji (Swami Ambikananda\n\n1934-97) and ashram singers who at one time featured Lene Lovich of later punk\n\nfame. This evocative chant kirtan (on Youtube from a BBC schools documentary\n\nfilm) shows the spontaneous and indeed joyous empathy. Also unreleased is\n\nSunlit Kitchens, featuring the band’s poet-lyricist and first manager Stanley\n\nBarr reading over a mantra. Shiva requested this and Hari Om to be included:\n\nhis kindred album with Ralph ‘Rudra’ Beauvert, who runs the excellent band\n\nwebsite in Switzerland, is highly recommended (Eclectic Records, 2005).\n\nTwilight Zones reappears from the second album, but instead of a meditative\n\nmellower is here delivered as a Hendrix-style trio, fuzz bass and all! The\n\ncloser, Move Into The Light, was the never-played-live B-side to the Notting\n\nHill Gate more fuzz-laden single of January 1970, here reprised (in take 13)\n\nwith Simon Lanzon (later of Donovan’s band and Chumbawamba) guesting on keys\n\nand new Shiva double vocal (baritone to falsetto perfectly pitched) added to\n\nthe voiceless surviving take with a percussion jamboree longer than the\n\ntrack-time. Three tracks have added new parts by Shiva or Dave Codling. Shambhu,\n\nwho wrote Ganga Mai, sums up the experience: ‘Certainly our music has been an\n\neducation and joy to us, and if it can be a joy to other people then its\n\ncool’.\n\nDigitised to high quality resonance at Abbey Road Studios by Cormac\n\nO’Kane, his booklet insights alongside Colin Harper’s technical notes to each\n\nsong (not in track sequence, a minor gripe) with Shiva’s and Dave’s input, will\n\ndelight aficionados. Thanks to Hux, thirty reels of thirty-minute tapes were found\n\nthat also had a Mott the Hoople track and one by an unknown singer (when\n\ndelivered by Universal, one was missing and six not approved for licence)\n\nrevealing an incredible labour of love as the label’s ‘most ambitious project\n\nby far’ marking their 150th release. Not only has the label released\n\ntwo same-period live CDs of the band (one has already sold out) but also the Rebirth anniversary gig at the 40th\n\nGlastonbury Festival and all extant recordings of the follow-up Kala.\n\nSuch\n\nlabels as Hux, Angel Air, Cherry Red and Talking Elephant are like life-blood\n\nfor music lovers of bygone periods. For current (future?) music you can pledge for\n\na buffed strat signed on one string, a stuffed stiff stoat with the stuffing\n\nstuffed back in (hole signed), a pair of shoes (worn), a signed saucepan lid\n\n(not a kid), meet and cheat, limited edition bedpan (cracked) with certificate\n\n(signed, cracked) etc. Maybe if existed back then in an age when ticket agency sharks\n\nhadn’t yet replaced touts, you might have got a joint (not roast), commune\n\ninvite, access for nirvana (a realm, not band), but no, the music world like\n\nlife was different and all the better for it. Such things weren’t even seen on\n\nthe future horizon where earth-like Trappist One located in the constellation\n\nof Aquarius. This release from another time-zone seems in another part of the\n\nuniverse too.\n\nIt is\n\nnot too extravagant to say that when Quintessence split so did an era. First\n\nBarham left, Gopala went from cover designer to Shiva’s roadie, then Raja Ram (or\n\nthe band depending on the version told) sacked Shiva and Maha Dev after a\n\nhighly publicised UK tour of cathedrals (the BBC televised one), twice\n\nselling-out the Royal Albert Hall, Hyde Park with Soft Machine, an 18-date tour\n\nof Europe and label move to RCA (Ram declined Blackwell’s brokered deal with\n\nBell that scuppered a first US tour). One of the craziest decisions in rock\n\nhistory, although there was individual tension over musical policy before the\n\n‘rump’ band fizzled out around 1980. At their height they twice appeared on the\n\nforerunner of OGWT, a documentary (New\n\nHorizons), the Glastonbury and Kralingen (Holland) Festival films,\n\nMontreux, and in over 20 leading music paper interviews in three years. As\n\nColin Harper rightly notes, without their charismatic vocalist and one of the circuit’s\n\nleading guitarists, it was like Free without Rodgers and Kossoff or Jethro Tull\n\nwithout Anderson. Not the same appeal or success.\n\nThere\n\nis a surprising footnote to the band’s studio life. A BBC producer Peter Carr\n\nsays Jake Milton coined the title of the famous late-night music series The Old\n\nGrey Whistle Test, after a Soho studio desk guard who’d whistle tunes he liked\n\nduring the night sessions when the band left in the morning. Jake’s\n\nthen-girlfriend, Gloria Wood, was a BBC music researcher at the time and she\n\ntold this story to a DJ. Jake confirms, though ‘most people are unaware of the\n\ndig at the music biz implicit in the title’! He was a much-in-demand session\n\nmusician (e.g. Syd Barrett at Abbey Road) and for gigs, from Mick Wayne\n\n(Junior’s Eyes that became Bowie’s band for Space\n\nOddity 1969), The Glands with Eric Clapton in the autumn of ’65 (they\n\nplayed Greece which they drove to in a Ford Galaxy), and the house band (with\n\nGordon Edwards of The Pretty Things) at the Arts Lab, where Quintessence was\n\nlater filmed and Allan blew the amps. He went onto indie success including US\n\ntours with his brother Ted in Blurt (on Factory Records etc); a rave review in NME says they blew Joy Division\n\noff-stage, and were compared to Beefheart and Tom Waits.\n\nRaja\n\nRam flamboyantly stormed the early psy-trance music scene (which like Steve\n\nHillage he still continues) in Shpongle. He also made many films of Quintessence,\n\nrecalls Jake, still unseen in the public domain. Mostert started Blissticket\n\nand his Inside World appeared on\n\nBurning Shed in 2003. Living in Spain, he performs award-winning fusion music\n\nacross Europe with his wife. Shiva as a sound therapist and inner faith\n\nminister tours the USA with his healing and meditation workshops involving the\n\ndidgeridoo as an aid to breathing exercises. He still performs at Australia’s\n\nmost prestigious big festivals with the country’s legendary Unknown Blues\n\nBand.\n\nMaha\n\nDev (who reformed Quintessence for anniversary shows recently) went to LA\n\nduring the first wave of punk and formed Made in Japan with bassist Bobby Asea\n\n(ex-Cyclops) and Barry Paul (Savoy Brown; Heavy Metal Kids). They opened for\n\nLove and other greats as well as on The Damned’s first US tour in 1977, while\n\nappearing in the cult horror film New\n\nYear’s Eve (1980, Cannon Films). Their 7” Instant Hit b/w You Never Had It\n\nSo Good (1979) has just been released by Hozac Records in Chicago (HZR-178) to\n\nsome success: see the Single Cream section of Record Collector (May 2016), ‘a crisp nugget of prickly pop\n\npleasure’. A new video is being recorded stateside in the spring.\n\nUnderground\n\nmusic today seems to mean ‘on its way to success’, but back in 1970 it meant a\n\nlife-style and vision. Some bands lost their first fan-base when in the charts,\n\nothers were just too good to be mainstream. In truth, Quintessence were never\n\nunderground in the modern sense: they arrived immediately at the forefront,\n\nwhen the measure was gigs and media coverage not puerile gong evenings. They\n\nwere counter-culture, then and now. If you were around in 1970, this is\n\nunmissable. If you weren’t, it’s well-worth checking out where the period was\n\nat, musically and culturally: an atmospheric time-capsule that hasn’t dated at\n\nall and repays opening and exploring. A double vision of spirits from another\n\ntime.\n\nMany thanks to Jake\n\nMilton, Dave Maha Dev Codling, and Phil Shiva Jones for their kind assistance.\n\nReview by Brian R.
