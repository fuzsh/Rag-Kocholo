[An indie store exclusive coke bottle green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBlues Traveler – Traveler’s Soul CD (Roundhill)\n\nGrammy Award-winning band Blues Traveler is back with their 15th full-length album, Traveler’s Soul. This album, like 2021’s Traveler’s Blues – a blues covers album that earned the band a Grammy nomination – is a covers album paying tribute to R&B and soul classics with featured artists such as Pat Monahan from Train, Valerie June, Alisan Porter, Daisha McBride, and many more. First single “Fool Ffor You,” originally popularized by Curtis Mayfield’s The Impressions back in 1968, has a wailing harmonica that gives way to an understated guitar riff and a heavenly piano melody. This ebb-and-flow underlines a smoldering vocal performance from John Popper backed by a rapturous choir. [Vinyl edition due November 3.]\n\nChris Botti – Vol. 1 CD/LP (Blue Note)\n\nGrammy Award-winning trumpeter Chris Botti gets back to the jazz essence of his artistry on his new album, Vol. 1. The album features beautiful new ballad renditions of standards including “My Funny Valentine”, and “Someday My Prince Will Come”, as well as a cover of Coldplay’s “Fix You” and the vocal feature “Paris” with John Splithoff. Produced by David Foster, Vol. 1 features performances by violinist Joshua Bell, pianist Taylor Eigsti, guitarist Gilad Hekselman and others.\n\nGlen Hansard – All That Was East Is West Of Me Now CD/LP (ANTI-)\n\nNot many heroes of indie folk have won an Oscar or created the basis of a successful stage musical, but Glen Hansard is an artist who can wear both of those feathers in his cap. As a member of the Frames and the Swell Season, Hansard won acclaim for his literate, intelligent, and passionate songwriting, and his nuanced vocals, and he’s gone on to win similar accolades as a solo artist. All That Was East Is West Of Me Now is his first solo album in five years. The album demonstrates the Oscar-winning singer-songwriter’s unique ability to blend Irish folk with modern rock and the punch of his storied live shows, of which The Guardian says, “Hansard’s powerful voice, whether raw with passion or tender with regret, shines above arrangements bursting with swagger.” [An indie store exclusive clear pressing is available.]\n\nHauschka – Philanthropy CD/LP (City Slang)\n\nFor Volker Bertelmann, aka Hauschka, music is not solely about its sound, but also a means to facilitate the exchange of ideas and foster meaningful interactions between individuals, revealing his fascination with human connection and engagement. Despite being known for his distinctive prepared piano sound, the Academy Award-winning composer intentionally named his 15th solo studio album Philanthropy to express his compassion and openness. The album combines upbeat and pensive pieces, featuring moments of joy, introspection, and peaceful interludes. Overall, Philanthropy showcases Hauschka’s compositional prowess and serves as a gift that sparks reflection and celebration.\n\nKnuckle Puck – Losing What We Love CD/LP (Pure Noise)\n\nChicago’s Knuckle Puck is one of the most celebrated acts in the modern pop-punk scene. Over the last thirteen years the band have nurtured their craft across three albums and have artfully balanced their emotional spectrum, trading in high-tempered and deeply introspective lyricism, but also cutting the tension with an underlying layer of optimism. But now, with the release of their fourth LP, Losing What We Love, Knuckle Puck no longer sugarcoat life’s hard truths. It is a record about coming to terms with exactly that. It is an attempt to lean into the transition between a high point in life to a low point. These songs are a tribute to the familiar while acknowledging that nothing can stay the same forever. [An indie store exclusive split baby pink/baby blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDylan LeBlanc – Coyote CD/LP (ATO)\n\nCoyote is the fifth album by Dylan LeBlanc – and the first one he self-produced. Recorded at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, it boasts a cherry-picked lineup of what he calls “killer session players,” such as drummer Fred Eltringham (Ringo Starr, Sheryl Crow), pianist Jim “Moose” Brown (Bob Seger) and bass player Seth Kaufman (Lana Del Rey). The record is both autobiographical and a concept album built around the character of Coyote, a man on the run.\n\nMyrkur – Spine CD/LP (Relapse)\n\nMyrkur (Amalie Bruun) returns with her highly anticipated new album, Spine. The new album is a tour-de-force, amalgamating some of the most exciting, innovative, and genre-defying moments from Myrkur’s catalog into something that is haunting, extreme, and brilliant as ever. Spine relates to Myrkur’s personal mythology. Written during one of the most difficult times in Amalie Bruun’s life – Spine is the direct result of her experiences following childbirth. From the love and euphoria that comes with motherhood, to the fears of the unknown and the mysteries of the journey ahead, Spine is ultimately an album about seeking balance amidst chaos. To Bruun/Myrkur, the record explores the very human nature of what it means to be a mother and finds resonances with Scandinavian mythology to do so. [A limited-edition silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Hackney Diamonds CD/LP (Geffen)\n\nHackney Diamonds, the hugely anticipated new album by The Rolling Stones, and follows the release of 2016’s Grammy Award winning Blue & Lonesome, which featured brilliant versions of blues tracks that helped shape their sound. Hackney Diamonds also marks the band’s first studio album of original material since 2005’s A Bigger Bang. Late drummer Charlie Watts features on two tracks, “Mess It Up” and “Live By The Sword”. “Live By The Sword” additionally features bass from former Stones bassist Bill Wyman. “Sweet Sounds Of Heaven” features vocals from Lady Gaga and keys and piano from Stevie Wonder, and “Bite My Head Off” includes bass from Paul McCartney, while “Get Close” and “Live By The Sword” features piano from Elton John.

Taken from his paternal grandfather’s name, which is also Sampha’s middle name, Lahai revels in the awe and magic of our existence, synthesizing the exquisite chaos that one experiences confronting the cycle of life and the beyondness. Like its maker, Lahai defies clear categorization. Spanning jazz, soul, rap, dance, jungle, and west African music, Lahai sees Sampha elevating his production and vocal ambition to great new heights. A notable singer, songwriter, and producer, it’s no wonder that artists like Kendrick Lamar, Stormzy, Travis Scott and previously, Drake, Solange, Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Lil Wayne, and Alicia Keys have all tapped the artist for his inimitable voice plus songwriting and production contributions to their music. [An indie store exclusive white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Shindellas – Shindo CD/LP (Weirdo Workshop)\n\nSince hitting the scene back in 2017, The Shindellas, (Kasi Jones, Stacy Johnson, and Tamara Chauniece), who hail from the music city of Nashville, have been on a mission to impact music with their unique sound and style. Hand-picked by Multi-Grammy-nominated production and songwriting duo Chuck Harmony & Claude Kelly (Rihanna, Miley, Jazmine Sullivan, Ledisi, Fantasia, and more), The Shindellas were fueled by the opportunity to make music that would not only matter to them but ring true to the listeners. As a result, the ladies tapped into retro sounds of R&B/Soul influences to bring forth a sound they dubbed as ‘New American Soul’ with hints of The Clark Sisters, EnVogue, The Pointer Sisters, and LaBelle or their new album, Shindo.\n\nThe Shins – Chutes Too Narrow CD/LP+MP3 (Sub Pop)\n\nThis 2023 edition of The Shins’s beloved second album, Chutes Too Narrow, celebrates the album’s 20th anniversary with a fresh remaster by Adam Ayan, supervised by band leader James Mercer, and lovely new packaging for the vinyl. Chutes Too Narrow was recorded in James’ basement home studio, with later mixing assistance from Phil Ek (Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, David Cross, Les Savy Fav, etc.). And, with 10 songs, clocking in at just over 30 minutes, Chutes Too Narrow is a brief yet entirely scintillating glimpse at chiming, reflective and perfectly skewed pop innovation. It was released to widespread acclaim in 2003, garnering Pitchfork’s Best New Music, four stars from Rolling Stone, and raves from the New York Times, MOJO, the Village Voice, SPIN, and tons more. It subsequently made best-of-the-decade lists from The AV Club, NME, Paste, Pitchfork, and Uncut.\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nBoys Like Girls – Sunday At Foxwoods CD (Fearless)\n\nMultiplatinum artists Boys Like Girls release their first new studio album in over 10 years.

Like the mad lovechild of Son House, Faulkner and Patti Smith, Legg has burned a crooked trail to the Promised Land.

He’s a no-nonsense kind of guy who prefers to let his songs speak for themselves. After all, he’s been making music for more than fifty years and in that time, he’s seen both the ups and downs of the music business and has honestly expressed himself in a decidedly uncompromising way. It’s little wonder then that his songs have been recorded by the best in the business – a list that includes Willie Nelson, Johnny Paycheck, Tanya Tucker, Mel Tillis, and Sammy Kershaw, to name but a few. And now a new generation has come along and recorded his songs – artists like Cody Jinks, Colter Wall, Whitey Morgan, and others. Over the years Burns became recognized as one of the original outlaws and great writers of country music.

Crafted using a rare new synthesizer, the Silhouette Eins, Pavlov’s first encounter with the instrument across a long, late-night session resulted in a continuous set of textures, patterns, and subliminal melodies. At some point during the process, he realized he was not alone: “It was as if something was speaking to me through the gear – the feeling was very intense. No matter how determined and specific I attempted to be, the results were something else. They felt like ‘responses.’ This instantly reminded me of ELpH.”\n\nDevo – 50 Years Of De-Evolution 1973–2023 CD/2xLP (Rhino)\n\nDevo marks half a century of de-evolution as the trailblazing band resumes their global tour this fall.

Sutkowski grew up in New Jersey, and although he lives in Brooklyn now, he remains “an emo kid at heart,” garnering inspiration from bands like My Chemical Romance and Muse, the latter of whose theatrical, dramatic performances inspired the band’s own vocal-forward, soaring takes. II represents a foray into heavier material that marks a deeper shift for the band. Now working as a trio, Sutkowski is flanked by Tristan Allen on bass and Mike Costa on drums, a fellow Berklee grad who cut his teeth playing in bands across Boston including past collaborations with Sutkowski. Half-recorded while the band was on tour with Surf Curse, the record finds Sutkowski reaching out for places, people, and beliefs to ground him.

Based out of the frigid capital of the colonial state known as Canada, Dismal Aura surfaced with their self-released debut Praeagia Tristia in 2021. The trio blend second-wave black metal with crust punk and grind elements, an offering as bleak and chilling as it is melodic and impassioned.\n\nDog Eat Dog – Free Radicals CD/LP (Metalville)\n\nDog Eat Dog’s bi-continental lineup and their unique approach to sound and performance has always made them a must-see live act. With Free Radicals, the band reminds listeners why many consider them one of the pioneers of the crossover genre. Album art by Barcelona based artist Marcos Cabrera.

Gesturing to a tradition of Brazilian boogie music, but bouncing with modern pop ebullience, the album sees the Rio artist evolve from a captivating upstart into a surefooted scene leader in full stride. [An indie store exclusive green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMarkus Floats – Fourth Album CD/LP (Contellation)\n\nThe follow-up to his acclaimed Constellation debut Third Album released in lockdown spring 2020, Markus Floats returns with Fourth Album, pushing the Montréal-based artist’s distinct abstract electronic compositions into newly evocative terrain (while preserving his record titling literalism). Signature avant-electronic explorations of arpeggiated and timbral transformation, subtle shifts in harmonic consonance and dissonance, and a through-composed praxis that draws conterminously upon free jazz, musique concrète and modern Minimalism, all continue to shape Fourth Album to great effect. But an additional palette of sonic and gestural raw material is now also decidedly “out-of-the-box”, charting a wider range of gestures, textures, and temporalities.\n\nGavin Friday & The Friday-Seezer Ensemble – Peter And The Wolf CD/LP (BMG)\n\nThe new animated rendition of Sergei Prokofiev’s much-loved symphony, Peter & The Wolf, transformed into an enchanting and contemporary visual masterpiece that touches on themes of growing up, loss, courage, transformation, and our relationship with nature.

A torrential whirlwind born from the livid minds of Igor Amadeus Cavalera (Healing Magic) and Max Cavalera (Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy), this new installment to the band’s dystopian catalog is a fresh dive into the madness of society and the pollution that ravages our minds. From the first note there is a sense of unhinged insanity; a grim rhythm that takes listeners down sinister alleyways and across ravaged soundscapes. [A red w/ black splatter color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGoo Goo Dolls – Live At The Academy, New York City, 1995 2xCD/3xLP (WB)\n\nIn November 1995, just as their song “Name” was becoming their first hit, Goo Goo Dolls played their biggest live show to date.

As a member of the Frames and the Swell Season, Hansard won acclaim for his literate, intelligent, and passionate songwriting, and his nuanced vocals, and he’s gone on to win similar accolades as a solo artist. All That Was East Is West Of Me Now is his first solo album in five years. The album demonstrates the Oscar-winning singer-songwriter’s unique ability to blend Irish folk with modern rock and the punch of his storied live shows, of which The Guardian says, “Hansard’s powerful voice, whether raw with passion or tender with regret, shines above arrangements bursting with swagger.” [An indie store exclusive clear pressing is available.]\n\nHarsh Symmetry – Imitation CD/LP+MP3 (Fabrika)\n\nImitation or Archetype?

The album combines upbeat and pensive pieces, featuring moments of joy, introspection, and peaceful interludes. Overall, Philanthropy showcases Hauschka’s compositional prowess and serves as a gift that sparks reflection and celebration.\n\nRichard Hawley – Now Then: The Very Best Of Richard Hawley 2xCD/2xLP (BMG)\n\nRichard Hawley is widely recognized as both one of the UK’s greatest songwriters and one of its most respected.

After leaving Blanco y Negro, the Reid brothers signed to Sub Pop in the US and Creation, who had released their debut single “Upside Down” in 1984, in the UK. Munki was – up until the Mary Chain’s reformation in 2007 – an experimental rock’n’roll masterclass turned swan song for the Reid brothers, who’s fractious in-fighting culminated in the band’s break-up less than a year after its release. [An indie store exclusive blue & red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAtley King – Unconditional CD (Cellar Live)\n\nAtley King is Canada’s leading young jazz vibraphonist.

Over the last thirteen years the band have nurtured their craft across three albums and have artfully balanced their emotional spectrum, trading in high-tempered and deeply introspective lyricism, but also cutting the tension with an underlying layer of optimism. But now, with the release of their fourth LP, Losing What We Love, Knuckle Puck no longer sugarcoat life’s hard truths. It is a record about coming to terms with exactly that. It is an attempt to lean into the transition between a high point in life to a low point. These songs are a tribute to the familiar while acknowledging that nothing can stay the same forever. [An indie store exclusive split baby pink/baby blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDylan LeBlanc – Coyote CD/LP (ATO)\n\nCoyote is the fifth album by Dylan LeBlanc – and the first one he self-produced. Recorded at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, it boasts a cherry-picked lineup of what he calls “killer session players,” such as drummer Fred Eltringham (Ringo Starr, Sheryl Crow), pianist Jim “Moose” Brown (Bob Seger) and bass player Seth Kaufman (Lana Del Rey). The record is both autobiographical and a concept album built around the character of Coyote, a man on the run.\n\nPaul Lidel’s Scream Therapy – Paul Lidel’s Scream Therapy CD (Perris)\n\nFeaturing Paul Lidel of Dangerous Toys.

[A limited-edition purple color vinyl reissue of 2003’s REvolution is also available this week.]\n\nThe Maine – The Maine CD (8123/Photo Finish)\n\nThe Maine’s self-titled ninth studio album was produced by Colby Wedgeworth, who the band describe as practically their sixth member. The album’s digital release date (8.1.23) also holds significance as it’s a once-in-a-lifetime alignment of numbers that hold a lot of meaning to the band. 8123 was in a parking garage where the band members would hang out growing up. 8123 has since been used in their song lyrics, their music festival, on fan’s tattoos, and is the title of their own record label.\n\nMaria BC – Spike Field CD/LP (Sacred Bones)\n\nIn the early 1990s, a team of linguists, engineers, anthropologists, and archaeologists were tasked with constructing a type of communication that could transcend time. How might we converse with future civilizations when language may evolve or dissolve entirely? The result yielded the design of spike fields; a strange construction of granite thorns bursting from the earth to alert its viewers to the deadly uninhabitability of nuclear waste disposal sites. For Maria BC (they/them), this state of temporal focus molds the wanderings on their second full length album Spike Field. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDuff McKagan – Lighthouse CD/LP (BFD)\n\nThird solo album from the Guns N’ Roses bassist. The album features appearances by Slash, Alice in Chains’ Jerry Cantrell, and Iggy Pop.

Still very much a Brian McKnight album, McKnighttime Lullabies is for fans of jazz and R&B, parents, and grandparents – and anyone that needs to step back and relax.\n\nMinas – Num Dia Azul [Reissue/1983] CD/LP (Mr Bongo)\n\nNum Dia Azul is a sublime slice of private press bossa nova meets jazzy MPB perfection. Warm and bubbling with youthful spirit, the music is simultaneously loose in swagger, yet slick and tight. The album was originally released in 1983 and reflects the great music coming out of Rio at the time, yet Num Dia Azul wasn’t recorded in Rio, but in the US.\n\nThe Mojo Men – There Goes My Mind CD/LP (Sundazed Music)\n\nLost, way out sound from San Francisco’s Mojo Men. There Goes My Mind finds The Mojo Men in full control of their high-wire blend of boy-girl vocals. They had regional, British Invasion-style hits in 1965-66, and even hit national top 40 in 1967. Abetted principally by sparkling keyboard wizardry, winsome vocals, and lavish guitars, this is your ticket to one of West Coast’s best psychedelic garage bands.\n\nMyrkur – Spine CD/LP (Relapse)\n\nMyrkur (Amalie Bruun) returns with her highly anticipated new album, Spine. The new album is a tour-de-force, amalgamating some of the most exciting, innovative, and genre-defying moments from Myrkur’s catalog into something that is haunting, extreme, and brilliant as ever. Spine relates to Myrkur’s personal mythology. Written during one of the most difficult times in Amalie Bruun’s life – Spine is the direct result of her experiences following childbirth. From the love and euphoria that comes with motherhood, to the fears of the unknown and the mysteries of the journey ahead, Spine is ultimately an album about seeking balance amidst chaos. To Bruun/Myrkur, the record explores the very human nature of what it means to be a mother and finds resonances with Scandinavian mythology to do so. [Two limited-edition vinyl colorways are available: pink and silver. A vinyl reissue of 2020’s Folkesange is also available this week.]\n\nIsrael Nash – Ozarker CD/LP (Israel Nash)\n\nHailed as a “master of sonic textures” by Rolling Stone and “folk-rock visionary” by Uncut, Israel Nash first rose to fame in Europe, where he built a loyal following with a series of critically acclaimed albums that landed him a deal with the renowned Loose Music label. As American audiences began to catch on, the Missouri native relocated to Dripping Springs, Texas, where he built his own recording studio on a ranch and embraced a more spacious, psychedelic sound that landed somewhere between Neil Young and Pink Floyd. Produced by Kevin Ratterman (My Morning Jacket, Ray LaMontagne), Nash’s newest record, the rousing Ozarker, finds him returning to his Midwestern roots, embracing the heartland rock he grew up on with larger-than-life guitars, anthemic melodies, and rich character studies.

By technically isolating her voice, they have allowed the refrains of yesteryears to prove that they remain as immortal as their interpreter.

Although Veruca Salt has consistently released music with Post as the sole constant member, during the pandemic she started writing a collection of songs that felt more personal and less like the follow-up to Veruca Salt’s 2015 return-to-form, Ghost Notes. “Sleepwalker is a continuation of Post’s legacy for heavy hooks and witty lyrics.” – Consequence [A limited-edition white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPrimal Scream – Reverberations (Travelling In Time) CD/LP (Acid Jazz)\n\nBoasting eleven previously unreleased BBC session recordings plus all five songs from Primal Scream’s first two Creation Records singles, Reverberations (Travelling In Time) perfectly captures what many believe to be a crucial era for one of the UK’s most important groups as they went on to influence a wave of emerging bands, most notably The Stone Roses.

Eli takes Motorhead’s hard rock classic and reimagines it as a soul revival with Hammond organ, brass horns, electric guitar, Eli’s signature vocal wails and a backbeat that creates a new take on the song that is no less powerful than the original. Hits And Misses also includes Eli’s noirish R&B take on Steely Dan’s 1972 hit “Do It Again” that brings the original song back in time 30 years and a cover of Latimore’s 1974 hit “Let’s Straighten It Out”, showcasing a vocal intensity that’s not quite as present in the nearly spoken word original.\n\nRestless Road – Last Rodeo CD (SME Nashville)\n\nRestless Road’s 18 track debut Last Rodeo features brand new hits and the previously released singles “Last Rodeo”, “I Don’t Wanna Be That Guy”, “Sundown Somewhere”, their breakout success “Growing Old With You” and fan favorite “Bar Friends”.\n\nRival Sons – Lightbringer CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\n“It’s the most old-school Rival Sons song on either of these two records,” says frontman Jay Buchanan. “It has all of the early elements of what Rival Sons is and was. It was born out of my love mid- ‘60s rock like The Animals, The Kinks, and the bands I was raised on. It’s a bit of a break from all the heavy subject matter too; it’s a barnburner.” – loudersound.com\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Hackney Diamonds CD/LP (Geffen)\n\nHackney Diamonds, the hugely anticipated new album by The Rolling Stones, and follows the release of 2016’s Grammy Award winning Blue & Lonesome, which featured brilliant versions of blues tracks that helped shape their sound.

Like its maker, Lahai defies clear categorization. Spanning jazz, soul, rap, dance, jungle, and west African music, Lahai sees Sampha elevating his production and vocal ambition to great new heights. A notable singer, songwriter, and producer, it’s no wonder that artists like Kendrick Lamar, Stormzy, Travis Scott and previously, Drake, Solange, Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Lil Wayne, and Alicia Keys have all tapped the artist for his inimitable voice plus songwriting and production contributions to their music.

Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee. Americana and rock songwriter. Modern-day guitar hero. For more than 25 years, Chris Shiflett has blurred the lines between genre and generation, balancing his full-band projects with a thriving solo career. He turns a new page with Lost At Sea, a solo record that builds a bridge between Nashville – where Shiflett has become a frequent visitor, performing on the Grand Ole Opry one minute and collaborating with Music City tastemakers like Jaren Johnston and Dave Cobb the next – and his native California. Caught halfway between the honky-tonk saloon and the punk-rock dive bar, Lost At Sea is both eclectic and electric, making room for alt-country crunch, guitar-driven grit, and sharp songwriting.\n\nThe Shindellas – Shindo CD/LP (Weirdo Workshop)\n\nSince hitting the scene back in 2017, The Shindellas, (Kasi Jones, Stacy Johnson, and Tamara Chauniece), who hail from the music city of Nashville, have been on a mission to impact music with their unique sound and style. Hand-picked by Multi-Grammy-nominated production and songwriting duo Chuck Harmony & Claude Kelly (Rihanna, Miley, Jazmine Sullivan, Ledisi, Fantasia, and more), The Shindellas were fueled by the opportunity to make music that would not only matter to them but ring true to the listeners.

In the first release of this mythic trilogy, intricate sound design and spellbinding leitmotifs make sense of loss and what’s beyond. Formative exposures by way of travel through Asia, studies in Gamelan, a paper mache Christmas angel, and their dad’s Bread and Puppet Theater artifacts formed a web of inspiration from which Tristan’s desire to combine puppetry and their fascination for the narrative power of instrumental music emerged. Years of synchronistic inspirational encounters with “guardian angels” in the form of music mentors and puppeteer masters incentivized Tristan to pursue a project where they could focus on sound and diverse instrumentation.\n\nAlvarius B – Trolling The De-Enlightnement (Live In Europe) LP (Unrock)\n\nTrolling The De-Enlightenment is a solo live recording from Alan Bishop under his well-known Alvarius B. alias. It was recorded on various occasions throughout western Europe during and after the period he was recording his 2017 trilogy release With A Beaker On The Burner and An Otter In The Oven. Bishop’s presence and charisma, alongside his distinctive voice and the twisted characters he has to offer, filled the rooms he played in, and these recordings transport his unique performance vibe to this vinyl edition.\n\nAnyma – Genesys 2xLP (Interscope)\n\nClear vinyl pressing. Anyma’s highly anticipated debut album Genesys follows the release of his previous singles “Welcome To The Opera” with Grimes and “Syren”.

Recorded and produced by Dom Monks at Guissona, Spain’s Teatre de cal Eril Studio during a recent tour, “Vampire Empire” speaks to the beautiful complexity of gender identity and breaking destructive internal cycles. Of the song, Adrianne Lenker adds, “For me, it’s about getting out of toxic internal patterns – leaving the empire of energy drains that obscure pure essence, learning about what healthy boundaries are, and finding the power to implement them for the possibility of giving and receiving (both inwardly and outwardly) unbroken and infinite Love.”\n\nArt Blakey & The Jazz Messengers – Mosaic [Reissue/1961] LP (Blue Note)\n\nThe 1961 album Mosaic marked a pivotal moment in the story of Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers with the drummer welcoming the arrival of trumpeter Freddie Hubbard (replacing Lee Morgan) and pianist Cedar Walton (replacing Bobby Timmons). The band also expanded to a sextet with the addition of trombonist Curtis Fuller who joined existing members tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassist Jymie Merritt to establish a powerful new line-up that would perform together until 1964 and record several classic albums including Buhaina’s Delight and Free For All.\n\nBlind Guardian – At The Edge Of Time [Reissue/2010] 2xLP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nBlind Guardian – Beyond The Red Mirror [Reissue/2015] 2xLP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nAfter the success of 2022’s The God Machine, Germany’s metal powerhouse Blind Guardian continues to reissue color vinyl editions of some much sought-after recent entries in their discography.

Improvising on incantations from Gnaoua liturgy, Brötzmann’s horn cries as summons and statement; Drake’s drums awaken inner impulses; Bekkas’ strings, plucked and strummed, tie it all together, and his voice brings the song home.\n\nZac Brown – The Foundation [Reissue/2008] LP (Fugitive Recordings)\n\nZac Brown – Uncaged [Reissue/2012] LP (Fugitive Recordings)\n\nVinyl reissues of the 2008 and 2012 albums by the country music singer/songwriter.

Burnside, originally released in 1998. Although the album’s fusion of styles was deemed unusual by critics, it received acclaim from music journalists and showed respectable sales, becoming the best-selling album distributed by Epitaph Records in early 1999. The album’s sound was explored by Burnside in his later works.\n\nCactus Lee – Caravan LP (Org Music)\n\nCaravan is the new album by Cactus Lee, an Austin based musician with a tireless devotion to songcraft. The record’s influences are culled from generation-spanning sounds of quintessentially Texas music. It is the most sonically expansive version of the project yet, featuring ornate arrangements akin to the likes of Gene Clark. It marks a clear evolution from homespun beginnings, showcasing the payoff of months of weekly performances and time spent in the studio.\n\nCanned Heat – Boogie With Canned Heat [Reissue/1968] LP (Elemental Music)\n\nBoogie With Canned Heat, their second studio album, was released in 1968 and features the original lineup with Bob “The Bear” Lite (lead vocals), Alan “Blind Owl” Wilson (slide guitar/harmonica/vocals), Henry “Sunflower” Vestine (lead guitar), Larry “The Mole” Taylor (bass guitar) and Adolfo “Fito” de la Parra (drums), plus guest appearances by Dr. John and Sunnyland Slim.

His music is no longer a secret between dance DJs (even if they maybe wished it had stayed that way). Even as artists like Drake and Beyonce are venturing into dance music, Channel Tres has been touted as the impetus for house music’s resurgence in pop music by outlets including BET, Billboard, V, Highsnobiety, The Ringer, and more.\n\nThe Cinematic Orchestra – Man With A Movie Camera [Reissue/2003] LP+12”+MP3 (Ninja Tune)\n\nDouble ashen and pewter grey color vinyl pressing housed in gatefold jacket.

Jason Swinscoe of The Cinematic Orchestra was commissioned to score a soundtrack to a silent movie as a one-off performance.

A rendition of the piece “Broken Shadows” itself, a dirge of astonishing beauty second only to his “Lonely Woman”. opens the live performance and offers solos of deep and poignant probity from Coleman and tenorist Dewey Redman, whose earthy growled tones counterbalanced the leader’s so well for so long. Crisis somehow lacks the reputation of the revolutionary Coleman albums from early in his career, but on purely musical grounds it ranks among his most satisfying works.\n\nCoreleoni – Alive LP (Metalville)\n\nLimited edition oxblood colorway. Alive is the pure rock ‘n’ roll quintessence which combines many of the early Gotthard and current CoreLeoni hits, such as “Standing In The Light”, “Firedance”, “Purple Dynamite”, “Let Life Begin Tonight”, and many more. [CD version due November 3.]\n\nCradle Of Filth – Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa [Reissue/2010] 2xLP (Season Of Mist)\n\nGrammy-nominated Cradle Of Filth have been pioneers of extreme music since their debut in 1994. Never shy to embrace the epic, they have constantly sought to push the boundaries of their art. Unafraid of ruffling a few feathers, the band have continually refused to bow to convention or to conform to prevalent trends and fads. Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa is their ninth studio album and remains one of their fastest and most brutal.\n\nCraft – Void [Reissue/2011] 2xLP (Season Of Mist)\n\nSilver colorway. Craft embodies the black metal virtue of raw spiritual energy expressed through violent, ripping guitar-work and unholy rhythms enhanced by demonic vocals.\n\nCupid & Psyche – Romantic Music LP (Felte)\n\nTangerine orange colorway. The dual forces of shadow and light, despair and hope, frustration and catharsis are at play in the music of Cupid & Psyche, the Los Angeles-based indie rock duo of Michael Vidal and Juan Velasquez. First gaining recognition in the late aughts as members of the punk band Abe Vigoda, whose 2010 album Crush was named one of the “Best 50 Albums of the 2010s” by Pitchfork, the two have reunited as collaborators for the first time in a decade.\n\nDiesel Boy – Gets Old LP (Sbam)\n\nTo say 22 years is a long time would be an obvious statement. A lot would have changed in the world, a long list of life events would have taken place and things may have progressed (or gone backwards) in society. Now imagine a band taking that time to release another record, sounds insane right? Well, that’s the case with Diesel Boy who disbanded a year after the release of their 2001 record Rode Hard And Put Away Wet, and after two decades of abandoned reunion plans and an occasional performance, they are now officially back together with their brand new album Gets Old. Much of this album can be summed up as pure skate punk that should bring you back to your childhood and teenage years, where things were simple, and you had almost no worries about responsibility.” – Charlotte Griffiths, Distorted Sound Mag\n\nDirty Three – Ocean Songs [Reissue/1998] LP (Touch And Go)\n\nTranslucent green colorway. Recorded by Steve Albini at Chicago’s Electrical Audio and released in 1998, Ocean Songs is Dirty Three’s fourth album. It sees them straying a bit from the manic dynamics of 1996’s Horse Stories, where the songs were at first coaxed into existence, only to be bashed apart in a raucous ending. Ocean Songs plies the listener with tales of longing and weariness, although hope is just around the corner.\n\nD-Styles & J Science – Periodic Tables Of Excellence LP (Static King)\n\nTurntablist, producer, and member of The Legendary Beat Junkies & Invisibl Skratch Piklz, DJ D – Styles teams up with Emcee/Producer J Scienide (Kev Brown, Daringer, Conway) to bring you The Periodic Tables Of Excellence. Produced entirely by D-Styles with Scienide handling vocal duties.\n\nDusk – Glass Pastures LP (Don Giovanni)\n\nAppleton, Wisconsin’s Dusk may seem to have fallen from the sky. Surrounded by a music climate of destination festivals and Instagram celebrity, they’ve remained reclusive, yet focused on the proverbial carrot on the end of the stick that’s hard for so many working musicians to define. For the past four years, they’ve maintained a steady schedule of recording and “hitting the dirt,” as they say: spending weeks on the road playing dives and basements. The group was conceived in 2014 as a casual recording project between vocalist and bassist Amos Pitsch and drummer Colin Wilde. Amos had just completed recording Predatory Headlights, the critically acclaimed double album by his other group, Tenement, and with the newfound down time, he and Colin arranged their own versions of vintage soul songs. The intention was to treat the project like a revolving door for collaborators, but soon the permanent additions of vocalist/pianist Julia Blair, lead guitarist Tyler Ditter, and Ryley Crowe on pedal steel, rhythm guitar, and vocal duties would cement the band into a consistent rock and roll ensemble; informed by soul music, country, jazz, and beyond.\n\nEisbrecher – Die Hölle Muss Warten [Reissue/2012] 2xLP (Metropolis)\n\nThe unexpected Ice Age that seized the music world in 2002 continues as Eisbrecher masterminds Alexx Wesselsky and Noel Pix return for another classic release that is sure to cause waves in both the electronic and metal scenes.\n\nFaith And The Muse – Elyria [Reissue/1994] 2xLP (The Circle Music)\n\nElyria consists of 14 equally enchanting musical pieces. Listening to this album, the listener can fully enjoy the raw talent of Faith And The Muse; that is, William Faith and Monica Richards, the duo who composed and performed this incredible album. The beauty hidden behind brilliant songs such as the eponymous “Elyria”, the monumental epic “All Lovers Lost”, the seductive seven-minute musical fairytale “”, the esteemed echoes of “”, the legendary “The Trauma Coil” … Elyria is both otherworldly and sophisticated.\n\nFields Of The Nephilim – The Nephilim [Reissue/1988] 2xLP (Beggars Banquet)\n\nThe second Fields Of The Nephilim album, The Nephilim, was released 35 years ago by Situation Two/Beggars Banquet in 1988, and not pressed on vinyl since then. The album is pressed on golden brown vinyl and is expanded to a double LP. The Nephilim contains their epic, legendary track “Moonchild” plus three bonus tracks. Formed in 1984, Fields Of The Nephilim is the creation of vocalist and front man Carl McCoy. Highly influential, especially in the world of goth, but also within the metal and electronic genres, their legacy endures to this day.\n\nFox Academy – Joseph’s Deli & Lottery LP (Many Hats Endeavors)\n\nRed w/ black colorway. “Joseph’s Deli & Lottery is an album about a place we’ve never entered, but instead dream of what it’s like inside. After an extensive break from recording new music, we spent a day filming in a new PNW town to reconnect. Over the course of the day, we gradually rediscovered the pulse of the band’s collaboration. Finding beauty, humor and intrigue in every moment led us into nightfall as we followed an orange glowing light in the distance. The sacred ritual of following the light in the dark felt bittersweet and deeply metaphoric. When we arrived at the destination, rather than walking in we decided to fuel that feeling into a new album. Drifting between the subtle comfort and acceptance of being in the darkness mixed with moments of emerging into the light, the album tends to sway back and forth in many aspects. Never lost is Fox Academy’s classic appreciation of love, beauty, stores, food, Halloween, brands, corporations, and professional sports.”\n\nFuture – Pluto [Reissue/2012] 2xLP (Epic)\n\nFuture – DS2 [Reissue/2015] 2xLP (Epic)\n\nFuture & Young Thug – Super Slimey [Reissue/2017] LP (Epic)\n\nVinyl reissues of the rapper’s first and third albums along with his 2017 mixtape w/ Young Thug.\n\nThe Goa Express – The Goa Express LP (Communion)\n\nThe Goa Express, led by Clarke alongside his brother Joe and best friends Joey, Naham and Sam, met as young teenagers in Burnley. Growing up in the rural shadow of England’s industrial north, music was a means of escape and a vessel for friendship. Their shared adolescent experiences (late gigs at The Golden Lion in Todmorden, camping underneath the cliffs at Hebden Bridge) shaped their collective attitudes and behaviors and, ultimately, the sound and spirit of their band. There is a sense of melody and a looseness in the music that recalls Supergrass or The La’s.\n\nGod Forbid – IV: Constitution Of Treason [Reissue/2005] 2xLP (M-Theory Audio)\n\nIV: Constitution Of Treason is the fourth full-length album by metal quintet God Forbid, originally released in 2005. It is a concept album telling the story of a futuristic society that destroys itself, reforms many years later, and eventually destroys itself again in the same way as originally.\n\nFrançois Hadji-Lazaro, Pigalle & GB – Un Recueil Frais Et Disco [Reissue/2003] LP (PIAS America)\n\nFirst-time vinyl pressing of an alt-rock/Chanson rarity. RIP François Hadji-Lazaro 1956-2023.\n\nHarakiri For The Sky – III: Trauma 2xLP (AOP/Art Of Propaganda)\n\nArt Of Propaganda is proud to present the highly anticipated third album of Harakiri For The Sky, III: Trauma. Released in 2014 by Art of Propaganda, Harakiri For The Sky’s Aokigahara reaped widespread critical acclaim for its startling synthesis of skyscraping post-rock textures and emotive black metal fury. Breathtaking and torturous in equal measures, the highwater mark that Aokigahara set has somehow been eclipsed by III: Trauma.\n\nRoy Head – Treat Her Right – The Backbeat Recordings LP (Surtro Park)\n\nTreat Her Right is the first ever vinyl compilation of the best tracks Roy Head released on the Backbeat label in the 1960s. They are his finest recordings, including the hit that launched his career, “Treat Her Right”. With most tracks produced by The Crazy Cajun himself, Huey Meaux (who also scored hits with Doug Sahm, Freddie Fender and so many others), they are the best examples of early southern swampy pop.\n\nDavid Hillyard & The Rocksteady 7 – The Giver [Reissue/2018] LP (Org Music)\n\nGreen colorway. The Giver is the fifth album from David Hillyard & The Rocksteady 7, following Hillyard’s 2014 solo album, California.

The Giver features Jamaican percussion legend and Rocksteady 7 regular Larry McDonald. Also featured prominently is vocalist Sean Wheeler, best known as frontman of Throwrag.\n\nHotwax – Invite Me, Kindly LP (Fuga)\n\nOrange/clear splatter. The Invite Me, Kindly double-EP features the band’s debut EP A Thousand Times and the band’s sophomore work, Invite Me, Kindly. “Invite Me, Kindly is about accepting people who have hurt you before, letting your doubts leave you and feeling free, written with the real and authentic voice of a band barely out of their teens yet already sharing stages with the likes of Royal Blood, Queens of the Stone Age and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The EP features singles “Drop”, ‘Phone Machine” and “High Tea”.\n\nHunny – Hunny’s New Planet Heaven LP (Epitaph)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on limited-edition eco-mix color vinyl.

Passing ideas from Stockholm to the US, Ivarsson found himself rising to the challenge of working with the great Bill Laswell, covering a variety of styles from ambient to free jazz to world music. Working with key band members – Hux Nettermalm (drums), Thomas Backman (sax, clarinet), and Per Wiberg (organ) – Ivarsson crafted the sound integrating Laswell’s recordings and his own bass. The result of this challenging and explorative work is… Nammu.\n\nJarboe – Sacrificial Cake [Reissue/1995] 2xLP (The Circle Music)\n\nLimited double 180gm lavender color vinyl pressing in gatefold jacket. “Sacrificial Cake is one of my most popular albums. The song, ‘Lavender Girl’ is the song fans tell me is one of their favorite songs, ever. As this album was never available on its own, I am thrilled for The Circle Music to have it be available and especially on lavender vinyl in homage to the beloved song.” – Jarboe\n\nAntônio Carlos Jobim – Stone Flower LP (Endless Happiness)\n\nAntônio Carlos Jobim was a primary force behind the evolution of bossa nova and his sixth studio release Stone Flower is an absolute classic. The album is emblematic of ’70s bossa with its seductive samba beat fused with elements of modern jazz provided by a star-studded supporting cast of Ron Carter, Hubert Laws, Airto Moreira, and Joe Farrell.\n\nJudgitzu – Sator Arepo LP (Nyege Nyege Tapes)\n\nThe Sator Arepo, or Sator Square, is an ancient word puzzle comprising five palindromes that’s etched on various historical sites throughout the Western world. Its origins are unknown, but the square has long been thought to hold magical properties, used as a charm against illness and evil, to cure insanity or to determine whether someone was guilty of witchcraft. Self-styled “punk ethnomusicologist”, acoustician and musician Julien Hairon uses this mystical symbol as the starting point for his debut Judgitzu album to reconnect with his Celtic heritage, exploring how it’s hallowed messages might harmonize with contemporary Tanzanian dance music.\n\nKid Koala – Some Of My Best Friends Are DJs [Reissue/2003] LP+MP3 (Ninja Tune)\n\nLimited silver color vinyl pressing housed in gatefold jacket. Includes comic book and digital download. Cult classic Some Of my Best Friends Are DJs is given a new lease of life on the 20th anniversary of release.

Some Of My Best Friends Are DJs comes complete with the original 50-page comic book and mini chess game from the first pressing. On its original release, the album was supported by a cabaret-style tour known as “The Short Attention Span Theatre”, which featured three DJs on eight turntables, a slide show, and a bingo game among other quirky surprises.\n\nLes Garçons Bouchers – Les Garçons Bouchers [Reissue/1987] LP (PIAS America)\n\nLes Garçons Bouchers was a French rock band from Paris.

The band formed in the winter of 1985 and disbanded in April 1997.\n\nLil Uzi Vert – Pink Tape 2xLP (Atlantic)\n\nDouble pink color vinyl pressing. Grammy-nominated Diamond-selling rap superstar Lil Uzi Vert flaunts a vision and fashion sense just as loud as his futuristic sound. Igniting the scene with their own fire, they have exploded into a hip-hop rockstar and become one of today’s biggest and most influential artists. Following the Red & White EP (2022), Uzi has made an explosive return last fall with the Jersey club inspired anthem “Just Wanna Rock”, leading to his highly anticipated new album Pink Tape. Over the years, the rap superstar has also collaborated with the likes of Justin Bieber, Tyler The Creator, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Metro Boomin, 21 Savage, Gunna, Lil Durk, Meek Mill, Pharrell Williams, The Weekend and many more. On Pink Tape Lil Uzi Vert fuses his rock and hip-hop influences, stretching their sound in new directions.\n\nL’Orange / Jeremiah Jae – The Night Took Us In Like Family LP (Mello Music)\n\nJeremiah Jae and L’Orange’s noir-inspired opus, The Night Took Us In Like Family stylistically mixes the the alchemy of Madvillain and The Maltese Falcon: a five-part fable of tangled crimes, narrow escapes, and raining lead. Beats bend sinister with imagery aiming for the temples. Jae invokes dark clouds, crowns of thorns and LSD eyes. Bars written in dirt. Samples are disembodied and ethereal. It’s like a grand jury indictment doubling as a Greek chorus. [Two colorways are available: red & black and indie store exclusive silver.]\n\nLost Girls – Selvutsletter LP (Smalltown Supersound)\n\nAfter collaborating for more than a decade, Jenny Hval and Håvard Volden released their first album under the Lost Girls moniker in 2021, Menneskekollektivet. The record received rave reviews, including a Best New Music mark at Pitchfork. Now the duo releases their second album, Selvutsletter. Working in tandem, with Volden creating beats and wild sets of guitar chords and Hval restructuring the parts, creating melodies, words and adding more sounds, they started spiraling into unchartered territory of shorter, more concise, and melodic songs than their debut LP Menneskekollektivet. As the material developed, words already embedded in the chords, guitar sounds and rhythms began to dance around. Lyrics about cities after dark, music rituals and band practices of the ‘90s, and the early days of the internet began to take shape.\n\nLync – These Are Not Fall Colors [Reissue/1994] 2xLP (Suicide Squeeze)\n\nWhen the grunge explosion of the early ’90s elevated Seattle’s flannel-clad misfits out of the divey clubs of downtown and into the mainstream, a new generation of restless artists filled the void left in the Pacific Northwest’s underground music scene. The under-21 crowd making music in the wake of Nevermind seemed even less enamored with the slick production values, classic rock nods, and testosterone-fueled moshing culture that came with the Zeitgeist, favoring their own kind of Revolution Summer-style pivot away from the popular sounds of the era towards a more emotionally nuanced, melodic, and inclusive style of punk. The Puget Sound trio Lync perfectly captured the spirit of that era, blending the passionate chaos of the DC and San Diego scenes with the rough-hewn DIY pop sensibilities of Olympia’s thriving indie community into one unified sound.\n\nLynch Mob – REvolution [Reissue/2003] LP (Deadline Music)\n\nLimited-edition purple colorway. Legendary axeman, George Lynch, and his band of heavy metal brothers, Lynch Mob, tear their way through supercharged renditions of classic Dokken/Lynch Mob tracks such as “Tooth And Nail”, “Breaking The Chains”, “Wicked Sensation” and more.\n\nMac Dre – The Genie Of The Lamp [Reissue/2004] 2xLP (Thizz Ent.)\n\nS.F. Bay Area rap legend Mac Dre (R.I.P.) as another of his alter ego rap personas. The Genie Of The Lamp is the doppelganger of Ronald Dregan, yet they share the same voice and interests, food, fame, females, phat fu, and ‘fetti – not necessarily in that order. 15 tracks make up this counterpart to Mac Dre’s other election year (2004) release, “Ronald Dregan – Dreganomics” (THZ 1065). Production by Tone Capone, Mac Dre, Gennessee, Shouman, One Drop Scott, Traxx, Harm, Johah Whale, Syko, Rob-Lo, and others. X-RATED. In a gatefold sleeve with unique marbleized color vinyl – one gold and one purple.\n\nMatt Maeson – Bank On The Funeral (Stripped) 2xLP (Atlantic)\n\nTranslucent white colorway. Matt Maeson releases the Stripped version of his debut album Bank On The Funeral on vinyl. It is rare that stripped or alternative versions of music make big waves, but for Matt Maeson “Cringe – Stripped” added fuel to the fire of the original song that he released all the way back in 2016.\n\nMagma – Une Histoire de Mekanïk – 50 Years Of Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh 7xLP (Prophecy)\n\nThis lavish seven-LP boxed set celebrates the 50th anniversary of the French prog rock band’s third studio album, originally released in 1973.\n\nMalevolence – Malicious Intent LP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nGold colorway. After a dominant summer performing across the UK’s biggest festivals, Malevolence has proven themselves worthy as the UK’s undisputed kings of heavy metal. Operating from their Sheffield-based HQ, a previously derelict warehouse the band transformed themselves, Malevolence handles as much of their in-house operations as they possibly can.\n\nCharlie Megira & The Modern Dance Club – Love Police [Reissue/2009] 2xLP (Numero)\n\nProvocative post-punk from Israel’s undercover goth prince. Megira’s lone album with the Modern Dance Club showcased a grimier, more driving vision of his brand of trashy no wave. Spread across 31 tracks and two LPs, Love Police schizophrenically mixes industrial soundscapes, surf ditties, hardcore, swamp pop, bubble grunge, screaming, ecstasy, and enough fuzz to warrant a needle check. [A limited-edition coke bottle green colorway is available.]\n\nMighty Baby – Live At Glastonbury Festival June 1971 LP (Trading Places)\n\nObscure British prog-rock band Mighty Baby evolved from a mod group called The Action, but moved heavily into experimental psychedelia in 1969, when they cut an incredible debut for the Head label. Glastonbury Fayre Festival 1971 captures the legendary group in live action, “A Blanket In My Muesli” being a free-form jam that remains their best-loved effort; “India” is a similarly hefty instrumental mega-jam with lilting flute amidst the bluesy guitar work, and there are awesome renditions of “Virgin Spring”, “Devil’s Whisper”, and “Lazy Days”. If you like your prog thoughtful, complex, and multi-layered, this one’s for you.\n\nMike Adams & His Honest Weight – Guess For Thrills LP (Joyful Noise)\n\nA “pop savant of the first order” (AllMusic) who “projects an outsize persona from the stage” (Pitchfork), Mike Adams has created a singular homespun entertainment universe since 2011’s Oscillate Wisely. He’s an appealingly confident showman on his cable access-style variety show (The Mike Adams Show), and an affably humble Hoosier touring musician on his podcast (Tan Van Tour Talk). As Mike Adams at His Honest Weight, he’s a hooky songwriter and multi-instrumentalist with a knack for embodying contradictions. The latest in a prolific stream of recordings, Guess For Thrills gets deep, blending ‘70s-inspired pop songs with synthesizer-driven atmospherics and emerging with a wild and searching album that treats ambiguity as a place of discovery.\n\nHank Mobley – No Room For Squares [Reissue/1963] LP (Blue Note)\n\nIn addition to boasting one of Reid Miles’ greatest album cover designs, Hank Mobley’s 1963 album No Room For Squares is also a marvel for the music alone. The tenor saxophonist had already notched several hard bop masterpieces in his Blue Note belt including Soul Station and Workout, but No Room For Squares was an even more ambitious effort that found Mobley elevating his game as a bandleader, improviser, and a composer. The album was drawn from two different sessions each featuring a different quintet line-up.\n\nDerrick Morgan – Development [Reissue/1972] LP (Sutro Park)\n\nDevelopment is a classic rocksteady record that barely came out in 1972, Jamaica. One of the rarest of the genre, Development is impossible to find. And even when found impossible to find a good playing copy – the pressing was just flawed. Sutro Park Records is proud to present a newly remastered version of the record, available on vinyl for the first time since it originally came out (probably available for the first time anywhere outside a few record shops in Jamaica). Painstakingly remastered by the great Gary Hobish, over a two-year period (there are no tapes, so everything had to be sourced from the best vinyl masters), the resultant vinyl release is a revelation: a must for rocksteady fans, a must for Derrick Morgan fans.\n\nMovements – Feel Something [Reissue/2017] LP (Fearless)\n\nMovements – No Good Left To Give [Reissue/2020] LP (Fearless)\n\nReflecting personal changes from a few whirlwind years, Movements realize the full scope of their storytelling, musicianship, and vision. The music addresses the push-and-pull of relationships and explores loss, love, mental health, and intimacy through a prism of newfound clarity of post-punk grit, alternative expanse, heartfelt spoken word, and subtle pop-rock ambition. [Indie store exclusive colorways are available.]\n\nMyrkur – Folkesange [Reissue/2020] LP (Relapse)\n\nSea blue and baby pink galaxy colorway. Folkesange relinquishes black metal for a refined yet far-reaching evocation of traditional folk, combining songs ancient and new to sublimely resonant effect.\n\nNina Nastasia – Nina Natasia’s The Blackened Air [Reissue/2002] LP (Touch And Go)\n\nOn The Blackened Air (her second album but first for Touch And Go, originally released in 2002), Nina Nastasia and her band are not content to just support a vocal melody; they pry it apart and look down it’s throat. The stringed and wind instruments (viola, cello, mandolin, accordion, bowed saw, acoustic and electric guitars) reach up out of the songs into rarefied territory. Little stories of Peeping Toms and the police lights they bring with them, graveyards and impolite family, epigrams against disaster, depression, simple forgetfulness, all delivered so effortlessly that the precision of the delivery registers long after its substance has left its mark. When she sings “I’m not hiding anything / I’m not trying to fool you at all,” in a song titled “That’s All There Is,” it is all the truth.\n\nWillie Nelson – Spirit [Reissue/1996] LP (Island)\n\nSpirit is the 44th studio album, released in 1996, by American country music singer Willie Nelson. It contains tracks such as “She Is Gone”, “Too Sick To Pray”, “I Thought About You, Lord”, and more.\n\nStephen O’Malley / Anthony Pateras – Sept duos pour guitare acoustique And piano préparé 2xLP (Shelter Press)\n\nRecorded during O’Malley’s residency at La Becque on Lake Geneva in the summer of 2021, from the first moments of the opening ‘déjà revé’ the music immediately establishes the distinctive landscape of chiming tones and hovering clouds of resonance explored throughout its one-hour running time. Pateras’ preparations create tolling bell-like tones alive with complex overtones, alongside which O’Malley’s open strings and natural harmonics add a sparkling clarity.\n\nOnra – Chinoiseries [Reissue/2007] LP (All City)\n\nOnra started the Chinoiseries project in August 2006, freshly returned from a trip to Vietnam, the land of his grandparents. A vinyl junkie at heart, he really couldn’t come back to France without bringing back some wax. After hours spent riding on a motorbike through the streets of Saigon, a taxi finally helped him find some Asian records – he almost felt like an explorer discovering a forgotten treasure. He bought 30 records, most of them in poor condition, went back to his crib and started making beats with material.\n\nOnipa – Off The Grid LP (Real World)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Off The Grid is a journey that joins the origin story of dance rhythms from Africa to electronic dance music of today’s clubs and festivals, connecting African folklore and storytelling to rap, jazz, and hip-hop. From Kinshasa to Kebdrick, Accra Market cassette tapes to London pirate radio stations, Malian blues to UK jazz, this is not a new fusion but a celebration of the family tree of music that has roots in the diaspora.\n\nParcels – Live Vol. 2 2xLP (Because Music)\n\nFollowing Live Vol. 1 released in 2020, Live Vol. 2 offers a different and new artistic proposal. Parcels, as never heard before, reinvent themselves live and adapt their music for the club. Live Vol. 2 was performed and recorded during a secret Paris gig in October 2022.\n\nKaty Perry – One Of The Boys [Reissue/2008] LP (Capitol)\n\nKaty Perry – Teenage Dream [Reissue/2010] 2xLP (Capitol)\n\nKaty Perry – Pr"
