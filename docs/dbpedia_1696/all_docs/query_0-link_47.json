        "text": "PERFECT HITS – The album cover art of the POINTED STICKS! New Wave graphics and classic vinyl design.\n\nSometime during the tranquil 1970’s, Punk Rock came crashing to earth like a cultural meteorite intent on wiping out all the dinosaurs. Punk wasn’t simply another musical movement, it aspired to influence fashion, politics, literature and art. The Sex Pistols revolutionary, “Never Mind The Bollocks” with it’s now classic Jamie Reid designed cover signaled a drastic change to the 70’s rock aesthetic and ushered in a whole new era of graphic design. In less than one year after the Sex Pistols album was released, half a world away in the sleepy cultural backwater of Vancouver, Canada, the Pointed Sticks issued their first 7 inch single, “What Do You Want Me To do?” on fledgling local label Quintessence Records. The 45 single was issued with 5 different D.I.Y. coloured sleeves and the b-side was “Somebody’s Mom”. It was the first ever “production” by a young Bob Rock and it is now a highly sought after collectors item amongst the “Killed by Death” crowd.\n\nPointed Sticks were part of a new wave of West Coast Punk bands that included, The Modernettes, D.O.A., Art Bergmann‘s Young Canadians and The Subhumans, who all released classic albums between 1978 – 1983, albums that were essentially banned from the airwaves by the corporate rock establishment! Despite being shut out of the mainstream, the late 70’s and early 80’s saw an explosion of music released into the underground scene. This was the period that gave birth to the “independent” record label. Alongside the new wave of musical groups came a new wave of graphic designers and artists. Album covers became deliberately loud and colourful to get people’s attention and for the first time in music history, small labels sought to seriously compete with the majors.\n\nOut of London’s mid-seventies “Pub Rock” scene, came Stiff Records. Stiff Records brought the world, the first official punk release (The Damned‘s debut) as well as Elvis Costello, Lene Lovich and Nick Lowe, all in an array of eye catching creative packaging courtesy of their legendary in-house graphics designer, Barney Bubbles. Thanks to small labels like Stiff, picture sleeves and picture discs flooded into the New Wave music market, which upset the majors, because they cost more to produce and reduced their profits!\n\nFittingly, The Pointed Sticks became the first Canadian band to sign to Stiff Records. Stiff released the Brinsley Schwartz produced “Out Of Luck” 7 inch in 1979, but due to the chaotic business practices of the label, the band’s debut was shelved after an aborted session with The Police’s producer, Nigel Grey. Disillusioned, the Pointed Sticks broke up in 1981 after releasing their now seminal power pop debut, “Perfect Youth“. The album cover, as well as the inner sleeve and label, was designed by legendary pop artist Jim “I Braineater” Cummins. Just as the Pointed Sticks had given Bob Rock his start, “Perfect Youth” was Jim Cummins first rock album commission, he went on to create iconic cover art for PURE‘s debut “Pureafunalia” and Skinny Puppys “Too Dark To Park”.\n\nPERFECT YOUTH LP 1980 Quintessence Records\n\n“I remember before I could get the album art finished, we had a Braineaters gig in Edmonton! So the band drove up without me. I flew in the day of the gig and flew back the next morning, finished the album cover and handed it in on Monday just in time for the deadline! The amount I got paid for the album was eaten up by the plane ticket. So I got to play the gig in Edmonton, finished the album artwork and wound up broke. Very rock n roll…” – Jim Cummins\n\n“It just seemed so perfect at the time (no pun intended) for us to have a Jim Cummins cover! Of course, he worked some considerable self promotion into the image as well! The colours are brighter on the original 4′ X 4′ oil painting, which hangs in our ex-managers house, much to my chagrin… I wish it was mine. It was a pretty iconic cover for us. Most people think that the girl on the front is Nancy Gillespie, a scenester from back then, but Jim says its a composite of all the Pointed Sticks girls from that time. And there were lots, we were truly a girls band…” – Nick Jones\n\n“The girl and man are made up. The creature she is drawing is something (…and I do mean something!) that we saw in a alley in the west end. Sandra and I, were going to her place and there it was, it looked at us! We kept driving in shock. We got home and locked all the doors and windows at her place. A couple of weeks later I started the album cover.

Our manager, Steve Macklam came up with that image. The Chinese characters ask the question “Who have you been fucking on the railroad tracks?” The answer of course being Pointed Sticks…” – Nick Jones\n\nReal Thing/Out Of Luck 7″ (Back Cover) 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“Out Of Luck photo by Ron Nelson of Private School.I can’t really remember why we chose this shot, just seemed cool at the time, Gratuitous crotch shot of Tony Bardach.” – Nick Jones\n\nLies 7″ 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“I think we swiped that picture from some comic book…. Quintessence always gave us free reign on any artwork we wanted to use! We had this old drum skin that Ian Tiles found, and loved. I think it was from a Sears catalog drum kit, probably early sixties? That’s the image that was on the bass drum skin.This dates back to the very first weeks of the band, when we were practicing in an old warehouse next to the Sun building. $125 per month for the entire floor, and it had a freight elevator!” – Nick Jones\n\nLies/I’m Numb 7″ (Back Cover) 1979 Quintessence Records\n\n“Sheila Adams, a friend of John Mackies did that drawing.

First time we saw that was when we held the finished record in our hands. There was no emailing graphics for approval back then! Blame Stiff entirely for what was undoubtably the worst graphic in the Pointed Sticks cannon. It’s a terrible photo as well… The shoot was done in Vancouver with a guy called John Sherlock, and the only consolation is that there are far worse shots from that session.” – Nick Jones\n\nPower Pop Santa 7″ 2012 La Ti Da Records\n\n“The “Power Pop Santa” single was recorded as a free download in 2008, La-Ti-Da put it out as a giveaway for the Fall Down, Get Down festival in 2012, which was meant to be our last gig. Not sure why we ever said anything that stupid, except for the fact that we were going through a rough patch at the time. I’m very proud of both sides of that single, its not easy to write an Xmas song! The graphics are all La-Ti-Da… something about “continuity with their brand”?? BTW, that single is completely sold out, and won’ t be reprinted!” – Nick Jones\n\nMy Japanese Fan 7″ 2009 Sudden Death Records\n\n“A Richard Chapman/Ian Tiles collaboration. The whole airmail envelope concept is great, the original Japanese version of the cover is amazing, before the Sudden Death art department got a hold of it and “cleaned it up”. Jeez, it looked that way for a reason!! The song itself was the first original song that the reformed band wrote. It was Gord Nicholl’s idea, inspired by the ridiculous response we got when we first played there, and everyone from the band has at least one line in the lyrics. Nice double entendre as well. Plus the song starts with the chorus, oldest trick in the book. After we had played in Japan, we had realized pretty quickly that playing 25 year old songs was fun, but incapable of sustaining our long term interest. So we wrote that one, and now its 2015 and we’ve put out 2 LPs and 2 singles of new original music.” – Nick Jones\n\nThree Lefts Make A Right LP 2009 Northern Electric\n\n“By this point, Richard Chapman was in control of all the graphics for all things Pointed Sticks. The saying was mine, based on an old North Van story, too long to tell, but if you sketch it out, it is indeed true that 3 lefts do make a right. Obviously a play on “2 wrongs don’t make a right”…. I wanted the cover to look like the original Rueben and the Jets LP, colour and lettering wise, and for it to be a cartoon. The boxing gloves were Richards idea. Again, I love this cover.” – Nick Jones\n\nThe Stiff Sessions CD 2008 Japan\n\n” Its our friend Bernadettes dog Odin. Its actually a re-enactment of what could have been a very unfortunate scene. When we came back from the UK (1980) after making that record, and ultimately having it rejected, we were all at a party at Steve Macklams house one night. He had a cassette dub of the recordings, and Phil Smith decided that he needed to make a copy of it for himself, on the spot. So he made a dub using Macklams double deck (remember those?) and took it home with him when the party was over. The next morning when the Macklams arose, their dog Elvis had taken that specific original cassette and strewn it from one end of the house to another, chewing it to pieces while doing so. The copy Phil made was/is as far as I know, the only one left in existence of those recordings, and what we used to master the CD. So, that music came within hours of being lost forever, and thats what the cover illustrates.” – Nick Jones\n\nThe POINTED STICKS will be performing Saturday Nov. 28th 2015…\n\nPOINTED STICKS – VAMPIRE BATS – POLLY – NERVOUS TALK at THE RICKSHAW!\n\nPOINTED STICKS – VAMPIRE BATS – POLLY – NERVOUS TALK at THE RICKSHAW!\n\nIt’s KOBAN KOMICS!

On Penelope Spheeris’s DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION PART 1, BLACK FLAG and the PIGGY Tour!\n\nOn the 3rd BAD VIBES Podcast, Vampire Bat, Marc Godfrey with the help of Dave Briker (Some Product/Platform) talk to Ron Reyes about the re-release of Penelope Spheeris‘s “The Decline of Western Civilization Part I “, Black Flag, The Early L.A. Punk Scene, The Piggy tour and try to make sense of 35 years of West Coast music history!\n\nThe great rock n’ roll music documentary boom didn’t start until the noughties. It kicked off in 2000 with Julien Temple’s brilliant Sex Pistols film “The Filth And The Fury” and once the floodgates of nostalgia swung open, year after year, we’ve been inundated with a plethora of truly high quality music retrospectives! All this happened as music itself went into “decline”. So far, we’ve spent most of the new millennium looking backwards at what happened in the last century! Oddly before the start of the 2000’s, during rock n’ roll’s actual lifespan, it was slim pickings! Many unsuccessful attempts were made to represent music on the big screen. In the 50’s and 60’s rock n’ roll films were shoddy affairs, usually Juvenile delinquent B-Movies with a morality tale which you had to sit through before you got a glimpse of a Gene Vincent or Little Richard performance. Due to lack of foresight, directors often chose to make cheap exploitative cash-ins, that often trivialized or patronized their subject matter or completely failed to grasp the significance of the music they set about to exploit in the first place. Looking back, rock n’ roll films were often only “green lit” in order to earn a quick buck from a youth market that most movie executives couldn’t begin to comprehend. Movies like, “Rock N’ Roll High School” or “The Girl Can’t Help It” are redeemed only by the quality of the artist’s music that was featured in them. By the late 70’s, a tradition of “rocksploitation” was firmly entrenched, but every now and then a true classic would manage to slip through (Like Quadrophenia or A Hard Days Night). Rock n’ Roll tended to fare slightly better when film makers attempted to view their subjects through a documentary lens, The Beatles “Let It Be“, Dylan‘s “Don’t Look Back“, Scorsese‘s masterful “Last Waltz“, The Who‘s “Kids Are Alright“, the Rolling Stones “Gimme Shelter” and “Cocksucker Blues” were all low budget masterpieces that were made under rocksploitation criteria but ambitiously attempted to transcend the limitations of the genre. However compared to the documentaries that have come out over the last 15 years, all those classic films look aged and feel downright primitive! In my estimation, one of the greatest rock n’ roll films from that era ever made was, Penelope Spheeris‘s “The Decline of Western Civilization Part I “!\n\nRon hanging in the Church, Jealous Again EP, The Decline Trilogy\n\nReleased in 1981 The Decline of Western Civilization Part I was intended to be a Roger Corman quickie, It documented the birth of L.A.’s vibrant Punk Scene, and introduced an unsuspecting world to the singular talents of the Germs, X, Black Flag, FEAR and Circle Jerks­ and gave Reagan era audiences their first exposure to slam dancing and mosh pits! Punk Rock was still a folk devil at the time and the film did absolutely nothing to reassure conservative parents confused and concerned with this alarmingly nihilistic new fashion and music trend spreading amongst their children. Punk was the culmination of all the rebellious youth movements that had preceded it, deeply anti-authoritarian, truly dangerous and most frighteningly… uncontrollable! What the film captured was a youthful music and art scene that was on the rise and staunchly independent. A scene that had broken away with all the entertainment traditions that came before it. Right under the nose of the Hollywood entertainment system, kids managed to create a new incomprehensible subculture of their own.\n\nThe original soundtrack album on SLASH, Red Kross promo pic.\n\nRiot on Sunset strip.\n\nTo add to the trepidation and hysteria felt by the older generation in regard to this oddly attired new subculture, the film’s premiere was a messy one. The LAPD dispatched 300 motorcycle cops, to control the hordes of Punks who turned up on Sunset Strip. After a near riot ensued, Daryl Gates, the city’s notoriously conservative, corrupt and racist police chief, wrote a letter demanding that the film never be shown in the city again! This was the start of a long violent turf war ,between the LAPD and Punk… unfortunately for Black Flag the venues the band played became the Cops favored battlefields. Looking back now, the film still stands out. It was a document of the last true Art for Art’s sake explosion to hit the music world. Interestingly, just 7 years later, in “The Decline of Western Civilization Part 2 – The Metal Years” it’s back to business as usual for the Hollywood Entertainment factory. All the power that the corporate music world had lost in 1980 had been regained. It’s evident in the contrast of attitudes between the bands and fans in the two movies. Everyone in the first film come across as enigmatic and heroic in comparison to the sad fame hungry sunset strip glam rockers in the second.\n\nEugene Tatu “I hang around by myself a lot.”\n\nFor years, “The Decline of Western Civilization Part I ” was a underground cult favorite. Just like any rapper can instantly give you 20 “Scarface” quotes, a true Punk (Who isn’t a Poser!) should have no difficulty rattling off a “Eugene” imitation or doing the Kickboy Face speech about “New Wave”. The Decline has stood the test of time as an important and influential moment in rock n’ roll cinema. One of it’s accidental “stars” was a young Ron Reyes. Ron was the second vocalist for Black Flag, he replaced Keith Morris who had just left to form the Circle Jerks. Black Flag and Circle Jerks marked a move in direction away from the Hollywood scene which carried more art school pretensions and had it’s roots in 70’s glam. The new “hardcore” was more of a suburban voice, and as the 80’s progressed they would be at the forefront of a scene that would slowly spread across North America and eventually break into the mainstream 10 long years after the Decline‘s release. NIRVANA was the band that finally broke “American” Punk. A telling testament to the influence of the original scene and movie, was when Kurt Cobain drafted Pat Smear of the Germs into Nirvana as a second guitarist, once NIRVANA had become successful.\n\nCRASH BANG CRUNCH POP poster, Decline Interview segment, Ange Trash!\n\nRon Reyes was in Black Flag at a very crucial stage of the bands history. Their inclusion in the film, featured a blistering performance and a tour of the bands legendary practice/party pad “the Church” and was essentially the first real exposure the band would receive. It raised the bands profile enough to allow them to tour. It was on one of those early jaunts up the west coast that Ron discovered Vancouver, Canada. Before leaving Black Flag, he contributed vocals to their classic Jealous Again EP and played drums on the Redd Kross debut. Ron continued with various projects based out of Vancouver, where he’s been an integral player in the cities indie scene since the 80’s. In 2011, Ron was again called upon to take part in a punk rock documentary, this time around in Susan Tabata‘s “Bloodied but Unbowed“, which looks at the early Vancouver scene.\n\nMost recently, Ron took time off from his current project PIGGY to take part in the ill fated BLACK FLAG reunion. In 2013, Greg Ginn decided to take some recordings that he and Ron had been casually collaborating on and make a BLACK FLAG album out of them. Suddenly, the band was out on tour again supporting “What The…“. However, Ron found himself dragged into a messy situation as Greg Ginn battled it out with his estranged former band members also touring under the name FLAG. The whole confusing affair played out in the music media, and Ron dramatically exited the band while they were on tour in Australia. Back in Vancouver, with no more distractions coming from the SST crowd, Ron re-focused on PIGGY who have just debuted a video, compiled a limited edition CD and are currently on their first West Coast Tour!\n\nPIGGY ON FACEBOOK!\n\nPenelope Spheeris‘ “The Decline Of Western Civilization” deluxe box is out now! “The Decline Of Western Civilization” (1980), “The Decline Of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years” (1988) and “The Decline Of Western Civilization Part III” (1998), a 40-page book containing an essay written by rock historian Domenic Priore (“Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock ‘N’ Roll’s Last Stand In Hollywood”), rare stills, and bonus features, including extended interviews, a commentary recorded by Dave Grohl.\n\nSALLY DIGE Interview! Berlin vs. Vancouver and her new album for Night School Records!\n\nIt’s the 2nd BAD VIBES Radio PODCAST, This time round Vampire Bat, Marc sits down with his old pal, Danish/Canadian Musician and Artist, Sally Dige Jørgensen who relocated to Berlin 2 years ago. Sally used to front PETROLEUM BY PRODUCT, a gang of teenage post-punks whose debut release “Superficial Artificial” ambitiously tried to kick start a new, New Wave in Vancouver back in 2008. Upon completing her studies at Emily Carr, She moved from Vancouver to Berlin where she quickly found an receptive audience and is fast becoming a rising star in the European Dark Wave scene! Her first single came out on Greece’s Fabrika Records and is in it’s second run.

Spokesperson, Michele Greene said it was “time for consumers to put a little bit of rebellion in their pocket” and “The Sex Pistols challenged convention and the established ways of thinking – just as we are doing today in our quest to shake up UK banking.” WTF? Really? Is banking hip and ready to shake things up? Are they suddenly on the side of the working class and have our best interests in mind? In light of everything that has happened since the financial meltdown in 2007, this seems to be pretty vacant thinking. Hasn’t it been the collusion of Banks and Politicians that has obliterated the “working class” and left us with “working poor” instead? If Michele Greene had bothered to look at the lyrics of “Anarchy In The UK”, she might have noticed that the song was a declaration of war against everything she stands for!\n\nAligning “Anarchy” and “Sex Pistols” with a financial lending institution is nonsensical and deeply incongruous. Unless of course, the card is literally for Anarchists and it’s purpose is to offer a line of credit to individuals who wish to buy bombs in order to wage a class war against capitalist bankers, the bourgeoisie ruling class and the royal family! Anarchist, Pierre Proudhon famously stated that, “Property is Theft.” so I don’t think he would have approved of the variable 18.9% APR or even the idea of making any payments at all! Mind you, I’m sure the organizers of the 1920 bomb attack on Wall Street would have loved to have had a credit card… perhaps with the extra funding they wouldn’t have missed J.P. Morgan their target. Disappointingly, the card isn’t espousing anarchy but aimed at a demographic creeping into their 60’s who’ve long forgotten the values and ideals of their youth. The card is an inept attempt at historical revisionism that trivializes the phrase “Anarchy In The UK” into essentially meaning the same thing as Miley Cyrus‘s “Party In The USA”. It’s not a tribute… it’s utter bollocks. A lot has happened to tarnish the Sex Pistols credibility, Lydon doing adverts for butter, Cook playing drums in Bananarama, and their 1996 reunion tour which was an obvious cash grab, but it made sense. Punk Rock’s righteous idealism died the day that, long time Pistol fan, Kurt Cobain blew his brains out… after that it was Green Day‘s Dookie and Modern Rock Radio. The 90’s music industry was all about taking whatever you could get and getting as much as you could take! Thanks to the self serving P.R. and delusions of their manager Malcolm McLaren, who cast himself as the mastermind behind the band while neglecting to keep watch of their business, the Pistols spent 10 years in the courts trying to retrieve their unpaid royalties. Malcolm also dishonestly created the misconception that they were nothing more than a prefabricated boy band. The only thing the Pistols had in common with boy bands was their youth (Johnny Rotten was 19 when he wrote the song). “Anarchy In The UK” is not an easily digestible pop throw away. It’s a song with a huge statement, a huge message and huge implications. The only statement their contemporaries the Bay City Rollers could ever muster was “Shang A Lang”. On Friday, Nov 26 1976 EMI Records (Not Virgin.) unleashed “Anarchy In The UK” on Britain causing instant furore among the country’s establishment, due to the blatant and unprecedented language in the song being employed to attack them. Two months later the band would appear on the Bill Grundy show. The infamous telly incident that thrust them into the nation’s tabloids. Overnight, the Sex Pistols were Britain’s public enemy No 1… the “Anarchy” single however had only just made it to No. 38 on the charts before it was pulled and the band found themselves sacked by EMI. “Anarchy In The UK” was a dangerous record and the ruling class reacted with numerous attempts to censor the band. The single was the musical equivalent of A Clockwork Orange! In 1976 there was nothing to compare it to… it was an influential record that opened the floodgate to the 80’s and beyond. Without it there would have been no Clash or U2 or Replacements or Duran Duran or Oasis or Libertines or Nick Cave or Nirvana. Actually there is no artist or band worth mentioning in the 40 years that followed the release of Never Mind The Bollocks that wasn’t influenced by the Sex Pistols! “Anarchy In The UK” was a truly revolutionary song, that called for a revolution and actually achieved it’s goal.\n\nThe most ironic thing about all this is, due to the firmly entrenched class system of 70’s Britain, none of the Sex Pistols at that time could get a bank account, much less a line of credit. Steve Jones and Paul Cook robbed everything they needed, Johnny Rotten took speed to stave off hunger pangs and Sid… well, the night that Nancy got stabbed, he was carrying 5000 dollars in cash because he still hadn’t managed to get a bank account and the money was mysteriously stolen. Sid Vicious wasn’t exactly “credit card” material.\n\n“Anarchy” was an important song… no one would be talking about it 40 years later if it wasn’t! “Anarchy In The UK” isn’t about reckless spending and pocket book rebellion that you can’t actually afford. Back when the song was on the charts, the number 1 was “Under The Moon Of Love” by a band called Showaddywaddy. Never heard of it? Me neither. To truly comprehend how offensive and inappropriate this Master Card/ Virgin Money venture is, one simply needs to take a quick look at the “Anarchy In The UK” lyric sheet. Does this sound like a quest to shake up UK banking? So…\n\nRight!\n\nnow ha ha ha ha ha…\n\nI am an antichrist\n\nI am an anarchist\n\nDon’t know what I want\n\nBut I know how to get it\n\nI wanna destroy passerby\n\n(One of the greatest opening couplets in rock n’ roll, followed by a menacing threat! “I wanna destroy passerby” is pure Clockwork Orange. Essentially Mr. Lydon is saying that he’s lawless, ungovernable and espouses random violence toward innocent victims. 🙂 Now that’s how you start a song!!)\n\nCause I wanna be Anarchy\n\nNo dogsbody!\n\n(Mentioning “Dogsbody” is a very class conscious lyric. A dogsbody is a servant of a servant. The lowest on the pecking order.)\n\nAnarchy for the UK\n\nIt’s coming sometime and maybe\n\nI give a wrong time stop at traffic line\n\nYour future dream is a shopping scheme\n\n(Well this verse is relevant to this Master Card nonsense…It’s about his disdain for mindless empty consumerism and the trap of debt.)\n\n‘Cause I wanna be Anarchy\n\nIn the city\n\n(The “City” represented danger and excitement in the days before CCTV. The Pistols playground was an urban environment. Might as well own your streets when you can’t own anything else!)\n\nMany ways to get what you want\n\nI use the best\n\nI use the rest\n\nI use the Enemy\n\nI use Anarchy\n\n(Not only is Johnny Rotten a dangerous, intelligent and articulate working class youth, he won’t be patronized. This is the instruction manual part of the song. Helpful hints for others who may be interested…)\n\n‘Cause I wanna be Anarchy\n\nIt’s the only way to be\n\n(He’s selling it now… This Anarchy stuff is beginning to sound pretty good!)\n\nIs this the M.P.L.A or\n\n(MPLA fought for the independence of Angola against Portuguese colonial rule. In the 70’s South Africa intervened militarily in the bloody conflict. South Africa was supported by Western banks.)\n\nIs this the U.D.A or\n\nIs this the I.R.A\n\n(70’s Britain was quite stressed out by IRA terrorism as the Northern Ireland conflict raged on. The Ulster Defense Association was responsible for murders, kidnappings, massacres and a prolific amount of sectarian violence. John Lydon was Irish Catholic. He grew up seeing “No Dogs No Blacks No Irish” signs around London which later became the title of his autobiography.)\n\nI thought it was the UK\n\nOr just another country\n\nAnother council tenancy\n\n(Refers to the poverty on England’s estates and the empire’s decline. Poor housing estates have only gotten worse since the 70’s. There is now no chance of upward mobility. Those were the people rioting in 2011. They are called the “underclass” rather than working class now.)\n\nI wanna be Anarchy\n\nAnd I wanna be Anarchy\n\n(Blatant rabble rousing… Class War, isn’t really boy band fare is it?)\n\nAnd I wanna be anarchist\n\nget pissed, destroy!\n\n(Conclusion; The song recommends against accruing credit card debt. Suggests you destroy a bank instead.)\n\nBurlesque Scream Queens and Gothic Mayhem… The SHADOW LINE Revisited!\n\nShadow Line Promo Video\n\nThe SHADOW LINE at the WALDORF HOTEL was possibly the most ambitious 80’s Goth revival night to ever hit Vancouver. It was created by Virginia Frazer and the VAMPIRE BATS and ran successfully through 2012. For the hip subculture denizens who managed to transcend the jaded cynicism of our “No Fun” City reputation… The SHADOW LINE was a revelation! I had one of my favourite local photographers Sarah “Beastman” Hamilton come out and document the July 26th edition! It was a particularly action packed evening. The guest DJ was Phil Western aka DJ PHILTH best known as a member of SKINNY PUPPY side project, DOWNLOAD. The bill also featured a musical performance by ARSENIC OF JABIR which was an abstract electro-wave project, conceived by multi-instrumentalist, Tristan Finck. But what really tipped the event into the realm of surreal Gothic Anarchy was a brilliant routine that fell into that hazy category between Burlesque and Performance Art by the always enigmatic SPOOKSY DELUNE and scream queen actress TRISTAN RISK !

BAD VIBES Podcast interview with Donal Finn.\n\nFlash Bastard 2015\n\nLos Angeles based label, METROPOLIS RECORDS is currently home to GARY NUMAN, BAUHAUS, GANG OF FOUR, MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE, SKINNY PUPPY, ELECTRIC SIX and now Vancouver’s FLASH BASTARD! METROPOLIS is one of the few labels left operating on the notion that signing decent music is a worthwhile endeavour. After what has been the 10 most catastrophic years in the history of music, we’re left with a cynical and poverty stricken music business landscape that will only put money into what it feels is mainstream and “no risk”. Sadly what that means is only the lowest common denominator is ever catered to. Gone are the days when a band like The Clash could be signed. Realistically, in 2015, nobody that matters can be signed. From Bob Dylan to The Beatles to The Sex Pistols to Nirvana… by the standards of today’s climate, none of those artists would stand a chance! Thankfully a handful of labels still exist, METROPOLIS being one of the best among them. So after years of watching the FLASH BASTARD saga unfold it’s nice to finally see them join an impressive roster.\n\nClockwise; Flash Bastard reunion at the Rickshaw Theatre, In Los Angeles 2014, The Bastards redecorate the Scorpion’s dressing room and German-Canadian relations hit lowest point since wartime.\n\nFLASH BASTARD came out of the late 90’s Canadian punk rock booze can scene. The early shows were chaotic, messy and sometimes violent affairs. The band made an immediate impression on the Vancouver scene, due to the force of their personalities… unfortunately, for many people it wasn’t a positive impression, thanks to the combination of teenage testosterone and pre-facebook lack of discretion. The classic line up was Donal Finn, Pete Mills, Danny Fazio and Shawn Mrazek and I can attest that they were a handful back in the day. One of the first big shows they played was with my old band, PSYCHOMANIA at the notorious strip club, The Penthouse for the aptly named Anarchy In BC.\n\nAnarchy in BC full page Discorder Ad, Teenage Bastard.\n\nBack in the mid to late 90’s, there was a veritable explosion of doomed post-grunge bands that sprung up in the sleepy port city of Vancouver. In a reaction to the dressed down slacker sensibilities of the Seattle Grunge scene, Vancouver dressed up and drew on a New York influenced style of Punk rock n’ roll and British Glam! FLASH BASTARD were one of the best bands of that era, as well as one of the most unpredictable. I remember getting a copy of the bands demo tape which was “produced” by Tom Anselmi (SLOW) and Jamey Kosh, and instantly knowing that they actually had the talent and songwriting chops to back up all their swagger (They’ve always had a strange fixation on KISS, which I could never understand!). I was instantly hooked by their first song, “C’mon” which was a punk rock re-write of Bowie’s “Hang On To Yourself”.\n\n“Looking good boys, now can you hold that pose for 10 years?”\n\nBefore they managed to fuck everything up, they did accomplish quite a bit in a short period. They developed a solid following, they got a couple interviews broadcast on Much Music whenever there was a slow news day and they made an excellent, classic video with director Rebecca Russell-Martin for “Rock N’ Roll Must Be Destroyed”. Pete and Danny enjoyed a brief cameo playing themselves in Bruce McDonald’s truly awful film “Hard Core Logo”… I recently tried watching it again and it remains truly awful. In 2000 the band signed to MOTLEY CRUE bass player, Nikki Sixx’s Americoma label. Unfortunately, It was a classic case of too much too soon, and in a spectacularly short time period, FLASH BASTARD‘s teenage delinquent behaviour, proved to be too much for Mr. Sixx to handle. The band famously managed to get themselves thrown off a tour opening for MOTLEY CRUE and The SCORPIONS and have their album shelved indefinitely by the label.\n\nDonal with Friends, Donal with no friends, Pete Mills on LATV 2006.\n\nWhile Flash Bastard were busy fucking up their music careers up in Vancouver, I was busy doing the same down in Los Angeles. I had caused a big buzz with my project, SOUL KID #1 and was courted by Interscope and Warner Bros. before signing to Dreamworks. After making my debut album, I recruited Donal down to Hollywood to play bass. Since I was on a major, they made me audition him. So after a parade of excellent bass players, Donal walks in the room, demands to play bass “acapella” and then proceeds to pluck out perhaps the most amateur version of “Louie Louie” ever, while my A & R department watched politely aghast. After weeks of arguments, Donal was eventually “allowed” into my band. But the die had been cast for me and the suits never quite understood my sense of humour, shortly after Donal had joined, my relationship with Dreamworks started to nosedive!\n\nWith Marc Godfrey (Soul Kid #1) on LATV 2006, Donal learns that Marxism has nothing to do with Harpo!\n\nFlash Bastard guitarist, Pete Mills also followed the musical migration south and set up in California… by 2007 it was getting crowded with Canadians down there so I thought it would be a good idea to go back to Vancouver for awhile. Without my coat tails to ride on, Donal and Pete were forced to reconcile their differences and after 10 years of sitting on the shelf, Nikki gave them back their long lost album. In 2011 France’s Black Cat Records finally released Flash Bastard’s debut album “Rock N’ Roll Must Be Destroyed”! Ironically, rock n’ roll had been destroyed over the previous decade. The music business went down as quickly as the dinosaurs did when a meteor hit the planet. The rise of free downloads and streaming, had systematically obliterated rock n’ roll and in 2015 making music is no longer a viable profession for those who weren’t already independently wealthy.\n\nWild the new album, Donal has his ballsack adjusted for photoshoot.\n\nSo here we are, after 15 years of riding the music business roller coaster, I sit down with Donal Finn for an informal look back at our misspent youth in the Vancouver post grunge punk rock n’ roll scene, our experiences and escapades in Hollywood, our participation in the Nikki Sixx sex tape, and the making of the new album “Wild”!

Well it’s happened, recently, long time Los Angeles Scenesters, Amelia G and Forrest Black oversaw the publication of their “California Deathrock” book, a glossy overview of the subculture that evolved out of the early L.A. punk scene and recently has been enjoying a revival on the west coast. This time around however, I don’t see this as a nail in a budding scene’s coffin but more as a reaffirmation that, what a handful of artists have been pushing toward for the last 5 years is now a true growing cultural concern!\n\nCalifornia Deathrock book, Christian Death Pins, Deathrock fashionista.\n\nUp here in the unforgiving North, the underground has had a thriving Deathrock / Gothic / Darkwave community for years… The mainstream constantly pushes forward the image of “lumbersexuals” and coffee shop folkies, but in truth the Pacific Northwest is more metropolitan and anti social. The scene has remained subterranean largely due to our mainstream media outlets ignoring it. New artists and musicians have been operating in a vacuum, and with no one to please but themselves, we’ve seen the return of dangerous dark music as well as dangerous dark styles! All that is missing is the real violence and menace that permeated the early eighties scene… but alas, you can’t expect to have it all!\n\nSally Dige & Marc Godfrey outside Shadow Line (In an Italian article!), Early Dark Noise pioneer Dandi Wind on tour with The Horrors, The Vampire Bats and Shadow Line Poster.\n\nThe sea change first started around 5 years ago, with a collective rejection of bearded indie folk and coachella style hipsters who despite all the instagram selfies they were taking, somehow remained oblivious to how mainstream and boring they were! Vancouver and Portland have emerged as hotspots for a new Deathrock / Dark Wave / Gothic underground. Goth by the late 90’s had devolved and deviated into an embarrassing caricature of itself, terrible cyber footwear, Hot Topic accessories, and awful bands that drew upon Nu Metal and Modern Rock… Is it any wonder that Columbine happened? Over the last 6 years, the new scene has been placing it’s emphasis on it’s obscure 80’s roots before it was hijacked by MTV frat boy mentality! In isolated yet urban, Vancouver we’ve seen the resurgence growing gradually and organically in our music and fashion. At the start of the decade, the musical landscape seemed to be hopelessly, bleak and bearded with a million bands that sounded like Mumford & Sons all jostling for an ipod commercial, now more and more bands seem to have seen the light and are drawing on 80’s Goth, Post Punk, Dark Wave and Deathrock influences.\n\nI will always remember where I was on 9/11 (With the Human League!), Portland’s Shadowhouse\n\nDeathrock BC DJ’s Batt Fink and Pentagram, Repossession Poster w/ Infidel, Spectres.\n\nVancouver’s SPECTRES made their debut in 2007 with their “Cold War” EP and then in 2010 released a true classic… “Last Days”. Their latest album, “Nothing To Nowhere” continues the band’s winning streak in absolutely nailing the Deathrock genre! Vancouver has been leading the charge in dark music, with a particularly prolific amount of new bands, WHITE LUNG, MODE MODERNE, ACTORS, TERROR BIRD, ANIMAL BODIES, VAMPIRE BATS and PETROLEUM BY-PRODUCT to name a few. The now defunct, dark wave revivalists Petroleum By-Product spawned SALLY DIGE, who relocated to Berlin and has just released her debut album on Night School Records. This month’s issue of the NME has picked her as a buzz worthy artist. Petroleum bassist, Vanessa Turner is often found DJing alongside TERROR BIRD frontwoman Nikki Nevver at the DARK 80’s, a night that just keeps growing in popularity! Sally Dige’s sister Johannah Jørgensen relocated to Copenhagen and formed METRO CULT who’s debut EP has just come out on the excellent Mass Media Records. Mass Media is also home to notable Portland band SHADOWHOUSE, who along with BELLICOSE MINDS are two of the best of the city’s scene!\n\nPortland’s Bellicose Minds.\n\nSpectres, Nikki Nevver Terror Bird, Metro Cult.\n\nOne of the early influential catalysts of the revival in Vancouver of the new Gothic Deathrock scene was the monthly SHADOW LINE night that ran throughout 2012 at the now defunct Waldorf hotel. Created by THE VAMPIRE BATS and Virginia Fraser, the SHADOW LINE played host to past, present and future talents from the city’s Goth, Punk and Arts scene! The SHADOW LINE featured guest DJ’s and live performances and the most over the top, elaborate “Bat Cave” decorations in clubland. Each event was like walking onto a movie set or art installation. We managed to create a Gothic Wonderland and were able to promote some of the city’s most deserving and enigmatic artists, DJ Philth (Download, Skinny Puppy), Dandi Wind (Fan Death), Bloody Betty, The Vampire Bats, Spooksy Delune, DJ Vortex, I Braineater, DJ Contrasoma (Sanctuary), Sally Dige, Arsenic Of Jabir, Viktor Kuhn and many more… sadly, just when we confirmed Daniel Ash to DJ, the Waldorf was shut down during a much publicized dispute with condo developers, Solterra!\n\nVampire Bats at The Rickshaw, Spooksy Delune and Sally Dige.\n\nThe Shadow Line’s run had an subtle impact on influencing the city’s burgeoning black clad culture… It was the first club night in town to start mixing in harder edged Deathrock with the more traditional Gothic dance staples that could be heard at nights like SANCTUARY. After that came Deathrock BC’s ill fated, REPOSSESSION and DARK 80”s. The DARK 80‘s at the Astoria has become the natural successor to the Shadow Line. One of the best moments for me at the SHADOW LINE, came when I was Djing… I followed up 45 GRAVE‘s “Evil” with the BIRTHDAY PARTY‘s “Sonny’s Burning” for a packed pogo-ing room and realized that for the first time, that song had somehow become a dance floor crowd pleaser! Right after that, I suggested to GOTHIC BC website curator Michael Barrick that perhaps we should think about making a coffee (Coffin) table book…\n\nSPECTRES & BELLICOSE MINDS will be playing at THE DARK 80’s Friday May 22nd!\n\nSPECTRES ON FACEBOOK!\n\nLinks!\n\nCALIFORNIA DEATHROCK\n\nSPECTRES\n\nSHADOWHOUSE\n\nVAMPIRE BATS\n\nGOTHIC BC\n\nCVLT NATION\n\nSALLY DIGE\n\nTERROR BIRD\n\nBELLICOSE MINDS\n\nMETRO CULT\n\nDRBC – DEATHROCK BC\n\nTHE DARK EIGHTIES ASTORIA\n\nCOMING SOON – An Unpublished SHADOW LINE Photo Gallery!\n\nVampire Bats plan Video for College Radio #1 – “Back In The 604”!\n\nNot too long ago, The VAMPIRE BATS reached number 1 at CITR (Vancouver’s College radio station)… mind you, it was due to our inclusion on Northern Electric‘s wonderful compilation CD, “EAST VAN SPECIAL BLEND” and we did have a little help from a few other artists, which included the legendary Pointed Sticks, Polly, Kelly Haigh, Mac Pontaic and Butch Murphy… but in this day in age when airplay is more dependent on the amount of payola a band is willing to cough up, you take what you can get and anybody who knows me, knows I love a good group effort and enjoy a bit of scene building as opposed to condo building! You can grab a copy of the CD here at Northern Electric… http://northern-electric.ca/\n\nHere’s some great live footage of the Bats performing “Back In The 604” shot by Rod Matheson for his ambitious “Every Day Music” project!\n\nSpurred on by this and the slow burning success of the debut album “Cemetery”, a video is in the works for Mark Henning’s (Combine The Victorious, PURE) EDM remix of the track “Back In The 604”. The Vampire Bats debut EP has received great reviews and more importantly the title track, which is a reworking of a song originally recorded by Canadian Indie pioneers DEJA VOODOO, got an enthusiastic thumbs up from it’s composer Gerard Van Herk! https://soundcloud.com/secret-agent-records/cemetery-the-vampire-bats\n\nReview from The Province Newspaper… VAMPIRE BATS on BANDCAMP!\n\nBLOODY BETTY – LOVE HURTS ! Gorelesque Provocateurs ready to invade No. 5 ORANGE!\n\nModel, dancer, singer, entertainer, Bloody Betty is Vancouver’s sleazy punk rock renaissance woman who over the past few years has been behind some of the cities most outrageous events! Since the founding of her performance group, Bloody Betty & the Deadly Sins, she has managed to invent her own sub genre of burlesque, the much messier and more disturbing – Gorelesque! On the west coast, she has garnered a reputation for pushing the envelope and gleefully smashing taboos. Her shows walk a line of inappropriateness, due to her nonchalance toward using gratuitous violence and nudity in her performances. I’ve collaborated with Betty on a number of projects and I can attest that the girls got quite a set of balls on her… and that’s what I like to see in a woman! (Hmm, That sentence didn’t quite come out right… 🙂 ) Betty and her troupe seek to shock and titillate, using some pretty stunning visuals, make up and special f/x, it’s definitely fun fringe entertainment for those with less mainstream sensibilities.\n\nThe No. 5 Orange, by contrast, is part of the old school tradition of Vancouver Strip clubs. It is one of the few clubs still standing after the glory days of the late 80’s when Motley Crue immortalized our “peeler” scene with their “Girls Girls Girls” video and Bon Jovi was inspired to name his album “Slippery When Wet” after a tattoo he saw on one of our dancers. At the peak in the mid 80’s Vancouver boasted around 30 bars with exotic dancing… today only 5 remain. There are innumerable reasons for the disappearance of Vancouver’s strip clubs, from simple mismanagement and the rising costs of real estate to the pre-Olympics crack down on the shady organized crime element that surrounded the industry, but the true death knell seems to have been that they simply went out of fashion as moral attitudes shifted. Ironically, one of the factors for their decline was the rise in popularity of burlesque striptease artists who are perceived as more empowered and less exploited than the exotic dancers who came before them.\n\nOn Tuesday February 17th, these two cultures collide! Bloody Betty‘s Anti-Valentines Day edition of Tales From The Strip invades one of the last bastions of traditional sleaze… the No. 5 Orange! It will be interesting to see how the “over the top” performances of burlesque stars, Lola Danielle Frost, Nicky Nine Doors and Bloody Betty go down with the No. 5 Oranges’ regular patrons, not to mention the dancers that usually work there! Don’t miss this spectacle of blood and full nudity! The girls are going into the heart of sleaze as performance art provocateurs to put some hip back into strip!\n\nLOVE HURTS! TUESDAY FEB 17th\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1569308926648455/"
