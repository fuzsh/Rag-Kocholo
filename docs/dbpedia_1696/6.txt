Canadian punk band from Vancouver, British Columbia formed in the Spring of 1978 and originally active until Fall 1982, reuniting briefly in 1995 for a tour and again 2005 - 2010. Later releases used the name [b]Subhumans Canada[/b]. [b]Not to be confused with the long-standing UK punk rock band, [a=Subhumans].[/b] The Subhumans were formed in 1978 by Brian "Wimpy Roy" Goble (vocals), Mike "Normal" Graham (guitar), Gerry "Useless" Hannah (bass), and Ken "Dimwit" Montgomery (drums). Shortly after their first single, Dimwit departed and was replaced by Koichi "Jim" Imagawa. The band released their first full-length, [m=275135] in 1980. Afterwards, Hannah and Imagawa departed and were replaced by Ron Allan (bass) and Randy Bowman (drums). The new lineup signed with [l=SST Records] and recorded the [m=530371] LP in 1982. However, at the end of 1982, just prior to the record's release, the group split when Brian Goble left the band to join [a=D.O.A. (2)]. In 1995, the band reformed for a tour of western Canada. The lineup was Brian Goble, Gerry Hannah, Ron Allan and Randy Bowman, joined by Jon Williams on guitar. The compilation, [m=1489026], which included live recordings from the 1995 tour, was released the following year. In 2005, Goble, Hannah, and Graham reformed with drummer Jon Card. The group released their first album of new material, [m=158623] on [l=Alternative Tentacles] in 2006. In 2010, the group released [m=247479], a re-recording of their debut LP. Later that same year, the group disbanded.
