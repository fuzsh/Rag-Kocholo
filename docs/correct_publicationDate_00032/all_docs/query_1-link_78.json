J. Cherryh\n\nRegrettably, I have not yet had an opportunity to write an essay on this author, but the “Other Resources” section below will lead you to some information about the “Notable Books” listed farther down this page.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nOther C. J. Cherryh Resources\n\n(Meaningless aside: why do so many people have trouble understanding that initials are separate entities?\n\nWould those who blithely write—or type—“C.J.” also write, or type, “CarolynJanice”? Sigh.)\n\nC. J. Cherryh Resources on the Web\n\nCherryh has her own site, Welcome to C. J. Cherryh’s Worlds, but it hasn’t been updated since 2012; the current action is at her blog, Wave Without a Shore (though she also has a Facebook page). Another good resource is the C. J. Cherryh entry at The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. There are a couple of dedicated fan sites: Alliance-Union (with a wiki structure), and Meetpoint Station (which seems moribund). There is a set of Cherryh discussion forums.\n\nAn interesting biography of Cherryh, The Worlds of C. J. Cherryh, by Andrew Liptak, appears on the Kirkus web site. Another take on Cherryh’s fiction is available at “The Imaginary Realms of Gilbert M. Stack”.\n\nOther useful pages that deal with Cherryh’s work in general (as opposed to particular books) include “claustrophobic but cool” [archived copy]; “C J Cherryh: The Outcast and the Uncertain Mind”; “C. J. Cherryh’s Fiction” [archived copy]; “C. J. Cherryh, Science Fiction, and the Soft Sciences” [archived copy]; and “Military Command in Women’s Science Fiction: C. J. Cherryh’s Signy Mallory” [archived copy].\n\nOne other interesting resource is “Maps of C. J. Cherryh’s Fiction”, where “You can visually compare the position of places mentioned in C. J. Cherryh’s fiction relating to the Alliance/Union universe and consult a chronological summary of events related to each site.”\n\nAnd an interesting sidelight is a succinct essay by Cherryh, “Writerisms and other Sins: A Writer’s Shortcut to Stronger Writing”, whose title is self-descriptive.\n\nThere’s lots more: Google Is Your Friend.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nI could find none.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nNotable Science-Fiction and Fantasy Books by C.
