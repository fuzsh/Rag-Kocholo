        "text": "I don't really have alot to go on since I have only attempted her Faded Sun trilogy but I was bored out of my mind. Somebody must like her stuff though or it wouldn't still be available.\n\nI do!\n\nI first started reading Cherryh back in 1980 or so, and haven't really stopped. Nor do I plan to. To my mind, she's one of the best authors science fiction or fantasy has to offer.\n\nIf you're looking for a good place to start, I'd suggest the Morgaine series. It's more or less the first thing she wrote, and it's a cross between fantasy and science fiction. It's here in a handy omnibus edition:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Morgaine-Saga...r_1_19?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253849768&sr=8-19\n\nI should point out that, years later, Cherryh wrote a final volume in the series called Exile's Gate, which is not included in this collection. You may or may not want to read that; certainly the original trilogy is fine on its own.\n\nHas anyone here read Cherryh's Fortress series? I picked up the first volume (Fortress in the Eye of Time) a decade ago, but have never gotten around to reading it. The premise looks interesting and it might be a decent fantasy series to jump into, though reviews seem to be mixed (mainly regarding the pacing and wordiness of the books).\n\nYes, I read that too. The first book, Fortress in the Eye of Time, is excellent, on a par with anything Cherryh had done before. The further volumes, though, begin to meander a bit - you need to keep apace with the way she's writing, and that isn't always easy (things are slow and deliberately obtuse). It's a good series, though, and Tristan is a remarkable character.\n\nBy all means read this - it's rather wonderful, in a very Cherryh sort of way (i.e. rather whimsical and poetic, and occasionally a litttle disjointed). But it's not where I'd start.\n\nI've read the first three of the Fortress series, which basically forms a full story, then there are two more. The first one, Fortress in the Eye of Time, is excellent. Essentially, you get to see things from the golem's perspective. The second one, Fortress of Eagles, meanders into a not that captivating suspense mystery -- Tristan has to figure out a political and magical situation he's not prepared for -- but critical information for the overall story does come up. The third one, Fortress of Owls, I thought was good, if not quite as good as the first one, and brings Tristan to the critical turning point of the question of what will be his fate.\n\nI also like Cherryh's Rusalka trilogy, which is based in historical Russia, because I like how she does the characters and dialogue, and I liked the setting. My favorite of hers so far is Angel with the Sword. Unfortunately, in my view, she threw that world open to her buddies to play with in a shared universe of anthology stories, like Thieves World, and since her buddies were/are leading fantasy writers, the stories are excellent and I have some of the volumes, but I really wanted Cherryh to write her story, which doesn't really happen until the last anthology, Endgame, where plotlines get wrapped up. But Angel with the Sword is a great story. It may seem dated to some here, by this time, as it's twenty years old. But it's strong adventure fantasy, and you might like the anthologies also.\n\nHowever, it's probably best to first try the Morgaine series, or Fortress or Rusalka. Her Arafel trilogy written long ago is supposed to be good, and fantasy readers might also like her Rider at the Gate duology, which is SF, but nothing that's going to bother you.\n\nShe uses humor. She hits dark subject matter, but she's not a noir stylist, if that's important to you. I don't find her wordy at all -- her stuff is way shorter than most of what we have now, and does not bother being flowery. Bakker, I would call wordy. Abercrombie, even. But Cherryh is pretty straightforward, her series aren't very long and she has lots of standalones. And about the ins and outs of characters, she's smart as a whip, in my opinion."
