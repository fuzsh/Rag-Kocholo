        "text": "The Paradisi Chronicles Science Fiction Series\n\nOne of my favorite forms of recreational reading has always been science fiction––particularly books by those authors like William Gibson, Anne McCaffrey, C. J. Cherryh, and Ursula Le Guin who excel at world building––a process that is very similar to what I do in rebuilding the world of Victorian San Francisco. As a result, in the fall of 2015, I was excited to join a group of authors who were creating an innovative science fiction series that we called the Paradisi Chronicles.\n\nWe worked for nearly a year to create a world called New Eden located in the fictional Paradisi System of the Andromeda Galaxy. We shared ideas, hammered out a backstory, drew maps, adapted technology, designed cities, and invented new species. Then we wrote stories about the people and places of this new world we’d created. We wrote in different styles, in different genres, and in different forms, and we had so much fun we have opened up this world to any other author who would like to write their own stories and add to the Paradisi Chronicles canon. More information about this open source science fiction series in general (whether you are a reader or an author who might want to write in this world) can be found HEREon the official Paradisi Chronicles website.\n\nWithin the Paradisi Chronicles series I have so far published the Caelestis Series (Between Mountain and Sea, Under Two Moons, Ddaera’s Touch, and Tides of Acerba) and I am currently working on the fifth and final novel in the series, In Ddaera’s Embrace.\n\nSign up to Locke’s Promotional Newsletter to be notified when new books or short stories by me or other authors in the Paradisi Chronicles are published (and learn how to get a free copy of my short story, Aelwyd: Home.)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBetween Mountain and Sea\n\nCaelestis Series (Book 1)\n\nMei Lin Yu should have been looking forward to the next stage in her life. As a descendant of one of the Founding Families who led the exodus from a dying Earth and now rule New Eden, Mei’s choices are endless. But she has never felt part of the Yu Family or the world of technological marvels and genetic perfection the Founders created.\n\nAll that will change the summer she spends at Mynyddamore, the home her ancestor Mabel Yu built in western Caelestis. Here, living among the Ddaerans, the original inhabitants of New Eden, Mei will discover secrets about Mabel Yu that her family want to keep buried and a truth about herself that will forever change her own destiny.\n\nThis is the first book in my Caelestis Series trilogy.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLearn more...\n\nUnder Two Moons\n\nCaelestis Series (Book 2)\n\nMei Lin Yu, a shy studious young woman from a Founding Family, and Silence, a fierce snowcat running with outlaws, shouldn’t have anything in common. But on New Eden, a world where the native Ddaerans have psychic abilities, a world ruled by the Founders who fled a dying Earth…anything is possible.\n\nWhen Mei Lin is forced out of the comfortable refuge of Mynyddamore and confronted with a secret from the past that is very much alive, will she be able to save herself and Silence to gain the trust of a man who has no reason to trust anyone from a Founding Family?\n\nThis is the second book in the Caelestis Series Trilogy.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLearn more...\n\nThrough Ddaera’s Touch\n\nCaelestis Series (Book 3)\n\nDdaera, the planet the Founders from Earth call New Eden, changes all she touches, including Mei Lin, the studious daughter of a Founding Family, Silence, a sentient snow cat, and Jaxon, a man displaced by space and time. Can these three find common ground in order to save Ddaera and the people they have sworn to protect?\n\nThrough Ddaera’s Touch, the third book in USA Today bestselling author Locke’s Caelestis Series, is an exciting action-adventure novel that tells the story of the emergence of a Resistance Movement that begins to unite disaffected New Eden citizens, the native Ddaerans, and the Reachers, new arrivals from Earth, against the Founding Families of New Eden.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLearn more...\n\nTides of Acerba\n\nCaelestis Series (Book 4)\n\nTwo moons, too many demands, too little time.

Is it Jaxon, a man with his own responsibilities and trust issues, Dr. Eleanor, a scientist in the ruthless pursuit of knowledge, grandaunt Anne, the most powerful woman in Caelestis, or Daniella, a young widow with a surprising secret?\n\nAs Mei Lin faces one crisis after another, she will finally discover that the person she needs to learn to trust, is herself.\n\nTides of Acerba, the fourth book in Louisa Locke’s Caelestis series, comes right after Through Ddaera’s Touch, and is part of the Paradisi Chronicles, an open-source, multi-author science fiction universe.\n\nNow available as an ebook and in print!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLearn more...\n\nAelwyd: Home\n\nIn the late 21st century, ten Founding Families fulfilled a nearly century-long plan to escape the dying Earth and travel to the Andromeda galaxy to establish a new society on the planet they named New Eden. One of those first settlers, Kammie Gunther, is finding it particularly hard to adapt. Born on a space station, having never before breathed fresh air, seen a horizon, or felt wind and rain on her face, Kammie finds everything unsettling. It doesn’t help that when she awoke from cryostasis she discovered her mother had remarried and she now has a younger step-brother. As she faces a new life, on a new world, with a new family, Kammie wonders if she will ever find a place in the universe that feels like home.\n\nAelwyd, a short story, is a work in the open-source, multi-author Paradisi Chronicles and is a good introduction to Louisa Locke’s Caelestis trilogy (Between Mountain and Sea, Under Two Moons, Through Ddaera’s Touch.)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLearn more...\n\nCaelestis Series: Books 1-3 Plus Aelwyd: Home\n\nCaelestis Series Boxed Set\n\nMabel Yu is one of the ten Founding Families of the Paradisi Project who left a dying Earth to settle New Eden.
