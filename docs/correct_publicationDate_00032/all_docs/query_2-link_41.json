Cherryh once told a contributor to the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers: \"Having made a thorough study of the past I am vehemently certain that I do not wish to live in it, nor do I wish to see three quarters of the planet weltering in conditions that should have been left in the past, with the same hunger and disease our ancestors knew. The reach for space and its resources is the make-or-break point for our species, and the appropriate use of technology and the adjustment of human viewpoint to a universe not limited to a blue sky overhead and the curvature of the horizon are absolutely critical to our survival. Therefore I write fiction about space and human adjustment to the unfamiliar.\" Setting her novels in extremely complex alien cultures, Cherryh examines two recurring themes, according to a Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor: \"The theme of absolute power, especially when such power is held by a woman, and the theme of culture as a force shaping the whole of life.\"\n\nThese themes can be found in Cherryh's first novel, Gate of Ivrel, in which the female protagonist Morgaine is a member of a band of humans working to close \"the gates,\" an interplanetary teleportation network that is slowly destabilizing human worlds. Closing these gates, however, proves to be a destructive process, and Morgaine leaves a trail of wreckage and death in her wake. In subsequent novels, Cherryh develops her talent for creating intricate alien cultures. In Hunter of Worlds, for example, she creates three separate alien languages, \"each with a distinct grammar and a specific history,\" a Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor stated. \"Cherryh's achievement in creating beings who are convincing yet remain alien is considerable,\" a Publishers Weekly contributor wrote, \"but most readers will be daunted by the need to master about fifty keywords in the iduve language … in order to follow the narrative at all comfortably.\"\n\nIn The Pride of Chanur, Cherryh presents an alien race of catlike beings named the hani, \"a superlatively drawn alien race,\" stated Roland Green of Booklist. The story is told from the viewpoint of the hani Pyanfar Chanur, who finds a strange hairless animal hiding on his spaceship. The creature turns out to be a human, and after some time, Chanur learns a bit of its language so as to communicate with it. Cherryh \"has given us,\" Tom Easton wrote in Analog, \"an alien psychology story, and she has done it the hard way, and she has done a grand job…. It is a mark of Cherryh's success that here it is the human who seems the alien.\" In his review of the book, Green commented that \"Cherryh is becoming one of the best and best-known creators of aliens in SF.\"\n\nPerhaps Cherryh's most successful work is found in \"The Faded Sun\" trilogy, in which she creates the mri, a race of interplanetary mercenaries. The mri society is ruled over by a woman, a \"she'pan,\" who is \"at once high priestess, ruler, and mother,\" according to a Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor. Duncan, a human who has befriended the mri, becomes one of them through a difficult process of acculturation. When war breaks out between human and mri, it is eventually settled with the assistance of Duncan, who is the only one to understand the needs and interests of both sides. A Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor wrote that \"The Faded Sun\" trilogy \"demonstrated Cherryh's mastery of the ‘alien anthropology’ genre of science fiction,\" while \"the she'pan is perhaps the most interesting of Cherryh's women in power.\"\n\nCherryh's \"Foreigner Universe\" series is set on a planet dominated by an alien species, the atevi. A group of humans found themselves stuck on the island following a spaceship accident, and hundreds of years later their descendents have formed a colony, isolated from the atevi, on an island. A single human ambassador, the paidhi, is permitted to leave and interact with the atevi. \"Cherryh's gift for conjuring believable alien cultures is in full force here,\" wrote a Publishers Weekly contributor about Foreigner: A Novel of First Contact, the first book in the series. As Roland Green noted of the same title in Booklist, this tale \"is longer on world building, exotic aliens, and characterization than on action, although it is not short on that.\" In subsequent installments a human-piloted spaceship, the Phoenix, arrives at the planet, throwing the human and atevi political arrangements into disarray. \"Of particular note is the author's ongoing exploration of the atevi, one of the more fascinating alien cultures ever imagined,\" a Publishers Weekly contributor wrote in a review of Precursor. On the other hand, Booklist contributor Green, writing about the same title, noted \"Cherryh's excellent world building and masterful depiction of humans occupying a subordinate position and being seen through nonhuman eyes and in a less-than-favorable light.\"\n\nCherryh does not write only science fiction. Several of her novels are better placed in the category of fantasy, including Rusalka, Chernevog, and Yvgenie, a series of books based on Russian folk tales. The books feature a ghost (\"rusalka\"), a wizard named Chernevog, magic, and resurrection, among other fantastic elements. \"Cherryh weaves a complex psychological tale of magic,\" a Publishers Weekly contributor wrote of the third book.\n\nAnother series of books, beginning with Fortress in the Eye of Time and continuing through several more books with the word \"fortress\" in the title, are high fantasy. This series centers on Tristen, a young man who was magically created out of whole cloth by a wizard, Mauryl. Cherryh's \"accomplished storytelling and leisurely pacing lend an allegorical quality\" to this series, Jackie Cassada commented in a Library Journal review of Fortress of Owls. Booklist contributor Green, reviewing the same title, deemed the series \"consistently readable and intelligent.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor commented in a review of Fortress of Eagles, however, that \"in general, Cherryh's SF … has proven much stronger than her fantasy.\"\n\nCherryh launched another science fiction series, \"Gene Wars,\" in 2001 with the publication of Hammerfall. This novel is the story of Marak, an outcast whom everyone—including himself—thinks is insane. He sees visions of a silver tower to the east, in the desert, and struggles mightily to resist the temptation to journey toward it. Yet many others have been experiencing the same visions, and Ila, the female dictator who rules this world, sends Marak and others out in search of the source of their hallucinations. The book \"features [Cherryh's] usual blend of gorgeous, slightly knotty prose, deeply conflicted heroes, desperate action and nicely observed cultural details,\" praised a Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nThe Collected Short Fiction of C.J. Cherryh was released in 2004. \"This massive and valuable collection,\" as Green described it in Booklist, contains every one of Cherryh's published short stories and novellas, plus some new ones. \"The majority of the pieces,\" noted a Publishers Weekly contributor, \"showcase the author's talent for depicting the effect of history on individuals.\" These stories include the \"Sunfall\" tales, which examine how the residents of northern cities including Moscow, Paris, and London might cope with the time in the far future when the sun begins to produce less light and heat. Even the \"less impressive stories,\" Green wrote, will \"verify [Cherryh's] reputation for brilliance and versatility.\"\n\nAmong the author's other books are Rider at the Gate and its sequel, Cloud's Rider. Rider at the Gate introduces readers to a new world that once again features intricate relationships between humans and aliens. Stranded on a planet, a group of humans are linked telepathically to its alien inhabitants, which include fauna and horses. These aliens can only communicate by sending sensory images tinged with emotions. Problems arise, however, because some aliens act as human protectors while others are predators. The novel also introduces readers to Danny Fisher, who is telepathically linked to a horse named Cloud. Roland Green, writing in Booklist, noted that the author continues with her \"usual superb world building and deft characterization.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor referred to the novel as a \"perceptive and carefully crafted coming-of-age\" story.\n\nIn Cloud's Rider, Danny and Cloud are trying to get two brothers and their sister away from their ruined village to safety. \"Ms. Cherryh obviously knows where her strength lies,\" wrote Gerald Jonas in his review of both books in the New York Times Book Review. \"Her long, unhurried sentences keep digging deeper and deeper into the ‘sense of whereness’ that nighthorses and humans share.\" In a review of Cloud's Rider, Booklist contributor Dennis Winters noted that the author's \"characterizations make us care deeply about what happens to the story's finely delineated personae.\"\n\nCherryh has also continued to contribute to her \"Fortress\" fantasy series with Fortress of Dragons and Fortress of Ice. The latter book introduces a new generation of warrior heroes and magicians to the series and features the coming-of-age story of two very different brothers who are nevertheless loyal to each other. Jackie Cassada, writing in the Library Journal, noted that Fortress of Ice will have \"strong appeal for fans of epic fantasy.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor also wrote that \"a helpful introduction will guide newcomers through the complex plot.\"\n\nFollowing \"Foreigner Universe\" series entries Precursor, Defender, and Explorer, the author wrote Destroyer. The novel features human diplomat Bren Cameron, one of the few humans who truly understands the very foreign atevi culture, and he soon finds himself involved with warring atevi clans. Pretender finds Bren in the middle of a civil war and searching for Tabiniaiji, an atevi. Jackie Cassada, writing in the Library Journal, noted the novel's \"superbly realized characters.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor reviewing Pretender wrote that \"this series represents contemporary SF at its finest.\" In Deliverer, Bren and servants from the Assassins' Guild must travel through a harsh winter landscape to rescue an atevi heir to the throne. A Publishers Weekly contributor commented that the author \"alternates complex political maneuvering with pell-mell action sequences in an intensely character-driven SF novel.\" Roland Green, writing in Booklist, noted that the atevi society is \"redolent of a feudal Japan equipped with futuristic technology.\"\n\nThe Dreaming Tree is a reissue with revisions of The Dreamstone and Tree of Swords and Jewels. The story revolves around the inhabitants of a human stronghold and a tree called Cinniuint. Hanging from the tree's branches are the jewels and swords of a race that has gone to a different realm of life. The jewels provide whoever wears them with a link to the ancient race and their memories. \"I found the writing in both volumes to be first-rate: the dialogue never feels stilted or corny; the characters are believable and have understandable motives,\" wrote Stephen Davis on the SF Site Web site.\n\nAnother popular book by the author is Finity's End, in which the author returns to the Merchanter universe first described in her earlier novels Downbelow Station and Cyteen. Roland Green, writing in Booklist, noted that the \"novel can be read as a coming-of-age story more or less independent of its predecessors.\" The novel primarily focuses on the young Fletcher Niehart, who finds himself after many years away returned to his dead mother's family on the ship Finity's End. \"The politics and intrigue eventually intertwine with Fletcher's life, culminating in an explosive ending to a riveting story,\" wrote Greg L. Johnson on the SF Site Web site.\n\nEvaluating Cherryh's achievement in the field of science fiction, a Dictionary of Literary Biography contributor stated: \"Since the days of the movie ‘Flash Gordon,’ with its imperial villains, science fiction writers have been interested in the possibilities of autocratic societies. Cherryh, however, is one of the few writers who has presented such societies sympathetically, without taking the viewpoint of a rebel or an alienated outsider. Furthermore, interests in power have generally not, in science fiction, been combined with interests in culture.\" The contributor went on to note: \"Cherryh, however, tells stories in which very powerful characters are situated in extremely complex cultures.\"\n\nCherryh's background in the classics and anthropology has helped her in making the cultures she creates realistic. In a letter to CA, Cherryh wrote: \"I have not forgotten my anthropological training, but I have done enough research over the past half decade to follow my first love, which is technology, using insight gained from the impact of technology on humanity of the past and present to project the likely course of events for the future, which has become my major work.\n\n\"My classical education includes Latin, Greek, anthropology, archaeology, and ancient history, with sidelines in Bronze Age myth and society; art; geology and climatology. I have studied literature, religion, music, astronomy; am a passable artist, know French and Italian, with some German and Russian; know fencing and archery and enjoy riding; am active in the pro-space movement and am a constant reader in all sciences and aerospace engineering.\n\n\"I have retraced Caesar's campaigns in travels in England, France, Switzerland, and Italy; have hiked about the hills of ancient Thebes and Mycenae in Greece; climbed Mt. Dicte on Crete, where Zeus was born; walked the dead cities of Pompeii, Troy, Ephesus, and Cnossos; have visited Rome and Istanbul, Pergamum, Athens and Delphi, lived a week in Sparta; have sailed the Adriatic past Ithaca—all of this while taking photographs and historical notes. I was at [space shuttle] Columbia's maiden launch.\n\n\"In the interest of authenticity in my writing I have tried camel riding and small-craft sailing, horse-cabs and hovercraft, have explored ancient prisons and studied computer science and ancient weaponry. Things I have yet to do include as favorite dreams: to see the pyramids of Egypt and trace the Nile by boat; to sail the routes of Jason and Odysseus; to travel the route of Alexander the Great as far as India and back again; to see Mr. Erebus in Antarctica and the Great Wall of China; to be on the first commercial flight into space.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Yearbook 1980, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1981.\n\nSt. James Guide to Fantasy Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nSt. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, 4th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nSt. James Guide to Young Adult Writers, 2nd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1999.\n\nScience Fiction Writers, 2nd edition, Scribner (New York, NY), 1999.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAnalog, August, 1982, Tom Easton, review of The Pride of Chanur, p. 125.\n\nBooklist, April 1, 1982, Roland Green, review of The Pride of Chanur; January 15, 1994, Roland Green, review of Foreigner: A Novel of First Contact, p. 904; August, 1995, Roland Green, review of Rider at the Gate, p. 1933; April 15, 1996, Roland Green, review of Inheritor, p. 1425; September 15, 1996, Dennis Winters, review of Cloud's Rider, p. 226; August, 1997, Roland Green, review of Finity's End, p. 1886; December 15, 1998, Roland Green, review of Fortress of Owls, p. 730; November 15, 1999, Roland Green, review of Precursor, p. 608; May 1, 2000, Roland Green, review of Fortress of Dragons, p. 1655; April 15, 2001, Paula Leudtke, review of Hammerfall, p. 1539; November 15, 2001, Roland Green, review of Defender, p. 560; April 15, 2002, Ray Olson, review of Hammerfall, p. 1387; November 15, 2002, Roland Green, review of Explorer, p. 583; February 15, 2004, Roland Green, review of The Collected Short Fiction of C.J.
