        "text": "Born Carolyn Jane Cherry, C.J. Cherryh is the author of more than eighty works of science fiction and fantasy from the mid-seventies on, including two Hugo Award winners, 1981’s Downbelow Station and 1988’s Cyteen, both\n\nof which are set in her Alliance-Union universe. Her four-book Morgaine Cycle books, set in the same fictional universe, have sold over three million copies in total. In 1975, before the publication of her first novels, she began to use her first two initials instead of her first name to disguise that she was female, as most SF/F authors were male at the time; her first editor, Daw’s Don Wollheim, also advised her to alter the spelling of her last name because he thought the surname “Cherry” made her sound too much like a romance author. Thus C.J. Cherryh was created.\n\nBorn in 1942 in St. Louis, she began to write at age ten out of frustration that her favorite TV show, Flash Gordon, had been canceled, and says she continued to write “daily” from then on. She went on to major in Latin at the University of Oklahoma, focusing on mythology, archaeology, and engineering history, and then earned a master’s degree in classics at Johns Hopkins, where she was awarded a Woodrow Wilson fellowship. Cherryh became a high school teacher of Latin, ancient Greek, ancient history, and the classics in Oklahoma City; during the summers, she led tours of ancient ruins in Europe and the UK. She wrote future fiction in her spare time, incorporating Greco-Roman mythological material into the plots. In a way atypical of authors in the SF field at the time, she did not first publish short stories in genre periodicals before ramping up to writing novels; instead, she began by writing and publishing several novels before trying her hand at short stories. At first, as for so many new authors, there were many rejections, and some publishers even lost her hard-copy manuscript submissions. On these occasions, she had to physically retype the manuscripts, working from her carbon copies, as photocopying was expensive at the time.\n\nFinally, Cherryh went through her own library and “investigated who was\n\nthe editor who had bought most of [her] favorite books,” figuring that their tastes would match. This led her to specifically reach out to editor Donald A. Wollheim at Daw Books. In 1975, Wollheim bought the first two books of the Morgaine Stories, which utilized a set of characters Cherryh had created at the beginning of her teens; upon seeing print, Gate of Ivrel and Brothers of Earth brought her immediate recognition and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1977. Six more of her books were published in the late 1970s, and when she won a Hugo Award for Best Short Story for “Cassandra” in 1979, she left teaching to become a full-time writer. Her academic background has contributed to her skill at fictional “world building”; she creates rich realism\n\nin her stories by fleshing out the language, history, psychology, and even archaeology of the worlds she invents. One reviewer said of Cherryh, “Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe.” Her novels often include idealistic protagonists striving to uphold the greater good and capable heroines as well as exploring alternatives in gender roles.\n\nBesides creating works in her own fictional universes, Cherryh has written numerous short stories for several shared world anthology series, such as Witch World (created by Andre Norton), Elfquest, Merovingen Nights, and Thieves’ World. She lives near Spokane, Washington, with her wife Jane Fancher, who is also a science fiction and fantasy author as well as an artist, and two cats; she enjoys travel and has been most of the way around the world. Interestingly, her brother, David A. Cherry, is an artist who also works in the F/SF field.\n\nIf you want to change a culture, you need to transform the role of women.\n\nC.J. Cherryh, in a 1996 interview with The Camelot Project"
