        "text": "About the Author[]\n\nGenres: Science Fiction, Fantasy\n\nThemes: She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles.\n\nWriting Style: Detailed world building\n\nBooks: C.J. Cherryh Books\n\nBiography[]\n\nCarolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction. She has written more than 80 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award-winning novels Downbelow Station (1981) and Cyteen (1988), both set in her Alliance-Union universe. She is known for \"world building\", depicting fictional realms with great realism supported by vast research in history, language, psychology, and archeology.\n\nCherryh (pronounced \"Cherry\") appended a silent \"h\" to her real name because her first editor, Donald A. Wollheim, felt that \"Cherry\" sounded too much like a romance writer. She used only her initials, C.J., to disguise that she was female at a time when the majority of science fiction authors were male.\n\nThe author has an asteroid, 77185 Cherryh, named after her. Referring to this honor, the asteroid's discoverers wrote of Cherryh: \"She has challenged us to be worthy of the stars by imagining how mankind might grow to live among them.\"[1]\n\nSeries[]\n\nAlliance–Union Universe[]\n\nGenres: Colonization, Space Opera, Genetic Engineering (cloning)\n\nTheme:\n\nThe Company Wars[]\n\nAccording to the author, the novels in this universe, except Heavy Time and Hellburner (which were subsequently re-published in one volume as Devil to the Belt), can be read in any order.
