She got her Masters of Arts degree in classics from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was a Woodrow Wilson fellow in 1965.\n\nAfter she graduated, Cherry taught Ancient Greek, Latin, the classics, and ancient history at John Marshall High School in the Oklahoma City public school system. Even though her job was to teach Latin, her passion was the religion, history, and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. During her summers she would conduct student tours of the ancient ruins in Italy, Spain, France, and England.\n\nDuring her spare time, she’d write, using the mythology of Greece and Rome as plots for her stories on the future. Cherryh didn’t follow the professional path of science fiction authors at the time, which was to publish short stories in science fiction and fantasy magazines first before progressing to novels. She never even considered writing short stories until she’d already had many novels published.\n\nCJ wrote novels during her spare time from teaching and submitted these manuscripts to get published, meeting with little success, initially. Various publishers lost her manuscripts, which forced her to retype them entirely, using her carbon copies, time-consuming to do, yet was cheaper than paying for photocopying.\n\nShe appended a silent “h” to her real name since her first editor (Donald A. Wolheim) felt that “Cherry” sounded much too much like a romance author. She used her initials in order to disguise the fact that she was a female at a time when the vast majority of science fiction writers were men.\n\nHer big break came in the year 1975 when Donald bought the two manuscripts she’d submitted to DAW Books, “Gate of Ivrel” and “Brothers of Earth”, with each getting published in 1976. These books earned her immediate recognition and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in the year 1977.\n\n“Brothers of Earth” was the first time a book of hers found an ending and truly worked, since she had made contact with Donald at DAW, found he was interested, and was able to write for a specific editor whose body of work and sort of story that she knew. This was a good match. These were characters that she had invented when she was around thirteen years old. So it was a long time favorite of her untold stories, and wound up being the first in print.\n\nIn the year 1979, “Cassandra” won the Best Short Story Hugo, and she quit her teaching job in order to write full time.\n\nHer writing has encompassed all kinds of science fiction and fantasy subgenres and includes just a few shorter works of non-fiction. Her novels have been translated into Hungarian, French, Lithuanian, German, Czech, Japanese, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Russian, Latvian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Slovak. She’s also translated several published works of fiction from French into English.\n\nHer protagonists typically try to uphold existing social norms and institutions in the service of the greater good as the antagonists typically try to subvert, radically alter, or exploit the predominant social order for their own selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) own place in society and how different individuals interact with The Other.\n\nA number of Cherryh’s works focus on political and military themes. An underlying theme in her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both weaknesses and strengths regardless of what their gender is, although her female protagonists are depicted as being especially determined and capable, and many of her male characters are shown to be abused, damaged, or otherwise vulnerable in someway.\n\nShe lives with science fiction and fantasy writer and artist Jane Fancher, near Spokane, Washington. She enjoys traveling, skating, and regularly making appearances at science fiction conventions. Other hobbies include photography, pond-building for koi (she runs a marine tank and can plumb just about anything), planetary geology, and physics. David A. Cherry, her brother, is a science fiction and fantasy artist.\n\n“Foreigner” is the first novel in the “Foreigner” series and was released in 1994. The groundbreaking book which launched Cherryh’s eponymous space opera series about first contact and all its consequences.\n\nIt’d been close to five centuries since the starship Phoenix, which was lost in space and desperately trying to locate for the closest G5 star, and had encountered the planet of the atevi. Law was kept by the use of registered assassination, war became inevitable after humans and a faction of atevi established a working relationship, and alliances were defined by individual loyalties and not geographical borders, on this planet. It was a war which humans didn’t have any chance of winning on this planet so many lightyears from home.\n\nNow, almost two hundred years after this conflict, humanity’s traded its advanced tech for peace and some island refuge which no atevi are ever going to visit. Then the only human that the treaty allows into atevi society gets marked for a hitman’s bullet. The work of a single isolated lunatic? The interests of some particular faction? Or is this the consequence of a human’s fondness for a species that has got fourteen different words for betrayal and none for love?\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » C.J.
