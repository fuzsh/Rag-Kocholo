        "text": "After Andre Norton's Witch World books, these were perhaps my first introduction to Science Fantasy. The complexity of the story, the politics, the characterization is, of course, on a much higher level.\n\nI think it was the emotional intensity of these books that hooked me, the fact that the characters never seem to be able to relax into complacency about what they are doing. There are always dilemmas, moral questions -- indeed, some of them can't be solved. There is no room for conscience in Morgaine's quest, and yet that seems to be Vanye's greatest value: that he challenges her to think before she acts. He sees questions of morality, ethics, honor, and humanity in a straight-forward way that contrasts with the many convolutions of her own thinking (which are the result of time and experience, loss and grief, and the many bad decisions that she and her original companions must have made along the way). No matter how old she actually is -- and Cherryh never tells us -- Morgaine is immeasurably older than he. It is interesting to have a heroine who is so much older and more experienced than the hero.\n\nYet Vanye has his own strengths. I can recall no character that I've ever read about who suffered more physical agonies and indignities, and yet kept going, in spite of many opportunities to turn back. Loyalty, endurance, and compassion are the qualities that he brings to the journey.\n\nCherryh is famous (and deservedly so) for writing aliens who are truly alien, who have alien minds, as different as they could possibly be from ours and yet still be comprehensible. Yet in the Morgaine books she explores the human heart and mind, taking Vanye and Morgaine from one world to another where humans are trying to survive under immense outside pressures.\n\nOn another thread I was saying the Morgaine series was \"only foreground fantasy and part of the depth and resonance is the background SF\" and Ray was saying \"the Morgaine series is really fantasy, more so than Pern (which gradually introduces SF), the SF aspect is to me a sort of a McGuffin to give her bizarre \"quest\"/Task meaning and explain the portals\" and I figured I'd move that part over here.\n\nI completely agree that Morgaine can be taken as plain fantasy and should appeal to fantasy fans. And it's odd that I'm usually the first to dismiss thin veneers or deep backgrounds of SF in a fantasy story. But, somehow, the Morgaine books work for me on an SF level. IIRC, Vanye sees her as sort of supernatural but not exactly and part of what makes it so cool is that double vision of the \"distinguishable from magic\". If Morgaine were just some weird witch I don't think the books would be as interesting. I feel like Cherryh lets us imagine whatever we'd like about \"the other Morgaine\" or \"Morgaine from the other side\" and she becomes much more tangible (to me) as someone from an advanced civilization grounded in the natural. I can more readily suspend disbelief in her as coming from an SF world. The SF background adds a great deal to the story for me.\n\nIs it important to most people or does it not really matter? If it matters, does it help or hinder to look at it one way or the other?\n\nAnd back on the earlier discussion regarding Vanye's agonies, these books are on the heavy side (along with Faded Sun and some others) of what is present in most Cherryh - without being sadistic, she's really hard on her characters. \"It builds character.\" It's no cakewalk for Morgaine either and it's that grittiness without being just plain dull dark drabness, but true toughness, that I often really like about her stuff.\n\nThat's one thing that's kind of funny about the Chanur books - while it's no breeze for Tully (if I'm recalling his name right), the Chanur books are much gentler on the characters - it's a rough universe but Tully's actually pretty lucky to fall in with some pretty cool folks. But that's a digression itself - just saying the Morgaine books are among the tougher.\n\nI hate it that the first book in this series is not one of Cherryh books i have unread at home thanks to you TE. Im a big fan of Science Fantasy. After SF i think i like good Science Fantasy way more than good Fantasy. Thanks to authors like Vance, Brackett,ERB,Powers, etc\n\nI have just ordered 10 books through my bookstore, otherwise i would called them to order these Morgaine books too. Just to sample her SFF. Cherryh writing is so SF like to me i cant imagine how she would write Science fantasy. Just because there is this logical science fictional setting,worlds in her books about humans, aliens. I wonder does she change her prose style to be more stylised,fantastical like i have seen some SF authors do when they write fantasy."
