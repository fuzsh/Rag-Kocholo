        "text": "Description\n\nOriginal Binding, Publishers' Original Binding\n\nTwelve volumes. Written by Carolyn Janice Cherry, under the pen name C. J. Cherryh, an American writer who has published more than 80 books depicting realms with great realism. These volumes include: The Chanur Novels: The Pride of Chanur, Chanur's Venture, The Kif Strike Back, and Chanur's Home-Coming. These works are unusually realistic examples of space opera, with ship-to-ship shooting minimized in favor of coercion, manipulation, politics, pride contests, and clashing economic interests, driven in many cases by species-to-species miscommunication and misunderstanding. The Faded Sun Trilogy: republished as an omnibus edition on 1987, the series is considered a Bildungsroman, since one of the major themes is the coming of age of Niun, the Mri protagonist. At the same time, it is a story of acculturation, as the human protagonist, Sten Duncan, lives among the Mri to the point of becoming one of them. Downbelow Station: set during the Company Wars period, specifically late 2352 and early 2353. The book details events centering on a space station in orbit around Pell's World in the Tau Ceti star system. Cuckoo's Egg: this work introduces the idea of a fictional race (the Shonunin) raising a human boy. Visible Light: a collection of short stories in the science-fiction and fantasy genres, including Threads of Time, Companions, and Endpiece. With other works such as: Serpent's Reach, Forty Thousand in Gehenna, Voyager in Night, and Hestia.\n\nDelivery & payment\n\nWe send all of our books via courier which is a fully tracked and insured service.
