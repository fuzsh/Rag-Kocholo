        "text": "With the holidays approaching, extensive travel and family time might be in your future. Whether you feel like breaking away from the excitement or simply want to relax, now is the time to treat yourself to some free new material from your local library.\n\nMesa County Libraries has a plethora of fantastic books, movies, and entertainment available for checkout this season. Visit your local branch for a specific holiday favorite, or put any of the below staff picks on hold from our catalog.\n\nKacee’s Pick\n\nDance Fever by Florence + the Machine (Music CD)\n\nDance Fever is Florence + the Machine’s fifth studio album and retains the combination of rock and lyrical symphony sounds from previous albums. Some songs range more toward techno or disco or even acoustic percussion, but they always have the core of unique instrumentals that gave the band their rise to fame.\n\nFlorence Welch, front woman of Florence + the Machine, writes or cowrites all of the songs on her latest album Dance Fever. It’s fair to say then that the album’s songs speak to Welch’s experience during her rise to fame. Welch has spoken previously about her difficulties with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety, which were also explored in songs such as “Sky Full of Song,” “Hunger,” and “South London Forever,” off of her last album High as Hope. Welch dives into the same theme on some of her more mellow tracks of Dance Fever such as “The Bomb,” “Back in Town,” and “Morning Elvis,” which impress on the listener some of the darker moments of sleeplessness, anxiety and loss of hope.\n\nBut Welch also begins to explore some of her own mythology on Dance Fever. The song “King” opens with “We argue in the kitchen about whether to have children,” and goes on in the chorus to say, “I am no mother, I am no bride, I am King,” possibly speaking to female celebrities often have difficult power dynamics with their partners, and how external media tends to focus on their relationships to others rather than their accomplishments or art. “Dream Girl Evil,” seems to be a send up of how people tend to glorify their idols, specifically women idols, as perfect creatures, and when they fail, they’re an angel falling from grace and becoming a scourge of humanity.\n\nNot every track on Dance Fever feels doom and gloom, though — Welch has always excelled at balancing moods, lyrics, and tempos on her albums. The originally concept behind the album came 14th century affliction called “choeromania,” (also a track on the album) or “dancing plague.” Welch references dancing on the album even through hard times. The upbeat track “Free” starts with Welch saying, “Sometimes I wonder if I should be medicated,” and comes to a bombastic climax with “For a moment when I’m dancing, I am free!” Ultimately the album left me with the feeling that though there are trials in life, if you can find the bits that bring you joy, you can make it through just about anything.\n\nDance Fever is available on CD format and through Hoopla, a free streaming service to enjoy with your library card."
