        "text": "As the 1950s morphed into the 1960s, science fiction became more diverse to reflect the changes society was going through. This era, often referred to as “the New Wave”, is a little harder to describe, so I’m using excerpts from Pamela Sargent’s anthology, Women of Wonder: The Classic Years, to help me:\n\nDuring the ’60s, several science fiction writers experimented with both subject matter and style. For them, science fiction had become too predictable and hidebound, and was ripe for change. These writers and others, loosely grouped together under the somewhat misleading term “New Wave”, rejected the elements of pulp fiction and often viewed technology and the future with pessimism.\n\nThe magazine New Worlds in England and Damon Knight’s Orbit series of anthologies and Harlan Ellison’s groundbreaking anthology Dangerous Visions (1967) in the U.S. contained stories in which writers aimed at a more literary and iconoclastic approach to the genre. In this atmosphere of change, women who wrote science fiction were likely to find a more receptive audience even if their stories violated some of the traditional canons.\n\nDuring the 1970s, women in science fiction were no longer isolated examples or exceptions to the rule. There were more of them than ever. More women began to question the roles they played and the limitations on their lives, and science fiction, not surprisingly, reflected this development.\n\nWithin the field of science fiction, women writers were also coming to consider themselves a group. This is not to say that they shared the same views, were equally doctrinaire in their feminism, or were similar in their writing. But there was a growing sense that science fiction was a form in which the issues raised by feminism could be explored, in which writers could look beyond their own culture and create imaginative new possibilities.\n\nThese are some of the women writers who came to prominence in the ’60s and ’70s.\n\nKit Reed\n\nHer real name was Lillian Hyde Craig. The daughter of a schoolteacher and a US Naval officer, her first SF novel, Armed Camps (1969), possibly draws on her “navy brat” background, while her short story, “The Food Farm” (1966), concerns a teenage girl obsessed with food, technology and a pop star.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley\n\nWhile more known for her fantasy novel The Mists of Avalon, she’s also known for her Darkover series which chronicles the history of the inhabitants of the planet Cottman IV, commonly referred to as Darkover. Sadly, longtime fans were shocked when they learned that Bradley was sexually abusive to her children and was married to Walter Breen, a sexual predator who preyed on boys. You can read her daughter’s eye-opening account here.\n\nYou may be wondering why I included this monster in my list of SF “queens”. Well, remember, in herstory, there have been good queens, evil queens and queens in between. The purpose of history/herstory is to study and learn from the past. The purpose of this series is to not to promote these women as heroes or role models, but to learn about the contributions they’ve made to science fiction. As for Ms. Moira Greyland (Bradley’s daughter), I’m happy to say, she’s gotten much love and support from the SF fandom for coming forward. I hope she travels to as many SF conventions as possible to meet fans and tell her story, raise awareness about child abuse, and maybe become an SF author in her own right. If she does, I wish her the best.\n\nPauline Ashwell\n\nThe pen name of Pauline Whitby, this British author published her first story when she was only 14 years old (it was called “Invasion From Venus”). Although her first novel, Unwillingly to School, was published in 1958, its protagonist, a feisty young woman named Lysistrata “Lizzie” Lee, had her biggest adventure in its 1960 sequel, The Lost Kafoozalum, where she averts a nuclear holocaust.\n\nKate Wilhelm\n\nMarried to fellow SF pioneer Damon Knight, Wihelm’s best known work are the 1976 novels Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang (about a community of clones living in the Appalachians), The Clewiston Test (about the effect a scientific breakthrough has on a woman’s marriage), and The Infinity Box, a collection of short stories.\n\nRosel George Brown\n\nAmong her most notable works are Galactic Sybil Sue Blue (1966) and its sequel, The Waters of Centaurus, (1970) chronicling the adventures of a tough female cop and her teenage daughter. Her other novel, Earthblood, (1966) tells the story of a boy on a quest to discover his Terran heritage. Sadly in 1967, her life was cut short at the age of 41 when she died from lymphoma.\n\nPhyllis Gotlieb\n\nHer first and most famous novel, Sunburst, (1964) concerns the trials and tribulations of a group of ESP sensitive mutant children. The Sunburst Award is named for this book and is awarded annually to Canadian sci-fi authors.\n\nJoanna Russ\n\nRuss is often credited with being one of the first writers to directly address feminist themes in her work. “When It Changed” (1972), is about an all female society that has to face the eventual reality of male colonialism. The award-winning novel, The Female Man (1975) has four women from four different parallel worlds who meet and discuss the gender roles of their respective societies. Her 1977 novel, We Who Are About to Die, is a deconstruction of the Adam and Eve Plot.\n\nSonya Dorman Hess\n\nShe came to nationwide recognition with the inclusion of her short story “Go, Go, Go, Said the Bird” in the 1967’s Dangerous Visions Anthology. Her other short story “When I Was Miss Dow” looks into a shapeshifter’s relationship with a Terran colonist. In 1995 it was nominated for a Retrospective James Tiptree Jr. Award.\n\nFun fact: Hess bred akitas which is alluded to in “Miss Dow”.\n\nPamela Zoline\n\nThough more of an artist and editor than an SF writer, she took the concept of entropy and applied it to the everyday life of a housewife, in the style of multiple dictionary entries, in her 1967 story, “The Heat Death of the Universe”.\n\nAnne McCaffrey\n\nMcCaffrey is renowned for her worldbuilding. Her Dragonriders of Pern series (23 books in all!) depicts a world where dragons and their human riders share a telepathic link. Her 1961 story “The Ship Who Sang” set up the “Brain and Brawn Ship” series, where those who are physically disabled but mentally competent can donate their minds to run ships. Dinosaur Planet (1978) is just that, a planet full of dinosaurs – and pirates! What more could you want? Well, you could also read Decision At Doona (1967) where human colonists learn to coexist with the feline species of Doona. And last but not least, there’s stories (7 in all) about Acorna the unicorn girl (no she’s not a type of centaur, she’s a unicorn/human hybrid).\n\nUrsula K. LeGuin\n\nNo need for an introduction here. LeGuin shot to fame in 1968 and 1969 with her novels A Wizard of Earthsea and The Left Hand of Darkness, the latter novel famous for its exploration of androgyny, sexuality and gender roles. It’s always ranked as one of the greatest sci-fi works of all time. Her follow up books, The Dispossessed (1974) and The Word for World is Forrest (1976) have won Hugo and Nebula awards.\n\nJames Tiptree Jr.\n\nTiptree, on the right, pictured with her husband, Huntington Sheldon in 1946.\n\nI won’t lie: Tiptree is my favorite woman SF author. The idea that this author was able to fool everyone, from fans to the SF community into thinking that her work was written by a man is genius even to this day. Her real name was Alice Hastings Bradley Sheldon and her first SF story, “Birth of a Salesman” was published in 1968. She took the name “James Tiptree Jr.” because, in her words, “A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I’ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.” It was also believed that Sheldon was trying to protect her professional reputation as an intelligence community official (Sheldon once worked for the CIA). While her work often addressed feminist themes, her stories were often told from the perspectives of male protagonists: “Houston, Houston, Do You Read?” (1976) follows a group of (male) astronauts who discover a future Earth where men have been wiped out. The (male) protagonist in “The Women Men Don’t See” doesn’t understand why the two women he’s protecting would rather leave with some aliens. “The Screwfly Solution” bounces back and forth between a scientist couple observing a femicide pandemic. All these works can be found in the anthology Her Smoke Rose Up Forever. You can also read more about Tiptree in Julie Phillips biography: James Tiptree Jr.: the Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon. The James Tiptree Jr. Award honoring works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore our understanding of gender, was named in her honor.\n\nC.J. Cherryh\n\nAfter she won the Hugo award for her short story “Cassandra” (1978), Cherryh (the “h” was added at the end because her agent thought it looked more science-fictiony) quit teaching to become a full-time writer and wrote a very intricate series of books that make up the Alliance/Union Universe, which consists of the novel Cyteen, the Faded Sun Trilogy, the Morgaine Cycle and Downbelow Station. Another series of note is the Finisterre Universe, a duology about the bonds human colonists and equine aliens on the planet Finisterre.\n\nFun fact: discovered in March 2001, Asteroid 77185 Cherryh is named in her honor.\n\nOctavia E. Butler\n\nDespite growing up at a time when racism was prevalent, Butler still led a colorful life. Here’s a segment from Wikipedia:\n\nFrom an early age, an almost paralyzing shyness made it difficult for Butler to socialize with other children. Her awkwardness, paired with a slight dyslexia that made schoolwork a torment, an easy target for bullies, and led her to believe that she was “ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless”. As a result, she frequently passed the time reading at the Pasadena Central Library. She also wrote reams of pages in her “big pink notebook”. Hooked at first on fairy tales and horse stories, she quickly became interested in science fiction magazines, such as Amazing Stories, Galaxy Science Fiction, and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. She began reading stories by John Brunner, Zenna Henderson, and Theodore Sturgeon.\n\nAt the age of 10, Butler begged her mother to buy her a Remington typewriter, on which she “pecked [her] stories two fingered”. At 12, she watched the televised version of the film Devil Girl from Mars (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her Patternist novels. Happily ignorant of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter, she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned aunt Hazel said: “Honey … Negroes can’t be writers.” But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, and even asked her junior high school science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.\n\nThe Patternist series depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists. The first book, Patternmaster was published in 1976, the last book, Clay’s Ark was published in 1984. Her “pregnant man” story “Bloodchild” depicts a somewhat symbiotic relationship between a colony of humans and a race of aliens called the Tlic – who use the humans as hosts for their eggs. In 2006 and 2019 two scholarships were established in her memory as well as an asteroid (7052 Octaviabutler) and a mountain on the moon Charon (Butler Mons).\n\nSuzy McKee Charnas\n\nHer first two novels of The Holdfast Chronicles – Walk To The End of the World (1974) and Motherlines (1978) – depict two societies: one where men dominate women and another where women live free and independent of men. Motherlines caused controversy when Ballantine Books refused to publish it (despite publishing her first book) because there were no male characters in the book. It would go on to win the 1996 Retrospective James Tiptree Jr. Award. HA!\n\nNaomi Mitchison\n\nAlthough born in 1897 her first true SF novel wouldn’t get published until she was 65 years old. Memoirs of a Spacewoman (1962) is just that, a series of space “travelogues” depicting the biology and ecology of other planets as written by an astronaut telepath named Mary.\n\nAs the society rolled into the ’80s and ’90s science fiction would undergo some drastic changes. How did the women writers of this movement handle these changes and who were they? Stay tuned for part four."
