        "text": "I teach English at a community college and have recently revived a \"Science Fiction as Literature\" class. I haven't read much science fiction recently, but I read a lot in the '70s and '80s. This year the class focused on dystopian fiction and there were many excellent texts to choose from. Next year I'd like to do the topic described above. I can think of a few older short stories--Arthur C Clarke's \"Reunion\" and Theodore Sturgeon's \"The 'Widget,' the 'Wadget,' and 'Boff'\" but I'd like to find some novel-length works and some more modern short stories as well as a couple of films. I appreciate any suggestions you might have.\n\nThanks\n\nI am not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for but the first thing that came to mind is The Mote in God's Eye by Niven and Pournell. Just about my favourite Novel.A good deal of it involveshow the aliens understand us, and we them.\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100365.The_Mote_in_God_s_Eye?ac=1\n\nThe Mote in God's Eye is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, first published in 1974. The story is set in the distant future of Pournelle's CoDominium universe, and charts the first contact between humanity and an alien species. The Mote in God's Eye was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards in 1975.\n\nThe Mote In God's Eye is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel of mankind's first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre. And as space-opera spectacle, it has withstood the test of time -- a true original, as clever as it is imaginative. Set in the year 3017, when man has long colonized space, it tells an engrossing tale of first contact, utterly inhuman aliens who harbor a dark secret, and humanity's unique solution to a potentially dangerous situation. The Alderson drive has made it possible for humans to shunt between systems in zero time, and, having never encountered another intelligent species, man reigns supreme. Or so it seems -- only a ship appears out of nowhere, bearing an emissary from a civilization totally alien in creed and culture, yet our equal in power and technology. Before contact can be established, the emissary is accidentally killed, and a danger signal transmitted across space. Commander Roderick Blaine of the Imperial Space Navy knows full well the implications of that unfortunate encounter. Now he and his crew are forced to make a desperate voyage to find the visitor's home world and try to convince its alien inhabitants of humanity's good will. But will they listen? Will they accept Earth's offer to be equal partners in a peaceful universe? Or will they permit nothing less than an all-out galactic war for supremacy?\n\nHow exactly would you interpret \"Outsiders\"? Specifically \"aliens\" or just \"non-human\"? The reason I'm asking is that two of Stephen Baxter's Mammoth trilogy (all three collected in Behemoth) - Silverhair and Longtusk - feature humans directly (known as \"the Lost\" and \"Fireheads\" respectively, I think - been some time since I've read them) while Icebones is set on a Mars abandoned by humans, and all three are told from the viewpoint of a fictional intelligant mammoth with the premise that the mammoths were sentient and had their own culture.\n\nOther than that, the nomination by ImaginaryEvents for The Pride Of Chanur would also be a good fit provided you're interested in a single human adrift in a multispecies alien culture (which is not aware of humans) rather than a look at human culture in general. There isn't any contact with human space in that book.\n\nA lot of the stories in the Man-Kzin Wars shared-universe setting are told from the viewpoint of the kzinti as well (\"evolved monkeys\" as seen through the eyes of large carnivorous felinoids).\n\nAs Seen from the Outside\n\nA few suggestions:\n\n\"Dragon's Egg\", \"Camelot 30K\" and \"Rocheworld\" all by Robert Forward. All are stories about interesting aliens and their reactions to humans.\n\n\"Rite of Passage\" by Alexei Panshin. Classic \"coming of age\" story that I read for a science fiction course in undergraduate school. Most humans live in orbital colonies but as a rite of passage must live for a time among more primitive ground-living humans (or humanoid aliens? Can't remember which; it was a long time ago).\n\n\"Rule of Three\" by Theodore Sturgeon Short story of about 25 pages. Involves two tripartite energy beings who inhabit six humans. Task is to eventually get back together which proves difficult and requires some non-traditional pairings. Requires some maturity on the part of the reader, but I don't remember anything graphic.\n\nCharlie"
