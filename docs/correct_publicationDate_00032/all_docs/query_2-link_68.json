        "text": "Seeing this gigantic hardback tome on sale at half-price books for one dollar made me decide to give Cherryh another shot despite my mediocre reviews. The idea of some sort of war involving a mystical fortress and time travel sounded like fun, but don't let the title fool you. The plot here was virtually nothing to do with the fortress in question, and there's certainly no element of time travel here to speak of.\n\nInstead, this book is cut from the same cloth as any of your standard fantasy/political intrigue works. For the first 100 or so pages, as the book follows the main character, Tristan, the writing is certainly a different style than I'm used to. I was initially intrigued, then ready to move on, then bored, then physically turning the pages to see if there would EVER be dialogue at any point. After that, the book got marginally better (by about halfway through, when the political machinations finally got into full swing), but it certainly didn't grab me and hold me. It took some effort to finally get through this book, and it was more to get it over with than any real interest (it took me the better part of a month to read this, both because it was rather boring and because my wife and I were house-hunting and house-buying, with all that entails, at the time).\n\nIf you want to read something similar in this genre but much better, try Brust, Glen Cook (Bragi Ragnarson books), Feist, Bujold (more sci-fi, though) or countless others."
