        "text": "Synopsis: Humanoid aliens find the origin world of an interstellar world which brought hope for their culture a million years ago. Finally, they are certain that they’ve found it.\n\nBut what about the mysterious creators who sent out the probe? Alas, they didn’t get out of their home world: a disastrous meteorite wiped out all life on the planet millions of years ago.\n\nTwo prominent figures meet on the planet: one is the Lord Navigator in his fifth clone instantiation, who controls the aliens’ battleships. He wants to witness the findings of a famous, genius scientist who is a quarter million years old, hibernating away most of the time, only to wake up when something promising has been found.\n\nBut does their culture really want to know about the extinction?\n\nReview: SF Grandmaster Cherryh is still publishing! I’ve read some of her Space Operas like Downbelow Station or Cyteen back in the 1980s (yes, I need to copy my reviews from GR to this blog) but didn’t come back to her writing for the last several years. Looking at isfdb, I found that she published two novels for her long running Foreigner series just last year.\n\nThis novelette is part of Vandermeer’s Big Book of SF. The editors attributed it with “anthropological SF”, and I didn’t know that as a subgenre. I clearly need to check out the SF encyclopaedia which has it as a theme. It makes sense because of the title:\n\n“We find a great many of these. Mass production. Industry. Not only on this continent. This same bottle exists in sites all over the world, in the uppermost strata. Same design. Near the time of the calamity. We trace global alliances and trade by such small things.” She set it down and gathered up a virtually complete vase, much patched. “It always comes to pots, Lord Desan. By pots and bottles we track them through the ages. Many layers. They had a long and complex past.”\n\nIs it too much of a spoiler by giving away our own Earth as the origin planet of the probe? It was obvious early on that it was Pioneer with its famous plaque. Pioneer-10 had passed Neptune in 1983 and turned into Deep Space after that encounter. Was that the driver for this story? You know, it’s always fun digging into NASA history based on stories like this. Half a star on top for this fun!\n\nI also loved how Cherryh played with the often seen trope of “humans research million years old alien artefacts”, like in Clarke’s The Star (review). It feels like a dialogue with those stories, mirroring their religious angle, the awe of the revelation. That way, it spins a nice thread in this anthology. Alas, the reader has to find that one for themselves by wading through countless numbers of other stories. The anthology is huge!\n\nThe story itself could have been far tighter without giving up the plot or characters. I don’t know other short stories by the author, and maybe have to read her Collected Stories to see if she just isn’t an author for the shorter side of reading. Her prolific, no, huge body of work is in Space Opera and Planetary Romance novels. She might need just more words to grab the plot and characters.\n\nI don’t regard it as a must-read of SF short stories, haven’t seen it in other lists. So, only a recommendation for fans of the author!"
