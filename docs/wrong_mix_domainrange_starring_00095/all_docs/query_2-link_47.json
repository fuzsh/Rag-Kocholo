So fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride....er, \"night.\"\n\nPS: Just in case you're wondering what happened to the memes from the Batman movies, they are now on a separate page.\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 also has its own section of memes for films that it has MSTed.\n\nPlease add entries in the following format:\n\nThe name of the film.\n\nMeme name: description of meme and how it's used.\n\nSource of meme and fandom it relates to in the form of a hot tip.\n\nFamous instances (such as the Rick Roll during the Thanksgiving parade).\n\nFurther mutations and successor memes, if any.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nOpen the pod bay doors, Hal.\n\nI'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.\n\nFrequently combined with The League of Gentlemen quotes. \"Hello, DAAAAAAAAVE?\"\n\n\"My God! It's full of stars!\"\n\n300.\n\nMost common is an exchange that is initiated when one person mentions Madness Tropes, triggering the other to respond, \"Madness? This...is...SPARTAAA!!!\" [1]\n\nIt's been so overused that some forumites have already gone meta, responding to mentions of Sparta with, \"Sparta? This...is...[INSERT MEME HERE]!!!\"\n\nWhen we talk about the trope created through that line on this very wiki, we will type! WORDS! LIKE! THIS!\n\n\"Madness? PUNCTUATED! FOR! EEEMPHAASIIISSSSS!!!\"\n\nA lesser parody is also taken from the quote \"Tonight we dine in HELL!!\" Example here [2]\n\nHello? Is this HELL Restaurant? I want a reservation for 300!\n\n... I forget where we are dining tonight.\n\nSo we're going to Olive Garden.\n\n'SPARTANS! WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION!?!'\n\nUsing \"THIS IS SPARTA!\" with a character pointing at a map of Greece has become a sub-variant.\n\nNaturally, it led at least one person to shout, \"THAT! WAS! ATHENS!\"\n\nOne can only imagine what is going to happen when The companion short to Watchmen comes out on DVD: This...is...THE BLACK FREIGTAHHHHHH!\n\nAnd how can we forget: THIS! IS! SPARTAAAAAAAAAAA-DADADADADDDADAAAAAADADADADA!\n\nTHIS! IS! <FOO>!\n\nRobot Chicken used this to [dead link] hilarious effect.\n\nOn Errant Story [1]\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\n\nThanks to Steve Carell's titular character, one is now allowed to describe breasts as feeling like \"bags of sand\" and not receiving weird looks.\n\n\"You know how I know this page is gay?\"\n\nYOOOOOWWWWW, KELLY CLARKSON!\n\n9\n\n\"THIS IS SMASHING!!!\" It didn't actually appear in the film, but who gives a fuck, it's awesome.\n\nAlso, \"You owe me a cape.\" And since the release of the Russian dub, \"We'll blow this shit up\" has been quite popular, too.\n\nAce Ventura\n\nAllllllrighty then!\n\nLIKE A GLOVE!\n\nReee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-heeally...\n\nLa-hoo-sa-her!\n\nLAAAAAAA...AAAAAA...AAAAAH!!! [3]\n\nHoly Testicle Tuesday!\n\nDo NOT...go in there!\n\nLACES OUT! [4]\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\n\nAnd no more fucking ABBA!\n\nAir Force One\n\nGET OFF MY PLANE!\n\nAirplane!:\n\nLooks like I picked the wrong week to quit memes.\n\nI just wanted to tell you good luck. We're all counting on you.\n\nSurely you can't be serious!\n\nI am serious. And don't call me Shirley.\n\nDrinking problem.\n\nI speak jive\n\nA meme, what is it? A meme is an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture but that's not important right now.\n\n\"CALM DOWN, GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!\"\n\n\"[He/She/I] had the fish.\" [5]\n\n\"Yes, yes, I remember, I had lasagna.\"\n\nThis made a hilarious appearance in Allo Allo when Herr Flick was convulsing on the floor after a failed assassination attempt on somebody else. When asked what was wrong with him Helga replied \"He had the fish\" when everybody was served chicken.\n\nAlien\n\nIn space, no one can hear you scream.\n\nIn space, no one can hear you chachacha!\n\nI can't believe no one mentioned the Chest Burster!\n\nOh no. Not again.\n\nAliens\n\nDo not fuck each other over the goddamned percentage!\n\nGame over, man! GAME OVER!\n\nI say we nuke these memes from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.\n\nThey're comin' outta the walls!\n\nBecause they mostly come at night. Mooostlly.\n\nGET AWAY FROM HER, YOU BITCH!\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nRock stars have kidnapped my son!\n\nI AM THE GOLDEN GOD!\n\nAmerican Pie\n\nGod bless the Internet.\n\nApple pie, huh? McDonald's or homemade?\n\nStifler's mom is a MILF. M.I.L.F.= Mom I'd Like To Fuck.\n\nMILF! MILF!\n\nThis one time, at band camp...\n\n\"OH FINCH!\" \"OH STIFLER'S MOM!\"\n\nAnaconda\n\nStupid surprised panther!\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\n\nMost anything that comes out of Brick Tamland's (Steve Carell) mouth. He loves lamp, and he DOESN'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE YELLING ABOUT!\n\nLLLLLOOOUUDDD NOISES!\n\nI'M IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION!\n\nMilk was a bad choice.\n\nGo fuck yourselves, San Diego!\n\nDon't act like you're not impressed.\n\nSex Panther. 60% of the time, it works all the time.\n\nAnd Justice for All:\n\n\"You're out of order!\"\n\nAnimal House\n\n\"ASSUME THE POSITION!\" \"THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER!\"\n\n\"They took the bar! The whole fucking bar!\"\n\n\"Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?\" \"...Germans?\" \"Forget it. He's rolling.\"\n\n\"Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I needed that.\"\n\n\"Toga, toga, TOGA!\"\n\n\"They're taking everything, even the stuff we didn't steal\"\n\n\"Seven Years of college down the drain\"\n\n\"I can't believe I threw up in front of X\" \"You threw up on X\"\n\n\"As of this moment, they're all on DOUBLE SECRET probation!\"\n\n\"Rick Stanton. Rush Chairman. Damn glad to meetcha!\" - Otter shakes pledge's hand\n\n\"I'm a zit. Get it?\"\n\nAntichrist\n\nCHAOS! REIGNS!\n\nApocalypse Now\n\n\"I love the smell of napalm on the morning... smells like victory\" (which omits a large, offensive part of that speech). Also \"Charlie don't surf\" and \"The horror... the horror...\" (which was also in the book).\n\nTerminate... with extreme prejudice.\n\nA nonverbal one is the repeated use of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries for any grand attack scene in any situation ever. It even made it onto Farscape.\n\nCouldn'ta! Couldn't escape if I wanted to!\n\nApollo 13\n\n\"Houston, we have a problem.\" [6]\n\nArmy of Darkness\n\nAlright, you primitive screwheads, listen up. See this? THIS... is my BOOMSTICK!\n\n\"Give me some sugar, baby.\"\n\n\"Well helloooo, Mr. Fancy-pants!\"\n\n\"Groovy.\"\n\n\"Shop smart. Shop S-mart.\"\n\n\"I'm Bad Ash. You're Good Ash. You're goody little two-shoes. Goody little two-shoes, goody little two-shoes~\"\n\n\"Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.\"\n\nAsh himself is also a Memetic Badass. Not surprising, considering the guy cut off his own possessed hand then attached a motherfucking chainsaw to the stump.\n\nName's Ash. Housewares.\n\n\"Hail to the king, baby.\"\n\nAustin Powers\n\nYeah baby!\n\nShagadelic baby, yeah!\n\nOh, behave!\n\nZip it!\n\nI demand the sum... OF ONE MILLLLLION DOLLARS!\n\nOne... Hundred... BILLION DOLLARS!\n\nOne BILLION...TRILLION..GAZILLION....yen.\n\nYou shot me! You shot me right in the arm! * bang*\n\nYou know, I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with Frickin' Laser Beams attached to their heads!\n\n[Any bewilderingly twisty explanation of the effects of time travel]; Oh no, I've gone cross-eyed.\n\nI Love Gold\n\nGET.IN.MY.BELLY!\n\nOh no! I lost my mojo!\n\nMOOOOOLE! MOOOOOLE! MOLEY MOLEY MOLEY MOOOOOLE!!\n\nAvatar\n\nNeytiri's line \"YEEWWW AHHHRRR LIEK A BEY-BEE!\" is the biggest thing in youtube poop since the CDI Zelda games.\n\nI was a marine. A, uh, warrior... of the Jarhead clan.\n\nThis is great!\n\n\"With your permission, I will speak now. You would honor me by translating. The Sky People have sent us a message... That they can take whatever they want. That no one can stop them. Well we will send them a message. You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you... You tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Makto calls to them! You fly now, with me! My brothers! Sisters! And we will show the Sky People... That they cannot take whatever they want! And that this... this is our land!\"\n\n\"Why does the human marine side with the space furries again?\" Michael Ironside: They sucked his brains out.\n\n\"Humans RULE, Navi can SUCK IT!\"\n\n\"Colonel Quaritch Does Not Give A Fuck.\"\n\n\"I need to take some SAMPOLZ\"\n\nThis is why we're here: because this gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo.\n\nEYWA HAS HEARD YOU!\n\nThe movie also inspired a lot of \"If I were an Avatar, I will look like this\" pictures.\n\nBen Stiller's appearance in the 2010 Oscars. Enough said.\n\n\"You mated with this woman?!\" \"Oh shit.\"\n\n\"I didn't sign up for this shit.\"\n\nThe Avengers:\n\n\"Big man in a suit of armor. Take that away and what are you?\" [7]\n\n\"Genius billionaire playboy philanthropist?\"\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\n\"NAKED!\"\n\n\"Hulk? Smash.\" [8]\n\n\"Kids, it was the summer of 2012 when your Aunt Robin joined the Avengers.\" (Or a variation thereof.) [9]\n\nBack to The Future:\n\nAnything that Doc says!\n\n\"EIGHTY EIGHT MILES PER HOUR!\"\n\n\"If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.\"\n\n\"1.21 jiggawatts.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\"\n\n\"What are you lookin' at, butthead?\"\n\n\"SLACKERS!!!\"\n\n\"This is heavy.\"\n\nMemes? Where we're going, we don't need... memes.\n\nMANURE! I hate manure!\n\nJust wanted to remind everyone that hoverboards don't work on water.\n\nUNLESS YOU'VE GOT POWER!\n\nHey, McFly!\n\nHello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh? Think, McFly, think!\n\nBad Boys\n\n\"Shit just got real.\"\n\nBad Teacher: \"IT'S THE ONLY ARGUMENT I NEED, SEAN!\" Has become a default when arguing with someone on a message board shockingly fast, as well as a hilarious catchphrase due to the 2011 NBA Finals.\n\nBattlefield Earth\n\nPerhaps the only good line to come out of it, played for all of its hammy and cheesy worth by John Travolta:\n\nHave you ever seen one? A DEMON! A MONSTER! A BEAST! YAAAAH!!\n\nBeing There\n\nChance the gardener likes to watch. (Boy, does this meme get muddled. He means television!)\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nWe believe in nothing!\n\nYou're not wrong; you're just an asshole.\n\nShut the fuck up, Donny!\n\nYou're out of your element!\n\nYOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY? DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS?\n\nNo, you mean \"find a stranger in the Alps.\"\n\nThe Little Lebowski Urban Achievers. And how proud we are of all of them.\n\nThey peed on your fucking rug.\n\nIt really tied the room together.\n\n'Chinaman' is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please.\n\nThe Dude abides. (Also a Homage to The Night of the Hunter)\n\nInterestingly in a Memetic Mutation of its own. Since Jeff Bridges played both The Dude, and Obadiah Stane in the Iron Man movie, this troper has seen avatars and banners with Obidiah in sunglasses saying alternately \"the Dude Abides\" and \"The Dude does not abide.\"\n\n... well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.\n\nLet me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes * click* .\n\nJesus.\n\nYou said it, man. NOBODY FUCKS WITH THE JESUS.\n\nEight- year-olds, Dude.\n\nSmokey, this is not 'Nam. This is bowling. THERE ARE RULES.\n\nMark it eight, Dude.\n\nMARK IT ZERO!\n\nYou are entering a world of pain, Smokey. A world of pain.\n\nI'm calmer than you are.\n\nDo you have to use so many cuss-words?\n\nWhat the fuck are you talking about?\n\nFuck the tournament. Fuck you, Walter.\n\nFuck the tournament?\n\nWhat does The Dude do for recreation? Oh, the usual. He bowls. Drives around. The occasional acid flashback.\n\nI don't [X] on Shabbos!\"\n\n\"Shomer Shabbos!!!\"\n\nNo funny stuff!\n\nFuck it Dude, let's go bowling.\n\nI've got to find one of those ATM's.\n\nBilly Madison\n\nMr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\nOkay, a simple 'wrong' would have done just fine, but eh...\n\nO'doyle rules.\n\nIf there is any attempt for either contestant to cheat, especially with my wife, who is a dirty dirty tramp, I'm gonna snap.\n\nBirdemic\n\n\"Just hangin' out, hangin' out, hangin' out with my family!\"\n\nSo much so, it's become a shared Running Gag between the reviewers on That Guy With The Glasses.com.\n\nBlack Robe:\n\nYou can tell who has seen Black Robe because they laugh if you shout out \"DEMONS FEAR LOUD NOISES!\"\n\nBlack Swan\n\nI'M THE SWAN QUEEN.\n\nYou had a sex dream about me? Was I good?\n\nBlazing Saddles\n\nQualifications?\n\nRape, murder, arson, and rape.\n\n...you said rape twice.\n\nI like rape.\n\nStampeding cattle.\n\n...That's not much of a crime.\n\nThrough the Vatican?\n\nKinky!\n\nMongo! Santa Maria!\n\nNow gather 'round here folks and... HOLY SHIT!!\n\nNever mind that shit! HERE COMES MONGO!\n\nMongo only pawn ... in game of life.\n\nThat's Hedley!\n\nHey, where da white women at?\n\nBadges? We don't need no stinking badges!\n\nBadgers? We don't need no stinking badgers!\n\n\"Bagels? We don't need no stinking bagels!\"\n\nIt's twue! It's twue!\n\nBlue Velvet\n\n\"HEINEKEN? FUCK THAT SHIT! PABST BLUE RIBBON!\"\n\nHere's to your fuck!\n\nBABY WANTS TO FUCK!\n\nDON'T YOU FUCKING LOOK AT ME!!!!!\n\nMOMMY! MOMMY!\n\nBorat\n\nMost, if not all, of Borat's Catch Phrases.\n\nThanks to the movie Bottle Rocket, signaling someone with \"Ca-CAW!\" is now a popular pastime.\n\nThe Boys in the Band\n\n\"Who do you have to fuck to get a drink around here?\"\n\nWhich re-memed after it was quoted by Family Guy's Brian. \"Whose leg d'ya have to hump to get a dry martini around here?\"\n\nBraindead\n\n\"I KICK ARSE FOR THE LORD!!\"\n\nBraveheart\n\nThey may take our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!\n\nFREEEEEEEEE-DOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!\n\nBreakin\n\nApplying the words \"Oddly-Named Sequel 2: Electric Boogaloo\" to not just film sequels, but to the second anything in any series.\n\nX Harder also works for this purpose.\n\nBrian Blessed\n\nDid someone say...Brian Blessed?!?!?!?!\n\nBring It On\n\nThese aren't spirit fingers. THESE ARE SPIRIT FINGERS!\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nThese cowboys wish they knew how to quit you.\n\nWant to make instant Ho Yay? Make a Brokeback montage.\n\nAnother popular meme is to put Jake's sister with another actress[10] in Brokeback 2: Best Movie Ever.\n\nBruce Almighty\n\nB-E-A-utiful.\n\nBack to you, fuckers!\n\nHow many fingers am I holding up?\n\nSeven.\n\nA-HAH! [[[Beat]]] GAH!\n\nSmite Me, O Mighty Smiter!\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\n\"Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?\"\n\n\"I can't swim!\" *riotous laughter* \"What's so funny?\" \"Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill ya!\"\n\nRules. In a knife fight? No rules!\n\nCabin Fever\n\nPANCAKES! PANCAKES!\n\nDoctor Mambo!\n\nRabbit surgery.\n\nOoh, faced!\n\nCaddyshack\n\n\"You'll get nothing and like it!\"\n\nThis movie spawned enough memes among guys that a 1999 Saturday Night Live sketch featured host Bill Murray advertising the leather-bound tome The Quotable Caddyshack.\n\nCarry On series\n\n\"Treachery! Infamy! Infamy - they've all got it 'in for me'!\"\n\nCasablanca\n\nWe are shocked, shocked, we say, to find that Louis Renault has found gambling going on in a certain establishment in Casablanca!\n\nYour winnings, sir.\n\nOh, thank you very much.\n\nLouis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\nHere's looking at you, kid.\n\nPlay it, Sam. Play \"As Time Goes By\".\n\nPlay it again, Sam.\n\nOf all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.\n\nRound up The Usual Suspects.\n\nWe'll always have (insert place here).\n\nYou despise me, don't you?\n\nIf I gave you any thought, I might.\n\nCasino\n\nFUCK ME!?

YOU LOSE! GOOD DAY SIR!\n\nThe snozzberries taste like snozzberries!\n\nThere is no earthly way of knooooooowwing...\n\nAnd from the 2005 Tim Burton version: \"Everything in this room is eatable, even I'm eatable! But that is called \"cannibalism,\" my dear children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies.\"\n\nDon't touch that squirrel's nuts! You'll make him crazy!\n\n\"Dave's not here, man!\" (from one of the Cheech and Chong pictures) has also been extremely popular.\n\n\"Okay, is Dave there?\"\n\nChinatown\n\nForget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\n\nShe's my sister! She's my daughter! She's my sister AND my daughter!\n\nI SAID I WANTED THE TRUTH!\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nRosebud. It Was His Sled.

FLAMES ON THE SIDE OF MY FACE.\n\nTim Curry would like to remind everyone HE'S NOT SHOUTING! Ok, he is! HE'S SHOUTING HE'S SHOUTING HE'S SHOU-(Thunk).\n\nI DIDN'T DO IT!!!\n\nCon Air\n\nPut the bunny back in the box.\n\nI said... put... the bunny... back... in the box.\n\nConan!

But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?\n\nGo ahead. Make my day.\n\nGo ahead! Make my millennium!\n\nNow, get off my lawn.\n\nSix. Definitely six.\n\n...

So, you're stuck with mostly undefinable whipped mint crap, mindlessly wolfed down when there's nothing else to eat while you're watching the game. Sure, once in a while you get a peanut butter cup or an English toffee but it's gone too fast and the taste is fleeting. In the end, you are left with nothing but broken bits filled with hardened jelly and teeth-shattering nuts, which, if you are desperate enough to eat, leaves nothing but an empty box of useless brown paper.\n\nLife is like a box of chocolates. You open it up, and most times somebody's taken a bite out of each and every one. That's when I gotta pull out my piece and blow their friggin' head off. That's all I gotta say about that.\n\nLife is like an Overly Long Gag. It starts off interesting, but then it just drags on for too long.\n\nBut if it drags on long enough, it gets interesting again.\n\nLife is like a jar of jalapenos... what you do today could end up burning your ass tomorrow.\n\nI guess life is kinda like a crab cake. There's some good stuff in the middle, but mostly it's surrounded by a bunch of crap.\n\nAnd lest we forget: \"Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. There's, um, shrimp kebabs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

D.\n\nNothing is written.\n\nSnakes on a Plane:\n\nThe most famous line from Snakes on a Plane (involving exasperation and much profanity) came from an Internet parody that emerged less than a month after Samuel L. Jackson was signed to the film. It then made its way into the film...\n\nAnd the Bowdlerized version of that line (\"monkeyfighting snakes on this mondaytofriday plane\") counts. Hell, it may even be better than the original line!\n\nThe Social Network\n\nA million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?

(The opening text scrawl for all 6 movies).\n\nA bad Chinese subtitle job of Episode III, specifically the Big No scene, spawned the Internet Catch Phrase \"Do Not Want\".\n\nDarth Vader's Big No scene in general is popular because of its Narm.\n\nSo popular, they made it available in their first Vader soundboard. Without the background music, for once.\n\nBeyond the Big No itself, the decision by George Lucas to edit it into the original trilogy has met with some mockery.\n\n\"If you only knew the power of The Dark Side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.\" \"He told me enough! He told me you killed him!\" \"No, Luke, I am your father.\" \"No...that's not true!

UNLIMITED...POWERRRRRRRR!\n\nAdmiral Ackbar's exclamation \"It's a trap!\" has spawned a number of jokes and image macros, either with the original words or some pun thereof; this seems to be a Cyclic Trope, waxing and waning periodically.\n\nInterestingly, the meme seems to have further mutated since it began- originally Ackbar was a memetic Captain Obvious who pointed out traps that anyone could easily notice; since then, he has become a Memetic Badass who is able to detect any trap, regardless of how devious or well-hidden it is.\n\nIt's a trap!\n\nWith the clap!\n\nIt's a part!\n\nIt's a TARP!\n\nIt's a fap!\n\nTRAP!\n\nIt's an attack!\n\n\"Our [x] can't repel fire of that magnitude!\"\n\nHan shot first.\n\nAll over Luke/Lando/Chewie\n\nForce Push!\n\nIt's Ascended Meme: There is a Force push power in some of the games.\n\nThese aren't the droids you're looking for...\n\nYou don't want to sell me any death-sticks.\n\nK'Kruhk's hat is freakin' sweet.\n\nI find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nUse the force, Luke!\n\nLuke, trust me!\n\nThe Force is strong with this one.\n\nCome over to The Dark Side...\n\nWe have cookies!\n\nIt's quiet.

Sometimes a word other than \"terror\" is also used. Or sometimes were not silenced, and they are still going.\n\nHow wude!\n\n\"How would YOU know the hyperdrive's been deactivated?! The city's central computer told you? R2-D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer!\"\n\nAny and all of R2-D2's trademark beeping.

Drink. Your. MILKSHAKE!\" Entertainment Weekly posted an article vilifying the transformation of this line into a meme. For all the good that did.\n\nScout certainly picked up on it, though.\n\nI AM THE THIRD REVELATION!\n\nI'VE ABANDONED MY BOOOOOOY!!!!\n\nThey Live!\n\nThe Cool Shades, which gave us this piece of political satire.\n\nBy the way, Roddy Piper has come here to Chew Bubblegum. And kick ass. And he's all outta bubblegum.\n\nPUT ON THE GLASSES!\n\nThe Thing\n\nHow do you dispose of The Thing? Kill It with Fire!\n\nIf I were an imitation... a perfect imitation... how would you know it was me?\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap:\n\n\"These go to 11.\"\n\nThe volume control on the BBC's flash video player does go to 11.\n\nThe irony is that one of the first amps for electric guitars, made by Fender, went to 12... It is often joked about on many guitar forums.\n\n\"There's a fine line between stupid and...uh...\" \"...clever\".\n\n\"It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none.

The fact that it's Tony Jay doing the voice probably helped.\n\nMoney!\n\nTombstone\n\nCurly Bill's \"Well...bye\". Powers Boothe's delivery seals it.\n\nTo Sir, With Love\n\nThe very title of Mr. Poitier's other great film, To Sir With Love.\n\nTotal Recall\n\nYOU BLEW MY COVER!!!\n\nHow long did it take us to mention Total Recall in the first place?

Out there... is our destiny!\"\n\n\"The game has changed, son of Flynn!\"\n\nTropa de Elite\n\nThe Brazilian movie Tropa de Elite (The Elite Squad, for the foreigners). In the country it was produced, it generated a lot of memetic mutations due to the good number of catchphrases, jokes, and situations (the narrator and arguably protagonist Captain Nascimento became a Memetic Badass). But due to an overly literal and polite translation instead of a Cultural Translation, most of the jokes are lost, and the protagonists were seen as fascists. At least the grenade scene will still be understood.\n\n\"Cê não é caveira! Cê é muleque! Cê é minino!\" (\"You're not a Skull! You're a boy!

Do your thing, skin the fucking bastard. Go to town, man. Go to town! In the mean time and as usual, go fuck yourself.\n\nWelcome to the goodie room! I'm talking... G5, unknown troper! That's how you can roll. No more frequent flyer bitch miles for my boy! Oh yeah! Playa... playa! Big dick playa!\n\nSwinging past ya knees!\n\nWhat do you mean, \"you people\"?\n\nWhat do you mean, \"you people\"?\n\nSuck my unit.\n\nI'm just like a little boy, playin' with his dick when he's nervous.\n\nI know what dude I am.

This refers to a widely circulated fan-redub of a scene from the '90s era X-Men cartoon.\n\nSpeaking of X-Men, when the first movie came out, this exchange was very popular.\n\nSNIKT!\n\nMagneto!

Computer gamers refer to this process as \"pwnage\".\n\nHence, mounts on MMORPGs may be referred to as \"pwnies\".\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno\n\nBecause of a certain scene in the movie, \"Take It Barry\" has come to be used to refer to the rather unusual sex act depicted in said scene.\n\nZardoz\n\nTHE PENIS IS EVIL!\n\nZombieland\n\nNut up or shut up.\n\nThis week's Zombie Kill Of The Week goes to Sister Cynthia Nickerbocker.\n\nThe poor flat bastard.\n\nThere's rules you have to obey in order to survive in a world like this.\n\nRule #1: Cardio, the fatties were the first to go.\n\nRule #2: Double Tap, just to make sure.\n\nRule #3: Beware of bathrooms.\n\nZoolander\n\nIt's become a meme to take a .gif file of the scene where Derek and his friends are dancing around while driving in a car and placing the heads of other fictional characters on them.\n\nA [Blank] for ANTS?!"
