        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone have entered the world of Barbie. A Twitter user has recreated his popular badminton sequence to the song Dhoom Tana from his 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om. The sequence has been redrawn via artificial intelligence (AI) in pink colors from the world of Barbie, as depicted in Greta Gerwig’s new Hollywood adaptation of the Mattel doll. (Also read: Mira Kapoor Reviews Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling’s Barbie: “Hollywood Can’t Sing and Dance Like Bollywood”)\n\nShah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone play badminton in the world of Barbie\n\nSRK and Deepika’s badminton sequence\n\nThe video shows Deepika and Shah Rukh’s part from Farah Khan’s reincarnation drama where they are recreating the iconic song Dhal Gaya Din Ho Gayi Shaam, with Jeetendra and Leena Chandravarkar from TR Ramanna’s 1970 romantic drama Humjoli.\n\nFarah choreographed and conceptualized the original segment of Om Shanti Om, a part of the Dhoom Tana track, where Shah Rukh and Deepika recreate various timeless songs from Hindi cinema. The new song sees the two actors, backdancers and stage drenched in pink and lavender, with Dua Lipa’s Barbie song Dance the Night playing in the background.\n\nTwitter user @qualiteaposts shared the video and wrote in the caption: “SRK and Deepika in Barbie (2023).”\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nBarbie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, along with a cast that includes names like America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Dua Lipa, Emerald Fennell, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, and Will Ferrell. The film’s premise stated, “After being kicked out of utopian Barbie Land for being less than perfect dolls, Barbie and Ken embark on a journey of self-discovery into the real world.”\n\nThe Hindustan Times review of Barbie said: “Greta is also quite forgiving of satire, constantly reiterating how she is reshaping the Barbie mythos. The humor, therefore, lands only occasionally, though one quietly admires the shots that are fired with each line. But the tone, a mix of self-awareness and explanation, remains consistent throughout.”\n\n2023-07-25 12:59:21\n\n#Shah #Rukh #Khan #Shanti #Deepika #Padukone #Play #Badminton #Barbie #World"
