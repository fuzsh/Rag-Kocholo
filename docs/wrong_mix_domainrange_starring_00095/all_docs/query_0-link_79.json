Orientation A soul builders novel by Habiburrahman El-Shirazy entitled “Ketika Cinta Bertasbih 1”, has made a movie. The movie was done in Egypt especially in the Cairo city, Nile, Pyramid, Sphinx, Alexandria city, Mediterranean Sea, and Fort Qait Bay. The moviewasplayedbyOki Setiana Dewi (Anna), Kholidi Asadil Alam (Azzam), Andi Arsyil Rahman (Furqon), Alice Norin (Eliana), Lucky Perdana (Fadhil), Tika Putri (Tiara), Deddy Mizwar (KH.

It was said that the movie adaptation of the novel MEGA BEST SELLER Habiburrahman El-Shirazy's work also requires a large funds that may be enough to make 7 standard movie. The players were obtained from the auditions. Because of that, many new faces in this movie. Interpretative recount “Ketika Cinta Bertasbih 1” begins with the view of Egypt from above. The story continued with Khairul Azzam’s journey, he was an Indonesian student who studied in Al Azzhar University, Egypt. He hadn’t graduated yet for nine years because he prefered work to study. His father had died, so he had to feed himself and his family in Solo. He sold meatball and Tempe which was the taste was so delicious, until his sales were well-known to Egyptian’s KBRI and also it had introduced him with Eliana Pramesti, the daughter of Mr. Alam, Indonesia's ambassador in Egypt.\n\n3. Because of Eliana’s life style didn’t fit with Azzam, so Mr. Ali suggest Azzam to propose Anna Althafunnisa, she was a stratum 2 of Kuliyyatul Banaat in Alexandria. Azzam asked Ustadz Mujab to help him to propose Anna because Azzam didn’t have money to return to Indonesia to meet Anna. Unfortunately, Anna had been proposed by Furqon, Azzam’s friend. He was a rich boy and smart. Furqon would finish his final examination. He chose to stay in hotel to study. But, he had been tricked by a bunch of racketeers and had been infected with AIDS. This incident had made a dilemma for Furqon to stay married with Anna or not. Because he knew that it will destroy Anna’s life. Besides, there was a story about Azzam’s friends in his rented house. Many kinds of love stories had been here. The saddest story is when Fadhil sings a song in Tiara’s wedding. The song is intended to Tiara, the girl who loved Fadhil. The story continues with the story of Azzam’s sister, Ayatul Husna. Husna sent good news to Azzam, she told Azzam that he did not need to send money again to his family, because now Husna had worked. Husna’s salaries were sufficient to feed her family. Azzam miss his family so much, so he decided to focus on study to finish it as soon as possible, and finally he has graduated. Azzam kept his promise to return to Indonesia and find soul mates there. Evaluation - Kholidi played as Azzam were acting well , animating , and is perfect playing the character Azzam resilient and diligent and obedient in faith and miss his family. For the first movie , I think Kholidi very successful . - Oki played as Anna were contested men who is not arbitrary . Not much different from Kholidi acting , Oki's act also good , moreover this is girl's first movie who also had many another achievements. - Alice played as Eliana is none other than the beautiful daughter of the Ambassador who intelligent and free , very successfully describing it . This may be because Alice is already several times so the main star in a soap opera on television. She played so nice. - Arsyil Andi Rahman , he is a player that I think is quite weak in acting . To appear as Furqan who older than her age , handsome , smart and generous, I saw he very successful . But , if I look at the dialogue and expression , sometimes less convincing . Just look at the scene where he was met Azzam in the exhibition of Indonesian cuisine . Very excessive."
