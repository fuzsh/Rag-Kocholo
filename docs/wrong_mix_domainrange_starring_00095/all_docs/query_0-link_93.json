        "text": "TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL\n\nManhattan, New York\n\nJUNE 7-18, 2023\n\nTribeca At Home: June 19-July 2, 2023\n\nUS Narrative Competition\n\nBAD THINGS\n\nFEATURE | United States | 83 MINUTES | English\n\nNew York, Horror, Women, Drama, LGBTQIA+, Thriller\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nFor a group of friends in the Northeast, a weekend getaway at a snowy resort sounds like just what the doctor ordered. An opportunity to reconnect, relax, and recuperate among serene, snow-capped mountains and trees. But peace doesn’t last long as the ghosts of guests past and relationships long buried come to light. Soon enough, their trip transforms into a psychological tailspin and bloody nightmare, as both long-deceased guests and the space itself come to life, and the group turn on each other in a race to stay alive.\n\nIn this haunting thriller, a new variation of psychological horror invites audiences to question the limitations of our contemporary relationships with people and spaces, and the implications of undealt trauma. Gayle Rankin gives a blistering lead performance as she battles forces within both the rundown resort and her own mind in an attempt to save her friends, who are brought to life by rising talents Hari Nef, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, and Rad Pereira.––Casey Baron\n\nDirector: Stewart Thorndike\n\nProducers: Lizzie Shapiro, Lexi Tannenholtz\n\nCast: Gayle Rankin, Hari Nef, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, Rad Pereira, Jared Abrahamson, Molly Ringwald\n\nCYPHER\n\nFEATURE | United States | 89 MINUTES | English\n\nWomen, Music, Mystery\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nTierra Whack first gained recognition at the age of 15 when she stunned viewers with her slick poetry while rapping for a YouTube channel on a Philadelphia street. The video rapidly drew thousands of views and marked the first of Tierra’s many performances for the camera. Years later, director Chris Moukarbel begins documenting her astronomical rise, going behind the scenes of concerts and music videos as she navigates fame and receives exalted praise from stars like Erykah Badu and Billie Eilish. One night, after a particularly tiring set, a seemingly innocuous fan interaction begins a series of increasingly unsettling events that swirl around Tierra and her team — even following them to Dubai. They soon start questioning who is filming whom and whether being seen (or watched) is a desirable and unavoidable part of fame.\n\nCypher is a visually rich, self-aware, and captivating artistic showcase that opens as many doors of perception as it closes. Weaving together different aesthetics and highlighting the strangeness that surrounds the music industry, Moukarbel’s filmmaking convinces the viewer to happily follow him down a warren of rabbit holes. It’s a riveting, intricate story, but who is telling it?––Jarod Neece\n\nDirector: Chris Moukarbel\n\nProducers: Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, John Hodges, Tierra Whack, Sanjay M. Sharma, Roya Rastegar, Anthony Seyler, Chris Moukarbel\n\nCast: Tierra Whack\n\nTHE GRADUATES\n\nFEATURE | United States | 87 MINUTES | English\n\nDrama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nGenevieve (Mina Sundwall) is up against an unsettling senior year as she faces the one-year mark of a tragic school shooting that took her boyfriend. What should be a time of growth, anticipation, and pride is marred with trauma and loss that feels like purgatory rather than progress. As she gets closer to graduation, decisions seem impotent. That feeling is collectively shared by her friend Ben (Alex R. Hibbert) who transferred schools, her mother (Maria Dizzia) and the school basketball coach, heartbreakingly played by John Cho.\n\nIn her feature directorial debut, Hannah Peterson captures the somber and vulnerable feeling of a community coping with loss. Employing assured filmmaking , Peterson is able to sit in melancholy, discomfort, and senselessness while still maintaining hope. Executive produced by Chloé Zhao, the film ushers in new talent with a similar skill of capturing contemplation.––Nora Bernard\n\nDirector: Hannah Peterson\n\nProducers: Josh Peters, Saba Zerehi, Taylor Shung, Jessamine Burgum\n\nCast: Mina Sundwall, Alex Hibbert, Yasmeen Fletcher, Ewan Manley, John Cho, Maria Dizzia, Kelly O’Sullivan\n\nLOST SOULZ\n\nFEATURE | United States | 95 MINUTES | English | English subtitles\n\nDrama, Music, Expressions of Black Freedom\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSol (Sauve Sidle) is an aspiring young rapper living with his best friend Wesley (Siyanda Stillwell), whose family has embraced him as a brother. After a raucous night causes Wesley to overdose, Sol abandons him at a house party, and eventually chooses to leave home for good and join a touring group of hip-hop artists. As they travel across Texas creating and performing, he discovers who he is as an artist and person.\n\nSet to a lo-fi, genre-bending hip-hop soundtrack, Katherine Propper creates a hazy and enigmatic energy that compliments her leading man’s guilt and desire for friendship and belonging. Numerous musical performances, whether in their van or on a stage, allow the ensemble’s chemistry to shine. This film will be a crowd-pleaser to fans of Soundcloud rap and film alike.––Nora Bernard\n\nDirector: Katherine Propper\n\nProducers: Andres Figueredo Thomson, Juan Carlos Figueredo Thomson\n\nCast: Sauve Sidle, Siyanda Stillwell, Aaron “Seven” Melloul , Krystall Poppin, Alexander Brackney, Micro TDH, Malachi Mabson, Tauran Ambroise\n\nMOUNTAINS\n\nFEATURE | United States | 95 MINUTES | Creole, English, Spanish | English subtitles\n\nDrama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nXavier Sr. works in demolition and dreams of buying a new house for his wife Esperance, who works as a seamstress. They are Haitian immigrants living in Miami, and deeply entwined with their local community, participating in street parades, communions, and games of dominoes. Their adult son Xavier Jr., on the other hand, is a college dropout who has had to move back home. While his parents speak Creole, Junior predominantly responds in English, reflecting his wish to fit into his chosen society. Even so, he mines his Haitian background for material for a nightly stand-up routine that he keeps secret.\n\nDifferent generational experiences are sensitively portrayed in Monica Sorelle’s visually arresting feature debut, which paints a loving portrait of a community being slowly chipped away by gentrification. Xavier Sr. is acutely aware of what his job really means but is trapped by circumstance, whereas Junior struggles to find a place for himself in not one but two communities, all the while dealing with his father’s mountain of expectations.––Casey Baron\n\nDirector: Monica Sorelle\n\nProducers: Robert Colom\n\nCast: Atibon Nazaire, Sheila Anozier, Chris Renois\n\nTHE SECRET ART OF HUMAN FLIGHT\n\nFEATURE | United States | 107 MINUTES\n\nMystery\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nAfter the sudden and tragic loss of his wife, Ben (Grant Rosenmeyer) turns to a mysterious self-help book that will train him to learn how to fly. Or at least he hopes, as he turns his life upside down under the advisement of an eccentric spiritual guide (Paul Raci) who may very well be a con artist. Fending off his worried sister and an ambitious detective who is convinced he killed his wife, Ben risks it all to fly in an effort to get through his grief.\n\nWriter-director H.P. Mendoza deftly walks the line between absurdity and the seriousness of loss and grief. This endearing story has the perfect dose of melancholy and poignancy with a ton of laughs. Raci, in particular, is a hilarious delight as a guide with a shady past. An altogether delightful, whimsical film and a great tale of grief and healing. ––Faridah Gbadamosi\n\nDirector: H.P. Mendoza\n\nProducers: Grant Rosenmeyer, Tina Carbone, Benjamin Wiessner\n\nCast: Grant Rosenmeyer, Paul Raci, Lucy DeVito, Nican Robinson, Reina Hardesty, Maggie Grace, Sendhil Ramamurthy\n\nSMOKING TIGERS\n\nFEATURE | United States | 85 MINUTES\n\nWomen, Drama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nStaggered by the separation of her parents, a Korean-American girl struggles to find herself. Caught between supporting both parents in their work while longing for their old life together and burdened by the responsibility of a younger sibling, few things seem to be falling into place. Upon starting a new year of high school among wealthy elites, she also has to balance the duality of her new friends and low-income reality.\n\nA selection from Tribeca’s Untold Stories collection in 2022, So Young Shelly Yo marks her feature directorial debut with this film about traversing the demands of being a young, first-generation American grappling with teenage angst while lifting up the family members struggling (and at times flailing) around you. The intimacy of parent-child relationships and friendships between young women grab the audience’s attention and subvert expectations around what it means to support one another through many lenses.––Casey Baron\n\nDirector: Shelly Yo\n\nProducers: Guo Guo\n\nCast: Ji-Young Yoo, Jung Joon Ho, Abin Andrews, Erin Choi, Erin Yoo, Phinehas Yoon\n\nSOMEWHERE QUIET\n\nFEATURE | United States | 98 MINUTES | English\n\nHorror, Thriller\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nMeg (Jennifer Kim) is trying to readjust to normal life after recently being involved in a heinous abduction. To recenter herself, she takes a trip upstate with her husband Scott (Kentucker Audley) to stay at his wealthy family’s countryside compound. An excursion like this offers the kind of peace that Meg deserves to regain her sense of normalcy — but those plans get swiftly disrupted when Scott’s upper-class cousin Madeline (Marin Ireland) arrives unannounced. Madeline’s insertion into their activities causes Meg’s recent traumatic memories to resurface through eerie hallucinations and nightmares. While Scott tries to attend to the emotionally fraught Meg, she begins to clash with Madeline’s aristocratic personality. The conflict brings out passive-aggressive behavior that makes Meg question her sanity while also coming to terms with the truth behind her kidnapping.\n\nFilmmaker Olivia West Lloyd delivers an engrossing, unsettling thriller in her feature directorial debut.

Desi yearns to one day leave her beachside community of Boca Chica behind and achieve fame and recognition as a singer. She keeps this yearning a secret from her family, specifically the women in her life who have raised her. Her occasional confidante is her older brother, Fran, who lives a facade of his own in New York City as a struggling musician who sheepishly works as a food delivery worker. When news arrives that the siblings’ cousin, Elvis, is coming to Boca Chica to marry his wealthy, older, American fiancée, it opens up past tensions and latent trauma in their family. Meanwhile, a restless Desi meets a group of Dominican teens — also aspiring singers and rappers — that lights a spark in her artistic pursuit.\n\nAnchored by an arresting lead performance by Scarlet Camilo, Gabriella A. Moses’ feature directorial debut is an eye-catching, grounded coming-of-age drama that thoughtfully depicts a determined young girl rising above toxic and traumatic circumstances in pursuit of a musically attuned, artistically fueled future. ––Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Gabriella A.

As it is a rite of passage for teenagers everywhere, the trio decides to commemorate this milestone with a road trip. Once settled in Italy, the trio embarks in search of adventure. On the road, they pick up an intriguing backpacker, Zoe, who tags along on their journey. But when they stumble across an abandoned village, the quartet starts to experiment with the limits of their newly found freedom, away from the expectations of their parents and teachers.\n\nGerman filmmaker Anna Roller’s feature directorial debut is a beautifully shot yet intimately scaled film. Sharply realized characters populate the story, with compelling performances by all four leads helping to bolster a contemplative, lived-in tone. With Dead Girls Dancing, Roller displays the subtle, steady hand of a filmmaker wise beyond her years and makes a bold statement as a director to watch.––Jason Gutierrez\n\nDirector: Anna Roller\n\nProducers: Katharina Kolleczek, Lea Neu, Laure Parleani, Bérénice Vincent, Christian Becker, Uli Putz\n\nCast: Luna Jordan, Noemi Liv Nicolaisen, Katharina Stark, Sara Giannelli\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nFEATURE | Israel | 80 MINUTES | Arabic, Hebrew | English subtitles\n\nAction, Women, Drama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nWhen Israel’s Minister of Space and Tourism is murdered in the lead-up to the country’s first mission to the moon, Yaffa (Samar Qupty), a young Arab university student from the occupied West Bank, confesses to the murder. Scientist Nurit (Reymond Amsalem) asks for permission to interview the assassin. As the pioneer of The Future Project, an algorithm-based program meant to predict acts of terrorism (or, if you’re Palestinian, resistance), Nurit is convinced that the unrepentant Yaffa is withholding her whole motivation. The two women face off, determined to give nothing away, over a potentially fraught series of encounters. As the truth is exposed — and the spacecraft carrying a nation’s dreams nears its destination — an increasingly disillusioned Nurit inches towards a profoundly troubling realization.\n\nWriter-director Noam Kaplan’s second feature is a taut, engrossing drama that pares the struggle for liberation down to its essence. Suffused with a potent irony, and powered by two riveting performances, The Future balances sympathy for its main characters with a lucid, unsentimental grasp of the issues at stake. It’s an intelligent and bracingly searching film that lingers after it ends.––Jonathan Ali\n\nDirector: Noam Kaplan\n\nProducers: Yoav Roeh, Aurit Zamir\n\nCast: Reymonde Amsellem, Samar Qupty, Dar Zuzovsky, Aviva Ger, Salwa Nakkara\n\nJE’VIDA\n\nFEATURE | Finland | 103 MINUTES | Finnish, Skolt Sámi | English subtitles\n\nDrama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nWith a face hardened by years of hurt, chain-smoking Lida carries the weight of a life defined by the shame and marginalization directed at her as a Sámi woman in contemporary Finland. Though strangers, she sets out alongside niece Sanna to clear out their long-held family home in preparation for its sale. Lida’s instinct to burn anything and everything connected to her past is quickly overcome by memories of a warm childhood spent fishing with a loving grandfather; of railing against the boarding school that tried to beat the Sámi identity out of her; and of being a young woman whose only option was a marriage that could take her far away from her Native roots. Lida finds herself facing a powerful reckoning with her past and a quiet reclaiming of her true self: Je’vida.\n\nFilmed in black and white, director and co-writer (with Niillas Holmberg) Katja Gauriloff has crafted a film of stark, powerful beauty — the first ever to be filmed in the Skolt Sámi dialect, only spoken by roughly 300 people. Centered by a searing and unforgettable performance by Agafia Niemenmaa, Je’vida is a lyrical testament to the bonds of ancestry and the resilience of Native peoples.––Cedar Sherbert\n\nDirector: Katja Gauriloff\n\nProducers: Joonas Berghäll, Satu Majava, Anna Nuru\n\nCast: Agafia Niemenmaa, Heidi Juliana Gauriloff, Sanna-Kaisa Palo, Seidi Haarla, Erkki Gauriloff, Matleena Fofonoff\n\nMARINETTE\n\nFEATURE | France | 95 MINUTES | English, French | English subtitles\n\nWomen, Drama, LGBTQIA+, Biography, Sports\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nFrom the first moment she kicked a ball, Marinette Pichon’s life would revolve around soccer. Although her hometown in rural France didn’t have a girls’ team, her talent spoke for itself, and staying focused on the ball helped keep Marinette distracted from a toxic home life. As she ages out of the local boys’ team she is spotted by a talent scout and invited to play for the national women’s team. Her home life deteriorates as her career takes off, but since female soccer players weren’t (and still aren’t) recognized as professionals in France, there’s a limit to how far she can go. Incensed by this injustice and tired of battling competitive teammates, she jumps at an exciting offer to sign with a professional team in Philadelphia, becoming the first French player to do so. Her life in the U.S. could not be more different — she can eat what she wants, and doesn’t have to hide her sexuality.\n\nAccompanied by a decade-appropriate electronic soundtrack, this energetic film traces the life of one of the best French soccer players of all time, and her lifelong struggle to be treated equally in a country to which she has given so much.––Frederic Boyer\n\nDirector: Virginie Verrier\n\nProducers: VIGO Films, Virginie Verrier\n\nCast: Garance Marillier, Emilie Dequenne, Sylvie Testud, Fred Testot, Alban Lenoir\n\nRICHELIEU\n\nFEATURE | Canada, France | 90 MINUTES | French, Spanish | English subtitles\n\nDrama, Latinx/Latin American\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nTrying to get her life back on track after a breakup, Ariane moves back to her hometown and in with her mother. To save her sinking finances, she takes a job at the local corn plant as a French-to-Spanish interpreter for the seasonal migrant workers employed there. She befriends Manuel, an illiterate, naive young man who has left his small children behind in Guatemala to earn as much as he can in Canada. As Ariane begins to witness how the workers are being taken advantage of, and as the only one who seems to see them as real people, she finds it increasingly difficult to keep quiet. What unites all of them, from boss to migrant worker, is a deep desperation to keep their job, but the individual choices they make in the face of mounting pressure reveal everyone’s true character.\n\nAvoiding saccharine moralization, director Pier-Philippe Chevigny manages to inject empathy into every scene. Ariane Castellanos gives a captivating performance, with tortured compassion emanating from the screen. Richelieu is an incredibly strong debut feature that examines the terrible circumstances people can live through, and the individual cost of doing the right thing.––Frederic Boyer\n\nDirector: Pier-Philippe Chevigny\n\nProducers: Geneviève Gosselin-G., Miléna Poylo, Gilles Sacuto, Alice Bloch\n\nCast: Ariane Castellanos, Marc-André Grondin, Nelson Coronado, Marvin Coroy, Maria Mercedes Coroy, Luis Olivia, Micheline Bernard, Eve Duranceau, Gerardo Miranda\n\nSILVER HAZE\n\nFEATURE | Netherlands, UK | 102 MINUTES | English\n\nDrama, LGBTQIA+\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nThe fire that left 23-year-old Franky (Vicky Knight, giving a fierce, powerful performance) burned happened 15 years ago. But she still carries those physical and emotional scars, which both gives her cover to put up walls between herself and people who love her and provides her with a drive for justice. Working as a nurse in the same hospital where her life was saved, Franky is beloved by her patients—including Florence (Esme Creed-Miles), who is there recuperating from a suicide attempt. The two women fall in love, news that is not well received at home for Franky. So, the pair run away to the more welcoming environment of Florence’s patchwork family. But Florence’s erratic behavior and Franky’s deep anger make for a combustible relationship.\n\nBuilding off the work they did together in their previous film, Dirty God, writer-director Sacha Polak and star Knight train a sharp observational eye on young, working-class British women; together they create intensely felt and authentic portraits of two wounded souls. Stylistically calling to mind classic British kitchen-sink realism, Silver Haze captures a working-class England that reflects the women at the heart of the film: raw and unvarnished, but beautifully poetic.––Jason Gutierrez\n\nDirector: Sacha Polak\n\nProducers: Marleen Slot, Mike Elliott\n\nCast: Vicky Knight, Esmé Creed-Miles, Charlotte Knight, Archie Brigden, Angela Bruce\n\nA STRANGE PATH\n\nFEATURE | Brazil | 84 MINUTES | Portuguese | English subtitles\n\nDrama, Mystery, Latinx/Latin American\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nDavid, an experimental filmmaker, returns to Brazil for the first time in ten years when his feature film is set to premiere at a local festival. Although he has returned for work, his thoughts increasingly turn to his father, whom he hasn’t seen since he left. As news of the Covid-19 pandemic spreads and rumors of an impending lockdown intensify, David changes his ticket in hopes that the festival will eventually continue — but decisions are soon out of his control. Finding himself without a phone or a place to stay, David ends up on his father’s doorstep. They begin an uncomfortable coexistence as David simultaneously tries to get to know his father and gain his interest. The old man, however, proves to be inscrutable and capricious as increasingly odd things start to happen around them.\n\nDirector Guto Parente makes use of experimental footage throughout the film to convey David’s mood and accentuate the twists and turns of his journey. A Strange Path is a deeply personal story about family and belonging. Ultimately, what keeps David in Brazil is more than just the pandemic. Will he get the closure he is looking for?––Casey Baron\n\nDirector: Guto Parente\n\nProducers: Ticiana Augusto Lima\n\nCast: Lucas Limeira, Carlos Francisco, Tarzia Firmino, Rita Cabaço, Renan Capivara, Ana Marlene\n\nDocumentary Competition\n\nBETWEEN THE RAINS\n\nFEATURE | Kenya | 82 MINUTES | Other, Swahili | English subtitles\n\nDocumentary, Environmental, Nature\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nDocumenting the Turkana-Ngaremara community as they contend with prolonged drought, this visually stunning coming-of-age story follows a young, orphaned man’s journey to adapt to radically changing climate conditions in Northern Kenya. Kolei, the film’s primary subject, must grapple with personal tragedies alongside complex tribal conflicts brought on by environmental catastrophes in his pastoral region. With these mounting communal tensions and rapidly shifting culture, the threat of climate change is not just a looming notion but a present reality.\n\nBy threading interpersonal scenes with sweeping landscape cinematography, this documentary provides an intimate look at a vulnerable population fighting to bridge tradition with new circumstances. The visceral, near-consuming anxieties of the sensitive Kolei contextualize how global crisis affects individuals. Through this lens, the film lays a framework for a collective reckoning on how to strive with the ecological perils shaping the world and eventually facing us all.––Shakira Refos\n\nDirector: Andrew H.

Named after the Nineteenth Amendment, The 19th became the first nonprofit, nonpartisan news agency in the United States. Its mission is to focus on the impact of national politics and policy on women. However, by the time Emily and co-founder Amanda Zamora had secured funding and officially launched The 19th’s news site, the pandemic hit — and the very fabric of society went into a tailspin.\n\nBreaking the News immerses its audience in the lives and steadfast pursuits of the members of The 19th — women and LGBTQ+ journalists — as they struggle to launch the agency and work to gain traction for their newsroom amidst shuttered news outlets and an upended America. With spirited storytelling, the directorial trio of Heather Courtney, Princess A. Hairston, and Chelsea Hernandez provide an inquisitive and dynamic view into the inner workings of this news agency as its journalists disrupt entrenched biases and push for accountability.––Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Heather Courtney, Princess A.

When May visits Kari in Sweden and decides to buy an apartment in the area to be closer to her, both sisters end up experiencing a divine sign at one particular apartment that prompts them to buy it. However, once they convene to buy it, they witness a shocking revelation that turns their lives upside down: the seller looks identical to their older sister Astrid, who committed suicide some thirty years before. What’s even more unusual: Olaug, the seller of the apartment, used to go by “Lita,” the same distinctive nickname as Kari and May’s deceased sister.\n\nThe sisters recruit director Maria Fredriksson to pursue these unusual circumstances, and the filmmaker is thrust into uncovering secrets and eerie mysteries of a bizarre family story. Fredrikkson’s The Gullspång Miracle is a mesmerizing and consistently surprising documentary that epitomizes the ‘stranger than fiction’ narrative. Replete with comically awkward situations and one engrossing revelation after another, the film is a deft exploration of identity and the consequences of stubborn beliefs.—Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Maria Fredriksson\n\nProducers: Ina Holmqvist\n\nTHE LIONHEART\n\nFEATURE | United States | 104 MINUTES\n\nAction, Women, Documentary, Drama, Romance, Biography, Sports\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nIn the sport of IndyCar racing, there was little Dan Wheldon hadn’t achieved. The British-born driver—winner of the IndyCar Series Drivers’ Championship, key member of a winning team at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and two-time victor of the Indianapolis 500—was a tremendous racer. He was gregarious and confident, yet also self-effacing. He was a man deeply devoted to his wife, Susie, and two young sons, and widely respected and well liked throughout the sport. His death in 2011 at an event in Las Vegas shook motorsports to its core.\n\nTen years later, Susie Wheldon still finds herself at the racetrack every weekend. Except now she’s there to support her sons, Sebastian and Oliver, as they follow in their father’s on-track footsteps. Laura Brownson’sThe Lionheart is a sensitively observed and deeply felt documentary, one that is at once a portrait of Dan Wheldon himself, a testament to the strength and resilience of Susie Wheldon, and an exploration of the generational reverberations that bind fathers and sons. But perhaps most impactfully, it’s a look at how both honoring a legacy and working through grief can happen by adopting a view loved by a father: the racetrack from behind the wheel of a car.––Jason Gutierrez\n\nDirector: Laura Brownson\n\nProducers: Chapman Way, Maclain Way, Laura Brownson\n\nCast: Michael Andretti, Dario Franchitti, Tony Kanaan, Scott Dixon, Bryan Herta, Chip Ganassi, Sam Schmidt\n\nMAESTRA\n\nFEATURE | United States | 88 MINUTES | English, Greek | English subtitles\n\nWomen, Documentary, Music\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nFollowing the buzz of Tár, Maggie Contreras’ documentary Maestra follows several women from around the world as they compete in the only all-women competition for conductors. This ultra-competitive field is riddled with long-standing issues of sexism, and each participant is approaching the contest with fierce tenacity.\n\nThrough her efforts in profiling these women, Contreras reveals how childhood abuse, maternity discrimination, and gendered expectations have molded them as individuals. These disparate experiences paradoxically unite them in a common cause while distinguishing their priorities. One woman wonders whether she should start having children, while another wants to prove herself after being fired for being pregnant. In contrast to the wild gesticulations required of the competitors, Maestra is relatively laid back in its approach, taking time to familiarize us with each woman before the competition starts. Yet a palpable tension starts to build as the competitors are eliminated one by one, despite everyone being a champion.–– Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Maggie Contreras\n\nProducers: Maggie Contreras, Neil Berkeley, Emma West, Melanie Miller, Lauren Lexton\n\nCast: Marin Alsop, Deborah Borda, Mélisse Brunet, Ustina Dubitsky, Tamara Dworetz, Kwamé Ryan, Anna Sułkowska-Migon, Zoe Zeniodi\n\nQ\n\nFEATURE | Lebanon, United States | 91 MINUTES | Arabic, English | English subtitles\n\nWomen, Documentary\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nJude, a Lebanese-American cinematographer and filmmaker, has always known her mother Hiba to be a woman devoted to her Muslim faith. After growing up in a tight-knit family in the United States, Jude is now living back in Lebanon. The opportunity arises to spend time with her inscrutable mother to better understand Hiba’s spiritual devotion — specifically, her fervent commitment to an all-female religious order that has been operating clandestinely for decades. When she’s not teaching the Quran to students or taking part in poetry readings with peers, Hiba strictly obeys the detailed writings of the Anisa (the leader of the order) who instills in her followers the need to closely observe and practice full days of prayer. Jude pursues a cautious but determined questioning of this religious order’s stranglehold on her mother’s attention and blind devotion — a devotion that ends up causing an emotional rupture within their family.\n\nEmploying her skills as a talented cinematographer, filmmaker Jude Chehab crafts a commanding and assured first feature with kinetic aplomb and a visually-stunning cinematic approach. With Q, Chehab presents a respectful but altogether haunting exploration of faith, belief, and the ramifications of allegiance to a cause.––Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Jude Chehab\n\nProducers: Jude Chehab\n\nCast: Hiba Khodr, Ziad Chehab, Doria Mouneimne\n\nRICHLAND\n\nFEATURE | United States | 93 MINUTES | English\n\nDocumentary\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nEnvironmental workers poke and re-soil the land, working to clean up the now-uncontaminated areas that used to be replete with nuclear material. High school football players take the field for an evening game. Their uniforms, jerseys, and helmets proudly bear the symbol of a nuclear mushroom cloud. This is Richland, a town in Washington State next to the Hanford Nuclear Site from the early 1940s that used to house nuclear government workers at the height of the Manhattan Project. It’s also a town that produced weapons-grade plutonium for decades, and its citizens have pridefully embraced their identity. As one plutonium worker affirms about the mushroom cloud symbol, “People say ‘You need to change that.’ No, we don’t. We don’t need to change it. We don’t look at this as using it to kill people. This is what we accomplished.”\n\nWith sobering precision and emotional honesty, filmmaker Irene Lusztig constructs a portrait of an American town at a generational crossroads, its citizens embracing their polarizing origins or reckoning with their past. Lusztig’s Richland dissects a community’s preservation of identity and their views on dominance and security in America.––Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Irene Lusztig\n\nProducers: Irene Lusztig and Sara Archambault\n\nROCK HUDSON: ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWED\n\nFEATURE | UK | 105 MINUTES | English\n\nDocumentary, LGBTQIA+, Biography\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nWe all know Rock Hudson as one of the seminal actors of his generation. Starring in countless movies and television shows, he was often perceived as a charming good guy who knew just how to make women fall for him. However, his personal life couldn’t be farther from his typical roles. Due to Hollywood’s intense bigotry and homophobia, Hudson was unable to live as an out gay man — his sexuality was only revealed after his death from AIDS-related complications in 1985. We know of his Hollywood persona and his tragic death, but what about everything else in between?\n\nAcclaimed documentarian Stephen Kijak helms this portrait of Hudson’s life both on and off the screen. Piecing together his story using archival footage and testimonies from some of his closest friends, Rock Hudson: All That Heaven Allowed is a tribute to a trailblazer in LGBTQ+ media that was taken from us too soon. It also confronts the systems that kept him closeted for so many years, asking if progress in Hollywood for queer representation has truly been made.––Frederic Boyer\n\nDirector: Stephen Kijak\n\nProducers: Will Clarke, George Chignell, Carolyne Jurriaans, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter\n\nRULE OF TWO WALLS\n\nFEATURE | Ukraine | 76 MINUTES | English, Russian, Ukrainian | English subtitles\n\nDocumentary, Drama, Politics, Art, Journalism\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nDirector David Gutnik (Materna, Tribeca 2020) returns to the Festival with a raw, atmospheric portrait of today’s Ukraine through the lens of the artists who have chosen to stay. The film’s subjects are Gutnik’s intimate collaborators in exploring what it means to navigate the jarring rhythms and surreal juxtapositions of life under the shadow of war. A young couple wakes to air raid sirens and has tea on their balcony. Neighborhoods lie in ruins, and the community comes together to sweep up broken glass and rubble. Scenes of utter devastation provoke insomnia and numbness — yet friends gather to relax in a bar, an art center pushes ahead with a new exhibition, and artists redouble their commitment to their craft.\n\nWhile their lives are getting irreversibly altered, these subjects see their practice as a survival tool in a conflict aimed at cultural erasure as much as brute domination. The film beautifully documents how their work — as visual artists, musicians, street artists, performance artists, and filmmakers — both processes the moment and offers hope. Visceral, poetic, and urgent, Rule of Two Walls illuminates the vital role of cultural and spiritual defiance in times of crisis.––Robert Winn\n\nDirector: David Gutnik\n\nProducers: Olha Beskhmelnytsina, Sam Bisbee, Stacey Reiss\n\nCast: Lyana Mytsko, Stepan Burban, Bob Basset, Kinder Album, Bohdana Davydiuk, Diana Berg\n\nSTYLEBENDER\n\nFEATURE | New Zealand | 102 MINUTES | English\n\nDance, Biography, Sports\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nBecoming a G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) is about more than just being talented in your sport — it’s about building a legend around yourself, which doesn’t come naturally to many athletes. Just ask the mixed martial artist and UFC champion Israel Adesanya, who quickly became a force to be reckoned with in the world of MMA throughout the 2010s. With his unique training background and even more unique inspirations, there’s no other fighter like him in the ring.\n\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility, which documentarian Zoe McIntosh shows in Stylebender. Returning to Tribeca after the 2017 premiere of her acclaimed short, The World in Your Window, McIntosh traces Adesanya’s UFC career starting with his 2019 middleweight title win. In the process, she unwraps a fascinating portrait of the modern athlete, charismatic and complex in equal measure. UFC fanatics and those who have never seen a match will find Adesanya’s journey toward greatness captivating, engrossing, and illustrative of the larger-than-life personality you need to succeed in athletics.––Jose Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Zoe McIntosh\n\nProducers: Fraser Brown, Leela Menon, Tom Blackwell\n\nCast: Israel Adesanya, Eugene Bareman\n\nTAKE CARE OF MAYA\n\nFEATURE | United States | 103 MINUTES | English\n\nDocumentary\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nIn October 2016, Jack Kowalski took his 10-year-old daughter Maya to a hospital emergency room seeking help for extreme pain related to her documented neurological condition: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Just days later, Maya was declared a ward of the state after physicians suspected her mother, Beata, of child abuse. For the couple, it marked the beginning of a nightmare as they were cut off from their daughter who was held at the hospital against her will. With little recourse, they had no option but to comply. In the excruciating months that followed, Jack and Beata found themselves at the mercy of a flawed child welfare system and ultimately embroiled in a David and Goliath legal battle with devastating consequences.\n\nDirected by Tribeca alum Henry Roosevelt (Sixth of June), Take Care of Maya traces the Kowalskis’ harrowing plummet into the complex system referred to by some as the “child welfare industry.” Combining intimate access to a deeply personal story with elements of investigative journalism, this impactful film examines the lingering trauma left behind when families are torn apart. As infuriating as it is riveting, Maya’s story is a heartbreaking call to action.––Andrea Passafiume\n\nDirector: Henry Roosevelt\n\nProducers: Caitlin Keating\n\nTRANSITION\n\nFEATURE | United States | 89 MINUTES | Dari, English, Farsi | English subtitles\n\nDocumentary, LGBTQIA+\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nConflict documentarian Jordan Bryon is invited by a Taliban Commander to film the daily life of a Taliban unit after the fall of Kabul for the New York Times. A stressful assignment for any documentarian, but this assignment proves to be particularly tumultuous because Bryon is in the process of a gender transition. Undergoing gender transition is stressful in the best of times, but doing so in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s takeover puts it on a whole other level. Bryon takes us through his transition from starting hormones to undergoing top surgery in Iran. And ultimately, through the complicated relationship he develops with the Taliban fighters he is embedded with.\n\nTransition features extraordinary footage of Bryon hanging out with armed men when increasing friendliness creates unbearable tension. However, the film, directed by Monica Villamizar and Bryon himself, tempers any appetite for spectacle with a reflective tone about Bryon’s ethical duty, his awareness of the safety concerns of his friends and colleagues, Kiana, a female photojournalist, and Teddy, his cameraman, and his growing acceptance that his adopted home will never be the same. All this comes together for a knotty, achingly personal film that is grand in scope.––Faridah Gbadamosi\n\nDirector: Jordan Bryon, Monica Villamizar\n\nProducers: Monica Villamizar\n\nCast: Jordan Bryon, Farzad Fetrat, Kiana Hayeri\n\nSpotlight Narrative\n\nTHE ADULTS\n\nFEATURE | United States | 91 MINUTES | English\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nWhen Eric’s (Michael Cera) short trip back home turns into an extended stay, relationships with friends and family come to a head. The trip reunites him with his sisters, Rachel (Hannah Gross) and Maggie (Sophia Lillis), and unearths some old wounds as Maggie yearns to rekindle moments of their youth. At the same time, Eric falls back in with his old poker buddies, asserting his dominance as the best poker player in town. They gradually reveal their complicated inner lives, trauma, and relationships through theatrical performances and shared histories. The film’s strength lies in the cast’s nuanced performances and writer-director Dustin Guy Defa’s use of raw emotion and close-ups to convey the siblings’ complicated dynamic.\n\nWith top-notch performances from a talented cast, Defa returns to Tribeca with a personal and uplifting film that delves into family bonds and memories through the lens of a broken family trying to mend. The Adults is a well-crafted and affecting film that blends humor and heartache in a way that is both honest and relatable.––Jarod Neece\n\nDirector: Dustin Guy Defa\n\nProducers: Allison Rose Carter, Jon Read, Julia Thompson, Michael Cera, Hannah Dweck, Theodore Schaefer\n\nCast: Michael Cera, Hannah Gross, Sophia Lillis\n\nAFIRE\n\nFEATURE | Germany | 102 MINUTES | German | English subtitles\n\nDrama, LGBTQIA+, Art\n\nNew York Premiere\n\nAuthor Leon (Thomas Schubert) and photographer Felix (Langston Uibel) arrive at a beach house by the Baltic Sea to work on their respective artistic pursuits only to learn that they won’t be alone; Nadja (Paula Beer) will be joining them. She cooks delicious food, plays music late at night, and invites her maybe-boyfriend Devid (Enno Trebs) to join them, simultaneously irritating and intriguing Leon. As he finds himself drawn closer to her, the dry summer heat slowly transforms the forest around them into kindling for a raging fire.\n\nGerman auteur Christian Petzold reunites with muse Beer for his third collaboration with the actress after Transit and Undine in this eerily romantic character study. Punctuated by immersive audio and the song “in my mind” by Wallners, Petzold and his collaborators drop us in a dreamlike daze that feels both remarkably grounded and subtly delirious. Deeply relevant in its commentary on climate change while timeless in its approaches to romance and regret, Afire burns even brighter than the sum of its stunning parts.––Cyrus Cohen\n\nDirector: Christian Petzold\n\nProducers: Florian Koerner von Gustorf, Michael Weber, Anton Kaiser\n\nCast: Thomas Schubert Paula Beer Langston Uibel\n\nTHE BLACKENING\n\nFEATURE | United States | 96 MINUTES\n\nExpressions of Black Freedom\n\nUS Premiere\n\nSeven Black friends reunite at a cabin in the woods to celebrate Juneteenth. They ignite in friendly banter as they arrive, referencing old jokes like they just saw each other yesterday. But as night falls, things begin to go awry in the picturesque cabin. Lights go out and a masked archer stalks them from outside. Once they’re trapped in a room, the group must play the ultimate game: figure out who among them is the Blackest — or else they all die. So, who exactly is the Blackest of them all? And who will make it through the night?\n\nBased on the viral and acclaimed digital short, this uproarious horror comedy pits starring talent Dewayne Perkins, Grace Byers, Yvonne Orji, Jay Pharoah, X Mayo, and more against elements cultural and brutalistic. More subtly, the film dually unpacks and adds to our contemporary understanding of American Blackness and the individual biases people hold, whether in spite of or in line with their friends and family.––Casey Baron\n\nDirector: Tim Story\n\nProducers: Tim Story, Tracy Oliver, E.

Cliff (Scoot McNairy), a down-at-luck traveling salesman, loses his job before an opportunity presents itself by way of his old colleague, Ricky (Kit Harington). He is rightly hesitant but, running out of options, has no choice but to take Ricky up on the offer. He soon discovers he will be running drugs and guns across state lines for cartel leader John (Josh Lucas). During what should have been an easy assignment, Ricky shows his true colors, throwing both himself and Cliff into a fight for survival.\n\nBlood for Dust utilizes each of its main actors to their highest potential. McNairy brings a humanity to Cliff and we can’t help being on his side the whole way. Josh Lucas has never been scarier, and Kit Harrington gives a career-best performance — viewers will be stunned by his onscreen persona.

Starring Logan Marshall-Green, Bucky F**king Dent follows Ted, a Yankee Stadium peanut slinger writing the Great American Novel in his spare time. When Ted discovers his estranged, Red Sox fanatic father (played by Duchovny) has a terminal cancer diagnosis, Ted returns home to take care of the old man. While Ted’s father wants to make up for lost time and relive his youth, his health drops precipitously when the Sox take a loss. So Ted, along with a group of friendly locals, takes matters into his own hands and manufactures a winning streak. But it’s the 1978 baseball season and Bucky Dent is lurking…––Jason Gutierrez\n\nDirector: David Duchovny\n\nProducers: Jordan Yale Levine, Jordan Beckerman, Tiffany Kuzon, David Duchovny\n\nCast: David Duchovny, Logan Marshall-Green, Stephanie Beatriz, Jason Beghe, Evan Handler, Pamela Adlon, Daphne Rubin-Vega\n\nCINNAMON\n\nFEATURE | United States | 91 MINUTES | English\n\nComedy, Drama, Music, Romance, Thriller, Expressions of Black Freedom\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nAspiring singer Jodi Jackson (Tony nominee Hailey Kilgore) has a big voice and dreams to match but struggles to make ends meet as a gas station attendant whose boss (Damon Wayans) may not be on the up and up.

The two lovers hatch a plan to change their lives, but as the old proverb goes, “We plan, God laughs.” What follows is a journey in which they both must use their wits to survive.\n\nReminiscent of ‘70s blaxploitation films, with an outstandingly menacing performance from the genre’s queen, Pam Grier, this directorial debut from Bryian Keith Montgomery Jr. is a superfly thriller filled with intrigue, music, and a whole lot of heart.––Faridah Gbadamosi\n\nDirector: Bryian Keith Montgomery Jr.\n\nProducers: Oz Scott, Kevin Garnett\n\nCast: Damon Wayans, Hailey Kilgore, David Iacono, Jeremie Harris, and Pam Grier\n\nCOLD COPY\n\nFEATURE | United States, Canada | 91 MINUTES | English\n\nWomen, Drama, Thriller\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nEager to impress the esteemed-yet-cutthroat news reporter Diane Heger (Tracee Ellis Ross), ambitious journalism student Mia Scott (Bel Powley) desperately competes for her attention. With increasing pressure from Diane to outperform her peers, Mia finds a new angle for her latest story about an unsuspecting subject: precocious teen Igor Nowak (Jacob Tremblay). But her new approach involves manipulating his story — and the truth itself.\n\nThis kinetic drama is guided by the skillful hand of debut feature filmmaker Roxine Helberg, who delicately balances the fiery push and pull of her two leads. While Tracee Ellis Ross stuns with a magnetically austere turn, Bel Powley finds an alarming level of cunning to drive her character. With these two women pushing each other to their moral limits for the sake of a compelling story, journalistic integrity gets muddied in this timely piece that scandalizes at each beat.––Dominique Oneil\n\nDirector: Roxine Helberg\n\nProducers: Justin Lothrop, Brent Stiefel, Daniel Bekerman, Roxine Helberg\n\nCast: Bel Powley, Tracee Ellis Ross, Jacob Tremblay, Nesta Cooper\n\nDOWNTOWN OWL\n\nFEATURE | United States | 91 MINUTES | English\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nLife in a small town is always hard, but what about a small town that’s about to be hit with a once-in-a-lifetime snowstorm? That’s what the citizens of Owl, North Dakota are about to experience in the winter of 1984. This snowstorm – and the leadup to it – brings together three very different people: nostalgic football fan Horace (Ed Harris), newbie teacher Julia (Lily Rabe), and depressed quarterback Mitch (August Blanco Rosenstein).\n\nRabe teams up with her real-life husband, Hamish Linklater, to adapt Chuck Klosterman’s acclaimed 2008 novel for the duo’s directorial debut. Thanks to Linklater’s script and an ensemble cast that includes Henry Golding and a delightfully out-of-type Vanessa Hudgens, Downtown Owl harkens back to the anxieties and isolation of Reagan-era Middle America while looking towards a better future. Equal parts contemplative drama and quirky comedy, this unlikely crowd-pleaser proves that sometimes, the people you need most in your life are the people you’d least expect.––Jarod Neece\n\nDirector: Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater\n\nProducers: Bettina Barrow, Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Rebecca Green\n\nCast: Lily Rabe, Ed Harris, Vanessa Hudgens, August Blanco Rosenstein, Jack Dylan Grazer, Arianna Jaffier with Finn Wittrock and Henry Golding\n\nERIC LARUE\n\nFEATURE | United States | 119 MINUTES | English\n\nDrama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nMichael Shannon directs an adaptation of Brett Neveu’s 2002 play about a mother coping with the fallout after her son murders three of his high school classmates. Janice (Judy Greer) is struggling; she moves through life as if in a haze, unable to let go of her anger and frustration. While her husband (Alexander Skarsgård) has found refuge at a new church, Janice finds it hard to seek solace in her faith despite her pastor’s pleas to heal her wounds by meeting with the mothers of her son’s victims. As Janice ponders what that meeting could achieve for her and her community, Eric LaRue asks audiences to witness the frayed emotional ripples that violent acts can engender.\n\nAnchored by Greer’s deeply arresting performance, Shannon’s directorial debut grapples head-on with frustratingly timely conversations about who deserves our compassion and grace. Standout supporting turns by Tracy Letts and Alison Pill, who capture a subtly unnerving vision of spiritual fanaticism, stress the film’s interest in complicating facile views of atonement and forgiveness in light of such tragedies.––Manuel Betancourt\n\nDirector: Michael Shannon\n\nProducers: Sarah Green, Karl Hartman, Jina Panebianco\n\nCast: Judy Greer, Alexander Skarsgård, Alison Pill, Tracy Letts, Paul Sparks\n\nFIRST TIME FEMALE DIRECTOR\n\nFEATURE | United States | 97 MINUTES | English\n\nWomen, Comedy, Art\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nWith First Time Female Director, Chelsea Peretti wears all the hats.

When the theater’s director is fired for inappropriate behavior, Sam is thrust into the leadership role, where she quickly discovers that being a director may be a lot more challenging than she originally thought. Wanting to stage her dream production, a rural drama set in the South, Sam finds a bevy of issues (including a recalcitrant cast) awaiting her and threatening her latest work.\n\nFiltered through Peretti’s unique, wry perspective, First Time Female Director is an off-kilter, hilarious, but genuinely heartfelt tribute to the theater and joy of performance. Aided by a fantastic cast that includes the likes of Megan Mullally, Blake Anderson, Megan Stalter, and Kate Berlant (plus cameos that shouldn’t be spoiled), Chelsea Peretti’s first time out as a director is a memorable one.––Jason Gutierrez\n\nDirector: Chelsea Peretti\n\nProducers: Amy Poehler, Deanna Barillari, Chelsea Peretti, Kate Arend, Jordan Grief\n\nCast: Chelsea Peretti, Amy Poehler, Kate Berlant, Benito Skinner, Megan Stalter, Megan Mullally, Blake Anderson, Jak Knight, Natasha Leggero, Xosha Roquemore, Max Greenfield, Andy Richter, Tim Heidecker, Brad Hall\n\nFRESH KILLS\n\nFEATURE | United States | 120 MINUTES | English\n\nNew York, Women, Drama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nThe women of the Larusso crime family are no strangers to adapting to tough circumstances. In the wake of their world being unexpectedly uprooted, these women learn to fend for themselves in New York City during the late 20th century, even with the cards stacked against them. Led by their unsteady but loving mother Francine (Jennifer Esposito), two very different sisters — destructive Connie (Odessa A’zion) and dutiful Rose (Emily Bader) — are the next generation of women who must grow up in this turbulent world controlled by unspoken rules that dictate who they are and who they become.\n\nWritten and directed by first-time filmmaker Jennifer Esposito, this gritty mob drama with a feminist twist provides a layered, original look into the dynamics of a crime family by focusing on its usually invisible female members. With strong performances across the board — including powerful supporting turns from Annabella Sciorra and Domenick Lombardozzi — this gripping crime saga shows that ambition and violence are not solely the purview of men in the world of organized crime.––Karen Kemmerle\n\nDirector: Jennifer Esposito\n\nProducers: Leslie Owen, Jennifer Esposito, Christine Crokos, Samantha Sprecher\n\nCast: Emily Bader, Odessa A’zion, Jennifer Esposito, Domenick Lombardozzi, Annabella Sciorra, Nicholas Cirillo\n\nTHE GOOD HALF\n\nFEATURE | United States | 100 MINUTES | English\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nNick Jonas stars as Renn, an emotionally distant writer who returns to his hometown of Cleveland for his beloved mother’s funeral, after having spent years successfully avoiding interactions with his high-strung sister (Brittany Snow), bumbling but well-meaning father (Matt Walsh), and untrustworthy step-father (David Arquette). While in town, he forges a new relationship with a charming, energetic stranger (Alexandra Shipp) who pushes him to realize that he can’t avoid conflict forever — with his family or within himself.\n\nScreenwriter Brett Ryland cleverly constructs this intimate story by seamlessly weaving memories of Renn’s mother (Elisabeth Shue) into his journey as he confronts complex familial relationships with a refreshingly wry sense of humor — a reminder that grief and growth involve ups and downs, with pain and laughter along the way. An impressive directorial effort from Robert Schwartzman, featuring grounded and moving performances by a fantastic ensemble cast, this tender family dramedy offers an honest and nuanced approach to grief, regret, and healing.––Celeste Wong\n\nDirector: Robert Schwartzman\n\nProducers: Russell Wayne Groves, Robert Schwartzman, Brett Ryland\n\nCast: Nick Jonas, Brittany Snow, David Arquette, Alexandra Shipp, Matt Walsh, Elisabeth Shue\n\nHE WENT THAT WAY\n\nFEATURE | United States | 95 MINUTES | English\n\nComedy, Thriller\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nZachary Quinto and Jacob Elordi star in this wicked take on the buddy road trip.

Bobby just wants to make it to his destination, while Jim and Spanky have goals of their own. As stress between them rises and their fiery personalities combust, the road only becomes more treacherous the farther they go.\n\nThis film is as much about a found family as it is a volatile crime drama centered on a serial killer and his captives on the road.

At the forefront of this plight are the farmers and families who have lived through tragedy and illness at the hands of government policies that favor Big Ag and big profits. In acknowledging how racism has forged today’s farming industry, regenerative farmers are returning to pre-colonial practices pioneered by indigenous and Black farmers to restore soil, keep Americans alive, and leave a legacy for generations to follow.\n\nCommon Ground emphasizes the need to face the reality of our food systems and how profits and power are the driving force behind them. This issue affects all Americans, from the soil we stand on to the toxic air we breathe. Fighting against agro-chemical business in favor of regenerative farming is presented as a clear, bipartisan necessity for the health of our country, its people, and our collective future.––Daniela Leal\n\nDirector: Josh and Rebecca Tickell\n\nProducers: Rebecca Tickell, Josh Tickell, Eric Dillon\n\nCast: Laura Dern, Jason Momoa, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Ian Somerhalder, Donald Glover\n\nEVERY BODY\n\nFEATURE | United States | 92 MINUTES | English\n\nDocumentary, LGBTQIA+\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nIn a country obsessed with gender, intersex people are often erased entirely. Sean Saifa Wall, Alicia Roth Weigel, and River Gallo are here to change that. Recounting their individual experiences with stigma, social pressure, and nonconsensual surgeries performed on them as minors, these three make the case for the much-needed rethinking of both archaic medical practices and binary ideas of gender and sex.\n\nOscar-nominated and Emmy-winning filmmaker Julie Cohen (RGB, My Name Is Pauli Murray) allows her documentary participants to guide this intimate portrait of life in between and outside binaries and creates something wholly unique in the process. Combining personal testimony with archival footage, Cohen directly engages with our country’s transphobic history and exposes how little has evolved in the way intersex people are viewed and treated by medical professionals and society at large. However, as these three incredible individuals show in this fearless film, a better future is not only possible but near.––Cyrus Cohen\n\nDirector: Julie Cohen\n\nProducers: Tommy Nguyen, Molly O’Brien\n\nCast: Sean Saifa Wall, Alicia Roth Weigel, River Gallo\n\nHAPPY CLOTHES: A FILM ABOUT PATRICIA FIELD\n\nFEATURE | United States | 100 MINUTES | English\n\nNew York, Women, Comedy, Documentary, LGBTQIA+, Art, Biography, Fashion\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nCarrie Bradshaw’s tutu.

By then, several U.S. cities had already begun GBI pilot programs in which they provided $500 per month to a select group of people for one year. It’s Basic follows the progress of the program against a backdrop of widening income gaps, politics, and growing social concern.\n\nDirector Marc Levin follows a variety of participants as they use their incentives in ways that quash the stereotype of poor people abusing “free money”. From a formerly homeless single mother of four barely getting by with an “essential job”, to a low-wage working couple with a child, to one particular GBI program designed for newly released prisoners.

With Rob coming from a broken home and Fabrice having left an abusive household, they shared a similar upbringing, as well as a future goal: to become famous superstars.

However, their ascension to success came with a devastating price that ultimately brought their undoing.\n\nLuke Korem’s Milli Vanilli dissects the duo’s trajectory from their humble origins through their collaboration with legendary music producer Frank Farian — a toxic partnership that cemented the band’s fate and concealed a shocking secret about their music and craft.

For many people, this is simply a pipe dream that probably wouldn’t be scientifically feasible.
