        "text": "Huperzine A Provides Robust and Sustained Protection against Induced Seizures in Scn1a Mutant Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWong, Jennifer C.; Dutton, Stacey B. B.; Collins, Stephen D.; Schachter, Steven; Escayg, Andrew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDe novo loss-of-function mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) SCN1A (encoding Nav1.1) are the main cause of Dravet syndrome (DS), a catastrophic early-life encephalopathy associated with prolonged and recurrent early-life febrile seizures (FSs), refractory afebrile epilepsy, cognitive and behavioral deficits, and a 15â20% mortality rate. SCN1A mutations also lead to genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), which is an inherited disorder characterized by early-life FSs and the development of a range of adult epilepsy subtypes. Current antiepileptic drugs often fail to protect against the severe seizures and behavioral and cognitive deficits found in patients with SCN1A mutations. To address the need for more efficacious treatments for SCN1A-derived epilepsies, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Huperzine A, a naturally occurring reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In CF1 mice, Hup A (0.56 or 1 mg/kg) was found to confer protection against 6 Hz-, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-, and maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures. Robust protection against 6 Hz-, MES-, and hyperthermia-induced seizures was also achieved following Hup A administration in mouse models of DS (Scn1a+/â) and GEFS+ (Scn1aRH/+). Furthermore, Hup A-mediated seizure protection was sustained during 3 weeks of daily injections in Scn1aRH/+ mutants. Finally, we determined that muscarinic and GABAA receptors play a role in Hup A-mediated seizure protection. These findings indicate that Hup A might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for increasing seizure resistance in DS and GEFS+, and more broadly, in other forms of refractory epilepsy.

In particular, mutations in the SCN3A gene, encoding the pore-forming Nav1.3 Î± subunit, have been identified in patients with focal epilepsy. Biophysical characterization of epilepsy-associated SCN3A variants suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function SCN3A mutations may lead to increased seizure susceptibility. In this report, we identified a novel SCN3A variant (L247P) by whole exome sequencing of a child with focal epilepsy, developmental delay, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Voltage clamp analysis showed no detectable sodium current in a heterologous expression system expressing the SCN3A-L247P variant. Furthermore, cell surface biotinylation demonstrated a reduction in the amount of SCN3A-L247P at the cell surface, suggesting the SCN3A-L247P variant is a trafficking-deficient mutant. To further explore the possible clinical consequences of reduced SCN3A activity, we investigated the effect of a hypomorphic Scn3a allele (Scn3aHyp) on seizure susceptibility and behavior using a gene trap mouse line. Heterozygous Scn3a mutant mice (Scn3a+/Hyp) did not exhibit spontaneous seizures nor were they susceptible to hyperthermia-induced seizures. However, they displayed increased susceptibility to electroconvulsive (6 Hz) and chemiconvulsive (flurothyl and kainic acid) induced seizures. Scn3a+/Hyp mice also exhibited deficits in locomotor activity and motor learning. Taken together, these results provide evidence that loss-of-function of SCN3A caused by reduced protein expression or deficient trafficking to the plasma membrane may contribute to increased seizure susceptibility.

The channel is concentrated at the axon initial segment (AIS) and is involved in establishing neuronal excitability. Clinical features of SCN8A encephalopathy include seizure onset between 0 and 18 months of age, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. Seizures are often refractory to treatment with standard antiepileptic drugs, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been reported in approximately 10% of patients. In a recent study, high doses of phenytoin were effective in four patients with SCN8A encephalopathy. In view of this observation, we have investigated the relationship between the functional effect of the SCN8A mutation p.Ile1327Val and its response to phenytoin. The mutation was introduced into the Scn8a cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Channel activity was characterized in transfected ND7/23 cells. The effects of phenytoin (100 Î¼m) on mutant and wild-type (WT) channels were compared. Channel activation parameters were shifted in a hyperpolarizing direction in the mutant channel, whereas inactivation parameters were shifted in a depolarizing direction, increasing Na channel window current. Macroscopic current decay was slowed in I1327V channels, indicating an impairment in the transition from open state to inactivated state. Channel deactivation was also delayed, allowing more channels to remain in the open state. Phenytoin (100 Î¼m) resulted in hyperpolarized activation and inactivation curves as well as greater tonic block and use-dependent block of I1327V mutant channels relative to WT.

Individuals with SCN8A encephalopathy have a mean age of seizure onset of 4-5Â months, with multiple seizure types that are often refractory to treatment with available drugs. Anecdotal reports suggest that high-dose phenytoin is effective for some patients, but there are associated adverse effects and potential for toxicity. Functional characterization of several SCN8A encephalopathy variants has shown that elevated persistent sodium current is one of several common biophysical defects. Therefore, specifically targeting elevated persistent current may be a useful therapeutic strategy in some cases. The novel sodium channel modulator GS967 has greater preference for persistent as opposed to peak current and nearly 10-fold greater potency than phenytoin. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of GS967 in the Scn8a N1768D/+ mouse model carrying an SCN8A patient mutation that results in elevated persistent sodium current. We also performed patch clamp recordings to assess the effect of GS967 on peak and persistent sodium current and excitability in hippocampal neurons from Scn8a N1768D/+ mice. GS967 potently blocked persistent sodium current without affecting peak current, normalized action potential morphology, and attenuated excitability in neurons from heterozygous Scn8a N1768D/+ mice. Acute treatment with GS967 provided dose-dependent protection against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in Scn8a N1768D/+ and wild-type mice. Chronic treatment of Scn8a N1768D/+ mice with GS967 resulted in lower seizure burden and complete protection from seizure-associated lethality observed in untreated Scn8a N1768D/+ mice. Protection was achieved at a chronic dose that did not cause overt behavioral toxicity or sedation. Persistent sodium current modulators like GS967 may be an effective precision targeting strategy for SCN8A\n\nSCN8A encephalopathy: Research progress and prospects\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMeisler, Miriam H.; Helman, Guy; Hammer, Michael F.; Fureman, Brandy E.; Gaillard, William D.; Goldin, Alan L.; Hirose, Shinichi; Ishii, Atsushi; Kroner, Barbara L.; Lossin, Christoph; Mefford, Heather C.; Parent, Jack M.; Patel, Manoj; Schreiber, John; Stewart, Randall; Whittemore, Vicky; Wilcox, Karen; Wagnon, Jacy L; Pearl, Phillip L.; Vanderver, Adeline; Scheffer, Ingrid E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOn April 21, 2015, the first SCN8A Encephalopathy Research Group convened in Washington, DC, to assess current research into clinical and pathogenic features of the disorder and prepare an agenda for future research collaborations. The group comprised clinical and basic scientists and representatives of patient advocacy groups. SCN8A encephalopathy is a rare disorder caused by de novo missense mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN8A, which encodes the neuronal sodium channel Nav1.6. Since the initial description in 2012, approximately 140 affected individuals have been reported in publications or by SCN8A family groups. As a result, an understanding of the severe impact of SCN8A mutations is beginning to emerge. Defining a genetic epilepsy syndrome goes beyond identification of molecular etiology. Topics discussed at this meeting included (1) comparison between mutations of SCN8A and the SCN1A mutations in Dravet syndrome, (2) biophysical properties of the Nav1.6 channel, (3) electrophysiologic effects of patient mutations on channel properties, (4) cell and animal models of SCN8A encephalopathy, (5) drug screening strategies, (6) the phenotypic spectrum of SCN8A encephalopathy, and (7) efforts to develop a bioregistry. A panel discussion of gaps in bioregistry, biobanking, and clinical outcomes data was followed by a planning session for improved integration of clinical and basic science research. Although SCN8A encephalopathy was identified only recently, there has been rapid progress in functional analysis and phenotypic classification. The focus is now shifting from identification of the underlying molecular cause to the development of strategies for drug screening and prioritized patient care.

Since, in the mouse brain, the only detectable cells that label with Hoxb8 cell lineage appear to be microglia, we suggested that defective microglia cause the neuropsychiatric disorder. Does the Hoxb8 mutation in microglia lead to neural circuit dysfunctions? We demonstrate that Hoxb8 mutants contain corticostriatal circuit defects. Golgi staining, ultra-structural, and electrophysiological studies of mutants reveal excess dendritic spines, pre- and post-synaptic structural defects, long-term potentiation and miniature postsynaptic current defects. Hoxb8 mutants also exhibit hyperanxiety and social behavioral deficits similar to mice with neuronal mutations in Sapap3, Slitrk5 and Shank3, reported models of OCD and autism spectrum disorders (ASDâs). Long-term treatment of Hoxb8 mutants with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reduces excessive grooming, hyperanxiety and social behavioral impairments. These studies provide linkage between the neuronal defects induced by defective Hoxb8-microglia, and neuronal dysfunctions directly generated by mutations in synaptic components that result in mice that display similar pathological grooming, hyperanxiety and social impairment deficits. Our results shed light on Hoxb8 microglia driven circuit-specific defects and therapeutic approaches that will become essential to developing novel therapies for neuropsychiatric diseases such as OCD and ASDâs with Hoxb8-microglia being the central target.

To investigate this preferential expression of Na(v)1.6 at adult nodes, we examined isoform-specific expression of sodium channels in mice heterozygous for a null mutation in Scn8a. Immunoblots from these +/- mice had 50% of the wild-type level of Na(v)1.6 protein, and their optic-nerve nodes of Ranvier had correspondingly less anti-Na(v)1.6 immunofluorescence. Protein level and nodal immunofluorescence of the Na(v)1.2 alpha subunit increased in Scn8a(+/-) mice, keeping total sodium channel expression approximately constant despite partial loss of Na(v)1.6 channels. The results are consistent with a model in which Na(v)1.6 and Na(v)1.2 compete for binding partners at sites of high channel density, such as nodes of Ranvier. We suggest that Na(v)1.6 channels normally occupy most of the molecular machinery responsible for channel clustering because they have higher binding affinity, and not because they are exclusively recognized by mechanisms for transport and insertion of sodium channels in myelinated axons. The reduced amount of Na(v)1.6 protein in Scn8a(+/-) mice is apparently insufficient to saturate the nodal binding sites, allowing Na(v)1.2 channels to compete more successfully.\n\nThe phenotypic spectrum of SCN8A encephalopathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLarsen, Jan; Carvill, Gemma L.; Gardella, Elena; Kluger, Gerhard; Schmiedel, Gudrun; Barisic, Nina; Depienne, Christel; Brilstra, Eva; Mang, Yuan; Nielsen, Jens Erik Klint; Kirkpatrick, Martin; Goudie, David; Goldman, Rebecca; JÃ¤hn, Johanna A.; Jepsen, Birgit; Gill, Deepak; DÃ¶cker, Miriam; Biskup, Saskia; McMahon, Jacinta M.; Koeleman, Bobby; Harris, Mandy; Braun, Kees; de Kovel, Carolien G.F.; Marini, Carla; Specchio, Nicola; DjÃ©miÃ©, Tania; Weckhuysen, Sarah; Tommerup, Niels; Troncoso, Monica; Troncoso, Ledia; Bevot, Andrea; Wolff, Markus; Hjalgrim, Helle; Guerrini, Renzo; MÃ¸ller, Rikke S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: SCN8A encodes the sodium channel voltage-gated Î±8-subunit (Nav1.6). SCN8A mutations have recently been associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. We aimed to delineate the phenotype associated with SCN8A mutations. Methods: We used high-throughput sequence analysis of the SCN8A gene in 683 patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathies. In addition, we ascertained cases with SCN8A mutations from other centers. A detailed clinical history was obtained together with a review of EEG and imaging data. Results: Seventeen patients with de novo heterozygous mutations of SCN8A were studied. Seizure onset occurred at a mean age of 5 months (range: 1 day to 18 months); in general, seizures were not triggered by fever. Fifteen of 17 patients had multiple seizure types including focal, tonic, clonic, myoclonic and absence seizures, and epileptic spasms; seizures were refractory to antiepileptic therapy. Development was normal in 12 patients and slowed after seizure onset, often with regression; 5 patients had delayed development from birth. All patients developed intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Motor manifestations were prominent including hypotonia, dystonia, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. EEG findings comprised moderate to severe background slowing with focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges. Conclusion: SCN8A encephalopathy presents in infancy with multiple seizure types including focal seizures and spasms in some cases. Outcome is often poor and includes hypotonia and movement disorders. The majority of mutations arise de novo, although we observed a single case of somatic mosaicism in an unaffected parent.

In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1(-/-) and Per2(-/-) mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1(-/-)/Per2(-/-) mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1(-/-)/Per2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Per1(-/-)/Per2(-/-) mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1(-/-)/Per2(-/-) SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.\n\nEarly mortality in SCN8A-related epilepsies.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohannesen, Katrine M; Gardella, Elena; Scheffer, Ingrid; Howell, Katherine; Smith, Douglas M; Helbig, Ingo; MÃ¸ller, Rikke S; Rubboli, Guido\n\n2018-07-01\n\nSCN8A-related epilepsies are often severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Seizures can be treatment resistant, and patients suffer from severe intellectual disability. Reports have suggested that SCN8A-related epilepsies have a high mortality with SUDEP as the major underlying cause. SUDEP is a catastrophic event, and the risk of occurrence should be correctly and carefully discussed with patients and families. We tested the hypothesis of SUDEP as the main cause of death in SCN8A-related epilepsies by reviewing all the currently reported patients with SCN8A. In addition, we collected unpublished patients through an international network. In total, we reviewed the data of 190 patients. In our cohort, 10 patients were deceased, and the overall mortality was 5.3%. Within the ten deceased patients, age at death ranged from 16 months to 17 years; the majority (7/10) of them died in early childhood. Three patients died of probable or definite SUDEP. Thus, our data do not indicate an increased risk when compared to other DEEs. Indeed, death in SCN8A-related epilepsies seems to occur most often in children experiencing a relentless worsening of their epilepsy and neurological condition, rendering them susceptible to pulmonary infections and respiratory distress that ultimately can be fatal.

Here we report an infant and his father with early onset focal epileptic seizures but without cognitive or neurological impairment in whom next generation sequence analysis identified a heterozygous mutation (c.5630AÂ >Â G, p. (Asn1877Ser)) in the SCN8A gene. This mutation, confirmed by Sanger sequence analysis, affects a highly conserved amino acid and in silico tools predicts that it may be pathogenic. The reported infant has a normal developmental profile at 16-month follow-up. His father also had normal development and has no cognitive impairment at 42 years. This is the second known SCN8A mutation associated with a phenotype of benign familial infantile epilepsy. Good seizure control was achieved in our patients with sodium channel blockers. Based on our proband and a recently described group of families with benign familial infantile epilepsy and SCN8A variant we suggest expanding testing to patients with infantile epilepsy and no cognitive impairment. In addition, the same SCN8A variant (c.5630AÂ >Â G, p. (Asn1877Ser)) is also found in patients with epilepsy and developmental delay highlighting the phenotypic variability and the possible role of other protective genetic factors. Copyright Â© 2016.

ZFHX3 regulates transcription via direct interaction with predicted AT motifs in target genes. The mutant protein has a decreased ability to activate consensus AT motifs inÂ vitro. Using RNA sequencing, we found minimal effects on core clock genes in Zfhx3Sci/+ SCN, whereas the expression ofÂ neuropeptides critical for SCN intercellular signaling was significantly disturbed. Moreover, mutant ZFHX3 had a decreased ability to activate AT motifs in the promoters of these neuropeptide genes. Lentiviral transduction of SCN slices showed that the ZFHX3-mediated activation of AT motifs is circadian, with decreased amplitude and robustness of these oscillations in Zfhx3Sci/+ SCN slices. In conclusion, by cloning Zfhx3Sci, we have uncovered a circadian transcriptional axis that determines the period andÂ robustness of behavioral and SCN molecular rhythms.

The neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviors in DS are poorly understood. Here we show that mice with Scn1a haploinsufficiency display hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviors, social interaction deficits, and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. Olfactory sensitivity is retained, but novel food odors and social odors are aversive to Scn1a+/â mice. GABAergic neurotransmission is specifically impaired by this mutation, and selective deletion of NaV1.1 channels in forebrain interneurons is sufficient to cause these behavioral and cognitive impairments. Remarkably, treatment with low-dose clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, completely rescued the abnormal social behaviors and deficits in fear memory in DS mice, demonstrating that they are caused by impaired GABAergic neurotransmission and not by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. These results demonstrate a critical role for NaV1.1 channels in neuropsychiatric functions and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviors in DS.

SCN8A encodes for sodium channel Nav1.6, which is located in the brain. Gain-of-function missense mutations in SCN8A are thought to lead to increased firing of excitatory neurons containing Nav1.6, and therefore to lead to increased seizure susceptibility. We hypothesized that sodium channel blockers could have a beneficial effect in patients with SCN8A-related epilepsy by blocking the overactive Nav1.6 and thereby counteracting the effect of the mutation. Herein, we describe 4 patients with a missense SCN8A mutation and epilepsy who all show a remarkably good response on high doses of phenytoin and loss of seizure control when phenytoin medication was reduced, while side effects were relatively mild. In 2 patients, repeated withdrawal of phenytoin led to the reoccurrence of seizures. Based on the findings in these patients and the underlying molecular mechanism we consider treatment with (high-dose) phenytoin as a possible treatment option in patients with difficult-to-control seizures due to an SCN8A mutation.\n\nGlobal gene profiling of aging lungs in Atp8b1 mutant mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoundararajan, Ramani; Stearns, Timothy M; Czachor, Alexander; Fukumoto, Jutaro; Turn, Christina; Westermann-Clark, Emma; Breitzig, Mason; Tan, Lee; Lockey, Richard F; King, Benjamin L; Kolliputi, Narasaiah\n\n2016-09-29\n\nRecent studies implicate cardiolipin oxidation in several age-related diseases. Atp8b1 encoding Type 4 P-type ATPases is a cardiolipin transporter. Mutation in Atp8b1 gene or inflammation of the lungs impairs the capacity of Atp8b1 to clear cardiolipin from lung fluid. However, the link between Atp8b1 mutation and age-related gene alteration is unknown. Therefore, we investigated how Atp8b1 mutation alters age-related genes. We performed Affymetrix gene profiling of lungs isolated from young (7-9 wks, n=6) and aged (14 months, 14 M, n=6) C57BL/6 and Atp8b1 mutant mice. In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed. Differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Global transcriptome analysis revealed 532 differentially expressed genes in Atp8b1 lungs, 157 differentially expressed genes in C57BL/6 lungs, and 37 overlapping genes. IPA of age-related genes in Atp8b1 lungs showed enrichment of Xenobiotic metabolism and Nrf2-mediated signaling pathways. The increase in Adamts2 and Mmp13 transcripts in aged Atp8b1 lungs was validated by qRT-PCR. Similarly, the decrease in Col1a1 and increase in Cxcr6 transcripts was confirmed in both Atp8b1 mutant and C57BL/6 lungs. Based on transcriptome profiling, our study indicates that Atp8b1 mutant mice may be susceptible to age-related lung diseases.\n\nAutistic-like behaviour in Scn1a+/- mice and rescue by enhanced GABA-mediated neurotransmission.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Sung; Tai, Chao; Westenbroek, Ruth E; Yu, Frank H; Cheah, Christine S; Potter, Gregory B; Rubenstein, John L; Scheuer, Todd; de la Iglesia, Horacio O; Catterall, William A\n\n2012-09-20\n\nHaploinsufficiency of the SCN1A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.1 causes Dravet's syndrome, a childhood neuropsychiatric disorder including recurrent intractable seizures, cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours. The neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome are poorly understood. Here we report that mice with Scn1a haploinsufficiency exhibit hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviours, social interaction deficits and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. Olfactory sensitivity is retained, but novel food odours and social odours are aversive to Scn1a(+/-) mice. GABAergic neurotransmission is specifically impaired by this mutation, and selective deletion of Na(V)1.1 channels in forebrain interneurons is sufficient to cause these behavioural and cognitive impairments. Remarkably, treatment with low-dose clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, completely rescued the abnormal social behaviours and deficits in fear memory in the mouse model of Dravet's syndrome, demonstrating that they are caused by impaired GABAergic neurotransmission and not by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. These results demonstrate a critical role for Na(V)1.1 channels in neuropsychiatric functions and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome.\n\nGAPDH-mediated posttranscriptional regulations of sodium channel Scn1a and Scn3a genes under seizure and ketogenic diet conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Guo-Wang; Lu, Ping; Zeng, Tao; Tang, Hui-Ling; Chen, Yong-Hong; Liu, Shu-Jing; Gao, Mei-Mei; Zhao, Qi-Hua; Yi, Yong-Hong; Long, Yue-Sheng\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAbnormal expressions of sodium channel SCN1A and SCN3A genes alter neural excitability that are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy, a long-term risk of recurrent seizures. Ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat and low-carbohydrate treatment for difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children, has been suggested to reverse gene expression patterns. Here, we reveal a novel role of GAPDH on the posttranscriptional regulation of mouse Scn1a and Scn3a expressions under seizure and KD conditions. We show that GAPDH binds to a conserved region in the 3' UTRs of human and mouse SCN1A and SCN3A genes, which decreases and increases genes' expressions by affecting mRNA stability through SCN1A 3' UTR and SCN3A 3' UTR, respectively. In seizure mice, the upregulation and phosphorylation of GAPDH enhance its binding to the 3' UTR, which lead to downregulation of Scn1a and upregulation of Scn3a. Furthermore, administration of KD generates Î²-hydroxybutyric acid which rescues the abnormal expressions of Scn1a and Scn3a by weakening the GAPDH's binding to the element. Taken together, these data suggest that GAPDH-mediated expression regulation of sodium channel genes may be associated with epilepsy and the anticonvulsant action of KD.

Mutations in SCN5A are associated with conduction disease and ventricular fibrillation (VF); however, the mechanisms that link loss of sodium channel function to arrhythmic instability remain unresolved. Here, we generated a large-animal model of a human cardiac sodium channelopathy in pigs, which have cardiac structure and function similar to humans, to better define the arrhythmic substrate. We introduced a nonsense mutation originally identified in a child with Brugada syndrome into the orthologous position (E558X) in the pig SCN5A gene. SCN5AE558X/+ pigs exhibited conduction abnormalities in the absence of cardiac structural defects. Sudden cardiac death was not observed in young pigs; however, Langendorff-perfused SCN5AE558X/+ hearts had an increased propensity for pacing-induced or spontaneous VF initiated by short-coupled ventricular premature beats. Optical mapping during VF showed that activity often began as an organized focal source or broad wavefront on the right ventricular (RV) free wall. Together, the results from this study demonstrate that the SCN5AE558X/+ pig model accurately phenocopies many aspects of human cardiac sodium channelopathy, including conduction slowing and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias.

Neurons in the primary circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), exhibit daily rhythms in spontaneous neuronal activity which are important for maintaining circadian behavioral rhythms. Disruption of SCN neuronal activity has been reported in animal models of other neurodegenerative disorders; however, the effect of AD on SCN neurophysiology remains unknown. In this study we examined circadian behavioral and electrophysiological changes in a mouse model of AD, using male mice from the Tg-SwDI line which expresses human amyloid precursor protein with the familial Swedish (K670N/M671L), Dutch (E693Q), Iowa (D694N) mutations. The free-running period of wheel-running behavior was significantly shorter in Tg-SwDI mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls at all ages examined (3, 6, and 10â¯months). At the SCN level, the day/night difference in spike rate was significantly dampened in 6-8â¯month-old Tg-SwDI mice, with decreased AP firing during the day and an increase in neuronal activity at night. The dampening of SCN excitability rhythms in Tg-SwDI mice was not associated with changes in input resistance, resting membrane potential, or action potential afterhyperpolarization amplitude; however, SCN neurons from Tg-SwDI mice had significantly reduced A-type potassium current (I A ) during the day compared to WT cells. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence of SCN neurophysiological disruption in a mouse model of AD, and highlight I A as a potential target for AD treatment strategies in the future.

David\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCocaine abuse disrupts reward and homeostatic processes through diverse processes, including those involved in circadian clock regulation. Recently we showed that cocaine administration to mice disrupts nocturnal photic phase resetting of the suprachiasmatic (SCN) circadian clock, whereas administration during the day induces non-photic phase shifts. Importantly, the same effects are seen when cocaine is applied to the SCN in vitro, where it blocks photic-like (glutamate-induced) phase shifts at night and induces phase advances during the day. Furthermore, our previous data suggest that cocaine acts in the SCN by enhancing serotonin (5-HT) signaling. For example, the in vitro actions of cocaine mimic those of 5-HT and are blocked by the 5-HT antagonist, metergoline, but not the dopamine receptor antagonist, fluphenazine. Although our data are consistent with cocaine acting through enhance 5-HT signaling, the nonselective actions of cocaine as an antagonist of monoamine transporters raises the question of whether inhibition of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) is key to its circadian effects. Here we investigate this issue using transgenic mice expressing a SERT that exhibits normal 5-HT recognition and transport but significantly reduced cocaine potency (SERT Met172). Circadian patterns of SCN behavioral and neuronal activity did not differ between WT and SERT Met172 mice, nor did they differ in the ability of the 5-HT1A,2,7 receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT to reset SCN clock phase, consistent with the normal SERT expression and activity in the transgenic mice. However, 1) cocaine administration does not induce phase advances when administered in vivo or in vitro in SERT Met172 mice; 2) cocaine does not block photic or glutamate-induced (phase shifts in SERT Met172 mice; and 3) cocaine does not induce long-term changes in free-running period in SERT Met172 mice. We conclude that SERT antagonism is required for the phase shifting of the SCN circadian clock induced by cocaine\n\nScheduled Feeding Alters the Timing of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Circadian Clock in Dexras 1-Deficient Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBouchard-Cannon, Pascale; Cheng, Hai-Ying M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRestricted feeding (RF) schedules are potent zeitgebers capable of entraining metabolic and hormonal rhythms in peripheral oscillators in anticipation of food. Behaviorally, this manifests in the form of food anticipatory activity (FAA) in the hours preceding food availability. Circadian rhythms of FAA are thought to be controlled by a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker in mammals. Although evidence suggests that the FEO and the SCN are capable of interacting functionally under RF conditions, the genetic basis of these interactions remains to be defined. In this study, using dexras1-deficient (dexras1â/â) mice, the authors examined whether Dexras1, a modulator of multiple inputs to the SCN, plays a role in regulating the effects of RF on activity rhythms and gene expression in the SCN. Daytime RF under 12L:12D or constant darkness (DD) resulted in potentiated (but less stable) FAA expression in dexras1â/â mice compared with wild-type (WT) controls. Under these conditions, the magnitude and phase of the SCN-driven activity component were greatly perturbed in the mutants. Restoration to ad libitum (AL) feeding revealed a stable phase displacement of the SCN-driven activity component of dexras1â/â mice by ~2 h in advance of the expected time. RF in the late night/early morning induced a long-lasting increase in the period of the SCN-driven activity component in the mutants but not the WT. At the molecular level, daytime RF advanced the rhythm of PER1, PER2, and pERK expression in the mutant SCN without having any effect in the WT. Collectively, these results indicate that the absence of Dexras1 sensitizes the SCN to perturbations resulting from restricted feeding.

In addition to modulating sodium and potassium currents, Î² subunits play nonconducting roles as cell adhesion molecules, which allow them to function in cellâcell communication, neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, neuronal pathfinding, and axonal fasciculation. Mutations in SCN1B, encoding VGSC Î²1 and Î²1B, are associated with epilepsy. Autosomal-dominant SCN1B-C121W, the first epilepsy-associated VGSC mutation identified, results in genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). This mutation has been shown to disrupt both the sodium-current-modulatory and cell-adhesive functions of Î²1 subunits expressed in heterologous systems. The goal of this study was to compare mice heterozygous for Scn1b-C121W (Scn1b+/W) with mice heterozygous for the Scn1b-null allele (Scn1b+/â) to determine whether the C121W mutation results in loss-of-function in vivo. We found that Scn1b+/W mice were more susceptible than Scn1b+/â and Scn1b+/+ mice to hyperthermia-induced convulsions, a model of pediatric febrile seizures. Î²1-C121W subunits are expressed at the neuronal cell surface in vivo. However, despite this, Î²1-C121W polypeptides are incompletely glycosylated and do not associate with VGSC Î± subunits in the brain. Î²1-C121W subcellular localization is restricted to neuronal cell bodies and is not detected at axon initial segments in the cortex or cerebellum or at optic nerve nodes of Ranvier of Scn1bW/W mice. These data, together with our previous results showing that Î²1-C121W cannot participate in trans-homophilic cell adhesion, lead to the hypothesis that SCN1B-C121W confers a deleterious gain-of-function in human GEFS+ patients. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mechanisms underlying genetic epilepsy syndromes are poorly understood. Closing this gap in knowledge is essential to the development of new medicines to treat epilepsy.

In 21 affected members, we uncovered a potential mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641Y, in the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II that was absent from 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, we introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type mice, homozygous Scn9a(N641Y/N641Y) knockin mice exhibit significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. Together, these data strongly support the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation as disease-causing in this family. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, we analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and identified additional highly conserved Na(v)1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. After one of these children with FS later developed Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), we sequenced the SCN1A gene, a gene known to be associated with Dravet syndrome, and identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Na(v)1.7 missense variants (8% of the patients), all in highly conserved amino acids. Six of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN9A missense variants also harbored either missense or splice site SCN1A mutations and three had no SCN1A mutations. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations.\n\nSCN2A encephalopathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHowell, Katherine B.; McMahon, Jacinta M.; Carvill, Gemma L.; Tambunan, Dimira; Mackay, Mark T.; Rodriguez-Casero, Victoria; Webster, Richard; Clark, Damian; Freeman, Jeremy L.; Calvert, Sophie; Olson, Heather E.; Mandelstam, Simone; Poduri, Annapurna; Mefford, Heather C.; Harvey, A. Simon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: De novo SCN2A mutations have recently been associated with severe infantile-onset epilepsies. Herein, we define the phenotypic spectrum of SCN2A encephalopathy. Methods: Twelve patients with an SCN2A epileptic encephalopathy underwent electroclinical phenotyping. Results: Patients were aged 0.7 to 22 years; 3 were deceased. Seizures commenced on day 1â4 in 8, week 2â6 in 2, and after 1 year in 2. Characteristic features included clusters of brief focal seizures with multiple hourly (9 patients), multiple daily (2), or multiple weekly (1) seizures, peaking at maximal frequency within 3 months of onset. Multifocal interictal epileptiform discharges were seen in all. Three of 12 patients had infantile spasms. The epileptic syndrome at presentation was epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) in 7 and Ohtahara syndrome in 2. Nine patients had improved seizure control with sodium channel blockers including supratherapeutic or high therapeutic phenytoin levels in 5. Eight had severe to profound developmental impairment. Other features included movement disorders (10), axial hypotonia (11) with intermittent or persistent appendicular spasticity, early handedness, and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Mutations arose de novo in 11 patients; paternal DNA was unavailable in one. Conclusions: Review of our 12 and 34 other reported cases of SCN2A encephalopathy suggests 3 phenotypes: neonatal-infantileâonset groups with severe and intermediate outcomes, and a childhood-onset group. Here, we show that SCN2A is the second most common cause of EIMFS and, importantly, does not always have a poor developmental outcome. Sodium channel blockers, particularly phenytoin, may improve seizure control.

Bmal1 encodes a core molecular clock transcription factor. Germline Bmal1 knockout mice show a loss of circadian variation in heart rate and blood pressure, and they develop dilated cardiomyopathy. We tested the role of the molecular clock in adult cardiomyocytes by generating mice that allow for the inducible cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 (iCSÎBmal1). ECG telemetry showed that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1 (iCSÎBmal1â/â) in adult mice slowed heart rate, prolonged RR and QRS intervals, and increased episodes of arrhythmia. Moreover, isolated iCSÎBmal1â/â hearts were more susceptible to arrhythmia during electromechanical stimulation. Examination of candidate cardiac ion channel genes showed that Scn5a, which encodes the principle cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channel (NaV1.5), was circadianly expressed in control mouse and rat hearts but not in iCSÎBmal1â/â hearts. In vitro studies confirmed circadian expression of a human Scn5a promoter-luciferase reporter construct and determined that overexpression of clock factors transactivated the Scn5a promoter. Loss of Scn5a circadian expression in iCSÎBmal1â/â hearts was associated with decreased levels of NaV1.5 and Na+ current in ventricular myocytes. We conclude that disruption of the molecular clock in the adult heart slows heart rate, increases arrhythmias, and decreases the functional expression of Scn5a. These findings suggest a potential link between environmental factors that alter the cardiomyocyte molecular clock and factors that influence arrhythmia susceptibility in humans.

While SCN5A is the canonical cardiac sodium channel gene, the role of SCN10A in cardiac conduction is less well characterized. We sequenced the SCN10A locus in 3699 European-ancestry individuals to identify variants associated with cardiac conduction, and replicated our findings in 21,000 individuals of European ancestry. We examined association with expression in human atrial tissue. We explored the biophysical effect of variation on channel function using cellular electrophysiology. We identified 2 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms in high linkage disequilibrium ( r â 2 =0.86) with each other to be the strongest signals for PR (rs10428132, Î²=-4.74, P =1.52Ã10 -14 ) and QRS intervals (rs6599251, QRS Î²=-0.73; P =1.2Ã10 -4 ), respectively. Although these variants were not associated with SCN5A or SCN10A expression in human atrial tissue (n=490), they were in high linkage disequilibrium ( r â 2 â¥0.72) with a common SCN10A missense variant, rs6795970 (V1073A). In total, we identified 7 missense variants, 4 of which (I962V, P1045T, V1073A, and L1092P) were associated with cardiac conduction. These 4 missense variants cluster in the cytoplasmic linker of the second and third domains of the SCN10A protein and together form 6 common haplotypes. Using cellular electrophysiology, we found that haplotypes associated with shorter PR intervals had a significantly larger percentage of late current compared with wild-type (I962V+V1073A+L1092P, 20.2Â±3.3%, P =0.03, and I962V+V1073A, 22.4Â±0.8%, P =0.0004 versus wild-type 11.7Â±1.6%), and the haplotype associated with the longest PR interval had a significantly smaller late current percentage (P1045T, 6.4Â±1.2%, P =0.03). Our findings suggest an association between genetic variation in SCN10A , the late sodium current, and alterations in cardiac conduction.

The âafter-hoursâ (Afh) mutation in mouse slows the degradation of the core clock protein Cryptochrome, lengthening the period of the molecular clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and behavioural wheel-running rhythms. However, we do not yet know how the Afh mutation affects other aspects of physiology or the activity of circadian oscillators in other brain regions. Here we report that daily rhythms of metabolism and ingestive behaviours are altered in these animals, as are PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) rhythms in mediobasal hypothalamic nuclei, which influence these behaviours. Overall there is a trend towards period lengthening and a decrease in amplitude of PER2::LUC rhythms throughout the brain. Imaging of single cells from the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei revealed this reduction in tissue oscillator amplitude to be due to a decrease in the amplitude, rather than a desynchrony, of single cells. Consistent with existing models of oscillator function, this cellular phenotype was associated with a greater susceptibility to phase-shifting stimuli in vivo and in vitro, with light evoking high-amplitude Type 0 resetting in Afh mutant mice. Together, these findings reveal unexpected consequences of the Afh mutation on the amplitude and synchrony of individual cellular oscillators in the SCN.

PACAP as a neurotransmitter in the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) and VIP as a neurotransmitter, involved in synchronization of SCN neurons. Behavior and physiology in VPAC2 deficient mice are strongly regulated by light most likely as a result of masking. Consequently, we used VPAC2 and PAC1/VPAC2 double mutant mice in comparison with PAC1 receptor deficient mice to further elucidate the role of PACAP in the light mediated regulation of behavior and physiology of the circadian system. We compared circadian rhythms in mice equipped with running wheels or implanted radio-transmitter measuring core body temperature kept in a full photoperiod ((FPP)(12:12 h light dark-cycles (LD)) and skeleton photo periods (SPP) at high and low light intensity. Furthermore, we examined the expression of PAC1- and VPAC2 receptors in the SCN of the different genotypes in combination with visualization of PACAP and VIP and determined whether compensatory changes in peptide and/or receptor expression in the reciprocal knockouts (KO) (PAC1 and VPAC2) had occurred. Our data demonstrate that in although being closely related at both ligand and receptor structure/sequence, PACAP/PAC1 receptor signaling are independent of VIP/VPAC2 receptor signaling and vice versa. Furthermore, lack of either of the receptors does not result in compensatory changes at neither the physiological or anatomical level. PACAP/PAC1 signaling is important for light regulated behavior, VIP/VPAC2signaling for stable clock function and both signaling pathways may play a role in shaping diurnality versus nocturnality.

PACAP/PAC1 signaling is important for light regulated behavior, VIP/VPAC2signaling for stable clock function and both signaling pathways may play a role in shaping diurnality versus nocturnality.\n\nDifferential roles of AVP and VIP signaling in the postnatal changes of neural networks for coherent circadian rhythms in the SCN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOno, Daisuke; Honma, Sato; Honma, Ken-ichi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the master circadian clock in mammals. The SCN neural network plays a critical role in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm. Previously, we demonstrated postnatal changes in the SCN network in mice, in which the clock gene products CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) are involved. Here, we show that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) signaling is essential for the tissue-level circadian PER2::LUC rhythm in the neonatal SCN of CRY double-deficient mice (Cry1,2â/â). VIP and arginine vasopressin (AVP) signaling showed redundancy in expressing the tissue-level circadian rhythm in the SCN. AVP synthesis was significantly attenuated in the Cry1,2â/â SCN, which contributes to aperiodicity in the adult mice together with an attenuation of VIP signaling as a natural process of ontogeny. The SCN network consists of multiple clusters of cellular circadian rhythms that are differentially integrated by AVP and VIP signaling, depending on the postnatal period.

M.; Tucci, Valter; Wackerhage, Henning; Amato, Anthony A.; Greensmith, Linda; Koltzenburg, Martin; Hanna, Michael G.; Acevedo-Arozena, Abraham\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMutations in the skeletal muscle channel (SCN4A), encoding the Nav1.4 voltage-gated sodium channel, are causative of a variety of muscle channelopathies, including non-dystrophic myotonias and periodic paralysis. The effects of many of these mutations on channel function have been characterized both in vitro and in vivo. However, little is known about the consequences of SCN4A mutations downstream from their impact on the electrophysiology of the Nav1.4 channel. Here we report the discovery of a novel SCN4A mutation (c.1762A>G; p.I588V) in a patient with myotonia and periodic paralysis, located within the S1 segment of the second domain of the Nav1.4 channel. Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we generated and characterized a mouse model (named draggen), carrying the equivalent point mutation (c.1744A>G; p.I582V) to that found in the patient with periodic paralysis and myotonia. Draggen mice have myotonia and suffer from intermittent hind-limb immobility attacks. In-depth characterization of draggen mice uncovered novel systemic metabolic abnormalities in Scn4a mouse models and provided novel insights into disease mechanisms. We discovered metabolic alterations leading to lean mice, as well as abnormal AMP-activated protein kinase activation, which were associated with the immobility attacks and may provide a novel potential therapeutic target.

Identifying which patients are most at risk of SUDEP is hindered by a complex genetic etiology, incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and lack of prognostic biomarkers. Here we evaluated heterozygous Scn2a gene deletion (Scn2a+/-) as a protective genetic modifier in the Kcna1 knockout mouse (Kcna1-/-) model of SUDEP, while searching for biomarkers of SUDEP risk embedded in electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. The human epilepsy gene Kcna1 encodes voltage-gated Kv1.1 potassium channels that act to dampen neuronal excitability whereas Scn2a encodes voltage-gated Nav1.2 sodium channels important for action potential initiation and conduction. SUDEP-prone Kcna1-/- mice with partial genetic ablation of Nav1.2 channels (i.e. Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/-) exhibited a two-fold increase in survival. Classical analysis of EEG and ECG recordings separately showed significantly decreased seizure durations in Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/- mice compared with Kcna1-/- mice, without substantial modification of cardiac abnormalities. Novel analysis of the EEG and ECG together revealed a significant reduction in EEG-ECG association in Kcna1-/- mice compared with wild types, which was partially restored in Scn2a+/-; Kcna1-/- mice. The degree of EEG-ECG association was also proportional to the survival rate of mice across genotypes. These results show that Scn2a gene deletion acts as protective genetic modifier of SUDEP and suggest measures of brain-heart association as potential indices of SUDEP susceptibility.

It is so far not clear how mutant HSPB8 induces the neuronal and muscular phenotypes and if a common pathogenesis lies behind these diseases. Growing evidence points towards a role of HSPB8 in chaperone-associated autophagy, which has been shown to be a determinant for the clearance of poly-glutamine aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases but also for the maintenance of skeletal muscle myofibrils. To test this hypothesis and better dissect the pathomechanism of mutant HSPB8, we generated a new transgenic mouse model leading to the expression of the mutant protein (knock-in lines) or the loss-of-function (functional knock-out lines) of the endogenous protein Hspb8. While the homozygous knock-in mice developed motor deficits associated with degeneration of peripheral nerves and severe muscle atrophy corroborating patient data, homozygous knock-out mice had locomotor performances equivalent to those of wild-type animals. The distal skeletal muscles of the post-symptomatic homozygous knock-in displayed Z-disk disorganisation, granulofilamentous material accumulation along with Hspb8, Î±B-crystallin (HSPB5/CRYAB), and desmin aggregates. The presence of the aggregates correlated with reduced markers of effective autophagy. The sciatic nerve of the homozygous knock-in mice was characterized by low autophagy potential in pre-symptomatic and Hspb8 aggregates in post-symptomatic animals. On the other hand, the sciatic nerve of the homozygous knock-out mice presented a normal morphology and their distal muscle displayed accumulation of abnormal mitochondria but intact myofiber and Z-line organisation. Our data, therefore, suggest that toxic gain-of-function of mutant Hspb8 aggregates is a major contributor to the peripheral neuropathy and the myopathy. In addition, mutant Hspb8 induces\n\nMultidrug resistance in epilepsy and polymorphisms in the voltage-gated sodium channel genes SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A: correlation among phenotype, genotype, and mRNA expression.\n\nPubMed\n\nKwan, Patrick; Poon, Wai Sang; Ng, Ho-Keung; Kang, David E; Wong, Virginia; Ng, Ping Wing; Lui, Colin H T; Sin, Ngai Chuen; Wong, Ka S; Baum, Larry\n\n2008-11-01\n\nMany antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prevent seizures by blocking voltage-gated brain sodium channels. However, treatment is ineffective in 30% of epilepsy patients, which might, at least in part, result from polymorphisms of the sodium channel genes. We investigated the association of AED responsiveness with genetic polymorphisms and correlated any association with mRNA expression of the neuronal sodium channels. We performed genotyping of tagging and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SCN1A, 2A, and 3A in 471 Chinese epilepsy patients (272 drug responsive and 199 drug resistant). A total of 27 SNPs were selected based on the HapMap database. Genotype distributions in drug-responsive and drug-resistant patients were compared. SCN2A mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in 24 brain and 57 blood samples. Its level was compared between patients with different genotypes of an SCN2A SNP found to be associated with drug responsiveness. SCN2A IVS7-32A>G (rs2304016) A alleles were associated with drug resistance (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-3.7, P=0.007). Haplotypes containing the IVS7-32A>G allele A were also associated with drug resistance. IVS7-32A>G is located within the putative splicing branch site for splicing exons 7 and 9. PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA from blood or brain of patients with different IVS7-32A>G genotypes using primers in exons 7 and 9 showed no skipping of exon 8, and real-time PCR showed no difference in SCN2A mRNA levels among genotypes. Results of this study suggest an association between SCN2A IVS7-32A>G and AED responsiveness, without evidence of an effect on splicing or mRNA expression.\n\nA SCN10A SNP biases human pain sensitivity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDuan, Guangyou; Han, Chongyang; Wang, Qingli; Guo, Shanna; Zhang, Yuhao; Ying, Ying; Huang, Penghao; Zhang, Li; Macala, Lawrence; Shah, Palak; Zhang, Mi; Li, Ningbo; Dib-Hajj, Sulayman D; Zhang, Xianwei\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: Nav1.8 sodium channels, encoded by SCN10A, are preferentially expressed in nociceptive neurons and play an important role in human pain. Although rare gain-of-function variants in SCN10A have been identified in individuals with painful peripheral neuropathies, whether more common variants in SCN10A can have an effect at the channel level and at the dorsal root ganglion, neuronal level leading to a pain disorder or an altered normal pain threshold has not been determined. Results: Candidate single nucleotide polymorphism association approach together with experimental pain testing in human subjects was used to explore possible common SCN10A missense variants that might affect human pain sensitivity. We demonstrated an association between rs6795970 (Gâ>âA; p.Ala1073Val) and higher thresholds for mechanical pain in a discovery cohort (496 subjects) and confirmed it in a larger replication cohort (1005 female subjects). Functional assessments showed that although the minor allele shifts channel activation by â4.3âmV, a proexcitatory attribute, it accelerates inactivation, an antiexcitatory attribute, with the net effect being reduced repetitive firing of dorsal root ganglion neurons, consistent with lower mechanical pain sensitivity. Conclusions: At the association and mechanistic levels, the SCN10A single nucleotide polymorphism rs6795970 biases human pain sensitivity.

By studying a PWS mouse mutant line, which carries a paternally inherited deletion of the small nucleolar RNAÂ 116 (Snord116), we observed significant changes in working-for-food behavioral responses at various timescales. In particular, we report that PWS mutant mice show a significant delay compared to wild-type littermate controls in responding to both hour-scale and seconds-to-minutes-scale time intervals. This timing shift in mutant mice is associated with better performance in the working-for-food task, and results in better decision making in these mutant mice. The results of our study reveal a novel aspect of the organization of feeding behavior, and advance the understanding of the interplay between the metabolic functions and cognitive mechanisms of PWS.

Here we show that mice expressing a mutant form of SHPS-1 fail to develop type-II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA), a model for rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Histological examinations of the arthritic paws from immunized wild-type mice revealed that cartilage was destroyed in association with marked mononuclear cell infiltration, while only mild cell infiltration was observed in immunized SHPS-1 mutant mice. Consistently, the serum levels of both IgG and IgG2a specific to CII andmoreÂ Â» of IL-1{beta} in immunized SHPS-1 mutant mice were markedly reduced compared with those apparent for wild-type mice. The CII-induced proliferation of, and production of cytokines by, T cells from immunized SHPS-1 mutant mice were reduced compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that SHPS-1 is essential for development of CIA.Â«Â less\n\nCoexistence of CLCN1 and SCN4A mutations in one family suffering from myotonia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaggi, Lorenzo; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Farinato, Alessandro; Brugnoni, Raffaella; Altamura, Concetta; Imbrici, Paola; Camerino, Diana Conte; Padovani, Alessandro; Mantegazza, Renato; Bernasconi, Pia; Desaphy, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Filosto, Massimiliano\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNon-dystrophic myotonias are characterized by clinical overlap making it challenging to establish genotype-phenotype correlations.

Functional characterization of N1297S hNav1.4 mutant was performed by patch clamp. The patients displayed a mild phenotype, mostly resembling a sodium channel myotonia. The CLCN1 c.501C>G (p.F167L) mutation has been already described in recessive pedigrees, whereas the SCN4A c.3890A>G (p.N1297S) variation is novel. Patch clamp experiments showed impairment of fast and slow inactivation of the mutated Nav1.4 sodium channel. The present findings suggest that analysis of both SCN4A and CLCN1 genes should be considered in myotonic patients with atypical clinical and neurophysiological features.\n\nCongenital Insensitivity to Pain: Novel SCN9A Missense and In-Frame Deletion Mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCox, James J; Sheynin, Jony; Shorer, Zamir; Reimann, Frank; Nicholas, Adeline K; Zubovic, Lorena; Baralle, Marco; Wraige, Elizabeth; Manor, Esther; Levy, Jacov; Woods, C Geoffery; Parvari, Ruti\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSCN9A encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, a protein highly expressed in pain-sensing neurons. Mutations in SCN9A cause three human pain disorders: bi-allelic loss of function mutations result in Channelopathy-associated Insensitivity to Pain (CIP), whereas activating mutations cause severe episodic pain in Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder (PEPD) and Primary Erythermalgia (PE). To date, all mutations in SCN9A that cause a complete inability to experience pain are protein truncating and presumably lead to no protein being produced. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of two novel non-truncating mutations in families with CIP: a homozygously-inherited missense mutation found in a consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family (Nav1.7-R896Q) and a five amino acid in-frame deletion found in a sporadic compound heterozygote (Nav1.7-ÎR1370-L1374). Both of these mutations map to the pore region of the Nav1.7 sodium channel. Using transient transfection of PC12 cells we found a significant reduction in membrane localization of the mutant protein compared to the wild type.

Recently, we discovered that adenylyl cyclase and MAPK activities undergo a circadian oscillation in the hippocampus and that inhibition of this oscillation impairs contextual memory. This suggests the interesting possibility that the persistence of hippocampus-dependent memory depends upon the reactivation of MAPK in the hippocampus during the circadian cycle. A key unanswered question is whether the circadian oscillation of this signaling pathway is intrinsic to the hippocampus or is driven by the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). To address this question, we ablated the SCN of mice by electrolytic lesion and examined hippocampus-dependent memory as well as adenylyl cyclase and MAPK activities. Electrolytic lesion of the SCN two days after training for contextual fear memory reduced contextual memory measured two weeks after training indicating that maintenance of contextual memory depends on the SCN. Spatial memory was also compromised in SCN-lesioned mice. Furthermore, the diurnal oscillation of adenylyl cyclase and MAPK activities in the hippocampus was destroyed by lesioning of the SCN. These data suggest that hippocampus-dependent long-term memory is dependent on the SCN-controlled oscillation of the adenylyl cyclase/MAPK pathway in the hippocampus.

In the SCN, CLOCK works as an essential component of molecular circadian oscillation, and ClockÎ19 mutant mice show unique characteristics of circadian rhythms such as extended free running periods, amplitude attenuation, and high-magnitude phase-resetting responses. Here we investigated what modifications occur in the spatiotemporal organization of clock gene expression in the SCN of ClockÎ19 mutants. The cultured SCN, sampled from neonatal homozygous ClockÎ19 mice on an ICR strain comprising PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE, demonstrated that the Clock gene mutation not only extends the circadian period, but also affects the spatial phase and period distribution of circadian oscillations in the SCN. In addition, disruption of the synchronization among neurons markedly attenuated the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of individual oscillating neurons in the mutant SCN. Further, with numerical simulations based on the present studies, the findings suggested that, in the SCN of the ClockÎ19 mutant mice, stable oscillation was preserved by the interaction among oscillating neurons, and that the orderly phase and period distribution that makes a phase wave are dependent on the functionality of CLOCK.\n\nAltered hippocampal replay is associated with memory impairment in mice heterozygous for the Scn2a gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiddleton, Steven J; Kneller, Emily M; Chen, Shuo; Ogiwara, Ikuo; Montal, Mauricio; Yamakawa, Kazuhiro; McHugh, Thomas J\n\n2018-06-04\n\nAn accumulating body of experimental evidence has implicated hippocampal replay occurring within sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) as crucial for learning and memory in healthy subjects. This raises speculation that neurological disorders impairing memory disrupt either SPW-Rs or their underlying neuronal activity. We report that mice heterozygous for the gene Scn2a, a site of frequent de novo mutations in humans with intellectual disability, displayed impaired spatial memory. While we observed no changes during encoding, to either single place cells or cell assemblies, we identified abnormalities restricted to SPW-R episodes that manifest as decreased cell assembly reactivation strengths and truncated hippocampal replay sequences. Our results suggest that alterations to hippocampal replay content may underlie disease-associated memory deficits.\n\nSmad3 mutant mice develop colon cancer with overexpression of COX-2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Yu-Ping; Liu, Zhuo; Fu, Zhi-Xuan; Li, De-Chuan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nColon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-associated mortality in human populations. The aim of the present study was to identify the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in Smad3 mutant mice, which are known to develop colon cancer. Homozygous Smad3 (â/â) mutant mice were generated from inbred and hybrid Smad3 mouse strains by intercrossing the appropriate heterozygotes. Immunohistochemistry with COX-2 antibody was performed throughout this experiment and the data was validated and cross-checked with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Homozygous mutant Smad3 mice were generated and the overexpression pattern of COX-2 was identified by immunohistochemistry and validated with RT-PCR. The results of the present study demonstrated a link between the Smad3 mutant mice, colon cancer and COX-2. In addition, the overexpression pattern of COX-2 in Smad3 mutant mice that develop colon cancer was identified.

To investigate the origin of the mutations, we developed and applied a new method that combined deep amplicon resequencing with a Bayesian model to detect and quantify allelic fractions with improved sensitivity. Of 174 SCN1A mutations in DS probands which were considered âde novoâ by Sanger sequencing, we identified 15 cases (8.6%) of parental mosaicism. We identified another five cases of parental mosaicism that were also detectable by Sanger sequencing. Fraction of mutant alleles in the 20 cases of parental mosaicism ranged from 1.1% to 32.6%. Thirteen (65% of 20) mutations originated paternally and seven (35% of 20) maternally. Twelve (60% of 20) mosaic parents did not have any epileptic symptoms. Their mutant allelic fractions were significantly lower than those in mosaic parents with epileptic symptoms (P = 0.016). We identified mosaicism with varied allelic fractions in blood, saliva, urine, hair follicle, oral epithelium, and semen, demonstrating that postzygotic mutations could affect multiple somatic cells as well as germ cells. Our results suggest that more sensitive tools for detecting lowâlevel mosaicism in parents of families with seemingly âde novoâ mutations will allow for better informed genetic counseling.

Mice lacking otoconia cannot sense the direction of the gravity vector and cannot swim properly. This study aims to characterize the behavior of mergulhador (mlh), otoconia-deficient mutant mice. Additionally, the central catecholamine levels were evaluated to investigate possible correlations between behaviors and central neurotransmitters. A sequence of behavioral tests was used to evaluate the parameters related to the general activity, sensory nervous system, psychomotor system, and autonomous nervous system, in addition to measuring the acquisition of spatial and declarative memory, anxiety-like behavior, motor coordination, and swimming behavior of the mlh mutant mice. As well, the neurotransmitter levels in the cerebellum, striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus were measured. Relative to BALB/c mice, the mutant mlh mice showed 1) reduced locomotor and rearing behavior, increased auricular and touch reflexes, decreased motor coordination and increased micturition; 2) decreased responses in the T-maze and aversive wooden beam tests; 3) increased time of immobility in the tail suspension test; 4) no effects in the elevated plus maze or object recognition test; 5) an inability to swim; and 6) reduced turnover of dopaminergic system in the cerebellum, striatum, and frontal cortex. Thus, in our mlh mutant mice, otoconia deficiency reduced the motor, sensory and spatial learning behaviors likely by impairing balance. We did not rule out the role of the dopaminergic system in all behavioral deficits of the mlh mutant mice. Copyright Â© 2018.

In this study, we assessed if such physiological and behavioral hyperactivity was also detectable in a fear-eliciting situation (actual threat). For this purpose, the behaviors and CORT level elevations in Lurcher mice were compared with those of littermate controls in the predator exposure test: mice were exposed either to a rat (exposure) or to a brief wave of the experimenter's hand (sham exposure). While the basal CORT concentrations (24âh before testing) were not significantly different between mice of both genotypes, the post-exposure ones were higher in Lurcher than in control mice whatever the condition of the experimental design (exposure or sham exposure). Predator exposure did not provoke significant increase of CORT levels whatever the genotype. On the contrary, our data clearly showed that fear-related behaviors of cerebellar mutants facing a real threat were exacerbated in comparison to those of control mice. These results suggest that the cerebellar cortex not only participates to fear conditioning and anxiety but also actively contributes to the modulation of the innate fear-related behaviors.

Serum and vascular klotho levels are reduced in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the reduced levels are associated with arterial calcification. Intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an n-3 fatty acid, reduces the risk of fatal coronary artery disease. However, the effects of EPA on arterial calcification have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of EPA on arterial calcification in klotho mutant mice. Four-week-old klotho mutant mice and wild-type (WT) mice were given a diet containing 5% EPA (EPA food, klotho and WT: n = 12, each) or not containing EPA (control food, klotho and WT: n = 12, each) for 4 weeks. Calcium volume scores of thoracic and abdominal aortas assessed by computed tomography were significantly elevated in klotho mice after 4 weeks of control food, but they were not elevated in klotho mice after EPA food or in WT mice. Serum levels of EPA and resolvin E1, an active metabolite of EPA, in EPA food-fed mice were significantly increased compared to those in control food-fed mice. An oxidative stress PCR array followed by quantitative PCR revealed that NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4), an enzyme that generates superoxide, gene expression was up-regulated in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of klotho mice. Activity of NOX was also significantly higher in SMCs of klotho mice than in those of WT mice. EPA decreased expression levels of the NOX4 gene and NOX activity. GPR120, a receptor of n-3 fatty acids, gene knockdown by siRNA canceled effects of EPA on NOX4 gene expression and NOX activity in arterial SMCs of klotho mice. EPA prevents arterial calcification together with reduction of NOX gene expression and activity via GPR120 in klotho mutant mice.\n\nMapping Mammary Epithelial Cell Transformation in BRCA1 Mutant Mice\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2006-07-01\n\nTransformation in BRCA1 Mutant Mice PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Gerburg M.

Thyroid hormone action requires efficient transport of T4 and T3 into target cells. We hypothesized that monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 8, encoded by Mct8 on the X-chromosome, is an essential thyroid hormone transporter in bone. To test this hypothesis, we determined the juvenile and adult skeletal phenotypes of male Mct8 knockout mice (Mct8KO) and Mct8D1D2KO compound mutants, which additionally lack the ability to convert the prohormone T4 to the active hormone T3. Prenatal skeletal development was normal in both Mct8KO and Mct8D1D2KO mice, whereas postnatal endochondral ossification and linear growth were delaye"
