        "text": "Alexa, play \"Baadshah o Baadshah\".\n\nWhile I hardly think anyone needs any convincing as to why Shah Rukh Khan is the King of Bollywood, here's a list of words spoken by him that'll remind you why he was, is, and will always remain the king of our hearts:\n\n1. When, in his first-ever TED Talk, he summarised his job profile in an incredibly sublime manner:\n\n2. When he was the best person to represent Bollywood movies on an international platform:\n\n3. Here's what he has to say to directors on why he refrains from playing realistic bad guy roles:\n\n4. This is him crediting his success to his undying desire to entertain people:\n\n5. Here, he lets us in on how rumour mills on news platforms have affected his morning routine:\n\n6. I always wondered if his mega-stardom affects his personality and habits. This is what he had to say:\n\n7. Remember when he was unapologetically self-obsessed and admitted to being just that?\n\n8. And when he knew exactly what people want from him:\n\n9. This is how he successfully evaded a reporter's question about whether he had any affiliations with a political party, or whether he planned to have one in the future:\n\n10. When he explained the rules of Bollywood to Jonathan Ross:\n\n11. When, in a 2017 interview with Anupama Chopra, he said he knows love because he is love:\n\n12. When he had no qualms about being recognised all over the world:\n\n13. And when he had a message for those of us who wish to do things creatively:\n\n14. Here, he talks about what made him feel like a big movie star for the first time:\n\n15. And finally, here's SRK telling us what we all need to hear from time to time:\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, his eloquence and quick wit collectively make you want to pay attention to him. Just ask me â€” I could listen to Shah Rukh Khan all day!\n\nShare This Article"
