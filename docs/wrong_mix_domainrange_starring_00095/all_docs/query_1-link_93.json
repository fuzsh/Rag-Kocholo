        "text": "Year One\n\nComedy took a different approach this year with Jack Black starring in Year One as Zed exploring the tribesman life and humor along his pal Michael Cera playing Oh. Year one starts out with a bunch of tribesmen hunting in the forest for food to bring to the tribe, while all the man are more than capable and do their jobs there is one that stands out most from the others destroying the hunting party and doing everything bad , he is Zed a recently promoted Hunter from the rank of gatherer, those 2 being the only 2 jobs available for ancient mans of that time.\n\nThe 2 guys Zed and Oh are downed from doubt that they are the worst looked at persons from the whole tribe and no one respects them and no one has any respect for them; until Zed decides to eat from the forbidden fruit(something like the religious story of Adam and Eve and the forbidden apple) suddenly they realized that nothing happened and they werent struck by lightning nor did they get the ancient knowledge. But Zed wanting to be more than he is insisted that he got almighty and wise thing that got him kicked out from the tribe and almost got him killed; also his friend Ah joined the adventure, a bit reluctant at first but then he got settled with the situation.\n\nTheir first bump in the road was when they encountered 2 brothers arguing in the field; one was Abel and the other Cane, and after a short while Cane killed Abel in a fight and hid the body. As Zed and Ah were witnesses Cane quickly made them stick around and stay with him for the period. What followed was a series of events that gradually brought Zed and Ah to several funny situations some of them really hilarious and some life threatening.\n\nUntil a certain point when they reach Sodoma and realize that the 2 beautiful girls from their tribe were captured and sold as slaves there, that's when they devised a plan to save the 2 girls,Maya and Eema and be heroes so that they can win the hearts of their beloved.\n\nMost of the second part of the movie is taking place in the walls of the Sodoma citadel and our adventurers are put into some really tough situations that will undoubtedly spark a series of laughters from your side. I really enjoy Jack Black as a comedian even though most of his works were never that good and didnt manage to gather the audience he might wanted but its still nice to see more comedy films out there in this world of cheesy romance when all the films feel like one another.\n\nWatch it for some laughters and the Jack Black typical humor. It's worth the time.\n\nTitle Content\n\nMovie: Year One\n\nDirector: Harold Ramis\n\nGenre: Adventure | Comedy\n\nTagline: Meet your ancestors\n\nPlot Outline: Zed, a prehistoric would-be hunter, eats from a tree of forbidden fruit and is banished from his tribe\n\nRuntime: 97 | 100 (unrated version)\n\nAwards: 1 nomination\n\nCast: Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross, Christopher Mintz-Plasse\n\nThat was it for this article.

The movie opens as two pretty Polish girls get off a plane in Mexico city, believing they are heading to a US modeling agency. But the agency turns out to be a front for slave traffickers, and as soon as the girls land, their passports are taken and theyre ushered to a van by seedy escorts.\n\nInstantly suspicious, one girl is hit by a car trying to escape, while Veronica (Alicja Bachleda-Curus) is spirited to a filthy apartment where shes raped by one of her captors. There she meets Jorges sister, 13-year-old Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), kidnapped while riding a bicycle Jorge gave her for her birthday. The two girls help each other survive, as coyotes smuggle them along clandestine routes in a nightmarish ordeal.\n\nIn his desperate search, Jorge eventually hooks up with Ray (Kevin Kline), an off-duty fraud detective from Texas. Ray and Jorge make an unlikely team in the hunt for Jorges sister, bolstered as much by fortuitous luck as by Jorges guts.\n\nThe movie is buoyed by exceptionally strong performances by Bachleda-Curus and Gaitan, and by the gritty realism of their plight. Marco Pérez also turns in an excellent, understated performance as the coyote Manuelo, both ruthless and ridden with guilt, and Kate del Castillo is wonderful as the utterly amoral slave trader, Laura.\n\nGerman director Marco Kreuzpaintner uses Jose Riveras (Diarios de Motocicleta) screenplay to lift the movie beyond a myopic ordeal of two girls to hint at the larger global problem. But the number of coincidences necessary for the storyline undermine the plots complexity, and hackneyed writing makes it too easy for audiences to pigeonhole sexual slavery as just another problem caused by those f***ing gringos. Ramos is engaging when hes allowed to be natural, but Kline is so restrained his performance is on an emotional par with warm milk.\n\nTrade would be a mediocre gambit if it werent for the vital importance of the subject matter. The US State Department estimates between 600,000  800,000 people are trafficked across borders every year, though some reports put the estimate as high as 4 million.\n\nThe movie has a social conscience, and tries to use it. (Trades website even lists several organizations where people can get involved and take action.) And that, plus the two stellar performances of its lead actresses, put it on the must see list.\n\nGrade: B\n\nRating: R\n\nRunning time: 119 minutes\n\nThis was an intense one.

For various reasons culture casts sensibility and sensitivity to all of us. In every sphere of life we feel its deep breathing. Culture has its developing time dimension in the areas of Arts too. Film or the moving images come in this context. The need for a theory for better understanding, study and observation of the subject encompassing the two important and apparently different domains viz. the social and the aesthetic - the cultural theory is constantly forming its shapes with its burgeoning ideas and implementations in various disciplines calling - postmodernism, Popular Culture, Feminism, and Post-Feminism, Marxism, and Post-Marxism, Utilitarianism, Culturalism, Formalism, Structuralism and Post- Structuralism, Psychoanalysis, Ethnographic Surrealism, Post- Colonialism, Literary theory, film theory, Subaltern studies etc. Film studies is considered as a branch of cultural studies. Since the 70s cultural studies come into the serious academic periphery of study and research - especially centre for contemporary Cultural Studies in the Birmingham University, U.K.\n\nNow in the twilight years of the twentieth century and at the time of dawning of the twenty first we like to look back upon the escalating cultures cumulated in our time in the flux of the past centuries. Film is our subject in which we put our process of theorising film and culture with Indian sensibilities for finer understanding of our Time (or timelessness), Place (or placelessness) and Art. To shape this journal up to a reader of Contemporary Cultural Theory and Film both national and international scholars from various disciplines of Cultural Studies an film present their papers of high thought of culture in popular level for an interesting better reading of the subject.\n\nRed Door\n\nOpens: Viewpoints from\n\nCultural and Critical Theories\n\nIn this paper Dr. Arup Ratan Ghosh constructs a model of film analysis exploring various ideas and concepts from the cultural and critical theories of Freud and Lacan, Saussure, Foucault, Barthes, Derrida, Eco and of Postmodernism and Deconstruction.\n\nLal Darja (Red Door, 1996) belongs to the handful of films in the post Satyajit Indian film scenario. It remains in the always-waiting mode for special evaluation and analysis. Keeping this very first sentence of this paper in the utmost care for understanding and analysis diachronically or in the perspective of history let us advance step by step for re-visualising and analysing the film irrespective of time,i.e. synchronically. But indeed in its process the contemporary history will produce the chiaroscuro of its various nuances of light and shadow.\n\nLal Darja is the door of heart  what under the spell of pure simplicity opens up suddenly feeling one astonished. On the contrary, it never opens without the presence of innocent simplicity. Both the absence and presence of such kind of childhood simplicity are kept in numerous moments throughout the film for being developed to create a splendid visual sensation - sometimes with intensity and sometime in a subdued manner. In this context, we remember Jacques Derridas deconstruction theory specially its fundamental concepts of Presence/absence or Prolific tracing. If we deconstruct the film applying the model of Derridas deconstruction theory and film, then we find the deconstruction of the different signs used in the film and their inner differences. In this way, we also find that Lal Darja gradually gets its different new centres. This kind of shifting of centres with which Derrida created a big bang in the Western metaphysical assumption (which generally holds that a structure has a fixed centre) reading his paper \"Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourses of the Human Sciences\" (1966).\n\nLet us Observe Lal Darja through this kind of Derridean deconstruction. But before that it is required to have a look on the structure of events narrated in the film.\n\nThe textures of the narration\n\nDr. Nabin Datta is a dentist who is unhappy both in his family and marital life. From time to time he consults with a general physician. He discloses him that he has a peculiar disease and its symptom is a feeling of iron-like-body stiffening. His wife turns him down on bed for this reason. But the general physician cannot find anything wrong with his body.\n\nBeside that, Dr. Dattas only child studies in a school residing in a hostel at Darjeeling, communicates only with his mother through telephone thus totally ignoring his father. He even refuses to talk with him. Gradually we come to know that the dentists wife feels herself unhappy in her family and from time to time goes to her old lover secretly. But one day Dr. Datta comes to know about her secret affairs. As the events in the family roll on, her wife goes to stay somewhere. She tells her husband that she is going there at least for a period of time. Coming from hostel their son goes to her mother and Dr. Datta has to leave him to her new home.\n\nDr. Datta tries to compare his unhappy interpersonal relationship which has almost shatters into pieces-with the out and out successful marital life and love affairs of his driver Dinu. He has two wives in two different places and moreover he has a teenage lover somewhere else. On Dr. Dattas request he lets him introduced with all his counterparts. Dr. Datta astonishingly comes to know that each of them knows everything about her husband or beloved without feeling any problem. Dr. Datta can not understand how does the driver can manage to lead a smooth life with three women. He poses a question how he manages so much expenditure for them.\n\nThe director of the film Buddhadeb Dasgupta emphatically begins the film creating a forceful dimension of the social milieu of the film showing the sudden killing of a woman in a city - street in open daylight. Sitting in his car, Dr. Datta stares at the incident feeling himself very much uneasy. His uneasiness spreads throughout the film. One day a patient comes to his chamber. Surprisingly we see one day Dr. Datta asks him whether he will be able to murder someone in lieu of money. He agreed to the proposal and we see, that guy and Dr. Datta going out by car downtown in search of a professional murderer known to the patient. But Dr. Datta makes him get down from the car midway changing his mind. Considering him a whimsical man the patient goes away at a distance. It is shown as if the whole murder assignment venture is but an imaginary vision of Dr. Datta or revelation of some of his unconscious feelings. In the end as well as from time to time we find Dr. Datta and the physician sit face to face. Coming for consulting about the iron like-body stiffening disease Dr. Datta is actually telling his own story of life. So they appear altogether occasionally in the film but actually this consultation all through the film is mere imagination of Dr. Datta.\n\nIntertextuality\n\nOccasionally intercutting the linear narration of the film the scene of televiewing comes in. Sometimes we find programmes like news telecasting. From these we listen Recently a type of disease has been spreading quickly whose symptom is iron like body stiffening. From the T.V. bulletin we come to know that the investigation for the murder of the woman in the street is going on. It is also assumed that behind the murder there lies love affairs. Dr. Datta is seen to hide his uneasiness listening to that in the T.V. news because he is one of the eye witnesses of that murder and also for the reason that he is about to take a move to murder his wife by the help of a professional murderer.\n\nReading and analysis after Lacan\n\nBesides these, the TV-screen often becomes very much appealing in different modes with the individual style of the director. Time and again an innocent face of a boy appears in the midst of television flow wearing red dress. His close-up magnifies covering the whole screen. Probably he is the image of the childhood days of Dr. Nabin Datta. He calls Dr. Datta who is tired of and dissatisfied with his life to return to the reality of his childhood (which in a sense is a kind of surreality to us). The image beckons him mysteriously Rise up Nabin, rise up! Nabin the aged mirroring in his other self feels himself restless. What he visualises in his minds eye appears in the TV screen. There we find a boy wearing a red sweater wandering in the open natural surrounding of Cherapunji. The total frame overlaps with spectacular sights of fields, mountains and clouds of Cherapunji. There we find the boy is uttering a kind of magic rhyme \n\nOh, little fatty ant\n\nLet the door open\n\nHe thinks (as per the local popular folk belief) if someone being in front of a door or a gate chants the rhyme sincerely making a fist of his hand, then the door or the gate opens surprisingly. His father also confirms that to him.\n\nDue to the cinematic representation of the beautiful natural scenes and surrounding of Cherapunji the Space becomes dreamlike, What appears to child Nabin as real but to the aged Dr. Datta who envisages these in the screen of his remembrances and probably even to us is surreal. In the midst of conflicts and transitions of the real and the surreal the child Nabin as well as we find in surprise that the gate of an abandoned house opens slowly. In astonishment and in joy he runs to his father to reveal the wondrous truth. But now-a-days it seems impossible to happen again neither to Dr. Datta nor to us who exist in the postmodern time. In this age or time which has lost its innocence no Red Door or the gate-of-heart opens or no one or nothing in the junction of our present time and space calls in innocence and simplicity to reach the depth of the inner core. Probably we have lost any feeling for having an urge for this kind of inward simple drive. But for the absence of it we feel a sort of pain or suffering, possibly this mixed feeling makes us nostalgic or explorer, for searching out something. But exactly for which we as well as the characters are searching is nowhere clear or developed in the film. This kind of characteristics of the films of Tarkovsky come in our mind contextually. The word anweshhan or search has a special connotation to Buddhadeb Dasgupta. He reflects \n\n Cinema  to me is a kind of search.\n\n For which? Is this a search for getting the meaning of life ?\n\n No. I dont want to explain the word anwesan or search. I dont want to club any word with it, if any thing is put beside search the mystery of this word spoils.\n\nThe image of child Nabin chiefly develops into the TV set put in the drawing room of Dr. Nabin Datta. As sometimes after the news telecast we get the image of child Nabin and his innocent simplicity which are gone for ever from Dr. Dattas life as well as from our postmodern time. So it is no more possible to open the Red Door or the door of the heart. So Dr. Datta failing to keep the inter personal relationship properly becomes an unhappy man in his family. He stares at his other self in the cathartic escape of nostalgia. Either the other self of him or the phase of his loving past, he has lost all for ever. One can compare the consciousness for this phase of life with the concept of mirror stage of Jacques Lacan (1901-81). Chiefly the psychiatrist Lacan holds that a baby within six to eighteen months gradually learns to identify different objects surrounded by him. He gradually begins to identify his I differentiating from the other objects. With the concept of mirror stage and the other works of Lacan the tradition of Lacanian interpretation on the works of literature, art and film continues. In Lacanian reading often we get the process of the subject being dead losing its identity as it faces with the re-presentation of the subject or of the other self or of the other re-presentations. Here in Lal Darja we find similar face to face positions of the subject and its representation. The TV screen appears as a mirror through which Dr. Datta looks back upon the lost other self of him or presentation of his by-gone phase of life or re-presentation of the Other. He becomes able to identify himself and his image. As we see in the film the image of his other self emerges covering the whole screen which actually in secretly all-pervading in his life making re-presentation as the ultimate. This condition is remarked in the cultural theory as The death of subject.\n\nThe child Nabin is the other-form or the The Other of the middle aged Nabin. The name Nabin which generally means new, fresh, very young etc. makes a feeling of the Other of the aged dentist who in spite of his age is heard to be called as Nabin creating a contrasting impression of his two selves. On the other hand, the driver of the dentist who is very much successful in making interpersonal relationship and everybody of his class or type in the society are the Other of Dr. Datta and the people belonging to his class or type who fail to maintain proper interpersonal relationship (among whom probably many of us belong). In this way looking at Lal Darja as a whole through the mirror of Lacanian reading, we find our postmodern time as the other or different presentation or re-presentation. Again if we look at the representation of all these images magnifying, them we find ourselves being hidden behind these re-presenting and gradually submerging into the \"fathomless\" depth.\n\nAnd Postmodernity\n\nFrom the technical point of view the screening of a film is actually the assimilation and revelation of electronic images. In a more complicated way television is also like that. Television, video, electronic display board, computer, internet etc. are dominating all around us. Being networked by circuits and electronic images we also have become something like electronic terminals. We pass signals through us. Through simulation we are often creating make believe worlds. Virtual reality appears as concrete. The TV images of child Nabin is a kind of virtual reality to Dr. Nabin Datta. To the director it is the entrance of surreality into reality what he also observes in the films of Buñuel.\n\n\"Buñuel presents simultaneously the real and the non-real with much ease as if he is playing with these elements. To speak of anything like surrealism or extension of reality  we always find him to develop them with his extraordinary skill of presenting the film in exceptionally smooth easiness. But whenever his films face the audience they look upon their inner selves about their interactions with the moving images.\" 2 We may also consider it to be a dream sequence or a dream like sequence. But the construction of this dream has been manufactured electronically. Nabin, the boy develops through television screen. Unlike Ramprasad the worshiper of goddess Kali in the film Sadhak Ramprasad (Ramprasad the worshiper) where Ramprasad who sees the goddess helping him construct the fence of his cottage in the open atmosphere of a countryside, the dream- reality of Lal Darja does not come in such a way. It comes through television re-creating virtual reality through the simulation of electronic images  representing the electronic and visual culture of our life. This characteristic feature is postmodern both in our social life and film. Excessive sex and violence are some of the prominent features of postmodern social life. Of which the element of violence being present casually in the beginning of the film apprises us of the present time and its surrounding atmosphere. Here, I am speaking of the murder of the passer-by woman in the street in front of many people. Again planning for murder goes on for a short period as Dr. Datta stops all of a sudden. In actuality the dentist fancies the plan for murder in his imagination.\n\nTerry Gilliams Brazil (1985) is a postmodern film. Of different features of postmodernism one is the presentation of high technology, even imaginary technology of the future side by side with the period indicating old fashioned furniture in the mise én scene. As a computer is shown in the film which looks like an old typewriter. But through this computer virtual banking or online banking is shown. Here the hero and the heroine are occasionally flying in the sky creating virtual reality. A cosmonaut looking like Jatayu the famous defending bird in the Ramayana is also shown here to move in the space.\n\nPsychoanalysis - Postmodernity - Dream-reality\n\nThe treatment of dream reality becomes intense when it is understood that the patient whom Dr. Datta considers as the murderer. Actually the real murderer is no more shown in the film. His thinking comes out of his listening to the TV news and visualising the murder scene which in co-incidence he has eye witnessed. With all these his own desire for murdering the lover of his wife forms the thought that (probably following the chain of Freudian free association) the patient coming for extracting a tooth is the murderer of the woman in the street. In this context Buddhadeb Dasgupta once commented that, \"Dr. Datta is observing the murder in the television. One can get the idea of murdering someone from television. 1 Here reality, Freudian psychoanalysis and virtual reality made out of electronic images have mingled up in intense postmodernity and in Buddhadebs favourite dream- reality as well as in the maya. This sort of complicated conceptual cognition and re-presentation comes more close to us when gradually it becomes clear that Dr. Dattas consultation with the general physician, occasionally shown in the film is but mere imagination of the dentist. The imaginary appearance of the physician comes out of the trauma of present time which mingles with the unique treatment of dream reality by Sri Dasgupta. If we go a little farther, we may think that the imaginary physician is actually making psychoanalysis of Dr. Datta throughout the film.\n\nLacanian The Other in re-presentation, dream reality and the death of subject.\n\nThe old house of Dr. Datta and the old fashioned furniture are seen in this film where a modern TV set is kept which again comes as the Other of Dr. Datta in his personal level of cognition. To him the other form of the body Nabin in the back ground of Cherapunji is entirely dream-like. In the preceding film of Buddhadeb, Charachar, there also recurs splendid dream-like scene to the main character of the film. The spectacular repeated scene or sequence is overspreading plenty of colourful birds in the cottage interior. The recurrence of dreamlike-scenes is common to both the films.\n\nSimilarly we can name an earlier film like Les belles des jours (1952) by Réné Claire and to name a contemporary film Ma-da-de-o (Not Yet, 1992) by Kurosawa comes into mind. In the latter film Hyakken Uchida a retired professor, seems to be always with his dear students enjoying his retired life. With this narration from time to time we see sequence of dream-reality overspreading throughout the frame where the natural background becomes dominant with its horizon touching fields and expanding sky. A few boys and girls are seen playing hide-and-seek game in that natural surroundings. The boys and girls call their partner who is going to hide himself in a very much melodious tune mo-i- ka-i or Are you ready? Then the child who has hidden, himself somewhere nearly responses also in a melodious tune ma-da-de-o or not yet. The childhood simplicity and the dream-like appearance of nature from the dream-reality which actually is the Other. The director Kurosawa - through this kind of treatment of dream reality wants us to sense that the moment of death of the professor has not yet come. But there comes a time in the film when the melodious tune of ma-da-de-o can not be heard. The companion in the play has hidden himself for ever. All the companions are seeking for their partner chanting mo-i-ka-i or Are you ready? But no one responds. This sort of the Other or representation suggests the death of the professor. In other way, we see the death of subject in Lal Darja chiefly in the emphasis on the child Nabins calling for Dr. Datta to return to the space and time of simplicity and innocence. But in this age innocence is dead. Nothing in this age can be innocent or simple. This postmodern feature of our time sponges itself in Lal Darja creating repeated appearances of the scene in a way sensing us as dead subjects. All are done by Buddhadeb Dasgupta in his own style which is aesthetically enriched.\n\nAbsurdity\n\nIn the TV news suddenly it is heard that a strange disease has been spreading everywhere quickly whose symptoms are iron- like body-stiffening. It is an absurd element. In the Theatre of the Absurd we have seen many other examples like that. As we have seen and heard in the play Rhinocéros by Eugène Ionesco where beginning with one or two people everybody in France except the two characters Berenger and Daisy has been turned into rhinoceroses. Even it is thought that the mankind in the whole world have been metamorphosed into rhinoceroses. This kind of absurd en mass metamorphosis is anticipated when Berenger and Daisy tune on the radio to get information and listen only to the grunts of the rhinoceroses. The rhinos have occupied the radio station. They are probably reading news in their own language. Any human language is now obsolete. Later in the play we find Daisy to turn herself into a rhinoceros too. There remains Berenger only as a man as he refuses to become a rhinoceros and desires to save the human race from converting into something other.\n\nIn Lal Darja peoples body becoming stiff like iron is more or less like the changes into rhinoceroses. In this context the words and notions of the poem Robots Song and the other poems on Robot theme by Buddhadeb Dasgupta come to our mind. In an interview Buddhadeb also speaks \"Here I want to say about the robotisation of man.\" 1\n\nDerridean deconstruction\n\nPutting Lal Darja in the model of Derridean Deconstruction and film we can observe a play of presence/ absence to continue through the different elements of film. As the presence of the child Nabin wearing a vibrant red-coloured dress in the natural background of Cherapunji, simultaneously shifts the other elements or signs of the film then and then into the realm of absence. Again what that dream-like scene announces is actually absent. Moreover, the signs of this scene being different with the signs of the other part of the film initiate us to apply the theory of difference by Derrida where, he citing examples with some words like but put etc. and with some other elements show that changing the signs a little (as b, p etc.) how sense appears changing. It is through presence/ absence we can follow the Derridean notion of prolific tracing. If we consider the moments of the film separately, then we see they are not moving. A moment noticing absence of the other moments and pronouncing its own presence itself becomes, absent in the following moments. In the history of space and time Zeno in the fifth century, Greece put this giving example of a flying arrow. An arrow flies from A to B but if one considers any single moment separately then it can be seen that the very moment is no more a moving or flying moment. That moment is both the nucleus of its own presence as well as of absence of the other moments. We can observe similarly if we take any sequence or filmic element as moment-like- element and if we follow the film after prolific tracing. As the scenes, sequences and happenings of villages/ the scenes, sequences of the city. Dr. Datta, the child Nabin, the driver/ the lover of Dr. Dattas wife, the son of Dr. Datta (i.e. the different characters who act as differant are clearer). The TV news/ the murder in the street, Dr. Dattas consultation with the physician/ consultation with the patient who suggest the underworld, the imaginary visions of Dr. Datta in general the hard reality of the film in general etc. are developed through prolific tracing. At the base of Derridean deconstruction theory remains non-fixed centricity i.e. analysing a centre one can find different centres and in this way an on going process of finding newer centres continue. If we analyse Lal Darja in this way, we get the centre of sexual repression and on the outer side the centre of socio-economic and socio-political complicated network. Gradually in this way following the path of Derridean deconstruction one can enter into the structure. The suggestion of this method was revealed in the Kathoponishada centuries before where Yama (the god of death) advised Nachiketa (a truth seeking learner) saying know thyself or atamanang biddhi.\n\nFollowing Foucault and the concept of splitted histories\n\nIn this period of ever accelerating sex and violence, dream is the postmodern solution. Norman. K. Denzin categorically tells us like that. Presenting Nabins dream and the period of its existence Lal Darja shows us also like that. Is this period within the span of history? Certainly to the historians it is but to the New Historicists? Some of them have announced the end of history-! History has come to an end. They hold this idea because many of them think that history is an unwritten agenda. An agenda has an end. It can not be infinite. So history has also an end but the flow of human life has no end. Moreover, an agenda is based on continuity, discipline and aim but looking upon the present time we can not find any such thing properly. Then the time now going on is the post-history period. Lal Darja is the representation of this time. According to Foucault history is neither linear nor a summation of continuous happening. History is discontinuous. The fragmented histories are synthesised in Lal Darja. The histories depicted there are of sexual, economic, political, interpersonal and of dream. According to Foucault, the knowledge and will to power of man cut histories in fragments. Looking upon the histories of whole civilisation human beings are developed as symptoms. It is better to say in this context that a few men instead of the human beings in general because everybody does not come into the corpus of history. Generally the history is filled in by the powerful. The director Buddhadeb in Lal Darja presented histories by cutting them into fragments and the human characters in the film come out as symptoms of human civilisation. Contextually the story-element of Lal Darja is written by Buddhadeb himself. Here his poems Red Ant and For Hassan and his other poems on the theme of Robotisation may be remembered. He remarked it will not be proper to say Lal Darja is a narrative of my life-story but it is true that here many of the memories of my life lie underneath. As the play of chanting the magic rhyme of the red ants clenching the fist is actually a play I used to play in my childhood days when I was in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAccording to Barthes\n\nIn the context of reading the film if we consider the point of views of Roland Barthes or others like him we can not take along us the writer or the author any more. As soon as a writing is published the author dies and readers born. Following Barthes we can find Lal Darja as a site or as a cross road. Many complexities of the time and space are mixed here. Various readers can analyse and conceptualise this text in different ways. From anywhere he can enter into the text and at any moment as he wishes can open or close the text. Like any other text Lal Darja is being reconstructed by the readers according to their desired taste and time.\n\nThe text : Eco\n\nIf Lal Darja provides certain analyses to their readers, then it can be said  a closed text as per Umberto Eco. Again if this film forms various analyses and notions, then according to Eco it can be called an open text for free reading.\n\nReading as a language following semiotics and cultural and critical theories\n\nFilm today is considered, analysed and exhibited as a language. As Lacan has seen the unconscious structured like a language Charles Jencks considers postmodern architecture as language. Many things and concepts are incorporated today in the orbit of language following the chain of sign ® signifier ® signified. From now on, Lal Darja will remain open to the readers/audience appealing to their heart and thinking. Throughout the paper we have taken a synthesised reading of Lal Darja following the notions and practices of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalyses, Derridean deconstruction, Foucaultian histories, the concepts on text by Barthes and Eco, Saussurian semiotics and through the concepts and cultural practices of postmodernism altogether making an intense search through the prism of cultural theory.\n\n1. From the interview with the author in 199798.\n\nIdeological State Apparatus\n\nLouis Althussers Marxist criticism forwarding Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs) and its counter part an important role in our culture may be unnoticingly to many of us. Taking important points both from the Structuralist and Poststructuralist views of Althussers thesis Dr. Arup Ratan Ghosh compares with a few contemporary films as from Simabadhya to Titanic in an application  mode of cultural theory and cultural studies.\n\nReading Indian films with Louis Althussers seminal essay Ideology and the State is interesting. Here we see two approaches of cultural theory. Althusser has developed his essay centring ideology. This approach takes us to structuralist Marxism on literary theory.** Again Althussers essay with which we are discussing where he has developed the notion of Ideological State Apparatus and of the construction (interpellation) of the human subject has been taken up in some post-structuralist work.\n\nNow reflecting the State Apparatus of Marxist theory and Althussers notion of Ideological State Apparatus in some contemporary Indian film we get different shades and nuances of cultural theory and practice with politico-cultural dimensions. To cite a concrete example of Althussers THESIS II Ideology has a material existence we can present Iswar in Subarnarekha, the doctor in Ganashatru, Mama in Agantuk, Dadajan in Naseem, Dr. Vishmadeb Sharma in Sunya Theke Suru, Brati and the three other Naxalite comrades in Hazar Chaurashi ki Ma, Fakir in Fakir along with many other characters who are constructed as subject of ideology. In each a material existence of ideology sustains. Think also of Dr. Agniswar Mukherjee in Agniswar, Premnath in Bobby, the professors in Kora Kagaj and Astha, G. F. Kane in Citizen Kane, Dersu Ujala in Dersu Ujala, Mr. Schindler in Schindlers List or Rosy in Titanic.\n\nThese characters arrest our attention and simultaneously spread different shades of concentrate and then emit ideology creating surrounding effects in the respective films. But the spectators put these moving images of ideology or the world outlooks to discover the reality of the world. Even some characters presented in the films do this as Shyamalendu in Shimabaddha. Starting his career in a corporate house with a university-fresh good student of English-background gradually, he becomes the prey of decadent social values or a kind of Social Apparatus. Step by step he begins to believe in careerism, taking illegal and inhuman steps for profit and dehumanisation. It is only for his involvement along with a few personnel of his company, he arranges a bomb blast in the fan factory that caused an employees severe injury as well as Shyamalendus promotion for saving the company from a great loss. With his help the company could supply plenty of defective fans, obviously unethically.\n\nKeeping in tune with market economy Somnath in Jana Aranya do with ideology something like Shyamalendu in Seemabadhya. A college-fresh history-honours student victimised of poor marks as a result of callous negligence of the examiner who has to look over examination answer papers in the dim light of lantern as the electric power supply goes off. In this city this temporary power failure is called load-shedding. To earn his living Somnath gradually becomes the prey of consumerism. To get a better order for supplying goods he bribes the party sending his friends sister.\n\nThese two characters of Satyajit Ray like many others compare Ideology or interpret them in Althusserian model of Ideology, where he approaches his central thesis on the structure and functioning of ideology with.\n\nTHESIS I Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence.\n\nWe commonly call religious ideology, ethical ideology, legal ideology, political ideology, etc., so many world outlooks. Of course, assuming that we do not live one of these ideologies as the truth (e.g. believe in God, Duty, Justice, etc...), we admit that the ideology we are discussing from a critical point of view, examining it as the ethnologist examines the myths of a primitive society, that these world out looks are largely imaginary, i.e. do not correspond to reality.\n\nHowever, while admitting that they do not correspond to reality, i.e. that they constitute an illusion, we admit that they do not make allusion to reality and that they need only be interpreted to discover the reality of the world behind their imaginary representation of that world (ideology = illusion / allusion).** (p. 56)\n\nWe the readers (spectators) also compare the screened images of ideology with the reality of the world. We try to search out their significance to identify their relevance with our own time and to calibrate their propelling power in the contemporary world.\n\nBut the characters which I have mentioned earlier are themselves figures of ideology. With them, the films spread ideology. Then we can say such a character or such a film is an apparatus of ideology. Althusser says in his thesis II an ideology always exists in an apparatus, and its practice, or practices. This existence is material. * (p. 58)\n\nConsider Iswar and the film Subarnarekha. Being a refugee (owing to the partition of India), he with Haraprasad starts his life anew. They set up a school to educate the pupils of the colony. Haraprasad is uncompromising. He finds their refugee life as a turbulent site for struggle. He face this struggle along with others altogether. But getting a job opportunity near Ghatsila away from their Nabajiban colony Iswar accepts it considering their collective ideological world outlooks are largely imaginary i.e. do not correspond to reality. Though he left his uncompromising friend Haraprasad (who called him an escapist) and other fellow people from East Bengal. The life he started to live with his sister Sita and an adopted child Abhiram is ideological indeed. Later in the film we find the ideological clashes cause his ruin following the suicidal death of her sister and many other catastrophic incidents. In the film we find the effort for concretisation of the ideological imaginary relationship with reality and its demolishing consequences.\n\nThis process is seen in many other films including the films I have mentioned. For example Ganashatru. The cause for which the doctor is fighting is a very ideological one. He is in a combat against the superstitious belief and practices of the village people who devotionally drink the charanamrita of the god of their local temple which is made of contaminated water causing an epidemic. But the villagers blindly believe that the charanamitra is pious. Even they are encouraged to do so by the shrewd politicians and the administrators of the village mainly for their earning from the temple. The doctor has to face hard consequences to make his ideology effectively communicating. Satyajit Ray took the seminal idea of the film from Henrik lbsens play The Enemy Of The People.\n\nIn his last film Ray put his character mama as a moving icon of ideology. He is preaching for an unhindered flow of humanity from the prehistoric age to the modern civilisation in Rays subtle, suggestive and fine manner. Dont be a kupamandak  is his message to the stereotype people.\n\nSimilarly, Dadajan in Naseem is an old man who tries to hold the ideal of communal harmony and peace. He believes and wants other to believe in mankind as original, natural and ethical wiping out all the artificially stinged religious and political colours.\n\nDr. Vishmadev Sharma formerly a professor, a torture-victim at the police custody as a political prisoner, a Naxalite activist of the seventies comes out of jail as a semi-lunatic. Getting shelter at a friends house and with the warm and welcoming attitude of his friend and his sister he gets himself gradually improving towards normalcy. But he becomes absolutely normal and regains his full form when he is cordially and politically wanted by a group of revolutionaries with post- Marxist ideals. He joins them with all his ideologies with a hope of revolution or a social reformation. His delinked ideologies get link again. He becomes an activist again and starts dwelling in a slum leaving his friends well to do comfortable residence. He becomes a subject of ideology. As Althusser put Ideology interpellates individuals as subjects? It is as if with him and the boy of the underground party a sort of consciousness for revolution in general starts anew from the zero or nothingness of the nineties.\n\nThe unrest of the seventies in Bengal has also become the subject of Govind Nihalnis film Hazar Chourashi Ki Ma. Brati and three other comrades were brutally killed in an encounter with some anti-socials backed by rich influential persons. Bratis fried a female Naxalite Nandini had been tortured severely in the police custody resulting her permanent defective vision. Centring these characters the film becomes a subject of the Naxalite ideologies of the seventies. Whether the bearers of these ideologies in the seventies, as reflected in the film, are ideologically romantic Marxist with Utopian outlook or not is indeed a different question.\n\nAnother context comes to speak of this film is the Repressive State Apparatuses. In Marxist theory the State Apparatus contains the Government, the Administration, the Army, the Police, the Courts, the prison etc., which constitute what I shall in future call the Repressive State Apparatus. I here is Louis Althusser. He continues in his essay Ideology and the State as Repressive suggests that the state Apparatus in question functions by violence - at least ultimately (since repression, e.g. administrative repression, may take non-physical forms). This concept of repressive state Apparatus is violently visible in Hazar Chaurashi Ki Ma. The way police behaves, tortures and controls are heart choking. These incidents and their suggestions immediately remind one of the Repressive State Apparatuses. The same is true to the film Sunya Theke Suru. Obviously there are many other examples. I shall come in another contest of State Apparatus in detail afterwards.\n\nAs per Althusserian notion of subjection of ideologies to the subject we can read many artistic works or pieces including literature, film etc. I have given examples from some films. But there are many more. As Goutam Ghoses Fakir (1998) presents a Fakir a good broad-minded and almost saint-like person who mystically loves nature and human beings. Singing, dancing, courtship, love and coquetry all adore him mysteriously. Sometime he sees visions effacing the boundaries of the real and the surreal. Like Buñuel in this film surreality enters into reality concisising the spirit of a Fakirs mind and altitude to life or the ideology. The fakir in the film is not a proclaimed Fakir. Containing a Fakirs mental constitution to love nature, man and existence he lives anywhere among us. As the other characters of the film do with him  we the readers or spectators also do the same. This is  we put him as the subject of ideology in the set up of hard reality to find out the imaginary relationship with him and his ideologies which again is a traditional, mystic Indian attitude to life.\n\nIn the mainstream Indian cinema, like the serious films, we also find the same view points have been propelled up to find out ideology and its interpellation of individuals as subjects if we follow this aspect of Althussers Marxist literacy theory.\n\nAs Dr. Agniswar Mukhopadhaya in the film Agniswar is a character who tries to hold confidently all the Indian human values resisting the contemporary flux of decadence. To him medical practice is a noble profession instead of a buyer-seller relationship. He protests against dowry, vulgar tastes, exploitation and negligence to the children  actually against all the social injustices or compromising attitudes we face everyday.\n\nIn Bobby Premnath, Bobbys father appears as a man who considers love is above everything else. Wiping out their earlier family quarrel and driving out the enemies he joins hand in hand with his daughter making hand chain with his son-in-law and begins the concluding song of the film. He ideologises his notion of human love through the song Dont want gold or money, gems or jewels a mind is to be exchanged only with another mind (Na chaho sona chandi...).\n\nThe professor in Kora Kagaj wants to live in the world of ideals and high thinking. He wants to lead a simple peaceful life choosing profession of teaching. He is dead against all the artificially created needs. The clash starts with his mother-in-law who believes in comfort, ease and affluence. She unnecessarily thinks her daughter is in the soup as her husband is a believer of simple way of living.\n\nAgain the professor in Astha teaches English literature in a college and thinks a lot about the sociological issues of consumerism and exploitation of women in India. He discusses about these issues and contexts with his students in his home. He cites examples, narrates and analyses to set up a relevance with the present day consumerism. But ironically, we find his wife becomes the victim of consumerism and exploitation to an extreme level. Suddenly the professors favourite girl student comes to know all about this. On her endeavour the wife tells how she has been victimised and still being exploited. She disclosed all to her husband as well as to all the favourite students at their place. In stead of being collapsed in shock the professor accepts his wife as usual with the confidence of belief (astha) on humanity.\n\nRosebud is the concentrated word and imagery of human ideals for which C.F. Kane, a tycoon of American newspapers seeks for throughout his life in vain. He always tries to concretise the imaginary relationship with his ideals of love (never fulfilled) and the wealthy, luxurious and rich identity of him and his (so called) real world.\n\nDersu Ujala in Kurasawas moving film of the same name moves us with the ideals of natural existence, artificiality of urban rationality and civilisation etc. The film made in Russian language shot in Siberian forest area centres a simple man who lives in the forest. His name is Dersu Ujala. He helps a survey team of the U.S.S.R. government by showing them the forest itinerary and guiding them through the difficult situations like melting glaciers, and flash flood, facing a wild tiger etc. The captain of the team loves him. After many years the captain comes again in the forest and recognises Dersu. Dersu becomes his companion as he was years before. A concrete example of nature, its ceaseless tradition, and revolt is Dersu Ujala. Considering Dersu who has become a little age-worn and mainly out of love captain takes him at his residence in the city. But Dersu appears as a quite misfit there. He wants to live erecting a tent in the open ground in front of the house. He cut a tree in the park. Suddenly he blank fires with his gun as if he is in a forest. He does not understand how people live in boxes (rooms). So the captain keeps his back in the forest again presenting him a pair of glass and a powerful rifle Later he was informed and asked by the government to identify Dersu who was killed by someone in the deep forest. The captain goes accordingly and considers Dersu was killed to snatch his new rifle even in that forest. In this way the ideology of nature and simplicity were contaminated by the remote sensing of civilisation. Here again ideology and its imaginary relationship with the hard reality can be traced shockingly.\n\nWe have seen how Schindler has tried to save the Jews with his guts, command and intelligence from the torture of the opponents in the Schinders List.\n\nLove is the ideology submerged everywhere in the Titanic. When Titanic is submerging gradually and everybody is panicky  wants to escape from the ship Rosy refused to leave the ship by the rescue boat as her lover is not allowed to leave the ship. Once in a suicidal moment the boy saved Rosys life. And afterwards they fall in love. Rosy remembers all in such a fatal sinking moment. Male passengers of the ship were not allowed to have room in the lifeboats. Moreover, the boy was kept hand cuffed in a room at the lower deck. The sea water is gushing upwards., Almost doing an impossible task Rosy breaks the iron handcuffs hitting with a heavy hammer when the water has almost submerged the room. Evading many struggles, hurdles, and life risks they along with many others fall into the ocean as Titanic has drowned completely. Rosy has got a small buoy and the boy is just holding it submerging lower part of his body in the water. They are talking under the starry night floating in the vast sea. The ideology of love becomes a concrete cinematic imagery.\n\nSuddenly the boy dies. At that moment, as a coincidence, a rescue boat has come. The people there are flashing torchlight over the floating dead bodies. Rosy made up her mind quickly. Leaving the dead she fetches a whistle from a dead passenger floating near her and begins to blow a whistle so that the rescue-men can locate her then and then. Love transforms into a progressive attitude to life. This is the ideology reflected in Titanic.\n\nTo elaborate the very concept of ideology reflected in film I have given adequate examples and probably with a little exaggeration. The examples themselves are high pitched enough. Althusser does not always mean ideology in such a highly pitched manner. The basic concepts of ideology which we have mentioned earlier are (a) ideology is a Representation of the Imaginary Relation of Individuals to their real Conditions of Existence (b) Ideology has a material existence. (c) Ideology interpellates as subjects.\n\nAlthusser summarises about ideology in general in his own words as \n\nThe duplicate mirror-structure of ideology ensures simultaneously:\n\n1. the interpellation of individuals as subjects;\n\n2. their subjection to the Subject;\n\n3. the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects recognition of each other, and finally the subjects recognition of himself,\n\n4. the absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognise what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right. Amen  So be it * (p. 61)\n\nIn the context of ideological recognition and mis-recognisation. Althusser gives examples \n\nTo take a highly concrete example, we all have friends who, when they knock on our door and we ask, through the door, the question Whos there?, answer (since its obvious) Its me. And we recognised that it is him, or her. We open the door, and its true, it really was she who was there. To take another example, when we recognize somebody of our (previous) acquaintance ((re-)connaissance) in the street, we show him that we have recognised him (and have recognised that he has recognised us) by saying to him Hello, my friend, and shaking his hand (a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life  in France, at least; elsewhere, there are other rituals). *\n\nAgain we get more explanations of the four points he has given on the structure of the ideology as \n\nResult: caught in this quadruple system of interpellation as subjects, of subjection to the Subject, of universal recognition and of absolute guarantee, the subjects work, they work by themselves in the vast majority of cases, with the exception of the bad subjects who on occasion provoke the intervention of one of the detachments of the (repressive) State apparatus. But the vast majority of (good) subjects work all right all by themselves, i.e. by ideology (whose concrete forms are realised in the Ideological State Apparatuses). They are inserted into practices governed by the rituals of the ISAs. They recognize the existing state of affairs (das Bestehende), that it really is true that it is so and not otherwise, and they must be obedient to the God, to their conscience, to the priest, to de Gaulle, to the boss, to the engineer, that thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, etc. Their concrete, material behaviour is simply the inscription in life of the admirable words of the prayer: Amen  So be it.\n\nNow let us come into the context of ISAs. The State Apparatus from Marxist literary theory contains the Government, the Administration, the Army, the Police, the Courts, the Prisons, etc. Althusser considers them as repressive as they functions by violence. From here, he mentions the Ideological State Apparatus. I shall call ideological state apparatuses a certain number of realities which present themselves to the immediate observer in the form of distinct and specialised institutions. I propose an empirical list of these which obviously have to be examined in detail, tested, corrected and recognized. With all the reservation implied by this requirement, we can for the moment regard the following in situations as Ideological State Apparatuses (the order in which I have listed them has no particular significance):\n\n- the religious ISA (the system of different Churches),\n\n- the educational ISA (the system of the different public and private schools),\n\n- the family ISA,\n\n- the legal ISA,\n\n- the political ISA (the political system, including the different Parties),\n\n- the trade-union ISA,\n\n- the communications ISA (press, radio and television, etc.),\n\n- the cultural ISA (Literature, the Arts, sports, etc.). * (pp. 5455)\n\nThe ideological State Apparatuses function with ideology. But afterwards he mentions that even Repressive State Apparatuses function not only with violence but also with ideology.\n\nBut now for what is essential. What distinguishes the ISAs from the (Repressive) State Apparatus is the following basic difference: the Repressive State Apparatus functions by violence, whereas the Ideological State Apparatuses function by ideology.\n\nI can clarify matters by correcting these distinctions. I shall say rather that every State Apparatus, whether Repressive or Ideological, functions both by violence and by ideology, but with one very important distinction which makes it imperative not to confuse the Ideological State Apparatuses with the (Repressive) State Apparatus.\n\nThis is the fact that the (Repressive) State Apparatus functions massively and predominantly by repression (including physical repression), while functioning secondarily by ideology. (There is no such thing as a purely repressive apparatus.) For example, the Army and the Police also function by ideology both to ensure their own cohesion and reproduction, and in the values they propound externally. * (pp. 55  56)\n\nNow we see Cinema the whole system comes under the corpus of cultural ISA or even it can be said that there exists a Cinematic ISA containing censorship, spectatorship, authorship, funding, motivation for representation, aesthetics, profiteering etc.\n\nLooking in another way we find cinematic representations show us how we are tied up by different types of State Apparatuses both repressive and ideological. To see subjection of ideology into the subjects we recognise with them. The family ISA, the legal ISA, the political ISA, are the communications ISA and the cultural ISA with many ISAs, indeed moving the world of film and television and all sorts of moving images. It is strange enough that being invisibly confined by the state Apparatus we time to time find ourselves relieved and time to time constricted. This sort of feeling comes as Althusser puts in his Marxism it is through ideology that individuals are constituted as subjects  (mis-) recognizing themselves as free and autonomous beings with unique subjectivities. The construction of individuals or characters or even the actors and actresses under direction are all subjects of ideology. They, as well as, we are the representative signs of ideology. As ideology imposes itself not simply through consciousness nor through disembodied ideas but through systems and structures; ideology is inscribed in the representations (the signs) and the practices (the rituals) of everyday life. We can now say that films are series of representative signs of ideology and the impact film or television cast upon our society is the practices (rituals) of ideology in our everyday life.\n\nCapitalist system comes in the context of Althusserian notion of ideology. For Althusser, ideology is neither a matter of conscious beliefs, attitudes and values, nor is it a matter of false consciousness  sets of false ideas imposed on individuals to persuade them that there is no real contradiction between capital and labor or, more crudely, between the interests of the working class and ruling class. It is, rather a matter of the representation of imaginary version of the real social relations that people live: These imaginary versions of the real relations are necessary for the perpetuation of the capitalist system. ** pp. 52-53\n\nMost of the films are representations of imaginary versions of the real social relations that people live. But they represent so not always for the perpetuation of the capitalist system.\n\nThe examples from various films I have given are mostly emphasising on ideals or ethics with idealism. But to Althusser ideology is not always akin to or synonymous with ideals or ethics. Ideology comes out of ideas. That is important in general. Althusserian Marxism put ideology in the domain of capitalism. So we can start by saying that ideology  reproduces subjects who are willing workers in the capitalist system. Capitalism requires not only the hands of labor, but also the willingness of workers to subject themselves to the system  to accept the status quo  and it is in this area that ideology works. ** p. 52\n\nWe can compare this comment with many aspects of our life as well as film production. The willing workers being the subjects reproduced of ideology are here and there. 20th century Fox or the Warner Brothers, the Bollywood film industry, Rupert Murdoch, MTV corporation Plus Channel etc. and their producers are indeed willing workers in the Althusserian sense. They are enthusiastically fulfilling the hands of Capitalism or Late Capitalism or market economy surrounding all over the world leaving most of the people of the Third World into misery, poverty and political, cultural and ideological bankruptcy. At the same time we are submerging in the entertainment flow out of film and television flow as output and control of cinema /Television as Ideological State Apparatus.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Rice, Philip and Waugh, Patricia, Modern Literary Theory  A Reader, pp. 52-53, Edward Arnold, London, 1992, 2nd edn.\n\nEthnographic Surrealism and Cinema\n\nThis paper gives a new approach in studying films with two different kinds of cultural theory - Ethnography and Surrealism. After writing on Ethnographic surrealism Dr. Arup Ratan Ghosh put two contemporary Indian films Ganesh Pyne and Dil Se for his formative analysis.\n\nEthnographic surrealism  a concept as well as a practice can be astonishingly found in film at least to some extent. At the time of beginning and flourishing of the art of surrealism in various fields of art and literature viz. poetry, painting, photography, sculpture, film etc. since the 20s time to time we have found ethnographic expressions are intermingled in the creative pieces and their respective processes. In this age of postmodernism such expressions amalgamated as ethnographic surrealism find force with the application of computers, and for the uses of special effects in final moving images and/ or in the complex structure of representation.\n\nThe complex structure of cinematic expressions is now the context and text of this paper. For analyses I have chosen two recent films  one an entertainment feature film with tone and theme of seriousness i.e. Dil Se by Mani Ratnam and the other one is an artistically represented serious documentary  Ganesh Pyne by Buddhadeb Dasgupta. Before going to main discourse let me quote briefly the critical analysis of the film Trobriand Cricket: An Ingenious Response to Colonization  in the terrain of ethnographic surrealism and film:\n\nMy second example comes from the Trobriand Islands. It occurs in the classic ethnographic film made by Jerry Leach and Gary Kildea in collaboration with a local Trobriand political movement: Trobriand Cricket: An Ingenious Response to Colonialism. The gentlemans game, brought by British missionaries about the time Malinowski was on the scene, has been taken over and made new. Now it is lidic warfare, extravagant sexual display, political competition and alliance, parody. Something amazing has been concocted from elements of tradition, building on the missionaries game which has been \"rubbished\", working in symbols drawn from the military occupation of the islands during the Second World War. The film takes us into a staged swirl of brightly painted, feathered bodies, balls, and bats. In the midst of all this on a chair sits the umpire, calmly influencing the game with magical spells. He is chewing betel nut, which he shares out from a stash held on his lap. It is a bright blue plastic Adidas bag. It is beautiful. * 1\n\nSimilarly we can name the film The Visitors. The non-realism unfolds in The Visitors (Les Visiteurs, 1993) where a knight Sir Godefroy of France in 1122 A.D. on his way to meet his betrothed, fall under the spell of witch and kills his fiancées father unwillingly. To undo this terrible deed he goes to a wizard, who tells him the only remedy is to travel back in time and try to change his course of action. He brews a potion. Godefroy orders his faithful squire to drink it first and then join him. In the sudden fantasy we see the two of them just flying into the sky, vanish and as a consequence, arrive to their heirs house in 1992. They wash their face by the water of a commode and dont brother to off the tap of the basin, after washing. At last, of course, they come back to their actual time and place (i.e. Paris, 1122 A.D.) suddenly emerging from the sky.\n\nComing into the text and context of film and ethnographic surrealism I am going first to the documentary film Ganesh Pyne presented with adequate seriousness in both manner and matter.\n\nLooking at the engraved sculptures at the walls of various Indian temples protruded with the sculpted figures of the female dancers and studying to some extent the history of Indian classical dance  one may romantically infer that dance is the mobile sculpture and sculpture is the frozen dance. Releasing the frozen into mobility and transferring from one creative medium to another one sometimes the show of aesthetics transference process from a moving medium (puppetry, theatre, real life situations etc.) to a static (painting) one and again its reincarnation into mobility (film) Buddhadeb Dasgupta presented Ganesh Pyne and his art with beautiful changeovers of images occasionally creating surrealistic essence and sensibilities.\n\nTo show how an image or series of images come into an artists mind like Ganesh Pyne, Buddhadeb shows the rows of bicycle kept near Tollygaunge metro station. In the next shot we find separated wheels, tubes and even cycles are hanged in a big tree nearby the station. With this scene we enter into the world of surrealistic suggestions as well. The next shot reveals much more. In which we find a painting containing the process of non- naturalistic cycling by a quasi abstract human figure with expressionistic staring. The panoramic view of this painting reaches one to the domain of surrealism or we may say in the terrain of ethnographic surrealism. In his own words Buddhadeb calls this process as an entrance from the real to surreal. He loves to apply this practice in to his films which is somehow akin to Buñuel. In an interview with me he comments.\n\nAnother striking and interesting example of cinematic representation of ethnographic surrealism in this film is a sequence where a puppet show is going on enacting a religious or mythical drama. The kathputli actors (the wooden dolls of the puppeteers) are wearing gaudy costumes. There sentimental piece of enactment is ascending with loud, melodramatic acting remembering one of the manner and matter of traditional jatra performances in rural Bengal. This traditional kind of jatra performances as well as the performances of the Putul Naach were once very popular to rural folk people but now they are cornered with occasional performances in the remote areas of the countryside in Bengal. But in the nineties when the filmmaker suddenly fix our attention in a painting where we find the non- naturalistic figures of puppets perennially acting the same kind of drama as the painter Ganesh Pyne as well as the huge heterogeneous rural mass audience have been delightfully recorded in their collective psyche since the last century then and then we get the socio-cultural transparency of ethnographic surrealism in cinematic representation.\n\nIf ethnography is the scientific description of human races and surrealism is the artistic revelation of unconsciousness then the mix up of the two in the projection of cinematic images and the e procession of images from the popular mass culture to high art as well as from low culture to high-brow culture of the elite are aesthetically represented in this film. The use of the notes of Indian classical music as well as the effect sounds extend the cross-overing backgrounds of the film helping its cinematic representation to reach the depth and marvel of ethnographic surrealism.\n\nA very different type of film than the film we have just discussed is Dil Se. It is basically an entertainment film. A narrative with fragmented experimental uses of dance sequences sensing the whole film as a non-naturalistic and artistic form of entertainment where unrelated sequences of titillating dance are collaged in the plot of terrorism and love discharging the essence of both seduction and destruction suggesting the current Indian scenario of love, sex and violence.\n\nThe dance sequences of the film are apparently unrelated. But this sequences mould the film into an acceptable presentation of non-naturalistic form of mass entertainment. The seductive dance sequences flicker the repressed desire of the mass audience into cathartic fantasy. This kind of role, we experience in plenty of entertainment films. But the dance sequences of Dil Se help to study a very partial slice of Indian Culture ethnographically. And the use of such dance sequences help to push the film into the domain of non-naturalism if not in pure surrealism. So in the context of ethnographic surrealism I put Dil se chiefly for the three reasons as it is a (a) recently released film, (b) a mainstream film (c) a film belonging to the category of popular culture.\n\nGanesh Pyne and Dil Se are opposite in nature but in both of them we find traces of ethnographic surrealism in different representations. It is interesting for our paper as the two films are contrasting with each other.\n\nApparently all the dance sequences put in this film are bizarre and arbitrary as they are disjointed with the flow of events or plot of the story. For creating a total effect on the spectators through cathartic relief by showing half exposures of titillating sex or sexual suggestions the dance sequences are put together. They take an important role to form the structure of the film as a communicative are form. The disentangled dance sequences also draw enough attention of the spectators en mass.\n\nConsider the first dance sequence with the song cheina.. . Its presentation is absurd. Anyway what it shows is a moving train going up the hill. Passengers are siting on the top of the roof of the train. Very dangerous indeed. And the more dangerously astonishing is a dance by half naked girl at the roof-top among the rocking pahari passengers to all through the dance are moving their bodies in appreciation. It is a slice of ethnic presentation in the postmodern vein. The presentation itself is non-naturalistic enough. Even it may be called a little surrealistic in the broad sense of the structure of the film.\n\nAnother dance-sequence is held at the sea-shore. The director presents a dance by a man and a woman showing various gestures of Khajuraho temple or Kamasutra etc. Their ethnic presentation of slice of Indian life on the middle ages are amalgamated with fashionable modern dress provocative enough to attract numerous spectators for a box office hit. So this kind of postmodern presentation of the union of purush and prakriti and sringar rasa of Indian classical dance along with other such type of dances help shape the film surrealistic in broad sense.\n\nThe other dance is a sort of covered sexual emission. Its form is a little western. A male and female dancer are dancing very closely tying together in a single piece of cloth. They are forming various joint sexual figures totally covering their body with the cloth. The heads and adjoining parts of their bodies are visible only. This dance sequence bears again a kind of surrealistic suggestion. The body posters it form are of Indian origin based on Indian art and culture. Which means an ethnic origin at the beginning. If ethnography is the scientific description of the races of mankind (Hornby, ALDCE, OUP, 1963) and surrealism is the revelation of the unconscious then ethnographic surrealism finds its enough room in various art forms including film. Dil Se touches ethnographic surrealism in such a way - indeed subtly, indirectly and perhaps coincidentally.\n\nSo from our discussion on ethnographic surrealism and film the analysed examples of the two very different types of film Ganesh Pyne and Dil Se show the nature, practice and prospect of ethnographic surrealism in the moving images.\n\nReference :\n\n1. James Clifford, The Predicament of Culture Twentieth Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1988, p. 148.\n\nIndian Cinema and Post Marxism\n\nThe global trends in the interdisciplinary culture, study and praxis in the fields of critical postmodernism, cultural studies and post-Marxism are the primary sources of this paper which focuses on the yielding space of post-Marxism in our culture of the present day and the future and its continuous interaction with film. To present the paper Dr. Arup Ratan Ghosh chooses his examples form Indian film and culture.\n\nThe discourses of Post-Marxism are mobile amalgamation of a few contemporary conceits, notions, theories, and their praxis. Obviously, the space of Post-Marxism consists of society, politics, and culture. Getting a sort of initiation from Neo-Marxism, paralleling with cultural studies conflicting with critical postmodernism post (modern) Marxism goes well globally. In this paper I am going to show the cultural interactions among critical postmodernism, postmodernism and post Marxism reflecting our cinematographic culture.\n\nLet us take an example from Buddhadeb Dasguptas Neem Annapurna (Bitter Morsel, 1979). Based on Kamal Kumar Majumdars story the film narrates a story of an unknown, ordinary poor family dwelling in a slum in Calcutta and how they are lost there within a few years. Originally hailed from a village in Bengal, Braja and Pritilata with their two daughters came in Calcutta for better living. But gradually they face all the interfaces of poverty, misery and implied politics (both global and local). With all these they are lost in the urban maze. Outbreak of famine ruined the whole family. So that Pritilata didnt care to murder her next-room neighbour of the slum an old T.B. patient, for some rice. Her daughter was run over by a lorry and the elder one flew away with someone called Bishu. But the end is interesting. An invisible narrator or the author of the film comments that the flux of peoples coming from village to Calcutta remains uninterrupted. Unrecognised and unknown families of whom the family of Braja is just an example are migrating to the city daily. The film shows close ups and mid shots of a local train where one such family is coming. The film emphasises on their commonness and ordinariness, non-recognition and placeless status in history. With these observations, the neo-Marxist Gramscis observation of the placelessness of ordinary people in the history corresponds. Foucaults notion and practice of histories including his huge research works on the history of madness, sexuality and on prison attract much attention and derive demolishing statements towards traditional history (consisting of the deeds and events of the king, queen, or the powerful rulers or the position-holders) like THE END OF HISTORY, or THE HISTORY HAS COME TO AN END.\n\nBut from this point onwards a discourse on post-Marxism begins drawing inevitably contexts of history and postmodernism. As Kuan Hsing Chen 1 puts it with the trends of cultural studies also. Stuart Hall, a pioneering figure in cultural studies argues that: postmodernism attempts to close off the past by saying that history is finished, therefore you neednt go back to it, and that it signals the end of the world. History stops with us and there is no place to go after this (1986: 47). These charges against postmodernism are unfounded. The historical works of postmodernism precisely deal with reconstituting the past as a field of struggle. With Baudrillard (1987), one might argue that postmodernity denotes excursion into post-history in the sense that that specific Western monolithic thing called History is over and done with. As Iain Chambers (1986: 100) suggests: postmodernism... does suggest the end of a world: a world of Enlightened rationalism and its metaphysical and positive variants... a world that is white, male and Euro-centric. And one might add: what is finished is the official, universal, unified, racist, sexist, imperialist History, from this point on, that History is finished. Thus, the end of History means the beginning of histories: the history of womens struggle, the history of youth culture, the history of prisons, the history of madness, the history of the working class, the history of minorities and the history of the Third World.\n\nIn short, on the level of histories, post-Marxism has to continue this ascending historical project, to write in, and from the point of view of minor discourses, to (re) inscribe forces of antagonism and resistance, to affirm difference while forging possible strategic alliances. More radically, post-Marxist cultural studies ought perhaps sometimes even to become silent, or alternatively, by using already occupied social positions. to open up spaces, so that minor discourses may speak (or not) and be heard. **\n\nSo in the film Neem Annapurna a new type of history with minor discourses are revealed. The tale of an unknown, unrecognised rural Bengali family among many others constitute the history of common peoples struggles, the history of minorities and the history of the Third World. In this way we can trace the course from Neo-Marxism to Post-Marxism in cinema including many Indian films. To begin with we can name Pather Panchali and can continue through many other films of Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen etc. to the contemporary film makers. Everywhere we find this sort of End of History and rewriting of histories, which were neglected so far, in postmodernist or post-Marxist veins beaming with cultural studies.\n\nIdentity  its modern concepts and patterns create another important space for post-Marxism. Identity of women, identity crisis of the Gender issue consisting of the gays, the lesbians, the New Man, the superfemme (Superwoman  who has to take important jobs both in home and outside) etc. The speaking consciousness and awareness of identity under the cool shelter of human rights missions and administrative associations are creating jerks against the disguised dictatorship of democracy or communism all over the world. In 1979 UNO has published a signed treaty by the representatives of the 20 nations to protect childrens rights globally and to make them aware about their potentiality as future operators of the world and of the gaping unjust and obviously of the congenial environment around them. GRIPS theatre movement emerging from Germany with such a social mission of childrens rights and awareness on it has been spreading in many countries of the world including Pakistan and India in different languages like Hindi, Bengali etc. Think of the adapted GRIPS theatre productions like Care Karina or Cordline etc. in Bengali. Bengali film can be thought of in this context. Goopi Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopi Bagha) by Sandip Ray, the son of Satyajit Ray is the film where the protagonist boy makes his identity while hot with the power of truth obliterating the malice network of corruption which severely exploits the children by a black magician. Establishing children with prominent identity are not much available in Indian films. The child in Sonar Kella is to be mentioned in this context. Satyajit Ray images this boy with an exceptional identity drawing everyones attention as the boy tells of his past life.\n\nThe identity of woman in Indian cinema is reflected in various ways both in serious and entertainment films. In popular cinema we have found the Sati Savitri image (Shajan Bina Suhagan, Baba Taraknath etc.), the avenging woman after being exploited by the male (Rani Mera Naam, Zakhmi Aurat, Bandit Queen etc.), and the portrait of woman as commodity (Astha etc.). The proclamation of feminism with different shades of nuances are found in Satyajit Rays Mahanagar, Charulata, Ghare Baire, Ritwik Ghataks Subarnarekha, Meghe Dhaka Tara, Aparna Sens Paroma, Sati, Rituparna Ghoshs Dahan etc. Everywhere the effort of establishing the identity of woman in the dominating milieu of the male are clearly visible. To complete the Gender issue, identity and Indian cinema we must refer Kalpana Lajmis Dormian (The In-between) where the eunuchs ardent search for their identities as human being are shown penetratingly. Similarly, we can mention Fire (1998) by Deepa Mehta on the sufferings of woman in the context of lesbianism.\n\nIn the whirlpool of globalisation the Muslims efforts of keeping their identity prominent are closely envisaged in the different activities of the fundamentalists. Think of some of the writings of Salman Rushdie or Taslima Nasrin and their distressing consequences. So in the contemporary context of identity Post-Marxism begins to work with its political and cultural praxes.\n\nAgain post-Marxism being against the orthodoxy of Marxism everywhere in the world we find including India as well as West Bengal the political revisions and reconstructions after Marxism, the emergence of the New Lefts and the other relevant developments. After the mishap experience of applying the Marxist theories of revolution along with the theories of Lenin and Mao Se Tung we feel even today the existence of some parties and people with ideas of revolution following the post-Marxist consequences. Sunya Theke Suru by Ashok Viswanathan traces this sort of contemporary post-Marxism. There a professor and revolutionary of seventies becomes insane as he was severely tortured in the prison. But he gradually becomes a normal man by the human and nourishing atmosphere at his friends house and last of all by the call of a revolutionary of the nineties seeking for his guidance and assistance.\n\nComing into the main discourse of orthodox Marxism and Post-Marxism Kuan-Hsing observes If Post-Marxism can be understood as (1) the movement beyond orthodox Marxism, (2) as the attempt beyond the notion of Marxism guaranteed by the laws of history, and (3) as the persistent usage of Marxism as ones reference point, then I do not see any essential difference, since three problematics are precisely what postmodernism is engaged with. *\n\nStuart Hall calls himself a post-Marxist but to read his quotation given below we must keep in mind that the post-Marxism of cultural studies is not so different from the post-Marxism of postmodernism.\n\nI am a post-marxist only in the sense that I recognise the necessity to move beyond orthodox Marxism, beyond the notion of marxism guaranteed by the laws of history. But I still operate somewhere within what I understand to be the discursive limits of a marxist position... So, post means, for me, going on thinking on the ground of a set of established problems, a problematic. It doesnt mean deserting that terrain but rather, using it as ones reference point. (Hall, 1986, 58, emphasis added). *\n\nActually in the context of post-Marxism comes in the context of postmodern cultural studies. To feel post-Marxism in our present cultural context we may follow Kuan- Hing Chen and Hebdige. As they observe and cite \n\nToward a postmodern cultural studies seeks them to effect a critical collage of postmodernism and cultural studies, to construct a political synchronizer which will move toward a Marxism or post-Marxism or a post(modern)-Marxism of the 1990s. This is (and there is no better way of saying it) a Marxism that has survived, returning perhaps a little lighter on its feet, (staggering at first), a marxism more prone perhaps to listen, learn, adapt and to appreciate, for instance, that words like emergency and struggle dont just mean fight, conflict, war and death but birthing, the prospect of new life emerging: a struggling to the light. (Hebdige, 1986:97)\n\nTurning to the dark side of the present is the ineluctable direction where the light of a re-articulated post-Marxism of the future may be seen.\n\nSo to deal with the terms of theory, practice and system like, Marxism, post-Marxism, Cultural Studies, Critical postmodernism, and postmodernism we trace some interchanging and shifting qualities within these areas.\n\nCritical postmodernism and its practices are not evident in all over the world except in America, in some of the advanced countries in Europe and in Japan. However there are influences and impact of postmodernism in the other countries of the world. There too we observe postmodernism but a different type of postmodernism. Critical postmodernism in its purest form is absent there. We find a new space for post-Marxism emerging out of cultural studies is created in those countries including India, yielding postmodernism of the West.\n\nAs a deep impact of postmodernism, we find the effect of simulation in our everyday life. The MTV along with some other satellite channels occasionally create a vein of temporal simulacrum in our life. Besides these, the hoardings, the electronic display boards, the theme, and amusement parks,  in a word the aggressive and expanding visual culture in general confuse us to differentiate actuality and simulation. This haziness sustains in our everyday reality. To the Americans Disney Land is hyper-real. Likewise, many people residing out of America consider America itself is hyper-real an dream-like. By the impact of the critical postmodernism, the confusion and fusion between the real and the hyper-real exist. In this terrain of our present time and space, the post-Marxist outlook with Cultural Studies come to introspect the present and the future days of our civilisation.\n\nThe postmodern films as for example Brazil (1985) by Terri Gilliam can be remembered in this context. There we find this kind of confusion between the real and the non-real between the actual and the hyper-real. Time to time we find the main characters of the film fly in the sky with the wide wings of fantasy.\n\nIn film, surrealism is the precursor of such ideas. The revelation of the unconscious as we find in surrealism is evident in many films in their own cinematic way. Buñuel is a good example of that kind of expression. He enters from the real to surreal. Spectators confuse  to sense what moments or messages are real or surreal in his films? In our country, Buddhadeb Dasgupta applies this artistic means for deep expression in his films. We can name Charachar, Lal Darja, Ganesh Pyne in this sequel.\n\nIn these films as well as in many other contemporary Indian films along with experimentation with the cinematic techniques, they present the study of social-political situation to an extent. Pausing a little on this point, from confusion and fusion of reality and hyper-reality, of critical postmodernism and postmodernism in general, of Marxism and Cultural Studies Post-Marxism expands in all the grass root levels of art, culture and life.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Kuan Hsing Chen, Post-Marxism: Critical Postmodernism and Cultural Studies, in Paddy Scannell, Philip Schlesinger and Colin Sparks (eds.), Culture and Power, Sage, London, 1992.\n\n** Angela McRobie, Post-Marxism and Cultural Studies: A Post-script, in Lawrence, Grossberg, C. Nordic, Dr. Trycheri (eds.), Cultural Studies, Routledge, 1992.\n\nUtilitarianism and Film\n\nIn this paper, Dr. Arup Ratan Ghosh traces Utilitarianism as a basic cultural theory, which fits itself well in the Film Theory of the day. He considers Gudia and Astha  the two recent films in this context from various social, economic and aesthetic point of views.\n\nUtilitarianism is an important concept in cultural theory specially if we look back upon its course of development. Utilitarianism re-echoes Hedonism, Liberalism to an extent and it emphasises more on the values of selling or saleability of products or anything material or immaterial under the sun. Think of cultural products as for example popular entertainment films etc. to feel close with the concept.\n\nThe desire for doing things freely and solely for happiness and pleasure without ever having any kind of pain is reflected in such kind of films. In both ways of communications, the entertainment cinema practices such hedonistic activities. To be precise think of Hindi entertainment films. In generally there the heroes and the heroines fly freely for hedonistic pleasures with the mass spectators. Subsequently the posters and the gossip film magazines including the entertainment pages of the newspapers containing various kinds of saucy presentations of gossips and scandals related to the personal affairs of the film stars and models help the voyeurs of the hedonistic film-pleasures to consume the commercial fruits of pleasure or hedonism or utilitarianism in another way. Popular entertainment cinema packages itself as a consumable or saleable product and the process of selling and buying and the concept of saleability is pivotally settled in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism encompasses the world with the belief that everything is saleable in this world. Not only in cinema but also in our day-to-day life of the world of our time we experience such a globally spread attitude to life be it categorically under the name of utilitarianism or not.\n\nNow in the present time, of late Capitalism the economics of film industry intricately merges with the other kinds of entertainment businesses. Just take a glance on some of the past and present events. Aisharya Rai and Sushmita Sen appeared in some entertainment films like Jeans, Gupt, Dastak etc. or think of the last supper served in the ship Titanic in 1934 is now being served in a hotel in Delhi. The advertising boosted by the film stars or the introduction of new fashions indirectly by them as they wear the dresses while acting in the films. Music industry gets a great support from the film industry especially in our country as well as in the other countries too, by releasing music cassettes and CDs of film songs. Sometimes we find music cassettes and film songs help each other for gaining popularity and cash. Think of dam maro dam...and other songs in Hare Ram Hare Krishna or the film Qyamat Se Qyamat Tak and its melodious lyrics. Many other examples may be given in this context.\n\nBelieve in saleability. Consider anything as sellable be it a material thing or human values. Consumerism of the present day promotes these beliefs, values, and cultures. Utilitarianism makes its foundation profound.\n\nTo trace the thematic presentation of Utilitarianism/Consumerism we find the two recent films like Astha (1996) by Basu Bhattacharya and Gudia (1997) by Goutam Ghose\n\nIn Astha it is shown that everything from a pair of fancy shoes to a housewife of a professor are consumable and available for sale. Actually there is an invisible trap laid all over the world which engulfs with the assistance of market economy, all the human values into consumerism perverting chastity, honesty, sincerity etc.\n\nIn Gudia last of all Utilitarianism/Consumerism yields perversion out of sexual repression en mass in our present day society. Public taste changes from appreciating Fine Arts (Actually a traditional form of folk entertainment-that is performing ventriloquism with a talking doll) to vulgar art, from High Art to Pornography. The film Gudia states implicitly all about these under the invisible veneer of Consumerism/Utilitarianism which sales and buys and sales again and again and go on in this way upto the infinity of our postmodern time and space.\n\nAgainst Utilitarianism is Culturalism  a profound concept in Cultural Theory, which places human values, cultural values, and aesthetic expressions in the front rank and also lifts them above all other things. In our special context of Film Studies right now we can think of the Art Films or the serious and good films, which communicate us with their inherent and original flavour of Culturalism. Culturalism primarily starts in England and in Germany. It gets institutionalised support with the rise of English Studies in the late 19th century and in the 20th but that is a different context.\n\nLacanian Interpretation of Gudia\n\nIn this paper Dr Arup Ratan Ghosh explores Goutam Ghoses feature film Gudia (1997) after Lacanian psychoanalysis following the concepts like Mirror Stage, the Other etc. cultural theories of psychoanalysis basically without Freud are taken here to read a significant contemporary Indian film.\n\nJohn (Mithun Chakraborty) speaks with his favourite talking doll (Gudia). He naturally questions in his male voice but the doll answers in female voice. They chat, make fun. The audience laugh roaringly. They clap for the perfect presentation of ventriloquism, for the beauty of the doll and for her intelligent and coquettish dialogue. Within a moment, Johns male voice becomes the female voice of Urbashi. The Other is presented and replaced simultaneously. The audience feel themselves like children. They cant understand or do not like to understand these two types of vocal interchanges which actually are just coming out reflecting the same persons mind bifurcating into two bio-sociological flows.\n\nMirror Stage and Lacanian Reading\n\nAs the French psychiatrist Jacques Lacan (1909  1981) holds that upto six months of age a child holds a mirror stage like mental condition. During six months to eighteen months of age he gradually learns to know the differences between him and the other things surrounded by him. Gradually his mind becomes capable to encode things following the course from the imaginary to the symbolic. He finds the suggestions and presence of the Other in the objects surrounded by him. He feels himself as if he is surround by mirrors. Lacan mentions this stage of a child as mirror stage. At the first imaginary and the symbolic exist in a mixed state. Afterwards the symbolic gradually becomes clearer and gives a sense of differentiation to him. The child finds his own self has been scattered here and there splitting strangely enough into the symbols all over the world forming his the Other.\n\nKeeping the concept of Mirror Stage at the base the introduction of Lacanian Reading has started. Likewise film can also be analysed and synthesised after Lacanian Reading or Interpretation. To find out the Other of something or someone there is no need of getting a real mirror. Instead one has to broadly generalise something like a mirror. Goutam Ghoses film Gudia (1997) made after Mahasweta Devis story Jony O Urbashi appears to me as such a type of hall of mirrors full of reflections.\n\nIn the Reflection of the Narration\n\nGoa is the place or backdrop where the events of the film take place. The time is about the early eighties. So we find John singing a popular song of that period calling I am a disco- dancer... in his talking doll show. In the beginning John is seemed to have rehearsal from his guru. He practices the art of singing in a female voice as well as the skills of ventriloquism. John gets Urbashi as a lucrative gift from his guru. He gives him the doll, as his voice has become ineffective due to prolong use of voice for ventriloquism. He becomes ill. He observes Johns show sitting at a distance. He feels hurt while John sings I am a disco dancer... moving his body with a guitar occasionally in between his dialogue with the doll only for gaining cheap popularity of the traditional art form. Even the audience is seemed to relish this use of the song and dance. John loves the doll very dearly. He considers her as his bonne vivante companion. He occasionally speaks with her at her home. Apparently it is seemed as if he is practising ventriloquism. Again sometimes it senses us as if Johns talking with Urbashi is his repressed desire of uttering the monologue what he can not pronounce in the real life due to some social pressures. It is Urbashi who is speaking on behalf of him being his the Other  in all the shows of the talking girls.\n\nOn the other hand a beautiful teenage girl Rosemary (acted by Nandana Sen  the daughter of Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate) becomes intimate with John; takes him as a little girl but she falls in love with him. She always accompanies John in all the shows of the talking dolls. But she can not tolerate Johns limitless love or addiction for the doll or considering the doll as his most favourite ladylove. John doesnt bother about it. Time to time he converses with her as if they are husband and wife. It senses us that it is not simply a habitual practice of ventriloquism but a process in which John really enjoys himself as he can actually able to reflect and change his I temporally. This practice of Johns talking with I and I goes so far that when someone comes to"
