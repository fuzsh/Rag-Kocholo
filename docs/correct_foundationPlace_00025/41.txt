How Was Livonia Community Foundation Started?

In an effort to enrich local communities, the state of Michigan encouraged the creation of an organization that could provide tax incentives to individuals and businesses. Out of this goal, the Livonia Community Foundation was created as an effort to enrich the community and help people looking for grants.

Since their start in 1995, this organization has since managed to raise over $1 million. Each year, more and more people contribute to this organization to help improve and enrich the lives of those around them. Today, this foundation includes over 750 Livonia families, individuals, and businesses.
