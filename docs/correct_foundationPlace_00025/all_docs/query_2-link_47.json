        "text": "My favorite book this year was definitely Farilane by Michael J. Sullivan. It reads fine as a stand alone, but also reads really well as a part of the series at large.\n\nI definitely agree that Hail Mary was better than The Martian, and I almost felt guilty thinking it. I'm glad I'm not the only one.\n\nQuoting ,\n\nThis thread is dedicated to recommending a book you read in the past year. One book (per comment anyway).\n\nHere is my 2022 recommendation: Hail Mary by Andy Weir. I really enjoyed his other books such as The Martian and actually liked this one better. Would make a terrific movie as well.\n\nis this the one about sun dimming and whatnot? If yes, it was recommended and “borrowed” in its e-versionto me by a friend. Still yet to start reading, but what he told me about it, it did sound truly exciting.\n\nLast year, i only read 2 books, the final Expanse book and then “Redemption of Time”, which is fan-fiction addition to the Three Body series made official. I could recommend both, but it does not make sense to read either, unless you read everything that predates them.\n\nAnyway, if i was looking for something new scifish to read, i would check the utube channel called Quinns ideas. The guy talks and reviews lot of this kind of books, lately he made me quite excited about a book called Off Armageddons Reef by David Weber, wanted to get it for Christmas, but sadly there is no translation from english to my language(s)\n\nOk. I just finished book 10 of Safehold. I...am not happy. First, it doesn't progress very far. Second, the books become quite a slog. Third, it's been 4 years since the last book was written so who knows how many years it'll take just to get Safehold back to to space since they're still basically preindustrial.\n\nI really liked the first couple books and they indeed got me hooked enough that I was able to pull myself away from working for a few days on the Stardock Summer vacation at least (10 books in a week is a significant commitment in time).\n\nI need a new series.\n\nQuoting Frogboy,\n\nI really liked the first couple books and they indeed got me hooked enough that I was able to pull myself away from working for a few days on the Stardock Summer vacation at least (10 books in a week is a significant commitment in time).\n\nI need a new series.\n\nThis happens a lot with series now days.\n\nTied to the fact the writers get paid by the word and many should have been a stand alone book, have not read the Safehold so do not know if this fits with them I am talking in general.\n\nOne of the worst at this is Harry Turtledove.\n\nMost if not all his books are excellent, till he writes a sequel, everyone goes downhill from there.\n\nAdd the fact he has to add word after word to fill out the pages.\n\nI quit reading him the 3,250th time that he told us that Odin Cursed sailor sun-burned if he was outside for more than 3 minutes.\n\nCannot really suggest recent books for you not knowing your tastes that well.\n\nA few old ones that are good are H.Beam Piper's \"Fuzzy\" and its follow-ups' and the Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen.\n\nYou've likely read the Weber/White Starfire books based on the old board game. If not they are good SF based on the Starfire Board game.\n\nWould not mind beta/ moderating that one for a certain game company.\n\nPlease no spoilers Frogboy? I am not sure if I am finished #8 in the safehold series yet and now that I know exactly what happens in the next book (i.e. nothing spacey) I don't think I will bother. I was enjoying them even at the glacial pace they were progressing. I am sure you did not mean it, but spoilers even from a few words that any reasonable person can work out things from I generally avoid. Bascially I avoid anything that tells people what happens in the future of a series past the point they may already be at. General ideas are better.\n\nI finished reading Daniel Dalzelles Warship series and really enjoyed them thanks.\n\nI have read some of the honor harrington series as well but even though I liked the tone felt I was better off reading age of sail novels like master and commander, hornblower or even the autobiography of a seaman by thomas cochrane.\n\nQuoting The-Reaper-Man,\n\nQuoting Norska,\n\nSounds like you are talking about David Weber’s Safehold series which is very good. I have read about 8 of them iirc.\n\nI'm a huge fan of David Weber and epic length novels in general. I read every book in the Safehold series and a new installment is long overdue. I also read every book in his Honorverse series, which is over 20 books long and enjoyed those immensely. The series is basically Horatio Hornblower in space. The main protagonist, Honor Harrington, even has the same initials.\n\nSince i could not get Off Armaggedons Reef last year, i settled for another book from David Weber, random one there was being sold translated to local language, so i thought why not.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be a mistake, as the book is part of the Honorverse series, as i later found out, however its one of the books from its spin-off sub-series, and not even the first one in there. Its called Storm from Shadow or something along the line, dont remeber the exact english name.\n\nI tried my best to read it, but seems i miss lot of background not reading the previous books. And unfortunately, while i thought a book about interstellar politics and space combat would be right down my alley, it turns out its really not i guess. Maybe its the style of the author, but it seems to focus way too much on details of everything, minutae of said combat, extremely sophisticated dialogues, etc.. i dont know. Expanse i found way easier to read.\n\nAnyway, just today my brother asked me what book i want for Christmas this year, so i checked the store and decided for Revelation Space by Alastair Reynolds. This time around, the first book in said series. Hopefully i am going to like it."
