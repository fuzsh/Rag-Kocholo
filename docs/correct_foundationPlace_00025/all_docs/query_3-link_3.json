Enrollment is due by February 1, 2024. In this free program, which was established in 2008, the Foundation designates enrolled students as beneficiaries of an educational savings account. The Foundation contributes seed money and those funds grow throughout the student’s LPS educational career. The Foundation manages this account and the parent(s) do not have to do anything beyond enrollment into the program. Upon graduation from an LPS high school, the student will receive information in their graduation packet about how to apply for the funds which may be used for any accredited post-secondary education or skills training program. This year, the Foundation is increasing the seed money to $125 per student!\n\nPlease use the link below to fill out the quick form to enroll your current kindergarten student before the deadline passes.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/CompEdgeSignUp\n\nIf you would like more information about the program, please visit the Foundation’s website: https://lpsfoundation.org/competitive-edge/\n\nDo not miss out on this free opportunity to start saving money for your child’s post secondary education! The deadline is February 1, 2024."
