        "text": "The Livonia Police Department is currently offering a Parental Evaluation Resource Kit (P.E.R.K.) to all families who currently live in the City of Livonia, or families who have children attending school in the City of Livonia. This P.E.R.K. is designed to assist Livonia parents who don’t know where to turn when their children begin to show signs of a problem. P.E.R.K. offers a large amount of information and convenient drug and alcohol test that provides immediate results in the privacy and safety of the home. In the event of a positive result, P.E.R.K. directs parents to appropriate community resources WITHOUT law enforcement intervention. The program empowers parents and gives them the ability to monitor their children in the privacy of their own home. We are providing this service as a tool for parents to start an open discussion with their children about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse and to help parents deal with the issues that can interfere with being a healthy student. While the use of this kit can be an effective method to determine whether a child is engaging in substance abuse or has an un-diagnosed behavioral problem, professional counseling by qualified, licensed professionals may be the best course of action to take. P.E.R.K. is simply a “pro-active” program designed to assist parents when their child is beginning to show signs of a problem. It’s another resource the Livonia Police Department is offering our community in our mission to serve and protect. Parents can obtain a P.E.R.K. at the Livonia Police Department Investigative Bureau desk, Monday through Friday from 8:00am to 4 :00pm. Please call the Crime Prevention Unit at (734) 466-2318 for more information.\n\nWith the 4th of July holiday approaching, the Livonia Police Department would like to remind residents of the laws pertaining to the use of fireworks this week. 🔹 Fireworks are only permitted between 𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐝𝐚𝐲, 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 𝟐𝟗 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐲, 𝐉𝐮𝐥𝐲 𝟓, 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝟏𝟏:𝟎𝟎 𝐀.𝐌. 𝐭𝐨 𝟏𝟏:𝟒𝟓 𝐏.𝐌. 🔹 Residents shall not ignite, discharge, or use fireworks on public property, school property, church property, or the property of another person without that organization's or person's express permission to use those fireworks on those premises. 🔹 Residents are asked to be considerate of their neighbors when using any fireworks. Always think safety first and take precautions to avoid injuries, fires, or damage to property. We wish everyone a happy and safe 4th of July!\n\nWe would like to thank Ram Construction Services for their incredible generosity and support in hosting a special appreciation event for our officers where they provided a Taco Truck to feed our hardworking team. We also want to give a big shout out to The Torta Express Food Truck for serving up the delicious tacos! Ram Construction Services, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership. We couldn't do our job without the backing of our amazing community. Thank you for standing with us and for recognizing the dedication and hard work of our officers.\n\nWith our largest turnout of kids yet, the 25th annual Passport to Safety event was a huge success! Thank you to everyone who attended. The event was very successful with thousands of attendees and great weather. Our youngest citizens learned all about safety, while also having fun! We would like to thank all of our volunteers and sponsors for making this event possible. Check back in early 2025 for an update on next year’s Passport to Safety. We hope to see you there!"
