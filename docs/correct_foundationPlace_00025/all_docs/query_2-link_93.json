In comparison, there are a few things missing in GC3. 1. The game doesnt feel like space. its a hex-based 2d map with funny symbols. I just don't get the feeling of star systems, planets, etc. So the galaxy is 2 dimensional? 2. I can't drag and drop ships between different fleets even when they are in the same tile? 3.",
