        "text": "We are proud to announce our 2023 Sky Grant recipients. The process to achieve these awards is rigorous. The applications submitted for this cycle nearly doubled. Our esteemed Sky Scientific Advisory Committee makes the final recommendations to the Sky Governing Board for approval.\n\nThe following are three $50,000 grant recipients for 2023\n\nPOSTDOCTORAL/NON-TENURE TRACK CATEGORY:\n\nDespoina Kalfakakou, PhD | New York University Langone Health\n\nResearch Title: Therapeutic impact of clonal heterogeneity of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma\n\nLisa Miller-Phillips, MD | University of California San Francisco\n\nResearch Title: Histological and transcriptional characterization of organotropism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with focus on the “Lung Only” metastatic variant\n\nPRE-TENURED CATEGORY:\n\nNina Steele, PhD | Henry Ford Health\n\nResearch Title: Immune suppression and racial disparities in pancreatic cancer progression\n\nSKY’S MISSION\n\nSky Foundation awards seed-money grants to scientists and clinicians from coast to coast who are pursuing research of great promise in the areas of early detection, prevention or treatment of pancreatic cancer. This start-up funding helps researchers get to the point in their work where they can successfully attract financial support from the National Institutes of Health and other national funding sources, and ultimately, be able to make a positive impact on the outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nSince its inception, Sky Foundation has funded over one million dollars in seed fund grants. Every year our researchers update us on the progress and their hope for the future.\n\nSKY’S IMPACT FIGHTING PANCREATIC CANCER\n\n“We are all so indebted for the work done by SKY Foundation in the last decade. I have been a beneficiary of SKY Foundation seed funds. I was supported by Sheila during the time when I was establishing my laboratory. I owe a lot of my success to Sheila and SKY Foundation. These seed funds allowed the generation of critical preliminary data and helped my research team secure more than $2.4 million in federal grants. The help from SKY foundation is integral to the success of the research.” – Asfar Sohail Azmi, PhD\n\n“The support of the Sky Foundation has been fundamental because it provided the financial resources to carry out our studies. Most importantly, our focus and efforts were inspired by the unwavering dedication and commitment of Sheila Kasselman, who we truly admired for her relentless fight against pancreatic cancer. Sheila was the driving force behind our science and our mission to make a difference as she did, and for this she will live forever in our hearts.” – Rafael Fridman, PhD\n\n“My team and I are extremely grateful for Sky Foundation to fund this promising study, which allowed us to use state-of-the-art technologies to discover these novel findings, the fundamentals for making substantial progress in pancreatic cancer research.” – Simone Benitz, PhD\n\n“We are extremely grateful for the support of Sky Foundation. Sky Foundation’s support of a postdoctoral fellow allowed us to do these studies, which will inform future pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We look forward to continued partnership with the foundation to advance discoveries in the laboratory to help patients.” – Ben Z. Stanger, MD, PhD\n\nThe future to eradicate pancreatic cancer is promising and hopeful. These experts are conducting innovative research to increase the survival rate of pancreatic cancer from 12% to, one day, 100%. We are making a difference because of your generous donations. Thank you for your support. Let’s continue to invest in the future.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute is a reliable source for basic information about pancreatic cancer and treatment. It is an excellent place to begin your research on the disease.\n\nYou can find information on the National Cancer Institute’s website, cancer.org.\n\nCancer Types – Pancreatic Cancer gives specific information on pancreatic cancer, including a overview of the disease, treatment options, a listing of drug and clinical trials as well as details on causes and prevention, screening protocols, and resources for coping with the disease.\n\nThere are two major types of pancreatic cancer; Adenocarcinoma (95% of the cases) & Neuroendocrine (5% of cases).\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is an agency of the federal government that was created by Congress in 1937. It conducts, coordinates and promotes research on the causes, diagnoses, treatment and prevention of cancer. It funds research at leading public and private institutions and draws expertise from researchers in the United States and abroad.\n\nLEARN ABOUT SYMPTOMS AND RISK FACTORS\n\nFinding a doctor\n\nBecause we are located in southeast Michigan, we are well acquainted with a number of leading health providers that serve patients in the region and beyond. We recommend the Henry Ford Health, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and the University of Michigan. For help identifying doctors elsewhere, you may wish to turn to:\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology, an association of 40,000 cancer doctors in the United States, maintains the website cancer.net.\n\nThis website has detailed information on pancreatic cancer overall and will help you locate a doctor in your area.\n\nIn addition, it provides an in-depth list of questions to ask when you meet with your doctor. That information can be found on the page, Pancreatic Cancer: Questions to ask the doctor and includes the following:\n\nQuestions to ask after getting a diagnosis\n\nQuestions to ask about choosing a treatment and managing side effects\n\nQuestions to ask about having surgery\n\nQuestions to ask about having radiation therapy\n\nQuestions to ask about have chemotherapy\n\nQuestions to ask about planning for follow up\n\nIdentifying an advocate\n\nWe urge all patients to identify an advocate who can help ask questions and process the answers. This is an overwhelming situation and another listener can be critical to capturing the information every patient and family needs. Choose a family member or friend who can go to appointments, take notes and recounts conversations with doctors.\n\nThe Sky Foundation offers the information above to help you navigate the health care system and find the doctor, treatment and support you need as you battle the disease. This is by no means a complete list; we offer it with the hope that it may be useful to you or your loved ones. Our mission is to raise awareness and fund medical research for the early detection, prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nFinancial support for medical research\n\nDonations are made to Sky Foundation and awarded as grants to scientists and clinicians who have submitted proposals to us and have been reviewed and recommended for funding by our Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\nWe award seed-money grants – initial grants starting at $50,000 – to provide the essential funds needed by researchers to develop their projects to the point where they can compete and secure major funding from the National Institutes of Health and other national funding sources.\n\nDonations may be made in honor of or in memory of a loved one or friend. Large or small, the donations we receive are necessary and contribute to our research efforts.\n\nIf you are interested in making a planned gift (a gift of appreciated stock or a mutual fund) please call Sky Foundation at 248.385.5143 or email us at EKasselman@SkyFoundationInc.org\n\nAttend an event\n\nWe host three major events a year, in the spring, summer and fall. All fundraisers are designed to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, the risk factors, the importance of genetic counseling, and updates from researchers working on the early detection, prevention and treatment of the disease. Proceeds from the events become seed-money grants to advance promising research.\n\nCommittee Involvement\n\nVolunteering your time is another way to advance the mission of Sky Foundation. The Fundraising Committee meet virtually, to build a relationship with each other and to plan events throughout the year. To learn more, contact Annie Dalton at ADalton@skyfoundationinc.org; or call 248-385-5143\n\nSponsor special events\n\nPartner with Sky for one of our yearly fundraisers: Women’s Event, Autumn Stroll or Annual Celebration. Contact Annie (ADalton@SkyFoundationInc.org) for more information.\n\nCompanies frequently have matching gift opportunities – consider submitting a Matching Gift request and double your donation.\n\nContact Person for Matching Gifts at Sky Foundation:\n\nAnnie Dalton, ADalton@SkyFoundationInc.org, 248-385-5143\n\nSpread the word to raise awareness\n\nKnowing the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer can save a life. Getting out in the community and participating in awareness events is a great way to get involved. These are some ways you can help spread awareness for Sky with pancreatic cancer information:\n\nBecome a Team Leader for our Sky Movement\n\nJoin one of our committees\n\nTake a shift at our Sky Foundation Booth at the Ann Arbor Art Fair"
