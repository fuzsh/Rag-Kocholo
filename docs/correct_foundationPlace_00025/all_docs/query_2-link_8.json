        "text": "At the end of each year, I open the PowerPoint I created for my team at the start of the year to reflect on what we hoped to accomplish vs what we achieved – here’s what we accomplished in my second year leading Stardock Software. In 2023, we shipped products with a faster cadence, increased our partnership outreach, and most importantly, transitioned a core part of the software business from single transaction to subscription. Scoping, modeling, and scenario evaluation for moving to a business model supported by annual reoccurring revenue underscored much of the work in the first half of ’23. I could probably write a book on what we have learned in the first year of this transition but happy to say that our transaction flow is within the bounds of the modeling that we outlined. Start11 v2 and Fences 5 releases this year were significant for several reasons – the primary being that we have enabled new deployment experiences for both products. With Start11 + Fences 5, you can now deploy standardized desktops to all Windows-based desktops to create a common experience for your users. This has been the winning formula and with the updates we shipped this year; it’s now possible to deploy a configuration that loads on login, based on the account (local or cloud), so that the user sees the same desktop on any endpoint. This scenario is what we do better than anyone else and we are seeing a lot of momentum in healthcare and other industries where time-based billing is a core metric. As an example, we have healthcare systems that will deploy a standardized desktop based on the doctor who is logging into an endpoint – if it’s a radiologist, they will see only the apps specific to their role and they will always be in the same location on the desktop. Further, we can lock the desktop area and Start menu so that end-users cannot manipulate the layouts; this has proven to be a core experience for retail environments and allows our clients to easily deploy kiosk-like functionality with no virtualization required. Along with shipping faster across our portfolio, working with partners to expand the reach of our products increased significantly in ’23. Stardock products are now available in more than a dozen marketplaces with a focus on China, Japan, and Korea in '23. With more than 1000 affiliates, we will help our partners unlock new opportunities in '24. From an outsider’s perspective, our software may not look like an enterprise brand, but with thousands of companies running our software daily and more expected to deploy in the year ahead with our new tooling, that’s about to change. And that’s the challenge I look forward to the most. The first year was about understanding the business, the second was about building the foundation for transformation, and the third year will be about improving and expanding our market positioning for enterprise clients. Here’s to a happy, healthy, and prosperous 2024."
