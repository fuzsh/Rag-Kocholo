        "text": "Hello, you should consider posting over on the Steam forums. There is a small group of people over there talking about how this store switch is a good thing because of the revenue split, not understanding the difference in total revenue between the two stores, and at the same time also saying it’s great, because steam is a monopoly all while not understanding what a monopoly is lol. A monopoly being a majority of the total revenue in a market, with effort and funds being put toward making an unfavorable environment for competition. If the majority market is due to having the best product, distribution, or marketing then it’s just good business and or no viable or quality competitor which is also a sign of good business foresight. Personally I dislike needing to use multiple platform clients, however my bigger concern is with EGS directly, my concerns being lack of functionality, features, customer support, terms of service, accusations of spyware imbedded in the client, and finally tencent purchasing 45% of the company! Anyone who has done a lick of research knows that tencent is a CCP operation. Tencent in addition to just being a terrible company for customers and gamers in particular is also a privacy threat, anticompetitive, and does not honor international copyright law. What happens if they are able to obtain the majority interest in EGS?\n\nRegarding Storming Kiwi's concern, much of this hinges on how you believe people make purchasing decisions. Do they (1) See a game at a store and then buy the game only because it's at the store they like, (2) See a game they have never heard of at a store they like, investigate the game, and then buy it if it looks interesting, or (3) Learn about a game, decide they want it, and then go to the store selling it to buy it?\n\nI'm not a computer game marketing expert, but my guess is that most people learn of interesting games through channels other than game stores and become interested in it that way, so I think (3) is the primary vehicle that drives sales. However, option (2) which has a marketing component is also important. Presumably option (2) will be covered when the game shows up on the Steam store with some fresh marketing.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer to purchase the game over Steam, and ironically wanting to purchase Rebellion is how I ended up on the Steam platform in the first place. However, I'll probably purchase the game early access at Epic. I already have Epic's platform installed and have obtained a large catalog of free games from them.\n\nI'm not upset about the game being an Epic exclusive for the time being; I understand the reasons for it. It's probably best for us fans to be thankful that Epic Games made this possible (if that is indeed the case) and that a Sins-2 is being produced at all and focus on how we can help the Devs make Sins-2 a better game and how we can get other 4X and RTS players interested in it.\n\nQuoting TerribleNate,\n\nmy bigger concern is with EGS directly, my concerns being...accusations of spyware imbedded in the client\n\nI don't know how true any of that is, but built-in spyware (and unnecessary bloatware) is my biggest concern.\n\nI ended up getting the Epic platform initially for the game Unreal Tournament 4 which ended up unfinished when the Devs left to make a fortune creating Fortnite Battle Royale. I played Fortnite some and also three other free games (Killing Floor 2, Antstream Arcade, and Civilization 6) via the Epic Games Store (EGS). Personally I'm OK with it.\n\nMy biggest concern regarding Sins 2 and EGS is whether Sins functionality will be tied to EGS in any sort of a way. Ideally, I would purchase Sins and never have to think about EGS again though I'm guessing it will be necessary to launch EGS every time I want to play Sins so that it can check for updates. As long as mods, custom maps, and online multiplayer have no connection to it or any other platform I'll probably be happy, though I would prefer to do it through Steam.\n\nI certainly have issues with Tencent, which will always make me hesitant towards EGS. However, it is their business model that made me stop buying from that store (I bought Satisfactory and a few others earlier on). Now I refuse to use it at all. They made a bad product and are forcing people to use it with their exclusive deals. Their revenue split...great. Funding game dev...great. Forcing exclusivity so that I can't play the games I want using the platform I want...meh. I'm fine with UPlay, they let me link to Steam library and put the games they make on their store. I was even fine with Origin since that was only EA games. EGS is just throwing around their Fortnite money to try and buy their way into the marketplace. I can't stand that (also I'm one of the of people mad they cancelled Paragon because of Fortnite...their are dozens of us...dozens!). Steam isn't a monopoly. They made a good product that people use by choice. EGS is attempting to make a monopoly, their store just sucks so much that they can't even buy their way to the top. All of that said, if Stardock wants to make their game on EGS that is their decision. I'm just hoping SINS 2 makes its way to Steam so I can actually play it, cause I'm 100% out if its EGS."
