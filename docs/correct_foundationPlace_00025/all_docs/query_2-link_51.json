Namely that icons appear through the surface of other programs. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2860365529 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2246337487 According to the statement in the related product forums here on Steam, the error was fixed, but that was a lie. There were some discussions about this to which I got some cheeky answers from your support.",
