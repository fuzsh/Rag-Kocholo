        "text": "There’s been a lot of discussion on these kinds of topics on recent games and I thought I’d give you our perspective on it.\n\nNo Copy Protection\n\nElemental, out of the box, like all of Stardock’s other games, has no copy protection whatsoever. However, you obviously need Internet access to get updates. But then, why should this be necessary?\n\nBecause Elemental, unlike our previous games, has really been designed to be a game that people can play for decades, this is something that has concerned us. Because we want to encourage people to have the latest version but at the same time, we are aware that some people are worried that 10 years from now, they won’t be able to get the “better” version.\n\nSo here is what we’re going to start doing on our developed titles: We’re going to start making archival DVD versions of the game that can be sent to customers. We already do this with Object Desktop (our most popular non-game product). This archival version would have no copy protection whatsoever. It would just be a DVD you can put into your machine.\n\nSo starting in October, what we will do is make archival DVD editions of our games starting with Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition and Elemental. Roughly every year or so, if there have been updates, we’ll create a new archival version of the game that people can have sent to them (it’ll just be a DVD).\n\nLAN Games\n\nThere’s been a lot of questions of how someone would play Elemental on their LAN with their friends. Here’s my suggested way to do it with minimum hassle.\n\n#1 You’ll need to install Impulse on the machines that will be playing the game. But that’s all. Just install and go to step 2.\n\n#2 Go to http://anywhere.impulsedriven.com which is the web interface to Impulse. From here, you would download the web package of Elemental. As long as Impulse is installed on the machine, you can install the game.\n\n#3 When you install, type in your serial #. If it’s on a LAN, just use your single DVD key, Impulse::Reactor’s GOO uses smart activation (i.e. it doesn’t have a “activation limit” type system) so you can just install it on the various machines on your LAN.\n\n#4 When your friends come over to play, they will need, once in the game, to logon with their own accounts (so they or someone will have to provide them with a serial # to attach to their account but they can use it at your LAN in game). This is because on day 0, the data from the game is handled by our servers (this way, when we update the game data for balancing players don’t have to update their game which would be a real hassle for LAN players). Eventually we plan to release custom servers so that players can make their own stuff but we won’t have that ready at release.\n\nReply #195 August 16, 2010 1:44:49 PM\n\nfrom Elemental Forums\n\nQuoting Murteas,\n\nJust because this was mentioned in a beta topic, doesn't mean it was promised for the final game. I think people are being intentionally difficult for no reason. Those that want true LAN only play (no internet) will have to wait until custom servers come out.\n\nPeople were expecting a feature, and that feature is missing. They voiced their displeasure. It got \"difficult\" when the thread turned into talking about piracy and how it's a SP focused game. But hey, it does have multiplayer, and that offering is missing stuff it shouldn't be (both LAN and modding).\n\nAnd I'd say it does count, since Brad is the authority on the game. He talked specifically about custom server support because it's required for modding in MP, and also for LAN play. Modding is a core feature of this game, it's entirely reasonable to expect it to work in all areas of the game at release. It doesn't. That got buried by the LAN issue, but it's another symptom of the same problem. Since most of the information about the game has come from his journals, how do we tell which ones \"count\" and which ones don't?\n\nPaying customers who want those features are entirely within their rights to bring it up.\n\nHonestly, that is a good business decision on Stardock's part. This is primarily a SP game, no matter how vocal/obnoxious the MP minority is. It would be dumb for them to sacrifice SP features (AI, monsters, quests, etc) for LAN support which by most posters admission they want so they can have multiple non-paying people play at the same time.\n\nThere was actually one guy who said that, the rest of the piracy talk was actually from Brad. What SP features have to be sacrificed in order to make the promised modding features in the game also work in MP? None. There's no conflict here in features, except they ran out of time and the MP area didn't get finished.\n\nCome on folks, we all know that Stardock and Brad in particular are uniquely understanding and giving to their customers. There is no reason not to support them. Sure, if you want something than ask for it, give your arguments, but don't be intentionally obnoxious or rude just because its a forum.\n\nGoing back to the first couple of pages, I don't see a whole lot of obnoxious or rude from the people talking about lack of LAN play. I do see people trying to redefine what \"LAN support\" means, other people dismissing the whole thing as unimportant to a SP focused game, and Brad giving some non-answers about the LAN issue (followed by flippant remarks about piracy farther in).\n\nReply #197 August 16, 2010 2:11:12 PM\n\nfrom Elemental Forums\n\nTridus,\n\nI think that ultimately the issue comes down to this: Stardock decided to put LAN support (i.e. Custom Servers) on the list for post-release. They did that so that they could finish other things that they deemed more important.\n\nYou feel that any MP game should not only have internet games avaialble but also complete modding and Lan Support at release time or it is unfinished from a MP perspective.\n\nI disagree that for the game to be complete it needs those features. That you took Brad's comments as a promise is unfortunate, and is probably the reason most developers don't comment on forums. Just because Brad said he wanted those features and they were initially planned doesn't mean that they were guaranteed to be in. The same can be said for continuous turns, just because they were said to be in, and then were taken out doesn't mean that I am not getting what was promised.\n\nBottomline: Stardock didn't intentionally mislead you. They want to provide custom servers still, they didn't make it for the release version. LAN play with a single copy is not an option in this game, and is not the best business decision anyway.\n\nThe point of the thread is: \"Hey you can get the game set up on your internal network that is connected to the internet before your friends come over to play. Here's how you do it... BTW you will each need a unique serial to play on the Stardock servers you are connecting to.\" The point was never to say this is how you set up a LAN only game or if/when the game will support 15 players playing 1 copy of the game on a non-connect LAN with 15 mods running on a custom server.\n\nI respect that you are disappointed, and I don't have any problem with you posting to ask for more LAN support, but I do have a problem with the feeling of entitlement people have. You pre-ordered a game that could have changed wildly before release, it could be a FPS and you took the risk by pre-ordering that you were going to get whatever they produced whether you liked it or not. If you felt that a certain feature was critical to your happiness then you shouldn't have ordered until after the fact. That you feel mislead doesn't mean that you were."
