        "text": "Ever since Windows 11 debuted in 2021, I've been using an app that has made the Start Menu, useful. And in order for the look of Windows to evolve, it only makes sense for Microsoft and Stardock to team up, which feels like an easy win for both parties.\n\nFor those unaware, Start11 can supercharge the Start Menu to change its appearance, customize the layout, and even lets you change the TaskBar itself to mirror a look from Windows Vista and above.\n\nIt pretty much removes most of the irritations that users on Windows 11 have had to bear since its release and subsequent updates, and as Windows 12 is allegedly due to arrive in 2024, it makes us wonder what the Taskbar could look like in this next major release.\n\nWith Stardock giving users the ability to change the look of Windows 11 in many elegant and easier ways, perhaps it’s something Microsoft should consider buying for its arsenal.\n\nDocking into Stardock\n\nCustomizing Windows from top to bottom is nothing new. For years, you could download free apps that could change the start-up screen, the Start Menu, and plenty more.\n\nBut officially, there wasn’t much you could change. Back in the days of Windows XP, it could let you switch between a few themes where it would change the colors, but that’s as far as it went.\n\nFortunately, Windows 11 went further with how you could change up the look of your desktop. It finally gives you more detail in picking certain colors for the windows and Taskbar in Settings > Personalization, alongside being able to choose a dark mode across the operating system.\n\nBut Start11 does something different than the rest - it gives the confident impression that it’s been a part of Windows for years. You only need to go to its Settings screen, and it looks very similar to Microsoft Edge’s and Windows Media Player’s settings.\n\nIt offers you powerful ways to change the look of Windows in an approachable and easy-to-use way. Someone who isn’t experienced in using Windows’ settings could easily change the Taskbar’s look with Start11 - it’s that easy. So having Stardock being bought by Microsoft would be an easy sell to many, and it wouldn’t require much work to integrate it into Windows 12.\n\nAsking for help is not a bad thing\n\nMicrosoft isn’t a stranger to acquisitions, with its Xbox division buying up companies constantly over the past few years, with its Activision-Blizzard deal being approved around the world by competition authorities.\n\nAnd while there’s been nothing to show for it so far in the way of many playable, released games, it puts the company in a good position for its next-gen console at least. It gives Microsoft an arsenal of first-party, exclusive games that you won’t be able to play on other systems such as Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch - something it’s lacked for many years.\n\nThe same method should apply to Windows 12 and beyond. We’ve never heard of a period where Microsoft bought a company to help improve its operating system. We’ve heard similar acquisitions from Apple though, most notably its purchase of Beats Music for $3 billion back in 2014 where it helped to transform its Music app into Apple Music.\n\nBut these are competitive times - more than they’ve arguably ever been since the 1990s. Accessing apps and communicating with your friends and family is easier than ever now, while AI looks to be a tool for simplifying how you can manage your day-to-day tasks with a few simple clicks.\n\nMicrosoft has something great going with Windows now, arguably ever since the release of Windows 10, as it went back to basics by bringing back the Taskbar, Start Menu, and Desktop, and stopped trying to please everyone at once.\n\nWindows 11 has only built upon this foundation, by refreshing the look and feel of the operating system, while also updating its core apps and bringing back old ones, such as Windows Media Player.\n\nThis is why Windows 12 should build on this further, by looking at buying up some talented developers like Stardock to build upon parts of Windows and bringing these features to the latest operating system without starting from scratch."
