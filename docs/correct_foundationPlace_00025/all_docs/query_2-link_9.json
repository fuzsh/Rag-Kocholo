The different options listed below differ essentially in licensing and what samples are included.\n\nImpressionCreator. This is Stardock's entry-level DirectGUI based product. It allows developers to quickly create launching programs.\n\nFor example, when you place a CD in the drive, a launching program typically comes up. The typical launching program looks pretty awful and gives a bad first impression of the product.\n\nWith ImpressionCreator, developers can create incredibly slick looking custom applications in literally a few hours. The fully functional auto-start programs pictured below were created in hours rather than weeks (that includes the artwork being made). ImpressionCreator is designed for use by small companies looking to create relatively straight forward applications quickly and easily.\n\nIt comes with several example templates to show how it is done. [More Information..]\n\nDesktopX Professional/Enterprise. DesktopX includes the full set of DirectGUI features that offer companies the flexibility to design custom applications or build entire secure desktops. [More Information..]\n\nImpressionCreator Enterprise. This is the industrial strength version of ImpressionCreator and makes use of the full arsenal of DirectGUI abilities including integration of ActiveX controls, expandability via extensions written in C, C++, Object Pascal, C#, or any other compiled development language. [More Information..]\n\nSolution Providing. Stardock also provides graphics design and development consulting. If you have an application in mind, Stardock can create it for you at a competitive price."
