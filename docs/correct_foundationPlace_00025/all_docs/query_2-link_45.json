        "text": "Stardock today released Sorcerer King: Rivals [official site], a standalone expansion to 2015's fantasy turn-based strategy game Sorcerer King. While that was about stopping a dark overlord from ascending to godhood and killing all the fluffy kittens, or whatever it is dark gods get up to, Rivals lets players be y'know rivals. Players get to seek godhood too this time, and I'm sure you have a lot of ideas about what you can do to fix up the world. Maybe magically fix all vending machine so no one ever again ends up on an icy train platform at 2am weeping and shouting at a wonky wire spiral which has cruelly imprisoned their Twix. For starters, anyway.\n\nThe foundations are still largely the same as Sorcerer King, so do read Wot Adam Thought for more on all that. Beyond the obvious shift in premise, Rivals adds more new things to that turn-based army-building, artifact-creating, ally-making, and enemy-destroying foundation. Expect new factions to play, new honking great Lieutenants to battle, new quests, a new quest editor, and other expansion-grade additions.\n\nSorcerer King: Rivals is £22.99/27,99€/$29.99 on Steam and GOG. Folks who own the first game can get Rivals half-price.\n\nNormally I'd have asked Adam to write this news post, seeing as he's played a fair bit of the first game, but he's at Rezzed right now so you get me. Sorry. Actually. Here, I'll hand you over to Stardock head prefect Brad Wardell to explain more as he plays 40 minutes of Rivals:"
