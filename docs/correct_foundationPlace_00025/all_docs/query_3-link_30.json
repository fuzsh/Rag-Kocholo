        "text": "When it comes to home improvement and maintenance, many homeowners forget about their crawl space and basement. However, these cool, dark, and damp areas can be a perfect breeding ground for dangerous mold and expensive foundation problems. For example, if wood rot along basement walls is left untreated, it can cause serious issues for the rest of your home. If you notice any amount of standing water in your home’s crawl space, it needs to be corrected as soon as possible.\n\nSince 2012, Michigan Basements has provided crawl space encapsulation solutions in Livonia, Michigan. We perform professional basement waterproofing and airtight crawl space encapsulation services so your home stays stable and dry for decades.\n\nContact us online or call (248) 327-0065 now for your FREE inspection and estimate!\n\nMold Growth & Other Hidden Hazards for Crawl Spaces\n\nA small leak or dripping pipe seems like a minor annoyance at first, but it can lead to complex repairs over time. Crawl space air holds moisture and water vapor easily, and the eventual water damage wreaks havoc on your basement and leads to the growth of harmful mold and bacteria.\n\nThat’s why, as a homeowner, it is important to keep your crawl space dry and eliminate excess humidity. Standing water, excess moisture, and foundation leaks will all threaten the structural integrity of your home and saddle you with costly repairs. While your basement may already have a sump pump drainage system to detect flooding and drain excess water, this isn’t always enough to adequately clear ground moisture from the space and reduce relative humidity.\n\nTo protect yourself against water damage and preserve property value, turn to Michigan Basements. Our innovative triple protection waterproofing systems and wall liners keep water from infiltrating basements and crawl spaces in Livonia, Michigan, and throughout the Metro Detroit area. When we encapsulate the floor and walls of the crawl space area, we create a perfectly sealed system so vapor, moisture, and harmful gases cannot permeate through your home.\n\nWhether you need complete basement waterproofing solutions, foundation repair, or help encapsulating a crawl space, Michigan Basements has the services that will keep your home’s foundation dry and help your family stay healthy and comfortable.\n\nContact us online or call (248) 327-0065 now for your FREE inspection and estimate!\n\nHow Does Crawl Space Encapsulation & Crawl Space Moisture Control Work?\n\nCrawl spaces — especially plain dirt crawl spaces with damp earth — are often poorly-insulated and at risk of holding moisture. In addition to higher energy bills from difficulties cooling and heating, this can lead to mold growth and airborne spores creeping into your home.\n\nTo prevent this, the crawl space encapsulation process includes wrapping the entire crawl space with a moisture barrier. This includes the home’s foundation walls, foundation piers, floor joists, basement windows, sill plate, and the ground itself. A crawl space moisture barrier (also known as a crawl space vapor barrier or waterproofing membrane) is a special piece of sheeting made of waterproofing materials used to seal off areas and prevent moisture accumulation. As a bonus, the added insulation provided by this process can also improve your home’s energy efficiency and lower your electricity bills. (Plus it helps keep out pests like bugs and rodents, too!)\n\nHowever, if a crawl space vapor barrier is not installed correctly, excess moisture will continue to cause crawl space problems and the horizontal surfaces will continue to absorb water. In fact, if the vapor barrier does not function properly, it could make a moisture issue worse by insulating and accelerating mold growth. Luckily, when you partner with Michigan Basements, there’s no need to worry. We have years of experience fixing wet basements, by performing waterproofing, crawl space encapsulation, and foundation repair throughout southeast Michigan.\n\nBenefits of Installing Vapor Barriers for Foundation Walls\n\nThe encapsulation method protects a crawl space or basement from extra moisture. In most cases, we achieve this goal by installing a vapor barrier on your basement floor and up the foundation wall of the basement and/or crawl space.\n\nEncapsulation has numerous benefits, including:\n\nImproved indoor air quality\n\nImproved energy efficiency\n\nMoisture control and mildew control\n\nReduced soil gases (such as radon gas and methane)\n\nElimination of musty odors\n\nProtection of your entire home from water leaks, dry rot, and wood rot\n\nLower risk of respiratory problems\n\nReduced allergens from mold and dust mites throughout the home\n\nSwift same-day installation and clean-up!\n\nThe cost of crawl space encapsulation will vary depending on several factors (such as crawl space size and your home’s construction) but at Michigan Basements we do all we can to help you save money and protect your home against structural damage.\n\nWhy Choose Michigan Basements for Crawl Space Encapsulation & Basement Waterproofing?\n\nSince 2012, Michigan Basements has provided affordable crawl space encapsulation and basement waterproofing for Livonia residents and families across Oakland County, Wayne County, and Macomb County.
