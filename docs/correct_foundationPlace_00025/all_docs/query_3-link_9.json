        "text": "Diane Montes, founder of the Livonia Save Our Youth Coalition, comes from a service-oriented family who found ways to give back to the community. That mindset has led to her being recognized with the Livonia First Citizen Award this year.\n\nMontes found her passion through the heartbreak of losing her 22-year-old son Brian to a drug overdose. She discovered him lying in his bed after taking a fatal mix of heroin and Fentanyl in June 2006.\n\nAs she processed the grief, she started a mission of making others aware of the dangers and support for those dealing with addiction. Her determination intensified to urgency as she learned there was little public awareness 15 years ago about the growing epidemic with opioids.\n\n\"It was a taboo subject to discuss at the time, but drug use was so prevalent in the suburbs,\" Montes said. \"There was an urgent need to wake people up and do something.\"\n\nThis led to the formation of the Livonia Save Our Youth Coalition, a nonprofit organization connecting people to substance-abuse education, prevention and support and building a healthy community. With educational programs, financial support and key partnerships, Livonia Save Our Youth Coalition programming reached many families and young people over the past 15 years.\n\nAs the founder of this valuable community resource, Montes was selected as the 2022 recipient of the Livonia First Citizen Award, an annual honor given to a Livonia resident for extraordinary community service.\n\n\"Diane followed the light of her faith to learn everything she could about how such a tragedy could impact her family,\" said Karen Bonanno, the executive director of the Coalition since 2015. \"The inspiration of Diane’s insight continues to shine brightly though continued conversation and meaningful collaboration, with the goal of preventing similar heartbreak in other families.\"\n\nMontes credits her mother, Marge Slattery, with setting an example of serving others. As a nurse in 1985, she created a nonprofit, Domus Vita, which is Latin for \"house of light.\" The Livonia-based nonprofit provides long-term care and assistance for patients with special needs across metro Detroit.\n\n\"Everyone in our family worked for the company in some capacity, and we all followed her example,\" Montes said.\n\nMore: Westland's faulty crosswalk signals highlight need for pedestrian safety improvements\n\nMore: Presidents Day: These U.S. leaders all made stops in metro Detroit over the years\n\nMore: Livonia councilwoman with health concerns serving virtually after Attorney General opinion\n\nWith Livonia Save Our Youth, Montes formed partnerships with St. Mary Mercy Hospital, local schools, local church groups, Livonia police, Livonia fire and city officials.\n\n\"Some were reluctant at first, but it is a testament to those involved that all these sectors got involved,\" she said.\n\nAlong with Bonanno’s work, Montes also praises fellow original board members Jason Schwartz, Dr. Mark Menestrina, Jerry Kwas and Bob Douville for their work the entire time. Donations, grants, and an annual race generates the money for the Coalition’s work each year.\n\nThe coalition has provided more awareness and resources in Livonia and Montes said she believes there is less stigma about discussing drug use, which is vital with the community’s increased mental health and addiction concerns in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nMontes and her Bentley High School sweetheart, Andy, have been married 43 years, had three children and seven grandchildren. Many of her community-minded relatives continue to live in Livonia. They play golf together each year to raise money for the Brian Montes Foundation, which provides scholarships for those in need of treatment programs and recovery group homes.\n\nThe Leadership and Awards Celebration is set for 5-7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 23. Admission is $40 per person for dinner and the program. For details, call the Chamber office at 734-427-2122."
