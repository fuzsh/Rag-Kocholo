Out of this goal, the Livonia Community Foundation was created as an effort to enrich the community and help people looking for grants.\n\nSince their start in 1995, this organization has since managed to raise over $1 million. Each year, more and more people contribute to this organization to help improve and enrich the lives of those around them. Today, this foundation includes over 750 Livonia families, individuals, and businesses.\n\nDonate to the Livonia Community Foundation Today!\n\nThereâ€™s nothing like living in a community that offers an enriching culture full of thriving businesses and exciting events. With the Livonia Community Foundation, you can ensure that people can enjoy the town of Livonia, MI, to the fullest for years to come."
