        "text": "On average, Livonia homeowners pay about $2,853 for foundation repair, although the cost will vary depending on several factors. The easiest way to get an estimate for the cost of a specific project is to get quotes from a handful of local foundation repair companies. The amount you pay for a job will be affected by things like the type of the repair(s) and the size of your house.\n\nThe primary types of foundation repair are crack repair, leak repair, underpinning, stabilization, and waterproofing.\n\nCrack repair and leak repair are exactly as they sound: your foundation contractor will perform an inspection and take necessary measures to remedy cracks or leaks. The price will vary depending on the size and cause of the issue.\n\nUnderpinning, also called leveling or piering, is when a contractor levels your foundation by underpinning it with large concrete piers. The price will be based on how many piers are required. The price of stabilization is also variable. This process fixes bowing walls by reinforcing them with steel or carbon fiber strips. The cost will depend on the material chosen and how many strips are used.\n\nLastly, waterproofing is an overarching term for a number of jobs that help prevent water from getting into your foundation or basement. This can include interior waterproofing, exterior waterproofing, or both, and the price can vary widely. We recommend contacting a waterproofing specialist if you're interested in waterproofing your foundation.\n\nIf you're building a new house, make sure that a soil report is completed. This report contains information about how well the soil on a given piece of land can support a foundation, and can give you a heads-up about potential future issues. If your concerns are about an existing house, a few hundred dollars will cover an inspection and report by a structural engineer. The engineer can point you to any issues that need attention, and give you advice on avoiding future problems.\n\nIt's also important that the moisture around your foundation is at an appropriate level. Don't let the soil around your Livonia home get too dry or too wet; at different times, you might find yourself having to reroute your gutters or water your foundation. You should also stay vigilant for leaky pipes or gutters and repair them quickly."
