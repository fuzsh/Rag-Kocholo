The car above is not unlike plenty of others whose drivers do what they can to avoid the large dip. The Chessie System railroad company plans to raise the sunken track at the crossing on Haggerty Road south of Joy. Project engineer Tom Tippie said the $5,000 job will begin sometime in August and take a week to complete. Haggerty Road will be closed to traffic at that point <strong>for</strong> the duration of the work, Tippie said. Motorists are advised to use Lil- ley Road as a detour during construction. Residents are expected to be advised of the exact date of construction as workers move their way up the tracks from Toledo as they complete projects along the way. Although the railroad line in question has existed since 1868, Tippie said, the crossing at Haggerty Road has existed just two years. The tracks <strong>for</strong>merly crossed Haggerty at a point about 250 feet northwest of the current location be<strong>for</strong>e the road was relocated. Tippie said. It's not uncommon <strong>for</strong> railroad tracks at new crossings to settle, Tippie said. The crossing has settled at least two inches, leaving an abrupt bump between tracks and concrete. SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS O IM SubuH»n Comauak-alfcna Corporation New police radios •On several occasions, police requests <strong>for</strong> assistance have gone unheard. That's prompted a request <strong>for</strong> an improved radio system estimated at more than $200,000. BY RALPH R. ECHTINAW STAFF WRITER <strong>Canton</strong> Township tv Director John Santomauro is worried that a police officer will be injured or killed because his radio call <strong>for</strong> assistance isn't heard back at headquarters. \"We've had three incidents in the last 30 days where officers called <strong>for</strong> assistance and we didn't hear them,\" Santomauro told <strong>Canton</strong> trustees Tuesday. Santomauro hopes that trustees will approve his roquest to Upgrade the radio system at a cost of $214,715 without taking bjds. \"The recommended modifications are needed immediately,\" he wrote in a report. \"The bidding process at this point would slow down the project. Any such breakdown proposes a potential threat to the safety of our personnel.\" To the board he said, \"It is imperative that we move along as quickly See RAMOS, 2A Whyman chided <strong>for</strong> 'divisive politics' State Rep.

The letter says that Whyman, who seeks re-election to a third term this year, and Schroder, who worked <strong>for</strong> Whyman in 1994 and is running himself <strong>for</strong> county commissioner now, are contaminating their campaigns with racist tactics. Whyman has charged that the poor quality of area roads can be blamed in part on policies that set aside work <strong>for</strong> minority contractors and that her Democratic opponent. <strong>Canton</strong> resident Deborah Nesbit, was recruited by the Detroit NAACP. Schroder, who opposes county commissioner 'l'haddeus McCotter <strong>for</strong> the Republican nomination to represent Livonia, Plymouth and Plymouth Township, has been criticized <strong>for</strong> a plan to have western Wayne County communities secede from Wayne County. \"We are writing to ask that you take a'strong stand against the divisive politics of Deborah Whyman See WHYMAN, 2A Firefighters host softball benefit BY JOANNE MAUSZEWSKL STAFF WRITER If the success and popularity of the <strong>Canton</strong> firefighters' and police benefit hockey games are any clue, get ready <strong>for</strong> a rarin' good time at their benefit softball game Aug. 3. .
