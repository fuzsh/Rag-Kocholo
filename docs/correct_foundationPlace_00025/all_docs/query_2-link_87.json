        "text": "Stardock released Start10, its popular Windows desktop customization software, on Steam today. With Start10, users can return to the style of the most functional start menu ever made and make it even better with onboard configuration tools. Users can select the familiar Windows 7 style menu or the Modern design as the foundation of a custom Start menu experience. Changing out colors, applying textures, and setting up filtered searches are just a few ways that Start10 blends the best of what users are looking for when launching their favorite applications.\n\n“No one wants to spend a long time searching for things on their desktop,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock. “Start10 makes it easy to establish search filters and navigate your apps. It’s also fully integrated with Fences, which provides access to a fence right in your Start menu for all of your favorite programs. You can get both programs on Steam right now, and we definitely plan to add more.”\n\nWith Start10, users can change the taskbar’s textures and background images and hide or customize the Start button altogether. Start10 comes with several selections for Start button icons, but there are also plenty of user-created options at WinCustomize. A full collection of custom Start buttons can be found here on the site.\n\nStart10 has its own Search box with configurable filters for Start or Windows searches. Easy, one-click access to Universal and Classic applications allows for a seamless transition back to a Windows 10 look and feel.\n\nOptions for a “Windows 7” or “Modern Style” look in Start10 gives users the ability to go back to a familiar Start menu or try something new. A full range of customization tools allow users to enable taskbar transparency and even shift the level of blur applied to their desktop backgrounds, and more.\n\nDesigned for functionality, Start10 is integrated with Stardock’s Fences software. Fences will automatically sort into the menu list with no additional setup, which means users can access the contents of their fences without closing windows or shuffling them around. This makes it easy to stay organized while enjoying a customized Start menu.\n\nSeveral key features make Start10 your best Windows Start menu alternative.\n\nWindows 7-styled Start menu option\n\nA modern style with classic menu functionality\n\nDesktop and modern apps pin to the Start menu\n\nJump list support\n\nFiltered search options for apps, settings, and files\n\nAutomatically matches the color of your taskbar\n\nIntegrates Stardock’s Fences right into the menu\n\nSkinnable Start button\n\nAbility to choose default behavior of the Start menu power button\n\nStart10 is $4.99 and is now available on Steam or through Stardock.
