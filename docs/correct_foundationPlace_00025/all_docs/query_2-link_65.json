The asteroids were supposed to provide us with limitless resources, but their promise was stolen by a corrupt monopoly. The powerful enforce a status quo dedicated to protecting their interests, leaving the rest of us fighting over scraps. Mars is the last chance for anyone who still believes they can make something of themselves.It's time to stake your claim.Time to head Offworld.\n\nWebsite Link - http://www.offworldgame.com/\n\nAttachments\n\nOffworldLaunch_01_full.jpg\n\nOffWorldTC_Buildings_02_full.jpg\n\nOffWorldTC_Buildings_03_full.jpg\n\nLast edited: January 29, 2015\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nNameless one\n\nWizzard\n\nJoined\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,436\n\nLocation\n\nSto plains\n\nJanuary 29, 2015\n\n#2\n\nGraphic is relatively simple but I find it very appealing.\n\nGame itself looks interesting kind of like Anno in space.\n\nJoined\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1,436\n\nLocation\n\nSto plains\n\nCouchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nFebruary 2, 2015\n\n#3\n\nHere is a new interview form GameWatcher with Soren Johnson.\n\nLink - http://www.gamewatcher.com/interviews/offworld-trading-company-interview/12129\n\nGameWatcher: Is there anything else about the game that you’d like to communicate to Gamewatcher readers that we haven’t already touched upon?\n\nSoren Johnson: Two things I want to emphasize for people because they sometimes assume the opposite. This is a game that is going to be a great single player game. We talk about the multiplayer because that’s where you have so much fun, but primarily we’re seeing it as a great single player experience.\n\nThe other thing is that while the game is very much about building up an infrastructure and creating this profitable business, there are a lot of systems and mechanics that put you in direct contact with the other players, whether that’s racing for claims or. There are these auctions that come up where you’re bidding directly against other players for a plot or patent. There’s the piracy where you’re choosing to attack different players or the black market where you can buy dynamite, EMPs and power surges and use them to mess with people. These things can be used in combination right, you can get an EMP to knock out power, then use the hacker array to trigger a power shortage which means that suddenly this player doesn’t have a source of power while the price is going up high. So you can watch at the same moment their stock price starts dropping as they go into debt and you can use that opportunity to buy up their stock. There’s definitely a lot of direct interaction.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nCouchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nFebruary 3, 2015\n\n#4\n\nAnd that's not all I found today here is a new video from the developer.\n\nLink - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_LTR5m3yiU\n\nFirst public single-player stream of Offworld!\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nCouchpotato\n\nPart-Time News-bot\n\nJoined\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n37,379\n\nLocation\n\nSpudlandia\n\nFebruary 12, 2015\n\n#5\n\nHere is the announcement the game is now available on Steam Early Access.\n\nOffworld Trading Company Early Access Now Available\n\nEconomic RTS from Soren Johnson’s Mohawk Games offers a different kind of warfare -\n\nPlymouth, MI – February 12, 2015 – Players are now able to begin colonizing Mars in Offworld Trading Company, the economic RTS from Mohawk Games, as the title is now available on Steam Early Access for a limited-time discount of $35.99 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/271240/). The title also remains discounted directly through publisher Stardock at http://offworldgame.com/store.\n\nThe Early Access version of Offworld Trading Company allows players to compete head to head or in free-for-all matches over the Internet, explore the dynamic single-player campaign that responds to your choices and the outcomes of the scenarios, and skirmish against the advanced AI that is already more than capable of wiping the floor with unsuspecting players.\n\nOffworld Trading Company is a new direction for real-time strategy, where money is both your deadliest weapon and toughest defense. After the Earth is tapped out and the asteroids claimed by faceless megacorporations, the stark Martian surface is the final frontier on which dreamers and entrepreneurs can make something of themselves by staking their claim to the red planet’s abundant resources and building an economic engine capable of out-producing the competition.\n\nThe real-time, player-driven market is the foundation of the game, allowing players to buy and sell resources, materials, and even the food and water their colonists need to survive. Only by buying low and selling high – and perhaps engaging in a little more overt market manipulation with hacker arrays, black-market pirate raids, and more – can players build up enough capital to gain access to the incredibly lucrative offworld markets that bring in the cash they need to buy out their rivals and claim the Martian economy for themselves.\n\nTune in to http://www.twitch.tv/mohawkgames every Thursday at noon Pacific (3pm Eastern) to see the latest on Offworld Trading Company development.\n\nFor more on Offworld Trading Company, please visit http://offworldgame.com and check out the Mohawk Games blog at http://mohawkgames.com.\n\nFor more on Stardock, go to http://www.stardock.com.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout Mohawk Games: Mohawk Games is the independent game development studio run by Soren Johnson, the lead designer on legendary strategy title Civilization IV as well as many other projects.
