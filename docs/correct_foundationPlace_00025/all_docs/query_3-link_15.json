        "text": "A Tree City USA since 1998, Livonia is one of the Michigan cities recognized nationally with this designation for its forestry program. As a Tree City, Livonia annually submits an application with the state and meets four standards:\n\nTree Board or Department: The Livonia Tree City Committee serves this function. The committee is made from representatives of City Council, Livonia Public Schools, Livonia's public service division, and several residents with vested tree-related interests.\n\nCommunity Tree Ordinance: Livonia has several ordinances which focus on protection, maintenance, and proper planting of trees.\n\nCommunity Forestry Program with an Annual Budget of at least $2 per capita: Livonia has easily achieved this requirement. Budgeted work includes removals, planting, section trimming, and maintenance trimming, as well as a current computerized inventory of right-of-way trees.\n\nAn Arbor Day Observance and Proclamation: Each year, the Mayor and City Council make a proclamation marking the date of Arbor Day. The City and past hosts of the event marks the date by flying the Tree City USA flag. For fourteen years, the City of Livonia has partnered with a rotating elementary school in the City. Students are involved in the program and tree-planting ceremony in an adjoining City park, on school property, or street right-of-way.\n\nArbor Day Foundation's Tree City USA Program\n\nThe Arbor Day Foundation's Tree City USA program, a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters, was launched in 1976 with 42 communities in 15 states. Today, there are 3,409 Tree City USA communities with a combined population of more than 138 million people.\n\nExceeding the Standards\n\nIn 2013, 563 communities nationwide exceeded basic standards by receiving a Tree City Growth Award, demonstrating their commitment to going the extra mile in tree management and care. Livonia now has 10 Growth Awards and will receive another this year.\n\nNational Arbor Day Foundation"
