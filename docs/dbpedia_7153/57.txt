Beatrice II (1193 – 7 May 1231) reigned as Countess Palatine of Burgundy from 1205 until her death. She was a member of the Swabian Hohenstaufen dynasty, the daughter of Count Otto I of Burgundy and Margaret, Countess of Blois, thereby a granddaughter of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

She was born in 1193, younger sister of Countess Joanna I of Burgundy. From the time of her father's death at Besançon in 1200, she was next-in-line to the county, eventually succeeding Joanna after her death in 1205. Her uncle Philip of Swabia, German king since 1198, had ensured her Burgundian heritage.

In 1208 she married Duke Otto I, Duke of Merania, by whom she had 6 children:

Otto III, Count of Burgundy

Agnes of Merania (1215-1263)

Beatrix of Andechs-Merania

Margaret

Adelaide, Countess of Burgundy
