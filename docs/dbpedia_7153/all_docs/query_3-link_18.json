        "text": "Died 808 or later.\n\nMargrave of Istria and, according to some sources, Duke of Friuli from 799 to c. 804, the same year that Eric of Friuli died, when a Duke John is found ruling Istria. He was the founder of the family called the Hunfridings.\n\nHunfrid first appears in Istria as marchio in 799, the same year that Eric of Friuli died. He was probably an Aleman, although the historian of early medieval Raetia, Elilzabeth Meyer-Marthaler, considered him of Frankish origin. He was count of Rhaetia in 806 and 808. A record of his presiding over a public court at Rankweil survives in his capacity as count of Rhaeta (Reciarum comis) survives. He interrogated witnesses, ordered boundaries of a disputed property walked out, ordered judges (scabini) to make a finding and issued a verdict in writing. The surviving record describes him as a .vir inluster.\n\nBased on his presence in a list of personages in the libri memoriales of Reichenau and Sankt Gallen, he is presumed to have married Hitta (Hidda), an Udalriching and probably the niece or granddaughter of Gerold of Vinzgouw and thus a cousin or niece of Hunfrid's predecessor in Italy, Eric. Based on the same memorial books, he is probably the father of Adalbert, his successor in Rhaetia, Odalric, who became Count of Barcelona in another part of the Empire, and Hunfrid II, who became dux super Redicam (duke over Rhaetia) and father of the later Hunfriding Dukes of Swabia.\n\nFrankish Duke of Istria in the early years of the 9th century, soon after its conquest by Charlemagne.\n\nIn 804, the denizens of the nine cities of Istria complained to Charlemagne that John was ignoring their ancient privileges [Placito del Risano]. John had taken away the privileges of sea-fishing and pasturing in public forests. He had abolished the old hierarchy and either abolished the offices of tribune, domesticus, vicarius, and hypatus or filled them Franks. He seized lands and confiscated the taxes (344 \"solidi mancusi\" annually from the cities) for himself. He forced many to serve in the army personally, alongside their slaves, and to demand corvÃ©e labour. John explained that he had been ignorant of the customs of Istria and promised to make amends and ceased exacting corvÃ©es. It is unknown if he did. [Source: Wickham, Chris.

His father was either William II or William III of Weimar, the son of a comital family from Weimar in the Imperial Landgraviate of Thuringia. His mother was probably Oda, daughter of the Saxon margrave Thietmar. He married Hadamut, the daughter of Weriand, Count of Istria, and thus inherited a claim to the Istrian peninsula. She gave him one son, Ulric I, who succeeded his father in 1045. After King Henry III of Germany inherited Carinthia, he established the Margrave of Istria and Carniola in 1040. As his wife's mother was related to the Bavarian Counts of Ebersberg, who held possessions in Carniola, Poppo was also appointed Carniolan margrave in 1040.\n\nBorn before 1045 and died March 6, 1070. Margrave of Carniola and Carinthia from 1045 and Margrave of Istria from 1060.\n\nHe was the son and successor of Poppo I and Hadamut of Friuli and Istria. He married Sophie, princess of Hungary, and they had two children: Poppo II, Count of Weimer, and Rickart (Ricardis) of Weimer.\n\nOn 31 July 1064, the Emperor Henry IV donated land \"in pago Histrie... in comitatu Odalrici marchionis\" (\"in the country of Istria... in the county of Margrave Ulric\") to \"prefato Odalrico marchioni\" (\"the prefect Ulric, margrave\"). Again on 5 March 1067, Henry donated land \"in pago Istria in marcha Odalrici marchionis\" (\"in the country of Istria in the march of Margrave Ulric\"), this time to the church Freising. Ulric was recorded as \"Odalricus marchio Carentinorum\" (\"Ulric, margrave of the Carinthians\") on his death. Ulric married Sophia, daughter of Bela I of Hungary and his first wife, Ryksa or Richeza, daughter of Casimir I of Poland. Alternatively, it has been suggested that she was the daughter of Bela and his second wife, Tuta von Formbach. Sophia was a sister of Ladislaus I of Hungary. Another alternateive hypothesis makes Sophia the daughter of Tuta and Peter of Hungary, but that seems highly unlikely. Sophie gave her first husband four children:\n\nMargrave of Istria from 1098 until circa 1107 and Carniola from 1098 until his death May 13, 1112.\n\nHe was the second son of Ulric I and Sophia, daughter of Bela I of Hungary. He was thus of royal blood. Ulric was created Count of Weimar when still a child in 1067. He inherited both of his father's marches on the death of his brother Poppo II in 1098, but was divested of Istria sometime between 1101 and 1107, when it went to Engelbert II of Sponheim, whose father had preceded Ulric's brother in the march. Ulric was described as \"de Saxonie principus\". He married Adelaide (d.1146), daughter of Louis II, Count of Thuringia, but left no children. His sister Adelaide passed on the Carniolan inheritance to her grandson Conrad I, Duke of Merania.\n\nDied October 6, 1173.\n\nMargrave of Istria [In contemporary documents \"marchio Ystrie\" and \"marchio de Hystria\".] and Carniola [In contemporary documents \"marchio de Chreiburch\".] in 1124 until his death in 1173, and was Duke of Carinthia from 1124 until 1135. He was the eldest son of Engelbert II and Uta of Passau. He succeeded his father in Istria and Carniola when his father was raised to the Duchy of Carinthia. He is sometimes numbered Engelbert II of Istria. From 1135 to 1137 Engelbert was Margrave of Tuscany. In 1156, he witnessed the granting of the \"Privilegium Minus\" creating the Duchy of Austria. Engelbert married Matilda, youngest daughter of Berengar I of Sulzbach. He was thus a brother-in-law of Gertrude, wife of Conrad III of Germany, and Irene, wife of Manuel I Comnenus. Matilda died late in 1165. They had four children: Richgard, married Eckard, Count of Scheyern; Adelaide, married firstly Frederick, Vogt of Regensburg, and secondly Udalschalk, Count of Lurngau; Henry, who inherited Carinthia from his grandfather in 1144.\n\nBorn c. 1218, died June 19, 1248, he was also Margrave of Carniola, Duke of Merania and Count Palatine of Burgundy (as Otto III).\n\nHe was the only son of Duke Otto I, Duke of Merania and his wife Beatrice, daughter of the Hohenstaufen count Otto I of Burgundy. He succeeded his mother as Count Palatine of Burgundy on her death in 1231, and his father as Duke of Andechs and Merania on his death in 1234. In the same year, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Count Albert IV of Tyrol. The marriage remained childless.\n\nStill a minor, he remained under the tutelage of his Andechs relative Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg until 1236. When he came of age, he left the administration of the County of Burgundy (Franche-ComtÃ©) to King Theobald I of Navarre to engage in the struggle around his Bavarian possessions against the ducal House of Wittelsbach. He lost his position as a Vogt of Tegernsee Abbey as well as the ancestral seat in Andechs, but retained the possession of Innsbruck, which he elevated to a town in 1239 and put under the administration of his father-in-law Count Albert of Tyrol. In 1242 he gave Franche-ComtÃ© in pawn to Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy.\n\nIn his later years, Otto concentrated on his family's estates in Franconia. In the fierce controversy between the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II and Pope Innocent IV, he sided with his feudal lord, the Bishop of Bamberg, which earned him an Imperial ban and a large-scale loss of his possessions. Like his Andechs ancestors, he benefitted the Cistercian abbey in Langheim, Franconia, where he was buried upon his death in 1248. He also had vested neighbouring Lichtenfels with city rights in 1231. Heirless, he was succeeded in Burgundy by his sister Adelaide and her husband Count Hugh of Chalon, while the now empty title of a Duke of Merania finally expired. With the death of Otto's uncle Patriarch Berthold of Aquileia in 1251, the House of Andechs became extinct."
