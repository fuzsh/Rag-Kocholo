        "text": "The Duchy of Merania[lower-alpha 1] was a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire from 1152 until 1248. The dukes of Merania were recognised as princes of the Empire enjoying imperial immediacy at a time when these concepts were just coming into use to distinguish the highest ranks of imperial nobility.\n\nThe name \"Merania\" (\"sea-land\") comes from either the High German word for sea, meer or the Slavic word for the same, morje (both cognate with Latin mare). The name literally means \"land by the sea\" (am Meer), referring to its location on the Adriatic."
