She was therefore the sister of Geoffrey Greymantle. She was married five times to some of France's most important noblemen.\n\nHer first marriage, probably before 960, was to Stephen, Viscount of Gévaudan. Her second marriage was to Raymond III, Count of Toulouse and Prince of Gothia, in 975. He died in 978.\n\nIn 982, she married Louis V of France, the young son of Lothair of France, and the two were crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine on the same day at Brioude. The large difference in age between the spouses was cause for a quick divorce in 984.\n\nShe fled then to Arles, where she contracted, against papal advice, a marriage with William I of Provence in 984. She gave him a daughter, Constance of Arles, who later married Robert II of France.\n\nHer final marriage was to Otto-William, Count of Burgundy.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 Variously given as Alice, Adelais, Adalais, or Azalais.\n\n2 Adélaïde Blanche d'Anjou\n\n3 \"la Blanche.\"2\n\nSources\n\n1Weis, Frederick Lewis & Sheppard, Walter Lee, Jr, \"Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700: Lineages from Alfred the Great, Charlemagne, Malcolm of Scotland, Robert the Strong, and other Historical Individuals\". p 62, 53-21; 105, 101-21."
