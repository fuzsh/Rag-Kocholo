The first chronicler to report the rumors about a love affair between Henry II and Eleanor was Hugh of Poitiers. Henry II of England was becoming increasingly influential at court, and the other great counts of France were becoming resentful.”\n\nFreepedia\n\nMarie of Blois and Henry II’s kids\n\nStephen

married to Raymond Berenguer II of Provence as an alliance against the Count of Toulouse, the marriage would happen in 1159, the Holy Roman Emperor would support the Count of Toulouse against Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband the French King.\n\nEleanor’s lands are united to the crown after Eleanor of Aquitaine’s death on 1204 and the Limousin language would overwhelm the language in the North in the following centuries due to William being raised on that culture and its general linguistic groups influence in the Mediterranean.\n\n“The birth of the Saint King William I of France was said to be the event that solidified the fall of the Northern Culture in favor of the Limousin Culture in France.”\n\nCarles Puigdemont, governor of Barcelona Province of the Kingdom of Aragon\n\nWilliam I of

term and became his regent along with his mother, Eleanor due to them getting along with each other.\n\nI am a bit confused. If William is already reigning, how is Eleanor still regent?\n\nOn 1180, William XI, Duke of Aquitaine would succeed his father as William I of France and with him his wife, Adela of Champagne, he is cultured, and his mother tongue is a dialect of the Literary Linguafranca of the Western Mediterranean, not like his own father who has the Northern dialects and Frankish as his own mother tongue which would alienate him to the Northern nobility, he would be known to the people as William the Saint, his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine would make him less close to his father and focus on the affairs of mother’s duchy and at times clashed with his father about the administration of the Kingdom of France.\n\nThe first action of William I of France was to marry, Matilda Richeza of Saxony, Henry II’s granddaughter to his own son, Philip, creating peace between the Capetians and the Plantagenets in the north due to the suggestion of his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his second action was to marry Berengaria of Navarre after the death of his first wife in 1190.\n\nOn 1180, William I of France would would marry his daughter, Margaret to Otto, Count of Burgundy.\n\nOn 1190, when William I of France went to Santiago de Compostela after his marriage with his second wife Berengaria, he married his daughter, Anne of France, to Alfonso IX of Leon on 1190, she would give birth to the three children, Eleanor(1192), Sanchia(1193) and Ferdinand(1191) until her death in 1196.\n\nOn 1192, William I of France would find out that Isabella of Jerusalem is married to Conrad of Montferrat, who would die of mysterious causes and in 1193, Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli, his nephew from his sister Alice would marry Isabella of Jerusalem but this marriage would have no issue on his death in 1197 and afterwards, she would marry Aimery of Lusignan.\n\nMysterious causes...suspicious\n\nHe is known in his native tongue as Guilhem I de França and to the Northerners as Guillaume/Willaume I de France but he would focus his own rule in the South in Bordeaux rather than in the North which would continue the status of Latin as the official language for centuries to come and Provencal and Limousin dominating over the Northern dialects.\n\nOn 1194, William I of France years after the death of Barbarossa with the encouragement of Eleanor of Aquitaine would be the Anti-Emperor for Henry VI and opposed the expansion of Henry VI in Sicily with his wife, Constance and battled Henry VI of the HRE in 1194 in support of the surviving Hautevilles and declared himself the King of Italy and Burgundy but that would be in vain and led to his capture in 1194 and he was ransomed by his son Philip of France and his mother, Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine.\n\nHe would die in 1199 and be succeeded by his own son Philip II who was crowned with his second wife, Ingeborg of Denmark.\n\nOn 1202, Eleanor of Aquitaine would don the veil of the nun in Barbeau Abbey and have herself buried with her husband Louis VII in 1204 which would cause the final absorption of the Duchy of Aquitaine, County of Poitou, and Duchy of Gascony to the crown."
