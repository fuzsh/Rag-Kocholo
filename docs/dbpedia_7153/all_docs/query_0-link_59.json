        "text": "HUGUES, son of HUGUES “le Grand” Duc des Francs & his third wife Hedwig of Germany ([940]-villa \"Les Juifs\", near Prasville, Eure-et-Loire 24 Oct 996, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis). The Historia Francorum Senonensis names (in order) \"Hugo, Otto et Heinricus\" as the three sons of \"Hugo Magnus dux Francorum…ex filia Odonis regis\"[142]. Flodoard names \"Hugonem et Oddonem clericum\" as brothers of \"Otto filius Hugonis\", when he records that the rectores of Burgundy named them as his successors[143]. Rodulfus Glauber names \"Hugoni, Parisiensis ducis filio…illius Magni Hugonis\", specifying that his mother was \"Ottone…sorore\"[144]. His father named Richard Comte [de Normandie] as Hugues's guardian in 956, the arrangement being confirmed by Richard's betrothal to the sister of Hugues. The Annales Nivernenses record in 958 that \"rex et mater sua et Ugo filius Ugonis et mater sua\" attended a hearing \"apud Marziacum vicum iuxta Nevernis…contra Guillelmum comitem Aquitaniæ post missa sancti Martini\"[145]. He was installed as Duc des Francs/dux Francorum by Lothaire King of the West Franks in 960. By 974, Hugues had become effective leader of France under King Lothaire and headed the army which retook the kingdom of Lotharingia from Otto II King of Germany in 978[146]. He was elected HUGUES \"Capet\" King of France by an assembly of nobles at Senlis 29 May 987, after the death of Louis V King of France. He was consecrated at Noyon 1 Jun 987. Charles Duke of Lotharingia, the late king's uncle who opposed the accession of King Hugues, captured Laon in [May] 988, and Reims in [Aug/Sep] 989, with the help of his nephew Arnoul Archbishop of Reims, but was finally captured at Laon in 991[147]. The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death in 998 of \"Hugo rex\" and his burial \"in basilica beati Dyonisii martiris Parisius\"[148]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"IX Kal Nov\" of \"Hugo rex\"[149].\n\nm ([968]%29 ADELAIS [de Poitou, daughter of GUILLAUME III “Tête d'Etoupes” Duke of Aquitaine [GUILLAUME I Comte de Poitou] & his wife Adela [Gerloc] de Normandie] ([950/55]-15 Jun [1004]). There is some doubt about Adelais´s ancestry. The 11th century Translatio S. Maglorii et aliorum names \"Adelaide…filia Pictavorum comitis, de progenie Caroli Magni\" as the wife of \"Hugone, Francorum duce\", clarifying that the latter refers to Hugues \"Capet\" King of France when it names \"Roberto…rege, memorati ducis filio\"[150]. This Poitevin origin is also suggested by Richer when he records that King Robert \"ob nepotem suum Wilelmum\" besieged \"in Aquitania…Hildebertum\"[151]. It is assumed that such a relationship between King Robert and Duke Guillaume would be through the king's mother as no family connection through his father has been established. Some doubt is introduced by the Chronicle of Ademar de Chabannes which recounts the dispute between \"Dux Aquitanorum Willelmus\" and King Hugues, as well as the subsequent peace agreed between the parties in 990, without mentioning that the duke was the king's brother-in-law[152], all the more surprising if the Poitevin origin is correct as Ademar concentrates on Poitevin affairs and includes genealogical details in his narrative. Another possible ancestry is suggested by Helgaud's Vita Roberti Regis which names \"Rex Francorum Rotbertus…patre Hugone, matre Adhelaide\", specifying that \"ab Ausonis partibus descenderat\"[153]. Settipani equates \"Ausonia\" with Rome or Italy[154], although no other reference to an Italian origin for Adelais has yet been identified. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to the mother of \"rex Francorum Robertus\" as \"superiorem regum Anglie soror\"[155], but it is difficult to see to whom this could refer or how it could be correct. The paucity of references in contemporary sources to the wife of Hugues Capet and her origin contrasts with the frequent references to his mother and to the wives of his son King Robert II. This suggests that the background of Queen Adelais may have been obscure and that her family had little political influence at the time, although this would be surprising as her husband already enjoyed a position of some power at the Carolingian court at the time of his marriage. Maybe her family was prominent when the couple married but suffered a subsequent decline by the time her husband was elected king. Nevertheless, an Aquitainian marriage would have fitted the political circumstances of the time. After several decades of dispute between the Capet and Poitou families, a permanent peace appears to have been established from about the time the marriage took place[156]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XVII Kal Jul\" of \"Adelaidis regina\"[157].\n\nMistress (1): ---. The name of King Hugues's possible mistress is not known.]\n\nKing Hugues & his wife had three children:\n\n1. GISELA de France ([970][158]-). The Chronique de Saint Riquier records that Hugues \"Capet\" King of France granted the château d'Abbeville \"à un chevalier nommé Hugues\" who had married the king's daughter \"Gisèle\"[159]. m (before 987) HUGUES ---, son of --- (-4 Jul [1000]). Hugues Capet King of France separated Abbeville, Ancre and Domart from the Abbaye de Saint-Riquier and gave them to Hugues, who was known as the avoué de Saint-Riquier[160]. These territories became the foundation of the county of Ponthieu.\n\n2. HEDWIGE [Avoie] de France ([969][161]-after 1013). The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Robertum regem et filiam Hadevidem…comitissam Hainonensium\" as the children of King Hugues[162]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also names \"soror regis Roberti Hadwidis\" as wife of \"Rainero comiti de Hainaco, fratri Lamberti comitis de Lovanio\"[163]. Sigebert's Chronica records in 977 that \"Raginerus\" married \"Hathuidem filiam Hugonis postea regis\"[164]. \"Comes Raginerus et Hathuidis coniux\" are named in the Gesta of Gembloux Abbey[165]. Her brother gave her the towns of Couvin, Fraisne, Nîme, Eve and Bens [all now in Belgium] as her dowry on her marriage. \"Raginero comite…et Hathuidis coniunx eius\" donated property at Gion to Gembloux by charter dated to [1013][166]. \"Heinricus…Romanorum imperator augustus\" took into his protection the abbey of Florennes founded by \"Gerardus…in primis meus capellanus postea…Cameracensis episcopus effectus et fratres sui Godefridus et Arnulphus\" by charter dated 1018, which refers to earlier donations of property by \"comitissa Hawidis, annuentibus filiis suis comite Raginero et Lamberto\"[167]. \"Chuonradus…Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed the foundation of Florennes abbey by charter dated 1033, which records among others the donation of \"comitissa Hadegundis, annuentibus comite Raginero et Lamberto filiis suis…in Prona sita in pago Haynomensi\"[168]. The identity of \"comitissa Hawidis/Hadegundis\", and therefore the existence of Lambert, supposed brother of Reginar [V] Comte de Hainaut, is not certain. Hedwige, wife of Reginar [IV] Comte de Hainaut, is the most obvious candidate. If this is correct, the donation must have been made after her husband's death in 1013 as he is not named in the document. The other possibility is that the donor was the mother of Reginar [IV] Comte de Hainaut and his brother Lambert [I] Comte de Louvain. However, the name of the wife of their father, Reginar [III] Graf im Maasgau, is recorded elsewhere as Adela (see the document BRABANT). m ([996]%29 REGINAR IV Comte de Hainaut, son of REGINAR [III] Graf im Maasgau & his wife Adela [von Dachsburg] (after 947-1013).\n\n3. ROBERT de France (Orléans ([27 Mar] 972-Château de Melun 20 Jul 1031, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis). The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Robertum regem et filiam Hadevidem…comitissam Hainonensium\" as the children of King Hugues[169]. He was consecrated Associate-King 25 Dec 987, Cathedral of Sainte-Croix d’Orléans. He succeeded his father in 996 as ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France.\n\nKing Hugues had one possible illegitimate son by Mistress (1):\n\n4. [GAUCELIN ] (-Châtillon Priory 1030, bur Fleury). Ademar refers to \"abbatem Gauzlenum\" being ordained at \"sancti Benedicti\" by \"Rex Rotbertus\". The text continues by explaining that he was \"nobilissimi Francorum principis filius manzer, a puero in monasterio sancti Benedicti nutritus\", specifying that \"rex supra scriptus [=Rotbertus]\" later installed him as \"archiepiscopum Bituricensibus\" after the death of Archbishop Dagbert[170]. André de Fleury´s Vita Gauzlini records that “Gauzlinus” was “ex liberiori totius Galliæ stirpe fertur ingenuam genituram excepisse”[171]. These oblique references have been interpreted as meaning that the father of Gauzlin was King Hugues \"Capet\"[172], although this is not beyond doubt. Kerrebrouck also casts doubt on this assumed paternity of Gauzlin[173]. Abbot of Fleury [1005]. Archbishop of Bourges 1013. André de Fleury´s Vita Gauzlini records the death of Gaucelin “Castellionis” and in a later passage his burial “Floriacum”[174].]\n\nhttps://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CAPET.htm#_Toc151056321\n\nAdélaïde de Poitou d'Aquitaine\n\nParents: Guillaume 'Tête d'étoupe' III d'Aquitaine & Geirlaug Adela de Normandie\n\nSpouse: Hugues Capet, Roi de France\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

This Poitevin origin is also suggested by Richer who records that King Robert \"ob nepotem suum Wilelmum\" besieged \"in Aquitania…Hildebertum\"[349]. It is assumed that such a relationship between King Robert and Duke Guillaume would be through the king's mother as no family connection through his father has been established.
