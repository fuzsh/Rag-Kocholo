USE 50FLASH TO SAVE ON HARDCOVERS at https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-58514-1 Two of the most remarkable women of the central Middle Ages, Empress Adelheid and Countess Matilda, are examined in historical context in order to show how elite women retained their wealth and power with the help of family and friends, by controlling their property, and by ruling with a mixture of toughness and mercy. This book is the first detailed comparison of the two ruling women Adelheid and Matilda set against the background of the profound social changes of the eleventh century. The careers in context of the Ottonian queen and empress Adelheid and Countess Matilda of Tuscany reveal the change in the opportunities for women to access wealth and power. The two women are examined under three categories: their relationships with family and friends, how they managed their property (especially land), and how they ruled. http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781137590886\n\nIn a path breaking essay published in 1926, Eileen Powers argued that while males dominated voices of both the church and the aristocracy during the Middle Ages, and typically drowned out the voices, choices, and rights of most women, they could not wholly submerge all together the freedoms of women, especially for the few women with influence and power.2 This is noticeably true during the High Middle Ages (the eleventh and twelfth centuries). However, there was still an obvious lack of freedoms for women at the time, even for those who wielded power. Social historian Georges Duby notes, “early medieval aristocratic families had been relatively egalitarian, but this changed from the eleventh century onwards, when women’s options narrowed, thanks to the growing importance of patrimonial property, primogeniture, and public office.”3 Duby attributes this growth in patrimonial property rights and primogeniture to men fearing women, or more specifically, the evil nature of women. Women w...\n\nThis article revisits the evidence for the identification of the “Chasse Royale” mural in the Chapelle Ste Radegonde in Chinon with Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Plantagenets and the identification of Fécamp Psalter with Eleanor of Aquitaine. It suggests that the mural may have been commissioned by Eleanor of Aquitaine it should not be regarded as portraying the Plantagenets but part of the story of Ste Radegonde. It also suggests that the Psalter should now be regarded as a genuine commission by Eleanor of Aquitaine and as containing a representation of Eleanor herself."
