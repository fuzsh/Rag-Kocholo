Head of City Archives Wiesbaden Annals of Nassauische 118, 2007 excerpts: Anna came from the Ottonian line of the Counts of Nassau, a branch with residences in Siegen, Hadamar, and Dillenburg, who had been in the country division of 1255 areas north of the Lahn. In the 14th century Otto II of Nassau-Dillenburg had placed by his marriage with Adelaide of Vianden in Luxembourg today the basis for the subsequent\n\n4. acquisition of the county of the same name, which eventually Anna's grandfather Engelbert I fell to the heir, as the last Countess of Vianden died childless was. Through its marriage with Joan of Polans 1403 rule Breda in Brabant was added to the property. Anna's father Johann IV could unite 1450-1472 the dill burg with the Dutch possession; his full title was Count of Nassau, Vianden and Diez, Lord of Breda. Nochaus another reason Anna's family of origin was rooted in the Burgundian Netherlands room: Count Johann held a wicdhtige position at the court of Philip the Good of Burgundy; 1443 calls him the mighty duke and his council treasurer. Anna's mother came from the Burgundian-Lower Rhine area of influence: She was Countess of Loon Heinberg. She brought more Lower Rhine possessions in a marriage. Anna's parents were married in February 1440, Anna was her oldest daughter. Where and when Anna saw the light of the world, we do not know. Some reasons to believe that she was born in late 1440 or 1441. She had at least five siblings: Johanna, Adriane, Engelbert II and Johann V, the 1444, 1449, 1451, 1455 were born, and a sister Ottilie, whose date of birth is not known. Birthplace of Adriana, Engelbert and John, as perhaps also the other siblings, was the Brabant Breda, in addition to Dillenburg probably the most important residence of Anna's parents. Here they later found their final resting place. There were also at least two non- or pre-marital relations of Anna's father entsprossenene children, the customs of the time ensprechend, as bastards bezeichenet and were jointly supplied at court: John and Adrian bastards of Nassau. Her second marriage with the 1402-born Count Philipp von Katzenelnbogen had been arranged by Anna's parents, composed of Katzenelnbogen Estates. Had emerged from the connection of the already very old Count Philip with verwirweten Duchess a son, would of any subsequent seizure of the land county Hessen, the Landgrave Henry III of Hesse had his inheritance reasoning in the marriage of Philip's daughter Anna, can be avoided. This would all in the interest of the Counts of Nassau. The Eheberedung said that Anna should get as Wittum income in interest and natural history of 1600 florins a year. As a widow seat pointed Count Philip his bride Burgschwalbach to the associated rule and all rights of use; of this rule to be derived rights revenue, about from court fines and other gradients, should not be counted against their other income. As dowry undertook the Count, her jäührlich to instruct 200 guilders, which they could use as their salvation, by his death at will. Anna should bring in return the Earl a dowry of 400 florins a year into the marriage. This dowry consisted of income from Annas Brunswick Wittum, the Office Lüchow they leased annually for a sum of 666 guilders. In this context, something like a strong will of the princess is first noticeable: Anna's father, Duke Frederick as namely the Pious and his council against the tenant of its choice objected because they were with him in feud, Anna leaned to the wish of the Duke not, but continued in respect of the lease. When Anna left Celle end in 1473 and the duchy of Brunswick, she had her five year old son in the care of her father and her sister Margarethe as the only female relatives. This was common for the children of a royal widow from her first marriage, and even legally binding. Finally, Henry was the only heir to the Duchy. What feelings they moved here, inevitably eludes our knowledge. Perhaps the great care that, decades later, her grandchildren brought against the Duchess, as read from their Hofrechnungen, something to do with this early farewell and her guilt over the son. As the young Duke witnessed his\n\n5. mother's departure, we do not know. The Charkater Duke Henry, who lived as a man on foot lavish and is described in the reports of his sons as irascible and violent, could have its roots in this early loss. Soon after her marriage to Count Philip of Katzenelnbogen on January 24, 1474 Anna was apparently at the mercy of a political intrigue of her father. One of the multiple murder accused priest, John of Bornich, testified at the instigation close confidant of the Landgrave of Hesse in January 1474, allegedly before the marriage, during a concelebrated by him in the chapel of Katzenelnbogen Rheinstein rock worship Anna a cup of poisoned wine enough to have. Under interrogation, accused John of Bornich especially Hans von Dörnberg, the steward of the Hessian Landgrave. The country was the county of Hesse instance, would fall on the home Katzelnbogen, and thus also beneficiary of Philip heirless death and of premature death of the Duchess. Anna noticed that the wine was cloudy, whereupon Johann answer tete, which might have inflicted birds or worms, or it might have been cut ginger into the cup. After Anna had drunk of the wine, was ill; apparently they had been poisoned. What seems certain is only that they suffered from a fever and recovered quickly. The attending doctor found no signs of poisoning.

Landgrave Ludwig of Hesse and Count Philipp von Katzenelnbogen close in considering the long friendship that has prevailed between them and their parents so far, to their further consolidation following Eheberedung between their children: Landgraf Heinrich of Hesse, Landgrave Ludwig's son, to the Countess Anna of Katzenelnbogen, Count Philip's daughter, and no other marriage, provided they remain alive. The same promises Count Philipp vice versa for his daughter Anna. If this is turned 12 years old, she should be married according to the custom of the Church with Landgraf Heinrich by a priest. Count Philipp promises with the consent of his son Philip, his daughter a dowry of 36,000 fl. FrWr. mitzugeben, namely, when Anna is sent to the marriage nuptials, 16,000 fl., while the remaining 20,000 fl. Philipps her to be paid within one year by the young\n\n6. Count Philipp after the death of Count. If Count Philip dies before the nuptials, the 16,000 fl. Dowry should be handed in within a year Driedorf to the Landgrave. Count Philipp committed to securitize the remaining 20,000 fl. Of his daughter after the nuptials so and to guarantee that it is safe the money even after his death and they can get within a year there then. Has Anna with the Landgrave no children, this is after the death of Anna's 36,000 fl own life sentence. after his death it shall revert to the young Count Philipp. Do they have children, the 36,000 fl. There shall fall where they belong according to the custom and tradition of the state of Hesse. Landgraf Ludwig and his son Heinrich undertake, the dowry ensure after the nuptials so that the counts of Katzenelnbogen in the event that he should fall, knowing who to which cities to keep them after Landgrave Henry's death. The nuptials will take place next May over 11 years. If Count Philipp his daughter ends at Landgraf Heinrich, they must equip so, as befits a princess with clothes, jewels and silver work. To nuptials the Landgrave Anna to the locks casting and Biedenkopf, castles and cities, with all the accessories of people, villages, duties, pensions, interest and gradients, outrages, fines, courts, woods, fields, waters, pastures, wild Bannen and fisheries as Wittume instruct them so that Anna's death for life holds unpledged and straight sets by Landgrave Henry. After her death, both locks will revert to the Hessian princes. This Wittum you must certify to the Landgrave nuptials in the usual manner, and Anna is to assure them a document that both locks come after her death back in the state of Hesse, whereupon they must also all officers, which she uses there commit. If parts of the two locks are fief, the Landgrave have to obtain the approval by the feudal lords to this Wittumsverschreibung. Anna is belonging to two locks people not higher than herkommensgemäß appreciate and complain, but they get in their tradition and protect. After the nuptials Landgraf Heinrich is giving his wife a dowry, as befits him as a prince. After the death of Landgrave Henry his heirs Anna are in undisturbed possession of their Wittums, her dowry and whatever else they receive from their parents, protect and otherwise allow anyone to harm it. Anna on the other hand should be satisfied with Wittum and dowry and make no further claims to the princes of Hessen. With the debt that makes the Landgrave in his lifetime or after his death leaves behind, it has nothing to do. You may not harm their castles from the reign Hesse, these are rather the Landgrave open in an emergency. Are you some citizens or sub Assen disobedient, the Landgrave must stop to obedience. Is this without success, Anna can seize the disobedient, but without prejudice to the rights of the Hessian rule. What Anna brings to the jewels or what is given to her and after Landgrave Henry finds to household goods in two castles death, her remains, but can you leave the household after her death in both castles. Anna and Henry have on Anna's paternal and maternal inheritance, it is mortgage shank or betting shaft, and all the earth, who have the counts of Katznelnbogen currently or win yet, will provide a complete, notarized and sealed waiver, even before the nuptials, and be satisfied. with 36,000 fl, unless that the counts of Katzenelnbogen extinct and is not born of the County of Katzenelnbogen male heir longer there. For this case, Anna reserves its rights to the county. If Count Philip is his daughter still go to something, it should also remain their. Will Anna after the death of any married Landgrave Henry again, the Landgrave can replace the locks and casting Biedenkopf with the amount that has been awarded the Landgrave Heinrich for dowry. Did she Landgrave Heinrich children, is to fall back on\n\n7. the state of Hesse after her death this money; she has no children with him, it falls to the Counts of Katzenelnbogen. The Landgrave Ludwig and Heinrich von Hessen and the Count Philip Elder and D. J. of Katzenelnbogen promise with a handshake under oath to keep all these points inviolable and nothing to do about it or to cause. On the breach of this promise of marriage is a fine of 20,000 fl., For which the Landgrave their locks Blankenstein and church grove and the Count put their locks Darmstadt and clean home for a pledge. If a party does not comply this marriage vows, which used locks the other party expire until the marriage is consummated or 20,000 fl. Have been paid. Then the officers, guards, porters, citizens and inhabitants of the said locks should be required. With the marriage consummation, these mortgage settlement goes out. In future no bailiff, sheriff, waiter, watchman, porter or keeper more may be used in these locks, which has not been committed to this agreement, he shall renew the prescription under his own seal.

The Edelfreien of Katzenelnbogen who called themselves since 1138 following its castle built around 1095 Katzenelnbogen are attested in the St. Goar since the late 11th century as Untervögte the Counts of Arnstein. The Arnstein held the bailiwick over the possession of the abbey of Prüm. How influential the family was already shown by the fact that Henry II. Of Katzenelnbogen († 1160) by King Konrad III. as count (comes) was raised to the imperial counts. Your original possession in Kraichgau they forfeit, but they manage along with the Count of Nassau in 1160 to win the county on the Einrich. As the Arnstein became extinct in 1185, entered the Katzenelnbogen in St. Goar in the right position and they managed to quickly expand the ownership of the Rhine to territorial sovereignty. Members of the family took an influential positions, such as bishops in Osnabrück and Münster or as a counselor and \"officials\" of several kings. Seven members of the Graf house undertook journeys to the Orient or participated in Crusades. Rhine Castle Rock To secure their dominions arose after 1245 instead of an earlier castle in the valley of the Rhine rock fortress on St. Goar. Rhine rock was in the 13th century was known as a hotbed of art and culture, the court festivals celebrated there were widely praised. 1276 acquired the Graf house the isenburgische \"Hausen apud sanctum Goarem\" that is mentioned since 1313 St.Goarshausen and in the 14th century by the construction of two castles, Burg Reichenberg in Hasenbachtal and Burg Katz (Neukatzenelnbogen) reinforced the fortifications with Rhine rock. In 1260, the county was divided into two areas, in a Obergrafschaft (younger line) with Darmstadt, clean home, Lichtenberg, Auerbach, forcing mountain, Dornsberg and Rüsselsheim and in a lower county (older line) with the reference locations\n\n13. Katzenelnbogen, Hohenstein, Braubach, Reichenberg , Burgschwalbach, New Katzenelnbogen and Rhine rock / St. Goar. About the marriage of Countess Anna (elder line) with Count John IV. (Younger line) were both lines reunited in 1402. Great wealth, the Earls of Katzeneinbogen came by a brisk trade policy and the acquisition of several inches sites on the Rhine, such as. Gernsheim, Mainz, Kaub, St. Goar, Boppard, Oberlahnstein, Linz, Bonn and Dusseldorf. The county was organizationally well positioned. Three Country writings formed the infrastructure with 24 winery districts. Added to this was the customs paperwork St. Goar. 16 castles, Braubach, Schwalbach, Katzenelnbogen, Hohenstein, Reichenberg, Reinfelsdorf, New Katzenelnbogen, Rüsselsheim, Stadecken, Dornsberg, Darmstadt Clean Home Lichtenberg, Rodensteinstrasse, forcing mountain and Auerbach were in sole possession of the Graf house and secured possession and rights. How rich and powerful was the Graf house, shows, among other things the fact that the Rhenish archbishops were often in debt to them. In 1453 Philipp Graf took the Elder of Katzenelnbogen the financial collapse of the Lords of Eppstein to acquire parts of the county Diez and the rule of Eppstein. To after the death of his sons and Philipp Eberhard the Younger to prevent the devolution of the region of the empire to the empire, rendered Count Philip Elder with the consent of the King County to the husband of his only daughter. Anna of Katzenelnbogen was with Landgraf Heinrich III. of Hesse married and so the county went to the death of the last Katzenelnbogeners on July 28, 1479 to the Landgrave of Hesse-Marburg. With this inheritance the house Hesse established his political and economic advancement. The County of Katzenelnbogen (named after Chatti Melibokus) was an immediate state of the Holy Roman Empire. It existed between 1095 and 1479, when it was inherited by the Landgraves of Hesse.\n\n14. Katzenelnbogen Castle The estate comprised two separate territories. The main parts were the original Untergrafschaft (\"lower county\") with its capital atKatzenelnbogen in the Middle Rhinearea and the Obergrafschaft (\"upper county\") south of the Main River around Darmstadt, predecessor of the Landgraviate of Hesse- Darmstadt. History[edit] One Diether I of Katzenelnbogen (circa 1065–95), then serving as Vogt of Prüm Abbey, was first mentioned about 1070 in a deed issued by Archbishop Anno II of Cologne. From 1094 onwards, Diether and his son Henry I built KatzenelnbogenCastle in the Taunus mountain range; in 1138, King Conrad III of Germany vested his grandson Henry II with the comital title, when the Kraichgau was bequested to him. The counts also builtBurg Rheinfels and Auerbach Castle in the 13th century and finished Burg Katz in 1371, they rebuilt the Marksburg purchased from the Lords of Eppstein and acquired highly lucrative customs rights on the Rhine River. In almost four centuries, the county grew bit by bit, from the Neckar to the Moselle Rivers.\n\n15. The counts founded many cities, and for centuries or decades, they owned others, such as Offenbach, Gießen, Diez andLimburg. They also contributed to the enlargement of Eberbach Abbey, which became their family tomb in the 14th century. After the early death of Count Philipp's only son in 1453, he called himself Count of Katzenelnbogen-Diez. When Philipp died in 1479, the male line of the Katzenelnbogens became extinct. TheObergrafschaft was passed to the Landgraves of Hesse by virtue of the 1458 marriage of Henry III of Upper Hesse to Count Philipp's daughter Anna of Katzenelnbogen. Thereafter, the Landgraves of Hesse added to their title \"Count of Katzenelnbogen\". History of wine[edit] In 1435, Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen was building his last castle in Rüsselsheim, where he ordered the famous Riesling variety should be grown. This is the first documentation of the grape in history. Hundreds of vineyards were documented, many of which still exist: among them the famous rock Loreley documented in 1395. n 1435, Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen was building his last castle in Rüsselsheim, where he ordered the famous Riesling variety should be grown. This is the first documentation of the grape in history. Hundreds of vineyards were documented, many of which still exist: among them the famous rock Loreley documented in 1395. The southwest of Limburg an der Lahn located castle Katzenelnbogen built around 1095, after which since 1138 called the Counts of Katzenelnbogen. They have family ties with the Swabians. You have advocacies Abbey Prüm and Siegburg and the archbishopric of Mainz in the area south of the Lahn. Your original possession in Kraichgau they lose, but can with the Count of Nassau in 1160 to purchase the county on the Einrich. The members of the family are very influential because of their family ties to the Hohenstaufen and put bishops in Osnabrück and Münster. The brothers Hermann - Diplomat in services Barbarossa - and Diether chancellor of Henry VI. are successful in national politics.\n\n16. To 1185 they get to St. Goar with the Rhine and customs since the 12th century Würzburg fief for large-Gerau and Darmstadt. In the following period, during the interregnum, they are to imperial 1249 at Trebur and 1255 in Dreieich. The gender split in 1260 into two lines, whose possession of the Odenwald to the Lahn enough, both lines have possession throughout the county. Count William I (1276/77 - 1331) from the older line prevents further fragmentation before the introduction of primogeniture. As a result, members of the Graf house again occupy important positions in the kingdom and strengthen their position further within the region. 1402, the two lines are reunited. By the proceeds from the Rhine duties they go to great prosperity. Their economic power they prove as the main creditor of the Rhenish archbishops. In 1422 they founded the Wetterau Association. 1453 they use the financial collapse of Eppsteiner Counts in the county Diez and to take 1457 in the Wetterau foot. 1479 drops the county Katzenelnbogen by the heiress of Philip the Elder to his son- Landgraf Heinrich III. of Hesse, after giving long dispute with Jülich Berg (until 1520) and Nassau, the Hessian is replaced by the proportion of the county Diez and 450,000 guilders. Continuation - The reign of Philip the Magnanimous In the division of an estate in 1567, after the death of Philip the Magnanimous, the Upper County falls to George, who founded the line of Hesse-Darmstadt. The Lower County Katzenelnbogen goes first to Philip as Hesse Rhine-rock, but already in 1583 the dies and is inherited largely from Hessen Kassel. From then on the county Katzenelnbogen shares the fate of Hesse, which is mainly characterized by the inheritance dispute between Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt in the 17th century. The majority of the lower county, except for the offices Braubach and Katzenelnbogen belonging to Hesse-Darmstadt, remains at the Hesse-Kassel and shares their story. The Upper County is the origin of Hesse-Darmstadt. Continuation - The 30 Years War Continuation - Hesse-Kassel from 1650 to today 1815 is the lower county to the Duchy of Nassau Hesse-Darmstadt, including areas and falls to Prussia in 1866 and 1945 comes to Hesse. sources: Sante, Wilhelm.
