        "text": "The panel aims to explore the relationship between travel, memory and travel accounts. Memory is a powerful tool, enabling the traveller to preserve and relive ones' experience from a journey and also becomes an important source for travel accounts. The first session of the panel focuses on the relationship between personal (in)experience of travel, memories of travel and travel writing. Paper a) Rebecca Lawton, Remembering pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem: Analysing eye witness testimony in early medieval topographical texts and travel accounts Paper abstract: Through memory pilgrims shared their experience with those who many never make the journey themselves. The eye witness experience of the original pilgrim lies at the heart of pilgrim itineraries and syllogae collections of inscriptions from Rome. It is also at the forefront of how travel is recorded in the accounts of pilgrimage to Jerusalem, namely the 'Hodoeporicon' of St Willibrord and Adomnan's De Locis Santis. This paper seeks to analyse how eye witness testimony is presented in these travel texts and its impact on the reader. This discussion aims to understand how the memory of the original pilgrim experience, accessed via eye witness testimony, gave the readers their own experience of pilgrimage to these holy places. Paper b) Felicitas Schmieder, Il Milione-Marco Polo's travel memories? Paper abstract: Marco Polo's Milione is certainly one of the most famous medieval travel reports â€“ but the text(s) we possess of it have neither been written by Marco himself nor by another traveller. The success the Milione had resulted in translations into several languages, some of them going hand in hand with quite considerable redactions, and the text or parts of it were put in many different contexts none of which left the text completely untouched. So on"
