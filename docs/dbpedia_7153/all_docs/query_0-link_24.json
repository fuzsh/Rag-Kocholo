        "text": "Friedrich was born in mid-December 1122 in Haguenau, to Duke Friedrich II of Swabia and Princess Judith of Bavaria, the eldest daughter of Duke Heinrich IX of Bavaria and Princess Wulfhilde of Saxony, daughter of Duke Magnus of Saxony and Princess Sophia of Hungary, and thereby a member of the powerful German House of Welf.\n\nBy inheritance Friedrich was Duke Friedrich III of Swabia (1147–1152, as Frederick III) before his Imperial Election in 1152.\n\nHis father was from the Hohenstaufen family, and his mother was from the Welf family, the two most powerful families in Germany. The Hohenstaufens were often called Ghibellines, which derives from the Italianized name for Waiblingen castle, the family seat in Swabia; the Welfs, in a similar Italianization, were called Guelphs.\n\nFriedrich was also a descendant of the Salian dynasty through his paternal grandmother Agnes of Waiblingen as she was the daughter of Emperor Heinrich IV and Bertha of Savoy.\n\nHe also had ties to the Salians through his mother Judith of Bavaria as she descended from Emperor Otto II and his wife Theophanu. Therefore, Friedrich carried on the bloodline of Emperor Otto I the Great and his wives, Eadgyth of England and Adelaide of Italy. He learned to ride, hunt and use weapons at an early age, but could neither read nor write, and was also unable to speak the Latin language until later in life.\n\nBecause of his descent from the two leading families in the Empire, that him an acceptable choice for the Empire’s prince-electors.\n\nFriedrich was elected King of the Romans-Germany in Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152.\n\nFriedrich was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia, and on June 18, 1155 he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV in Rome. Emperor Friedrich was Emperor until his death 35 years later in 1190.\n\nTwo years later, the term sacrum (“holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his Empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178.\n\nHe was named Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which in English means “Emperor Redbeard.” The prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns to his career.\n\nPhilipp of Swabia (February/March 1177 – June 21, 1208) was a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and King of the Romans/Germans from 1198 until his assassination.\n\nPhilipp was born in or near Pavia in the Imperial Kingdom of Italy as the tenth child and eighth (but fifth and youngest surviving) son of Friedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy, the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine.\n\nHis paternal family was the noble House of Hohenstaufen, the name given to the dynasty by historians since the 15th century. The origins of the family are still unclear today; the ancestors on the paternal side were minor nobles and their names have not been preserved. All that is known about Barbarossa’s great-grandfather Friedrich of Büren is that he married a woman named Hildegard (whose own parentage was disputed: she was a member of either the Comital family of Egisheim–Dagsburg or the obscure Schlettstadt family).\n\nA few years ago it was assumed that the Schlettstadt property did not belong to Hildegard but to her husband himself and the Hohenstaufen were therefore not a Swabian but an Alsatian family. It wasn’t until around 1100 that the family under Duke Friedrich I of Swabia located into the East Swabian Rems valley.\n\nThe death of Philip’s older brother Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1197 meant that the Hohenstaufen rule (which reached as far as the Kingdom of Sicily) collapsed in imperial Italy and created a power vacuum to the north of the Alps. Reservations about the kingship of Heinrich’s underage son, Friedrich, led to two royal elections in 1198, which resulted in the German throne dispute: the two elected kings, Philipp of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, claimed the throne for themselves,\n\nOtto was the third son of Heinrich XII the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Duke of Saxony, by his wife Matilda of England, third child and eldest daughter of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine Otto’s exact birthplace is not given by any original source. He grew up in England in the care of his maternal grandfather, King Henry II of England.\n\nBoth opponents tried in the following years through European and papal support, with the help of money and gifts, through demonstrative public appearances and rituals, to decide the conflict for oneself by raising ranks or by military and diplomatic measures. Philipp was able to increasingly assert his kingship against Otto in the north part of the Alps.\n\nMarriage\n\nIrene Angelina of Byzantium (c. 1181 – August 27, 1208) was a Byzantine princess and member of the Angelos dynasty and by her two marriages Queen of Sicily in 1193 and Queen of the Romans/Germans from 1198 to 1208.\n\nIrene was born in Constantinople, the second daughter of Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos and his first wife, quite possibly an unknown Palaiologina with a non-Greek mother, who became a nun with the name Irene.\n\nIn 1193 her father and King Tancred of Sicily arranged Irene’s marriage with Tancred’s eldest son, Roger. Her husband was declared co-king, but he died on December 24, 1193, shortly before his father’s death on February 20, 1194. Sicily was claimed by Tancred’s aunt Constance and her husband, Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich VI. Irene was captured December 29, 1194 during the conquest of Sicily. To improve relationships with the Byzantine Empire, in April 1195 Henry VI betrothed Philip to Irene Angelina.\n\nShe was married on May 25, 1197 to Henry’s younger brother, Duke Philip of Swabia, and took the name Maria. After the Emperor Heinrich VI had died on September 28, Philipp was elected King of the Romans in Mühlhausen on March 8, 1198. Queen Irene’s father, who had been deposed in 1195, urged her to get Philip’s support for his reinstatement. Irene Angelina was renamed Maria upon her wedding.\n\nAssassination\n\nSince the end of May 1208, Philip had been preparing for a campaign against Otto IV and his allies. He interrupted the planning to attend the wedding of his niece Countess Beatrice II of Burgundy with Duke Otto of Merania on June 21, 1208 in Bamberg. After the marriage, the King retired to his private apartments. In the afternoon he was murdered by Count Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. After the murder, Count Otto VIII was able to flee with his followers. Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and his brother, Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, were suspected of having known about the plans. Other medieval historians expressed doubts about complicity or ignored other possible perpetrators.\n\nFor the first time since the end of the Merovingian dynasty a king had been murdered. Besides Albert I of Habsburg (1308), Philip is the only Roman-German ruler to be assassinated. No chronicler witnessed the murder. In contemporary sources there is little agreement about the course of the murder. Most medieval chroniclers saw the withdrawal of the promise of marriage as a motive for murder. Even in distant Piacenza, Philip’s murder was still associated with a failed marriage project. Allegedly the Wittelsbach scion, already known for his unstable character, had fallen into a rage when he learned of the dissolution of his betrothal to Gertrude of Silesia by her father, the Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded, who was apparently informed of Count Otto VIII’s cruel tendencies and in an act of concern for his young daughter decided to terminate the marriage agreement.\n\nLater, after an unfortunate campaign to Thuringia, Philipp had betrothed his third daughter Kunigunde to Count Otto VIII in the summer of 1203 in order to make him a reliable ally in the fight against Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In the following years Philipp increasingly succeeded in gaining acceptance for his kingship, so the betrothal with the Wittelsbach became without purpose to him; in November 1207 the King engaged Kunigunde to Wenceslaus, son and heir of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, on the Hoftag in Augsburg. Philipp hoped that this alliance would gain permanent support from Bohemia. For Count Otto VIII this behavior was an act of treason and also felt that his social status was threatened; he swore revenge on the German King, whom he blame for both spurned betrothals, culminating in the murder at Bamberg.\n\nSince historian Eduard Winkelmann’s careful analysis in the 19th century, research has assumed that Otto VIII of Wittelsbach acted as a lone perpetrator. In contrast, historian Bernd Ulrich Hucker made a “comprehensive conspiratorial plan” in 1998 and suspected a “coup d’état”. The Andechs Dukes of Merania, King Philippe II of France and Duke Henry I of Brabant should have been involved in this comprehensive plot; allegedly, the conspirators had planned to put the Duke of Brabant on the German throne. But Hucker’s coup hypothesis did not prevail. It remains to be seen what use the French king would have had from the removal of Philipp and his replacement by the Duke of Brabant. The House of Andechs, as loyal followers of Philipp, who often stayed at his court and were protected by him, had no interest in his death.\n\nAftermath\n\nPhilipp was initially buried in Bamberg Cathedral, the burial place of Emperor Heinrich II and King Conrad III. His rival Otto IV let the assassins be persecuted relentlessly and wanted to prove his innocence. Only the Annales Pegaviensis (chronicle of the Pegau Abbey) held Otto IV’s supporters responsible for the murder. Philip’s widow, Irene-Maria, pregnant at that time, took refuge in Hohenstaufen Castle, dying only two months after the Bamberg regicide as a result of a miscarriage.\n\nAfter Philip’s death, Otto IV quickly prevailed against the remaining Hohenstaufen supporters, was acknowledged as German monarch at an Imperial Diet in Frankfurt in November 1208 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year. For the new fully recognized German King, the most important goal was to restore order in the realm. A Landfrieden was established for this purpose and the Imperial ban on Philipp’s murderer and alleged accomplices, the Andechs brothers Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, was imposed.\n\nAs a result, they lost all offices, rights and property. In addition, Otto IV’s engagement to Beatrix, Philipp’s eldest daughter, was agreed. Philipp’s murderer Otto VIII of Wittelsbach (now condemned as vogelfrei) was found in March 1209 by Reichsmarschall Heinrich of Kalden in a granary on the Danube near Regensburg and beheaded. The Andechs brothers, however, were politically rehabilitated three years later.\n\nPhilipp was the first German king to be murdered during his reign. In posterity, Philip is one of the little-noticed Hohenstaufen rulers.\n\nFriedrich I, Barbarossa (1122 – 10 June 1190) was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1155 until his death 35 years later. He was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152. He was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia and emperor by Pope Adrian IV on June 18, 1155 in Rome.\n\nTwo years later, the term sacrum (“holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178. He was named Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which means “Emperor Redbeard” in English.\n\nThe prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns to his career.\n\nFriedrich was born in mid-December 1122 in Haguenau, to Friedrich II, Duke of Swabia and Judith of Bavaria. He learned to ride, hunt and use weapons, but could neither read nor write, and was also unable to speak the Latin language. Later on, he took part in the Hoftage during the reign of his uncle, King Conrad III, in 1141 in Strasbourg, 1142 in Konstanz, 1143 in Ulm, 1144 in Würzburg and 1145 in Worms.\n\nBefore his imperial election, Friedrich was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147–1152, as Friedrich III). He was the son of Duke Friedrich II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Judith of Bavaria, daughter of Heinrich IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf. Friedrich, therefore, descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire’s prince-electors.\n\nWhen Conrad III died in February 1152, only Friedrich and the prince-bishop of Bamberg were at his deathbed. Both asserted afterwards that Conrad III had, in full possession of his mental powers, handed the royal insignia to Friedrich and indicated that Friedrich rather than Conrad III’s own six-year-old son, the future Friedrich IV, Duke of Swabia, succeed him as king.\n\nFriedrich energetically pursued the crown and at Frankfurt on March 4,1152 the kingdom’s princely electors designated him as the next German king.\n\nHe was crowned King of the Romans at Aachen several days later, on March 9, 1152. Friedrich’s father was from the Hohenstaufen family, and his mother was from the Welf family, the two most powerful families in Germany. The Hohenstaufens were often called Ghibellines, which derives from the Italianized name for Waiblingen castle, the family seat in Swabia; the Welfs, in a similar Italianization, were called Guelfs.\n\nThere, Pope Adrian IV was struggling with the forces of the republican city commune led by Arnold of Brescia, a student of Abelard. As a sign of good faith, Friedrich dismissed the ambassadors from the revived Roman Senate, and Imperial forces suppressed the republicans. Arnold was captured and hanged for treason and rebellion. Despite his unorthodox teaching concerning theology, Arnold was not charged with heresy.\n\nAs Friedrich approached the gates of Rome, the Pope advanced to meet him. At the royal tent the king received him, and after kissing the pope’s feet, Friedrich expected to receive the traditional kiss of peace.\n\nFriedrich had declined to hold the Pope Adrian IV’s stirrup while leading him to the tent, however, so Adrian refused to give the kiss until this protocol had been complied with. Friedrich hesitated, and Adrian IV withdrew; after a day’s negotiation, Friedrich agreed to perform the required ritual, reportedly muttering, “Pro Petro, non Adriano — For Peter, not for Adrian.”\n\nRome was still in an uproar over the fate of Arnold of Brescia, so rather than marching through the streets of Rome, Friedrich and Adrian retired to the Vatican.\n\nThe next day, June 18, 1155, Adrian IV crowned Friedrich I Holy Roman Emperor at St Peter’s Basilica, amidst the acclamations of the German army.\n\nThe Romans began to riot, and Frederick spent his coronation day putting down the revolt, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Romans and many more thousands injured.\n\nThe next day, Friedrich, Adrian IV, and the German army travelled to Tivoli. From there, a combination of the unhealthy Italian summer and the effects of his year-long absence from Germany meant he was forced to put off his planned campaign against the Normans of Sicily.\n\nOn June 9, 1156 at Würzburg, Friedrich married Beatrice of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Renaud III, thus adding to his possessions the sizeable realm of the County of Burgundy.\n\nIn an attempt to create comity, Emperor Friedrich proclaimed the Peace of the Land, written between 1152 and 1157, which enacted punishments for a variety of crimes, as well as systems for adjudicating many disputes. He also declared himself the sole Augustus of the Roman world, ceasing to recognise Manuel I as Roman (Byzantine) Emperor at Constantinople.\n\nThe Crown of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia is number 8 on my list of favorite Crowns.\n\nThe Prussian Crown Jewels is the royal regalia, consisting of two crowns, an orb and a sceptre, used during the coronation of the monarchs of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nPrussian Crown Jewels\n\nAfter the King of Prussia became German Emperor on the establishment of the German Empire on January 18, 1871, they were no longer used as the position of King of Prussia while still remaining, was a title of minor importance compared to the new role as German Emperor. This was one of the fears King Wilhelm I of Prussia had with becoming German Emperor. He held much pride in being King of Prussia and did not have much enthusiasm for being an emperor.\n\nThere was no crown for the German Empire, although a heraldic version existed in the form of a German State Crown.\n\nWooden model of the Imperial Crown\n\nIn 1871 a design and a model for a new state crown were created to reflect the new German Empire. The model was based upon the Crown of the Holy Roman Empire and was kept in the Hohenzollern museum at Schloss Monbijou in Berlin, until it disappeared during World War II. It has never re-surfaced. No final crown was ever made. However, the design was used as a heraldic device for the German Emperors from 1871 until Emperor Wilhelm II’s abdication in 1918. The crown was mostly used as an heraldic symbol in the German coat of arms and the Emperor’s personal standard.\n\nCrown of Wilhelm II of Prussia\n\nTo many intellectuals, the coronation of Wilhelm I was associated with the restoration of the Holy Roman Empire. Felix Dahn wrote a poem, “Macte senex Imperator” (Hail thee, old emperor) in which he nicknamed Wilhelm Barbablanca (whitebeard), a play on the name of the medieval Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa (redbeard). According to the King asleep in mountain legend, Barbarossa slept under the Kyffhäuser mountain until Germany had need of him. William I was thus portrayed as a second coming of Barbarossa. The Kyffhäuser Monument portrays both emperors.\n\nIn contrast with the lavish, heavily bejewelled crowns of other monarchies (e.g. British, Russian), the Prussian crown jewels were sometimes described as “rather plain”.\n\nThe Prussian regalia includes:\n\n* Crown of William II (1889), or the Hohenzollern Crown, is the only piece dating from the imperial period, but is very similar to older crowns.\n\nIn the absence of further state regalia for the German Empire (1871–1918), the older royal Prussian Crown Jewels were sometimes also regarded as the German Crown Jewels:\n\n* Crown of Frederick I (1701)\n\n* Crown of Sophie Charlotte (1701)\n\n* Royal Sceptre of Frederick I (1701)\n\n* Royal Orb of Frederick I (1701)\n\nPrussia became a part of the German Empire in 1871 and its king also became German emperor. The German Empire became a republic in 1918 and, at the same time, Prussia became part of the federal republic. Most of the Prussian regalia are on public display in the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin.\n\nCrown of Wilhelm II of Prussia\n\nThe Crown of Wilhelm II, in his role as King of Prussia, is kept at Hohenzollern Castle near Hechingen in Baden-Württemberg. The Crown of Wilhelm II, also known as the Hohenzollern Crown, is the 1888 crown made for Wilhelm II, German Emperor, in his role as King of Prussia. It was only used for heraldic purposes.\n\nThe crown is surmounted by a diamond-studded cross which rests on a large sapphire. These rest on eight half-arches rising from the base that are adorned with 142 rose-cut diamonds and 18 diamonds. Eight large pearls are mounted between the arches.\n\nWhen William abdicated in 1918 he was permitted to retain the crown and it’s jewels, which included the Hohenzollern crown. To protect it from theft and destruction during World War II, it was hidden in a wall in the crypt of a church. After the war it was returned to the Hohenzollern family and is now kept at the family residence of the Hohenzollern Castle.\n\nHere is the Crown of King Friedrich I of Prussia. His crown was used in his coronation and the coronation of subsequent Kings of Prussia. It isn’t a favorite Crown at all, I find it father dull looking, but I do find it interesting.\n\nCrown of Friedrich I of Prussia\n\nKing Friedrich I of Prussia first, was Friedrich III, Elector of Brandenburg (1688–1713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (1701–1713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel (German: Fürstentum Neuenburg). He was also the paternal grandfather of Friedrich II the Great.\n\nThe Crown of Friedrich I, was made by the Court Jewellers for Friedrich I of Prussia in 1701, who crowned himself and his wife Sophie-Charlotte in a baroque ceremony at Königsberg Castle, Königsberg. The crown was also used for the coronation of Friedrich-Wilhelm I and his son, Friedrich II (better known as Friedrich the Great). He was a very frugal monarch, and although the crown was present at his coronation, he did not wear it.\n\nThe crown along with most of the Prussian royal regalia is kept at Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa (1122 – June 10, 1190), was the Holy Roman Emperor from January 2, 1155 until his death. He was elected King of the Germans at Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152. He was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia and emperor by Pope Adrian IV on June 18, 1155 in Rome. Two years later, the term sacrum (“holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178. He was named Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which has the same meaning.\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa\n\nBefore his imperial election, he was by inheritance Friedrich III, Duke of Swabia (1147–1152). He was the son of Duke Friedrich II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Judith, daughter of Heinrich IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Guelph. Friedrich, therefore, descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire’s prince-electors.\n\nFriedrich’s first wife Adelaide was a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold III of Vohburg (c. 1079 – 1146), probably from his first marriage with Adelaide (c. 1091 – 1127), a daughter of the Polish duke Władysław I Herman and Judith of Swabia. Since the days of Emperor Heinrich IV, her father’s ancestors ruled over the Egerland territory in the Bavarian March of the Nordgau, which, however, was seized by King Conrad III of Germany upon the margrave’s death in 1146.\n\nAdelaide and Friedrich’s marriage was not successful, however. According to some later sources, this was because Adelaide committed adultery. The couple remained childless. In 1153 Friedrich petitioned Pope Eugene III for an annulment. The separation was granted and confirmed by the Bishop of Constance in March 1153; the justification given on grounds of consanguinity. Friedrich immediately began to court the Byzantine princess Maria Komnena, though to no avail. Maria was the youngest child of Isaac Komnenos, son of John II Komnenos and elder brother of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and Isaacʻs first wife, Theodora, great-granddaughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nFriedrich’s second wife was Beatrice I (1143 – 15 November 1184) the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine. As the only child of her father, she was the heir of the County of Burgundy. At the death of her father in 1148, she inherited the vast County of Burgundy and became countess palatine in her own right. As such, she was one of the most desired brides in France, and a marriage was suggested to Emperor Frederick I.\n\nThe wedding between Beatrice and Friedrich took on June 9, 1156 at Würzburg. After the wedding, the Bishop of Trier anointed Beatrice queen. She was crowned empress by Antipope Paschal III in Rome on August 1, 1167, and as Queen of Burgundy at Vienne in August 1178.\n\nHoly Roman Empire during the reign of Friedrich I Barbarossa\n\nThe relationship between Beatrice and Friedrich is traditionally described as happy, and there is nothing to indicate that he was ever unfaithful to her. Though Beatrice was rumored to be greatly loved by Friedrich and thereby attributed influence over him in the sense that he had great affection for her, there is nothing to indicate that she acted as his political adviser and she is confirmed to be directly involved in a major political affair only once. In 1168 supported the election of bishop Peter of Cambrai and at successfully blocked the attempt of the archbishop Philip to transfer the bishopric of Cambrai from the metropolitan province of Riems to Cologne, supported by archbishop Christian of Mainz and Heinrich III-IV the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, this was reputedly the only case Beatrice took decisive action in a major political affair.\n\nThe couple had 11 children including Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, (1165 – 1197)\n\nHistorians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire’s greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity. His contributions to Central European society and culture include the reestablishment of the Corpus Juris Civilis, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the Investiture Controversy.\n\nFriedrich fought in the Third Crusade and on June 10, 1190, Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa drowned near Silifke Castle in the Saleph river. There are several conflicting accounts of the event. According to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Friedrich was thrown from his horse and the shock of the cold water caused him to have a heart attack. Weighed down by his armour, he drowned.\n\nI want to take a step back and look at another line of ancestors of Henry VII. The line in question stems from Lady Margaret Holland, Grandmother of Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond who was the mother of King Henry VII.\n\nHenry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland\n\nMargaret Holland (1385 – December 30, 1439) was a medieval English noblewoman. She was a daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, who was the son of Joan “the Fair Maid of Kent” (herself a granddaughter of Edward I of England, wife of Edward the Black Prince and mother of Richard II of England). Margaret’s mother was Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster.\n\nMargaret Holland’s mother was Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster. Eleanor of Lancaster was a great-granddaughter of Henry III of England (1216-1272) via his second son Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster. Margaret Holland’s great-grandmother was Maria of Hohenstaufen (April 3, 1201 – March 29, 1235) she was a member of the powerful Hohenstaufen dynasty of German kings and Holy Roman Emperors which lasted from 1138 to 1254. She is also known to history as Marie of Swabia. Maria herself was a granddaughter of the great Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich I (1152-1190), also known as Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Friedrich I (1152-1190), also known as Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nHistorians consider Friedrich I among the Holy Roman Empire’s greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity. His contributions to Central European society and culture include the reestablishment of the Corpus Juris Civilis, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the Investiture Controversy (a conflict between church and state in medieval Europe over the ability to appoint local church officials through investiture. By undercutting imperial power, the controversy led to nearly 50 years of civil war in the Empire.\n\nMargaret Holland’s Maternal grandfather, Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, was a member of the FitzAlan family. The FitzAlan family shared a common patrilinear ancestry with the Scots, and later English, royal dynasty, the House of Stuart. They are therefore also related to the current British royal family. They were descendants of the Bretonknight Alan fitz Flaad (d. 1120) grandson of the Seneschal of the Bishop of Dol. The FitzAlans held the earldom of Arundel during the period 1267 – 1580.\n\nA FitzAlan descendant, Alan fitz Walter (1140–1204) was hereditary High Steward of Scotland and a crusader. His son by his second marriage to Alesta, daughter of Morggán, Earl of Mar, was Walter, 3rd High Steward of Scotland, and it was he that adopted the surname Stewart and became the founder of The House of Stewart (Stuart).\n\nJoan of Kent\n\nMargaret Holland’s grandmother was Joan of Kent (September 29, 1328 – August 7, 1385), known to history as The Fair Maid of Kent. Joan was the daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, and Margaret Wake, 3rd Baroness Wake of Liddell. Her father Edmund was the son of King Edward I by his second wife, Margaret of France, daughter of Philippe III of France. This brings the descendants of Edward I’s second marriage into the Ancestry of Henry VII.\n\nThe marriages of Joan of Kent is rather complicated and the topic is worthy of a separate blog post. Joan’s third husband was Edward the Black Prince, eldest son and heir to King Edward III. Two sons were born to the royal couple. The elder son, named Edward (1365 – 1370) after his father and grandfather, died at the age of six. Their younger son, Richard, became King Richard II of England when his grandfather, Edward III, died on June 21, 1377. Richard’s father, the Black Prince had died in his bed at the Palace of Westminster June 7, 1376.\n\nDescendants of Joan of Kent through her children Lady Joan and Thomas Holland include Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby (mother of King Henry VII), and queens consort Anne Neville, Elizabeth of York, and Catherine Parr.\n\nThis concludes the MATERNAL ancestry of Henry VII of England. In the next entry in the series I will begin to examine the Royal Ancestry of Henry VII’s Paternal side, the Tudors.\n\nOtto I, the Great. Holy Roman Emperor, Duke of Saxony.\n\nAfter developing my love of royalty with my interest in the British monarchy my next fascination was with the German monarchies. The history of monarchy in Germany can make your head spin. We have the Carolingian Empire founded by Charlemagne, the Kingdom of Germany and then the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Historians are all over the map with these terms, some seeing all of these as one entity while others see them as three distinct entities. I think the truth is that what became the Holy Roman Empire was something that had evolved over time and has been connected to previous empires.\n\nOn Christmas day 800, Charles the Great (Charlemagne) was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III. His actual title was Imperator Romanorum, Emperor of the Romans. I recall one historian which I watched on TV discussing a biography of Charlemagne mention that his empire really did not have a name. He was supposed to have revived the Roman Empire in the West. The Eastern Roman Empire, or the Byzantine Empire as it was called, was still thriving in the year 800CE with Irene of Athens as the reigning Empress. However, today Charlemagne’s Empire is not seen as a continuation of the Roman Empire but the originator of a new Empire which eventually was called the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. This points to an interesting aspect of historiography; terms and labels that we are now familiar with were often inventions by later historians and placed retrospectively on the past. My mentioning of the Byzantine Empire is a good example. To its contemporaries the Byzantine Empire was known simply as the Roman Empire.\n\nCharlemagne’s empire was eventually dived up with the western half evolving into the Kingdom of France. The last Imperator Romanorum of Charlemagne’s empire, according to some historians, was Berengar of Friuli (c845-924) who ruled from 915 until his death in 924. Some historians count Arnulf of Carinthia (850-899) as the last official holder of the imperial title from 896 until his death in 899. The next definitive holder of the Imperial title would be Otto of Saxony (912-973) who was crowned Emperor on February 2, 962, by Pope John XII. Otto’s father, Heinrich the Fowler is numbered as Heinrich I among the Holy Roman Emperors despite never holding the imperial title. Heinrich the Fowler held the title Rex Teutonicorum “King of the Germans.” Reading on the history of the German Kingdom it looks as if several monarchs reigned at the same time. For example, Heinrich I’s immediate predecessor, Conrad I (890-918) who ruled as a German King from 911 until his death in 918 is also listed as a Holy Roman Emperor although he never held the imperial title.\n\nWith such confusion among historians over this time period (it still makes my head spin) it is easy to see how Otto can be called the first of the Holy Roman Emperors since it was the revival of his title which evolved into the Holy Roman Empire. The German aspect of the nation wouldn’t be emphasized until the end of the Hohenstaufen Dynasty under Conrad IV (1250-1254) when the Italian possessions of the empire were lost. It was also during the Hohenstaufen Dynasty when the term “Holy” was attached to the empire to signify its close association with the Church. Emperors were not considered to have adopted their office until officially crowned by the pope. As future emperors wanted to assert their own authority the papal coronation was done away with. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I adopted the title Erwählter Römischer Kaiser (Elected Roman Emperor) with approval of Pope Julius II, ending the custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the pope.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire continues to fascinate me and even the times which came after it . After looking at the complexities of its history I can agree with Voltaire’s famous description of the empire in his 1756 Essay on the Manner and Spirit of Nations and on the Principal Occurrences in History, that the Empire as “neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire.”\n\nCrown of the Holy Roman Emperors"
