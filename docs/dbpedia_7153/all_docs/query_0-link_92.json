        "text": "Comberford Appendix 1: The Beaumont family of Wednesbury\n\nA modern artistic impression of Wednesbury Manor ... a painting by D. Clarke now in the Sandwell Museums\n\nPatrick Comerford\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Comberford family of Comberford Hall might have remained a minor gentry and merchant family in South Staffordshire and remained a minor player in the commerce and politics of nearby Tamworth and Lichfield but for the wealth and large estates inherited through intermarriage with the Beaumont family of Wednesbury, This inheritance brought with it an increase in prosperity and in influence, and extended the ties of kinship with other powerful local families.\n\nWhen Thomas Comberford (ca 1472-1532) of Comberford married Dorothy, daughter of Ralph Fitzherbert of Norbury, he was already a progressive farmer and merchant, consolidating and extending his family’s interests in the political, ecclesiastical, social, economic and legal life in south Staffordshire. Dorothy Comberford’s brothers included the Revd Dr Thomas Fitzherbert, Precentor of Lichfield Cathedral, and the Revd Canon William Fitzherbert, Chancellor of Lichfield Cathedral, while her younger sister, Alice, was Abbess of Polesworth, five miles east of Tamworth. Polesworth Abbey traced its origins to Saint Editha of Tamworth, who gave her name to Saint Editha’s parish church.\n\nIn 1495, as M’r Thomas Cumberforth, he was admitted to membership of the Guild of Saint Mary and Saint John the Baptist in Lichfield.\n\nIn 1499, Thomas Comberford and David Rochford, a Lichfield mercer, leased the manor of Timmor for 12 years from John Beaumont. Timmor was a part of the Bishop of Chester’s manor of Lichfield (later Longdon) and so continued until at least 1739. When John Beaumont died in 1502, he had three surviving infant daughters who were his equal heirs.\n\nSaint Bartholomew’s Church, Wednesbury, in 1827 (Hackwood, facing p. 22)\n\nThomas Comberford may have had custody of the manor of Wednesbury during the minority of these three Beaumont daughters. By a partition of the inheritance in 1540-1541, Timmor, near Fisherwick and in the Parish of Saint Michael, Lichfield, was allotted to Joan, the eldest daughter, and her husband William Babington, of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire. They were the ancestors of Canon Zachary Babington, Chancellor of Lichfield Cathedral and Master of Saint John’s Hospital, Lichfield, whose grand-daughter Margaret married John Birch, one of the trustees of the Comberford estates in the 1650s. Eventually, this portion of the Beaumont estate passed to the Skeffington family of Fisherwick, who also became the owners of Comberford Hall in the 17th century.\n\nDorothy Beaumont, the second daughter and co-heir of John Beaumont, married Thomas Comberford’s son and heir, Humphrey Comberford, who then became the Lord of the Manor of Wednesbury. In Lichfield in 1530, as “Humfridus Cumberforde,” he was the Master of the Guild of Saint Mary and Saint John the Baptist.\n\nThe youngest daughter, Eleanor Beaumont, married Humphrey Babington, a nephew of Thomas Comberford, being a son of Dorothy (Fitzherbert) Comberford’s sister. Humphrey Babington’s brother, the Revd Thomas Babington, was presented in 1510 by Thomas Comberford as the Rector of Yelvertoft in Northamptonshire, where Thomas Comberford also owned an estate.\n\nThomas Comberford died on 6 January 1532. Dorothy (Beaumont) Comberford eventually inherited the Beaumont estates, which became part of the Comberford estates inherited by her eldest son, Thomas Comberford (ca 1530-1597), after Dorothy died in 1565.\n\nin 1565 Thomas Comberford secured full possession of the whole of the Manor of Wednesbury, with its dependent estates and lands in Staffordshire and Derbyshire. By acquiring the interests of the Babington family, the Comberfords arrested the possibility that the estates would be divided, and placed themselves in a position to exploit the new-found wealth in coal mining in south Staffordshire.\n\nThose Wednesbury estates included: the manors of Wednesbury and Tynmore, 120 acres of land, 40 acres of wood, 10 acres of land, and 10 acres of meadow in Wirksworth and Kirk Ireton, near Matlock in Derbyshire; £10 rent in Wednesbury, Waltswoode, Finchpath and Tibinton; and a fifth-part of the Manor of Egginton in Derbyshire, half-way between Burton-upon-Trent and Derby.\n\nWhen Thomas Comberford died, Wednesbury was part of the large estates inherited by his son William Comberford (1551-1625), who used his wealth from the Wednesbury estate to advance his family’s political, economic and social power in South Staffordshire.\n\nThe Long Gallery in the Moat House, with its decorated ceiling illustrating the family trees of the Comberford family and their descent from the Beaumont family (Photograph: Patrick Comerford, 2007)\n\nThe heraldic family trees on the ceiling of the Long Gallery in the Moat House, Tamworth [See Comberford 5: Recusants, royal guests and civil war], illustrate the importance William Comberford and his family attached to their descent from the Beaumont family.\n\nBy emphasising this descent from the Beaumonts, later generations in the Comberford family claimed a certain social cachet, including kinship with French, Scottish and English royalty, and, perhaps, securing a prominent place during the visit of James I and his son Prince Charles to Tamworth in August 1619, when the Prince of Wales stayed overnight at the Moat House as a guest of William Comberford.\n\nThe Comberfords had risen from the ranks of the local farming families to claiming a place among the gentry.\n\nThe arms of William Comberford on the ceiling of the long gallery in the Moat House, quartering Edgbaston, Parles, Beaumont, Leventhorp and Heronville (Photograph: Patrick Comerford)\n\nTo proclaim their new-found status, the Comberford family quartered their coat-of-arms with the arms of the Beaumont family, and also used quarterings illustrating their inheritance of the Wednesbury estate through the Leventhorpe family.\n\nAt the Visitation of Staffordshire in 1614, William Comberford quartered his arms with those of Beaumont in six quarterings: Comberford (gules, a talbot statant argent); Edgbaston (per pale indented, or and azure, in the dexter chief an escallop gules ); Parles (gules,on a cross engrailed or five roses of the field); Beaumont (azure, semée-de-lis, a lion rampant or); Leventhorp (argent, a bend componée gules and sable, cottised of the second); Heronville (sable, two lions passant argent, crowned or).\n\nFurther research shows, however, that the arms of Leventhrop had not descended to the Beaumont and Comberford families with the descent of the Wednesbury estate.\n\nThe quartered arms allowed to William Comberford at the Visitation of Warwickshire in 1619\n\nAt the Visitation of Warwickshire in 1619, the heralds allowed William Comberford to use the Parles arms of five red roses on a golden engrailed cross with a red background, and to quarter these with eight other arms:\n\nEdgerbaston (sic) (per pale indented or and azure), Beaumont (semee of fleur de lis, a lion rampant), Cumming (gules, three garbs argent), Chester (azure, three garbs or), Everingham (gules, a lion rampant vair), Heronville or Hanville (sable, two lions passant regardant in pale argent), Tynmore or Tinmare (vert, a bend or, in sinister chief a maunch sable) and Stafford (or, a chevron and in dexter chief a mullet gules).\n\nOrigins of the Beaumont family:\n\nDespite the heraldic family tree on the decorated ceiling of the Long gallery in the moat House, Tamworth, tracing a royal descent for the Comberford family through the marriage of Dorothy Beaumont and Humphrey Comberford, there are conflicting claims about the origins of the Beaumont family.\n\nSome accounts claim that the Beaumont family is descended from Louis, son of Charles, Count of Anjou, a younger son of Louis VIII, King of France. However, it appears that the only Louis who was a son of Charles d’Anjou died in infancy.\n\nOther accounts claim this family is descended from Louis de Brienne, the second son of John de Brienne, the last King of Jerusalem.\n\nStill other accounts of the family history claim the Beaumonts were descended from the Beaumonts who were viscounts in Normandy.\n\nThe traditional Beaumont family tree:\n\nThe Beaumont coat-of-arms on the ceiling of the Long Gallery in the Moat House, Tamworth (Photograph: Patrick Comerford)\n\nCharibert de Haspengau (ca 555-636).

It is reputed to have been fortified by Ethelflaed, daughter of King Alfred, in 916 to protect the borders of the Kingdom of Mercia from Viking raids.\n\nLittle is known about the early history of the town and Manor of Wednesbury until it is recorded in the Domesday Book, which describes ‘Wednesberie’ as a manor consisting of ploughland and meadows surrounded with dense woodland.\n\nIn 1164, King Henry II exchanged the Manor of Wednesbury for the manor of Stonesfield in Oxfordshire. After the exchange, Wednesbury came under the control of a tenant of the d’Oyley family, Ralph Boterel, who became lord of the manor.\n\nRalph Boterel died in 1181 but he had never paid his rent. When William de Heronville took over the manor in 1182, he was charged with 18 years arrears, which he immediately agreed to pay.\n\nWilliam de Heronville became lord of the Manor of Wednesbury after marrying the daughter and heiress of Ralph Boterel. William, who rented the mill to the monks of Bordesley Abbey for 10 shillings a year, had died by 1225.\n\nHis son:\n\nWilliam de Heronville became lord of the manor of Wednesbury, and in January 1226 he conveyed the mill to the monks of Bordesley Abbey, who in turn sublet it to the Hillary family, lords of the manor of Bescot, for a free farm rent.\n\nHis son:\n\nSimon de Heronville succeeded his father at Wednesbury, and was Lord of the Manor ca 1255. He died in 1259.\n\nHis son:\n\n(Sir) John de Heronville inherited Wednesbury Manor in 1259, but had not yet come of age. He became the ward of the Earl and Countess of Warwick, who had taken over the barony of d’Oyley by marriage. He came of age ca 1261, and his son and heir, Henry was born in 1265. John married twice. His first wife was the sister and one of the heirs of William Fitzwarren of Tipton and as a result he gained a share in the manor of Tipton. He later married Juliana, who outlived him.\n\nThe arms of the Borough of Wednesbury included two lions from the coat-of-arms of the Heronville coat-of-arms\n\nJohn de Heronville was knighted in 1272. The two lions on his coat-of-arms later featured in the coat of arms of the Borough of Wednesbury. He was one of the four Verderers of Cannock Forest.\n\nJohn de Heronville died in 1315 and the manor came under the control of the son by his first wife, Henry Heronville. John’s widow Juliana was entitled to one-third of the estate for life, or as her dower, or until she remarried. Juliana’s share of the manor house included a hall, pantry, a solar (a private room on the sunny side of the house), a cellar beneath the solar, a brewhouse, a bakery, stables, a cow house, and a long sheep house. She also had her share of the dovecote, and 145 strips of arable land, part of John’s 120 acres.\n\nThe son and heir of John de Heronville was:\n\nHenry de Heronville. He was aged 50 when he inherited Wednesbury Manor in 1315. His share of the estate included the manor house with courtyards and gardens, 120 acres of arable land, 10 acres of meadow, and a dwelling house formerly belonging to Thomas Trond, with 15 acres of arable land, including two acres of meadow.Henry died a year later, in 1316, and was succeeded by his son:\n\nJohn Heronville (II) was aged 12 when he inherited Wednesbury in 1316. He died in 1354 and was succeeded by his son:\n\nJohn de Heronville (III). He married Alice, the daughter and heir of John de Timmor, who succeeded to Timmor by 1341 and probably by 1333; he is likely to have been the John of Timmor who was a collector of the subsidy in Staffordshire in 1352; he may still have been living in 1373. Timmor was part of the Bishop of Lichfield’s manor of Lichfield (later Longdon) and remained so until at least 1739.\n\nJohn de Heronville III died by 1403 and was succeeded by his son:\n\nHenry de Heronville. He succeeded his father as lord of Wednesbury in 1403, was already lord of Timmor in 1392 and probably by 1379. He married Margaret ... He died in 1406, leaving three infant daughters as his heirs, and Timmor passed to his widow Margaret for the duration of her life.\n\nTheir three daughters were:\n\n1, Joan, who was aged 4 in 1406.\n\n2, Alice, who was aged 2 in 1406.\n\n3, Margaret, who was aged 12 months in 1406.\n\nThese three daughters were co-heirs to their father’s estates at Wednesbury and Timmor, and to one-fifth of Tipton. As they were under age, a guardian appointed to look after them and as custodian of the manor. The first guardian was John Brown of Lichfield, but by 1415 their guardian was John de Leventhorp, a member of the royal household.\n\nJohn de Leventhorp intended to keep the manor of Wednesbury in his hands, He married the eldest daughter and co-heir, Joan de Heronville, to his eldest son William Leventhorpe. In 1418, he then persuaded the two younger sisters to become nuns in Sempringham. As nuns their share of the estate would pass to their elder sister, Joan, so ensuring that William de Leventhorp became lord of the manor of Wednesbury.\n\nWilliam de Leventhrope and Joan (Heronville) had a daughter, Elizabeth, and around 1435 William created a trust on his land in Wednesbury, Fynchespath, Darlaston, and Tipton so that if Joan outlived him she would be entitled to the property for life, or until she remarried. It would then pass on to their daughter Elizabeth and her heirs. William de Leventhorpe died some time before 1446 and his widow, Joan (Heronville) married her second husband, Sir Henry Beaumont (see above), who became lord of the manor.\n\nHenry Beaumont made a settlement of the Manor of Wednesbury for his wife, himself and their heirs.\n\nHenry and Joan Beaumont were the parents of a son, also Henry Beaumont, who was born in 1446. Henry Beaumont senior died in 1447. In 1452, Henry’s widow Joan, resettled the manor upon trustees, including Charles Nowell of Ellenhall in Staffordshire. Charles became Joan’s third husband, and lord of the manor of Wednesbury. Joan died after 1460, and her son, Henry Beaumont II, became lord of the manor.\n\nSources:\n\nBurke’s Peerage, various editions, sv Beaumont.\n\nDebrett’s Peerage, various editions, sv Beaumont.\n\nWilliam Dugdale, ‘The Heraldic Visitations of Staffordshire in 1614 and 1663-64,’ in Collections for a History of Staffordshire, William Salt Archaeological Society, Vol 5, No 2, 1884 (London, 1885).\n\nJohn Ede, History of Wednesbury (Wednesbury, 1962).\n\nS.
