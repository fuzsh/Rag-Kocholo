        "text": "The author discusses the question of when and under what circumstances were the new bishoprics founded or old Early Christian episcopal seats re-established in the cities of early medieval Dalmatia. Beginning with the possibility that some or all of the said cities gained their episcopal status at the end of the 8th c., the author examines the viewpoints of earlier scholars who have expounded the theory in question during the last century (since 1912 it had been put forward on several occasions and in different ways). This \"unconventional\" date predominated in the studies dedicated to the ecclesiastical history of Spalatum-Split (F. Bulić, J. Bervaldi, V. Novak, G. Novak, M. Barada, Lj. Karaman, V. Košćak, V. Delonga, M. Matijević-Sokol); yet even in cases such as this the \"late\" dating was less then universally accepted in Croatian and former Yugoslav historiography. The years 614 and 641 for a long time presented a conventional terminus for the collapse of Early Christian dioceses in Dalmatia, only for them to be once again suddenly and inexplicably represented in historical sources around 800. Under what circumstances did the early medieval bishoprics of Kotor (Dekatera), Dubrovnik (Ragusium), Split (Spalatum), Zadar (Jader), Rab (Arbe) and Osor (Apsorus) originate and how did they evolve, remained for the large part unexplained. Considering as particularly encouraging the suggestions of A. Dabinović, S. Gunjača, J. Darrouzès, R. Katičić, L. Margetić and Ž. Rapanić – who have all pointed to signatures of four Dalmatian bishops in the proceedings of the church council of Nicaea held in 787 – the author additionally analyzes its data, as well as the other sources relevant to earliest ecclesiastical history of Dalmatian episcopal cities. Acts of the Nicaean council contain the signatures of 'Ioannes episcopus sanctae ecclesiae Salonentianae' (John od Salona-Split), 'Laurentius episcopus sanctae Absartianensis ecclesiae' (Lawrence of Osor), 'Ursus episcopus Avaritianensium ecclesiae' (Ursus of Rab) and 'Ioannes episcopus Decateron' (John of Kotor). Relying on the results of his analysis, the author will try to connect the said historical record of several Dalmatian dioceses dating from the end of 8th c. with the artistic material (architecture, reliefs, liturgical installations etc.) preserved in their respective church buildings, firmly dated to the same period. It should be emphasized that the material in question at the same time represents the earliest layer of Pre-Romanesque monuments originating from the said cities, that is to say the first examples of medieval art to be found in them. This, in turn, the author will attempt to relate to the circulation of relics of Constantinopolitan origin in Dalmatia at the eve of the Aachen peace treaty. Finally, with respect to the accepted chronology and circumstances of military and political events at the Adriatic between 787 and 812, he will try to outline a possible context of foundation (or re-establishment) of Dalmatian dioceses at that time. A stonecarvers' workshop active in Split at the end of the 8th c. represents a case-study for the author's methodology. In discussing the chronology of the works of the so-called Split stonecarvers' workshop, we should in the first place emphasize that the motifs it uses have their origin in the North Adriatic region. Sculptors that used the motifs in question doubtlessly found their inspiration in north-eastern Italy, from where Carolingian political aspirations were spreading through Istria to Dalmatia. The use of some other motifs points to papal Rome, from where the pontiff's aspirations to the Eastern Adriatic also derive. The same phenomenon can be observed in Kotor, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Rab and Osor, three of which were also represented by a bishop at the Nicaean council. Historical circumstances indicate that these restorers of the Adriatic dioceses must be seen as exponents of the papal-Frankish policy in the late 8th c. In conclusion, the author proposes that most of the early medieval dioceses in Dalmatia were (re-)established in the second half of the 8th c., following Charlemagne's conquest of the Lombard kingdom and the beginning of dispute between the Franks and the Byzantines. It thus seems allowable to conclude that the Frankish-Byzantine \"competition\" for the cities of Dalmatian littoral started earlier (late 770s-early 780s instead of 805) and lasted longer than is usually held, only to be definitively resolved in favor of Byzantium by the treaty of Aachen in 812.\n\nPrevious research has mainly concentrated on whether or not the Apostolic See actively supported, obstructed or ignored the rise of the Angevins to the throne of Hungary between 1290 and 1301. Whatever papal stance historians supported coloured how they explained changes that occurred in this period in the Church organisation of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia, and what role these adjustments played in the subsequent arrival of Charles Robert to the throne of Hungary in 1301. Instead, I have analysed local developments and how these were interconnected with the international situation and how each influenced one another. This included assessing the motivations behind the actions of three major players who brought Charles Robert to Hungary: the Apostolic See, the Angevin court in Naples and the local oligarchs, the Šubići. Although other explanations for the cooperation between these three parties can be supported, namely the cultural, economic and political factors, the focus of this paper is on changes in the local Church structures. I tracked how each of the involved parties contributed to these developments and used local Church reforms for their personal gain. This paper evaluates the inextricably related agendas of the Apostolic See, the Angevins and the Šubići at the close of the thirteenth century.\n\nIt is needless to stress that the De Administrando Imperio or On the Administration of the Empire, undoubtedly the most famous work that carries the name of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, offers a real abundance of material that can be scrutinized on different levels and with various research goals and objectives. In many respect, as it has been recognized a long ago and reiterated many times since, the De Administrando Imperio is the narrative for the reconstruction of the earliest history of the Slavic principalities in southeastern Europe. It provides the unique information and a particular perspective. And it brings forth legendary elements that, with its elusive nature, constitute a genuine challenge when tried to be fit into a scholarly historiographical discourse. This paper aims at presenting and discussing three examples of the legendary elements found in the De Administrando Imperio and relating one way or the other to the early Croatian history, namely, the story of the capture of Salona that is narrated in two separate chapters (DAI, c. 29, 14-53, c. 30, 14-61), the story of the revolt of the Croats against the Franks (DAI, c. 30, 78-90), and the story of a saintly man by the name of Martin (DAI, c. 31, 42-57). The stories will be first treated as narrative texts, i.e. they will be subjected to the narratological analysis, and then to the historiographic analysis. An attempt will be made to (re-)interpret the content and meaning of the stories, the role that they might have had in the collective memory, and how and why they might have been refashioned and/or used to correspond to the Byzantine cultural/ideological/political needs. The last is stated bearing in mind that the stories cannot be so easily dismissed as mere literary ploys, invented traditions and ideological-propagandistic tools for wider dissemination since the De Administrando Imperio seems to have been, for all intents and purposes, a secret document not intended for general public\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to examine the relations between the Bosnian Banate and the papacy during the thirteenth century, one of the most turbulent periods in the history of this interaction. The focus will be set on the development of the situation regarding the Bosnian bishopric, its position in the political turmoil, and its fate after the collapse of every chance for agreement. First, we will give a short overview of the periods that precede this time when this bishopric was the centre of two waves of the Christianization of these areas and the carrier of religious life during the late Antiquity and early Middle Ages. The main part of the paper is dedicated to the events from the first half of the thirteenth century, crucial period that shaped the future political and religious picture of medieval Bosnia. The final part of the paper will cover the longest lasting consequences of the aforementioned events: the cessation of official contacts between Bosnia and the Roman Curia, relocation of the Bosnian bishopric outside its territory, and the formation of the Bosnian church-an autocephalous organization that emerged on the foundations of the previous Catholic diocese."
