        "text": "Ferdinand III (July 13, 1608 – April 2, 1657) was Archduke of Austria from 1621, King of Hungary and King of Croatia from 1625 and of Bohemia from 1627 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1637 to his death.\n\nFerdinand was born in Graz as the third son of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II of the House of Habsburg and his first wife, Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria, the fourth child and second (but eldest surviving) daughter of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand was baptised as Ferdinand Ernt. He grew up in Carinthia with loving care from his parents and developed great affection for his siblings and his father with whom he always found a consensus in future disagreements.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand became the reigning Archduke of Austria in 1621. On December 8, 1625, he was crowned King of Hungary and Croatia, on November 27, 1627 he was crowned King of Bohemia.\n\nFerdinand enhanced his authority and set an important legal and military precedent by issuing a Revised Land Ordinance, which deprived the Bohemian estates of their right to raise soldiers and reserved that power for the monarch. His father Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II was unable to secure him the election as King of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg of 1630.\n\nKing Ferdinand married the Spanish Infanta, his cousin Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, after years of negotiations with Spanish relatives in 1631. Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was the daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and Archduchess Margaret of Austria, the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria and Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria and thus the paternal granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I.\n\nPrior to her Imperial marriage Infanta Maria Anna of Spain was considered a possible wife for Charles, Prince of Wales. The event, later known in history as the “Spanish match”, provoked a domestic and political crisis in the kingdoms of England and Scotland.\n\nAlthough it was in the middle of the war, the elaborate wedding was celebrated over fourteen months. The marriage produced six children, including his successors, King Ferdinand IV of Hungary and Croatia and Emperor Leopold I.\n\nHis loving and intelligent wife and her brother, the Spanish Cardinal Infante Fernando, had a great influence on Ferdinand and formed the most important link between the Habsburg courts in Madrid, Brussels and Vienna in the difficult period of the war for the Habsburgs after the death of Wallenstein.\n\nKing Ferdinand III of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, Archduke of Austria was elected as King of the Romans at the Diet of Regensburg on December 22, 1636. Upon the death of his father on February 15, 1637, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III.\n\nMaximilian I (April 17, 1573 – September 27, 1651), occasionally called the Great, a member of the House of Wittelsbach, ruled as Duke of Bavaria from 1597. His reign was marked by the Thirty Years’ War during which he obtained the title of Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire at the 1623 Diet of Regensburg.\n\nBackground\n\nMaximilian I was born in Munich, the eldest son of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine, the second child and eldest daughter of François I, Duke of Lorraine and Christina of Denmark, the youngest surviving daughter of King Christian II of Denmark, Norway and Sweden his wife Archduchess Isabella of Austria, the third child of Archduke Philipp Austria, Duke of Burgundy (King Felipe I of Castile) and Queen Joanna of Castile.\n\nMaximilian’s father, Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria was the son of Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria and Archduchess Anna of Austria, the third of fifteen children of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I (1503–1564) from his marriage with the Jagiellonian Princess Anna of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia (1503–1547).\n\nHe was educated by the Jesuits, and began to take part in the government in 1591. In 1595 he married his cousin, Elisabeth Renata of Lorraine, daughter of Duke Charles III of Lorraine, and his wife Claude of Valois, a French Princess, the second daughter of King Henri II of France and Catherine de’ Medici.\n\nMaximilian became Duke of Bavaria upon his father’s abdication in 1597. After his abdication, the former Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria retired into a monastery where he spent the remainder of his life in contemplation and prayer. He died in 1626 at the Old Schleissheim Palace and was buried at St. Michael’s Church, Munich.\n\nAs the ablest prince of his age Maximilian sought to prevent the Holy Roman Empire from becoming the battleground of Europe, and although a rigid adherent of the Catholic faith, he was not always subservient to the church. Weak in health and feeble in frame, Maximilian had high ambitions both for himself and his duchy, and was tenacious and resourceful in prosecuting his designs.\n\nHaving refused to become a candidate for the imperial throne in 1619, Maximilian was faced with the complications arising from the outbreak of war in Bohemia. After some delay he made a treaty with Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in October 1619, and in return for large concessions placed the forces of the Catholic League at the emperor’s service.\n\nAnxious to curtail the area of the struggle, he made a treaty of neutrality with the Protestant Union, and occupied Upper Austria as security for the expenses of the campaign. On November 8, 1620 his troops under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly defeated the forces of his Wittlesbach relative, Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatine of the Rhine and King of Bohemia at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague. Subsequently Emperor Ferdinand II released Upper Austria as a pawn for Maximilian until 1628.\n\nIn spite of the arrangement with the Union, Tilly then devastated the Rhenish Palatinate, and in February 1623 Maximilian was formally invested with the electoral dignity and became the Prince-Elector of Bavaria, the attendant office of imperial steward, which had been enjoyed since 1356 by the Counts Palatine of the Rhine.\n\nAfter receiving the Upper Palatinate and restoring Upper Austria to Emperor Ferdinand II, Maximilian became leader of the party which sought to bring about Albrecht von Wallenstein’s dismissal from the imperial service.\n\nAt the Diet of Regensburg (1630) Emperor Ferdinand II was compelled to assent to this demand, but the sequel was disastrous both for Bavaria and its ruler. Attempting to remain neutral during the war, Maximilian signed the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau (1631) with the King Louis XIII of France and Navarre, but this proved worthless.\n\nEarly in 1632 King Gustaf II Adolphus of Sweden marched into the duchy and occupied Munich, and Maximilian could only obtain the assistance of the Imperial troops by placing himself under the orders of Wallenstein, now restored to the command of the emperor’s forces.\n\nThe ravages of the Swedes and their French allies induced the elector to enter into negotiations for peace with the Swedes and Cardinal Richelieu of France. He also wooed the Protestants by proposing modifications to the Edict of Restitution of 1629, but these efforts were abortive.\n\nHis first marriage to Elisabeth Renata of Lorraine was childless. A few months after the death of Elisabeth Renata, the 62-year-old Prince-Elector Maximilian married, on July 15, 1635 in Vienna, his 25-year-old niece Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1610-1665), the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and Maximillian’s sister, Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574-1616).\n\nThe main motivation for this swift remarriage was not so much political grounds as the hope of producing a prince to inherit. In contrast to the Prince-Elector’s first wife, Maria Anna was very interested in politics and well instructed about developments.\n\nShe was not bound to the Habsburgs, but rather completely advocated the Bavarian standpoint. Additionally, she conducted lively exchanges of opinion with high officials of the Munich court and took part in meetings of the cabinet.\n\nThe Duke died at Ingolstadt on September 27, 1651. He is buried in St. Michael’s Church, Munich. In 1839 a statue was erected to his memory at Munich by King Ludwig I of Bavaria.\n\nBy his second wife he left two sons, Ferdinand Maria, who succeeded him as Prince-Elector of Bavaria. He modernized the army and introduced Bavaria’s first government code. Besides encouraging agriculture and industry, he also improved building and restoration works on churches and monasteries since the damage caused during the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nand\n\nHis second son, Prince Maximilian Philipp was Duke of Bavaria-Leuchtenberg from 1650 until his death, and regent of Bavaria from 1679 to 1680 during the minority of his nephew Maximilian II, Prince-Elector of Bavaria.\n\nRudolph II “the blind” (August 8, 1306 – October 4, 1353) was Count Palatine of the Rhine from 1329 to 1353.\n\nThe Electoral Palatinate or the Palatinate, officially the Electorate of the Palatinate, was a state that was part of the Holy Roman Empire. The electorate had its origins under the rulership of the Counts Palatine of Lotharingia in 915; it was then restructured under the Counts Palatine of the Rhine in 1085.\n\nThese counts palatine of the Rhine would serve as Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire from “time immemorial”, and were noted as such in a papal letter of 1261; they were confirmed as electors by the Golden Bull of 1356.\n\nThe first hereditary Count Palatine of the Rhine was Conrad, a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and younger half-brother of Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa. The territories attached to this hereditary office in 1156 started from those held by the Hohenstaufens.\n\nThe Wittelsbach Conrad of Scheyern-Dachau, a great-grandson of Otto I, Count of Scheyern, became Duke of Merania in 1153 and was succeeded by his son Conrad II. It was the first Duchy held by the Wittelsbach family (until 1180/82).\n\nOtto I’s eldest son Eckhard I, Count of Scheyern was father of the count palatine of Bavaria, Otto IV (died 1156), who was the first Count of Wittelsbach and whose son Otto was invested with the Duchy of Bavaria in 1180 after the fall of Heinrich the Lion and hence the first Bavarian ruler from the House of Wittelsbach. Duke Otto’s son Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria acquired the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1214.\n\nRudolph II of the Rhine was born in Wolfratshausen, the son of Rudolph I, Duke of Upper Bavaria, and Mechtild of Nassau, daughter of Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, King of the Romans and his wife Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg. Rudolph’s uncle was Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV.\n\nDuring his childhood, his father and his uncle fought over their inheritance. After the death of his father, his family was placed under the guardianship of Duke Johann of Nassau, who was a partisan of the Austrian cause.\n\nHis uncle, Ludwig IV, Holy Roman Emperor had taken the Palatinate by force of arms. In August 1322, the war finally came to an end, but only after Mechthild’s death in June 1323, were the three nephews finally able to make peace with their uncle. His sons inherited Bavaria and Rudolph I’s sons inherited the Upper Palatinate and the Palatinate in line with the Treaty of Pavia.\n\nHe was blind only in the last years of his life.\n\nPosterity\n\nRudolph married twice:\n\nIn 1328, he married Anne of Carinthia-Tyrol (1300 – 1331), daughter of Duke Otto III of Carinthia, Count of Tyrol and Duchess Euphemia of Legnica (1281–1347), a daughter of the Silesian duke Heinrich V of Legnica.\n\nThey had one daughter: Anne of the Palatinate (1329 – 1353) who married in 1349 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV.\n\nIn 1348, he married Margaret of Sicily (1331 – 1377), daughter of King Frederick II of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, a member of the Capetian House of Anjou by birth. She was the third daughter of King Charles II of Naples and Princess Mary of Hungary.\n\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of the Rhine died in Neustadt.\n\nPhilipp of Swabia (February/March 1177 – June 21, 1208) was a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and King of the Romans/Germans from 1198 until his assassination.\n\nPhilipp was born in or near Pavia in the Imperial Kingdom of Italy as the tenth child and eighth (but fifth and youngest surviving) son of Friedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy, the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine.\n\nHis paternal family was the noble House of Hohenstaufen, the name given to the dynasty by historians since the 15th century. The origins of the family are still unclear today; the ancestors on the paternal side were minor nobles and their names have not been preserved. All that is known about Barbarossa’s great-grandfather Friedrich of Büren is that he married a woman named Hildegard (whose own parentage was disputed: she was a member of either the Comital family of Egisheim–Dagsburg or the obscure Schlettstadt family).\n\nA few years ago it was assumed that the Schlettstadt property did not belong to Hildegard but to her husband himself and the Hohenstaufen were therefore not a Swabian but an Alsatian family. It wasn’t until around 1100 that the family under Duke Friedrich I of Swabia located into the East Swabian Rems valley.\n\nThe death of Philip’s older brother Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1197 meant that the Hohenstaufen rule (which reached as far as the Kingdom of Sicily) collapsed in imperial Italy and created a power vacuum to the north of the Alps. Reservations about the kingship of Heinrich’s underage son, Friedrich, led to two royal elections in 1198, which resulted in the German throne dispute: the two elected kings, Philipp of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, claimed the throne for themselves,\n\nOtto was the third son of Heinrich XII the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Duke of Saxony, by his wife Matilda of England, third child and eldest daughter of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine Otto’s exact birthplace is not given by any original source. He grew up in England in the care of his maternal grandfather, King Henry II of England.\n\nBoth opponents tried in the following years through European and papal support, with the help of money and gifts, through demonstrative public appearances and rituals, to decide the conflict for oneself by raising ranks or by military and diplomatic measures. Philipp was able to increasingly assert his kingship against Otto in the north part of the Alps.\n\nMarriage\n\nIrene Angelina of Byzantium (c. 1181 – August 27, 1208) was a Byzantine princess and member of the Angelos dynasty and by her two marriages Queen of Sicily in 1193 and Queen of the Romans/Germans from 1198 to 1208.\n\nIrene was born in Constantinople, the second daughter of Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos and his first wife, quite possibly an unknown Palaiologina with a non-Greek mother, who became a nun with the name Irene.\n\nIn 1193 her father and King Tancred of Sicily arranged Irene’s marriage with Tancred’s eldest son, Roger. Her husband was declared co-king, but he died on December 24, 1193, shortly before his father’s death on February 20, 1194. Sicily was claimed by Tancred’s aunt Constance and her husband, Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich VI. Irene was captured December 29, 1194 during the conquest of Sicily. To improve relationships with the Byzantine Empire, in April 1195 Henry VI betrothed Philip to Irene Angelina.\n\nShe was married on May 25, 1197 to Henry’s younger brother, Duke Philip of Swabia, and took the name Maria. After the Emperor Heinrich VI had died on September 28, Philipp was elected King of the Romans in Mühlhausen on March 8, 1198. Queen Irene’s father, who had been deposed in 1195, urged her to get Philip’s support for his reinstatement. Irene Angelina was renamed Maria upon her wedding.\n\nAssassination\n\nSince the end of May 1208, Philip had been preparing for a campaign against Otto IV and his allies. He interrupted the planning to attend the wedding of his niece Countess Beatrice II of Burgundy with Duke Otto of Merania on June 21, 1208 in Bamberg. After the marriage, the King retired to his private apartments. In the afternoon he was murdered by Count Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. After the murder, Count Otto VIII was able to flee with his followers. Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and his brother, Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, were suspected of having known about the plans. Other medieval historians expressed doubts about complicity or ignored other possible perpetrators.\n\nFor the first time since the end of the Merovingian dynasty a king had been murdered. Besides Albert I of Habsburg (1308), Philip is the only Roman-German ruler to be assassinated. No chronicler witnessed the murder. In contemporary sources there is little agreement about the course of the murder. Most medieval chroniclers saw the withdrawal of the promise of marriage as a motive for murder. Even in distant Piacenza, Philip’s murder was still associated with a failed marriage project. Allegedly the Wittelsbach scion, already known for his unstable character, had fallen into a rage when he learned of the dissolution of his betrothal to Gertrude of Silesia by her father, the Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded, who was apparently informed of Count Otto VIII’s cruel tendencies and in an act of concern for his young daughter decided to terminate the marriage agreement.\n\nLater, after an unfortunate campaign to Thuringia, Philipp had betrothed his third daughter Kunigunde to Count Otto VIII in the summer of 1203 in order to make him a reliable ally in the fight against Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In the following years Philipp increasingly succeeded in gaining acceptance for his kingship, so the betrothal with the Wittelsbach became without purpose to him; in November 1207 the King engaged Kunigunde to Wenceslaus, son and heir of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, on the Hoftag in Augsburg. Philipp hoped that this alliance would gain permanent support from Bohemia. For Count Otto VIII this behavior was an act of treason and also felt that his social status was threatened; he swore revenge on the German King, whom he blame for both spurned betrothals, culminating in the murder at Bamberg.\n\nSince historian Eduard Winkelmann’s careful analysis in the 19th century, research has assumed that Otto VIII of Wittelsbach acted as a lone perpetrator. In contrast, historian Bernd Ulrich Hucker made a “comprehensive conspiratorial plan” in 1998 and suspected a “coup d’état”. The Andechs Dukes of Merania, King Philippe II of France and Duke Henry I of Brabant should have been involved in this comprehensive plot; allegedly, the conspirators had planned to put the Duke of Brabant on the German throne. But Hucker’s coup hypothesis did not prevail. It remains to be seen what use the French king would have had from the removal of Philipp and his replacement by the Duke of Brabant. The House of Andechs, as loyal followers of Philipp, who often stayed at his court and were protected by him, had no interest in his death.\n\nAftermath\n\nPhilipp was initially buried in Bamberg Cathedral, the burial place of Emperor Heinrich II and King Conrad III. His rival Otto IV let the assassins be persecuted relentlessly and wanted to prove his innocence. Only the Annales Pegaviensis (chronicle of the Pegau Abbey) held Otto IV’s supporters responsible for the murder. Philip’s widow, Irene-Maria, pregnant at that time, took refuge in Hohenstaufen Castle, dying only two months after the Bamberg regicide as a result of a miscarriage.\n\nAfter Philip’s death, Otto IV quickly prevailed against the remaining Hohenstaufen supporters, was acknowledged as German monarch at an Imperial Diet in Frankfurt in November 1208 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year. For the new fully recognized German King, the most important goal was to restore order in the realm. A Landfrieden was established for this purpose and the Imperial ban on Philipp’s murderer and alleged accomplices, the Andechs brothers Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, was imposed.\n\nAs a result, they lost all offices, rights and property. In addition, Otto IV’s engagement to Beatrix, Philipp’s eldest daughter, was agreed. Philipp’s murderer Otto VIII of Wittelsbach (now condemned as vogelfrei) was found in March 1209 by Reichsmarschall Heinrich of Kalden in a granary on the Danube near Regensburg and beheaded. The Andechs brothers, however, were politically rehabilitated three years later.\n\nPhilipp was the first German king to be murdered during his reign. In posterity, Philip is one of the little-noticed Hohenstaufen rulers.\n\nRicheza of Poland (April 12, 1116 – c. December 25, 1156), a member of the House of Piast, was twice Queen of Sweden and once Princess of Minsk through her three marriages.\n\nRicheza was the daughter of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife, Salomea of Berg. Tradition describes her as unusually beautiful.\n\nFirst marriage\n\nThe Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth entered in an alliance with King Niels of Denmark against Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania (now in northwestern Poland and northeastern Germany). In order to seal this alliance, a marriage was arranged between Bolesław III’s daughter Richeza with Niels’ eldest son, Crown Prince Magnus the Strong. The wedding took place in Ribe around 1127 and was celebrated with pomp and circumstances. Richeza bore her husband two sons: Knud in 1129 and Niels in 1130.\n\nAs one of the heirs of his maternal grandfather King Inge I, Magnus claimed Sweden. He was recognized King of Götaland or parts thereof by the Geats (Götar) in c. 1129 after the death of his mother’s cousin King Inge II. Then Richeza became Queen consort of Sweden. However, Magnus’ rule was not accepted by the Svear, another tribe to the north of the Geats, who vetoed him and elected Ragnvald Knaphövde as the new King. According to the chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Ragnvald was murdered by supporters of Magnus, who then won the realm (“imperium”) as King of Sweden. However, there soon appeared another contender for the throne, Sverker I, who had his power base in Östergötland.\n\nRicheza and her husband had their base in Denmark rather than Sweden. Alarmed by the popularity and Imperial support of his cousin Knud Lavard, Duke of Schleswig, both Magnus and his father King Niels acted against Knud, who was murdered by Magnus on January 7, 1131. Knud’s half-brother Erik rebelled against Niels and Magnus, but was defeated and took refuge in Norway, where he convinced the local nobility and the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III to launch a retaliatory expedition against Niels.\n\nMeanwhile, Sverker I finally made the Swedes abandon Magnus in c. 1132, when he was busy with the civil war in Denmark; he then unified the country under his rule. Niels was defeated in the Battle of Fotevik (June 4, 1134), and also lost his son Magnus who was slain during the battle. Niels escaped to Schleswig, where he was killed by the citizens (June 25, 1134). Now a widow, Richeza returned to Poland, apparently leaving her two sons behind in Denmark.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nOnce in Poland, Duke Bolesław III arranged a new marriage for his daughter. On June 18, 1136, Richeza married a member of the Rurikid dynasty, Volodar Glebovich, Prince of Minsk and Grodno, who at that time was in exile in the Polish court. The union was made in order to seal the alliance of Minsk and Poland against Denmark and the powerful Monomakh Kievan dynasty. During this marriage, Richeza gave birth to three children: two sons, Vladimir (later Prince of Minsk) and Vasilko (Prince of Logoysk or Lahojsk), and a daughter, Sophia, born ca. 1139/40.\n\nAround 1145, the political advantages of the Polish-Minsk union began to disappear after the Monomach dynasty lost its hegemony among the Rurikid ruling branches. Likely this was the cause of the dissolution of the marriage of Richeza and Volodar. Richeza returned again to Poland, this time with her daughter Sophia, but left her two sons behind with her former husband. Volodar never remarried and died around 1186. She moved to Denmark when her son Knud or Canute V was enthroned in 1146.\n\nThird marriage\n\nIn c. 1148, Queen Ulvhild Håkansdotter, Sverker I’s wife and Richeza’s old stepmother-in-law, died. Soon afterwards, the widowed King married Richeza, who arrived in Sweden with her daughter Sophia. The King likely married her with support from Richeza’s first husband’s allies in Götaland. The union produced one son, Bulizlaus or Burislev, who was named after his Polish maternal grandfather. The chronicles assign Sune Sik Sverkersson as the youngest son of Sverker I, possibly born by Richeza.[self-published source]\n\nIn 1150, Richeza’s oldest son Knud V, King of Jutland, took refuge in Sweden after he was expelled from Denmark by Sweyn III Grathe, King of Zealand. In this way, the marriage with Sverker I give Richeza the opportunity to help her son, and some historians assume that she partially married the Swedish King for this reason.\n\nOne year later (1151), Knud asked for the help of Heinrich III the Lion, Duke of Saxony (Duke Heinrich XII of Bavaria) and Hartwig I, Archbishop of Bremen, but was defeated by Sweyn III’s forces. Only after the mediation of the King of the Germans Frederick Barbarossa during the Imperial Diet in Merseburg was there made a settlement between both parties: Knud V renounced his claim and was compensated by lands in Zealand, while Sweyn III was made king of Denmark. After this decision, both Knud V and Valdemar Knudsson (son of Knud Lavard, the enemy of his own father Magnus) rebelled against Sweyn III, who was expelled in 1154: Knud V and Valdemar became co-rulers of Denmark.\n\nIn 1156 Knud V married Helena, daughter of King Sverker I and his first wife Ulvhild; in consequence, Richeza became the step-mother-in-law of her own son. On Christmas Day of that year, Sverker I was murdered by a servant. When Knud V heard about the deed, he went to Sweden in order to console Richeza, but also to bring his half-sister Sophia of Minsk to Denmark to be married to Valdemar, to whom she had been betrothed since 1154. The marriage took place in 1157. On August 9 of that year, King Knud V was killed during a meeting with Valdemar I and Sweyn III. In 1158 Richeza’s second son Niels, probably a monk in Esrom Abbey, also died.\n\nDeath and aftermath\n\nRicheza is known to have survived Sverker I’s death, although the facts of her later life and her date of death are unknown: a legend says that she remarried the stable master who took part in the assassination of Sverker I.\n\nBurislev, Richeza’s son by Sverker I, is sometimes identified with Burislev, a rival claimant to the Swedish throne against Canute I after 1167. He acted in concert with another pretender Kol, but was defeated and eliminated, according to a much later source in 1169. He is believed either to have been slain by Canute I’s men or to have fled to Denmark or Poland some time before 1173.\n\nHowever, medieval Swedish genealogies say that the claimants Kol and Burislev were in fact sons of John, a son of Sverker and Ulvhild. If so, the younger Burislev was given the prestigious name after his grandfather’s second marriage without actually being related to Bolesław III. The only thing we know about Richeza’s son Burislev is that his goods were inherited by his uterine sister Sophia of Minsk.\n\nRicheza’s daughter Sophia of Minsk, Queen of Denmark by her first marriage to Valdemar I, give Richeza her only known legitimate grandchildren: the later kings Knud VI and Valdemar II of Denmark; Sophie (Countess of Orlamünde); Margareta and Maria, nuns at Roskilde; Ingeborg (the later repudiated Queen of France); Helena (Duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg) and Richeza, named after her grandmother and who, like her, became Queen of Sweden.\n\nThe Golden Bull of 1356 was a decree issued by the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Nuremberg and Metz (Diet of Metz, 1356/57) headed by Emperor Charles IV which fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire. It was named the Golden Bull for the golden seal it carried.\n\nThough the election of the King of the Romans by the chief ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Holy Roman Empire was well established, disagreements about the process and papal involvement had repeatedly resulted in controversies, most recently in 1314 when Ludwig IV of Bavaria and Friedrich of Austria had been elected by opposing sets of electors.\n\nLudwig, who had eventually subdued his rival’s claim on the battlefield, made a first attempt to clarify the process in the Declaration of Rhense of 1338, which renounced any papal involvement and had restricted the right to choose a new king to the Prince-Electors. The Golden Bull, promulgated by Ludwig’s s successor and rival, Charles IV, was more precise in several ways.\n\nPrince-Electors\n\nFirstly, the Bull explicitly named the seven Prince-Electors who were to choose the King and also defined the Reichserzämter, their (largely ceremonial) offices at court:\n\nSecondly, the principle of majority voting was explicitly stated for the first time in the Empire. The Bull prescribed that four (out of seven) votes would always suffice to elect a new King; as a result, three Electors could no longer block the election. Thirdly, the Electoral principalities were declared indivisible, and succession to them was regulated to ensure that the votes would never be divided.\n\nFinally, the Bull cemented a number of privileges for the Electors, confirming their elevated role in the Empire. It is therefore also a milestone in the establishment of largely independent states in the Empire, a process to be concluded only centuries later, notably with the Peace of Westphalia of 1648.\n\nCodification of Prince-Electors, though largely based on precedence, was not uncontroversial, especially in regard to the two chief rivals of the ruling House of Luxembourg:\n\nThe House of Wittelsbach ruled the Duchy of Bavaria as well as the County Palatinate. Dynastic divisions had caused the two territories to devolve upon distinct branches of the house. The Treaty of Pavia, which in 1329 restored the Palatinate branch, stipulated that Bavaria and the Palatinate would alternate in future elections, but the Golden Bull fixed the electoral vote upon the Palatinate and not upon Bavaria, partly because Charles’s predecessor and rival Ludwig IV was of that branch.\n\nLudwig IV’s sons, Ludwig V and Stephan II of Bavaria, protested this omission, feeling that Bavaria, one of the original duchies of the realm and their family’s chief territory for over 170 years, deserved primacy over the Palatinate. The omission of Bavaria from the list of Prince-Electors also allowed Bavaria, which had only recently been reunited, to fall into dynastic fragmentation again.\n\nBrandenburg was in the hands of the Bavarian Wittelsbachs (though held by a junior member of the house) in 1356; they eventually lost the territory to the Luxemburgs in 1373, leaving the Bavarian branch without representation in the electoral college until 1623.\n\nThe House of Habsburg, long-time rivals of the Luxembourgs, were completely omitted from the list of Prince-Electors, leading to decreased political influence and dynastic fragmentation. In retaliation, Duke Rudolph IV, one of the dukes of fragmented Austria, had the Privilegium Maius forged, a document supposedly issued by Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa.\n\nThe document gave Austria – elevated to the position of an Archduchy – special privileges, including primogeniture. While ignored by the Emperor and other princes at the time, the document was eventually ratified when Friedrich of Austria himself became Emperor in the 15th century. Still, the Habsburgs remained without an electoral vote until they succeeded to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526.\n\nProcedures\n\nThe bull regulated the whole election process in great detail, listing explicitly where, when, and under which circumstances what should be done by whom, not only for the prince-electors but also (for example) for the population of Frankfurt, where the elections were to be held, and also for the counts of the regions the prince-electors had to travel through to get there.\n\nThe decision to hold the elections in Frankfurt reflected a traditional feeling dating from days of the Kingdom of East Francia that both election and coronation ought to take place on Frankish soil. However, the election location was not the only specified location; the bull specified that the coronation would take place in Aachen, and Nuremberg would be the place where the first diet of a reign should be held. The elections were to be concluded within thirty days; failing that, the bull prescribed that the Prince-Electors were to receive only bread and water until they had decided.\n\nBesides regulating the election process, the chapters of the Golden Bull contained many minor decrees. For instance, it also defined the order of marching when the Emperor was present, both with and without his insignia.\n\nA relatively major decision was made in chapter 15, where Charles IV outlawed any conjurationes, confederationes, and conspirationes, meaning in particular the city alliances (Städtebünde), but also other communal leagues that had sprung up through the communal movement in mediaeval Europe. Most Städtebünde were subsequently dissolved, sometimes forcibly, and were re-founded, their political influence was much reduced. Thus the Golden Bull also strengthened the nobility in general to the detriment of the cities.\n\nThe pope’s involvement with the Golden Bull of 1356 was basically nonexistent, which was significant in the history of relations between the popes and the emperors. When Charles IV laid down procedure for electing a King of the Romans, he mentioned nothing about receiving papal confirmation of the election. However, Pope Innocent VI did not protest this because he needed Charles’s support against the Visconti. Pope Innocent continued to have good relations with Charles IV after the Golden Bull of 1356 until the former’s death in 1362.\n\nLudwig IV (April 1,1282 – October 11, 1347), called the Bavarian, of the house of Wittelsbach, was King of the Romans from 1314, King of Italy from 1327, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1328.\n\nLudwig was born in Munich, the son of Ludwig II, Duke of Upper Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, and Matilda Matilda was the eldest daughter of King Rudolph I of Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg.\n\nThough Ludwig was partly educated in Vienna and became co-regent of his brother Rudolph I in Upper Bavaria in 1301 with the support of his Habsburg mother and her brother, King Albrecht I, he quarreled with the Habsburgs from 1307 over possessions in Lower Bavaria.\n\nA civil war against his brother Rudolph due to new disputes on the partition of their lands was ended in 1313, when peace was made at Munich.\n\nTomb effigy at Munich Frauenkirche\n\nIn the same year, on November 9, Ludwig defeated his Habsburg cousin Friedrich the Fair who was further aided by duke Leopold I. Originally, he was a friend of Friedrich, with whom he had been raised. However, armed conflict arose when the guardianship over the young Dukes of Lower Bavaria (Heinrich XIV, Otto IV, and Heinrich XV) was entrusted to Friedrich, even though the late Duke Otto III, the former King of Hungary, had chosen Ludwig.\n\nOn November 9, 1313, Friedrich was defeated by Ludwig in the Battle of Gammelsdorf and had to renounce the tutelage. This victory caused a stir within the Holy Roman Empire and increased the reputation of the Bavarian Duke.\n\nThe death of Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich VII in August 1313 necessitated the election of a successor. Heinrich’s son Johann, King of Bohemia since 1310, was considered by many prince-electors to be too young, and by others to be already too powerful. One alternative was Friedrich the Fair, the son of Heinrich VII’s predecessor, Albrecht I, of the House of Habsburg.\n\nIn reaction, the pro-Luxembourg party among the prince electors settled on Ludwig of Bavaria as its candidate to prevent Friedrich’s election.\n\nOn October 19, 1314, Archbishop Heinrich II of Cologne chaired an assembly of four electors at Sachsenhausen, south of Frankfurt. Participants were Ludwig’s brother, Count Rudolph I of the Palatinate, who objected to the election of his younger brother, Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg, and Heinrich of Carinthia, whom the Luxembourgs had deposed as King of Bohemia. These four electors chose Friedrich as King.\n\nThe Luxembourg party did not accept this election and the next day a second election was held. Upon the instigation of Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz, five different electors convened at Frankfurt and elected Ludwig as King. These electors were Archbishop Peter himself, Archbishop Baldwin of Trier and King Johann of Bohemia – both of the House of Luxembourg – Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg and Duke Johann II of Saxe-Lauenburg, who contested Rudolph of Wittenberg’s claim to the electoral vote.\n\nThis double election was quickly followed by two coronations: Ludwig IV was crowned at Aachen – the customary site of coronations – by Archbishop Peter of Mainz, while the Archbishop of Cologne, who by custom had the right to crown the new king, crowned Friedrich at Bonn. In the following conflict between the kings, Ludwig IV recognized in 1316 the independence of Switzerland from the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nAfter several years of bloody war, victory finally seemed within the grasp of Friedrich, who was strongly supported by his brother Leopold. However, Friedrich’s army was decisively defeated in the Battle of Mühldorf on September 28, 1322 on the Ampfing Heath, where Friedrich and 1300 nobles from Austria and Salzburg were captured.\n\nLudwig IV held Friedrich captive in Trausnitz Castle (Schwandorf) for three years, but the determined resistance by Friedrich’s brother Leopold, the retreat of Johann of Bohemia from his alliance, and a ban by Pope John XXII, who excommunicated Ludwig IV in 1324, induced Louis to release Friedrich in the Treaty of Trausnitz of 13 March 1325.\n\nIn this agreement, Friedrich recognized Ludwig IV as the legitimate Emperor and undertook to return to captivity should he not succeed in convincing his brothers to submit to Ludwig.\n\nGolden Bull of Ludwig IV 1328\n\nAs he did not manage to overcome Leopold’s obstinacy, Friedrich returned to Munich as a prisoner, even though the Pope had released him from his oath. Ludwig IV, who was impressed by such nobility, renewed the old friendship with Friedrich, and they agreed to rule the Empire jointly.\n\nSince the Pope and the electors strongly objected to this agreement, another treaty was signed at Ulm on January 7, 1326, according to which Friedrich would administer German lands as King of the Romans, while Ludwig would be crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in Italy. However, after Leopold’s death in 1326, Friedrich withdrew from the regency of the Empire and returned to rule only Austria. Friedrich died on January 13, 1330.\n\nReturning from the Third Crusade, bad weather forced King Richard I of England’s ship to put in at Corfu, in the lands of Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who objected to Richard’s annexation of Cyprus, formerly Byzantine territory. Disguised as a Knight Templar, Richard sailed from Corfu with four attendants, but his ship was wrecked near Aquileia, forcing Richard and his party into a dangerous land route through central Europe.\n\nOn his way to the territory of his brother-in-law Heinrich XII the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, Richard was captured December 20, 1192 near Vienna by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, (member of the House of Babenberg) who accused Richard of arranging the murder of his cousin Conrad of Montferrat. Moreover, Richard had personally offended Leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of Acre.\n\nLeopold kept Richard prisoner at Dürnstein Castle under the care of Leopold’s ministerialis Hadmar of Kuenring. His mishap was soon known to England, but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts. While in prison, Richard wrote Ja nus hons pris or Ja nuls om pres (“No man who is imprisoned”), which is addressed to his half-sister Marie. He wrote the song, in French and Occitan versions, to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister. The detention of a crusader was contrary to public law, and on these grounds Pope Celestine III excommunicated Duke Leopold.\n\nOn March 28, 1193 Richard was brought to Speyer and handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich VI, who imprisoned him in Trifels Castle. Heinrich VI was aggrieved by the support the Plantagenets had given to the family of Heinrich XII the Lion and by Richard’s recognition of Tancred in Sicily. Heinrich VI needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern Italy and continued to hold Richard for ransom. Nevertheless, to Richard’s irritation, Celestine hesitated to excommunicate Heinrich VI, as he had Duke Leopold, for the continued wrongful imprisonment of Richard.\n\nRichard famously refused to show deference to the Emperor and declared to him, “I am born of a rank which recognises no superior but God”. The king was at first shown a certain measure of respect, but later, at the prompting of Philippe of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais and Philippe II of France’s cousin, the conditions of Richard’s captivity were worsened, and he was kept in chains, “so heavy,” Richard declared, “that a horse or ass would have struggled to move under them.”\n\nThe Emperor demanded that 150,000 marks (100,000 pounds of silver) be delivered to him before he would release the King, the same amount raised by the Saladin tithe only a few years earlier, and two to three times the annual income for the English Crown under Richard. Richard’s mother, Eleanor, worked to raise the ransom. Both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property, the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated, and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes.\n\nAt the same time, John, Richard’s brother, and King Philippe II of France offered 80,000 marks for Heinrich VI to hold Richard prisoner until Michaelmas 1194. Heinrich turned down the offer. The money to rescue the King was transferred to Germany by the Emperor’s ambassadors, but “at the king’s peril” (had it been lost along the way, Richard would have been held responsible), and finally, on February 4, 1194 Richard was released. Philip sent a message to John: “Look to yourself; the devil is loose”\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa (1122 – June 10, 1190), was the Holy Roman Emperor from January 2, 1155 until his death. He was elected King of the Germans at Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152. He was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia and emperor by Pope Adrian IV on June 18, 1155 in Rome. Two years later, the term sacrum (“holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178. He was named Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which has the same meaning.\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa\n\nBefore his imperial election, he was by inheritance Friedrich III, Duke of Swabia (1147–1152). He was the son of Duke Friedrich II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Judith, daughter of Heinrich IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Guelph. Friedrich, therefore, descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire’s prince-electors.\n\nFriedrich’s first wife Adelaide was a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold III of Vohburg (c. 1079 – 1146), probably from his first marriage with Adelaide (c. 1091 – 1127), a daughter of the Polish duke Władysław I Herman and Judith of Swabia. Since the days of Emperor Heinrich IV, her father’s ancestors ruled over the Egerland territory in the Bavarian March of the Nordgau, which, however, was seized by King Conrad III of Germany upon the margrave’s death in 1146.\n\nAdelaide and Friedrich’s marriage was not successful, however. According to some later sources, this was because Adelaide committed adultery. The couple remained childless. In 1153 Friedrich petitioned Pope Eugene III for an annulment. The separation was granted and confirmed by the Bishop of Constance in March 1153; the justification given on grounds of consanguinity. Friedrich immediately began to court the Byzantine princess Maria Komnena, though to no avail. Maria was the youngest child of Isaac Komnenos, son of John II Komnenos and elder brother of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and Isaacʻs first wife, Theodora, great-granddaughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nFriedrich’s second wife was Beatrice I (1143 – 15 November 1184) the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine. As the only child of her father, she was the heir of the County of Burgundy. At the death of her father in 1148, she inherited the vast County of Burgundy and became countess palatine in her own right. As such, she was one of the most desired brides in France, and a marriage was suggested to Emperor Frederick I.\n\nThe wedding between Beatrice and Friedrich took on June 9, 1156 at Würzburg. After the wedding, the Bishop of Trier anointed Beatrice queen. She was crowned empress by Antipope Paschal III in Rome on August 1, 1167, and as Queen of Burgundy at Vienne in August 1178.\n\nHoly Roman Empire during the reign of Friedrich I Barbarossa\n\nThe relationship between Beatrice and Friedrich is traditionally described as happy, and there is nothing to indicate that he was ever unfaithful to her. Though Beatrice was rumored to be greatly loved by Friedrich and thereby attributed influence over him in the sense that he had great affection for her, there is nothing to indicate that she acted as his political adviser and she is confirmed to be directly involved in a major political affair only once. In 1168 supported the election of bishop Peter of Cambrai and at successfully blocked the attempt of the archbishop Philip to transfer the bishopric of Cambrai from the metropolitan province of Riems to Cologne, supported by archbishop Christian of Mainz and Heinrich III-IV the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, this was reputedly the only case Beatrice took decisive action in a major political affair.\n\nThe couple had 11 children including Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, (1165 – 1197)\n\nHistorians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire’s greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity. His contributions to Central European society and culture include the reestablishment of the Corpus Juris Civilis, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the Investiture Controversy.\n\nFriedrich fought in the Third Crusade and on June 10, 1190, Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa drowned near Silifke Castle in the Saleph river. There are several conflicting accounts of the event. According to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Friedrich was thrown from his horse and the shock of the cold water caused him to have a heart attack. Weighed down by his armour, he drowned.\n\nWe’ve now reached the point in our survey of German History and the origins of the Holy Roman Empire that motivated me to do this history to begin with. After the treaty of Verdun in 843 and the establishment the Kingdom East Francia to first usage of the term Holy Roman Empire in the thirteenth century, this area of Central Europe was constantly in flux at a time when England and France (and later Spain) were moving toward being a centralized nation state. It is also at this juncture when terminology such as Kings of East Francia, King of the Germans and Roman Emperor have considerable overlap denoting the fact that the monarchy in German lands was constantly evolving.\n\nKingdom of East Francia/Germany\n\nEast Francia continued the Frankish tradition of dividing the lands among the sons of the king, as East Francia itself was divided into three parts at the death of Louis the German (875). These sub-kingdoms were ruled by the three sons of Louis the German and were traditionally referred to as “Saxony”, (ruled by Louis the Younger) and “Bavaria”, (ruled Carloman) and “Swabia” and also East Francia (or “Alemannia”), ruled by Charles the Fat who briefly reunited the entire Carolingian Empire (West and East Francia) in 882.\n\nRegional differences existed between the peoples of the different regions of the kingdom and each region could be readily described by contemporaries as a regnum, (Kingdom) though each was certainly not a kingdom of its own. The common Germanic language and the tradition of common rule dating to 843 preserved political ties between the different regna and prevented the kingdom from coming apart after the death of Charles the Fat. The work of Louis the German to maintain his kingdom and give it a strong royal government also went a long way to creating an East Frankish (i.e. German) state.\n\nCharles the Fat, King of East Francia, Emperor.\n\nCharles the Fat was deposed in 888 by nobles and in East Francia Arnulf of Carinthia was elected king. The increasing weakness of royal power in East Francia meant that dukes of Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, Saxony and Lotharingia (called the Stem Duchies) turned from appointed nobles into hereditary rulers of their territories. Kings increasingly had to deal with regional rebellions.\n\nAfter the death of Louis III the Child on September 24, 911, the last ruler of the Carolingian dynasty, Conrad the Younger of Thuringia was elected was elected king of Rex Francorum Orientalium (East Francia) on November 10, 911 at Forchheim by the rulers of Saxony, Swabia and Bavaria. Conrad was the son of duke Conrad of Thuringia (called the Elder) and his wife Glismut, probably related to Ota, wife of the Carolingian emperor Arnulf of Carinthia and mother of Louis the Child.\n\nSince King Conrad I of East Francia was one of the dukes of the Stem Duchies he found it very difficult to establish his authority over them. Duke Hienrich of Saxony was in rebellion against Conrad I until 915 and the struggle against Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria cost Conrad I his life. On his deathbed Conrad I chose Heinrich of Saxony as the most capable successor.\n\nHeinrich I, King of East Francia, Duke of Saxony\n\nThis election of Heinrich of Saxony as King changed the kingship from Franks to Saxons, who had suffered greatly during the conquests of Charlemagne.\n\nAny firm distinction between the kingdoms of Eastern Francia and the Kingdom of Germany is to some extent the product of later retrospection. It is impossible to base this distinction on primary sources, as the name Eastern Francia for the kingdom remains in use long after the name Kingdom of Germany comes into use.\n\nUnder Arnulf of Carinthia the terminology Rex Francorum Orientalium was largely dropped and the kingdom, when it was referred to by name, was simply Francia. When it was necessary, as in the Treaty of Bonn (921) with the West Franks, the “eastern” qualifier appeared once more. Henry I refers to himself as rex Francorum orientalium, “king of the East Franks”, in the treaty.\n\nBy the 12th century, the historian Otto of Freising, in using the Carolingian terminology had to explain that the “eastern kingdom of the Franks” (orientale Francorum regnum) was “now called the kingdom of the Germans” (regnum Teutonicorum).\n\nThe 12th century imperial historian Otto von Freisingreported that the election of Heinrich the Fowler was regarded as marking the beginning of the kingdom, though Otto himself disagreed with this. Thus:\n\nFrom this point some reckon a kingdom of the Germans as supplanting that of the Franks. Hence, they say that Pope Leo in the decrees of the popes, called Henry’s son Otto the first king of the Germans. For that Henry of whom we are speaking refused, it is said, the honor offered by the supreme pontiff. But it seems to me that the kingdom of the Germans — which today, as we see, has possession of Rome — is a part of the kingdom of the Franks. For, as is perfectly clear in what precedes, at the time of Charles the boundaries of the kingdom of the Franks included the whole of Gaul and all Germany, from the Rhine to Illyricum.\n\nWhen the realm was divided between his son’s sons, one part was called eastern, the other western, yet both together were called the Kingdom of the Franks. So then in the eastern part, which is called the Kingdom of the Germans, Henry was the first of the race of Saxons to succeed to the throne when the line of Charles failed … [western Franks discussed] … Henry’s son Otto, because he restored to the German East Franks the empire which had been usurped by the Lombards, is called the first king of the Germans — not, perhaps, because he was the first king to reign among the Germans\n\nIt is here and elsewhere that Otto von Freising distinguishes the first German king (Heinrich I) and the first German king to hold imperial power (Otto I).\n\nNext up will be the imperial coronation of Otto the Great.\n\nHere is the original post where I talk about Heinrich I the Fowler.\n\nhttps://europeanroyalhistory.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/on-this-date-in-history-july-2-936-death-of-heinrich-the-fowler-king-of-east-francia-and-german-history-part-i/"
