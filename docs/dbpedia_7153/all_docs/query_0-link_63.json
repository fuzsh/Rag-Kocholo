But then I appeared dressed as a poor woman in front of my people and thus gained their sympathy. They felt sorry for me and supported strongly my claim even threatening to start a rebellion. So my husband changed his mind especially after I bore him a son, Louis. Unfortunately, I died aged only 19 after my second childbirth.
