        "text": "New York State Medicaid\n\nNew York's Medicaid program provides comprehensive health coverage to more than 7.5 million New Yorkers (as of December 2023.) Medicaid pays for a wide-range of services, depending on your age, financial circumstances, family situation, or living arrangements. These services are provided through a large network of health care providers that you can access directly using your Medicaid card or through your managed care plan if you are enrolled in managed care. Some services may have small co-payments, which can be waived if you cannot afford them."
