        "text": "What News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists Do About this section\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists keep the public updated about current events and noteworthy information. They report international, national, and local news for newspapers, magazines, websites, television, and radio.\n\nDuties\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists typically do the following:\n\nResearch topics that an editor or news director has assigned to them\n\nDevelop relationships with experts and contacts who provide tips and leads on stories or articles\n\nInterview people who have information, analysis, or opinions about a story or article\n\nAnalyze and interpret information to increase audience understanding of the news\n\nWrite stories or articles for newspapers, magazines, or websites and create scripts to be read on television or radio\n\nReview stories or articles for accuracy, style, and grammar\n\nUpdate stories or articles as new information becomes available\n\nInvestigate new story or article ideas and pitch ideas to editors\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists often work for a particular type of media organization, such as a television or radio station, newspaper, or website.\n\nThose who work in television and radio set up and conduct interviews, which can be broadcast live or recorded for future broadcasts. These workers often edit interviews and other recordings to create a cohesive story or report, and they write and record voiceovers to provide the audience with supplementary facts or context. They may create multiple versions of the same story or report for different broadcasts or media platforms.\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists for print media conduct interviews and write stories or articles to be used in newspapers, magazines, and online publications. Because most newspapers and magazines have print and online versions, these workers’ content typically appears in both versions. As a result, they must stay up to date with developments related to a content item and update the online version with current information, if necessary.\n\nOutlets are increasingly relying on multimedia journalists to publish content on a variety of platforms, such as a video content on the website of a daily newspaper. Multimedia journalists typically record, report, write, and edit their own stories or articles. They also gather the audio, video, or graphics that accompany their content.\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists may need to maintain a social media presence. Many use social media to cover live events, provide additional information for readers and viewers, promote their stations and newscasts, and engage with their audiences.\n\nSome workers, particularly those in large cities or large news organizations, cover a particular topic, such as sports, medicine, or politics. Those who work in small cities, towns, or organizations may be generalists and cover a wide range of subjects.\n\nSome news analysts, reporters, and journalists are self-employed and accept freelance assignments from news organizations. Because freelancers are paid for individual stories or articles, they may work with many organizations and spend some of their time marketing their content and looking for their next assignment. Self-employed news analysts, reporters, and journalists also may publish news and videos on their own platforms.\n\nThe following are examples of types of news analysts, reporters, and journalists:\n\nColumnists write articles offering an opinion or perspective about a particular subject. They submit a piece to a publication, often on a schedule, such as once per week. Their work may be published in a newspaper, magazine, or other outlet or self-published on the columnist’s website.\n\nCorrespondents report the news to a radio or television network from a remote location. Those who cover international events, called foreign correspondents, often live in another country and report about a specific region of the world.\n\nNews anchors lead television or radio shows that describe current events. Others are news commentators who analyze and interpret reports and offer opinions. They may come from fields outside of journalism and have expertise in a particular subject, such as finance, and are hired on a contract basis to provide their opinion on that subject.\n\nThese workers also may collaborate with editors, photographers, videographers, and other reporters and journalists when working on an article or story.\n\nFor information about workers with a background in this field who teach journalism or communications at colleges and universities, see the profile on postsecondary teachers.\n\nHow to Become a News Analyst, Reporter, or Journalist About this section\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists typically need a bachelor’s degree to enter the occupation. Internship or work experience on a college newspaper, radio station, or television station also may be helpful.\n\nEducation\n\nNews analysts, reporters, and journalists typically need a bachelor’s degree in journalism, communications, or a related field, such as English.\n\nBachelor’s degree programs in journalism and communications include courses in journalistic ethics and techniques for researching topics and conducting interviews. Some programs may require students to study liberal arts subjects, such as history and economics, to prepare for covering a range of topics. Students may further specialize in the type of journalism they wish to pursue, such as print or broadcast.\n\nJournalism students may benefit from courses in multimedia design, coding, and programming to be able to develop content that includes video, audio, data, and graphics.\n\nOther Experience\n\nEmployers generally prefer to hire candidates who have had an internship or have worked on school newspapers, radio stations, or TV stations. While attending college, students may seek multiple internships with different news organizations. Internships allow students to gain experience and develop samples of their writing or their on-air appearances.\n\nNews commentators who come from a field outside of journalism typically have expertise in areas on which they comment.\n\nAdvancement\n\nAfter gaining experience, field reporters at a local news station may become that station’s anchor. News analysts, reporters, and journalists may also advance by moving from news organizations in small cities or towns to news organizations in large cities. Large markets may offer opportunities for more responsibility and challenges. Reporters and journalists also may become editors or news directors.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. News analysts, reporters, and journalists must be able to clearly convey information. Strong writing skills also are important.\n\nInterpersonal skills. To develop contacts and conduct interviews, news analysts, reporters, and journalists must be able to build relationships. They also need to work well with other journalists, editors, and news directors.\n\nPersistence. News analysts, reporters, and journalists must be determined when pursuing stories or articles. Investigating topics and gathering facts may be difficult, particularly when those involved refuse to be interviewed or to provide comment.\n\nStamina. The work of news analysts, reporters, and journalists is often fast paced and exhausting. They must be able to adapt to the irregular hours of work.\n\nTechnological skills. News analysts, reporters, and journalists should be able to use editing equipment and other broadcast-related devices. They also should be able to use multimedia and coding software in order to publish stories on websites and mobile devices."
