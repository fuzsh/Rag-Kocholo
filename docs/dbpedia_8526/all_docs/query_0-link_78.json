        "text": "BERLIN — German news is getting more gender-neutral.\n\nThat’s what eight leading news agencies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland announced on Monday. The agencies, which supply news to major media outlets across the German-speaking world, said they would be more sensitive when it comes to discriminatory language.\n\nTheir decision is the latest development in Germany’s battle over gender-neutral language, a debate often referred to as the country’s very own culture war.\n\nGerman, like many other languages, assigns a gender to all nouns. Campaigners for change argue that this can be problematic, for example when the masculine plural form is used as a general plural. The word Schüler, for instance, is generally applied to a group of male and female school pupils.\n\nThe campaigners say that language should be adjusted to explicitly include women and the non-binary, pointing to studies showing that language shapes the way people see the world. Opponents argue that gender-neutral language can be cumbersome, ugly to read and awkward to pronounce. Many question whether there is any need to change the language at all.\n\nThe agencies — which set the tone for the German language read and heard by millions of people every day — ended up choosing a middle way, reflecting the wide variety of audiences they serve. They had been asked for their view by daily newspapers, which use agency material — and faced a dilemma.\n\n“When they start using gender-neutral language, they have problems with their older print readership. If they don’t, they’ll have problems with their younger employees and with some of their digital users,” said Sven Gösmann, editor-in-chief of the German Press Agency (DPA).\n\nThe agencies agreed to use a range of linguistic tweaks such as writing both masculine and feminine forms for plurals, with the feminine first: “school pupils” would be “Schülerinnen und Schüler,” for example.\n\nFor now, at least, they decided not to adopt more radical changes, such as the so-called gender star, which places an asterisk before the feminine word-ending to include females, males, and the non-binary: Schüler*innen, for example.\n\nLuise F. Pusch — a linguist and proponent of change who has worked on the issue for over 40 years — described the new modus operandi as “a clear win for the feminist movement.”\n\nSome other German news outlets have already made changes to their use of language in response to the ongoing debate. Gösmann said the news agencies would keep the issue under review, closely observing how language is changing. The direction of travel was clear, he said, if not the final destination.\n\n“We know where the journey is going, but not how far the journey will take us,” he said."
