        "text": "Have you received unsolicited mobile text messages with an unfamiliar or strange web link that indicates a USPS delivery requires a response from you? If you never signed up for a USPS tracking request for a specific package, then don’t click the link! This type of text message is a scam called smishing.\n\nSmishing is a form of phishing that involves a text message or phone number. Victims will typically receive a deceptive text message that is intended to lure the recipient into providing their personal or financial information. These scammers often attempt to disguise themselves as a government agency, bank, or other company to lend legitimacy to their claims. USPS utilizes the 5-digit short codes to send and receive SMS to and from mobile phones.\n\nThe criminals want to receive personally identifiable information (PII) about the victim such as: account usernames and passwords, Social Security number, date of birth, credit and debit card numbers, personal identification numbers (PINs), or other sensitive information. This information is used to carry out other crimes, such as financial fraud.\n\nThe Postal Service offers free tools to track specific packages, but customers are required to either register online, or initiate a text message, and provide a tracking number. USPS does not charge for these services! USPS will not send customers text messages or e-mails without a customer first requesting the service with a tracking number, and it will NOT contain a link. So, if you did not initiate the tracking request for a specific package directly from USPS and it contains a link: don’t click the link!\n\nIf you suspect the text message you have received is suspicious but are expecting a parcel, please do not click on any links. Rather, report it and visit USPS.com from your mobile device or computer for tracking and additional resources.\n\nFor more information about these services and other products, please visit USPS TEXT TRACKING FAQs:\n\nTo protect yourself and others from consumer frauds, visit our fraud prevention page.\n\nHOW TO REPORT USPS Related SMISHING:\n\nTo report USPS related smishing, send an email to spam@uspis.gov.\n\nWithout clicking on the web link, copy the body of the suspicious text message and paste into a new email.\n\nProvide your name in the email, and also attach a screenshot of the text message showing the phone number of the sender and the date sent.\n\nInclude any relevant details in your email, for example: if you clicked the link, if you lost money, if you provided any personal information, or if you experienced any impacts to your credit or person.\n\nThe Postal Inspection Service will contact you if more information is needed.\n\nForward the smishing/text message to 7726 (this will assist with reporting the scam phone number).\n\nComplaints of non-USPS related smishing can also be sent to any of the following law enforcement partners of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service:\n\n• Forward to 7726 (this will assist with reporting the scam phone number).\n\n• Report fraud to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n• The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI), Internet Crime Complaint Center (ic3)\n\nALSO SEE BRUSHING >"
