        "text": "AP’s audio content always must be accurate. We do not alter or manipulate newsmaker actuality in any way, except as provided below:\n\nWith the permission of a manager, overly long pauses by news subjects may be shortened.\n\nTo make sound clearer, the AP does permit the use of subtle, standard audio processing methods: normalization of levels, general volume adjustments, equalization and reduction of extraneous sounds such as telephone line noise. AP permits fading in and out of the start and end of sound bites. However, the use of these methods must not conceal, obscure, remove or otherwise alter the content of the audio.\n\nBleeping is allowed, with a manager’s permission, to cover obscenities when there is no option but to use a piece of audio containing an obscenity. An employee with questions about the use of such methods or the AP’s requirements and limitations on audio editing should contact the desk supervisor prior to the transmission of any audio.\n\nWe don’t use sound effects or substitute video or audio from one event to another. We do not “cheat” sound by adding audio to embellish or fabricate an event. A senior editor must be consulted prior to the introduction of any neutral sound (ambient sound that does not affect the editorial meaning but corrects a technical fault).\n\nVoice reports by AP correspondents may be edited to remove pauses or stumbles.\n\nAUDIO & VIDEO\n\nThe AP does permit the use of the subtle, standard audio processing methods of normalization of levels, general volume adjustments, equalization to make the sound clearer, noise reduction to reduce extraneous sounds such as telephone line noise, and fading in and out of the start and end of sound bites _ provided the use of these methods does not conceal, obscure, remove or otherwise alter the content, or any portion of the content, of the audio. When an employee has questions about the use of such methods or the AP’s requirements and limitations on audio editing, he or she should contact the desk supervisor prior to the transmission of any audio.\n\nAP images must always be accurate. We do not alter or digitally manipulate the content of a photo or video except as stated below.\n\nPHOTO\n\nWe avoid the use of generic photos or video that could be mistaken for imagery photographed for the specific story at hand, or that could unfairly link people in the images to illicit activity. No element should be digitally altered except as described below.\n\nMinor adjustments to photos are acceptable. These include cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, elimination of dust on camera sensors and scratches on scanned negatives or scanned prints and normal toning and color adjustments. These should be limited to those minimally necessary for clear and accurate reproduction and that restore the authentic nature of the photograph. Changes in density, contrast, color and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable. Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning. The removal of “red eye” from photographs is not permissible.\n\nEmployees with questions about the use of such methods or the AP’s requirements and limitations on photo editing should contact a senior photo editor prior to the transmission of any image.\n\nVIDEO\n\nFor video, the AP permits the use of subtle, standard methods of improving technical quality, such as adjusting video and audio levels, color correcting due to white balance, eliminating buzzing, hums, clicks, pops, or overly long pauses or other technical faults, and equalization of audio to make the sound clearer _ provided the use of these methods does not conceal, obscure, remove or otherwise alter the content of the image.\n\nVideo can produced with titles and logos, the images toned and the audio quality improved.\n\nWhen editing audio within a video, generally the specific audio associated with each video shot must be used without alteration. However in cases where music is the principal ambient sound – e.g. when the video portrays a marching band or an orchestra playing – audio may be laid unbroken and video images edited over the top, provided the video was shot contemporaneously and the meaning of the scene is not altered.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nPhoto-based graphics, including those for television, often involve combining various photographic elements, which may mean altering portions of each photograph. The background of a photograph, for example, may be removed to leave the headshot of the newsmaker. This may then be combined with a logo representing the person’s company or industry, and the two elements may be layered over a neutral background.\n\nSuch compositions must not misrepresent the facts and must not result in an image that looks like a photograph – it must clearly be a graphic.\n\nSimilarly, when we alter photos to use as graphics online, we retain the integrity of the image, limiting the changes to cropping, masking and adding elements like logos.\n\nIt is permissible to display photos online using techniques such as 360- degree panoramas or dissolves as long as they do not alter the original images.\n\nVideos for use online can be altered to add graphical information such as titles and logos, to tone the image and to improve audio quality. It is permissible to display videos online using techniques such as 360-degree panoramas or dissolves as long as they do not alter the original footage.\n\nAcceptable 360-degree video\n\nAn AP staffer who reports and writes a story must use original content, language and phrasing. We do not plagiarize, meaning that we do not take the work of others and pass it off as our own.\n\nWhen we match a report that a news outlet was first with due to significant reporting effort, we should mention that the other outlet first reported it. At the same time, it is common for AP staffers to include in their work passages from previous AP stories by other writers – generally background, or boilerplate.\n\nThis is acceptable if the passages are short. Regardless, the reporter writing the story is responsible for the factual and contextual accuracy of the material. Also, the AP often has the right to use material from its members and subscribers; as with material from other news media, we credit it. Unless we are clearly retransmitting in full a story by a member outlet, we do not transmit stories in their original form; we rewrite them, so that the approach, content, structure and length meet our requirements and reflect the broader audience we serve.\n\nUnder no circumstances can news releases be published in their original form; we can use information, quotes and properly cleared images from releases, but we must judge the material’s credibility, augment it with information from other sources, and then prepare our own stories, with the release material duly credited.\n\nFor video, if another broadcaster’s material is required and distributed, we advise the name of that broadcaster on the accompanying shot list. Pickups of audio and of television graphics are credited in billboards/captions when the source requests it.\n\nVIDEO & BROADCAST\n\nFor video, if another broadcaster’s material is required and distributed, the name of that broadcaster shall be advised on the accompanying shotlist.\n\nPickups of audio and of television graphics are credited in billboards/captions when the member requests it.\n\nTransparency is critical to our credibility with the public and our subscribers. Whenever possible, we pursue information on the record. When a newsmaker insists on background or off-the-record ground rules, we must adhere to a strict set of guidelines, enforced by AP news managers.\n\nUnder AP’s rules, material from anonymous sources may be used only if:\n\nThe material is information and not opinion or speculation, and is vital to the report.\n\nThe information is not available except under the conditions of anonymity imposed by the source.\n\nThe source is reliable, and in a position to have direct knowledge of the information.\n\nReporters who intend to use material from anonymous sources must get approval from their news manager before sending the story to the desk. The manager is responsible for vetting the material and making sure it meets AP guidelines. The manager must know the identity of the source, and is obligated, like the reporter, to keep the source’s identity confidential. Only after they are assured that the source material has been vetted by a manager should editors and producers allow it to be used.\n\nReporters should proceed with interviews on the assumption they are on the record. If the source wants to set conditions, these should be negotiated at the start of the interview. At the end of the interview, the reporter should try once again to move onto the record some or all of the information that was given on a background basis.\n\nThe AP routinely seeks and requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous. Stories should be held while attempts are made to reach additional sources for confirmation or elaboration. In rare cases, one source will be sufficient – when material comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.\n\nWe must explain in the story why the source requested anonymity. And, when it’s relevant, we must describe the source’s motive for disclosing the information. If the story hinges on documents, as opposed to interviews, the reporter must describe how the documents were obtained, at least to the extent possible.\n\nThe story also must provide attribution that establishes the source’s credibility; simply quoting “a source” is not allowed. We should be as descriptive as possible: “according to top White House aides” or “a senior official in the British Foreign Office.” The description of a source must never be altered without consulting the reporter.\n\nWe must not say that a person declined comment when that person the person is already quoted anonymously. And we should not attribute information to anonymous sources when it is obvious or well known. We should just state the information as fact.\n\nStories that use anonymous sources must carry a reporter’s byline. If a reporter other than the bylined staffer contributes anonymous material to a story, that reporter should be given credit as a contributor to the story.\n\nAll complaints and questions about the authenticity or veracity of anonymous material – from inside or outside the AP – must be promptly brought to the news manager’s attention.\n\nNot everyone understands “off the record” or “on background” to mean the same things. Before any interview in which any degree of anonymity is expected, there should be a discussion in which the ground rules are set explicitly.\n\nThese are the AP’s definitions:\n\nOn the record. The information can be used with no caveats, quoting the source by name.\n\nOff the record. The information cannot be used for publication. Background. The information can be published but only under conditions negotiated with the source. Generally, the sources do not want their names published but will agree to a description of their position. AP reporters should object vigorously when a source wants to brief a group of reporters on background and try to persuade the source to put the briefing on the record.\n\nDeep background. The information can be used but without attribution. The source does not want to be identified in any way, even on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn general, information obtained under any of these circumstances can be pursued with other sources to be placed on the record.\n\nANONYMOUS SOURCES IN MATERIAL FROM OTHER NEWS SOURCES\n\nReports from other news organizations based on anonymous sources require the most careful scrutiny when we consider them for our report.\n\nAP’s basic rules for anonymous source material apply to material from other news outlets just as they do in our own reporting: The material must be factual and obtainable no other way. The story must be truly significant and newsworthy. Use of anonymous material must be authorized by a manager. The story we produce must be balanced, and comment must be sought.\n\nFurther, before picking up such a story we must make a bona fide effort to get it on the record, or, at a minimum, confirm it through our own reporting. We shouldn’t hesitate to hold the story if we have any doubts. If another outlet’s anonymous material is ultimately used, it must be attributed to the originating news organization and note its description of the source.\n\nATTRIBUTION\n\nAnything in the AP news report that could reasonably be disputed should be attributed. We should give the full name of a source and as much information as needed to identify the source and explain why the person s credible. Where appropriate, include a source’s age; title; name of company, organization or government department; and hometown. If we quote someone from a written document – a report, email or news release — we should say so. Information taken from the internet must be vetted according to our standards of accuracy and attributed to the original source. File, library or archive photos, audio or videos must be identified as such. For lengthy stories, attribution can be contained in an extended editor’s note detailing interviews, research and methodology.\n\nAnything in the AP news report that could reasonably be disputed should be attributed.

Much of the account was confirmed in multiple interviews with rescue workers, Coli’s mother, his brother and his former marabout. To report on Coli’s rescue and return home, an AP reporter and photographer visited the school and the shelter, accompanied Coli on the trip to Guinea- Bissau, and waited with him until his mother arrived.\n\nACCEPTABLE EDITOR’S NOTE EXAMPLE 2\n\nEditor’s note — Pat Valdes’ criminal history comes from interviews with INS investigator David Fry, Border Patrol agent Rudy Valdez, other investigators, and prosecutors, as well as from interviews with and letters from Valdes. Details of the investigation come from those sources and from court records and trial testimony. Details of Roman Valdes’ 1999 and 2002 interrogations and of Pat Valdes’ 2002 arrest come from Border Patrol videotapes and interviews with agents. Scenes from Pat Valdes’ trial are from trial transcripts and interviews with a juror, investigators, and prosecutors Tom Roepke and Greg McDonald. Details of the truck drivers’ sentencing are from court transcripts, interviews with prosecutors, and the reporter’s observations.\n\nACCEPTABLE EDITOR’S NOTE EXAMPLE 3\n\nIn other cases, especially with state-by-state packages, we write a separate, extensive note on our methodology. This is an example:\n\nSCHOOLHOUSE SEX ASSAULT\n\nSexual assault on college campuses has made headlines for years, but The Associated Press sought to determine whether it also is a problem among younger students and, if so, to what extent.\n\nThere are no federal requirements for elementary and secondary schools to report such assaults and academic research aimed at quantifying the number of assaults at schools throughout the U.S. has been based only on sample surveys.\n\nThe AP sent queries to public education departments in every state and the District of Columbia for all available years of statistics on sexual assaults by students. Ultimately, AP compared states across a four-year period — academic years 2011-2012 through 2014-2015 — the time frame with the most consistent reporting.\n\nAP counted only those cases that met the federal government’s definition of sexual assault — “any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient” — including forced sexual intercourse or sodomy, fondling and attempted rape. Excluded were minor incidents that might have resulted from childish misunderstandings and overly broad categories like sexual harassment or bullying, which included non-physical incidents or did not specify instances of sexual assault.\n\nThe education data included sexual assaults by students that led to discipline, as well as those that did not, and reflected offenses that occurred on school property or at school-sponsored events.\n\nFew states kept information on victims, but data from states that tracked both showed the vast majority of student sexual attacks were against other students.\n\nFor states with no education data, AP looked to the National Incident-Based Reporting System, a voluntary network of official crime reports from participating states. AP used the two most recent publicly available years of NIBRS data (2013-2014) and filtered it for incidents at schools, both public and private.\n\nThe incidents counted were limited to only those occurring at an elementary or secondary school involving sexual assault codes for rape, sodomy, penetration with an object or unwanted fondling. Cases of statutory rape and consensual underage sex were excluded.\n\nIncidents were further limited to only those involving victims and perpetrators between five and 19, the age group most likely falling into the K-12 student body. Cases without a known perpetrator — or cases where either the perpetrator’s or victim’s age was not provided — were excluded.\n\nWhile AP’s accounting of schoolhouse sexual assault is a first of its kind, the number surely is an undercount because of missing and inconsistent data and a lack of oversight by states or the federal government.\n\nA dateline tells the reader where we obtained the basic information for a story. A byline tells the reader who wrote the story.\n\nOn short, un-bylined stories (routine speeches, game stories, announcements, etc.), the dateline generally should reflect where the story took place. However, when a story is longer, contains multiple elements, has analytical material or occurs at a place that is difficult for reporters to access, the dateline should be where the staffer covering the story is located.\n\nWhen a datelined story contains supplementary information obtained in another location – say, when an official in Washington comments on a disaster elsewhere – we should note it in the story. The dateline for video, photos or audio must be the location where the events depicted actually occurred. For voice work, the dateline must be the location from which the reporter is speaking; if that is not possible, the reporter should not use a dateline. If a reporter covers a story in one location but does a live report from another location, the dateline is the filing point.\n\nFor text stories with datelines, bylines may be used only if the journalist was in the datelined location. If a reporter in the field works with another staffer and both deserve bylines, the name of the staffer in the field normally goes first and a tag line gives each staffer’s location. We give bylines in text stories to photographers, broadcast reporters and video journalists who provide information without which there would be no story.\n\nFor stories without datelines, the byline goes to the writer, with credit in a tag line o the reporters who contributed substantial information.\n\nFor staffers who do voice or on-camera work, we do not use pseudonyms or “air names.” Any exceptions – for instance, if a staffer has been known professionally by an air name for some time – must be approved by a manager.\n\nAUDIO & VIDEO\n\nThe dateline for video or audio must be the location where the events depicted actually occurred. For voice work, the dateline must be the location from which the reporter is speaking; if that is not possible, the reporter should not use a dateline. If a reporter covers a story in one location but does a live report from a filing point in another location, the dateline is the filing point.\n\nA dateline tells the reader where we obtained the basic information for a story. A byline tells the reader who wrote the story.\n\nOn short, un-bylined stories (routine speeches, game stories, announcements, etc.), the dateline generally should reflect where the story took place.

In general, the byline should go to the staffer who reported the key facts. Or, one staffer can take the byline for one cycle, and another for the following cycle.\n\nA double byline or editor’s note also can be used when more than one staffer makes a substantial contribution to the reporting or writing of a story. Credit lines recognize reporting contributions that are notable but don’t call for a double byline.\n\nIf either of the staffers with a double byline was not in the datelined location, we should say who was where in a note at the story’s end.\n\nFor roundups, the byline goes to the writer, with credit in an editor’s note to the reporters who contributed substantial information.\n\nRegarding credits for staffers who do voice or on-camera work: We do not use pseudonyms or “air names.” Any exceptions – for instance, if a staffer has been known professionally by an air name for some time – must be approved by a manager.\n\nAP resists being used as a conduit for speech or images that espouse hate or spread propaganda. When hate speech or images are the basis of a news story, it is often sufficient to briefly refer to the speech or images in a text story rather than carry the speech or propaganda at length or redistribute the images. A senior manager must vet any material showing hostages or conveying kidnappers’ statements or demands. Quoting from such materials should be kept to the minimum necessary to convey the story and must note that the hostage is speaking under duress.\n\nWe do not use obscenities, racial epithets or other offensive slurs in stories unless they are part of direct quotations and there is a compelling reason for them. We do not run imagery of such slurs; a manager must be consulted regarding any exceptions.\n\nIf a story cannot be told without reference to slurs, we must first try to find a way to give the reader a sense of what was said without using the specific word or phrase. If a profanity, obscenity or vulgarity is used, the content must be flagged at the top, advising editors of what the offensive material is.\n\nRecognizing that standards differ around the world and from platform to platform, we tailor our advisories and selection of video and audio according to customer needs.\n\nWe do not refer readers to websites that are obscene, racist or otherwise offensive, and we must not directly link from stories to such sites.\n\nWe link our text content to the least offensive image necessary to tell the story. For photo galleries and interactive presentations we alert readers to the nature of the material in the link and on the opening page of the gallery or interactive.\n\nPHOTO\n\nA photo containing something that could be deemed offensive must carry an editor’s note flagging it.\n\nACCEPTABLE\n\nThis photo moved with an “Eds Note” to call attention to the nudity and it was restricted from major online portals, such as Yahoo and MSN so it wouldn’t automatically show up in their newsfeed. Those sites could use it, but they would have to download it from AP Newsroom.\n\nEDS NOTE: NUDITY A naked man shouts before jumping from the ledge above the TKTS Broadway ticket booth in New York’s Times Square, Thursday, June 30, 2016. Police said the man, who was shouting about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was conscious after the jump of about 16 feet off the booth.\n\nAP PHOTO\n\nAUDIO & VIDEO\n\nWhen a piece of video or audio contains something that might be deemed offensive, we flag it in the written description (rundown, billboard and/or script) so clients know what they are getting. Recognizing that standards differ around the world, we tailor our advisories and selection of video and audio according to customer needs.\n\nACCEPTABLE\n\nThis video clip moved with a “Clients Note” to call attention to the offensive language in the soundbite.\n\nCLIENTS NOTE: EDIT CONTAINS OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE\n\n1.

Wide of Duterte on stage\n\nTEXT\n\nWe take great care not to refer readers to Web sites that are obscene, racist or otherwise offensive, and we must not directly link our stories to such sites.\n\nIn our online service, we link the least offensive image necessary to tell the story. For photo galleries and interactive presentations we alert readers to the nature of the material in the link and on the opening page of the gallery or interactive. If an obscene image is necessary to tell the story, we blur the portion of the image considered offensive after approval of the department manager, and flag the video."
