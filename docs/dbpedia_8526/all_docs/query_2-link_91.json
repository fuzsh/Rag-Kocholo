Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nA description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.\n\nAdditional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive.\n\nresults of tests from Public Health Laboratories Week 32\n\nData Cumulative since\n\nOctober 1, 2023\n\n(Week 40) No. of specimens tested 954 124,462 No. of positive specimens 60 39,084 Positive specimens by type/subtype Influenza A 59 (98.3%) 29,967 (76.7%) Subtyping performed on specimens\n\n50 (84.7%) 25,353 (84.6%) (H1N1)pdm09 15 (30.0%) 16,649 (65.7%) H3N2 35 (70.0%) 8,691 (34.3%) H3N2v 0 (0.0%) 1 (<0.1%) H5* 0 (0.0%) 12* (<0.1%) Subtyping not performed 9 (15.3%) 4,614 (15.4%) Influenza B 1 (1.7%) 9,117 (23.3%) Lineage testing performed on specimens\n\n1 (100.0%) 7,936 (87.0%) Yamagata lineage 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Victoria lineage 1 (100.0%) 7,936 (100.0%) Lineage testing not performed 0 (0.0%) 1,181 (13.0%)\n\n* This data reflects specimens tested and the number determined to be positive for influenza viruses at the public health labs (specimens tested is not the same as cases). It does not reflect specimens tested only at CDC and could include more than one specimen tested per person. The guidance for influenza A/H5 testing recommends testing both a conjunctival and respiratory swab for people with conjunctivitis which has resulted in more specimens testing positive for influenza A/H5 than the number of human H5 cases. For more information on the number of people infected with A/H5, please visit the “How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situation”\n\nNovel Influenza A Virus:\n\nA human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The patient was infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is < 18 years of age, sought healthcare during the week ending July 27, 2024 (Week 30), and was admitted to hospital due to a pre-existing condition. The patient is currently recovering. An investigation by state and local public health officials did not find any exposure to swine or attendance at an agricultural event prior to patient’s illness onset. Further investigation did not identify illness among close contacts of the patient.\n\nOne other case of influenza A (H3N2)v and three cases of influenza A (H1N2)v were also reported during the 2023-2024 season bringing the total to 5 variant influenza cases this season. No new human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported during Week 32. A total of 13 cases of human infection with influenza A (H5) have been reported this season, bringing the current total to 18 novel influenza A cases reported during the 2023-2024 season. An ongoing outbreak of H5N1 continues in domestic dairy cattle and poultry, and monitoring for additional cases is ongoing.\n\nWhen an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a “variant” influenza virus. Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human transmission can occur. It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.\n\nEarly identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be understood, and appropriate public health measures can be taken.\n\nAdditional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza virus infection in humans, and guidance to interact safely with swine can be found at www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.\n\nAdditional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses:\n\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive\n\nCDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses.\n\nInfluenza A Viruses\n\nA (H1N1)pdm09: 561 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 560 (99.8%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nA (H3N2): 626 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 594 (95%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nInfluenza B Viruses\n\nB/Victoria: 400 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nB/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization.\n\nFour A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275Y/H, conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B viruses had NA-A245G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B virus had NA-D197N amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by zanamivir and peramivir. One B virus had NA-H273Y amino acid substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\n\nHigh levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented.\n\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\n\nThe U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website.\n\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Visits\n\nNationally, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness that were reported through ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to the previous week and is below the national baseline. All 10 regions are below their region-specific baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.\n\nHospitalization Surveillance\n\nFluSurv-NET\n\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.\n\nA total of 25,338 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and August 10, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in week 32 was 0.1 per 100,000 population. The peak weekly hospitalization rate observed this season was 8.9 per 100,000 population and occurred during week 52.\n\nAmong 25,338 hospitalizations, 21,432 (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, 3,738 (14.8%) with influenza B virus, 53 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 115 (0.5%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 4,325 (67.5%) were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 2,082 (32.5%) were A(H3N2).\n\nWorld Health Organization:\n\nAdditional influenza surveillance information from participating WHO member nations is available through\n\nFluNet and the Global Epidemiology Reports.\n\nWHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza:\n\nAustralia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States (CDC in Atlanta, Georgia)\n\nEurope:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from Europe is available from WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from Canada is available in Canada’s weekly FluWatch report.\n\nPublic Health England:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from the United Kingdom is available from Public Health England.\n\nAny links provided to non-Federal organizations are provided solely as a service to our users.
