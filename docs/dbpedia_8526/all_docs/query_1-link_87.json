Initially introduced as a virtual currency in twelve EU member states, it is now widely used in twenty countries with a total population of around 344 million. But what does this mean for Germany? Has the Euro been an anchor of stability in turbulent times or a marker of excessive regulation and centralisation?\n\nHow to enter\n\nEntries should be 400-450 words in length and written in German. The topic may be addressed from any angle; your submission may take the form of a discursive essay, or you may choose a more creative form. Entries will be judged on the basis of both content and language.\n\nEntries should be submitted by e-mail, together with the entry form, to catherine.smale@kcl.ac.uk by 20th February 2024.\n\nPrizes\n\nThe author of the winning entry will receive a book token and will have their submission published in the Königspost, the German-language magazine produced by students at King's College London, which has a wide circulation among university students and language learners across the UK. Prizes will also be awarded to runners-up.\n\nAll participants will be invited to a workshop and prize-giving ceremony at King’s College London in March 2024."
