        "text": "NewsGuard employs a team of journalists and experienced editors to produce reliability ratings and scores for news and information websites based on nine journalistic criteria. The criteria assess basic practices of credibility and transparency. Based on a site’s performance on these nine apolitical criteria, which are each weighted differently with the points for all adding up to 100, it is assigned a 0-100 score, also expressed as 0% to 100%, and a rating level indicating the degree to which it adheres to the weighted criteria. The accompanying Nutrition Label, accessible by clicking through from the listed score, then explains how NewsGuard arrived at its assessment.\n\nRating Criteria\n\nNewsGuard‘s scores and ratings for news and information sites are based on nine apolitical criteria that assess the website’s credibility and transparency. As noted, each criterion is worth a certain number of points out of 100, weighted based on importance, as indicated below. All criteria are pass-fail, meaning that a site either receives all of the points associated with the criterion or receives no points for that criterion. In some instances, this may make the scores less precise, but the alternative of giving sites some but not all of the relevant points is not feasible for a process that involves rating thousands of news sites.\n\nIn some specific cases described below, a site can receive an “N/A” for a criterion that NewsGuard determines does not apply to the website, in which case the publisher receives the points associated with that criterion.\n\nAgain, satire sites and platforms are given separate designations and are not scored using the nine criteria.\n\nEach score is described in detail in the Nutrition Label, which explains why NewsGuard made its determination on each of the criteria, provides evidence and examples to back up its assessments, includes any relevant comments from the publisher, and indicates the history of the sites’ ratings. We always seek feedback from publishers that appear to fail any of our criteria before we publish a rating or an updated rating, ensuring a publisher ability to reply.\n\nThe criteria below are listed in order of their importance in determining a site’s 0-100 score.\n\nLast updated February 3, 2023\n\nTransparency\n\nWebsite discloses ownership and financing: The site discloses in a user-friendly manner its ownership and/or financing, as well as any notable political affiliations or financial interests relevant to the site’s coverage held by those with a significant financial interest in the site. Put simply, the reader should know who is funding the content and what relevant interests the owner or funder might have in the content. (7.5 Points)\n\nSee Details\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might pass this criterion:\n\nThe website clearly identifies its owner in a prominent, easily accessible section of the site.\n\nIf any of the site’s owners or major funders has a notable political affiliation, financial interest, or other role or affiliation that might present a conflict of interest with the site’s coverage, that information is disclosed clearly to readers.\n\nThe site discloses its ownership and financing in specific stories that refer to the owner or to subjects of coverage connected to the owner or funder.\n\nIf the site is owned by a nonprofit organization, the site identifies major donors in a place where a user can find that information easily.\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might fail this criterion:\n\nThe site does not clearly identify its owner, including any parent company.\n\nThe site’s only mention of its owner is in a place that an average user would not be likely to look, notice, or understand, such as a copyright notice or on a “Terms of Service” page.\n\nThe site is owned by a nonprofit but does not identify its major donors, if any.\n\nThe site does not disclose potential conflicts of interest involving its owners and financers in individual stories related to the owner or funders.\n\nClearly labels advertising: The site makes clear which content is paid for and which is not. (7.5 Points)\n\nSee Details\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might pass this criterion:\n\nAdvertising is distinguished from editorial content either with clear visual cues or explicit labels such as “advertisement,” “paid content,” “sponsored,” or another label an average reader would understand indicates that the content is paid.\n\nIf the site publishes a sponsored or promotional article alongside straightforward news content, it distinguishes the article by disclosing to readers that the content is paid in a prominent place, such as at the beginning of the sponsored article or at the headline. A disclosure at the bottom of a long article or in a small, hard-to-notice typeface does not meet this standard.\n\nIf the site publishes content via a commercial content-sharing arrangement or partnership, the site discloses that arrangement or partnership.\n\nIf the site publishes an article with affiliate links, it clearly discloses somewhere on the article page, in a location and manner that an average reader could find, that the site may earn revenue from purchases made through the links.\n\nHere are some of the reasons that a site might fail this criterion:\n\nThe site presents sponsored and promotional articles alongside straightforward news content on the site without clearly distinguishing which is which.\n\nThe site includes links to buy products within its articles for which it receives affiliate or referral payments without clearly and prominently disclosing that commercial arrangement to readers.\n\nThe site publishes paid content, affiliate links, and other commercial content that is labeled in a manner that the average reader would not understand to mean that the content is commercial — such as “From Our Partners” or “Around the Web.”\n\nThe site is paid to run promotional articles on behalf of a company or organization but does not disclose the commercial relationship to a reader.\n\nSites receive an “N/A” on this criterion if:\n\nThe site does not publish advertisements or sponsored content.\n\nReveals who’s in charge, including possible conflicts of interest: Those in charge of the content are identified on the site, and there is a way for readers to contact the site about editorial issues. In other words, the reader is told who is in charge of deciding what content is published. (5 Points)\n\nSee Details\n\nHere are some of the reasons that a site might pass this criterion:\n\nThe website identifies someone in charge of editorial decisions in an easily accessible section of the site and provides some way for readers to contact the site about editorial issues.\n\nIf the site’s editorial leaders have a significant potential conflict of interest, such as involvement in a political campaign or with a company on which the site reports, any such conflicts are disclosed to readers.\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might fail this criterion:\n\nThe website does not identify someone who oversees editorial content, or only does so on a page that is not easily accessible to an average visitor to the site.\n\nEven if the site lists the name of a person in charge of editorial content, it does not provide any way for users to contact the site about editorial issues.\n\nOne or more of the site’s editorial leaders has a significant potential conflict of interest, such as involvement in a political organization or with a company about which the site reports, that is not disclosed to readers.\n\nThe site provides the names of content creators, along with either contact or biographical information: Information about those producing the content is made accessible on the site, and it is generally clear who produces which content. (5 Points)\n\nSee Details\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might pass this criterion:\n\nContent is typically attributed to an author or content creator whose full name is provided, and the site provides either contact information or relevant biographical information for most content creators. (Examples of contact information include the content creator’s phone number, email address, Twitter handle, or other method through which the content creator can be contacted.)\n\nIf content is not typically attributed to a specific author or content creator, the website provides a staff directory listing the names, relevant biographical information, and contact information for its content creators, along with an indication of the general topics or areas of coverage to which each content creator contributes.\n\nIf content on the site is regularly produced by artificial intelligence, that is disclosed in a reader-friendly manner.\n\nHere are some reasons that a site might fail this criterion:\n\nContent never or rarely is attributed to a specific author or content creator.\n\nContent often is bylined with only the author or content creator’s first name, initials, or a pseudonym.\n\nContent is attributed to specific authors or content creators, but the site does not provide contact information or relevant biographical information about its content producers.\n\nThere is evidence that the content on the site is regularly produced by artificial intelligence without clear disclosure, or content that is produced by AI is attributed to a writer at the publication.\n\nNote: Some publications tell NewsGuard that they decline to name their content creators for fear that they will be subject to reprisal or that doing so is an invasion of their privacy. In some instances, this is a legitimate concern and constitutes a strong argument against this criterion. However, NewsGuard believes that as a general matter journalists should stand behind, and be accountable for, their work. Thus, it remains a weakness of the NewsGuard system that otherwise highly professional news websites operating in areas where journalists may be in jeopardy will get a 95 Green score instead of a 100. This reflects the fact that operating in certain regions or countries means this disclosure is impractical, depriving readers of this information."
