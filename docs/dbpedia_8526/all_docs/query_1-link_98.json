        "text": "Delivering a Bad News Message\n\nDelivering a Bad News Message\n\nThere are two approaches you can use to deliver a negative news message–the direct approach and the indirect approach. We’ll go through each of these in turn.\n\nDirect approach\n\nThe direct approach is often used when the audience values brevity, the message needs to be concise, the message is very complex and might not be understood easily, the message is related to a known issue or problem (and bad news won’t be a surprise), or you’re terminating a business relationship.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4.11.1, the bad news is announced in the opening or introduction of the message.\n\nFigure 4.11.1 An example of a bad news message delivered using the direct approach\n\nIndirect approach\n\nThe first part of a negative news message, verbal or written, is a buffer statement. It provides neutral or positive information. It sets the tone and often serves as a cushion for the information to come. It is important that the buffer not be overly positive because this can be misleading or set up the reader to expect a positive news message instead.\n\nExplanation\n\nNext, an explanation discusses why there is an issue. This may be relatively simple, quite complex, or uncomfortable. While an explanation is important, never admit or imply responsibility without written authorization from your company cleared by legal counsel. Try to avoid labeling the bad news, such as calling it inconvenient or disappointing, because this can assume the feelings of your reader and create a negative impression. The person receiving the message may not have felt badly about receiving the news until you pointed out that it was indeed inconvenient or disappointing.\n\nBreak the bad news\n\nThe third part of the negative news message involves the bad news itself, and the emphasis here is on clarity and accuracy. While you want to break the bad news clearly, try not to spotlight it.\n\nRedirect or provide alternatives\n\nThe fourth part of a bad news message is the redirect, where you refocus attention on a solution strategy, possible alternatives, or the subsequent actions that will take place.\n\nEnd politely and forward-looking\n\nLast, you want to end your message politely and looking to the future. Don’t mention the bad news again!"
