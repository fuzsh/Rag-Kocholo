        "text": "What a great app!\n\nI like that the stories are short, so I avoid the risk of losing concentration before the end and becoming demotivated, as it can happen when reading from other sources. The items varied, not just negative news. The built-in dictionary works very well and allows you to check quickly without breaking concentration. I will certainly recommend it to other German learners that I know. I just wish I had had it earlier in my German learning journey. Thanks to the team and best of luck!\n\nRobert Weedall - German learner\n\nNatural language, great learning tool\n\nYou’ll learn German words in the context they’re written which helps with memory retention. Comprehension quizzes get harder as you read higher levels. Grammar examples are helpful to direct your attention to the sentence structure. They also have flashcards!\n\nKaren Smith - German learner\n\nThis is my favorite app to learn German\n\nHaving a dedicated app that focuses primarily on reading by offering stories written by the levels A1, A2, B1, B2, etc. is critical for reading progression. Having built in word definitions and grammar lookup is awesome. And then having audio by word, sentence, and the entire story PLUS the option to control the audio speed is incredible. You need this app if you are serious about learning German.\n\nFranco - German learner\n\nOne of my favorite German learning apps to date.\n\nIt mixes context-based learning of vocabulary and grammar with the option for flashcard-like memorization and reinforcement of user-selected words. The articles are interesting and cover a diverse array of topics to keep the user engaged. Overall, I think the concept and execution of this app is one of the best I’ve come across in my language learning journey thus far.\n\nHannah - German learner\n\nWow! A very good app!\n\nI just started using it but very impressed with the audio and the whole setup of this app. Good job to all who developed this program. I will learn so much from this.\n\nDyan H. - German student\n\nLearners can check in occasionally to take advantage of our rotating free stories, but unlimited access to all stories at once does cost a small fee, which we use to keep improving Readle."
