        "text": "Germany's competitive television market is the largest in Europe, with more than 38 million TV households.\n\nThe many regional and national public broadcasters - organised in line with the federal political structure - vie for audiences with powerful commercial operators. Each of Germany's 16 regions regulates its own private and public broadcasting.\n\nThe national public broadcasters are TV networks Das Erste and ZDF, and Deutschlandradio. Public TV and radio are funded by a \"broadcasting contribution\" paid by each household. Deutsche Welle (DW) is Germany's international broadcaster.\n\nGermany is home to some of the world's largest media conglomerates, including Bertelsmann and the publisher Axel Springer. The top free-to-air commercial TV networks are operated by RTL Group and ProSiebenSat1 Media.\n\nGermans are avid newspaper readers and the non-tabloid press is a trusted news source. There are several national newspapers, but the press is strongest at the regional and local level. Bild tabloid is the best-selling daily.\n\nMedia freedom is enshrined in the constitution. While the press and broadcasters are free and independent, the display of swastikas and statements endorsing Nazism are illegal.\n\nThere were 79.1 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 94% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). The leading social network is Facebook, with more than 46 million users."
