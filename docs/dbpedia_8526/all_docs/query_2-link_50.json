        "text": "You can keep your partners, team, and colleagues in the loop as well as engage them with important or interesting stories by using the News feature on your team site. You can quickly create eye-catching posts like announcements, people news, status updates, and more that can include graphics and rich formatting. In addition to the web experience described below, you can also create and view news from the SharePoint mobile app for iOS.\n\nNote: Some functionality is introduced gradually to organizations that have opted in to the Targeted Release program. This means that you may not yet see this feature or it may look different than what is described in the help articles.\n\nFor a brief introduction to creating news, check out this video:\n\nFor a visual overview of News, check out the infographic, Read all about it: Microsoft SharePoint News, which can be downloaded as a .PDF or PowerPoint template on Ways to work with SharePoint.\n\nWhere news is shown\n\nNews is shown as a personalized feed on the SharePoint start page and in the mobile app. It can also be shown on team sites, communication sites, and hub sites. You can also choose to show News in a Teams channel.\n\nPersonalized news feed\n\nThe SharePoint news system surfaces a personalized news feed in a few places, one of them being at the top of the SharePoint start page in the section titled News from sites.\n\nThe SharePoint start page is accessed from the Microsoft 365 App Launcher when you select SharePoint.\n\nThe personalized news feed is also available in the SharePoint mobile app on iOS and Android in the left tab titled News. A personalized news feed can also show on a page when a page author has set up the News web part to use the option Recommended for current user as a news source.\n\nHow news posts for the personalized feed are determined\n\nUsing the power of Microsoft Graph, SharePoint blends news in your personalized feed from:\n\nPeople you work with\n\nYour followed sites\n\nYour frequently visited sites\n\nNote: You may see news in your personalized feed from a site you've recently visited only once. Unless you frequent or follow this site, it will eventually cycle out of your feed as new news posts fill your feed.\n\nNotifications on mobile\n\nWhen an important, relevant news article is posted by someone in your close sphere of work, or posted to a site in which you are active, you will receive a notification on your mobile device ‘from SharePoint’ within your device’s notification tray. When you click on a notification, you are taken directly into the SharePoint mobile app to view the news article and all its data-rich, interactive content.\n\nHow news posts notifications are determined\n\nUsing the power of Microsoft Graph, SharePoint sends notifications based on:\n\nPeople you work with\n\nYour followed sites\n\nNote: Viva Connections mobile news notifications are now available as an alternative distribution endpoint.\n\nOrganization news\n\nNews can come from many different sites. but there might be \"official\" or \"authoritative\" sites for organization news. News from these sites are distinguished by a color block on the title as a visual cue, and are interleaved throughout all news posts displayed for users on the SharePoint start page. The following image shows news on SharePoint home where News@Contoso is the organization news site.\n\nTo enable this feature and specify the sites for organization news, a SharePoint global admin must use the SharePoint Powershell commands:\n\nGet-SPOOrgNewsSite\n\nSet-SPOOrgNewsSite\n\nSharePoint admins can specify any number of organization news sites. For multi-geo tenants, organization news sites would have to be set up for each geo location. Each geo location could use the same central organization news site, and/or have its own unique site that shows organization news specific to that region.\n\nTo learn more about how to set up an organization news site, see Create an organization news site."
