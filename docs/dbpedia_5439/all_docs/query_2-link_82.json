        "text": "With the release of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, the long-running film franchise now has ten films. Throughout its semicentennial lifespan, the series has undergone several drastic evolutions, going from meditative science-fiction epics to corny blockbusters and back again multiple times.\n\nNo two Planet of the Apes films are alike; needless to say, some are better than others. Here are our rankings of all the Planet of the Apes series films, from worst to best.\n\n10. Planet of the Apes (2001)\n\nAfter an almost forty-year hiatus, 2001’s Planet of the Apes set out to bring the series back into the spotlight. With acclaimed director Tim Burton at the helm, everyone assumed Planet of the Apes would put the series back on the map.\n\nIt did, but not in the way Planet of the Apes fans had hoped it would. While Rick Baker’s prosthetic effects are undeniably impressive, the film’s decision to trade the original’s thoughtful social commentary for easily digestible man vs. ape action left the film feeling shallow. Coupled with a wooden cast of human leads and a muddled plot ending in a frustratingly confusing “plot twist,” it’s easy to see why Burton’s take sent the series into another extended hibernation.\n\n9. Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nThe final film in the original Planet of the Apes saga, Battle for the Planet of the Apes chronicles Caesar’s attempt to preserve the fragile peace between the apes and humans who survived nuclear armageddon. Unfortunately, a militant gorilla general and a league of anti-ape humans soon rise to challenge Caesar’s ideals.\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes benefits from an enticing premise and a strong performance by lead actor Roddy McDowell. However, the film’s exceptionally shotty costume design and limp climax prevent it from being the epic, cathartic finale it could have been.\n\n8. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nDespite being a direct sequel to the original Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is anything but a by-the-books continuation. Turning the camera away from the apes and introducing a tribe of telepathic, subterranean humans, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is the strangest and most controversial film in the series.\n\nWhile some viewers applaud Beneath the Planet of the Apes‘ willingness to defy audience expectations, others are critical of the film’s surreal atmosphere and surprisingly bleak tone.\n\n7. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nThe darkest film in the series, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes shoves the series’ underlying themes of oppression and revolution to the forefront. Set in a post-plague United States where apes are slaves, the film follows the time-traveling chimpanzee Cornelius and Zira’s son Milo’s transforming from a meek circus ape to a violent revolutionary.\n\nWearing its political undertones on its sleeves, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is a gritty, angry film that thoroughly explores humanity’s capacity for violence. While the version that made its way to theaters toned things down by changing its brutal ending, the film remains a haunting meditation on the horrors of slavery and the consequences of violent uprisings.\n\n6. Planet of the Apes (1968)\n\nThe film that started it all, the original Planet of the Apes is a film that everyone knows about, if only through pop-culture osmosis. Following the trials and triumphs of an astronaut stranded in a world where apes rule, the film is as iconic as it is for a reason.\n\nWith a compelling premise, powerhouse lead, and an intriguing story that ends in one of the most iconic twists of all time, Planet of the Apes is one of the most influential science-fiction movies ever made.\n\n5. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nDespite Beneath the Planet Apes‘s best efforts, Escape from the Planet of the Apes found a new way to keep the original franchise going: time travel. In an attempt to escape the impending demise of their world, chimpanzee scientists Cornelius and Zira travel back in time to the then-present year of 1971, with their presence creating a self-fulfilling time-loop that will change the future of humans and apes forever.\n\nSporting a well-written script and powerful performances from its costumed leads, Escape from the Planet of the Apes weaves an emotional story about empathy, parenthood, and racial unrest that’s as relevant today as it was over fifty years ago.\n\n4. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024)\n\nThe newest film in the series, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, picks up where Matt Reeves’ Planet of the Apes trilogy left off, with the civilization of apes led by Casaer firmly established as the dominant species on the planet. The film follows Noa, a young chimpanzee who must journey across the post-apocalyptic United States to rescue his tribe from the mad dictator Proximus Caesar, leading him toward a fateful encounter with a young human named Mae.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes has many great things going for it, including top-tier special effects and an excellent cast of characters with fun and exciting relationships. While the film does more sequel-baiting than I would have liked, it’s still a fun, heartfelt experience that stands on its own as a solid series relaunch.\n\n3. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\nThe first entry in Matt Reeve’s three-part revival, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, is an excellent start to the franchise’s most recent chapter. The film follows Caesar, a chimpanzee taken into the home of the kind researcher who rescues him from an inhumane laboratory. From there, Caesar experiences humanity’s capacity for unconditional love and unflinching cruelty, transforming into the leader who helps other rapidly evolving apes find freedom.\n\nRise of the Planet of the Ape is everything movie-goers look for in a reboot. With an intelligent script that stays true to the series’ themes, some well-shot action, and a compelling new protagonist, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the triumphant return to form that fans of the series had spent decades waiting for.\n\n2. War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes brings Matt Reeves’ trilogy to a brutal, beautiful, and bittersweet end. After a ruthless militia declares war on Caesar’s tribe, he and his people embark on an epic journey that forces the increasingly-messianic ruler to question what kind of future he’s built for his family and whether his pacifistic approach to human-ape relations will bring prosperity or ruin.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes lives up to its title in every way imaginable, with the filmmakers drawing clear inspiration from war movies like Apocalypse Now and The Bridge on the River Kwai. With another well-written screenplay that analyzes the cyclical nature of violence and the renewing power of hope, War for the Planet of the Apes is an epic conclusion to an already fantastic trilogy.\n\n1. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare middle chapters of a trilogy that surpasses the films that came before and after it. Ten years after the simian flu outbreak, Caesar and his tribe are approached by a group of humans who want to ally with them, sparking tension between him and his second in command, Koba.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Dawn of the Planet of the Ape is everything you’d want out of a Planet of the Apes movie: gorgeous special effects, excellent cinematography, and compelling conflict that makes it hard to tell at times who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong. Whether you’re in the mood for some top-tier action or up for an emotional tour de force, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is for you."
