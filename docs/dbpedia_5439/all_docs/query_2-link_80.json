        "text": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes officially landed on Hulu on August 2, joining the other nine films in the Planet of the Apes franchise. If you’re planning to have a movie marathon, discover how to watch Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from the comfort of your home below.\n\nThe sequel is the fourth installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise and follows 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes. Set several generations after Caesar’s reign, it depicts a future where apes have become the dominant species while humans live in the shadows. “As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike,” the official synopsis reads.\n\nDirector Wes Ball admitted to The Wrap that he initially wasn’t sure how to approach creating Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. “I had this skepticism of how you follow up that last trilogy,” he explained. “You need to have that distance so you’re not just constantly compared or tethered to that trilogy. Having that time jump was a big opening to me.”\n\nForbesReview: 'Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes' Delivers A Glorious New Chapter\n\nThe director had the idea to focus the story on a young chimpanzee named Noa, who teams up with a human woman named Mae to shape the future for both apes and humans. “Mae would be this puzzle that you sort of have to unwrap a little bit as the story goes,” Ball continued. “It was just a matter of degrees on how capable or uncapable she was.”\n\nBall added that he also knew who the villain in the sequel would be early on. “Pretty quickly I had this character idea of a Genghis Khan-type that was rediscovering electricity and who may or may not have some connection to Caesar,” Ball said, referring to the Andy Serkis character from the previous trilogy.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes premiered in theaters on May 10, 2024, and earned $58.5 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $170 million domestically and $394 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo, making it the second-highest-grossing launch in the film series.\n\nHow To Stream Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes\n\nAs of August 2, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is available to stream on Hulu.
