        "text": "Disney and 20th Century’s “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” conquered the international box office again with $40.6 million in its second weekend of release.\n\nSo far, the fourth chapter in the “Apes” reboot franchise has generated $136 million overseas and $237 million globally. It currently stands as the fourth-highest grossing movie of the year, behind “Kung Fu Panda 4” ($533 million), “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” ($561 million) and “Dune: Part Two” ($710 million).\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” cost $160 million to produce, so it needs to keep swinging at the box office to justify its price tag. International ticket sales will be key in turning a profit in its theatrical run. Top overseas markets include China with $20.4 million, France with $13.8 million, Mexico with $12 million and the U.K. with $10 million.\n\nIn a distant second place, Paramount and director John Krasinski‘s “IF,” a fantasy-comedy aimed at young kids, collected $20 million from 58 markets. The film opened in the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office with $35 million and has generated $59 million globally to date. Those returns are decent for an original PG family film, except it cost $110 million to make and many millions more to market. So, “IF” needs staying power and positive word-of-mouth to portend a strong theatrical run.\n\nKrasinski wrote, directed, produced and stars in “IF,” which follows Brooklyn-dwelling neighbors Cal and Bea (Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming) with the ability to see other people’s imaginary friends (IF, for short). Steve Carell, Matt Damon, Maya Rudolph, Emily Blunt, Bradley Cooper, Jon Stewart and George Clooney round out the star-studded voice cast of IFs — though their voices will likely be dubbed for foreign markets. So far, the top international earners have been the U.K. with $3.2 million, Mexico with $2.8 million and Australia with $2 million.\n\nElsewhere, Sony’s “The Garfield Movie” added $10.2 million from 27 territories, bringing its international tally to $49 million. Over the weekend, it opened in South Korea with $1.3 million and Mexico with $1.9 million. The animated adventure, centering on the famous orange cat that hates Mondays and loves lasagna, opens in the U.S. and Canada on Memorial Day weekend. It’ll compete for the spotlight with “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” as well as “IF.”"
