        "text": "1. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nIt is the middle instalment of the recent trilogy of reboots that shows the series at its most thrilling, ambitious and disturbing. The performance-capture technology reaches new levels of sophistication, while incoming director Matt Reeves gives notice that the time for monkeying around is over. Nowhere is this more apparent than when Koba (Toby Kebbell), volatile rival to the level-headed Caesar (Andy Serkis), turns tomfoolery into terror, waging war on humankind with one burst of his automatic weapon. Hairy, scary stuff.\n\n2. Planet of the Apes (1968)\n\n“Amazing effects,” enthuses Bernard (Dylan Moran) in the Channel 4 sitcom Black Books. “You really believed that monkeys could have meetings.” But it’s the shock ending, in which Charlton Heston does a spot of impromptu Manhattan sightseeing, that secures for all time the reputation of the original movie.\n\n3. War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nThe heaviest episode yet, with Caesar as Christ and/or Moses butting heads with a deranged Kurtz-style Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Intense battle scenes qualify this as a full-blown war movie, which may explain the slight box-office slump. Plus, it was the only summer blockbuster to have been set largely in a labour camp.\n\n4. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nAll the Apes films are dark, but this has the edge in the 1970s cycle. Enslaved apes led by Caesar (series regular Roddy McDowall) overthrow the “lousy human bastards”. Dodgy makeup and a tacked-on hopeful ending can’t detract from the film’s allusions to real-world racial tensions.\n\n5. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\nSurprise of the Planet of the Apes: this first instalment of the latest trilogy is not bad at all. Best bits: the eerie moment when laboratory apes begin to communicate secretly among themselves in sign language, and the spectacular final showdown on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n6. Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off! (1996)\n\nAn honorary mention for the musical glimpsed in The Simpsons episode A Fish Called Selma. Bart says “This play has everything!” and he’s not wrong: breakdancing apes, genius lyrics (“I hate every ape I see/ From chimpan-A to chimpanzee”) and Troy McClure as Heston singing You’ll Never Make a Monkey Out of Me as the Statue of Liberty looks on.\n\n7. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nWhen its predecessor (Beneath …) was an unexpected success, 20th Century Fox sent screenwriter Paul Dehn a telegram: “Apes exist. Sequel required.” His inspired solution? Shockwaves from Beneath’s explosive climax catapult three apes through a time warp and back to Earth where they arrive before the events of the original film.\n\n8. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nThe budget of the first film was halved, the spectacle massively reduced. The only one of the original series not to feature McDowall, this also consigns Heston to a supporting role, throws in some bomb-worshipping mutants and ends with the planet being destroyed. Anti-war overtones abound.\n\n9. Planet of the Apes (2001)\n\nIt is hard to disagree with Mark Wahlberg, star of Tim Burton’s dreary, uninspired remake, who said: “[The studio] didn’t have the script right.” After a promising first hour, with Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Giamatti excelling as apes, this swaps allegory for mindless action, topped off by a failed attempt to out-twist the original ending.\n\n10. Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nPros: songwriter Paul Williams and esteemed director John Huston are among the ape cast. Cons: everything else, including minimal locations, listless action and a visibly underpopulated cast of extras in rubber masks. This is by far and away the worst in the series or I’m a monkey’s uncle."
