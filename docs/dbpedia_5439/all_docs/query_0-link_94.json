        "text": "Apparently, you simply cannot kill a damn, dirty ape. Despite a number of previous individual and box-set releases, the Planet of the Apes franchise is once again hitting the market in a gorgeously packaged, feature-rich set worthy of a place in your poo-flinging DVD collection. This time, however, it hits on Blu-ray in a set containing each of the original films with a number of new and updated featurettes.\n\nWith the exception of the Bond franchise and the various installments of The Pink Panther, no collection of movies has achieved the legendary status of Planet of the Apes series. The difference between secret agents and clumsy detectives notwithstanding, what truly distinguishes the Apes from their counterparts is the franchise's palpable social commentary, which infuses each film with a seeming larger purpose than the mere motions of a conventional blockbuster.\n\nBut whether you choose to view the films as spectacular mediations on animal rights, cultural divides, and antiwar messages or just the stuff of Hollywood spectacle, there's something here for everyone - epic and intimate, live-action and animated, comic and cathartic.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes: 40-Year Evolution Blu-ray set includes:\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nCommentary by Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Natalie Trundy and Makeup Artist John Chambers\n\nCommentary with Composer Jerry Goldsmith\n\nText Commentary by Eric Greene and Author of \"Planet of the Apes as American Myth\"\n\nScience of the Apes BONUSVIEW - Scientists, anthropologists and sociologists discuss the facts and fiction of the first film (NEW)\n\nBeyond the Forbidden Zone Adventure Game (NEW)\n\nA Public Service Announcement From ANSA in HD – A mission report from the agency regarding their brave astronauts (NEW)\n\nEvolution of the Apes - HD featurette tracing the apes story from the original novel to the screen (NEW)\n\nImpact of the Apes\n\nBehind the Planet of the Apes Documentary\n\nBehind the Planet of the Apes Promo (1988)\n\nPlanet of the Apes Makeup Test with Edward G. Robinson (1966)\n\nRoddy McDowall On-set Footage\n\nPlanet of the Apes Dailies and Outtakes (No Audio)\n\nPlanet of the Apes NATO Presentation (1967)\n\nPlanet of the Apes Vintage Featurette (1968)\n\nOf all the chapters in this ongoing franchise, the original film is absolutely the most jam-packed with additional content. Much of this might be familiar to die-hard fans who already own previous iterations of the series on DVD, but there's certain enough new content here to merit another visit. The commentaries still hold up extraordinarly well, packed with personality and anecdotes about the film's creation. Certainly the cast commentary is the most interesting, while Goldsmith's is slightly less engaging and the text commentary by Greene requires a bit more effort and attention on the part of the viewer.\n\nThe \"Science of the Apes\" BonusView track proves to be a very fun, very informative inclusion, allowing viewers to select brief, 2-3 minute clips which elaborate upon a particular thought, idea or subject corresponding the film as it plays. Scientists, anthropologists and sociologists each weigh in with their thoughts on technology, religion, social structures, animal rights and other such related topics. \"Impact of the Apes\" focuses on the studio's attempt to market the film and its long-lasting effects on our current, pop-culture generation of filmgoers and filmmakers. Alternately, \"Impact of the Apes\" follows the strange mythology from its original novelization to its adaptation for the silver screen, tracing the kernel of the original idea and how the film ultimately differs from the book.\n\nThe classic, two-hour, must-watch documentary \"Behind the Planet of the Apes\" reappears here with a new interactive feature, allowing viewers to bring up text windows providing facts, stories, bios and descriptions of whatever the subject currently on-screen. It's the essentially the BonusView version of the making-of doc. Thankfully, the feature helps to enhance the experience for the most curious viewers, and the documentary itself is still wildly comprehensive and informative.\n\nAnd the fun continues further into the series with the original's four, equally classic sequels.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nFrom Alpha to Omega: Building a Sequel\n\nIsolated Soundtrack\n\nTrailer\n\nImage Galleries\n\nEscape From the Planet of the Apes\n\nThe Secret Behind Escape\n\nDon Taylor Directs Escape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nIsolated Score\n\nTrailer\n\nImage Galleries\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nUnrated and Theatrical Versions\n\nRiots and Revolutions: Confronting the Times (NEW)\n\nA Look Behind the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nJ. Lee Thompson Directs Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nIsolated Score (Unrated Version Only)\n\nInteractive Pressbook\n\nTrailer\n\nImage Galleries\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nExtended and Theatrical Versions\n\nEnd of an Epic: The Final Battle (NEW)\n\nIsolated Score\n\nInteractive Pressbook\n\nTrailer\n\nImage Galleries\n\nThe rest of the films each post a wonderful set of image galleries and a handful of high-class isolated scores, but ultimately don't provide anywhere near as much material as the original film. The director profiles are interesting, and the original 1972 promo materials are a welcome addition, but it's the new material that really stands out. \"Riots and Revolutions\" on Conquest is a fantastic new feature which examines in-depth the way in which the latter Apes films dealt with the subject of race, holding up a mirror against the violence of the times. \"End of an Epic\" on Battle is a kind of overview of the series and a chronicle of its final conclusion. The battle between the original, more darker vision of the final film and the studio's desire for a lighter finale is rather fascinating to watch here, as one writer transitions to another and the voice of the series changes in its last moments.\n\nThe HD presentations are exceptionally well done. The jump to Blu-ray allows for a great level of detail and notically more well-sustained color. The films still retain their dated level of grain, but there's enough polish here to make a film nearly 40 years old seem much more current. Very little artifcating or overly noticeable digitization, combined with the sharp colors and excellent contrast, make for a great-looking set of transfers sure to make any true Apes fan proud.\n\nThe 5.1 DTS tracks are also a tremendously effective inclusion, having cleaned up the source material and added a few surround-sound flourishes. The soundtrack pulses, the synthesizers blare, gunshots ring out with high clarity and the occasional explosion carries a room-shaking amount of bass. Overall, these are all extremely worthwhile mixes which become more and more complex as the series becomes more and more intense.\n\nFinally, the packaging is first rate. Presented in a multi-panel fold-out booklet, the series also comes with a massive, full-color book of photography following the production of each film and a handy, comprehensive timeline of the Apes universe.\n\nOverall, the Planet of the Apes: 40-Year Evolution is by all measures the definitive franchise set, moreso than any that has come before, but its ultimate appeal to consumers is relative to their individual interest in (or worship of) the collected works. Beyond even the packaging, which earns a deserved place among DVD's best-ever designs – and certainly because of the full-color, 200-page Apes history book -- the high-def transfers of this classic sci-fi series makes for a must-own, all-time, unbeatable package. It might lack the 2001 remake or episodes of the TV show which were included in the past Ultimate Apes collection, but all of the added bonus material, and the absolute focus on the core films in the franchise give this set a clear advantage."
