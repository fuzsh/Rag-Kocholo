        "text": "That’s an awful lot of work for a planet. With all that battling and dawning and beneath-ing, it must be exhausted! And I haven’t even mentioned the two television series from my youth or the questionable first reboot from 2001 that starred Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nIt seemed we were going to escape from the planet of the apes when director Matt Reeves brought the last trilogy of films to a fitting end with Caesar’s demise in “War.” But “Kingdom” doesn’t take place in Caesar’s era. Instead, it fast-forwards hundreds of years, putting it in line with Heston’s original. The world is run by highly intelligent apes, and humans (called “echos” here) have returned to a feral state.\n\nAn opening screen reminds us that the reason for the swap in evolution is a virus. In the pre-credits sequence that follows, Caesar is given a Viking funeral. His philosophies will influence future generations, though like many a charismatic and powerful figure, his words will be twisted and corrupted by others.\n\nOnce the film steps into its current timeframe, we meet a cast of new characters who, with two exceptions, are either uninteresting or one-note. A chimpanzee named Noa (Owen Teague) is our dull new protagonist; let’s just say he’s no Caesar.\n\nNoa, along with his chimp pals Anaya (Travis Jeffery) and Soona (Lydia Peckham) are first seen hunting for eagle eggs. They embark on this treacherous journey for some kind of bonding ritual between the apes and the birds they raise. When an accident destroys Noa’s egg, his quest for another puts his clan in the crosshairs of wannabe ape king Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand).\n\nThough Proximus cuts a striking figure, he’s reduced to one trait: All his scenes consist of him yelling, which has become easy shorthand for villainy in far too many films over the past 10 years; it’s akin to the mustache twirling of the silent era. Proximus kills Noa’s father and kidnaps his friends, setting Noa on yet another quest.\n\nSince Ball wants to conjure up memories of the Rod Serling-scripted 1968 film, “Kingdom” needs a human the apes are shocked to learn hasn’t been rendered mute and feral by that virus. Mae (Freya Allan) fits the bill here, and though she doesn’t get to utter Heston’s immortal dis, “take your stinkin’ paws offa me, you damn dirty ape,” she definitely conveys the sentiment.\n\nFortunately, Noa and Mae have a common enemy: Proximus. He’s hunting Mae down because she wants to restore humankind to the top of the food chain. These problems put the duo in contact with the film’s only interesting characters: William H. Macy’s book-loving human, Trevathan, and Raka (Peter Macon), a wise, hermetic orangutan. Both make the most of their limited screentime.\n\nMacon uses the technology that renders his character to maximum effect: Raka’s facial expressions are on par with Serkis’s best scenes from the prior installments. He gives the best performance in “Kingdom.”\n\nWith a shaggy hairstyle and a thick gray beard, Macy looks like he’s auditioning for a Grizzly Adams remake. He serves as Proximus’s source for knowing all things human. Trevathan educates Proximus in the human world in scenes that play like a dramatic version of the “I Wan’na Be Like You” King Louie musical number from Disney’s “The Jungle Book.”\n\nMuch to Mae’s chagrin, Trevathan has welcomed his simian overlords, so he’s useless to help her overthrow them.\n\nUnlike its 21st-century predecessors, which aimed more for thrills, “Kingdom” wants to make some deep political statement. The screenplay by Josh Friedman is too timid to cause much controversy. Some critics saw the original film as an allegory on race, which was really just an excuse for them to legitimize seeing Black people as monkeys and apes. Nothing but trouble awaits anyone who applies that theory here.\n\nWith all the species of apes coming together here, “Kingdom” aims for some sort of anti-fascism and anti-gun statement. But the film tramples on its own undeveloped ideas when it suddenly become a large-scale actioner. It’s as if the studio had a carnage meter that had to hit 11 before fadeout.\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” doesn’t have characters we care about or situations we can easily follow. It’s all CGI bells and whistles. Then, before you can say, “Ooh! Help me, Dr. Zaius!,” the movie’s over — and you’re cast out of the theater and back onto your own planet.\n\n★★\n\nKINGDOM OF THE PLANET OF THE APES\n\nDirected by Wes Ball. Written by Josh Friedman. Starring Owen Teague, Travis Jeffery, Lydia Peckham, Kevin Durand, Freya Allan, William H. Macy, Peter Macon. At AMC Boston Common, Landmark Kendall Square, Alamo Drafthouse Seaport, AMC Causeway, suburbs. 146 min.
