        "text": "10. ‘Planet of the Apes’ (2001)\n\nTim Burton is not a director known for his stellar quality control, especially in the 2000s, so it’s really saying something that his 2001 ‘Planet of the Apes’ reboot is quite possibly the worst project of his entire career. A closer remake of the original film than the current franchise, Burton’s film stars a miscast Mark Wahlberg in the original Charlton Heston role of an astronaut in a chimp-run world. But the prosthetics are somehow significantly worse than the original, the worldbuilding is far shakier, and the whole thing is rather dour and bland, thanks in part to Wahlberg’s dull performance that makes it astonishingly easy to root for Tim Roth’s military dictator chimpanzee. At least this film offers an absolutely ridiculous twist ending that wildly departs from the original, but that’s also the only thing actually memorable about it. —WC\n\n9. ‘Beneath the Planet of the Apes’ (1970)\n\nMuch like how some TV shows need a few seasons to find its groove, this sequel to the breakout original ‘Planet of the Apes’ takes some pretty intriguing swings, but for the most part plays as a schlocky and safe repeat of the first film. Following a new time-traveling astronaut named Brent — who somehow crash-landed in the exact same future moment as Taylor from the previous film — ‘Beneath’ starts as a continuation, turns into a retread, but eventually becomes a trippy dive into the horrendous outcomes of nuclear holocaust. This last part — which takes place in a chasm of the Earth that turns out to be the bowels of a bombed-out New York City — is pretty engaging and asks some interesting questions in regard to the atrocities we’re willing to commit in the pursuit of peace, but ultimately, when taken altogether, this sequel feels like a patchwork of studio notes and rushed decisions more than an actual worthy contribution to the overall series. —HR\n\n8. ‘Conquest of the Planet of the Apes’ (1972)\n\n‘Conquest of the Planet of the Apes’ was partially butchered during its original theatrical release; the violent and tragic original ending got amended after a preview screening, with director J. Lee Thompson fighting mightily against his already limited budget to deliver a more peaceful moral. And it’s a shame, because that original stark ending better fits the somber and stripped-down story. Marking the first appearance of Roddy McDowall’s Caesar, the film sees him lead an ape rebellion against mankind, which has made his race into slave labor. There’s potent political allegory in this story reflective of the ’70s and helps ‘Conquest’ remain a fascinating watch, but its limited budget holds it back, and the existence of ‘Rise’ (a significantly superior retelling of this story) doesn’t do it any favors. —WC\n\n7. ‘Battle for the Planet of the Apes’ (1973)\n\nThis movie starts with John Huston as an ape doing a ‘previously-on’ and ends with a tear rolling down the eye of a statue of another ape who brought about coexistence between primates and humans. You’d think from that alone it would be an absolute banger. And you’d be right. Despite a decent box office for its budget, ‘Battle’ was viewed pretty harshly upon its release and remains for many the worst of the entire franchise, but upon review, this capper to the original series doesn’t get the credit it deserves. Known for its downbeat conclusions and bleak analysis of human (and ape) behavior, ‘Battle’ chooses to end the narrative with a hopeful flourish rather than a bomb, once again spinning the constantly pivoting series on its head. The main focus of ‘Battle’ is the child of Cornelius and Zira from ‘Escape’ and leader of the ape rebellion in ‘Conquest,’ the original version’s Caesar. Since ‘Conquest,’ the apes have become the dominant species with some humans ‘voluntarily’ assisting their evolution as a way of keeping their own lives. Caesar leads these apes under certain laws, all of which are tested when he discovers a race of mutant humans — a product of radiation from the nuclear fallout they live amongst — and invades their lair to seek information on his parents. In his absence, a vacancy of power allows a gorilla named Aldo to seize control, killing Caesar’s son in the process. Considering this was the fifth installment in six years, it’s easy to understand how people were kind of tired of the ape shtick, but in retrospect, the film sets up so much for the reboot to be inspired by and pays off a lot of really compelling themes of its own in a uniquely positive way for the series. –HR\n\n6. ‘Rise of the Planet of the Apes’ (2011)\n\nA reboot of ‘Planet of the Apes’ that shows how humanity fell to newly intelligent monkeys should not have worked. It could have easily been lazy, obvious, and unnecessary. So the fact that ‘Rise’ not only worked but managed to kick start a new series of ‘Planet of the Apes’ films that rival the original series in quality, is a huge testament to the work Rupert Wyatt did to give this story emotional weight. Taking some inspiration from ‘Conquest,’ ‘Rise’ introduces Andy Serkis’ exquisite take on Caesar, here a chimpanzee genetically enhanced by an experimental Alzheimer’s Cure, as he becomes torn between his love for his adoptive father Will (James Franco) and his fellow lab simians. It’s an emotionally resonant connection that transcends some weaker writing for other human characters, and the entire thing is lifted by both the incredible motion cap work that went into creating the apes and Serkis’ emotional first go-around as Caesar. —WC\n\n5. ‘Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ (2024)\n\nThis latest installment of the reboot franchise benefits from the time in-between its release and the initial trilogy’s prominence during the 2010s, both in terms of what the audience expects visually and narratively and the kind of theatrical experience they’re seeking overall. It’s a long film — the longest of the entire franchise — and plays as a classic hero’s journey, with the new central figure of a young ape named Noa (Owen Teague) serving as our entry point into the narrative. Noa comes from a small tribal clan of apes who co-exist and bond with eagles as a way of survival. They live generations away from Caesar’s time and don’t even know of his existence. However, another pack of apes from the coast know him well and honor him — or at least so they think — by acting out in collective brutality. When that brutality enters Noa’s world, it forces him to leave home and encounter facts he never knew and a history of ape conflict that goes beyond humans and remains to this day. It also forces him into a leadership role he may not have been entirely ready for, but by the end, knows he must take on like Caesar did. The film carries a slightly lighter tone than its predecessors, with an extremely bright visual scheme as well that portends a potentially more hopeful outcome for the characters of this series, but sets up more than it pays off. —HR\n\n4. ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’ (2017)\n\nThe tragic ending for Caesar’s character, ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’ is bleak even by the series’ standards, pitting Serkis’ hero against a brutal and frightening Woody Harrelson as the leader of a Human Ape-work camp. It’s a bleak story that features stunning action and direction from Reeves, along with never-better mo-cap work, terrific cinematography from Michael Seresin, and a genuinely epic score from Michael Giacchino. But what makes the finale for the trilogy so excellent is Serkis’ performance, which manages to imbue impossible amounts of soul and emotion into a CGI chimp. By the end, Caesar stands as one of the great blockbuster characters in recent memory, and it’s Serkis’ beautiful work that lands him in that pantheon. —WC\n\n3. ‘Escape From the Planet of the Apes’ (1971)\n\nConsider this. The same year Roe v. Wade was first filed in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas, then later put before the Supreme Court, a low-budget sequel of a primarily ape-based sci-fi franchise was being produced and one of the main plot lines of the film involved a pregnant, human-like ape from the future being forced by the present-day’s government to have her baby killed in the womb. The film was released less than seven months before the case was first argued in front of the Supreme Court. This is the beauty of sci-fi storytelling and “Escape” understands how to harness that. Without driving too close to the real conflicts of ‘70s America, ‘Escape’ is able to draw an allegory that is just as human and just as horrifying as what was being faced at the time. Beloved characters Cornelius and Zira — two pacifist apes with scientific and personal interests in trying to understand humans — are able to escape their future and return to the past, where the American government meets them initially with disgusted curiosity, but eventually are convinced to make animals out of them once more. A pregnant Zira is threatened with feticide, forcing her and Cornelius to go on the run and leading to a tragic ending very in line with the bleakness of the time, while also setting up a future for all-but-guaranteed continuations. —HR\n\n2. ‘Planet of the Apes’ (1968)\n\nThere are few images in cinema as iconic as Heston dropping to his knees in front of the ruined, cracked bust of the Statue of Liberty. That’s the moment from ‘Planet of the Apes’ that’s been parodied by everyone from The Simpsons to ‘Spaceballs,’ but the rest of the movie is excellent too; a smart, well-written look at a world both alien and familiar to our modern lives, from the viewpoint of a fantastic Heston as the outsider whose presence disrupts Ape society. The prosthetics and makeup were groundbreaking at the time and still feel excellent to this day, doing a lot to make this world feel lived-in and real. The film is content to downplay action in favor of a slow boil plot, anchored by Heston and Maurice Evans as the phenomenal antagonist Dr. Zaius. ‘Planet of the Apes’ might have a goofy premise on paper, but the Franklin J. Schaffner original proved it could be made into serious fiction. —WC\n\n1. ‘Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ (2014)\n\nThis first sequel within the reboot franchise serves as both Matt Reeves’ entrance into the series, as well as a fascinating mid-point to the overall collection of films. It’s a time when both the humans and apes are on even-footing, with both parties forming protective colonies following the spread of the simian flu and defending their claims by any means necessary. Leader of the apes and the first one to gain the function of speech, Caesar has made a home for himself, his family, and his clan within Muir Woods, but the surviving humans are not that far away and some apes — including Caesar’s right-hand Koba (Toby Kebbell) — would prefer to wipe them out rather than deal in diplomacy. Caesar, however, thinks apes can maintain a civil relationship with humans and even offers to assist a small band of them in regaining their power supply. The reason ‘Dawn’ represents the best of the entire film series is because of how it perfectly balances thought-provoking themes with heart-pounding, expertly executed action. It truly is everything we want out of our ‘Apes’ movies, down to the dour ending that sees Caesar fight to maintain his power at the cost of his desire for peace with humans. It’s about the burden of leadership, especially when you actually believe in something. —HR"
