        "text": "#10: “Battle for the Planet of the Apes” (1973)\n\nThis fifth entry also serves as a finale to the original “Apes” series. While the title suggests an epic culmination, “Battle for the Planet of the Apes” falls short. The apes have descended from John Chambers’ Oscar-winning makeup effects to Halloween-quality masks with lip movements that rarely sync up with the dialogue. We see little of the planet with most of the plot confined to the apes’ uninspired village. The titular battle is especially underwhelming as vehicles gradually move toward a fleet of repetitive gunfire. It all builds to a main villain dying by plunging from a tree… that wasn’t even far off the ground. The story admirably tries to bring things full circle, but we understand why Hollywood abandoned this franchise for 28 years.\n\n#9: “Planet of the Apes” (2001)\n\nBelieve it or not, the hype was through the roof leading to this reimagining’s release. With Tim Burton on a hot streak, we had every reason to assume he’d breathe new life into the IP. The project also seemed tailormade for Rick Baker, who devised arguably the most expressive makeup effects the franchise had ever seen. While some actors behind the ape makeup are having fun, the humans range from bland to stupidly unlikable. The dull plot is riddled with awkward moments and confused commentary. Although the twist ending is technically closer to the original book, it proved so baffling and random that not even Burton could explain it. He figured somebody else would in the sequel that never got made (and for good reason).\n\n#8: “Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970)\n\nThis direct follow-up to the original classic sadly took a step backward. Charlton Heston clearly wanted to star in this sequel about as much as he enjoyed being in “Bowling for Columbine.” Heston’s Taylor is thus absent for most of the picture with James Franciscus’s Brent serving as an almost identical stand-in. The first half needlessly retreads the first film until we venture into New York’s underground ruins. While the art direction is inspired, the plot goes off the rails with the arrival of a secret society that worships a bomb and wears human skin. Did David Lynch hijack this production? By the climax, you wish someone would just blow it all up, which is precisely what Heston does. No more sequels for him!\n\n#7: “Conquest of the Planet of the Apes” (1972)\n\nWe’re getting into pretty good territory now. After playing Cornelius in two of the three previous films, Roddy McDowall returns as his son Caesar. Growing up hiding his intelligence, Caesar is compelled to accept his destiny as leader of the apes, who have been enslaved by humans. While Caesar experiences the worst humanity has to offer, he also recognizes the good, attempting to balance mercy and strength while bringing salvation. Fans of the modern “Apes” films will recognize numerous themes and characters that stemmed from this penultimate chapter in the original continuity. Although many of these ideas would be better executed in subsequent films, “Conquest” provided a solid blueprint with thoughtful real-world parallels and one of McDowall’s most commanding performances throughout the series.\n\n#6: “Escape from the Planet of the Apes” (1971)\n\nThe best of the original sequels, this third film sees Cornelius and Zira travel back to when humans were dominant. It sounds silly, and “Escape” does have some of the franchise’s most legitimately funny moments as Cornelius and Zira turn into media stars. The apes go from being celebrated to feared, though, as Zira becomes pregnant. With humanity’s future seemingly in jeopardy, the government seeks to ensure Zira’s baby isn’t born. As some modern critics have pointed out, the film debuted not long before Roe v. Wade went to the Supreme Court, making it relevant even more than 50 years later. At its heart are two deeply empathetic performances from Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter as a couple denied the chance to live peacefully.\n\n#5: “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” (2011)\n\nA decade after the Burton misfire, “Rise” rebooted the franchise again with a much better outcome. In lieu of prosthetic makeup, the apes are portrayed through motion capture technology. This could’ve backfired, but when the great Andy Serkis and the visual effects wizards at Weta Digital are involved, the results are nothing short of groundbreaking. With minimal dialogue, Serkis gives one of his most meditative and physically demanding performances as Caesar. The human characters might not be as interesting as Caesar or his fellow apes. In a post-COVID world, though, watching humanity’s downfall feels eerily more practical than we’d like to admit. It’s capped off with an exhilarating climax, doing for San Francisco what the original did for New York.\n\n#4: “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” (2024)\n\nWith the previous film concluding Caesar’s story on such a poignant note, we weren’t sure if the “Apes” franchise needed to continue under Disney’s reign. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the latest entry, which takes place generations after Caesar. His presence is still felt as some use Caesar’s words to inspire hope while others use them to impose force. While the apes are more evolved than ever, humans may also be staging a comeback, which could either lead to alliances or war. Director Wes Ball delivers a grand and immersive spectacle of worldbuilding with strong character dynamics at the forefront. It succeeds as both an extension of Caesar’s legacy and the start of a new legacy that’ll hopefully keep growing in future sequels.\n\n#3: “War for the Planet of the Apes” (2017)\n\nWhen the reboot series commenced, there was more emphasis on the humans with Caesar almost being a supporting player. By the time we got to “War,” this was undoubtedly Caesar’s world and humans were just living in it. Woody Harrelson’s Colonel may attempt to reclaim the planet, although he’s clinging to a hierarchy that no longer exists as the apes are now more evolved than humans. The harsh winter backdrop reflects the changing world, which will never be the same once spring comes. With the apes taking center stage, Matt Reeves’ film is one of the most engaging examples of visual storytelling we’ve ever witnessed. Living up to its title, this is a truly effective war story with brutal action, quiet intensity, and heartbreaking deaths.\n\n#2: “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” (2014)\n\nIn the second chapter of Caesar’s arc, Matt Reeves didn’t just remind us how thought-provoking “Planet of the Apes” could be. He took it to new territory with echoes of a Shakespearean tragedy. In just three years, motion capture has taken enormous leaps forward, but that’s far from the only improvement. With humanity struggling to survive and apes ascending, Caesar attempts to maintain peace. That peace is challenged by an ape named Koba, possibly this franchise’s most cunning and destructive - yet also relatable - villain. The layered rivalry between Caesar and Koba is the driving force in a story that doesn’t just pit apes against humans, but also apes against apes. Above all else, it’s about dominance vs. compassion with the latter not always proving practical.\n\n#1: “Planet of the Apes” (1968)\n\nBeing based on a book originally titled “Monkey Planet,” few could’ve expected how seriously the original film would take itself. Looking at the talent involved, though, it’s evident why this amounted to a sci-fi classic. In addition to being helmed by “Patton” director Franklin J. Schaffner, actors like Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, and Kim Hunter brought genuine gravitas to every line. The script was penned by Michael Wilson, who co-wrote “Lawrence of Arabia,” and Rod Serling, who created “The Twilight Zone.” The result is a perfect blend of their styles, encompassing Wilson’s sweeping scope and Serling’s signature twists. In addition to being unexpected, the iconic ending prompts the audience to reevaluate the movie they just watched, exposing humans - not apes - as their own worst enemy.\n\nWhat’s your definitive ranking of the “Apes” franchise?
