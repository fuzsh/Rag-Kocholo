        "text": "1968's classic and influential sci-fi film, Planet of the Apes (based on French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel), spawned a franchise that dominated the first half of the '70s with four more movie sequels, tie-in books, a live-action TV series, and and even an animated. This global conflict pitting humans against intelligent humanoid apes thrilled the imagination while also touching on social issues like racism, animal cruelty, and the Cold War. It makes for some of the best sci-fi movies of all time.\n\nIt would take three decades before a reboot landed in our laps, but Tim Burton's 2001 reworking of the original movie wasn't enough to revitalize the dormant franchise. It wouldn't be until 2011's reboot prequel, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, that 20th Century Fox would find success once again, this time with a full new trilogy.\n\nNow is it possible to take a full chronological journey? Not exactly, but we can do our best. This unsettling saga, one where humans find themselves supplanted by a fast-evolving new species and struggling with subservience and subjugation, is worth the watch, so let's look at how to catch the Planet of the Apes films in order. And when you're done here, be sure to also check out our detailed explanation of the Planet of the Apes timeline!\n\nJump to:\n\nHow to watch in chronological order\n\nHow to the original movies in order\n\nHow to watch by release order\n\nHow to Watch the Planet of the Apes Movies in (Chronological) Order\n\nHow Many Planet of the Apes Movies Are There?\n\nThere are a total of ten movies set within the Planet of the Apes universe, starting with the 1968 original and its four sequels. The 2001 reboot makes six and then the four prequels, which showcase how the world fell to the apes, round out the ten.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes Movies in Chronological Order\n\nHere's the caveat: The three prequels from the last decade or so are not connected to the original series of films. They represent a fully rebooted timeline, presumedly with a different future than the one Charlton Heston's astronaut discovers in the 1968 film. But there's no harm in still watching them first...\n\n1. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)\n\nMotion capture technology and digital characters were on the extreme rise in the Aughts, allowing the Apes saga to move beyond practical makeup and into a new special effects arena that would allow for more emotion in performance from the lead Apes. Gollum himself, Andy Serkis, lent his extraodinary abilities to Caesar, a chimpanzee whose intelligence is increased through science, and becomes the heart of a prequel story all about the beginnings of the end for humankind. Set in the \"present day,\" Rise of the Planet of the Apes also stars James Franco, John Lithgow, Brian Cox, and Freida Pinto, planting the seeds for what will become a world-wide war.\n\nRead our review of Rise of the Planet of the Apes here.\n\n2. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nThe prequels bring in The Batman's Matt Reeves as director for the next two movies, starting with the superb Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which brings back Andy Serkis' Caesar, years after the Simian Flu has decimated Earth' human population while the intelligence Apes have established a colony near San Francisco. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, and Toby Kebbell co-star in this tale of the initial truce talks and attempts at peace that go so so badly because of treachery on both sides.\n\nRead our review of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes here.\n\n3. War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nPast the point of no return, the conflict between apes and humans has escalated into full war in Matt Reeves' War for the Planet of the Apes as Andy Serkis' Caesar sets out to avenge those he has lost. Woody Harrelson and Steve Zahn join the franchise for this acclaimed ending to the Apes' Caesar Trilogy, originally intended to drop us off on the doorstep of Planet of the Apes (in its own way since it's these are reboot prequels) except that it made a good amount of money and, thus, per rules of Hollywood, needed a sequel.\n\nRead our review of War for the Planet of the Apes here.\n\n4. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is arriving in theaters on May 8, 2024. Although the new movie follows the events of the previous film, it actually takes place a full 300 years after War for the Planet of the Apes. At this point in the story, the apes have fully taken over and human civilization and their technology are now a distant past.\n\nRead our review of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\n\n5. Planet of the Apes (1968)\n\nPlanet of the Apes, starring Charlton Heston as an adrift astronaut, George Taylor, who emerges from deep cryo-sleep to find marooned on planet populated by ape-like beings with human intelligence, is iconic sci-fi -- all while containing one of the best twist endings in cinema history. A twist brought to us courtesy of the king of \"gotcha!\" endings, Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling, who adapted the original book and added his own special brand of shock and awe.\n\n6. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nCharlton Heston only returned briefly for this 1970 follow-up, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, which switched up the leads and focused on a different astronaut, Brent (James Franciscus), who arrives on a mission to find the missing Taylor. Discovering a hidden population of telepathic humans who worship an ancient nuclear weapon, Brent must survive this new harsh realm while also preventing everything from being destroyed by the doomsday bomb. A decent, albeit insane, sequel.\n\n7. Escape From the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nIn a biting bit of time-travel upheaval, a trio of Apes escape the events of the previous film -- Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), Zira (Kim Hunter), and Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) -- and arrive in 1973 Earth where they face the worst of humanity's persecution. Escape From the Planet of the Apes is more touching and character-driven than the films before it, blending light with dark...until it goes super dark.\n\n8. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nRoddy McDowall returns to the franchise for Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, though now playing Caesar (yes, kinda/sorta Caesar the reboot prequels focused on), the intelligent ape son of Cornelius and Zira, out to lead a rebellion against humanity in the wake of a pandemic that's turned society into fascist slave-owners. You can debate as to whether we’re in an alternate timeline here or the same one George Taylor found himself in when he crashed landed in the future, in Planet of the Apes. Regardless, Conquest is still filled with mass death as a full Ape revolt occurs and humanity finds itself on the brink of downfall.\n\n9. Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nIn the final sequel to the original film, McDowall's Caesar once again tries to keep the peace amongst the humans and apes, after humans have been defeated, but uprisings spring up and the message is hammered home that power eventually corrupts all those in charge, whether they're human or not. Billed as The Final Chapter, Battle for the Planet of the Apes wasn't received well by critics or audiences, though it capped off the sci-fi story that began five years previous.\n\nN/A. Planet of the Apes (2001)\n\nTim Burton's Planet of the Apes reboot can honestly be watched whenever, since it doesn't officially belong on any timeline, but we advise at least checking out the 1968 original before indulging in the remake. Mark Wahlberg stars as the wayward astronaut here, with Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Paul Giamatti in Ape roles. The story is similar to the O.G. film but the characters are new, and there's even a new stab at the classic twist ending.\n\nHow to Watch the Original Planet of the Apes Movies in Order\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nEscape From the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nHow to Watch the Planet of the Apes Movies by Release Date\n\nIf you're looking to watch all the movies in theatrical release order, the correct list is below:"
