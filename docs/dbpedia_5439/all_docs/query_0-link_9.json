Lee Thompson with a screenplay by Paul Dehn. It is the fourth film in the Planet of the Apes series and follows 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes. The film was produced by Twentieth Century-Fox Productions and APJAC Productions and released theatrically in the United States on June 30th, 1972. The film stars Roddy McDowall playing the role of revolutionary chimpanzee leader Caesar - the son of McDowall's character Cornelius from the previous films. Co-starring with Roddy McDowall is Ricardo Montalban, reprising the role of circus owner Armando from Escape from the Planet of the Apes. Other stars Don Murray as the antagonist Governor Breck, Hari Rhodes as MacDonald and POTA mainstay Natalie Trundy as the chimpanzee Lisa.\n\nPlot[]\n\nCast[]\n\nActor Role Roddy McDowall Caesar Don Murray Governor Breck Natalie Trundy Lisa Hari Rhodes MacDonald Severn Darden Kolp Lou Wagner Busboy ape John Randolph Commission Chairman Asa Maynor Mrs. Riley H.M.

The exact location of the film is unknown. The opening scenes of the movie identify the setting only as North America. Planet of the Apes Magazine #11, published by Marvel Comics sets the film in San Francisco, California. Other sources indicate that the film actually takes place in Los Angeles.\n\nScreenwriter Paul Dehn passed away four years after the release of this film.\n\nFun Facts[]\n\nThe tagline to this film is \"Go human, not ape!\".\n\nDiscrepancies[]\n\nThere are some discrepancies concerning the character of Aldo as presented in this movie in relation to a reference made to him in Escape from the Planet of the Apes as well as his representation in Battle for the Planet of the Apes. In Escape, Cornelius reveals some information concerning the historical records of Aldo, \"On an historic day, which is commemorated by my species and fully documented in the Sacred Scrolls, there came Aldo. He did not grunt. He articulated. He spoke a word which had been spoken to him time without number by humans. He said, 'No'. Although the Aldo seen in Conquest is the first ape to actively rebel against his captors, he does not speak. Also, he is presented as a chimpanzee. The character seen in Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a gorilla. There are two possible explanations for this; the most logical being, that these are two different apes who share the same name; the other is that the insertion of Zira and Cornelius into the past changed the future timeline, altering the historical record to show that Caesar was the first talking ape to rebel against the human slavers, not Aldo.\n\nRecommendations[]\n\nPlanet of the Apes films\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nTim Burton's Planet of the Apes\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes\n\nSee also[]\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nPlanet of the Apes films\n\nPlanet of the Apes index\n\nPlanet of the Apes pages\n\nPlanet of the Apes characters\n\nPlanet of the Apes miscellaneous\n\n[]\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes at Wikipedia\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes at the POTA Wiki\n\nReferences[]\n\nKeywords[]"
