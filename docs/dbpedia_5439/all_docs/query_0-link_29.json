        "text": "Fox Home Entertainment and blackfilm.com are proud to present\n\nView the Prizes\n\nHow to Enter\n\nCENTURY CITY, Calif. – King Kong conquered New York, but The Apes control the Planet! Charlton Heston (Soylent Green, The Ten Commandments) stars as the alpha-male omega man ushered in the age of the ape when he crash lands on a mysterious planet amongst an entirely simian society… only to discover that the “madhouse” was closer to home than he could have dreamed. On March 28, 2006, Fox Home Entertainment unleashes all-new DVD Singles of the Original Planet of the Apes Series Mastered in Anamorphic Widescreen and featuring THX Certified 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Planet Of The Apes stunned audiences with its now-iconic conclusion and shockingly dystopian view of humanity’s fate, as well as with one of the most famous performances from larger-than-life Oscar-winner® Heston (Ben-Hur, 1960). From an age of film when science-fiction served as allegory in addition to providing thrilling spectacle and edge-of-your-seat adventure, the Planet Of The Apes began a franchise that set the gold standard of Sci-Fi films\n\nThe subsequent sequels in the Apes franchise follow the downfall of the planet and its succeeding resurrection by time-traveling chimpanzees. Each of the Planet Of The Apes films offers a unique examination of social, political and cultural mores, from race issues to anti-nuclear messaging. And each features astounding special effects and action, as well as performances from silver screen luminaries such as Roddy McDowall (Fright Night), Ricardo Montalban (Star Trek II), Sal Mineo (Rebel Without A Cause) and John Huston (Chinatown).\n\nIn addition to the original film series – Planet of the Apes, Beneath The Planet Of The Apes, Escape From Planet Of The Apes, Conquest Of Planet Of The Apes and Battle For Planet Of The Apes – the collection is also available in an all-new Planet of the Apes: Legacy Edition Box set which includes a 6th bonus disc loaded with extras - Documentary “Behind the Planet of the Apes,” Original Theatrical Trailers of all 5 movies, TV Spots and much more.\n\n* * * *\n\nAnd to Celebrate the Rule of the Great Apes, Fox is Unleashing the Planet Of The Apes: The Ultimate DVD Collection, a 14-disc set in a Limited Edition collectable ape-head packaging based on the designs that earned make-up artist John Chambers an honorary Oscar®. The Ape –head is modeled after Roddy McDowall’s character Caesar, the son of the late simians Cornelius and Zira who leads the apes to revolution in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. The Ultimate Collection includes all five Original movies (1968-1973), the complete series of the Planet of the Apes (1974) TV Show and the Never-Before-Released Saturday Morning Cartoon TV series: Return to the planet of the Apes (1975) as well as the 2001 re-imagining of the Planet Of The Apes mythology. The Planet Of The Apes franchise stars such silver-screen luminaries as Ricardo Montalban (Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan), Sal Mineo (Rebel Without A Cause), John Huston (Chinatown), Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights), Michael Clarke Duncan (Daredevil) and Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs).
