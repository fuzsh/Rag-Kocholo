Discrepancies[]

There are some discrepancies concerning the character of Aldo as presented in this movie in relation to a reference made to him in Escape from the Planet of the Apes as well as his representation in Battle for the Planet of the Apes. In Escape, Cornelius reveals some information concerning the historical records of Aldo, "On an historic day, which is commemorated by my species and fully documented in the Sacred Scrolls, there came Aldo. He did not grunt. He articulated. He spoke a word which had been spoken to him time without number by humans. He said, 'No'. Although the Aldo seen in Conquest is the first ape to actively rebel against his captors, he does not speak. Also, he is presented as a chimpanzee. The character seen in Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a gorilla. There are two possible explanations for this; the most logical being, that these are two different apes who share the same name; the other is that the insertion of Zira and Cornelius into the past changed the future timeline, altering the historical record to show that Caesar was the first talking ape to rebel against the human slavers, not Aldo.
