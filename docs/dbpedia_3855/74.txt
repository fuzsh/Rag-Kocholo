When

Stephen is a conductor of national reputation who regularly enriches Canterbury with his presence.

He had another success for Grange Park Opera (Hampshire) with Richard Strauss's last, 1942 opera, Capriccio: "Barlow's astute grip on Strauss's endless climactic outpourings ensured revelation rather than excess, and members of the English Chamber Orchestra played the opening, exquisite Sextet with poise; (it was) a superb musical performance."

With impressive versatility, Stephen composed a work in memory of Allan Wicks which was performed by the Vasari Singers in the Cathedral on 24 July. And the Concert in the Eastern Crypt on 24 September of Stephen (piano) and Patrick Williams (WL 1968-72, flute) is now an established appetiser to the Canterbury Festival.
