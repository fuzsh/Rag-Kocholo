        "text": "How can arts leaders move beyond incremental change to truly transformative change? By studying the history of the indoor toilet, says David Maggs. \"[In] the early 19th century [the promoters of indoor plumbing systems] encountered a surprising problem. People were reluctant to use them. The mere thought of going to the bathroom indoors made people extremely uncomfortable. This, of course, is unimaginable to us now, as the thought of going to the bathroom outdoors makes us extremely uncomfortable...The thought of bringing that smelly mess inside would have seemed like a ridiculous suggestion ‚Äî which is why the topic is so relevant to our broader curiosity around transformative change. They could not imagine doing it, and we cannot imagine not doing it. That is transformative change. Before it happens, we cannot conceive of it; after it happens, we can‚Äôt conceive of its absence. That is change at the level of being.\" David Maggs, Toilets and Transformation #artsandculture #audiencedevelopment #artsmarketing #opera #orchestra #ballet #theater #orchestralmusic #operasingersofinstagram #conductors #conductorsofinstagram #orchestralmusicians #artsleadership #artsadmin #artsadministration\n\nLeonard Cohen said the discipline of rhyming allows one to go through one‚Äôs inventory of words. Meaning, the right rhyme is secondary to the right word. So in this case, a rhyming dictionary, which I use, is a kind of Thesaurus. This is one example where limitations (the discipline of rhyming) can lead us to more creative choices, using words we might not have considered otherwise. Coal Mine Theatre has built a solid reputation with this approach of using limitations to their advantage. The current production of Dion: A Rock Opera could not have been created anywhere else. The limitations make it what it is: an alternative to the conventional rock opera. In another theatrical space, perhaps one that is more conventional, it would be a very different show. All this to say, how pleased I am to have witnessed this incarnation. Whatever might come next, in whatever venue, will benefit from the unconventional approach that took the show to this point. I hope that is something we can build on.\n\nFriday Arts ‚Ä¶ Something other than today‚Äôs headlines about former US Prez‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Point of Difference. What is it that separates Springboard Opera from a hundred other small arts organisations? And why would anyone pay attention to this little band of Arts Adventurers from Brisbane? What is The Springboard Thing? (Apart from the fact that Brisbane is WHERE IT IS AT in the Oz Arts Scene‚Ä¶) The answer is this‚Ä¶ We are doing The Arts differently. Having no baggage to carry, we start with a clean slate. And picking up the best of everything that we see. If we can use it to get us to our goals, it is fair game. We do not say that the artists are at the centre of everything, or that the business model is at the centre of everything, or that funders are our key focus. For us everything is connected and so‚Ä¶ Everything is at the centre of Everything. Very Quantum Multiverse and Dr Who ‚Äì we‚Äôll accept that ‚Äì but it does open up a universe of possibilities for Springboard. To Transform the Opera Idea, probably in ways that no-one has imagined yet. And that is the Springboard Point of Difference. The dusty old paradigm that is Opera needs to be busted wide open and re-built. From Back to Front and Top to Bottom. And in the process, create a sustainable and viable path for emerging Queensland Opera Artists. Who have that Springboard Thing going on‚Ä¶ This is Springboard Opera. If The Springboard Thing grabs your interest, come and see it in action! We are going public on 29 June in the heart of Brisbane with a fabulous and stylish Opera Gala. Get all the details here -->> https://lnkd.in/getQSPPu But being The Springboard Thing, it would be best to park your prior expectations outside‚Ä¶ #Future #TransformationalLeadership #LeadershipDevelopment #Directors #Technology #Performingarts #YourNetworkForLife\n\nWhat‚Äôs involved in being simply extraordinary speaking in public? I‚Äôll share a well-tried recipe! üé§ SIMPLICITY The more powerful the words, the simpler your delivery should be. Leonardo da Vinci told us that simplicity ‚Äúis the ultimate sophistication.‚Äù Try to embody both the concept and the practice of simplicity! If you are an expert in a certain field, you know what you are speaking about, right? Let the words go directly from your heart and share your expertise! üíØ Don‚Äôt even try to amaze your public, to be perfect. Nobody is. Your performance in public speaking shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúperformance.‚Äù Don't try to be a perfect speaker or presenter. Just connect with your audience and really believe in what you're saying. Then you'll be amazing. üé≠ Cherry on top, magic ingredient: CATHARSIS! Do you remember this term from literature/philosophy classes? It rings a bell, doesn‚Äôt it? Often, tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Oedipus the King are high-stakes and emotionally powerful enough to leave the audience feeling purged of those emotions by the end of the play. Catharsis basically means emotional release. It refers to the experience that a reader/listener has when an event within a narrative causes him to feel a fulfillment of the emotions that he has developed over the course of the narrative. That‚Äôs what you feel while listening to the opera/concert at philharmonic (Tomorrow, btw, there is a nice concert ‚ÄúL‚Äôorchestre dans tous ses √©tats: variations, ouvertures, Sinfonietta‚Äù). As a listener of a symphony, you can feel that emotional roller coaster, culminating in a joyful catharsis. You can include catharsis in your speech in the middle or by the end of your speech. How do you like this recipe? Will you try to cook sth out of it? Let me know! #publicspeaking #publicspeakingtips #events #eventindustry #speakingskills #theatre #luxembourg #skilldevelopment\n\nChristmas Arts ... again and still. Ring Cycle done! I am going to update my SM tag now to read ‚ÄúRing Cycle graduate!‚Äù I was a bit worried about the length of it, and people kept saying words like ‚Äúhuge commitment‚Äù. But it wasn‚Äôt. Primarily because it is presented in a very contemporary style with lots of tech and awesome sound and is engaging in a sci-fi kind of way without compromising the work. And ‚Ä¶ ya gotta come to BrisVegas to see it! The city that is doing amazing stuff in the Arts. Re-inventing traditional arts forms in new and exciting ways ‚Ä¶ like this production of The Ring Cycle. It is not just the big guys on this path though. Looking behind the glam of what Opera Australia is doing here there is a new noise going on. (and yes, I will admit ‚Äì OA does stuff in other places as well ‚Ä¶ but just not in the BrisVegas way), Part of the noise in Brisbane is Springboard Opera. And our noise is‚Ä¶ Opera for All. Innovate Deliberately. Use our Voices for Good. That is what we do. A small band of adventurers in an exciting conversation. So if you want to join in, jump over to https://lnkd.in/gS53GYEN, and see what we are up to. We want as many people as possible to come on our journey of re-invention with us! #Future #TransformationalLeadership #LeadershipDevelopment #Directors #Technology #Performingarts #YourNetworkForLife\n\nFriday Arts! It is so cool living in Brisbane ‚Ä¶ the erupting epicentre of the arts in this country! There is so much going on in this town (and this state) in the arts. Our own #QueenslandTheatre is amazing, as are the other majors in town ‚Ä¶ #Circa, #QueenslandBallet, #OperaQueensland, and #QSO. The Festivals are pretty fabulous also, and the biggest Arts Festival of all - the Cultural Olympiad - is on its way also. But if you look a little deeper, there are also rumblings outside the play space of the majors. The new kid on the block is Springboard Opera, and I am the chair of the board. With my fellow other directors Leslie Martin, Luisa Tarnawski, Gheorja Haidley and Scott Mullane, I am putting together a purpose-built Opera Company here in BrisVegas. Our words are: Supporting Emerging Artists Transforming the Opera Idea We‚Äôve had one public outing, and the INAUGURAL Springboard Opera auditions are happening soon ‚Äì check out our website if you happen to be an emerging Opera Artist. Or even if you aren‚Äôt. Being purpose-built and brand new, our point-of-difference is that we have no history. So the answer ‚Äúthis is the way that it is done‚Äù is really of no interest to us. We are going to push the envelope, finding new audiences, supporting young Queensland, and deliver opera in ways that you have not seen before. But what is also different is the stuff that the public does not see. The corporate culture, the way that we run ourselves, the people we have. A truly innovative and C21 arts organisation is not just about the performances. It is about everything that we do and every thought that we have. And that is why you need to watch this space, or even jump on over to our website at https://lnkd.in/gS53GYEN and become a supporter! #Future #TransformationalLeadership #LeadershipDevelopment #Directors #Technology #Performingarts #YourNetworkForLife"
