        "text": "After being married to conductor Stephen Barlow for an impressive 38 years, Joanna Lumley has shared the secret to her successful relationship. The 77-year-old tied the knot with her husband back in 1986 and the pair have been a power couple since then.\n\nWhen asked what her secret was to a successful marriage, Joanna told Radio Times: \"Ade Edmondson had the answer to that - don't get divorced!\n\n\"I think, respect your partner and always treat them as the most important person in the world.\" The Absolutely Fabulous actress also gave an insight into what the pair like to do in their spare time and has grown to enjoy Stephen's interests.\n\nShe continued: \"You get fond of what your partner likes. I’ve become fonder of car racing because he likes that. \"We watch television, but we also read a lot and he’s a musician, so we listen to a lot of music. We’re not ruled by the box.\"\n\nJoanna is mum to photographer son Jamie, who was born in 1967, when she was just 21 years of age. She was a single mother after the split from his dad Michael Claydon, who was also a photographer.\n\nJamie now has two daughters, Alice and Emily, who the BBC star described as \"absolute heaven\" to spend time with in an interview with the Northern Echo in 2018.\n\nJoanna was also briefly married before to Jeremy Lloyd in 1970 but their marriage only lasted a year before they decided to part ways.\n\nAs well as her successful marriage, Joanna has also had a long and fruitful career, having enjoyed working as an actress and model.\n\nShe created a legend while portraying the iconic Patsy Stone in Absolutely Fabulous, before transforming into the coveted Bond girl."
