        "text": "KIRI TE KANAWA - âI COULD HAVE DANCED ALL NIGHTâ\n\nConductor:\n\nJohn Hopkins, Stephen Barlow\n\nThe Portrait Dame Kiri Te Kanawaâs story has all the best elements of an operatic fairytale. Coming from a part-Maori background she went on to become one of the worldâs most famous opera stars. In this exciting portrait, Kiri Te Kanawa talks about her life and her career in a series of revealing in-depth interviews. The documentary shows Kiri Te Kanawa recording Straussâs âFour Last Songsâ with Sir Georg Solti and the Wiener Philharmoniker, singing in a small English country church in the presence of the Prince of Wales as well as rehearsing and performing âArabellaâ and âCapriccio.â The Concert Early in 1990, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa made a triumphant return to her native New Zealand, culminating in an open-air concert in Wellington, where an audience of over seventy-five thousand people enjoyed music ranging from Puccini to Gershwin. Just over a year later, she delighted an invited audience at Christopher Wrenâs Chapel of the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London, with a programme of Handel and Mozart. Highlights of these two performances are âTu che di gel sei cintaâ from Pucciniâs âTurandotâ; âO mio babbino caroâ from âGianni Schicchiâ; Mozartâs âExsultate, jubilateâ; âI Could Have Danced All Nightâ from the musical âMy Fair Ladyâ; and many more."
