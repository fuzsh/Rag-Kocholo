        "text": "Alissa Firsova Songs of the World Op.44 (2019)\n\nI. Weltgeheimnis (Secret of the World)\n\nII. Lied der Welt (Song of the World)\n\nIII. Was ist die Welt? (What Is the World?)\n\n\"When I went to a bookshop in Vienna to discover some Viennese poets, it was Hugo von Hofmannsthal whose work sprang out to me. Hofmannsthal is famous for his libretti for Strauss operas, but I loved the philosophical and mystical aspects of his poetry, and found three poems exploring questions about the world.\n\nThe first poem suggests there are secrets in this world that we just cannot grasp and at the same time questions whether everything is purely just a dream. Love saves everything and makes us understand the depth of life through its kisses – and yet does it all fly away in a cycle of dreams?\n\nHofmannsthal wrote the second poem later in his life when he started losing hope following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ironically, it is a much lighter poem, and I tried to bring out its humour reflected through a Viennese ballroom.\n\nThe last poem is the most contemplative and has a certain sadness. A ray of hope does come in – ‘and yet, it is also a world for one’s self’ – followed by my favourite line of all: ‘Voll süss-geheimer, nievernommner Töne’, or ‘full of sweetly-secret, never-heard sounds’, each one unique without any other’s echo. Even so, Hofmannsthal concludes that no matter how much we try to decipher the meaning, we cannot ever grasp this eternal poem.\"\n\n© Alissa Firsova\n\nAlissa Firsova is a British-Russian pianist, composer and conductor.
