Stephen remembers encountering the music of Martinů at Cambridge, and being confronted by the \"pure simple joy\" of it.

Strap in. The Bohemians have arrived.\n\nWomen Composers, the \"Ol' 55\" and the wonders of 'The Trout'\n\nWhich note could the Maestro not live without? Where are all the female composers?

And today we're diving into the works of another prodigious French composer, Lili Boulanger, celebrating the flourish, colour and romance of her music.\n\nAled Jones: Teenage Choirs, Richard Branston and the Music of Everything\n\nOne of the UK's most loved vocalists and broadcasters, Aled Jones, sits down with Joanna and Stephen to discuss the moment he unearthed a trove of unreleased music from his childhood.

We also discover how Beethoven reimagined the symphony and explore Stravinsky's daring new experiments in rhythm and orchestration.\n\nBonus Brydon: Mashups, Richard Burton and 'The Swinging Doors'\n\nWe enjoyed speaking to Rob Brydon so much that we kept the tape rolling after the interview finished – much to our joy.

The best are said to have “bite” and the biggest has over 33,000 pipes. We’re talking about the organ - aka “The King of Instruments”. Both Mozart and Bach adored these kaleidoscopes of sound, so when and why did they fall out of fashion? And what debt do we owe these monumental instruments today?\n\nThe Coronation (Part 2)\n\nJoanna and Stephen return to your questions about the King’s coronation.

This week our classical duo explore compositions which move us to our very core by taking a tour through the evolution of the song itself. Diving into folk melodies, arias, Victorian parlour music and beyond.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With Opera?\n\nWhy does Opera make some people (maybe you?) run for the hills? In this episode Joanna and Stephen dig down into the big questions… Like, when did Opera become posh? How did it evolve from musical drama? And can it be reduced to 6 emotions: Admiration, Hatred, Love, Desire, Joy, Sadness and Sorrow - according to René Descart?\n\nThe Voice: Frank Sinatra, Elvis and Doris Day\n\nWho is the finest singer of all time?

Joanna and Stephen launch into the archives of great British composers like Tallis, Elgar, Byrd, Gibbons and Vaughan Williams in search of our national melodies and some home grown ‘kultur’.\n\nThe Birth of the Symphony\n\nIn this episode Joanna Lumley and her husband Stephen Barlow tackle a biggie - the Symphony. We’ve probably all heard these types of composition - usually involving full orchestras and four distinct movements - but where did they originate from? Who wrote the best ones? What are the building blocks of a symphony? And what’s harder to conduct, a symphony or an opera?\n\nPuccini Unbound\n\nSex, death, betrayal: all the good stuff. Puccini has it all. If you’re a total beginner or an opera aficionado, this episode is about the amazing operas of Italian composer Giacomo Puccini, the glorious melodies and how they capture his characters perfectly.

In this first episode we take a tour through the music which shaped their childhoods in England and South-East Asia.

For Joanna, it meant pastoral symphonies on the wind up gramophone in the jungles of Malaya.\n\nTrailer\n\nJoanna Lumley and her husband Stephen Barlow invite you into their home for a fascinating, funny journey into their shared love of music."
