        "text": "Kathleen Shanks\n\nCAPITAL ARTS PROPRIETOR AND DIRECTOR: KATHLEEN SHANKS\n\nKathleen was educated at the Wyggeston Girls' Grammar School, Leicester, where, at the age of 14, she won the Elizabeth Henderson scholarship to study music as a Junior Exhibitioner at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, London. She furthered her studies at Birmingham University & Royal Conservatoire of Music, returning to the Guildhall for postgraduate study in composition and orchestration. Her instruments are flute, violin and piano.\n\nHer early career was spent as a freelance solo flautist and orchestral player with Orchestra Da Camera and Birmingham Royal Ballet.\n\nMoving to London Kathleen was appointed Director of Music at Mount Grace School, Potters Bar, teaching to 'A' level and Oxbridge. Whilst at Mount Grace she founded 'Sing Loud For Africa', a music project which involved all the local schools. 'Sing Loud For Africa' ran for five years culminating in a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank Centre. The project won the Princess Anne Award for 'Save The Children'. HRH Princess Anne presented the award at Sandringham. Mount Grace School granted Kathleen a two year part-time paid sabbatical to study composition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.\n\nWhilst at Mount Grace Kathleen was invited by Music Adviser, Robert Pepper, to train the Mid-Herts Woodwind Ensemble. The group won numerous music festival trophies and reached the final of the Music for Youth National Festival at the Royal Festival Hall.\n\nFollowing the momentum of 'Sing Loud For Africa', and to continue her performing arts work in Hertfordshire, Kathleen founded the Capital Arts Theatre School, where over 200 children were trained in music, dance and drama. Two years in, the younger choir children won the BBC/Andrew Lloyd Webber competition to perform the children's chorus in the hit musical 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' at the London Palladium. The children recorded the 'Joseph' cast album and performed at a Royal Variety Show at the Dominium Theatre. The children also recorded 'Any Dream Will Do' with Jason Donovan. The song stayed top of the charts for 15 weeks.\n\nFrom these early days the Capital Arts Children's Choir now has an international reputation and is regarded as one of the finest children's choirs in the country, with an unequalled biography of professional performances. In 2021 the Capital Arts Children's Choir celebrates thirty years of success.\n\nLeaving education to return to freelance music, Kathleen's time is now divided between her Music Director work, composing and writing. She writes for a number of music publications and her compositions are published by the American publishing house Hal Leonard Corp. Her song 'Gloria In Londinium' was commissioned for the London 2012 Olympics and was broadcast world-wide on television. With its rousing chorus 'Invictus, Invicta', the song featured at the first Prince Harry Invictus Games in 2014.\n\nKathleen has worked as a music consultant for major record labels Decca and Sony BMG. She arranged music for the film 'Assassin's Creed' for Twentieth Century Fox, starring Jeremy Irons and Michael Fassbender.\n\nAs a Music Director, Kathleen has specialised in opera and musicals. She has trained choruses for West End Shows for a number of production companies including the Really Useful Group (Andrew Lloyd Webber), Cameron Mackintosh Ltd and Bill Kenwright Ltd. She has trained children's choruses for the main opera houses in London as well as major classical choral works for London choirs and orchestras.\n\nKathleen has conducted at all the major London concert halls for Raymond Gubbay's 'Glory of Christmas' concerts. She has performed before royalty on a number of occasions and for state leaders at Chequers and 10, Downing Street. Kathleen's New York performances are sponsored by Laurice Rahmé, founder of Bond No9 perfume.\n\nKathleen is the founder, creative director and proprietor of Capital Arts, a Covent Garden based performing arts company.\n\nCapital Arts Children's Choir\n\nAngelic Voices\n\nLondon Cantamusica\n\nOpera Capital Arts\n\nOpera Minor Education Outreach Scheme\n\nMUSIC CONSULTANCY WORK\n\nDecca Records:\n\nKirsty Bertarelli, Tom Nichols (Producer)\n\nSony BMG:\n\nAngelis & Paul Potts, Simon Cowell (Producer)\n\nTwentieth Century Fox:\n\nAssassin's Creed film, Justin Kurzel (Director)\n\nTC Davidson (Electro rock music New York)\n\nOmega\n\nBlondey (fashion designer)\n\nThe Blondey Show podcasts\n\nCHILDREN'S MUSIC DIRECTOR & RÉPÉTITEUR -
