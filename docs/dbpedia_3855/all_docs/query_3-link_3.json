        "text": "Steve Barlow Joins Lumileds as SVP of Illumination\n\nSan Jose, CA – Lumileds announced the appointment of Steve Barlow as Senior Vice President (SVP) of its Illumination Business, effective May 22. Barlow rejoins Lumileds from Cree, Inc., where he served as SVP of sales and business development, responsible for the lighting division products, channels and revenue growth.\n\nBarlow has over 25 years of sales, marketing and business development experience in the semiconductor and LED lighting industry. Barlow first joined Lumileds in 2003, helping to build its LED lighting business. He then served as the Chief Commercial Officer at Intematix Corporation, where he was responsible for all commercial functions including global sales, marketing, application engineering, customer service, business development and distribution.\n\n“We are excited to have Steve back at Lumileds. He has an outstanding track record in the lighting industry where he has demonstrated strong leadership, technology vision and customer relationship building skills,” said Mark Adams, CEO of Lumileds.\n\nLumileds is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Philips (NYSE:PHG, AEX: PHIA). Philips announced on December 12, 2016 that it signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in Lumileds to certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE: APO). The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. As required under the signed agreement, Apollo has been appropriately briefed on the appointment of Steve Barlow as SVP of Illumination.\n\n“Lumileds has created a unique position in the marketplace by offering differentiated lighting solutions. The company’s intellectual property, comprehensive product portfolio and deep customer relationships will be the cornerstone of our continued success,” added Barlow.\n\nLumileds develops, manufactures and distributes groundbreaking LEDs and automotive lighting products, with 9,300 employees spanning operations in over 32 countries."
