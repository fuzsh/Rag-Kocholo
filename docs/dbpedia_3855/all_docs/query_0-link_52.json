        "text": "The supremely talented young British pianist Benjamin Grosvenor will perform Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, fusing jazz and classical music to conjure up images of 1920s Manhattan.\n\nFurther special guests on the night will include the nation’s favourite choirmaster, Gareth Malone, directing the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, who will also perform a range of choral favourites including the Grand March from Verdi’s Aida.\n\nClassic FM Live will also celebrate 90 years of the world-famous Decca Records, with a brilliant array of the label’s artists taking to the stage. A spectacular musical lights and pyrotechnics display will bring the concert to a close in magnificent fashion, to the sound of Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture."
