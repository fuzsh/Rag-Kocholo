        "text": "Dame Joanna Lumley has only just finished enchanting the nation with her “brilliant” coverage of the Platinum Jubilee, and now she is set to appear on Celebrity Gogglebox.\n\nFor the royal celebrations, she joined Kay Burley and Alistair Bruce to discuss the historic events, including the Queen’s appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe Ab Fab star is loved by the nation, through both her hilarious comedy work and her more serious shows and activism.\n\nCompared to his wife, relatively little is known about Stephen Barlow, who Joanna married in 1986.\n\nSo, who is Stephen Barlow, as Joanna teams up with Gyles Brandreth to pull apart the latest shows on Celebrity Gogglebox?\n\nWho is Stephen Barlow?\n\nStephen Barlow is a 67-year-old conductor and musician who was an organ scholar at Cambridge University.\n\nHe was the artistic director of the Buxton Festival between 2011 and 2018 and is best known for his work in the opera.\n\nJoanna first heard about Stephen when she was 21 and he was just 13 years old.\n\n“I was staying with some friends and they happened to mention their son’s friend Stephen was coming to stay,” she said.\n\n“He didn’t arrive in the end, but his name stuck in my mind and I remember being a bit disappointed not to meet this young musician they talked about.\"\n\nThe couple properly met 10 years later at a wedding.\n\nSpeaking to this paper, Joanna said: \"I finally met him and got the strongest feeling we should be together. But even then, there was no romance.\"\n\nThen, he married someone else.\n\n“When I heard that he had got married afterwards, I felt that was all wrong.”\n\nBut it was to be a story of happy-ever-after for the future husband and wife in the end, because Stephen’s marriage broke down.\n\nOne day, he dropped a note through her door saying he was in the area and she invited him to tea. It’s fair to say it went well. They chatted for hours and not too long later, he moved in.\n\nThey married two years later. “There’s never been a day of doubt ever since that I’m with the right person,” she said.\n\n“Marriage is such an odd thing to do, really.\n\n“It’s odd to stay with one person forever and I think sometimes people forget that it’s hard to do and needs work.”\n\nIt seems that these two have got it all worked out. “We love the same things – we love silence and solitude. We have a cottage in Scotland and we adore going walking there together. It makes us feel very free.\n\n“We both live very full lives – he’s a concert pianist, composer and conductor, and I’ve got my work – so our diaries are the worst thing.\n\n“To get away is heaven. Most of all, though, we do lots of talking. I’m lucky that he is so passionate about my causes. With the Gurkha rights campaign, he’s been very supportive.\"\n\n*Celebrity Googlebox airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 4"
