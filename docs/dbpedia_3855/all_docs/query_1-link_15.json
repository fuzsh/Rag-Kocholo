        "text": "LEGENDARY Ab Fab actress Joanna Lumley is the nation's sweetheart.\n\nBut sometimes her fans wonder about her husband Stephen Barlow.\n\nWho is Stephen Barlow?\n\nStephen Barlow is a 67-year-old musician and conductor, who Joanna first heard of aged 21, while he was just 13.\n\nHe studied at Cambridge as an Organ scholar.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2018 Stephen was the Artistic Director of the Buxton Festival.\n\nHe is best known for his work in opera.\n\nWhen did Stephen Barlow and Joanna Lumley get married?\n\nStephen married Joanna in 1986 and they live primarily in London with a cottage in Scotland.\n\nThe couple officially met at a wedding when she was 31.\n\n\"I finally met him and got the strongest feeling we should be together. But even then, there was no romance,\" Joanna said to the Mirror.\n\nThen he married someone else, but divorced and left Joanna a note one day, to which she responded by inviting him in for tea - the rest was history.\n\nHe and Joanna often spend time apart due to her career involving travel.\n\nStephen too will often work on an opera that might mean being away from home.\n\nHating phones, they keep things old school and prefer to keep in touch with postcards.\n\n\"I tend to keep in touch with postcards because I’m old-fashioned,\" she explained to Woman's Weekly.\n\nThey even write to each other when they're together.\n\n\"We write notes to each other every day. Some of them are about simple things, like: 'Don’t forget to take something out of the freezer for dinner!', but some are more meaningful.\"\n\nJoanna was previously married to actor Jeremy Lloyd in 1970, but they divorced after just a few months.\n\nDo Stephen Barlow and Joanna Lumley have children?\n\nTogether they don't have children.\n\nJoanna has one son from a previous relationship, 53-year-old Jamie Lumley who is sometimes found online as James Lumley.\n\nJoanna is a grandmother to Jamie's two daughters.\n\nIt's not thought that Stephen has his own children."
