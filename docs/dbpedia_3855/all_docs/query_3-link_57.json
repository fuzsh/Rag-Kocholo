You can write the text to the top (or bottom) of a page, in a custom location (such as the middle of the page), or over the entire page. Watermarking is a powerful and flexible feature. Typical uses of watermarking include:\n\nadding a username to the bottom of every page to help identify the owner\n\nwriting job metadata in the footer, such as print time, printer or document name\n\napplying a digital signature to help track and verify documents\n\napplying a copyright notice across proprietary content to prevent plagiarism\n\nYou can apply watermark text to printers individually. Print scripting makes it possible to change watermarks dynamically (see Print scripting ). Watermarks can contain substitution variables allowing the insertion of document metadata such as date/time, username, document name, etc.\n\nA typical watermark is shown in the picture immediately below. This watermark uses the %user%, %date% and %signature% substitution variables described in the Substitution Variables section.\n\nTypical uses\n\nOwner Identification. Add the username to each page so it is easy to find the owner (e.g. uncollected print jobs).\n\nSuggested Watermark: Printed by %user%\n\nStudent Assignments. Add the username and time of printing to each page. This helps teachers match up student work and help students prove that assignments were delivered on time.\n\nSuggested Watermark: Printed by %user% at %date% on printer %printer%\n\nTracking an Organization’s Physical Documents. Add a sequentially allocated number to every document printed. This number is a document-level Bates number ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_numbering ). It is recorded in the PaperCut NG/MF database and is useful for organizing document trails.\n\nSuggested Watermark: Document No.: %bates% composed of %pages% pages\n\nIdentification and Source Tracking. Add a unique and secure digital signature to each document. Use this to verify the origin and generation details of a document. (Note: see Digital Signatures in Detail section below if security is required).\n\nSuggested Watermark: %signature%\n\nContent ownership and copyright. Add a repeated pattern stating the copyright notice or company name across the entire page to protect valuable documents where royalties apply.\n\nSuggested Watermark: Copyright ABC Corporation. All rights reserved. Document Signature: %signature%\n\nBehavioral Change. The cost of each print job is added to the bottom of each page. This gives the user immediate feedback on the cost of their printing.\n\nSuggested Watermark: The cost of this print job is: %cost%\n\nWatermarking requirements\n\nWatermarking is currently available for printers using PostScript and PCL drivers. You should ensure that the printer driver uses the PostScript or PCL language rather than GDI or other languages. You can verify this by observing the word PostScript, PCL5 or PCL6 in the Job Log as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the language lists as EMF, then turn off Advanced Printing Features as described in Troubleshooting .\n\nWatermarking limitations\n\nBecause the watermarking feature changes the spool file contents, there are some print languages which may not work, or may have other limitations on the watermarking features. Below you’ll find the limitations and any workarounds that we currently know about.\n\nSupported Print Languages\n\nThe Watermarking feature in PaperCut NG/MF generally works with standard print languages such as PostScript, PCL5, and PCL6. However, there are a few rare cases where watermarking doesn’t work as intended even when using one of these drivers. Fortunately these situations are easy to fix. See the list of limitations below:\n\nWhen the document spools in the EMF format which may occur if Advanced Print Features is enabled.\n\nWhen the document spools in the XPS format which may occur when Type 4 Print Drivers are used.\n\n“Full page” watermarking is not supported in conjunction with PCL5 content.\n\nUTF-8 languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Turkish are not supported, as languages (character sets) are limited to ASCII characters.\n\nMixed Page Sizes and Orientations\n\nPaperCut watermarking currently assumes all pages in a document will have the same page size and orientation, so funny things can happen with mixed documents, and occasionally the watermark may print at the wrong location. Luckily, depending on the driver type there is usually an easy workaround.\n\nFor PostScript, use a bottom of page watermark.\n\nFor PCL5 and PCL6, use a top of page watermark. This is needed because the internal coordinate systems - for these languages have their page origins defined at the top left of each page.\n\nEnabling watermarking\n\nTo enable watermarking:\n\nClick the Printers tab.\n\nThe Printer List page is displayed.\n\nSelect a printer.\n\nThe Printer Details page is displayed showing the Summary tab contents.\n\nIn the Advanced Configuration area, select the Apply watermark / digital signature to all pages check box.\n\nIn Text, enter the text to be printed in the watermark. You can use macro substitution variables, such as %user% and %date%. For a complete list of the variables, see Substitution variables/macros.\n\nIn Position, select the location on the page where you want watermark to be displayed. This can be Bottom of page, Top of page, Full page, or Custom. Custom is intended for advanced situations where some tweaking is required due to differences in the page printable area. Custom positions are specified as the distance, in millimeters, from the top or bottom of the page (Longitude), and from the left or right of the page (Latitude).\n\nFor Bottom of page and Top of page, complete the following options:\n\nIn Text, enter the text to be printed in the watermark. You can use macro substitution variables, such as %user% and %date%. For a complete list of the variables, see Substitution variables/macros.\n\nGray level—determines how dark or light the text will be. Medium is the default. Light is just viewable.\n\nFont size (points)—determines the watermark text size.\n\nFor Full page, complete the following options:\n\nIn Text, enter the text to be printed in the watermark. You can use macro substitution variables, such as %user% and %date%. For a complete list of the variables, see Substitution variables/macros.\n\nFor Custom, complete the following options:\n\nIn Text, enter the text to be printed in the watermark. You can use macro substitution variables, such as %user% and %date%. For a complete list of the variables, see Substitution variables/macros.\n\nGray level—determines how dark or light the text will be. Medium is the default. Light is just viewable.\n\nFont size (points)—determines the watermark text size.\n\nHorizontal Position—the distance, in millimeters, from the top or bottom of the page. Select one of the following, then enter the number of millimeters:\n\nDistance from top of page\n\nDistance from bottom of page\n\nVertical Position—the distance, in millimeters, from the left or right of the page. Select one of the following, then enter the number of millimeters:\n\nDistance from top of page\n\nDistance from bottom of page\n\nClick OK.\n\nSubstitution variables/macros\n\nSubstitution variables / macros\n\nRestrictions and limitations\n\nTo ensure a document that has a unique single signature, use only one digital signature macro in a watermark. The digital signature macros are:\n\n%bates%\n\n%signature%\n\n%sig_md5%\n\n%sig_sha1%\n\nDigital signatures in detail (advanced)\n\nSignature algorithm\n\nPaperCut NG/MF document digital signatures are generated using a cryptographic technique called an HMAC ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC ). This works by taking various print job attributes, such as print time, username, printer name, and document name, and combining them with a secret key. The result is then passed through a digest algorithm such as MD5. The resulting signature is unique to the document. The secret key portioning ensures that it is not possible to predict a signature. Two message digest algorithms are available:\n\nMD5 — MD5 is secure enough for print job signature applications. Because the signatures are shorter, using MD5 makes it easier to enter keys to find matching print jobs.\n\nVerifying a signature\n\nIf a document is located, for example, due to an information leak, you can use the signature to track down the print event details such as the originating user, time of print, and other details. This is done as follows:\n\nFor example, the following screenshot shows how to search for the print job with signature b608c7a39f08643768051217f2f5315a in the job log.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nWatermarking requires print jobs to be printed in PostScript or PCL format. If your document is printed in EMF you might be able to print in PostScript or PCL by following the procedure listed in the EMF section below. For all other drivers, see Other Printer Languages .\n\nEMF\n\nOn Windows systems, if the printer language for a job lists as EMF, then turn off Advanced Printing Features. Disabling this option causes print jobs to be rendered into their printer language on the client side. Enabling it can result in rendering on the server side, which is usually unwanted.\n\nYou can do this by following these steps:\n\nYou can read more about this setting on the Microsoft website at: http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=268093 .\n\nOther printer languages\n\nIf the printer language for a job is listed as a non-supported language, such as ESC/P2(Epson), then watermarking does not work. The manufacturer might also support other languages, such as PostScript. Check the printer manufacturer’s website download page for details.\n\nUpdating printer drivers"
