She’s a campaigner for Gurkhas’ rights, animal welfare and threatened tribes. She has a grown-up son and lives with her second husband, the conductor Stephen Barlow, in London and Dumfries.\n\nNever give up. I’m an example of someone who was overlooked and underrated and who got there in the end. The biggest lesson was you always have to keep trying."
