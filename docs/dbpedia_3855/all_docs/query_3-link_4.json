        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Happy Place on Spotify. Does music have the power to emotionally transport you? It certainly does for actress Joanna Lumley and composer Stephen Barlow. Married for nearly 40 years, they share a huge passion for classical music in particular. In this chat with Fearne, Joanna and Stephen explain how music and performing are threads that have always woven their lives together, as well as wondering that sometimes external noise and chatter has to be quietened in order for us to be creative. Joanna & The Maestro is available to listen to on all podcast platforms.Listen on Apple Podcasts here: https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/joanna-lumley-the-maestro/id1663272172 Hosted on Acast.
