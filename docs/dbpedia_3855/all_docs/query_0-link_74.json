        "text": "Died and Survived (Lionsgate Sound): British journalist and broadcaster Charlie Webster completed a 3,000-mile charity cycle from Europe to South America ahead of the 2016 Olympics, but became critically ill and was put on life support. While in the coma she experienced a near-death experience. Over eight episodes, the first two of which were released on January 11, Charlie shares her experience of being in a coma. She offers an inspirational outlook on how to approach death as well as living in the here and now.\n\nJoanna Lumley and the Maestro (Bauer Media): Launching on Tuesday, January 17, Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley and her conductor, composer, musician husband Stephen Barlow promise affectionate, engaging, and funny conversations about their 40 years of marriage, with music performed by the ‘maestro’ himself.\n\nPlease Tell Me A Story (Somethin' Else and Sony Music Entertainment): Hosted by actor, comedian, and writer Omid Djalili, Please Tell Me A Story sees him joined by five other comedians — including Seán Burke, star of RTÉ sketch show No Worries If Not! — each of whom get an episode to themselves to, yes, you guessed it, tell their story. “The premise of the show is simple: Six comedians have one funny story to tell. But can they pass the story along the chain without completely twisting the tale? Can they resist their comedic urges and tell it to us straight?” Djalili started the chain on the first episode last week."
