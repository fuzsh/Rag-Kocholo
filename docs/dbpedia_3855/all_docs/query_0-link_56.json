        "text": "If I could change anything about myself I’d... have a smooth neck. I sometimes hold it in my hands and think, “Gosh, if my neck was smooth, people might think I was younger.”\n\nThe most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for me is... write me a love note. Sometimes when my husband goes away, I find a note from him on my pillow.\n\nNot a lot of people know this but I’m very good at... darning. I can’t cut out a piece of cloth and make a lovely dress, but I can mend tears in shirts and sew on buttons.\n\nYou may not know it but I’m no good at... grand dinner parties. I’m not terribly good at three-page recipes – I tend to skip bits – or anything that involves marinating things in juniper berries.\n\nI hate people losing their temper and saying things that can’t be taken back\n\nTo wake myself up I... have a cup of coffee. I’m very good at getting up in the morning – so much of my life has been spent on film sets where we start at the crack of dawn.\n\nLast thing at night I always... read until the book falls to the floor.\n\nI am currently reading… Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand [by Helen Simonson] and Here is New York by EB White, because I’m about to go there.\n\nIf I have time to myself... I draw. My aim is to do a really good portrait of my granddaughters.\n\nWhen I’m feeling down I... listen to music – anything from Beethoven to The Beach Boys.\n\nMy greatest weakness is… salted peanuts.\n\nMy “happy place” is... our little cottage in Dumfries.\n\nMy best friend is... my husband. But also my son, my sister, my cousins, Jennifer Saunders – who is just a dream – my agent… The list goes round the block.\n\nThe best thing my parents taught me... was to love things that aren’t beautiful. As children, we rescued snails and spiders. We handled snakes. We never killed things.\n\nI always try to avoid... arguments. I hate people losing their temper and saying things that can’t be taken back.\n\nIt’s not good for my image but I like... cigarettes. I’ll have the odd one with a glass of wine. It’s rather sad we’ve been so ostracised – we’re not all chain smokers.\n\nIf I could pass any law I... would introduce proper care homes for the elderly, where we could all feel safe, secure and happy in our old age.\n\nWhen I was a child I wanted to be... a brain surgeon, a ballerina, the Prime Minister and I wanted to win a point-to-point horse race. As an actor, I could do all those things.\n\nThe most expensive thing I’ve frittered money on… was my 1949 Rolls-Royce. The brakes didn’t work and the doors kept flying open – it cost £550 when I bought it in 1968. I had to sell it two years later because I was so poor.\n\nThe best day of my life was… my 12th birthday. I was away at my convent boarding school. I got a Buddy Holly record, a pair of shoes I always wanted and a postal order from an aunt.\n\nMy last meal would be… avocado pear, salted peanuts, a hot vegetable curry and a glass of champagne.\n\nMy proudest moment... was standing with the Gurkhas outside Parliament and hearing that, regardless of when they served, they had the right to settle in the UK.\n\nMy biggest regret is... nothing. If you can’t alter it, let it go.\n\nTo celebrate the 120th anniversary since Sharwood’s brought mango chutney to the UK, Joanna has partnered with the brand to create a limited-edition Kashmiri Chilli flavour – 10p from every bottle will be donated to The Gurkha Welfare Trust."
