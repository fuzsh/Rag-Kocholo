        "text": "Buckle up Wagnerians! the Ring cycle is coming to Surrey\n\nStarting in 2026, Grange Park Opera undertakes the mammoth feat of staging the complete Ring cycle across four successive years.\n\nWagner’s epic Der Ring des Nibelungen (usually known simply as the Ring cycle) starts in 2026 with Das Rheingold, followed by Die Walküre (2027), Siegfried (2028) and finishing with Götterdämmerung in 2029.\n\nRead more\n\n2023 at Grange Park Opera, Surrey … in search of a donkey – 8 June – 13 July 2023\n\nThe world has never needed opera more, and opera companies have never needed their audiences more. Grange Park Opera also really need a live donkey….\n\nThe 2023 season presents three great love stories, a Welsh Knight, and another of their highly acclaimed productions created on location and available for the whole world to stream for free.\n\nRead more\n\nGrange Park Opera Summer 2021\n\nTickets go on sale to the public on Tuesday 23 March for the 2021 season at Grange Park Opera, Surrey (10 June – 18 July).\n\nThis season covers a deliberately broad range of productions from the traditional, a rarity for connoisseurs, to a brand new – and highly topical – work. And then there’s an old favourite thrown in.\n\nThe season curtain-raiser is an unmissable production of Falstaff with opera superstar Bryn Terfel in the title role. Of equal importance, is the world premiere of The Life & Death of Alexander Litvinenko, the tragic story of the poisoning of the Russian dissident, which has been rescheduled from the Lost 2020 Season. Opera giant David Pountney directs Rimsky-Korsakov’s hidden gem: the composer’s first opera, Ivan the Terrible – also known as The Maid of Pskov – and then there’s the world’s favourite opera, La Bohème, to round off the season.\n\nRead more"
