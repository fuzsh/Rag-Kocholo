In 2017, she was honoured with the BAFTA Fellowship award.\n\nSome of her other roles include The New Avengers, Sapphire & Steel, Sensitive Skin, Jam & Jerusalem, as a Bond girl in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Trail of the Pink Panther, James and the Giant Peach, Ella Enchanted, and The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nWhat activism has Joanna Lumley been involved in?\n\nLumley is an advocate and human rights activist for Survival International and the Gurkha Justice Campaign.\n\nIn 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all Nepalese-origin Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Lumley led a large group including Gurkhas from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people.\n\nIn May of the following year, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.\n\nAs a result of her campaigning skills, there were calls for Lumley to stand as a Member of Parliament at the next general election. However, she dismissed the chances of this ever happening\n\nShe also supports charities and animal welfare groups, such as Compassion in World Farming and Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals. She is also a patron of the Farm Animal Sanctuary, and is known as 'daughter of Nepal' in Nepal."
