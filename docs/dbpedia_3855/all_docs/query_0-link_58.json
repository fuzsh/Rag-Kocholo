The Dominican Jazz Project is a national pride that delights us today.”\n\n—The Dominican Republic Jazz Festival (Sosúa, DR)\n\n“In the area of harmony and rhythm [Anderson] is influenced by jazz.

Highly recommended.”\n\n—Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\n“…Quest…composed by Stephen R. Anderson, establishes a method of creating a four-part texture by just two instruments. This, to my ears, is the most innovative work on the CD, and is really quite striking in its originality.”\n\n—David DeBoor Canfield, Fanfare Magazine (review of Quest, by Duo XXI, Albany Records)\n\n“…an exemplar of the scholar-musician.”\n\n—Jay Deshpande, All About Jazz\n\n“…one of the bright stars of the contemporary scene.”\n\n—It’s Just Jazz, KZFR 90.1 FM\n\n“Isaiah is a powerful work, full of colors both vivid and, at times, pastel. The audience received this premiere performance with enthusiastic applause, with good reason.”\n\n—Geoffrey Simon, Classical Voice of North Carolina\n\n“…freely exploratory, patiently detailed, deeply felt, entirely unsentimental, and continually surprising.”\n\n—Thomas Conrad, Jazz Times\n\n“…full of creative energy and the joy of musical discovery.”\n\n—Mark Sullivan, All about Jazz (review of the Dominican Jazz Project, Summit Records)\n\n“Stephen Anderson’s piano playing is a bright star on the jazz horizon.” “This music [is] spirited and joyful, even in the face of COVID and so much death and sadness.

Slawecki, All About Jazz\n\n(Dominican Jazz Project, Desde Lejos, Summit Records)\n\n“More sizzling than fried peppers and onions.”\n\n—George W. Harris, Jazz Weekly (Dominican Jazz Project, Desde Lejos, Summit Records)\n\n“…A reminder of the power of music and brotherhood.”\n\n—Mark Sullivan, All About Jazz (Dominican Jazz Project, Desde Lejos, Summit Records)\n\nListed in 2016’s best Latin/Brazilian jazz recordings\n\n—Ken Frackling, Jazz Notes (Dominican jazz Project, Summit Records)\n\n“Here’s some hot jazz from the Dominican accented by local folklore highlights and breakneck playing. A high-octane extravaganza…”\n\n—Chris Spector, Midwest Record (Review of Dominican Jazz Project, Desde Lejos)\n\n“Stephen Anderson punctuates his solos with a high degree of rhythmic diversity, demonstrating marvelous touch and interplay…”\n\n—Nicholas F. Mondello All About Jazz (Review of Jim Ketch, A Distant View)\n\n“This [recording] by bassist Jason Foureman and pianist Stephen Anderson is a lyrical delight, conversant, swinging and thoughtfully melodic. Anderson’s touch sounds like he drank deep from the waters of Bill Evans.”\n\n—Gene W. Harris, Jazz Weekly\n\n“…Stephen’s fingers fly across the keys like wild birds…”\n\n—Musical Memoirs (Review of Jason Foureman and Stephen Anderson, Duo Summit Records 2020)\n\nDominican Jazz Project, Anderson, director, pianist, and composer. Recorded remotely during the pandemic between members of the band living in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and North and South Carolina (Summit Records 2021)\n\n360ᵒ Jazz Initiative CD, featuring UNC Jazz Studies faculty and students, with guest artists (Summit Records July 2022)"
