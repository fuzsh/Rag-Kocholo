The work of George Seferis, one of the most influential Greek poets of the 20th century, was acknowledged by the literary world in 1963, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Benaki Museum is now commemorating the 60th anniversary of this significant event. The exhibition is divided into three parts: the day his Nobel Prize win was announced, the evening of the award ceremony (Seferisâ€™ prize is part of the permanent collection of the Ghika Gallery), and finally, the aftermath of the award, complete with press, letters, and telegrams congratulating Seferis.
