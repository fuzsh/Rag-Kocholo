The Benaki Museum is now commemorating the 60th anniversary of this significant event. The exhibition is divided into three parts: the day his Nobel Prize win was announced, the evening of the award ceremony (Seferisâ€™ prize is part of the permanent collection of the Ghika Gallery), and finally, the aftermath of the award, complete with press, letters, and telegrams congratulating Seferis."
