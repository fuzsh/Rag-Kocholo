        "text": "The English socio-cultural context was crucial to the dissemination of the work of George Seferis in Europe. Early translations appeared in both French and English, but it was the English versions that propelled Seferis toward international recognition and the Nobel Prize, and gave rise to translations into more peripheral literatures such as Spanish. The wide social circle Seferis enjoyed in the English-speaking world was a key factor in his early success in the United Kingdom. Other determinants were British intellectuals’ empathy for the Greeks during the Colonels’ dictatorship and their liking for modern poetry similar to that of T. S. Eliot.\n\n6 Baud-Bovy appears to have translated Mythistorema, and written a prologue ready for publication, as early as 1935, but this translation, together with two other Seferis poems he translated some years later, was never published. G. Seferis Papers, Gennadius Library Archives, folders 43 and 27.\n\n14 The presence of the British army in Egypt during World War II resulted in the concentration of a group of poets in Cairo and stimulated literary and publishing activity from 1942 to 1944. One of the main focuses of this activity was the magazine Personal Landscape, founded by Lawrence Durrell, Robin Fedden and Bernard Spencer, in which works by many notable poets were published.\n\n27 In the TLS in 1950 (p. 748) Lancaster published a review of Rex Warner's book Views of Attica in which he praised Warner for introducing Seferis’ poetry to British readers. Later, in 1971, Lancaster published a cartoon commemorating Seferis in the The Cornhill Magazine."
