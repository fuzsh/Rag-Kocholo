        "text": "Helen\n\nBy George Seferis\n\nTranslated by Edmund Keeley\n\nTeucer: . . . in sea-girt Cyprus, where it was decreed\n\nby Apollow that I should live, giving the city\n\nthe name of Salamis in memory of my island home.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nHelen: I never went to Troy; it was a phantom.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nServant: What? You mean it was only for a cloud\n\nthat we struggled so much?\n\n— Euripides, Helen\n\n‘The nightingales won’t let you sleep in Platres.’\n\nShy nightingale, in the breathing of the leaves,\n\nyou who bestow the forest’s musical coolness\n\non the sundered bodies, on the souls\n\nof those who know they will not return.\n\nBlind voice, you who grope in the darkness of memory\n\nfor footsteps and gestures — I wouldn’t dare say kisses —\n\nand the bitter raving of the frenzied slave-woman.\n\n‘The nightingales won’t let you sleep in Platres.’\n\nPlatres: where is Platres? And this island: who knows it?\n\nI’ve lived my life hearing names I’ve never heard before:\n\nnew countries, new idiocies of men\n\nor of the gods;\n\nmy fate, which wavers\n\nbetween the last sword of some Ajax\n\nand another Salamis,\n\nbrought me here, to this shore.\n\nThe moon\n\nrose from the sea like Aphrodite,\n\ncovered the Archer’s stars, now moves to find\n\nthe heart of Scorpio, and alters everything.\n\nTruth, where’s the truth?\n\nI too was an archer in the war;\n\nmy fate: that of a man who missed his target.\n\nLyric nightingale,\n\non a night like this, by the shore of Proteus,\n\nthe Spartan slave-girls heard you and began their lament,\n\nand among them — who would have believed it? — Helen!\n\nShe whom we hunted so many years by the banks of the Scamander.\n\nShe was there, at the desert’s lip; I touched her; she spoke to me:\n\n‘It isn’t true, it isn’t true,’ she cried.\n\n‘I didn’t board the blue bowed ship.\n\nI never went to valiant Troy.’\n\nBreasts girded high, the sun in her hair, and that stature\n\nshadows and smiles everywhere,\n\non shoulders, thighs and knees;\n\nthe skin alive, and her eyes\n\nwith the large eyelids,\n\nshe was there, on the banks of a Delta.\n\nAnd at Troy?\n\nAt Troy, nothing: just a phantom image.\n\nThat’s how the gods wanted it.\n\nAnd Paris, Paris lay with a shadow as though it were a solid being;\n\nand for ten whole years we slaughtered ourselves for Helen.\n\nGreat suffering had desolated Greece.\n\nSo many bodies thrown\n\ninto the jaws of the sea, the jaws of the earth\n\nso many souls\n\nfed to the millstones like grain.\n\nAnd the rivers swelling, blood in their silt,\n\nall for a linen undulation, a filmy cloud,\n\na butterfly’s flicker, a wisp of swan’s down,\n\nan empty tunic — all for a Helen.\n\nAnd my brother?\n\nNightingale nightingale nightingale,\n\nwhat is a god? What is not a god? And what is there in between them?\n\n‘The nightingales won’t let you sleep in Platres.’\n\nTearful bird,\n\non sea-kissed Cyprus\n\nconsecrated to remind me of my country,\n\nI moored alone with this fable,\n\nif it’s true that it is a fable,\n\nif it’s true that mortals will not again take up\n\nthe old deceit of the gods;\n\nif it’s true\n\nthat in future years some other Teucer,\n\nor some Ajax or Priam or Hecuba,\n\nor someone unknown and nameless who nevertheless saw\n\na Scamander overflow with corpses,\n\nisn’t fated to hear\n\nmessengers coming to tell him\n\nthat so much suffering, so much life,\n\nwent into the abyss\n\nall for an empty tunic, all for a Helen.\n\nGeorge Seferis, \"Helen\" from Collected Poems (George Seferis).
