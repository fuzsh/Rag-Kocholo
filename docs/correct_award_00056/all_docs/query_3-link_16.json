        "text": "Greek poet, essayist, and diplomat who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963. George Seferis is considered to be the most distinguished Greek poet of the pre-war generation of the 1930s. In his work Seferis combined the language of everyday speech with traditional poetic forms and rhythms. Seferis spent much of his life outside Greece in diplomatic service. Recurrent theme in his poetry is exile and nostalgia for the Mediterranean and his birthplace, Smyrna.\n\n\"Your music is this life\n\nyou wasted.\n\nYou could regain it if you wish,\n\nif you fasten to this indifferent thing\n\nwhich casts you back\n\nthere where you set out.\"\n\n(from Summer Solstice, 1966)\n\nGeorge Seferis (Georgios Seferiadis) was born in Izmir (formerly Smyrna), Turkey. His father, Stelios (Stylianos) Seferiadis was a lawyer and also a poet. \"He appreciated honours and titles, high society and important connections,\" recalled the novelist George Theotokas, who studied under him. \"In society he behaved like a man of the world, an affable European; with his family, though, I realised he could be different: austere, an authoritarian Anatolian-Greek father of the old school.\" Seferis's mother, Despo (Despina) Tenekidou was the daughter of a prosperous landowner. \"A saintly woman with a boundless capacity of love,\" he wrote after her death in his diary. \"I can never think of her in a drawing room; I always see her either on the seashore or among the vineyards and the trees.\"\n\nSmyrna, one of the cities claiming to be the birthplace of Homer, became a major source of inspiration for Seferis, who started to compose poems at the age of 14. The family moved in 1914 to Athens, where he graduated from the First Classical Gymnasium in 1917.\n\nFrom 1918 Seferis was a reluctant student of law at the Sorbonne in Paris, completing his doctoral requirements in 1924. During these years he continued to write verse and familiarized himself with contemporary French poetry. In Paris he had also an affair with Jacqueline Pouyollon, his first great love. Folowing their breakup, Seferis wrote the poem 'Denial,' which was published in his first collection of poems, Strofi (1931, The Turning Point). Later the poem was set to music by Mikis Theodorakis. When Smyrna was retaken by the Turks in the early 1920s, Seferis felt he was in exile. The disaster marked a turning point in his life. He decided to enter the diplomatic service. To perfect his English, he traveled to London.\n\nAfter graduating Soferis obtained a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served in London as vice-consul, and as consul in Albania in the 1930s. While in England he discovered the poetry of T.S. Eliot, whose style greatly influenced him. Seferis's translation of Eliot's 'Difficulties of a Statesman,' 'Marina,' and 'The Hollow Men' in 1936 were later followed by a modern Greek translation of The Waste Land (1949) and Murder in the Cathedral (1963). Making a distinction between copying and translation, he said: \"I think that when I translate Greek texts into our own contemporary language and when I translate from foreign languages, I an doing two different things. Therefore I need two different words to indicate the difference.\"\n\nAs a poet Seferis debuted with Strofi, which appeared in a private edition. Seferis rejected his previous dominating rhetorical tone and leaned on sophisticated rhymes and imagery. The poet's deep acquaintance with symbolism was apparent, as in his second collection, I Sterna (1932, The Cistern).\n\nIn the following collections Seferis left lyricism behind and assimilated what he had learned from Cavafy, Eliot, and Ezra Pound. In Mithistórima (1935, Mythical Narrative) he achieved a style that influenced greatly the development of Greek verse, but he also bridged a gap between traditional and modern expression. Seferis used the vernacular, the language spoken by literate Greeks, and combined his own experiences with history. Most of the characters were taken from Homer's Odyssey, but Seferis also used material from other myths, those of the Argonauts, the Oresteia, Prometheus, Andromeda, Adonis and the vegetation myth. Mythistorima's twenty-four sections are narrated by travelers who are at once present-day exiles and ancient, Homeric figures. \"We were searching to rediscover the first seed / so that the ancient drama could begin again.\" (from Mythistorima, 1935)\n\nIn 1941 Seferis married Marika Zannou, who had two young daughters from her previous marriage. They had met on vacation in 1936. She was a striking beauty, athletic-looking and slim. At that time Seferis had ended his relationship with Loukia (\"Lou\"). Fotopoulou; a highly educated woman who lived apart from her husband; she died in 1939. Marika was first married to Andreas Londos, a former officer, who went back to navy after working in odd jobs without regular income.\n\nDuring WW II Seferis accompanied Greek government officials into exile, living in Crete, Egypt, South Africa, and Italy. While in Alexandria, he met Lawrence Durrell several times. Durrell rated Seferis alongside Eliot. His poem, 'Letter to Seferis the Greek,' appeared in the collection A Private Country (1942): \"O my friend, history with all her compromises / Cannot disturb the circuit made by this, / Alone in the house, a single candle burning / Upon a table in the whole of Greece.\" Most of their lives, the two writers exchanged letters, but for a period, the Cyprus conflict cooled their friendship.\n\nWhen Durrell accepted the position of Press and Information Director in Cyprus, Seferis concluded that he supported the policy of the British Government. Especially annoyed he was by the attempts of the British propaganda to present Greek Cypriots as being not of Greek origin but of Phoenician origin. ('Dwellers in the Greek Eye (George Serefis and Lawrence Durrell)' by George Thaniel, in Scripta Mediterranea 8-9, 1987-1988, pp. 21-22).\n\nSome of Seferis's best poems date from the war years, including 'Last Stop' from 1944, written in the Italian village of Cava dei Tirreni: \"Man frays easily in wars; / man is soft, a sheaf of grass, / lips and fingers that hunger for a white breats / eyes that half-close in the radiance of day / and feet that would run, no matter how tired, / at the slightest call of profit. . .\" (translated by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard) Both Seferis and Cavafy shared similar background as Greeks living abroad, but reading Cavafy's poetry had no uplifting effect on Seferis. \"Cavafy, in different circumstances, was not robust enough to be of help,\" Seferis said. (Lawrence Durrell and the Greek World, edited by Anna Lillios, 2004, p. 126) His return to war-torn Athens was filled with feelings of sadness. On Friday, January 12, 1945 he wrote in his diary: \"Yesterday I made the rounds of the wounded city: Athenas, Piraeus, September Third, St. Constantine streets, Kanningos Square. Ruins, ruins; houses blown up, shattered, in that eerie and dreadful humor man's works assume when they're broken up and made useless.\" (A Poet's Journal: Days of 1945-1951, translated by Athan Anagnostopoulos, 1974, p. 3)\n\nAfter the war Seferes held diplomatic posts in Lebanon (1953-57), Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, and served as the Greek ambassador in London from 1957 to 1962. \"Wherever I travel, Greece wounds me,\" he said. The three-part poem Kíkhli (1947, Thrush) was not a criticaal success. The name of the book was derived from a shipwreck Seferis had witnessed off the coast of Poros. His first publication in English, The King of Assine and Other Poems, came out in 1948. During the Cyprus crisis in the 1950s, he contributed to the negotiations that resulted in the London Agreement (1959), making Cyprus independent of British rule.\n\nSeferis's years as a diplomat in several countries made him a modern Odysseus. The theme of wandering was further developed in the persona of Stratis Thalassinos in three collections, Logbooks, written in Albania, South Africa and in Italy (1940-65). The last collection, Logbook 3, was dedicated to the people of Cyprus, was written during his trip to the island in the fall of 1953. \"I find it more honorable and \"moral\" . . . for . . . someone to craft a fine table, for example, than to leave the hammer and chisel to go to a coffeehouse and talk politics,\" he said in a letter to the novelist George Theotokas. (The Iron Storm: The Impact on Greek Culture of the Military Junta, 1967-1974 by Thomas Doulis, 2011, p. 58)\n\nUpon retiring retired from governmental service in 1962 Seferis settled in Athens, where he lived comfortably. Throughout his career as a diplomat Seferis had displayed loyalty to the government, but in March 1969, with the help of the BBC World Service, Seferis declared in a broadcast his opposition to the Papadopoulos dictatorship after the military coup of 1967: \"we live in a state of enforced necrosis, where all the spiritual values we have managed to keep alive, painfully and painfully, are also going to get bogged down in muddy, static waters . . .\" ('Introduction,' in George Seferis: Collected Poems, translated by Manolis Aligizakis, 2012, p. xxviii)\n\nSeferis also expressed his fears about the triumph of commercial culture and once told of his dream in which the Parthenon was auctioned off to become an advertisement, \"every column a gigantic tube of toothpaste.\" Seferis died on September 20, 1971. At that time Greece was still under the control of the Colonels' military junta. Thousands of young people escorted his coffin, to honor him as a spokesman for freedom. His widow cut off her hair and flung it into his grave. \"I am fully conscious that we do not live in a time when the poet can believe that fame awaits him, but in a time of oblivion. This doesn't make me less dedicated to my beliefs, I am more so.\"\n\nFor further reading: The Marble Threshing Floor by P. Sherrard (1956); Modern Greek Poetry by K.
