Today marks the 60th anniversary of the award. \n\n\"I belong to a small country. A rocky promontory in the Mediterranean, it has nothing to distinguish it but the efforts of its people, the sea, and the light of the sun. It is a small country, but its tradition is immense and has been handed down through the centuries without interruption. The Greek language has never ceased to be spoken. It has undergone the changes that all living things experience, but there has never been a gap. This tradition is characterized by love of the human; justice is its norm. In the tightly organized classical tragedies the man who exceeds his measure is punished by the Erinyes. And this norm of justice holds even in the realm of nature.\"\n\nGeorge Seferis from his Nobel speech. \n\nðŸ“· Seferis' Nobel Prize at the Ghika Gallery in Athens \n\nðŸ“– 'Novel and Other Poems' by George Seferis is translated by Roderick Beaton and is available now from all reputable UK bookstores and online retailers \n\nðŸ“š For more information, head to the link in bio \n\n#georgeseferis\n#nobelprize #novelandotherpoems #greekbookstagram #readgreekauthors #greekpoetry #readtheworld #readgreece\".",
