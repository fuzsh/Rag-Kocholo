        "text": "In The Sea Caves. George Seferis Poem.\n\nSEFERIS, George.\n\n$3,800.00\n\nItem Number: 3776\n\nOne page signed handwritten poem completely in the hand of George Seferis. Translated from the Greek: “In the sea caves, there’s a thirst there’s a love, there’s an ecstasy, all hard like shells, you can hold them in your palm. In the sea caves, for whole days I gazed into your eyes, and I didn’t know you nor did you know me. George Seferis.” Original manuscripts from Seferis are rare. Double matted and framed. The entire piece measures 12 inches by 20 inches.\n\nIn 1963, George Seferis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"for his eminent lyrical writing, inspired by a deep feeling for the Hellenic world of culture.\" Seferis was the first Greek to receive the prize. While Seferis has sometimes been considered a nationalist poet, his 'Hellenism' had more to do with his identifying a unifying strand of humanism in the continuity of Greek culture and literature."
