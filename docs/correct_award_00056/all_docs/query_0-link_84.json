        "text": "Venerating the past in the form of tradition and adapting or appropriating it for modern purposes could be seen as two modes of engagement with antiquity, involving a certain hierarchy, either privileging the authority of the past or assigning priority to the present in radically recasting the ancient material. This article will explore whether in the interstices between tradition and appropriation it is possible to position/locate a third approach which would not involve a reverence for the past or radical revisioning of the classical material but could generate a dialogue between source and adaptation, with the aim of encouraging their mutual illumination. It will consider the extent to which this dialogic or interactive mode of classical reception has proved more appealing to modern Greek poets dealing with conceptions of history, time and politics and explore its epistemological implications by focusing on 'mythological' poems by George Seferis and Yannis Ritsos that allude to the political developments of the period in which they were written and engage with the past in different ways.\n\nThe Greek poet George Seferis (1900-1971) spent 10 months in South Africa during WWII as a senior diplomatic official attached to the Greek government in exile. Drawing on his diary entries, correspondence and poetry this article challenges earlier interpretations of his work best described as a ‘synchronic panoptic vision’ (Bhabha). Beginning with an exploration of the troubled relationship between the ‘glory that was Greece’ and the failure of its early 20th century nationalist, expansionist and modernization projects, the article argues that Seferis tried to overcome alienation from landscape and a crisis of creativity in two ways: he transcribed and commented on Cavafy’s poetry, but was unable to resolve his relationship with the latter; by reaching down into the ruins of ancient Greece and back into its mythological past, through a process of negative displacement he transforms these crises into a descent to the world of the dead. Unlike Odysseus, he receives no guidance from its inhabitants, for they speak only the language of flowers and there are none. Accompanying Seferis’ dual purpose use of classical mythology as national heritage and ironic device is a more problematic aspect of modernism – the relegation of Africa and its sub-Saharan inhabitants to a primitive otherness that, he felt, limited his ability to express himself, and which generated some of his greatest poetry.\n\nIn 1931, the Greek poet George Seferis discovered T.S. Eliot’s 1922 poem The Waste Land in London. His translation of this long poem appeared five years later (three years after Takis Papatsonis’ translation had appeared in the periodical Ο Κύκλος/O Kyklos) and several editions followed, in 1949, 1965 and 1967, while it has since been translated again by Sarantēs Giorgos (1958, 1964) and Kleitos Kyrou (1990). The 1970s were crucial in this itinerary because it was in 1976 when Greek poet and critic Nasos Vayenas wrote a fictional piece on published and unfinished versions of The Waste Land called ‘Patroclus Yiatras or The Greek translations of The Waste Land’ («Πάτροκλος Γιατράς ή Οι ελληνικές μεταφράσεις της Έρημης Χώρας»). This was an examination of various versions of the translated poem focused around the efforts of an imaginary figure, the poet’s alter-ego, to contribute his own translation and a turning point in the reception of Eliot’s work in Greece as in 1984 another poet, Elias Lagios, produced his own long poem, Η Έρημη Γη (Erēmē Gē, translated as Desolate Land), which linked Eliot’s The Waste Land – and its translation by Seferis – with Vayenas’ 1976 piece. Going even further, Lagios’ poem connected Dionysios Solomos’ poetry (from a verse from which Lagios borrowed his title) with Το Δεύτερο Αντάρτικο (The Second Rebel Movement) by Foivos Gregoriades, a four-volume book on the Greek Civil War (1945-1949) that ensued the Second World War in Greece. The ‘Notes to Erēmē Gē’ that accompany Lagios’ poem – following here too the notes at the end of Eliot’s poem – reveal a mosaic of literary and political references from Homer to modern Greek poets Kostes Palamas, C.P. Cavafy and Angelos Sikelianos and from folk and rebel songs to the man with the carnation (dedicated to the memory of Nikos Beloyiannis) from a poem by Yiannis Ritsos. Lagios, Vayenas notes, rewrites Eliot’s poem from the perspective of a leftist Greek poet ‘reproducing the transcendental quest of The Waste Land with the coordinates of a politicized neohellenic vision’ and parodying both The Waste Land and its translation by Seferis, phrases from which he transfers whole into his own poem. Already, the combination of Solomos’ verse, the poet who composed the Greek National anthem, with the work of Gregoriades, shows the poet’s intention to connect the fight for the creation of the modern Greek state and the subsequent creation of a national identity, supported by the narrative of the 1821 Greek revolution, with the fight for the creation of the modern Greek nation in the post-war years and the narratives that dominated then. As Aristos Doxiadis and Manos Matsaganis note, ‘after the 1946-1949 Civil War, the mantle of nationalism was monopolised by the victorious Right [...] portraying the defeated communists as enemies of the nation’ while ‘the nationalist rhetoric (‘Fatherland-Religion-Family’) reached an apogee with the Colonels’ coup d’état of 1967, and came crashing down together with the military regime in 1974’. This article explores how Lagios’ Erēmē Gē used the form and language of Eliot’s poem and of Seferis’ translation of it to construct a version of history telling through a medium that combined the workings of historical memory and the art of fictionality."
