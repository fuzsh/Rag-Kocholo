        "text": "October 29, 2023\n\n'The poem is everywhere. Your voice\n\nsometimes travels beside it\n\nlike a dolphin keeping company for a while\n\nwith a golden sloop in the sunlight,\n\nthen vanishing again. The poem is everywhere,\n\nlike the wings of the wind moved by the wind\n\nto touch for a moment the sea-gull’s wings.[...]'\n\n*\n\nThe forest stands as a shivering pillar for night\n\nand the silence is a silver cup where moments fall\n\nechoes distinct, whole, a careful chisel\n\nsustained by carved lines...\n\n*\n\nThe broken sunset declined and was gone\n\nand it seemed a delusion to ask for the gifts of the sky.\n\n*\n\nThe white sheet talks with your voice,\n\nyour very own,\n\nnot the voice you'd like to have;\n\nyour music is life,\n\nthe life you wasted.\n\nIf you want to, you can regain it:\n\nconcentrate on this blank object\n\nthat throws you back\n\nto where you started.\n\n*\n\nYou spoke about things they couldn’t see\n\nand so they laughed.\n\nYet to row up the dark river\n\nagainst the current,\n\nto take the unknown road\n\nblindly, stubbornly,\n\nand to search for words rooted\n\nlike the knotted olive tree —\n\nlet them laugh.\n\nAnd to yearn for the other world to inhabit\n\ntoday’s suffocating loneliness,\n\nthis ravaged present —\n\nlet them be.\n\nThe sea-breeze and the freshness of dawn\n\nexist whether or not we want them to.\n\n[...]\n\nEverything that has passed has fittingly passed.\n\nAnd even what has not yet passed\n\nmust burn\n\nthis noon when the sun is riveted\n\nto the heart of the multipetalled rose.\n\nApril 23, 2013\n\nThis is one of my favorite collections of poems. I routinetly reread it, defend it, teach it when I can.\n\nWhat is terrible is that Seferis was so loved that people learned Greek so that they could read his poetry in the original. . . and now, Seferis has fallen by the wayside in favor of Cavafy. Like we can only have one Greek language poet.\n\nRidiculous!\n\nCavafy is great, and so is Seferis.\n\nOne reason Seferis isn't read is that he's considered \"difficult.\"\n\nSilly!\n\nHere, what's difficult about this:\n\nDays of June '41\n\nThe new moon came out over Alexandria\n\nwith the old moon in her arms\n\nwhile we were walking towards the Gate of the Sun\n\nin the heart's darkness--three friends.\n\nWho wants to bathe in the waters of Proteus now?\n\nWe looked for metamorphosis in our youth\n\nwith desires that played like big fish\n\nin seas suddenly shrinking;\n\nwe believed in the body's omnipotence.\n\nAnd now the new moon has come out embracing\n\nthe old; and the beautiful island bleeding,\n\nwounded; the calm island--the strong, the innocent island.\n\nAnd the bodies like broken branches,\n\nlike roots uprooted.\n\nOur thirst\n\na guard on horseback turned to marble\n\nat the dark Gate of the Sun--\n\nhe doesn't know how to ask for anything: he stands guard\n\nexiled somewhere around here\n\nnear the tomb of Alexander the Great.\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nUna poesía atravesada por la mitología y las tragedias del siglo XX.\n\nSeferis habla con una voz que pareciera estar fuera del tiempo, pero consciente de su historia. En cierto sentido, no solo habla del mito, aspira llegar a serlo.\n\nRead\n\nJune 28, 2022\n\nAfter going through Leonard Cohen's complete work, George Seferis was the next writer to really grab my attention. For a little background: he won a Nobel in 1963 and never published extensively throughout his life. He comes from the Greek tradition, and if I understand correctly takes the French Symbolists as an influence.\n\nTo characterize Seferis I'll compare / contrast with Cohen, who was a similarly strong, but very different poet.\n\nWhat I find so appealing about the writing of Seferis is that he manages an original voice, original and interesting ideas, beautifully worded imagery, but somehow also resists the temptation to insert himself into his writing. He provides the briefest of glimpses of himself, but he does it deliberately and with intention. And so at the end of his poems the reader is left wondering who the man behind the curtain is.\n\nWhile I liken Leonard Cohen's poetry to be a kind of diametric opposite. Much of Cohen's work involves self-examination, his own thoughts, his own relationship with the world. There was a kind of inward gaze in Cohen's writing, where Seferis was almost completely outward. Cohen was ever-present in his own writing, Seferis was not.\n\nTo be clear I enjoy both approaches, but near the end of his life Cohen's writing came across like philosophy, an inner dialogue. While the poetry of Seferis is something else entirely. Both produced beautiful work, each with a different character.\n\nAs for the content of this translation, Seferis' work is exceedingly beautiful. I often find myself put off by poetry that is image-heavy and shrouded, but in Seferis' case it's a joy to read. His writing just works.\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nSe me hace difícil leer poesía. Es un ejercicio consciente que trato de llevar adelante cada cierto tiempo, pero no me resulta muy natural.\n\nAcá las obras completas de Seferis, Nobel de literatura lo que no es poco, precedido de un detallado estudio introductorio que ayuda a ver el contexto histórico y personal del autor. Siempre se agradece eso.\n\nLos poemas hablan de lo humano, de la mitología.\n\nAlgunos me llamaron, la mayoría no.\n\nNo soy un lector de poesía\n\nAugust 18, 2021\n\nPodría ser una edición bilingüe para apreciar mejor cierta cosas… de todos modos Seferis es bueno y el estudio histórico del inicio (160 páginas!) bastante interesante.\n\nMarch 7, 2022\n\n\"if i chose to remain alone, what i longed for was solitude, not this kind of waiting, my soul shattered on the horizon, these lines, these colors, this silence.\"\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\n„I too was an archer in the war;\n\nmy fate: that of a man who missed his target.“\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nOut of over 130 poems in this complete collection by Nobel Laureate and one of the most important Greek poets of the 20th century George Seferis (1900-1971), 16 poems really stood out for me! They are as follows:\n\n• Mythistorema: The garden with its fountains in the rain\n\n• Letter of Mathias Paskalis\n\n• Reflections on a foreign line of verse\n\n• Adolescent (Mr Stratis Thalassinos)\n\n• Man (Mr Stratis Thalassinos)\n\n• Epiphany, 1937\n\n• Raven\n\n• Mathios Paskalis among the roses\n\n• The return of the exile\n\n• Solidarity\n\n• The king of asini\n\n• Thrush (in particular part II 🤓)\n\n• Helen\n\n• Summer solstice\n\n• The sorrowing girl\n\n• Erotikos Logos (in particular parts I, II & III 🤓)\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nPoetry in translation is an art form in itself. A translator must not only transpose the words that the original poet has carefully arranged on a sheet of paper, but critically they are responsible to reproduce the melodic rhythm of each poem. Without the latter, the final work feels forced, raising in the mind of the reader questions on the quality of the poetry itself.\n\nEdmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard shared an immense interest in the development of modern Greek poetry, together working towards a popularisation of the movement in the English-speaking world. Their translations are often considered as key to the international fame of the two Hellenic poets to have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, Giorgos Seferis (1963) and Odysseas Elytis (1979).\n\nThe “Complete Poems” of Giorgos Seferis in their translation is a well curated anthology. Its main scope is to introduce the reader to the author’s celebrated free-verse modernist collections: “Mythistorema” (1935), “Gymnopaidia” (1935), “Book of Exercises” (1940), “Logbook I” (1940), “Logbook II” (1944), “Thrush” (1947), “Logbook III” (1955), “Three Secret Poems” (1966) and “Book of Exercises ΙΙ” (1976). An appendix containing the “Rhymed Poems” (1924-1953) is added for completion, but without much heart, at the end of book.\n\nSeferis is a poet that the boasts about his erudite knowledge of mythology, theology and history. His poetry is a cryptic exercise of obscure citations mixed with potent metaphors, aimed at creating a historical unity between the ancient and modern Greek traditions. The Homeric myths, the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides, the Byzantine histories coalesce with Biblical references to form a collective memory that should remind the contemporary Greeks that their history of suffering is predetermined. The necessity to re-affirm the past is critical in his writing, for it allows the poet to ask existentialist questions in the realm of the universal. The Hellenic story of the 20th century must have the mythical proportion and poetic purpose to re-establish its greatness in a modern world. The suffering of man becomes the apogee in the quest of survival, and thus an enduring raison d'être, not specific to just his nation, but to the world as a whole.\n\nGiven the scope of his poetry, it is evident that Seferis can be seen more as a leading figure in a nationalist poetic movement, similar to the role Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson played for his own Norwegian nation at the turn of the 20th century. As a leading diplomat and politician, Seferis promoted the plight of his people in both his literary output and his political writings. But importance of scope rarely translates into poetry with the same universal appeal that is common amongst the greatest of the poets. The evocation of the past to connect to the present in Seferis’s writing feels more of an elitist gesture to establish the superiority of the Western civilisation over the barbarity of others. His racist jibes, though few in number in the poems he wrote in South Africa, stick as a thorn, exposing the lack of universal care towards all humans. As a result, we see a writer that sings in his language for the purpose of his people only.\n\nAs Graecophiles, both Keeley and Sherrard turned a blind eye to this point. Their concern is in celebrating a poet that they believe has universal appeal. In spite of this, they seem to be actually the root cause for a negative interpretation of Seferis’s work. By focusing mainly on the content of the poetry, both translators did little in ensuring that the poetic lyricism is not lost in the process. The rhymed poems of the appendix make this evident, even to non-Greek speakers, as it disregards fully the poetic structure, leaving the poems as empty cocoons woven with words, petrified by their lack of melody.\n\nThe ”Complete Poems” as a collection makes a disservice to Giorgos Seferis, a politician who wanted to elevate his nation’s suffering through the sound of modernity. His voice is muted, leaving the reader to battle the importance of one’s writing with the pleasure of reading.\n\nDecember 30, 2019\n\nHaving a quick flick through this as I catalogue it, shows that I should reread some of the poems. Perhaps it deserves more stars.\n\nJune 1, 2012\n\nSome books change a person's life, as the saying goes. If you want to understand the Greek poetic spirit of exile--with both its melancholy and beauty, there is no better entry point than Seferis."
