George Seferis was a Greek poet, diplomat, and literary critic who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1963. As a diplomat for Greece, Seferis served during the Metaxas dictatorship of the 1930s, in exile throughout World War II, and during the Greek Civil War and Cyprus crisis. He died in 1971 after publicly rebuking the junta dictatorship and his funeral became a moment of national mourning and resistance.
