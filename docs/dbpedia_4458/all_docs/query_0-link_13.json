If a power outage occurs during the magnetization process of the MACOdrive power source, backup batteries will automatically take over the power supply for the electromagnets. For safety reasons, the batteries remain connected until the magnetization process is completed, even if the mains power is restored in the meantime. Thus, the batteries continue to discharge until the magnetization is complete. After the magnetization is finished, the batteries are automatically recharged to their full voltage. To verify the status of the backup batteries for the electromagnet power source, it is necessary to perform a capacity test during the startup of the electromagnetic system and at specified intervals. This test ensures the proper functioning of the electromagnets' backup power supply and the backup batteries' capacity. Regularly conducting capacity tests also has a positive effect on the battery condition (performing a discharge and recharge cycle regenerates the batteries). The capacity test is performed: Initially when starting the power source or after an extended power source shutdown. Every 6 months, including equipment inspection and maintenance. Crane Solutions - CERTEX Danmark A/S benefits for the Femern Link Contractors (FLC) users with AXIMA Automation magnet controller only: The control system of the MACOdrive power source automatically performs a backup battery circuit test. The purpose of this test is to automatically verify the ability to power the magnet from the backup batteries, and this test is performed: - After turning on the MACOdrive power source if it has been turned off by the main switch. - After activating the backup power from the batteries. - Every 7 days of power source operation. #Femern #FLC #CERTEX #crane #electromagnet #materialhandling #heavylifting #magnetcontroller #AXIMAautomation\n\n✨ Unveiling Precision in Rail Track Maintenance with Spectrometers by Amiable Greetings LinkedIn community! 🚆 Let's embark on a journey into the realm of Spectrometers, exploring their significance in the context of rail track maintenance and the invaluable role played by Amiable in ensuring top-notch quality. 🛤️ What it is? 🔍 A Spectrometer is a powerful device that analyzes the composition of materials by measuring the intensity of light at different wavelengths.

Abstract: Herrmann Foettinger as an alternative to a regular speed changing gear for shipboard propulsion. At that time, mechanical reduction gears for such high power applications were not available. The core idea of hydrodynamic torque converters and fluid couplings is to provide wear free power transmission using a hydraulic closed pump and turbine cycle. In the following decades, hydrodynamic torque converters experienced significant improvements driven by the automotive industry, and their use spread into various applications. Today, torque converters are commonly used in cars, busses, locomotives, construction equipment, and gas compression as a means of (i) smooth power transmission, (ii) to provide torque amplification during startup conditions, and (iii) to act as a damper for driver and driven equipment torsional disturbances and shock loads. In the oil and gas industry, torque converters are often used as integrated components in drive transmissions for electric motor driven compressors or pumps trains. They provide step-less speed variation along with progressive torque increase towards low speed. For example, torque converters and hydraulic couplings can be used to drive a variable speed centrifugal compressor using a fixed speed electric motor without the need for a variable frequency drive. In recent years, torque converters in combination with planetary gearboxes have been successfully demonstrated as a viable technology for variable speed electric motor driven centrifugal compressor applications. Torque converters are also used as soft starters between generators and gas or steam turbines. The unique power transmission features of the torque converter make it an option for equipment that requires start-up torque assistance and speed control. Modern torque converters up to 65,000 kW have been designed and are widely in operation. #coupling #hydraulic #torque #converter #pumps #motor\n\n🚢 👨🏭 Attention Shipbuilders: TECO-Westinghouse Manufactures Marine Motors! In 1884, Westinghouse introduced the world's first commercially viable polyphase induction motors, pioneered by founders George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla. This commitment to innovation is epitomized in our modern Marine family of motors, which embodies the culmination of these advancements and incorporates the revolutionary adjustable frequency drive. We propelled the industry forward with advancements that include: ⚓ Thermalastic® Epoxy Insulation system ⚓ Refined copper bar rotor ⚓ High-frequency induction brazing. With over four decades of computer-aided design experience, we optimize each motor for marine use, meeting IEC 60034-18-41/42 standards, ensuring compatibility with quality adjustable frequency drives and compliance with major marine classifications like ABS, DNV, LLOYDS, and others. You will find our induction motors in diverse marine applications including: ⚓ Direct drive ⚓ Geared drive ⚓ Thruster drive ⚓ Water jet drive ⚓ Pod drive Additionally, they are suitable for “hybrid drive configurations,” where the motor operates in parallel with a mechanical propulsion prime-mover like a large diesel or gas turbine, offering efficient low power for slower ship speed. Our induction marine motors come in bracket or pedestal types: ⚓Bracket motors feature a common rugged steel housing for the stator and bearing assemblies. ⚓Pedestal motors have a free-standing stator and bearing assemblies mounted on a common base plate structure attached to the ship’s hull. Larger motors are usually pedestal type, and in both configurations, the ventilation system is a subassembly mounted on top of the motor. There is so much to discuss: Shafts (marine grade carbon steel) + Stators + Windings + Bearings + Ventilation + Vertical Motors + Low Voltage Motors + Drives + Service! 📆 Book an Appointment with me today and let’s discuss how TECO-Westinghouse Marine family of motors can provide you with the ultimate reliability and high performance for your toughest projects. 🌊 #tecowestinghouse #electricmotors #marinemotors #vfds\n\n🔥 #FlameSafetyFriday 🔥 Did you know Trimble Combustion Systems, Inc. can #help you with your #directfired #makeupair units?!

It operates by compressing incoming air through a series of compressor stages, increasing its pressure and temperature. The compressed air is then mixed with fuel and ignited in the combustion chamber creating high pressure & high temperature gases. These gases expand and flow over turbine blades driving the turbine and producing rotational motion. The turbine is connected to a shaft which in turn drives the compressor and other engine accessories. The hot gases are expelled through the exhaust nozzle generating thrust to propel the aircraft forward. Key components of a turbine engine include the compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, shaft, and exhaust nozzle. This design allows turbine engines to achieve high power to weight ratios, making them ideal for aircraft propulsion due to their efficiency and reliability.\n\nSubsea Torque Tools have evolved significantly over the past 10 years. Many now feature integrated modern torque and turns counting sensors, as well as pressure control feedback sensors for closed-loop control. The Torque Tool Class 1-4 conforms to the ISO 13628-8 bucket interface, which is widely used in the subsea industry for valve override operations performed by ROVs. These tools may utilize high-specification electric or hydraulic drive motors to provide consistent torque output characteristics. Alternatively, some designs are purely mechanical. Each tool design approach has its own pros and cons that must be carefully evaluated. The incorporation of advanced sensors and control systems can enhance precision and reliability, but may also increase complexity and cost. Conversely, simpler mechanical tools can be more rugged and straightforward to operate, but may lack the sophisticated monitoring and feedback capabilities of their electro-hydraulic counterparts. Overall, the Torque Tools market has seen substantial innovation in recent years, with manufacturers striving to provide subsea operators with increasingly capable and user-friendly valve override solutions to meet the demands of complex offshore projects."
