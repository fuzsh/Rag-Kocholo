        "text": "Registration Railway Management Certificate Program\n\nOur Railway Management Certificate Program (RMCP) was established in 2007 and has completed twelve successful iterations, providing education and enhancing the knowledge of more than 150 railway professionals across the industry. It is a residential course that consists of four modules, each administered as a one-week-long intensive unit including site visits. Each module is held at a different location relevant to the railway industry. Upon completion of all four modules, a Certificate in Railway Management is earned.\n\nDuring each week, critical and topical subjects are covered in a classroom setting with interactive discussions and field trips to aid learning. Field trips include railroad facilities, customers, suppliers, associations and agencies selected to enhance participants’ learning. Group project work applies learning and develops teamwork skills.\n\nThe program was developed by MSU Railway Management Program staff, evaluated and improved with Class I and Class II railroad education and training directors, as well as AAR, ASL&RRA and FRA decision makers and other railroad industry leaders. Subject matter experts for the course include distinguished railroad and transportation industry leaders and experienced MSU faculty. An industry advisory board identifies critical issues facing the industry so that the program addresses those issues, thereby remaining highly relevant.\n\n2024 Brochure | Module 1 – Railway Business Administration, Strategy and Leadership\n\n2024 Brochure | Module 2 – Railway Regulation, Safety and the Rail Industry\n\n2024 Brochure | Module 3 – Railway Engineering and Technology\n\n2024 Brochure | Module 4 – Railway Operations\n\nOur Continuing Professional Development (CPD) provides professionals with the skills necessary to thrive in a railway career—whether they have years of industry experience, just started at a railway-related organization or are planning a career change. Participants enhance their understanding of the railway as a transportation system, its role in today’s organizations and how it can be utilized to best serve customers.\n\nYou may choose to start with one option, but our flexible approach to education allows you to continue your development with us and join the Railway Management Certificate Program to gain a certificate over time.\n\nContinuing Education Programs\n\n(Click for more details)\n\nModule One: Railway Business Administration and Leadership\n\nEast Lansing, Michigan (MSU Campus)\n\nModule Two: Railway Regulation, Safety, and The Rail Industry\n\nWashington, D.C. Area\n\nModule Three: Railway Engineering and Technology\n\nPueblo, CO (Home of MxV Rail and TTC)\n\nModule Four: Railway Operations\n\nChicago, Illinois (railway “heart” of the USA)\n\nRequest Information\n\nYour organization needs well-educated people to achieve its goals and create value for your customers. Our custom programs are an effective solution for employers looking to provide railway training for several employees at one time.\n\nWe tailor concepts and principles of railway systems to the direct context of your organization. This personalized content utilizes our No. 1-ranked, world-leading supply chain management faculty, Broad College of Business faculty, subject matter experts and our experienced and dedicated railway staff. Some of our previous clients include foreign railway companies and their government units.\n\nCourses can range from a few hours to a day to several months. Content can be specific to a particular area or problem to a general foundation in railway systems. Delivery of the educational course can be at your premises or here at Michigan State University at the best-in-class Henry Center for Executive Development.\n\nRequest Information\n\nRanging from the wide dispersion of assets and organizational functions; over the variability of the asset condition and changing requirements of customers, regulators and other stakeholders; via the diversity of asset types and service lifetime; to the interdependence between components to provide the transportation service, the railway as a system is complex.\n\nOften all of these aspects fall within the responsibility, authority and control of a single organization. It is critical for railway professionals to know and understand the capabilities and impacts of the various sub-systems and the interfaces between these to manage a successful railway.\n\nShippers, customers, regulators and consultants also need to understand the complexity and interactions in order to integrate their expertise for efficient and effective engagement with railway firms and their people.\n\nRailways provide a means for the spatial integration of the supply chain and, in certain circumstances, also provide temporal integration. The strength of railways is the transportation of large quantities, either heavy goods or large volumes of cargo or both, due to its physical system characteristics.\n\nThere is no other mode of land transportation with lower land use and energy requirements than rail, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable transportation modes. However, the system’s nature results in lower flexibility compared to other modes. Understanding what rail can contribute to your supply chain objectives to create competitive advantage is an essential part of our activities.\n\nThe primary function of the railway is the transportation of goods, passengers or both from one location to another to enable economic activity.\n\nTo achieve this, several physical, organizational and virtual systems have to be in place: for example, the tracks, traction and rolling stock, train control, and business and customer service departments. Railways are asset-rich organizations owning vehicles, extensive infrastructure and handling facilities (depots, stations, warehouses and terminals).\n\nIt is essential for managers in the railway industry to know about interactions between the different sub-systems, the underlying essential physics and engineering of the asset-based railway to make informed decisions. We focus on the whole system performance and the trade-offs that decision makers have to make to provide the desired service levels and meet stakeholder requirements while ensuring business sustainability.\n\nMarketing, financial and management accounting, risk and safety, ergonomics, knowledge of engineering and supply chain integration are critical for railway managers. Our focus is on the interaction and integration of these functions, covering the breadth of the organization, rather than a single very deep understanding of a function or discipline."
