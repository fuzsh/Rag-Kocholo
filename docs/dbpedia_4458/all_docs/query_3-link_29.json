        "text": "The Tanzania Institute of Rail Technology (TIRTEC) formerly known as the Railway Training College (RATCO) was established in 1947. The name changed from Railway Training College (RATCO) to Tanzania Institute of Rail Technology (TIRTEC) after registration that was carried out by the National Council for Technical Education (NACTE) on 12th September, 2008. The Institute has two campuses namely Tabora Main Campus and Morogoro Campus.\n\nTIRTEC has the vision of becoming a regional centre of excellence by providing competence-based technical education and training in the rail transport industry as well as providing efficient research and consultancy services. Since then, the Institute has expanded its founding mission to encompass, inter alia, training in diverse areas of logistics, transportation, engineering, safety and accident management.\n\nTIRTEC is a unique Institute that produces graduates with high quality education having competent knowledge and skills capable of working in Metre-Gauge Rail (MGR) and Modernized Rail Track including Standard Gauge Railways (SGR). Also, the graduates are competent enough to work in other related fields pertaining to the other modes of transport. The Institute offers Ordinary Diploma and Certificate Programmes in both Tabora and Morogoro campuses.\n\nI invite all eligible Tanzanians and foreigners to join our Institute that can develop their career and guide them to achieve their ambitions.\n\nThank you and I look forward to welcoming you into our suitable learning community."
