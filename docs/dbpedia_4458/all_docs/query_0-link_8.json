Its aim is to present and to disseminate knowledge concerning advanced technical and technological solutions in railway infrastructure, rolling stock and operation. Particular attention is paid to the recent research in this field made in Instytut Kolejnictwa and in other research institutions in Europe. Another important objective of the journal is to promote international cooperation in railway research focused on elimination of (still existing) knowledge gaps and on enhancement of competitiveness of rail transport and other forms of guided transport.\n\nSubject matter of articles published in our Periodical includes wide range of engineering and economic issues concerning the rail transport. In particular, this includes construction and maintenance of the railway infrastructure and the urban rail transport, technology of the passenger and freight service, design and operation of rail vehicles, public and technological safety in rail transport, economic analyses in rail transport, system and process modelling in the rail transport, environmental impacts, as well as accessibility of persons with reduced mobility to the rail transport.\n\nThe articles cover all areas of the railways:\n\nRailways and urban rail transport,\n\nRolling stock,\n\nPassenger and freight service,\n\nRailway traffic control and signalling systems,\n\nTelecommunications,\n\nInformation and communication technologies,\n\nTraction network, power supply for electric traction and other non-traction installations and systems,\n\nMaterials and structural elements of rolling stock and infrastructure.\n\nMost articles published in the Railway Reports magazine are scientific in character and raise issues not only interesting to the railway research circles but also to the University researchers. All articles are reviewed and may not be published earlier in any other periodical. International Programme Council consisting of well-known scientists and railway experts is responsible for maintaining high standards of the Periodical. We would like to inform you that the editors check the originality of the submitted texts with the anti-plagiarism system: Plagiat.pl..All articles are free of charge.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Railway Reports magazine is the oldest railway engineering periodical in Poland and has been published since 1956.\n\nStarting issue 179, the Railway Reports is published in two parallel language versions - Polish and English.\n\nAll articles will be transferred to the National Library of Poland (Biblioteka Narodowa) and in case of liquidation of the Title aditionaly to the state archive Archiwum Akt Nowych.\n\nThe Editor does not accept advertising and promotional materials.\n\nProblemy Kolejnictwa is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or institution.
