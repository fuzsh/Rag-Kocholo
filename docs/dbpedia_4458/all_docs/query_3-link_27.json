        "text": "A Potted History of Shildon Railway Institute\n\nNew Shildon, where the Railway Institute now stands was once a town in its own right, and whilst it's true to say that it exploded into existence to support the rail industry, the true underlying reason for its birth was 'coal'. It was at the western edge of a relatively flat stretch of land between the south of the Durham Coalfield and the North East coast. The challenge that engineers that built the railway were trying to overcome was how to quickly get the coal from coalfield to that coast. The tried and trusted option of a canal was considered, but as is now well documented it was the steam-powered locomotive that was selected.\n\nBefore the railway, there was little here in terms of habitation. John Dixon, an assistant to George Stephenson, recalled:\n\n\"I have known Shildon for fifty years when there was not a house of any sort at New Shildon, much less a Mechanics Institute. When I surveyed the lines of the projected railway in 1821, the site of this New Shildon Works was a wet, swampy field â a likely place to find a snipe, or a flock of peewits. Dan Adamsonâs was the nearest house. A part of Old Shildon existed, but âChapel Rowâ, a row of minerâs houses, was unbuilt or unthought of.\"\n\nThe 27th of September 1825 was the pivotal date, though a track had been laid in the prior period commencing 18 May 1822 which led to the navigable waters on the banks of the River Tees at Stockton. This was not the first steam locomotive railway in the world. Stephenson had done this before at Hetton Colliery. It was, however, the first to carry passengers.\n\nIn October of 1825 a directive was issued by the Stockton and Darlington railway to build four cottages for the first enginemen and carpenters and blacksmiths, The works grew slowly around this, with much of the early work being contracted elsewhere, but by 1833 the Soho Works at New Shildon had become something more like a self-contained engineering facility. That facility required men that had intelligence, and a certain amount of engineering education.\n\nThe Humble Beginning\n\nEducation for adults came to New Shildon well before the same happening for children. On noticing that most of his workers could neither read nor write, Timothy Hackworth, the first Superintendent of the Stockton & Darlington Railway, set about establishing a railwayman's Institution. he held a meeting in 1833 in the cellar of the Globe Inn on Chapel Street with others that included John Glass, John Graham, Thomas McNay, John Pickering and J Stabler, which resulted in him establishing his Mechanics Institute, with Hackworth as the first president. As the Mason's Arms had already been taken over by the railway company as a railway station and booking office, Hackworth initially placed the Institute, at first little more than a shelf of books, within the Wesleyan Schoolroom which we believe to be one of the only two remaining buildings which now still stands on Chapel Street in New Shildon (the other being The Locomotive public house. We don't believe it was the Wesleyan Chapel buildings on Soho Street as they weren't built until 1865. The Institute aimed to provide facilities \"for the promotion of useful knowledge\" and also sought to provide amenities to the public such as gardens and allotments.\n\nThe Masons Arms era\n\nThough the membership of the Institute appreciated the co-operation of the Wesleyans and the use of the school room, their library holdings continued to grow and it was apparent that they needed a dedicated reading room of their own. In 1842 the Shildon Tunnel opened, mening that rail traffic no longer had to be hauled over the hill at Brusselton. A new station for Shildon, aligned to the new route through it, was built to replace the temporary one inside the Masons Arms, freeing up space in that building. A proposal was made that it should be converted to a reading room for the benefit of the Institute.\n\nThe oldes preserved Institute half-yearly report includes the following:\n\n\"In their labours your committee has not lost sight of what has been generally considered as a necessary auxiliaryto Instituutions of this nature, vis:- a Reading Room, and they are happy to inform you that there is every prospect of a commodious and suitable one being obtained in teh course of three months, at the same time they deem it their duty to remark that they do not expect to be carried on by gratuitous labour, also a regular expenditure must take place in order to secure all the advantages which may be derived from it.\n\nWe do not see much difficulty on this point, as no doubt the members will heartily respond to any call which may be made, whether in the shape of donations , or a small increase in the regular subscriptions. The latter method to us seems to be the most feasible.\"\n\nThe sub-committe responsible for furnishing the new facility reported as follows :-\n\n\"Your committee have to report that in accordance with the minute of a meeting of this Mechanics Institute Committee held on the 10th inst,. they have had the subjectof a reading room closely under their consideration. They have succeeded in obtaining a room suitable for the purpose, for which it is proposed to pay a certain sum yearly to the Railway Company, and they have proceded thus far in the arrangements necessary to render the room comfortable and convenient.\n\nTwo new deal tables have been procured from Mr Braithwaite together with six forms of requisite sizes, the cost of these items being two guineas. A large cupboard has been erected at the expense of the Railway Comapny, into which it is proposed to move the library. A Chandelier has been presented and hung in the centre of the reading room, the expense of which is defrayed by some of the committee.\n\nHat pegs have been made and put up in the room.\n\nYour committee have also to acknowledge the kind donations W Kitchen of Darlington having presented them with a fender and fireirons, T Hines with roller blind fittings and W Bouch and R Corner with blind rollers and blinds\"\n\nIt goes on to say that:\n\n\"Agreeable to their appointment your committee have prepared a list of 'Rules and Regulations for th egovernment of the Reading Room' whihc are now laid before this meeting for approval.\"\n\nTowards a Dedicated Institute Building\n\nAn article in the Durham Chronicle in January 1847 tells of the annual soiree that year.\n\n\"The Shildon brass band was present and played popular pieces at intervals...it appears that the institution is in a flourishing state. The Shildon Works have presented the whole of the Library of Entertaining Knowledge, forty volumes in all, The members have joined the Yorkshire Union, kept up their classes and support an excellent newsroom.\"\n\nAlso in 1847, the Institute committee sought to build baths and wash-houses at the edge of the village (supply of water directly to homes for drinking and bathing did not arrive in Shildon until the 1860s). There was a strong desire among the members to have a purpose-built Institute building. In June 1855 the then secretary of the Institute, George Graham, put in his report book:\n\n\"The Institution is in a flourishing condition. The number of members amounts to 160, an increase of 12. We think it would be well if the subject of an enlarged reading room and library were again brought before you, as both the numbers of members and also the increased number of books require a room or rooms more adapted to the purpose than the present one.\"\n\nIn December of that same year George Graham wrote:\n\n\"The subject of enlarging the present reading room has had serious attention, but report no progress has been made. We earnestly impress the necessity of increased accommodation more especially as the members are still on the increase.\"\n\nIn June of 1856, Mr J Longstaff wrote:\n\n\"With respect to a new reading room we have come to the conclusion that the cheapest and best way to remedy the evil, will be to raise the present structure one storey and thus procure one large room in every way suitable for a reading room, lecture room etc., but the members will be aware that the state of our finances prevent us engaging in it at present. During the last half year a sub-committee was formed for the purpose of waiting upon the Railway Company respecting this proposed alteration or rather addition. Their report has not yet been received, but they expect to be able to do so in the course of two or three weeks.\"\n\nIn December that same year he wrote:\n\n\"We regret to state that no steps have been taken towards attaining that most desirable object, a new reading room. Some suggestions were made on enlarging or heightening the present building but we have hopes that before long a new and more commodious structure may be built.\"\n\nIn June of 1857 Mr J C Oliver wrote:\n\n\"We have consulted the directors of the Stockton & Darlington Railway Company, and the matter is under their serious consideration.\"\n\nThat December he added:\n\n\"We have succeeded in obtaining the consent of the Stockton and Darlington Directors to a new building.\"\n\nIn December 1858 the report book for the Institute gave an update on progress, or rather the lack of it:\n\n\"The Stockton and Darlington Railway have not yet consented to build, but there is every reason to believe that it will be begun as soon as circumstances admit, and your committee will not cease to urge its erection as early as possible. In the meantime, we have got the old one repapered and painted and made somewhat comfortable.\"\n\nAn extract from the Darlington & Stockton times of January 2nd 1858 gives an impression of the organising skill and camaraderie of the Institute at that time:\n\n\"The members of the new Shildon Mechanics Institute held a grand soiree in a most capacious and newly erected workshop adjoining the Soho Engine Works at that place. It certainly was a 'grand' soiree, the managing men seemingly having brought to bear with remarkable success their united inventive powers, ingenuity and skill. Trains ran, we believe, from every station on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and although the numbers when starting from the several stations might be considered very small, yet on culminating to one point a most formidable array was presented - consisting for the most part of artisans and their wives, as well as some cases where the artisans had advanced in years, their sons and daughters with perhaps a companion. The room was excellently fitted up with gas, and most gorgeously decked with holly and evergreen and artificial flowers, and banners, flags etc. Such a display of artistic skill in weaving wreaths and festoons and devices from earth's wintry coat of green, and in the delicate manufacture of artificial flowers, we have rarely beheld, neither have we very often been so highly delighted with the surpassing beauty which it naturally produced. No pains, in fact, seemed to have been spared in the decorations. Neither were any pains spared by the ladies who presided at the numberless trays and ministered to the wants of their respective guests. Their provision was as wholesome and good as could be desired, and notwithstanding the continual drain for upwards of two hours by parties successively pouring in, their stores were not exhausted. Mr Taylor, who afterwards addressed the meeting roughly estimated the number present at 600; very roughly indeed we should imagine, for 800 tickets had been sold sometime before the tea was finished. We dare say that when the meeting was formed and all had taken their seats not less than 1,000 were in the room. The temperance band belonging to the place played several enlivening tunes during the time the tea was being despatched, and also during the after-proceedings in the interval between each speaker.\"\n\nThe Station Street Institute Building (1860)\n\nIn 1860 the Institute moved to the new purpose-built Institute building on Station Street. The Institute report book said:\n\n\"We thank the Stockton and Darlington Railway Company in erecting such a noble building as the one we now occupy and which is let to us at a merely nominal rent of Â£1 per annum. We also thank the Shildon Works Company for their liberality in presenting fittings and furniture for the new hall, classrooms and library.\"\n\nBooks were added to the reading room continuously. The Institute also arranged excursions by train for the members, to far-flung locations such as Redcar out on the coast as well as hosting lectures on topics tantalising to Victorian society such as phrenology, astrology. geography and geology, the \"human frame\" and the \"chemistry of bread\". Prior to the purpose-built building opening in 1860, the Institute lectures were held in the British School which had also been built by Hackworth on Station street. That school building, once the easternmost building in New Shildon, still stands today as a dance school.\n\nMembership of the Institute swelled and included many eminent Shildonians, not all of whom were in the employ of the railway company. Two of the eminent Shildon based medics from the Victorian era, Doctors Fielden and Smeddle, attended as did the 'godfather' of brass music in New Shildon, Francis Dinsdale, his grandson and pupil Thomas Bulch and the other noted brass composer George Allan. Daniel Adamson was a member, and years after his departure from Shildon he returned from Disdbury, Manchester, Institute's to give a speech. He had been invited to do so at the Stockton & Darlington Railway's fiftieth-anniversary celebrations but had been unable to do so, so instead made his appearance in April 1876. The Northern Echo of 21st April 1876 reported the introduction by the Institute's chairman Mr John Glass.:\n\n\"Mr Adamson began his mechanical career at Shildon Works, which have been termed \"The Nursery of the Locomotive\" under the management of the late Timothy Hackworth. (Applause.) As regards the New Shildon Mechanics Institution, of which Mr Adamson was for many years an active member, he did not know what benefit Mr Adamson had derived from the institution, but they were a powerful engine for the diffusion of knowledge, and for the young invaluable. (Hear hear.)\"\n\nIn 1885 the Institute on Station Street was closed to be refurbished and expanded. By then under the ownership of the North Eastern Railway, it was re-opened by Sir Joseph Pearse MP. The reading room was enlarged and a billiard room added. The money to do this was provided by the North Eastern Railway, and the labour was provided in the main by the members. Pearse claimed that the place minded him of earnest students the like of Timothy Hackworth and William Bouch.\n\n\"He wanted to encourage them to go on with that institution. It had already done splendid work. It had turned out its Daniel Adamson and others who had received their education there. There was no reason from the character of the population, from the nature of their employment, why that institution, resuscitated as it had been, should not be well filled with earnest students intelligent enough to use its benefits.\""
