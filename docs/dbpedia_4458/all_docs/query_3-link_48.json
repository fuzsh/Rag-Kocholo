        "text": "Programs\n\nThe Foundation is dedicated to supporting the communities we serve and in which our employees live, work, and volunteer. Your organization, or program, should exist in or serve a community near one of BNSF's rail lines to be considered for grants. Please refer to the BNSF system map included in the Policies section to determine whether you are located on a BNSF route.\n\nWhile BNSF is proud to support many causes, it is not possible for us to fund every request that comes to us.\n\nGrants\n\nGenerally, we will consider requests for funding that clearly fall within one or more of the following categories, although a clear fit does not guarantee that your organization will be funded:\n\nCivic services including organizations which are concerned with the environment and conservation, as well as local community issues such as crime prevention, parks and recreation, diversity and community development.\n\nCultural organizations that include performing, visual, and fine arts, museums and other related activities that offer opportunities for underserved children to experience cultural learning events, or preserve their cultural heritage.\n\nEducational institutions, both public and private, primarily at the college level. Grants of an exceptional nature may be made to vocational and non-college schools. Preferably, contributions will be directed toward the improvement of the quality of education. Ordinarily, grants will not be made to finance the expansion of a student body or the payment of scholarships. (BNSF's scholarship programs, as well as the Employee Matching Gift Program, are governed by separate policies.)\n\nHealth and Human Service organizations such as YMCA/YWCA, programs that address chemical dependency treatment and prevention, spouse and child abuse, women's and children's aid and transitional shelters. This category also includes hospitals and medical programs.\n\nYouth organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs, Camp Fire, Scouts, Junior Achievement and similar groups.\n\nA federally recognized tribal government, listed in the Federal Register by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nScholarships\n\nThe BNSF Railway Foundation is proud of BNSF's more than 50-year tradition of commitment to higher education through its scholarship opportunities.\n\nOne of the most successful and significant scholarship programs BNSF funds is the BNSF College Scholarship Program for high school seniors who are dependents of full-time BNSF Railway employees, retirees or furloughed employees. The BNSF Railway Foundation awards up to 50 scholarships annually through an online application process administered by International Scholarship and Tuition Services (ISTS). These scholarships carry awards of either $5,000 per year renewable for up to three additional years if a student is selected as a National Merit Scholar or $2,500 per year renewable for up to three additional years if the student is selected as a BNSF Scholarship winner. To be eligible for consideration, the student must be the dependent of a full-time BNSF Railway active or furloughed employee or retiree, a senior in high school and be able to provide an official SAT or ACT score prior to the application deadline. Please refer to the FAQs located at the International Scholarship and Tuition Services link https://aim.applyists.net/BNSF for more details about eligibility.\n\nGenerally, the scholarship application period opens the first week of December and closes the last week of February.\n\nLook for information, dates and details in BNSF Today, BNSF Connect and on BNSF TV beginning mid- to late-November.\n\nThe BNSF Railway Foundation currently funds the following additional scholarship programs. Interested students must contact their high school guidance counselor for details on each individual program and how to apply:\n\nThe United Negro College Fund offers scholarship(s) to students from Tarrant County, Texas who attend any of the 39 UNCF member colleges and universities.\n\nNative American Scholarships are administered by AISES (American Indian Science and Engineering Society) and are five 4-year annual scholarships based on financial need to American Indian high school seniors who reside in one of the 13 BNSF served states of AZ, CA, CO, KS, MN, MT, NM, ND, OK, OR, SD, TX, and WA.\n\nPreference is given to the sciences, medicine, engineering, natural and physical science, business, education and health administration. Winners are selected by AISES.\n\nFuture Farmers of America Scholarships are administered by the National FFA office. Ten 4-year scholarships are awarded to FFA members in CA, IL, IA, KS, MN, MT, NE, ND, SD and TX and who are enrolled in the following areas of agriculture: business management, economics, finance and sales and marketing.\n\nEmployee Matching Gifts Program"
