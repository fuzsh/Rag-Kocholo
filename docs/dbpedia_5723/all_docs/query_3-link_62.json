        "text": "When the skier Bill Johnson began a brief but incandescent run of success that culminated in the 1984 Olympic downhill gold medal, he upset the Austrian and Swiss grandees of the slopes. To them he was an upstart, the epitome of the brash and even ugly American. Franz Klammer, the greatest racer of the era, dismissed him as der Nasenbohrer: the nosepicker.\n\nJohnson, who has died aged 55, was the rookie who told his elders and supposed betters that he was going to whup them. Like Muhammad Ali, he made his words match his deeds – for a while, at least. But his season of glory was enough to make him the first American to win a World Cup downhill race, and then the first to win an Olympic gold medal in any alpine discipline.\n\nAt 23, he had one special gift: he could hold his 5ft 9in, 170lb frame in an aerodynamic tuck which, combined with an ability to let his knees absorb the corrugations of the piste, and with a good choice of skis and wax, enabled him to build and carry speed down the gliding sections of a course. Folded into that egg-shaped tuck, the product of two sessions in a wind tunnel, he made an aesthetically pleasing sight as he swooped down the pistes at Wengen and Sarajevo, where he recorded his greatest victories.\n\nWhile successfully getting under his rivals’ skins, he was also prone to upsetting his own team managers. He refused to call himself an athlete. “An athlete is someone who trains,” he said. “I ski fast, that’s all.”\n\nIn the longer term, his confrontational attitude to authority worked against him. His heyday was brief and it was while trying to make a comeback at the age of 40, in an attempt to qualify for the 2002 Winter Olympics and, he believed, win back the wife who had divorced him, that he fell heavily during the national championships in Montana. The impact of the crash, head-first on to hard-packed snow at 60mph, inflicted irreparable brain injuries that put him in a coma for three weeks and left him in need of care for the rest of his life, with speech, memory and physical faculties impaired.\n\nJohnson was born in Los Angeles. He was seven when his family moved to Boise, Idaho, where he learned to ski. Troubled and troublesome, at 17 he was arrested for stealing cars and breaking into houses. The court gave him the choice of a six-month jail sentence or attendance at a ski academy, where his talent was spotted and he devoted himself to perfecting his skills. He joined the US ski team, alongside such established racers as Phil and Steve Mahre, in 1981, and travelled to Europe to make his World Cup debut two years later, finishing a promising sixth at St Anton and winning the second-division Europa Cup.\n\nHis great victories followed only a year later. When he won the Lauberhorn in Wengen, the victory was assumed to be a fluke. The following week, indeed, he finished 45th in the Hahnenkamm race in Kitzbühel, a race demanding a greater range of technical skills. In Garmisch he could do no better than 32nd, but a fourth place in Cortina set him up for the golden day in Sarajevo, where an immaculate run put him on the top step of the podium, with a Swiss and an Austrian in the silver and bronze positions, and Klammer – who had dismissed the course as “suitable for eight-year-olds” – in 10th place. His nearest US team mate was 24th.\n\nSuddenly Johnson was a household name in his home country, where he consolidated his status with a victory in the US championships before finishing with a win in the last World Cup race of the season, at Whistler in British Columbia. He bought a Porsche and a house in Malibu, and was feted by President Ronald Reagan at the White House, becoming a familiar face on TV shows, from Good Morning America to This Is Your Life.\n\nThe smoothness of his style on skis contrasted with an abrasive temperament. Speaking to reporters in Sarajevo, he was asked what the gold medal would mean. “Millions,” he said. But, resentful of the restrictions of a supposedly amateur sport, he criticised the way the US team had handled his finances, and was soon attempting – without success – to launch a professional racing circuit.\n\nThe following season was an anti-climax, with a seventh place in Wengen his best result, and barely a year after his Olympic victory he was suspended from the national team for several months after turning up late to a training camp. Injuries to his left knee and his back cost him the chance to defend his title in Calgary in 1988; there had also been a scuffle in which he hit a coach with a ski pole. At the end of the 1990 season, he announced his retirement.\n\nHis marriage to Gina Ricci gave him three sons, one of whom, Ryan, drowned at the age of 13 months in a hot tub in 1992. Johnson and his wife divorced. His money vanished and desperation lay behind the attempted comeback, which ended in disaster.\n\nAfter the accident he lived in a caravan in the mountains of Oregon, visited regularly only by his mother, who lived nearby. In 2010 a series of mini-strokes followed by a massive seizure left him with further physical disabilities, including the loss of the sight of his left eye and the movement of his right hand. Three years later, after surviving a life-threatening infection, he released himself from intensive care and refused further treatment. He survived for three more years, needing help to smoke and eat, communicating via a letter board, and reconciled with his children, before dying in a care home, still in possession of his gold medal.\n\nHe is survived by his mother and two sons, Tyler and Nick."
