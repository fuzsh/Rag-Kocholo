        "text": "In a recent sermon, I expressed concern over new legislation that has been proposed addressing sexuality and gender.\n\nSpeaking about the controversy over these bills has caused some to question Bethel Church’s posture toward the LGBTQ+ community and our theological stances.\n\nBy writing this piece, I seek to clarify my own opinions and some of Bethel’s heart.\n\nI believe God created mankind with a free will. He teaches us what is right and yet gives us permission to live our lives as we desire.\n\nMore: Bethel comes out against LGBT bills pending in state Legislature\n\nRedding Civic distances itself from Bethel, says church's positions 'polarized community'\n\nAmerica was founded on the notion that all people have God-given freedom and inalienable rights. This freedom means that individuals are protected from having ideologies forced upon them.\n\nBut I do believe it’s my responsibility to teach Biblical truth. Bethel Church holds to the scriptural perspective that same-sex sexual behavior is unhealthful and that Jesus offers loving responses.\n\nWe have experienced God to be kind and gracious, and so Bethel only endorses respectful and humane counseling practices that reflect the dignity of all individuals.\n\nRecently, there were three bills presented to the California legislature (AB 2943, AB 2119, and AB 1779) that limit freedom of religion, freedom of speech and promote only one side of several very important issues.\n\nOne bill requires any foster child expressing confusion in their gender identity to be affirmed only in their self-perceived identity.\n\nAnother of these bills would effectively silence certain points of view about dealing with questions about sexuality.\n\nWe respect the right of people who disagree with us to voice their opinion, and we request the same respect for the beliefs that we hold.\n\nWe cannot stand by and allow our message, our hope, and our faith to be silenced. Proposed legislation like these assembly bills ultimately seeks to restrict and control many voices, not only ours.\n\nBethel Church has been a part of the Redding community for more than 50 years. We have always lived in peace with people of all different persuasions in our community. We have never participated in any protest against the gay community.\n\nWe also have many friends in this city (and other cities) who are gay, and we do business without reservation with people in our community who are gay.\n\nEven though we would disagree with some in the LGBTQ+ community, we are not haters but lovers of people, even when we have a different perspective.\n\nI know how painful it is when someone speaks in generalizations and associates me with something that does not accurately represent me. I did not realize that I was being disrespectful in this way when I spoke on March 25.\n\nI ask forgiveness and will be taking the sermon off the internet. I want to communicate God’s love for all people, and am asking that we create a way forward together in our community by respecting each other in the midst of disagreement.\n\nKris Vallotton is the senior associate leader of Bethel Church in Redding."
