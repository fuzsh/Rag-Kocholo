        "text": "Lesson Overview\n\nI have been wanting to make this video for quite a while. It’s based on the teaching in the book The Physics of Heaven, which is very much a “Bethel book.” It is sold in their bookstore, it’s endorsed by their leaders, it’s written by people from Bethel, including their two lead pastors, Bill Johnson and Beni Johnson. The book is a very open appeal to Christians to embrace New Age beliefs and practices. I truly wish I was exaggerating.\n\nIn today’s video, I’m going to share quotes from the book to demonstrate the problems with its teachings and show its dangers. I’ll address the way they misuse Scripture to support these teachings. I’ll also be sharing content from a physicist who has weighed in to demonstrate how fake the “science” of the book is. Finally, I’ll share some shocking details about the deceptions in the book related to the supposed credentials of the “quantum physicist” who they lean on as an expert. Spoiler: he’s not.\n\nBethel Church in Redding, California has presented itself to the worldwide body of Christ as a guide for deeper and more miraculous spiritual experiences. Since they have such a wide impact and reach, and their teachings on these issues are, I am sad to say, not only reckless but dangerous and unbiblical, I feel this video is worth making."
