        "text": "What is Bethel Church, Redding, CA?\n\nGot Questions\n\nBethel Church, Redding is firmly within the New Apostolic Reformation movement, which is unbiblical and spiritually dangerous. It can be characterized as promoting Word of Faith teaching, the prosperity gospel, dominionism, “grave sucking,” and other aberrant doctrines and practices.\n\nThe Doctrine of Bethel Church\n\nLiving Biblically\n\nBethel Church is a member of the New Apostolic Reformation. Bill Johnson, the head of Bethel Church, is recognized as a modern-day apostle in the NAR, and Kris Vallotton, also of Bethel, is recognized as a modern-day prophet. Excellent! Check out all videos and imbedded links!\n\nBethel’s False Teaching on Healing\n\nRick Becker\n\nBethel Church has the audacity to charge $165 per individual for a slice of pie in the sky. Their “pie in the sky” is the false teaching that physical healing in this life is guaranteed in the atonement. $165 for a baloney sandwich is too much!\n\nKingdom Come in California?\n\nMartyn Wendell Jones\n\nSome visitors of Bethel Church claim to be healed. Others claim to receive direct words from God. Is it “real”—or is it dangerous? I visited the campus as a curious skeptic, and this is what I heard and saw.\n\n10 (BIG!) Reasons Why You Should RUN AWAY From Bethel Redding\n\nSteven Kozar\n\nExcellent online presentation by Steven Kozar.\n\nContains supporting videos and links which you should view.\n\n9 Things You Should Know About the Bethel Church Movement\n\nJoe Carter\n\nThe Gospel Coalition Australia recently published an article examining the theology and practice of the Bethel movement. Well documented! Be sure to view the videos and the links!\n\nWarning: Avoid Bill Johnson and Bethel Church!\n\nApologetics Index\n\nMultiple resources on the theological and ethical problems related to Bill Johnson Ministries, Bethel Church Redding, and Bethel Music. Well documented and highly recommended!\n\nBethel Church Preaches WHAT NOW?!\n\nColin A. Miller\n\nExcellent exposé from Fight For Truth!\n\nAt What Price Awakening? Examining the Theology and Practice of the Bethel Movement\n\nStephen Tan\n\nAs a pastor of an Australian church, I too am passionate to see revival happen in Australia. There is, however, a huge difference between revival and revivalism!\n\nBook Review: When Heaven Invades Earth, by Bill Johnson\n\nDavid Schrock\n\nHeresy isn’t merely theological error; it’s error that tampers with our understanding of God and Christ and threatens, if not completely undermines, our standing before him. Historically, heresy has been saved for matters that deny the Trinity or reject the early church councils.\n\nResponding to the False Teaching of Bethel Church, Jesus Culture, and Todd White\n\nGabriel Hughes\n\nVery interesting rebuttals to questions from readers.\n\nBethel and Bill Johnson’s Bridge to the New Age and Spiritual Fakery\n\nMike Winger\n\nThis is an excellent two-hour video exposé!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nJustin Peters EXPOSES the Truth about Bethel Music\n\nJustin Peters\n\nHighly recommended exposé from Justin Peters and why your church should not play their music! Ever!\n\nWhat Goes On At Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry (BSSM): You Will Be Utterly Shocked!\n\nJustin Peters\n\nThis is a shocking video from inside the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry that is dark beyond comprehension!\n\nWonder If Bethel Is A False Church? Wonder No More\n\nJustin Peters\n\nMany people view Bethel Church pastored by Bill Johnson as a church with definite charismatic excesses but it still preaches the real Jesus and the real Gospel. But does it?\n\nProof Bethel Church Should be Shut Down | Get Out NOW!\n\nJordan Riley\n\nBethel Music Is More DANGEROUS Than You Thought!\n\nColin A. Miller\n\nExcellent exposé from Fight For Truth!\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor\n\nComing Soon!\n\nToday's Visits: 0\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
