        "text": "Beni Johnson, co-senior pastor of Redding-based megachurch Bethel Church and wife of Pastor Bill Johnson, died on Wednesday after a lengthy battle with cancer. She was 67 years old.\n\nIn a post made on Facebook early Thursday, Bill Johnson said his wife is now \"healthy and free.\" The post showed a photo of his wife that included a caption saying that she had died on July 13.\n\nBy 11 a.m. on Thursday, his post had received more than 10,000 comments.\n\nOne of her children, Brian Johnson, posted on Instagram, saying, \"My mom went home tonight. Love you mom.\"\n\nRedding City Councilwoman Julie Winter said she had known Beni Johnson for nearly three decades. Winter called her \"a fairly quiet person\" who was an integral part of the church and dedicated herself to teaching about prayer.\n\nShe wrote a book on the topic of prayer, \"The Happy Intercessor,\" in 2009.\n\nBeni Johnson, along with her husband, became co-pastors at Bethel Church in 1996, according to the church's website. Bethel now has 11,000 members.\n\nIn 2018, Beni Johnson first announced that she had breast cancer.\n\nLate last week, \"Bill, Beni, and their doctors felt that the time had come to transition from treating the cancer with chemotherapy to relieving her symptoms. Beni is now at home with hospice care,\" according to a social media post on Bethel Church's Facebook page on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Beni Johnson is survived by three children and 11 grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services have not been announced."
