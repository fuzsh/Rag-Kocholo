        "text": "On Wednesday, July 13, 2022, Beni Johnson, beloved wife and Co-Senior Leader to Bill Johnson, passed away surrounded by family and friends after a prolonged battle with cancer. As Pastor Bill communicated that evening on his personal Instagram account, âShe is healthy and free.â\n\nIn our prayers for Beni, our community felt called to fight the good fight, full of faith to the end. Beni powerfully modeled this way of prayer for us. Upon her death, we declare with all Godâs Church that He is good, even as we grieve together.\n\nThank you for your prayers for Beni, and for continuing to pray for the Johnson family. We look forward to honoring and remembering her impact, and celebrating her life at a celebration of life service in the near future."
