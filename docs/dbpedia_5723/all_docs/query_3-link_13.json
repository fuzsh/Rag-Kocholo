        "text": "13.8K\n\nBill Johnson’s wife, Beni Johnson, is now “Healthy & Free” with the Lord at the age of 67.\n\nBeni Johnson\n\nThe entire Christian community is mourning the death of Beni Johnson, wife of Bethel Church senior pastor Bill Johnson. Beni has also been an author and an evangelist who spent her life working for the ministry of God. She has been a pastor and intercessor for over 25 years, most of those years has served with the Bethel Church.\n\nLast night, July 13th, 2022, Beni passed away after a long battle against cancer at the age of 67. Bill announced her death on his Social Media accounts with the text: “Healthy and Free,” alongside a photo of her. According to reports, she passed away at home surrounded by family.\n\nPassing Away\n\nHours prior to the announcement of her death, Bethel Church urged everyone to pray for a miracle for Beni.\n\n“We continue to stand with the Johnsons for Beni’s complete healing. Medicine is a blessing and a great help, but at this moment, we need a miracle from the Lord. Please continue to pray for total deliverance from cancer, and for Beni’s strength to be renewed,” the Bethel Church page posted.\n\nThe church later released a tribute following her passing describing the influence she had.\n\n“Beni Johnson is a mother to this house and has been for over 25 years. She has led the charge in the passionate pursuit of prayer for our movement and has taught us to intercede with joy and confidence. She has led both from the front and behind the scenes.”\n\nThey went on to share,\n\n“She has consistently made herself known in the spirit as a warrior, a fighter, and a woman of love and truth. She has contended for us, and for the global Church, for decades in prayer.”\n\nRead also: BILL JOHNSON EXPLAINS HOW FAITH AND MIRACLE COHERE: ‘FAITH IS NEVER SELF-MADE’\n\nGrow closer to God daily by getting exclusive video teachings on God Today!\n\nRead God’s Word For You Today directly from your phone.
