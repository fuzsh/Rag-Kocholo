        "text": "Our Heart and Vision\n\nWe are a unique expression of our family, Bethel Church, yet our vision is the same — to see the global expansion of God's Kingdom through His manifest presence. We express this mission by creating a place of belonging in our community for leaders around the world. BLN is not about building a big organization or a denomination, but about building big people. We empower global mothers and fathers to raise up the next generation and provide a place for emerging leaders to be transformed and equipped. It is our dream that our BLN family will cause reformation in the church, release freedom into the spheres of society, and create apostolic places and spaces that will empower every believer in their uniqueness and divine calling to bring Heaven to earth. Together, we seek to take the Kingdom further than we ever thought possible.\n\nLearn More ▸\n\nAre you the senior leader of a church or ministry?\n\nIgnite Revival in Your Region\n\nThe influence membership is for senior leaders of churches and ministry organizations.
