Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.” Carl Jung\n\n“The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.” Carl Jung\n\nAction\n\n“If we wait until we’re ready, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives.” Lemony Snicket\n\n“Trust and proceed.” William Peterson\n\nAdventure\n\n“Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.” Helen Keller\n\n“An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered.” G.K Chesterton\n\n“When you try to be safe, you live your life being very, very careful, and you may wind up having no life at all.” Byron Katie\n\n“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” Mark Twain\n\nAlive\n\n“The glory of God is a human being fully alive.” Saint Irenaeus\n\n“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” Howard Thurman\n\n“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth\n\n“This ain’t no dress rehearsal.” Dave Benjamin\n\n“We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.” Thornton Wilder\n\n“Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive — the risk to be alive and express what we really are.” Don Miguel Ruiz“\n\nAmazement\n\n“Our goal should be to live life in radical amazement. Get up in the morning and look at the world in a way that takes nothing for granted. Everything is phenomenal; everything is incredible; never treat life casually. To be spiritual is to be amazed.” Abraham Joshua Heschel\n\nAppreciation\n\n“Appreciation is the magic formula you’ve been seeking.” Abraham Hicks\n\n“Most human beings have almost an infinite capacity for taking things for granted.” Aldous Huxley\n\nAstonishment\n\n“You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard\n\nAuthenticity\n\n“The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.” Joseph Campbell\n\n“Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.” Dr. Seuss\n\n“The most common form of despair is not being who you are.” Søren Kierkegaard\n\n“You’re only given a little spark of madness. You mustn’t lose it.” Robin Williams\n\n“In order to avoid criticism: say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.” Norbert Johnson\n\nAttitude\n\n“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” Victor Frankl\n\n“The greatest discovery of my life is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude.” William James\n\nAwake\n\n“He who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” Carl Jung\n\n“Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.” Thoreau\n\n“We don’t need to change who we are. We just need to awaken to who we are.” Alan Cohen\n\n“We have fallen asleep to ourselves and to our lives.” Don Riso\n\n“When one realizes one is asleep, at that moment one is already half-awake.” Pyotr Uspensky\n\n“Once the soul awakens, the search begins and you can never go back. From then on, you are inflamed with a special longing that will never again let you linger in the lowlands of complacency and partial fulfillment. The eternal makes you urgent.” John O’Donohue\n\n“Almost the whole world is asleep. Everybody you know, everyone you see, everyone you talk to. Only a few people are awake and they live in constant total amazement.” From the Movie “Joe Versus the Volcano”\n\nAware/Awareness\n\n“The aim of life is to live, and to live is to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.” Henry Miller\n\n“Rather than being your thoughts and emotions, be the awareness behind them” Eckhart Tolle\n\n“You are not the voice in your mind, but the one who is aware of it.” Eckhart Tolle\n\n“We cannot attain the presence of God because we’re already totally in the presence of God. What’s absent is awareness.” Richard Rohr\n\nBeauty\n\n“We do not want merely to see beauty…We want something else that can hardly be put into words — to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it.” C.S. Lewis\n\n“In difficult times, you should always carry something beautiful in your mind.” Blaise Pascal\n\n“Never lose an opportunity of seeing anything that is beautiful for beauty is God’s handwriting—a wayside sacrament. Welcome it in every fair face, in every fair sky, in every fair flower, and thank God for it as a cup of blessing.” Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n“In everything which gives us the pure authentic feeling of beauty there really is the presence of God. There is as it were an incarnation of God in the world and it is indicated by beauty.” Simone Weil\n\nBeliefs\n\n“Thoughts become things.” Mike Dooley.\n\n“Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t – you are right.” Henry Ford\n\n“We see the world not as it is, but as we are.” Stephen Covey\n\nBliss\n\n“Follow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss, and they open the doors to you. I say, follow your bliss and don’t be afraid, and doors will open where you didn’t know they were going to be. If you follow your bliss, doors will open for you that wouldn’t have opened for anyone else.” Joseph Campbell\n\n“Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls.” Joseph Campbell\n\n“I understood how, man who has nothing left in the world may still know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.” Viktor Frankl\n\nChange\n\n“To change one’s life: 1. Start immediately. 2. Do it flamboyantly. 3. No exceptions.” William James\n\n“You don’t have to change. And you can.” WEJ\n\n“When you’re through changing, you’re through.” Bruce Barton\n\n“What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.” Abraham Maslow\n\n“You won’t be worth a damn until you don’t give a damn about the things you can’t do a damn thing about.” Anonymous\n\nChurch\n\n“When any church will inscribe over its altar, as its sole qualification for membership, the Savior’s condensed statement of the substance of both law and Gospel, ‘Thou shalt love the lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and thy neighbor as thyself’ that church will I join with all my heart and all my soul.” Abraham Lincoln\n\n“Jesus never asked anyone to form a church, ordain priests, develop elaborate rituals and institutional cultures, and splinter into denominations. His two great requests were that we “love one another as I have loved you” and that we share bread and wine together as an open channel of that interabiding love.” Cynthia Bourgeault\n\nWhy do people in church seem like cheerful, brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the Absolute? … Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies’ straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us to where we can never return.” Annie Dillard\n\n“I do not believe that such groups as these (AA) are perfect any more than anything is perfect, but I believe that the church has an enormous amount to learn from them. I also believe that what goes on in them is far closer to what Christ meant his church to be, and what it originally was, than much of what goes on in most churches I know. These groups have no buildings or official leadership or money. They have no rummage sales, no altar guilds, no every-member canvases. They have no preachers, no choirs, no liturgy, no real estate. They have no creeds. They have no programs. They make you wonder if the best thing that could happen to many a church might not be to have its buildings burn down and to lose all its money. Then all that the people would have left would be God and each other.” Frederick Buechner\n\nCommit\n\n“Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe’s couplets: Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it!” William Hutchison Murray\n\nCreate/Creating/Creator/Creation\n\n“Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” George Bernard Shaw\n\n“Creation is a process that is still happening and we’re in on it! We are a part of this endless creativity of God.” Richard Rohr\n\n“To let life happen to you is irresponsible. To create your day is your divine right.” Ramatha\n\n“The beauty of the world is Christ’s tender smile for us, coming through matter.” Simon Weil\n\nDeath\n\n“Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Psalm 90:12\n\n“Of all footprints, that of the elephant is supreme. Similarly, of all mindfulness meditations, that on death is supreme.” Buddha\n\n“Bas Sona” (Celtic expression – “May you have a happy death.”) Sacred Art of Living and Dying\n\n“The goal of life is to die young – as late as possible.” Ashley Montagu\n\n“Life is not ended but merely changed.” Catholic Funeral Preface\n\n“Life is a luminous pause between two great mysteries, which themselves are one.” C.G. Jung\n\nDelight\n\n“We change one another through delight and pleasure.” Thomas Aquinas\n\nDogs\n\n“If I could only be the person my dog thinks I am.” J.W. Stephens\n\n“If I could be half the person my dog is, I’d be twice the human I am.” Charles Yu\n\n“If obedience, unconditional love and loyalty are gonna get you into heaven, there’s going to be a lot more dogs in heaven than people.” Richard Rohr\n\n“We long for an affection altogether ignorant of our faults. Heaven has accorded this to us in the uncritical canine attachment.” George Eliot\n\nEmpathy\n\n“Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad.” Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\n(Also see “listening”)\n\nEnjoy\n\n“Enjoy every sandwich.” Warren Zevon.\n\n“It’s not how much we have, but how much we enjoy, that makes happiness.” Charles Spurgeon\n\n“Most people have never learned that one of the main aims in life is to enjoy it.” Samuel Butler\n\n“No man is a failure who is enjoying life.” William Feather\n\nFaith\n\n“Faith is not a means to something further. It is not something we do in order to get to heaven. Faith is its own end. To have faith is already to have come alive.” Richard Rohr\n\n“Fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. No one was there.” Anonymous\n\nFear\n\n“Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Ralph Waldo Emmerson\n\n“Do not be too timid and squeamish in your actions. All life is an experiment.” Ralph Waldo Emmerson\n\n“If you knew who walks beside you on this path that you have chosen, fear would be impossible.” CIM\n\n“If I wasn’t afraid, what would I do? Live courageously. Do it right now!” WEJ\n\n“Inside what scares you lies what frees you.” Source unknown Alan Cohen\n\n“I have lived a long life and had many troubles, most of which never happened.” Mark Twain\n\nFun\n\n“There is only one rule on this wild playground…’have fun, my dear’ my dear, have fun.'” Hafiz\n\n“In work and in life…we’re supposed to have so much fun, like puppy dogs with our tails wagging.” David Lynch\n\nGenius\n\n“I believe that every man has consummate genius within him. Some appear to have it more than others only because they are aware of it more than others are, and the awareness or unawareness of it is what makes each one of them into masters or holds them down to mediocrity. I believe that mediocrity is self-inflicted and that genius is self-bestowed.” Walter Russell\n\n“I am convinced all of humanity is born with more gifts than we know. Most are born geniuses and just get de-geniused rapidly.” R. Buckminster Fuller\n\nGod\n\n“We’re already totally in the presence of God.” Richard Rohr\n\n“Bidden or unbidden, God is present.” Carl Jung\n\n“God is love.” 1 John 4:8\n\n“People see God everyday, they just don’t recognize him.” Pearl Bailey\n\n“God is not ‘out there.’ You are in God and God is in you.” Richard Rohr\n\n“Experience of God, not belief in God, is the invitation of Christianity.” Marcus Borg\n\n“If you understand it, then it is not God.” (Si compreheneris, non et Deus) St. Augstine\n\n“God comes to you disguised as your life.” Paul D’Arcy\n\n“I beg God to relieve me of God.” Meister Eckhart\n\n“God is enjoying himself and he expects us to join him.” Meister Eckhart\n\n“God is not far from anyone of us, for In God we live and move and have our being.” Acts 17:27-28\n\n“God is not just the dancer. God is the dance itself. God is not a being. God is being itself. –Richard Rohr\n\n“The earth is drenched in the presence of God.” Rob Bell\n\n“Celebrate the madness the joy, of seeing God everywhere!” Hafiz\n\nGood/Goodness\n\n“All that is good belongs to you. All that is not has nothing to do with you. ” Alan Cohen\n\n“Yes, there are things in this life that we must endure that are all but unendurable, and yet I feel that there is a great goodness. Why, when there could have been nothing, is there something? How, when there could have been nothing, does it happen that there is love, kindness, beauty?” Jane Kenyon\n\n“There is the bad and there is the good…And then there is crazy good.” Steve Chandler\n\nGrace\n\n“Grace strikes us when we are in great pain…sometimes at that moment a wave of light breaks into our darkness and it is as though a voice were saying, ‘You are accepted.'” Paul Tillich\n\n“The ultimate test of our spirituality is the measure of our amazement at the grace of God.” D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones\n\nGratitude/Gratefulness\n\n“The miracle of gratitude is that it shifts your perception to such an extent that it changes the world you see.” Robert Holden.\n\n“”If we saw the world as it really is, we’d be dropping to our knees every five minutes just to say, ‘thank you.'” Ethan Hughes\n\n“Thinking of things you’re grateful for is the easiest meditation. Do this for five minutes. Then ask for anything you want.” James Altucher\n\n“Gratitude is like a magnet; the more grateful you are, the more you will receive to be grateful for.” Iyanla Vanzant\n\n“If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.” Meister Eckhart\n\n“If you want to turn your life around, try thankfulness. It will change your life mightily.” Gerald Good\n\n“When we focus on our gratitude, the tide of disappointment goes out and the tide of love rushes in.” Kristin Armstrong\n\n“Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.” Eckhart Tolle\n\nHappy/Happiness\n\n“It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.” Dale Carnegie\n\n“Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.” Immanuel Kant\n\n“Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.” Aristotle\n\n“The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.” Marcus Aurelius\n\n“People are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be.” Abraham Lincoln”\n\n“There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way.” Gautama Buddha\n\n“God’s will for me is perfect happiness.” ACIM\n\n“The most important thing is to enjoy your life—to be happy—it’s all that matters.” Audrey Hepburn\n\nThe art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things.” Henry Ward Beecher\n\n“Every since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you.” Hafiz\n\n“Happiness is an attitude.

See it for the fathomless mystery it is. In the boredom and pain of it, no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it, because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.” Frederick Buechner\n\n“Earth’s crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God, But only he who sees takes off his shoes; The rest sit round and pluck blackberries.” Elizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nHope\n\n“Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.” Rumi\n\nHumor\n\n“Humor is the prelude to faith, and laughter is the beginning of prayer.” Reinhold Niebuhr\n\n“I realize that humor isn’t for everyone. It’s only for people who want to have fun, enjoy life, and feel alive.” Anne Wilson Schaef\n\nIdentity\n\n“I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness the astonishing light of your own being.” Hafiz\n\n“Now, with God’s help, I shall become myself.” Søren Kierkegaard\n\n“What you go through is nothing compared to who you are.” Alan Cohen\n\n“‘There is a place in the soul that neither time, nor space, nor no created thing can touch.’ (Meister Eckhart) And I really thought that was amazing, and if you cash it out, what it means is, that your identity is not equivalent to your biography. And that there is a place in you where you have never been wounded, where there’s still a sureness in you, where there’s a seamlessness in you, and where there is a confidence and tranquility in you. And I think the intention of prayer and spirituality and love is now and again to visit that inner kind of sanctuary.” John O’Donohue\n\n“Your life is a series of lessons in becoming yourself.” Alan Cohen\n\n“To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life.” Robert Louis Stevenson\n\n“You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge. It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.” Deepak Chopra\n\n“The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.” Carl Jung\n\n“People travel to wonder at the height of the mountains, at the huge waves of the seas, at the long course of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motion of the stars, and yet they pass by themselves without wondering. ” Saint Augustine of Hippo\n\n“God has entrusted me with myself.” Epictetus\n\n“Now all that is left is for you to become yourself.” Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\n“And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.” Elizabeth Appell\n\n“We are all reflections of the invisible God (Genesis 1:27). And our only way to know God is through this humanity. This is our only road to a little enlightenment.” Richard Rohr\n\n“Love is both who you are and who you are still becoming, like a sunflower seed that becomes its own sunflower.” Richard Rohr\n\n“Close your eyes and imagine the best version of you possible. That’s who you really are, let go of any part of you that doesn’t believe it.” C Assaad\n\n“Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.” Chrisopher Robin (A.A.

He speaks to us the same words: “Follow thou me!” and sets us to the tasks which He has to fulfill for our time. He commands. And to those who obey Him, whether they be wise or simple, He will reveal himself in the toils, the conflicts, the sufferings which they shall pass through in His fellowship, and, as an ineffable mystery, they shall learn in their own experience Who He is.” Albert Schweitzer\n\n“In Jesus, God took human form, human face, human eyes, and human endearment; God is finally someone we could fall in love with.” Richard Rohr\n\n“The more you know about Christ the less you will be satisfied with superficial views of him.” Charles Haddon Spurgeon\n\nJoy\n\n“Find a place inside where there’s joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.” Joseph Campbell\n\n“You will help more people through your joy than through your suffering.” Alan Cohen\n\n“Remember that your natural state is joy.” Wayne Dyer\n\n“Joy is the most infallible sign of the presence of God.” Teilhard de Chardin\n\n“From silly devotions and sour-faced saints, good Lord, deliver us.” St. Theresa of Avila\n\n‘A joyful heart is good medicine.” Proverbs 17:22\n\n“Joy is the simplest form of gratitude.” Karl Barth\n\nKindness\n\n“What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness?” Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n\n“The best portion of a good man’s life is his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love.” William Wordsworth\n\n“Kindness is the highest form of intelligence.” Wayne Teasdale\n\n“Your own soul is nourished when you are kind; it is destroyed when you are cruel.” King Solomon\n\n“I expect to pass through life but once.
