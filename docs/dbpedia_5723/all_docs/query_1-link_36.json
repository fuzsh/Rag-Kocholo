        "text": "Join us for a power-packed weekend to celebrate our 5-year anniversary with two fathers of the house — Bill Johnson and Kris Vallotton — and guest worship leader, Jake Hamilton!\n\nSince opening our doors in 2018, we have seen the goodness of God fill the pages of Bethel Austin’s story in our apostolic capital city ripe for revival.\n\nFrom encounters with the Holy Spirit that grow us as identity-rich sons and daughters to beautiful pursuits of being transformed by the glory of the Lord, we are here for it all — and so much more!\n\nBill Johnson is the Senior Leader of Bethel Church in Redding, California. He serves a growing number of churches that have partnered for revival. This apostolic network has crossed denominational lines in building relationships that enable church leaders to walk in both purity and power.\n\nBill is a fifth-generation pastor with a rich heritage in the Holy Spirit. He has been pastor of Bethel Church since 1996 with a one-word mission statement: revival. Bill’s priority in life has been to learn how to host the Presence of God and minister to Him.\n\nBill is passionate about seeing the kingdom of heaven invade earth across all spheres of influence. The wisdom of God is to be displayed through the church, government, education, and the arts. Bill travels extensively to share what he has learned through experience, with the conviction that the only way to increase what has been given is to give it away.\n\nKris Vallotton is the Senior Associate Leader of Bethel Church in Redding, California, as well as a best-selling author, international speaker, and culture leader. As a spiritual father to this generation, he has helped thousands of believers over the last 20 years realize their identity as sons and daughters of God.\n\nKris is the founder of the Bethel School of Technology, the Chairman of Advance Redding, founder of Bethel Media, and co-founder of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry (BSSM) and Moral Revolution.\n\nKris has a diverse background in business, counseling, consulting, and pastoring, which gives him unique leadership insights and perspectives. Kris also loves to both teach to the masses and advise leaders one-on-one, utilizing his experience and his prophetic gift to assist world influencers in achieving their goals and equip people to successfully fulfill their divine purpose.\n\nKris lives in Redding, California, with his wife of 43 years, Kathy, their dog Samson, and Kathy’s horses, Dreamer and Legend.\n\nJake Hamilton has been in full-time active ministry for more than two decades. He has been a church planter in Southern California, a creative entrepreneur, a local and global worship leader as a part of Jesus Culture Music for several years, and a songwriter whose songs have been sung and recorded around the world.\n\nJake and his wife, Nicci, fueled a movement called OneFlesh, which has focused specifically on marriages and family. Currently, he is heading a men’s movement called THE FIGHT that teaches what it means to walk in biblical manhood as modeled by Jesus Christ.\n\nAs an artist, he desires to push the limits of creativity, and as a father and a husband he is committed to his family first. But above any of his endorsements and accomplishments, he is a lover of Jesus Christ with the ability to lead others into the same encounter that transformed his life over 25 years ago."
