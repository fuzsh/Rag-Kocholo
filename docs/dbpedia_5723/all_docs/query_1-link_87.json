        "text": "U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, who will resign to become Youngstown State University’s president, purchased a Canfield condominium for $562,000 though he won’t live there.\n\nJohnson and his wife, LeeAnn, took ownership Monday of the 2,874-square-foot condo on Championship Court, according to records from the Mahoning County Auditor’s Office.\n\nJohnson, a Republican, had been living for 12 years in a 2,395-square-foot house on Fifth Street in Marietta that was sold Dec. 1 for $410,000.\n\nJohnson will live on the YSU campus at the Pollock House, Ben Keeler, his congressional spokesman, said.\n\nJohnson was in the process of purchasing the Canfield condo when he was offered the YSU presidency, Keeler said.\n\n“They’re going to keep it for now for an investment and live on campus,” Keeler said.\n\nDuring congressional redistricting that took effect with the November 2022 election, the population center of the 6th Congressional District — which Johnson has represented for 13 years — moved to Mahoning, Columbiana and Stark counties.\n\nJohnson wanted to move back to Mahoning — where he lived when he first was elected to Congress in 2010 — because of that redistricting change, Keeler said.\n\nMahoning is the most-populous county in the 11-county congressional district.\n\nAs part of his three-year contract with YSU, Johnson gets to live in the Pollock House on Wick Avenue at no cost.\n\nThe Pollock family gave the house to YSU when Mary Wick Pollock died in 1949. Originally built by Pollock’s father, Paul Wick, in 1893, the house was used for YSU classrooms and offices. A private developer built an addition to the back and opened the Wick Pollock Inn in 1986. It closed 12 years later.\n\nIt remained vacant until 2012 when a $4.47 million improvement project was done there and since has served as the official home of the university’s president.\n\nJohnson is to start as YSU president no later than March 15. YSU trustees are looking to get Johnson to start the job earlier.\n\nJohnson plans to resign as congressman in February or early March.\n\nSome faculty, staff, students, alumni and major donors have been vocal about opposing Johnson’s hiring because of his conservative record and because he has no higher education experience.\n\nJohnson has said he should be given the opportunity to prove himself as president before critics dismiss him.\n\nJohnson was hired by the board Nov. 21 by an 8-1 vote with Molly Seals casting the lone “no” vote. The trustees had called a Nov. 16 emergency meeting to offer the job to Johnson.\n\nCANDIDATES FILE\n\nToday is the filing deadline for candidates seeking to succeed Johnson in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nFiling Tuesday were state Sen. Michael Rulli, R-Salem, and state Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus, R-Paris Township.\n\nRulli started serving his second four-year term in the Ohio Senate this year. Rulli also is director of operations for his family-owned Rulli Bros. Markets in Boardman and Austintown.\n\nStoltzfus, first elected to the Ohio House in 2018, is a former Paris Township trustee and owns Dutchcraft Truss & Component in his hometown.\n\nRick Tsai, an East Palestine Republican, filed Monday and Rylan Z. Finzer, a Bedford Heights Democrat, was the first candidate to file on Dec. 12.\n\nTsai, a chiropractor, gained some national attention for speaking out against Norfolk Southern, the railroad company that had a massive derailment Feb. 3 in his hometown. He’s never run for public office before.\n\nFinzer lives in Cuyahoga County, which is outside the district, but congressional candidates only need to live in the state in order to run.\n\nFinzer used to live in Perry Township in Stark County and finished a distant last in a three-person race in 2019 for trustee in that township, receiving 10.6% of the vote. Finzer owns Finzer’s Finest, a marijuana dispensary in Bedford Heights.\n\nThe congressional seat will be vacant for several months between the time of Johnson’s resignation and when a special election would be held to fill his unexpired term.\n\nThe 6th District had an 18% advantage for Republicans based on voting trends in partisan statewide elections. Because of that, Democrats aren’t focused on this election.\n\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties. Mahoning, Columbiana and Stark in the upper part of the district are the population centers.\n\nIn the 2022 election, 30.4% of the votes came from Mahoning, the district’s most-populous county, with 16.3% from Stark and 12.6% from Columbiana."
