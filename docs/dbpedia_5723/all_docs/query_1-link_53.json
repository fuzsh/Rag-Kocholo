        "text": "* Bill is recording teaching sessions with first, second and third year students as a bonus session on Friday. Notes are in Segments based on recorded sessions. (continuation from November 1st)\n\nAnswers to Ancient Cries\n\nMark 4\n\nI love studying the Welsh Revival because they say that when you crossed the political border between England and Wales, you could feel the change in the spiritual realm.\n\nJesus came to John and John said behold, the son of God!\n\nJohn asked for Christ’s baptism because he knew that the spiritual baptism that was upon Jesus was something that John lacked.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is invested in every believer but God’s presence only rests on people who are inviting Him to come, and remain aware of His presence.\n\nEvery action we make, we are conscience of the presence of God on our lives and we work to protect that.\n\nWhen the Spirit descended upon Jesus the verb used is that the heavens were torn open and it’s the same word that is used later when the temple curtain was torn open. It was a violent act that was aimed tat the powers of darkness. The sky was violently ripped open for the heavens to come and dwell in and around Christ.\n\nIf you and I live conscience of an open heaven, we live differently. If we think we have to open the heavens then we will be restricted. We need to be aware of the fact that He is with us.\n\nIf you consider yourself as on that is under a closed heaven, you are believing a lie and therefore empowering it. Most closed heavens are between your ears. It’s all in your mind.\n\nWe need to shift our focus, perspective.\n\nThe father is jealous for the Spirit that is within you.\n\nWhat demonic power can block fellowship between the Father and the Holy Spirit? There is none. So you live under an open heaven… permanently.\n\nLike Jacob’s ladder, the house of God (the church as individuals and in a corporate sense) is always under an open heaven.\n\nOnce you realize what you have access to, you will live differently.\n\nIt is the role of a church leader sometimes to raise people’s awareness of the Spirit of God n me.\n\nNothing should get bigger than my awareness of the spirit upon me.\n\nAs soon as something else gets bigger than my attention on God, it becomes something you worship.\n\nIf you live with a greater awareness of satan than of God, you will always live in reaction to the enemy. If you live in this state, then the devil has a role in setting your agenda.\n\nJesus lived in response to what He saw His Father doing.\n\nIsaiah 6:1\n\nWhy do we invite the spirit to come when He is already here?\n\nThere are dimensions and levels of His presence.\n\nGod is omnipresent, so He is present everywhere, but as believers, He dwells in us. But there is more to it than that.\n\n“the train of his robe filled the temple” there was more coming in the room.\n\nIn covenant everything is available to us, but there is a difference between what I have in possession and what I have in my account.\n\nThere is a difference between having full access to Him and having Him fill everything we do, that gap is called maturity.\n\nEzekiel 39:29\n\nEvery outpouring of the spirit contains the face of God.\n\nGod would not show the Israelites His face because they would idolize the image. God releases as much of his spirit as we can handle.\n\nIn the outpouring is his face.\n\nThe Ultimate Prototype for Christianity\n\nMy theme verse for this segment is “without oxen the manger is clean” if we want to pursue God, it’s going to be messy sometimes, and that’s ok.\n\n2 Samuel 6 and 1 Chronicles 15\n\nThe Ark of the Covenant was also called the Ark of Testimony.\n\nThe mercy seat was also upon the Ark. So when you share your testimony, you also usher in the mercy of the Lord on their life.\n\nSo the Philistines had stolen the Ark, and they brought it to three cities and it caused trouble for them.\n\nWhen the Ark was returned, they tripped, and Uzzah reached out, touched the Ark and died.\n\nThe presence is never to be handled.\n\nHe is God. He is not a tool we use to bring about revivalist roles, He is God.\n\nThe presence of the Lord was never supposed to rest on something we create.\n\nThe presence of the Lord does not rest on ministries, it rests on people.\n\nSo the trained priests were brought to carry the Ark back to Jerusalem and they sacrificed an ox every seven steps.\n\nOriginally, only one priest walked into the presence of God every year and performed duties before God to pay for the sins of the people.\n\nSo when David decided that “God was not interested in the blood of bulls and goats but the sacrifices of the heart” and two prophets confirmed that. Then they put the presence of God in a tent called the “Tabernacle of David” and worshiped around it 24/7.\n\nThis was a prototype for the New Testament church.\n\nAmos 9 says in the last days, God will rebuild the Tabernacle of David.\n\nIn Acts 15, the church leadership got together and compared notes because they were wondering what to do with all the Gentiles that were joining the church.\n\nThe connection between Gentiles coming to the Lord and the Tabernacle of David says is Amos 9:11-13 it says that when a culture of worship is restored, it will bring a shift in the heavens that allows the nations to glorify God (salvation of the Gentiles).\n\nIsaiah 62 “the gates are praise and the walls are salvation”\n\nWhen the church becomes a worshiping community, you are a spiritual bulldozer that paves the way in the unseen realm for the masses to come to Christ.\n\nWhenever there is truly the manifest presence of the Lord on his people, you will see people saved.\n\n2 Samuel 6\n\nDavid brought the Ark of the Covenant with gladness even though he was afraid. Psalms 2 says rejoice with trembling.\n\nDavid danced before the presence, not after. Wherever the dancing David went, the presence followed.\n\nAnyone can rejoice when the presence shows up, but we need to rejoice so that He shows up.\n\nv20 Michal was upset but David replies “it was before the Lord, who chose me rather than your father…” burn! “… I will be humbled in my own sight…” So Michal had no children. Worship looks foolish to someone who is not a part of it. If you are ever critical of something, make sure you have a divine perspective so that you are not judging something that is of God but looks wrong from afar.\n\nShe despised worship and became barren.\n\nShout for joy barren woman… Isaiah 54.\n\nThere is a connection between praise and futility.\n\nPractically Releasing the Presence of God\n\nThis is what stirred Bill into this area of understanding what it means to host the presence.\n\nWhile Jesus was ministering, a woman touched his cloak with enough faith to receive healing. And Jesus had the discernment to know that she had done that even though he was amongst a great crowd.\n\nHe felt virtue leave him.\n\nHe was so aware of the presence upon him that he realized when somebody made a withdrawal.\n\nJesus was given the spirit without measure, so it wasn’t like he was robbed. But it was the process of release of presence that He became aware of.\n\nWe should want to be like that.\n\nI want to live so conscience of God’s presence that I am aware of when faith is in the room.\n\nActs 19 says that Paul was doing extraordinary miracles (not ordinary ones) and they would take cloth from paul and bring it to someone who was demonized and that would set them free.\n\nIt wasn’t a prayer cloth. It was sweaty rags he wore. Paul was a Jew, and the Jewish mind knew how to work and invite God’s presence into their efforts.\n\nWe are familiar with symbolic gestures (prophetic acts). It was that as Paul would work, the cloth would absorb the anointing he carried.\n\nThe bible never explained this miracle. They just did it.\n\nThis discovery did not come through instruction, it came through adventure.\n\nJohn 6\n\nPeople have often experienced a miracle by standing next to an anointed person because the Spirit of the Lord dwells around them.\n\nWe should be stirred up to a righteous jealousy when we hear of things like this. We want to be known as people who are so good at hosting the presence of God that the Lord is able to do what He wants around you.\n\nYour shadow will always release whatever overshadows you.\n\nIn Matt 10:12 Jesus tells them to release peace into the homes they visit.\n\nWhen Noah let the dove out of the ark window, the dove brought peace back (olive branch) but later it did not return. This is a picture of the same concept.\n\nPeace in the kingdom is not the absence of something. In the world it is the absence of war, noise… but in the kingdom, it is the presence of a person.\n\nWe need to release what is given to us. When peace is given unto us, we need to release it in the world around us and\n\nJohn 6:63\n\nWhenever God talks, there is a release of His Spirit.\n\nThe dove is always looking for a place to rest.\n\nThe kingdom of God is in the Holy Spirit, in the presence which is released through words. So we release the kingdom of God by speaking His words.\n\nWe host the presence but we need to learn how to release the presence.\n\nYou can do this through faith, speaking, touching, prophetic acts…\n\nCrying Out for More of God\n\nSo many of the people we think of as great revivalists got there because they would have all the things we considered necessary for them to be great people of God but they were still hungry and that’s when they changed the standard.\n\nI’m going to share some of my story so that you understand what I mean by being hungry.\n\nWe were in the midst of experiencing the greatest outpouring of the Spirit in my church that I had never tasted of before. It felt often as if there were spiritual whirlwinds in the room and it wa fantastic the hope and joy that woas being expected. But somthing in me was seeking mrore.\n\nI was seeing power released by never before but I knew that I needed something deeper inside of me.\n\nSo I started by asking in prayer. “I don’t know how this fits theologically but I need more. I am so grateful for all the amazing things that are going on around me but somehow I need more”\n\nIt wasn’t a routine, but it was the best way I could express the cry of my heart. So I prayed “I need more of you in my life” countess times throughout the ay for several years.\n\nIt became such a part of the cry in my heart that i would wake myself up praying. I woke in the night crying out for God. I would wake myself up because my spirit was crying out that I needed more, I needed Him to do something in me.\n\nGod had made himself available and said “come and seek my heart” He has given us the invitation to more of Himself. And so I would cry for Him to come and do things in my heart.\n\nDick Joyce was in town for these meetings and at one particular event, we were in the midst of great ministry and enjoying the presence of God, when Bill said to someone “I feel like God is going to surprise you and come to you and wake you at 3:00am with His love”\n\nThat night I went to sleep and then suddenly, I was brought to being completely awake in an instant. It was like 1000 volts of electricity were brought into my body all at once and my limbs were flinging everywhere. I was embarrassed about how I was feeling and I did not know what was going on, but I looked over and looked at the clock and it was 3:00am and I was reminded of the prophetic word I gave my friend. And I thought “you got me good God”. But then I remembered that when Jacob encountered God, he walked with a limp, when Marry met God, she was seen as an illegitimate mother and I thought “will I lose favor with people if I gain favor with heaven?” And I was concerned. And then I knew that God was looking for my dignity.\n\nGod said “son, you asked for more, and you said you’d pay any price” but now I was wondering “if I say yes to this, will I be in bed for the rest of my life because I cannot control myself?” It must have gone on about 20 min before I realized that I needed to decide if I still wanted it at any cost and I told God that I did. It went on until 6:35am and when I got up, I felt completely rested like I’d gotten 8 hours of sleep.\n\nThis went on for several more days.\n\nSomehow I knew when I was done that I had passed the test.\n\nWe all need to be hungry for experiences with God that change everything.\n\nJesus gave power and authority to his disciples while he was with them, but it would not last. So he had them wait in Jerusalem to wait for power after he left.\n\nAuthority is given in the commission but power is given in the encounter. Not even Jesus would minister out of only authority.\n\nWe need to appreciate what God has given us, but we also need to be hungry for more all the time.\n\nBe hungry for a fresh baptism.\n\nProtect the things that God gives you. Don’t brag about encounters or share on them until God releases you to. Others may not appreciate\n\nGod is going to touch you uniquely for you. So seek that for yourself.\n\nInterview Q&A\n\nWhat is the difference between gathering around a sermon and gathering around the presence?\n\nIt’s a shift in focus from “what can I get” into “what can I give” it’s not selfish, but it is about us when we come for a sermon. It is the spirit that changes things from a letter that kills than a book that brings life.\n\nIn the context of church, we know that the word of God is essential and programs are necessary. Why should God’s presence be priority and how do things flow out of that into the other priorities?\n\nI don’t want to just go through routine and create a discipline that is void of God’s presence, but instead we want to be obedient to the directing of the Holy Spirit.\n\nEverything we do is either ignited by revival or ignites revival. So that’s what we do, we promote a change and transformation. Everything we do is connected to that value system.\n\nOur kids, youth and adult programs are connected to revival.\n\nWhat does it mean to host God’s presence? What is the difference between being filled with God’s presence and hosting His presence?\n\nFor me it’s a shift in perspective.\n\nThe spirit of the Lord came upon people in the bible even after they had God’s spirit inside of them.\n\nWe release what is going on in our hearts. When we work to cultivate a presence of God inside of us, it becomes manifest to and though us and changes the atmosphere around us.\n\nThat is hosting the presence.\n\nWhen Jesus was sleeping in the boat, that was him hosting the presence.\n\nBethel has become known for signs and wonders. What is the connection between miracles and pursuing hosting God’s presence?\n\nIf you visit my home, we will set up the bedroom, and learn your preferences.\n\nOnce we’ve hosted the presence of God, we begin to see sick people in a way that is different, we begin to feel different about the world. When we host the presence we begin to be like God, and it’s his will to heal the sick, raise the dead… that’s where the miracles come from.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
