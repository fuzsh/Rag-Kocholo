The post states that Beni died on July 13, 2022.\n\nBeni was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2018. She had tumours removed from a breast at the time, and told media outlets she was \"shocked\" by the diagnosis.\n\nHer battle with cancer intensified in February 2022 and the church had asked people to pray. \"Hundreds of thousands\" of people had joined in praying for her the church wrote yesterday in another call to prayer, and the congregation was hosting a prayer meeting when she passed away.\n\nThe Johnsons arrived at Bethel Church in 1996\n\nMore to come."
