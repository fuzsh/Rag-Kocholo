        "text": "Bill Johnson is the Senior Leader of Bethel Church in Redding, California.\n\nBill is a fifth-generation pastor with a rich heritage in the Holy Spirit. The present move of God has brought Bill into a deeper understanding of the phrase âon earth as it is in heaven.â Bill and the Bethel Church family have taken on this theme for life and ministry, where healing and miracles are normal. Bill teaches that we owe the world an encounter with God and a gospel without power is not the gospel Jesus preached. Bill is co-founder of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry (BSSM).\n\nBill serves a growing number of churches partnered for revival. This apostolic network has crossed denominational lines in building relationships that enable church leaders to walk in both purity and power. Bill and his late wife, Beni, have three children and eleven grandchildren. Their three children and spouses are all involved in full-time ministry."
