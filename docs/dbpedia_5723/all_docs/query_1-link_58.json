        "text": "Fr. Bill Johnson, SJ, is native to Milwaukee. He graduated from Marquette University High School in 1971. After graduation, Fr. Bill attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, followed by the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, and Harvard Graduate School of Education. He was a co-founder of Nativity Jesuit Middle School located in Milwaukee.\n\nFr. Bill was on the founding leadership team of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School Twin Cities, which later led to his involvement in starting the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Milwaukee.\n\nBefore returning to Milwaukee, Fr. Bill spent three years in the Dominican Republic as the pastoral director of Creighton University’s Institute of Latin American Concern. At Cristo Rey Jesuit Milwaukee, Fr. Bill is the VP of Strategic Growth and is responsible for Cristo Rey’s Mission and Identity.\n\nEver since connecting with Pat Parks and the mission of The Center in Quito, Ecuador, he has supported the Center’s community through volunteering and connecting people with this awe-inspiring Jesuit apostolic work.\n\n“I know that the way out of poverty is through education — the formation of the whole person: Mind, Body and Spirit in the Jesuit tradition — in collaboration with the family and the community.”"
