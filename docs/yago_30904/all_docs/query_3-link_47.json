        "text": "Actress Andrea Evans has died at the age of 66, casting director Don Carroll has revealed.\n\nThe star was best known for her role as Tina Lord in popular soap opera One Life To Live. She also starred as Patty Williams on CBS’ The Young and the Restless, before playing Tawny Moore on the same channel's The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nOther hit roles saw her star as Rebecca Hotchkiss on NBC’s Passions and Patty Walker on Amazon Prime’s The Bay.\n\nHer biggest role as Tina saw her play the part of the troublemaking teen until 1981. She later returned to the role in 1985. It was during this spell that she received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in 1988.\n\nIn 2008 and again in 2011 she returned to the show, saying at the time: \"It’s time to give the audience what they want. And it’s time for me to get closure on why I left in the first place.\"\n\nHer second Daytime Emmy nomination came in 2015 when she was recognised for her performance in the web series DeVanity.\n\nFans headed to social media following the news to share messages of condolences. Uploading a clip of the actress in The Bold and the Beautiful, one Twitter user penned: \"Tawny was such a hoot! RIP to the iconic Andrea Evans. #BoldandBeautiful\"\n\nA second shared in image of the star and wrote: \"Weirdly enough, #AndreaEvans randomly ran across my mind yesterday. Today, I read she passed away. So young. Loved her work. RIP. #TinaLord #OLTL\"\n\nAnd a third said: \"We have absolutely lost a daytime legend! Rest in the highest power Andrea Evans! #OneLifeToLive #Passions\"\n\nThe official Young And The Restless Twitter account also posted a throwback image alongside the caption: \"We have absolutely lost a daytime legend! Rest in the highest power Andrea Evans! #OneLifeToLive #Passions.\"\n\nAndrea is survived by husband Steve Rodriguez and daughter Kylie."
