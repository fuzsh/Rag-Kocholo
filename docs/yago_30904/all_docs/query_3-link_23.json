        "text": "Andrea Evans, the soap opera star who rose to fame in the 1970s as bad girl Tina Lord on ABC’s “One Life To Live,” has died. She was 66.\n\nEvans died Sunday of breast cancer at her Pasadena, California, home, her representatives confirmed to The Post on Monday.\n\n“I’ve been working with Andrea for the past seven years. She was such a tremendous talent and an absolute joy to work with,” her manager, Nick Leicht, told The Post.\n\nThe two-time Daytime Emmy-nominated actress went on to play Patty Williams on CBS’ “The Young and the Restless,” Tawny Moore on “The Bold and the Beautiful” and Rebecca Hotchkiss on NBC’s “Passions.”\n\nMost recently, Evans portrayed Patty Walker in 12 episodes of Amazon Prime’s drama series “The Bay” from 2017 to 2020.\n\nEvans abruptly left “One Life To Live” in 1990 after a stalker threatened her life.\n\n“All of a sudden, I went from a happy-go-lucky life to having regular conversations with the police,” she told the Associated Press, per ABC. “This was before people were that aware. There was a great disbelief that here this man was trying to harm me, and the police could do nothing about it.”\n\nThe stalker, a Russian man who cut his wrists on the “OLTL” studio steps and wrote death threats to Evans in blood, was not arrested because no stalking laws existed at the time and Evans was not physically harmed.\n\nHowever, she later claimed that “some good” came out of the experience.\n\n“I was able to help by publicizing it, to help get better stalking laws enforced. I think that’s another reason I was thrilled to be at ‘One Life To Live,’ to kind of bring the whole situation … full circle,” she explained\n\nIn 2008, Evans delighted fans by returning to “OLTL.”\n\n“No matter what show I went to, no matter what other work I did or even in my own personal life, people want me to come back to ‘One Life To Live,'” Evans told ABC News Radio. “And at some point, I had to honor their wishes.”\n\nIn April, Evans celebrated “The Young and the Restless” 50th anniversary on Instagram.\n\n“Took me a week to find this!” she captioned a photo of herself as her character. “Happy 50th anniversary to Y&R. So proud to have been a part of this show.”\n\nShe also has numerous primetime credits, including “Circus of the Stars” and “Hollywood Squares.”\n\nHer reps told The Post that Evans recently completed work on her forthcoming memoir, “My One Life To Live.”\n\nEvans is survived by her husband Steve, daughter Kylie, and her dog, Mila."
