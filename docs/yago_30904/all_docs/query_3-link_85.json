        "text": "One Life To Live was so much fun. I started watching it in my tweens. My favorite character was Wanda. Wanda and Vinnie were the couple I loved the most. She had this great New Yawk accent and a heart of gold. I moved to NY in 1975 and lived on the Upper West Side. My partner and I would see lots of famous people because ABC Studios was on 57th and Broadway. One day we were coming out of Zabar’s and she was right in front of us. My QUEEN! It beat seeing Lauren Bacall schlepping around Zabar’s wearing a polyester pantsuit and a look that said Leave Me The Fuck Alone. But I also loved Tina.\n\nThis hits me where I live. I watched AMC and OLTL as a wee gayling in their mid-late 80’s heyday. Tina was such an unforgettable character. You could tell how much the writers loved Tina. They gave her so many astonishing water cooler moments. Going over Iguazu Falls, passing off Gabrielle’s baby as her own, interrupting Cord and Kate’s wedding, blurting out the wrong name at her wedding to Max… she generated a ton of story and press for the show. She’s widely credited for the show being in the Nielsens Top 3 when Tina ruled. I’m so sad she died… and at 66! So young.\n\nWow....This one hurts. That was my soap in the mid to late 80's. I was obsessed. Tina and Gabrielle were EVERYTHING. Andrea, thanks for the memories.\n\nI can hear \"Tina's theme\" in my head right now.\n\nMy grandma and grandpa got me watching , and they loved Tina too.\n\nRobin Strasser left in 1987 and if memory serves, she was somewhat disgruntled when she left. I’m sure it was hard to see the show start to revolve around a younger vixen. I also remember at the height of Tina’s popularity, she was chosen to be the cover of the show’s 20th Anniversary on Soap Opera Digest (flanked by all her men). Erika Slezak gave a really snarky comment that Tina was “in no way a replacement for Dorian,” and she proceeded to extoll Dorian’s virtues over Tina’s. I’m sure there was lots of acrimony as Tina really sucked up a lot of oxygen. I will say toward the end of Evans’s tenure, she took a backseat to Gabrielle and the Gordon sisters. She seemed to fade a bit.\n\nR41 Hmmm seems Erika was a little jealous of Andrea Evans garnering so much attention. Ms. Slezak commented on her website btw, for those of you who don't care to look lol here's what she stated:\n\n\"I am absolutely shocked and devastated by this news and I send love and deepest sympathies to Steve and Kylie- they were her whole life. Andrea and I worked together for so long- on her first day at work, she was living 1 block away from me and I walked her to work. She was just a child- never been to NYC- so sweet and kind and loving- amazing that she played such a complicated, confused and selfish character so well. When she and Steve got married and then got Kylie, it seemed her life was finally complete. She was so happy. So very very sad.\"\n\nR47 I've always thought that too, certain writers after her heyday didn't seem to get her, towards Andrea's exit and during Karen and Krista's runs. I agree about Karen, I didn't warm up to her right away, yet she grew to become the second best Tina imo. Krista did try except it didn't really seem like she was ever playing Tina to me, although that could've been due to the writing as well. I remember ppl who saw her as Mindy on GL saying that it seemed like she was still playing Mindy. It was interesting to learn that both Janine Turner and Tonja Walker were up for Tina when Andrea exited in 1990, yet Paul Rauch ultimately gave Karen the role. Cali Timmins from AW almost played Tina somewhere in the 2000's until Frank Valentini nixed it.\n\nR55 You're right, Tina was somewhat softened during Karen's stint. They also didn't really write her as being in love with Cord, with the whole who's the daddy story with Johnny Dee Hesser and of course as you mentioned, Cain Rogan. They wrote Tina like she saw Cord as an afterthought for the most part or just the father of her children, waffling between Cain and Cord as if she really was in love with Cain only whole Cord was like an obligation. Even though Tina and Cain were slated to be \"the story,\" they didn't have to diminish her history with Cord in the process, having her seemingly not even affected by him returning from the dead. With Andrea's version, there was always this underlying true love she had for Cord, even when they were with other ppl\n\nYes- R65 go to her Instagram. Fiona is very British- she does not sit there and cry or anything she has a farmhouse that she and John V are remodeling.. and she mentions both deaths in her videos in a very matter of fact way,, She and Andrea were great friends when they were on the show.. She mentions it in video from yesterday.. She says that Bronwen was her best friend in the entire world.. They were very close. just some dark days...\n\nLet me try to link her instagram-\n\nHold on\n\nThanks so much R67/R68. IA Fiona has always had a matter-of-fact way of expressing herself; I've always liked her, as Gabrielle and as Jenna on GL. I remember she gave an interview to one of the soap mags awhile ago, and they asked her why were soaps on the decline. She stated that soaps were declining because they didn't modernize themselves and grow with the times, choosing instead to remain stagnant with their same formula that isn't exactly resonating with the modern world.\n\nI'm just gutted. When I first began watching it was during the Mitch storyline. Tina and Mitch were everything, lol. Gabriel and Max, and I think this was also when Blair was married to Asa and withheld his heart medication, lolol. I adored Tina and was so disappointed when she left the show. I didn't know she had to leave because of a stalker. How terrifying for her and how sad to have her life and career derailed by a POS like that. RIP, Andrea. You will always be my favorite soap opera diva, Queen.\n\nFiona was correct. I miss soaps. I wonder whether if they had evolved with the rest of television whether there would still be 10 today representing an art form that began in radio. I can't watch tw minutes of any surviving soap. Hutchison is right. It's the same stupid shit. There's not even the rare social issue story anymore. I saw a piece oh GH while staying at a hotel for work and there was a random revenge porn story but done for the Instagram world rather than for reason an old soap would explore.\n\nR75 Thanks no wonder you kept saying Father Tony lol I guess I forgot that she's married to Father Tony Vallone actor, John Viscardi. I barely remember his character lol he's very handsome and seems just as nice as her.\n\nWhat I do remember is James DePaiva being married to a woman I believe named Dreama Marie? Then he cheated on her by having an onset affair with Kassie Wesley, shortly after she started as Blair in 1993. Not too long after his marriage to Dreama Marie was over.\n\nR82 R86 R87 Since she's married to a multimillionaire poker player, she seems content and not really interested in acting. I know she had a brief stint on DOOL awhile back, however that was because of Ron requesting her to reprise her role.\n\nHonestly, I think JPL never came out because he still wants to have an acting career outside of soaps, so he's trying to avoid being labeled as a \"gay actor.\" The rumors have been around for years, even during his relationship with Farah.\n\nR84 We probably would've still had 10, even if they weren't all on network tv, if they wouldn't have remained the same, we'd still have them in some format. Proctor & Gamble wanted out of the soap business entirely, however they could've sold their soaps if another company were interested in buying them. There just weren't enough alternatives to network tv around the time CBS cancelled them. ABC was ahead of their time when they sold the rights to their shows to Prospect Park (who was ahead of their time themselves) although it was executed poorly. If they would've kept up with the times, they probably would've made it just a little while longer to transfer to streaming.\n\nThe audience changed and moved away from soaps and the business model could not sustain itself because it got too expensive. The #1 soap has maybe 5 different sets and looks incredibly cheap. Daytime soaps are not coming back. However, I would not be surprised if we didn't see the \"Peyton Place\" model show up in primetime in the very near future. This is where we have a serialized show that is shown 2 or 3 nights a week.\n\nR100 They keep retelling the same stories that were big in the 70s, 80s, 90s when the world was different, like they're stuck in a time warp. Coming back from the dead, evil long lost twins, triangles, trying to take over the world, countless kidnappings, larger than life super villains who outsmart everyone, etc. There was a time when you could get away with all that stuff, however the audiences are more sophisticated now, and alot aren't willing to suspend disbelief anymore, so they've stopped tuning in. They tell social stories here and there, however they seem to be very few and far between. Their job is to entertain, of course, however they could also be a source of enlightenment when they wanted to.\n\nIt's like they just watered everything down, even dumbed down to a certain extent. Even when they have cell phones on soaps they look very cheap, like they're behind in technology. I know they're working on a shorter budget, however it shouldn't have to seem so obvious onscreen. It's like they're going backwards, for in their heyday, the sets, wardrobes, acting, writing were, for the most part, extraordinary. Now it's like they don't even care.\n\nAlthough to their credit, Prospect Park did try to modernize OLTL, along with AMC. They still relied on old soaps tropes here and there, however they were somewhat more realistic than the network soaps back then. Being online gave them certain creative licenses that weren't afforded to the network soaps, so they had that going for them as well. Unfortunately, they were ahead of their time and they just couldn't keep up financially to maintain that model.\n\nR116, I think the perfect example is the buchanan sons on one life to live. Both were too boring to stay on the show much so the fire families waned and shows lose focus.\n\nIf Kevin Buchanans storyline had been that of Todd manning and if Joey buchanan had been swapped with Billy Douglas, there would have been more story potential.\n\nShows have been too afraid to take chances with core characters for too long which leads to repetitive boredom.\n\nHarding Lemay wrote in his memoir [italic] Eight Years in Another World [/italic] that he was all set to have Michael Randolph came out as gay and P&G axed it at the last minute after the actor had been cast and relocated.\n\nI used to think that it was only a small portion of homophobes who were secretly gay and that was their big issue. But now, I think it's most.\n\nEven in today's world. Guys are still afraid of what people will think, rejection from family. Elizabeth Smart's dad came out in his mid 60s and the only reason we know about it was because his daughter had once been kidnapped and it was all over the news.\n\nAll~ I highly suggest watching this tribute to Andrea- It is quite moving and heartwarming.\n\nAnd there is some real insights there. Fiona Hutchison is a gem of a human being.\n\nHowever- Miss Sleeztack....\n\nHoly shit. She has a very odd facial tick now which makes me sad. She had some lovely things to say about Andrea... But at the 30 minute mark on the dot, she says she needs to leave.... In the context of the memorial, it was REALLY weird and really cold.... She clearly offered 30 minutes of her time and that was all we were getting. Robert S Woods, Fiona, and John Loprieno were all absolutely lovely and stayed for 90 minutes and clearly enjoyed talking about this time of their lives. RSW looks good for an old man and wasn't really good talking about emotions, but he came across as very warm. And a certain fanboy and former headwriter showed up- I thought he seemed genuinely enthusiastic- but much more a fan than a writer. It was interesting.\n\nEterna was brought up, Argentina, Faux Bo, Gabrielle denouncing god, Paul Rauch--- and Fiona shares some really cool insights into her friendship with Andrea- it wasn't all roses- and she has a lovely story near the end about Andrea's funeral and what she learned..\n\nA really, really nice tribute - one of the best that I have seen.\n\nR128 Thank you so much for that post. I actually didn't think Erika S leaving was rude or abrasive and it felt like everyone else was sort of \"in\" on the exit beforehand.. The twitching indicates a medical issue. Maybe 30 minutes was a personal limitation for her? I love Erika Slezak (and Andrea E.). There were rumors years ago (unconfirmed) that BB was pursuing her for a short run as Bill Spencers (never seen) villainous mother. That would have been amazing.\n\nOh shit! Check out RSW's comment about Andrea dating \"someone\" after he returned and they all went to a concert because of it.\n\nSMOKEY ROBINSON- Not a doubt in my mind. So this was 88-89, which is exactly when I remember reading a tabloid about it\n\nSorry I forget where in the tribute it was...\n\nI especially loved how honest Fiona was about her friendship with Andrea- You can tell that Andrea was far more larger than life and a 'star\" in her younger years whereas Fiona was more down to earth. It was lovely hearing such honesty..\n\nI loved Barbara Luna's letter, James DPV's letter, and that beautiful letter from the journalist.\n\nAnd then Andrea's daughter's eulogy being discussed, and Fiona choking up.\n\nI hope everyone watches this-"
