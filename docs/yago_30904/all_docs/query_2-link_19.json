        "text": "Erika Slezak (Viki, One Life to Live)\n\n“I send love and deepest sympathies to [Andrea’s husband and daughter] Steve and Kylie — they were her whole life,” wrote the Emmy winner who played Tina’s surprise half sister. “Andrea and I worked together for so long. On her first day at work, she was living one block away from me, and I walked her to work. She was just a child — never been to NYC — so sweet and kind and loving. Amazing that she played such a complicated, confused and selfish character so well. When she and Steve got married and then got Kylie, it seemed her life was finally complete. She was so happy. So very, very sad.”\n\nJohn Loprieno (Cord, One Life to Live)\n\n“Working with Andrea Evans was one of the highlights of my acting career,” the actress’ longtime leading man told People. “From the day that she first welcomed me to the set of One Life to Live, through the final reunion episodes that we shot when the show was ending, Andrea continued to be a generous, blissfully comedic and insightful scene partner… I think my finest memory of performing with Andrea was not standing in our bathing suits in the Iguazu Falls in Brazil but working on the Banner newspaper office set on rolling chairs in a playfully choreographed love scene… It was one of my earliest appearances on the show. The magic in the room was palpable, and it offered promises of the great fun that was to be created and enjoyed in the years that followed. We will all miss Andrea and her mischievous looks toward [the] camera at the end of the scene.”\n\nNancy Lee Grahn (Alexis, General Hospital)\n\n“I’m so sorry to hear about Andrea Evans. Kim Zimmer (Reva, Guiding Light), Andrea and I came to NYC via Chicago per ABC Daytime Television back in the day together,” explained the Emmy winner. Grahn would get her soap start on One Life to Live as Beverly Wilkes, Zimmer played Echo DiSavoy, and Evans… Tina, obviously. “Lovely woman. Donated to Cancer Foundation today. We’ve got to fund the hell out these orgs so they can kill cancer and not our friends.”\n\nMichael Damian (ex-Danny, Young & Restless)\n\n“I’m so very sad to hear the news of my castmate Andrea’s passing. It was so wonderful having had the chance to work with her in the beginning of my career on Young & Restless! She was always so very kind and professional. God bless you, and I will keep you in my prayers always.”\n\nKate Linder (Esther, Young & Restless)\n\n“I have had the honor of knowing and working with Andrea Evans for many years. Besides being incredibly talented, she was very kind and giving. I can still see the smile on her face every time we would run into each other. My heart goes out to her family and friends. I so miss her already.”\n\nPamela Donnelly (Clover, One Life to Live)\n\n“Andrea Evans was a beautiful friend of mine in the ’80s. We were on One Life to Live together,” Instagrammed the actress, who was also Shelley on The Edge of Night. “She always made me feel heard and like I belonged in the acting community. She was just a good friend.” And the two of them shared some great times — like the one Donnelly described that found Tootsie star Dustin Hoffman recognizing Evans at a Mexican restaurant and sending the two of them margaritas!\n\nEric Martsolf (Brady, Days of Our Lives)\n\n“We lost Andrea Evans. She was wildly responsible for showing me that working in daytime doesn’t have to feel like work at all,” Facebooked the actor, who was Ethan on Passions. “I will miss the sparkle in her eyes when she smiled, which was seemingly all the time. Rest in peace, Andrea, and thank you for all you gave.”\n\nRon Carlivati (Headwriter, Days of Our Lives)\n\n“I am absolutely heartbroken to learn of the untimely passing of Andrea Evans, who played the iconic Tina Lord Roberts on One Life to Live and is one of the reasons I fell in love with soap operas in the first place,” Instagrammed Carlivati, once the ABC soap’s top scribe. “Andrea brought such a sense of guilelessness and fun to a selfish and scheming character and made you fall in love with her. After watching her as a fan for many years, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to write for her, and it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my professional career. I will treasure the memories of Tina trying to misappropriate the Crown Jewels of Mendorra with her beloved dog David Vickers under her arm. She survived a trip over the Iguazu Falls and made her way back to Llanview to crash Cord’s wedding to Kate Sanders with a stolen baby in her arms, and that’s how I will always remember both the character and the actress: resilient and resourceful, but also so warm and kind. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. Rest in peace, dear Andrea.”\n\nStephen Rodriguez\n\n“Andrea was a remarkable individual, cherished by all who knew her,” observed her husband. “Her unwavering strength, positivity and indomitable spirit inspired us every step of the way throughout her fearless fight against this relentless disease. She faced the challenges with grace, resilience and an enduring love for life. Andrea and I spent 30+ years together. She was a great wife and mother. She was my rock. Cancer killed Andrea, but it did not kill her spirit. That spirit is alive and well and lives on in each one of us, whom she touched.”"
