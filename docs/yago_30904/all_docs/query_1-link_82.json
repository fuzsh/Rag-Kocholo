        "text": "2 December 2021\n\nAmerican Oscar-winning screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola discusses her Life Cinematic with Edith Bowman. Read on to discover which contemporary cult classics and vintage Hollywood greats the Lost in Translation director has picked as perfect movie moments.\n\nThe famous closing scene from Coppola's Lost in Translation, with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson\n\nLife Cinematic with Sofia Coppola\n\nWatch Sofia Coppola talking movies with Edith Bowman on BBC iPlayer until 2 January 2022.\n\nLife Cinematic with Sofia Coppola\n\n10 Perfect Movie Scenes selected by Sofia Coppola\n\nPerfect Performance - Nicole Kidman in To Die For (1995)\n\nNicole Kidman convinces a young Joaquin Phoenix to go along with her plans in To Die For (1995) | Columbia Pictures / Laura Ziskin Productions / The Rank Organization / Directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nNicole Kidman is just one of the most incredible actors… the way she inhabits the character, it’s one of my favourite performances.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. from her native Australia, and feeling “shocked at how few complicated roles there were for women”, Nicole Kidman fought hard for the role of the seductively villainous Suzanne Stone, an aspiring TV news reporter who will stop at nothing to fulfil her ambitions. Kidman convinced director Gus Van Sant to cast her, and her multi-layered performance earned a Golden Globe.\n\nVan Sant said, “I’d seen Nicole in Dead Calm...and the movies she’d done with Tom Cruise. None really indicated that she was right for this movie. But she was so excited and forthright… She said she was destined to play this part. I thought, ‘If she’s this into it, she’ll probably do a really good job.”\n\nJimmy (Joaquin Phoenix) is transfixed by Nicole Kidman's character Suzanne Stone in To Die For.\n\nRepressed Emotion - Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (1945)\n\nInner turmoil: Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) and Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) in Brief Encounter (1945), which was based on Noel Coward's 1936 play Still Life | A Noel Coward - Cineguild Production / Directed by David Lean.\n\nA big inspiration when I was writing Lost In Translation. Very little is said, and you feel so much in just a gesture or a pause. Everything is under the surface... very English.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nIn David Lean’s 1945 masterclass in restraint and repressed emotion, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) are married to other people but develop an intense relationship after a chance meeting.\n\nThis scene, in the refreshment room of the local train station, takes place early on in the film and is returned to near the end, after the couple’s story has been revealed to the audience.\n\nThe dialogue throughout the scene - largely the inconsequential chatter of the uninvited casual acquaintance - cannot distract from the intensity of the non-verbal emotion that is playing out as the couple’s feelings are revealed through gestures and facial expressions.\n\nAlex discreetly squeezes Laura on the shoulder and leaves for the final time.\n\nMoment of Realisation - Wong Kar-wai's In The Mood For Love (2000)\n\nSu Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) in the restaurant scene where reality dawns in Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love (2000) | Block 2 Pictures / Jet Tone Production / Orly Films / Paradis Films / Directed by Wong Kar-wai.\n\nIn the restaurant, where they start to figure out what’s going on with their spouses, it’s revealed in little doses and it starts to all come together.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nWong Kar-wai’s masterpiece is a story of betrayal, longing and unrequited love set in a socially conservative, early 1960s Hong Kong.\n\nAfter numerous casual interactions, and with both of them silently suspecting their respective spouses of infidelity, neighbours Su (Maggie Cheung) and Chow (Tony Leung) meet at a restaurant. Tentatively they ask seemingly innocent questions, slowly revealing the heartbreaking information that confirms the other's suspicions.\n\nThe sudden and unusual camera movements in this scene act as visual double-takes, demanding our attention and signposting these dramatic yet calm moments of realisation.\n\nSofia thanked Wong Kar-wai in her 2004 Academy Award acceptance speech (for Lost In Translation), citing him as an inspiration while writing her script.\n\nChow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) in the restaurant scene.\n\nOutsider Character - Montgomery Clift in A Place In The Sun (1951)\n\nGeorge Eastman (Montgomery Clift) sets out for a better life in A Place in the Sun (1951) | Paramount Pictures / Directed by George Stevens.\n\nI love this moment - him coming in and this is not his world. Nobody greets him, he’s such a fish out of water, your heart goes to him.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nA dark take on the American dream, and a film that Charlie Chaplin once called “the greatest movie ever made about America”.\n\nGeorge Stevens’ Hollywood classic follows working-class George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) as he slowly climbs the corporate ladder, striving to be accepted into the world of socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor).\n\nThis scene drips with visual signifiers of Eastman’s outsider status - at the party he is the only person to arrive without a hat; he wears a tie instead of a bow tie; his fellow guests appear to wave at him but their greetings are directed at people out of shot; the camera remains passive and objective as he enters the party, depicting him as a small, insignificant figure in wide shot.\n\nOutsider in: Eastman (Montgomery Clift) at the party where he meets beautiful socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) in A Place in the Sun.\n\nPerfect Casting - Katie Jarvis and Michael Fassbender in Fish Tank (2009)\n\nKatie Jarvis as Mia in Fish Tank (2009) | BBC Films / Directed by Andrea Arnold.\n\nYou don’t feel like you’re watching actors, you are just in this world with these real people.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nFor Andrea Arnold’s Bafta-winning second feature, Katie Jarvis was street-cast to play teenager Mia after being spotted arguing with her boyfriend at a train station.\n\nWith the script written from Mia’s point of view and with cinematographer Robbie Ryan’s self-operated camera following her through every scene, Jarvis’s natural, authentic performance provides a powerful sense of realism.\n\nArnold believes the casting of her, as a newcomer alongside a more experienced Michael Fassbender, had a tangible effect - “When Katie behaves very naturally, that kind of influences everyone around her. And I think Katie learned loads off of Michael. He was really great with her.”\n\nKatie Jarvis as Mia with Conor (Michael Fassbender) in Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank.\n\nSound Design - Antonioni's La Notte (1961)\n\nLidia (Jeanne Moreau) and Roberto (Giorgio Negro) in Antonioni's La Notte (1961) | Nepi Film / Sofitedip / Silver Films / Directed by Michelangelo Antonioni.\n\nThe whole scene happens without the dialogue - we're outside in the rain and only see the whole scene, yet we know exactly what's going on… Two people talking would have been less interesting.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nDepicting a day in the life of an unhappily married couple and their steadily deteriorating relationship, La Notte is the centrepiece of what was dubbed Michelangelo Antonioni’s “trilogy of alienation”.\n\nIn a film which explores the inability to communicate, Antonioni’s decisions regarding sound in this scene are bold, with him choosing not to allow us to hear Lidia (Jeanne Moreau) communicating enthusiastically with a man she just met at a party.\n\nEmphasising the audience's role as a spectator, we do not hear the conversation of these characters as we would conventionally expect to... instead we only hear the rain on the outside of the car.\n\nIt’s an example of Antonioni’s attempt to tie cinema “to the truth rather than to logic”. Sofia uses a similar technique of keeping communication private in Lost In Translation, when we don’t hear what Bob (Bill Murray) whispers to Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the end of the film.\n\nFilling in conversation: Antonioni's La Notte.\n\nBonus Clip: Lost in Translation's ending\n\nSofia Coppola explains Lost in Translation's ending\n\nThe director describes the much-debated scene between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nSet Design - Todd Haynes' Safe (1995)\n\nJulianne Moore as Carol White, and Xander Berkeley as her husband Greg, on opposite sides in their perfectly designed suburban bedroom in Safe (1995) | Chemical Films / Good Machine / Kardana Productions / Channel 4 Films / Arnold Semler / American Playhouse Theatrical Films / Killer Films / Directed by Todd Haynes.\n\nShe's in her suburban world and you really feel like she’s like an alien, she’s not connected to it. Too perfect and weird.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nCarol White (Julianne Moore) is an affluent Los Angeles housewife whose monotonous life changes when she starts to suffer from a mysterious, debilitating illness.\n\nDirector Todd Haynes has said the films of Stanley Kubrick inspired Safe’s set design, in particular 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nHaynes wanted to give Carol’s environment the feeling of space and “recycled air… the natural being completely and totally removed from human existence.”\n\nBefore production starts on his films, Haynes compiles and circulates a lookbook of images to his team to communicate his visual intentions. Sofia employs a similar approach for her own films.\n\nCharlotte Moore's character decides it is time for a perm in Safe.\n\nCharacter Introduction - Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946)\n\nRita Hayworth on her way to superstardom in the 1946 film noir Gilda | Columbia Pictures Corporation / Directed by Charles Vidor.\n\nShe makes a big entrance because she’s Gilda, she enters the frame in this show-stopping way. It says so much about her.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nIn the film that propelled her into superstardom, Rita Hayworth makes an unconventional and truly unforgettable entrance as Gilda, the new wife of casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready), who clearly has history with Mundson’s new employee Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford).\n\nDirector Charles Vidor and cinematographer Rudolph Maté had both collaborated with Hayworth previously, and their knowledge and experience of working with her, combined with Hayworth’s on-screen presence, result in a perfectly conceived, skillfully framed and flawlessly executed entrance into the frame.\n\nThe impact of Gilda exploding upwards to fill the empty frame and bring it to life mirrors Hayworth’s explosion into popular culture, with references to her in films that span decades, including The Bicycle Thieves, The Shawshank Redemption and Mulholland Drive.\n\n\"Gilda, are you decent?\": Rita Hayworth's Gilda recognises Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) from her past.\n\nPerfect Kiss - Tina (Rosie Perez) and Mookie (Spike Lee) in Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nTina (Rosie Perez) and Mookie (Spike Lee) in Do the Right Thing (1989) | 40 Acres and A Mule Filmworks / Universal City Studios / Directed by Spike Lee\n\nI love that it’s not a device. It's not anywhere else in the movie. It's just this one moment and it makes the kiss so much more.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nSpike Lee’s 1989 classic takes place on a swelteringly hot day that sees racial tensions in Brooklyn reaching boiling point. Sofia describes this scene - which takes place slightly away from the main events of the film - as a ‘candy moment’; a playful pop-up occurrence in a film that happens once but doesn’t become a device.\n\nMookie (Spike Lee) delivers a pizza to his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez, in her first feature film) and, breaking a moment of mild confrontation, the couple kiss. Lee’s use of a repeat cut here is an unexpected visual tool that gives this intimate moment heightened impact and emphasis.\n\nSpeaking of the feeling of heat which is essential to the plot of the film, Spike Lee has said - “I wanted people to be sweating from watching this film... Everybody used their skills to convey that feeling of heat.” In this kiss scene, we see the enlarged silhouette of an electric fan behind Tina when she opens her door, she tells Mookie that it is too hot to have sex, there is an enormous Japanese style folding fan on the wall. There are constant, unmissable visual reminders of the need to cool down.\n\nMood change: The end of a hot day and tension is at boiling point in Do the Right Thing.\n\nPower Dynamic - Dirk Bogarde and James Fox in The Servant (1963)\n\nClass act: Dirk Bogarde as Hugo and James Fox as Tony in The Servant (1963) | Springbok Productions / Directed by Joseph Losey\n\nDirk Bogarde is so good. Twisted, and funny, in a way that only Harold Pinter can be. His humour is so specific and embodies that power dynamic.\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nAfter spoiled young aristocrat Tony (James Fox) hires manservant Barrett (Dirk Bogarde) to look after him in his new Chelsea townhouse, the balance of power between the men begins to gradually shift.\n\nAs an American, director Joseph Losey was well-placed to provide a detached and dispassionate view of the British class system, and this film - adapted by playwright Harold Pinter from a novella by Robin Maugham - marked the first of three Pinter-Losey collaborations exploring class in Britain.\n\nThis particular scene marks a turning point in the film, with a child-like ball game acting as an explicit metaphor for the characters’ central conflict: “I’m in the inferior position”; “You’re sitting in the best position”.\n\nThe initial shot of Tony at the top of the stairs looking down on Barrett has been reversed by the end of the scene, with Barrett now peering down on Tony, demanding he fetch him a brandy.\n\nJoseph Losey's The Servant (1963), with screenplay by Harold Pinter.\n\nLife Cinematic: Filmmakers select their greatest movie moments\n\nSam Mendes\n\nOscar-winning director Sam Mendes selects his 10 best film moments including the perfect shot.\n\nSam Mendes\n\nEdgar Wright\n\nEdgar Wright champions his favourite films in categories ranging from the Needle Drop to the Perfect Tension Build.\n\nEdgar Wright\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\n\nFilm-maker Sam Taylor-Johnson, director of Nowhere Boy and A Million Little Pieces, selects her favourite film moments.\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson\n\nSophia Coppola\n\nContemporary cult classics and vintage Hollywood greats picked by the Lost in Translation director.\n\nSophia Coppola\n\nInside Cinema on BBC iPlayer: Short Films For Movie Fans\n\nRoll Credits\n\nThis is the end, or is it?
