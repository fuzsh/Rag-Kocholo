        "text": "Andrea Evans, best-known for playing Tina Lord in the US soap opera One Life to Live, has died aged 66.\n\nThe late actress was diagnosed with cancer prior to her death.\n\nHaving risen to fame on daytime TV in the 1970s and 1980s, some of her most widely-recognised roles included appearing as Patti Weaver in The Young and the Restless, Rebecca Hotchkiss in Passions and Tawny Moore in The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nShe was twice nominated for Daytime Emmy Awards, having received a nod in 1988 for ‘outstanding ingenue’ for her performance in One Life to Live.\n\nHer death was announced by casting director Don Carroll, Deadline reported.\n\nIn January last year, Evans shared a post on Instagram celebrating her friendship with Carroll, sharing a photo of them together while writing in the caption: ‘It is rare that you work with someone and then also develop a true friendship. So lucky to have this with Don Carroll❤️.’\n\nBorn in Aurora, Illinois in 1957, Evans appeared in beauty pageants, regional theatre and commercials as a child.\n\nAfter graduating early from high school, Evans attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nDuring her time at the university, she was cast in a couple of acting projects – as an extra in the film The Fury and in the mini-series The Awakening Land – before landing her role in One Life to Live.\n\nEvans portrayed Tina Lord in the soap initially from 1978 to 1981, before returning from 1985 to 1990.\n\nShe later made appearances as the character in 2008 and 2011.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Evans was married to Wayne Massey, who played her One Life to Live character’s love interest Johnny Drummond.\n\nThe former couple were married from 1981 to 1983, before she wed attorney Steve Rodriguez in 1998.\n\nEvans and Rodriguez adopted a daughter called Kylie in 2004, who celebrated her 18th birthday last year.\n\nThe late actress marked the milestone with her daughter by getting matching tattoos, writing on Instagram at the time: ‘KAi and I got matching tattos for her 18th birthday! If you look closely mine has a k, hers has an a. Love my girl sooo much❤️. #alltattedup. #love.’\n\nMORE : Jeffrey Carlson, who played groundbreaking trans character on All My Children, dies aged 48\n\nMORE : Journey’s original guitarist George Tickner dies aged 76"
