        "text": "There has been widespread concern about Andrea Evans’ marriage and personal life following her death at the age of 66. In the video below, learn everything there is to know about the late artist’s marriage. Andrea Evans is an accomplished actress.\n\nIt is stated that she died on July 9, 2023, after battling breast cancer. From 1978 to 2011, she was most recognized for her roles in soap operas, most notably as Tina Lord on One Life to Live. She has also been on The Bold and the Beautiful, The Young and the Restless, Passions, and DeVanity. The two-time Daytime Emmy Award nominee had a brilliant career in show business. After her death, many people search for information about her and her husband’s marriage. Everything we know about it is in this section.\n\nAndrea Evans’ husband: Steve Rodríguez.\n\nAndrea Evans was married to Steve Rodriguez at the time of her death. They had been married for over two decades and had raised a wonderful family. According to sources, Andrea Evans’ husband, Steve Rodriguez, is a lawyer living in Los Angeles. Other than that, little is known about the soap star’s husband, such as his family history or his school background.\n\nIn any case, Steve and Andrea enjoyed a pleasant family life. Their marriage was based on mutual support and deep devotion. Although it is unknown how they met, it had to be an extraordinary meeting.\n\nFurthermore, the Evans-Rodríguez couple married in 1998. They were together from then until the actress died. Even though the marriage’s time on Earth was cut short, they must have had a wonderful time together. Plus, Steve and Andrea must have had a lot of memories.\n\nMeet Andrea Evans’ ex-husband Wayne Massey and find out about their relationship\n\nMany of Andrea Evans’ fans probably know that she has been married twice. “The Bold and the Beautiful” actress married Wayne Massey, an American country music singer and actor, in her first marriage. The former couple co-starred in the ABC soap opera series “One Life to Live.”\n\nThe former couple seems to have crossed paths due to their work circle. The late soap opera actress was married to a musician from 1981 to 1983. The series ran for more than four decades and the actress received international recognition for her role. Andrea, on the other hand, was forced to leave serial opera because of a stalker.\n\nThe musician and actress did not have children during their brief marriage. There is not much information available about Andrea and Wayne’s divorce. Evans’ ex-husband, on the other hand, married fellow country music star Charly McClain a year after her divorce in July 1984.\n\nHow many children does Andrea Evans have? Kylie, his adopted daughter\n\nAndrea Evans was a confident single mother. Kylie is the daughter of The Young and the Restless actress and her second husband, Steve Rodriguez. The daughter of the Evans-Rodríguez couple turns 19 in 2023. Kylie leads a private life away from the spotlight. While little is known about the late celebrity’s son, she must lead a quiet life away from the spotlight."
