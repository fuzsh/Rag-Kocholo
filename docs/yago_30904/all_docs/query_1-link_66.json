        "text": "The second season of SOAPnet's General Hospital: Night Shift accomplished the unimaginable. For 13 weeks, GH's cable spin off told powerful, multi-generational tales of love, hope and mortality, all primarily set in the soap's historic hospital. The series was truly a Valentine to long term fans of GH and beautifully explained to newer fans why iconic veterans like Tristan Rogers (Robert), Finola Hughes (Anna) and Antonio Sabato Jr. (Jagger) are so beloved. While making GH: Night Shift a success was a collaborative effort, it was one novice soap opera writing's vision of telling stories featuring the characters he grew up loving, as well as introducing an Indian doctor and telling a gay love story, that set Night Shift apart. That writer was Sri Rao.\n\nOn today's episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast Luke and Jamey have a conversation with Rao, A Wharton Business School graduate who gave up his high-powered career in Manhattan, to follow his true passion for being a writer and director. Rao offers a refreshingly unjaded perspective about everything from the use of veterans in daytime to the politics behind gay storytelling.\n\nRao shares the process he and his writing team embarked upon in giving larger-than-life superhero Robert Scorpio an all-too-real Achilles Heel in the form of cancer. He reveals how supportive ABC Daytime/SOAPnet head honcho Brian Frons was in allowing him the freedom to tell his stories and talks about the other projects his Sri Rao and Company are working on, including a teen drama series inspired by his boyhood love for My So Called Life called What Goes On and the Bollywood thriller New York. Rao also answers the question fans of Night Shift are dying to know: Would he ever consider bringing his passion and prowess over to daytime?\n\nDirect download: DC_354.mp3\n\nCategory:podcasts -- posted at: 10:16am CDT\n\nOn today's Daytime Confidential Performer of the Week episode find out who which actors and actresses Luke, Mike, Jamey and Jillian choose as their Performer of the Week.\n\nListen as they discuss their honorable and dishonorable mentions. Find out who Jamey believes needs to needs be taught how to act by Susan Flannery and Katherine Kelly Lang.\n\nDirect download: DC_353_POW.mp3\n\nCategory:podcasts -- posted at: 3:37pm CDT\n\nOne Life to Live writer Chris Van Etten, famed YA novelist/editor David Levithan and SOAPnet blogger David Ozanich join Luke and Jamey on today's Daytime Confidential podcast to dish about their fun Likely Story series of teen books. Written under the joint pen name David Van Etten, Likely Story and its sequels All That Glitters and Red Carpet Riot (on sale July 9, 2009) tell the story of Mallory, just your typical teenage girl living in SoCal–except that her mother is an over-the-top soap opera diva and she's caught up in a hot love quadrangle with a teen soap hunk. After an explosive confrontation with the aforementioned diva (Mal's mom is so fab, her name is never mentioned!), Mallory blogs about how ridiculous and unbelievable the soap opera her mother stars on can be. Mal writes about how if she had the chance to write a soap, it would be realistic and find its drama in real life situations, in other words a likely story. Imagine Mal's surprise when the network gets wind of the blog post and decides to cancel their long-running daytime drama and greenlights a new teen soap based on Mallory's premise! Did we mention the soap the network cancels is the one Mal's Mommy Dreariest stars on?\n\nYou'll want to tune in to hear Van Etten, Levithan and Ozanich talk about how the Likely Story book series came into being. Learn how OLTL ultimately facilitated Van Etten and Ozanich becoming writing partners when the soap hired Ozanich an intern. Find out how at a Gotham party one night, Levithan, author of such teen classics as Boy Meets Boy and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (with Rachel Cohn) and editor of the smash hit The Babysitters' Club novel series for Scholastic, became intrigued by the idea of helping the pair bring Mallory's story to life.\n\nYou'll learn what it's like to write a book series with not one, or two authors, but three. Van Etten and Ozanich, while swearing none of the characters are based on anyone they've met in their soapy pursuits (Talk about a likely story!), reveal how their day jobs did in fact help color Mallory's world. Is Mallory speaking for every disgruntled soap opera fan with the impassioned rant she posts on her blog? What about when she actually lands her dream job? As Mallory quickly finds out writing a daily soap opera, while dealing with temperamental divas, a reluctant hottie leading man and network interference, isn't as easy as she once believed, are we getting a glimpse of what it's really like for the harried men and women who bring us our favorite soaps five-days-a-week? What about Van Etten, do he and other real life soap scribes ever log on to blogs like DC or message boards to read what we're saying about their work? If so how does it effect the writing process?\n\nOzanich, also an acclaimed playwright (The Lightening Field) shares how he's dealt with some of the sticky situations Mallory finds herself facing in the Likely Story books, such as having to let down friends who thought they were a shoe-in for a role in one of his dramatic works. Onzanich also runs hilarious, SNL-worthy interference for his pal Van Etten, when Jamey and Luke try to pry a few juicy spoilers about ABC Daytime's hottest soap out of the Emmy-winning breakdown writer.\n\nLevithan, an admitted novice to the wonderful and wacky world of daytime soap operas, talks about how he brought to the table the basic tenets of characterization and story to help make even Mallory's more larger-than-life adventures ring true. The editor for Scholastic's PUSH imprint shares how the coming of age tale, despite its soapy flavor, is quite universal. Levithan also tells us how he feels about the success of the big screen adaptation of Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, and gives other writers a bit of advice on how to make their books readily adaptable for film. Speaking of adapting literary works for the screen, could a Likely Story television series or film project be in the works? Tune in to find out. Then go to Amazon.com to purchase the Must Read Likely Story and All That Glitters. You can also pre-order Red Carpet Riot.\n\nDirect download: DC_352.mp3\n\nCategory:podcasts -- posted at: 9:38am CDT\n\nHold on to your soap dishes! On this very special episode of the Daytime Confidential podcast we discuss the winners of the 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Awards. Luke and Jamey are on hand to announce the categories, while TV Guide Canada's Nelson Branco reveals the winners, as well as the science behind why each was chosen. As if this wasn't reason enough to tune in, for the first time in DC history, both of the driving forces behind our favorite web series Imaginary Bitches, Eden Riegel (Bianca, All My Children) and her husband, series creator Andrew Miller are here together. You don't wanna miss the explosive confrontation between Emmy-winner Eden and Jamey when it's announced who wins the SOS for Outstanding Performer in a Podcast/Webisode/Soap-Related Series. There's nothing imaginary about it, these two get down right bitchy!\n\n\"What did she do beside talk to herself?\" Jamey asks in a huff.\n\n\"Thank you Jamey for sucking just enough for me to squeeze through!\" Eden blasts back.\n\nAndrew shares how many takes it took for his pal Greg Rikaart (Kevin, The Young and the Restless) to get the memorable m asturbation scene for his SOS-nominated IB guest stint down pat. Is Greg a method actor?\n\nEden is thrilled when two of her leading ladies, Elizabeth Hendrickson (ex-Frankie/Maggie, AMC; Chloe; Y&R; Liz, IB) and Tamara Braun, aka Jamey's pick for the best Carly Corinthos EVER!! (Oh yeah, and she now plays Reese on AMC) are both presented SOS awards, but which one thrills Eden more? Should Andrew be worried? More important, should BAM fans spearhead a Rianca Kiss Ban?\n\nLater in the episode, Eden speaks poignantly about All My Children and One Life to Live creator Agnes Nixon when she accepts the Irna Phillips Spirit Award For Outstanding Contribution To The Serial Art Form on behalf of the television legend. She also relays fond memories of the late Eileen Herlie, whose Myrtle Fairgate served as a surrogate grandmother to Binks and the rest of Pine Valley—except for Luke's beloved Greenlee (Rebecca Budig).\n\nNelson himself speaks on behalf of the late Beverlee McKinsey (Iris, Another World/Texas; Alexandra, Guiding Light) whom TVG Canada awarded one of two Douglas Marland Memorial Awards. The other accolade went to the late James E. Reilly (legendary head writer of Days of Our Lives and creator of Passions). Canada's biggest cheerleader (Yeah, yeah, yeah we get it, their syrup is better than ours and they produced Jennifer Finigan, big whoop! We lay claim to Britney Spears bitches... real and imagined!) asks Jamey to talk about the prolific writer's impact on the genre. This episode is a Must-Hear for soap fans young and old.\n\nDirect download: DC_351.mp3\n\nCategory:podcasts -- posted at: 9:49am CDT\n\nOn today's CBS and Days of Our Lives episode of Daytime Confidential Luke, Mike, Jamey and Melodie discuss the latest in As the World Turns, The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, Guiding Light and The Young and the Restless news and topics including...\n\nA new day has dawned for Luke and Noah on As the World Turns after they finally had sex.

Rogers shares how seeing his former penthouse recreated on Night Shift was spooky and how it brought back so many memories for him and Finola Hughes.
