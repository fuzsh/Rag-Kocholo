        "text": "In a lavish ceremony fit for a soap princess, Days of Our Lives beauty Tamara\n\nClatterbuck married her wealthy fiance Alexander Farkas.\n\nThe pair tied the knot at the beautiful oceanfront Stony Creek, Conn., estate\n\nof his mother, Francine Farkas-Sears, whose fortune comes from the Alexander's\n\ndepartment store chain.\n\n\"Alexander comes from such a rich family that it was a truly high-society\n\naffair,\" an insider reveals. \"His mom and Tamara spared no expense and the\n\nwedding cost them six figures.\"\n\nThe actress, who plays Barb on the NBC soap, looked stunning in an elegant\n\n$7,500 white silk organza, v-necked sheath gown from Yumi Katsura Bridal in New\n\nYork.\n\nHer groom, who works in the computer industry, was dapper in a black suit,\n\nwhite shirt and silver tie.\n\nThe couple said their vows Sept. 8 before a justice of the peace. In keeping\n\nwith Alexander's heritage, the ceremony ended with him crushing a glass under\n\nhis foot, a symbolic gesture performed at Jewish weddings, a guest confides to\n\nStar.\n\nAfter the ceremony, 150 guests, including Tamara's pal Sharon Case from Y&R,\n\ndined under tents on the beach. They enjoyed Cristal champagne, sushi, a New\n\nEngland clambake, fresh fruit, grilled vegetables and a chocolate wedding cake.\n\nTamara, 38, and Alexander, who met at a Santa Monica, Calif., nightclub two\n\nyears ago, shared a first dance to Joe Cocker's song You Are So Beautiful.\n\nThen the rest of the guests boogied the night away to pop tunes from a disc\n\njockey.\n\n\"The couple spent their honeymoon in the British Virgin Islands,\" the guest\n\nreveals. \"It's the happiest time of Tamara's life.\"\n\nsource: Star 10/9/01"
