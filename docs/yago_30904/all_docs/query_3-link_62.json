        "text": "Andrea Evans, the veteran daytime drama television star best known for playing troubled teenager Tina Lord on ABC’s One Life To Live, died Sunday in Pasadena, California from breast cancer. She was 66.\n\n\"Andrea kept a close circle of friends and if you were in her orbit she treated you like family,\" said Evans’ former manager Don Carroll in a statement. \"People often think she must be very like the characters she played on television. In reality, her greatest days were spent with no makeup, her hair in pigtails, and a ballcap on her head at Disneyland with her daughter Kylie.\"\n\nBorn on June 18, 1957, in Aurora, Illinois, Evans made her onscreen debut as an extra in the 1978 Brian De Palma film The Fury and the same year in the TV miniseries The Awakening Land.\n\nIn 1979, Evans made her debut in One Life To Live in 1985, and three years later, was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Ingenue. In between, she appeared as Patty Williams on The Young and the Restless from 1983-84.\n\nIn January 1990, Evans left One Life to Live and dropped out of the public eye after an encounter with a stalker.\n\nEvans appeared in two feature films during the 1990s: A Low Down Dirty Shame in 1994 and Ice Cream Man in 1995. In 1999, she returned to daytime as Tawny Moore in The Bold and the Beautiful for one initial season before segueing to Passions in 2000 for eight seasons as Rebecca Hotchkiss. In 2010, she reprised her role on The Bold and the Beautiful for one additional season.\n\nEvans’ second Daytime Emmy Award nomination came in 2015 for her performance in the web series DeVanity.\n\nHer primetime resume included guest appearances on dramas CHiPs and Capital News, and in the 2020 TV movie Joy & Hope. Evans also had a recurring role on the web drama The Bay from 2017-2020.\n\nEvans is survived by her husband, Stephen Rodriguez, and their daughter, Kylie."
