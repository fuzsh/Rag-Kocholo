LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York, where she studied opera and jazz and joined a gospel choir. “There was never a moment when I didn’t sing, when I didn’t dance, because there was always music in the house or in the street. We heard Johnny Pacheco, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, and Machito. And when the elders weren’t listening to music, My ears took everything from ABBA to Led Zeppelin, Glenn Campbell and Nat King Cole.” (source: official website ) After four years of study, however, she slammed the door of her school: “To say that my parents were not delighted would be a big understatement. I was ready to fly or fall. It was the only way for me to know if I had what it took to succeed in life in this world. Fortunately, everything worked out pretty well.” (source: official website ) But before hitting the small screen Gina Torres made her debut on the stage.
