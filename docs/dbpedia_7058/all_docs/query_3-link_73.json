        "text": "When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.\n\nOver the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.\n\n“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.\n\nA look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:\n\nRita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.\n\nThe multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.\n\nDuring the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.\n\nHaving participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nGina Torres, 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.\n\nBut her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”\n\nSince the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”\n\nAstute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”\n\nTorres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”\n\nLaurie Hernandez, like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.\n\nThe 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.\n\nA 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nOutside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.\n\nOn television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”\n\nAdditionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.\n\nRose Parade grand marshal firsts\n\nThroughout the 130-year history of the Rose Parade, athletes, entertainers, politicians, physicians, military personnel and others have served as grand marshal.
