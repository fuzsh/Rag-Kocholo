        "text": "Gina Torres has spent the past thirty years establishing herself as a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the screen.\n\nWith her fan-favorite character of Jessica Pearson on USA Network’s hit original series “Suits,” Torres broke boundaries when, in 2019, she became the first Afro-Latina to create, star in and produce a TV series, “Pearson,” which saw Jessica take on the world of Chicago politics. The role was a life changing one, earning Torres an ALMA Award, an Imagen Award (as well as multiple additional Imagen nominations), and the National Hispanic Media Coalition’s Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series and the Visionary Award from the LA Femme Film Festival.\n\nIncluded amongst Torres’s most notable television credits are her performances as the RussoCuban assassin Anna Espinosa on “Alias,” the shotgun-toting mercenary Zoe Washburn on Joss Whedon’s “Firefly” (whom she also played in his feature film SERENITY) and the soul-eating Jasmine on Whedon’s “Angel.”\n\nCurrently, Torres can be seen on FOX’s “9-1-1: Lone Star,” portraying paramedic captain Tommy Vega, who answered a call to action and returned to work amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2022, Torres received the Actress Award for Television at the 2nd Annual Critic’s Choice Celebration of Latino Cinema & Television for her role on the series. The show returned for a fourth season in January 2023.\n\nTorres is accustomed to playing influential women on screen, and translates that responsibility into her personal life. A trailblazer in her own right, Torres speaks often on the importance of diversity and inclusivity in the media, and uses her free time to mentor up and coming Latinx and Afro-Latinx talent. Torres is also heavily involved with charities and regularly donates proceeds to Feeding America and No Kid Hungry.\n\nAdditional television credits include “The Catch,” “Hannibal,” “Revenge,” “Huge,” “The Shield,” “24,” “Pushing Daisies,” “Flash Forward,” “Gossip Girl,” “Boondocks,” and “The Vampire Diaries.” She has also voiced the roles of Vixen in “The Justice League” series and Superwoman in “Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths” opposite James Woods.\n\nShe began her onscreen career with roles on “Law & Order,” “One Life to Live,” “Any Day Now” and “La Femme Nikita” but it was her collaboration with producers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert on four different shows – “MANTIS,” “Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,” “Xena: Warrior Princess” and “Cleopatra 2525” (the latter of which earned her an ALMA Award) - that brought her to the masses and promptly shifted her career.\n\nTorres’s film credits include THE MATRIX RELOADED and THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, JAM, SOUTH OF PICO, I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE with Chris Rock, HAIR SHOW with Mo’Nique, FIVE FINGERS opposite Laurence Fishburne and DON’T LET ME DROWN (critic’s choice at the Sundance Film Festival 2009).\n\nThe youngest of three children, Torres was born in Manhattan and raised in The Bronx with her close-knit Cuban family. She graduated from Fiorello LaGuardia School of Arts where, before entering the world of acting, she studied opera and jazz as a vocal major. Within a year of graduating, she was cast as Deena Jones in Dreamgirls, her first professional acting job. It wasn’t long before she started appearing on Broadway, being directed by such legends as Tommy Tune and Pete Masterson in Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public and Jerry Zaks in Face Value. Her additional theater credits include Off and Off-Off Broadway plays and musicals that spanned genres such as classic Greek tragedy in Antigone and Amphytrion, Shakespeare’s Pericles of Tyre and Julius Cesar, contemporary classics such as Lorca’s Blood Wedding and the world premiere of Sheila’s Day and Heliotrope Bouquet.\n\nOn January 1st, 2020 Torres served as a Grand Marshal of the 131st Annual Tournament of Roses Parade alongside Rita Moreno and Laurie Hernandez."
