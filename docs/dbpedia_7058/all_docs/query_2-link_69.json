        "text": "The star continued to receive small roles throughout the 1990s, and by 2001 the Spanish-speaking actress and singer had already scooped some great accolades, such as the ALMA Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Syndicated Drama Series for the wonderful portrayal of Helen in Cleopatra 2525 . She then played Jasmine in the film Angel and was nominated for the International Press Academy’s Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series.\n\nThree years later, the Cuban-American actress won with her roles in Herzen Soccer Moms, Matrix Revolutions and Matrix Reloaded .\n\nShe got another chance to prove herself once more in the third season of 24 and her role as Julia Milliken on the series, which also did well, allowed her to unleash her enviable talents as Zoe on the TV series Firefly . Although the show only lasted for a brief moment, fans were able to enjoy her presence as she reprized the role of Zoe in the 2005 sci-fi drama Serenity. Subsequently, Torres appeared in numerous projects that prospered like I Think I Love My Husband, the Fang, the Castle, Suits, and many others.\n\nTorres has also been involved in other engagements, such as voicing some episodes of the Justice League Unlimited animated series for the character of Vixen.

They have a daughter named Delilah and they both share the responsibilities of raising her.\n\nFishburne, who has two adult children (a son and daughter, born 1987 and 1991 respectively) from a previous romance with fellow film star Hajna O. Moss, fell in love with Torres. The duo worked on a variety of projects such as Matrix. The 1.84 m tall actor is known to have started acting in 1971, but his career received a huge boost when he starred with Gina Torres in The Matrix . He has currently received numerous awards and nominations from various respected awarding bodies such as Emmy, NAACP, Saturn and Oscar.\n\nAlthough no one is sure who Gina Torres is dating, reports now reveal that the stunning actress moved on even before their harmonious breakup became official. Once she was spotted sharing some romantic moments with an unknown man. Despite this, she has tried to keep things a secret since their divorce.\n\nGina Torres height and body measurements\n\nGina Torres has a charm that doesn’t seem to fade.
