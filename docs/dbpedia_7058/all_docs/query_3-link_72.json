        "text": "In September 2016, after departing “Suits” as its legal queen bee, Jessica Pearson, Gina Torres spoke about leaving a door open. But walking back through it, she now admits, was the furthest thing from her mind.\n\n“I just figured, O.K., well off she goes, and I’ll revisit her every now and then, and that will be just fine with me,” she said.\n\nTurns out it wasn’t.\n\nTorres found Jessica haunting her daydreams and realized she wasn’t finished with the character after all. And then her obsession with the presidential election and its strange bedfellows took flight.\n\n“I started thinking of Jessica in terms of a political fixer, and what would she do in that situation, and I started writing it down and sorting it out,” she recalled of the events that led to “Pearson,” her new drama, debuting July 17 on USA Network.\n\n“And luckily for me, I wasn’t the only one that was interested in this project,” she said. “I wasn’t the only one that missed Jessica, and I wasn’t the only one that really wanted to pursue it.”\n\n“Pearson” finds the beleaguered Jessica — disbarred in New York and her law license revoked in Illinois — sitting at the right hand of Mayor Bobby Novak (Morgan Spector) of Chicago.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
