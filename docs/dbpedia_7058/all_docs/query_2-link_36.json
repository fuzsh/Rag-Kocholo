        "text": "Born in New York City, the youngest of three children in a close-knit Cuban American family. Gina went to New York City's High School of Music and Art. She is a gifted mezzo soprano and was trained in opera and jazz and also sang in a gospel choir.\n\nGina is 5' 10\" tall, and has worked extensively in television, guest starring in shows such as Law & Order, NYPD and Profiler. Gina first worked with Renaisasance Pictures on MANTIS before playing Cleopatra in the XENA episode \"King of Assassins\" and creating the memorable character Nebula in HERCULES 4th and 5th season.\n\nClearly a favourite with RenPics, Gina was then cast in Cleopatra 2525 as Hel, with Vicky Pratt and Jennifer Sky, which lasted just one season unfortunately.\n\nMore recently, Gina appeared in La Femme Nikita and was excellent as an opposing secret agent in the top rating Alias.\n\nGina's latest project is Joss Whedon's Firefly, a brand new sci-fi show from the Buffy creator. She will be one of the regular cast.\n\nMarried to actor Laurence Fishburne (although the XENA magazine had them married some time ago!) Gina has a role alongside Fishburne in the upcoming 2 sequels to the mega hit movie The Matrix\n\n(April 2003)\n\nSince Firefly was cancelled, Gina has been appearing in Joss Whedon's Angel in the pivotal role of Jasmine.\n\nEpisodes"
