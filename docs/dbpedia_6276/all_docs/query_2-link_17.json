Armistead Burwell (1777-1841) moved his family from Hampden Sydney College, where he had been employed as steward, to Boydton in 1830. However, in a practice common in the slave-holding society, Lizzy as she was known, was \"loaned\" to Armistead's oldest son, Robert, in 1832, and she was moved out of Mecklenburg County to Hillsborough, North Carolina for what she described as ten unhappy years. About 1842 she was returned to Virginia, and eventually she was relegated to Armistead's daughter, Anne, and her husband, Hugh Garland, with whom she was by her own account happiest at least during her slavery years. She was moved with the family to St. Louis, Missouri in about 1847 where she honed her dressmaking skills while actually supporting the Burwell family, and bought her freedom in 1855. She married while in St. Louis, becoming Mrs. Elizabeth H. Keckly.\n\n(Read More)\n\nJudge Henry Wood, Jr. Home\n\n*National Register of Historic Places\n\n105 6th Street, Clarksville, VA 23927\n\nHours:\n\nPrivate home, not open to the public\n\nThe center section of the two story brick Queen Anne home was originally built around 1829 and the front of the home faced south towards Virginia Avenue.

Lee directed combined Confederate cavalry, infantry, and artillery to set a trap for the raiders in the vicinity of Ream's Station.\"\n\n(Read More, View Additional Photos)\n\nOakley & Aegypt\n\nLocations:\n\nOakley: 2181 W.
