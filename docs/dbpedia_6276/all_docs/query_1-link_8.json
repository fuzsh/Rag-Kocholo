        "text": "The Committee's basic jurisdiction is over education and labor matters generally. While Congress has been concerned over education and labor issues since its beginning, attempts to create a Committee with jurisdiction over education and labor failed in early Congresses due to Representatives' concern over the constitutional grounds for such a federal role and the belief that education was more properly the responsibility of the states.\n\nThe first Committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Education and Labor, was established on March 21, 1867 in the aftermath of the Civil War and the growth of American industry. On December 19, 1883, the Committee on Education and Labor was divided into two standing committees: Committee on Education and Committee on Labor. On January 2, 1947, the Legislative Reorganization Act again combined the Committees, renamed the Committee on Education and Labor. On January 4, 1995, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. On January 7, 1997, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce; on January 5, 2007, it became the Committee on Education and Labor; most recently, on January 5, 2011, the Committee was given its current name, the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n\nCommittee Membership\n\nCongress\n\nYear\n\nRepublicans\n\nDemocrats\n\nTotal Membership\n\n116th\n\n2018-19\n\n22\n\n28\n\n50\n\n115th\n\n2017-18\n\n23\n\n17\n\n40\n\n114th\n\n2015-16\n\n22\n\n16\n\n38\n\n113th\n\n2013-14\n\n23\n\n18\n\n41\n\n112th\n\n2011-12\n\n23\n\n17\n\n40\n\n111th\n\n2009-10\n\n19\n\n30\n\n49\n\n110th\n\n2007-08\n\n22\n\n27\n\n49\n\n109th\n\n2005-06\n\n26\n\n21\n\n47\n\n108th\n\n2003-04\n\n27\n\n22\n\n49\n\n107th\n\n2001-02\n\n27\n\n22\n\n49\n\n106th\n\n1999-00\n\n27\n\n22\n\n49\n\n105th\n\n1997-98\n\n25\n\n20\n\n45\n\n104th\n\n1995-96\n\n24\n\n19\n\n43\n\n103rd\n\n1993-94\n\n15\n\n28\n\n43\n\n102nd\n\n1991-92\n\n15\n\n25\n\n40\n\n101st\n\n1989-90\n\n13\n\n23\n\n36\n\n100th\n\n1987-88\n\n13\n\n21\n\n34\n\n99th\n\n1985-86\n\n14\n\n20\n\n34\n\n98th\n\n1983-84\n\n13\n\n25\n\n38\n\n97th\n\n1981-82\n\n14\n\n21\n\n35\n\n96th\n\n1979-80\n\n13\n\n24\n\n37\n\n95th\n\n1977-78\n\n12\n\n25\n\n37\n\n[Source: Committee Calendars]\n\nThe Committee on Education and Labor was created on March 21, 1867.\n\nCommittee on Education and Labor (1867-1883)\n\nChairman\n\nRanking Minority Member\n\nParty\n\nCongress\n\nYears\n\nJohn Baker (IL)\n\nUnion Republican\n\n40th\n\n1867-1869\n\nSamuel M.
