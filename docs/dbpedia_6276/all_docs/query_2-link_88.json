The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell presiding. Present: Senators Cantwell, Leahy, Kennedy, Grassley, Kyl, and DeWine. STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON Senator Cantwell. The Senate Judiciary Committee will come to order. Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone here today to our first Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of the year. We are here to consider the nominations of six individuals to the Federal Bench, one nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and five nominees to the district court. We are fortunate to have a talented group of nominees with us, and I would like to extend my welcome to them and to their families who are here and the friends who have joined them today. I am pleased to be able to chair this first hearing for Senator Leahy, and I would also like to thank him for the leadership that he has shown on the issue of judicial nominations since taking over the committee last summer. In just 6 months, we have already had 11 hearings on 34 different judicial nominees. This is more than the number of judges who received a hearing in the entire first year of the Clinton administration. This has required really a very significant effort on the part of the committee and the chairman, so I applaud him for that. Hearings were held during the August recess; during the week of September 11, requiring that nominees drive through the night to be here; and hearings have been held during the period when anthrax contamination closed the Hart Senate Office Building. So, again, I appreciate everybody's indulgence. As a result of those hearings, 28 qualified judges have been confirmed and sent to the Federal courts around the country. I am confident that we will soon confirm additional nominees now that the Senate is back in session. By scheduling this hearing today, just one day into the new Senate session, this committee sends a message that it will continue on a schedule to hold hearings and vote on judicial nominees in a responsible manner. I would like to make special note of two of the nominees here today from the State of Iowa. They are here with the support of one of the committee's longest serving members, Senator Grassley, who I know is on his way down. They are also here with the support of Senator Harkin--we appreciate him being here as well--which shows that there is bipartisan support for these nominees. Senator Kyl, who has just joined us, another valued member of this committee, also has a nominee to the district court here, and it is an extra pleasure for me to be chairing this hearing with in attendance and working to confirm this nominee promptly from his State. The nominees here today all have strong records that demonstrate an ability to analyze complex and important legal concepts in a manner befitting a Federal judge. Their records reflect a commitment to our fundamental constitutional protections and rights, including the advancement and protection of civil rights and liberties for everyone. Several of the nominees are here today with bipartisan support from their delegations. We take that support and sponsorship seriously. It is my opinion that the dispute over judicial nominees could become a thing of the past if we were to see more nominees like these, nominated after consultation with the Senate. As Federal judges, these nominees before us today will have a vital role to play at a difficult time in our Nation's history. I am confident that they will take this responsibility seriously and ensure that the decisions that they make demonstrate fair-mindedness and rely on a rich history of judicial precedent. Before we go on to have the nominees come forward, we are going to hear from several House and Senate members who are here. I don't know, Senator Kyl, if you had an opening statement that you wanted to make. If not, I will go to our various colleagues here who have given of their time to come and speak on behalf of these nominees. STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Madam Chairman, in view of the large number of our colleagues who are present and the importance of moving along, I will simply note that I hope that we will indeed move with alacrity on the nominations both for district and court this year to fill the over 100 vacancies that currently exist. I appreciate the chairman holding this hearing. I appreciate your chairing the hearing today, and I will have more to say about the nominee from the State of Arizona very briefly. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Kyl. We will give Senator Grassley an opportunity here to decide whether he wants to--Senator Grassley, we want to give you an opportunity to introduce your nominees, if you are comfortable in doing it at this time. Being the most senior member of our committee here and a longstanding member, we want to give you that honor of being first in expressing your thoughts. PRESENTATION OF MICHAEL MELLOY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT AND JAMES GRITZNER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA BY HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. First of all, I apologize for being late, but I was managing the stimulus package on the floor. I have the pleasure today of introducing to the committee two distinguished Iowans who have been nominated to the Federal bench. Judge Michael Joseph Melloy has been nominated to serve as U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, and James Edward Gritzner has been nominated to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. These people are two very qualified people for Federal judgeship positions, and I am obviously proud to support their nominations, as I was involved with suggesting these people to the President of the United States. Judge Melloy was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and married Jane Anne Knapp Melloy. She is a counselor in the Cedar Rapids schools. He graduated magna cum laude from Lorus College, and with high distinction from the University of Iowa College of Law. Before he attended law school, Judge Melloy served in the United States Army. Upon graduation from law school, Judge Melloy gained extensive experience in civil litigation when he joined the Dubuque law firm of O'Connor, Thomas, Wright, Hammer, Bertsch and Norby, where he eventually became a partner and shareholder. In 1986, Judge Melloy was appointed United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Iowa. In 1992, Judge Melloy was appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa by President George Bush, Sr. In this position, Judge Melloy has presided over a wide variety of criminal and civil cases. He also has served on a number of committees, including the Eighth Circuit Judicial Council, the Gender Fairness Task Force of the Eighth Circuit, and the Eighth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction Committee. Judge Melloy also currently chairs the Bankruptcy Administration Committee of the Judicial Conference. Judge Melloy is accompanied today, I am told, by his family, including his wife, Jane Anne; one of his daughters, Bridget; and his sister, Colleen George. I am sure that they are all very proud of the advancement that their family member is making in the profession of law. I would go to Jim Gritzner now, who was born in Charles City, Iowa, and is married to Zoe Ann Gritzner, who is here today to support her husband's nomination to the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. He received a B.A. degree in 1969 from Dakota Wesleyan, a Master of Arts degree in 1974 from the University of Northern Iowa, and a law degree in 1979 from Drake University Law School. While he was in law school, Jim Gritzner worked as a law school for a Magistrate Judge with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Upon graduation from law school, Jim Gritzner worked as an associate attorney for the Waterloo law firm of Mosier, Thomas, Beatty, Dutton, Braun and Staack from 1979 to 1981. After that, he held a brief position as partner of a law firm that he co- founded, Humphrey, Haas and Gritzner, in Des Moines. In 1982, he joined the Des Moines law firm of Nyemaster, Goode, Voigts, West, Hansell and O'Brien as an associate attorney, and from 1986 to the present has served as a shareholder. In addition to his law practice, Mr. Gritzner has had a notable record of public record. In 1980, he was appointed by Governor Ray to be a member of the Iowa Board of Parole, where he served through 1982. From 1985 to 1990, he was primary prosecutor for the Committee on Professional Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association and the Client Security and Attorney Disciplinary Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court. Because of this work, Mr. Gritzner has been recognized as an authority on legal ethics in Iowa. He is often called upon to resolve ethical issues for other lawyers, and serves as an expert witness on professional responsibility. Both Judge Melloy and Jim Gritzner have had distinguished legal careers and have shown tremendous dedication to public service. They will be a huge asset to the Eighth Circuit and to the Southern District of Iowa. I am confident that these men possess the skills, integrity, commitment, intellect, and temperament that we expect of all good judges. So it is with great respect and admiration that I recommend both of these highly qualified individuals to the Judiciary Committee for favorable consideration. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Grassley, and thank you for that timely entrance and jumping right into that. We appreciate it. Senator Harkin is also joining us. Senator Harkin, did you want to give comments on Judge Melloy and Mr. Gritzner? PRESENTATION OF MICHAEL MELLOY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT AND JAMES GRITZNER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA BY HON. TOM D. HARKIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Harkin. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for holding this hearing, and I am pleased to be here with my Iowa colleague to introduce and give my support to Michael Melloy, who has been nominated to serve on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and to James Gritzner, nominated for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Senator Grassley went through all of their long resumes. I will not do that again, just to say that Michael Melloy has a long history in the law. He has a strong judicial background, serving as a Federal Judge in Iowa's Northern District since 1992, and before that serving on the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and also as a private lawyer for 12 years in a law firm in Dubuque, Iowa, after graduating from the University of Iowa Law School. As I supported Michael Melloy's nomination in 1992 to the Federal bench, I support his nomination to the Eighth Circuit today. Jim Gritzner also has had extensive trial experience working in private practice since graduating from Drake Law School in 1979. Most recently, he has been an attorney with the law firm of Nyemaster, Goode, Voigts, West, Hansell and O'Brien, in Des Moines, since 1982. In addition, from 1985 to 1990, Jim Gritzner served as counsel to the Committee on Professional Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Association, and counsel to the Client Security and Attorney Disciplinary Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court. Again, I thank you, Madam Chair, for holding these hearings. I recommend these two fine individuals, but, Madam Chair, I am going to take 60 seconds. I don't get up here before this committee very often. Something just happened in Iowa, and Judge Melloy was the judge on this case. There was an editorial in the paper: ``What sort of country would put a man in Federal prison for 15 years for possessing a single .22 caliber bullet? Ours would.'' And it did, in one of the most bizarre applications of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Here was a man, 38 years old. His former girlfriend had claimed that he had stolen some stuff from her. The police got a search warrant and went and searched his place and found one .22 caliber bullet in his apartment. Because he had a previous conviction for theft, not armed robbery--he never had a gun, never had a gun--they put in the form and it spit out and he got 15 years for possessing one .22 caliber bullet. That came before Judge Melloy. Well, Madam Chair, I voted for the Sentencing Guidelines. I was wrong. I think it has turned into a nightmare. I think once again we have got to give judges the right to judge or take the name away from them, don't call them judges any longer. If we are going to have someone be a judge--these two gentlemen before you from Iowa I can say have the experience and the ability to judge, but because of the Sentencing Guidelines a lot of times their hands are tied. Just think about that. Fifteen years. He possessed one .22 caliber bullet and that is all. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Harkin, for being here and for your comments. I know that perhaps we will get into that in some of the questions the committee is going to ask. I know that we have such a distinguished group here, more than we usually have at our hearings, so thank you for being here. I don't know if you have worked out with each other the order of process here. I know that it would be somewhat cohesive to have Mr. Leach go next, if possible, just to get the Iowa judges out of the way. If my colleagues would agree to that, then we could proceed to the Louisiana nomination and then right on down the line, if that is acceptable to people. Given that, Congressman Leach, it is a pleasure to have you over here in the Senate, if you would like to give comments on the two nominees from Iowa. PRESENTATION OF MICHAEL MELLOY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT AND JAMES GRITZNER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA BY HON. JAMES A. LEACH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Representative Leach. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I apologize to my senior colleagues from this body. I will be very brief. One, I want to express my great admiration for Senator Grassley for taking such a heavy responsibility, in particular, for these judgeships and having put forth two sterling individuals. I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Harkin for his endorsement of both of these judges, and we all know the Senate process is it is helpful to have Senators from both parties supportive, and that is the case. With Judge Melloy, who is a constituent, you have an individual who has the strong support of his community, the strong support of his profession, and is a man that has embellished the Federal court in two different instances, and I am sure will ennoble it further with his elevation to a superior court. With Judge Gritzner, you have an individual who is not a constituent, but as a small State we know of reputations, and to bring forth an individual with such a background in ethics and, I might say, arts and culture, I think is very relevant to the judiciary. The State of Iowa is exceptionally proud of both of these nominations. I thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. We will now go to Senator Breaux, from Louisiana, for his comments. PRESENTATION OF JAY ZAINEY, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA BY HON. JOHN B. BREAUX, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Senator Breaux. Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the committee, for allowing us to be on what must be the most exciting part of this program today to listen to us talk about our constituents, but I think it is very important. The comment has been made that it is good when you have bipartisan support. Jay Zainey, who is nominated to be a Federal district judge for Louisiana, has bipartisan support. We are Democrats; he is a Republican. He has bi-gender support. Mary and I are both pleased to be here. I would just say all of these nominees have gone to the right schools and made good grades and wrote good articles, but I think--and I have said this many times before in representing candidates from Louisiana--particularly for the Federal district court, you want people who know people because the district court is the people's court. They try cases. People come before them who are lawyers and people who have been aggrieved and been charged, and you have to understand people. There is a role for philosophers and professors and teachers of law, but particularly on the district court there is a role for people who practice law. Jay Zainey is a single practitioner in New Orleans who runs a general practice of civil and criminal and bankruptcy and everything that you would expect. I mean, he has seen it all. Those are the types of additional qualifications that I think are unique and important to the Federal district court. I would just point out one other thing. He has used his time both as a member of the bar and in civic activities in some very important ways that I just would share just for a moment. He was president of the Louisiana State Bar Association and inaugurated a community action committee, probably the first in the Nation, where the bar association had a committee to help carry out charitable projects, to say, look, we ought to give something back. The State Bar Association, under his leadership, initiated that community action committee. Also, he established a special committee to devote to the task of providing legal services for the disabled and, in fact, has been honored by the bar association and by the Legal Services Project Director's Award for his dedication to the provision of legal services to disadvantaged Louisianians. He also served on the board of directors for the Advocacy Center for the Disabled and Elderly. This is a person who is a totally committed citizen, in addition to being a fine attorney and outstanding lawyer, with all the experience and education that I think will make him an outstanding Federal district judge. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Breaux. Senator Landrieu? PRESENTATION OF JAY ZAINEY, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA BY HON. MARY L. LANDRIEU, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA Senator Landrieu. Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me just join my colleague, Senator Breaux, in giving my hearty congratulations to Jay Zainey for being nominated, and to acknowledge his presence and the presence of his wife, Joy, and his daughter, Margaret, who is here with us, and to commend the President for nominating such an outstanding lawyer. We have got many fine lawyers in our State, as every Senator could claim. But as Senator Breaux has mentioned, not only has Jay distinguished himself through his academic career, but really in a leadership position initiating things that never were before and creating them. Out of his own personal experience with a child he and his wife have who is specially challenged, he took that personal experience and turned it into something that has been of tremendous service to thousands of families in Louisiana who are challenged by raising a disabled child or having someone in their family that has those special challenges. I think that is the kind of leadership we want on the Federal bench. The only thing I will say is particularly at this time in our history, our Federal bench serves as a powerful tool for the powerless. It serves as a source of pride for all Americans, and at this particular time a beacon of hope for the world. I think Jay will bring more than honor and judgment to that bench and he has my hearty congratulations. Senator Cantwell. Well, I want to thank the two Senators from Louisiana for showing up. For all the nominees, the Senators who have come to speak on your behalf have very busy schedules, and to come with such enthusiasm shows a great deal of interest in making sure that your nominations go through smoothly. So thank you. Well, let's turn to Senator Campbell. PRESENTATION OF ROBERT BLACKBURN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO BY HON. BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO Senator Campbell. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I was interested in Senator Breaux's comments about the type of people we look for for the Federal district court, and I certainly agree with him that we need people that have a good, strong law background, but are also involved in the community and have common sense. Certainly, our candidate from Colorado falls in that category. In fact, he has even been known to ride a motorcycle or two. Senator Cantwell. Is that the common sense part? [Laughter.] Senator Campbell. Absolutely, absolutely. It is certainly an honor and a pleasure to introduce to the committee today what I consider a tremendous legal mind from the State of Colorado and an outstanding citizen from our State, Judge Robert Blackburn, who is here with his family. Judge Blackburn has been practicing law in Colorado now for more than a quarter of a century and has handled all types of cases. He has represented school districts, boards of county commissioners, departments of social services, banks, corporations, public officials, and private citizens in all kinds of legal contexts. I firmly believe that he is overwhelmingly qualified and definitely is the right person for this job. Over a year ago, Senator Allard and I set up a review panel made up of a cross-section of people from the legal profession in Colorado to help us, you might say screen, to find out who we should recommend to the President for this post. Judge Blackburn came out very high, if not on top, of literally every person in that panel's recommendations. For the past 12\\1/2\\ years, Judge Blackburn has served as a district judge for the 16th Judicial District in Colorado. He has a long and proven record of working hard on behalf of our people. Throughout his legal career, he has been tough but fair, and prepared and engaged in his work, and I think that qualifies him as a definite asset to the judicial system. Those qualities are important characteristics that have undoubtedly served him well and will, no doubt, do so in the future. I know we have to bounce around from person to person. There are a lot of eminently qualified people today, but I certainly am looking forward to seeing him serve on the bench. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Senator Cantwell. Senator Campbell, thank you for your remarks. Senator Allard. PRESENTATION OF ROBERT BLACKBURN, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO BY HON. WAYNE ALLARD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO Senator Allard. Madam Chairman, thank you very much. I consider it an honor and a privilege to come before you with my colleague, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, to introduce the Honorable Robert E. Blackburn, a person who I believe has considerable integrity and true intellect. Judge Blackburn has been nominated by President Bush for a Federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, and I urge the committee's acceptance of his nomination. Madam Chairman, I have before me a letter here from the chief judge of the district court talking about Judge Blackburn. He says, ``I know Judge Blackburn and I believe him to be well qualified.'' I just would want to also point out to the committee that the District of Colorado struggles to do the work of a demonstrated need of 9 active judges with only 4 active judges. So I really appreciate your moving forward with this confirmation because it is badly needed in that particular district. Judge Robert E. Blackburn knows the law and he knows Colorado. He graduated from the University of Colorado School of Law in 1974 and received his undergraduate degree from Western State College. His roots go deep in Colorado. He was raised on a farm in the proud community of Las Animas, Colorado. I feel that that keeps one foot in the real world while he is serving on the bench. He has practiced law as an attorney and judge for over two decades. He comes before the committee today from State district court, a post he has held since 1988. Previously, Mr. Blackburn served as a deputy district attorney, Bent County Attorney, and then municipal judge and city attorney. In addition to that, he has extensive experience as a business owner. I think that is an important talent that will serve him well with the multiple demands of the Federal bench. Judge Blackburn has the support of many people, as well, and I would just reiterate what Senator Campbell said that we had a committee of well-qualified, respected attorneys in Colorado help us with the selection process and I think they did a very good job. As a result of that, Judge Blackburn has the support of many people in Colorado. An editorial in the Denver Post, upon hearing of Judge Blackburn's nomination, proclaimed, ``We are delighted by the White House decision.'' The column went on to praise the extensive experience of the judge, as well as his solid knowledge of the law and reputation for fairness. The Denver Post also noted in their editorial of support that he is widely respected by other judges and by lawyers who have appeared before him. The Denver Post urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to exercise all reasonable speed with the Blackburn nomination, saying, and I quote, ``The long overworked federal court of Colorado needs qualified new judges, and it needs them now.'' In summary, I think Judge Blackburn is a highly qualified candidate and, in the words of the Post, ``eminently qualified.'' A substantial majority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary found, as a result of an extensive investigation, that the Honorable Robert E. Blackburn is well qualified for appointment as Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Thank you again. I urge the committee's acceptance of Judge Blackburn's nomination. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Allard and Senator Campbell, thank you very much for coming and giving your remarks on Judge Blackburn, from Colorado. We appreciate you being here. We are going to turn now to Senator Kyl for his comments on Judge Cindy Jorgenson. Senator Kyl. Madam Chairman, why don't I defer to Representative Norton, since I am going to be on the panel throughout the afternoon. Senator Cantwell. We appreciate that. Representative Norton, would you like to give comments on the District of Columbia nominee, Richard Leon? PRESENTATION OF RICHARD LEON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BY HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Representative Norton. Well, the Senator is very generous and I appreciate it. Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to come before you to recommend Richard Leon for the District Court here in the District of Columbia. As you are aware, the District does not have Senators, but the President has agreed to consult with me, as he does with members of this body, on nominees to our district court. I am gratified that he has kindly agreed to do that, and I am gratified that the Chair of this committee has also agreed to do so. My good colleague to my right, Mr. Leach, has authorized me to say that he too knows Richard Leon and he thinks highly of him, and wants me to say that he recommends him. So although there are not a lot of Republicans in the District of Columbia, I can say that Mr. Leon has bipartisan support as well. [Laughter.] I am sure that my Republican constituents would be as happy as I am with this nominee. I had the opportunity to interview him and to look into his background. I consider Mr. Leon very well qualified for the Federal bench. He has had a classic career of good preparation for the Federal bench: his work in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York; his work in the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, where he was recognized for his outstanding legal work; his work as a Deputy Attorney General in the Department's Environment and Resources Division; and, of course, his work with House investigations, where Mr. Leach got to see him and know him. Now, Mr. Leon has brought his career, civil and criminal litigation experience to private practice here in the District of Columbia, where he is lead counsel in complex civil and criminal cases. In addition, he has been an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown Law School, and has been active in the D.C. Bar Association. There is no doubt in my mind that, by background and experience, Richard Leon is well qualified for the U.S. district court here and I am pleased to recommend him highly to you. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Representative Norton, for those comments. Again, I thank the panel for being here today and giving time out of their schedule to speak positively about these nominees. Senator Kyl, did you want to take an opportunity now? PRESENTATION OF CINDY JORGENSON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA BY HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Senator Kyl. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Yes, now I can truly say we will save the best until last. I can brag about my nominee that way. Cindy Jorgenson is a judge on the Pima County Superior Court bench and is one of two nominees of the President. I hope the other will soon be before the committee, as well, because they are in the division of the district court that is the second busiest in terms of criminal felony filings or caseload, the second busiest out of the 94 district courts or divisions in the entire United States. This is a court that needs the help and, as a sitting judge, Cindy Jorgenson will be able to hit the deck running, as it were. She also is distinguished by the fact that she graduated from the University of Arizona both in her undergraduate and her law school career, exactly the same path that I followed, I might add, quite a few years before Judge Jorgenson. She is currently the presiding judge on the family law bench. She served as a prosecutor in the Pima County Attorney's office. She supervised felony sex crimes and child abuse prosecutions. Until her appointment to the bench, she was employed by the Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney. She worked in both the Criminal and the Civil Divisions there, so she has both the civil and the criminal experience. She was assigned to a variety of cases, including Native American and immigration matters, drug cases, civil medical malpractice, civil forfeiture, all the kinds of cases that would come before her as a sitting judge. She has also represented the United States in several appellate cases before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Madam Chairman, to save time I won't go through her professional activities and honors, except for a couple. Suffice it to say they are numerous. She has served on a variety of different commissions. She received the governor's recognition for work on jury reform. She has been awarded the United States Department of Justice Special Achievement Award in four different years, and has received other commendations. She is very well qualified. I am delighted that the President has nominated her and I am confident the committee will find her equally as qualified. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Kyl, for those comments. We are going to move now to the nominees. We are about ready to move to having Mr. Melloy be sworn in for his oath, but since the chairman of the committee is here, Senator Leahy, I don't know if you wanted to take an opportunity to give comments on these nominees or this hearing today. Chairman Leahy. Only this, Madam Chair: I wanted to thank you and Senator Grassley and Senator Kyl for taking the time. In constantly trying to move things as quickly as we do, it means that we have hearings at times when normally we don't. I don't know that we have ever had a hearing in the first week back, and the reason that we are able to do it is the three of you are willing to take the time to make it possible, but especially you, Senator Cantwell. I just wanted to come over and welcome the nominees. I know you have all worked not only with the White House, but with the Senators from your home States, and it is good to have you here. That is all I have to say. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows:] Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee I thank Senator Cantwell for chairing this important hearing and also thank all of the nominees and their Senators and Representatives for arranging to appear today. This is the second day of this session of Congress and we are proceeding with our first confirmation hearing for judicial nominees. Last year I announced our first judicial nominations hearing within 10 minutes of the Senate reorganization last summer. We held that first hearing last session on the day after Committee Members were assigned. In fact, in the last five months of last year we held 11 hearings involving judicial nominees. That is more hearings involving judicial nominees than were held in all of 1996, 1997, 1999 or 2000 and hearings at a more rapid pace than in either 1995 or 1998. Unlike the preceding six and one-half years in which no hearings were held in 30 months, since the Committee reorganized last summer, we have held at least one hearing for judicial nominees every month. In fact, we held two in July, two unprecedented hearings during last summer's August recess, two in December, and three in October. In the last five months of last year, the Committee considered and reported favorably to the Senate 32 judicial nominations. We reported more judicial nominees after the August recess than in any of the preceding six years and more than in any similar period over the preceding six and one-half years. And last year was no ordinary year for the country or the Senate. Nonetheless, the Committee worked hard to make progress with judicial nominations, and I extend my thanks to all Senators who helped in those efforts and assisted in the work that it takes to consider the scores of nominations that we did in the last five months of last year. One of the reasons that the Senate was able to confirm 28 judges in the last five months of the last session was because they were strongly supported as consensus nominees by people from across the political and legal spectrums. In the last five months of last year, not only did the Senate confirm almost twice as many judges as were confirmed in the first year of the George H.W. Bush Administration; we confirmed more judges, including twice as many judges to the Courts of Appeals, as in the first year of the Clinton Administration. Our hard work led to some success. By the time the Committee was organized and beginning its work last summer, the vacancies on the federal courts were peaking at 111. The Committee has begun the process of lowering the vacancies on our federal courts. Since I became Chairman, 25 additional vacancies have arisen. Through our work in the last five months of last year we were able to outpace this high level of attrition. By contrast, when Republicans took charge of the Senate in January 1995 until the majority shifted in the summer of 2001, federal judicial vacancies rose from 65 to more than 100, an increase of almost 60 percent. In spite of our short year, the need to focus our attention on responsible action in the fight against international terrorism; the threats and dislocation of the anthrax attacks; the long overdue oversight of the FBI; the need to overcome a partisan filibuster that prevented action on the measure that funds our nation's foreign policy initiatives and provides funds to help build the international coalition against terrorism; and the partisan efforts to delay the organization and then the reorganization of the Senate, we persevered and attended to the work of the Committee. A good part of that work can be found in the 16 confirmation hearings in the last five months of last year for Executive Branch nominees; the confirmations of 77 senior Executive branch officials including the Director of the FBI, the head of the DEA, the Commissioner of INS, the Director of U.S. Marshals, the Associate Attorney General, the Director of ONDCP, the Director of PTO, seven Assistants Attorney General and 59 U.S. attorneys. I regret that the White House did not begin sending U.S. marshal nominations until very late in the session, and that more U.S. Attorneys and U.S. marshals were not available to be considered. I recall soon after Judge Gregory's confirmation last July that the White House Counsel said in a public interview that he did not expect the Senate to confirm more than five judges before the end of 2001. We reached that mark by September, when the Senate confirmed Judge Prost, our third Court of Appeals confirmation in two months. We went on to confirm more than five times the number predicted by the White House Counsel in just five months. One might have thought from the constant barrage of partisan criticism that 2001 resembled 1996, a year in which a Republican Senate majority confirmed only 17 judges, none of which were confirmed to the Courts of Appeals. The fact is that the Senate can be proud of its achievements during the final months of 2001. I had hoped that more Senators would recognize what we were able to accomplish and consider our record in historical context. I have yet to hear any Republican concede any shortcomings in the practices they employed over the previous six and one-half years. Since that change in majority last summer, we have been exceeding the pace and productivity that they had maintained. If their efforts were acceptable or as praiseworthy as some would argue, I would expect them to acknowledge that our efforts are also to be commended. If they did things they now regret, their admissions would go far to helping establish a common basis of understanding and comparison. Taking that step would be a significant gesture, one that has not yet occurred. We know that our work has not been completed. There are still far too many judicial vacancies that we must work together to fill. We begin this session with our first Committee activity being a judicial nominations hearing, our twelfth since the change in majority last summer. We will continue our work to keep the confirmation numbers and the vacancy numbers both moving in the right directions. At the end of 1999, Chief Justice Rehnquist was encouraged when only 34 judges were confirmed all year and 35 were left pending. Similarly, at the end of 2000, the Chief Justice commended the Senate for confirming 39 judges all year, a year in which 41 judicial nominations were returned to the President without Senate action. Last year, we were able to confirm 28 judges in only five months and the Committee reported four additional nominees to the Senate for final action from the 65 Court of Appeals and District Court nominations sent to the Senate during the course of the year. More than two-thirds of last year's vacancies and this year's continue to be on our federal trial courts. The Administration has been slow to make nominations to the vacancies on the federal trial courts. In the last five months of last year, the Senate confirmed 22 of the 37 District Court nominees it received. That is a higher percentage of the President's trial court nominees than the prior Republican majority had allowed the Senate to confirm in the first session of either of the last two Congresses with a Democrat President. Unfortunately, we ended last year without a nominee for 55 of the current 69 District Court vacancies; i.e., almost 80 percent of the current trial court vacancies had no nominations for the Senate to consider. The White House nominated only one District Court nominee in the last two months of last year. This session we have received nominations for two dozen of the four and one-half dozen District Court vacancies that were without a nominee. That is a start. Unfortunately, last year the White House also acted unilaterally to change the practice of nine Republican and Democratic Presidents to allow the ABA to begin its peer reviews during the selection process. Those professional peer reviews for judicial nominees cannot even begin now until after the nomination and may take several months to complete. The ABA peer reviews on the nominations being made this week, for example, are not likely to become available until late March or April. If the nominees have the support of their home State Senators, and after the Committee has received ABA peer reviews, these nominees will then be eligible to be included in Committee hearings, but not until sometime this spring. And even then, over two dozen of the current federal trial court vacancies, 31, almost half of all current federal trail court vacancies, will still be without eligible nominees. To make real progress will take the cooperation of the White House. The most progress filling judicial vacancies can be made most quickly if the White House would begin working with home State Senators to identify fair-minded, non- ideologue, consensus nominees. One of the reasons that the Senate was able to confirm 28 judges in the last five months of the last session was because they were strongly supported as consensus nominees by people from across the political and legal spectrums. In the last five months of last year, not only did the Senate confirm almost twice as many judges as were confirmed in the first year of the first George H.W. Bush Administration and more judges, including twice as many judges to the Court of Appeals as in the first year of the Clinton Administration, but the Committee held more hearing for more nominees and favorably reported more nominees after the August recess than in any of the preceding six years of Republican control. I will continue my effort to work with all Senators to schedule nominations for hearings considering a number of actors, including the consensus of support for the nominee, the needs of the court to which the person is nominated, the interests of the home state Senators, and the work load and legislative schedule of the Committee. We have a number of persisting vacancies that should have been filled by qualified candidates nominated from 1995 through 2000. Over the six and one-half years that preceded the Democratic Senate majority, a total of only 46 judges were confirmed to fill vacancies on the Courts of Appeals, an average of approximately seven a year. This has resulted in multiple vacancies in a number of Circuits. There are many problems that have grown and even festered over time and they cannot all be remedied immediately. In the last five months of last year, the Senate proceeded to confirm six Court of Appeals judges. Indeed, last year the Senate confirmed the first new member of the 5th Circuit in seven years, the first new judge to the 4th Circuit in three years, and the first new judge to the 10th Circuit in six years. I again urge the White House to redouble its efforts to work with home state Senators from both parties, Democratic Senators as well as Republican Senators. I urge the White House, as I have for years, to work with home State Senators of both parties to identify, select and nominate strong, consensus, fair nominees for these important vacancies. Today we demonstrate, again, that consensus nominees with widespread and bipartisan support are more easily and more quickly considered by the Committee. As some indication of the bipartisan manner win which we proceeded last year, I note that the Senate confirmed 11 nominees from States with two Republican Senators, nine from States with a Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator, five from States with two Democratic Senators, and three for courts in the District of Columbia which is without Senate representation. That is a decidedly bipartisan record. Today's group of nominees reflects that bipartisanship as well. Two are from States with two Republican Senators, two are from a State with a Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator, one is from a State with two Democratic Senators, and one is for a vacancy in the District of Columbia. Last year, the Senate acted promptly to confirm all of the judges in an average of fewer than 60 days from the time we received a peer review from the ABA. This stands in sharp contrast to recent years in which the average time for consideration had risen to historic levels, about 200 days from nomination to confirmation and more than a year on average for the few lucky Court of Appeals judges to be considered. We have also completed work on a number of judicial nominations in a more open manner than ever before. For the first time, this Committee is making public the ``blue slips'' sent to home State Senators. Until my chairmanship, these matters were treated as confidential materials and restricted from public view. We have moved nominees with less time from hearings to the Committee's business meeting agenda, and then out to the floor, where nominees have received timely roll call votes and confirmations. Over the preceding six and one-half years, at least eight judicial nominees who completed a confirmation hearing were never considered by the Committee and simply left without action. Additionally, the past practices of extended unexplained anonymous holds on nominees after a hearing were not as evident in the last five months of last year as they were in the past. Throughout last year, in particular, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, some of us have been seeking to join together in a bipartisan effort in the best interests of the country. For those on the Committee who helped in those efforts and assisted in the hard work of reviewing and considering the scores of nominations the Committee reported in the last five months of last year, I commend them. As we demonstrated last year and again today at this hearing, we are moving ahead to fill judicial vacancies and consider nominees with strong bipartisan support. Senator Kyl. Madam Chairman. Senator Cantwell. Yes, Senator Kyl. Senator Kyl. While the chairman is still here, I thank him, as well, for helping to fill the vacancies on this very busy court. Senator Leahy, I mentioned just before your arrival, the second busiest in the country. Also, I had forgotten to mention that Senator McCain, from Arizona, is also very supportive of Judge Jorgenson's nomination and regretted that he couldn't be here at the hearing, but wanted me to be sure and make that point for the record. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Of course, Senator Grassley has talked to me about this agenda on numerous occasions before now and I was delighted we were able to--I wish we could have worked out his nominees before we recessed, but I am glad we are able to do it now. Senator Grassley. Madam Chairman? Senator Cantwell. Yes, Senator Grassley? Senator Grassley. Two things. I would like unanimous consent to put a statement on these judges in from Senator Hatch. Senator Cantwell. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch follows:] Statement of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Ranking Republican Member I am pleased that we are considering today the nominations of six exceedingly well qualified candidates for the federal bench. The convention of this hearing on the first full day of the new congressional session is a step in the right direction. Moreover, our consideration of six judges at this hearing represents the most judges we have considered at a single confirmation hearing during this Congress, which is another positive step. I sincerely hope that we maintain this pace at future hearings, because we have plenty of work to do. There are 101 vacancies in the federal judiciary, a vacancy rate of nearly 12%. Yesterday, the White House submitted 24 new nominations to the Senate for confirmation. Since we have 38 nominees still pending from last session, we now have a total of 62 nominees awaiting action from the Senate. In 1994, the second year of President Clinton's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 judicial nominees. I am confident that Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve, or even hopefully exceed, this number in 2002, particularly the many circuit court nominees that are pending to fill emergency vacancies in appellate courts around the country. To do this, however, we must keep up the pace of hearings and confirmation votes so that we do not fall further behind in filling the vacancies that plague our federal judiciary. I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues to accomplish this goal. As I stated earlier, today's hearing is a step in the right direction. We have the privilege of considering six outstanding lawyers to be federal judges. Our only circuit nominee on the agenda is Michael Melloy, who has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Judge Melloy has already sat by designation on the Eighth Circuit in his present capacity as a federal district court judge in Iowa, so he comes to this hearing with more than a passing familiarity of what his future role will require. Robert Blackburn has been nominated to be a District Court Judge for the District of Colorado, and he will bring a great deal of legal experience to the Federal bench. Judge Blackburn has practiced law for 13 years in private practice, served as a Deputy District Attorney for 6 years, as a County Attorney for 8 years, as a Municipal Judge for 3 years, and as a state court judge since 1988. Our next nominee is James Gritzner, who has been nominated to the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Although Mr. Gritzner began his legal career in a general litigation practice, it really exploded--so to speak--when he began specializing in cases concerning catastrophic fires and explosions. From his office in Des Moines, he has handled such cases in 23 states and, in the process, developed a national reputation. He is also known as an expert in legal ethics, having prosecuted over 100 attorney disciplinary cases before the Grievance Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court. Next, Cindy Jorgenson is the nominee for the District of Arizona. Judge Jorgenson's legal experience includes serving as a deputy county attorney, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and as a Superior Court Judge--all in the State of Arizona. She supervised the felony sex crimes and child abuse prosecution unit in Pima County for several years. Then, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney handled both criminal and civil cases. Since 1996, Judge Jorgenson has served with great distinction on the state trial court bench in Tucson, Arizona. Richard Leon has been nominated to be a district judge in the District of Columbia. Mr. Leon has had a remarkable career that has spanned both public service and private practice. He has served as a judicial law clerk, as counsel to U.S. House committees and task forces, and as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite the present demands of his private practice, he teaches a class on congressional investigations right up the street at Georgetown University Law Center. Jay Zainey is today's nominee for the district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana. Mr. Zainey has maintained a successful private practice and has garnered the respect of his colleagues, as reflected in his election as President of the Louisiana State Bar Association. One remarkable achievement during his tenure as president was the creation of the first state bar committee in the nation to provide legal referral services for the disabled. I welcome each of our nominees to the Committee this afternoon, and commend the President on his choices for the federal judiciary. I look forward to working with my Democratic colleagues to ensure your swift confirmation. Senator Grassley. And then could I also thank Senator Leahy, just so people know that when a Senator says they are going to do something, they do it. Senator Leahy told me before the holidays that the first hearing we had in the new year, Jim Gritzner and Judge Melloy would be on the agenda. I thank you very much for delivering. Thank you very much. Chairman Leahy. We tried to do it within 24 hours of coming in. We almost made that 24 hours. I think it was like 26 hours of coming into session. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Well, I am sure Mr. Melloy would, even at 26 hours, like to come forward now. Before you sit down, if you could raise your right hand, do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge Melloy. I do. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Welcome to the committee, Mr. Melloy. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL MELLOY, OF IOWA, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT Judge Melloy. Thank you, Senator. Senator Cantwell. If you would like to introduce your family that is here, this is an appropriate time. Judge Melloy. I would, and I would like to first thank you, Senator Cantwell, for taking the time to chair this hearing and Senator Leahy for scheduling the hearing. I have with me my wife, Jane Anne, and my daughter, Bridget. Our two oldest daughters--Jennifer, who is working in Paris at this time, could not come, and my second daughter, Kate, just started a new job last week and didn't think she could ask for time off the first week of her employment, and so she couldn't make it either. I also have my sister, Colleen George, here, and her husband, David, and their two daughters, Anne and Sarah. I also have a lot of friends here, and I am not sure who all is back there, but I just want to recognize Dan McDermott, who has been a good friend. I know others who have come in. Members of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts who I have worked with are here. Frank Sabak, Ralph Avery, Bill Rule, Kevin Gallagher, Mark Evans are all here, and I very much appreciate their attendance and their support. Senator Cantwell. If you would like to make an opening statement? Judge Melloy. I don't have any opening statement other than to again extend my appreciation for the opportunity to appear before you.

Well, with that, I think that what we will do is give members an opportunity to ask questions, maybe alternating, since the Senator from Iowa is here. But I think I will start, Mr. Melloy, with a question about personal privacy. Prior to September 11, this issue was really one of the top issues of concern for Americans on a variety of issues. They were concerned about the intrusion of people into their most personal decisions and information. They were concerned about government maybe intruding. They were concerned about how businesses handled their consumer information. They were concerned about how information might be attained about them. Could you describe for me what you think the key elements of the Federal right to privacy are? Judge Melloy. Well, I think the key elements, Senator, are, first of all, that a person have knowledge about what is being put on the Internet, if that is what we are talking about, or being disseminated through some type of clearinghouse; and, secondly, that they not only have notice about what is being put out there and being made available to the general public, but then they have some meaningful opportunity to file objections or make some type of statement that would allow them to have that information not disseminated. I have had some experience in this issue through our Bankruptcy Administration Committee that I chair. We have been very concerned about confidential information that goes out on the Internet when we post court documents. Much of that information contains some pretty sensitive information. We have been concerned about identity theft that might result from posting that type of information on the Internet and we have taken some measures to address those concerns, and it is something that, as I say, I have had some experience with and I think we have addressed it in that context. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Yes, thank you very much. At times, Federal judges' deeply-held personal views or their views of the law and the Constitution can conflict with the constraints of judicial precedent. How should a judge resolve the differences between his personal views and stare decisis? Judge Melloy. Senator Grassley, stare decisis should always control. If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed for the position on the Eighth Circuit, I will be bound by my oath to follow the decisions and dictates of the United States Supreme Court, and I fully intend to do that. Senator Grassley. Could you define judicial activism for me? I know it is a pretty elementary question, but I always like to get judges' views on that. Judge Melloy. Well, I suppose everybody looks at it somewhat differently, Senator, but basically I think judicial activism can be best summarized as looking beyond the text of the statute or the Constitution, whatever it is the court may be interpreting, and to then try to superimpose one's own personal philosophy or views or what a person may believe is an appropriate social policy onto the case and, as I say, take it outside the text of the statute. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Senator Kyl, do you have any questions? Senator Kyl. Thank you. Just one, Madam Chairman. Having graduated from both junior high school and high school in Davis County, Iowa, I should be an advocate of the two Iowa candidates here. Judge Melloy. I appreciate that, Senator. Senator Kyl. I just had one follow-up question to Senator Grassley's. As a member of the court of appeals, of course, the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court is controlling in all situations, except some. What circumstances, if any, do you think are appropriate for an appellate court judge to overturn precedent within that judge's circuit? Judge Melloy. You are not talking about--I am not sure I understood the premise of the---- Senator Kyl. I am talking about the appellate court's--the Eighth Circuit's precedent, I should say. Judge Melloy. An appellate court should overrule the precedent of its own circuit, I think, very sparingly, but if the circuit has gotten it wrong before, then we clearly have a duty to revisit the issue. In our circuit, the rule is that one panel is not allowed to overrule the decision of another panel. If a panel believes that another panel has incorrectly decided a case, then the judges can at that point call for a rehearing en banc, have the entire circuit revisit the issue, and if the case was originally decided incorrectly, overrule the decision. I think that is an appropriate approach and it is the one that I certainly would follow. Senator Grassley. May I ask one more question? Senator Cantwell. Go ahead, Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I am a believer and have promoted legislation and got some of it adopted that would promote alternative dispute resolution. To what extent have you had experience with alternative dispute resolution, and do you believe in it, that you would use it more? I don't know exactly from the Eighth Circuit promotion as opposed to district judges, but the extent to which you would use that. Judge Melloy. Well, maybe I could answer the second part first, Senator. It is my understanding that there is much utilization of alternative dispute resolution at the circuit court level. The Eighth Circuit does have a settlement mediator and does try to see if there is any opportunity to settle a case even after it is on appeal. But, by definition, by the time a case gets on appeal, there has already been a trial, so the opportunities are much less for alternative dispute resolution at that point. Going to the first part of your question, we do have an alternative dispute resolution plan in our district. We make extensive use of magistrate judges as settlement mediators or settlement judges. We use outside mediators. We encourage the lawyers to hire private, or go to private mediation, if they prefer that. And so we do provide a number of different opportunities, and I think it is something that is very worthwhile and is something that should definitely be encouraged both in terms of the efficiency of the court's ability to handle cases as well as costs and delay to the litigants. Senator Grassley. And as a judge, you have done that? Judge Melloy. Yes, on many, many occasions. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. Mr. Melloy, as a district court judge-- and this is an issue that Senator Harkin brought up, but I am sure you will be familiar with--as a district court judge, you have handled numerous criminal matters and are familiar with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and mandatory minimum sentences. Do you believe that there are particular cases where Federal judges should have more discretion to diverge from the guidelines than is currently being allowed by statute? Judge Melloy. Well, if I could break that down into two parts, Senator, let me say this. The case that Senator Harkin made reference to in his comments actually was a mandatory minimum case. The individual who was charged and convicted of the single bullet had been convicted on six prior occasions of burglaries, three of which were of post offices. And under the armed career criminal statute, there was a mandatory 15-year minimum which was what I was required to impose, and the Eighth Circuit upheld that sentence. Having said that, I think there are certainly cases where mandatory minimums have been imposed where I wish I had more discretion, and Yurkowsky is probably one of them, quite frankly. As far as the Sentencing Guidelines are concerned, however, there is much more discretion within the guidelines to depart, and there have been cases where I have felt somewhat constrained, but I have also found that in most cases where I really felt there was a compelling need to go outside the guidelines, there was sufficient latitude to depart. So I don't have any serious problems with the guidelines. There are some things that I might change. There are probably some things a lot of judges would change, but basically I don't have a big problem with the guidelines. I think it is the mandatory minimums that become more difficult when you superimpose those onto the guidelines. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. As a district court judge, you have served on the Eighth Circuit's Gender Fairness Task Force. Judge Melloy. Yes. Senator Cantwell. I don't know if there is any correlation to all the women in your family in that. Judge Melloy. There is, as a matter of fact. [Laughter.] Senator Cantwell. The task force issued a report in 1997 that outlined the challenges and opportunities that would ensure equal opportunity for women judges and attorneys and court personnel. Could you tell the committee what you learned in the process on the task force about the recommendations of getting more women in the judiciary and in and around our circuit courts? Judge Melloy. That was a very, very worthwhile project for me and one I enjoyed very much and I think I learned a lot from. On the plus side, we found that things had dramatically improved for female attorneys over the 10 or 15 years prior to the date we were doing the study. We heard many, many female attorneys who would tell the horror stories of the old days when they first got out of law school 10 or 15 years before we did our report. So there had been dramatic improvements, and that, of course, was the positive side of the report. The report and the study also showed, however, that there were definitely some areas that we needed to improve. One of them was in the area of accommodations to women--all attorneys, but particularly female attorneys. Many attorneys were concerned that judges were not as sensitive to the needs of issues such as pregnancy leave, child care responsibilities; that sometimes hearings had to be rescheduled because of sudden emergencies with day care providers, and that judges needed to be more sensitive to those issues. We also found that there were some real problems with what female attorneys felt were civility within the legal system, more so outside the courtroom in the deposition and discovery setting than within the courtroom, but that was also an area that we found some definite problems. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Any other questions from my colleagues? Senator Grassley. I might say one thing. A person maybe you overlooked or he wasn't here when you acknowledged friends of yours that were in the audience, former Iowa Representative Tom Talke, is here. Judge Melloy. Well, I am sorry I did. I didn't realize Tom was here, but he is a very, very good friend of mine and I appreciate very much his attendance. I did not realize he had come in and I very much appreciate his being here. Senator Grassley. That is all I have. Senator Cantwell. Well, Mr. Melloy, thank you for time before the committee. I know that we will have an open record for other members to submit questions, if they have them, and I know you will submit your answers back quickly to those. We appreciate your time and your family's time in being here today. Judge Melloy. Thank you again, Senator. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Let's move now to the district court nominees, if they could all come up together--Richard Leon, Jay Zainey, James Gritzner, Robert Blackburn, and Cindy Jorgenson. If you could, before you sit down, stand up so I can swear you in. If you will raise your right hands, do you swear the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Gritzner. I do. Judge Blackburn. I do. Judge Jorgenson. I do. Mr. Leon. I swear. Mr. Zainey. I do. Senator Cantwell. Please be seated. I think maybe by our seating arrangement there that we have determined the process of individuals. So if the nominees would like to take the opportunity to introduce their family members that are here and any other special guests, why don't we start with you, Mr. Gritzner. STATEMENT OF JAMES GRITZNER, OF IOWA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA Mr. Gritzner. Thank you, Madam Chair. My wife, Zoe, is here with me today. Our son, Zack, is a student at Central College, in Pella, Iowa. He is impressing his father by not missing any classes today. And I am also pleased that Michael Pratt is here. Michael Pratt is the son of Judge Robert Pratt, who, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by the committee, will be a colleague of mine, and I am pleased that Michael is here as well. Thank you for that opportunity. [The biographical information of Mr. Gritzner follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.039 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.040 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.041 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.042 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.043 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.044 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.045 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.046 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.047 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.048 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.049 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.050 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.051 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.052 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.053 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.054 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.055 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.056 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.057 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.058 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.059 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.060 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.061 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.062 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.063 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.064 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.065 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.066 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5707A.067 Senator Cantwell. Mr. Blackburn, would you like to introduce anyone? STATEMENT OF ROBERT BLACKBURN, OF COLORADO, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Judge Blackburn. I would. Before that, I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank you and Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley and Kyl and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for affording us this unique and privileged opportunity, after what has been certainly a humbling, sobering, and deliberative process. I am pleased to have with me today my wife and partner of now near 25 years, Connie Blackburn. Connie was born and raised for a time in Iowa and she wanted me to go on the record for her in support of the two Iowa nominees, as well. [Laughter.] Judge Blackburn. Seated with her is my father, Ed Blackburn, who is more than just my father, certainly a friend, and for the last 10 years he and I raised beautiful registered Black Angus cattle together and survived economically to talk about it. He is here. Deeper in the audience is a friend and former colleague of mine, Scott R. Foncannon, Esquire, and his daughter, Sarah. Until recently, Scott practiced law in southeastern Colorado and appeared frequently before my court. He has recently transitioned with his family to the State of Maryland, and I can truly say that if all judges had the kind of attorney that Mr. Foncannon is before them, they would indeed be blessed and their jobs made much easier.

Ms. Jorgenson. STATEMENT OF CINDY JORGENSON, OF ARIZONA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA Judge Jorgenson. Yes. First of all, I want to thank you so much for the opportunity to be here today. I have many family members here from various States and I really appreciate their support. First, my husband, Don, and my two children, Tyler, who is 16, and Andrew, who is 13. They are reluctantly dressed in their shirts and ties and they are here today. It is their first visit to Washington, so we are going to spend the next few days touring around. Also, my parents are here, Richard and Annamaria Kelly, and this is a very special place for them because they met in Washington, D.C. My father is a graduate of Annapolis and my mother worked at the Italian embassy, and they were in those situations when they met here. I also have numerous cousins. Here, on the far right, my aunt--first, my aunt, Francis Kelly. She is here from New York. Marty Kelly Patel and her husband, Bhogi, they are here from New Jersey. Alice Kelly Enright; she is here from Washington. Jack Kelly is here from Philadelphia. Mary Kelly is here from Connecticut, and then Dr. Steve Kelly is here from New York. So I really appreciate the support of all my family members.
