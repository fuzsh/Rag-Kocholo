        "text": "The current House Committee on Education and the Workforce was established on January 9, 2023. The Committee’s basic jurisdiction is over education and labor matters, generally. This includes oversight over matters related to higher and early education, workforce development and protections, and health, employment, labor, and pensions.\n\nThe first Committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Education and Labor, was established on March 21, 1867, in the aftermath of the Civil War and during the growth of American industry. On December 19, 1883, the Committee was divided into two standing committees: the Committee on Education and the Committee on Labor. On January 2, 1947, the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, again, combined the Committees and renamed it the Committee on Education and Labor. On January 4, 1995, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. On January 7, 1997, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce. On January 4, 2007, the Committee adopted its original name: the Committee on Education and Labor. On January 5, 2011, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce. On January 3, 2019, the Committee was renamed as the Committee on Education and Labor. On January 9, 2023, the Committee was renamed the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n\nCommittee Membership\n\nPast Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members\n\nThe Committee on Education and Labor was created on March 21, 1867.\n\nCommittee on Education and Labor (1867-1883)\n\nCommittee on Education (1883-1947)\n\nCommittee on Labor (1883-1947)\n\nCommittee on Education and Labor (1947-1995)\n\nCommittee on Economic and Educational Opportunities (1995-1997)\n\nCommittee on Education and the Workforce (1997-2006 )\n\nCommittee on Education and Labor (2007-2011)\n\nCommittee on Education and the Workforce (2011-2019)\n\nCommittee on Education and Labor (2019-2022)\n\nCommittee on Education and the Workforce (2023-)\n\nArchived Websites from Previous Congresses\n\nArchived Website from the 116th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 116th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 115th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 115th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 114th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 114th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 113th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 113th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 112th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 112th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 111th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 111th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 110th Congress: Democrats »\n\nArchived Website from the 110th Congress: Republicans »\n\nArchived Website from the 109th Congress: Democrats »"
