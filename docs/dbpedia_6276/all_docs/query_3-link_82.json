        "text": "Home is more than a structure…\n\nReflecting on his life in Springfield, President-elect Abraham Lincoln departed for his trip to Washington D. C. with\n\nbittersweet notes,\n\n“To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried.”\n\nIn this simple and eloquent statement, Lincoln exposed a profound understanding that home is more than a structure. It is a sense of self, shaped by the land and the community. Lincoln recognized that his experiences of life in Springfield and Illinois would influence the path he was about to lead during one of our nation’s most challenging periods.\n\nFor centuries the land that has become Illinois has been home. Here our region’s earliest indigenous residents built powerful, lasting communities. And for generations afterward, though immigration, migration, and settler colonialism, Illinoisans have changed the world\n\n. . . by starting at home.\n\nThrough their stories and objects, we invite you to explore our shared roots and what it means to truly find a place of belonging.\n\nFinding Home\n\nWe all seek a place to call home. Here, Illinoisans struggle to find ideal homes, and this struggle becomes a fundamental part of their identities.\n\nFinding Home\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nReagan Defines Home\n\nHome was an elusive concept for young Ronald Reagan. The only president born in Illinois, his childhood was marked by continual displacement. As his father sought work, Reagan’s family changed homes an astounding 7 times in 5 years—moving from Tampico to Chicago to Galesburg to Monmouth and back to Tampico, before finally finding stability in Dixon.\n\nWhite suburban Dixon became Reagan’s ideal home. He immersed himself in community life and his gregarious personality made him a popular resident. In high school and later at Eureka College, Reagan dove into extracurriculars, becoming captain of his football team and working as a community lifeguard. This idyllic, aspirational image of a white, middle-class life shaped his view of America and future politics. Reagan later called small town Illinois “a small universe where I learned standards and values that would guide me for the rest of my life.”\n\nFinding Home\n\nFamily Photo\n\nRonald Reagan with his older brother, his father and his mother.\n\nFinding Home\n\nReagan the Lifeguard\n\nPhoto from 1927 when Regan served as a lifeguard on the Rock River in Dixon, IL\n\nFinding Home\n\nThe Gipper\n\nRonald Reagan as American football player George Gipp 'The Gipper' in a publicity portrait from 'Knute Rockne All American' 1940\n\nFinding Home\n\nRonald Reagan's Sweater\n\nReagan's letterman sweater from Eureka College\n\nCourtesy Eureka College\n\nFinding Home\n\nRonald Reagan's College Yearbook\n\nReagan's college 1921 yearbook from Eureka College\n\nCourtesy Eureka College\n\nFinding Home\n\nJoseph Jordan\n\nPullman, a Home for Workers\n\nJoseph Jordan decided to leave behind the violent racism of the Jim Crow South. In the 1880s, he led his family out of Virginia and found work as a teamster for the Pullman Palace Car Company. Joseph, his wife Martha, and their children made their home in a rowhouse in the town of Pullman.\n\nCompany founder George Pullman created the town to rent homes to workers like Jordan who enjoyed access to parks, schools, and entertainment. The town even had indoor plumbing with a sewage system that made Pullman one of the cleanest towns in America. George Pullman envisioned the town as an idyllic home for workers. The town fell short of this vision during the economic depression of 1893, as Pullman decreased wages without lowering rents. His refusal to meet with a delegation of workers resulted in a nationwide strike in 1894. Though not perfect, Pullman was home to Joseph and Martha Jordan for the rest of their lives—Martha passed in 1923 and Joseph followed in 1940 at the age of 79.\n\nFinding Home\n\nJordan Family\n\nJoseph Jordan is third from the left in this family portrait\n\nFinding Home\n\nPullman Factory\n\nInterior of the Pullman manufacturing shop\n\nFinding Home\n\nPullman Homes\n\nStreet view of the original Pullman homes\n\nFinding Home\n\nRitta DeFreitas\n\nMadeira's Central Illinois Exiles\n\nIn the mid-1800s, hundreds of Portuguese residents on the island of Madeira, off the coast of Morocco, converted to Presbyterianism. This created conflicts with their Catholic neighbors, so they set out to build a safer community in the English Protestant colony of Trinidad. They soon began looking for a less tropical location where they could live more independently. Central Illinoisans, especially in Springfield and Jacksonville, offered them a new home.\n\nAmong the Madeira exiles in Springfield was young seamstress Ritta de Silva. In 1856, she married Francisco (Frank) DeFreitas, a painter and fellow Portuguese Protestant. DeFreitas' clients included the Lincolns and she appears to have grown close to the future First Family—borrowing money and receiving two items from their home when they moved to Washington. Ritta and her fellow exiles carved out homes for themselves in Central Illinois and many of their descendants remain here today.\n\nFinding Home\n\nNewspaper Advertisement\n\nClassified ad for Ritta DeFreitas’s seamstress business.\n\nFinding Home\n\nThe Lincoln Home\n\nThe Lincoln family were clients of Ritta DeFreitas in their Springfield, Illinois, home\n\nFinding Home\n\nMadeira district\n\nMap of Springfield in 1855 showing the location known as “Madeira,” where Portuguese refugees settled.\n\nFinding Home\n\nLincoln’s Mirror\n\nAbraham Lincoln’s shaving mirror, given to Ritta DeFreitas when he moved to Washington.\n\nALPLM Collection\n\nFinding Home\n\nJean Baptiste Point de Sable\n\nChicago, Home in a Contested Space\n\nJean Baptiste Point de Sable was the first permanent non-Native settler of what is now called Chicago. A free, Haitian-born descendent of an enslaved African mother and a French father, he moved to the Chicago area from what is now Peoria in the 1780s. At his new home he cultivated a farm consisting of 30 head of livestock and nine buildings, including a chicken house and a dairy. By 1790, Point de Sable and his Potawatomi wife, Kitihawa (also known as Catherine), had created a prosperous home on the northern bank of the Chicago River.\n\nPoint de Sable constructed his home during the Revolution Era when Chicago was a contested space. He navigated a complicated existence between Native nations and the French, British, and upstart American empires. His kinship through marriage to the Potawatomi made his home a regional hub that welcomed both Native and European traders. Point de Sable likely foresaw the collapse of this cosmopolitan existence as the United States asserted its growing power in the region, and he sold his home in 1800, moving to French territory on the west bank of the Mississippi.\n\nFinding Home\n\nThe Kinzie house, built by de Sable in the 1780s.\n\nFinding Home\n\nRaoul Varin's imagining of the de Sable cabin in Chicago.\n\nFinding Home\n\nDuSable Receipt\n\n1796 transaction document showing Point de Sable making a barter payment on his account through his son-in-law\n\nCourtesy of St. Charles County Historical Society\n\nFinding Home\n\nBenjamin Driggs\n\nThe Mormon Quest for Home\n\nThroughout their history, the Latter-day Saints have searched for a home where they are free to practice their faith. In 1839, they fled persecution in Missouri to create such a place in Nauvoo, Illinois. Led by Joseph Smith, the Mormons formed a local government and set about building a massive temple. In all, they spent a million dollars on the structure. Yet it was never completed because less than a decade later internal and external forces had pushed them out of Nauvoo.\n\nThree generations of the Driggs family lived in Nauvoo during its short time as a Mormon sanctuary. Young Benjamin Driggs grew up there while his father Shadrach built wagons to help families moving further west. Benjamin became a folk hero for donating his own treasured wagon—made by his father—to workers building the temple. Like his fellow Mormons, Benjamin eventually fled his home in Nauvoo, living for a brief time in Iowa before settling in Utah.\n\nFinding Home\n\nMormon temple built in Nauvoo, Illinois\n\nFinding Home\n\nA children’s book about Driggs written by his son.\n\nFinding Home\n\nA bucket reportedly owned by Benjamin Driggs and used by him while helping rescue other Mormons migrating away from Nauvoo.\n\nCourtesy of The Church of Latter-day Saints\n\nFinding Home\n\n\"Free\" Frank McWorter\n\nBuilding a Free Home\n\nAmong the many freedoms stripped from enslaved Black Americans was a stable sense of home. Indeed, the very concept of home became contorted as enslaved families faced harsh living conditions and the constant threat of forced separation and removal. Yet, despite these obstacles, some people took risks to secure their freedom and build a home\n\n“Free\" Frank McWorter was one such person. Enslaved until his 42nd year, he earned enough money “hiring out” himself to purchase his freedom. Over time, more and more members of the family earned their freedom in this way and then in turn purchased freedom for others. McWorter moved from Kentucky to Illinois in 1830 and settled on 80 acres in Pike County. He did well, eventually expanding his holdings and apportioning part of them into the community of New Philadelphia—the first American town legally platted by a Black person. The biracial community McWorter built offered the same sense of freedom and home to others that he had carved out for his own family.\n\nFinding Home\n\nNew Philadelphia daily life.\n\nFinding Home\n\nA map of New Philadelphia.\n\nFinding Home\n\nNew Philadelphia Table\n\nA table built by Solomon McWorter, Frank McWorter’s son, at New Philadelphia.\n\nCourtesy of the McWorter Family\n\nFinding Home\n\nFinding Home Question:\n\nHow many times in your life have you moved to a new house / apartment?\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nDiscovering an ideal home has always been a process of imagination. These stories show people taking an imaginative leap to recraft what home means to better meet their needs.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nR. Buckminster Fuller\n\nLess is More\n\nIt took seven hours to build R. Buckminster “Bucky” Fuller’s home in Carbondale. The new home used the conservationist design that had made Fuller famous – a geodesic dome that was easy to build, could withstand great weights, and required few resources. Comprised of 60 isosceles-triangle plywood panels, Fuller’s unique Carbondale home was the only dome he ever lived in and owned. The one downside to the geodesic home, his wife Anne claimed, was that “you could not hang paintings because they would be just sort of dangling out from the curve.”\n\nThough Fuller’s design is most recognized as the key feature of Walt Disney’s Epcot Center, the geodesic dome was only part of Fuller’s larger vision for humanity. He was adamant that “man can be a success on this planet” and Earth’s resources were adequate to take care of everyone who called it home for generations to come.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nBlue Prints\n\nDesign for the Fuller Dome Home\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nDome Home\n\nA \"dome home\" under construction inspired by Fuller's concepts\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nFuller Dymaxion Car Replica\n\nThis example of Fuller's 1933 Dymaxion Car #1 demonstrates his forward-thinking design prowess\n\nCourtesy of the Lane Motor Museum\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nFuller Design Model\n\nA model of Fuller's design for a geodesic sphere created by Charles B.

In 1961, Margaret Burroughs and her husband Charles transformed their Chicago home into such a place – the first iteration of the DuSable Museum. At that time, there were few outlets for Black Americans to explore art and history from their perspective, and Burroughs paved the way by carving her own path.\n\nBorn in Louisiana, Burroughs moved to Chicago as a child, eventually earned degrees at Chicago Normal College (now Chicago State University) and the Art Institute. Making her career as an artist and educator, Burroughs immersed herself in the broader Black intellectual activist community. Grounded in her activism to help form the South Side Community Art Center and her insistence on the teaching of Black History, Burroughs established the Ebony Museum of Negro History and Art (now DuSable Museum) in her home, which had once been a boardinghouse for African American rail workers. From the Museum’s beginning, Burroughs focused on collecting the material culture of Black History and would often place ads in The Chicago Defender soliciting artifacts. Burroughs’s pioneering work establishing the DuSable Museum became a roadmap for other Black History museums to follow, eventually leading her to co-found the Association of African American Museums.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nOriginal DuSable Museum\n\nThe original location of the DuSable Museum was in Margaret Burrough's home in Chicago.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nBurroughs in the DuSable Museum\n\nBurroughs (second to the left) leads a tour in the museum\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nMargaret Burroughs Art\n\nA linoleum-scratched print portrait of Harriet Tubman by Margaret Burroughs\n\nCourtesy of the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nFred Francis\n\nEnvisioning Accessibility\n\nFred Francis designed and built Woodland Palace in the 1890s as a home for him and his wife, Jeanette. He endeavored to make the house accessible for Jeanette, who suffered from tuberculosis, and since fresh air was considered important for treating her disease, he built Illinois’s first ever air conditioner. In the solarium, a room Fred dedicated to Jeanette, he created a system that cycled the air every minute.\n\nIndeed, Woodland Palace sprang from a place of love, but it was also a testament to Fred’s imagination. A mathematical and engineering genius, Fred created a refrigeration room that never rose above 50 degrees and designed a complex water filtration system that purified rainwater as it flowed underground through sand, gravel, and charcoal before reaching Woodland’s cistern. Above all, Woodland was a place for Fred and Jeanette to grow old together. When Jeanette passed, Fred honored her memory by installing a marble sculpture in the solarium.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nWoodland Palace\n\nFrancis' home exterior in Kewanee, IL\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nWoodland Palace Drawings\n\nFred Francis drew these architectural designs himself\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nFred Francis and wife Jeanette\n\nFred and Jeanette posed for this studio photo with his modified bicycle\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nFred Francis' Custom Bicycle\n\nFred adapted this bicycle to carry his wife to church as well as construction materials\n\nCourtesy of the City of Kewanee\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nRobert Todd Lincoln\n\nRobert Retires\n\nIn 1903, Robert Todd Lincoln purchased a 392-acre estate near Manchester, Vermont. The only one of Abraham Lincoln’s four children to survive to adulthood, Robert had lived a busy life in the shadow of his father’s reputation and his family’s enormous grief. All these factors made home an elusive idea for Robert, as his personal and professional obligations often forced him into an exceptionally itinerate life.\n\nThe estate, which he called Hildene (old English for hill and valley with stream), became Robert’s refuge for the remainder of his life. There he found the privacy he had always sought, overlooking his favorite golf course. Yet Robert also found solace in claiming one of America’s founding myths—the nobility of the farmer. Although a large estate with a Georgian-revival mansion, Robert defined his new home as a farm, where he owned about 40 cows. As he pointedly told a friend, “I am now a Vermont farmer! and beginning to enjoy life.”\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nHildene\n\nThe gardens and rear facade of Hildene\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nRetired Life\n\nRobert Todd Lincoln playing golf in his later years.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nHildene Place-Setting\n\nA place-setting from Hildene inscribed with Robert Todd Lincoln's initials.\n\nALPLM Collection - Gift of Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, 1976\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nSusan Lawrence Dana\n\nHeiress of the Prairie (Style)\n\nSusan Lawrence Dana’s extravagant lifestyle was fueled by heartache. She became an heiress upon the 1901 death of her beloved father and chose to renovate his Springfield home to cater to her progressive lifestyle. For that, Dana hired burgeoning architect Frank Lloyd Wright and he transformed the structure into a masterpiece of modernity. The grandiose result embodied their partnership and Dana’s multifaceted identity as she hosted women’s rights activists, orphans for story time, and local celebrities at parties.\n\nWright’s vision and architectural style are apparent throughout the entire home, but each room was built to complement Dana’s passions, ideals, and unlimited budget. From the local lumber used to structure the home to the motif of butterflies—referencing her as a “social butterfly”—neatly woven throughout the house, Dana’s various roles are constantly apparent to visitors. Wright captured the essence of the Midwestern landscape through his Prairie Style and Dana’s progressivism in the home’s design.\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nDana Thomas House Gallery\n\nInterior of the gallery space and barrel ceiling\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nDana Thomas House Exterior\n\nThe unique front entrance as designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nSusan Lawrence Dana\n\nPortrait of Susan Lawrence Dana in front of her home c. 1915\n\nEnvisioning Home\n\nDana / Wright Art Table and Art\n\nA Frank Lloyd Wright table design for displaying Dana's artwork because his architectural plan did not allow for hanging anything on the walls.

These stories show the power family has to create and remake homes.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nMichelle Obama\n\n“We Were Their Investment”\n\nMichelle Robinson Obama called the White House her home from 2009-2017 but grew up in an apartment of less than 800 square feet on Chicago’s South Shore. It was the second story of her Great Aunt Robbie’s house. Robbie was a piano teacher, and the sound of her students playing often filled the home. Michelle and her brother Craig shared a room with a makeshift partition providing limited privacy.\n\nYet the smallness of the Robinson home in part reflected a choice made by Michelle’s parents, Fraser and Marian. Instead of investing their modest income in a house, they chose to invest in their children. Michelle and Craig thrived in this environment, with both eventually attending Princeton University. After receiving a law degree at Harvard, Michelle returned home to Chicago where she worked as a lawyer and later invested in her own family.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nRobinson Family\n\nFraser and Marian Shields Robinson and children, Craig and Michelle\n\nFamilial Home\n\nSchool photo\n\nYoung Michelle Robinson Obama at Bryn Mawr Elementary School.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nMichelle Obama's Piano Trophy\n\nA trophy won by Michelle (Robinson) Obama as a young girl for her piano playing\n\nFamilial Home\n\nCahokia Commoner\n\nThe Mississippian Home\n\nBetween about 700-1200 CE, a group of Indigenous tribes – now commonly referred to as Mississippians – built a vast trading network across the Mississippi Valley and American Southeast. The hubs for this network were communities built around earthen mounds, potentially housing thousands of people. The largest was Cahokia, located near present-day Collinsville. At its peak between 100-1150. As many as 40,000 people lived there and in the surrounding communities, making it one of the largest cities in the world.\n\nWomen ran Cahokia homes cooperatively. Their houses often surrounded plazas and courtyards, indicating they traversed the lines between households easily, and nearby residents intermingled with and supported each other. Thus, the people of Cahokia likely viewed their homes as extending outside their walls to the broader community. In doing so, they provide one of our earliest glimpses of people conceptualizing living spaces in the Illinois Country.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nCohokia Mounds\n\nMural painted of Cahokia Mounds by Lloyd K Townsend.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nCahokia Mounds\n\nPainting by William R.

Having mentored and shared an adulterous relationship with James Jones while he wrote From Here to Eternity in the aftermath of World War 2, Handy then founded a “writers colony” in nearby Marshall to mentor young aspiring authors.\n\nHandy immersed her all-male colony residents in a spartan, masculine world of writing. They lived on strict daily schedules, with only limited weekly “leave” from the grounds. After weeks of copying literary works by famed authors, the men then split the afternoons. Through its 1950s lifespan, the colony’s unique concept of home – shaped almost entirely by Handy’s vision of an ideal, rugged male writer – produced over a dozen books, including four adapted into Hollywood films. The colony ended with Handy’s death in 1964.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nHandy Colony\n\nThe barracks at the Handy Colony\n\nFamilial Home\n\nLowney Handy and James Jones\n\nLowney Handy with James Jones (right) at the Handy Colony.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nFrom Here To Eternity\n\nSwedish version\n\nFamilial Home\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nFrench version\n\nFamilial Home\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nDutch version\n\nFamilial Home\n\nJane Addams\n\nThe Heart of Hull-House\n\nHull-House stands as a testament to the progressive social campaigns that its affluent co-founder Jane Addams orchestrated. A converted mansion, which eventually expanded into a 13-building settlement complex housing low-income, mostly European immigrant Chicagoans, Hull-House also provided women with skills and education to break into male-dominated fields and support for low-income mothers. Hull-House staff advocated for women’s right to work and a safe home environment, which were vital components of Addams’s identity as she helped shift conversations about poverty away from moral rebuke to focus more of social welfare.\n\nA queer woman, Addams carved an unconventional path for herself by maintaining a long-term relationship with fellow Hull-House benefactor Mary Rozet Smith. For Addams, home was a person and where she could be herself completely. Outside of her home, there was always a risk of society rejecting her for who she loved. Addams’s private domesticity and her philanthropic work show how she believed women should be loved and respected within their own home, regardless of status or sexual orientation.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nThe Hull House\n\nFounded in 1889 on Chicago's Near West Side\n\nFamilial Home\n\nJane Addams and Mary Rozet Smith\n\nJane Addams never married and never had children yet was in a long-term relationship with her life partner Mary Rozet Smith.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nJane Addams bronze bust\n\nA 1964 bust of Addams by Lawrence Taylor, commissioned by the Illinois General Assembly to commemorate her 100th birthday.\n\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\n\nFamilial Home\n\nElizabeth “Buffie” Ives\n\nSiblings Fashion a Home\n\nElizabeth “Buffie” Ives had always been close with her brother Adlai Stevenson, even at their childhood home in Bloomington. Early in life while their father was often away, they found a sense of home in each other. Even the lifelong nickname “Buffie” grew from Adlai’s childhood mispronunciation of her name. After Buffie married Earnest Ives, she and Adlai remained close confidantes. It was a relationship built on an unbreakable foundation.\n\nWhen Adlai became Illinois’s governor in 1949, his marriage was already under stress and completely fell apart later that year. Buffie stepped in to fulfill the formal duties of first lady as her brother’s hostess, spending much of her time at the Illinois Governor’s Mansion. A major part of this role included furnishing and redecorating the Mansion. Her eye for decorating added comfort to their new surroundings, but the enduring bond between sister and brother made it a home.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nBuffie and Adlai\n\nBuffie Ives and her brother Adlai Stevenson in the governor’s mansion.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nAdlai and Buffie\n\nAdlai Stevenson and Buffie Ives.\n\nFamilial Home\n\nStevenson-Ives Christening Gown\n\nA christening gown worn by Buffie and likely by Adlai.\n\nCourtesy of the McLean County Museum of History\n\nFamilial Home\n\nFamilial Home Question:\n\nAside from the actual structure, what is another concept that you most associate with home?\n\nSurviving Home\n\nHome is not always a comfortable place.

He then lived with his grandmother, Marie Carter, who owned three houses in the city – two brothels and a nightclub. While there is hardship embedded in his story, Pryor was acutely aware of the absurdity inherent in it and its broader context, especially that his skin color could deny him the same rights as a white person. Pryor’s comedy career pushed boundaries to expose the absurdity and made him one of the most influential comics in history.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nPryor's Home\n\n300 Block of N.

Growing up in relative opulence due to profits from the labor of enslaved people in Lexington, Kentucky, Mary spent much of her adult life trying to reclaim that sense of comfort and position. She and Abraham’s Springfield home became an expression of Mary’s ambition and domestic priorities—literally growing the longer she lived in it, including the addition of an entire second floor.\n\nIn Washington, Mary obsessed over the Executive Mansion and worked hard to make its appearance match its status after years of neglect. Yet Abraham’s assassination disrupted everything, and Mary never again reclaimed her sense of domesticity and stability. Mary resented the unwanted attention drawn by her widowhood and as a figure of controversy. To escape her immense grief and anxiety, Mary even relocated to Europe. Yet the comforts of home continued to elude her as she continued to move from place to place, including a tragic, forced stay in an insane asylum.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nThe Lincoln Home\n\n413 South Eighth Street at the corner of Jackson Street in Springfield, IL\n\nSurviving Home\n\nMary and children\n\nMary Lincoln with sons Willie (left) and Tad (right).\n\nSurviving Home\n\nMary's Memento\n\nA pocket watch with its mechanical parts removed that Mary used to carry photographs of her husband and children.\n\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum,\n\nGift of Alice B.

Their homelife was shattered by John’s death in 1969 from lung cancer at 41 years old. Johnson’s children, as well as neighbors, suffered from a variety of illnesses that made her suspect the factories surrounding their home were endangering their health.\n\nAfter conducting her own research, Johnson discovered that not only was Altgeld Gardens built on a toxic industrial waste dump and surrounded by 50 landfills (as she called it, the “toxic doughnut\"), but that political leaders refused to intervene on behalf of low-income Black families anywhere in the city. Johnson founded the People for Community Recovery (PCR) initially to address tenant issues but pivoted after discovering that her community had the highest cancer rates in the region. She organized her neighbors against polluting companies and the Chicago Housing Authority, which resulted in key victories, such as the new health clinic, asbestos removal, a moratorium on new or expanding landfills in Chicago, and extending water and sewage service. Johnson mentored young activists, including her daughter Cheryl, who now serves as PCR’s executive director, and President Barack Obama.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nRecognition\n\nPresident George H. W.

When she married in 1947, the breadwinner husband and wife with kids at home was still widely considered the middle-class ideal.\n\nFriedan began interrogating this ideal after the birth of her second child while also balancing her career as a journalist. She surveyed her Smith College classmates and Friedan’s findings led her to write The Feminine Mystique, in which she critiqued white, middle-class women’s roles in 1960s society. In her book she asks, “Who knows what women can be when they are finally free to become themselves? Who knows what women’s intelligence will contribute when it can be nourished without denying love?” The book became a sensation, causing women around the world to reexamine their own ideas of home and limited gender roles.

She was 16 – the perfect age to jump into the thriving Black nightclub scene across the Mississippi. “East St. Louis had action” she would later recall. “It never seemed to stop.” Bullock became part of that action when she pushed her way onto the stage during a performance by Ike Turner’s band – immediately becoming its new lead singer.\n\nIke and Anna’s partnership shaped the direction of American music but also immersed Anna – renamed Tina Turner to better market the act – in a horrifying home life dominated by Ike’s physical, sexual and psychological abuse. Tina tried to build a family home with Ike and their four children, but his abuse only grew until she walked out in 1976. Tina had to restart her career but soon reemerged as one of America’s biggest music stars and set about building a happier and healthier home life.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nIke and Tina\n\nTina and Ike Turner performing at the Imperial Club in East St. Louis.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nTurner Family\n\nIke and Tina Turner with their four children.\n\nSurviving Home\n\nTina Turner's Dress\n\nA dress Turner wore during a 1982 appearance on The Tonight Show.\n\nCourtesy of the Tina Turner Museum, West Tennesse Delta Heritage Center\n\nSurviving Home\n\nSurviving Home Question:\n\nWhich of the following events would most likely cause you to leave home?\n\na.

In the final year of the Civil War, 39-year-old Louisa Phifer balanced caring for her 7 children (including patriotically named newborn Atlanta Sherman) with managing the family’s farm near Vandalia, as her husband George served in the 32nd Illinois Infantry. The couple wrote frequently, and Louisa’s letters are a mix of anxiety over George’s fortunes and updates on the farm.\n\nIn one letter, Louisa frets she will become a widow if George doesn’t keep himself safe. In his reply, he can only encourage her to “show the spirit of a soldiers wide.” Yet Louisa’s effective management of their home is also clear as she reports on crop yields, well repairs, and sale prices. Like many women on the home front, Louisa’s life was a constant series of challenges to avoid personal or economic disaster.\n\nReporting Home\n\nPhifer Cabin\n\nInk sketch of the Phifer cabin, drawn by Mary Phifer Stone.\n\nReporting Home\n\nLouisa and Child\n\nLouisa and Atlanta Sherman\n\nCopy of the original ambrotype Louisa mailed in a letter to her husband George Phifer.\n\nReporting Home\n\nBrothers\n\nWashington Irving and Simon Bolivar\n\nCopy of the original ambrotype Louisa mailed in a letter to her husband George Phifer.\n\nReporting Home\n\nGeorge and Ulrica\n\nGeorge Aurelius and Ulrica\n\nCopy of the original ambrotype Louisa mailed in a letter to her husband George Phifer.\n\nReporting Home\n\nLetter from Louisa to George\n\nTranscription page 1 :\n\nVandalia Fayette Co Ills March 8th /65\n\nDear Husband & Father\n\nWe seat ourselves this evening to answer your very kind letter of the 4th which came to hand last night it found us all well & as far as I know the neighbors are all well with the exceptions of Colds which is common now you said it had rained a great deal there in the last ten days & that the river was very high it has rained a great deal here in the last two weeks by times and for 2 or 3 days past it has rained almost all the time it is raining torrents now but I suppose it is colder here than it is there the road is more than bad Father I will tell you who all has volunteered since the tax was levied first.

Born in Metropolis, a de facto Jim Crow town in a Northern state, Micheaux left for Chicago as a young man in 1902. He found work as a Pullman railway porter, and as he traveled the country, the vast prairies tugged at his imagination. He admired the “fine country homes so characteristic of the great middle west” and claimed a homestead in South Dakota. For ten years, Micheaux farmed and battled the elements before losing his home to foreclosure.\n\nMicheaux had turned to his new passions – writing and filmmaking – and the search for home haunted his work. Micheaux’s first book, The Conquest, explores his experience in South Dakota. His films, often informed by his years homesteading, cathartically grapple with racism in the United States but maintain hope for the future. The name Oscar Micheaux now resides on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nReporting Home\n\nHomestead Claim\n\nOscar Micheaux’s homestead claim in South Dakota.\n\nReporting Home\n\nThe Homesteader\n\nAdvertisement for Micheaux’s first film, The Homesteader, in the Kansas City Sun newspaper.\n\nReporting Home\n\nFilm Director\n\nOscar Micheaux with his film camera.\n\nReporting Home\n\nMieczyslaw Haiman\n\nForging a Polish America\n\nMieczyslaw Haiman spent his life forging the idea of the United States as a second Polish homeland. Born near Lviv in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1888, Haiman emigrated to the United States in 1913. After years of writing poetry and editing Polish language newspapers, he embarked upon a career mapping the historical connections between his ancestral homeland and the U.S as librarian for the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (PRCUA). As he grew the PRCUA’s collection, he became the founder, first archivist, and curator of the Polish Museum of America in Chicago.\n\nAs archivist and curator, Haiman seized an opportunity to physically link Poland to his new American home. In September 1939, five months into the New York World’s Fair, the cloud of war loomed over the festivities as Germany invaded Poland. Determined to preserve the Polish items at the Fair, Haiman and his colleagues purchased three-fourths of the Polish Pavilion’s exhibits. They remain in the Polish Museum’s collection where Haiman continued his work identifying objects and writing to ensure the storied of Polonia were preserved and widely shared.\n\nReporting Home\n\nCreating a Museum\n\nPolish Museum of America employees: Mieczyslaw Haiman,\n\nDr. A.Wolanin, and Sabina Logisz.\n\nReporting Home\n\nPolish Pavilion\n\nPolish Pavilion at New York World’s Fair.\n\nReporting Home\n\n“Kolednicy” (“Carolers”) Sculpture\n\nSculpture by Karol Tchorek from Polish Pavilion at the 1939 World’s Fair.\n\nCourtesy of The Polish Museum of America\n\nReporting Home\n\nDon Alonzo Spaulding\n\nRemaking Places\n\nDon Alonzo Spaulding spent much of the 1830s traveling and surveying land in Illinois – dividing it based on the grid system. This survey method created townships and ranges split into 640-acre sections that ignored natural boundaries and artificially flattened territory to make it easier to understand for prospective settler colonizers.\n\nNative nations like the Potawatomie had made Illinois home for generations before the existence of a single 640-acre square on a survey map. These maps helped rationalize Native places into unoccupied territory ready to be claimed by white settler colonizers. Spaulding was part of this process. He prepared land for white settler colonization in the wake of the violent removal of Native peoples.\n\nReporting Home\n\nSurveying Map\n\nSpaulding’s map of Illinois that aided him while surveying.\n\nReporting Home\n\nCompass\n\nSpaulding would have used a survey compass like this one to map territory in Illinois.\n\nReporting Home\n\nMartha Douglas\n\nEnslaving the Home\n\nMartha Martin grew up the daughter of Robert Martin – Congressman and one of the richest enslavers in North Carolina, claiming more than 800 African America people as property. The enormous wealth accrued from forced labor afforded Martha a robust education and access to some of the most powerful suitors in America. Among them was Stephen A. Douglas of Quincy – a fast-rising-star when he married her at her father’s North Carolina slave labor camp in 1847.\n\nThe Martins also oppressed and enslaved Black people at their Mississippi slave labor camp, which they offered to Douglas as a dowry. Douglas declined because of the political implications, but Martha claimed as inheritance the Mississippi slave labor camp the following year. Neither Stephen nor Martha ever lived there, but Stephen was an active participant in its maintenance – including supervising the violent oppression and sale of enslaved people. Their situation presents a stark image of an antebellum white enslaver’s conception of home as a remote location where residents were claimed as mere chattel property.\n\nReporting Home\n\nStephen A.

Angry white neighbors had thrown it to stop her family from desegregating Chicago’s Washington Park subdivision. A lawsuit was filed against the Hansberrys. The case concerned racially restrictive housing covenants, which barred Black Americans from leasing or purchasing land in the subdivision – a common tool of de facto racial segregation reinforced by banks and real estate agents. The dispute reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1939, which affirmed the Hansberry’s right to live in the neighborhood.\n\nThis struggle traumatized Lorraine and she later poured that trauma into the script of “A Raisin in the Sun.” Set entirely in a South Side apartment, it tells the story of a Chicago South Side family navigating the inherent racism of 20th Century American life and the affect it has on the Black community. In 1959, it became the first play written by a Black Woman to be staged on Broadway and later as a Hollywood film – exposing thousands of audience members to the reality of Black home life in urban America.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nCritic's Circle Award\n\nJohn McClain presents the 1959 New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award for best play to Lorraine Hansberry.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nPress Coverage on Battle\n\nIllinois State Journal, February 12, 1939, article about the Hansberrys’ battle to remain in their Washington Park home.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nBest American Play\n\nFreeport Journal-Standard, April 10, 1959, article reviewing Hansberry’s production “A Raisin in the Sun.”\n\nFighting for Home\n\nThe Hansberry Decision\n\nThe State of Illinois’s received copy of the U.

Gibbs made Springfield his home for nearly half his life after working as a coal miner in Kentucky and Southern Illinois. Labor activism led him to pursue a career in law. Gibbs passed the bar exam in 1908 and established his office above Harry Loper’s restaurant on South 5th Street. Weeks later, Loper’s became the first business targeted by white aggressors during the 1908 Springfield Race Riots.\n\nMere blocks from the house Gibbs rented for his family on North 14th Street, rioters attempted to suppress the economic advancement of Black residents by looting and burning homes or prosperous families. After experiencing the terror of the riots, Gibbs remained in Springfield to fight for justice for all in Abraham Lincoln’s hometown. In 1929, Gibbs would join a local group to combat the Ku Klux Klan, a terrorist organization Gibbs denounced as a “menace to the administration of justice in the courts.”\n\nFighting for Home\n\nPassing the Bar\n\nNewspaper article announcing Gibbs’s admittance to the bar.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nDevastation\n\nExample of damage to a Black residence during the 1908 Race Riot in Springfield.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nAftermath\n\nAftermath of the 1908 Springfield Race Riot.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nRemains of a Dresser\n\nLimestone top and wheeled furniture casters from a dresser in a home burned in the 1908 Springfield Race Riots.\n\nCourtesy of the Illinois State Museum\n\nFighting for Home\n\nHarvey Clark\n\nA Home Denied\n\nChicagoans Harvey and Johnetta Clark planned to make a home in the suburbs in the summer of 1951. As Black Americans moving into an apartment in all-white Cicero, a process known as pioneering, they walked into a storm of hate and intimidation. The Clarks’ new neighbors stood across the street shouting racial slurs and throwing rocks. The next night the couple fled, and while the apartment sat vacant, a mob of approximately 4,000 white people ransacked the Clarks’ new home.\n\nIt took three days for the National Guard to put down the mob that rioted against the Clark family, but only the Clarks’ landlord and the rental agent were indicted, both for inciting a riot by renting a home to a Black family. The Clark family’s ordeal served as a reminder of northern hostility to migrating African Americans and echoed Illinois’s long history of “sundown towns” – places that violently enforced Black exclusion. Towns like Anna, Pekin, and Villa Grove often had warning signs, sirens, or a strong Klan presence that indicated that Black people should leave by sunset. Other places like Cicero posted no sign but enforced the racist policies just the same.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nThe Clark Family\n\nFighting for Home\n\nCicero Riots\n\nChicago Defender July 21, 1951, reporting on the Cicero Riots.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nTime Magazine cover, 1951\n\nFighting for Home\n\nTime Magazine article page 1\n\nThe July 23, 1951, issue of Time magazine including the Clark’s harrowing story.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nTime Magazine article page 2\n\nThe July 23, 1951, issue of Time magazine including the Clark’s harrowing story.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nIda B. Wells–Barnett\n\nFighting for Black Security\n\nIda B. Wells-Barnett threw herself and her powerful command of language into many causes, but they all reflected a desire for safe and secure Black homes. Born with a slave status during the Civil War and losing her parents due to a yellow fever epidemic at 16, she had a keen sense of the fragility of Black life in a white supremacist society. In 1884, Wells filed a lawsuit for unfair treatment after she was forcibly removed from a first-class train despite holding up a paying ticket. She channeled her frustration about segregation into writing as a prolific newspaper reporter and owner – criticizing racial discrimination and Jim Crow policies.\n\nAfter her friend Thomas Moss and two other Black businessmen were lynched, Wells began investigating other racial terror lynchings and writing about the injustice in her newspaper. As she reasons, “There is therefore only one thing left to do; save our money and leave a town which will neither protect out lives and property, nor give us a fair trial in the courts, but it takes us out and murders us in cold blood when accused by white persons.” Angered by these editorials, a white mob destroyed her newspaper office and she likely only survived because she was out of town. Wells did not return to Memphis, but continued to focus on documenting and describing the high rates of lynching since the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. In 1895, she married Ferdinand Barnett, a prominent civil rights activist, journalist, and attorney in Chicago, with whom she had four children. The couple’s Chicago home became a dual living and work space – with paternal responsibilities happening concurrently with Wells-Barnett’s crusade against white supremacy. In 1910, she provided a home space for other African Americans by founding the Negro Fellowship League – initially providing rooms for Black men but evolving into a center for Black uplift, social interaction, and activism.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nFamily Photo\n\nIda B.

The Sauk leader might have used that moment to reflect on his years in Saukenuk, a village near present day Rock Island where his people had lived since before the American Revolution. During the 1820s, white American colonizers increasingly pressured the Sauk to leave their home and move west of the Mississippi River. The U.S. government warned them not to return the Saukenuk after their winter hunt. Nevertheless, on this spring day in 1832, Black Hawk was coming home.\n\nKnowing that Black Hawk disputed the U.S.’s claim to Saukenuk, Governor John Reynolds of Illinois expected conflict and called up the state militia. This assumption of hostility put Black Hawk and the U.S. military on a collision course. Months of fighting ensued and led to Black Hawk’s surrender. While imprisoned, he dictated his autobiography, arguing that “land cannot be sold. The Great Spirit gave it to his children to live upon, and cultivate, as far as is necessary for their subsistence; and so long as they occupy and cultivate it, they have the right to the soil.”\n\nFighting for Home\n\nBattle Map\n\nMap of battles between Black Hawk and the U.S. Army.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nDepiction of Black Hawk.\n\nFighting for Home\n\nBlack Hawk’s Autobiography\n\nA first edition of Life of Black Hawk or Má-ka-tai-me-she-kiá-kiák Dictated by Himself.\n\nIN THEIR OWN WORDS\n\nThroughout the exhibit, you have read about how people conceived of home in Illinois.

The Land of Lincoln has offered the promise of jobs, housing, and a new way of looking at things. Rhythms and lyrics that carried these desires shaped a sound that has a global reach. This community of Illinois music reflects our American diversity: Spiritual and Blues, Country, Soul and Rock, International, and Hip–Hop and House.\n\nThis music helps us imagine who we are. And through the boundless energy of our imagination, we can reach our potential. In this beautiful hall in the center of the country, you will discover how the sound of the heartland lives within all of us.\n\nYou will celebrate who we can be when we sing a song together.\n\n– Dave Hoekstra\n\nGospel Music\n\nGospel Music\n\nGospel Music\n\nSound of Higher Ground\n\nThe sonic description of Gospel music is a harvest of all that comes from the heart: love, pain, memory and hope. The voice is the vessel to deliver the news. The voice can be solo or it can shape rainbows in a choir. Like a centerpiece on a table, this declaration is surrounded by instrumentation that ranges from an earth-shaking guitar to a cresting organ.\n\nVideo: Gospel Music in Illinois\n\nDr. Lena McLin\n\nGospel Music\n\nSound of Higher Ground\n\nChicago is the birthplace of American gospel. Chicagoan Thomas A. Dorsey — \"The Father of Gospel Music\" — wrote songs that touched Dr. Martin Luther King and Elvis Presley. Chicago's Soul Stirrers illustrated the bridge between gospel and soul music with young members like Sam Cooke, Lou Rawls and Johnnie Taylor. The Gospel spirit traveled into Chicago area homes from 1963 to 1984 through the popular Jubilee Showcase television show.\n\nAudio: The Preservation of Gospel Music\n\nThomas A. Dorsey\n\nGospel Music\n\nTitle\n\nThe Gospel sound is precious and timeless. It bends notes and walks the mainline. The most deliberate hymn contains a wide range of expression. All Gospel music contains unparalleled devotion.\n\nIt celebrates the purity of the soul.\n\nGospel Music\n\nMahalia Jackson 1957 Performance Contract\n\nBy 1957, Mahalia Jackson stood at the pinnacle of her career as the country's top gospel singer and was now on Columbia Records. This contract to perform at New York City's prestigious Town Hall in 1957 provides a glimpse into Jackson's famed business acumen, as she notes to increase her performance fees.\n\nCourtesy of Robert M. Marovich\n\nGospel Music\n\nCurtis Mayfield Performance Music Score of \"It's Alright\"\n\nCurtis Mayfield regularly included his 1963 Impressions hit, \"It's Alright,\" in his live shows. This is a marked-up performance \"Rhythm\" score for the song, which has been covered by Etta James, Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, Bruce Springsteen, and was recently featured in the Disney movie Soul.\n\nCourtesy of the Curtis Mayfield Estate\n\nThe Blues\n\nThe Blues\n\nThe Blues\n\nThe Blues Grew into its Wings in Illinois\n\nThe blues are a sparrow that flew north over the Mississippi River and landed in Illinois.\n\nOut of the nest came the electricity of Muddy Waters and the haunting call of Howlin' Wolf. Waters (McKinley Morganfield) carried the muscle of mother earth while Wolf (Chester Burnett) was possessed by a wicked bolt of \"Smokestack Lightning.\"\n\nThe Blues\n\nTitle\n\nChicago bandleader, songwriter, and bassist Willie Dixon dispatched his profound rhythms across the world. Dixon's sound was a passport to rock n' roll. Led Zeppelin never would have had \"Whole Lotta Love\" without Dixon's \"You Need Love.\" Dixon was also an early architect at Chess Records before flying off to Chicago's Cobra Records in the late 1950s where he produced nascent tracks for Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and Magic Sam.\n\nThe Blues\n\nSound of Higher Ground\n\nBuddy Guy's electricity and business acumen delivered the blues to a new generation while the Chicago-based record labels Alligator and Delmark Records preserved the blues for the future. The earliest recordings of boogie guitarist Hound Dog Taylor at Alligator (1971) and nine-string guitarist Big Joe Williams (in 1961) at Delmark kept the blues pumping through the advent of pop and rock music.\n\nThe Blues\n\nFender Stratocaster Guitar Owned and Played by Buddy Guy\n\nBuddy Guy's electricity and business acumen delivered the blues to a new generation while the Chicago-based record labels Alligator and Delmark Records preserved the blues for the future.

He carried a firearm for protection, for which he needed this 1960s-era firearms license. Also featured is his personal shaving brush with a wooden handle, a common item for someone born in 1910.\n\nCourtesy of Bettye Kelly\n\nThe name of the track"
