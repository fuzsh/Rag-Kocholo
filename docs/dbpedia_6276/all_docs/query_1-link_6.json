Wilson Goode claimed victory Tuesday night in his effort for re-election.\n\nBut his opponent, former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo, who was trailing narrowly, refused to concede defeat until the vote is officially certified later this week.\n\nWith 1,733 of 1,739 precincts reporting, the unofficial tally was: Goode...332,396 (51%) Rizzo...318,527 (49%)\n\nIf Mr. Goode's lead holds up when the official tally is made, the 49-year-old Democrat will have achieved a triumphant recovery from severe political adversity and won a second four-year term as Mayor of the nation's fourth most populous city.\n\nIn other elections around the country Tuesday, the governorships of Kentucky and Mississippi remained in the hands of the Democratic Party. [ Page B5. ] ''Let's make one thing absolutely clear,'' Mayor Goode told a crowd of exuberant supporters late Tuesday night. ''We have won this election, and I am the Mayor for four more years.''\n\nSpeaking a few minutes earlier, Mr. Rizzo said: ''I'm not going to concede tonight, by no stretch of the imagination. If he beats me, I'll wish him well. But he hasn't beaten me. I'd hide my head if I won by that margin and I was an incumbent.''
