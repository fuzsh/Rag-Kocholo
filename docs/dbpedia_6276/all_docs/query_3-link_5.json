        "text": "Summary\n\nAfrican Americans were deeply involved in Virginia politics from the Civil War until the first years of the twentieth century. Prior to 1865, only adult white men were legally able to vote in Virginia. With the abolition of slavery, African American men began to fight for their full rights as citizens. In Norfolk, in May 1865, they cast votes for the first time. Though, local electoral boards refused to count them. The first election in which Black men voted and those votes were counted was for delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1867–1868. They elected 24 Black representatives. Beginning in 1869, African Americans began to be elected to the General Assembly. Most ran as Republicans and later as members of the biracial Readjuster Party. Some black politicians were more radical than others, but they generally advocated for Black civil rights, free public schools, and a refinancing of the state’s large antebellum debt. African American women were probably active behind the scenes, especially in campaigns supporting public schools. Formal black participation in Virginia politics after the Civil War peaked in 1881. The Readjusters swept statewide offices and took control of both houses of the assembly. In 1888, John Mercer Langston won a contested election for House of Representatives. He became the first African American from Virginia to serve in Congress and the only one prior to 1993. In the years that followed, however, white supremacist Democrats fought for control again. They passed various laws to reduce Black suffrage, which culminated in the Constitution of 1902 and a 50% decrease in the state’s voters. African Americans largely did not participate again in formal state politics until after World War II (1939–1945).\n\nIn This Entry\n\nFurther Reading\n\nContributor: Brent Tarter\n\nAttempted Black Suffrage in Norfolk\n\nBefore the Civil War was over, African Americans in Norfolk began discussing the legal and political effects of the abolition of slavery. The right to vote almost certainly was on their agenda. In February white residents of Norfolk who had remained loyal to the Union proposed to restore civilian city government. African Americans petitioned the president and the commanding officer of the U.S. Army to request that civilian government replace military government only on a “loyal and equal basis.”\n\nOn April 4, 1865, the men in Norfolk founded the Colored Monitor Union Club. They demanded “the right of universal suffrage to all loyal men, without distinction of color, and to memorialize the Congress of the United States to allow the colored citizens the equal right of franchise with other citizens.” At the same time, African Americans were organizing in Hampton, Williamsburg, and Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe Black men of Norfolk went even further. City residents called for an election of one state senator and two members of the House of Delegates to represent the city. Norfolk’s Black residents decided to vote in that election. More than 500 of them assembled in the Bute Street Methodist Church. Their number doubled before the end of the day. They sent small groups to polling places in the city to find out whether election officers would receive their votes.\n\nOfficials in three of the wards refused. But in the city’s Second Ward, they agreed to record the votes of Black Norfolk men on separate sheets. In small groups, 354 men went to the Second Ward throughout the day and voted for white candidates who pledged to support African American suffrage. The 712 residents of the other three wards remained at the church and unanimously recorded their votes for the same candidates.\n\nWithout counting the votes of the Black men, the candidates for whom they voted finished a second in the three-way races for each of the seats in the assembly. Had the African American votes from the Second Ward been counted, those candidates would have won the election easily. Had all of the 1,066 votes from Black men been counted, the candidates who pledged to support Black suffrage would have won by almost 900 votes.\n\nOn June 5, members of the Norfolk organization and other local Black citizens met at the Catharine Street Baptist Church. They created an “Address From the Colored Citizens of Norfolk, Va., to the People of the United States.” It was printed that autumn with a record of the creation of the union and the attempt of the men to vote in May.\n\nThe long address to their “Fellow Citizens” began,\n\nWe do not come before the people of the United States asking an impossibility; we simply ask that a Christian and enlightened people shall, at once, concede to us the full enjoyment of those privileges of full citizenship…which must be the desire of every patriot.\n\nThe authors explained the many ways in which freedpeople were denied participation in the legal system. They explained that they weren’t asking for “expensive aid from military forces,” or “overbearing State action;” They declared, “…give us the suffrage, and you may rely upon us to secure justice for ourselves, and all Union men, and to keep the State forever in the Union.”\n\nColored State Convention in Alexandria\n\nSome white Virginians promoted suffrage for African Americans. They realized that the only chance that they had to remain politically competitive was to give Black men the vote. In Alexandria, they formed the Virginia Union Association. Its aim was to generate political support for changes in Virginia’s political culture. The association agreed to “secure the elective franchise to our colored population, as soon as it can be safely done.”\n\nMore than sixty African Americans met in a Colored State Convention in Alexandria. Several of the leaders of the Norfolk and Richmond organizations attended the state convention. It adopted several resolutions and public statements. These declarations insisted on full citizenship and voting rights.\n\nAfrican American Suffrage and a New Constitution\n\nNo member of the General Assembly agreed to grant the vote to African Americans. Governor Pierpont was opposed to allowing African Americans to vote because many former slaves were not literate. In 1867, Congress, through the Reconstruction Acts, enforced military rule on Virginia and the other former Confederate states. Congress required that each state adopt a new state constitution. It also required that when the army conducted elections for members of the conventions, it permit African American men to vote and to run for seats in the convention.\n\nBefore the election in Virginia, 105,832 African American men registered. In fact, many white men who opposed Congressional Reconstruction decided not to register. Others were still legally unable to register and vote because of their Confederate pasts.\n\nOn election day, October 22, 1867, a significant number of registered white voters refused to take part. African Americans cast more votes than white men by a large margin. In most cities and counties white men voted against holding the convention at all. Black men voted overwhelmingly in favor. Almost all Black men voted for candidates who favored making significant reforms to the old state constitution. Most white voters opposed those candidates. As a result, men who supported radical reform won a majority of seats in the convention. Among them were 24 African Americans, many of whom had lived in slavery until the spring of 1865.\n\nThe convention voted to include a new section in the constitution that granted the vote to adult African American men. Delegate Thomas Bayne, of Norfolk, made a notable speech in favor of the section. He had escaped from slavery in Virginia before the Civil War and become a doctor in New England. Bayne returned to Norfolk and in May 1865 presided over the conference that decided that Black men would vote. His 1868 speech in favor of granting all men the right to vote reflected the beliefs held by most African American men at that time about their new place in the American nation. Paraphrasing Thomas Jefferson and citing the Declaration of Independence, Bayne stated that all men were created equal in the eyes of God, and that no men had the right to deprive any other men of God-given rights.\n\n“Has a man the right to live?” Bayne asked the other delegates. “Was he born a freeman? Did God make man a slave? I say, no. If God never made man a slave, man was born free, and had a right to liberty. That is the principle of the Declaration of Independence … I rejoice to-day that it is my privilege to stand on this floor and say that we are now beginning to live where we can recognize God as the great giver of all good gifts, and among them, the right of suffrage.”\n\nFirst African Americans in State Government\n\nAfrican Americans were unsure about whether to allow former Confederates back into politics soon or at all. White Republicans were divided on the same question, with some favoring the move as a way of making peace. In October 1869, Virginia held its first election held since the ratification of the new constitution. Radical reformers suffered a serious defeat. White members of the Conservative Party supported a moderate Republican ticket for the statewide offices. This helped to defeat a radical Republican ticket that included an African American candidate, Joseph D. Harris, for lieutenant governor. Conservatives also won large majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. Nevertheless, thirty Black men won election to the assembly. 18- 20 Black men won in each of the legislative elections in 1871, 1873, and 1875.\n\nDuring those years, almost all of the African American men active in Virginia politics were part of the Republican Party. Some of them supported more radical proposals than others. Between 1867 and 1895, nearly 100 Black Virginians served in the two houses of the General Assembly or in the Constitutional Convention. Many of them had grown up in slavery. But some had been free before the Civil War, and others came of age afterward. Some of the members of the convention had little or no education. But by the 1880s most of the legislators were educated and well qualified. A few had very successful political careers. They served their localities in the assembly for several terms and became influential leaders in the Republican Party.\n\nFor instance, Peter Jacob Carter, an army veteran from Northampton County on the Eastern Shore, served four terms in the House of Delegates. He campaigned for Republican candidates throughout eastern Virginia. He was a prominent delegate to the party’s state conventions. Other men with long and successful careers included Ross Hamilton, who served in the assembly for twenty years (see also the three Norton brothers of Williamsburg and York County—F. S. Norton, Daniel M. Norton, and Robert Norton). Other African Americans had briefer and less notable political careers. Some fell victim to increasing racial prejudice and political difficulties.\n\nWhite Backlash and Coalition Building\n\nMany white Virginians remained opposed to African American suffrage. In 1876 the Conservative majority in the General Assembly submitted two constitutional amendments. These amendments were designed to reduce the number of African American voters. One made payment of a poll tax a requirement for voting. The other disfranchised men convicted of small offences such as stealing chickens. The amendments were based on a realistic understanding that many poor Black men could not afford to pay the tax. They also were based on a racist belief that Black men were naturally less honest than white men.\n\nThe amendments functioned as intended. The number of voters in the state declined by almost 10% immediately after ratification of the amendments. The amendments contributed significantly to the reduction in the number of African Americans who won election to the General Assembly.\n\nDespite the new barriers, Black Virginians voted and successfully ran for public office in increasing numbers during the second half of the 1870s and 1880s. The Readjuster movement provided the motivation for Black political action. Readjusters proposed solutions to the debt that Virginia had created before the Civil War. They also proposed to redirect money to the public schools that had been used to pay down the debt. African American and many poor white Virginians supported the Readjuster proposals to preserve the public school system.\n\nIn 1879, Readjusters won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. But a Conservative governor vetoed their debt-reduction bill. Before the general election of 1881, about 300 African American Republicans convened in Petersburg. They discussed whether to make a formal alliance with the Readjusters. It was an unruly meeting. Personal conflicts among the leaders and differing political priorities led to clashes in the beginning. Many men did not want to lose their political identity as Republicans.\n\nWith strong support from African American voters, the Readjusters won all the statewide offices in 1881 as well as larger majorities in the assembly. Early in 1882 the General Assembly passed a bill that significantly reduced the cost of paying the public debt. The assembly also passed many reform measures. It restored funding for the public schools and appointed a new state superintendent of public instruction. The new state leader replaced most of the county and city school superintendents with men who were more sympathetic to the education of African Americans. The assembly abolished the whipping post as a punishment for African Americans. It also established Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (later Virginia State University), the state’s first public college for African Americans. It created the first mental hospital for Black Virginians. Those achievements would not have been possible without the support of African American voters and their political leadership.\n\nAfrican Americans contributed greatly to the success of the Readjusters and to Republican presidential candidates throughout the decade. The Readjusters were never a Black-majority party. Many white men eagerly supported the Readjusters, too. As a result, some of them adopted a more egalitarian attitude than most white Virginians ever had. Such attitudes posed a threat to white supremacy, as did the coalition’s political power. This motivated the Democratic Party to respond.\n\nShortly before the 1883 legislative elections, a street fight in Danville between white and Black men helped tip the election against the Readjusters and Republicans. Democrats labeled this a “race riot.” Democrats also suggested that such violence was the logical consequence of increased Black influence in politics. Two years later, the statewide ticket of Readjusters and Republicans were defeated. This ended the most active period of political reform in nineteenth-century Virginia.\n\nDisfranchisement\n\nNearly all of the African American Readjusters continued to participate in the Republican Party while the Readjuster Party existed. Many of them remained active afterward. Some white Readjusters joined the Republican Party, too. Mahone, a former Confederate and leader in the Readjuster Party, found support amongst many Black voters. But his leadership style caused division at times. In 1888, for instance, when John Mercer Langston ran for the House of Representatives as a Republican, Mahone refused to support him. He arranged for a white Republican to run in the same district. As a result, a Democratic candidate won the election. Nevertheless, Langston successfully challenged the outcome and briefly served in Congress. He was the first African American from Virginia to do so and the only one prior to 1993.\n\nIn 1884, the Democratic majorities in the General Assembly passed the Anderson-McCormick Act. It replaced all officers of election in the state and authorized the assembly to appoint a three-member electoral board for each city and county. That guaranteed that white Democrats would be in charge of all elections in the state. They often looked the other way when election tampering occurred. Sometimes they actively conspired with party officials. These officials stuffed ballot boxes, intimidated voters, or made African Americans or known Republicans stand in long lines that prevented some of them from voting before the polls closed.\n\nTen years later Democrats passed the Walton Act, which introduced the “Australian ballot” to Virginia. The state printed the names of all candidates on a ballot and required voters to mark a line through at least three-quarters of the name of each candidate they wished to vote against. That allowed vote counters to disallow ballots cast for Republicans or African Americans and to count votes for Democrats even if not marked as clearly. It discriminated against African Americans, who were more likely than white men to be unable to read or write.\n\nThe number of African Americans who voted and who won elections began to decline. They were the last Black legislators in Virginia until 1968. In Richmond, white political leaders redrew the city’s electoral district boundaries in the 1890s to create white majority districts. That made it impossible for African Americans to win municipal government elections. By the end of the century very few African Americans still held local offices anywhere in the state. Republicans in Congress had by then largely given up trying to force southern states to abide by either the letter or the spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment. White men in Virginia and in most other states continued to exclude African Americans from politics.\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1900–1901\n\nThe all-white Constitutional Convention of 1901–1902 completed the almost total destruction of African American political activity in Virginia. It turned back nearly all of the democratic reforms in the state constitutions of 1851, 1864, and 1869. The convention reintroduced the poll tax as a requirement for voting. This created new forms of political corruption and also significantly reduced the number of adult, male Virginians who could vote. The constitutional changes disfranchised about 90 percent of the few African Americans who still voted in Virginia and about 50 percent of the white voters.\n\nThe white-supremacist Democratic Party retained control of both houses of the General Assembly, as well as many state and local offices. From then until after World War II, very few Black Virginians ran for public office and only a very small number held minor local offices."
