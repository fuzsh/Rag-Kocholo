Thus he invested time and an unprecedented amount of money in political newspapers. This article investigates the primary pro-government newspapers and, as well as identifying the leading circle of political writers sponsored by Walpole, addresses the varied and complex arguments that appeared in their ‘leading essay’ each week for twenty years. After identifying some common but misleading historical representations of Walpolean political thought, the article examines the treatment of three broad philosophical questions – human nature, the origin, nature and extent of government, and political morality – so demonstrating that Walpole's spokesmen were not narrowly pragmatic. Subsequently, the article focuses upon the careful pro-government response to the common charges that Walpole corrupted the political system and betrayed traditional whig values. In doing so, the article highlights the skills of some underrated eighteenth-century political writers and, more importantly, emphasizes the union of government and ideology in Walpolean political thinking.\n\nType\n\nArticles\n\nInformation\n\nThe Historical Journal , Volume 37 , Issue 2 , June 1994 , pp. 289 - 317\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0018246X00016484 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 1994\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

After his death in May 1736 it was reported that ‘a Pension of about £400 per annum… reverted to the Government’: London Evening Post, 3 June 1736, no. 1333. Ralph Courteville received an annual pension of £800 – see his letter to the duke of Newcastle, [?] Dec. 1754: BL, Add. MS 32, 737, fo. 543.\n\n11\n\n11 In his study of Walpolean and Pelhamite thinking, Reed Browning analyses five individuals whom he describes as ‘representative Court Whigs’.

This perhaps accounts for the fact that some historians, most commonly citing the London Journal during James Pitt's heyday in the early and mid-1730s, have tended to associate the more sanguine view of man with the Walpolean whigs: Browning, , Court whigs, p. 182.Google Scholar\n\n29\n\n29 LJ, 26 Aug. 1732, no. 687.
