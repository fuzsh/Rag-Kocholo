        "text": "W&L Law is fortunate to be honored by many notable alumni. Graduates of W&L Law include two Justices of the United States Supreme Court, seven presidents of the American Bar Association, two Solicitors General of the United States, Presidential Cabinet members, as well as numerous state governors, and United States Senators and Representatives. The law school has produced dozens of federal and state judges, including a former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and multiple state supreme court justices. W&L Law's alumni further include influential academics, business leaders, and distinguished attorneys. This achievement is particularly noteworthy given the law school's small size.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justices\n\nLewis Franklin Powell, Jr., Class of 1931, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1972-1987, Appointed by President Richard M. Nixon)\n\nIn 1992, the Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Wing was added to Sydney Lewis Hall and the Wilbur C. Hall Law Library at a dedication ceremony attended by Justice Powell and presided over by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. The Powell Wing houses the professional and personal papers and archives of Justice Powell, as well as other manuscript collections, rare books, and archives of the law school.\n\nJoseph Rucker Lamar, Class of 1878, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1910-1916, Appointed by President William Howard Taft)\n\nJoseph Rucker Lamar served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1886 to 1889, and also served as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia from 1903 to 1905. At the time of his appointment to the Supreme Court, Justice Lamar was only one of three Justices ever nominated by a President of the opposite party. Justice Lamar, together with Frederick W. Lehmann, was selected in 1914 to represent the United States at the ABC Powers Conference convened to avert a war over the Veracruz Incident. Justice Lamar's professional papers, including correspondence concerning his years as a Supreme Court Justice, are archived at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.\n\nSolicitors General of the United States\n\nJohn W. Davis, Class of 1895, 14th Solicitor General of the United States (1913-1918, Appointed by President Woodrow Wilson)\n\nJohn W. Davis is the named partner in the international law firm of Davis Polk & Wardell, LLP, a law firm formed in 1849. Over a 60-year legal career, Davis argued 140 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, 73 cases argued as Solicitor General, and 67 cases argued as a private lawyer. Lawrence Wallace, who retired from the Office of the Solicitor General in 2003, argued 157 cases during his career, however, many believe that few attorneys have argued more cases than Davis in the twentieth century. Davis is best known as the Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States during the 1924 presidential election, losing to Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. The W&L Law Annual Davis Moot Court Competition is named in his honor.\n\nDavis served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1921. He was the founding President of the Council on Foreign Relations, formed in 1921; Chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1922 to 1939, and served as American Bar Association President. Davis represented West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913.\n\nOne of Davis' most influential arguments before the Supreme Court was in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer in May 1952, now referred to as the Youngstown Steel case, when the Court ruled on President Harry S. Truman's seizure of the nation's steel plants. It had been predicted that the President's actions would be upheld. However, the Court decided 6-3 to uphold the injunction, and sided with Davis' arguments on the limits of executive power.\n\nThree years before his death at age 81, in Davis' final appearance before the Supreme Court, he unsuccessfully defended the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Briggs v. Elliott, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education. Briggs v. Elliott, 342 U.S. 350 (1952), on appeal from the U.S. Eastern District of South Carolina, was the first of the five cases combined into Brown v. Board of Education (1954).\n\nJohn Goode, Jr., Class of 1861, 3rd Solicitor General of the United States (1885-1886, Appointed by President Grover Cleveland as Acting Solicitor General)\n\nPresidential Cabinet Members\n\nJohn Otho Marsh, Jr., Class of 1951, Secretary of the Army (1981-1989 under President Ronald Reagan) United States Congressman\n\nNewton D.
