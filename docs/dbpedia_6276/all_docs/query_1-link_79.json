        "text": "In 1990, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, the face of the Iran-Contra scandal, found himself in the unusual position of being a convicted felon as well as a prodigious political fundraiser. Of sixteen original counts, a jury had convicted him of three: accepting an illegal gratuity, obstructing justice, and destroying documents. While awaiting sentencing and appealing, North traveled the country, charging $25,000 per speech to rapt audiences. Much of the money paid for his legal defense, but he also raised funds for conservative causes, and conservatives used his likeness and story to bolster their own fundraising. In April, one Republican operative dubbed him “the most marketable political commodity that I know of in the whole United States.”Footnote 1 In July, an appeals court vacated North's conviction on a technicality, and the divisive National Security Council official went on nearly to win the 1994 Virginia Senate race.\n\nNorth remained popular among conservatives and Republicans not despite his legal persecution but because of it.Footnote 2 From the moment he walked into Congressional hearings in 1987, North embodied a novel, winning New Right populist formula for turning potentially negative scandals into partisan political power.Footnote 3 The formula consisted of fashioning a narrative of victimization and shamelessness in four overlapping steps: first, denying the scandalous nature of Republican behavior and instead blaming the mainstream media and Democrats for “politicization”; second, fabricating “grassroots” support for a public figure and equating that figure's celebrity with impunity; third, community building and fundraising off martyrdom and demonization; and fourth, pardoning any offenses and erasing the memory of the scandal once it stopped reaping benefits.\n\nThe Oliver North saga marked an early manifestation of the post–Ronald Reagan New Right's political power within the Republican Party and American politics more generally. While North was a champion of President Reagan, his followers and handlers, in beliefs and methods, moved beyond his mainstream Republican appeal and instead foreshadowed the attack-driven, mass-marketed, and mendacious nature of the post-Reagan era pioneered by figures such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the 1990s and brought to full fruition by President Donald Trump in the 2010s. North's political ascent fed off the still-nascent political power of tools of mass outreach such as television and mass-mailing. The zealous man met the moment of Republican desperation for unadorned heroism in a seemingly immoral world, and the means to create, protect, and turn that moment into political capital helped define a new era of populist Republican politics marked by opportunism and denial. Understanding this New Right populist model helps explain how the party, since the 1980s, has remained a viable national entity despite its undemocratic practices and unpopular policies.Footnote 4\n\nHistorians have not yet fully explored the domestic political implications of the Iran-Contra episode, for instance its contribution to Republican Party methods. Scholars of the scandal—few of them historians—have struggled to sift through its mountainous paper trail and untangle its mystifying details of Swiss bank deposits, secret meetings, and violations of criminal statutes. In truth, the scandal's offenses were relatively simple. From 1984 to 1986, the Reagan administration, flouting the Boland Amendment passed by Congress, used government resources to fund and help direct the military strategy of the Contra forces against the leftist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Concurrently, in violation of U.S. laws and contrary to the president's stated policy of not negotiating with terrorists, the executive traded arms to Iran in hopes of freeing hostages held by Iranian-controlled terrorists and moderating the regime in Tehran. In late 1986, the press revealed these two covert schemes, and the White House discovered a diversion of funds by the National Security Council from the latter to the former, thus giving birth to the hyphenated Iran-Contra scandal.\n\nThis three-pronged scheme, which was investigated over the following years by a presidential commission, both houses of Congress, and Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh and hashed out in a dozen court cases, confounded and quickly bored mass American audiences. Most of the indictments that Walsh filed were not for Iran-Contra itself but for the lying to Congress and investigators and the obstruction of justice that followed, causing the scandal to recede even more in the public consciousness. As the scandal dissolved in 1992, journalist Richard Cohen feared “that the American public will continue to see Iran-Contra as the policy equivalent of quantum physics—hopelessly complicated and of interest only to specialists.”Footnote 5\n\nScholars who trudged through the minutiae of Iran-Contra drew valuable lessons, but ones unrelated to electoral politics. A first school, led by Harold Hongju Koh, wrote about its impact on national security policy formulation.Footnote 6 A second school, much more populous, focused on the constitutional tug of war between the legislative and executive branches, largely warning of the decreasing power of the former over the latter after gains by Congress in the 1970s.Footnote 7 Other historians have looked at other foreign policy facets of Iran-Contra—its origins and failures, its fit within the Cold War, its illustration of Reagan's style, and more.Footnote 8\n\nThe intersection of the domestic political aspects of Iran-Contra and the historiography of modern right-wing political movements thus remains underexplored. To be sure, that latter literature has grown rich and varied in the last decades, beginning with grassroots and social histories of conservatism.Footnote 9 Another trend has been to focus on individuals who galvanized public opinion, such as Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, and Reagan.Footnote 10 Historians have also charted the impact of the Right, new and old, on U.S. foreign policy.Footnote 11\n\nAmong other insights, historians of conservatism have chronicled the increasing sophistication of Republican arguments and tools for swaying American voters. Among those arguments was the accusation that liberal elites dominated policy making and the media, of which conservative causes were allegedly victims rather than beneficiaries.Footnote 12 The growing scholarship on Republican-led direct mail techniques, fundraising machines, and control over media and law belies this narrative, yet it cries out for specific episodes in which novel techniques drew on current events to jockey for electoral advantage.Footnote 13 The Oliver North story is one such episode.\n\nThe increasingly bountiful literature on the rise of the Right in America has yet to situate Iran-Contra within its core narrative of a successful political movement transforming charismatic but flawed characters into political assets. Many surveys on Reagan-era conservatism do not even mention Iran-Contra or North.Footnote 14 Histories of specific conservative institutions such as think tanks and of technologies such as talk radio also fail even to mention Iran-Contra.Footnote 15 Those that do mention the scandal do so in passing, as an embarrassing aberration delaying the otherwise steady triumph of the Right.Footnote 16 Such silences unwittingly reproduce the forgetting of Iran-Contra's scandalousness that Republicans wished for in the 1990s. Other histories briefly include North as a representative of the New Right, noting that his supporters were well to the right of Reagan and that avid conservatives faulted the Republican president for his “abandonment of the Nicaraguan Contras in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal,” as Marcus Witcher writes.Footnote 17 But there remains no appraisal of North's significance to either Republican or New Right politics.\n\nYet the North domestic political story presaged how the Republican Party, especially its New Right factions, would embrace scandal as a political strategy. In the Reagan years, the party had a lot of practice. Even absent Iran-Contra, the Reagan administration stands among the most scandal-ridden in American history. Major disgraces marred the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Savings and Loans industry, and the world of lobbyists. Once 1987 was over, the New York Times passed a damning judgment on the Reagan White House as “one of the most corrupt administrations ever.” In 1988, the Subcommittee on Civil Service counted over 225 Reagan appointees accused of criminal wrongdoing. “The amount of sleaze is awesome,” wrote the Times. “Precise comparisons to the [Ulysses] Grant, [Warren] Harding and Nixon Administrations aren't possible or necessary. The Reagan Administration rivals them all for official lawlessness, contempt for law, and playing loose with the truth.”Footnote 18 One journalist tallied 138 Reagan administration officials investigated, indicted, or convicted “for official misconduct and/or criminal activity. In terms of numbers of officials involved, the record of his administration was the worst ever.”Footnote 19 The actions of North and his collaborators in Central America and Iran dwarfed the outrages of other Reagan scandals."
