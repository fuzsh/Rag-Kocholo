In accordance with the practice in GAA competitions the term junior applies to the level of competition rather than the age group.[1] The grade is contested by Armagh, Down, Kildare, Laois, Meath, Roscommon, and the second team of Dublin.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Kay Mills Cup Camogie Finals\n\n3 Highlights\n\n4 Nancy Murray Cup\n\n5 Máire Ní Chinnéide Cup\n\n6 See also\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nHistory\n\nThe competition was established in 1969 for the New Ireland Cup. The name was changed to the Kay Mills Cup in honour of former player Kathleen Mills in 2010.\n\nIn 2006 the second teams of the first-tier camogie counties were removed from the competition. Since 2010 the competition has been officially, though not popularly, known as the Premier Junior Ireland championship.
