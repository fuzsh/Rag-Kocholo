Kind of always knew that, but when asked I always recount this version ðŸ˜Š\n\nSo is the other account true? That the hill was originally nicknamed Hill 60 after the Dublin Fusiliers that died in Gallipoli 1915? And was known as Hill 60 throughout the 20s and 30s?\n\nSo was this Hill 60 the left half of the the Cusack Stand?\n\nAnd was that half of the Cusack eventually renamed Hill 16? And when was that - 1936/37?\n\nAnd when was the Railway End renamed Hill 16?"
