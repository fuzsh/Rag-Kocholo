        "text": "History of the Game\n\nThe Camogie Association was founded in 1904. The first All-Ireland championship was played 28 years later in 1932 and was known as the Tailteann Games. Players now wanted to play in a competition of a higher standard than that which was played at club level.\n\nSeán O’Duffy a Mayo man donated a silver cup which is known as the O’Duffy Cup for the inaugural All-Ireland championship. Ten counties entered the championship that year which was organised on a open draw basis.\n\nThe first O’Duffy Cup\n\nThere are now five major cups to be won in different age categories:\n\nAll Ireland Senior Camogie Championship – O’Duffy Cup\n\nAll-Ireland Intermediate Championship – Jack McGrath Cup\n\nAll-Ireland Junior A Championship – Nancy Murray Cup\n\nAll-Ireland Junior B Championship – Máire Ní Chinnéide Cup\n\nAll-Ireland Minor A Championship – Síghle Nic an Ultaigh Cup\n\nKit\n\nPlayers wore gym frocks which covered their knees, long sleeved blouses, long black stockings, canvas boots and a belt or sash which went around the waist.\n\nPlayers now wear jerseys, skorts, knee high socks and boots.\n\nStyle of Play\n\nPlay was mostly on the ground so the shape of the hurley created to aid good ground strokes. Past records of scores show that players mostly scored goals and the majority of points recorded came from frees taken.\n\nNow play is in the air the majority of the time and points account for a large amount of scoring in most games.\n\nHere shows the difference in scoring since the first five years of the championship to the last five years of the championship. It can be seen that nowadays points are the most common form of scores.\n\n1932: Dublin/Galway: 3-2 to 0-2\n\n1933: Dublin/Galway: 9-2 to 4-0\n\n1934: Cork/Louth: 4-3 to 1-4\n\n1935: Cork/Dublin: 3-4 to 4-0\n\n1936: Cork/Louth: 6-4 to 3-3\n\n2014: Cork/Kilkenny: 2-12 to 1-09\n\n2015: Cork/Galway: 1-13 to 0-9\n\n2016: Kilkenny/Cork: 1-13 to 1-9\n\n2017: Cork/Kilkenny: 0-10 to 0-9\n\n2018: Cork/Kilkenny: 0-14 to 0-13\n\nThe Game Now\n\nThe game has developed greatly over the years. The Dublin teams from the fifties and sixties focused on team work, bringing it to a very high level which helped them to dominate the game.\n\nCork, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford evolved the game by bringing new levels of skill.\n\nPlayers brought a new higher level of fitness to the game as they choose to run with the ball more. They are greater athletes who have a great amount of skill, ball control and technique. The players take pride in representing their club and county."
