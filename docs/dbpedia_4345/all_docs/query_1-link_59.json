        "text": "Kerry defeated Tipperary by 4-14 to 0-6 in the Electric Ireland All-Ireland Minor Football Championship Final on Sunday September 20th at Croke Park.\n\nReport: Kerry blitz Tipperary in minor final\n\nALL-IRELAND MFC FINAL: KERRY 4-14 TIPPERARY 0-6\n\nBy Peter Sweeney at Croke Park for GAA.ie\n\nKerry eased their way to back-to-back All-Ireland Minor Football Championship titles with a big win over Tipperary in the final at Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThe Kingdom had a surprisingly poor underage record over most of the past decade, but their production line has really kicked into action. Under the management of Jack O’Connor, who guided the county to three Sam Maguire titles, they have taken the U18 crown two years in-a-row.\n\nIn his two seasons in charge Kerry haven’t lost a competitive match, they have won a perfect 12 from 12 and claimed two All-Ireland championships. This was O’Connor’s last match with the minors and next season he moves back up to the U21s to try to revive their fortunes at that grade.\n\nHis team oozed class and having done the dirty work during the first half the second period was largely exhibition-style football. It was tough on Tipperary, who have done such good work at underage football level over the past few years. Five of the starting team, and eight of the panel, were on the Premier County side that lost the All-Ireland minor final to Galway a fortnight previously. They showed brief flashes of the ability and grit that got them this far, with many of their points coming out of the top drawer. There just wasn’t enough of them coming to stop the onslaught.\n\nCentre-forward Alan Tynan, who was part of the hurling team and who won a Leinster Senior Cup with Roscrea in rugby this year, was particularly impressive and picked off two superb points. Tipperary were blown out of the water by Kerry in the Munster minor final back at the start of July so they would been keenly aware of the need for a good start. They were unable to manufacture this however and the Kingdom were on top from the off.\n\nIn the first five minutes Tipp hit two shots short, dropping into the arms of keeper Billy Courtney, hit the post with a close-range free and hit the post. This was the theme for the day for them as they slipped further and further behind. Kerry didn’t have their shooting boots on in the opening quarter either and when Tipp hit two points either side of the 15-minute mark it left them just two down, 0-4 to 0-2. Any hope that this might turn into a contest though were killed off on 18 minutes when Bryan Sweeney got the first goal of the game.\n\nA high ball into the danger area was broken down to the waiting Sean O’Shea, who knew exactly what to do. He fed Sweeney and the mobile full-forward made no mistake. Six minutes before the break Conor Geaney, a sparkling forward and first cousin of seniors Paul and Michael, appeared to shoot wide.\n\nBut referee David Gough ruled that he was bundled over just as he pulled the trigger and the penalty kick was awarded. Geaney sent keeper Charlie Manton the wrong way with a cool finish low to the right hand corner of the net. At this stage of the Munster final at Fitzgerald Stadium, Killarney Tipperary were nine points down. It was worse in Croke Park – 25 minutes gone and eleven down, 2-7 to 0-2.\n\nTipp’s main problems were around the middle of of the park, where they struggled to get hands on the ball, particularly from their own restarts. Kerry’s middle men Mark O’Connor and John Mark Foley, who both scored points from play in the first half, were dominant and some of their high-fielding was brilliant to watch. They laid the platform for a healthy 2-8 to 0-4 half-time lead.\n\nThe second half was a procession for Kerry, Geaney converting another penalty to bring his personal tally to 2-4, after Michael Foley got their third goal when he palmed home a Brandon Barrett centre.\n\n***\n\nScorers for Kerry: C Geaney 2-4 (2-0 pen, 1f); B Sweeney 1-1, Michael Foley 1-0, S O’Shea 0-2, J Duggan 0-2 (1f), M O’Connor 0-1, JM Foley 0-1, B Barrett 0-1, B Ó Seanacháin 0-1, S O’Sullivan 0-1.\n\nScorers for Tipperary: A Tynan 0-2, T Nolan 0-2, B McGrath 0-1, J Kennedy 0-1 (1 ’45’)\n\nKERRY: Billy Courtney; Darren Brosnan, Jason Foley, Tom O’Sullivan; Jack Moran, Andrew Barry, Gavin White; Mark O’Connor, John Mark Foley; Brian O Seanchain, Sean O’Shea, Brandon Barrett; Michael Foley, Bryan Sweeney, Conor Geaney\n\nSubs: Stephen O’Sullivan for Barrett (40); James Duggan for M Foley (46); Mike Breen for JM Foley (46); Daniel O’Brien for T O’Sullivan (46); Dara O Se for Brosnan (52); Graham O’Sullivan for Morgan (52).\n\nTIPPERARY: Charlie Manton; Tadhg Fitzgerald Jack Shehan, Tommy Lowry; Danny Owens, Liam Fahy, Emmet Moloney; Jack Kennedy, Tommy Nolan; Aidan Buckely, Alan Tynan, Colin English; Stephen Quirke, Brian McGrath, Brendan Martin\n\nSubs: Jamie Bergin for English (HT); Ross Peters for Buckley (HT); Morgan Irwin for Fitzgerald (BC, 43); Mark Kehoe for McGrath (45); G Whelan for Moloney (52); Conor Cashman for Martin (56).\n\nReferee: David Gough (Meath)\n\nFixture Details\n\n20.09.2015 (Sun)\n\nGAA Football All-Ireland Senior Championship Final\n\nElectric Ireland GAA Football All-Ireland Minor Championship Final\n\nPáirc an Chrócaigh 13:15\n\nCiarraí v Tiobraid Árann\n\nReferee: David Gough (An Mhí)\n\nTeam News\n\nThe Tipperary team to play Kerry in the Electric Ireland All-Ireland Minor Football Final in Croke Park on Sunday next, September 20th, at 1.15pm has been announced.\n\nComing on the back of an excellent win over Kildare in the semi-final, manager Charlie McGeever has made one change to the starting line-up from the last day with the fully fit again Stephen Quirke coming in at top of the right.
