        "text": "The Association has had 30 Presidents to date since its foundation including two Life Presidents.\n\nLife Presidents:\n\n1935-1951 Professor Agnes O’Farrelly (Cavan)\n\nBorn on June 24th, 1874 at Raffony, Virginia, Co. Cavan, Agnes became a noted Gaelic scholar, educationist, writer and champion of women’s rights. An executive member of the Gaelic League, she was a close friend of Douglas Hyde, first President of Ireland, and other leading personalities in the Irish Ireland movement.\n\nShe presided over the inaugural meeting of the U.C.D. Camogie Club and became its first President, a position she held until her death in 1951. She prevailed on her friend, Edwin Gibson, Lord Ashbourne, to donate the impressive Ashbourne Cup for intervarsity competition.\n\nOne of the most prominent women of her time, she was appointed Professor of Modern Poetry at U.C.D., held a seat of the Governing Body of the University and was elected to the Senate. Under the pen name ‘Uan Uladh’, she wrote two novels and books of poetry in the Irish language. With Mary Hayden, she campaigned for women’s rights in the universities. Together, they founded the Irish Association of Women Graduates. Agnes chaired the inaugural meeting of Cumann na mBan but withdrew at the time of the ‘Volunteer Split’.\n\nShe became more deeply involved in camogie affairs. Her voice carried weight. When she spoke, delegates listened, when she spoke in public, the newspapers picked it up and gave her words prominence. At a time when the Camogie Association struggled for recognition and acceptance, Agnes lent credence and status. She guided the Association through difficult times and had the title Life President of the Camogie Association conferred upon her in 1935.\n\nIntelligent, generous and an achiever, Agnes saw what needed to be done and did something about it. It was an indication of the esteem in which she was held that the President of Ireland, Seán T. O’Kelly, and the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, attended her funeral in November 1951.\n\n1999-2004 Sheila McAnulty (Down)\n\nBorn in Warrenpoint, Co. Down in 1916, Sheila was honoured with the title of Life President in 1999 in recognition of her unique contribution to the Camogie Association. She was the leading administrator in the Association for several decades. She rose from secretary of the Betsy Gray club in Warrenpoint to the Down County Board and Ulster Council, leaving her mark on all of them. Sheila’s qualities were recognised at national level and she was elected President of the Camogie Association in 1949. She made an immediate impact bringing a splintered Association together. Under her leadership, the Association consolidated and expanded. She was rewarded with a fourth year in the top post.\n\nOn completion of her term of office, she became Ard Runaí, a role she filled with astuteness, foresight and expertise from 1953 to 1975. Held in high regard by all, Sheila launched new ideas and encouraged others to do likewise. She passionately pursued the ideals of the Association. Sheila lent a sympathetic ear to inexperienced officials who sought help and placed them on the right path.\n\nAn articulate speaker, she could hold her own in any company. Well read, she possessed a deep pool of general knowledge which she put to good use in winning the All-Ireland Scór Question Time in 1996. Managing Director of a motor factors company, Sheila reached the top of her profession. When she retired from business, she enrolled as a student at Queen’s University and graduated with distinction. An ardent follower of Down football, she wrote ‘Ó Shíol go Bláth’, a history of Down G.A.A. Recognised outside the Association as a leading sports administrator, she was appointed to COSAC, the sports advisory council in 1970. She died on July 7th, 2004.\n\nPresidents\n\n1905 Máire Ní Chinnéide (Dublin)\n\n1911 Elizabeth Countess of Fingall (Meath)\n\n1923 Mollie Gill (Dublin)\n\n1942 Lil Kirby (Cork)\n\n1945 Agnes Hennessy (Cavan)\n\n1946 Sheila Horgan (Cork)\n\n1949 Sheila McAnulty (Down)\n\n1953 Lucy Byrne (Wicklow)\n\n1956 Lily Spence (Antrim)\n\n1959 Eilish Redmond (Dublin)\n\n1962 Crios O’Connell (Limerick)\n\n1965 Lil O’Grady (Cork)\n\n1968 Rosina McManus (Antrim)\n\n1971 Nell McCarthy (Dublin)\n\n1973 Nancy Murray (Antrim)\n\n1976 Agnes Purcell (Dublin)\n\n1979 Mary Moran (Cork)\n\n1982 Mary Fennelly (Kilkenny)\n\n1985 Mary Lynch (Monaghan)\n\n1988 Máire Ní Cheallacháin (Cork)\n\n1991 Brídín Uí Mhaolagáin (Dublin)\n\n1994 Belle O’Loughlin (Down)\n\n1997 Phyllis Breslin (Dublin)\n\n2000 Pat Rafferty (Dublin)\n\n2003 Miriam O’Callaghan (Offaly)\n\n2006 Liz Howard (Tipperary)\n\n2009 Joan O’Flynn (Kildare)\n\n2012 Aileen Lawlor (Westmeath)\n\n2015 Catherine Neary (Kilkenny)\n\n2018 Kathleen Woods (Armagh)\n\nMáire Ní Chinnéide:\n\nBorn in Dublin, Máire was educated by the Dominicans at Muckross Park.
