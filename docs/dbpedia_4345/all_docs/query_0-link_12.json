        "text": "References & Notes:\n\nNo record of the final found, but Clonguish are referenced as champions in an October 1911 report.\n\nClonguish v Edgeworthstown final fixed for 8th June 1913 but no record of result or winner.\n\nCompetition started in May 1914 and concluded with final in July 1915, replayed in September 1915.\n\nCompetition started in July 1916 and concluded in March 1917. See Note below.\n\nCompetition started in April 1917 and took two years to complete. Concluded in February 1919.\n\nCompetition started in July 1919 and concluded in April 1920.\n\nCompetition started in February 1922 and concluded in April 1923. (Longford is Longford Wanderers)\n\nCompetition started in November 1923 and concluded in October 1925. (Longford is Longford Wanderers)\n\nCompetition started in October 1925 and concluded in June 1926 with Granard v Mullinalaghta – Match abandoned.\n\nCompetition started in May 1927 and concluded in February 1928.\n\nCompetition started in October 1928 and concluded in May 1929 when Wanderers won by topping the table.\n\nCompetition started ~ July 1930 and finished with Granard topping the table in Oct 1931.\n\nCompetition started in Oct 1931 and continued thru 1932. Drumlish referenced as winners in 1932 year-end report. See Note below.\n\nNo record found of any competition for 1932. Likely due to fact that the 1931 competition didn’t conclude until well into 1932.\n\nCompetition started in September 1933 and finished in February 1934, with Drumlish topping the table. See Note below.\n\nCompetition ran into 1935. Drumlish beat Mullinalaghta in the top of the table tie decider in Nov 1935. See Note below.\n\nCompetition began but then SFC took over and there is no record of the League being completed. See Note below.\n\nMore on 1916 Title: The 1916 Senior League-Championship title was won by Granard Shamrocks who defeated Ardagh St. Patricks by 2 points to 1. This title had been incorrectly credited to Ardagh St. Brigid’s in previous rolls of honour and Longford GAA publications. When Ardagh and Granard met in the 1982 SFC final, this previous meeting was referenced and the article cited claims from others that Granard [Shamrocks] were champions that year and it was a league title that was won – both of which have proved to be completely correct. We found no evidence of the existence of a club called Ardagh St. Brigids.\n\nMore on 1931 Title: The 1931 competition saw Drumlish on course for the League title by around June 1932 (the competition flowed into 1932), with their final game scheduled against Ardagh, who were bottom of the table. The game was fixed in September 1932 and previewed as a 3rd round game. Drumlish won the game. No declaration of champions was made at that point but this was the only league game held between June 1932 and late 1933. Drumlish were then listed as League winners in 1932 year-end summary but this was for winning what was the 1931 competition. No evidence of a competition for 1932 was found.\n\nMore on 1933 Title: Also called the 1933-34 League. Competition spilled into the following year with games played in Jan and Feb 1934. Drumlish beat Granard in February 1934 to win the League as none of the other teams could catch them points wise. Granard play Mullinalaghta in the final game in March which had no bearing on the title itself.\n\nMore on 1934 Title: Also called the 1934-35 League. The 1934 League begins in March 1934, a week after the conclusion of the 1933 League which ended that same month in March 1934. St. Marys Granard lead the table for much of the 1934 competition which then spills into 1935. In May 1935 Drumlish defeat Granard to inflict a first defeat on St. Marys Granard and overtake them in the table with a game extra played. Granard are due to play Mullinalaghta in the final game, both sides level on points and the winner of which will tie with Drumlish for 1st place and a deciding game to determine the league winners. The 1934 League pauses from May 1935 while the 1935 League commences in June 1934. In October, the outstanding game for this league is played and Mullinalaghta beat Granard. Mullinalaghta (who appear to have been suspended during the league in late 1934) top the table with Drumlish and the deciding game is played on November 17th 1935 at Ballinalee which Drumlish win to take the 1934 title."
