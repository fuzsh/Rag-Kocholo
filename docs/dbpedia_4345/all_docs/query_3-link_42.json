        "text": "IN FRONT of more than 20,000 roaring onlookers, the greater majority of whom turned out to support the reigning All-Ireland and Munster Champions, it was with minimum fuss that Limerick accounted for The Cats.\n\nAhead 1-13 to 0-10 at the interval (with an opening goal from Barry Nash), Kiely’s outfit kicked for home when Aaron Gillane flashed to the net with a quarter-of-an-hour still to run on Leeside.\n\nGillane was a clear force on the field, racking up 1-7 throughout. Diarmaid Byrnes also contribued a handsome five points.\n\nThe men from the Shannonside walked home clear victors at the final whistle, giving Derek Lyng’s Kilkenny a 2-20 to 0-15 run for their money.\n\nWere it not for no fewer than 15 second-half wides, Kiely’s men may have come home with an even more impressive tally on the already gaping scoreline.\n\nIt represented a 14th League win for Limerick, adding to the previous triumphs of 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1947, 1971, 1984, 1985, 1992, 1997, 2019, and 2020.\n\nOnly minor ailments prevented Declan Hannon and Kyle Hayes from featuring in yesterday’s snug defeat of Kilkenny at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, according to manager John Kiely.\n\nThe pair had been listed to start in the half-back line but were replaced by Dan Morrissey and Colin Coughlan, respectively.\n\nRevealed Kiely: “Declan just has the flu and he’s had it all week. He’ll be fine next week and back in training.”\n\n“Kyle just got a minor strain on Tuesday night that didn’t respond well earlier in the week. He could have played today but obviously that wouldn’t be a wise decision.”\n\nThe loss of such colossuses may have diminished the winning prospects of many a side but Morrissey and Coughlan (who knocked one over the bar) slotted-in seamlessly.\n\nIn the absence of regular captain Hannon, two-time Player of the Year Cian Lynch ably deputised.\n\nLimerick also lost full-back Mike Casey through a High Injury Assessment, and this will be monitored in the coming days. His Na Piarsaigh clubmate William O’Donoghue was an enforced absentee through a one-match suspension.\n\nFor anyone keeping track, the already skimpy odds available on Limerick completing the four-in-a-row in the All-Ireland Senior Championship later this year have already been shortened by bookies to just 1/2."
