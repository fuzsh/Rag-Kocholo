        "text": "NWP Ulster Senior Camogie Championship\n\nSemi-finals: May 27: Down v Armagh; Antrim v Derry\n\nFinal: June 3\n\nDERRY\n\nManagement: John O’Dwyer, Gerard McCloskey and Movita Gallagher\n\nIT IS fair to say that Derry didn’t do as well as expected in Division 2 of the Littlewoods Ireland National League under their new management team, headed by Tipperary native John O’Dwyer. As beaten league finalists last season the expectation bar was high to start with but two wins, a draw and three defeats from the group that failed to produce either of the two finalists was disappointing.\n\nSlaughtneil’s retention of their All-Ireland senior club title ate into their plans; the twice postponed final extended the wait and it was only this week that the three Cassidy sisters and Mellon cousins joined the panel.\n\nIn their absence, everyone in the league panel got more game time and some benefitted and put down a marker for future reference.\n\nHowever the cruciate injury suffered by quality forward Karen Kielt is a blow to the panel – as well as to the player herself. On the plus side, another experienced player, Aileen McCusker, missed the whole of the league through injury, but has returned to training for the championship.\n\nAs winners of the Ulster senior championship in five of the last six seasons, Derry will be expected to retain the title, although the biggest threat to that run being extended is Antrim, the team they meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThen it is on to the All-Ireland Intermediate championship for June and July. They are placed in Group 1 with Carlow, Cork, Down, Laois and Wexford. I would be surprised if they did not emerge from this group to contest a semi-final in August with the game against Cork key to their progress.\n\nIn such a strong panel of experienced players, it is difficult to see a new star emerge to shine – but the return of Gráinne McGoldrick, the form of Áine McAllister and the experience of the Slaughtneil contingent can all gel together to create a run that could well end in Croke Park in September.\n\nExpectation: Ulster champions and All-Ireland Intermediate finalists\n\nLeague results:\n\nDerry 2-19, Armagh 2-6\n\nKilkenny 3-11 Derry 2-7\n\nDerry 2-9 Laois 4-5\n\nTipperary 0-9 Derry 0-1\n\nDerry 1-14 Dublin 2-11\n\nKildare 1-11 Derry 3-17\n\nDerry panel: Gráinne and Máiréad McNicholl, Dervla O’Kane, Niamh Quinn, Niamh McQuillan, Janet McGuckin, Aoife Quinn, Aine McAllister, Lauren McKenna, Kelly Marie Heggarty, Mary Heggarty, Eimear McGuigan, Teresa Bradley, Kathryn McNamee, Shauneen Donaghy, Aileen McCusker, Aoife, Brónagh and Éilís Ní Chaiside, Therese and Sinéad Mellon, Grainne McGoldrick, Niamh Boylan, Aoife Shaw, Rebecca Bradley, Aimee Devlin, Rebecca Ferguson, Caoimhe Glass, Roisin Cassidy, Karen Kielt\n\nANTRIM\n\nManagement: Aidan McKeown and Joe Baldwin\n\nAFTER a horrendous couple of years during which many turned down the opportunity to wear Saffron and White, Antrim’s run in Division 2 of the Littlewoods Ireland National League was probably the highlight of the season to date from an Ulster perspective.\n\nMany of those who committed to the Saffron cause for 2018 had little under-age experience playing for the county, but they were supplemented by the addition of half a dozen of the back to back Ulster minor winning teams of 2016-17.\n\nWell led by top-scorer Katie McAleese and centre half-back Aileen McManus the only teams that took points of them were the two that reached last Sunday’s Division 2 final. Antrim won three of their five league games, drew with Westmeath and lost to Cork.\n\nThat Cork game came early and was Lee-side and Antrim found difficulty pulling together a team to travel. It helped that three of their games were at home, while in the final game, they had gained momentum and easily defeated Down in Portaferry.\n\nMany of the top club players in the county still can’t find the time (or the will) to represent Antrim, but there is huge talent coming through, as witnessed last weekend with the retention of the All-Ireland minor title and the fact that two north Antrim schools contested the provincial senior final for the first time and Cross and Passion lost narrowly in an All-Ireland final in March.\n\nTwo seasons ago, Loughgiel (plus Cushendall’s Orlagh O’Hara) represented Antrim in the Ulster senior and All-Ireland Intermediate championship and actually won the Ulster championship when Racquel McCarry blasted a late goal for a 3-7 to 2-9 victory over Derry in Ballybofey.\n\nAntrim are a work in progress and could trouble Derry in their semi-final fixture. However they will feel that a decent run in the All-Ireland Intermediate championship will consolidate their league run.\n\nHowever getting the best 25 senior players in the county to commit is the biggest task for any Antrim management team.\n\nExpectation: A narrow defeat to Derry in the Ulster semi-final and an outside chance of reaching the All-Ireland Intermediate semi-final\n\nLeague results:\n\nAntrim 2-9 Wexford 1-2\n\nCork 1-17 Antrim 0-5\n\nAntrim 2-9 Westmeath 2-9\n\nAntrim 2-10 Carlow 0-13\n\nDown 0-10 Antrim 1-18\n\nAntrim panel: Noeleen Cosgrove, Cliodhna Donnelly, Kathryn Donnelly, Colleen Patterson , Maria Lynn, Aileen McManus, Aine Mulholland, Laoise McKenna, Christine Laverty, Lucia McNaughton, Katie McAleese, Caoimhe McAleenan, Orla O’Hara, Chloe Drain, Catriona Graham, Nuala McQuillan, Dervla Cosgrove, Katie McKillop, Aine Donnelly, Eimear Costello, Caoimhe Wright, Sarah Armstrong, Niamh Donnelly.\n\nARMAGH\n\nManagement: Sean Paul McKillop, John McKillop and Bebe Devlin\n\nALTHOUGH they produced the goods in the second half of the Kildare game, Armagh’s league campaign did not push on in the manner expected. That was their only win of the six games played and in many ways it was quite frustrating for all concerned.\n\nYes, Armagh have stepped up a grade but they have yet to find their feet. In many games they started well and there appeared little between them and their opponents until the first goal went in – for the opposition! Then doubt set in, more scores followed and they quickly found themselves struggling to stay in touch.\n\nThey lack experience – perhaps only Ciara Donnelly, with Eglish and in Armagh teams of a few years ago, has that experience and leadership qualities to help them through the difficult patch. Another player that has been there, done that (perhaps a defender) could make a huge contribution.\n\nWhatever happens in the Ulster championship – they may or may not beat a struggling Down team in the semi-final – the Armagh season will be defined by their performances in the All-Ireland Premier Junior championship.\n\nTwo years ago Armagh went very close in Croke Park, losing to Carlow in the Junior final. If they can get a run going in the summer, gain confidence and play without the fear of failure they had in the league, then they could well get back to the September sunshine in Croke Park.\n\nExpectation: An Ulster final appearance would be a bonus. An All-Ireland Junior title is a more realistic aim.\n\nLeague results:\n\nDerry 2-19, Armagh 2-6\n\nArmagh 1-13, Tipperary 3-14\n\nArmagh 0-7 Laois 5-6\n\nArmagh 0-6 Kilkenny 1-17\n\nKildare 2-9, Armagh 1-14\n\nDublin 3-15 Armagh 2-8\n\nArmagh panel: Ciarrai Devlin, Catherine McCooey, Grainne Kelly, Leah McGoldrick, Siodhna Woods, Catherine Beagan, Caella Casey, Jessica Hamill, Eimear Smyth (Madden), Eimear Smyth (Ballymacnab), Hannah Hughes, Hannah French, Gabrielle Fox, Rachel Merry, Ciara Donnelly, Leanne Donnelly, Blaithin O’Brien, Sarah Mooney, Katie Convie, Bernie Murray, Collette McSorley, Aine Maguire, Tierna Maguire, Fionnuala Kelly, Laura Kelly, Sarah Mooney, Nichola Woods, Emma Mone\n\nDOWN\n\nManagement: Martina Rooney, Fionnuala Carr, Marie Sherry\n\nDown are a county in turmoil as evidenced by the fact that this is their fourth management team in five seasons and second this term alone. They failed to get a management set in place until ten days before the start of their league campaign in Division 2 of the Littlewoods Ireland National League and early results were naturally poor.\n\nThere seemed to be some improvement in performance, if not results, as the competiton developed but after the last league game, a 1-18 to 0-10 defeat by Antrim, management stepped down and Martina Rooney, one of the selectors, has stepped in along with captain Fionnuala Carr for the remainder of the season.\n\nThey got off to a good start a fortnight ago with a 3-10 to 0-5 win over Kildare in the Relegation play-off and that has to be a positive step.\n\nIt is 13 years since Down took the last of their 15 Ulster senior titles and things looked good when they captured an All-Ireland Junior title in Croke Park in 2014 and followed it up with a national Minor title in 2016.\n\nThe potential in Down is underlined by last year’s reasonable run in the All-Ireland Intermediate championship that included a draw with Meath who went on to win the title. They also have some of the top forwards in the province in Niamh Mallon and Sarah Louise Graffin and young Saoirse Sands’ promotion from the minor squad will add to the scoring potential.\n\nThe new management will probably target a win against Armagh in the Ulster semi-final but outright success would be very difficult. In the Intermediate championship a decent run could happen, but it will very much depend on gaining momentum in Ulster. A loss to Armagh and the summer will be a struggle.\n\nExpectation: Ulster finalists and a couple of wins in the Intermediate All-Ireland\n\nLeague results:\n\nWestmeath 4-11 Down 0-1\n\nDown 0-8, Wexford 2-9\n\nCarlow 3-10 Down 2-8\n\nDown 0-9 Cork 0-11\n\nDown 0-10 Antrim 1-18\n\nDiv 2 Relegation play-off: Down 3-10 Kildare 0-5\n\nDown panel: Fionnuala Carr, Alannah Savage, Niamh Burns, Orlagh Caldwell, Clara Cowan, Beth and Cassie Fitzpatrick, Sara Louise Graffin, Orla Gribben, Maria Higgins, Nicole Kelly, Dearbhla Magee, Niamh Mallon, Aimee McAleenan, Caitlin McCartan, Clare and Katie McGilligan, Maria McNally, Paula O'Hagan, Catherine O'Hare, Catherine Rocks, Eimear Rushe, Blanaid Savage, Saoirse Sands, Deirbhile Savage, Elizabeth Wilson\n\nUlster Senior championship Title Count:\n\nAntrim (47): 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016\n\nDown (15): 1948, 1949, 1953, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2005\n\nDerry (13): 1954, 1989, 1990, 1999, 2001, 2003**, 2004, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017\n\nArmagh (3): 1992, 1993, 1994\n\nCavan (2): 1940, 1941\n\n2003: awarded to Derry – no final played\n\nNo Championship: 1976, 2006, 2007\n\nALL FOUR of the teams in the Ulster senior championship played in Division 2 of the National leagues and Antrim fared best of them all, in what looked the hardest group, given that Cork and Westmeath contested the Division 2 final on Sunday.\n\nAntrim though are still in the process of development. They do have a few experienced players to lead the further development of younger players who have spent their teenage years collecting provincial and national titles.\n\nIf Antrim had all available resources at their disposal they would be favourites for the championship – but that is not going to happen this year. But they are still on an upward curve and may be in a better position to challenge this time next year.\n\nThe draw has pitted Antrim and Derry in the same semi-final – the two stronger teams playing off in all probability for the title.\n\nDerry have a more experienced bunch of players, despite the absence of the injured Karen Kielt. The Slaughtneil girls might have come in very recently and might still be shaking off the effects of a tough couple of years on the club front – but they are quality players and have gained the experience to win key games.\n\nIn the other semi-final, Down have talented and experienced players, although none of them possess a provincial senior medal. Upheaval within the county has left them with little preparation for the season.\n\nAfter winning the Division relegation play-off with Kildare they will feel pretty confident that they can reach an Ulster final. They should, given that Armagh are much less experienced.\n\nThe Orchard county will target an All-Ireland Junior title this year, but will also want to put together a decent performance against Down.\n\nEach county therefore will enter the Ulster title race hoping for different outcomes. Three of them would be delighted to win the crown, and only Derry will be disappointed in not adding to their tally.\n\nIn reality, the Ulster championship – as has been the case in recent years – is Derry’s to lose."
