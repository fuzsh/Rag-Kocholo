I attended the Leinster Football Final of 1946 in which Laois beat Kildare, I travelled by train from Athy to Heuston, fare 9 shillings and three pence.’\n\n—Fintan Walsh, 72, Laois\n\n‘My most treasured memories are of going to Munster hurling matches in the 1980s and watching my heroes, such as Nicky English and Pat Fox — poetry in motion. Traffic would be manic on the way into Cork City, as there was only one approach route, really, for Tipp supporters. I remember taking the “short-cut” across the River Lee over to Pairc Uί Caoimh with my heart in my mouth on small, over-crowded ferry boats, while Gardaί would be calling out asking the drivers for passenger boat licences!’\n\n—Noel Howley, 27, Tipperary\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I remember travelling to matches as part of the under-age camogie team. Once, the whole team was transported to Castleblayney in two cars! … When we travelled a distance to matches, the team would usually be in cars, and we would all meet up at some point to travel in convoy together, especially if going to the North. … By the time I was a teenager, I had probably visited every county in Ireland (except Kerry and Mayo — no camogie!).’\n\n—Marianne Lynch, 49, Monaghan\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘As an 18–24-year-old in the 1950s in a rural part of County Cork, Ireland, transport to “away” hurling matches was almost impossible to obtain. Matches were invariably played on a Sunday because people were too busy to attend or play during the week. There was no suitable public transport. We used to cycle if the distance was within 4 to 5 miles. For greater distances, we were fortunate that one of our friends had a large van. Eight to twelve of us (boys and girls) would cram into this van and travel 10 to 12 miles to play a match. We sang songs in the van to pass the time on the journey. We rarely had meals out because we had very little money. We generally had to get home early to milk the cows.’\n\n—Denis Kelleher, 74, Cork\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘One of the first times I went with my dad to Croke Park, I can’t really remember what game I went to see but I was probably around 5 or 6. We parked in one of the side streets just off probably Drumcondra Road, and Dad asked one of the local lads that used to be mulling around to mind the car.’\n\n—Brianán Nolan, 27, Dublin\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘We always travelled in hope, but we did not have much success either at club or county level. I attended the Leinster Football Final of 1946 in which Laois beat Kildare. I travelled by train from Athy to Heuston, fare 9 shillings and three pence.’\n\n—Fintan Walsh, 72, Laois\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘As the club did not consider T.J. of much use for any other position he was nominated to be the club’s referee. As his only means of transport was an old Raleigh bike, this naturally put a limit on the distance he could travel, so most of the games he was appointed to officiate at were of course local derbies. … In the old days the Ref parked his bike at the back of a ditch near the exit from the grounds, placed his coat and jacket on the spring carrier, put his trousers inside his socks, and assembled the teams together in the middle of the field, where he gave them a lecture on the finer arts of the game and how he would deal with breaches of the rules.’\n\n—an extract from The Referee — His Little Wooden Whistle Wouldn’t Whistle, by Joe O’Loughlin\n\n© Joe O’Loughlin and the GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘We were the only Dubs on my mother’s side of the family. The rest were fanatical Laois supporters. So that always led to a lot of slagging in the family. I always saw the funny side of it, but my older brother didn’t take to it too well. I don’t know why, but in my earlier years I supported Offaly. I think I liked the jerseys. One of my aunties was from Offaly, so I was her favourite for a while. Being an Offaly woman living in Laois could be tough around Championship time, so when I arrived with my Offaly jersey I was probably seen as her backup!’\n\n—David Hyland, 34, Dublin\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘We saw it as a way to escape the house in the '80s and see the county/country. We spent all our spare time in a field at the back of the house re-enacting Dublin & Kerry games, Kerry & Offaly, Cork & Dublin (1983), Cork versus Galway, Kilkenny in hurling — that phase passed quickly!!’\n\n—Enda Kiernan, 39, Westmeath\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘When the Cloyne adult teams were playing championship games, I was abandoned and given money for ice cream, which was meant to occupy me for the duration so that the folks could watch the game without interruption. I remember being at games and maybe not seeing much but meeting a lot of familiar people. There was never a question of food until we got home, and we never were encouraged to drink water in case we had to go to the usually non-existent toilet. When we visited my uncle’s farm at Kilworth at the weekends, we would then be \"Kilworth people\" and would support them, which I do to this day.’\n\n—Jerome O’Brien, 53, Cork\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘It is quite simply the best thing that ever happened to my family and I. The days out together watching Dublin, Cork, or Kerry in Fitzgerald Stadium, Parnell Park, Páirc Uí Chuíomh, or Croke Park. The days playing in the back garden with my dad and brother. The days supporting my brother’s school and club teams. The days my family came out and supported me. All cherished memories, and all great family moments.’\n\n—Marcus O’Buachalla, 28, Dublin\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘GAA didn’t just affect our family life — it was our way of life. Everything in my house revolved around it. If other things had to be done, they had to be fitted in around training and matches. There was very little more important in my house than GAA. My father was a trainer/selectors/masseur, and both of my brothers played the game. We were just always in Belfield. It was like our back garden — we went up there to play the same as all the other children in the locality, and we never really asked to go anywhere else — there was no point anyway! … My mother was a GAA woman, so there was no issue. My mother and my aunt would walk us all or wheel some of us to Belfield every Sunday afternoon, and when we got there we met up with other children and sometimes watched the games, but other times just played with each other. From a very early age, maybe 3, I was brought to Croke Park, and if I wasn’t hooked before that, I most certainly was then!’\n\n—Maria Nolan, 52, Wexford\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘My father told me he made his own football boots, as he was a shoemaker and they were the envy of all. He gave one boot to my uncle John Joe for one game and he wore the other — resource sharing in its earlier form. As I was the youngest of 10, there were a few stories knocking around, and both my brothers Michael Galvin and Tommy Galvin fared well at underage. Tommy played for a long time at corner back, which is where I played. My brother Martin took a minor team from Ennis (Éire Óg) to success in Clare, much to the surprise of West Clare and the Éire Óg hurling fraternity.’\n\n—Brian Galvin, 49, Clare\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I recall most of my rather large family crowding into the sitting room at home to watch matches on TV from the mid- to late '80s on. As the youngest, I was usually squashed into the edge of the couch. For a number of years in the '90s, my two eldest brothers and myself would go to all of Offaly's Championship games routinely. It was easy then, as the teams were generally doing well.’\n\n—Pat Nolan, 27, Offaly\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I felt that the new teacher in the boys’ national school had little interest in the young boys, Michael being one of them, my brother. I used to bring them up a field up the way that was owned by an uncle … it was the football field and I used to train them. Mike made the Kildare Minors and so did one of the other lads. I often would like to think that I had a little hand in it; I don’t know if I had or not.’\n\n—Annette Coyle, 64, Kildare\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘Until my very first hurling match, I was completely oblivious to the fact my friends and family were even fans. Only after I became an active supporter (attending matches, buying the county jersey) did my mother share with me how her mother was an avid fan of Waterford hurling. Never great fans in the direct male line in my family, I learned of the intense passion [in which] hurling and the GAA were held by many of the women in my family. At the same time I learned of the intense local rivalry with our neighbouring county, Kilkenny, and the lively banter such confrontations would bring … As a supporter, hurling has enabled me to connect with aunts, uncles, and cousins on a level I would have found difficult, if not impossible. Seeing them at that first hurling game was like finding out you share a dirty secret with previously distant neighbours.’\n\n—Damien Murphy, 30, Waterford\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I grew up in the Past Pupils club. Therefore, we were all girls together. We trained in the school field. We had no clubhouse as such. If we had a visiting team, we had to get permission from the nuns to open the school. If we had an away game, we cycled if [the] venue was within range. Otherwise, we had to ask parents who were interested to drive us. A particularly generous parent used to carry so many in the back of his car that the rear wheels could not be seen. We wore the old traditional camogie uniform: white long-sleeved blouse, grey gymfrock with green sash, long black stockings, and canvas black boots. Most wore white ankle socks to break up the drag black look. When we won Cork championships, we went to the Savoy, first to the cinema and then to the restaurant for tea and cakes. A former member of our club was the manageress of the Savoy and she looked after us. Drink was unheard of. We went on an annual trip to Dublin. The big thing was to go to Cafollas on O’Connell St and see who could eat the most ice cream.’\n\n—Mary Moran, 68, Cork\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I couldn’t imagine my mother ever attending a match. Now there are women who are officers of clubs. It’s for the better also. The mother is usually the one who is bringing the players to training/matches, so her input is vital.

They have input into the workings of the GAA and have influence in the decision-making process. Despite this observation, however, there is obviously still a long way to go in achieving a balanced representation within the workings of the GAA. Furthermore, while many of the younger women involved in the GAA have moved away from the tea-making duties, those carrying out these duties are still largely women.’\n\n—Laura Kelly, 25, Fermanagh\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘I remember when I went for the interview for my post in school in County Wexford VEC. One of the panel said to me, \"How could you possibly pick a football team, what do you know about football, you’re only a woman!\" ... I said I grew up at the end of a hurling stick and I have inter-county players as uncles … They couldn’t handle it, it was something strange, something new, it was strange, it was new. I was probably encroaching on their territory, what they deemed their territory.

The game is unique to this country, so it is a real reflection of our culture and heritage that has survived for generations. But I think that in my mind it is also a reflection of traditional hard-working values to a great extent, and I think much of this is encapsulated in the amateur nature of the game.

I know these weren’t their actual names, but they were registered with the club under assumed names!

The current parish priest is a former county board chairman but, to the best of my knowledge, does not have a significant role in the club at present, which is probably how it should be. The priests seem to be interested but don't appear to get involved in a big way.

There was a sharpish little rise up to the road goals, in this rise Bobby Madine, the Bishop, the captain of the team ... His game plan was simple and effective. When the opposition mounted an attack, the Bishop concentrated his attentions on the ball carrier. To the two defenders on either side, his instructions were unnerving and clear: “You take the man, boys, I’ll get the ball!”\n\n'Arms outstretched, his impressive bulk showed the way. The ball carrier laboured up the slope. At the critical moment, as he prepared to shoot, Bobby launched himself upon him. The unfortunate was flattened, and Bobby came away with the ball wearing an expression [that said] … \"Nothing to this game, lads, simple, just like life.\" So it was with the Bishop’s career in football: no shouting, no panic, no nonsense, just pure enjoyment. Knowing what we know now, it can’t have been all that easy to run a parish and a football team during the early years.

At the beginning of the game I made a £10 [bet] with a man sitting next to me that Wexford would win, because Limerick had broken from the traditional parade before the completion of the circuit.'\n\n—Noel Byrne, 60, Wexford\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'In Dublin we would always go to McDonald's on O'Connell Street before the game, an exotic treat, given that the franchise only existed in the main population centres of Ireland at that time. I remember my father used to bring a bag packed with all sorts of stuff, sandwiches, biscuits, tea, etc. It was the done thing by everyone years ago, but virtually no one does it now.\n\n'Prices of tickets were never a great issue for me because no price was prohibitive to me going to a game. I always had my money in order first and foremost so that I could pay my own way into a game. I do remember that the price for a Hogan Stand ticket for the 1994 All-Ireland SHC final was IR£25, and thinking it was quite an amount of money. It was worth it come 5pm, though. In 1995 it was IR£27 for a new Cusack Stand ticket, and I wanted a refund after that game! The celebrations after the 1994 final were brilliant. I played in the pipe band that led the team bus through huge crowds in Tullamore and then Birr, which is a very special memory.'\n\n—Pat Nolan, 26, Offaly\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘Croke Park was only for big teams … you always had to pick another team when I was growing up that you’d want to win the All-Ireland, whether it be Kerry or Dublin or whoever. It was never even in the thinking that Carlow was going to get it.’\n\n—Niall O'Neill, 34, Carlow\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'My introduction to Croke Park began when I was about six years old. My late father would always listen to the games on the radio: the wireless, as it was known then. Each week he would bring the wet battery into Donegal town and have it re-charged. Electricity arrived in rural Donegal in 1959–60. Our wireless was used sparingly, i.e., news bulletins and a few other important programmes, which included the big matches in Croke Park. As every house did not have a wireless, many of our neighbours' children would gather in our kitchen and listen to the late great Michael O'Hehir as he gave a blow-by-blow account of games one hundred and fifty miles away.\n\n'Once the match was over, we would assemble in McGettigan's Field and replay the game. Two older boys would select the opposing teams. Everyone present was included, which meant we often played twenty a side. As our pitch consisted of the entire field, this was no problem.'\n\n—an extract from 'From McGettigans Field to Gaelic Park'\n\n© Mattie Lennon and the GAA Oral History Project\n\n'Kickham’s immortal phrase “For the sake of the little village” sums it up for me.'\n\n—Pat Burke, 69, Tipperary\n\n'Without question, the heroes of the organisation are the men and women who give their time and energy to the running of underage teams and the provision of the facilities which make the games attractive to young people. Within this group, I would particularly salute the former acclaimed county players who adapt readily from being demi-gods to the chores of running an under-fourteen team! I have great respect for some of the recent and not-so-recent presidents and some of the current county managers. I consider it would be invidious to identify individuals currently involved, but the role and vision of such as Alf Murray, whom I knew slightly, represents the best in the leadership of the organisation.'\n\n—Michael McKeown, 65, Antrim\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'Volunteers are the main hub of people who run clubs who give time, effort, sweat and tears in some cases, to enable the bigger audience within communities to be a part of any club. If clubs start to pay people, it will break the bond that grows through clubs among its members, as people know that everybody is pulling the same direction to ensure that the club is the main winner, not individuals trying to benefit for themselves.'\n\n—David P. McKittrick, 41, Dublin\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'Without the voluntary people there would be no organisation, no clubs, no organised games. Volunteers are the people that do the real work on the ground and at national and provincial levels. Policies can be set down all right, but if you don’t have the people to implement them and carry them out at county and club level, it is largely a waste of time and resources. You need the people at ground level to open the gates, open the dressing rooms, have jerseys ready, have footballs, hurleys and everything else ready for training sessions, meetings that have to be organised. They have to clean up dressing rooms after games [to make them] ready for the next session. And the many, many things that have to be done. I mean, the role of the voluntary person is invaluable; you can’t put a value on it.'\n\n—Lorcan O’Rourke, 63, Kildare\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n‘There’s so many lifers there … we have a man in the club, and he goes down and opens the gate every morning at 8am, he closes it every night at 10pm or thereabouts.

Unseen, unheard, he will go anywhere for a match, play under any name, in any position. He could be an ex-senior playing in a junior match. He could be a fifteen-year-old playing his first adult match and recounting the story for 10 years after. He could be a minor C playing AFL12. He is probably a guy who has touched senior, but will never let you down, limited talent, but full of heart, every match is an All-Ireland Final.\n\n'Most of all, he cares. He goes to the senior matches, pays in (€15 into Parnell now!). He does the car park in the All-Ireland Sevens. He’ll put up nets for an important match.

And all just to be able to buy a pint with his mates in his club.'\n\n—Robert Moloney, 45, Dublin\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'Were it not for volunteers, the association would fold. It costs many of them to be involved, from time to petrol to loss of work opportunities ….

They are the bedrock of the association. One has only to visit any club on a summer's morning and see the huge number of youngsters being trained.

To remedy this state of affairs, Hugh O’Toole and himself secured a field — not a good one; an old set of posts was found lying around. They called a meeting of the young fellows of the neighbourhood, and a club was formed ... At the outset, despite the weakness of their team, a rule was made that only local lads should play for the team — the cause of the collapse of the previous team having been that players gathered from here and there and had no real loyalty to Loughinisland. Everybody pitched in and squared up the field; everybody subscribed five shillings. A ball was purchased, and Loughinisland were back in football.'\n\n—Hugh MacNamara, quoted in Michael Madine, Donal Gordon, and Tommy McLeigh, Loughinisland: Our Story, 1906–2006 (2008)\n\n'I feel that that they [GAA administrators] must be to some greater extent or lesser extent motivated by their knowledge, and I presume they still have some knowledge, by the reasons for the association, of the work of Croke, Cusack, and Davin, and what they did for the Ireland of their time, and the obligation attaching to them to do something today for that thing called Ireland, and I believe that is the reason for the GAA, in addition to serving and giving the county and its people something unique.'\n\n—Pat Fanning, 91, Waterford\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'When you go back to the foundation of the association, when you have somebody like Michael Cusack, who always portrayed the idea that there was no use in the Irish politicians looking for independence without us having social independence, and the promotion of the GAA was that social independence.

After beating Warwickshire in the British final, we had to play Dublin in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. This was played on a warm Saturday in July. This was an even more historic day for Gaelic football, and also Gloucestershire, as it was the first inter-county All-Ireland Junior football championship match to be played in Cardiff. Being realistic, we knew that we did not have much chance of beating a very good Dublin side, who had better games under their belts and had some very talented players with a very good manager in Mick Deegan. They also had former Dublin Senior Midfielder Darren Homan. He was on the bench.\n\n'Dublin were brilliant from the off and blitzed into a big lead before we even got our first score. However, even with the talent that Dublin had, we did manage to get some scores, and we even scored a goal. However, as expected, Dublin were far too good for us and went on to win easily. It was a big defeat, but for me it was a special day, as it was amazing to be part of a great squad who, even though we did not win the game, we played Dublin in our first All-Ireland Semi-Final.'\n\n—Aidan Raftery, 33, Roscommon and Bristol\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\n'When I moved to the States I took part in the Louth football club. Through the football, I made many friends and was also able to find work. As I grew older, I tried to keep the club alive. We are a small county with not very high numbers emigrating from Louth. I found it a strain to find jobs for the boys, places to stay. Going to airports, meeting players. We had no cash and did not have a connection with unions or places where you could get work for lads out for the summer. Many times I found my house and my life overrun with players staying for periods of time. I just could not keep the team together, and Louth folded under my watch in about 1993. I regret it, because I saw so many players around after that that would have played for me.'\n\n—Tommy Smyth, 64, Louth and New York\n\n© GAA Oral History Project\n\nA sense of home has always been important to the Irish. This is no less important for the GAA – a field and a clubhouse where the club, and its members, can belong. In the contemporary era this often means a large club house with a range of facilities, all weather and floodlit pitches and a real sense that the local GAA club is at the heart of the community. It has not always been so.\n\nThe first major hurdle was the acquisition of a national stadium for the GAA. Where Croke Park now stands was a patch of land owned, from the 1870s, by Maurice Butterly. It was used during his period of ownership as a sports ground, and was known at the City and Suburban Racecourse. It was most frequently used as an athletics track, and was also the first home of Bohemians soccer club. As an available sporting space in the city, it was used by the GAA for athletics events and hurling and football matches from 1884. The importance of the grounds, and their emergence as the home of the GAA was evidenced in 1896 when both (the delayed 1895) All-Irelands were played there. However, while the ground was becoming important to the Association, it presented the same problems as many other grounds that were regularly used by the GAA: they were tenants and not owners. In theory, as happened across the country, rents could rise or else the owner decided that they wanted to do something else with the land. When Butterly died in 1905 the grounds came up for sale. It took three years before the GAA could act, and it was journalist and GAA member, Frank Dineen, who borrowed much of the £3,250 asking price and bought the fourteen acre site in 1908. Dineen was not a wealthy man, and struggled with the repayments. The GAA, while relying on the good spirit of Dineen for continued access to what was then known as Jones’ Road, had to move so that the Association, rather than relying on a supportive individual, owned the grounds. Money was raised, and in 1913 the GAA came into exclusive ownership of the plot when they purchased it from Dineen for £3,500, and the decision taken to name the ground after the GAA’s founding patron.\n\nThe pattern established by the use, and later purchase, of the Croke Park site, was a common one across the country. In most cases the local club or county board would begin leasing land, would enclose it (and depending on the demands of crowds, build stands), and eventually move towards purchasing the plot. In order to become property owners – and controllers of their own destiny - a process that dominated the life of the Association from the 1920s until the 1960s, the GAA needed money. It was not a sports organisation that could call on a legion of wealthy members to bankroll ground purchases. Rather, the GAA had to raise money from its members by staging challenge matches and other fundraisers and, most importantly, it had to grow its number of clubs and fixtures so that profits accumulated from gate receipts could be used to purchase grounds. Some matches were held on private grounds with the support of the owners, most notably the 1904 hurling final. It was staged on the fields at Maurice Davin’s home, Deerpark, and saw Kilkenny take their first ever All-Ireland, beating Cork. Davin was an exception – he was a central figure in the establishment of the GAA and, as a successful businessman he had the kind of property where games could be played. Such figures were unusual in the Association, and it was not a way of hosting games on which the GAA could rely.\n\nThe election of Pádraig Ó Caoimh to the position of General Secretary in 1929 (a position he would hold for 35 years) was vital in galvanising the GAA in the wake of the Irish Revolution. Due to the dislocation caused by the War of Independence and the Civil War, the activities of the GAA had been disrupted. This led to a smaller number of active clubs around the country and an ever diminishing bank balance. Unless the GAA could be reinvigorated, the issue of purchasing grounds was an irrelevance. Ó Caoimh balanced the books quickly, and the growing appeal of the games for spectators was evident from the rise in gate receipts for major championship matches: the replayed 1931 football final brought in £8,000 through the turnstiles, and the 1933 hurling final £4,000. While overall gate receipts across the country remained static in the 1930s, the thrill of the championship, the emergence of new counties in the top flight and the demand for tickets for big matches meant that by the mid-1930s Ó Caoimh was managing an annual surplus rather than an overdraft. The number of clubs affiliated to the GAA also rose. In 1935 the total number had been 1,686, by 1945 it was 2,010, with steady growth, for the first time, across Ulster.\n\nThe most telling changes in the area of grounds have taken place in the last decade. Croke Park was completely rebuilt in the 1990s, so that it is now the largest and most modern sports facility on the island, holding a capacity crowd of 82,300. The availability of money in the economy during the 1990s and early 2000s, and the soaring values of land, meant that many GAA clubs were made offers by developers for their grounds. Clubs relocated and reaped the benefits of new and larger purpose built facilities.\n\nWhile GAA grounds will undoubtedly be moved and redeveloped again in the future, the key issue is a sense of place. Whether a player or spectator, or a parent dropping children off for a practice session, the GAA ground dominates the local area. It is a hub of community activity, and for many it is a place they identify with as home. While Croke Park may remain as a September Mecca, open to only a small number of counties, the dream of getting there inspires supporters, county players and the youngsters. Grounds, the grass and cement that makes the GAA real and gives it a sense of place, are key in forging a link between the people and the Association.\n\n‘He set the ball on top of a rush bush, and he hit it that hard that the ball went over the bar and the rush bush went into the net.

This he did, and we spent the summer evenings playing in a little field beside the road belonging to John McGuiness, Lismagunshion. This field was too small for playing matches, and so our football was confined to playing into the one solitary goal. When night fell, we used sit or lie on the hay in a little shed inside McGuiness's gate and talk football until it was time to go home.’\n\n—extract from the diary of PJ Duffy, Cremartin, Co.
