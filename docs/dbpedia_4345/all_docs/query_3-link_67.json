        "text": "Athenry87 - you are daft if this is a current best crop. If it is an all time best crop well I think that you may have included Kiltormer in the top 5 at least. Turlough have their meritited position because of the 6 in a row in the 1960's.....nothing won since then so maybe 5 is generous from you. I think Castlegar should be honoured in the top 5 aswell as they broke the duck back in 1980 and truely were a great team. I don't think craughwell or st. thomas's are deserving of 8 & 9. Carnmore were the most unluckiest Club in Galway not to win a final in the early 90's and they should have won at least 2! This is my preferred choice of all time of all time greats!! but some of you may disagree.\n\n1:Sarsfields\n\n2.Portumna\n\n3.Athenry\n\n4.Castlegar\n\n5.Kiltormer\n\n6.Carnmore\n\n7.loughrea\n\n8.turloughmore\n\n9.clarinbridge\n\n10.gort\n\nTribalCharlie (Galway) - Posts: 151 - 25/11/2008 15:47:08 149541\n\nLink 0\n\nCharlie:\n\nArdrahan are second only to Castlegar on the all-time list with 11 county cups, while Carnmore have never to my knowledge won one.\n\nYet you have Carnmore at 6 and haven't got Ardrahan at all.\n\nI know it's your opinion and all, but i don't know if too many people will share it.\n\nStool Pigeon (Galway) - Posts: 882 - 25/11/2008 16:22:02 149602\n\nLink 0\n\nShould it not be based on the amout of county titles won that would determine who are the best overall, here are the top twenty, i know others have won All ireland club but is the question not the top 10 clubs in galway\n\nTop Winners\n\nTeam Winner Winning Years\n\n1 Castlegar 17 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1944, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1958, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1979, 1984\n\n2 Ardrahan 11 1894, 1895, 1896, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1910, 1949, 1974, 1975, 1978\n\n3 Athenry 8 1987, 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004\n\n3 Turloughmore 8 1956, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1985\n\n5 Peterswell 7 1907, 1905, 1904, 1900, 1899, 1898, 1889\n\n6 Sarsfields 6 1980, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997\n\n7 Kiltormer 5 1976, 1977, 1982, 1990, 1991\n\n7 Gort 5 1914, 1916, 1934, 1981, 1983\n\n7 Liam Mellowes 5 1935, 1945, 1946, 1968, 1970\n\n7 Tynagh 5 1920, 1922, 1923, 1925, 1928\n\n7 Craughwell 5 1909, 1915, 1918, 1930, 1931\n\n12 Portumna 4 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008\n\n13 Mullagh 3 1906, 1929, 1932\n\n13 Kilconieron 3 1908, 1912, 1919\n\n15 Loughrea 2 1941, 2006\n\n15 Fohenagh 2 1959, 1960\n\n15 Army 2 1947, 1948\n\n15 Woodford 2 1913, 1917\n\n15 College RD, Galway 2 1892, 1893\n\n20 Clarenbridge 1 2001\n\n20 Abbeyknockmoy 1 1988\n\n20 Killimordaly 1 1986\n\n20 Tommy Larkins 1 1971\n\n20 Ballinasloe 1 1951\n\n20 Maree 1 1933\n\n20 Derrydonnell 1 1911\n\n20 Killimor 1 1897\n\n20 Meelick 1 1887\n\ngalwaygael19 (Galway) - Posts: 8 - 25/11/2008 16:27:48 149618\n\nLink 0\n\nCharlie:\n\nArdrahan are second only to Castlegar on the all-time list with 11 county cups, while Carnmore have never to my knowledge won one.\n\nYet you have Carnmore at 6 and haven't got Ardrahan at all.\n\nI know it's your opinion and all, but i don't know if too many people will share it.\n\nThank you stool pigeon for highlighting my grievance.\n\nallforone (Galway) - Posts: 38 - 25/11/2008 16:35:59 149630\n\nLink 0\n\n1.Sarsfields\n\n2.Athenry\n\n3.Portumna\n\n4.Kiltormer\n\n5.Castlegar/Gort\n\nSarsfields pip Athenry and Portumna for me, 6 county titles and 2 all irelands for such a small club is some achievement. like kiltormer were winning county titles when the county senior team were a force, cooneys,mcgraths kellys all class acts. athenry just pip portumna because i think the standard was a bit better in the county when they were winning,plus 3 all irelands is some achievment. if portumna win another all ireland they are up there, some team, way ahead of the rest in this county and IMO only ballyhale come close to them in the country. Kiltormer in 4, similiar to sars, small pick but with 5 county titles and an all ireland is some achievement,again when the senior county team was going well they were strong\n\nmrboombastic (Galway) - Posts: 4 - 25/11/2008 18:39:51 149770\n\nLink 0\n\nportumna.unbeaten again this year dispite showing signs of a tired team clarenbridge..have been closest to beating port this year and last in the country. athenry..should put u21 back to back..there coming again gort..good cup team.hard to beat mellows..hav a few of the best (and worst) hurlers in it. beagh..very dangerous.limited(3-4 familys)but make the best of it loughrea..made semis but will be out of top 4 next year st thomas..exceptional minor team.a club on the way up craughwell..respected cos 3-4 county lads.too many primadonnas to be chalengers. larkins..made teams respect them last year.more difficult now but wont lack motivation my top 10 for 2009\n\nfaceinthecrowd (Galway) - Posts: 26 - 25/11/2008 22:41:50 149976\n\nLink 0\n\nWhen i saw that list of honours, i flagged it straight away as being incorrect. I wouldnt trust wikipedia. Mellows are in the top two or three in county when it comes to lists with 9 championships wins. When in wikipedia, if you go through each individual year you can count 8 champ wins for mellows ie more than the table list.\n\nHere are my top clubs at the minute:\n\nPortumna\n\nAthenry\n\nLoughrea\n\nGort\n\nMellows\n\nClairnbride\n\nCastlegar\n\nCraughwell\n\nSarsfields\n\nAdrahan\n\nCity Lad (Galway) - Posts: 41 - 25/11/2008 23:07:02 149996\n\nLink 0\n\nMeelickman, if it's present-day teams that matter what are Castlegar doing in your list? One semi-final appearance since 1987 is hardly anything to boast about.\n\nHow far back does your present day go?\n\nAs for the 'top 10' lists, in the modern day a lot depends on the draws teams get, i get the feeling that there is plenty of club bias/snobbery going on. Certainly Mullagh (despite this year's displays, they should be better next year) and Kinvara should be on present-day lists IMO.\n\nStool Pigeon (Galway) - Posts: 882 - 25/11/2008 23:32:13 150006\n\nLink 0"
