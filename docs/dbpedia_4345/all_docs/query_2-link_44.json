Liam O Brien, who has three sons on the present team played a starring role as well as current wing forward Aaron Pratt's three uncles Philly, Connie and Mickey Curley. Current GAA Director of Games Pat Daly was corner forward for Tallow. Tallow faced Roscrea in the Munster Club Championship but were defeated in a close game.\n\n1984 Tallow 2-12 Portlaw 2-1\n\nA centenary county title was Tallow's reward for a rampant display against Portlaw. The team was captained by Eddie Curley and featured Liam O Brien again as well as four Curleys and current selector Steven Curley. Emigration contributed to weakened Tallow team being well beaten by Patrickswell in the Munster Club Championship.\n\n1985 Tallow 3-8 Ballyduff 2-8\n\nA local derby against a strong Ballyduff team that was settled by two Tallow goals after halftime. Notable for the fact it featured brothers playing against each other (Tallow's Pat Daly facing Ballyduff's Seamus Daly). Mick beecher was captain and current selector Eddie Cunningham was also a selector back then. Tallow were beaten by a point by Kilruane Mac Donaghs in the Munster Club championship who went on to win the All Ireland.\n\nCounty Hurling Titles\n\nSenior\n\n(4) 1936,1980,1984,1985\n\nIntermediate\n\n(2) 1974,1987\n\nJunior\n\n(3) 1925,1930,1981\n\nU21\n\n(7) 1972,1976,1977,1983,2002,2003,2008(b)\n\nMinor\n\n(8) 1938,1967,1971,1975,1980,1986,1997,2007(b)\n\nU16\n\n(4) 1967,1970,1972,1999(b)\n\nU14\n\n(2) 1971,2006(b)\n\nCounty Football Titles\n\nIntermediate\n\n(1) 1976\n\nJunior\n\n(1) 1975, 2010\n\nU21\n\n(4) 1968,1978,1980,1996(with shamrocks)\n\nMinor\n\n(4) 1967,1968,1969,1971\n\nU16\n\n(3) 1966,1969,1970\n\nU14\n\n(1) 1971\n\nWestern Hurling Titles\n\nIntermediate\n\n(4) 1971,1974,1982,1987\n\nJunior\n\n(4) 1925,1930,1980,1981\n\nU21\n\n(16) 1969,1972,1974,1975,1976,1977,1978,1979,1981,1982,1983,1988,1999, 2002,2003,2008(b).\n\nMinor\n\n(15) 1938,1956,1967,1968,1971,1972,1974,1975,1979,1980,1981,1986,1997, 1999, 2007(b)\n\nU16\n\n(10) 1967,1969,1970,1971,1972,1977,1978,1979, 1994(b), 1999(b)\n\nU14\n\n(5) 1971,1975,1976,1982,2006(b)\n\nWestern Football Titles\n\nIntermediate\n\n(1) 1976\n\nJunior\n\n(2) 1975,1994, 2010 ,2012\n\nU21\n\n(5) 1968,1976,1978,1980,1996(with shamrocks)\n\nMinor\n\n(6) 1967,1968,1969,1971,1972,1973\n\nU16\n\n(5) 1966,1968,1969,1970,1972\n\nU14\n\n(4) 1971,1973,1980,1986\n\nTallow men in the medals\n\nA member of the 2010 panel to win the Munster Senior Championship.\n\nMany other Tallow players wore the county jersey at senior level outside of championship.
