        "text": "The first reference to Longford in Championship competition was in June 1896 when fixtures for 1896 Leinster SFC are published showing Longford vs Kilkenny. However there is no record of the match taking place. Longford is next listed in fixtures versus Westmeath in 1897 Leinster SFC in July 1898, but again no record of any match taking place. The first recorded inter-county game involving Longford took place when Longford (represented by Longford Shamrocks) played Louth (represented by Drogheda Emmets) in the delayed 1896 Croke Cup competition in Oldcastle on 14th February 1897. Louth won by 2-8 to 0-3. The Croke Cup was a knockout competition which took place from 1896 to 1915.\n\nLongford’s first game in Leinster SFC was on 22nd November 1903 vs Wexford at Jones’ Road in the delayed 1902 Leinster SFC competition (the 1902 Leinster Championship started in 1902 and ended in 1904). This was the first Leinster SFC to feature all 12 Leinster counties with Longford being the last to affiliate. The fixture was originally for both Football and Hurling and then became Hurling only. However around 10 days prior to the game, Longford advised they could not field in Hurling and requested that the fixture be Football instead. The change was made and Wexford won by 2-12 to 0-2. The following year Longford competed again in Leinster SFC on 31st July 1904 in the delayed 1903 Leinster SFC competition, losing to Westmeath by 0-7 to 0-5. Thereafter Longford competed intermittently in the Leinster Junior Football Championship (pitched against Westmeath every year) until Junior competition was discontinued from 1917 to 1920. Longford then played in Leinster SFC from 1917 to 1920 before reverting back to the re-organised Leinster JFC from 1922 to 1924, winning the Leinster JFC title in 1924 (awarded after an objection) and was promoted to Leinster SFC from 1925 to 1930, though also competed in Leinster JFC too in many of those years. Longford returned exclusively to Leinster JFC from 1931 to 1937, and won the Leinster JFC and All-Ireland JFC titles in 1937, thus gaining promotion to Leinster SFC from 1938, and has competed in Leinster SFC every year since and also in Leinster JFC intermittently from then until 2019. Longford won the Leinster JFC title in 1953 while also competing in Leinster SFC competition. Longford won the Leinster SFC once, in 1968.\n\nLongford qualified for the All-Ireland SFC (knockout stage) just once, in 1968, losing to Kerry in the All-Ireland semi final having won the Leinster SFC title for the first (and thus far only) time in 1968. Longford participates in the Leinster SFC annually. From 1990 to 2000 Longford also participated in All-Ireland ‘B’ SFC, which was the GAA’s first attempt at a tier 2 Championship. This was scrapped in 2001 and replaced by the All-Ireland Qualifier series to give teams eliminated in the early stages of the Provincial Championship a chance to gain entry to the All-Ireland Championship via a back door route. Longford competed in the All-Ireland SFC Qualifiers every year from 2001 to 2019. The GAA attempted another tier 2 Championship via the Tommy Murphy Cup from 2004 to 2008, for teams eliminated from the early stages of the All-Ireland Qualifier series. Longford participated in the Tommy Murphy Cup just once (in 2005) and won two games, before losing to Wexford in the Semi Final. As with the All-Ireland ‘B’ Championship, this competition failed to take root and was eventually scrapped.\n\nLongford currently competes in Leinster SFC and Tailteann Cup competitions. If Longford fails to reach the Leinster SFC final or finishes the NFL in Divisions 3 or 4, they compete in the Tailteann Cup which is a Tier 2 Championship introduced in 2022. Participation in the Tier 1 Championship (Sam Maguire Cup) is limited to the top 16 teams in the country consisting of the 8 teams who reach the Provincial finals and the next highest 8 teams from Divisions 1 and 2 of National Football League.\n\nAll-Ireland ‘B’ SFC was an optional Tier 2 Championship for teams eliminated from the early stages of their Provincial SFC competition. Longford competed from 1990 to 2000, reaching and losing the final three times. Longford played 23 games against 10 different counties from 1990 to 2000, Won 10, Drew 2 and Lost 11, and reaching the decider in 1991, 1995 & 1996. The 1996 final went to a replay following a controversial injury time free awarded to Fermanagh. In 1995 the competition moved from its usual Autumn slot to the Summer instead, leading to Fermanagh, Sligo, Antrim and Clare pulling out of the competition due to players otherwise engaged in club competition, and reducing that years competition to a farce. That decision was soon reversed with competition returning to Sep-Oct period from 1996. In 1999 only eight counties entered the competition. In 2000 Longford conceded their round 1 game to Wicklow with management unable to field a strong enough side due to injuries and players missing due to ongoing club commitments. This first attempt at a secondary championship was defined by poor attendances, lackluster public support, obscure dates/times/venues for games, and a distinct lack of marketing or prestige throughout.\n\nThe All-Ireland ‘B’ Championship winners down the years were:\n\n1990: Leitrim (beat Sligo)\n\n1991: Clare (beat Longford AET)\n\n1992: Wicklow (beat Antrim)\n\n1993: Laois (beat Sligo)\n\n1994: Carlow (beat Westmeath)\n\n1995: Tipperary (beat Longford)\n\n1996: Fermanagh (beat Longford in replay)\n\n1997: Louth (beat Clare)\n\n1998: Monaghan (beat Fermanagh)\n\n1999: Antrim (beat Fermanagh)\n\n2000: Fermanagh (beat Wicklow)\n\nHistory Makers: The Monaghan v Longford 1st round tie in 1998 All-Ireland B Championship in Castleblaney was the first ever inter-county GAA match played under floodlights. Monaghan won 2-11 to 1-11 and the Longford team that day was: C Conefrey, J Keegan, O Reilly; S Carroll, C Keogh, T Donoghue; A Keogh, T Drake; D Blessington, P Lynch, P Barden; D Barry, E Barden, W Skelly. Subs: A Sheridan for W Skelly, M O’Connor for O Reilly."
