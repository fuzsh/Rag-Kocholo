        "text": "Club History since 1889\n\nDid you know\n\nThe first recording of a match involving Rahoon Hurling Club was on the 11th October 1889 where Rahoon John Mitchells took part in a tournament in Galway City. The other teams who took part were Turloughmore, Claddagh, College Rd, Oranmore, St Patricks and Clarinbridge. Rahoon John Mitchells wore green jerseys.\n\nIn 1837 Rahoon Parish stretched from Claddagh to Furbo and had a population of 14,135. After the famine in 1849 the population stood at just over 8,000.\n\nIn 1894 PJ Foley became the first County GAA Official from Rahoon when he was elected as Treasurer of Galway GAA.\n\nIn 1904 there were 18 Seniors Clubs in Galway , Rahoon John Mitchell’s were now known as Rahoon GAA. The other two teams in or around the city were Castlegar and Galway St Patricks. Rahoon were drawn in the first round of Championship against Castlegar.\n\nIn 1908 Rahoon Seniors and Juniors travelled to Athenry to play Tuam Stars in Senior and Craughwell in Junior. Rahoon players and their huge following made their way by Side Car and Brakes. They were led along the way by their own Fife and Drum band.\n\nIn 1909 Rahoon Seniors defeated Turloughmore in the championship only for Turlough to subsequently object on the basis that a Rahoon players was alleged to be a member of the Militia. After many appeals Rahoon were ejected from the tournament. Rahoon then withdrew from all GAA activity until 1924.\n\nIn 1924 Rahoon returned as a Junior Team and played Derrydonnell in the Championship. Other City clubs were Thomas Ashe’s, Carrabrowne, Terryland, Emmets, and Claddagh. Galway won its first Senior Hurling All Ireland. Turkeys could be purchased in the Christmas Market at 7d in old money or at 3 cents a llb in today’s money. Weekly wages were €1.59 per week.\n\nIn 1927 the Sports ground in Galway opened. Due to the fact that not one round of the 1926 championship had been played and the political upheaval as result of the 1927 General Election campaign, Rahoon once again withdrew from GAA activity until 1936.\n\nIn 1936 Rahoon again returned to action. That year Liam Mellows who had formed in 1933 won the Senior Hurling Club Championship and UCG won the Football. A Hillman Minx Saloon Car cost € 315. Rahoon were drawn with Shantallow, Renmore, Menlo, Oranmore and Moycullen in the Junior Championship.\n\nRahoon Jerseys were now Green and Gold.\n\nPresident of the Club was Rev Fr Conway. Treasurers were Peter Feeney and Peter Moloney. Secretary was Miko Dunne and Club Captain was Jack Geary.\n\nIn 1937 a 7 a side competition was organised in Killeen at the Palmers estate. Rahoon and Moycullen faced each other in the final. A shemozzle developed late in the game so much so that Rahoon cashier at entrance gate Peter Michael Kelehan decided it was wise to move the Finances elsewhere so that a demand for money back could not arise.\n\nIn 1940 Rahoon were drawn in the Junior Championship with Erins Hope, Ballindooley, Galway City, Moycullen and Castlegar. The Clouds of war were gathering in Europe and Rahoon along with many other clubs failed to field in 1941 and it would be 1945 before they returned again.\n\nRahoon affiliated a Junior and Minor team in the West Board in 1945 whilst the Second World War had yet to conclude. There are very few reports on matches during this time due to the shortage of news print and most stories were War news.\n\nJohn Griffin and Michael Tierney of Rahoon represented the Club at the West Board meetings. Tom Bermingham was Vice Chair of the West board in 1947. Rahoon played St Josephs and Erins hope in Championship. The Major source of Fundraising according to Treasurer Thomas Feeney was a Ceili held in Astaire Ballroom in Victoria Place in Eyre Square.\n\nIn 1947 Martin Joe Codyre was the first Rahoon player to play County Minor and played in the second half of All Ireland Hurling Final against Tipperary which Galway lost.\n\nIn 1948 Rahoon entered Junior and Minor Hurling teams and also a Junior Football team. The Hurlers played CIE, Erins Hope, Mellows and St Josephs in Junior. Paddy Murphy of Tonabrucky played Minor and shortly after emigrated to Canada. He would return many years later and provide the grounds for the Clubs pitch and clubhouse in Tonabrucky in late 1990’s.\n\nBartley Faherty of Corbally became treasurer in 1949.\n\nIn 1950 and 1951 Rahoon and Moycullen joined to participate in the Senior Championship under the Corrib Sarsfields name.

The game was played in Woodstock.\n\nIn 1952 after Ceili Mor in Furbo Hall Rahoon purchased new Jerseys and the colours now became Green and Red.\n\nIn 1954 John Dunne and Patrick Griffin Letteragh represented Rahoon at West board meetings.\n\nIn 1955 Rahoon minors beat Knocknacarra and Fr Tom Burkes before losing to Castlegar in the final at South Park.\n\nIn 1957 Rahoon won its first ever title by defeating Moycullen in the West board Junior Championship final at Pearse Stadium. Rahoon defeated Knocknacarra, Fr Tom Burkes, and Clan na Gael along the way. Training at the time was the Island on the banks of Lough Corrib near Barnacranny. Training was then switched in October to Jim Carr’s field in Circular Rd and the lights of cars and the stars overhead provided some light. Celebrations continued over the winter in Mary Ann Kelehans in Bushypark. There was no County Final stage for Junior B at the time.\n\nIn 1958 Rahoon fielded Junior A (Intermediate at the time) and a Junior B Team. This was the first time that the club had two adult teams since 1908. Indeed the Junior B team made it to the West board final before losing to Cois Fharraige.\n\n1n 1959 Rahoon won the Junior A West board title beating Claregalway before losing to Skehanagh in the Co Final.\n\nIn 1960 Rahoon were defeated in the West board Junior A Final by Fr Tom Burke’s.

Rahoon won the West board league final defeating Oranmore in the final.\n\nIn 1963 Gerry Cloherty was elected Vice Chair of the West Board. He then became Chairman of the West board from 1965 to 1967 before becoming County Board Chairman from 1968 to 1973. Paddy Joe Flaherty was Junior Captain and Owen Kearns was Minor Captain. It was agreed to hold a Raffle for a ton of Coal as a novel fundraising event in the Savoy Cinema opposite the GPO on today’s Eglinton Street. On Sunday night the Management of the Cinema kindly agreed to hold the draw at the interval of the film. However as the draw drum was being spun a ferocious racket broke out amongst those attending the Cinema. After these were ejected the ton of coal was won by a woman from Fairhill. The Club made £100 on the project.\n\nIn 1964 Rahoon won the West board County Championship defeating Oranmore. Star of the Rahoon team was Tex Thornton at midfield who had transferred from Spiddal a few years earlier. Rahoon defeated Annaghdown in the County semi-final but then were defeated by Gort in the Final who had controversially been allowed to regrade from Senior to Junior.\n\nIn 1966 Fr Ray Kelly was elected President and Paddy Joe Flaherty become Chairman, Eamon Noone was Secretary and Owen Kearns Treasurer.

Training was in Shantalla pitch under Martin Nestor and John Dunne. Hurleys were sourced from Doherty’s of Kilrush Co Clare.\n\nRahoon had now returned to Senior Hurling for the first time since 1909. Mick O Connell went on to feature for Galway minors, U21 and Senior’s, Johnny Walsh at U21 and Senior and Mike Malley at Intermediate and Senior. The historic victory even made the National paper the Evening Press on the 30th November carrying the headline “Rahoon win first title”.\n\nIn 1967 the Annual Social in the Sacre Coeur was attended by over 300 guests.

The Minor lost the west board final to Oranmore Maree and the U21’s the West board final to Cranmore. The 60’s were a glorious period winning West board league and Championship, Co Junior Championship and County Senior League titles.\n\nIn 1970 Rahoon were narrowly defeated by Ballinasloe in the County Championship and by Carnmore in the West board Senior Championship.

They were absent from U14, U16 and U17 competitions. At the same time there were successful juvenile hurling leagues in Mervue, Renmore, Woodquay and Newcastle. A small group of former and current players realizing the seriousness of the situation decided to set up a special under age section of the club.

Stephen had played for the club at a number of under-age levels and was an accomplished boxing champion. His family would later donate a trophy in his memory. Indeed when Rahoon faced Tommy Larkins in the first round of the Senior Championship a minutes silence for Stephen was observed. Rahoon were defeated in this game and reports from the match states that only for Pat McGrath in goals the defeat would been much heavier. Rahoon also suffered defeats to Carnmore and Sarsfields in the Senior championship.
