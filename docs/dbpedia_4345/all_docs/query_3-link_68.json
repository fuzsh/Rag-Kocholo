        "text": "On 4 September 1948 the Irish Independent newspaper carried a small announcement on page ten indicating that the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) had authorized the filming of the All-Ireland hurling and football finals of that year. These finals were to be filmed by the National Film Institute (NFI) of Ireland, set up three years earlier, and this announcement marked the beginning of the first sustained period of indigenous filming of Gaelic games in Ireland. Although important research has been done on the crucial link between the codification and popularization of Gaelic games in Ireland and the development of Irish nationalism in the late nineteenth century, the role that filmic representations of sport may have played in this developing process in the twentieth century has as yet been the subject of limited investigation. This article builds on previous research about the representation of Gaelic games in early newsreels between 1920 and 1939 in order to consider the filmic depictions of All-Ireland finals produced by the NFI and their role, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, in representing and affirming the Irish nation through sport. These films also offer fascinating insights into Irish society in the postwar period, while sharing intriguing links with one of the most accomplished (and controversial) sports films ever made, Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia (1938).\n\nThis article charts the movement towards what might be called, following from Richard Kearney’s 1995 book, a post-nationalist approach to representing gaelic games in film, particularly since the late 1960s through an examination of two films, Rocky Road to Dublin (1968) and Clash of the Ash (1987). However much gaelic games were part of the construction of Irish identity before and immediately after independence, the depiction of these games in films such as Rocky Road and Clash of the Ash, films which reflected the emergence of a critically engaged indigenous cinema in Ireland since the late 1960s, would also be part of the deconstruction of such an identity and critique of the failures of the state. Significantly, both these films use gaelic games as a means to interrogate and critically engage with certain mythologised and narrow-minded understandings of Irishness associated with the promotion of these games, including the issues of nationalism and masculinity.\n\nThis special number of Media History is conceived as a contribution to the ongoing scholarly analysis of sport’s social significance, as a set of mass-mediated practices and spectacles giving rise to a complex network of images, symbols and discourses. Its specific aim is to examine the distinctive contribution of various sports as communicated by a range of mass media – including journalism, cinema newsreels, school publications and television - to the creation of modern Irish identities. Sports considered include Gaelic games, association football, rugby and the promotion of British sports in Ireland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nThis peer-reviewed chapter emerged further to ongoing research into the representations of Gaelic games in the cinema and is focused on films directed, or part-directed, by John Ford, in particular The Quiet Man (1952), The Rising of the Moon (1957), and Young Cassidy (1965). For Ford, Gaelic games would seem to have provided a useful motif encapsulating prevailing stereotypes regarding the Irish, including their alleged proclivity for violence. Where referred to, hurling in particular seems inevitably to proceed or suggest an occasion of violence in Ford’s work. However, these allusions also reveal Ford’s tendency towards ‘self-interrogation, to raise doubts at key moments about their own veracity’ (Luke Gibbons) in the director’s focus as much on the prejudiced reactions of those unfamiliar with the sport of hurling as on the sport itself, never actually depicted in his films. Furthermore, Ford realized the performative potential of Irish stereotypes, exploiting in the process the comic potential of hurling (a process also evident in earlier American cinema) to diffuse anxieties regarding the Irish, and to help integrate Irish-American culture into mainstream American life.\n\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association's (GAA) meteoric rise to dominance in the 1880s reflected its success in tapping into an Irish sporting constituency left largely untouched by the games of the British Empire. However by the early 1890s, the GAA verged on extinction as the broader economic, social and political climate conspired against it. In its wake, sports as diverse as rugby union, cricket and soccer sought to capitalize and gain increasing popularity among Irish sportsmen. This article sets out to explore sporting developments in provincial Ireland during the 1890s to illustrate how the Association's demise was a major factor in the consolidation and spread of rival sports at that time. With the rejuvenation of the GAA in the years after 1900, it will explore the campaign conducted by the Association and its membership against those games that now gravely endangered its once powerful local and national monopoly.\n\n[Introduction to Media History Special Issue on Sport and the Media in Ireland]. The symbiotic relationship that has existed since the mid-nineteenth century between sport and the media - from the popular press, through newsreels and radio, to television, and beyond - is so well established as hardly to require comment. However, the very familiarity of this long and successful marriage should not blind us to its abiding, and abidingly remarkable, affective power, both for individuals and for communities, real and ‘imagined’, of all kinds. We may thus legitimately pause to reflect on the key role played by the media in establishing the local, national and international significance of what are inherently ephemeral and objectively trivial corporeal practices. This essay considers the historical development of media depictions of sport in Ireland and it's importance for constructions of Irish identities."
