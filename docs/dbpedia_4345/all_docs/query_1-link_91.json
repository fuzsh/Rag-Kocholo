        "text": "History beckons for Kilcoo\n\nWe have decided to take a leap forward to the 29th club that we visited on our epic journey in order to acknowledge Kilcoo’s Ulster final meeting with Crossmaglen on Sunday. On the final day of our trek we arrived at Kilcoo, which at first appearance seems no more than a church, a shop and two pubs at either end with the Mountains of Mourne in the background. Then there is the GAA club…\n\nWe received a fantastic welcome from the Eoghain Rúa Cill Chua club at Owen Roe Park as they had prepared a huge sign on the hillside – Keep ‘er Lit – a slogan synonomous with our penalty taker Barry McElduff. Indeed a photograph of us with Kilcoo club members appears on the back of Barry’s book of the same name. The club is adorned with photographs of victorious teams, underage and senior, and there were trays of sanndwiches, cake and mugs of tea generously prepared for our visit. After a few speeches, Terry O’Hanlon made a donation on behalf of the Kilcoo club to our fundraiser for the Simon Community helping the homeless.\n\nKilcoo was founded in 1906 and play in black and white. The club’s first competitive match took place on 13 January 1907 against local team Liatroim (who were the first club formed in the county). The match ended Kilcoo 0-0 Leitrim 0-5. Kilcoo won their first Senior County Championship in 1917 defeating Killyleagh in the final. The club have won the championship on eight other occasions. They have also won a number of minor titles in the last few years.\n\nThe club has a camogie team, a ladies football team and football teams at Under-8, Under-10, Under-12, Under-14, Under-16, Minor, Seconds, Thirds, Under-21 and Senior Level.\n\nFelim McGreevy and his son Dalach\n\n‘The club is bred into me’\n\nMidfielder Felim McGreevy talked about the incredible scenes and emotion when the Magpies won the senior title in 2009 for the first time in 72 years, their previous county title in 1937. Little were we to know, just over four months later the senior team would be playing in their first Ulster final. Indeed Felim scored a goal a point when Kilcoo won this year’s Down championship beating Mayobridge in the final. He has struggled with injury since but is expected to be fit to line out on Sunday against current All Ireland club champions Crossmaglen in the Athletic Grounds in Armagh.\n\nFelim had called up to the club with his four-year-old son Dalach. Age 26, he has been on the senior team for eight years and played minor and under 21 for Down. A club man through and through, he went to St Malachy’s High School before working as a joiner and has lived all his life in the area.\n\nFelim said, “There is nothing else but to play football here. My mother’s (Anne) side of the family are Kilcoo and the McEvoys played for the club. My father is a Downpatrick man. I was tramped over the fields from I was two or three to play football. It is bred into me up through underage to minor and under 21. It means a lot to play for the senior team as it is bred into you from no age. Getting onto the senior team was a privilege.\n\n“I’ve played midfield and been on the team regularly but am injured at the minute. I played in the county final in 2009. We beat Loughinisland. It was one of thre best days of my life. It was a tough first half. We let the occasion get to us a bit but came out in the second half and didn’t even let them score. It was the 4th of October 2009 in Newry. The hairs are standing on the back of my neck even now thinking about the final whistle. It was unbelievable.\n\n“The crowd was standing on the touchline for the final whistle and as soon as it went the pitch was invaded. I never seen anything like it. All my family and friends were there; everybody. It was very emotional for everyone. It was the first time we won it in 60 or 70 years so it meant a lot. I would rather have the club champioship than Sam Maguire. The community and club here is so tight-knit you just want to win and the winning mentality is bred into you. Winning the championship is the ultimate.\n\n“I have a wee lad, Dalach, and I’m trying to get him into football. He is football mad and is running about there with the Down kit on him. He is only four and is playing away. He loves playing football and that is the way it is handed down to the next generations here.”\n\nPlayers fundraising\n\nLike all the clubs we met, Kilcoo is self supporting through a range of fundraisers. Everyone in the club rows in behind the initiatives.\n\nFelim added, “We have a gym and are doing a draw. The second field here is relatively new. We are in the process of getting a gym and social club. The draw is at Christmas with the tickets £20 each. First prize is £10,000 and there will be £16,000 worth of prizes altogether. It’s a big draw and we will be going all over Ulster to sell them. The players will be involved in that as well. There are 60 team leaders and they have 100 tickets to sell. There are four or five of the senior panel that are team leaders and everyboby rows in at the club to raise funds. It is a whole community thing. The field was opened last year. We had a field behind it but the club brought ground and made this new field.\n\n“It is a great club for the men, women and the kids. There is camogie and ladies football at all levels in the club. Ladies football only started a few years ago and they have done well, winning the county championship.”\n\nNow Felim, his team-mates and the community prepares for the biggest game in its 106 year history. Crossmaglen stand between them and the Ulster title. It is a huge challenge against a great team. However Kilcoo is also a mighty club with a spirit that will leave everything on the field on Sunday afternoon. The 32-32-32 gang send our very best wishes to all our friends at Kilcoo – Keep ‘er lit!\n\nThe Penalty\n\nOur final business at Kilcoo was of course the penalty kick. After Oliver gave a rendition of the ‘Mountains of Pomeroy’ as he had at the previous 28 grounds, Barry put the ball on the penalty spot. Oz dived to his left but Barry had struck the ball to the other side and it nestled in the net after glancing off the right post."
