        "text": "By Tom Daly\n\n1909 - 2009\n\nThe Aodh Ruadh GAA Club was founded on October 24th 1909 at a public meeting called by Rev. Fr. James O'Daly C.C., a native of the Carrickmacross area. From the outset, it was established as a hurling and football club. A club had been formed in earlier years (1904), but once Aodh Ruadh was established in 1909 it maintained an unbroken existence and now celebrates its Centenary Year.\n\n1909\n\nThe beginnings of the Aodh Ruadh Club were based on the need for native pastimes in the area.\n\n24th October:\n\nInaugural meeting of Aodh Ruadh elected the following: President, Rev. J. O'Daly; Vice President, James Rogan; Secretary, Cecil Stephens; Treasurer, John Downey; Committee, D. Quinn, M.D. Quigley, John McCormack, Thomas McCaffrey, W. Gillespie, J. Ward, A. McShea, T.
