        "text": "Mooncoins GAA History\n\nIntroduction\n\nBy far the most popular sport in Mooncoin is hurling. It is held in high esteem by all the locals. At the moment, Mooncoins main team are in the intermediate division. Mooncoin is also represented in many different ages in hurling and camogie. These include minor, junior, Under 21 and Under 16. The local colours are green and white.\n\nMooncoins hurling history started officially with the founding of Mooncoin GAA in January 1886. The committee was:\n\nRichard Dunphy-President, John Walsh (portnascully)-vice president, James Comerford-Treasurer, Pat Fogarty-secretary.\n\nA gaelic football team was also officiated at the same time.\n\nMooncoin played in Kilkennys first county final in April 1887 but lost to Tullaroan. The following year in 1888 Mooncoin won their first county final and went on to win Leinster. Mooncoin had an immense rivalry with Tullaroan in the first 40 years of the GAA. One interesting fact is that either Tullaroan or Mooncoin were in every county final from 1887 up until 1930.\n\nBelow are pictures of Mooncoin teams who were Kilkenny Champions(Click to enlarge):\n\nMooncoin Kilkenny S.H.C 1908. 4th title Mooncoin Kilkenny Senior Hurling Champions 1927 Mooncoin Kilkenny Senior Hurling Champions 1928\n\nMooncoin Kilkenny Senior Hurling Champions 1932\n\nMooncoin Senior Hurling Champions 1965(last time they won)\n\nMany Mooncoin players have played for Kilkenny over the years. When Kilkenny first won the All-Ireland in 1904 there was three Mooncoin players on the team, namely Drug Walsh, Eddie and Dick Doyle. Kilkenny were actually represented by Tullaroan but the Mooncoin players were added because of their huge talent. Kilkenny won against Cork which was represented by St. Finbarrs.\n\nAt this time in Kilkenny, the team that won the county final represented Kilkenny, so Mooncoin jerseys would be worn when playing for Kilkenny (if Mooncoin had won the county final the year previously).\n\nKilkennys first all Ireland win in 1904 with 'Drug' Walsh, Eddie and Dick Doyle\n\nMooncoins biggest achievement in hurling is that it has the 2nd most county senior titles in Kilkenny (12 in all). Only Tullaroan are ahead(20). Futhermore, some people say that Mooncoin have 14 county titles. The reason for this is that the 1916 championship was not completed until 1919 because of political troubles. The Kilkenny county board decided to award the winners of the 1916 championship (i.e. Mooncoin) as winners of both the 1917 and 1918 county championship. Mooncoin also has the 2nd most county minor titles (8) and the joint most junior titles (4).\n\nMooncoins Roll of Honours\n\nEarly 1900's\n\nThroughout the first half of the 1900's, Mooncoins senior hurling team dominated Kilkenny hurling. They were feared all over the county and competed with Tullaroan as the greatest hurling parish in Kilkenny. Here are some the great names who represented Mooncoin at this time. They were known as the famous six:\n\nDick 'Drug' Walsh\n\nEddie Doyle\n\nDick Doyle\n\nMick Doyle\n\nDick Doherty\n\nJimmy Kelly\n\nDick 'Drug' Walsh(1878-1958)\n\n'Drug' Walsh was born in Rathkieran in 1878. He normally played full back for Mooncoin and centre back for Kilkenny. He was a medium sized man with exceptional speed of delivery and was super fit. He was said to have picked up his nickname 'Drug' or 'Drog' in primary school. While singing the song 'Clares Dragons'(or puff the magic dragon)' Dick pronounced the word dragon as drugan, and so the name stuck.\n\nNed Quinn (present Kilkenny chairman): \"I remember Drug at the age of 70 skipping through the tyre of a bicycle. And he had a chest full of an assortment of hurleys and sliotors along with golf irons. Drug used to go to the field at the back of the house and belt the golf balls. He was just a natural athlete\".\n\nDick was a legend in his own lifetime. This was attributed to the fact he played in 7 all-Irelands and won everyone of them. He also helped train Laois to their only all-Ireland victory over Cork in 1915, helping fellow Mooncoin man Bob O' Keeffe who was on the Laois panel. He was captain of the winning Kilkenny team three times. The next person in history of hurling to match Drugs achievements of captaining 3 all-irelands was none other than Corks, Christy Ring in the 1950's. Only 3 people have achieved this feat, the other being Tipperarys Mickey Maher in the late 1800's. Christy Ring was also the next person to break the record of 7 all-Irelands, when he won 8, again in the 1950's. Four Kilkenny men, held the record up to then(Drug Walsh-Mooncoin, Dick Doyle-Mooncoin, Jack Rochford-Threecastles, Sim Walton-Tullaroan). One final note on Drug is that he was the first man to captain a 15 a-side team(1913). Up to this there had been 17 a side.\n\nDrugs Achievements: 7 Leinster medals, Railway cup shield, 1 munster shield, 3 Co. Senior championship Medals(2 of them as captain), 7 all Ireland medals(3 as captain). The image below shows Drug standing outside a house on main street, Mooncoin, just in front of the church. The church car park now stands in its place (were the rose of Mooncoin monument now stands).\n\nMooncoin & Kilkenny Hurling Legend, Dick 'Drug' Walsh\n\nDrug Walsh of Mooncoin\n\nCome all you young fellows to my my story give ear,\n\nI tell of a stalwart, 'mong hurlers a peer\n\nWhose name is still cherished wherever they join\n\nBy sportsman and trueman - \"Drug\" Walsh from Mooncoin.\n\nWhen Cusack and Davin set a nation aflame\n\nWith a fervour and pride in its own native game\n\nA youth from the Suirside plucked a shapely caman\n\nSaying \"Ill strike for my sireland, fair Erin go Brath\".\n\nFull many an evening 'mid shouts loud and gay.\n\nThe sliotar sped swiftly in sportive affray.\n\nO'er green sod and cross road, a dark youth to the fore\n\nWhose prowess and skill -hurling's garlands foretold.\n\nSeven times in All-Irelands with victory crowned\n\nA record whose equal has yet to be found-\n\nFour gallant ate numbered, Rochford, Walton,Dick Doyle,\n\nAnd that youth from the Suirside, \"Drug\" Walsh from Mooncoin.\n\nWith eagle-eyed vision and speed of a deer,\n\nNo matter how hectic, in combat- no fear\n\nHis wristwork - an artist's, Kilkenny's own Doyen\n\nReigned the Prince among hurlers, \"Drug\" Walsh from Mooncoin.\n\nEddie Doyle (1887-1971)\n\nLike his two brothers, Eddie got his love for hurling from Pat ONeill principle of the national school in Mooncoin. He started playing senior for Mooncoin at the age of 15 and made his debut for Kilkenny a year later in the 1903 all-Ireland final against Cork. Achievements: Won 7 all ireland medals, A railway cup shield, Munster Feis and 3 Co. S. H. Championships.\n\nDick Doyle(1888-1959)\n\nDick was probably the most famous of the Doyles. Dick played in the full forward line usually partnering his brother Mick, whether it be for Mooncoin or Kilkenny. He played in the 1903 championship and the same year with Kilkenny at the age of 16. He was a fitness fanatic and would often stay after training for a few extra laps of the field.\n\nThe Doyles did not play much after 1913. One reason was that their father died that year. However another reason was that their was controversy around Kilkenny after the 1913 all-Ireland. This was Kilkennys first, and to date, only three in a row. At a banquet in Kilkenny, the county council decided to give each member of the team 18 pounds which was a lot of money in 1913. However the Doyles came under fire with snide remarks from certain people, as they jointly received 54 pounds. They did not like this kind of jibing and never fully returned to hurling afterwards.\n\nDicks Doyles Achievements: Won 7 all ireland medals, A railway cup shield, Munster Feis, 3 Co. S. H. Championships and one triple S.H.C 1916, 17, 18.\n\nMick Doyle(1889-1970)\n\nMick started playing for Mooncoin in 1904 at the age of 15. He played full forward with the county team of 1907, combining with his brother Dick. He was a classy, stylish player with pinpoint accuracy. Achievements: Won 5 all-ireland medals, Railway cup shield, munster feis, 3 co. senior championships and 1 triple.\n\nThe Doyle family\n\nBetween the 3 brothers there are 19 All-Ireland medals in the Doyle family.\n\nDick Doherty (1886-1966)\n\nHe was a very light player but was a magnificent classy hurler with lightning pace. Achievements: Won 5 all-ireland medals, Railway cup shield, munster feis, 3 co. senior championships.\n\nJimmy Kelly (1884-1966)\n\nJimmy was born in ballygorey and educated in Carrigeen NS. He played with Ballyduff, Co Waterford across the river suir in 1900. He is credited with arousing new interest in the game in Waterford. He was noted for his deadly accuracy and his wide rang of skills. He is noted to have practiced for hours. He used a 20 foot ladder for shooting up and down between the rungs and narrowed the opening by angling the ladder. A natural left-hander, he was equally good either side and was brilliant on the ground and over head. He played with Mooncoin in 1901 and with Kilkenny in 1904. Achievements: Went on to win 7 all Ireland medals with Kilkenny, Railway shield, munster feis and 3 county championships.\n\n1920's (Wattie Dunphy)\n\nThe next star to emerge from Mooncoin was Wattie Dunphy (1895-1972). He lead Kilkenny to all-Ireland victory in 1922 and holds the distinction of being the first Kilkenny captain to bring the Liam McCarthy cup back to Kilkenny. The Liam McCarthy cup was introduced the year previously, before this, the Great southern railway shield was presented to the All-Ireland winners. Great celebrations were had in Kilkenny as they had not won an all-Ireland for nearly 10 years (and they would not win another for 10 years).\n\nWattie was a farmer by trade. He was a big strong well built man with broad shoulders and weighing in at 13 stone. He played centre back for both Mooncoin and Kilkenny. His nephew Joe Dunphy carried on the tradition of playing for Kilkenny when he captained the Kilkenny minors to victory in 1961 and 62.\n\nWattie also created more history by captaining Leinster to win the very first railway cup on St. Patricks day 1927. Wattie also captained Mooncoin twice, in their famous 3 in a row victories(1927 28 29). He won 5 county senior medals with Mooncoin.\n\nWattie Dunphy\n\n1930's (Eddie Doyle)\n\nThe 1930's saw another star emerge from Mooncoin. His name was Eddie Doyle(1897-1948). This Eddie Doyle was no relation to the other famous Doyles of Dournane. This Eddie Doyle was from Luffany Carrigeen. He played with Mooncoin and Kilkenny throughout the 20's and 30's with is usual position being in defense.\n\nHe gave great performances for Kilkenny in the 1926 and 1931 all Ireland finals which they lost. However he received his first all-Ireland medal the year later in 1932. He capped off a great career by captaining Kilkenny to victory the following year(1933) in both the League and all-Ireland. He also captained Kilkenny in a tour of the USA in 1934.\n\nHe retired after this but was forced out of retirement for the 1936 county final against old enemies Tullaroan. He gave a man of the match performance along with his friend Tommy Carroll who also came out of retirement. Eddies son Noel went on to set up the Suir Electric company (which presently sponsor the Mooncoin hurling team) and the present GAA complex in Mooncoin is dedicated to Noel Doyle.\n\nEddie Doyle\n\nThis decade was to be the end of the great era of Mooncoin hurling that stretched back to the founding of the GAA. They would never be as dominate again despite a brief renascence in the 1960's.\n\n1960's\n\nMooncoin revival started with the minors winning in 1958. They also went on to win the minor title in 1960, 61, 62 and 64. However the success at minor did not totally translate to the senior grade with Mooncoin only winning one senior county title in 1965. They also lost the county final the following year.\n\nOne record was set in this era when Joe Dunphy (nephew of Wattie Dunphy) captained the Kilkenny minors to victory in both 1961 and 1962. This record has never been equaled. He also went on to captain Kilkenny in the senior all-Ireland of 1966 when they lost to Cork. Other Mooncoin players such as Claus Dunne were also on this team.\n\nMooncoins last major victory was the minor title of 1979 although they have also won the intermediate title since.\n\nBob O' Keeffe:\n\nBob O' Keeffe is another famous son of Mooncoin. He was born in Glengrant, Carrigeen, Mooncoin in 1880. He is famous because the current Leinster trophy (the Bob O' Keeffe Cup) is dedicated to his memory. Bob trained to be a teacher in De La Salle, Waterford and his first post was in Meath. While in Meath, he twice won the long puck championship of Ireland for Dunboyne. Later he moved to Laois were he was a prominent figure in them winning their only All-Ireland title in 1915. He was also president of the GAA from 1935-1938. He continued to be secretary of the Leinster council until his death in 1949. Bob never did play for Kilkenny.\n\nThe original Bob O Keeffe Trophy was the biggest trophy on offer in the GAA. It is 3 feet 8 inches, weighing 563 ounces with a capacity of 6 gallons. The celtic chase work was taken from the Book of Kells. The hurler depicted on top of the cup is barefooted which is attributed to Bob who originally played in this manner.\n\nIn 2005 the new Bob O'Keffee trophy was presented for the first time. The older larger version was decommissioned because of ware and tear. This trophy is a lot simpler in shape and design, and was originally used as a horse racing trophy. Fittingly the trophy was presented to a Kilkennyman, Peter Barry, when he captained Kilkenny to victory over Wexford in the Leinster final in July 2005.\n\nBob O Keeffe\n\nKilkenny legend DJ Carey with the original Bob O'Keeffe Trophy,2003\n\nPeter Barry with the new Bob O Keeffe trophy, July 2005"
