The championship was won by Cork, who defeated Louth by a ten-point margin in the final.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nLeinster Final\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Louth defeated Dublin 5–4 to 4–1 in the Leinster final on 26 July 1936, it was the last time Dublin would lose a match in the Leinster championship until they lost to Kilkenny on 23 June 1968. Dublin led through goals from Jean Hannon nad Ita McNeill at half time against 1–2 from Kitty Hanratty, Dublin added a goal from Eva Moran immediately after half time but Louth replied with a goal from Nellie McDonald and then took control in the last quarter with three more goals from Kitty Hanratty. Máire Ní Cheallaigh wrote in the Irish Press:\n\nPlaying with a dash and spirit that could not be checked, Louth regained the Leinster Camoguidheacht championship after a thrilling final in Killester yesterday. Fleet of foot and keen of eye, the Louth girls buikled into their work with a rare zest from the first whistle. They set a pace that Dublin did well to match but the end found the girls from the wee county lasting that pace the better, and it was in the last quarter of an hour that they earned a great victory. There was a weak link in the team from Brighde McGuinness in goal to Kitty Hanratty at full forward, there was an understanding that covered what few individual weaknesses existed. Rose Quigley delighted the crowd with her lengthy kicks that she brought into operation when she found her hurley blocked. In a lively and accurate Louth attack Kitty Hanratty was the star, with Bernie Donnelly and Nellie McDonald little behind her. In this department Louth held the advantage despite the great efforts of Maura Walsh and Peggy Griffin.\n\nMatches\n\n[edit]\n\nCork beat Clare 14–0 to 1–1, in a match in which Chris Markham of Clare became the first player to score a goal at the original Cusack Park in Ennis, a week before its opening. Galway defeated Sligo in the Connacht final. Galway were 2–2 to 0–2 ahead of Louth at half time in the semi-final but 1–3 from Kathleen Hanratty equalised the scores, Nellie McDonnell scored a goal to give Louth the lead and after a Galway point Kathleen Hanratty scored another goal.\n\nFinal\n\n[edit]\n\nHaving clawed their way back into the semi-final from six points down, Louth fell 3–1 to 1–1 behind at half time in the final and then 4–1 to 1–1 immediately on the resumption. They then looked like they were about to stage another great recovery. This time goals from Cork's Josie McGrath and Anne Barry in a three-minute period killed off their revival. Joan and Kitty Cotter became the first sisters to win All-Ireland medals.[7]\n\nChampionship Results\n\n[edit]\n\nFinal stages\n\n[edit]\n\nCork\n\nLouth\n\nMatch Rules\n\n50 minutes\n\nReplay if scores level\n\nMaximum of 3 substitutions\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAll-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship\n\nWikipedia List of Camogie players\n\nNational Camogie League\n\nCamogie All Stars Awards\n\nAshbourne Cup\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCamogie Association\n\nHistorical reports of All Ireland finals\n\nAll-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship: Roll of Honour\n\nCamogie on facebook\n\nCamogie on GAA Oral History Project"
