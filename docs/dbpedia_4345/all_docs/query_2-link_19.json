        "text": "After their hugely entertaining clash last Sunday week, it’s back to Croke Park this Saturday (6.0) for the All-Ireland SFC final replay, with Dublin bidding for a fifth successive title and Kerry attempting to take the Sam Maguire Cup for the first time since 2014.\n\nDublin are in an All-Ireland final replay for the second time in four seasons, having beaten Mayo by a point in 2016. It was their only All-Ireland final replay.\n\nKerry’s last All-Ireland final replay was in 2000 when they beat Galway by 0-17 to 1-10. The last championship draw between Dublin and Kerry was in the 2001 All-Ireland quarter-final when Kerry won by 2-12 to 1-12 in Thurles. Their only other replay was in the 1941 All-Ireland semi-final, which Kerry also won (2-9 to 0-3).\n\nALL-IRELAND FINAL SHORTS\n\n*Dean Rock scored 0-10 (0-6f, 0-1 '45') in the drawn All-Ireland final. That tally pushed him into second spot in the all-time Dublin senior footballers' scoring chart, leapfrogging above his current Dublin team-mate Bernard Brogan in the process. Dean has scored 14-416 (458) in his Dublin career, including 1-36 (0-26f, 0-2 '45') in this summer's championship and 2-32 (0-19f, 0-3mark, 0-1 '45') in this year's league. The legendary Jimmy Keaveney currently occupies top spot with 30-402 (492). Bernard Brogan is third with a career tally of 36-344 (452).\n\n*Kerry are seeking to win the title for the 38th time while Dublin are seeking their 29th crown.\n\n*Kerry and Dublin meet for the third time this year, with the Kingdom having won by 1-18 to 2-14 in an Allianz League clash in Tralee last February while the All-Ireland final was drawn.\n\n*Dublin’s last defeat in the All-Ireland final was against Down in 1994. Since then they have beaten Tyrone (1995-2018), Kerry (2011 and 2015), Mayo (2013-2016-2017).\n\n*Kerry’s last defeat in the All-Ireland final was in 2015 when they lost to Dublin. Dublin have won four and drawn one of their last five championship games with Kerry. It’s their best ever run against the Kingdom.\n\n*Dublin’s only defeat under Jim Gavin in the championship (2013-2019) came against Donegal in the 2014 All-Ireland semi-final. They drew with Mayo in the 2015 semi-final and 2016 final and won both replays. It leaves Gavin’s record as follows: Played 46; Won 42, Drew 3, Lost 1.\n\n*Dublin’s Allianz League and Championship record for this year is: Played 15: Won 11, Lost 3, Drew 1. Kerry’s record is: Played 15, Won 11, Drew 2, Lost 2.\n\n*Referee, Conor Lane takes charge of the All-Ireland final for a third time, having previously officiated in 2018 and 2016.\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP 2019\n\nDUBLIN\n\nDublin 5-21 Louth 0-10\n\nDublin 0-26 Kildare 0-11\n\nDublin 1-17 Meath 0-4 (Leinster final)\n\nDublin 5-18 Cork 1-17\n\nDublin 2-26 Roscommon 0-14\n\nDublin 1-16 Tyrone 0-13\n\nDublin 3-14 Mayo 1-10\n\nDublin 1-16 Kerry 1-16\n\nTop Scorers\n\nDean Rock.............1-36 (0-26 frees, 0-2 ‘45s’)\n\nCormac Costello....1-31 (0-18 frees, 0-4 ‘45s’)\n\nPaul Mannion.........0-24\n\nCon O’Callaghan...4-10\n\nBrian Fenton..........3-8\n\nKERRY\n\nKerry 1-15 Clare 0-12\n\nKerry 1-19 Cork 3-10 (Munster final)\n\nKerry 1-22 Mayo 0-15\n\nKerry 1-20 Donegal 1-20\n\nKerry 2-18 Meath 1-13\n\nKerry 1-18 Tyrone 0-18\n\nKerry 1-16 Dublin 1-16\n\nTop Scorers\n\nSeán O’Shea ..............1-48 (0-31 frees, 0-5 ‘45s’)\n\nDavid Clifford .............0-24 (0-6 frees)\n\nPaul Geaney ...............2-13\n\nStephen O’Brien ..........1-12\n\nKillian Spillane .............1-7\n\nLAST FIVE CHAMPIONSHIP CLASHES\n\n2019: Dublin 1-16 Kerry 1-16 (All-Ireland final)\n\n2016: Dublin 0-22 Kerry 2-14 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\n2015: Dublin 0-12 Kerry 0-9 (All-Ireland final)\n\n2013: Dublin 3-18 Kerry 3-11 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\n2011: Dublin 1-12 Kerry 1-11 (All-Ireland final)\n\nKERRY IN ALL-IRELAND FINAL REPLAYS\n\nThis will be Kerry’s ninth All-Ireland final replay, having won six and lost two of the previous eight.\n\n2000: Kerry 0-17 Galway 1-10\n\n1972: Offaly 1-19 Kerry 0-13\n\n1946: Kerry 2-8 Roscommon 0-10\n\n1938: Galway 2-4 Kerry 0-7\n\n1937: Kerry 4-4 Cavan 1-7\n\n1926: Kerry 1-4 Kildare 0-4\n\n1914: Kerry 2-3 Wexford 0-6\n\n1903: Kerry 0-8 Kildare 0-2 (Home final)\n\nLAST FIVE CHAMPIONSHIP RELAYS\n\nDUBLIN\n\n2016: Dublin 1-15 Mayo 1-14 (All-Ireland final)\n\n2015: Dublin 3-15 Mayo 1-14 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\n2007: Dublin 0-16 Meath 0-12 (Leinster quarter-final)\n\n2005: Tyrone 2-18 Dublin 1-14 (All-Ireland quarter-final)\n\n2002: Dublin 1-14 Donegal 0-7 (All-Ireland quarter-final)\n\nKERRY\n\n2017: Mayo 2-16 Kerry 0-17 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\n2014: Kerry 3-16 Mayo 3-13 (All-Ireland semi-final) after extra-time\n\n2010: Kerry 1-15 Cork 1-14 (Munster semi-final) after extra-time\n\n2009: Cork 1-17 Kerry 0-12 (Munster semi-final)\n\n2008: Kerry 3-14 Cork 2-13 (All-Ireland semi-final)\n\nDUBLIN v KERRY: CHAMPIONSHIP HISTORY\n\nThis will be the 31st championship meeting between the counties since they first met in 1892.
