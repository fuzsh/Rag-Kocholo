The championship was won by Dublin, who defeated Galway by a 25-point margin in the final on front of what the Irish Independent reported was one of the biggest crowds ever at a camogie match.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nStructure\n\n[edit]\n\nDublin beat Louth 5–0 to 1–3 in the Leinster semi-final and Meath 6–3 to 1–1 in the final. Antrim beat surprise finalists Monaghan 4–2 to 0–2 in the Ulster final. Galway beat Sligo by 4–0 to 1–2 in the sparsely attended Connacht final in Castlerea. Galway led Antrim by 2–0 to 1–2 at half time in the semi–final, then Antrim’s Winnifred Storey equalised with ten minutes to go. As the Irish Press reported:\n\nUnfortunately for Antrim the excitement seemed to spread to some of their players. They spoiled chances through over eagerness and their marking was not so keen. Galway took their chance and two quick goals from Celia Mulholland and Mary Joyce settled the issue, although Winnie Storey got another goal for Antrim just before the end. Thanks to their livelier forwards and their cleaner and more accurate striking Galway qualified for the All Ireland camóguidheacht final.[7]\n\nFinal\n\n[edit]\n\nJean Hannon and Angela Egan had Dublin two goals up within three minutes of the start of the final. Eveleen O'Beirne pulled a goal back for Galway but they never recovered. The Connacht Sentinel reported that Galway \"were best served by Jo Melvin in the goal who drew frequent rounds of applause for her saves\".[8]\n\nFinal stages\n\n[edit]\n\nDublin\n\nGalway\n\nMatch Rules\n\n50 minutes\n\nReplay if scores level\n\nMaximum of 3 substitutions\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAll-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship\n\nWikipedia List of Camogie players\n\nNational Camogie League\n\nCamogie All Stars Awards\n\nAshbourne Cup\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCamogie Association\n\nHistorical reports of All Ireland finals\n\nAll-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship: Roll of Honour\n\nCamogie on facebook\n\nCamogie on GAA Oral History Project"
