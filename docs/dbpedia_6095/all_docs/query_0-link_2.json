        "text": "Playtone (stylized on-screen as PLAY•TONE; a.k.a. Playtone Productions and The Playtone Company) is an American film and television production company established in 1998 by actor Tom Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman.\n\nIt was named after the fictional record company of the same name in the 1996 film That Thing You Do!, written and directed by Hanks; it also uses the same company logo, typically revealed on-screen with a brief instrumental snippet of the titular song itself, with some variations in each film depending on subject manner. The success of the film served as a spring-board to launch an actual Playtone Records label. Playtone has had an exclusive television development deal with HBO since the company was formed. Over the course of that time, Playtone's projects for HBO have won 46 Emmy Awards, while garnering 113 Emmy Award nominations.\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Film Directed by Production partner(s) Distributor(s) Released films 2000 Cast Away Robert Zemeckis ImageMovers 20th Century Fox (North America)\n\nDreamWorks Pictures (International)\n\n2002 My Big Fat Greek Wedding Joel Zwick Gold Circle Films, HBO Films and MPH Entertainment IFC Films 2004 The Polar Express Robert Zemeckis Castle Rock Entertainment, ImageMovers and Shangri-La Entertainment Warner Bros.
