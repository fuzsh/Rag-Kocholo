He mentioned that it would be “coming together,” but didn’t give any specifics, so we won’t put this in the In Development category just yet.\n\nGateway by Frederik Pohl\n\nOriginally published: 1977, St. Martin’s Press\n\nOptioned for: Television (Syfy)\n\nWhat it’s about: The discovery of Gateway, a space station belonging to the Heechee alien race, in a hollow asteroid leads to a kind of gold rush for the human race, as they endeavor to learn more about the Heechee and turn these artifacts into fortunes.\n\nStatus: Syfy announced in 2015 its intention to adapt the novel to series, with David Eick (Battlestar Galactica) revising a pilot script written by Josh Pate (Falling Skies).\n\nThe Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill\n\nOriginally published: 2016, Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill\n\nOptioned for: Film (Fox Animation)\n\nWhat it’s about: Every year, the people of the Protectorate leave a baby as an offering to an unseen witch.

In a recent column, Foz Meadows made the case for adapting the October Daye books—but as a TV series. As it turns out, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries writer Margaret Dunlap is adapting the series for television, but as she explained in a recent podcast, it’s a slow process.\n\nThe Paper Magician by Charlie N.

A year after Redshirts won the Hugo Award, FX bought the rights for a limited series on television. At the 2014 LA Festival of Books, Scalzi discussed the adaptation: “The book is the book; the book will always be the book. The book is designed for this medium: to be a novel. When we transfer it to television, we have to take what works in the novel that will also work in the medium of television. You have to understand when you get on the Hollywood train that your book is a source.”\n\nStatus: Still very much in the early stages. See also: Lock In.\n\nRobopocalypse by Daniel H. Wilson\n\nOriginally published: 2011, Doubleday\n\nOptioned for: Film (Dreamworks)\n\nWhat it’s about: Basically World War Z with robots, Daniel H.

Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game, Passengers) is in talks to direct the adaptation, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davison Killoran producing. Danny Boyle was previously attached to write the screenplay but left the project; perhaps Beukes, who is adapting her novel Zoo City as a screenplay, will take a stab at it.\n\nShip Breaker by Paolo Bacigalupi\n\nOriginally published: 2010, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers\n\nOptioned for: Film (Far East)\n\nWhat it’s about: The novel, set after the melting of the polar ice caps, contemplates a world in which many major cities are underwater and follows a young boy named Nailer who tries to help a girl named Nita escape a blackmail plot.\n\nStatus: Oscar-winning writer/director Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby, Crash) will direct the adaptation, the first in a planned trilogy.\n\nThe Silver Chair by C.S.

According to quotes he gave in 2009, it would seem that he had originally intended to make a film trilogy, then realized that the material would be better suited to a miniseries. Unfortunately, that was in a pre-Game of Thrones world where epic fantasies didn’t exist so comfortably on the small screen.

She never expected to be taken—expected he would take her beautiful, brave best friend Kasia—but as Agnieszka begins exploring the magic she never knew she had, it soon becomes clear why the Dragon felt compelled to take her instead.\n\nStatus: Naomi Novik is working with Ellen DeGeneres to adapt the novel.\n\nThe Watch, from the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett\n\nOriginally published: 1983, Colin Smythe\n\nOptioned for: Television (Narrativia)\n\nWhat it’s about: Described as a “Pratchett-style CSI,” this procedural would pull from stories about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch from the Discworld novels.\n\nStatus: In the Discworld Monthly Newsletter released in November 2015, Pratchett’s assistant Rob Wilkins wrote, “There will be no news from Narrativia regarding the Discworld Watch series until the first day on set.” That would imply that the project is still in some stage of development, without giving any sort of concrete timeline.\n\nWildwood by Colin Meloy (writer) and Carson Ellis (illustrator)\n\nOriginally published: 2011, Balzer + Bray\n\nOptioned for: Film (LAIKA)\n\nWhat it’s about: Set in an alternate version of Portland, OR, the middle-grade epic fantasy follows young Prue McKeel, who must enter the Impassable Wilderness after her little brother is abducted by a murder of crows.\n\nStatus: LAIKA picked up the rights shortly after publication, but the film, a stop-motion adaptation, has not been released yet.\n\nXanth series by Piers Anthony\n\nOriginally published: 1977, Ballantine Books & Del Rey\n\nOptioned for: Television and Film (SP Entertainment Group)\n\nWhat it’s about: Anthony’s long-running fantasy saga takes place in the eponymous land of Xanth, whose inhabitants develop their “talent,” or magic, to become powerful magicians while encountering mythological creatures and maybe popping back and forth into Mundania.\n\nStatus: Producer Steven Paul’s (Ghost in the Shell, Ghost Rider) SP Entertainment Group is launching development of the Xanth novels into both a feature film and a television series.\n\nY: The Last Man by Brian K. Vaughn (writer) and Pia Guerra (artist)\n\nOriginally published: 2002, Vertigo\n\nOptioned for: Television (FX)\n\nWhat it’s about: Brian K. Vaughan’s landmark comic book series—and the series that got me hooked on the medium—examines the fallout of a worldwide plague that wipes out everyone with an XY chromosome, except for aspiring escape artist Yorick and his monkey Ampersand. While the female survivors struggle to rebuild society, several groups target the last man and chase him across the Earth.\n\nStatus: The producer who wooed Vaughan into adapting his beloved series (which was wrapped up in movie deals for ages) for television? Nina Jacobson, who has a little hit on her hands with the Hunger Games franchise. Fans will be heartened to hear that Vaughan is very involved in the project; in fact, he will co-write the show with showrunner Michael Green (American Gods). Last we heard from FX, the script would be ready by early-to-mid 2017; it will be an ongoing series rather than a limited one.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAmerican Gods (Television, Starz)\n\nAdapted from: American Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\nOriginally published: 2001, William Morrow\n\nWhat it’s about: Showrunners Bryan Fuller (Hannibal) and Michael Green (Heroes) are excited to make Gaiman’s novel, about the battles between old gods and new, into a sort of anthology series.

Most of the cast has been set, with Ricky Whittle as Shadow, Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday, Emily Browning as Laura Moon, Jonathan Tucker as “Low Key” Lyesmith, and Crispin Glover as Mr. World.
